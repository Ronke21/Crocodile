<text>The Wicked Lady is a 1945 British costume drama film directed by Leslie Arliss and starring Margaret Lockwood in the title role as a nobleman&#x27;s wife who becomes a highwaywoman for the excitement. It had one of the largest audiences for a film of its period, with an estimated British attendance of 18.4 million seeing it in cinemas, according to a 2004 ranking of the most popular sound films in Britain. In the list, compiled by the British Film Institute for Channel 4, it was placed ninth overall, and was the second-most successful British film, behind only &quot;Spring in Park Lane&quot; (1948).

It was one of the Gainsborough melodramas, a sequence of very popular films made during the 1940s.

The story was based on the 1945 novel &quot;Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton&quot; by Magdalen King-Hall which, in turn, was based upon the (disputed) events surrounding the life of Lady Katherine Ferrers, the wife of the major landowner in Markyate on the main London–Birmingham road.

A remake, also named &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;, was made by Michael Winner in 1983.

==Plot==
In rural England in the late 1600s, Caroline invites her beautiful friend Barbara to attend her marriage with wealthy landowner and local magistrate Sir Ralph Skelton. However, the scheming Barbara soon has Skelton entranced, and it is Barbara who becomes Lady Skelton, as Caroline looks on. At the wedding reception, however, Barbara meets a handsome stranger, Kit Locksby. It is love at first sight for both, but it is too late.

Married life in the country becomes a bore for Lady Skelton—that is, until a visit from her detested sister-in-law Henrietta. In a game of Ombre, Henrietta wins Barbara&#x27;s prized jewels, including her late mother&#x27;s ruby brooch. A chance remark about a notorious highwayman, Jerry Jackson, gives Barbara an idea. Masquerading as Jackson, Barbara stops Henrietta&#x27;s coach and retrieves her brooch and the rest of her jewels. Intoxicated by the experience, she continues to waylay coaches until one night, she and the real Jerry Jackson finally meet. Jackson is amused to find his imitator a beautiful woman. They become lovers and partners in crime, with Barbara warning Jackson never to be unfaithful to her with another woman. 

Together, they profit off of unfortunate travellers. However, their plot to rob a huge gold shipment goes awry, resulting in the death of one of Sir Ralph Skelton&#x27;s tenants. One of Skelton&#x27;s servants discovers Barbara&#x27;s involvement, but she manages to convince him that Jackson forced her to be his accomplice. She also manipulates the servant&#x27;s religious piety, telling him that she wants to live an honest, clean life and is relying on him to show her the way. 

Pretending to be newly devout and honest, Barbara secretly poisons the servant. When he falls gravely ill and realizes what she&#x27;s been doing, Barbara smothers him with a pillow. Ecstatic at being free again, she rushes to the inn where she and Jackson often stayed, but finds him in bed with another woman. Enraged, Barbara anonymously betrays his whereabouts to her husband. Jackson is captured and sentenced to be hanged.

In London, Barbara views the execution with Caroline. In his speech from the scaffold, Jackson talks only of faithless women but does not refer specifically to Barbara. At his request (conveyed in a note by a priest on site), Barbara tries to give Jackson&#x27;s other woman some money, but the woman attacks Barbara&#x27;s carriage in a rage and a riot breaks out.

The two ladies are rescued by Kit Locksby, who has recently become engaged to Caroline. After the hanging, Jackson&#x27;s accomplices cut him down and revive him. He later breaks into Barbara&#x27;s bedroom at the estate and rapes her. Fearing his next move, she begs Kit to marry her. However, he will not betray Caroline. 

Late one evening, Barbara, in highwayman&#x27;s gear, awaits her husband&#x27;s coach with a loaded pistol. Jackson shows up and realises Barbara&#x27;s scheme. He plots to warn Skelton, but Barbara kills him. When the coach with Caroline, Ralph, and Kit arrives, Barbara, still in disguise, hijacks it and attempts to shoot her husband, not knowing the three have agreed to find a way for both couples to be together. Kit shoots her, but she escapes. Back at the estate, a mortally wounded Barbara confesses all to Kit, pleading he stay with her until the end. After her death, Caroline and Skelton reunite, determined to put the past behind them.

==Production==
Magdalen King-Hall&#x27;s &quot;Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton&quot; was published in 1944. Mason and Lockwood&#x27;s involvement in the movie adaptation was announced in November of that year, together with that of director Leslie Arliss.

In a 1945 issue of &quot;Picturegoer&quot;, Arliss said that it was Eleanor Smith (author of the book which had inspired his 1943 hit &quot;The Man in Grey&quot;) who gave him King-Hall&#x27;s novel. He went on to say:I told Maurice Ostrer of Gainsborough Pictures that I had found my ideal film subject and found that he had already purchased the rights himself! The character of Barbara is wicked enough even for me, and how vastly interesting is this most complex character as it develops through the action of the story.Lockwood later wrote in her memoirs, &quot;This was an enchantingly &#x27;wicked&#x27; part. At first, as usual, I did not like the thought of playing a villainous role again, but it was such a good one that I knew it would be madness to refuse it.&quot;

Stewart Granger turned down the role that Mason played. Lockwood practiced riding for the role and added a black beauty spot.

Caroline, the character played by Roc, is a movie script addition, not existing in the novel.

===Shooting===
Filming started March 1945. The film was made at Gainsborough Studios in London, with location shooting at Blickling Hall in Norfolk. James Mason disliked director Leslie Arliss, and hit him during filming.

Lockwood wrote &quot;we enjoyed making that film together. We did not enjoy remaking it, exactly one year later&quot;, when they had to re shoot scenes for American censors.

==British reception==
===Release===
Queen Mary wished to attend the film&#x27;s premiere, which caused some concern in light of the film&#x27;s subject matter; reportedly, the operator in the projection box turned down the sound during key exchanges of dialogue. However, Queen Mary told J. Arthur Rank that she enjoyed the film, and felt it had &quot;a fine moral&quot;. Rank later said:
Queen Mary is the only person to see in the film what I see myself. I only agreed to it because there’s a moral in it. You have two pretty girls, Margaret Lockwood and Pat Roc. One of them falls to temptation, and gets shot in the end; the other lives happily. That’s the moral. Both girls are pretty, you see; it wouldn’t have meant anything if one of them had been plain.

===Box office===
&quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; was the most popular film at the British box office in 1946. According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot;, the &quot;biggest winner&quot; at the box office in 1946 Britain was &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;, with &quot;runners up&quot; being &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Piccadilly Incident&quot;, &quot;Road to Utopia&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow is Forever&quot;, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, &quot;Wonder Man&quot;, &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, &quot;Kitty&quot;, &quot;The Captive Heart&quot;, &quot;The Corn is Green&quot;, &quot;The Spanish Main&quot;, &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Gilda&quot;, &quot;Caravan&quot;, &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot;, &quot;The Years Between&quot;, &quot;O.S.S.&quot;, &quot;Spellbound&quot;, &quot;Courage of Lassie&quot;, &quot;My Reputation&quot;, &quot;London Town&quot;, &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Meet the Navy&quot;, &quot;Men of Two Worlds&quot;, &quot;Theirs is the Glory&quot;, &quot;The Overlanders&quot;, and &quot;Bedelia&quot;.

In a 2004 British Film Institute list of the most popular sound films in British cinemas, &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; was ninth overall, with an estimated attendance of 18.4 million. It was second only to &quot;Spring in Park Lane&quot; among British films, in a ranking broadcast by Channel 4.

In Latin America, &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; earned $160,475 in box office takings.

==US release==
Problems with American censors made extensive re-shooting necessary before the film was released in the United States (according to Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies).

The problems were that the women&#x27;s dress bodices (appropriate for the era portrayed) were very low-cut and showed too much cleavage for the USA motion picture production code. It was a problem Jane Russell had in &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (1943). TCM sometimes airs the original, uncensored version on its USA basic cable network.

Margaret Lockwood said &quot;We had to do nine days of retakes to satisfy the censor on that film and it all seemed very foolish.&quot;

Mason said &quot;I don&#x27;t like it now&quot;, referring to the film after the changes.

==Proposed sequel==
Executive producer Maurice Ostrer reportedly wanted to make a sequel, but this was vetoed by J. Arthur Rank, who had taken over ownership of Gainsborough Studios. In 1950, it was announced that Arliss had written a sequel, &quot;The Wicked Lady&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, but the film was never made.

<text>Stephen Hunter (born March 25, 1946, in Kansas City, Missouri) is an American novelist, essayist, and film critic.

==Life and career==
Hunter was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and grew up in Evanston, Illinois. His father was Charles Francis Hunter, a Northwestern University speech professor who was murdered in 1975 by two male prostitutes. His mother was Virginia Ricker Hunter, a writer of children&#x27;s books. After graduating from Northwestern in 1968 with a degree in journalism, he was drafted for two years into the United States Army. He served in the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment in Washington, D.C., a unit that has both operational and ceremonial missions, the latter most notably being the guard force for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. He also wrote for a military paper, the &quot;Pentagon News.&quot;

He joined &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; in 1971, working at the copy desk of the newspaper&#x27;s Sunday edition for a decade. He became its film critic in 1982, a post he held until moving to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in the same function in 1997. In 1998 Hunter won the American Society of Newspaper Editors Distinguished Writing Award in the criticism category, and in 2003 he received the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. He accepted a buyout from the &quot;Post&quot; in 2008.

Hunter&#x27;s thriller novels include &quot;Point of Impact&quot; (filmed as &quot;Shooter&quot;), &quot;Black Light&quot; and &quot;Time to Hunt&quot;, which form a trilogy featuring Vietnam War veteran and sniper Bob &quot;the Nailer&quot; Swagger. The story of Bob Lee Swagger continued with &quot;The 47th Samurai&quot; (2007), &quot;Night of Thunder&quot; (2008), &quot;I, Sniper&quot; (2009), &quot;Dead Zero&quot; (2010), &quot;The Third Bullet&quot; (2013), &quot;Sniper&#x27;s Honor&quot; (2014) and &quot;G-Man&quot; (2017). The series has led to two spin-off series: &quot;Hot Springs&quot;, &quot;Pale Horse Coming&quot;, and &quot;Havana&quot; form another trilogy centered on Bob Swagger&#x27;s father, Earl Swagger, while &quot;Soft Target&quot; (2011) focuses on Bob&#x27;s long-unknown son, Ray Cruz.

Hunter has written three non-fiction books: &quot;Violent Screen: A Critic&#x27;s 13 Years on the Front Lines of Movie Mayhem&quot; (1995), a collection of essays from his time at &quot;The Sun&quot;; &quot;American Gunfight&quot; (2005), an examination of the November 1, 1950 attempted assassination of Harry S. Truman; and &quot;Now Playing at the Valencia&quot; (2005), a collection of pieces from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Hunter has also written a number of non-film-related articles for &quot;The Post&quot;, including one on Afghanistan: &quot;Dressed To Kill—From Kabul to Kandahar, It&#x27;s Not Who You Are That Matters, but What You Shoot&quot; (2001).

Hunter is a firearms enthusiast, well known in the gun community for firearm detail in many of his works of fiction. He himself shoots as a hobby, saying &quot;many people don&#x27;t understand, shooting a firearm is a sensual pleasure that&#x27;s rewarding in and of itself.&quot;

In an interview with NPR on February 16, 2011, Hunter defended the public availability of high-capacity magazines after the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others. He also said that it was not clear whether the 33-round magazine used by shooter Jared Lee Loughner played a part in the shooting. He had previously written in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that extended magazines are particularly valuable to women and the elderly, who he said could use them effectively as an alternative to semi-automatic rifles or shotguns. He points out that &quot;women generally don&#x27;t care to put in the training needed to master [rifles and shotguns]. Nor can the elderly handle [long guns] adeptly.&quot;

<text>Kolho is a village in the city-municipality of Mänttä-Vilppula in Finland.

During the Finnish Civil War, in winter 1918, the Finnish air force used Kolho as a base. Kolho has influenced a number of Finnish artists ranging from Eero Järnefelt, Akseli Gallen-Kallela to Pentti Saarikoski and also was the site of the worst church boat accident in Finnish history. Kolho played a role in the rise of the Finnish paper industry together with the neighbouring Mänttä community. More recently Kolho is known for its natural environment and is a summer resort destination.

James Vehko (aka Jalmari Vehkomäki), the designer of the first Ford&#x27;s metallic automobile chassis, was originally from Kolho.

<doc id="822161" wikidata="Q655312" url="?curid=822161" title="German submarine U-28 (1936)">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-28&quot; was a Type VIIA U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II.

Her keel was laid down on 2 December 1935, by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen. She was launched on 14 July 1936, and commissioned into &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; on 12 September 1936, with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Wilhelm Ambrosius in command. Ambrosius was succeeded by nine other commanding officers over the next eight years.

&quot;U-28&quot; conducted seven war patrols between 19 August 1939 and 15 November 1940, all under the command of &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Günter Kuhnke, sinking 13 ships totaling and damaging two others totaling .

After her third patrol, &quot;U-28&quot; became a training vessel and was used to bring new U-boat crews up to standard. She was sunk in a training accident on 17 March 1944 and stricken on 4 August 1944.

==Construction and design==

===Construction===
&quot;U-28&quot; was ordered by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; on 1 April 1935 as part of the German Plan Z and in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Her keel was laid down in the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen as yard number 909 on 2 December 1935. After about ten months of construction, she was launched on 14 July 1936 and commissioned into the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; as the third Type VIIA submarine on 12 September 1936 under the command of &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Wilhelm Ambrosius.

===Design===

Like all Type VIIA submarines, &quot;U-28&quot; displaced while surfaced and when submerged. She was in overall length and had a pressure hull. &quot;U-28&quot;″s propulsion consisted of two MAN 6-cylinder 4-stroke M 6 V 40/46 diesel engines that totaled . Her maximum rpm was between 470 and 485. The submarine was also equipped with two Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie GG UB 720/8 electric motors that totaled . Their maximum rpm was 322. These power plants gave &quot;U-28&quot; a maximum speed of while surfaced and when submerged. She had a range of while traveling at on the surface and at when submerged.

The U-boat&#x27;s test depth was but she could go as deep as without having her hull crushed. &quot;U-28&quot;″s armament consisted of five torpedo tubes, (four located in the bow and one in the stern). She could have up to eleven torpedoes on board or 22 TMA mines or 33 TMB mines. &quot;U-28&quot; was also equipped with a C35 88 mm gun/L45 deck gun with 220 rounds. Her anti-aircraft defenses consisted of one  anti-aircraft gun.

==Service history==

===First patrol===
&quot;U-28&quot;″s first war patrol took place from 19 August to 29 September 1939. On 14 September, while sailing around the mouth of St George&#x27;s Channel, &quot;U-28&quot; sank a 5,000 GRT freighter, which was her only success of the patrol.

===Second patrol===
&quot;U-28&quot;″s second war patrol took place from 8 November to 12 December 1939. For this effort she was instructed to lay a minefield near the port city of Swansea. En route to Bristol, &quot;U-28&quot; sank two ships; the 5,000 GRT Dutch tanker MV &quot;Sliedrecht&quot; and the 5,100 GRT British freighter SS &quot;Royston Grange&quot;. &quot;U-28&quot; then laid her minefield and returned to port in Germany. While the minefield was not an immediate success, it sank the 9,600 GRT British freighter 60 days after it was laid.

===Third patrol===
&quot;U-28&quot;″s third sortie took place from 18 February to 25 March 1940. She was instructed to lay mines off the British Naval Base at Portsmouth. After &quot;U-28&quot; laid the minefield, she went on to sink two ships for 11,200 GRT.

===Fourth patrol===
&quot;U-28&quot;″s fourth war patrol took place from 8 June to 7 July 1940. She was sent to the Western Approaches and turned in an average performance of sinking three ships totalling 10,300 GRT. The Irish government sought an explanation from Germany for the sinking of the neutral Greek ship &quot;Adamandios Georgandis&quot;: &quot;the entire cargo of which comprised grain for exclusive consumption in Éire&quot; She was sailing from Rosario (in Argentina) to Cork with a cargo of wheat when she was torpedoed and sunk south-west of Ireland at .

===Fifth patrol===
&quot;U-28&quot;″s fifth war patrol took place from 11 August to 17 September 1940 and was one of Kuhnke&#x27;s most productive. In August, she sank two ships for 5,500 GRT. On 10 September, &quot;U-28&quot; found and tracked Convoy OA 210. In the darkness of early morning on 11 September, &quot;U-28&quot; attacked the convoy and claimed two large freighters (13,000 GRT each) sunk and caused damage to a 10,000 GRT tanker, bringing Kuhnke&#x27;s total for the patrol to five ships for 30,000 GRT. However, during the postwar analysis, he was only credited with sinking a 2,000 GRT Dutch freighter and damaging a 4,700 GRT British freighter; which, combined with his earlier sinkings, brought his total to four ships for 9,945 GRT. On his return to Lorient, France, Kuhnke was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross for his work.

===Sixth patrol===
&quot;U-28&quot;″s sixth and final war patrol took her from Lorient back to Germany; because of the heavy seas and foul weather, &quot;U-28&quot; sank only half a ship for 2,694 GRT. (&quot;U-28&quot; and shared credit for the sinking of the SS &quot;Matina&quot;). On 15 November 1940, she returned to Germany and was turned over to the training command. Günter Kuhnke proceeded to command .

==Fate==
&quot;U-28&quot; sank by accident on 17 March 1944, at the U-boat pier in Neustadt, Germany. During a training exercise, the boat had passed under a dummy freighter used for target practice. The commander-in-training failed to note the position of the stationary freighter, and the U-boat&#x27;s conning tower was ripped off. Water flooded the control room, but the other compartments remained intact. The crew escaped by slowly equalizing the water pressure in the boat and swimming to the surface. The boat was raised in March 1944, but was stricken on 4 August. The submarine&#x27;s crew suffered no casualties during her career.

==Wolfpacks==
&quot;U-28&quot; took part in one wolfpack, namely:
* Prien (12 – 17 June 1940)

<text>A personal advertisement, sometimes called a contact ad, is a form of classified advertising in which a person seeks to find another person for friendship, romance, marriage, or sexual activity. In British English, it is commonly known as an advert in a lonely hearts column. In India, it is a dating ad or matrimonial ad.

The earliest personal ads were placed in newspapers among other classified ads, and typically had matrimony as the objective. As interest in personal ads grew, newspapers provided personals sections specifically for those ads. Later, newspapers and magazines for the sole purpose of personal ads were published. Lonely hearts clubs were organized in the 20th century to provide listings of ads to their fee-paying members. With the advent of the Internet, personal ads began to appear on online sites as well, eventually turning into profiles on dating sites and apps.

Personal ads have been described by a researcher as &quot;a valuable way of finding potential mates for those whose social world has been artificially constrained by contemporary urban life and the demands of modern employment practices&quot;. However, personals have also been used by criminals—con artists, fraudsters, and killers—to find and lure victims.

Public opinion toward personal ads varies over time, from disapproval and suspicion in the 17th and 18th centuries to a patriotic service in the United States during the Civil War and to general public acceptance in modern day.

== History ==
The earliest personal ads in England and the United States were satirical. A London magazine published a satirical marriage ad in 1660, supposedly from a widow urgently in need of &quot;any man that is Able to labour in her Corporation&quot;. By 1691, entire catalogs of satirical ads for husbands and wives were published for entertainment. &quot;The New-England Courant&quot;, by brothers James and Benjamin Franklin, printed a satirical marriage ad on its front page on April 13, 1722, ridiculing those who married for money.

The first genuine personal ad in England was published on July 19, 1695, in a weekly pamphlet published by John Houghton. London&#x27;s 53 major newspapers all published matrimonial ads by 1710. In 1761, the first personal ad in England written by a woman was published in the &quot;Aris Gazette&quot;. In addition to the offices of the newspapers themselves, various local businesses, such as haberdashers, booksellers, and especially coffee houses, accepted replies to personal ads on behalf of the advertisers. As more women began to place ads, more discreet shops and libraries became the preferred intermediaries, as only men frequented coffee houses.

Possibly the earliest genuine personal ad in the United States was published on February 23, 1759, on page 3 of the &quot;Boston Evening-Post&quot;. The &quot;Public Ledger&quot; in Philadelphia, founded in 1836, was the first newspaper in the United States to feature personal ads regularly. Marriage ads in the &quot;Ledger&quot; cost twenty-five cents. In 1840, an editorial in the paper claimed that most ads received 25–500 replies on average. From 1866 until the 20th century, the most widely read newspaper in the United States, the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, printed personal ads on the front page.

In France, the magazine &quot;Le Chasseur français&quot; (&quot;The French Hunter&quot;) first published matrimonial ads in the 1880s.
Many 18th century newspaper readers considered the personal ads to be jokes, hoaxes, or scams. Georgian society enjoyed mocking personal ads in plays such as Isaac Bickerstaffe&#x27;s &quot;Love in the City&quot;, W.T. Moncrieff&#x27;s &quot;Wanted: a wife&quot;, Sarah Gardner&#x27;s &quot;The Advertisement&quot;, George Macfarren&#x27;s &quot;Winning a Husband&quot;, and Maria Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Fitzroy&quot;. A popular anonymous novel in 1799 was &quot;Belinda; or, An Advertisement for a Husband&quot;. Newspapers in England reported on successful marriages resulting from personal ads, and printed cautionary tales when an advertiser was made to look foolish or found himself trapped in an unfortunate pairing. American newspapers printed stories ridiculing matrimonial ads and editorials accusing the ads of soliciting nonmarital sex.

In the United States, women placing or answering personal ads were met with public disapproval and suspicion. This changed during the Civil War: soldiers and sailors placed personal ads to find correspondents, and for a woman to reply to these ads was considered a patriotic act. Many military men and their correspondents formed romantic relationships.

In 1870, entrepreneur Leslie Fraser Duncan established the &quot;Matrimonial News&quot; in England, offering 40-word ads for six pence. The following year, Duncan opened offices in San Francisco and Kansas City, Missouri. Publishing thousands of personal ads, &quot;Matrimonial News&quot; served for three decades to &quot;promote marriage and conjugal felicity&quot;. Many ads included photographs. The cost to men for a forty-word ad was twenty-five cents; women&#x27;s ads (also limited to forty words) were free; additional words cost one cent per word for both men and women. Replies to ads were routed through the &quot;Matrimonial News&quot; offices. By the 1890s, &quot;Matrimonial News&quot; was printing a large number of fake ads. Between 1870 and 1900, at least twenty periodicals dedicated to personal ads had been launched in England.

In 1885, a group of married Black women in Arizona Territory formed the Busy Bee Club to advertise for wives for Arizona miners, hoping to reduce violence in the mining camps and encourage Black women to move to the area.

A unique magazine was established in England in 1898, &quot;Round-About&quot;. It was dedicated to &quot;companionship&quot; ads for people wishing to enter in correspondence with those of the opposite sex. Ads seeking companionship or correspondence, rather than strictly marriage, became more frequent in the early 20th century. The publisher of a popular magazine, &quot;The Link&quot;, was charged in 1921 for conspiring to corrupt public morals by &quot;introducing men to men for unnatural and grossly indecent practices&quot; as gay men were placing discreetly worded ads in &quot;The Link&quot;.

In the United States, the number of personal ads decreased drastically during the 1930s through the 1950s, as dating became more common and acceptable, more men and women were attending college, and couples had greater mobility as cars were more available. In the 1960s, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; began publishing personal ads, and ads from swingers appeared in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in 1961.
The earliest periodical used for gay personals was &quot;The Hobby Directory&quot;, established in 1946 by the National Association of Hobbyists for Men and Boys. The magazine consisted solely of personal ads, purportedly for members to &quot;find hobby friends&quot;. &quot;The Hobby Directory&quot; was openly sold in craft stores.

Matrimonial or &quot;lonely hearts&quot; clubs began forming in the 20th century, primarily in the United States. These clubs accepted ads from their members for an enrollment fee. Some clubs published papers and magazines dedicated to members&#x27; ads or compiled the ads into lists and catalogs that were mailed to the club members. Post-World War II, lonely hearts clubs and marriage advisory bureaus became a huge business in West Germany. The &quot;lonely hearts&quot; designation reflected the social stigma associated with personal ads. There were at least 500 lonely hearts clubs by 1961, with membership estimates between 100,000 and 4 million. Club operators referred to themselves as &quot;marriage brokers&quot;. As computer dating and single clubs became available, lonely hearts clubs diminished.

Magazines and newspapers for matrimonial ads had mostly disappeared in 1961 in England, while newspapers and magazines devoted to personal adstraditional, explicit, and aberrantproliferated in the United States during the late 1960s. The underground paper, &quot;International Times&quot;, founded in 1966, was the first to publish openly gay personal ads. After homosexuality was legalized in England in 1967, new publications featuring personal ads for homosexuals were established, such as &quot;Jeffrey&quot; and &quot;Gay Times&quot;, and gay ads began to appear in mainstream publications by the end of the 1970s.

By the late 1980s, publications as disparate as the &quot;New York Law Journal&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; added personal ads to their content. Placing an ad to find a romantic partner had become an acceptable alternative to conventional methods of meeting people.

A unique form of personal ad began to appear in the 1990s: ads to find reproductive partners. Typically placed by lesbians or gay men, the ads seek someone to donate eggs or sperm to enable the advertisers to have children.

The first online dating service was founded by Joan Ball in 1964. Operation Match, begun in 1965, was the first online dating service in the United States. These services involved questionnaires and computer matching. Match.com in 1995 was one of the first sites to host personal ads online. At the time, few people had computer access. As Internet access increased, so did interest in online personal ads and computer dating, with the first free dating sites appearing between 2005 and 2010. With smartphones, dating apps such as Tinder became popular. While personal ads in publications never gained social acceptance in France, the use of online dating sites are more popular. Online personal ads are freed from the space limitations of print ads. Additionally, websites and apps that host personals typically provide automated menus or sortable categories for common information, freeing the advertiser to tailor the narrative portion of the ad to their specific objectives.

== Historical motivations ==
Multiple aspects of 19th century society in England combined to make personal ads a viable alternative: the general confinement of women to &quot;private life&quot;; professions such as trade or the military, limiting both the time and social network to meet potential partners; remote locations with small populations; urban expansion that brought many people to the cities, where they were apart from the social and familial networks they had been accustomed to. For some, there were no potential partners nearby; for others, there were potential partners but no means of meeting them in a socially acceptable manner. In the United States, between 1820 and 1860, populations in cites had increased by 797%, many of the new urbanites lacking social or family networks through which they might meet potential partners.

Women in particular found personal ads to be a means for exercising some control over their circumstances. An 1890 study of female respondents to personal ads in the United States found that they sought independence from societal expectations and a degree of equality in the matter of marriage. (The criminologist who performed the study was scandalized by the responses, believing &quot;they bordered on moral depravity&quot;.)

The years following the Civil War in the United States brought a huge mismatch in the number of available men in the east (more than 600,000 killed in the war) and in the number of available women on the western frontier, where mostly men had migrated to pursue mining, fur trading, farming, logging, and exploring. Rural areas of Illinois in the 1850s, for example, averaged one woman for every twenty-five men. In England, the 1861 census revealed a significant numerical surplus of women, due to emigration and earlier deaths. States in the western United States which suffered from the imbalance between men and women passed numerous laws intended to encourage women to immigrate, such as property protection for women (as opposed to coverture laws common in eastern states) and female suffrage. The welcoming political climate was an incentive for women to respond to marriage ads and marriage recruiting efforts.

In the early 20th century, answering matrimonial ads was a route to entering the United States after immigration limits became more restrictive. It was also a means of escaping war-torn regions. In 1922, two ships docked in New York with 900 mail-order brides from Turkey, Romania, Armenia, and Greece, fleeing the Greco-Turkish War.

== Observations ==
Most ads in the 1700s were placed by men; of those placed by women, the majority were by widows. The earliest ads placed an emphasis on economic factors, but by the end of the 18th century, ads revealed an interest in romantic love. Despite the shifting interest toward compatibility and personality, money continued to be mentioned in ads through the 19th century.

From about 1820 to 1870, ads from women rarely appeared. By 1884, working-class men and women joined the middle class in the personal ad pages.

Ads in the 19th century were mostly placed by men in their twenties, frequently claiming to be &quot;of good character&quot; and &quot;respectable&quot;. The ads indicated that the top priority for respondents was age, with 18–25 being most desirable. The men sought personality traits such as &quot;amiable&quot;, &quot;agreeable&quot;, or &quot;of good disposition&quot;. They also used terms reflecting a degree of class consciousness, such as &quot;a young lady of refinement&quot;, &quot;respectably connected&quot;, and a &quot;good English education&quot;. With the introduction of the Kodak camera in 1888, personal ads became more likely to include a photograph or to state &quot;photos exchanged&quot;.

Personal ads placed in the 1920s no longer focused on an object of matrimony, but might instead seek companionship, a partner for activities, or sexual dalliances. Ads for same-sex partners used discreet phrasing to avoid legal difficulties.

After World War I, there was a &quot;surplus&quot; of 1.7 million women in England, and the number of personal ads placed by women began to exceed the number placed by men.

While early ads frequently specified marriage as the objective, in later years, ads revealed a greater range of expectations, such as the ambiguous &quot;to meet&quot;, companionship, long-term relationship, platonic friendships, and casual sexual encounters. Modern ads generally include information about the advertiser (such as sex, age, physical appearance, ethnic group, religion, interests, professional and personal characteristics), and information about the type of person the advertiser is seeking.

Men placing ads seeking women mostly specify younger ages, while women placing ads seeking men look for partners their age or older. Some analyses identify ads by favored groups (older men and younger women) as stating more requirements for the desired partner, while ads by less valuable groups (younger men and older women) being less restrictive. In general, the older the advertiser, the more likely that their ad includes language to mitigate their age, such as &quot;youthful 44&quot;, &quot;young at heart&quot;, or &quot;young outlook&quot;.

Multiple studies of personal ads in the 20th century found that ads from men seeking women are more likely to place importance on physical attractiveness and ads from women seeking men are more likely to focus on financial security and psychological characteristics. Research in 1998 found increased mentions of professional and personality characteristics by both men and women, as well as more mentions of attractiveness of potential partners in ads placed by women. It also noted an emphasis on nonsmoking by both men and women. A 1989 study found an emphasis on health in gay ads, likely related to the AIDS crisis.

Ads placed by lesbians value personal characteristics, such as humor and intelligence, and also mates who describe themselves as &quot;feminine&quot;. They are generally less likely than heterosexual women to include descriptions of their own physical characteristics in their ads.

Ads placed by gay men place an importance on physical attractiveness similar to heterosexual men. Gay men seeking sexual activities indicate a greater age range acceptable than those seeking long-term relationships.

In India, matrimonial ads are published in the Sunday editions of major national and regional newspapers. Ads are generally placed by families when it is not feasible to find prospective spouses within their familial or social networks. Matrimonials generally include caste markers, personal attributes, and educational and professional qualifications. The matrimonial listings are grouped first by groom or bride wanted; next, by native language; third, by religion; and fourth, by caste.

Personal ad magazines in Russia organize ads in categories such as &quot;He seeks her. Matrimony&quot;, &quot;She seeks him. Flirt&quot;, &quot;He seeks him&quot;, &quot;She seeks her&quot;, and &quot;For couples&quot;.

== Abbreviations ==
Due to space limitations in print ads, abbreviations for the vocabulary of personal ads became conventional in the 20th century. Some of the earliest abbreviations appeared in personal ads in &quot;Gay Times&quot;.

Some abbreviations describe the advertiser and target of the ad by marital status, ethnic group, and sex, such as MWM (married white male) and DBF (divorced black female). Some indicated a common characteristic, such as GSOH (good sense of humor) and NS (non-smoking).

In India, matrimonial ads use a unique shorthand so ads can fit within the restraint of 50 words or less. For example, BHP stands for biodata (résumé), horoscope, and photograph; &quot;veg&quot; means vegetarian; and VF is the abbreviation for very fair (light-skinned).

== Crimes ==
Theft, fraud, and seduction were the crimes most common with matrimonial ads. By 1900, most jurisdictions in the United States had criminalized seduction, allowed punitive and exemplary damages for breach of promise actions, and increased recognition of common-law marriages, all of which helped reduce some crimes associated with matrimonial ads.

In Sweden, the colloquial saying &quot;sun and spring&quot; () to mean &quot;love fraud&quot; refers to fraudster Karl Vesterberg, who placed personal ads in the early 1900s, signing each with &quot;sol-och-vårande&quot;. The most famous &quot;sun and spring&quot; was , who used personal ads to defraud over a hundred women of money in the 1940s.

The U.S. Postal Service warned consumers of fraudulent activity associated with &quot;lonely hearts clubs&quot; in its 1967 &quot;Mail Fraud&quot; booklet. Some people use personal ads to ask for money, supposedly to travel to meet the other person. The booklet describes one individual who claimed to have a potential fortune in oil claims, needing &quot;only another few thousand dollars&quot; for development. Earning an estimated $50,000 a year through personal ads, he was eventually convicted of mail fraud and sentenced to prison. In one instance, a man placed personal ads in publications throughout the United States, claiming to be a single Asian female, and eventually bilking over 400 men of approximately $280,000. He later pled guilty to mail fraud.

From 2011 to 2016, crimes related to online dating increased by almost 400 percent.

Although murder was more rare than theft and fraud, a number of murderers used personal ads to find potential victims. Notable examples include:
* Belle Gunness was a serial killer with at least 14 victims, active 1884–1908.
* Johann Otto Hoch, also known as the Bluebeard Murderer and the Chicago Bluebeard, was a bigamist and murderer, believed to have killed up to 50 victims, active 1890–1905.
* Béla Kiss was a serial killer in Hungary with at least 24 victims, active between 1900 and 1914.
* Helmuth Schmidt was a suspected serial killer of 1–4+ victims, active 1913–1917.
* Henri Désiré Landru, nicknamed the Bluebeard of Gambais, was a serial killer in France with at least 11 victims, active from 1915 to 1919.
* Eva Brandon Rablen answered a personal ad in 1928 and then poisoned her new husband three days after the wedding, a murder that the &quot;Ogden Standard Examiner&quot; called &quot;the most notorious case of its type&quot;.
* Harry Powers was a serial killer of five victims, active 1927–1931.
* Nannie Doss, was a serial killer of 11 victims, active 1927–1954.
* Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck, dubbed the Lonely Hearts Killers, were a serial killer couple suspected of up to 20 victims, active 1947–1949.
* Harvey Glatman, known as the Lonely Hearts Killer and the Glamour Girl Slayer, was an American serial killer with 3-4 victims, active from 1957 to 1958.

<doc id="822165" wikidata="Q1150391" url="?curid=822165" title="InterSystems Caché">
<text>InterSystems Caché ( ) is a commercial operational database management system from InterSystems, used to develop software applications for healthcare management, banking and financial services, government, and other sectors. Customer software can use the database with object and SQL code. Caché also allows developers to directly manipulate its underlying data structures: hierarchical arrays known as M technology.

==Description==

Internally, Caché stores data in multidimensional arrays capable of carrying hierarchically structured data. These are the same “global” data structures used by the MUMPS programming language, which influenced the design of Caché, and are similar to those used by MultiValue (also known as PICK) systems. In most applications, however, object and/or SQL access methods are used.

Caché ObjectScript, Caché Basic or SQL can be used to develop application business logic. External interfaces include native object binding for C++, Java, EJB, ActiveX, and .NET. Caché supports JDBC and ODBC for relational access. XML and web services are also supported.

Caché Server Pages (CSP) technology allows tag-based creation of web applications that generate dynamic web pages, typically using data from a Caché database. Caché also includes InterSystems Zen, an implementation of AJAX that enables component-based development of rich web applications.

==History==

InterSystems was founded in 1979 to commercialize MUMPS hierarchical databases. It launched Caché in 1997 as its flagship product and at that time ceased further development of its original MUMPS product line.

==Market==
InterSystems claims Caché is the world&#x27;s fastest object database. However, high performance is achieved only for transactional operations that have a significantly hierarchical nature.

This database management system (DBMS) is used as part of hospital patient tracking, electronic medical record and medicine management systems, in products developed by companies such as Epic Systems as well as the VistA system used by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Sungard includes Caché in the AddVantage asset management software to finance industry customers such as banks. Telecommunications vendors BT Group and Vodacom also use Caché.

The DB-Engines website ranked Caché as the most popular object-oriented DBMS every month from March 2013 to January 2023, when it was overtaken by InterSystems IRIS Data Platform.

==Platforms==
Caché runs on Windows, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, macOS and OpenVMS platforms.

<text>SM &quot;U-28&quot; was a Type U 27 U-boat that served in the First World War. It conducted 5 patrols, sinking 40 ships totalling 90,126 GRT.

==Career==
&quot;U-28&quot; was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy on 26 June 1914, with Freiherr Georg-Günther von Forstner (1882-1940) in command.
Commander von Forstner was relieved on 15 June 1916 by Otto Rohrbeck, who was in turn relieved on 5 August by Freiherr von Loe-Degenhart. On 15 January 1917, Georg Schmidt took command.

On 30 July 1915, &quot;U-28&quot; sank the British steamer &quot;Iberian&quot;. According to Commander von Forstner&#x27;s account of the incident, the wreckage remained under the water for about 25 seconds until an explosion sent some of the debris flying up. It is said that along with the debris, a creature described as a &quot;gigantic aquatic animal&quot; resembling a crocodile was seen, which quickly disappeared from sight.

===Sinking===
&quot;U-28&quot;″s final patrol began on 19 August 1917, when it departed from Emden for the Arctic Ocean. On 2 September, at 11:55 am, it encountered the armed English steamer , north-by-northeast of North Cape, Norway. &quot;U-28&quot; scored a torpedo hit, and closed in to finish the steamer with gunfire. The shells detonated &quot;Olive Branch&quot;″s cargo of munitions, which it had been carrying from England to Arkhangelsk, Russia, and the subsequent explosion so badly damaged the nearby U-boat that it sank along with the steamer. All 39 of its crew were lost; some were seen swimming, but were not picked up by &quot;Olive Branch&quot;″s lifeboats.

An alternative description of the event states that when the ammunition detonated, a truck carried as deck cargo was blown into the air and fell from a great height on the U-boat, sinking it.

<text>Marmaris () is a municipality and district of Muğla Province, Turkey. Its area is 906 km2, and its population is 97,818 (2022). It is a port city and tourist resort on the Mediterranean coast, along the shoreline of the Turkish Riviera.

Although Marmaris is known for its honey, its main source of income is international tourism. It is located between two intersecting sets of mountains by the sea, though following a construction boom in the 1980s, little is left of the sleepy fishing village that Marmaris was until the late 20th century. 

As an adjunct to the tourism industry, Marmaris is also a centre for sailing and diving, possessing two major and several smaller marinas. It is a popular wintering location for hundreds of cruising boaters.

Dalaman Airport is an hour&#x27;s drive to the east.

Ferries operate from Marmaris to Rhodes and Symi in Greece.

== Etymology ==
During the period of the Beylik of Menteşe; the city became known as &quot;Marmaris&quot;, a name derived from the Greek &quot;màrmaron&quot; (marble; Turkish: &quot;mermer&quot;), in reference to the rich marble deposits in the region, and the prominent role of the city&#x27;s port in the marble trade.

==History==
=== Antiquity ===
It is not certain when Marmaris was founded but in the 6th century BC the site was known as &quot;Physkos&quot; ( or ) in Greek, also Latinised as &quot;Physcus&quot;. It was in a part of Caria that belonged to Rhodes and contained a magnificent harbour and a grove sacred to Leto.

According to the historian Herodotus, there had been a castle on the site since 3000 BC. The area eventually came under the control of the Persian Empire. In 334 BC, Caria was invaded by Alexander the Great and Physkos Castle was besieged. The town&#x27;s 600 inhabitants realised that they had no chance against the invading army and burned their valuables in the castle before escaping to the hills. Aware of the strategic value of the castle, the invaders repaired the destroyed sections to house a few hundred soldiers before the main army returned home.

=== Ottoman period ===

In the later Middle Ages, Marmaris formed part of the Beylik of Menteşe. Then In the mid-fifteenth century, Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror conquered and united the various tribes and kingdoms of Anatolia and the Balkans, and acquired Constantinople. The Knights of St. John, based in Rhodes, had fought the Ottoman Empire for many years and managed to withstand the onslaughts of Mehmed II too. When Suleiman the Magnificent set out to conquer Rhodes, Marmaris served as a base for the Ottoman navy; Marmaris Castle was rebuilt from scratch in 1522 to accommodate an Ottoman army garrison.

In 1798, Admiral Nelson assembled his fleet in the harbour at Marmaris before setting sail for Egypt and the Battle of the Nile which put an end to Napoleon&#x27;s ambitions in the Mediterranean.

In 1801, a British force of 120 ships under Admiral Keith and 14,000 troops under General Abercromby anchored in the bay for eight weeks, using the time to train and resupply ready their mission to end the French campaign in Egypt and Syria.

=== Modern times ===
Throughout Ottoman rule, Marmaris retained its majority Greek population up until the end of World War I. In the aftermath of the 1919–1922 Greco-Turkish War and the subsequent population exchange, the majority Greek population of Marmaris left for Greece and the town was settled by Turkish migrants from the Balkans. The two Fethiye earthquakes of 1957 almost completely destroyed the city. Only the castle and the historic buildings surrounding it were left undamaged.

Renovation work on the castle started in 1979. Under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture, it was converted into a museum with seven galleries, the largest of them used as an exhibition hall. The courtyard is full of seasonal flowers. Built at the same time as the castle, there is also a small Ottoman caravanserai built by Süleyman&#x27;s mother Ayşe Hafsa Sultan in the bazaar.

There were many forest fires in the early 2020s.

== Tourism ==
Marmaris is now a major package-holiday destination popular in particular with British visitors. Although adjacent İçmeler is theoretically a separate resort, these days the two more or less run into each other.

Most visitors to Marmaris come for the beaches and watersports. There are also popular cruises that take in islands in the surrounding bay, including Sedir Island (Turkish: Sedir Adası), commonly known as Cleopatra&#x27;s Island, which is famous for its soft, white - and now protected - sand. 
Summer visitors can also take day trips to the Greek islands of Symi and Rhodes.
==Archaeology==

In 2018, archaeologists discovered the 2300 year-old pyramid-shaped tomb of the ancient Greek boxer Diagoras near the city of Marmaris. The following words were inscribed on it in Greek: &quot;I will be vigilant at the very top so as to ensure that no coward can come and destroy this grave,&quot; The structure had been believed to be the grave of a saint and was visited by locals seeking answers to their prayers, but once it was realised that it was not a holy site, the mausoleum was looted.

==Natural history==


Nimara Cave is located at the highest point of Heaven Island near Marmaris. Since ancient times, it was used as a place of worship. According to the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, human presence in the cave dated back to 3000 BC but excavations carried out by the Municipality of Marmaris in 2007 pushed this back by almost 12,000 years. Research conducted in the cave revealed the existence of a cult of the Mother Goddess Leto, the mother of God Apollo and Goddess Artemis, in the ancient city of Physkos. Worship took place around the main rock which is surrounded by stone altars in a semi-circle raised about 30 cm from the ground. Offerings in the form of cremations, glass beads, terracotta, and sculptures of Leto were placed on these elevated stones. The cave was also used during the Roman period. 

Nimara Cave was declared a protected area in 1999. It shelters trogloxene butterflies, identical to those living in Fethiye&#x27;s Butterfly Valley ().

The Marmaris peninsula is the westernmost habitat for &quot;Tulipa armena&quot;, which normally grows in Eastern Turkey, Iran, and Transcaucasia at much higher altitudes. The plants may have been introduced during the Ottoman period.

<text>SM &quot;U-32&quot; was a German Type U 31 U-boat of the Imperial German Navy.

Her construction was ordered on 29 March 1912 and her keel was laid down on 8 November 1912 by Germaniawerft of Kiel. She was launched on 28 January 1914 and commissioned on 3 September 1914 under the command of Edgar von Spiegel von und zu Peckelsheim. On 1 February 1916 Spiegel was relieved by Kurt Hartwig who commanded the boat until 16 February 1918 when Karl Albrecht took over. Albrecht commanded her until her loss.

&quot;U-32&quot; conducted 11 patrols, sinking 37 merchant ships totalling and one warship for 14,000 tons. On 9 January 1917, to the East of Malta, &quot;U-32&quot; sank the British pre-dreadnought battleship , with the loss of 15 lives.

==Design==
Type U 31 submarines were double-hulled ocean-going submarines similar to Type 23 and Type 27 subs in dimensions and differed only slightly in propulsion and speed. They were considered very good high sea boats with average manoeuvrability and good surface steering.

&quot;U-32&quot; had an overall length of , her pressure hull was long. The boat&#x27;s beam was (o/a), while the pressure hull measured . Type 31s had a draught of with a total height of . The boats displaced a total of ; when surfaced and when submerged.

&quot;U-32&quot; was fitted with two Germania 6-cylinder two-stroke diesel engines with a total of for use on the surface and two Siemens-Schuckert double-acting electric motors with a total of for underwater use. These engines powered two shafts each with a propeller, which gave the boat a top surface speed of , and when submerged. Cruising range was at on the surface, and at under water. Diving depth was .

The U-boat was armed with four torpedo tubes, two fitted in the bow and two in the stern, and carried 6 torpedoes. Additionally &quot;U-32&quot; was equipped in 1915 with two Uk L/30 deck guns.
The boat&#x27;s complement was 4 officers and 31 enlisted.

==Fate==
On 8 May 1918 north-west of Malta she was shelled and then depth charged by and sunk with all hands, 41 dead.

<text>; pronounced ) is a mountain in the Torridon Hills, in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland. It stands between Loch Torridon and the neighbouring mountain Beinn Eighe. The mountain is a ridge running east–west, with several peaks, and its upper half is made up of many steep rocky terraces. The highest peak is the Munro of Spidean a&#x27; Choire Lèith (&#x27;peak of the grey corrie&#x27;) at high. The other Munro peak is Mullach an Rathain at high.

==Geology==

The mountain is composed of Torridonian sandstone which forms massive near-horizontal strata. They form the numerous terraces that are obvious from afar. The rocks are mainly red and chocolate sandstones, arkoses, flagstones and shales with coarse conglomerates locally at the base. Some of the materials of these rocks were derived from the underlying Lewisian gneiss, upon the uneven surface of which they rest, but the bulk of the material was obtained from rocks that are nowhere now exposed. Upon this ancient denuded land surface the Torridonian strata rest horizontally or with gentle inclination. Some of the peaks, such as Beinn Eighe, are capped with white quartzite, giving them a distinctive appearance when seen from afar. Some of the quartzite contains fossilized worm burrows and is known as &quot;pipe rock&quot;. It is about 500 million years old. The Torridon landscape is itself highly denuded by glacial and alluvial action, and represents the remnants of an ancient peneplain.

==Climbing==



Liathach has four listed &quot;Tops&quot; in the Munro Tables, Meall Dearg at 3133 feet (955 m) stands off the main ridge at the end of the Northern Pinnacles which run north from Mullach an Rathain. The route along the Northern Pinnacles is considered a rock climb, although another route to the top from Coire na Caime only involves a short steep scramble on the final 50m to gain the ridge. Irvine Butterfield considers Meall Dearg &quot;The most difficult top in the British Isles challenged only by the Inaccessible Pinnacle of Sgùrr Dearg&quot;. The Northern Pinnacles were first climbed in 1894 by Hinxman, Rennie and Douglas.

Climbing the mountain including both of the above peaks is a challenging expedition; the intervening ridge is for the most part a series of rocky pinnacles known as &quot;Am Fasarinen&quot; (&quot;The Teeth&quot;), which reaches a height of 927 metres at the western end and is considered a Munro &quot;top&quot;. There are few places on the ridge for descent, so once committed, the walker has little choice but to complete the entire ridge walk. The pinnacles can however be avoided by means of a narrow path that traverses the ridge on the south side. The path is very exposed, and there is much erosion at points where it crosses any of a series of gullies. In winter the traverse of Liathach becomes an even more serious expedition.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-32&quot; was a Type VIIA U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II.

Her keel was laid down on 15 March 1936 by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen as yard number 913. She was launched on 25 February 1937 and commissioned on 15 April with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Werner Lott in command. On 15 August 1937, Lott was relieved by &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Paul Büchel, and on 12 February 1940, &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Hans Jenisch took over. He was in charge of the boat until her loss.

==Design==
As one of the first ten German Type VII submarines later designated as Type VIIA submarines, &quot;U-32&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 6 V 40/46 four-stroke, six-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two BBC GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-32&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), eleven torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and an anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.

==Service history==
&quot;U-32&quot; conducted nine patrols, sinking 20 ships, for a total of and damaging five more, totalling and 8,000 tons. On 28 October 1940 &quot;U-32&quot;, under the command of Hans Jenisch, sank the 42,348 GRT liner , which had previously been damaged by two 250 kg (550 lb) bombs from a German Focke-Wulf C 200 &quot;Condor&quot; long-range bomber, commanded by &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Bernhard Jope. &quot;Empress&quot; was the largest ship sunk by a U-boat.

==Fate==
&quot;U-32&quot; was sunk northwest of Ireland, in position , by depth charges from the British destroyers and on 30 October 1940. Nine crew members were killed; 33 survived and became prisoners of war, including Jenisch. Jenisch then spent six and a half years in British captivity before returning to Germany in June 1947.

<text>Westmoreland County Community College is a public community college in Youngwood, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1970 during an era of community college proliferation within the state. Its location on the suburban fringe was designed to attract students from both the Westmoreland County suburbs of Pittsburgh and the Monongahela Valley, then a still booming industrial center. The college has also extended its outreach to provide services to students from Fayette and Indiana Counties.

==History==
Westmoreland County Community College, founded in 1970, first offered evening classes at Jeannette High School in 1971. By the fall of 1972, the college took up a permanent residence in a former Westinghouse plant in Youngwood and expanded its schedule to include day classes.

In the four decades since, Westmoreland&#x27;s original campus in Youngwood has expanded to four buildings. The college has opened additional centers in other areas: the Murrysville Education Center in Export, Fayette County Education Center in Uniontown, Indiana County Center in Indiana, Latrobe Education Center, New Kensington Education Center and Public Safety Training Center in Smithton.

Westmoreland currently offers 64 associate degree programs, 13 diploma options and 49 certificate programs to prepare students for careers or transfer to baccalaureate degree programs at a four-year institution.

<doc id="822200" wikidata="Q1680386" url="?curid=822200" title="James Fisher (naturalist)">
<text>James Maxwell McConnell Fisher (3 September 1912 – 25 September 1970) was a British author, editor, broadcaster, naturalist and ornithologist. He was also a leading authority on Gilbert White and made over 1,000 radio and television broadcasts on natural history subjects.

==Early life==

Fisher was the son of Kenneth Fisher (also a keen ornithologist and headmaster of Oundle School from 1922 to 1945); his maternal uncle was the Cheshire naturalist Arnold Boyd. He was educated at Eton, and began studying medicine at Magdalen College, Oxford, but later switched to zoology. He took part in the Oxford Arctic expedition in 1933 as ornithologist.

==Career==
After university he joined London Zoo as an assistant curator, and during the war studied rooks for the Ministry of Agriculture. He later became a leading member of the RSPB and IUCN, a member of the National Parks Commission and vice-chairman of the Countryside Commission. Fisher presented the BBC Radio series &quot;Birds In Britain&quot; from its inception in March 1951 until its end, twelve years later.

Fisher was one of the members of the small party that on 18 September 1955 raised the Union Flag and took official possession for the UK of the tiny, uninhabited, rocky islet of Rockall, in the North Atlantic.

As well as writing his own books, he was an editor of Collins&#x27; New Naturalist series. He was the resident ornithologist in the regular &quot;Nature Parliament&quot; series broadcast in the 1950s on BBC radio as part of Children&#x27;s Hour. It is likely that his writing and broadcasting played a significant role in the growth of interest in birdwatching in the United Kingdom in the post-Second World War period.

He was awarded the British Trust for Ornithology&#x27;s Bernard Tucker Medal in 1966.

==Personal life==
He was married to Margery Lilian Edith Turner, and they had six children, including the publisher Edmund Fisher. James Fisher died in a car crash on 25 September 1970, aged 58.

==Legacy==
After Fisher&#x27;s death he was commemorated in two ways. A public appeal allowed the seabird island of Copinsay, Orkney, to be purchased as a permanent nature reserve dedicated to his name. His papers were subsequently purchased by Bruce Coleman and John Burton, and presented to The National Archives.

<doc id="822207" wikidata="Q4087468" url="?curid=822207" title="Battle of Sandwich (1460)">
<text>The Battle of Sandwich was a naval skirmish off the town of Sandwich on the 15 January 1460 during the Wars of the Roses. In it, Sir John Dynham, Sir John Wenlock, and the Earl of Warwick, Captain of Calais, on the Yorkist side, defeated a Lancastrian fleet and captured several of its ships. Little evidence and few details of the battle survive.

== Background ==
The port town of Sandwich, (it is now inland but historically faced the sea until the silting up of Wantsum Channel) was one of the Cinque Ports in the 15th century. It had historically served as one of the major landing and embarkation points from and to France.

==Battle==
Edward, Earl of March and Richard, Earl of Salisbury, had fled to the English stronghold of Calais after their defeat at the Battle of Ludford Bridge.

Sent ahead by Warwick, Sir John Dynham found the king&#x27;s fleet lying at Sandwich. Arriving at dawn, Dynham launched an attack while the king&#x27;s officers were still in bed. His success was so overwhelming that he &quot;tooke the principall shippes of the Kynge&#x27;s navie... well furnished with ordinaunce and artillarie&quot;.

==Aftermath==
With command of the English Channel secured by this battle, a small Yorkist army of about two thousand men landed in Kent from Calais ahead of March and Warwick. Once the town of Sandwich itself had been secured by his forces in June 1460, Warwick landed there with March and Salisbury on 26 June 1460. Having cleared the Channel of French pirates (who had been able to raid the town thanks to the chaos caused in England by the civil war) and having made the coast of Kent safe, Warwick was received in Kent as a hero. The French meanwhile aided the Lancastrians a year later.

Warwick&#x27;s army soon increased in numbers, joined by many new recruits, and was largely well supported as it proceeded by way of Canterbury and probably Wickhambreaux. The Yorkist commanders had remained popular in Kent, and the officers in charge of protecting the county against them even joined forces with the rebels. The growing army then marched on London, where it arrived on 2 July to be welcomed by William Hulin, Lord Mayor of London, and Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury. The Yorkist army then marched towards Northampton to meet Henry VI and his Lancastrian army, and the two forces met at the Battle of Northampton on 10 July.

The ladder track is made of unpowered Litz wire cables, and the laminated track is made out of stacked copper or aluminium sheets.

There are three designs: Inductrack I, which is optimized for high-speed operation, Inductrack II, which is more efficient at lower speeds, and Inductrack III, which is intended for heavy loads at low speed.

Inductrack (or Inductrak) was invented by a team of scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, headed by physicist Richard F. Post, for use in maglev trains, based on technology used to levitate flywheels. At constant velocity, power is required only to push the train forward against air and electromagnetic drag. Above a minimum speed, as the velocity of the train increases, the levitation gap, lift force and power used are largely constant. The system can lift 50 times the magnet weight.

== Description ==
The name &quot;inductrack&quot; comes from the word &quot;inductance&quot; or &quot;inductor&quot;; an electrical device made from loops of wire. As a Halbach magnet array passes over the loops of wire, the sinusoidal variations in the field induce a voltage in the track coils. At low speeds, the loops are a largely resistive impedance, and hence the induced currents are highest where the field is changing most quickly, which is around the &quot;least&quot; intense parts of the field, thus little lift is produced.

However, at speed, the impedance of the coils increases, proportionate to speed, and dominates the composite impedance of the coil assemblies. This delays the phase of the current peak so that induced current in the track tends more closely to coincide with the field peaks of the magnet array. The track thus creates its own magnetic field which lines up with and repels the permanent magnets, creating the levitation effect. The track is well modeled as an array of series RL circuits.

When neodymium–iron–boron permanent magnets are used, levitation is achieved at low speeds. The test model levitated at speeds above , but Richard Post believes that, on real tracks, levitation could be achieved at &quot;as little as &quot;. Below the transition speed the magnetic drag increases with vehicle speed; above the transition speed, the magnetic drag &quot;de&quot;creases with speed. For example, at the lift to drag ratio is 200:1, far higher than any aircraft but much lower than classic steel on steel rail which reaches 1000:1 (rolling resistance). This occurs because the inductive impedance increases proportionately with speed which compensates for the faster rate of change of the field seen by the coils, thus giving a constant current flow and power consumption for the levitation.

The Inductrack II variation uses two Halbach arrays, one above and one below the track, to double the magnetic field without substantially increasing the weight or area of the arrays, while also reducing drag at low speeds.

Several maglev railroad proposals are based upon Inductrack technology. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is also considering Inductrack technology for launching space planes.

General Atomics is developing Inductrack technology in cooperation with multiple research partners.

=== Evolution of InducTrack ===
Depending the application, lift to drag ratio at low speed or higher speed are favored. The three variation of the Inductrack are designed for different purposes. The Inductrack I was designed for high-speed trains. The lift-to-drag ratio lowers while speed increases. The Inductrack II has more capabilities of levitation at relatively low speed for use in individual (PRT) or urban transport and uses a cantilevered track. The InducTrack III is designed for high load and cargo with track only partly cantilevered to sustain high loads.

=== Damping ===
There is no active damping and the damping is only provided by the geometry of the track. Tests have shown that low-frequency oscillations (1 Hz) occur and a US patent for mechanically damping the track itself (on Inductrack II) was issued (7478598). The track is cut in segments and each segment is mechanically dampened.

=== Applications ===
Hyperloop Transportation Technologies announced in March 2016 that they would be using passive Inductrack systems for their titular Hyperloop.

<text>Méribel () is a ski resort in the Tarentaise Valley in the French Alps. Méribel refers to three neighbouring villages in the Les Allues commune of the Savoie department of France, near the town of Moûtiers (), called Méribel Centre, Méribel-Mottaret and Méribel Village. The villages are within Vanoise National Park and a part of the Les Trois Vallées interlinked ski system.

Méribel Les Allues is a ski resort that was developed adjacent to the traditional hamlet of Morel, with its centre situated at about 1400 metres above sea level. It was founded by a Scotsman, Major Peter Lindsay, who was looking for a new site for winter sports away from the ski resorts of Austria and Germany, because of the growing strength of the Nazi regime. In 1936, he visited the town of Les Allues for the first time. He then imagined how the town could become a ski resort. Firstly, he decided to create a property company in order to develop finances strong enough to build the resort. In 1938, the first lift was placed above Les Allues. A year later, he began the construction of the first chalets and hotels in the hamlet of Méribel. Three years later, the war would stop the development of the resort, but when it was over, development continued. Now a Colonel, Peter Lindsay used specialised architects, Paul Grillo (Grand Prix de Rome in 1937) and his partner Christian Durupt, so that all buildings would be in harmony with the Savoyard style, using wood and stone for the walls, with slanted slate roofs. In 1950, the Burgin-Saulire gondola was built to link the resort to Courchevel. Lindsay&#x27;s family continue to hold a financial stake in the resort. Lindsay&#x27;s ashes and those of his wife are scattered on the Burgin mountain.

Méribel was a subsite and hosted some events of the 1992 Winter Olympics hosted by nearby Albertville. The resort host the ice hockey and the women&#x27;s alpine skiing events. Until 2011, Méribel was the host to the Altitude Festival, with acts such as KT Tunstall, Marcus Brigstocke and Omid Dijalili performing in the bars and nightclubs around the resort. For 2011, it has been announced that the festival will be moved to Austria, with the organiser Richard Lett citing a reduction in support from the Méribel Tourist Office.

The ski resort is part of the Trois Vallées ski area. The Three Valleys area comprises 180 lifts, 335 marked runs (over 600 kilometres) and over 130 km of cross-country tracks. The Three Valleys was expanded in 1996 to incorporate a fourth valley, though the area kept the name Trois Vallées. The area comprises the resorts of Courchevel, La Tania, Méribel, Les Menuires-Saint Martin, Val Thorens and Orelle.

The resort comprises the sub-villages of: Méribel-Mottaret, at an altitude of 1,750 m towards the head of the Allues Valley—served by the Plattiers gondola which provides access to neighbouring resorts Les Menuires and Val Thorens; Raffort and La Gittaz, which are served by the Meribel Olympic Gondola; Chandon, which has free bus access to resort; and Méribel Village at 1,400 m on the road to Courchevel 1850 at the bottom of the Lapin piste and start of the Golf Chair to the popular beginners skiing area The Altiport.

Past projects

*For the 2012 season, the Burgin-Saulire 2 gondola is being replaced, and the new lift will be called Saulire Express 2. It will be constructed by Poma, and will take a new route up the Méribel Couloir, arriving at the same position as the Saulire cable car from the Courchevel side.
*For the 2013 season, the Burgin-Saulire 1 gondola is being replaced, and the new lift will be called Saulire Express 1. It will be constructed by Poma, and will be joined to Saulire Express 2 for a continuous journey up the mountain, first gondola station in France MULTIX to sections decoupled amount of work 24 million. 
*Plattieres 1 &amp; 2 are being replaced by a new gondola constructed by Poma, called Plattieres 1. This new lift will cut the journey time from 25 minutes to 9 minutes, and the new cabins will replace the old six seat, back to back gondolas with more comfortable 10 seat cabins. Construction will begin at the end of the 2011 season, and the old lift will continue to run through the 2012 season.

==Tarentaise Valley skiing==
The Tarentaise Valley has the biggest concentration of world-class ski resorts in the world. Most well known neighbour systems are Paradiski (Les Arcs, La Plagne) and Espace Killy (Val-d&#x27;Isère and Tignes). A weekly lift ticket in Méribel/Les Trois Vallées offers a choice to ski one day in each of the other two systems mentioned. There were once plans to interlink all systems and resorts to create the - by far - largest ski area in the world. However that vision was ended with the creation of the Vanoise National Park.

<doc id="822220" wikidata="Q217000" url="?curid=822220" title="Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters">
<text>The Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, commonly abbreviated as the DTM, is a sports car racing series sanctioned by ADAC. The series is based in Germany, with rounds elsewhere in Europe. The series currently races a modified version of Group GT3 grand touring cars, replacing silhouette later Class 1 touring cars in 2021.

From 2000 to 2020, the &quot;new DTM&quot; continued the former Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (German Touring Car Championship) and ITC (International Touring Car Championship) which had been discontinued after 1996 due to high costs. The series raced prototype silhouette racing cars based on a mass-production road car in the same period.

The second iteration went by the full name during its first five years. Since 2005, all official documents only refer to it by the abbreviated name.

==History==
===Background===

During the ITC era, a large proportion of the revenue generated by the championship went to the FIA, which led to complaints from the teams regarding the small return on their increasingly large investment in the high-tech touring car series. Since 1997, many ideas had been discussed in order to find a compromise for the rules of a new DTM racing series. Opel put the primary emphasis on cost control, Mercedes-Benz supported expensive development in competition, BMW wanted an international series rather than one focused on Germany only, while Audi insisted on allowing their trademark quattro four-wheel drive system (despite running the rear wheel drive Audi R8 in sports car racing).

The DTM returned in 2000 as Mercedes and Opel had agreed to use cars that were based on the concept car that was shown by Opel on various occasions (e.g. the 1999 24 Hours Nürburgring where Opel celebrated its 100th anniversary). The series adopted the format of the 1995 championship, with most rounds held in Germany and occasional rounds throughout Europe, but having learnt the lessons of the ITC format, the ITR constantly made efforts to keep costs in the revived series from exploding to unreasonable levels, and to keep the championship firmly tied to its German roots. As too many races were initially planned outside Germany, no Championship (Meisterschaft) status was granted by the DMSB, and the DTM initials now stand for Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (German Touring Car Masters).

Unlike the previous incarnation, which primarily used saloon models like the Mercedes-Benz W201, the new DTM featured only 2-door coupés. Opel used the upcoming Coupé version of the Astra as in the concept car, and Mercedes used the CLK model which was already used as the basis for the Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR GT1-class sports car.

The motorsport arm of the Bavarian tuning company Abt Sportsline was allowed to enter on short notice. Abt used the Audi TT as a basis for a DTM car, as Audi had no suitable 2-door coupé in its model lineup at the time, even though the dimensions of the car did not fit into the rules of the series. This also meant that the 1999 STW-Supertouring-champion Christian Abt could not defend his STW title as this series was also discontinued, with Opel then moving into DTM.

===2000–2003===
In May 2000, the new DTM started with the traditional Hockenheimring round on the short course. Some cars competing in the race had no or few sponsorship decals. While Opel&#x27;s cars could match the speed of most Mercedes cars in the 2000 season, the hastily developed Abt-Audi ended up outclassed. As the body shape of the TT had rather poor aerodynamic properties, Abt was allowed to use a version with a stretched wheelbase and bodyshell in later years. Further dispensation was also granted, such as increased rear wing height, which helped the Abt-Audi TT-R win the DTM championship in 2002 with Laurent Aïello.

In 2002, the DTM also introduced the HANS device to increase driver safety and reduce injuries from accidents.
In 2000, Manuel Reuter came second in the championship. After that year, no Opel driver was among the top three in the overall championship, with few podium finishes and no victories for the disappointing &quot;lightnings&quot;. On the other hand, it was Opel team boss Volker Strycek who brought a new highlight to the fans, by racing a modified DTM car on the old version of the Nürburgring in 2002, 20 years after the top classes had moved to the modern Grand Prix track, and ten years after the old DTM stopped racing there. The Opels did not win in many of their race entries in the VLN endurance racing series, as they were mainly testing, but the speed was said to be impressive, and the fans loved it. However, they won the 2003 Nürburgring 24 Hours against factory efforts by Audi, who also ran a DTM-spec TT and BMW, who ran an ALMS-spec M3.

===2004—2006===
After their successes with the Audi R8 and the official support of the Abt-TT-Rs at the Nürburgring, Audi finally joined the DTM as a factory entrant in 2004. The three constructors involved decided to switch to D-segment compact executive-based saloon bodies. The road models used as patterns since 2004 are the Audi A4, Opel Vectra GTS and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. All dimensions, like the wheelbase, are identical in order to provide equal opportunities without the actual design of the road cars having any influence. Audi immediately had success in 2004 with Swedish driver Mattias Ekström, now a long-time veteran of the sport, becoming a DTM series champion for the first time.

The championship suffered a setback in 2004 when long-time entrant Opel decided to pull out of the series at the end of the 2005 season, as part of a large cost-cutting operation in General Motors European division. Initially, the gap looked set to be filled by MG Rover, however their plans to enter the series were canceled after the company collapsed in April 2005. As a result, Audi and Mercedes ended up fielding 10 cars each in 2006, but the television deal with the major German television station ARD required three marques to participate in 2007 in order to continue the broadcast agreement.

===2007–2013===
The DTM carried on with only two manufacturers in spite of the television agreement requiring three manufacturers to participate in the series. The 2007–2009 seasons were marked by the dominance of Audi. Swede Mattias Ekström won the second of his two titles in 2007, and Timo Scheider took the driver&#x27;s championship in the following two years. Mercedes-Benz were in the runner-up positions in both 2008 and 2009 (Paul di Resta in 2008 and Gary Paffett in 2009). In 2010, Mercedes finally bridged the gap to Audi, as di Resta won the 2010 championship driving for AMG-Mercedes.

In 2011 and 2012, the DTM held a Race of Champions-style exhibition event in the Munich Olympic Stadium.

In 2012 BMW made a return to the series after a twenty-year absence, and won the drivers, teams, and manufacturers titles. 2012 also marked the return of three-car manufacturers since 2005 season as well as two-door D-segment compact executive coupé style since 2003 season.

Audi switched from the A4 to the A5 in 2012 and to the RS5 in 2013. In 2013, the Drag Reduction System identical to the system used in Formula 1 was introduced by ITR to improve racing in DTM.

===2014–2020===
In 2014, the body shape and aerodynamic pieces of all DTM cars were modified to improve racing. The double-header races (Saturday and Sunday races) were also revived in 2015, thus switching from races with total laps run to timed races. The qualifying format was also reformatted into a single-session timed qualification (similar to the Formula One qualifying format used from 1996 to 2002), but DTM only run a single 20-minute qualifying session for Saturday and Sunday races. Performance weights were also introduced to determine the winning car&#x27;s weight.

In 2017, the DTM field size was reduced from 24 to 18 cars total to improve quality as well as increasing affordability for its existing manufacturers, while making the series a more attractive proposition for any prospective entrants and manufacturers.

For the 2019 season, turbocharged engines were reintroduced to the series for the first time since 1989 (see article below for full story). Mercedes left the series following the conclusion of the 2018 season, but R-Motorsport joined the series in 2019 to run four Aston Martin-branded cars, although they would withdraw after a single season that did not yield competitive results. The 2019 season also saw the three Super GT GT500 manufacturers – Honda, Lexus and Nissan – each field a guest entry at the final race of the season, before entries from both series would compete at the non-championship Super GT x DTM Dream Race held at Fuji Speedway in Japan.

===2021–present===
The 2021 season switched to a GT3-based regulation otherwise known as GT Plus. The Class 1 cars were replaced in order to attract more manufacturers to the series.

==International expansion==
===DTM–Super GT unification===

In March 2010, The GT Association (the governing body of the Super GT series in Japan) initially announced that the ITR were beginning to align the technical regulations with Super GT&#x27;s GT500 class and NASCAR&#x27;s Grand American Road Racing Association Grand Touring division to form a new Grand Touring specification. In October 2012, a cooperation agreement between DTM and Super GT was signed in Berlin. The agreement regarding the use of the &#x27;New DTM&#x27; regulations by Japan&#x27;s Super GT began in 2014 and ran for four years. DTM moved away from its previous 4.0-litre V8 specification in favour of 2.0-litre turbos in 2019, which Super GT had implemented in 2014.

===NASCAR Holdings / IMSA===
On 27 March 2013, the ITR and NASCAR Holdings road racing division, the International Motor Sports Association announced a North American DTM series that was scheduled to start between 2015 and 2016 based on the 2014 DTM/Class 1 regulations. As of 2019, a North American DTM series has yet to run, despite interest being shown by the North American sanctioning body to run DTM/Class 1, either as a series under IMSA sanction or possible integration into the sports car championship as a potential replacement for the GTLM/GTE class in 2022. The initial 2013 agreement to run a North American DTM Series was signed by IMSA&#x27;s predecessor, Grand-Am Road Racing and did not take into account the subsequent merger of the sanctioning body with the rival sports car championship American Le Mans Series in 2014 to form the United SportsCar Championship, now known as the IMSA SportsCar Championship.

==Race format==
When the DTM series returned, it used a similar format to the final season of the former DTM in 1996: two races of 100 kilometres, with a short break between them. In 2001 and 2002 there was a short race of 35 kilometres as well as a long race of 100 kilometres, which included one pit stop and points scored for the top 10 as in earlier seasons. From 2003 to 2014 there was only one race, which had a distance of about 250 kilometres, and two mandatory pit stops.

For the 2015 season a new race format was introduced. Race weekend consisted of 40-minute (Saturday) and 60-minute (Sunday) races. On Saturday&#x27;s race a pit stop was optional, while on Sunday&#x27;s race a pit stop was mandatory and all the four tyres had to be changed. Both races had the same scoring system.

In the 2017 season, both races of the weekend featured the same distance – 55 minutes plus a complete lap, with one race being held on Saturday, the other on Sunday. In both races, the drivers had to pit at least once for a set of fresh tyres. For the 2019 season the time limited race format was abolished and the series reverted to the fixed lap race format that was last used in 2014. However, after the opening round of the 2019 season, the series reverted the 55-minute plus one lap distance format due to issues with television broadcasts running longer than expected.

==DTM drivers==

The drivers have been a mixture of young and older drivers, including well known former Formula One drivers David Coulthard, Bernd Schneider, Allan McNish, Jean Alesi, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher, JJ Lehto, Pedro Lamy, Karl Wendlinger, Emanuele Pirro, Stefano Modena, two-time F1 world champion Mika Häkkinen and former F1 2008 Canadian Grand Prix winner Robert Kubica. Others, such as Laurent Aïello, Tom Kristensen, Dindo Capello, Frank Biela, Marco Werner, Lucas Luhr, Alexandre Prémat, Yves Olivier, Jaroslav Janiš, and Alain Menu have made their career racing in sports cars and touring cars.

The DTM is also increasingly being used by young drivers such as Robert Wickens and Gary Paffett to jump-start their racing career in single-seaters. Wickens was in the 2012 Mercedes young driver program and in his first year of DTM. This strategy appears to have worked well for Christijan Albers, who built a reputation by finishing second and third in the 2003 and 2004 championships with Mercedes-Benz and then graduated to Formula One in 2005. He came back in 2008, but this time driving for Audi. After winning the championship in 2010, Paul di Resta raced from 2011 until 2013 for Mercedes-engined Formula One team Force India. He has now returned to the Mercedes DTM team. Pascal Wehrlein, who has won the championship in a Mercedes car in 2015 went on to race for Sauber F1 Team and was a test driver for the Mercedes F1 team.

Gary Paffett has also used his championship win to gain a test with McLaren, and they signed him as permanent test driver for 2006. This prevented Paffett from defending his title in 2006, however he thought that it will be a springboard for a race seat during the 2007 Formula One season. The plan failed however, and Paffett returned to DTM in 2007, but in a 2006 specification car.

Four female drivers have taken part in the championship. In 2006 Vanina Ickx started racing for Audi and Susie Stoddart (later Wolff) in 2011 for Mercedes. In 2008 Ickx was replaced by Katherine Legge, who was subsequently replaced for the 2011 season by Rahel Frey.

==Cars, technology and specifications (silhouette touring car racing all eras)==
===Vehicle, chassis===

Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars closely resemble public road vehicles but custom-built into a racing version as a reference of silhouette racing car format. The championship controls and specifies the chassis/car and engine manufacturers that teams are allowed to use each season. The league&#x27;s choice of manufacturers are changed every year. Opel provided cars and Spiess engines in 2000–2005 with two different models (Astra in 2000–2003 later Vectra GTS V8 in 2004–2005). Opel ended its DTM program after the 2005 season, citing costs and company restructuring. Aston Martin provided the cars to R-Motorsport team in 2019, but left DTM after the 2020 season unable to secure an engine supplier.

In 2000, Mercedes-Benz AMG came to the new DTM from the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Mercedes-Benz won their first race in 1st Hockenheimring round, as well as the series title. In July 2017, Mercedes-Benz AMG company officials announced the company&#x27;s withdrawal from German touring car racing after 2018 season and the immediate discontinuation of its DTM program, coinciding with its entrance into FIA Formula E Championship in 2019, and its discontinuation of its DMSB program.

During the first inaugural resumption season, all DTM car styles were utilized shorter S-segment compact sports two-door coupé-style cars until 2003 season but in 2004 coupé-style cars were minority due to the transition to four-door sedan saloon-style cars. In 2004 the four-door sedan saloon-style cars were introduced due to touring car racing&#x27;s core philosophy (several touring car racing tournaments have a &quot;de facto&quot; 4-door sedan saloon cars) until 2011. For 2012 season onwards the two-door coupé-style s were returned until 2020 but the two-door coupé-style cars are much more different than 2000–2003 cars (longer length, longer wheelbase, slightly lower height and aggressive aero package as based on compact D-segment compact executive cars). The updated new coupé-style cars were introduced in 2017 thanks to new rear wing.

The cars are supposed to be fast and spectacular, while still fairly cheap to build and run. All DTM race cars have RWD and 4.0-litre V8 engines (later 2.0-litre inline-4 turbocharged engines) which are air-restricted to 460 hp but now into over 500 hp since 2017 until 2018 season and now into 610 hp including 30 hp push-to-pass since 2019 season and later 580 hp + 60 hp push-to-pass since 2020 season onwards, no matter if similar layouts or engines are available in the road cars. Instead of the road car bodies, unrelated purpose-built chassis are used, which are closer to prototype racing. Many drivers have in fact described the handling of the cars as closer to single seater racing cars than road cars. Only the roof sections of the road cars are put on top of the roll cages, and lights and other distinctive design features are used in order to provide a resemblance to the road cars. Also, in order to save money and provide close racing, many common parts from third party specialists are used, like transmission (from Hewland), brakes (from AP Racing), wheels (from ATS) and Hankook tyres (see below). The all-important aerodynamic configurations are tested in wind tunnels before the season, brought to an equal level, and kept that way throughout the season.

DTM cars adhere to a front engine rear-wheel-drive design (similar to public legal road car). A roll cage serves as a space frame chassis, covered by CFRP crash elements on the side, front and rear and covered by metallic bodywork. They have a closed cockpit, a bi-plane rear wing, and other aerodynamic parts such as front splitter, side winglets and hood holes (see also on Aerodynamics section for more details).

The price of one current DTM car is normally €600,000-€5,000,000.

====Aerodynamics====
All Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars aero packages are completely assembled. The car floor underbody is flat. Serratured side front fenders are included along with triple-decker front side winglet flicks, multiple side winglet flicks and multiple rear winglet flicks. The 2017–2018 generation of rear wing for all Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars are slightly wider, bi-plane wing and also parallelogram rear wing end plate. Since 2019 season onwards, the new generation of rear wings are wider than 2012–2018 generation of rear wing, single-plane wing and uniquely shaped rear wing plate. DTM cars have included a Drag Reduction System since the 2013 season (similar to Formula One) for helping the driver to overtake.

The HYLO (High Yaw Lift-Off) aerodynamic safety is integrated on the rear wing for all Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars started form 2020 season onwards.

====Tyres====

Previously Hankook and Dunlop were the tyre partner and supplier of DTM from 2000 to 2010 seasons (Dunlop) and 2011 to 2020 seasons (Hankook), carrying the SP Sport Maxx (Dunlop 2000–2010) and Ventus (Hankook 2011–2020) brands respectively. The DTM runs the bespoke compounds and same size as LMP and GT cars since 2000 and re-profiled in 2012. The current front tyre sizes are 300/680-R18 (11.8/26.8-R18) and the rear tyre sizes are 320/700-R18 (12.6/27.9-R18) (previously front tyre sizes were 240/650-R18 (9.45/25.6-R18) and the rear tyre sizes were 280/660-R18 (11.0/25.6-R18) in 2000–2003 later front tyre sizes were 265/660-R18 (10.4/25.9-R18) and the rear tyre sizes were 280/660-R18 (11.0/25.9-R18) in 2004–2010 and later front tyre sizes were 260/660-R18 (10.2/25.9-R18) and the rear tyre sizes were 280/660-R18 (11.0/25.9-R18) in 2011). The compounds of Hankook Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters tyres are currently only one dry slick compound (standard prime hard) and one wet treaded compound (full-wet only). Option tyres were used as a soft compound in 2013–2014 seasons.

===Performance===
According to research and pre-season stability tests, the pre-2019 model can go 0 to 100 km/h in approximately 2.6 seconds. The car had a top speed of meaning that it is the second fastest touring car behind the Australian V8 Supercars.

Since DTM switched from traditional classic electronic indirect-injected V8 naturally aspirated engines to fuel-efficient direct-injected inline-4 turbocharged engines since 2019 season, the current model can go 0 to 100 km/h in approximately 2.8 seconds and now has a top speed of and thus outperforming Australian Supercars top speed (Albeit, DTM cars use 102 RON fuel compared with Australian Supercars using E85 fuel. A fair comparison would be both series cars using the same fuel type).

====Balance of Performance====
In 2015, Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters introduced a Balance of Performance (BoP) system to improve racing spectacle. The Balance of Performance (BoP) weight regulations specified a car weight allowance range between in 2015–2016, later changed to from the mid-2017 season, in effect being closer to success ballast system used in British Touring Car Championship and Super GT despite the name. The Balance of Performance (BoP) weight regulations were scrapped just before the Austrian race due to several protests and criticisms from DTM teams.

===Prohibitions===
Driver aids like ABS, traction control, launch control, active suspension, cockpit-adjustable anti-roll bar and partial car-to-team radio communications are currently prohibited except fuel mapping and Drag Reduction Systems, which can only be used for 12 laps in 2018 when near enough.

===Driver safety===
The safety is very important for all DTM drivers. Drivers are required to wear a race suit, Nomex underwear, gloves, socks, boots and headsocks in the DTM. Meanwhile, the helmets for all DTM drivers are made of carbon-fibre shell, lined with energy-absorbing foam and Nomex padding. The helmet type must meet or exceed FIA 8860-2010 certification approval as a homologation for all auto racing drivers. HANS device are required to be worn by DTM drivers since the 2002 season that meets or exceeds FIA 8858-2010 certification approval. Earpieces are also required by DTM drivers to improve communication.

==Further future of DTM (GT3 Pro – 2021 and beyond)==
As Super GT GT500-style &quot;Class 1&quot; format retired after 2020 season due to ruthlessly brutal raising costs, the series will adopt the GT3 Pro from 2021 season onwards. The engine format of new GT3 Pro will no longer mandated instead of free (displacement, shape, number of cylinders and injectors). As a result of GT3 Pro transition, the series will no longer utilize full-factory manufacturer entrants in order to save budgets. Michelin will serve as official tyre partner despite GT3 Pro transition.

The race start format will no longer have standing start with a rolling start being implemented in place.

===Tyres===
Michelin has been the tire partner of the DTM since 2021, carrying the Pilot Sport GT S9M brand.
Pirelli tires have been used since the ADAC took over the DTM.

==Scoring systems==

This is the evolution of DTM points scoring system history since reborn.

2023–present
Additionally, the top three placed drivers in qualifying also received points:
If in the case of a tie, DTM will determine the champion based on the most first-place finishes. If there is still a tie, DTM will determine the champion by the most second-place finishes, then the most third-place finishes, etc., until a champion is determined. DTM will apply the same system to other ties in the rankings at the close of the season and at any other time during the season.

<text>Sperm competition is the competitive process between spermatozoa of two or more different males to fertilize the same egg during sexual reproduction. Competition can occur when females have multiple potential mating partners. Greater choice and variety of mates increases a female&#x27;s chance to produce more viable offspring. However, multiple mates for a female means each individual male has decreased chances of producing offspring.
Sperm competition is an evolutionary pressure on males, and has led to the development of adaptations to increase male&#x27;s chance of reproductive success. Sperm competition results in a sexual conflict between males and females. Males have evolved several defensive tactics including: mate-guarding, mating plugs, and releasing toxic seminal substances to reduce female re-mating tendencies to cope with sperm competition. Offensive tactics of sperm competition involve direct interference by one male on the reproductive success of another male, for instance by mate guarding or by physically removing another male&#x27;s sperm prior to mating with a female. For an example, see &quot;Gryllus bimaculatus&quot;.

Sperm competition is often compared to having tickets in a raffle; a male has a better chance of winning (i.e. fathering offspring) the more tickets he has (i.e. the more sperm he inseminates a female with). However, sperm are not free to produce, and as such males are predicted to produce sperm of a size and number that will maximize their success in sperm competition. By making many spermatozoa, males can buy more &quot;raffle tickets&quot;, and it is thought that selection for numerous sperm has contributed to the evolution of anisogamy with very small sperm (because of the energy trade-off between sperm size and number). Alternatively, a male may evolve faster sperm to enable his sperm to reach and fertilize the female&#x27;s ovum first. Dozens of adaptations have been documented in males that help them succeed in sperm competition.

==Defensive adaptations==

Mate-guarding is a defensive behavioral trait that occurs in response to sperm competition; males try to prevent other males from approaching the female (and/or vice versa) thus preventing their mate from engaging in further copulations. Precopulatory and postcopulatory mate-guarding occurs in insects, lizards, birds and primates. Mate-guarding also exists in the fish species &quot;Neolamprologus pulcher&quot;, as some males try to &quot;sneak&quot; matings with females in the territory of other males. In these instances, the males guard their female by keeping her in close enough proximity so that if an opponent male shows up in his territory he will be able to fight off the rival male which will prevent the female from engaging in extra-pair copulation with the rival male.

Organisms with polygynous mating systems are controlled by one dominant male. In this type of mating system, the male is able to mate with more than one female in a community. The dominant males will reign over the community until another suitor steps up and overthrows him. The current dominant male will defend his title as the dominant male and he will also be defending the females he mates with and the offspring he sires. The elephant seal falls into this category since he can participate in bloody violent matches in order to protect his community and defend his title as the alpha male. If the alpha male is somehow overthrown by the newcomer, his children will most likely be killed and the new alpha male will start over with the females in the group so that his lineage can be passed on.

Strategic mate-guarding occurs when the male only guards the female during her fertile periods. This strategy can be more effective because it may allow the male to engage in both extra-pair paternity and within-pair paternity. This is also because it is energetically efficient for the male to guard his mate at this time. There is a lot of energy that is expended when a male is guarding his mate. For instance, in polygynous mate-guarding systems, the energetic costs of males is defending their title as alpha male of their community. Fighting is very costly in regards to the amount of energy used to guard their mate. These bouts can happen more than once which takes a toll on the physical well-being of the male. Another cost of mate-guarding in this type of mating system is the potential increase of the spread of disease. If one male has an STD, he can pass that on to the females that he&#x27;s copulating with, potentially resulting in a depletion of the harem. This would be an energetic cost towards both sexes for the reason that instead of using the energy for reproduction, they are redirecting it towards ridding themselves of this illness. Some females also benefit from polygyny because extra pair copulations in females increase the genetic diversity with the community of that species. This occurs because the male is not able to watch over all of the females and some will become promiscuous.
Eventually, the male will not have proper nutrition, which makes the male unable to produce sperm. For instance, male amphipods will deplete their reserves of glycogen and triglycerides only to have it replenished after the male is done guarding that mate. Also, if the amount of energy intake does not equal the energy expended, then this could be potentially fatal to the male. Males may even have to travel long distances during the breeding season in order to find a female, which significantly drains their energy supply. Studies were conducted to compare the cost of foraging of fish that migrate and animals that are residential. The studies concluded that fish that were residential had fuller stomachs containing higher quality of prey compared to their migrant counterparts. With all of these energy costs that go along with guarding a mate, timing is crucial so that the male can use the minimal amount of energy. This is why it is more efficient for males to choose a mate during their fertile periods. Also, males will be more likely to guard their mate when there is a high density of males in the proximity. Sometimes, organisms put in all this time and planning into courting a mate in order to copulate and she may not even be interested. There is a risk of cuckoldry of some sort, since a rival male can successfully court the female that the male originally courting her could not do.

However, there are benefits that are associated with mate-guarding. In a mate-guarding system, both parties, male and female, are able to directly and indirectly benefit from this. For instance, females can indirectly benefit from being protected by a mate. The females can appreciate a decrease in predation and harassment from other males while being able to observe her male counterpart. This will allow her to recognize particular traits that she finds ideal so that she&#x27;ll be able to find another male that emulates those qualities. In polygynous relationships, the dominant male of the community benefits because he has the best fertilization success. Communities can include 30 up to 100 females and, compared to the other males, will greatly increase his chances of mating success.

Males who have successfully courted a potential mate will attempt to keep them out of sight of other males before copulation. One way organisms accomplish this is to move the female to a new location. Certain butterflies, after enticing the female, will pick her up and fly her away from the vicinity of potential males. In other insects, the males will release a pheromone in order to make their mate unattractive to other males, or to mask her scent completely. The male of certain cricket species will court a female loudly, until she accepts his gesture, when he suddenly becomes silent. Some insects, prior to mating, will assume tandem positions to their mate or position themselves in a way to prevent other males from attempting to mate with that female. The male checkerspot butterfly has developed a clever method in order to attract and guard a mate. He will situate himself near an area that possesses valuable resources that the female needs. He will then drive away any males that come near and this will greatly increase his chances of copulation with any female that comes to that area.

In post-copulatory mate-guarding males are trying to prevent other males from mating with the female that they have mated with already. For example, male millipedes in Costa Rica will ride on the back of their mate letting the other males know that she&#x27;s taken. Japanese beetles will assume a tandem position to the female after copulation. This can last up to several hours allowing him to ward off any rival males giving his sperm a high chance to fertilize that female&#x27;s egg. These, and other, types of methods have the male playing defense by protecting his mate. Elephant seals are known to engage in bloody battles in order to retain their title as dominant male so that they are able to mate with all the females in their community.

Copulatory plugs are frequently observed in insects, reptiles, some mammals, and spiders. Copulatory plugs are inserted immediately after a male copulates with a female, which reduce the possibility of fertilization by subsequent copulations from another male, by physically blocking the transfer of sperm. Bumblebee mating plugs, in addition to providing a physical barrier to further copulations, contain linoleic acid, which reduces re-mating tendencies of females. A species of Sonoran desert &quot;Drosophila&quot;, &quot;Drosophila mettleri&quot;, uses copulatory plugs to enable males to control the sperm reserve space females have available. This behavior ensures males with higher mating success at the expense of female control of sperm (sperm selection).

Similarly, &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; males release toxic seminal fluids, known as ACPs (accessory gland proteins), from their accessory glands to impede the female from participating in future copulations. These substances act as an anti-aphrodisiac causing a dejection of subsequent copulations, and also stimulate ovulation and oogenesis. Seminal proteins can have a strong influence on reproduction, sufficient to manipulate female behavior and physiology.

Another strategy, known as sperm partitioning, occurs when males conserve their limited supply of sperm by reducing the quantity of sperm ejected. In &quot;Drosophila&quot;, ejaculation amount during sequential copulations is reduced; this results in half filled female sperm reserves following a single copulatory event, but allows the male to mate with a larger number of females without exhausting his supply of sperm. To facilitate sperm partitioning, some males have developed complex ways to store and deliver their sperm. In the blue headed wrasse, &quot;Thalassoma bifasciatum&quot;, the sperm duct is sectioned into several small chambers that are surrounded by a muscle that allows the male to regulate how much sperm is released in one copulatory event.

A strategy common among insects is for males to participate in prolonged copulations. By engaging in prolonged copulations, a male has an increased opportunity to place more sperm within the female&#x27;s reproductive tract and prevent the female from copulating with other males.

It has been found that some male mollies (&quot;Poecilia&quot;) have developed deceptive social cues to combat sperm competition. Focal males will direct sexual attention toward typically non-preferred females when an audience of other males is present. This encourages the males that are watching to attempt to mate with the non-preferred female. This is done in an attempt to decrease mating attempts with the female that the focal male prefers, hence decreasing sperm competition.

==Offensive adaptations==
Offensive adaptation behavior differs from defensive behavior because it involves an attempt to ruin the chances of another male&#x27;s opportunity in succeeding in copulation by engaging in an act that tries to terminate the fertilization success of the previous male. This offensive behavior is facilitated by the presence of certain traits, which are called armaments. An example of an armament are antlers. Further, the presence of an offensive trait sometimes serves as a status signal. The mere display of an armament can suffice to drive away the competition without engaging in a fight, hence saving energy. 
A male on the offensive side of mate-guarding may terminate the guarding male&#x27;s chances at a successful insemination by brawling with the guarding male to gain access to the female. In &quot;Drosophila&quot;, males release seminal fluids that contain additional toxins like pheromones and modified enzymes that are secreted by their accessory glands intended to destroy the sperm that have already made their way into the female&#x27;s reproductive tract from a recent copulation. However, this proved to be wrong because &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; seminal fluid can actually protect the sperm of other males. Based on the &quot;last male precedence&quot; idea, some males can remove sperm from previous males by ejaculating new sperm into the female; hindering successful insemination opportunities of the previous male. An example of this behavior is seen in the beetle species &quot;Carabus insulicola&quot; and &quot;Onymacris unguicularis&quot;. In the former, the second male to mate with a female is able to use his hook-like genitalia to dislodge the spermatophore deposited by the previous male to increase his chances of fertilizing the most eggs. In the latter species, the second male&#x27;s spermatophore works to essentially push out the last male&#x27;s spermatophore out of the female&#x27;s body, although it has been shown that not all previous sperm are completely removed.

==Mate choice==
The &quot;good sperm hypothesis&quot; is very common in polyandrous mating systems. The &quot;good sperm hypothesis&quot; suggests that a male&#x27;s genetic makeup will determine the level of his competitiveness in sperm competition. When a male has &quot;good sperm&quot; he is able to father more viable offspring than males that do not have the &quot;good sperm&quot; genes. Females may select males that have these superior &quot;good sperm&quot; genes because it means that their offspring will be more viable and will inherit the &quot;good sperm&quot; genes which will increase their fitness levels when their sperm competes.

Studies show that there is more to determining the competitiveness of the sperm in sperm competition in addition to a male&#x27;s genetic makeup. A male&#x27;s dietary intake will also affect sperm competition. An adequate diet consisting of increased amounts of diet and sometimes more specific ratio in certain species will optimize sperm number and fertility. Amounts of protein and carbohydrate intake were tested for its effects on sperm production and quality in adult fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae). Studies showed these flies need to constantly ingest carbohydrates and water to survive, but protein is also required to attain sexual maturity. In addition, The Mediterranean fruit fly, male diet has been shown to affect male mating success, copula duration, sperm transfer, and male participation in leks. These all require a good diet with nutrients for proper gamete production as well as energy for activities, which includes participation in leks. 

In addition, protein and carbohydrate amounts were shown to have an effect on sperm production and fertility in the speckled cockroach. Holidic diets were used which allowed for specific protein and carbohydrate measurements to be taken, giving it credibility. A direct correlation was seen in sperm number and overall of food intake. More specifically, optimal sperm production was measured at a 1:2 protein to carbohydrate ratio. Sperm fertility was best at a similar protein to carbohydrate ratio of 1:2. This close alignment largely factors in determining male fertility in &quot;Nauphoeta cinerea&quot;. Surprisingly, sperm viability was not affected by any change in diet or diet ratios. It is hypothesized that sperm viability is more affected by the genetic makeup, like in the &quot;good sperm hypothesis&quot;. These ratios and results are not consistent with many other species and even conflict with some. It seems there cannot be any conclusions on what type of diet is needed to positively influence sperm competition but rather understand that different diets do play a role in determining sperm competition in mate choice.

==Evolutionary consequences==
One evolutionary response to sperm competition is the variety in penis morphology of many species. For example, the shape of the human penis may have been selectively shaped by sperm competition. The human penis may have been selected to displace seminal fluids implanted in the female reproductive tract by a rival male. Specifically, the shape of the coronal ridge may promote displacement of seminal fluid from a previous mating via thrusting action during sexual intercourse. A 2003 study by Gordon G. Gallup and colleagues concluded that one evolutionary purpose of the thrusting motion characteristic of intense intercourse is for the penis to “upsuck” another man&#x27;s semen before depositing its own.

Evolution to increase ejaculate volume in the presence of sperm competition has a consequence on testis size. Large testes can produce more sperm required for larger ejaculates, and can be found across the animal kingdom when sperm competition occurs. Males with larger testes have been documented to achieve higher reproductive success rates than males with smaller testes in male yellow pine chipmunks. In cichlid fish, it has been found that increased sperm competition can lead to evolved larger sperm numbers, sperm cell sizes, and sperm swimming speeds.

In some insects and spiders, for instance &quot;Nephila fenestrate&quot;, the male copulatory organ breaks off or tears off at the end of copulation and remains within the female to serve as a copulatory plug. This broken genitalia is believed to be an evolutionary response to sperm competition. This damage to the male genitalia means that these males can only mate once.

==Female choice for males with competitive sperm==
Female factors can influence the result of sperm competition through a process known as &quot;sperm choice&quot;. Proteins present in the female reproductive tract or on the surface of the ovum may influence which sperm succeeds in fertilizing the egg. During sperm choice, females are able to discriminate and differentially use the sperm from different males. One instance where this is known to occur is inbreeding; females will preferentially use the sperm from a more distantly related male than a close relative.

===Post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance===
Inbreeding ordinarily has negative fitness consequences (inbreeding depression), and as a result species have evolved mechanisms to avoid inbreeding. Inbreeding depression is considered to be due largely to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations. Outcrossing between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny. 
Numerous inbreeding avoidance mechanisms operating prior to mating have been described. However, inbreeding avoidance mechanisms that operate subsequent to copulation are less well known. In guppies, a post-copulatory mechanism of inbreeding avoidance occurs based on competition between sperm of rival males for achieving fertilization. In competitions between sperm from an unrelated male and from a full sibling male, a significant bias in paternity towards the unrelated male was observed.

In vitro fertilization experiments in the mouse, provided evidence of sperm selection at the gametic level. When sperm of sibling and non-sibling males were mixed, a fertilization bias towards the sperm of the non-sibling males was observed. The results were interpreted as egg-driven sperm selection against related sperm.

Female fruit flies (&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;) were mated with males of four different degrees of genetic relatedness in competition experiments. Sperm competitive ability was negatively correlated with relatedness.

Female crickets (&quot;Teleogryllus oceanicus&quot;) appear to use post-copulatory mechanisms to avoid producing inbred offspring. When mated to both a sibling and an unrelated male, females bias paternity towards the unrelated male.

==Empirical support==
It has been found that because of female choice (see sexual selection), morphology of sperm in many species occurs in many variations to accommodate or combat (see sexual conflict) the morphology and physiology of the female reproductive tract. However, it is difficult to understand the interplay between female and male reproductive shape and structure that occurs within the female reproductive tract &quot;after&quot; mating that allows for the competition of sperm. Polyandrous females mate with many male partners. Females of many species of arthropod, mollusk and other phyla have a specialized sperm-storage organ called the spermatheca in which the sperm of different males sometimes compete for increased reproductive success. Species of crickets, specifically &quot;Gryllus bimaculatus&quot;, are known to exhibit polyandrous sexual selection. Males will invest more in ejaculation when competitors are in the immediate environment of the female.

Evidence exists that illustrates the ability of genetically similar spermatozoa to cooperate so as to ensure the survival of their counterparts thereby ensuring the implementation of their genotypes towards fertilization. Cooperation confers a competitive advantage by several means, some of these include incapacitation of other competing sperm and aggregation of genetically similar spermatozoa into structures that promote effective navigation of the female reproductive tract and hence improve fertilization ability. Such characteristics lead to morphological adaptations that suit the purposes of cooperative methods during competition. For example, spermatozoa possessed by the wood mouse (&quot;Apodemus sylvaticus&quot;) possess an apical hook which is used to attach to other spermatozoa to form mobile trains that enhance motility through the female reproductive tract. Spermatozoa that fail to incorporate themselves into mobile trains are less likely to engage in fertilization. Other evidence suggests no link between sperm competition and sperm hook morphology.

Selection to produce more sperm can also select for the evolution of larger testes. Relationships across species between the frequency of multiple mating by females and male testis size are well documented across many groups of animals. For example, among primates, female gorillas are relatively monogamous, so gorillas have smaller testes than humans, which in turn have smaller testes than the highly promiscuous bonobos. Male chimpanzees that live in a structured multi-male, multi-female community, have large testicles to produce more sperm, therefore giving them better odds to fertilize the female. Whereas a community of gorillas consists of one alpha male and two or three females; when the female gorillas are ready to mate, normally only the alpha male is their partner.

Regarding sexual dimorphism among primates, humans fall into an intermediate group with moderate sex differences in body size but relatively large testes. This is a typical pattern of primates where several males and females live together in a group and the male faces an intermediate number of challenges from other males compared to exclusive polygyny and monogamy but frequent sperm competition.

Other means of sperm competition could include improving the sperm itself or its packaging materials (spermatophore).

The male black-winged damselfly provides a striking example of an adaptation to sperm competition. Female black-winged damselflies are known to mate with several males over the span of only a few hours and therefore possess a receptacle known as a spermatheca which stores the sperm. During the process of mating the male damselfly will pump his abdomen up and down using his specially adapted penis which acts as a scrub brush to remove the sperm of another male. This method proves quite successful and the male damselfly has been known to remove 90-100 percent of the competing sperm.
A similar strategy has been observed in the dunnock, a small bird. Before mating with the polyandrous female, the male dunnock pecks at the female&#x27;s cloaca in order to peck out the sperm of the previous male suitor.

In the fly &quot;Dryomyza anilis&quot;, females mate with multiple males. It benefits the male to attempt to be the last one to mate with a given female. This is because there seems to be a cumulative percentage increase in fertilization for the final male, such that the eggs laid in the last oviposition bout are the most successful.

A notion emerged in 1996 that in some species, including humans, a significant fraction of sperm cannot fertilize the egg; rather these sperm were theorized to stop the sperm from other males from reaching the egg, e.g. by killing them with enzymes or by blocking their access. This type of sperm specialization became known popularly as &quot;kamikaze sperm&quot; or &quot;killer sperm&quot;, but most follow-up studies to this popularized notion have failed to confirm the initial papers on the matter. While there is also currently little evidence of killer sperm in any non-human animals certain snails have an infertile sperm morph (&quot;parasperm&quot;) that contains lysozymes, leading to speculation that they might be able to degrade a rival&#x27;s sperm.

In the parasitoid wasp &quot;Nasonia vitripennis&quot;, mated females can choose whether or not to lay a fertilized egg (which develops into a daughter) or an unfertilized egg (which develops into a son), therefore females suffer a cost from mating, as repeated matings constrain their ability to allocate sex in their offspring. The behaviour of these &quot;kamikaze-sperm&quot; is referred to in academic literature as &quot;sperm-blocking&quot;, using basketball as a metaphor.

Sperm competition has led to other adaptations such as larger ejaculates, prolonged copulation, deposition of a copulatory plug to prevent the female re-mating, or the application of pheromones that reduce the female&#x27;s attractiveness.
The adaptation of sperm traits, such as length, viability and velocity might be constrained by the influence of cytoplasmic DNA (e.g. mitochondrial DNA); mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother only and it is thought that this could represent a constraint in the evolution of sperm.

<text>Medicinal plants, also called medicinal herbs, have been discovered and used in traditional medicine practices since prehistoric times. Plants synthesize hundreds of chemical compounds for various functions, including defense and protection against insects, fungi, diseases, against parasites and herbivorous mammals.

The earliest historical records of herbs are found from the Sumerian civilization, where hundreds of medicinal plants including opium are listed on clay tablets, . The Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt, , describes over 850 plant medicines. The Greek physician Dioscorides, who worked in the Roman army, documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in , ; this formed the basis of pharmacopoeias for some 1500 years. Drug research sometimes makes use of ethnobotany to search for pharmacologically active substances, and this approach has yielded hundreds of useful compounds. These include the common drugs aspirin, digoxin, quinine, and opium. The compounds found in plants are diverse, with most in four biochemical classes: alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes. Few of these are scientifically confirmed as medicines or used in conventional medicine.

Medicinal plants are widely used as folk medicine in non-industrialized societies, mainly because they are readily available and cheaper than modern medicines. The annual global export value of the thousands of types of plants with medicinal properties was estimated to be US$60 billion per year and growing at the rate of 6% per annum. In many countries, there is little regulation of traditional medicine, but the World Health Organization coordinates a network to encourage safe and rational use. The botanical herbal market has been criticized for being poorly regulated and containing placebo and pseudoscience products with no scientific research to support their medical claims. Medicinal plants face both general threats, such as climate change and habitat destruction, and the specific threat of over-collection to meet market demand.
==History==

===Prehistoric times===
Plants, including many now used as culinary herbs and spices, have been used as medicines, not necessarily effectively, from prehistoric times. Spices have been used partly to counter food spoilage bacteria, especially in hot climates, and especially in meat dishes that spoil more readily. Angiosperms (flowering plants) were the original source of most plant medicines. Human settlements are often surrounded by weeds used as herbal medicines, such as nettle, dandelion and chickweed. Humans were not alone in using herbs: some animals, such as non-human primates, monarch butterflies and sheep ingest plants when they are ill. 

Samples from prehistoric burial sites indicate that Paleolithic peoples consumed plants. For instance, a 60,000-year-old Neanderthal burial site, &quot;Shanidar IV&quot;, in northern Iraq yielded pollen from eight plant species. At Taforalt cave, Morocco, 15,000-year-old remains of ephedra were found inside a tomb, indicating its possible role in funeral rites. A mushroom found in the personal effects of &quot;Ötzi the Iceman&quot;, whose body was frozen in the Ötztal Alps for more than 5,000 years, may have been used against whipworm.

===Ancient times===
In ancient Sumeria, hundreds of medicinal plants including myrrh and opium are listed on clay tablets from around 3000 BC. The ancient Egyptian Ebers Papyrus lists over 800 plant medicines such as aloe, cannabis, castor bean, garlic, juniper, and mandrake.

In antiquity, various cultures across Europe, including the Romans, Celts, and Nordic peoples, also practiced herbal medicine as a significant component of their healing traditions.

The Romans had a rich tradition of herbal medicine, drawing upon knowledge inherited from the Greeks and expanding upon it. Notable works include those of Pedanius Dioscorides, whose &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; served as a comprehensive guide to medicinal plants and remained influential for centuries. Additionally, Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; contains valuable insights into Roman medical plant practices 

Among the Celtic peoples of ancient Europe, herbalism played a vital role in both medicine and spirituality. Druids, the religious leaders of the Celts, were reputed to possess deep knowledge of plants and their medicinal properties. Although written records are scarce, archaeological evidence, such as the discovery of medicinal plants at Celtic sites, provides insight into their herbal practices 

In the Nordic regions, including Scandinavia and parts of Germany, herbal medicine was also prevalent in ancient times. The Norse sagas and Eddic poetry often mention the use of herbs for healing purposes. Additionally, archaeological findings, such as the remains of medicinal plants in Viking-age graves, attest to the importance of herbal remedies in Nordic culture 

From ancient times to the present, Ayurvedic medicine as documented in the Atharva Veda, the Rig Veda and the Sushruta Samhita has used hundreds of herbs and spices, such as turmeric, which contains curcumin. The Chinese pharmacopoeia, the &quot;Shennong Ben Cao Jing&quot; records plant medicines such as chaulmoogra for leprosy, ephedra, and hemp. This was expanded in the Tang dynasty &quot;Yaoxing Lun&quot;. In the fourth century BC, Aristotle&#x27;s pupil Theophrastus wrote the first systematic botany text, &quot;Historia plantarum&quot;. In around 60 AD, the Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides, working for the Roman army, documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in . The book remained the authoritative reference on herbalism for over 1500 years, into the seventeenth century.

===Middle Ages===
During the Middle Ages, herbalism continued to flourish across Europe, with distinct traditions emerging in various regions, often influenced by cultural, religious, indigenous, and geographical factors. 

In the Early Middle Ages, Benedictine monasteries preserved medical knowledge in Europe, translating and copying classical texts and maintaining herb gardens. Hildegard of Bingen wrote &quot;Causae et Curae&quot; (&quot;Causes and Cures&quot;) on medicine.

In France, herbalism thrived alongside the practice of medieval medicine, which combined elements of Ancient Greek and Roman traditions. Catholic monastic orders played a significant role in preserving and expanding herbal knowledge. Manuscripts like the &quot;Tractatus de Herbis&quot; from the 15th century depict French herbal remedies and their uses. Monasteries and convents served as centers of learning, where monks and nuns cultivated medicinal gardens. Likewise, in Italy, herbalism flourished with contribution Italian physicians like Matthaeus Platearius who compiled herbal manuscripts, such as the &quot;Circa Instans,&quot; which served as practical guides for herbal remedies. 

In the Iberian Peninsula, the regions of the North remained independent during the period of Islamic occupation, and retained their traditional and indigenous medical practices. Galicia and Asturias, possessed a rich herbal heritage shaped by its Celtic and Roman influences. The Galician people were known for their strong connection to the land and nature and preserved botanical knowledge, with healers, known as &quot;curandeiros&quot; or &quot;meigas,&quot; who relied on local plants for healing purposes The Asturian landscape, characterized by lush forests and mountainous terrain, provided a rich source of medicinal herbs used in traditional healing practices, with &quot;yerbatos,&quot; who possessed extensive knowledge of local plants and their medicinal properties Barcelona, located in the Catalonia region of northeastern Spain, was a hub of cultural exchange during the Middle Ages, fostering the preservation and dissemination of medical knowledge. Catalan herbalists, known as &quot;herbolarios,&quot; compiled manuscripts detailing the properties and uses of medicinal plants found in the region. The University of Barcelona, founded in 1450, played a pivotal role in advancing herbal medicine through its botanical gardens and academic pursuits. 

In Scotland and England, herbalism was deeply rooted in folk traditions and influenced by Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse practices. Herbal knowledge was passed down through generations, often by wise women known as &quot;cunning folk.&quot; The &quot;Physicians of Myddfai,&quot; a Welsh herbal manuscript from the 13th century, reflects the blending of Celtic and Christian beliefs in herbal medicine. 

In the Islamic Golden Age, scholars translated many classical Greek texts including Dioscorides into Arabic, adding their own commentaries.
Herbalism flourished in the Islamic world, particularly in Baghdad and in Al-Andalus. Among many works on medicinal plants, Abulcasis (936–1013) of Cordoba wrote &quot;The Book of Simples&quot;, and Ibn al-Baitar (1197–1248) recorded hundreds of medicinal herbs such as &quot;Aconitum&quot;, nux vomica, and tamarind in his &quot;Corpus of Simples&quot;. Avicenna included many plants in his 1025 &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;. Abu-Rayhan Biruni, Ibn Zuhr, Peter of Spain, and John of St Amand wrote further pharmacopoeias.

===Early Modern===
The Early Modern period saw the flourishing of illustrated herbals across Europe, starting with the 1526 &quot;Grete Herball&quot;. John Gerard wrote his famous &quot;The Herball or General History of Plants&quot; in 1597, based on Rembert Dodoens, and Nicholas Culpeper published his &quot;The English Physician Enlarged&quot;. 
Many new plant medicines arrived in Europe as products of Early Modern exploration and the resulting Columbian Exchange, in which livestock, crops and technologies were transferred between the Old World and the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. Medicinal herbs arriving in the Americas included garlic, ginger, and turmeric; coffee, tobacco and coca travelled in the other direction.
In Mexico, the sixteenth century &quot;Badianus Manuscript&quot; described medicinal plants available in Central America.

===19th and 20th centuries===
The place of plants in medicine was radically altered in the 19th century by the application of chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of potentially active substances were discovered in plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around the end of the 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar periwinkle.

==Context==
Medicinal plants are used with the intention of maintaining health, to be administered for a specific condition, or both, whether in modern medicine or in traditional medicine. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in 2002 that over 50,000 medicinal plants are used across the world. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew more conservatively estimated in 2016 that 17,810 plant species have a medicinal use, out of some 30,000 plants for which a use of any kind is documented.

In modern medicine, around a quarter of the drugs prescribed to patients are derived from medicinal plants, and they are rigorously tested. In other systems of medicine, medicinal plants may constitute the majority of what are often informal attempted treatments, not tested scientifically. The World Health Organization estimates, without reliable data, that some 80 percent of the world&#x27;s population depends mainly on traditional medicine (including but not limited to plants); perhaps some two billion people are largely reliant on medicinal plants. The use of plant-based materials including herbal or natural health products with supposed health benefits, is increasing in developed countries. This brings attendant risks of toxicity and other effects on human health, despite the safe image of herbal remedies. Herbal medicines have been in use since long before modern medicine existed; there was and often still is little or no knowledge of the pharmacological basis of their actions, if any, or of their safety. The World Health Organization formulated a policy on traditional medicine in 1991, and since then has published guidelines for them, with a series of monographs on widely used herbal medicines.

Medicinal plants may provide three main kinds of benefit: health benefits to the people who consume them as medicines; financial benefits to people who harvest, process, and distribute them for sale; and society-wide benefits, such as job opportunities, taxation income, and a healthier labour force. However, development of plants or extracts having potential medicinal uses is blunted by weak scientific evidence, poor practices in the process of drug development, and insufficient financing.

==Phytochemical basis==
All plants produce chemical compounds which give them an evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, in the example of salicylic acid, as a hormone in plant defenses. These phytochemicals have potential for use as drugs, and the content and known pharmacological activity of these substances in medicinal plants is the scientific basis for their use in modern medicine, if scientifically confirmed. For instance, daffodils (&quot;Narcissus&quot;) contain nine groups of alkaloids including galantamine, licensed for use against Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The alkaloids are bitter-tasting and toxic, and concentrated in the parts of the plant such as the stem most likely to be eaten by herbivores; they may also protect against parasites.

Modern knowledge of medicinal plants is being systematised in the Medicinal Plant Transcriptomics Database, which by 2011 provided a sequence reference for the transcriptome of some thirty species. Major classes of plant phytochemicals are described below, with examples of plants that contain them.

===Alkaloids===
Alkaloids are bitter-tasting chemicals, very widespread in nature, and often toxic, found in many medicinal plants. There are several classes with different modes of action as drugs, both recreational and pharmaceutical. Medicines of different classes include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine (all from nightshade), the traditional medicine berberine (from plants such as &quot;Berberis&quot; and &quot;Mahonia&quot;), caffeine (&quot;Coffea&quot;), cocaine (&quot;Coca&quot;), ephedrine (&quot;Ephedra&quot;), morphine (opium poppy), nicotine (tobacco), reserpine (&quot;Rauvolfia serpentina&quot;), quinidine and quinine (&quot;Cinchona&quot;), vincamine (&quot;Vinca minor&quot;), and vincristine (&quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot;).

===Glycosides===
Anthraquinone glycosides are found in medicinal plants such as rhubarb, cascara, and Alexandrian senna. Plant-based laxatives made from such plants include senna, rhubarb and &quot;Aloe&quot;.

The cardiac glycosides are powerful drugs from medicinal plants including foxglove and lily of the valley. They include digoxin and digitoxin which support the beating of the heart, and act as diuretics.

===Polyphenols===
Polyphenols of several classes are widespread in plants, having diverse roles in defenses against plant diseases and predators. They include hormone-mimicking phytoestrogens and astringent tannins. Plants containing phytoestrogens have been administered for centuries for gynecological disorders, such as fertility, menstrual, and menopausal problems. Among these plants are &quot;Pueraria mirifica&quot;, kudzu, angelica, fennel, and anise.

Many polyphenolic extracts, such as from grape seeds, olives or maritime pine bark, are sold as dietary supplements and cosmetics without proof or legal health claims for medicinal effects. In Ayurveda, the astringent rind of the pomegranate, containing polyphenols called punicalagins, is used as a medicine, with no scientific proof of efficacy.

===Terpenes===
Terpenes and terpenoids of many kinds are found in a variety of medicinal plants, and in resinous plants such as the conifers. They are strongly aromatic and serve to repel herbivores. Their scent makes them useful in essential oils, whether for perfumes such as rose and lavender, or for aromatherapy. Some have medicinal uses: for example, thymol is an antiseptic and was once used as a vermifuge (anti-worm medicine).

==In practice==

===Cultivation===
Medicinal plants demand intensive management. Different species each require their own distinct conditions of cultivation. The World Health Organization recommends the use of rotation to minimise problems with pests and plant diseases. Cultivation may be traditional or may make use of conservation agriculture practices to maintain organic matter in the soil and to conserve water, for example with no-till farming systems. In many medicinal and aromatic plants, plant characteristics vary widely with soil type and cropping strategy, so care is required to obtain satisfactory yields.

===Preparation===
Medicinal plants are often tough and fibrous, requiring some form of preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract that can be taken orally or applied topically. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.

Traditional poultices were made by boiling medicinal plants, wrapping them in a cloth, and applying the resulting parcel externally to the affected part of the body.

When modern medicine has identified a drug in a medicinal plant, commercial quantities of the drug may either be synthesised or extracted from plant material, yielding a pure chemical. Extraction can be practical when the compound in question is complex.

===Usage===

Plant medicines are in wide use around the world. In most of the developing world, especially in rural areas, local traditional medicine, including herbalism, is the only source of health care for people, while in the developed world, alternative medicine including use of dietary supplements is marketed aggressively using the claims of traditional medicine. As of 2015, most products made from medicinal plants had not been tested for their safety and efficacy, and products that were marketed in developed economies and provided in the undeveloped world by traditional healers were of uneven quality, sometimes containing dangerous contaminants. Traditional Chinese medicine makes use of a wide variety of plants, among other materials and techniques. Researchers from Kew Gardens found 104 species used for diabetes in Central America, of which seven had been identified in at least three separate studies. The Yanomami of the Brazilian Amazon, assisted by researchers, have described 101 plant species used for traditional medicines.

Drugs derived from plants including opiates, cocaine and cannabis have both medical and recreational uses. Different countries have at various times made use of illegal drugs, partly on the basis of the risks involved in taking psychoactive drugs.&#x27;

===Effectiveness===
Plant medicines have often not been tested systematically, but have come into use informally over the centuries. By 2007, clinical trials had demonstrated potentially useful activity in nearly 16% of herbal extracts; there was limited in vitro or in vivo evidence for roughly half the extracts; there was only phytochemical evidence for around 20%; 0.5% were allergenic or toxic; and some 12% had basically never been studied scientifically. Cancer Research UK caution that there is no reliable evidence for the effectiveness of herbal remedies for cancer.

A 2012 phylogenetic study built a family tree down to genus level using 20,000 species to compare the medicinal plants of three regions, Nepal, New Zealand and the Cape of South Africa. It discovered that the species used traditionally to treat the same types of condition belonged to the same groups of plants in all three regions, giving a &quot;strong phylogenetic signal&quot;. Since many plants that yield pharmaceutical drugs belong to just these groups, and the groups were independently used in three different world regions, the results were taken to mean 1) that these plant groups do have potential for medicinal efficacy, 2) that undefined pharmacological activity is associated with use in traditional medicine, and 3) that the use of a phylogenetic groups for possible plant medicines in one region may predict their use in the other regions.

===Regulation===
The World Health Organization (WHO) has been coordinating a network called the International Regulatory Cooperation for Herbal Medicines to try to improve the quality of medical products made from medicinal plants and the claims made for them. In 2015, only around 20% of countries had well-functioning regulatory agencies, while 30% had none, and around half had limited regulatory capacity. In India, where Ayurveda has been practised for centuries, herbal remedies are the responsibility of a government department, AYUSH, under the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare.

WHO has set out a strategy for traditional medicines with four objectives: to integrate them as policy into national healthcare systems; to provide knowledge and guidance on their safety, efficacy, and quality; to increase their availability and affordability; and to promote their rational, therapeutically sound usage. WHO notes in the strategy that countries are experiencing seven challenges to such implementation, namely in developing and enforcing policy; in integration; in safety and quality, especially in assessment of products and qualification of practitioners; in controlling advertising; in research and development; in education and training; and in the sharing of information.&#x27;

=== Drug discovery ===

The pharmaceutical industry has roots in the apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from &quot;Camptotheca acuminata&quot;, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and taxol (from the Pacific yew, &quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot;) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot;.

Hundreds of compounds have been identified using ethnobotany, investigating plants used by indigenous peoples for possible medical applications. Some important phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that &quot;in vitro&quot; studies of their activity often provide unreliable data. As a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven unsuitable as the lead substances in drug discovery. In the United States over the period 1999 to 2012, despite several hundred applications for new drug status, only two botanical drug candidates had sufficient evidence of medicinal value to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

The pharmaceutical industry has remained interested in mining traditional uses of medicinal plants in its drug discovery efforts. Of the 1073 small-molecule drugs approved in the period 1981 to 2010, over half were either directly derived from or inspired by natural substances. Among cancer treatments, of 185 small-molecule drugs approved in the period from 1981 to 2019, 65% were derived from or inspired by natural substances.

===Safety===

Plant medicines can cause adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others remain to be explored scientifically. There is no reason to presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.

Plant extracts may interact with conventional drugs, both because they may provide an increased dose of similar compounds, and because some phytochemicals interfere with the body&#x27;s systems that metabolise drugs in the liver including the cytochrome P450 system, making the drugs last longer in the body and have a cumulative effect. Plant medicines can be dangerous during pregnancy. Since plants may contain many different substances, plant extracts may have complex effects on the human body.

===Quality, advertising, and labelling===
Herbal medicine and dietary supplement products have been criticized as not having sufficient standards or scientific evidence to confirm their contents, safety, and presumed efficacy. Companies often make false claims about their herbal products promising health benefits that aren&#x27;t backed by evidence to generate more sales. The market for dietary supplements and nutraceuticals grew by 5% during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the United States taking action to stop the deceptive marketing of herbal products to combat the virus.

==Threats==
Where medicinal plants are harvested from the wild rather than cultivated, they are subject to both general and specific threats. General threats include climate change and habitat loss to development and agriculture. A specific threat is over-collection to meet rising demand for medicines. A case in point was the pressure on wild populations of the Pacific yew soon after news of taxol&#x27;s effectiveness became public. The threat from over-collection could be addressed by cultivation of some medicinal plants, or by a system of certification to make wild harvesting sustainable. A report in 2020 by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew identifies 723 medicinal plants as being at risk of extinction, caused partly by over-collection.

<text>Berliner Weisse (, ; &quot;Berlin White&quot;) is a cloudy, sour beer of around 3.5% alcohol by volume. It is a regional variation of the wheat beer style from Northern Germany, dating back to at least the 16th century. It can be made from combinations of malted barley and wheat, with the stipulation that the malts are kilned at very low temperatures or even air-dried to minimise colour formation. The fermentation takes place with a mixture of yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;Brettanomyces&quot;) and lactic acid bacteria, a prerequisite that creates the lactic acid taste, a distinguishing feature of Berliner Weisse.

By the late 19th century, Berliner Weisse was the most popular alcoholic drink in Berlin, with up to fifty breweries producing it. By the late 20th century, there were only two breweries left in Berlin producing the beer.

==History==

Most beer authorities trace the origins of Berliner Weisse to an unknown beer being produced in Hamburg which was copied and developed by the 16th century brewer . Broihan&#x27;s beer, &quot;Halberstädter Broihan&quot;, became very popular, and a version was being brewed in Berlin by the Berlin doctor J. S. Elsholz in the 1640s. An alternative possibility, given by Protz among others, is that migrating Huguenots developed the beer from the local red and brown ales as they moved through Flanders into Northern Germany. Some sources, such as Dornbusch, give the date 1572 as being the earliest record of the beer being brewed in Berlin.

Frederick Wilhelm encouraged the spread of the beer through Prussia, declaring it as &quot;best for our climate&quot;, and having his son, Frederick the Great, trained to brew it. A popular story is that Napoleon&#x27;s troops dubbed it &quot;The Champagne of the North&quot; in 1809.

A typical modern strength for Berliner Weisse is around 3% abv, though strength may have varied at times. Traditionally, beers brewed in March (Märzen beers) were brewed stronger and allowed to mature over the summer months, and there is a report that this may have also happened with Berliner Weisse — the bottles being buried in sand or warm earth.

==Brewing==
Modern brewing methods use a low proportion of wheat, generally ranging from 25% to 50%, and deliberately create a sourness either by a secondary fermentation in the bottle (Jackson suggests that traditionally bottles were buried in warm earth for several months), or by adding &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;.
Records from the early 19th century indicate that the beer was brewed from five parts wheat to one part barley, and drunk young, with little indication of creating sourness with either a secondary fermentation or by adding &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;.

==Brands==
At the height of Berliner Weisse production in the 19th century, it was the most popular alcoholic drink in Berlin, and 700 breweries produced it. By the end of the 20th century there were only two breweries left in Berlin, and a handful in the rest of Germany. The two Berlin breweries, Berliner Kindl and Schultheiss, are both now owned by the Oetker Group and one of the few brands still produced in Berlin is &quot;Berliner Kindl Weisse&quot;.

==Serving==

Berliner Weisse is often served in a bowl-shaped glass with flavoured syrups, such as raspberry (&quot;Himbeersirup&quot;), or artificial woodruff flavouring (&quot;Waldmeistersirup&quot;). The beer may also be mixed with other drinks, such as pale lager, in order to balance the sourness.

<text>Higher National Diploma (HND), part of the Higher Nationals suite of qualifications, is an academic higher education qualification in the United Kingdom and various other countries. They were introduced in England and Wales in 1920 alongside the Ordinary National Diploma and the Higher National Certificate. A qualification of the same title is also offered in Argentina, Brunei, Cameroon, India, Malta, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and some other countries.

==Overview==

In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the HND is a qualification awarded by many awarding bodies, such as the Confederation of Tourism and Hospitality (CTH Advanced diploma), Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and BTEC (Vocational programs). In Scotland, a &quot;Higher National&quot; is awarded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). The attainment level is roughly equivalent to the second year of a 3-year English degree or to a Diploma of Higher Education. An HND takes two years of full-time study, or one year full-time following successful completion of a Higher National Certificate; part-time study takes longer.

In Nigeria, HND is a continuation of a National Diploma (ND-[equivalent to associate degree]) programme, both offered by polytechnics. The ND and HND programmes have a duration of two years each with one-year break after the ND programme for an Industrial Training (IT) attachment in relevant industries. At the completion of an HND programme, the graduate would have spent 4 to 5 years; hence, Higher National Diplomas are sometimes referred to &quot;equivalent&quot; of a University bachelor&#x27;s degree or four years of a university education. Although, there have existed a long-standing disagreement over the &quot;equivalence&quot; of Polytechnic HND degree to University bachelor&#x27;s degree; employers of labour (including the government and its policies) have discriminated against HND holders—grading them below their university counterparts and preventing them from attaining managerial or directorate cadres. However, following series of efforts by polytechnic students/lecturers and concerned entities, the federal government has made attempts to remove the dichotomy between Polythecnic HND degree holders and University degree holders in places of employment, and the efforts are paying off as some of the government organisations (especially paramilitary) have started upgrading and employing the HND-holders at par with their University Degree counterparts. Some have even claimed that the HND graduates are better than their university counterparts in the same field, arguing that they write the same entrance exams to seek admission to their course/program of study (the JAMB exams to secure an admission), they both spend the same number of years studying, both completing 120 college credit units with HND holders concentrating more on technicalities, sometimes taking more than 120 credit units and getting more hands on . The HND degree offers limited liberal arts subjects and goes straight into the technicalities of a course using industry standards from year one of OND (one can only gain admission into a HND program after completing two years of OND, an equivalent of an associate degree) and by the final year of HND the student is already equipped to practice in the field.

In Scotland, an HND is Level 8 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework and in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it is Level 5 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework/Credit and Qualifications Framework for Wales. It is quite common for those who have achieved an HND to add to their qualification by progressing to other levels such as professional qualifications, a degree or a &quot;Top-Up&quot; degree. The entry requirements for HND in these countries also differ. One does not require an OND to get into a HND program in England, it is a stand-alone 2-year program making the curriculum and course work different from that in some countries that offer HND degree as a progression of an OND degree.

In Malaysia HND is considered equivalent to General Diploma Qualification. As the qualification is set ambiguously by old Public Service Department (Malaysia) standards, the HND graduate is set to fight the same with general diploma graduates especially in Malaysia Public University. The Malaysia HND graduates is advised to sought to continue with UK degree, or specialized university that able to handle HND qualification.

In Cameroon, The Higher National Diploma is a two-year professional university program which originated in the United Kingdom. It was introduced in Cameroon in 2002 by Ministerial Order No. 02/0069/MINESUP/DDES. In 2018, it underwent major curricula transformation and upgrade to meet contemporary job market needs. To earned the HND, students must complete the approved curriculum (including a research project and internship) by an institution of Higher Learning approved by the Ministry of Higher Education. At the end of the program, students write a national examination organized each academic year by the Ministry of Higher Education through the National Committee for the Organization of Higher National Diploma (HND) Examinations.

<doc id="822251" wikidata="Q1806391" url="?curid=822251" title="Larunda">
<text>Larunda (also Larunde, Laranda, Lara) was a naiad nymph, daughter of the river Almo and mother of the Lares Compitalici, guardians of the crossroads and the city of Rome. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; she is named Lara.

== Myth ==

The only known mythography attached to Larunda is little, late and poetic, in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;. Ovid names her Lara, an excessively loquacious river-nymph, daughter of the river-god Almo. Ignoring parental advice to curb her tongue, she betrays Jupiter&#x27;s secret, adulterous affair with the nymph Juturna, wife of Janus, to his own wife, Juno. Jupiter wrenches out Lara&#x27;s tongue and orders Mercury, psychopomp and god of boundaries and transitions, to conduct her to the &quot;infernal marshes&quot; of Avernus, the gateway to the Underworld, the dismal realm of Pluto. Along the way, Mercury rapes her, despite her pleading glances. Mute (Latin &quot;muta&quot;) and silent (Latin &quot;tacita&quot;), she thus conceives the divine Lares, twin guardians of crossroads and the city of Rome.

Larunda&#x27;s original name, according to Ovid, was &quot;Lala&quot;, imitative of her garulous speech. Robbed of the power of speech, she is likely identical with Muta &quot;the mute one&quot; and Tacita &quot;the silent one&quot;: nymphs, minor goddesses or aspects of a single deity with semantic connections to the Lares and perhaps the Lemures as darker forms of Lares.

== Cult ==
Ovid expounds this myth of Lara and Mercury in the context the festival of Feralia on February 21, and an informal, secretive women&#x27;s folk-cult at the same festival, invoking Tacita (&quot;the silent goddess&quot;). The rite is led by &quot;an old hag&quot; who holds seven black beans in her mouth; it has similarities to the exorcism of hostile, vagrant spirits at the Lemuria festival, but is completed when a fish-head is sewn up to &quot;bind hostile tongues to silence&quot;. Lara/Larunda is also sometimes associated with Acca Larentia whose feast day was the Larentalia on December 23.

<doc id="822255" wikidata="Q212799" url="?curid=822255" title="In the Court of the Crimson King">
<text>In the Court of the Crimson King (subtitled An Observation by King Crimson) is the debut studio album by English progressive rock band King Crimson, released on 10 October 1969, by Island Records. The album is considered one of the earliest and most influential of the progressive rock genre, with the band combining musical influences that rock music was founded upon with elements of jazz, classical, and symphonic music.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest progressive rock albums of all time, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; reached number five on the UK Albums Chart and number 28 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2015, the album was ranked number 2 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time&quot;, behind 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; by Pink Floyd.

== Production ==
===Composition===
The song &quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot; was written for King Crimson predecessor group Giles, Giles and Fripp (the only song on the album for which this was the case), but was retained by King Crimson in order to show the group&#x27;s soft side. According to lyricist Peter Sinfield, the song was influenced by Joni Mitchell; in a 1997 interview, he said it is still his favourite lyric that he ever wrote.

&quot;The Court of the Crimson King&quot; was written by keyboardist/woodwinds player Ian McDonald and Sinfield for their earlier group The Creation, and started as a country and western song before its final progressive rock configuration.

=== Recording ===
Multiple sources state that King Crimson made their live debut on 9 April 1969 at The Speakeasy Club in London, but the band had played an earlier show in February 1969 at the Change Is Club in Newcastle. Sinfield describes the April Speakeasy concert as their second. Another concert at the Speakeasy Club circa August 1969, was disrupted by members of The Pink Fairies Drinking Club (including Steve Peregrin Took, hours before his flight out to the US for Tyrannosaurus Rex&#x27;s August/September 1969 debut American tour) who were out celebrating the completion of Twink&#x27;s solo album &quot;Think Pink&quot;. 

King Crimson opened for the Rolling Stones in Hyde Park, London, in July 1969, before an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 people, which brought them positive attention.

Initial sessions for the album were held in early 1969 with producer Tony Clarke, most famous for his work with The Moody Blues. After these sessions failed to work out, the group were given permission to produce the album themselves. The album was recorded on a 1&quot; 8-channel recorder at Wessex Sound Studios in London, engineered by Robin Thompson and assisted by Tony Page. In order to achieve the characteristic lush, orchestral sounds on the album, Ian McDonald spent many hours overdubbing layers of Mellotron and various woodwind and reed instruments. In some cases, the band went through five tape generations to attain deeply layered, segued tracks.

== Packaging ==
Barry Godber (1945–1970), a computer programmer friend of Sinfield&#x27;s, painted the design for the album cover. He used his own face, viewed through a mirror, as the model. Godber died in February 1970 from a heart attack, shortly after the album&#x27;s release. He was 24 years old. It was his only album cover; the original painting is now owned by Robert Fripp. Fripp had said about Godber&#x27;s artwork:

== Release ==
The album reached No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 28 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

=== Reissues ===
&quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; was reissued several times in the 1980s and 1990s through Polydor and E.G. Records, with pressings made from copies that were several generations removed from the stereo sub-master tape. This resulted in sub-par audio quality and audible tape hiss.

While supervising a mastering cut, Ian McDonald discovered that the copy master had a problem on the right track, and because the first generation master tapes were missing since 1969, this problem was compensated for by EQ until 2002. Fripp speculated that the problem was caused by incompetent mastering engineers or &quot;some tapes were mastered in different countries on machines that were not very well maintained or from copies made in the source country (normally US or UK in the case of rock music) where the second machine was inadequately maintained/monitored. These tapes were then sent out to licensee countries who had no adequate measure of comparison and trusted the source material from the record company office. Tape machines running at different speeds occasionally resulted in albums being a couple of seconds shorter/longer&quot;. 

In 1982, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released a half speed mastered version of the album on vinyl, cut by Stan Ricker with the Ortofon Cutting System. In 1989 the album was remastered for its debut on CD by Robert Fripp and Tony Arnold; this version was part of &quot;The Definitive Edition&quot; series, which consisted of other remastered albums by the band. In 1999, in commemoration of its 30th anniversary, the album was remastered again, this time using 24 bit and HDCD technology by Simon Heyworth, Robert Fripp and David Singleton; this edition was part of the &quot;30th Anniversary Edition&quot; series, which consisted of remastered editions of King Crimson&#x27;s back-catalogue for their 30th anniversaries. 

Three years later, in 2002, the original masters were discovered in the Virgin archives, with splicing tape still present between the various songs, and crossfade between &quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot; and &quot;Epitaph&quot; yet to be created. In 2004, a new remaster was done by Simon Heyworth using these first-generation stereo master tapes and it was released the same year with a 12-page booklet. This release was called &quot;Original Master Edition&quot; and used the same HDCD and 24 bit technology as the 1999 remaster.

In October 2009, Fripp collaborated with musician and producer Steven Wilson to remix the original master recordings in a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix, released as the album&#x27;s 40th Anniversary edition. The album was sold as three different packages: a two-CD set with the old and new stereo versions, a CD and DVD set with the new stereo and surround sound mixes, and a six-disc (5 CD/1 DVD) box with all mixes and bonus audio and video tracks.

In 2010, the original 1969 stereo mix was remastered and reissued on 200-gram super-heavyweight vinyl. This edition was cut by John Dent at Loud Mastering, it was approved by Robert Fripp and included a download code for a 320 kbit/s transfer of the original 1969 vinyl.

In 2019, the album was remixed in 5.1 and stereo by Steven Wilson once again for a 50th anniversary box set of the album. Wilson expressed satisfaction with his 2009 remix, but stated that his 50th anniversary mixes are a significant improvement, being more faithful to the original 1969 mix and benefitting from his 10 years of ensuing experience. The box set includes 3 CDs and a Blu-ray. The Blu-ray features the all-new 2019 stereo and 5.1 mixes encoded at 24/96 resolution, the 2004 &quot;Original Master Edition&quot; with the 1969 mix (also encoded at 24/96), a complete alternate version of the album comprising 2019 Steven Wilson mixes and 2019 instrumental mixes, while the three CDs in the box set feature the new 2019 stereo mix, an expanded edition of the alternate album in the Blu-ray and the &quot;Original Master Edition&quot; plus additional tracks.

== Reception ==
&quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; received acclaim in the British music press. In &quot;NME&quot;, Nick Logan said that although the album lacked the impact of their live concerts, the diverse musical influences from pop, jazz and classical music had produced a result that was &quot;totally original and always captivating&quot;, and stating that &quot;King Crimson, on this showing, have it in them to be huge.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; also noted that the album did not fully capture the power of the band&#x27;s live performances, but that it &quot;still packs tremendous impact&quot;, and that &quot;this is one you should try to hear&quot;. &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; described the album as &quot;a brilliant mixture of melody and freakout, fast and slow, atmospheric and electric, all heightened by the words of Peter Sinfield&quot;. The magazine stated that &quot;this must be heard as a complete entity&quot; and concluded that it would &quot;establish King Crimson as a major talent&quot;. In the US, John Morthland of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said King Crimson had &quot;combined aspects of many musical forms to create a surreal work of force and originality&quot;. However, &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau called the album &quot;ersatz shit&quot;.

Later reviews of &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; have been positive, with AllMusic praising it &quot;[a]s if somehow prophetic, King Crimson projected a darker and edgier brand of post-psychedelic rock&quot; in its original review by Lindsay Planer, and calling it &quot;definitive&quot; and &quot;daring&quot; in its current review. In &quot;Classic Rock&quot; reviews of King Crimson&#x27;s 2009 reissues, Alexander Milas described &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; as the album which &quot;blew off the doors of musical convention and cemented these quintessentially British innovators&#x27; place in rock history for all time&quot;.

In his 1997 book &quot;Rocking the Classics&quot;, critic and musicologist Edward Macan notes that &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; &quot;may be the most influential progressive rock album ever released&quot;. Macan went on to argue that &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; presented an example of every significant element of a mature progressive rock genre. Further, Macan mentions that the album coalesces prog rock tropes and conventions, some of which are only established in the future, into a single congestable medium. The impact of these developments, in his eyes, is the album representing but also influencing the overall musical impact of progressive rock as a whole for decades to come. Paul Stump&#x27;s &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot;, published the same year, stated that &quot;If Progressive rock as a discrete genre can be said to have had a starting point, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; is probably it. All the elements that characterize Progressive&#x27;s maturity are in place: jazz and blues influences are subservient to intense compositional rigour characterized by Mellotron-induced Western classical symphonic arrangements ... Individual and collective passages of arresting virtuosity and a rhythmic discontinuity bordering on the perverse are also components of an essentially tonal, approachable whole inoffensive to any classical or pop listener.&quot; Stump further commented that while the album is defined by avant-garde sensibility and subtle arrangements, it still communicates through the accessible language of rockers.

== Legacy ==
The Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend was quoted as calling the album &quot;an uncanny masterpiece&quot;. In the &quot;Q&quot; &amp; &quot;Mojo&quot; Classic Special Edition &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot;, the album came fourth in its list of &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot;. The album was named as one of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Albums That Built Prog Rock&quot;. In 2014, readers of &quot;Rhythm&quot; voted it the eighth greatest drumming album in the history of progressive rock. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; the second greatest progressive rock album of all time, behind Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. The album is also featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It was voted number 193 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

Hip hop artist Kanye West used samples of &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; in his song &quot;Power&quot;, from his 2010 album &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;. In a 2022 lawsuit by Declan Colgan Music Ltd, the owners of the mechanical licence for the song, they claimed that West had sampled it without a licence. The case was settled in May 2024.

<text>A Higher National Certificate (HNC), part of the Higher Nationals suite of qualifications, is a higher education/further education qualification in the United Kingdom.

==Overview==
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the HNC is a BTEC qualification awarded by Edexcel, and in Scotland, an HNC is a &quot;Higher National&quot; awarded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority. The attainment level of the qualification is roughly equivalent to 6th year at school, or one year of university in Scotland, and a Certificate of Higher Education but being less extensive than that of a Higher National Diploma (HND). Studied full-time, the qualification normally takes one year or two years part-time. Many HNCs cover the same areas as an HND and it is often possible to complete an HND with one year full-time study after successfully completing the HNC.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, an HNC (previously a level 5 qualification) is now Level 4 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework.

In Ireland, an HNC is considered roughly equivalent to a FETAC level 6 Advanced Certificate; as both contain at least 8 modules/units at IRL level 6 (UK level 4)

In Scotland, an HNC is Level 7 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework.

<text>An S bridge is a bridge whose alignment follows a reverse curve, shaped roughly like a shallow letter S in plan, used in early 19th-century road construction in the United States. They were generally used for crossing small, curving streams with uneven banks. Several of these bridges are found in and around the New Concord, Ohio area.

S bridges were originally constructed early in the 19th century. The design was adopted where the road crossed the creek or river at an angle. Constructing a bridge at an angle was much more complicated and expensive than building the bridge perpendicular to the water flow and banks. The bridges were constructed at 90 degrees to the bank, while two &#x27;aprons&#x27; were constructed at opposite angles to direct the traffic flow smoothly onto the bridge, thus creating the &#x27;s&#x27; shape.

Only a few of these bridges still exist, mostly in Ohio. Four of them are located in Guernsey County. Fox Run S bridge is located along U.S. Route 40 in New Concord in Muskingum County. The next bridge, four and a half miles east from New Concord on U.S. Route 40, is found at the intersection of US 40 and Peter&#x27;s Creek Road. Continuing eastward, the next bridge may be found a short distance from US 40 on Manilla Road. The next &quot;S&quot; bridge is east of Cambridge along US 40 at its intersection with Old National Road and has fallen into considerable disrepair. The fourth bridge is located between Old Washington, Ohio and Middlebourne, Ohio along Blend Road, at the intersection of Bridgewater Road, and has been designated a National Historic Landmark. This bridge was closed on 2 October 2013 and no S bridges are still in use for vehicular traffic in Ohio.

These four bridges were constructed as a part of the original National Road, which was built circa 1825.

The S Bridge in Berks County, Pennsylvania, and the Claysville S Bridge in Washington County, Pennsylvania, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Another S bridge, in Anderson County, Kentucky, is located on U.S. Route 62 east of Lawrenceburg. It has undergone major roadway replacement and has been widened.

Another S bridge of note is located in Hertford, North Carolina. It connects a causeway from Winfall to the Town of Hertford, over the Perquimans River.

The Linn Cove Viaduct on the Blue Ridge Parkway in modern example that snakes around Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina.

The Dublin Link pedestrian suspension S bridge was opened in Dublin, Ohio on 17 March 2020.

<doc id="822274" wikidata="Q5990997" url="?curid=822274" title="Mana Genita">
<text>In ancient Roman religion, Mana Genita or Geneta Mana is an obscure goddess mentioned only by Pliny, Plutarch, and Horace. Both Pliny and Plutarch tell that her rites were carried out by the sacrifice of a puppy or a bitch. Plutarch alone has left some examination of the nature of the goddess, deriving &quot;Mana&quot; from the Latin verb , &quot;to flow&quot;, an etymology which the Roman grammarian Verrius Flaccus also relates to the goddess Mania mentioned by Varro, and to the Manes, the souls of the departed. In a Greek equivalence perspective, Plutarch, on account of the bitch sacrifice, loosely connects the goddess to Hekate and in parallel notes that Argive sacrificial practice (using dogs) makes as well for an interesting comparison for her with Eilioneia, meaning the birth goddess Eileithyia. Horace also links her to Eileithyia in carmen saeculare
Some modern commentators have elaborated on the &quot;Genita&quot; and &quot;Mana&quot; qualifiers, to suggest she were a goddess who could determine whether infants were born alive or dead. Others have suggested that Horace may be referring to this goddess when he mentions a goddess Genitalis in the &quot;Carmen Saeculare&quot; (line 16.). Some have compared it to the Oscan (birth goddess), while still others deem that may be only a vague epithet like Bona Dea rather than an actual theonym.

==In Plutarch==
Plutarch writes &quot;Roman Questions&quot; as a series of questions and answers. Of Geneta Mana, he poses the dual question of why a bitch is offered to her as a victim, and why it is prayed that no members of one&#x27;s household should become &quot;good&quot; (meaning &quot;dead&quot;):
Is it because Geneta is a spirit concerned with the generation and birth of beings that perish? Her name means some such thing as &quot;flux and birth&quot; or &quot;flowing birth.&quot; Accordingly, just as the Greeks sacrifice a bitch to Hecatê, even so do the Romans offer the same sacrifice to Geneta on behalf of the members of their household. But Socrates says that the Argives sacrifice a bitch to Eilioneia by reason of the ease with which the bitch brings forth its young. But does the import of the prayer, that none of them shall become &quot;good,&quot; refer not to the human members of a household, but to the dogs? For dogs should be savage and terrifying.&lt;br&gt;

Or, because the dead are gracefully called &quot;the good,&quot; are they in veiled language asking in their prayer that none of their household may die? One should not be surprised at this; Aristotle, in fact, says that there is written in the treaty of the Arcadians with the Spartans: &quot;No one shall be made good for rendering aid to the Spartan party in Tegea&quot;; that is, no one shall be put to death.

<doc id="822289" wikidata="Q4033234" url="?curid=822289" title="Accellera">
<text>Accellera Systems Initiative (Accellera) is a standards organization that supports a mix of user and vendor standards and open interfaces development in the area of electronic design automation (EDA) and integrated circuit (IC) design and manufacturing. It is less constrained than the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and is therefore the starting place for many standards. Once mature and adopted by the broader community, the standards are usually transferred to the IEEE.

==History==
In 2000, Accellera was founded from the merger of Open Verilog International (OVI) and VHDL International, the developers of Verilog and VHDL respectively. Both were originally formed nine years earlier in 1991.

In June 2009, a merger was announced between Accellera and The SPIRIT Consortium, another major EDA standards organization focused on IP deployment and reuse. The SPIRIT Consortium obtained SystemRDL from the SystemRDL Alliance and then developed IP-XACT. The merger was completed in April 2010. SPIRIT stood for &quot;Structure for Packaging, Integrating and Re-using IP within Tool-flows&quot;.

In December 2011, Accellera and the Open SystemC Initiative (OSCI) approved their merger, adopting the name Accellera Systems Initiative (Accellera) while continuing to develop SystemC.

In October 2013, Accellera acquired the Open Core Protocol (OCP) standard, the intellectual property of the OCP International Partnership (OCP-IP).

===The SPIRIT Consortium===
The SPIRIT Consortium was a group of vendors and users of electronic design automation (EDA) tools, defining standards for the exchange of System-on-a-chip (SoC) design information. The standards defined included IP-XACT, an XML schema for vendor-neutral descriptions of design components, and SystemRDL, a language for describing registers in components. SPIRIT stood for &quot;Structure for Packaging, Integrating and Re-using IP within Tool-flows&quot;.

In June 2009 it was announced that SPIRIT would merge with Accellera.

==== SPIRIT membership ====
There were four levels of membership in the SPIRIT consortium. The &quot;Board of Directors&quot; (BoD) was the ruling body. Members around the time of the merge were:
* ARM Holdings
* Cadence Design Systems
* Freescale Semiconductor
* LSI Corporation
* Mentor Graphics
* NXP Semiconductors
* STMicroelectronics
* Synopsys
* Texas Instruments

&quot;Contributing members&quot; performed the standardization work and donate time and effort to the production of new specifications.

&quot;Reviewing member&quot; status was a free membership for companies. These get early access to specifications to facilitate a deep review round of each proposal before it goes public.

&quot;Associate member&quot; status was similar to a reviewing membership but for academics and other not-for-profit organizations.

===Open Core Protocol International Partnership Association===
The &quot;Open Core Protocol International Partnership Association, Inc.&quot; (OCP-IP) was an independent, non-profit semiconductor industry consortium formed to administer the support, promotion and enhancement of the Open Core Protocol (OCP). OCP was the first fully supported, openly licensed, comprehensive, interface socket for semiconductor intellectual property (IP) cores. The mission of OCP-IP was to address problems relating to design, verification, and testing which are common to IP core reuse in &quot;plug and play&quot; system on a chip (SoC) products. This initiative comprehensively fulfills system-level integration requirements by promoting IP core reusability and reducing design time, risk and manufacturing costs for SoC designs. Design teams developing consumer, data processing, telecom (wireless or wired), datacom and mass storage applications can gain significant benefits from the OCP-IP solution.

==Accellera membership==

Corporate members have a right to be eligible for election to the Board of Directors.
Associate member companies have voting rights in all of Accellera&#x27;s Technical Working Groups.

==Standards==
The following EDA standards developed by Accellera were ratified by IEEE by 2019:
*Verilog or IEEE 1364 or IEC 61691-4
*VHDL or IEEE 1076 or IEC 61691-1-1
*Property Specification Language (PSL) or IEEE 1850 or IEC 62531

<doc id="822294" wikidata="Q3365264" url="?curid=822294" title="Drain-waste-vent system">
<text>A drain-waste-vent system (or DWV) is the combination of pipes and plumbing fittings that captures sewage and greywater within a structure and routes it toward a water treatment system. It includes venting to the exterior environment to prevent a vacuum from forming and impeding fixtures such as sinks, showers, and toilets from draining freely, and employs water-filled traps to block dangerous sewer gasses from entering a plumbed structure.

== Overview ==
DWV systems capture both sewage and greywater within a structure and safely route it out via the low point of its &quot;soil stack&quot; to a waste treatment system, either via a municipal sanitary sewer system, or to a septic tank and leach field. (Cesspits are generally prohibited in developed areas.) For such drainage systems to work properly it is crucial that neutral air pressure be maintained within all pipes, allowing free gravity flow of water and sewage through drains. It is critical that a sufficient fall gradient (downward slope) be maintained throughout the drain pipes to keep liquids and entrained solids flowing freely from a building towards the main drain. In situations where a downward slope out of a building en route to a treatment system cannot be created, a special collection sump pit and grinding lift &quot;sewage ejector&quot; pump are needed. By contrast, potable water supply systems are pressurized up to or more and so do not require a continuous downward slope in their piping to distribute water through buildings.

Every fixture is required to have an internal or external trap to prevent sewer gases from entering a structure. Double trapping is prohibited by plumbing codes due to its susceptibility to clogging. In the U.S., every plumbing fixture must also be coupled to the system&#x27;s vent piping. Without a vent, negative pressure can slow the flow of water leaving the system, resulting in clogs, or cause siphonage to empty a trap. The high point of the vent system (the top of its &quot;soil stack&quot;) must be open to the exterior at atmospheric pressure. On large systems, separate parallel vent stacks may also be run to ensure sufficient airflow, because the number of devices linked to an atmospheric vent, and their distances from it, are regulated by plumbing code.

== Operation ==
A sewer pipe is normally at neutral air pressure compared to the surrounding atmosphere. When a column of waste water flows through a pipe, it compresses air ahead of it in the system, creating a &quot;positive&quot; pressure that must be released so it does not push back on the waste stream and downstream traps, slow drainage, and induce potential clogs. As the column of water passes, air must also freely flow in behind the waste stream, or &quot;negative&quot; pressure results, which can siphon water out of a trap after it is passed and allow noxious sewer gases to enter a building. The extent of these pressure fluctuations is determined by the fluid volume of the waste discharge.

Generally, a toilet outlet has the shortest trap seal, making it most vulnerable to being emptied by induced siphonage. 

An additional risk of pressurizing a system ahead of a waste stream is the potential for it to overwhelm a downstream trap and force tainted water into its fixture. Serious hygiene and health consequences can result. Tall buildings of three or more stories are particularly susceptible to this problem. Adequate supplementary vent stacks are installed in parallel to waste stacks to allow proper venting in large and tall buildings and eliminate these pressure-related venting problems.

== External venting ==
DWV systems are vented directly through the building roof. Increasingly DWV pipe is ABS or PVC DWV-rated plastic pipe equipped with a flashing at the roof penetration to prevent rainwater from entering the buildings. Older structures may use asbestos, copper, iron, lead or clay pipes, in rough order of era of use.

Under many older building codes, a vent stack (a pipe leading to the main roof vent) is required to be within approx. a radius of the draining fixture it serves (sink, toilet, shower stall, etc.). To allow a single roof penetration as permitted by local building code, sub-vents may be tied together inside the building and exit via a common vent stack, frequently the &quot;main&quot; vent. Adding a vent connection within a long horizontal run with little slope will aid flow, and when used with a cleanout allows for better serviceability.

Unlike traps for other fixtures, toilet traps are usually designed to self-siphon to ensure complete evacuation of their contents; toilet bowls are then automatically refilled by a special valve mechanism.

== Internal venting ==
In exceptional cases it is either not possible or inconvenient to vent a fixture or fixtures externally. In such cases a resort to &quot;internal venting&quot; may be viable, where compliant with local plumbing codes. Such alternatives include mechanical vents (also called cheater vents) such as air admittance valves and check vents, and &quot;plumb-arounds&quot; such as an inline vent employed in kitchen islands and similar applications:

*Air admittance valves (AAVs, or commonly referred to in the UK as Durgo valves and in the US as Studor vents and Sure-Vent®) are negative-pressure-activated, one-way mechanical valves, used in a plumbing or drainage venting system to eliminate the need for conventional pipe venting and roof penetrations. A discharge of wastewater causes the AAV to open, releasing the vacuum and allowing air to enter the plumbing vent pipe for proper pressure equalization. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

:Since AAVs will only operate under negative pressure situations, they are not suitable for all venting applications, such as venting a sump, where positive pressures are created when the sump fills. Also, where positive drainage pressures are found in larger buildings or multi-story buildings, an air admittance valve could be used in conjunction with a positive pressure reduction device such as the PAPA positive air pressure attenuator to provide a complete venting solution for more complicated drainage venting systems.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

:Using AAVs can significantly reduce the amount of venting materials needed in a plumbing system, increase plumbing labor efficiency, allow greater flexibility in the layout of plumbing fixtures, and reduce long-term roof maintenance problems associated with conventional vent stack roofing penetrations. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

:While some state and local building departments prohibit AAVs, the International Residential and International Plumbing Codes allow it to be used in place of a vent through the roof. AAVs are certified to reliably open and close a minimum of 500,000 times, (approximately 30 years of use) with no release of sewer gas; some manufacturers claim their units are tested for up to 1.5 million cycles, or at least 80 years of use. AAVs have been effectively used in Europe for more than two decades. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

*Check vents 

*In-line vent (also known as an island fixture vent, and, colloquially, a &quot;Chicago Loop&quot;, &quot;Boston loop&quot; or &quot;Bow Vent&quot;) is an alternate method permissible in some jurisdictions of venting the trap installed on an under counter island sink or other similar applications where a conventional vertical vent stack or air admittance valve is not feasible or allowed. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

:As with all drains, ventilation must be provided to allow the flowing waste water to displace the sewer gas in the drain, and then to allow air (or some other fluid) to fill the vacuum which would otherwise form as the water flows down the pipe. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

:An island fixture vent allows water displaces the sewer gas up to the sanitary tee, the water flows downward while sewer gas is displaced upward and toward the vent. The vent can also provide air to fill any vacuum created. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

:The key to a functional island fixture vent is that the top elbow must be at least as high as the &quot;flood level&quot; (the peak possible drain water level in the sink), allowing it to serve as a de facto vacuum breaker preventing the loop from becoming a siphon for an overfilled sink, as from a clogged drain (rather than vent) line.

== Fittings ==
All DWV systems require various sized fittings and pipes which are measured by their internal diameter of both the pipes and the fittings which, and in most cases are Schedule 40 PVC wye&#x27;s, tee&#x27;s, elbows ranging from 90 degrees to 22.5 degrees for both inside diameter fitment (street) as well as outer diameter fitment (hub), repair and slip couplings, reducer couplings, and pipe which is typically ten feet in length. Sizes for hub fittings such as wye&#x27;s and tee&#x27;s are based on the inside diameter of the pipe that goes into their hubs. Items such as washer boxes and Studor vents are also measured by the internal diameter of the fittings.

Cost of materials, ease of installation, and resistance to corrosion all have come to favor Schedule 40 PVC DWV systems, which are replacing cast iron &quot;hub&quot; and &quot;no-hub&quot; DWV systems in many municipalities, while parts and skills associated with installing and maintaining cast iron systems are becoming increasingly scarce and costly. 

The advent of PVC and solvent welding adhesives, which secure fittings against leakage and separation by melting the material into itself, has profoundly simplified and made installing a DWV system less expensive. As with pressurized water &quot;supply&quot; plumbing, all lines must be bored for where they will not compromise structural framing and properly supported inline, and all external penetrations properly sealed and flashed.

<text>Les Trois Vallées (; &quot;The Three Valleys&quot;) is a ski region in the Tarentaise Valley in the Savoie department of Southeastern France, to the south of the town of Moûtiers, partly in Vanoise National Park.

Since 1971, it has been possible to ski the interlinked valleys using a single ski pass. Thus, Les Trois Vallées is the largest connected ski area in the world which is linked solely by ski lifts and slopes. It claims to have about of ski slopes, resulting in 18.5 km² of groomed runs, while an independent expert measured about 493 km. In addition, there are 120 km for cross-country skiing. Les Trois Vallées has 183 ski lifts, which can transport 260,000 skiers per hour. Other equipment owned by the operating companies include 2,300 snow cannons and 73 snow grooming machines operated by 160 snow groomers who work in shifts during the night. Other employees in the area include 424 ski patrollers and 3,000 ski instructors.

As implied by its name, the area originally consisted of three valleys: Saint-Bon, Allues, and Belleville. The skiing area has since been extended into a &#x27;fourth&#x27; valley, the Maurienne valley. It is adjacent to Val Thorens, but can also be accessed using a long gondola lift from Orelle. The following ski resorts are in Les Trois Vallées:

==Tarentaise Valley Skiing==
Within the Tarentaise Valley, there are various other resorts such as Paradiski (Les Arcs, La Plagne) and Espace Killy (Val d&#x27;Isère and Tignes). A weekly lift ticket in Les Trois Vallées used to allow one to ski one day in each of the other two systems mentioned although this has now been removed. There were once plans to interlink all systems and resorts to create the – by far – largest ski area in the world. However that vision was ended with the creation of the Vanoise National Park.

<text>Maglev (derived from &quot;magnetic levitation&quot;) is a system of rail transport whose rolling stock is levitated by electromagnets rather than rolled on wheels, eliminating rolling resistance.

Compared to conventional railways, maglev trains can have higher top speeds, superior acceleration and deceleration, lower maintenance costs, improved gradient handling, and lower noise. However, they are more expensive to build, cannot use existing infrastructure, and use more energy at high speeds.

Maglev trains have set several speed records. The train speed record of was set by the experimental Japanese L0 Series maglev in 2015. From 2002 until 2021, the record for the highest operational speed of a passenger train of was held by the Shanghai maglev train, which uses German Transrapid technology. The service connects Shanghai Pudong International Airport and the outskirts of central Pudong, Shanghai. At its historical top speed, it covered the distance of in just over 8minutes.

Different maglev systems achieve levitation in different ways, which broadly fall into two categories: electromagnetic suspension (EMS) and electrodynamic suspension (EDS). Propulsion is typically provided by a linear motor. The power needed for levitation is typically not a large percentage of the overall energy consumption of a high-speed maglev system. Instead, overcoming drag takes the most energy. Vactrain technology has been proposed as a means to overcome this limitation.

Despite over a century of research and development, there are only seven operational maglev trains today — four in China, two in South Korea, and one in Japan.

The first intercity maglev line is being built in China and will connect Changsha and Liuyang cities in Hunan Province

== History ==

=== Development ===
In the late 1940s, the British electrical engineer Eric Laithwaite, a professor at Imperial College London, developed the first full-size working model of the linear induction motor. He became professor of heavy electrical engineering at Imperial College in 1964, where he continued his successful development of the linear motor. Since linear motors do not require physical contact between the vehicle and guideway, they became a common fixture on advanced transportation systems in the 1960s and 1970s. Laithwaite joined one such project, the Tracked Hovercraft RTV-31, based near Cambridge, UK, although the project was cancelled in 1973.

The linear motor was naturally suited to use with maglev systems as well. In the early 1970s, Laithwaite discovered a new arrangement of magnets, the magnetic river, that allowed a single linear motor to produce both lift and forward thrust, allowing a maglev system to be built with a single set of magnets. Working at the British Rail Research Division in Derby, along with teams at several civil engineering firms, the &quot;transverse-flux&quot; system was developed into a working system.

The first commercial maglev people mover was simply called &quot;MAGLEV&quot; and officially opened in 1984 near Birmingham, England. It operated on an elevated section of monorail track between Birmingham Airport and Birmingham International railway station, running at speeds up to . The system was closed in 1995 due to reliability problems.

=== First maglev patent ===
High-speed transportation patents were granted to various inventors throughout the world. The first relevant patent, (2 December 1902), issued to Albert C. Albertson, used magnetic levitation to take part of the weight off of the wheels while using conventional propulsion.

Early United States patents for a linear motor propelled train were awarded to German inventor . The inventor was awarded (14 February 1905) and (21 August 1907). In 1907, another early electromagnetic transportation system was developed by F. S. Smith. In 1908, Cleveland mayor Tom L. Johnson filed a patent for a wheel-less &quot;high-speed railway&quot; levitated by an induced magnetic field. Jokingly known as &quot;Greased Lightning,&quot; the suspended car operated on a 90-foot test track in Johnson&#x27;s basement &quot;absolutely noiseless[ly] and without the least vibration.&quot; A series of German patents for magnetic levitation trains propelled by linear motors were awarded to Hermann Kemper between 1937 and 1941. An early maglev train was described in , &quot;Magnetic system of transportation&quot;, by G. R. Polgreen on 25 August 1959. The first use of &quot;maglev&quot; in a United States patent was in &quot;Magnetic levitation guidance system&quot; by Canadian Patents and Development Limited.

=== New York, United States, 1912 ===
In 1912 French-American inventor Émile Bachelet demonstrated a model train with electromagnetic levitation and propulsion in Mount Vernon, New York. Bachelet&#x27;s first related patent, was granted in 1912. The electromagnetic propulsion was by attraction of iron in the train by direct current solenoids spaced along the track. The electromagnetic levitation was due to repulsion of the aluminum base plate of the train by the pulsating current electromagnets under the track. The pulses were generated by Bachelet&#x27;s own Synchronizing-interrupter supplied with 220 VAC. As the train moved it switched power to the section of track that it was on. Bachelet went on to demonstrate his model in London, England in 1914, which resulted in the registration of Bachelet Levitated Railway Syndicate Limited July 9 in London, just weeks before the start of WWI.

Bachelet&#x27;s second related patent, granted the same day as the first, had the levitation electromagnets in the train and the track was aluminum plate. In the patent he stated that this was a much cheaper construction, but he did not demonstrate it.

=== New York, United States, 1968 ===
In 1959, while delayed in traffic on the Throgs Neck Bridge, James Powell, a researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), thought of using magnetically levitated transportation. Powell and BNL colleague Gordon Danby worked out a maglev concept using static magnets mounted on a moving vehicle to induce electrodynamic lifting and stabilizing forces in specially shaped loops, such as figure-of-8 coils on a guideway. These were patented in 1968–1969.

=== Japan, 1969 ===
Japan operates two independently developed maglev trains. One is HSST (and its descendant, the Linimo line) by Japan Airlines and the other, which is more well known, is SCMaglev by the Central Japan Railway Company.

The development of the latter started in 1969. The first successful SCMaglev run was made on a short track at the Japanese National Railways&#x27; (JNR&#x27;s) Railway Technical Research Institute in 1972. Maglev trains on the Miyazaki test track (a later, 7 km long test track) regularly hit by 1979. After an accident destroyed the train, a new design was selected. In Okazaki, Japan (1987), the SCMaglev was used for test rides at the Okazaki exhibition. Tests in Miyazaki continued throughout the 1980s, before transferring to a far longer test track, long, in Yamanashi in 1997. The track has since been extended to almost . The world speed record for crewed trains was set there in 2015.

Development of HSST started in 1974. In Tsukuba, Japan (1985), the HSST-03 (Linimo) became popular at the Tsukuba World Exposition, in spite of its low top speed. In Saitama, Japan (1988), the HSST-04-1 was revealed at the Saitama exhibition in Kumagaya. Its fastest recorded speed was .

Construction of a new high-speed maglev line, the Chuo Shinkansen, started in 2014. It is being built by extending the SCMaglev test track in Yamanashi in both directions. The completion date is unknown, with the estimate of 2027 no longer possible following a local governmental rejection of a construction permit.

=== Hamburg, Germany, 1979 ===
Transrapid 05 was the first maglev train with longstator propulsion licensed for passenger transportation. In 1979, a track was opened in Hamburg for the first (IVA 79). Interest was sufficient that operations were extended three months after the exhibition finished, having carried more than 50,000 passengers. It was reassembled in Kassel in 1980.

=== Ramenskoye, Moscow, USSR, 1979 ===

In 1979 the USSR town of Ramenskoye (Moscow oblast) built an experimental test site for running experiments with cars on magnetic suspension. The test site consisted of a 60-metre ramp which was later extended to 980 metres. From the late 1970s to the 1980s five prototypes of cars were built that received designations from TP-01 (ТП-01) to TP-05 (ТП-05). The early cars were supposed to reach the speed up to .

The construction of a maglev track using the technology from Ramenskoye started in Armenian SSR in 1987 and was planned to be completed in 1991. The track was supposed to connect the cities of Yerevan and Sevan via the city of Abovyan. The original design speed was which was later lowered to . However, the Spitak earthquake in 1988 and the First Nagorno-Karabakh War caused the project to freeze. In the end the overpass was only partially constructed.

In the early 1990s, the maglev theme was continued by the Engineering Research Center &quot;TEMP&quot; (ИНЦ &quot;ТЭМП&quot;) this time by the order from the Moscow government. The project was named V250 (В250). The idea was to build a high-speed maglev train to connect Moscow to the Sheremetyevo airport. The train would consist of 64-seater cars and run at speeds up to . In 1993, due to the financial crisis, the project was abandoned. However, from 1999 the &quot;TEMP&quot; research center had been participating as a co-developer in the creation of the linear motors for the Moscow Monorail system.

=== Birmingham, United Kingdom, 1984–1995 ===

The world&#x27;s first commercial maglev system was a low-speed maglev shuttle that ran between the airport terminal of Birmingham International Airport and the nearby Birmingham International railway station between 1984 and 1995. Its track length was , and trains levitated at an altitude of , levitated by electromagnets, and propelled with linear induction motors. It operated for 11 years and was initially very popular with passengers, but obsolescence problems with the electronic systems made it progressively unreliable as years passed, leading to its closure in 1995. One of the original cars is now on display at Railworld in Peterborough, together with the RTV31 hover train vehicle. Another is on display at the National Railway Museum in York.

Several favourable conditions existed when the link was built:
* The British Rail Research vehicle was 3 tonnes and extension to the 8-tonne vehicle was easy.
* Electrical power was available.
* The airport and rail buildings were suitable for terminal platforms.
* Only one crossing over a public road was required and no steep gradients were involved.
* Land was owned by the railway or airport.
* Local industries and councils were supportive.
* Some government finance was provided and because of sharing work, the cost per organization was low.

After the system closed in 1995, the original guideway lay dormant until 2003, when a replacement cable-hauled system, the AirRail Link Cable Liner people mover, was opened.

=== Emsland, Germany, 1984–2011 ===
Transrapid, a German maglev company, had a test track in Emsland with a total length of . The single-track line ran between Dörpen and Lathen with turning loops at each end. The trains regularly ran at up to . Paying passengers were carried as part of the testing process. The construction of the test facility began in 1980 and finished in 1984.

In 2006, a maglev train accident occurred in Lathen, killing 23 people. It was found to have been caused by human error in implementing safety checks. From 2006 no passengers were carried. At the end of 2011 the operation licence expired and was not renewed, and in early 2012 demolition permission was given for its facilities, including the track and factory.

In March 2021 it was reported the CRRC was investigating reviving the Emsland test track. In May 2019 CRRC had unveiled its &quot;CRRC 600&quot; prototype which is designed to reach .

=== Vancouver, Canada, and Hamburg, Germany, 1986–1988 ===

In Vancouver, Canada, the HSST-03 by HSST Development Corporation (Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation) was exhibited at Expo 86, and ran on a test track that provided guests with a ride in a single car along a short section of track at the fairgrounds. It was removed after the fair. It was shown at the Aoi Expo in 1987 and is now on static display at Okazaki Minami Park.

=== South Korea, 1993–2023 ===


In 1993, South Korea completed the development of its own maglev train, shown off at the Daejeon Expo &#x27;93, which was developed further into a full-fledged maglev UTM-02 capable of travelling up to in 2006. This final model was incorporated in the Incheon Airport Maglev which opened on 3 February 2016, making South Korea the world&#x27;s fourth country to operate its own self-developed maglev after the United Kingdom&#x27;s Birmingham International Airport, Germany&#x27;s Berlin M-Bahn, and Japan&#x27;s Linimo. It links Incheon International Airport to the Yongyu Station and Leisure Complex on Yeongjong island. It offers a transfer to the Seoul Metropolitan Subway at AREX&#x27;s Incheon International Airport Station and is offered free of charge to anyone to ride, operating between 9am and 6pm with 15-minute intervals.

The maglev system was co-developed by the South Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM) and Hyundai Rotem. It is long, with six stations and a operating speed.

Two more stages are planned of and . Once completed it will become a circular line. It was shut down in September 2023.

=== Germany/China, 2010–present ===
Transport System Bögl (TSB) is a driverless maglev system developed by the German construction company Max Bögl since 2010. Its primary intended use is for short to medium distances (up to 30 km) and speeds up to 150 km/h for uses such as airport shuttles. The company has been doing test runs on an 820-meter-long test track at their headquarters in Sengenthal, Upper Palatinate, Germany, since 2012 clocking over 100,000 tests covering a distance of over 65,000 km as of 2018.

In 2018 Max Bögl signed a joint venture with the Chinese company Chengdu Xinzhu Road &amp; Bridge Machinery Co. with the Chinese partner given exclusive rights of production and marketing for the system in China. The joint venture constructed a demonstration line near Chengdu, China, and two vehicles were airlifted there in June, 2020. In February 2021 a vehicle on the Chinese test track hit a top speed of .

=== China, since 2000 ===
According to the International Maglev Board there are at least four maglev research programmes underway in China at: Southwest Jiaotong University (Chengdu), Tongji University (Shanghai), CRRC Tangshan-Changchun Railway Vehicle Co., and Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group. The latest high-speed prototype, unveiled in July 2021, was manufactured by CRRC Qingdao Sifang.

==== Low-to-medium speed ====
Development of the low-to-medium speed systems, that is, , by the CRRC has led to opening lines such as the Changsha Maglev Express in 2016 and the Line S1 in Beijing in 2017. In April 2020 a new model capable of and compatible with the Changsha line completed testing. The vehicle, under development since 2018, has a 30 percent increase in traction efficiency and a 60 percent increase in speed over the stock in use on the line since. The vehicles entered service in July 2021 with a top speed of .
CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive said in April 2020 it is developing a model capable of .

==== High speed ====

There are two competing efforts for high-speed maglev systems, i.e., .
* The first is based on the Transrapid technology used in the Shanghai maglev train and is developed by the CRRC under license from Thyssen-Krupp.
** In 2006 the CM1 Dolphin prototype was unveiled and began testing on a new test track at Tongji University, northwest of Shanghai.
** A prototype vehicle of the CRRC 600 was developed in 2019 and tested from June 2020.
** In March 2021 a model began trials.
** In July 2021, the CRRC 600 maglev, planned to travel at up to , was unveiled in Qingdao. It was reported to be the world&#x27;s fastest ground vehicle.
** A high-speed test track is under development in China and also, in April 2021, there was consideration given to re-opening the Emsland test facility in Germany.
* A second, incompatible high-speed prototype was constructed by Max Bögl and Chengdu Xinzhu Road &amp; Bridge Machinery Co. Ltd. and unveiled in January 2021. Developed at Southwest Jiaotong University in Chengdu, the Super Bullet Maglev design uses high-temperature superconducting magnets, is designed for and was demonstrated on a test track.

== Technology ==

In the public imagination, &quot;maglev&quot; often evokes the concept of an elevated monorail track with a linear motor. Maglev systems may be monorail or dual rail—the SCMaglev MLX01 for instance uses a trench-like track—and not all monorail trains are maglevs. Some railway transport systems incorporate linear motors but use electromagnetism only for propulsion, without levitating the vehicle. Such trains have wheels and are not maglevs. Maglev tracks, monorail or not, can also be constructed at grade or underground in tunnels. Conversely, non-maglev tracks, monorail or not, can be elevated or underground too. Some maglev trains do incorporate wheels and function like linear motor-propelled wheeled vehicles at slower speeds but levitate at higher speeds. This is typically the case with electrodynamic suspension maglev trains. Aerodynamic factors may also play a role in the levitation of such trains.
The two main types of maglev technology are:
* Electromagnetic suspension (EMS), electronically controlled electromagnets in the train attract it to a magnetically conductive (usually steel) track.
* Electrodynamic suspension (EDS) uses superconducting electromagnets or strong permanent magnets that create a magnetic field, which induces currents in nearby metallic conductors when there is relative movement, which pushes and pulls the train towards the designed levitation position on the guide way.

=== Electromagnetic suspension (EMS) ===

In electromagnetic suspension (EMS) systems, the train levitates by attraction to a ferromagnetic (usually steel) rail while electromagnets, attached to the train, are oriented toward the rail from below. The system is typically arranged on a series of C-shaped arms, with the upper portion of the arm attached to the vehicle, and the lower inside edge containing the magnets. The rail is situated inside the C, between the upper and lower edges.

Magnetic attraction varies inversely with the square of distance, so minor changes in distance between the magnets and the rail produce greatly varying forces. These changes in force are dynamically unstable—a slight divergence from the optimum position tends to grow, requiring sophisticated feedback systems to maintain a constant distance from the track, (approximately ).

The major advantage to suspended maglev systems is that they work at all speeds, unlike electrodynamic systems, which only work at a minimum speed of about . This eliminates the need for a separate low-speed suspension system, and can simplify track layout. On the downside, the dynamic instability demands fine track tolerances, which can offset this advantage. Eric Laithwaite was concerned that to meet required tolerances, the gap between magnets and rail would have to be increased to the point where the magnets would be unreasonably large. In practice, this problem was addressed through improved feedback systems, which support the required tolerances. Air gap and energy efficiency can be improved by using the socalled &quot;Hybrid Electromagnetic Suspension (H-EMS)&quot;, where the main levitation force is generated by permanent magnets, while the electromagnet controls the air gap, what is called electropermanent magnets. Ideally it would take negligible power to stabilize the suspension and in practice the power requirement is less than it would be if the entire suspension force were provided by electromagnets alone.

=== Electrodynamic suspension (EDS) ===

In electrodynamic suspension (EDS), both the guideway and the train exert a magnetic field, and the train is levitated by the repulsive and attractive force between these magnetic fields. In some configurations, the train can be levitated only by repulsive force. In the early stages of maglev development at the Miyazaki test track, a purely repulsive system was used instead of the later repulsive and attractive EDS system. The magnetic field is produced either by superconducting magnets (as in JR–Maglev) or by an array of permanent magnets (as in Inductrack). The repulsive and attractive force in the track is created by an induced magnetic field in wires or other conducting strips in the track.

A major advantage of EDS maglev systems is that they are dynamically stable—changes in distance between the track and the magnets creates strong forces to return the system to its original position. In addition, the attractive force varies in the opposite manner, providing the same adjustment effects. No active feedback control is needed.

However, at slow speeds, the current induced in these coils and the resultant magnetic flux is not large enough to levitate the train. For this reason, the train must have wheels or some other form of landing gear to support the train until it reaches take-off speed. Since a train may stop at any location, due to equipment problems for instance, the entire track must be able to support both low- and high-speed operation.

Another downside is that the EDS system naturally creates a field in the track in front and to the rear of the lift magnets, which acts against the magnets and creates magnetic drag. This is generally only a concern at low speeds, and is one of the reasons why JR abandoned a purely repulsive system and adopted the sidewall levitation system. At higher speeds other modes of drag dominate.

The drag force can be used to the electrodynamic system&#x27;s advantage, however, as it creates a varying force in the rails that can be used as a reactionary system to drive the train, without the need for a separate reaction plate, as in most linear motor systems. Laithwaite led development of such &quot;traverse-flux&quot; systems at his Imperial College laboratory. Alternatively, propulsion coils on the guideway are used to exert a force on the magnets in the train and make the train move forward. The propulsion coils that exert a force on the train are effectively a linear motor: an alternating current through the coils generates a continuously varying magnetic field that moves forward along the track. The frequency of the alternating current is synchronized to match the speed of the train. The offset between the field exerted by magnets on the train and the applied field creates a force moving the train forward.

=== Tracks ===
The term &quot;maglev&quot; refers not only to the vehicles, but to the railway system as well, specifically designed for magnetic levitation and propulsion. All operational implementations of maglev technology make minimal use of wheeled train technology and are not compatible with conventional rail tracks. Because they cannot share existing infrastructure, maglev systems must be designed as standalone systems. The SPM maglev system is inter-operable with steel rail tracks and would permit maglev vehicles and conventional trains to operate on the same tracks.
MAN in Germany also designed a maglev system that worked with conventional rails, but it was never fully developed.

=== Evaluation ===
Each implementation of the magnetic levitation principle for train-type travel involves advantages and disadvantages.

Neither Inductrack nor the Superconducting EDS are able to levitate vehicles at a standstill, although Inductrack provides levitation at much lower speed; wheels are required for these systems. EMS systems are wheel-free.

The German Transrapid, Japanese HSST (Linimo), and Korean Rotem EMS maglevs levitate at a standstill, with electricity extracted from guideway using power rails for the latter two, and wirelessly for Transrapid. If guideway power is lost on the move, the Transrapid is still able to generate levitation down to speed, using the power from onboard batteries. This is not the case with the HSST and Rotem systems.

==== Propulsion ====
EMS systems such as HSST/Linimo can provide both levitation and propulsion using an onboard linear motor. But EDS systems and some EMS systems such as Transrapid levitate but do not propel. Such systems need some other technology for propulsion. A linear motor (propulsion coils) mounted in the track is one solution. Over long distances coil costs could be prohibitive.

==== Stability ====
Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem shows that no combination of static magnets can be in a stable equilibrium. Therefore a dynamic (time varying) magnetic field is required to achieve stabilization. EMS systems rely on active electronic stabilization that constantly measures the bearing distance and adjusts the electromagnet current accordingly. EDS systems rely on changing magnetic fields to create currents, which can give passive stability.

Because maglev vehicles essentially fly, stabilisation of pitch, roll, and yaw is required. In addition to rotation, surge (forward and backward motions), sway (sideways motion), or heave (up and down motions) can be problematic.

Superconducting magnets on a train above a track made out of a permanent magnet lock the train into its lateral position. It can move linearly along the track, but not off the track. This is due to the Meissner effect and flux pinning.

==== Guidance system ====
Some systems use Null Current systems (also sometimes called Null Flux systems). These use a coil that is wound so that it enters two opposing, alternating fields, so that the average flux in the loop is zero. When the vehicle is in the straight ahead position, no current flows, but any moves off-line create flux that generates a field that naturally pushes/pulls it back into line.

=== Proposed technology enhancements ===
==== Evacuated tubes ====

Some systems (notably the Swissmetro system and the Hyperloop) propose the use of vactrains—maglev train technology used in evacuated (airless) tubes, which removes air drag. This has the potential to increase speed and efficiency greatly, as most of the energy for conventional maglev trains is lost to aerodynamic drag.

One potential risk for passengers of trains operating in evacuated tubes is that they could be exposed to the risk of cabin depressurization unless tunnel safety monitoring systems can repressurize the tube in the event of a train malfunction or accident though since trains are likely to operate at or near the Earth&#x27;s surface, emergency restoration of ambient pressure should be straightforward. The RAND Corporation has depicted a vacuum tube train that could, in theory, cross the Atlantic or the USA in around 21 minutes.

==== Rail-maglev hybrid ====
The Polish startup Nevomo (previously &quot;Hyper Poland&quot;) is developing a system for modifying existing railway tracks into a maglev system, on which conventional wheel-rail trains, as well maglev vehicles can travel. Vehicles on this so-called &#x27;magrail&#x27; system will be able to reach speeds of up to at significantly lower infrastructure costs than stand-alone maglev lines. In 2023 Nevomo conducted the first MagRail tests on Europe&#x27;s longest test track for passive magnetic levitation, which the company had previously built in Poland.

=== Energy use ===
Energy for maglev trains is used to accelerate the train. Energy may be regained when the train slows down via regenerative braking. It also levitates and stabilises the train&#x27;s movement. Most of the energy is needed to overcome air drag. Some energy is used for air conditioning, heating, lighting and other miscellany.

At low speeds the percentage of power used for levitation can be significant, consuming up to 15% more power than a subway or light rail service. For short distances the energy used for acceleration might be considerable.

The force used to overcome air drag increases with the square of the velocity and hence dominates at high speed. The energy needed per unit distance increases by the square of the velocity and the time decreases linearly. However power increases by the cube of the velocity. For example, 2.37 times as much power is needed to travel at than , while drag increases by 1.77 times the original force.

Aircraft take advantage of lower air pressure and lower temperatures by cruising at altitude to reduce energy consumption but unlike trains need to carry fuel on board. This has led to the suggestion of conveying maglev vehicles through partially evacuated tubes.

=== High-speed maglev comparison with conventional high-speed trains ===
Maglev transport is non-contact and electric powered. It relies less or not at all on the wheels, bearings and axles common to wheeled rail systems.

* Speed: Maglev allows higher top speeds than conventional rail. While experimental wheel-based high-speed trains have demonstrated similar speeds, conventional trains will suffer from friction between wheels and track and thus elevating the maintenance cost if operating at such speed, unlike levitated maglev trains.
* Maintenance: Maglev trains currently in operation have demonstrated the need for minimal guideway maintenance. Vehicle maintenance is also minimal (based on hours of operation, rather than on speed or distance traveled). Traditional rail is subject to mechanical wear and tear that increases rapidly with speed, also increasing maintenance. For example: the wearing down of brakes and overhead wire wear have caused problems for the Fastech 360 rail Shinkansen. Maglev would eliminate these issues.
* Weather: In theory, maglev trains should be unaffected by snow, ice, severe cold, rain, or high winds. However, as of yet no maglev system has been installed in a location with such a harsh climate.
* Acceleration: Maglev vehicles accelerate and decelerate faster than mechanical systems regardless of the slickness of the guideway or the slope of the grade, because they are non-contact systems.
* Track: Maglev trains are not compatible with conventional track, and therefore require custom infrastructure for their entire route. By contrast conventional high-speed trains such as the TGV are able to run, albeit at reduced speeds, on existing rail infrastructure, thus reducing expenditure where new infrastructure would be particularly expensive (such as the final approaches to city terminals), or on extensions where traffic does not justify new infrastructure. John Harding, former chief maglev scientist at the Federal Railroad Administration, claimed that separate maglev infrastructure more than pays for itself with higher levels of all-weather operational availability and nominal maintenance costs. These claims have yet to be proven in an intense operational setting and they do not consider the increased maglev construction costs. However, in countries like China, there are discussion of building some key conventional high-speed rail tunnels/bridges to a standard that would allow them upgrading to maglev.
* Efficiency: Conventional rail is probably more efficient at lower speeds. But due to the lack of physical contact between the track and the vehicle, maglev trains experience no rolling resistance, leaving only air resistance and electromagnetic drag, potentially improving power efficiency. Some systems, however, such as the Central Japan Railway Company SCMaglev use rubber tires at low speeds, reducing efficiency gains.
* Mass: The electromagnets in many EMS and EDS designs require between 1 and 2 kilowatts per ton. The use of superconductor magnets can reduce the electromagnets&#x27; energy consumption. A 50-ton Transrapid maglev vehicle can lift an additional 20 tons, for a total of 70 tons, which consumes . Most energy use for the TRI is for propulsion and overcoming air resistance at speeds over .
* Weight loading: High-speed rail requires more support and construction for its concentrated wheel loading. Maglev cars are lighter and distribute weight more evenly.
* Noise: Because the major source of noise of a maglev train comes from displaced air rather than from wheels touching rails, maglev trains produce less noise than a conventional train at equivalent speeds. However, the psychoacoustic profile of the maglev may reduce this benefit: a study concluded that maglev noise should be rated like road traffic, while conventional trains experience a 5–10 dB &quot;bonus&quot;, as they are found less annoying at the same loudness level.
* Magnet reliability: Superconducting magnets are generally used to generate the powerful magnetic fields to levitate and propel the trains. These magnets must be kept below their critical temperatures (this ranges from 4.2 K to 77 K, depending on the material). New alloys and manufacturing techniques in superconductors and cooling systems have helped address this issue.
* Control systems: No signalling systems are needed for high-speed maglev, because such systems are computer controlled. Human operators cannot react fast enough to manage high-speed trains. High-speed systems require dedicated rights of way and are usually elevated. Two maglev system microwave towers are in constant contact with trains. There is no need for train whistles or horns, either.
* Terrain: Maglevs are able to ascend higher grades, offering more routing flexibility and reduced tunneling.

=== High-speed maglev comparison with aircraft ===
Differences between airplane and maglev travel:

* Efficiency: For maglev systems the lift-to-drag ratio can exceed that of aircraft (for example Inductrack can approach 200:1 at high speed, far higher than any aircraft). This can make maglevs more efficient per kilometer. However, at high cruising speeds, aerodynamic drag is much larger than lift-induced drag. Jet-powered aircraft take advantage of low air density at high altitudes to significantly reduce air drag. Hence despite their lift-to-drag ratio disadvantage, they can travel more efficiently at high speeds than maglev trains that operate at sea level.
* Routing: Maglevs offer competitive journey times for distances of or less. Additionally, maglevs can easily serve intermediate destinations. Air routes don&#x27;t require infrastructure between the origin and destination airport and therefore provide greater flexibility to modify service endpoints as needed.
* Availability: Maglevs are little affected by weather.
* Travel time: Maglevs do not face the extended security protocols faced by air travelers nor is time consumed for taxiing, or for queuing for take-off and landing.

== Economics ==
As more maglev systems are deployed, experts expect construction costs to drop by employing new construction methods and from economies of scale.

=== High-speed systems ===
The Shanghai maglev demonstration line cost US$1.2 billion to build in 2004. This total includes capital costs such as right-of-way clearing, extensive pile driving, on-site guideway manufacturing, in-situ pier construction at intervals, a maintenance facility and vehicle yard, several switches, two stations, operations and control systems, power feed system, cables and inverters, and operational training. Ridership is not a primary focus of this demonstration line, since the Longyang Road station is on the eastern outskirts of Shanghai. Once the line is extended to South Shanghai Train station and Hongqiao Airport station, which may not happen because of economic reasons, ridership was expected to cover operation and maintenance costs and generate significant net revenue.

The South Shanghai extension was expected to cost approximately US$18 million per kilometre. In 2006, the German government invested $125 million in guideway cost reduction development that produced an all-concrete modular design that is faster to build and is 30% less costly. Other new construction techniques were also developed that put maglev at or below price parity with new high-speed rail construction.

The United States Federal Railroad Administration, in a 2005 report to Congress, estimated cost per mile of between US$50 million and US$100 million. The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) Environmental Impact Statement estimated a pricetag at US$4.9 billion for construction, and $53 million a year for operations of its project.

The proposed Chuo Shinkansen maglev in Japan was estimated to cost approximately US$82 billion to build, with a route requiring long tunnels. A Tokaido maglev route replacing the Shinkansen be 1/10 the cost, as no new tunnel would be needed, but noise pollution concerns made it infeasible.

=== Low-speed systems ===
The Japanese Linimo HSST, cost approximately US$100 million/km to build. Besides offering improved operation and maintenance costs over other transit systems, these low-speed maglevs provide ultra-high levels of operational reliability and introduce little noise and generate zero air pollution into dense urban settings.

== Records ==
The highest-recorded maglev speed is , achieved in Japan by JR Central&#x27;s L0 superconducting maglev on 21 April 2015, faster than the conventional TGV wheel-rail speed record. However, the operational and performance differences between these two very different technologies is far greater. The TGV record was achieved accelerating down a slight decline, requiring 13 minutes. It then took another for the TGV to stop, requiring a total distance of for the test. The L0 record, however, was achieved on the Yamanashi test track – less than one-third the distance. No maglev or wheel-rail commercial operation has actually been attempted at speeds over .

=== Operational systems ===
==== High speed ====
===== Shanghai Maglev (2003) =====

The Shanghai Maglev Train, an implementation of the German Transrapid system, has a top speed of . The line is the fastest and first commercially operational high speed maglev. It connects Shanghai Pudong International Airport and the outskirts of central Pudong, Shanghai. The service covers a distance of in just 8 minutes.

In January 2001, the Chinese signed an agreement with Transrapid to build an EMS high-speed maglev line to link Pudong International Airport with Longyang Road Metro station on the southeastern edge of Shanghai. This Shanghai Maglev Train demonstration line, or Initial Operating Segment (IOS), has been in commercial operations since April 2004 and now operates 115 daily trips (up from 110 in 2010) that traverse the between the two stations in 8 minutes, achieving a top speed of and averaging . Prior to May 2021 services operated at up to , taking only 7 minutes to complete the trip. On a 12 November 2003 system commissioning test run, it achieved , its designed top cruising speed. The Shanghai maglev is faster than Birmingham technology and comes with on-time—to the second—reliability greater than 99.97%.

Plans to extend the line to Shanghai South Railway Station and Hongqiao Airport on the northwestern edge of Shanghai are on hold. After the Shanghai–Hangzhou Passenger Railway became operational in late 2010, the maglev extension became somewhat redundant and may be cancelled.

==== Low speed ====
===== Linimo (Tobu Kyuryo Line, Japan) (2005) =====
The commercial automated &quot;Urban Maglev&quot; system commenced operation in March 2005 in Aichi, Japan. The Tobu Kyuryo Line, otherwise known as the Linimo line, covers . It has a minimum operating radius of and a maximum gradient of 6%. The linear-motor magnetically levitated train has a top speed of . More than 10 million passengers used this &quot;urban maglev&quot; line in its first three months of operation. At , it is sufficiently fast for frequent stops, has little or no noise impact on surrounding communities, can navigate short radius rights of way, and operates during inclement weather. The trains were designed by the Chubu HSST Development Corporation, which also operates a test track in Nagoya.

===== Daejeon Expo Maglev (2008) =====
The first maglev test trials using electromagnetic suspension opened to public was HML-03, made by Hyundai Heavy Industries for the Daejeon Expo in 1993, after five years of research and manufacturing two prototypes, HML-01 and HML-02. Government research on urban maglev using electromagnetic suspension began in 1994. The first operating urban maglev was UTM-02 in Daejeon beginning on 21 April 2008 after 14 years of development and one prototype; UTM-01. The train runs on a track between Expo Park and National Science Museum which has been shortened with the redevelopment of Expo Park. The track currently ends at the street parallel to the science museum. Meanwhile, UTM-02 conducted the world&#x27;s first-ever maglev simulation. However, UTM-02 is still the second prototype of a final model. The final UTM model of Rotem&#x27;s urban maglev, UTM-03, was used for a new line that opened in 2016 on Incheon&#x27;s Yeongjong island connecting Incheon International Airport (see below).

===== Changsha Maglev (2016) =====
The Hunan provincial government launched the construction of a maglev line between Changsha Huanghua International Airport and Changsha South Railway Station, covering a distance of 18.55 km. Construction started in May 2014 and was completed by the end of 2015. Trial runs began on 26 December 2015 and trial operations started on 6 May 2016. As of 13 June 2018 the Changsha maglev had covered a distance of 1.7 million km and carried nearly 6 million passengers. A second generation of these vehicles has been produced which have a top speed of . In July 2021 the new model entered service operating at a top speed of , which reduced the travel time by 3 minutes.

===== Beijing Line S1 (2017) =====

Beijing has built China&#x27;s second low-speed maglev line, Line S1, Beijing Subway, using technology developed by National University of Defense Technology. The line was opened on 30 December 2017.
The line operates at speeds up to .

==== Fenghuang Maglev (2022) ====

Fenghuang Maglev () is a medium- to low-speed maglev line in Fenghuang County, Xiangxi, Hunan province, China. The line operates at speeds up to . The first phase is with 4 stations (and 2 more future infill stations). The first phase opened on 30 July 2022 and connects the Fenghuanggucheng railway station on the Zhangjiajie–Jishou–Huaihua high-speed railway with the Fenghuang Folklore Garden.

=== Maglevs under construction ===

==== Chūō Shinkansen (Japan) ====

 The Chuo Shinkansen is a high-speed maglev line in Japan. Construction began in 2014, with commercial operations expected to start by 2027. The 2027 target was given up in July 2020. The Linear Chuo Shinkansen Project aims to connect Tokyo and Osaka by way of Nagoya, the capital city of Aichi, in approximately one hour, less than half the travel time of the fastest existing bullet trains connecting the three metropolises. The full track between Tokyo and Osaka was originally expected to be completed in 2045, but the operator is now aiming for 2037.

The L0 Series train type is undergoing testing by the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) for eventual use on the Chūō Shinkansen line. It set a crewed world speed record of on 21 April 2015. The trains are planned to run at a maximum speed of , offering journey times of 40 minutes between Tokyo (Shinagawa Station) and , and 1 hour 7 minutes between Tokyo and Osaka (Shin-Ōsaka Station).

==== Qingyuan Maglev (China) ====
Qingyuan Maglev Tourist Line () is a medium- to low-speed maglev line in Qingyuan, Guangdong province, China. The line will operate at speeds up to . The first phase is 8.1 km with three stations (and one more future infill station). The first phase was originally scheduled to open in October 2020 and will connect the Yinzhan railway station on the Guangzhou–Qingyuan intercity railway with the Qingyuan Chimelong Theme Park. In the long term the line will be 38.5 km.

=== Test tracks ===

==== AMT test track – Powder Springs, Georgia, USA ====
A second prototype system in Powder Springs, Georgia, USA, was built by American Maglev Technology, Inc. The test track is long with a curve. Vehicles are operated up to , below the proposed operational maximum of . A June 2013 review of the technology called for an extensive testing program to be carried out to ensure the system complies with various regulatory requirements including the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) People Mover Standard. The review noted that the test track is too short to assess the vehicles&#x27; dynamics at the maximum proposed speeds.

==== FTA&#x27;s UMTD program, USA ====
In the US, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Urban Maglev Technology Demonstration program funded the design of several low-speed urban maglev demonstration projects. It assessed HSST for the Maryland Department of Transportation and maglev technology for the Colorado Department of Transportation. The FTA also funded work by General Atomics at California University of Pennsylvania to evaluate the MagneMotion M3 and of the Maglev2000 of Florida superconducting EDS system. Other US urban maglev demonstration projects of note are the LEVX in Washington State and the Massachusetts-based Magplane.

==== San Diego, California USA ====
General Atomics has a test facility in San Diego, that is used to test Union Pacific&#x27;s freight shuttle in Los Angeles. The technology is &quot;passive&quot; (or &quot;permanent&quot;), using permanent magnets in a Halbach array for lift and requiring no electromagnets for either levitation or propulsion. General Atomics received US$90 million in research funding from the federal government. They are also considering their technology for high-speed passenger services.

==== SCMaglev, Yamanashi Japan ====

Japan has a demonstration line in Yamanashi prefecture where test train SCMaglev L0 Series Shinkansen reached , faster than any wheeled trains. The demonstration line will become part of the Chūō Shinkansen linking Tokyo and Nagoya which, is currently under construction.

These trains use superconducting magnets, which allow for a larger gap, and repulsive/attractive-type electrodynamic suspension (EDS). In comparison, Transrapid uses conventional electromagnets and attractive-type electromagnetic suspension (EMS).

On 15 November 2014, The Central Japan Railway Company ran eight days of testing for the experimental maglev Shinkansen train on its test track in Yamanashi Prefecture. One hundred passengers covered a route between the cities of Uenohara and Fuefuki, reaching speeds of up to .

==== Sengenthal, Germany and Chengdu, China ====
Transport System Bögl, a division of German construction company Max Bögl, has built a test track in Sengenthal, Bavaria, Germany. In appearance, it&#x27;s more like the German M-Bahn than the Transrapid system.
The vehicle tested on the track is patented in the US by Max Bögl. The company is also in a joint venture with a Chinese firm. A demonstration line has been built near Chengdu, China and two vehicles were airlifted there in June, 2000. In April 2021 a vehicle on the Chinese test track hit a top speed of .

==== Southwest Jiaotong University, China ====
On 31 December 2000, the first crewed high-temperature superconducting maglev was tested successfully at Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China. This system is based on the principle that bulk high-temperature superconductors can be levitated stably above or below a permanent magnet. The load was over and the levitation gap over . The system uses liquid nitrogen to cool the superconductor.

==== Jiading Campus of Tongji University, China ====

A maglev has been operating since 2006 at the Jiading Campus of Tongji University, northwest of Shanghai. The track uses the same design as the operating Shanghai Maglev. Top speed is restricted to due to the length of track and its topology.

==== MagRail test track, Poland ====
In the first quarter of 2022, Polish technology startup Nevomo completed the construction of Europe&#x27;s longest test track for passive magnetic levitation. The 700 meter-long railway track in Subcarpathian Voivodeship in Poland allows vehicles utilizing the company&#x27;s &quot;MagRail&quot; system to travel at speeds of up to 160 kph. The installation of all necessary wayside equipment was completed in December 2022 and tests began in spring 2023.

== Proposed maglev systems ==

Many maglev systems have been proposed in North America, Asia, Europe and on the Moon. Many are in the early planning stages or were explicitly rejected.

=== Australia ===

;Sydney-Illawarra
A maglev route was proposed between Sydney and Wollongong. The proposal came to prominence in the mid-1990s. The Sydney–Wollongong commuter corridor is the largest in Australia, with upwards of 20,000 people commuting each day. Existing trains use the Illawarra line, between the cliff face of the Illawarra escarpment and the Pacific Ocean, with travel times about 2 hours. The proposal would cut travel times to 20 minutes.

;Melbourne

In late 2008, a proposal was put forward to the Government of Victoria to build a privately funded and operated maglev line to service the Greater Melbourne metropolitan area in response to the Eddington Transport Report that did not investigate above-ground transport options. The maglev would service a population of over 4 million and the proposal was costed at A$8 billion.

However, despite road congestion and Australia&#x27;s highest roadspace per capita, the government dismissed the proposal in favour of road expansion including an A$8.5 billion road tunnel, $6 billion extension of the Eastlink to the Western Ring Road and a $700 million Frankston Bypass.

=== Canada ===
Toronto Zoo: Edmonton-based Magnovate proposed a new ride and transportation system at the Toronto Zoo reviving the Toronto Zoo Domain Ride system, which was closed following two severe accidents in 1994. The Zoo&#x27;s board unanimously approved the proposal on 29 November 2018.

The company plans to construct and operate the $25 million system on the former route of the Domain Ride (known locally as the Monorail, despite not being considered one) at zero cost to the Zoo and operate it for 15 years, splitting the profits with the Zoo. The ride will serve a single-directional loop around Zoo grounds, serving five stations and likely replacing the current Zoomobile tour tram service. Planned to be operational by 2022 at the earliest, this would be the first commercial maglev system in North America should it be approved.

=== China ===
====Beijing – Guangzhou line====
A maglev test line linking Xianning in Hubei Province and Changsha in Hunan Province will start construction in 2020. The test line is about in length and might be part of Beijing – Guangzhou maglev in long-term planning. In 2021, the Guangdong government proposed a Maglev line between Hong Kong and Guangzhou via Shenzhen and beyond to Beijing.

====Other proposed lines====
;Shanghai – Hangzhou

China planned to extend the existing Shanghai Maglev Train, initially by around to Shanghai Hongqiao Airport and then to the city of Hangzhou (Shanghai-Hangzhou Maglev Train). If built, this would be the first inter-city maglev rail line in commercial service.

The project was controversial and repeatedly delayed. In May 2007 the project was suspended by officials, reportedly due to public concerns about radiation from the system. In January and February 2008 hundreds of residents demonstrated in downtown Shanghai that the line route came too close to their homes, citing concerns about sickness due to exposure to the strong magnetic field, noise, pollution and devaluation of property near to the lines. Final approval to build the line was granted on 18 August 2008. Originally scheduled to be ready by Expo 2010, plans called for completion by 2014. The Shanghai municipal government considered multiple options, including building the line underground to allay public fears. This same report stated that the final decision had to be approved by the National Development and Reform Commission.

In 2007 the Shanghai municipal government was considering building a factory in Nanhui district to produce low-speed maglev trains for urban use.

;Shanghai – Beijing

A proposed line would have connected Shanghai to Beijing, over a distance of , at an estimated cost of £15.5 billion. No projects had been revealed as of 2014.

=== Germany ===
On 25 September 2007, Bavaria announced a high-speed maglev-rail service from Munich to its airport. The Bavarian government signed contracts with Deutsche Bahn and Transrapid with Siemens and ThyssenKrupp for the €1.85 billion project.

On 27 March 2008, the German Transport minister announced the project had been cancelled due to rising costs associated with constructing the track. A new estimate put the project between €3.2–3.4 billion.

=== Hong Kong ===
In March 2021 a government official said Hong Kong would be included in a planned maglev network across China, planned to operate at and begin opening by 2030.

Hong Kong is already connected to the Chinese high-speed rail network by the Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link, which opened on Sunday 23 September 2018.

=== India ===
Mumbai – Delhi: A project was presented to then Indian railway minister (Mamata Banerjee) by an American company to connect Mumbai and Delhi. Then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that if the line project was successful the Indian government would build lines between other cities and also between Mumbai Central and Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport.

Mumbai – Nagpur: The State of Maharashtra approved a feasibility study for a maglev train between Mumbai and Nagpur, some apart.

Chennai – Bangalore – Mysore: A detailed report was to be prepared and submitted by December 2012 for a line to connect Chennai to Mysore via Bangalore at a cost $26 million per kilometre, reaching speeds of .

=== Iran ===
In May 2009, Iran and a German company signed an agreement to use maglev to link Tehran and Mashhad. The agreement was signed at the Mashhad International Fair site between Iranian Ministry of Roads and Transportation and the German company. The line possibly could reduce travel time between Tehran and Mashhad to about 2.5 hours. Munich-based Schlegel Consulting Engineers said they had signed the contract with the Iranian ministry of transport and the governor of Mashad. &quot;We have been mandated to lead a German consortium in this project,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;We are in a preparatory phase.&quot; The project could be worth between €10 billion and €12 billion, the Schlegel spokesman said.

=== Italy ===
A first proposal was formalized in April 2008, in Brescia, by journalist Andrew Spannaus who recommended a high-speed connection between Malpensa airport to the cities of Milan, Bergamo and Brescia.

In March 2011, Nicola Oliva proposed a maglev connection between Pisa airport and the cities of Prato and Florence (Santa Maria Novella train station and Florence Airport). The travelling time would be reduced from the typical 1 hour 15 minutes to around 20 minutes. The second part of the line would be a connection to Livorno, to integrate maritime, aerial and terrestrial transport systems.

=== Malaysia/Singapore ===
A consortium led by UEM Group Bhd and ARA Group proposed maglev technology to link Malaysian cities to Singapore. The idea was first mooted by YTL Group. Its technology partner then was said to be Siemens. High costs sank the proposal. The concept of a high-speed rail link from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore resurfaced. It was cited as a proposed &quot;high impact&quot; project in the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) that was unveiled in 2010. Approval has been given for the Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed rail project, but not using maglev technology.

=== The Moon ===
The Flexible Levitation on a Track (FLOAT) project, announced by NASA, plans to build a maglev train on the Moon.

=== Philippines ===
Philtram Consortium&#x27;s Cebu Monorail project will be initially built as a monorail system. In the future, it will be upgraded to a patented maglev technology named Spin-Induced Lenz&#x27;s Law Magnetic Levitation Train.

=== Switzerland ===
SwissRapide: The SwissRapide AG together with the SwissRapide Consortium was planning and developing the first maglev monorail system for intercity traffic between the country&#x27;s major cities. SwissRapide was to be financed by private investors. In the long-term, the SwissRapide Express was to connect the major cities north of the Alps between Geneva and St. Gallen, including Lucerne and Basel. The first projects were Bern–Zürich, Lausanne–Geneva as well as Zürich–Winterthur. The first line (Lausanne–Geneva or Zürich–Winterthur) could go into service as early as 2020.

Swissmetro: An earlier project, Swissmetro AG envisioned a partially evacuated underground maglev (a vactrain). As with SwissRapide, Swissmetro envisioned connecting the major cities in Switzerland with one another. In 2011, Swissmetro AG was dissolved and the IPRs from the organisation were passed onto the EPFL in Lausanne.

=== United Kingdom ===

London – Glasgow: A line was proposed in the United Kingdom from London to Glasgow with several route options through the Midlands, Northwest and Northeast of England. It was reported to be under favourable consideration by the government. The approach was rejected in the Government white paper &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&quot; published on 24 July 2007. Another high-speed link was planned between Glasgow and Edinburgh but the technology remained unsettled.

=== United States ===
Washington, D.C. to New York City: Using Superconducting Maglev (SCMAGLEV) technology developed by the Central Japan Railway Company, the Northeast Maglev would ultimately connect major Northeast metropolitan hubs and airports traveling more than , with a goal of one-hour service between Washington, D.C. and New York City. the Federal Railroad Administration and Maryland Department of Transportation were preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the potential impacts of constructing and operating the system&#x27;s first leg between Washington, DC and Baltimore, Maryland with an intermediate stop at BWI Airport.

Union Pacific freight conveyor: Plans are under way by American railroad Union Pacific to build a container shuttle between the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, with UP&#x27;s intermodal container transfer facility. The system would be based on &quot;passive&quot; technology, especially well-suited to freight transfer as no power is needed on board. The vehicle is a chassis that glides to its destination. The system is being designed by General Atomics.

California-Nevada Interstate Maglev: High-speed maglev lines between major cities of southern California and Las Vegas are under study via the California-Nevada Interstate Maglev Project. This plan was originally proposed as part of an I-5 or I-15 expansion plan, but the federal government ruled that it must be separated from interstate public work projects.

After the decision, private groups from Nevada proposed a line running from Las Vegas to Los Angeles with stops in Primm, Nevada; Baker, California; and other points throughout San Bernardino County into Los Angeles. Politicians expressed concern that a high-speed rail line out of state would carry spending out of state along with travelers.

The Pennsylvania Project: The Pennsylvania High-Speed Maglev Project corridor extends from the Pittsburgh International Airport to Greensburg, with intermediate stops in Downtown Pittsburgh and Monroeville. This initial project was claimed to serve approximately 2.4 million people in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The Baltimore proposal competed with the Pittsburgh proposal for a US$90 million federal grant.

San Diego-Imperial County airport: In 2006, San Diego commissioned a study for a maglev line to a proposed airport located in Imperial County. SANDAG claimed that the concept would be an &quot;airports [sic] without terminals&quot;, allowing passengers to check in at a terminal in San Diego (&quot;satellite terminals&quot;), take the train to the airport and directly board the airplane. In addition, the train would have the potential to carry freight. Further studies were requested although no funding was agreed.

Orlando International Airport to Orange County Convention Center: In December 2012, the Florida Department of Transportation gave conditional approval to a proposal by American Maglev to build a privately run , 5-station line from Orlando International Airport to Orange County Convention Center. The Department requested a technical assessment and said there would be a request for proposals issued to reveal any competing plans. The route requires the use of a public right of way. If the first phase succeeded American Maglev would propose two further phases (of ) to carry the line to Walt Disney World.

San Juan – Caguas: A maglev project was proposed linking Tren Urbano&#x27;s Cupey Station in San Juan with two proposed stations in the city of Caguas, south of San Juan. The maglev line would run along Highway PR-52, connecting both cities. According to American Maglev project cost would be approximately US$380 million.

== Incidents ==
Two incidents involved fires. A Japanese test train in Miyazaki, MLU002, was completely consumed by a fire in 1991.

On 11 August 2006, a fire broke out on the commercial Shanghai Transrapid shortly after arriving at the Longyang terminal. People were evacuated without incident before the vehicle was moved about 1 kilometre to keep smoke from filling the station. NAMTI officials toured the SMT maintenance facility in November 2010 and learned that the cause of the fire was &quot;thermal runaway&quot; in a battery tray. As a result, SMT secured a new battery vendor, installed new temperature sensors and insulators and redesigned the trays.

On 22 September 2006, a Transrapid train collided with a maintenance vehicle on a test/publicity run in Lathen (Lower Saxony / north-western Germany). Twenty-three people were killed and ten were injured; these were the first maglev crash fatalities. The accident was caused by human error. Charges were brought against three Transrapid employees after a year-long investigation.

Safety is a greater concern with high-speed public transport due to the potential for high impact force and large number of casualties. In the case of maglev trains as well as conventional high-speed rails, an incident could result from human error, including loss of power, or factors outside human control, such as ground movement caused by an earthquake.

<text>The Golden Guides, originally Golden Nature Guides, were a series of 160-page, pocket-sized books created by Western Publishing and published under their &quot;Golden Press&quot; line (primarily a children&#x27;s book imprint) from 1949. Edited by Herbert S. Zim and Vera Webster, the books were written by experts in their field and featuring realistic color illustrations.

Intended for primary and secondary school level readers, the first books were field guides illustrated by James Gordon Irving, with such titles as &quot;Birds&quot; (1949), &quot;Insects&quot; (1951), and &quot;Mammals&quot; (1955). The series later expanded beyond identification guides to cover a wider range of subjects, such as &quot;Geology&quot; (1972), &quot;Scuba Diving&quot; (1968)&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Indian Arts&quot; (1970).

In 1966, Zim launched a related series, the Golden Field Guides, aimed at high school or college-age readers.

An updated series was relaunched in 2001 as &quot;Golden Guides by St. Martin&#x27;s Press&quot;, illustrated largely with photographs but retaining some of the original 1950s illustrations.

<doc id="822310" wikidata="Q337942" url="?curid=822310" title="Single-issue politics">
<text>Single-issue politics involves political campaigning or political support based on one essential policy area or idea.

==Political expression==

One weakness of such an approach is that effective political parties are usually coalitions of factions or advocacy groups. Bringing together political forces based on a single intellectual or cultural common denominator can be unrealistic; though there may be considerable public opinion on one side of an argument, it does not necessarily follow that mobilizing under that one banner will bring results. A defining issue may indeed come to dominate one particular electoral campaign, sufficiently to swing the result. Imposing such an issue may well be what single-issue politics concern; but for the most part success is rather limited, and electorates choose governments for reasons with a broader base.

Single-issue politics may express itself through the formation of a single-issue party, an approach that tends to be more successful in parliamentary systems based on proportional representation than in rigid two-party systems (like that of the United States). Alternatively, it may proceed through political advocacy groups of various kinds, including Lobby groups, pressure groups and other forms of political expression external to normal representative government. Within a broad-based party it may be the concern of a single-issue caucus.

Very visible as it was in Western democracies in the second half of the twentieth century, single-issue politics is hardly a new phenomenon. In the 1880s, the third government of William Ewart Gladstone made British politics in practical terms single-issue, around the Home Rule Bill, leading to a split of the Liberal Party.

==Groups and voters==

Single-issue politics are a form of litmus test; common examples are abortion, taxation, animal rights, environment, and guns. The National Rifle Association in the United States, which has only one specific interest, is an example of a single-issue group. What differentiates single-issue groups from other interest groups is their intense style of lobbying.

The term &quot;single-issue voter&quot; has been used to describe people who may make voting decisions based on the candidates&#x27; stance on a single issue (e.g., support or opposition to abortion rights, or in support of gun rights or gun control). The existence of single-issue voters can give a distorted impression: a candidate&#x27;s overall views may not enjoy the same support. For example, a person who votes for a socially liberal Republican candidate, based solely on their support of abortion, may not necessarily share the candidate&#x27;s other views on social issues, such as gun rights or family values.

==Single-issue parties==

A single-issue party is a political party which focuses any campaign, efforts, or activism almost exclusively on only a single issue or a very narrow range of issues (e.g., such as a gun rights organization that might also support knife rights).

In instant-runoff electoral systems which allow unsuccessful parties to designate where their votes are redistributed, single-issue parties may be formed as a way to funnel more votes to another candidate with quite different policies. For instance, in the 1999 New South Wales state election, candidate Malcolm Jones received just 0.2% of the primary vote, but achieved the quota of 4.5% required to win a Legislative Council seat after receiving preferences from a wide range of minor parties (including both the &#x27;Gun Owners and Sporting Hunters Rights Party&#x27; and the &#x27;Animal Liberation Party&#x27;); MLC Lee Rhiannon accused many of these parties of being nothing more than fronts.

===Europe===
The most electorally successful British single-issue party is the pro-Brexit party UKIP, which later moved on to support other policies. As its consequences started to become clear, its former leader Nigel Farage left and founded the Brexit Party, renamed Reform UK after the completion of Brexit.

<doc id="822311" wikidata="Q543274" url="?curid=822311" title="Parentalia">
<text>In ancient Rome, the Parentalia () or dies parentales (, &quot;ancestral days&quot;) was a nine-day festival held in honour of family ancestors, beginning on 13 February.

Although the Parentalia was a holiday on the Roman religious calendar, its observances were mainly domestic and familial. The importance of the family to the Roman state, however, was expressed by public ceremonies on the opening day, the Ides of February, when a Vestal conducted a rite for the collective &quot;di parentes&quot; of Rome at the tomb of Tarpeia.

==Overview==
Ovid describes sacred offerings (&quot;sacrificia&quot;) of flower-garlands, wheat, salt, wine-soaked bread and violets to the &quot;shades of the dead&quot; (&quot;Manes&quot; or &quot;Di manes&quot;) at family tombs, which were located outside Rome&#x27;s sacred boundary &quot;(pomerium)&quot;. These observances were meant to strengthen the mutual obligations and protective ties between the living and the dead and were a lawful duty of the &quot;paterfamilias&quot; (head of the family). Parentalia concluded on 21 February in the midnight rites of Feralia, when the &quot;paterfamilias&quot; addressed the malevolent, destructive aspects of his &quot;Manes&quot;.

Feralia was a placation and exorcism: Ovid thought it a more rustic, primitive and ancient affair than the Parentalia itself. It appears to have functioned as a cleansing ritual for Caristia on the following day when the family held an informal banquet to celebrate the affectionate bonds between themselves and their benevolent ancestral dead (&quot;Lares&quot;). The emphasis on the collective cult for the Manes and early &quot;di parentes&quot; implies their afterlife as vague and lacking individuation. In later cults they are vested with personal qualities, and in Imperial cult, they acquired divine &quot;numen&quot; and became &quot;divi&quot;, divine entities. 

From Parentalia to Caristia all temples were closed, marriages were forbidden, and &quot;magistrates appeared without their insignia,&quot; an indication that no official business was conducted. William Warde Fowler describes the Parentalia as &quot;practically a yearly renewal of the rite of burial&quot;.

Individuals might also be commemorated on their birthday &quot;(dies natalis)&quot;. Some would be commemorated throughout the year on marked days of the month, such as the Kalends, Nones or Ides, when lamps might be lit at the tomb. The Lemuria on 9, 11 and 13 May was aimed at appeasing &quot;kinless and hungry&quot; spirits of the dead.

<text>Knut Henry &quot;Krylbo&quot; Eriksson (23 January 1920 – 8 January 2000) was a Swedish middle-distance runner who specialized in the 1500 m event. In 1946 he finished second behind Lennart Strand, both at the national and European Championships. On 15 July 1947, at the national championships at Malmö, Eriksson and Strand had a very close 1500 m race. Strand won, equaling the world record at 3:43.0, and Eriksson finished second, setting his all-time personal best at 3:44.4. Eriksson beat Strand at the 1948 Swedish Championships and at the 1948 Summer Olympics. He retired the same year and returned to his work as a fireman.

Eriksson was one of the three Olympic Flame lighters of the 1956 Summer Olympics equestrian events at Stockholm. He held a world record in the 4 × 1500 m relay, together with three other fireman from his athletics club in Gävle.

<doc id="822325" wikidata="Q182266" url="?curid=822325" title="Xiang Yu">
<text>Xiang Yu ( – January 202 BC), born Xiang Ji, was the Hegemon-King of Western Chu during the Chu–Han Contention period (206–202 BC) of China. A noble of the state of Chu, Xiang Yu rebelled against the Qin dynasty, destroying their last remnants and becoming a powerful warlord. He was granted the title of &quot;Duke of Lu&quot; () by King Huai II of the restoring Chu state in 208 BC. The following year, he led the Chu forces to victory at the Battle of Julu against the Qin armies led by Zhang Han. After the fall of Qin, Xiang Yu was enthroned as the &quot;Hegemon-King of Western Chu&quot; () and ruled a vast area spanning central and eastern China, with Pengcheng as his capital. He engaged Liu Bang, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty, in a long struggle for power, known as the Chu–Han Contention, which concluded with his eventual defeat at the Battle of Gaixia and his suicide.

== Names and titles ==
Xiang Yu&#x27;s family name was Xiang () while his given name was Ji () and his courtesy name was Yu (). He is best known as Xiang Yu (). Xiang Yu is referred to as the &quot;Hegemon-King of Western Chu&quot; () or simply &quot;Hegemon-King&quot; (; also translated as &quot;Conqueror-King&quot;).

==Family background==
There are two accounts of Xiang Yu&#x27;s family background. The first claimed that Xiang Yu was from the House of Mi (), the royal family of the Chu state. His ancestors were granted Xiang County (; around present-day Shenqiu County, Henan) as their fief by the king of Chu and had since adopted Xiang as their family name. The other account claimed that Xiang Yu was a descendant of a noble clan from the Lu state and his family had served in the Chu army for generations. Xiang Yu&#x27;s grandfather, , was a general who was killed in action while leading Chu forces to resist an invasion by the Qin state in 223 BC.

Xiang Yu was born in 232 BC during the late Warring States period when the Qin state started conquering the other six major states. According to the descendants of the Xiang family living in Suqian, Jiangsu, Xiang Yu&#x27;s father was Xiang Chao (), Xiang Yan&#x27;s eldest son. Xiang Yu was raised by his uncle, Xiang Liang, because his father died early. In 221 BC, when Xiang Yu was about 11 years old, the Qin state unified China and established the Qin dynasty.

Xiang Yu had a double pupil in one eye just like the mythical Emperor Shun and Duke Wen of Jin. He was thus seen as an extraordinary person because his unique double pupil was a mark of a king or sage in Chinese tradition. Xiang Yu was slightly taller than eight &quot;chi&quot;, or approximately , and possessed great physical strength as he could lift a &quot;ding&quot;.

==Early life==
In his younger days, Xiang Yu was instructed in scholarly arts and swordsmanship but he did not manage to master what he was taught, and his uncle Xiang Liang was not very satisfied with him. Xiang Yu said, &quot;Books are only useful in helping me remember my name. Mastering swordsmanship allows me to face only one opponent, so it&#x27;s not worth learning. I want to learn how to defeat thousands of enemies.&quot; After hearing that, his uncle tried to teach him military strategy, but he stopped learning after he had grasped the main concepts. Xiang Liang was disappointed with his nephew, who showed no sign of motivation or apparent talent apart from his great strength, so he gave up and let Xiang Yu decide his own future.

When Xiang Yu grew older, Xiang Liang killed someone so they fled to the Wu region to evade the authorities. Around the time, Qin Shi Huang was on an inspection tour in that area. As Xiang Yu and his uncle watched the emperor&#x27;s procession pass by, Xiang Yu said, &quot;I can replace him.&quot; Shocked by what his nephew said, Xiang Liang immediately covered Xiang Yu&#x27;s mouth with his hand. After this incident, Xiang Liang began to see his nephew in a different light.

==Revolt against the Qin dynasty==
In 209 BC, several uprisings erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Some of these rebel groups claimed to be restoring the former six states which were conquered by the Qin state. , the Qin-appointed administrator of Kuaiji Commandery, wanted to rebel against the Qin government as well, so he invited the Xiangs to meet him and discuss. Xiang Yu and Xiang Liang lured Yin Tong into a trap and killed him; Xiang Yu killed hundreds of Yin Tong&#x27;s men during the battle. After that, Xiang Liang started his own rebellion and rallied about 8,000 men to support him, declaring himself the new Administrator of Kuaiji and appointing Xiang Yu as a general. Xiang Liang&#x27;s rebel group grew in size until it was between 60,000 and 70,000 men. In 208 BC, Xiang Liang installed Mi Xin as King Huai II of Chu to rally support from those eager to help him overthrow the Qin dynasty and restore the former Chu state. At this time, King Huai II was merely a puppet ruler as the Xiangs still controlled the Chu rebel group&#x27;s armed forces. During this time, Xiang Yu gained a reputation for being a competent general and formidable warrior from participating in battles against Qin forces.

Later that year, after Xiang Liang was killed at Dingtao against Qin forces, control over the Chu rebel group&#x27;s armed forces fell into the hands of King Huai II and his close aides. In the winter of 208 BC, the Zhao rebel group led by requested for assistance from the Chu rebel group while they were under attack by Qin forces in Handan. King Huai II gave Xiang Yu the title &quot;Duke of Lu&quot; () and appointed him as second-in-command to Song Yi, who had been tasked with leading reinforcements to help the Zhao rebel group. At the same time, King Huai II sent Liu Bang to attack Guanzhong, the heartland of the Qin dynasty, promising both Xiang Yu and Liu Bang that whoever entered Guanzhong first would be made King of Guanzhong.

===Battle of Julu===
Song Yi and Xiang Yu headed to Anyang, some distance away from Julu Commandery, where the Zhao forces had retreated to after their defeat at Handan. At Anyang, Song Yi ordered the troops to make camp for 46 days, refusing to accept Xiang Yu&#x27;s suggestion to advance further. Frustrated at Song Yi&#x27;s inaction, Xiang Yu took him by surprise during a meeting, accused him of treason, and killed him. Song Yi&#x27;s other subordinates feared Xiang Yu so they did not stop him from becoming their acting commander. Xiang Yu then sent a messenger to report the situation to King Huai II, who reluctantly approved his command.

In 207 BC, Xiang Yu advanced towards Julu Commandery, sending Ying Bu and Zhongli Mo to lead a 20,000-strong vanguard to cross the river and attack the Qin forces, while he followed behind with the rest of the troops. After crossing the river, Xiang Yu ordered his men to sink their boats and destroy all but three days worth of rations in order to force his men to choose between prevailing against overwhelming odds within three days and perishing with no hope of turning back. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the Chu forces scored a decisive victory against the 300,000-strong Qin army after nine engagements. After the battle, some other rebel groups came to join Xiang Yu out of admiration. When Xiang Yu met them at the entrance of his camp, the other rebel leaders were so fearful of him that they sank to their knees and did not dare to look up at him.

Meanwhile, the Qin general Zhang Han sent his deputy Sima Xin to the Qin capital Xianyang to seek reinforcements and supplies. However, the Qin government, which was under Zhao Gao&#x27;s control, dismissed the request. Zhao Gao even sent assassins to kill Sima Xin on his way back to Julu Commandery, but Sima Xin survived and returned to report the situation to Zhang Han. Left with no choice, Zhang Han and his 200,000 Qin soldiers surrendered to Xiang Yu in the summer of 207 BC. Xiang Yu did not trust the 200,000 surrendered Qin soldiers and saw them as a liability, so he ordered them to be buried alive at Xin&#x27;an (; present-day Yima, Henan]) while sparing Zhang Han and his deputies Sima Xin and Dong Yi.

===Feast at Hong Gate===
After his victory at the Battle of Julu, Xiang Yu prepared for an invasion of the Guanzhong region, the heartland of the Qin dynasty. In the winter of 207 BC, the last Qin emperor Ziying surrendered to Liu Bang in Xianyang, bringing an end to the Qin dynasty. By the time Xiang Yu arrived at Hangu Pass, the eastern gateway to Guanzhong, he saw that the pass was occupied by Liu Bang&#x27;s troops and knew that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to Guanzhong. Cao Wushang (), one of Liu Bang&#x27;s subordinates, sent a messenger to see Xiang Yu, saying that Liu Bang would be King of Guanzhong in accordance with King Huai II&#x27;s earlier promise, while Ziying would be appointed as Liu Bang&#x27;s chancellor. Xiang Yu was furious after hearing that. At the time, Xiang Yu had about 400,000 troops while Liu Bang had only a quarter of that number.

Acting on Fan Zeng&#x27;s advice, Xiang Yu invited Liu Bang to attend a feast at Swan Goose Gate and plotted to assassinate Liu Bang during the feast. However, Xiang Yu later listened to his uncle Xiang Bo and decided to spare Liu Bang, allowing Liu Bang to escape halfway during the feast.

In 206 BC, Xiang Yu paid no attention to Liu Bang&#x27;s presumptive title and led his troops into Xianyang, where he executed Ziying and his family, and ordered the destruction of the Epang Palace by fire. It was said that Xiang Yu would leave behind a trail of destruction in the places he passed by, and the people of Guanzhong were greatly disappointed with him.

Acting against his followers&#x27; advice to remain in Guanzhong and continue with conquering the territories held by the other rebel groups, Xiang Yu was insistent on returning to his home territory. He said, &quot;To not return home when one has made his fortune is equivalent to walking on the streets at night in glamorous outfits. Who would notice that?&quot; One of his followers remarked, &quot;It is indeed true when people say that the men of Chu are apes dressed in human clothing.&quot; Xiang Yu had that man boiled alive when he heard that insult.

==Division of the empire==
In the spring of 206 BC, Xiang Yu promoted King Huai II, the nominal ruler of the Chu rebel group, to a more &quot;honourable&quot; title – Emperor Yi of Chu – and divided the territories of the former Qin dynasty into the Eighteen Kingdoms. He declared himself &quot;Hegemon-King of Western Chu&quot; and ruled nine commanderies in the former Liang and Chu states, with his kingdom&#x27;s capital at Pengcheng (; present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu). The remaining kingdoms were granted to, among others, Xiang Yu&#x27;s subordinates, some leaders of the other rebel groups, and the three surrendered Qin generals. The Guanzhong region, which was rightfully Liu Bang&#x27;s according to the earlier promise by King Huai II, was instead given to the three surrendered Qin generals and collectively known as the Three Qins. Liu Bang, on the other hand, was relocated to the remote Hanzhong and given the title &quot;King of Han&quot;.

Among the kings appointed by Xiang Yu, some were followers of the leaders of the other rebel groups, and the leaders themselves should rightfully be the kings instead of their followers. Xiang Yu also did not award titles to some rebel leaders who had not supported him earlier but had contributed to the overthrow of the Qin dynasty. In the winter of 206 BC, Xiang Yu moved Emperor Yi of Chu to the remote Chen County (; present-day Chenzhou, Hunan), effectively sending the puppet emperor into exile. In 205 BC, while en route to Chen County, Emperor Yi was assassinated by Ying Bu, the King of Jiujiang, who had been acting on Xiang Yu&#x27;s order.

In late 206 BC, Xiang Yu executed Han Cheng, the King of Hán, and replaced him with Zheng Chang. Some months later, seized control of the former Qi territories – divided into the Jiaodong, Qi and Jibei kingdoms – from their respective kings appointed by Xiang Yu, and declared himself the King of Qi. In the Zhao territories, Chen Yu led an uprising against Zhang Er, the King of Changshan appointed by Xiang Yu, seized control of Changsha and installed as the King of Zhao.

==Chu–Han Contention==

===Battle of Pengcheng===
In 206 BC, Liu Bang led his forces to attack the Three Qins in the Guanzhong region. At the time, Xiang Yu was away on a campaign in the Qi territories against Tian Rong and did not pay much attention to Liu Bang&#x27;s invasion.

The following year, Liu Bang formed an alliance with another five kingdoms and attacked Xiang Yu with a 560,000-strong army, capturing the Western Chu capital Pengcheng.

Upon hearing this, Xiang Yu turned back from Qi and led 30,000 troops to attack Liu Bang, defeating and inflicting heavy casualties on the latter&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Pengcheng.

===Battle of Xingyang===
After losing Pengcheng, Liu Bang retreated to Xingyang with Xiang Yu in pursuit. At Xingyang, Liu Bang managed to hold his position against Xiang Yu until 204 BC. Ji Xin, one of Liu Bang&#x27;s subordinates who resembled his lord in appearance, disguised himself as Liu Bang and pretended to surrender to Xiang Yu, buying time for Liu Bang to escape. When Xiang Yu learnt that he had been fooled, he had Ji Xin burnt to death.

After the fall of Xingyang, the Chu and Han forces respectively occupied the territories east and west of present-day Henan. On the battlefront north of the Yellow River, Xiang Yu&#x27;s forces were not faring well as Han Xin, one of Liu Bang&#x27;s generals, had conquered the Zhao kingdom and defeated Xiang Yu&#x27;s general Long Ju at the Battle of Wei River. Concurrently, Peng Yue, Liu Bang&#x27;s ally, was constantly launching guerrilla-style attacks on Xiang Yu&#x27;s territories in the east.

===Treaty of Hong Canal===
By 203 BC, the tide had turned in Liu Bang&#x27;s favour. After a year-long siege, Xiang Yu managed to capture Liu Bang&#x27;s father and threatened to boil him alive if Liu Bang refused to surrender to him. Liu Bang remarked that since he and Xiang Yu had become oath brothers earlier in a ceremony in 208 BC, Xiang Yu would, in the eyes of everyone, be deemed guilty of patricide if he killed Liu Bang&#x27;s father. Both sides ultimately agreed to make peace in an event known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into east and west under Xiang Yu and Liu Bang&#x27;s control respectively. Xiang Yu also released Liu Bang&#x27;s father and other hostages he had captured earlier.

===Battle of Guling===
Shortly after, Liu Bang renounced the peace agreement and attacked Xiang Yu while the latter was heading back to Pengcheng. At the same time, he sent messengers to Han Xin and Peng Yue, requesting them to join him in attacking Xiang Yu on three fronts. However, Han Xin and Peng Yue did not mobilise their forces, so Liu Bang ended up being defeated by Xiang Yu at the Battle of Guling. After his defeat, Liu Bang retreated to strengthen his defences, while concurrently sending messengers to meet Han Xin and Peng Yue again, promising to make them kings and grant them territories if they helped him defeat Xiang Yu.

===Defeat and death===

In 202 BC, the combined forces of Liu Bang, Han Xin and Peng Yue attacked Xiang Yu from three fronts and managed to trap Xiang Yu&#x27;s forces, which were running low on supplies, at Gaixia (; in present-day Anhui). Han Xin ordered his men to sing folk songs from the Chu territories to evoke feelings of nostalgia among the Chu soldiers and create the impression that many Chu soldiers had surrendered and joined the Han forces. The morale of Xiang Yu&#x27;s forces plummeted and many of them deserted. Xiang Yu, in despair, composed the &quot;Song of Gaixia&quot; while his wife Consort Yu committed suicide.

The next morning, Xiang Yu led about 800 of his remaining elite horsemen on a desperate attempt to break out of the siege, with 5,000 enemy troops in pursuit. After crossing the Huai River, Xiang Yu was left with only a few hundred men. They lost their way so Xiang Yu asked for directions from a farmer, who directed him wrongly to a swamp. By the time they reached Dongcheng (; in present-day Dingyuan County, Anhui), Xiang Yu had only 28 men left. There, he made a speech, declaring that his downfall was due to Heaven&#x27;s will and not his personal failures.

After that, Xiang Yu led his men to break out of the encirclement, killing one Han officer in the process. He then split his remaining men into three groups to confuse the enemy and induce them to split up too to attack the groups. In doing so, he took the enemy by surprise and killed another Han officer, inflicting about 100 casualties on them while losing only two men.

Xiang Yu retreated to the bank of the Wu River (; near present-day He County, Anhui), where the ferryman at the ford had prepared a boat for him to cross the river to the Jiangdong region where Xiang Yu&#x27;s hometown was. The ferryman urged him to retreat to Jiangdong, saying that he still had the support of the people there. However, Xiang Yu replied that he was too ashamed to return home and face the people because all the 8,000 men from Jiangdong he had first brought along into battle had all perished. He refused to cross the river and ordered his remaining men to dismount while asking the ferryman to take his warhorse, Zhui (), back home.

Xiang Yu and his men made a last stand against wave after wave of Han forces until only Xiang Yu himself was still alive. Continuing to fight fiercely, he killed over 100 enemy soldiers but also sustained several wounds all over his body. Just then, he recognised an old friend, Lü Matong (), among the Han soldiers, so he called out to him: &quot;I heard that the King of Han (Liu Bang) has placed a price of 1,000 gold and the title of &quot;Wanhu Marquis&quot; (; &quot;marquis of 10,000 households&quot;) on my head. Take it then, on account of our past friendship.&quot; Xiang Yu then committed suicide by slitting his throat with his sword. A brawl broke out among the Han soldiers over Xiang Yu&#x27;s dead body as they were eager to claim the reward; Xiang Yu&#x27;s body was dismembered and mutilated in the process. Liu Bang eventually divided the reward among Lü Matong and four others who showed up with Xiang Yu&#x27;s body parts.

After Xiang Yu&#x27;s death, the rest of Western Chu surrendered and China was unified under Liu Bang&#x27;s rule, marking the start of the Han dynasty. Liu Bang held a funeral for Xiang Yu in Gucheng (; in present-day Dongping County, Shandong), with the ceremony befitting Xiang Yu&#x27;s earlier title &quot;Duke of Lu&quot;. He also spared the lives of Xiang Yu&#x27;s relatives, including Xiang Yu&#x27;s uncle Xiang Bo who had saved his life during the Feast at Swan Goose Gate, and made them marquises.

==Evaluation==
=== Classical ===
The historian Sima Qian, who wrote Xiang Yu&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Shi Ji&quot;, described him as someone who boasted about his achievements and thought highly of himself. Xiang Yu preferred to depend on his personal abilities as opposed to learning with humility from others. In Sima Qian&#x27;s view, Xiang Yu had not only failed to recognise his own shortcomings, but also failed to make attempts to correct his mistakes. Sima Qian felt that it was ridiculous for Xiang Yu to attribute his downfall to Heaven&#x27;s will instead of his personal failures. As Xiang Yu had ordered massacres of entire populations of cities even after they had surrendered peacefully, his cruelty had led to cities putting up strong resistance since they believed they would be killed even if they surrendered to him. The most notorious example of his cruelty was after the Battle of Julu when he ordered the 200,000 surrendered Qin soldiers to be buried alive. Other instances included the gruesome methods of execution he employed against his enemies and critics. In contrast, Liu Bang was a shrewd and cunning ruler who was sometimes ruthless too, but had made the wiser choice in forbidding his troops from looting the cities they had captured and sparing the lives of the citizens, earning their support and trust in return. Xiang Yu became an example for Confucianists to advocate the idea that leaders should rule with benevolence and not govern by instilling fear in the people. Xiang Yu&#x27;s ambitions ended with the collapse of Western Chu, his defeat by Liu Bang, and his death at an early age.

Han Xin once described Xiang Yu as follows: &quot;A man who turns into a fierce warrior when he encounters a rival stronger than he is, but also one who is sympathetic and soft-hearted when he sees someone weaker than he is. He was neither able to make good use of capable generals nor able to support Emperor Yi of Chu; he showed no mercy at all in battle. Even though he was a Hegemon-King in name, he had already lost the people&#x27;s hearts.&quot;

The Tang dynasty poet Du Mu mentioned Xiang Yu in a poem: &quot;Victory or defeat is common in battle. One who can endure humiliation is a true man. There are several talents in Jiangdong. Who knows if he (Xiang Yu) can made a comeback?&quot; The Song dynasty poet Wang Anshi had a different opinion wrote: &quot;The warrior is already tired after so many battles. His defeat in the Central Plains is hard to reverse. Although there are talents in Jiangdong, are they willing to help him?&quot; The Song dynasty poet Li Qingzhao wrote: &quot;A hero in life; a king of ghosts after death. Until now, we still remember Xiang Yu, who refused to return to Jiangdong.&quot;

Xiang Yu is popularly viewed as a leader who possessed great courage but lacked wisdom, and his character is aptly summarised using the Chinese idiom , meaning &quot;has courage but lacks tactics&quot;, or &quot;foolhardy&quot;. Another Chinese idiom , was also derived from the Battle of Gaixia, and used to describe someone in a desperate situation without help. Another saying by Liu Bang, &quot;Having a Fan Zeng but unable to use him&quot; (), was also used to describe Xiang Yu&#x27;s reliance on Fan Zeng and failure to actually listen to Fan Zeng&#x27;s advice.

=== Modern era ===
Modern historians have drawn similarities between Xiang Yu&#x27;s military brilliance and that of his Mediterranean contemporary Hannibal. Researchers emphasised Xiang Yu&#x27;s strategic thinking, while also exploiting any opportunities to launch a surprise attack in the morning under the cover of darkness, as Xiang Yu was outstanding in this regard. His tactical early morning raids on the enemy fully demonstrated his superb strategy of mobilization and artistic prowess, despite facing unprecedented crises.

Mao Zedong also once mentioned Xiang Yu: &quot;We should use our remaining strength to defeat the enemy, instead of thinking about achieving fame like the Hegemon-King.&quot; In 1964, Mao also pointed out three reasons for Xiang Yu&#x27;s downfall: not following Fan Zeng&#x27;s advice to kill Liu Bang during the Feast at Swan Goose Gate and letting Liu Bang escape; adhering firmly to the terms of the Treaty of Hong Canal without considering that Liu Bang might betray his trust; building his capital at Pengcheng.

==In popular culture==
=== Song of Gaixia ===
The &quot;Song of Gaixia&quot; () was composed by Xiang Yu during the Battle of Gaixia. The lyrics in English as follows are Burton Watson&#x27;s translation:


Xiang Yu&#x27;s prowess in battle has been glorified in Chinese folk tales, poetry, and novels, and he has been the subject of films, television, plays, operas, video games and comics. His classic image is that of a heroic and brave, but arrogant and bloodthirsty warrior-king. His romance with his wife Consort Yu and his suicide have also added a touch of a tragic hero to his character.

===Poetry, folk tales, novels===
Xiang Yu&#x27;s prowess in battle is mentioned in Chinese folk tales and poetry, particularly during the Battle of Gaixia. The &quot;Meng Qiu&quot; (), an eighth-century primer by the scholar Li Han, contains the four-character rhyming couplet &quot;Ji Xin impersonates the Emperor&quot;. It referred to the incident during the Battle of Xingyang in 205 BC when Ji Xin and 2,000 women disguised themselves as Liu Bang and his troops to distract Xiang Yu and buy time for Liu Bang to escape.

In the 14th-century classical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the warlord Sun Ce is nicknamed &quot;Little Conqueror / Little Hegemon-King&quot; () and compared favourably to Xiang Yu by a contemporary just like his historical counterpart. Sun Ce is best known for his conquests in the Jiangdong region that laid the foundation of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period.

In another 14th-century classical novel &quot;Water Margin&quot;, Zhou Tong, one of the 108 Stars of Destiny, is nicknamed &quot;Little Conqueror&quot; for having an appearance similar to Xiang Yu&#x27;s.

In the 16th-century novel &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot;, Xiang Yu is mentioned as an example of a tragic character in the song at the opening of the first chapter.

The character Mata Zyndu in Ken Liu&#x27;s epic fantasy novel &quot;The Grace of Kings&quot; is based on Xiang Yu.

===Operas===
The Beijing opera &quot;The Hegemon-King Bids His Lady Farewell&quot; depicts the events of Xiang Yu&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Gaixia. The title of the play was borrowed as the Chinese title for Chen Kaige&#x27;s 1993 award-winning film &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;.

===Film and television===
Notable actors who have portrayed Xiang Yu in films and television series include: Shek Sau in &quot;The Battlefield&quot; (1985); Ray Lui in &quot;The Great Conqueror&#x27;s Concubine&quot; (1994); Hu Jun in &quot;The Story of Han Dynasty&quot; (2003); Kwong Wah in &quot;The Conqueror&#x27;s Story&quot; (2004); Tan Kai in &quot;The Myth&quot; (2010); Feng Shaofeng in &quot;White Vengeance&quot; (2011); Peter Ho in &quot;King&#x27;s War&quot; (2012); Ming Dao in &quot;Beauties of the Emperor&quot; (2012); Daniel Wu in &quot;The Last Supper&quot; (2012); and Qin Junjie in &quot;The Legend of Qin&quot; (2015).

<text>The Chiefs of Staff Committee (CSC) is composed of the most senior military personnel in the British Armed Forces who advise on operational military matters and the preparation and conduct of military operations. The committee consists of the Chief of the Defence Staff who is the chairman and professional head of the forces, the Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff, who is the vice-chairman and deputy professional head of the armed forces. The committee also consists of the professional heads of each branch of the armed forces: the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, the Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff.

==History==
The Chiefs of Staff Committee was initially established as a sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1923. It remained as such until the abolition of the CID upon the outbreak of World War II in 1939. The initial composition of the committee was the professional heads of the three services, the First Sea Lord, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff. Each service head took turns being chairman of the committee.

During the Second World War the committee was a sub-committee of the War Cabinet, and in addition to the three service chiefs, it had an additional member, in the person of General Sir Hastings Ismay, who acted as its secretary. Subcommittees of the committee were also formed, including the Joint Planning Staff and Joint Intelligence Committee. The Chiefs of Staff Committee was responsible for the overall conduct of the British Armed Forces part of the war effort. When matters required joint Anglo-American decision, the Chiefs of Staff Committee members formed part of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, meeting in concert with their American counterparts, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Combined Chiefs of Staff were based in Washington, so for most of the time the Chiefs of Staff were represented at meetings by the British Joint Staff Mission.

Following World War II, the Chiefs of Staff Committee was transferred to the Ministry of Defence.

In 1955 the Government decided to create the post of Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The post came into existence on 1 January 1956 and the only incumbent was Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir William Dickson who served until 1 January 1959 when he became the first Chief of the Defence Staff. The CDS remained as chairman of the committee and was also recognized as the professional head of the British Armed Forces. In 1964, the post of Chief of the Imperial General Staff was discontinued and the Army was thereafter represented by the Chief of the General Staff. Since then, the only major changes have been the appointment of the Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff to act as a deputy to the CDS and the inclusion of the Commander, Joint Forces Command on the committee.

<doc id="822340" wikidata="Q141445" url="?curid=822340" title="Hudson, Quebec">
<text>Hudson is an off-island suburb of Montreal, with a population of 5,411 (2021 Census). It is located on the south-west bank of the lower Ottawa River, in Vaudreuil-Soulanges Regional County Municipality. Situated about west of downtown Montreal, many residents commute to work on the Island of Montreal.

Hudson is a municipality within Greater Montreal. An informal rural agglomeration since the early part of the 19th century, the Town of Hudson was formally created in June 1969 by merging the villages of Hudson, Hudson Heights and Como. A relatively wealthy town, Hudson is known for its large, turn-of-the century houses, many of which border the Lake of Two Mountains. A ferry from Hudson takes cars across the lake (a widening of the Ottawa River) to the village of Oka.

Hudson has been compared to culturally and demographically similar Quebec towns such as the Eastern Townships villages of North Hatley and Brome Lake as well as nearby Senneville. All four municipalities border a body of water (used extensively for recreation year-round) and include a blend of French and English residents.

== Geography ==

Hudson is near the edge of suburban Montreal to the east, but also surrounded by substantial farming and forest areas to the west. Large lot sizes, enforced by town bylaws, contribute to the relatively large number of trees in the residential areas. Zoning, infrastructure and building development are occasionally controversial subjects, such as when town residents voted against permitting Gheorghe Zamfir to build a concert hall near the edge of town in the 1980s. In 2001, the town won a victory in Canada&#x27;s Supreme Court, upholding its by-law 207, which bans pesticide use on public and private property for cosmetic (purely aesthetic) purposes.

The municipal territory of Hudson is delimited as follows:
* with the limit of Saint-Placide;
* with the limit of Oka;
* with the limit of Vaudreuil-Dorion;
* with the limit of Rigaud.

Thus, the northern limit of Hudson stretches over in the middle of Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes, i.e. between Pointe Graham (west side) facing Saint-Placide and Pointe Cavagnal (side East) facing Oka. This shoreline strip of land is of a width varying between (to the east) up to a maximum of to the west.

===Physical environment===
The bedrock under Hudson is Cambrian Period sandstone. This is overlain by marine clay or stony sandy loam glacial till. On the surface are sands which were deposited by air or water. Most of Hudson is built on the Ste-Sophie loamy fine sand, which is well drained and drought-prone despite its clay base; undisturbed areas have classic podzol development. Several blocks away from the river the sands become deeper, coarser and even more xeric; they are mapped as Upland sand which is also a podzol.

==History==
The local post office opened in 1841, originally named Pointe-à-Cavagnol in honour of Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil de Cavagnial. In 1845, a glass factory was established there by George Matthews, whose wife was called Elisa Hudson. Her name was adopted by the post office in 1865.

In 1877, the Village Municipality of Como was formed when it separated from Vaudreuil. This village was named after Lake Como in Italy due to its scenic location on Lake of Two Mountains. It was renamed to Hudson in 1921.

4 years later, in 1925, the new Village Municipality of McNaughton was split off from Hudson. The following year, Hudson was renamed to Hudson Heights, and McNaughton took the name Hudson.

In June 1969, the Town of Hudson was formed by amalgamating the village municipalities of Hudson, Hudson Heights, and Como (which was originally formed as Como-Est in 1918).

In April 2023, 2898 Hudson residents lost power when an historic ice storm swept through southern Quebec.

===Pesticide Ban===
The town gained notoriety in 1991 by becoming the first in Quebec, Canada to ban several forms of lawn and garden pesticides used to kill insects and weeds. The town was sued by two pesticide companies and on June 28, 2001, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the town&#x27;s favour. The Hudson example spurred many other municipalities and provinces in Canada to enact similar bans of pesticides. The Hudson case is the subject of a 2009 American documentary movie titled &quot;A Chemical Reaction&quot; by filmmaker Brett Plymale.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Hudson had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
Unlike the surrounding mainly French-speaking municipalities, Hudson has a predominantly English-speaking population (65% according to the 2011 Census), although many residents speak both languages.

== Events and tourist attractions ==

Tourist attractions of Hudson include:
* Artistes Hudson Artists, Quebec&#x27;s oldest continuing English language art club
* Hudson &amp; Region Studio Tour

===Hudson Yacht Club===
The Hudson Yacht Club (HYC) is a boating and social club founded in 1909 on the shores of Lake of Two Mountains (Lac des Deux Montagnes). The club annually hosts the &quot;FruitBowl&quot; regatta for young sailors and the Labour Day Regatta for its general membership and visitors. The HYC has published two retrospectives: &quot;Hudson Yacht Club: Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Year&quot; in 1984 and &quot;Our Spirit Lives On: A Celebration of Hudson Yacht Club&#x27;s First 100 Years, 1909-2009&quot; in 2009.

==Government==

===Municipal council===
The Quebec &quot;Cities and Towns Act&quot; requires all towns the size of Hudson to have a municipal council of six councillors and one mayor, elected by the local population every four years. The mayor is elected by all Hudson residents, while the town is divided into six wards to elect the councillors. Given the small size of the town, council seats are often won by acclamation. Council meets once per month in the Stephen Shaar Community Centre, named after the mayor who served until 2004 (and presided over its construction). Municipal administrators work in the Town Hall. Town council is responsible for things such as water supply, local road maintenance, zoning, construction permits, and administration of parks. Some responsibilities, such as regional planning, is shared with the county. Council receives its revenues through property taxes, which it establishes. The town maintains its own volunteer fire department and a local patrol to enforce municipal by-laws.

===Former mayors===
List of former mayors:
* George N. Armstrong (1969–1973)
* Job Taylor Bradbury (1973–1989)
* Gilbert Michael Elliott (1989–1993, 2009–2013)

* Jamie Nicholls (2017–2021)
* Chloe Hutchison (2021–present)

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
A single street, Main Road, traverses Hudson east to west, while the southern border of the town mainly runs along Quebec Route 342 (also known as Boulevard Harwood). Although many residents commute by automobile, a commuter train to Montreal (Vaudreuil-Hudson Line) stops in Hudson once per weekday in either direction.

The town is also served by the 21 bus from the Exo La Presqu&#x27;Île, terminating at the Vaudreuil train station.

====Ferry to Oka====

Since 1909, a ferry across the Lake of Two Mountains has run from Hudson to Oka during the spring, summer and fall. Ferries are self-propelled and take ten to fifteen minutes to carry multiple automobiles, bike passengers, and foot passengers for a fee. Prior to the change to self-propelled ferries, a system of barges were towed across the lake by ropes attached to diesel powered tugboats.

During the winter months, a tolled ice bridge allows vehicular traffic between the two towns.

===Water and sewage===
Hudson has a municipal water and sewage system. The sewage system was built in the first decade of the 21st century and serves the central area of town. It is relatively common for houses outside the central area to use well water and/or a septic tank.

===Municipal facilities===

The town operates the Stephen Shaar Community Centre, teen centre (in the lower level of the community centre) and a municipal outdoor swimming pool. The town also has a number of parks, including St. Thomas Park (soccer fields behind the swimming pool), Thompson park (lakeside soccer fields), Benson Park (with a softball field, children&#x27;s playground with outdoor hockey and skating rinks), Jack Layton Park (trails to Sandy Beach, picnic area and public boat launch) and Sandy Beach.

== Education==
The town has three schools, of which two are English (Mount Pleasant Elementary School &amp; Westwood Senior, formerly Hudson High School) and one French (St-Thomas Elementary School), as well as six churches: one Baptist (Hudson Community Baptist Church ), one Catholic (St-Thomas Aquinas), two Anglican (St-James &amp; St-Mary&#x27;s), one United (Wyman), and one Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America (Hudson-Saint-Lazare)

<doc id="822342" wikidata="Q918320" url="?curid=822342" title="British South Africa Company">
<text>The British South Africa Company (BSAC or BSACo) was chartered in 1889 following the amalgamation of Cecil Rhodes&#x27; Central Search Association and the London-based Exploring Company Ltd, which had originally competed to capitalize on the expected mineral wealth of Mashonaland but united because of common economic interests and to secure British government backing. The company received a Royal Charter modelled on that of the British East India Company. Its first directors included The 2nd Duke of Abercorn, Rhodes himself, and the South African financier Alfred Beit. Rhodes hoped BSAC would promote colonisation and economic exploitation across much of south-central Africa, as part of the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;. However, his main focus was south of the Zambezi, in Mashonaland and the coastal areas to its east, from which he believed the Portuguese could be removed by payment or force, and in the Transvaal, which he hoped would return to British control.

It has been suggested that Rhodes&#x27; ambition was to create a zone of British commercial and political influence from &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot;, but this was far beyond the resources of any commercial company to achieve and would not have given investors the financial returns they expected. The BSAC was created in the expectation that the gold fields of Mashonaland would provide funds for the development of other areas of Central Africa, including the mineral wealth of Katanga. When the expected wealth of Mashonaland did not materialise and Katanga was acquired by the Congo Free State, the company had little money left for significant development after building railways, particularly in areas north of the Zambezi. BSAC regarded its lands north of the Zambezi as territory to be held as cheaply as possible for future, rather than immediate, exploitation.

As part of administering Southern Rhodesia until 1923 and Northern Rhodesia until 1924, the BSAC formed what were originally paramilitary forces, but which later included more normal police functions. In addition to the administration of Southern and Northern Rhodesia, the BSAC claimed extensive landholdings and mineral rights in both the Rhodesias and, although its land claims in Southern Rhodesia were nullified in 1918, its land rights in Northern Rhodesia and its mineral rights in Southern Rhodesia had to be bought out in 1924 and 1933 respectively, and its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia lasted until 1964. The BSAC also created the Rhodesian railway system and owned the railways there until 1947.

==Corporate history==

===Royal charter===
The Royal Charter of the British South Africa Company (BSAC) came into effect on 20 December 1889. This was initially for a period of 25 years, later extended for a further 10 years, thus it expired in 1924.

The company had been incorporated in October 1888, and much of the time after Rhodes arrived in London in March 1889 (and before its Charter was granted) was taken up in discussions on its terms. In these discussions, Rhodes led the BSAC negotiators. Although the British government broadly supported the scheme, it demanded that it and the High Commissioner for Southern Africa it appointed should have the ultimate responsibility for any territory BSAC might acquire and for approving or rejecting all BSAC actions. Although Clause 3 of the Charter appeared to grant BSAC powers to administer a wide (if unspecified) area of Central Africa on behalf of the British government, this was subject to it obtaining those powers through treaties with local rulers. Under Clauses 4 and 9, the British government also had to accept those treaties and agree to assume any powers to govern that the rulers had granted before authorising BSAC to exercise those powers in its behalf.

===Board divisions===
The BSAC was an amalgamation of a London-based group headed by Lord Gifford and George Cawston and backed financially by Baron Nathan de Rothschild, and Rhodes and his South African associates including Alfred Beit with the resources of the De Beers Syndicate and Gold Fields of South Africa. These two groups had originally been in competition but united because of common economic interests. Gifford and Cawston&#x27;s interests were represented by the Bechuanaland Exploration Company and its offshoot, the Exploring Company. Rhodes and his associates secured the Rudd Concession from the Ndebele king, Lobengula, which was transferred to the Central Search Association (later renamed United Concession Company), and the Exploring Company was given approximately one-quarter of the shares in it. The British South Africa Company leased mineral rights from the Central Search Association, paying it half the net profits from mineral exploitation.

From the start, Gifford disliked Rhodes, who he thought had acquired too much power in BSAC and had marginalised him. Cawston supported Rhodes only in those commercial activities likely to make a profit and not in any less commercial ventures. The four other directors were appointed to represent the other shareholders. The dukes of Abercorn and of Fife, respectively chairman and vice-chairman were appointed to give the company prestige but they took little part in running the company. Neither had previous interest in Africa and Fife had no business experience. Albert Grey, later Earl Grey had an active role as a liaison between Rhodes in South Africa and government officials in London. He and Horace Farquhar, a prominent London banker, completed the first Board.

===The Jameson Raid and after===

Sir Henry Loch, the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, had planned the overthrow of the Transvaal Government in the event of an uprising in Johannesburg by British subjects denied civil and political rights as early as 1893, and the Colonial Secretary, Lord Ripon, did nothing to discourage this. Loch&#x27;s successor as High Commissioner from 1895, Sir Hercules Robinson inherited these plans, but neither Loch, Robinson or Ripon took any steps to promote such an uprising . Joseph Chamberlain, who succeeded Ripon in 1895, was almost certainly aware that Rhodes was planning an uprising, but not the details. Rhodes and Jameson made plans to assist, and probably to promote, a Johannesburg uprising. Earl Grey was the only London-based director to know about plans for the Jameson Raid, and he, like Rhodes and Beit, did not share this knowledge with the other BSAC directors. Grey communicated at least some of the plan to Joseph Chamberlain, who avoided specifically endorsing it.

News of the Raid shocked the BSAC directors who, except for Beit and Grey, knew nothing of the plan. Rhodes at first denied responsibility for Jameson&#x27;s actions but, in the face of further revelations, he assumed full responsibility for them. The BSAC Board recognised that the company would be attacked, and asked Rhodes to come to London to meet them. At a Board meeting of 5 February 1896, Rhodes claimed that he had given Jameson permission to support an uprising only, not to start one, and that he believed had the support of the British government. He offered to resign as managing director, but a decision on this was deferred despite the demands of Cawston and Gifford for its acceptance. However, after the trial of the Jameson raiders implicated Rhodes further and following pressure from Chamberlain, Rhodes and Beit were removed as directors in June 1896.

After his removal, Rhodes remained a major shareholder in the BSAC and he continued to be involved unofficially in its affairs. In 1898, the Duke of Fife and Lord Farquhar both resigned from the Board; Rhodes and Beit replaced them and another supporter of Rhodes also joined the Board. As Rhodes had recaptured full control over the company, Cawston decided to resign. Lord Gifford, however, remained on the Board, which Rhodes dominated until his death.

===After Rhodes===
Rhodes retained effective control of the BSAC until his death in 1902, but after the Jameson Raid the company&#x27;s relations with the Colonial Office over Rhodesia were difficult, as the Colonial Office was unwilling to recognise the company had to give priority to its commercial interests rather than administration. After Rhodes&#x27; death, the BSAC directors attempted to make the company commercially profitable, but until 1924 it was deeply unprofitable because its administrative costs outweighed its commercial income, and it never paid a dividend in that period. After a financial crisis in Britain in 1908, the value of its shares declined sharply: its share capital had to be increased from £6 million to £12 million between 1908 and 1912, and it needed large loans to stay in business. As the accumulated deficits increased, the value of the shares continued to decline until the 1920s.

From around 1920, the company favoured a union of Southern and Northern Rhodesia, followed by their inclusion in the Union of South Africa, and it was in discussion with South African leaders about this. South Africa offered favourable terms for buying out the BSAC&#x27;s interests, and the company would be relieved of any future administrative costs. The BSAC did not want to be left with responsibility for the administration of Northern Rhodesia when Southern Rhodesia gained responsible government, but did want to preserve its commercial interests there, in particular its mining and land rights. To do this, it had to negotiate a settlement with the British government for both parts of Rhodesia. The two parties began negotiations in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion at the end of 1922, but nevertheless reached an agreement of 29 September 1923 to settle all the outstanding questions on Southern and Northern Rhodesia.

From 1925 until his death in 1937 Sir Henry Birchenough, a former director of the company, served as president.

After 1924 the BSAC&#x27;s rights allowed it to collect vast sums in royalties, particularly from the development of the Northern Rhodesian Copperbelt, from the late 1920s until its mineral rights were liquidated just before Zambian independence in 1964. In the 1930s, the BSAC was able to collect royalties on all copper mined and was a large shareholder in the main mining companies. Until decolonization, the company therefore became a very lucrative investment opportunity, yielding very high return to investors.

==Territorial acquisitions==

===Rhodesia===

The first stage in acquiring territory was to enter into treaties with local rulers. Although the Ndebele king, Lobengula, had agreed not to enter into a treaty with any other power without prior British consent, and had granted mining concessions to the BSAC (including the right for the company to protect them), he consistently refused to delegate any general powers of government to the British South Africa Company. However, the BSAC convinced the Colonial Office that it should declare a protectorate on the basis that a group of citizens of the Transvaal Republic led by Louis Adendorff planned to cross the Limpopo River to settle and proclaim a republic in Mashonaland. A protectorate was proclaimed by an Order-in-Council of 9 May 1891, initially covering Mashonaland and later Matabeleland. The Adendorff party did attempt to cross the Limpopo in June 1891, but was turned back by a force of the BSAC police.

The Lozi of the Barotseland formed a kingdom whose king, Lewanika had begun his rule in 1876, but had been driven from power in 1884. After his return in 1885, his concerns about further internal power struggles and the threat of Ndebele raids prompted him to seek European protection. He asked François Coillard of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, which had set up a mission to the Lozi, to help him draft a petition seeking a British protectorate. This reached the Colonial Office in August 1889, but no immediate action was taken to accept it. Even before this, Cecil Rhodes, while attempting to obtain a Royal Charter for the BSAC, considered Barotseland as a suitable area for company operations and as a gateway to the copper deposits of Katanga. Rhodes sent Frank Lochner to Barotseland to obtain a concession and made an offer to the British government to pay the expenses of a Barotseland protectorate. Lochner sponsored the misconception that BSAC represented the British government, and on 27 June 1890, Lewanika gave his consent to an exclusive mineral concession. This (the Lochner Concession) gave the company mining rights over the whole of the area in which Lewanika was paramount ruler in exchange for an annual subsidy and the promise of British protection, a promise that Lochner had no authority to give. However, the BSAC advised the Foreign Office that the Lozi had accepted British protection.

The Foreign Office had reservations over the nature and extent of the supposed protectorate and it never sanctioned the Lochner Concession, because it did not grant BSAC any administrative rights and it involved monopolies, prohibited in the BSAC Charter. However, in negotiations with the Portuguese government, Barotseland was claimed to fall within the British sphere of influence and the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 allocated the Barotse Kingdom&#x27;s territory to the British sphere, although the boundary with Angola was not fixed until 1905. Lewanika protested that the terms of the treaty had been misrepresented to him. No BSAC Administrator was sent to Barotseland until 1895, and the first Administrator, Forbes who remained until 1897, did little to establish an administration. As the Foreign Office was not convinced that the Lochner Concession had established a British protectorate over Barotseland or given BSAC any rights to administer the territory, it considered that a new concession was necessary. It agreed in 1896 that a BSAC official would be appointed as Resident Commissioner to secure this concession. The first appointee died before taking up his post, but in October 1897, Robert Coryndon reached Barotseland as Resident Commissioner. Coryndon, a former secretary of Cecil Rhodes and member of the Pioneer Column, had been proposed by the BSAC, and his appointment was approved by the High Commissioner for South Africa as representing the British government. In his capacity as Resident, Coryndon declared Barotseland to be a British protectorate, resolving its previously anomalous position. Coryndon also confirmed that the 1890 mineral concession gave the BSAC no right to make land grants. In 1897 Lewanika signed a new concession (the Coryndon Concession) that gave the BSAC the rights to make land grants and to establish jurisdiction in parallel to the king&#x27;s courts. Next, in 1900, Lewanika signed a further agreement, (the Barotse Concession), which resolved some details that were in dispute following the earlier concessions and was drafted in terms compatible with the Barotseland-North Western Rhodesia Order in Council, 1899. .

Up to 1899, Northern Rhodesia outside of Barotseland was governed according to the Order-in-Council of 9 May 1891, which did not fix clear boundaries to the area involved. Before 1911, Northern Rhodesia was administered as two separate territories, North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia. The former was recognised as British territory by the Barotseland and North-Western Rhodesia Order-in-Council of 1899 and the later by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order-in-Council of 1900. Both Orders-in-Council regularised the position of the BSAC Administrators, the first of whom for North- Eastern Rhodesia was appointed in 1895. In North-Western Rhodesia the first Administrator was appointed for Barotseland in 1897, becoming Administrator for all North-Western Rhodesia in 1900.

===Other areas===
In 1890, Alfred Sharpe undertook an expedition with the objective of acquiring Katanga. He only managed to make treaties with local rulers in North-Eastern Rhodesia, a number of whom later claimed that the contents of the treaty documents had been misrepresented to them. Katanga became part of the Congo Free State. The boundary between the Congo Free State and British territory was fixed by a treaty in 1894. It was only after this treaty and the appointment of a separate Administrator for North- Eastern Rhodesia in 1895 that the area was brought under effective BSAC control.

The British South Africa Company also considered acquiring interests in Bechuanaland Protectorate and Nyasaland, which was initially called the British Central Africa Protectorate. During negotiations for its charter in 1889, the company discussed the possibilities of taking over the administration of Bechuanaland, which was already a British protectorate, and of working with, and possibly amalgamating with, the African Lakes Company which was operating in Nyasaland. On 29 October 1889, a Royal Charter authorised the formation of the British South Africa Company&#x27;s Police. In the event, BSAC did not take over the administration of Bechuanaland, but from 1892 it took over the cost of the Bechuanaland Border Police, which from 1896 was merged with the British South Africa Police. On 1 Apr 1896 the Bechuanaland Border Police was renamed as the Bechuanaland Mounted Police (BMP).

The African Lakes Company was itself attempting to become a Chartered Company in the late 1880s, and Rhodes discussed its possible amalgamation with the BSAC in 1889. However, the Foreign Office judged the African Lakes Company as unsuitable to administer any territory, and by 1890 BSAC wished to take control of that company rather than amalgamate with it. The Lakes Company directors resisted, but by 1893 they had been ousted. In 1891, the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on the understanding that the BSAC would contribute to the costs of its administration. However, its Commissioner, Harry Johnson, refused to act as a BSAC appointee, in particular on Rhodes&#x27; demand that all Crown lands in the protectorate should be transferred to BSAC control and that Johnson should also facilitate the transfer of African lands to it

===Dispute with Portugal===
At the start of the 19th century, effective Portuguese government in Mozambique was limited to the ports of Mozambique Island, Ibo, Quelimane, Sofala, Inhambane and Lourenço Marques and the outposts at Sena and Tete in the Zambezi valley. Although Portugal claimed sovereignty over Angoche and a number of smaller Muslim coastal towns, these were virtually independent. In the Zambezi valley, Portugal had also initiated the Prazo system of large leased estates under nominal Portuguese rule. By the end of the 18th century, this area in the valleys of the Zambezi and lower Shire River were controlled by a few families that claimed to be Portuguese subjects but which were virtually independent. In the interior of what is today southern and central Mozambique, there was not even a pretence of Portuguese control. The nadir of Portuguese fortunes was reached in the 1830s and 1840s with the Zulus&#x27; mfecane sacking of Lourenço Marques in 1833 and Sofala in 1835; Zumbo was abandoned in 1836; Afro-Portuguese settlers near Vila de Sena were forced to pay tribute to the Gaza Empire and Angoche fought off a Portuguese attempt to prevent it from slave-trading in 1847. However, around 1840 the Portuguese government embarked on a series of military campaigns to bring the prazos and the Muslim coastal towns under its effective control.

The General Act of the Berlin Conference dated 26 February 1885, which introduced the principle of effective occupation was potentially damaging to Portuguese claims in Mozambique. Article 34 required a power acquiring land on the coasts of Africa outside of its previous possessions to notify the other signatories of the Act so they could protest against such claims. Article 35 of the Act provided that rights could only be acquired over previously uncolonised lands if the power claiming them had established sufficient authority there to protect existing rights and the freedom of trade. This normally implied making treaties with local rulers, establishing an administration and exercising police powers. Initially, Portugal claimed that the Berlin Treaty did not apply, and it was not required to issue notifications or establish effective occupation, as Portugal&#x27;s claim to the Mozambique coast had existed for centuries and had been unchallenged.

However, British officials did not accept this interpretation, as Henry O&#x27;Neill, the British consul based at Mozambique Island said in January 1884:

&quot;There is a field of action open to [Britain] in South Africa which only a slight political barrier interposes to shut her out from. We refer, of course, to the area of Portuguese rule. This, it is true, at present is an undefinable area. Portugal has been a colonising power only in name. To speak of Portuguese colonies in East Africa is to speak of a mere fiction—a fiction colourably sustained by a few scattered seaboard settlements, beyond whose narrow littoral and local limits colonisation and government have no existence.&quot;

To forestall British designs on the parts of Mozambique and the interior that O&#x27;Neill claimed Portugal did not occupy, Joaquim Carlos Paiva de Andrada was commissioned in 1884 to establish effective occupation, and he was active in four areas. Firstly, in 1884 he established the town of Beira and Portuguese occupation of much of Sofala Province. Secondly, also in 1884, he acquired a concession of an area within a 180 kilometre radius of Zumbo, which had been reoccupied and west of which Afro-Portuguese families had traded and settled since the 1860s. Although Andrada did not establish any administration immediately, in 1889 an outpost was established beyond the junction of the Zambezi and Kafue River and an administrative district of Zumbo was established. Thirdly, in 1889 Andrada was granted another concession over Manica, which covered the areas both of the Manica Province of Mozambique and the Manicaland Province of Zimbabwe. Andrada succeeded in obtaining treaties over much of this area and establishing a rudimentary administration but he was arrested in November 1890 by British South Africa Company troops and expelled. Finally, also in 1889, Andrada crossed northern Mashonaland, approximately the area of the Mashonaland Central Province of Zimbabwe, obtaining treaties. He failed to inform the Portuguese government of these treaties, so these claims were not formally notified to other powers, as required by the Berlin Treaty. The British government refused to submit any disputed claims to arbitration, and on 11 January 1890, Lord Salisbury sent the British Ultimatum of 1890 to the Portuguese government demanded the withdrawal of the Portuguese troops from the areas where Portuguese and British interests in Africa overlapped.

===Fixing boundaries===
The final stage in acquiring territory was to make bi-lateral treaties with other European powers. The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 was an agreement signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891 between the United Kingdom and Portugal. It fixed the boundaries between the territories administered by the British South Africa Company in Mashonaland and Matabeleland, now parts of Zimbabwe, and North-Eastern Rhodesia (now part of Zambia) and Portuguese Mozambique. It divided Manica, granting the western portion to the British South Africa Company. It also fixed the boundaries between the BSAC-administered territory of North-Western Rhodesia (now in Zambia), and Portuguese Angola. The northern border of the British territories was agreed as part of an Anglo-German Convention in 1890. The border between the British Central Africa Protectorate and the territory of the British South Africa Company in what is today Zambia was fixed in 1891 at the drainage divide between Lake Malawi and the Luangwa River.

===Early administration===
The terms of the treaties under which the various protectorates were created north or south of the Zambezi provided for the rulers that signed them to retain significant powers over their own people. Despite this, the British South Africa Company either ended the powers of traditional rulers through warfare or eroded them by encouraging its own officials to take most of them over. By the end of the first decade of the 20th century, those traditional rulers that remained were restricted to largely ceremonial roles only.

The BSAC appointed an Administrator of Mashonaland, who was intended to have a similar function to a colonial governor, and later assistants in charge of districts. The first Administrator, A. R. Colquhoun, was appointed in October 1890, soon after the Pioneer Column had arrived at Fort Salisbury. As first, the British government refused to recognise Colquhoun, and placed the governor of Bechuanaland in immediate charge of the new protectorate, with the High Commissioner for South Africa given oversight of it. The governor legitimated the Administrator in July 1891 by appointing him Chief Magistrate, and as the British government did not want the expense of administration, it acquiesced to BSAC control. The Administrator, as Chief Magistrate, appointed assistants charged with keeping order in the various parts of Mashonaland, and from these a district administration developed. However, under Colquhoun and his successor from August 1891, Leander Starr Jameson, there were less than 20 administrative staff, mostly inexperienced, so government was minimal. As the High Commissioner was usually resident in Cape Town, a Resident Commissioner was appointed to represent him in Rhodesia. The early BSAC Administrators had a dual role, being appointed Administrators by the company and Chief Magistrate by the Crown. Their position was regularised in 1894, when the British government appointed the British South Africa Company to administer what was beginning to be called Rhodesia, which at that time was not split into Northern and Southern sections. A Legislative Council was created in 1898 in Southern Rhodesia to advise the BSAC Administrator and the High Commissioner for South Africa in legal matters.

Administration north of the Zambezi was rudimentary before 1901. In North-Eastern Rhodesia, Abercorn and Fife were fortified outposts and the Administrator of North-Eastern Rhodesia was resident in Blantyre in the British Central Africa Protectorate until Fort Jameson was founded in 1899 as its headquarters. In Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia, there was no Secretariat until 1901.

==Land policies==

===Southern Rhodesia===
After the entry of the Pioneer Column into Southern Rhodesia, the provision of land for European settlers was one of the first matters to be taken up by the British South Africa Company. Matabele authority ceased, freehold ownership of land was introduced, and large tracts were acquired by the BSAC for alienation to Europeans. Jameson, who became Administrator of Mashonaland in 1891, was Rhodes&#x27; appointee and he executed what he thought were Rhodes&#x27; plans with little supervision from Rhodes and none from the BSAC Board in London. Jameson made very large land grants between 1891 and 1893 for little return until the directors&#x27; complaints stopped him (although Rhodes&#x27; approved several other large grants up to 1896). This policy discouraged later settlers, who could only acquire good quality land at a high price from these grantees.

As English law applied in both in Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia, all land that had not already been alienated should in principle have been Crown land. However, in both territories, BSAC claimed ownership of the land not in other private ownership either because it, not the Crown, had conquered it or under the various concessions it had obtained. It also claimed the right to alienate this land as its owner. In 1890 and 1891, the Colonial Office and the High Commissioner accepted that BSAC had obtained title to the land in Mashonaland. After the Matebele wars, the company also claimed in 1894 to have the right to dispose of all land in Matebeleland, on the basis that the Ndebele king, Lobengula had owned it, but had forfeited it. The Colonial Office objected, but only to the extent of requiring BSAC to reserve sufficient lands for the African population.

In 1894, a Land Commission was appointed to deal with the settlement of Africans on the land. The Commission recommended that two large territories be set aside for native occupation, the Shangani and Gwaai Reserves in Matabeleland, of about 2,486,000 acres. Before the arrival of the Europeans, Africans had held nearly 100,000,000 acres in what became Southern Rhodesia. The Land Commission&#x27;s plan showed such poor judgment, and the bases of allocation were so ill-considered, that the attempt to confine the native population within these two areas was never really practicable. Failure to make suitable provision for African lands may have been one of the prime causes of the Matabele and Mashona rebellions of 1896. Following these rebellions, BSAC was required to assign sufficient land to Southern Rhodesian Africans for their agricultural and pastoral requirements, including access to sufficient water. Native Reserves were set up under this directive, which by 1902 had an estimated indigenous population of 530,000. Although later modifications were made, the basic pattern of land allocation persisted until independence. The European district officers who responsible for defining the reserves were advised to allow between 9 and 15 acres of arable land for each family, and adequate pasture, but they had little geographic knowledge of the country and no maps. In 1910, a Native Affairs Committee of Enquiry was set up, which made very few changes. The committee&#x27;s land apportionment was 19 million acres for Europeans and 21.4 million acres for Native Reserves with an African population of about 700,000. A further 51.6 million acres was unassigned, but available for future alienation to Europeans.

In 1918, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council decided in the Southern Rhodesia case that, even although the British South Africa Company may have conquered Mashonaland and Matabeleland, it had acted as an agent of the British Crown, so the land had become Crown land. The court recognised that the indigenous people of what became Southern Rhodesia, had previously owned the land, but had lost it through the BSAC conquest. However, even after the Privy Council decision, the British government allowed BSAC to continue to administer the unalienated lands in Southern Rhodesia and agreed that, when their Charter expired, it was to recover the loss it had incurred in administering the territory either from future sales of these lands or from the British government. In negotiations for the ending of the Charter in 1923, the British government agreed to fund part of this deficit, but placed the obligation to pay off the rest on Southern Rhodesia itself.

In 1920, some smaller reserves were reorganised, and 83 Native Reserves of 21.6 million acres were recognised, which were for the exclusive use and occupation almost 900,000 Africans. Of this total, about 3 million acres were unsuitable for any agricultural use. A review after the end of BSAC administration in 1925 enforced stricter segregation of European and African land, while allowing only a little more land for African use.

===Northern Rhodesia===
In Northern Rhodesia, the BSAC claimed ownership of all the unalienated land in the territory, and the right to alienate it. Europeans occupied land along the line of the railway and near the towns, but generally there was no land shortage, as the population density was lower than in Southern Rhodesia, and the European population was much lower. In 1913, BSAC drew up plans for Native Reserves along Southern Rhodesian lines, outside which Africans would have no right to own or occupy land, but these plans were not implemented until 1928, after company administration ended.

The Privy Council decision on Southern Rhodesia raised questions about the BSAC claim to the unalienated lands north of the Zambezi. However, the company&#x27;s claim in Northern Rhodesia was based on concessions granted rather than conquest and, although a parliamentary Committee in 1921 recommended that these claims also should be referred to the Privy Council, the British government preferred to negotiate an overall settlement for the end of BSAC administration in Northern Rhodesia. This effectively acknowledged the company&#x27;s claim. Under an Agreement of 29 September 1923, the Northern Rhodesian government took over the entire control of lands previously controlled by BSAC from 1 April 1924, paying the company half the net rents and the proceeds of certain land sales.

==Railways==

===Railway policies===
The British South Africa Company was responsible for building the Rhodesian railway system in the period of primary construction which ended in 1911, when the main line through Northern Rhodesia reached the Congo border and the Katanga copper mines. Rhodes&#x27; original intention was for a railway extending across the Zambesi to Lake Tanganyika, popularly considered as part of a great &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot; railway linking all the British colonies of Africa. Rhodes was as much a capitalist in his motivation as a visionary, and when little gold was found in Mashonaland, he accepted that even the scheme to reach Lake Tanganyika had no economic justification. Railways built by private companies without government subsidies need enough of the type of traffic that can pay high freight rates to recover their construction costs. The agricultural products that fuelled much of Rhodesia&#x27;s early economic growth could not provide this traffic; large quantities of minerals could. Most early railways in Africa were built by the British government rather than Chartered Companies. The need to raise capital and produce dividends prevented most Chartered Companies from undertaking such infrastructure investments. However, in the early period of railway construction, the BSAC obtained finance from South African companies including Consolidated Gold Fields and De Beers in which Rhodes was a dominant force. BSAC also benefitted from the large, but not unlimited personal fortunes of Rhodes and Beit before their deaths.

===Development of routes===
Lord Gifford and his Bechuanaland Exploring Company had won the right to construct a private railway north from the terminus of the Cape Government Railways at Kimberley into Bechuanaland in 1888. Rhodes was initially against this extension, in part because Gifford was a competitor but also for reasons of Cape politics. However, when Rhodes and Gifford joined forces, BSAC had to take on this railway obligation to gain its Charter. Rhodes promised that BSAC would spend £500,000 on building a railway through Bechuanaland, half of BSAC&#x27;s total initial share capital. The railway reached Vryburg in 1890, stopping there until 1893 because of the poor financial state of BSAC and disappointing reports about gold in Mashonaland and Matabeleland. BSAC remained cautious about railway building until 1896, when African uprisings threatening its investment made railway links to Southern Rhodesia imperative.

The line from Kimberley reached Bulawayo in 1897, and a connection to Salisbury was completed in 1902. By then Southern Rhodesia already had a rail outlet to the Mozambican port of Beira. This was completed by the Beira Railway Company, a subsidiary company of the BSAC, as a narrow gauge railway as far as Umtali in 1898. In the next year, a line from Salisbury to Umtali was completed which, like the Kimberley to Bulawayo line, was at the Cape gauge of 3 feet 6 inches. The Umtali to Beira section was widened to Cape gauge in 1899 and 1900. These lines were proposed before the economic potential of the Rhodesias was fully known, and in the hope that the expected gold discoveries would promote economic development. Rhodesia&#x27;s gold deposits proved disappointing, and it was the coal of Wankie that first provided the traffic and revenue to fund railway construction to the north. After the discovery of its huge coal reserves, a branch to Wankie from the main line from Bulawayo (which had been extended to cross the Victoria Falls in 1902) was completed in 1903.

The next section was to Broken Hill, which the railway reached in 1906. BSAC was assured that there would be much traffic from its lead and zinc mines, but this did not materialise because technical mining problems. The railway could not meet the costs of the construction loans, and the company faced major financial problems, which were already serious because of the cost of widening the Beira railway. The only area likely to generate sufficient mineral traffic to relieve these debts was Katanga. Initially, the Congo Free State had concluded that Katanga&#x27;s copper deposits were not rich enough to justify the capital cost of building a railway to the coast, but expeditions between 1899 and 1901 proved their value. Copper deposits found in Northern Rhodesia before the First World War proved uneconomic to develop.

In 1906 Union Minière du Haut Katanga was formed to exploit the Katanga mines. King Leopold favoured a railway route entirely in Congolese territory, linked to the Congo River. An Angolan railway from Lobito Bay to Katanga was also proposed, but in 1908, the BSAC agreed with Leopold to continuing the Rhodesian railway to Elizabethville and the mines. Between 1912, when full-scale copper production began, until 1928 when a Congolese line was completed, almost all of Katanga&#x27;s copper was shipped over the Rhodesian network to Beira. Even after the Congo route was opened, up to a third of Katanga&#x27;s copper went to Beira, and the mine&#x27;s the supply of coal and coke mostly came from Wankie, the cheapest available source. This railway&#x27;s revenue from Katanga enabled it to carry agricultural produce at low rates. Large-scale development of the Copperbelt only began in the late 1920s, with an increasing world market for copper. Transport was no problem as only short branches had to be built to connect the Copperbelt to the main line. The Beira route was well established and the BSAC wanted to prevent the Copperbelt companies taking advantage of other routes it did not control. The Benguela Railway to Angola, completed in 1931, provided the shortest, most direct route for copper from both Katanga and Northern Rhodesia, but it was never used to full capacity because both the Congo and the Rhodesias restricted its traffic in favour of their own lines.

When the BSAC administration of the Rhodesias was terminated, an agreement between the Colonial Secretary and the company of 29 September 1923 recognised that BSAC was entitled to protection because of the size of its railway investment in Northern and Southern Rhodesia. The agreement required the governors of each territory to refer any Bill authorising the construction of new railways or altering the rates that the existing railways charged to the Colonial Secretary. This prevented the legislatures of Northern or Southern Rhodesia from introducing competition or exerting pressure on the BSAC-controlled railways to reduce rates without British government sanction.

===Railways and the settlers===
European settlers had two main criticisms of British South Africa Company railway policy. Firstly, that its financial arrangements unfairly benefited the company and its shareholders, and secondly, that the settlers paid for these benefits through exorbitant railway rates. Although the allegations were probably ill-founded, they caused tensions between the settlers and the BSAC. On the shorter east coast route from Beira, running expenses were high because of construction debts and because the Mozambique Company, which was granted the original concession to build the railway in 1891, imposed a transit duty of up to 3% on goods destined for Rhodesia in return for the sub-concession to the Beira Railway Company. From 1914, the European settlers had a majority in the Advisory Council, and called for the replacement of BSAC control of the railways through nationalisation. In 1923 responsible government was achieved, but rather outright nationalisation, the settler government opted for a form of public control under the Railway Act of 1926. This left BSAC as owner of the railways, which were called Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways until 1927, and Rhodesia Railways Limited after. This remained the situation until 1947, when the Government of Southern Rhodesia acquired the assets of Rhodesia Railways Limited.

==Commercial activities==

===Early trading===
The company was empowered to trade with African rulers such as King Lobengula; to form banks; to own, manage and grant or distribute land, and to raise a police force (the British South Africa Police). In return, the company agreed to develop the territory it controlled, to respect existing African laws, to allow free trade within its territory and to respect all religions. Rhodes and the white settlers attracted to the company&#x27;s territory set their sights for ever more mineral rights and more territorial concessions from the African peoples, establishing their own governments, and introducing laws with little concern or respect for African laws. The BSAC was not able to generate enough profit to pay its shareholders dividends until after it lost direct administrative control over Rhodesia in 1923.

===Mining===

====BSAC claims====
Initially, the British South Africa Company claimed mineral rights in both Northern and Southern Rhodesia. During the period of its Charter, the BSAC was not involved in mining directly, but received mineral royalties and held shares in mining companies. Often the main source of income of these companies was not in mining itself but in speculation markets. In Moshanaland, complaints arose at the delay of development of mines in order to fuel speculation profits further.

In 1923, the British government agreed that it would take over the administration of both Southern and Northern Rhodesia from BSAC. The Agreement for Southern Rhodesia provided that the company&#x27;s mineral rights there should be granted protection, and any Bill under which the Southern Rhodesian legislature proposed to alter arrangements for collecting mining revenues or imposing any new tax or duty on minerals would require British government. The same condition applied to any Northern Rhodesian legislation. In 1933, the company sold its mineral exploration rights south of the Zambezi to the Southern Rhodesian government, but retained its rights in Northern Rhodesian mineral rights, as well as its interests in mining, railways, real estate and agriculture across southern Africa.

BSAC claimed to own mineral rights over the whole of Northern Rhodesia under one series of concessions granted between 1890 and 1910 by Lewanika covering a poorly defined area of Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia, and under a second series negotiated by Joseph Thomson and Alfred Sharpe in 1890 and 1891 with local chiefs covering a disputed area of North-Eastern Rhodesia. This claim was accepted by the British Government. After the Charter ended, BSAC joined a group of nine South African and British companies which financed the development of Nchanga Mines, to prevent them falling under US control. However, its main concern was to receive royalties.

Ancient surface copper workings were known at Kansanshi (near Solwezi), Bwana Mkubwa and Luanshya, all on what later became known as the Copperbelt, and BSAC exploration in the 1890s indicated there were significant deposits in the area. However, they could not be commercially exploited until a railway had been built. A railway bridge across the Zambezi was constructed in 1903 and the line was continued northward, reaching Broken Hill in 1906, where the lead and zinc vanadium mine was opened, and reaching the Belgian Congo border in 1909. At that time, mining had started in Katanga, where rich copper oxide ores occurred near the surface. In Northern Rhodesia, the surface ores were of poorer quality, and copper was only worked intermittently at Bwana Mkubwa, until in 1924 rich copper sulphide ores were discovered about 100 feet below the surface.

In 1922, the Southern Rhodesian voters rejected the option of inclusion in the Union of South Africa and opted for responsible government: the Northern Rhodesian settlers were not consulted. The BSAC wanted to give up responsibility for administering Northern Rhodesia, but to preserve its mining and land rights by negotiating a settlement with the British government for both parts of Rhodesia. For Northern Rhodesia, the most important provision of that agreement was that the Crown would recognise that BSAC was the owner of the mineral rights acquired under the concessions obtained from Lewanika in North Western Rhodesia Certificates of Claim issued by Harry Johnston in North Eastern Rhodesia.

Under the Northern Rhodesian settlement, the company dropped its claim for reimbursement of a £l.6 million administrative deficit: in return the British Government agreed to give the BSAC half the net revenue from certain rents and land sales and recognised (or appeared to recognise) the company as the owner of Northern Rhodesia&#x27;s mineral rights in perpetuity. The British Government could have bought out these rights by paying BSAC £l.6 million to meet its reimbursement claim, but declined to make the money available. This agreement was criticised then and later time by both African and European inhabitants of the territory. The elected unofficial members of the Legislative Council pressed for the royalties issue to be referred to the Privy Council, as the BSAC&#x27;s title to unalienated land in Southern Rhodesia had been. Instead, for forty years up to Zambian independence, successive British Governments recognised the BSAC as owner of all underground minerals in Northern Rhodesia, and compelled anyone mining them to pay royalties to the company.

In 1923, the Northern Rhodesian copper industry was little developed, and the British government did not anticipate the future value of these mineral rights. It regarded them as a not very important part of the overall deal with the company. The lack of any challenge to the BSAC&#x27;s claims and the decision not to refer them to the Privy Council led to suspicion that the company received favoured treatment. There were family links between a junior Colonial Office minister and the BSAC director leading its negotiations, but no evidence to suggest this led to any bias and the most probable explanation was that the importance of the minerals was overlooked in the haste to achieve a settlement. Because of lack of time, the agreement was not approved by the Attorney-General.

The 1923 Agreement stated that the Crown recognised British South Africa Company mineral rights acquired under the concessions either from Lewanika in Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia or under Certificates of Claim in North-Eastern Rhodesia. These concessions did not cover all of Northern Rhodesia. In particular, they could not have conveyed mineral rights in the area of the Copperbelt from which most of the BSAC&#x27;s royalties came, as the Copperbelt was outside these areas. However, the British Government had legal advice that the Colonial Office&#x27;s recognition of the BSAC&#x27;s rights in practice over a long period, and specific recognition of those rights in Rhodesia mining legislation, prevented it from challenging the rights.

====Claims disputed====
The first attempts to challenge BSAC royalty claims were made by the Governor of Northern Rhodesia between 1935 and 1937. The Governor, Sir Hubert Young, attempted to convince the Colonial Office that BSAC only owned mineral rights in the areas of the concessions from Lewanika and the Certificates of Claim from Johnston. This excluded most of the Copperbelt, as the area east of the Kafue River had never been ruled by Lewanika. The Colonial Office response was that BSAC ownership of mineral rights throughout Northern Rhodesia had been accepted in practice, and the references to the Lewanika concessions and Certificates of Claim should not be interpreted in a narrow sense.

Northern Rhodesian settler politicians were not convinced by the Colonial Office arguments, in particular the suggestion that, since the British government had previously recognised the BSAC claims, it could not challenge them now on the basis of a reinterpretation of terms of the 1923 agreement. Settler representatives proposed either that the BSAC mineral rights should be bought out or that punitive levels of tax should be imposed on BSAC royalties. After years of BSAC obstruction, the company was forced to agree in 1950 that it would surrender their mineral rights in 1986 without compensation, and meanwhile give 20% of its royalties to the Northern Rhodesian government.

The 1950 agreement continued through the period of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, but at the end of Federation in 1963 the African leaders of what became Zambia sought its revision, proposing to buy out the British South Africa Company&#x27;s mineral rights for a lump sum. The BSAC refused, and the Northern Rhodesian government of Kenneth Kaunda commissioned a full legal enquiry into the validity of the company&#x27;s claims. The results were published as a White Paper which considered the validity of commercial rights held and exercised under the colonial legislative and administrative system.

The Northern Rhodesian government argued that many of the treaties on which BSAC relied were of doubtful validity and probably could not have effectively transferred mineral rights. Even if the treaties were valid, none if them covered the Copperbelt, and any subsequent agreements merely confirmed the company&#x27;s rights if they were originally valid: they did not give the treaties retrospective validity. It further argued that, as the British government had wrongly allowed the BSAC to claim royalties it was not entitled to, the British government should pay any compensation it thought the company was due, and not place this burden on an independent Zambia. Shortly before the planned date for independence of 24 October 1964, Kaunda threatened to expropriate the BSAC immediately afterwards if no agreement were reached. On 23 October, BSAC agreed to give up any mineral rights it might have in return for compensation of £4 million, the British and Zambian governments paying half each.

===Financial returns===
Traders of B.S.A.C stock profited handsomely from the speculative trading of the stock which was trading for multiple times higher that its nominal book value on the LSE and the Rhodesian Stock Exchange which was initiated in the Masonic Assembly Room on 20 June 1894.A History of the Zimbabwean Stock Exchange
An investor who invested in the original one million shares at £1 each and participated in each rights issue up to 1904, would have paid an average of £1.66 for each share. No dividends were received before 1924, but from then the average annual dividend for the next 26 years was 7.5 pence, a poor rate of return. However, from 1950, dividend rates increased sharply, reaching 75 pence a share in 1960, largely from Northern Rhodesian copper royalties. Each share was split two-for-one in 1955 and each of the new shares was exchanged for three Charter Consolidated shares at the beginning of 1965.

==Security==
Clause 3 of the BSAC Charter allowed the company to obtain powers necessary for the preservation of public order in, or for the protection of, the territories comprised in its concessions, and Clause 10 allowed the company to establish and maintain a police force. This did not permit the formation of an army but BSAC created a paramilitary force of mounted infantrymen in 1889 which was virtually its army and which allowed it to defeat and replace the Matabele kingdom and then overcome resistance of the Shona north of the Limpopo river in the First Matabele War and Second Matabele War. It was the first British use of the Maxim gun in combat (causing five thousand Ndebele casualties). The company carved out and administered a territory which it named &quot;Zambezia&quot;, and later, Rhodesia, which now covers the area occupied by the republics of Zambia and Zimbabwe.

===Southern Rhodesia===

At first, the BSAC force was named the British South Africa Company&#x27;s Police, but from 1896 it was called the British South Africa Police. The Colonial Office initially authorised a force of 100 men, but Rhodes increased this to 480 before the Pioneer Column entered Mashonaland. Its numbers had risen to 650 men by the end of 1890, an unsustainable burden on the BSAC resources. Rhodes ordered a reduction in its manpower to 100 at the end of 1891, and later to only 40 men. This was supplemented by the Mashonaland Horse, an unpaid volunteer force of up to 500 men. The police force was greatly increased in size at the time of the First Matabele War, although much if this increase was in the form of volunteer police reservists.

Although the police force had been created by the BSAC and was at first under the command of a company official, after the Jameson Raid it was renamed the British South Africa Police and ceased to be a company force. From then, it reported to the British High Commissioner for South Africa, not the BSAC, and was commanded by a British-appointed officer. This British South Africa Police had four divisions: two policed the countryside (but not the towns) of Matabeleland and of Mashonaland, another covered &quot;North Zambesia&quot; until the creation of the Barotse Native Police in 1899 and the fourth dealt with Bechuanaland until its own police force was formed in 1903. Also in 1903, the previously separate urban police forces were combined as the Southern Rhodesia Constabulary and handed over to BSAC control. In 1909, the Matabeleland and Mashonaland divisions were handed back to BSAC control and the separate urban police force was amalgamated with the British South Africa Police. Only in 1909 did the British South Africa Police constitute a police force for the whole of Southern Rhodesia and for Southern Rhodesia only. The British South Africa Police was initially formed as a wholly European force, but in 1903 an African unit was organised as the British South African Native Police. In 1909, this was merged into the British South Africa Police, which thereafter had an increasing number of African police officers. The volunteer forces raised for the Matabele wars and Mashona rebellion were disbanded soon after, but the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers, raised for service in the Boer War, remained in being and in 1914 formed the basis of the 1st and 2nd Rhodesia Regiments. Although these were severely reduced in size after the First World War, they formed the basis of the Rhodesian Territorial Force, set up in 1926 after the end of BSAC administration.

===Northern Rhodesia===

The BSAC considered that its territory north of the Zambezi was more suitable for a largely African police force than a European one. However, at first the British South Africa Police patrolled the north of the Zambezi in North Western Rhodesia, although its European troops were expensive and prone to diseases. This force and its replacements were paramilitaries, although there was a small force of European civil police in the towns. The British South Africa Police were replaced by the Barotse Native Police force, which was formed in 1902 (other sources date this as 1899 or 1901). This had a high proportion of European NCOs as well as all European officers and was merged into the Northern Rhodesia Police in 1911. Initially, Harry Johnson in the British Central Africa Protectorate had responsibility for North Eastern Rhodesia and Central Africa forces, including Sikh and African troops, were used there until 1899. Until 1903, local magistrates recruited their own local police, but in that year a North Eastern Rhodesia Constabulary was formed, which had only a few white officers, all its NCOs and troopers being African. This was also merged into the Northern Rhodesia Police in 1912, which then numbered only 18 European and 775 African in six companies, divided between the headquarters of the various districts. The Northern Rhodesia Police remained after the end of BSAC administration.

===Medal===
In 1896, Queen Victoria sanctioned the issue by the British South Africa Company of a medal to troops who had been engaged in the First Matabele War. In 1897, the Queen sanctioned another medal for those engaged in the two campaigns of the Second Matabele War: Rhodesia (1896) and Mashonaland (1897). The government of Southern Rhodesia re-issued the medal to commemorate the earlier 1890 Pioneer Column, in 1927.
==Politics==

===Legislature and administration===
A legislative council for Southern Rhodesia was created in 1898 to advise the BSAC Administrator and the High Commissioner for South Africa on legal matters. Initially, this had a minority of elected seats, and the electorate was formed almost exclusively of those better-off white settlers who held BSAC shares. Over time as more settlers arrived, disputes between settlers and BSAC grew, and the company attempted to keep these in check by extending the franchise to some non-shareholders. However, in 1914, the Royal Charter was renewed on condition that settlers in Southern Rhodesia were given increased political rights, and from 1914, there was an elected majority on the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council.

In Northern Rhodesia, there was neither an Executive Council nor a legislative council, but only an Advisory Council, which until 1917 consisted entirely of officials. After 1917 and a few nominees were added to represent the small European minority: Northern Rhodesia had no elected representation while under BSAC rule. Provision for elected unofficial members was only made after BSAC rule there came to an end in 1924. In both parts of Rhodesia, the BSAC Administrators were required to submit all draft Proclamations affecting Europeans to the High Commissioner for South Africa for approval before they were issued. The High Commissioner could in theory, and subject to certain restrictions, also make, alter or repeal Proclamations for the administration of justice, the raising of revenue, and for the peace, order and good government of either territory, without reference to their Administrators, although this power was never used.

The British South Africa Company was planning to centralise the administration of the two Rhodesias at the time of the Jameson Raid in 1896. Following the raid, the British government increased its oversight of BSAC affairs in Southern Rhodesia, and insisted on a separate administration in Northern Rhodesia. In both 1915 and 1921, BSAC again failed to set up a single administration for both Rhodesias. In part, this was because the Southern Rhodesian settlers feared that it more would be difficult for a united Rhodesian state to achieve responsible government.

===Self-government===
In 1917, the Responsible Government Association was formed as a political party to press for responsible government, and fought the 1920 Legislative Council election in opposition to those advocating union with the Union of South Africa. When the British courts decided that the ultimate ownership of all land which had not already been alienated into private ownership lay with the Crown, not with BSAC, the campaign a self-government gained strength.

In 1921, General Smuts and his government wished for the early admission of Southern Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa. When the Union was established, Natal and the Free State were given representation in the Union Parliament considerably in excess of the number of their electors, and Smuts promised that this would apply in the case of Rhodesia, which would receive 12 to 15 seats in the Union Parliament, which then had 134 members. Smuts also promised that South Africa would make the financial provision necessary to buy out the commercial rights of the BSAC. If those rights continued under responsible government, they would create a serious financial problem for that government. In 1922, the company entered negotiations with the Union government for the incorporation of Southern Rhodesia. However, as the BSAC charter was due to expire in 1924, a referendum was held in 1922 in which the electorate was given a choice between responsible government and entry into the Union of South Africa. Those in favour of responsible government won a significant, but not overwhelming, majority. In 1923, the British government chose not to renew the company&#x27;s charter, and instead accorded self-governing colony status to Southern Rhodesia and protectorate status to Northern Rhodesia.

===The end of BSAC administration===
An agreement of 29 September 1923 between the British South Africa Company and the Colonial Secretary settled the outstanding issues relating to Southern and Northern Rhodesia. It terminated the company&#x27;s administration of Northern Rhodesia by the British South Africa Company as from 1 April 1924: Northern Rhodesia continued to be a protectorate, but now governed by a Governor. All laws were to continue in force, and all rights reserved to indigenous peoples under treaties they had made with BSAC also continued in force. From 1 April 1924, control of all lands that the company claimed in Northern Rhodesia, were taken over by the Northern Rhodesian administration, to administer in the interests of their African populations, but BSAC were to receive half the net rents from these lands.

==Merger==

In 1964, the company handed over its mineral rights to the government of Zambia, and the following year, the business of the British South Africa Company was merged with the Central Mining &amp; Investment Corporation Ltd and The Consolidated Mines Selection Company Ltd into the mining and industrial business of Charter Consolidated Ltd, of which slightly over one-third of the shares were owned by the British/South African mining company Anglo American Corporation. In the 1980s the company disposed of its overseas mining concerns to concentrate on its British engineering interests.

In 1993 Charter Consolidated Ltd changed its name to Charter plc, and in 2008 to Charter Limited, which is incorporated in England and Wales, Company Number 02794949. The British South Africa Company still exists (though, its last annual return filing was in 2011), and is registered as a non-trading business incorporated in England and Wales, Company Number ZC000011.

<doc id="822350" wikidata="Q568837" url="?curid=822350" title="Feralia">
<text>Ferālia was an ancient Roman public festival celebrating the Manes (Roman spirits of the dead, particularly the souls of deceased individuals) which fell on 21 February as recorded by Ovid in Book II of his &quot;Fasti&quot;. This day marked the end of Parentalia, a nine-day festival (13–21 February) honoring the dead ancestors.

Roman citizens were instructed to bring offerings to the tombs of their dead ancestors which consisted of at least &quot;an arrangement of wreaths, a sprinkling of grain and a bit of salt, bread soaked in wine and violets scattered about.&quot; Additional offerings were permitted, however the dead were appeased with just the aforementioned. These simple offerings to the dead were perhaps introduced to Latium by Aeneas, who poured wine and scattered violet flowers on his father Anchises&#x27; tomb. Ovid tells of a time when Romans, in the midst of war, neglected Feralia, which prompted the spirits of the departed to rise from their graves in anger, howling and roaming the streets. After this event, tribute to the tombs were then made and the ghastly hauntings ceased. To indicate public mourning, marriages of any kind were prohibited on the Feralia, and Ovid urged mothers, brides, and widows to refrain from lighting their wedding torches. Magistrates stopped wearing their insignia and any worship of the gods was prohibited as it &quot;should be hidden behind closed temple doors; no incense on the altar, no fire on the hearth.&quot;

==Rites and tradition==
As concerns public rites nothing of them survives, however on this day as described by Ovid, an old drunken woman (&quot;anus ebria&quot;) sits in a circle with other girls performing rites in the name of the mute goddess Tacita who is identified with the nymph Lara or Larunda. The ritual consists of the old woman placing three bits of incense, with three of her fingers, beneath a threshold where a mouse is unknowingly buried. She then rolls seven black beans in her mouth, and smears the head of a fish with pitch, impaling it with a bronze needle, and roasting it in a fire. After she formally declaims the purpose of her actions, as customary in Greco-Roman magic ritual, saying, &quot;I have gagged spiteful tongues and muzzled unfriendly mouths&quot; (&quot;Hostiles linguas inimicaque uinximus ora&quot;), she departs intoxicated. The use of the black beans in the old woman&#x27;s ritual may be related to rites that lend themselves to another festival of the dead in the month of May, called Lemuria. During Lemuria the dead ancestor spirits, particularly the unburied, called lemures, emerge from their graves and visit the homes in which they had lived. It was then necessary to confront the unwelcome spirits and lure them out of one&#x27;s house using specific actions and chants. According to Ovid, this includes the involvement of black beans to lure a spirit out of the home. &quot;And after washing his (the householder) hands clean in spring water, he turns, and first he receives black beans and throws them away with face averted; but while he throws them, he says: &#x27;These I cast; with these beans I redeem me and mine.&#x27; This he says nine times, without looking back: the shade is thought to gather the beans, and to follow unseen behind. Again he touches water, and clashes Temesan bronze, and asks the shade to go out of his house. When he has said nine times, &#x27;Ghosts of my fathers, go forth!&#x27; he looks back, and thinks that he has duly performed the sacred rites.&quot; Perhaps the black beans carried with them connotations of warding away or dispelling bad things in general, whether it be unwelcome spirits haunting a household as seen during Lemuria, or preventing undesired gossip towards an individual as in the old hag&#x27;s ritual during Feralia. Also, in the context of sacrifices, the black beans are similar to the black animals used in sacrifice to the &#x27;chthonic deities&#x27;.

It is implied through Ovid&#x27;s choice of words, &quot;hostiles linguas&quot; and &quot;inimicaque ora&quot;, that the ritual is intended to curb gossip about a girl&#x27;s reputation. Gossip of such a nature and its consequences are the subject for the cause, which Ovid offers, of the Dea Tacita festival, which was held on the same day as the Feralia. Ovid then tells a story to explain the origins of Dea Tacitia, starting with Jupiter&#x27;s untamed lust for the nymph Juturna. Juturna, aware of Jupiter&#x27;s lust for her, hid within the Hazelwood forest and dove into her sisters&#x27; waters. Jupiter then gathered all the nymphs in Latium seeking their help in capturing Juturna, saying, &quot;Your sister is spiting herself by shunning her own advantage, an entanglement with the highest god. Look out for us both. What will be a great pleasure for me will be in your sister&#x27;s great interest. Block her as she flees at the bank of the river to keep her from jumping into its waters.&quot; One of the informed nymphs, Lara, would not hold her tongue and warned Juturna to flee. In addition, she approached Jupiter&#x27;s wife Juno, saying, &quot;Your husband loves the Naiad Juturna.&quot; As a result, Jupiter rips out Lara&#x27;s tongue in anger and summons Mercury to escort her to be a nymph in the Underworld. During this mission, Mercury becomes lustful of Lara and copulates with her, begetting twins. These twins become the Lares, the guardians of intersections who watch over the city of Rome.

<text>James Browning Allen (December 28, 1912June 1, 1978) was an American Democratic politician serving as U.S. senator representing Alabama. Allen previously served as the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama and also served in the Alabama Senate and the Alabama House of Representatives.

Allen was succeeded in the U.S. Senate by his wife, Maryon Pittman Allen.

==Life and career==
The Gadsden native attended the University of Alabama and the University of Alabama School of Law, both located in Tuscaloosa. At the University of Alabama he was a member of Alpha Sigma Phi. He practiced law in Gadsden from 1935 to 1968 and was a member of the Alabama House of Representatives from 1938 to 1942. He resigned from the state legislature to enter active duty in the United States Naval Reserve from 1943 to 1946. He again ran for office after World War II and was a member of the Alabama Senate from 1946 to 1950. He was the 17th and 20th Lieutenant Governor of Alabama from 1951 to 1955 and again from 1963 to 1967. During his first tenure, he asked the Alabama Legislature to reject federal funding and refuse to comply with school integration following the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision. He ran for Governor in 1954, but lost in the Democratic primary to former Governor Jim Folsom. Constitutionally barred from a second consecutive term, he would later be elected once more in 1962, becoming the first Lieutenant Governor to be elected more than once. During his second term as Lieutenant Governor, Allen developed a strong political partnership with Governor George Wallace. He was an advocate of racial segregation, and opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1964, he met Maryon Pittman Mullins, a journalist from the &quot;Birmingham News&quot;, for an interview. They quickly fell in love and married four months later.

In 1968, James Allen was elected to succeed the retiring Democratic U.S. Senator J. Lister Hill of Montgomery. Allen won 638,774 (76 percent) to 201,227 (24 percent) for his Republican opponent, Perry O. Hooper, Sr.

Allen was known as one of the most conservative Democrats in the chamber. He was considerably more conservative even than many Republicans of the time. He was an active opponent of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1978. James Allen received one vote for the Republican vice-presidential nomination at the 1976 Republican National Convention.

In March 1974, Allen stated that Governor George Wallace would run in the 1976 Democratic primary and that he believed the Wallace campaign would seek to prevent a repeat of the previous election cycle where the popular vote was not translated into his support from delegates.

Like his Republican Senate colleague, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Allen was a master of parliamentary procedure. He was considered to have revived the filibuster rule during his nearly ten years as a senator. Following the 1974 midterm elections, Allen pledged to use filibusters against liberal officeholders in favor of large spending in the upcoming 94th United States Congress, reasoning that some of the newly elected Democrats could favor larger spending than the members they had replaced: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel the voters have given any mandate toward increased expenditures. The people&#x27;s wishes as indicated by the vote are for us to curtail unnecessary programs and cut Federal spending.&quot; It was thought at this time that James Allen &quot;could emerge as a leader of the Senate&#x27;s conservative bloc with the retirement of Senator Sam J. Ervin, Democrat of North Carolina, and the aging of other conservatives&quot;.

In December 1974, James Allen led a group of senators in an anti-busing filibuster against the removal of an amendment previously passed in the House of Representatives designed to curb Government enforcement of desegregation orders. The filibuster ended with a two–thirds majority voting 56 to 27 to end debate on language revising the amendment, marking only the 19th time a filibuster was ended in such a manner in Senate history. James Allen stated that the closure move would result in a legislative delay, Hugh Scott replying, &quot;The supplemental is being delayed by the opposition of the Senator from Alabama to the Scott-Mansfield amendment.&quot;

James Allen served in the Senate until his death of a heart attack on June 1, 1978, at the resort community of Gulf Shores, Alabama. He is interred at Forrest Cemetery in Gadsden. Governor George C. Wallace, under whom James Allen served previously as lieutenant governor, appointed Allen&#x27;s widow, Maryon Pittman Allen, to succeed him in the Senate.

<text>The cat o&#x27; nine tails, commonly shortened to the cat, is a type of multi-tailed whip or flail. It originated as an implement for physical punishment, particularly in the Royal Navy and British Army, and as a judicial punishment in Britain and some other countries.
==Etymology==
The term first appears in 1681 in reports of a London murder. The term came into wider circulation in 1695 after its mention by a character in William Congreve&#x27;s play &quot;Love for Love.&quot; There are equivalent terms in many languages and also some analogous terms referring to a similar instrument&#x27;s number of tails (cord or leather), such as the Dutch &quot;zevenstaart&quot; (seven tail[s]), &quot;negenstaart&quot; (nine tail[s]), the Spanish &quot;gato de nueve colas&quot; or the Italian &quot;gatto a nove code&quot;.

==Description==
The cat is made up of nine knotted thongs of cotton cord, about long, designed to lacerate the skin and cause intense pain.

It traditionally has nine thongs as a result of the manner in which rope is plaited. Thinner rope is made from three strands of yarn plaited together, and thicker rope from three strands of thinner rope plaited together. To make a cat o&#x27; nine tails, a rope is unraveled into three small ropes, each of which is unraveled again.

The 19th-century British naval cat was made out of a piece of rope, thicker than a man&#x27;s wrist (about ), in length. The first were stiff and solid, and the remaining unraveled into hard twisted and knotted ends.

==Historical punishments==

===Naval types and use===
The naval cat weighed about and was composed of a handle connected to nine thinner pieces of line, with each line knotted several times along its length. Formal floggings — those ordered by captain or court martial — were administered ceremonially on deck, the crew being summoned to &quot;witness punishment&quot; and the prisoner being brought forward by marines with fixed bayonets.

In the British navy, the boatswain&#x27;s mate stood two steps from the offender, combing out the tails of the cat due to the thinner parts of the cat sticking to each other. He would then swing it over his head, make a step forward and, bending his body to give more force to the blow, deliver the stroke at the full sweep of his arm.
Drunkenness could be punished by a dozen lashes, which could be administered on the authority of the ship&#x27;s captain. Greater punishments were generally administered following a formal court martial, with Royal Navy records reflecting some standard penalties of two hundred lashes for desertion, three hundred for mutiny, and up to five hundred for theft. One blow was sufficient to take off the skin, and to draw blood wherever the knots fell. Three dozen was a common punishment. Three hundred lashes were frequently given. The offence of sodomy generally drew the death penalty, though one eighteenth century court martial awarded a punishment of one thousand lashesan equivalent sentence as it would likely be fatal.

For summary punishment of Royal Navy &quot;boys&quot;, a lighter model was made, known as boy&#x27;s cat or boy&#x27;s pussy, that had only five tails of smooth whip cord. If formally convicted by a court martial, however, even boys would suffer the punishment of the adult cat. While adult sailors received their lashes on the back, they were administered to boys on the bare posterior, usually while &quot;kissing the gunner&#x27;s daughter&quot; (publicly bending over a gun barrel), just as boys&#x27; lighter &quot;daily&quot; chastisement was usually over their (often naked) rear-end (mainly with a cane—this could be applied to the hand, but captains generally refused such impractical disablement—or a rope&#x27;s end). Bare-bottom discipline was a tradition of the English upper and middle classes, who frequented public schools, so midshipmen (trainee officers, usually from &#x27;good families&#x27;, getting a cheaper equivalent education by enlisting) were not spared. Still, it is reported that the &#x27;infantile&#x27; embarrassment of prolonged, public bare-bottom punishment was believed essential for optimal deterrence; cocky miscreants might brave the pain of the adult cat in the macho spirit of &quot;taking it like a man&quot; or even as a &quot;badge of honour&quot;.

===British Army===
A soldier who was flogged in 1832, with a cat similar to that used in the King&#x27;s fleet, said:
&quot;I felt an astounding sensation between the shoulders, under my neck, which went to my toe-nails in one direction, and my finger-nails in another, and stung me to the heart, as if a knife had gone through my body... He came on a second time a few inches lower, and then I thought the former stroke was sweet and agreeable compared with that one... I felt my flesh quiver in every nerve, from the scalp of my head to my toe-nails. The time between each stroke seemed so long as to be agonising, and yet the next came too soon... The pain in my lungs was more severe, I thought, than on my back. I felt as if I would burst in the internal parts of my body... I put my tongue between my teeth, held it there, and bit it almost in two pieces. What with the blood from my tongue, and my lips, which I had also bitten, and the blood from my lungs, or some other internal part, ruptured by the writhing agony, I was almost choked, and became black in the face... Only fifty had been inflicted, and the time since they began was like a long period of life; I felt as if I had lived all the time of my real life in pain and torture, and that the time when existence had pleasure in it was a dream, long, long gone by.&quot;

<text>In computer networking and telecommunications, a pseudowire (or pseudo-wire) is an emulation of a point-to-point connection over a packet-switched network (PSN).

The pseudowire emulates the operation of a &quot;transparent wire&quot; carrying the service, but it is realized that this emulation will rarely be perfect. The service being carried over the &quot;wire&quot; may be Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay, Ethernet or time-division multiplexing (TDM) while the packet network may be Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Internet Protocol (IPv4 or IPv6), or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3).

The first pseudowire specifications were the Martini draft for ATM pseudowires, and the TDMoIP draft for transport of E1/T1 over IP.

In 2001, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) set up the PWE3 working group, which was chartered to develop an architecture for service provider edge-to-edge pseudowires, and service-specific documents detailing the encapsulation techniques. Other standardization forums, including the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the MFA Forum, are also active in producing standards and implementation agreements for pseudowires.

Starting from 2006, telecom operators like BellSouth, Supercomm, AT&amp;T, and Verizon began to invest more into pseudowire technology, pointing out its advantages to Ethernet in particular. Pseudowires tie services together across multiple transport technologies, including Ethernet over SONET, WDM, GPON, DSL, and WiMax. Over the next decade, the technology became mainstream.

In 2017 Cisco published a comprehensive document explaining the concept, troubleshooting, and configuration details for all Cisco equipment pieces, which supported pseudowire. Today, the service is provided by a number of telecommunication companies like Axerra Networks, MCI Inc, or by Infrastructure as a service providers like Voxility.

There are now many pseudowire standards, the most important of which are IETF RFCs as well as ITU-T Recommendations:

<doc id="822363" wikidata="Q273898" url="?curid=822363" title="Maryon Pittman Allen">
<text>Maryon Allen (née Pittman; November 30, 1925 – July 23, 2018) was an American journalist who served as United States Senator from Alabama for five months in 1978, after her husband, Senator James B. Allen, died in office. She held no public office prior to her appointment to her husband&#x27;s old senate seat. She was appointed by Democratic Alabama Governor George Wallace.

==Early life==
Maryon Pittman was born in Meridian, Mississippi, in 1925. The following year the family moved to Birmingham, Alabama, where her father established a tractor dealership and where she grew up and attended public school. From 1944 to 1947, she studied journalism at the University of Alabama but did not graduate. In 1946, while a student, she married Joshua Mullins. The couple had three children, who were still young in 1959 when the marriage ended in divorce.

Following her divorce, she went to work, first as an insurance agent and later as the editor of the women&#x27;s sections for five weekly newspapers in the Birmingham area. That experience led to a position as a staff writer for the &quot;Birmingham News&quot;. It was in that capacity that she met James &quot;Jim&quot; Allen, then lieutenant governor of Alabama, in 1964, when she interviewed him in connection with a speech he had delivered to the Alabama Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs. She and Allen, a widower with two children, were attracted to each other and married in August 1964, after a courtship of just four months.

==Political spouse==
Upon her second marriage, Maryon Pittman Allen became a political wife. As lieutenant governor, Jim Allen had to preside over the Alabama State Senate in a special session of the state legislature that Governor George C. Wallace had called three days before the wedding. In a newspaper article published shortly thereafter, she wrote that the legislative session had resulted in the couple&#x27;s having &quot;the most public, political honeymoon in history&quot;.

In 1967, the same year that her husband finished his term as lieutenant governor, Maryon Allen discovered that she had tuberculosis and underwent several months of treatment. The following year she wrote a series of articles for Alabama newspapers in which she described her experiences. Her articles described the care programs in Alabama hospitals and urged readers to get tuberculin tests and chest X-rays.

In 1968, Jim Allen won election to the United States Senate. When he took office in January 1969, Maryon accompanied him to Washington, D.C. She continued working as a journalist, writing a syndicated news column called &quot;The Reflections of a News Hen&quot; for newspapers in Alabama. The column won Alabama Press Association awards as &quot;best original column&quot;.

==U.S. Senate==
Jim Allen died suddenly on June 1, 1978, the victim of a heart attack. One week later, on June 8, 1978, Alabama Governor George Wallace appointed Maryon Allen to succeed her husband in the Senate.

In the Senate, she gained assignments to two of the committees on which her husband had served, Judiciary and Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, but was unsuccessful in her effort to get appointed to the Rules and Administration Committee. She was the first woman to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Like her husband, Maryon Allen was very conservative even by Alabama Democratic standards of the time. In October 1978, she voted for a proposal to allow states that had ratified the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to rescind their ratification. At the time, 35 states had ratified the ERA, three short of the total that would be needed before March 1979 in order to add the ERA to the U.S. Constitution. The proposal to allow states to rescind their ratifications failed to win a majority, and the Senate went on to join the House in voting to give states three additional years to ratify the ERA, but no additional states ratified it, so it failed.

Following her appointment to the Senate, Allen decided to become a candidate in the November 1978 special election for the remaining two years of her husband&#x27;s Senate term. Governor Wallace had been expected to seek the Senate seat, but he decided not to run, making Allen the favorite to win. However, she suffered serious damage to her public image after the &quot;Washington Post&quot; published an interview she had given to reporter Sally Quinn. Quinn quoted statements by Allen that appeared critical of Governor Wallace and his wife Lurleen Wallace. Allen said that Quinn had distorted her statements, but the comments alienated many Alabamians, and some questioned her judgment in sitting for an interview with the &quot;Post&quot;, which conservatives considered to be a liberal publication. She won a plurality in the September 5, 1978, Democratic primary election, receiving 44 percent of the vote, but failed to win the outright majority that was needed to avoid a runoff. In the runoff held on September 26, she lost to State Senator Donald W. Stewart by more than 120,000 votes. Stewart went on to win the general election on November 7, and Allen left the Senate the following day.

During her time in office, Maryon Allen was one of only two women in the Senate. The other woman Senator, Muriel Humphrey, had been appointed in January 1978 to fill the seat vacated by the death of her husband, Hubert Humphrey. Muriel Humphrey also left the Senate in November 1978, immediately after the election of a successor.

==Later years==
After the end of her brief service in the Senate, Allen worked for a time as a columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. In later years, she returned to Alabama, where she did public relations work for an antique dealer and auction house in Birmingham.

Maryon Pittman Allen died on July 23, 2018, at the age of 92.

<doc id="822367" wikidata="Q551783" url="?curid=822367" title="Roger Peyrefitte">
<text>Pierre Roger Peyrefitte (; 17 August 1907 – 5 November 2000) was a French diplomat, writer of bestseller novels and non-fiction, and a defender of gay rights and pederasty.

==Life and work==
Born in Castres, Tarn, to a middle-class bourgeois family, Peyrefitte went to Jesuit and Lazarist boarding schools and then studied language and literature in the University of Toulouse. After graduating first of his year from Institut d&#x27;Études Politiques de Paris in 1930, he worked as an embassy secretary in Athens between 1933 and 1938. Back in Paris, he had to resign in 1940 for personal reasons before being reintegrated in 1943 and finally ending his diplomatic career in 1945. In his novels, he often treated controversial themes and his work put him at odds with the Roman Catholic church.

He wrote openly about his homoerotic experiences in boarding school in his 1943 first novel which won the coveted prix Renaudot in 1944. The book was made into a film of the same name which was released in 1964. On the set, Peyrefitte met the 12-year-old Alain-Philippe Malagnac d&#x27;Argens de Villèle; Peyrefitte tells the story of their relationship in &quot;Notre amour&quot; (&quot;Our Love&quot; – 1967) and &quot;L&#x27;Enfant de cœur&quot; (&quot;Child of the Heart&quot; – 1978). Malagnac later married performer Amanda Lear.

A cultivator of scandal, Peyrefitte attacked the Vatican and Pope Pius XII in his book &quot;Les Clés de saint Pierre&quot; (1953), which earned him the nickname of &quot;Pope of the Homosexuals&quot;. The publication of the book started a bitter quarrel with François Mauriac. Mauriac threatened to resign from the paper he was working with at the time, &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;, if it did not stop carrying advertisements for the book. The quarrel was exacerbated by Mauriac&#x27;s articles attacking the memory of Jean Cocteau because of his homosexuality and the release of the film adaptation of . This culminated in a virulent open letter by Peyrefitte in which he accused Mauriac of being a hypocrite, a fake heterosexual who maligned his own children and a closeted homosexual with a past.

In &quot;Les Ambassades&quot; (1951), he revealed the ins and outs of diplomacy. Peyrefitte also wrote a book full of gossip about Baron Jacques d&#x27;Adelswärd-Fersen&#x27;s exile in Capri (&quot;L&#x27;Exilé de Capri&quot;, 1959) and translated Greek gay love poetry (&quot;La Muse garçonnière (The Boyish Muse)&quot;, Flammarion, 1973).

In his memoirs, &quot;Propos Secrets&quot;, he wrote extensively about his youth, his sex life (pederastic mainly and a few affairs with women), his years as a diplomat, and his travels to Greece and Italy.

Roger Peyrefitte wrote popular historical biographies about Alexander the Great and Voltaire. In &quot;Voltaire et Frédéric II&quot; he claimed that Voltaire had been the passive lover of Frederick the Great.

In spite of his libertarian views on sexuality, politically Peyrefitte was a conservative bourgeois and in his later years he supported the far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen.

He died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at age 93.

== Legacy ==
After his death, the city of Capri dedicated a plaque to him which is mounted near Villa Lysis and the inscription of which reads: &quot;A Roger Peyrefitte autore de L&#x27;esule di Capri per aver esaltato e diffuso il mito, la cultura e la bellezza dell&#x27;isola nel mondo.&quot; — &quot;For Roger Peyrefitte, author of &quot;L&#x27;Exile de Capri&quot;, for having exalted and diffused the myth, the culture, and the beauty of this island in the world.&quot;

In a 2012 essay about the importance of public libraries, English actor and writer Stephen Fry mentions that Peyrefitte&#x27;s novels &quot;The Exile of Capri&quot; and &quot;Special Friendships&quot; were &quot;unforgettable, transformative books&quot; for him.

==Press cuttings==

*Obituary in &quot;The Times&quot;, 7 November 2000, page 25. &quot;In the minds of many, Roger Peyrefitte&#x27;s reputation as a genuinely literary novelist is based on &quot;Les Amitiés Particulières&quot; (1944), which was also his first. He wrote many others, but none really matched the literary merit of the first, and the author seemed increasingly to seek a succès de scandale rather than any serious critical consideration.&quot;
*Obituary by James Kirkup in &quot;The Independent&quot;: The Tuesday Review, 7 November 2000, page 6. &quot;Peyrefitte was a skilled manipulator of the media. He was charismatic to the point of absurdity, with his dramatic gestures and outrageous behaviour, so that in the end no one took any notice of his often ludicrous fabrications, though they were always delivered with great style and conviction, and with an effrontery that was amusingly malicious...Peyrefitte acknowledges the courage of his great predecessors André Gide, Marcel Proust, Jean Cocteau and Oscar Wilde while regretting the timidity of Marcel Jouhandeau and many of the contemporary French writers, whether gay or straight, in pursuing the cause of homosexual (and heterosexual) rights.&quot;
*Obituary by Douglas Johnson in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, 15 November 2000, page 24. &quot;André Gide, who had attempted to defend homosexuality in a much earlier work, was prophetic in his congratulations to Peyrefitte. He did not think that &quot;Les Amitiés Particulières&quot; would win the Goncourt prize, but he did believe it would still be read a century later.&quot;

<doc id="822373" wikidata="Q2428129" url="?curid=822373" title="Caristia">
<text>In ancient Rome, the Caristia, also known as the Cara Cognatio, was an official but privately observed holiday on February 22 that celebrated love of family with banqueting and gifts. Families gathered to dine together and offer food and incense to the Lares as their household gods. It was a day of reconciliation when disagreements were to be set aside, but the poet Ovid observes satirically that this could be achieved only by excluding family members who caused trouble.

==Practices==
The Caristia was one of several days in February that honored family or ancestors. It followed the Parentalia, nine days of remembrance which began on February 13 and concluded with the Feralia on February 21, or in the view of some, the Caristia on the next day. For the Parentalia, families visited the tombs of their ancestors and shared cake and wine, both in the form of offerings and as a meal among themselves. The Feralia was a more somber occasion, a public festival of sacrifices and offerings to the Manes, the spirits of the dead who required propitiation. The Caristia was a recognition of the family line as it continued into the present and among the living.

There were distributions of bread, wine, and &quot;sportulae&quot; (bonuses, tips, tokens of appreciation). The poet Martial has a pair of poems on gift-giving for the holiday; in one, he offers a sort of &quot;non-apology apology&quot; to his relatives Stella and Flaccus, explaining that he&#x27;s sent them nothing because he didn&#x27;t want to offend others who ought to receive a gift from him and wouldn&#x27;t.

==On the calendar==
Unlike public festivals, the Caristia and other privately observed holidays were allowed to fall on even-numbered days of the Roman calendar. The Cara Cognatio remained on the calendar long after the Roman Empire had come under Christian rule. It appeared in the Chronography of 354, and the calendar of Polemius Silvius (449 AD) juxtaposed the old holiday with a feast day commemorating the burial of St. Peter and St. Paul. As a &quot;love feast,&quot; the Caristia was not incompatible with Christian attitudes; some scholars have detected an influence of the Parentalia and Caristia on the Christian agape feast, with the consumption of bread and wine at the ancestral tomb replaced by the Eucharist. In the 5th century, some Christian priests even encouraged participation in funerary meals.

In the first half of the 6th century, some Gallo-Romans still observed a form of the holiday with food offerings to the dead and a ritual meal. By then, however, the practice had come under suspicion as a &quot;pagan&quot; ritual, and the Council of Tours in 567 explicitly censured those who &quot;defiled&quot; the feast day of St. Peter. The observances were condemned by Caesarius of Arles as an excuse for drunkenness, dancing, singing, and other &quot;demonic&quot; behaviors. The suppression of traditional commemorations of the dead were part of increasing efforts by the Church to control and monopolize religious behaviors in Merovingian Gaul.

<text>The Lacus Iuturnae, or Lacus Juturnae or Spring of [[Juturna]], is the name of a formal pool built by the Romans near a spring or well in the Roman Forum. The pool was part of a shrine dedicated to the water nymph Juturna, and the name &quot;Lacus Iuturnae&quot; is also used for the spring and the shrine, both next to the pool.

The site was initially excavated by Giacomo Boni in the early twentieth century. Excavations from the 1980s onwards were supervised by Eva Margareta Steinby.

==Legends==
The shrine marks a place where Roman legend claims the divine twins Castor and Pollux stopped to water their horses while passing through the city, and where they announced Roman victory at the Battle of Lake Regillus, 495 BC. During the Roman Empire, when another spring in the city had dried up, the Vestal Virgins used this spring to supply water for their religious ceremonies. The water at the &quot;Lacus Iuturnae&quot; was thought to have healing properties. The elderly and infirm would go to the spring with offerings in order to secure the assistance of Juturna in curing their malady.

<text>Pembrey Burrows stretch from Burry Port&#x27;s harbour area – a former coal port, now a marina – to Pembrey Country Park, a leisure and nature complex that is one of West Wales&#x27;s leading visitor attractions.

The Burrows not only provide sanctuary of coastal wildlife but are also a source of seafood for the local residents – including razor clams and samphire. The coast is easily accessed by foot or bicycle by way of the Millennium Coastal Path. Slightly inland is the championship Ashburnham Golf Course and the village of Pembrey itself.

Pembrey centres on a village square and magnificent St. Illtyd&#x27;s Church Celtic Christianity. Court Farm on Pembrey&#x27;s Mountain Road dates back to Norman times, reputedly established by Arnold le Boteler. Pembrey also encompasses the Welsh Motor Sports Centre at the former RAF Pembrey Sands; Pembrey Airport with its flying school; and Pembrey Mountain, popular with walkers. The village was once the home of Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith while serving in the Royal Air Force.

<text>Thomas Tang (January 11, 1922 – July 18, 1995) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1977 to 1995. Tang was the first American of Chinese descent to become a U.S. federal judge.

==Education and career==

The son of a grocery owner, Tang was born and spent his early years in Phoenix, Arizona, where he attended public schools. He joined the military through ROTC in 1942 and became a First Lieutenant in the United States Army. After graduation from the Santa Clara University with a Bachelor of Science degree and the James E. Rogers College of Law at the University of Arizona with a Bachelor of Laws, he was again commissioned to the Army and served on the Korean peninsula during the Korean War. In 1952, Tang resigned from the Army and after a brief stint of private practice, served as Deputy County Attorney of Maricopa County, Arizona from 1952 to 1957 and Assistant Attorney General of Arizona from 1957 to 1959. He was then elected to the Phoenix City Council in 1960, and a Judge of the Superior Court of Arizona in 1963. During his tenure as Superior Court Judge, numerous lawyers who later rose to great eminence appeared before him, former United States Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor being one of them. After losing his judicial re-election in 1970, due to a highly publicized juvenile murder trial in which he was accused for being too lenient, Tang returned to private practice.

==Federal judicial service==

Tang was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on August 29, 1977, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated by Judge Richard Harvey Chambers. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 7, 1977, and received his commission on October 12, 1977. He assumed senior status on October 12, 1993. His service was terminated on July 18, 1995, due to his death of cancer at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix.

==Competition in his honor==

In 1993, the APA Law Student Association of the South Texas College of Law in Houston, Texas named a national moot court competition in Tang&#x27;s honor. The Thomas Tang Moot Court Competition is now administered by the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA) Law Foundation and the NAPABA Judicial Council. The Competition continues to honor the late Judge Tang, a champion of individual rights, an advocate for the advancement of minority attorneys, an ardent supporter of NAPABA and the moot court competition. Judge Tang’s wife, Dr. Pearl Tang, continued the legacy during her lifetime. The competition is open to all students but is especially designed to reach out to APA law students and provide them with an opportunity to showcase their writing and oral skills and compete for scholarships.

<doc id="822518" wikidata="Q2300423" url="?curid=822518" title="United States Conference of Catholic Bishops">
<text>The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) is the episcopal conference of the Catholic Church in the United States. Founded in 2001 after the merger of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) and United States Catholic Conference (USCC), the USCCB is a registered corporation based in Washington, D.C.

As with all bishops&#x27; conferences, certain decisions and acts of the USCCB must receive the &quot;recognitio&quot;, or approval, of the Roman dicasteries, which are subject to the immediate and absolute authority of the Pope. 

, the USCCB president is Archbishop Timothy Broglio of the Archdiocese of the Military Services, USA. The vice president is Archbishop William E. Lori of the Archdiocese of Baltimore.

== Structure ==
The USCCB is composed of all active and retired members of the Catholic hierarchy in the United States and the territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands. This includes archbishops, bishops, coadjutors, auxiliary bishops and the ordinary of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter. The other American territories and commonwealths are not part of the USCCB.

The president is the chief executive officer of the USCCB and is in charge of the Administrative Committee. He also presides at the plenary sessions of the bishops. The vice president is the second highest official and is assigned certain duties by the president. The treasurer manages the USCCB finances and the secretary keeps the minutes of the plenary sessions. These officials are all bishops serving three-year terms in office.

The USCCB normally holds two general assemblies per years. The assemblies are open to all bishops along with organizations and individuals who work with the USCCB. Voting on proposals are limited to active bishops of the Latin and Eastern Rite churches; emeritus bishops (retired bishops) do not have a vote. Proposals are passed either on majority votes or two-thirds votes.

As of 2025, the USCCB has 19 standing committees. Seven of the these committees have subcommittees.

==History==
During the 19th century, the bishops in the United States met periodically to discuss issues facing the American church and to set policies and rules for its operation, with approval from the Vatican. Three of these plenary councils were held in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1852, 1866 and 1884.

As the American church grew and new circumstances arose, the need for more regular meetings soon became apparent.

===National Catholic War Council===
With the American entry into World War I in April 1917, the American Catholic hierarchy realized that it needed to provide chaplains and other services to Catholic soldiers serving in the United States and France. It would also need to raise funds from dioceses around the country to support these services.

In August 1917, each bishop in the United States sent one priest and one lay person to meet at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. The organizers also invited members of the Catholic press and religious institutes.The 1917 meeting at Catholic University ended with the founding of the first national organization of Catholic bishops in the United States, the National Catholic War Council (NCWC). In December 1917, the American bishops decided to place the NCWC directly under their control.

===National Catholic Welfare Council===

With the end of World War I, the general feeling among the American Catholic hierarchy was that they should create a new association of bishops to build on the successes of the NCWC. The American bishops met in February 1919 at Catholic University to discuss this new organization along with other matters. By the end of the meeting, they had decided to hold a yearly conference of what was now called the National Catholic Welfare Council (also known as NCWC)

The bishops also created an administrative committee with seven members to manage the daily business of the NCWc between plenary meetings. Archbishop Edward Hanna of San Francisco was named as the first committee chair and the NCWC headquarters was established in Washington, D.C. The first meeting of bishops was set for September 1919. In 1919, Pope Benedict XV urged the bishops to assist him in promoting the labor reforms first articulated by Pope Leo XIII in &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;.

=== National Catholic Welfare Conference ===
However, the NCWC soon faced opposition. In February 1920, Archbishop William O&#x27;Connell, leader of one of the largest archdiocese in the nation, petitioned the Consistorial Congregation in Rome to ban the NCWC. He claimed that it reflected Gallicanism and diminished the authority of the bishops. Several NCWC members protested the suppression to Pope Benedict XV, saying that the dissolution of the NCWC would make the bishops look autocratic. The pope agree to lift the suppression, but asked the bishops to change the organization&#x27;s name in 1922 to the National Catholic Welfare Conference.

=== National Conference of Catholic Bishops and United States Catholic Conference ===
In 1966, the American bishops decided to split the NCWC into two organizations with different focuses, but common goals.

* The National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) was created to work on church affairs within the United States.
* The United States Catholic Conference (USCC) would concentrate on the Catholic church and American society.

=== United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ===
The bishops in 2001 decided to recombine the NCCB and the USCC into one organization, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB).

=== Sexual abuse crisis ===

Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the 21st century, the American Catholic church was hit with a huge wave of revelations of sexual abuse of children by priests and bishops, along with revelations of coverups and mismanagement of the scandals by American bishops. The fact that bishops commonly reassigned clergy accused of abuse from their parish to another parish where they still had access to children was considered to have allowed the abuse to proliferate. The initial USCCB response to the crisis was widely criticized, both within and outside the Catholic church. 

In June 2002, the USCCB unanimously passed the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People, known as the Dallas Charter. The charter committed the American Catholic Church to providing a &quot;safe environment&quot; for all children and youth participating in church-sponsored activities. To accomplish this, the American bishops pledged to establish uniform procedures for handling sex-abuse allegations against priests, lay teachers in Catholic schools, parish staff members, coaches and other people who dealt with children. It also adopted a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy towards these people for sexual abuse. In 2004, the USCCB commissioned the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York to conduct an independent investigation to determine the scope of sexual abuse allegations from 1950 to 2002. The college produced the &quot;John Jay Report.&quot;

Subsequent decades have seen the USCCB grappling with the fallout, which included dozens of court cases resulting in financial settlements with the victims of almost $4 billion. Numerous dioceses declared bankruptcy in an effort to manage the financial impact. The USCCB continues to publish an annual report on its progress in addressing concerns.

Gómez in November 2020 issued an apology on behalf of the USCCB to the sexual abuse victims of former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and to all victims of sexual abuse by clergy.

==Regions==
The American dioceses are grouped into 15 regions. 

* Regions I through XIV contain the Latin Catholic dioceses
* The non-territorial Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter is part of Region X. 
* The Eastern Catholic eparchies (dioceses) constitute Region XV.

==Committees==

=== National Right to Life Committee ===
During the 1960s, the women&#x27;s movement in the United States started working on the state level to legalize abortion rights for women. To combat these efforts, the NCCB in April 1967 appointed Reverend James T. McHugh during April 1967 to help coordinate a national Catholic counter-response.

In 1968, the NCCB founded the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), headed by attorney Juan Ryan. Its goal was to coordinate information and strategy between Catholic anti-abortion groups. As of 2024, the NRLC has affiliates in all 50 states with over 3,000 local chapters. These NRLC affiliate groups were forming in response to efforts to change abortion laws based on model legislation proposed by the American Law Institute (ALI) in Philadelphia. New Jersey.

The NRLC held its first national meeting of chapter leaders in Chicago in 1970 at Barat College. The following year, NRLC held its first convention at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.

== Issues ==

=== Abortion ===
In 1990, the USCCB hired the public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton in New York City to launch a campaign to persuade Catholics and non-Catholics to oppose abortion rights for women. This was part of a persuasive effect to educate the public on abortion as opposed to demonstrations at women&#x27;s health clinics.

In the November 2023 assembly, the bishops again stated that abortion was a greater threat to life than gun violence, racism, climate change and inequality in health care and was the preeminent priority of the American Catholic Church.

=== Contraception ===
In March 2012, regarding the contraception mandate issued as a regulation under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which required that employers who do not support contraception but are not religious institutions &quot;per se&quot; must cover contraception via their employer-sponsored health insurance. USCCB decided to &quot;continue its &#x27;vigorous opposition to this unjust and illegal mandate&#x27;&quot;.

=== Ecumenicism ===
As of 2021, the USCCB has been in ecumenical discussion with the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America (PCCNA), as well as discussing the possibility of future theological dialogue between Pentecostalism and Catholicism.

The USCCB is a member of Christian Churches Together, an interdenominational fellowship of Christian denominations and organizations in the United States.

=== Religious liberty ===
The USCCB in 2009 issued the revised &quot;Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services&quot;. These directives were first issued in 1971. The main focus of these revisions was guidance for Catholic health care institutions in dealing with governments and non-Catholic organizations. It was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on the grounds that the directive in some cases caused doctors to refuse treatment of women in an emergency medical situation.

From 2012 to 2018, the USCCB promoted Fortnight for Freedom, a campaign to protest government activities that the USCCB viewed as impinging on religious liberty. The USCCB replace it in 2018 with Religious Liberty Week.
===Gun violence===
The USCCB filed an amicus brief in the 2024 US Supreme Court case of &quot;United States v. Rahimi.&quot; The USCCB argued that protecting the innocent &quot;is a proper consideration&quot; when regulating firearms: &quot;As the Church teaches, and this Nation&#x27;s historical traditions demonstrate, the right to bear arms is not an unqualified license that must leave vulnerable family members to live in fear. Abused victims are precisely the people whom a just government is tasked with protecting. The Second Amendment does not stand as a barrier to their safety.&quot;

===Immigration===
In January 2017, Bishop Joe S. Vásquez, the chairman of the USCCB Committee on Migration, criticized Executive Order 13769, issued by the Trump Administration. The order restricted refugees from several predominantly Muslim nations from entering the United States; it also banned all refugees from the Syrian Civil War from entering the country. 

The USCCB in September 2017 condemned the Trump administration&#x27;s cancellation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. DACA had allowed nearly 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States as children of undocumented immigrants to apply for protection from deportation.

At the 2018 USCCB meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, President Cardinal Daniel DiNardo criticized the Trump administration&#x27;s policies of family separation of undocumented immigrants and the denial of asylum in the United States to women fleeing domestic violence in their home country.

=== LGBTQ ===

In June 2020, a USCCB committee praised the Trump Administration for changing a US Department of Health and Human Services ruling regarding sexual discrimination based on gender identity.The statement said that it; &quot;...will help restore the rights of health care providers—as well as insurers and employers—who decline to perform or cover abortions or &#x27;gender transition&#x27; procedures due to ethical or professional objections.&quot;In December 2023, the USCCB clarified Pope Francis&#x27; recent remarks on the blessing of same-sex couples and unmarried couples. They said that a priest could bless them, but not in the context of validating their union as a marriage.

=== Politics ===
In 2020, some conservative American bishops complained to Gómez after he congratulated US Senator Joe Biden, a Catholic, on his election as president of the United States. In response, Gómez formed a working group to address the &quot;confusion&quot; that could be caused by Catholic politicians who support policies that contravene Catholic teaching. 

On January 20, 2021, inauguration day in the United States, Gómez sent Biden a congratulatory letter. The letter said that Gómez was &quot;praying that God grant him wisdom and courage to lead this great nation and that God help him to meet the tests of these times. &quot; However, Gómez also stated that some of Biden&#x27;s policies,&quot;...would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender. Of deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences.&quot;Several bishops, including Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago, objected to the Gómez letter. Cupich said that individuals within the USCCB drafted the Biden letter without first consulting with the Administrative Committee. He described the incident as an &quot;institutional failure&quot; of the USCCB; the bishops should have been allowed to approved the Biden letter first. In what &quot;America&quot; magazine called a &quot;rare rebuke&quot;,Cupich released two statements, one of which said, &quot;Today, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops issued an ill-considered statement on the day of President Biden&#x27;s inauguration. Aside from the fact that there is seemingly no precedent for doing so, the statement, critical of President Biden, came as a surprise to many bishops, who received it just hours before it was released.&quot;On March 30, 2021, Gómez wrote to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) in Rome, telling them that the USCCB was drafting a new document on the worthiness of Catholic politicians to receive communion. 

Cardinal Luis Ladaria, prefect of the CDF, replied to Gómez on May 7th. Ladaria cautioned the USCCB to preserve unity among its bishops in discussing anti-abortion issues. Ladaria also said that abortion and euthanasia were not the only grave issues of Catholic moral teaching.He further stated that any new USCCB provision had to respect the rights of individual bishops in their diocese and the prerogatives of the Vatican.In April 2021, the Gómez working group announced that it was drafting a new document on communion.

=== Racism ===
During the 2020 protests over the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Archbishop José Horacio Gómez, the USCCB president, issued a statement condemning Floyd&#x27;s death. He cited Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s words that &quot;riots are the language of the unheard&quot;.

==Funding==
Most funding for the USCCB is raised through national collections, government grants, and diocesan assessments.

<text>The Pemon or Pemón (Pemong) are indigenous people living in areas of Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana. The Pemon people are divided into many dialects and traditions, which are Arekuna, Kamarakoto, and Taurepang.

==People==
The Pemon are part of the larger Cariban language family, and include six groups including the Arekuna, Ingarikó, Kamarakoto, Tualipang, Mapoyo and Macushi/Makushi (Macuxi or Makuxi in Brazil). While ethnographic data on these groups are scant, Iris Myers produced one of the most detailed accounts of the Makushi in the 1940s, and her work is heavily relied upon for comparisons between historical and contemporary Makushi life.

The Pemon were first encountered by westerners in the 18th century and converted by missionaries to Christianity. Their society is based on trade and considered egalitarian and decentralized, and in Venezuela, funding from petrodollars have helped fund community projects, and ecotourism opportunities are also being developed. In Venezuela, Pemon live in the Gran Sabana grassland plateau dotted with tabletop mountains where the Angel Falls, the world&#x27;s highest waterfall, plunges from Auyantepui in Canaima National Park.

In Brazil, Pemon live among other indigenous people near the borders of Venezuela and Guyana in villages within the Terras Indígenas São Marcos and Raposa Serra do Sol. There are 792 Pemon according to a 2014 estimate.

The Makuxi, who are also Pemon speakers, are found in Brazil and Guyana in areas close to the Venezuelan border.

== Lifestyle ==
The Pemon language and people have been extremely affected by tourism and historical events like the establishment of the Canaima camp founded by the Boulton family nearby the Canaima town, where the demographic concentration of Pemon people is established. Many Pemon people work in hotels and tourism. This deeply affected the tradition of the Pemon people, as they turned out to be a Catholic majority population, and left behind their ancestral language and belief, still, many Pemon people, known as &quot;Chamanes&quot; still practice the ancestral religion, mostly for healthcare.

==Language==
Pemon (in Spanish: Pemón), is a Cariban language spoken mainly in Venezuela, specifically in the Gran Sabana region of Bolívar State. According to the 2001 census there were 15,094 Pemon speakers in Venezuela. It is divided into three principal dialects, which are; Arekuna, Kamarakoto, and Taurepang.

== Myths ==

The Pemon have a very rich mythic tradition which is merged into their present Christian faiths. Pemon mythology includes gods residing in the grassland area&#x27;s table-top mountains called &quot;tepui&quot;. The mountains are off-limits to the living, as they are also home to ancestor spirits called &quot;mawari&quot;. The first non-native person to seriously study Pemon myths and language was the German ethnologist Theodor Koch-Grunberg, who visited Roraima in 1912.

Important myths describe the origins of the sun and moon, the creation of the &quot;tepui&quot; mountains – which dramatically rise from the savannahs of the Gran Sabana — and the activities of the creator hero Makunaíma. Makunaíma is described as an individual or a group of brothers, sons of the sun &quot;Wei&quot; and a woman made of clay. He goes searching for his father who had been captive of malevolent spirits. After finding his father, Makunaíma finds the &quot;tree of the world&quot;, which he cuts down and the resulting stump becomes Mount Roraima. The falling of the tree caused a great cataclysm, with floods and fire, and humans were recreated by Makunaíma. Makunaíma also turned people and animals into stone that are a part of Pemon description of the natural world.

Missionary work among Amerindians has impacted Pemon belief; and &quot;Jechikrai&quot; is the Pemon adaptation of Jesus Christ.

=== Religion ===
Pemon have polytheistic beliefs. Mythological figures like Makunaima, Kanaima, Iwarrika and Sigu are an important part of their culture. The most important god is Makunaima because, in their opinion, he created the tribe. Furthermore, they associate some natural phenomena to some divinities like Iwarrika who is blamed for flooding the earth. The Shaman plays an important part in their religious practice. He meets the god during hallucinogenic rituals when tobacco and a specific diet are used.

==&quot;Kueka&quot; stone controversy==
In 1999, Wolfgang Kraker von Schwarzenfeld arranged the transport of a red stone boulder, weighing about 35 metric tons, from Venezuela&#x27;s Canaima National Park to Berlin Tiergarten for his &quot;global stone&quot; project. Since that time, a dispute had been ongoing of the Pemon trying to get the stone back, involving German and Venezuelan authorities and embassies.

On 16 April 2020, the Kueka stone was finally returned to Venezuela.

<text>Valens Acidalius (156725 May 1595), also known as Valtin Havekenthal, was a German critic and poet writing in the Latin language.

==Life==
Acidalius was born in Wittstock, the son of a Lutheran pastor. He studied at the universities of Rostock, Greifswald and Helmstedt. Even in his early youth, his Latin poems caused a stir. In 1590 he accompanied his friend Daniel Bucretius (Daniel Rindfleisch) to Italy where he published his first literary work, an edition of Velleius Paterculus. Acidalius studied philosophy and medicine in Bologna and was awarded a doctorate degree in both disciplines.

He was however not attracted by the practical work as a medic and therefore concentrated on the criticism of classic works. He returned to Germany in 1593 after several fever attacks, moving to Breslau, the home town of his friend Bucretius. In 1595 Acidalius became a Catholic and in spring of the same year, he accepted an invitation of his friend and supporter, the episcopal chancellor Wacker von Wackenfels to Neisse. He died there of a fever at the age of 28.

Disputed:
* &quot;Disputatio nova contra mulieres, qua probatur eas homines non esse&quot;, 1595, probably printed in Zerbst, 11 sheets 4°. A tract which caused much annoyance among the theologians of the time because of its blasphemic precepts. His attackers overlooked the fact that the tract was intended as a parody on the Socinian methods of refuting the divine nature of Christ. During his lifetime, Acidalius denied having written these papers. It is believed that while Acidalius did not actually write the tract, he was nevertheless instrumental in its creation. Thus, the actual author remains anonymous.

<text>Biogeochemistry is the scientific discipline that involves the study of the chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes and reactions that govern the composition of the natural environment (including the biosphere, the cryosphere, the hydrosphere, the pedosphere, the atmosphere, and the lithosphere). In particular, biogeochemistry is the study of biogeochemical cycles, the cycles of chemical elements such as carbon and nitrogen, and their interactions with and incorporation into living things transported through earth scale biological systems in space and time. The field focuses on chemical cycles which are either driven by or influence biological activity. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, iron, and phosphorus cycles. Biogeochemistry is a systems science closely related to systems ecology.

==History==
=== Early Greek ===
Early Greeks established the core idea of biogeochemistry that nature consists of cycles.

=== 18th-19th centuries ===
Agricultural interest in 18th-century soil chemistry led to better understanding of nutrients and their connection to biochemical processes. This relationship between the cycles of organic life and their chemical products was further expanded upon by Dumas and Boussingault in a 1844 paper that is considered an important milestone in the development of biogeochemistry. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck first used the term &quot;biosphere&quot; in 1802, and others continued to develop the concept throughout the 19th century. Early climate research by scientists like Charles Lyell, John Tyndall, and Joseph Fourier began to link glaciation, weathering, and climate.

=== 20th century ===
The founder of modern biogeochemistry was Vladimir Vernadsky, a Russian and Ukrainian scientist whose 1926 book &quot;The Biosphere&quot;, in the tradition of Mendeleev, formulated a physics of the Earth as a living whole. Vernadsky distinguished three spheres, where a sphere was a concept similar to the concept of a phase-space. He observed that each sphere had its own laws of evolution, and that the higher spheres modified and dominated the lower:

# Abiotic sphere – all the non-living energy and material processes
# Biosphere – the life processes that live within the abiotic sphere
# Nöesis or noosphere – the sphere of human cognitive process

Human activities (e.g., agriculture and industry) modify the biosphere and abiotic sphere. In the contemporary environment, the amount of influence humans have on the other two spheres is comparable to a geological force (see Anthropocene).

The American limnologist and geochemist G. Evelyn Hutchinson is credited with outlining the broad scope and principles of this new field. More recently, the basic elements of the discipline of biogeochemistry were restated and popularized by the British scientist and writer, James Lovelock, under the label of the &quot;Gaia Hypothesis&quot;. Lovelock emphasized a concept that life processes regulate the Earth through feedback mechanisms to keep it habitable. The research of Manfred Schidlowski was concerned with the biochemistry of the Early Earth.

==Biogeochemical cycles==
Biogeochemical cycles are the pathways by which chemical substances (are turned over or moved through) the biotic and the abiotic compartments of Earth. The biotic compartment is the biosphere and the abiotic compartments are the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. There are biogeochemical cycles for chemical elements, such as for calcium, carbon, hydrogen, mercury, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, selenium, iron and sulfur, as well as molecular cycles, such as for water and silica. There are also macroscopic cycles, such as the rock cycle, and human-induced cycles for synthetic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In some cycles there are reservoirs where a substance can remain or be sequestered for a long period of time.

==Research==
Biogeochemistry research groups exist in many universities around the world. Since this is a highly interdisciplinary field, these are situated within a wide range of host disciplines including: atmospheric sciences, biology, ecology, geomicrobiology, environmental chemistry, geology, oceanography and soil science. These are often bracketed into larger disciplines such as earth science and environmental science.

Many researchers investigate the biogeochemical cycles of chemical elements such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, as well as their stable isotopes. The cycles of trace elements, such as the trace metals and the radionuclides, are also studied. This research has obvious applications in the exploration of ore deposits and oil, and in the remediation of environmental pollution.

Some important research fields for biogeochemistry include:

* modelling of natural systems
* soil and water acidification recovery processes
* eutrophication of surface waters
* carbon sequestration
* environmental remediation
* global change
* climate change
* biogeochemical prospecting for ore deposits
* soil chemistry
* chemical oceanography

== Evolutionary Biogeochemistry ==
Evolutionary biogeochemistry is a branch of modern biogeochemistry that applies the study of biogeochemical cycles to the geologic history of the Earth. This field investigates the origin of biogeochemical cycles and how they have changed throughout the planet&#x27;s history, specifically in relation to the evolution of life.

<text>Pescara (; ; ) is the capital city of the province of Pescara, in the Abruzzo region of Italy. It is the most populated city in Abruzzo, with 118,657 (January 1, 2023) residents (and approximately 350,000 including the surrounding metropolitan area). Located on the Adriatic coast at the mouth of the River Aterno-Pescara, the present-day municipality was formed in 1927 joining the municipalities of the old Pescara fortress, the part of the city to the south of the river, and Castellamare Adriatico, the part of the city to the north of the river. The surrounding area was formed into the province of Pescara.

The main commercial street of the city is Corso Umberto I, which runs between two squares, starting from &quot;Piazza della Repubblica&quot; and reaching the seacoast in &quot;Piazza Primo Maggio&quot;. The rectangle that it forms with Corso Vittorio Emanuele II and Via Nicola Fabrizi is home of the main shopping district, enclosed in a driving restriction zone, where several of the best fashion shops are located. Corso Manthoné, the course of the old Pescara, has, for many years, been the center of the nightlife of the city. City hall and the administration of the province are in Piazza Italia, near the river, and in the area between here and the D&#x27;Annunzio University campus to the south, a business district has grown up over the years, while the Marina is situated to the immediate south of the mouth of the river. Pescara is also served by an international airport, the Abruzzo Airport, and one of the major touristic ports of Adriatic Sea and Italy, the Port of Pescara.

== Geography ==
Pescara is situated at sea level on the Adriatic coast and has developed from some centuries BC onwards at the strategic position around the mouth of the Aterno-Pescara River. The coast is low and sandy and the beach extends, unbroken for some distance to both the north and the south of the river, reaching a width of approximately in the area around a &quot;pineta&quot; (a small pine forest) to the north. To the south the pine forest that once gave shade to bathers along much of the Adriatic coast, has almost disappeared near the beach, but remains within the Nature Reserve Pineta Dannunziana.

The urban fabric of the city spreads over a flat T-shaped area, which occupies the valley around the river and the coastal strip. To the northwest and the southwest, the city is also expanding into the surrounding hills which were first occupied in the Neolithic period.

The whole city is affected by the presence of groundwater, the level of which varies by up to a metre, being at its highest in spring due to snow melting in the mountains inland.

The city is very close to the mountains, and the ski slopes of Passo Lanciano are a 30 minute drive away.

The city is set to expand on 1 January 2027, when neighboring towns of Montesilvano and Spoltore will be annexed into the city. The residents of the three towns voted in a referendum on the merger on 25 May 2014. 70.32% of Pescara voters approved the annexation, also 52.23% of Montesilvano and 51.15% of Spoltore voters. The regional law approving the merger was passed by the regional council on 8 August 2018, with the merger to become law on 1 January 2022. It was later delayed into 2023 and again into 2027.

== Climate ==
Pescara has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with Mediterranean influences. The city&#x27;s climate is characterized by hot summers and cool winters. Since its driest month has of precipitation, the city cannot be solely classified as Mediterranean. Not to mention, although there is a dry tendency in early summer, August (late summer) is as wet as the winter month of February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean pattern.

The average temperature is around in the coldest month (January) and in the warmest month (July). The lowest temperature recorded in the city was on 4 January 1979. The highest was registered on 30 August 2007 at . Precipitation is low (around per annum) and concentrated mainly in the late autumn.

Pescara is a coastal city, but its climate is influenced by the surrounding mountains (the Maiella and the chain of Gran Sasso). When the wind is southwesterly, Pescara experiences a Foehn wind that often reaches , causing a sudden increase in temperature and decrease in relative humidity, and for that reason winters with temperatures that exceed almost daily are not unknown. Pescara experiences 35 days annually with minimum temperature below .

Under northeasterly winds Pescara suffers precipitation which is generally weak, but can be much more intense if accompanied by a depression. Also from the north east comes winter weather from Siberia that, on average, brings abundant snowfalls every 3–4 years. In summer the weather is mostly stable and sunny with temperatures that, thanks to the sea breeze, rarely exceed 35 degrees unless a southwesterly Libeccio is blowing. Particularly in summer, but also in winter, the high humidity leads to morning and evening mist or haze.

== History ==

Pescara&#x27;s origins precede the Roman conquest. It was founded to be the port of Vestini and Marrucini tribes to trade with the peoples of the Orient, a supporting role that was held for centuries. The name of both the town and the river was Aternum, it was connected to Rome through the Via Claudia Valeria and the Via Tiburtina. The main building was the temple of &quot;Jovis Aternium&quot;. The town was an important port for trade with the Eastern provinces of the Empire.

In the Middle Ages it was destroyed by the Lombards (597). Saint Cetteus, the town&#x27;s patron saint, was a bishop of the 6th century, elected to the see of Amiternum in Sabina (today the city of San Vittorino) in 590, during the pontificate of Gregory the Great. His legend goes that he was executed by the Lombards at Amiternum by being thrown off a bridge with a stone tied around his neck; his body floated to Pescara.In 1095 Pescara was a fishing village enriched with monuments and churches. In 1140 Roger of Sicily conquered the town, giving rise to a period in which it was destroyed by armies ravaging the Kingdom of Sicily. The name of &quot;Piscaria&quot; (&quot;abounding with fish&quot;) is mentioned for the first time in this period. Several seignors ruled over Pescara afterwards, including Rainaldo Orsini, Louis of Savoy, and Francesco del Borgo, the vicar of king Ladislaus of Naples, who had the fortress and the tower built. The subsequent rulers were the D&#x27;Avalos. In 1424 the famous condottiero Muzio Attendolo died here. Another adventurer, Jacopo Caldora, conquered the town in 1435 and 1439. In the following years Pescara was repeatedly attacked by the Venetians, and later, as part of the Spanish Kingdom of Naples, it was turned into a massive fortress.

In 1566 it was besieged by 105 Turk galleys. It resisted fiercely and the Ottomans only managed to ravage the surrounding territory.

At the beginning of the 18th century Pescara had some 3,000 inhabitants, half of them living in Castellammare, a small frazione of the fortress. In 1707 it was attacked by Austrian troops under the command of the Count of Wallis: the town, led by Giovanni Girolamo II Acquaviva, resisted for two months before capitulating.

Pescara was always part of the Kingdom of Naples, apart from the brief age of the Republic of Naples of 1798–99. The town was therefore attacked by the pro-Bourbon Giuseppe Pronio. In 1800 Pescara fell to French troops, becoming an important military stronghold of Joseph Bonaparte&#x27;s reign. Castellammare, which now had 3,000 inhabitants of its own, became a separate municipality.

In 1814, Pescara&#x27;s Carboneria revolted against Joachim Murat. There, on 15 May 1815, the king undersigned one of the first constitutions of the Italian Risorgimento. In the following years Pescara became a symbol of the Bourbon&#x27;s violent restoration as it housed one of the most notorious Bourbon jails. After a devastating flood in 1853, Pescara was liberated by Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s collaborator Clemente De Caesaris in 1860. Seven years later the fortress was dismantled.

In the sixty following years Pescara was included in the Province of Chieti and then merged with the adjacent town of Castellammare Adriatico and eventually became the largest city of its region. The new city suffered heavy civilian casualties when it was bombed by the Allies who were attempting to cut German supply lines during World War II. It has since been massively rebuilt, becoming a very modern coastal city of Italy.

== Main sights ==

The city is divided in two by the river in between.

The historic city center is located on the south shore, where once stood the Piazzaforte (fortified town), a military bulwark of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. There is the Bagno Borbonico (the old prison of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, built starting in 1510 by order of Charles V, which incorporated inside the remains of the Norman and Byzantine city walls). Today it houses the Museum of the Abruzzi people: the institution traces, through 13 halls dedicated to aspects of life, traditions and economy, 4,000 years of history of the Abruzzo people.

In the historic city center are the birthplace houses of Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio and Ennio Flaiano, and the San Cetteo Cathedral, built between 1933 and 1938.

On the north shore of the river there&#x27;s Piazza Italia (Italy Square), overlooked by the City Hall and the Government Building (which houses the headquarters of the Province of Pescara), both built during the Fascist era according to the fascist rationalist style and designed by the architect Vincenzo Pilotti. Pilotti designed the majority of the public buildings of the city, including the seat of the local Chamber of Commerce, of the Liceo Classico &quot;G. D&#x27;Annunzio&quot; high school, and the old seat of the court (which now houses a museum).

In the far southern part of the city, between the Nature Reserve Pineta Dannunziana and the beach, there is an elegant Art Nouveau villas district designed in 1912 by Antonino Liberi (an engineer brother-in-law of D&#x27;Annunzio). There is also the Aurum, first headquarters of a social club (called the Kursaal), then liquor factory, and today public multipurpose space.

In 2007 was built the Ponte del Mare, the largest pedestrian and cycle bridge in Italy.

On the northern waterfront, close to the &quot;Salotto Square&quot;, the main square of the city, there is the &quot;Nave&quot; (trad. the ship), a sculpture by Pietro Cascella.

<text>5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), used medically as oxitriptan, is a naturally occurring amino acid and chemical precursor as well as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin.

5-HTP can be manufactured and used as a drug and supplement with the &quot;oxitriptan&quot;. Brand names include Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. As a drug, it is used in the treatment of depression and for certain other indications.

==Production==
5-HTP is produced from the amino acid tryptophan through the action of the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase. Tryptophan hydroxylase is one of the biopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. Production of 5-HTP is the rate-limiting step in 5-HT (serotonin) synthesis. 5-HTP is normally rapidly converted to 5-HT by amino acid decarboxylase.

==Metabolism==
5-HTP is decarboxylated to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) by the enzyme aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase with the help of vitamin B6. This reaction occurs both in nervous tissue and in the liver. 5-HTP crosses the blood–brain barrier, while 5-HT does not. Excess 5-HTP, especially when administered with vitamin B6, is thought to be metabolized and excreted.

==Dietary sources==
Though 5-HTP is found in food only in insignificant quantities, it is a chemical involved intermediately in the metabolism of tryptophan, an amino acid found in all unfractionated foods, with lower total amino acid content correlating with increased tryptophan absorption.

==Use as a medication and supplement==
5-HTP is used medically and as a supplement under the name &quot;oxitriptan&quot; in the treatment of depression and for certain other indications.

It can be potentiated in combination with a peripherally selective aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) inhibitor such as carbidopa or benserazide. These agents increase the strength and duration of oxitriptan. An investigational combination formulation is oxitriptan/carbidopa.

==Research==
===Psychedelic effects===
5-HTP robustly produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at relatively high doses. Similarly, intracerebroventricular injection of serotonin, but not peripheral administration of serotonin, produces the HTR. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects.

The HTR of 5-HTP is blocked by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, which block the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics in humans, is prevented by aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) inhibitors, which block conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin, and is potentiated by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitors, which prevent the degradation of serotonin and other endogenous tryptamines. In addition, the HTR of 5-HTP is abolished by indolethylamine &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (INMT) inhibitors, which block conversion of serotonin and other endogenous tryptamines into &quot;N&quot;-methylated tryptamines, such as &quot;N&quot;-methylserotonin (NMS; norbufotenin), bufotenin (5-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine; 5-HO-DMT), and &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). These &quot;N&quot;-methylated tryptamines are well-known for their psychedelic effects, whereas serotonin itself, without biotransformation, does not seem to produce psychedelic effects. 5-HTP has not been found to produce psychedelic effects in humans, which has been attributed to the high doses required to produce such effects. The 5-HTP doses that produce the HTR in rodents are orders of magnitude higher than the doses of 5-HTP that have been used safely and therapeutically in humans. It remains unknown whether 5-HTP can produce psychedelic effects in humans.

The lack of the HTR and psychedelic effects with serotonin itself has been attributed to the fact that these effects appear to be dependent on activation of a population of intracellular 5-HT2A receptors expressed in cortical neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that lack the serotonin transporter (SERT) and are inaccessible to serotonin. Serotonin itself is too hydrophilic to enter serotonergic neurons without the SERT, whereas serotonergic psychedelics and serotonin&#x27;s &quot;N&quot;-methylated metabolites and analogues are lipophilic and readily enter these neurons. These findings may also explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and related serotonergic agents do not produce psychedelic effects.

<text>The Neve Shalom Synagogue (; ) is a Jewish congregation and synagogue, located at Büyük Hendek Caddesi 61, in the Karaköy quarter of the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul, in the Istanbul Province of Turkey. 

== History ==
The synagogue was built in response to an increase in the Jewish population in the old Galata neighborhood (today encompassed by Beyoğlu district) in the late 1930s. The Neve Shalom Synagogue is the central and largest Sephardic synagogue in Istanbul, open to service especially on Shabbats, High Holidays, bar mitzvahs, funerals and weddings.

A Jewish primary school was torn down in 1949 for that purpose and the synagogue was built on its ruins. The construction completed in 1951. Its architects were Elyo Ventura and Bernar Motola, young Turkish Jews. The inauguration of the synagogue was held on Sunday, March 25, 1951 (17 Adar 5711, Hebrew calendar), in the presence of the Chief Rabbi of Turkey of the time, &quot;Hahambaşı&quot; Rav. Rafael David Saban.

=== Terrorist attacks ===
The Neve Shalom Synagogue has been impacted by terrorist attacks in 1986, 1992, and 2003.

On September 6, 1986, gunmen opened fire during a Shabbat service, which resulted in the death of 22 people. The attack was attributed to the Palestinian militant Abu Nidal.

On March 1, 1992, a bomb attack was carried out by two men, causing no damage or casualties.

On November 16, 2003, the synagogue was hit by one of four car bomb attacks carried out in Istanbul that week (see 2003 Istanbul bombings). Even though a local Turkish militant group, the Great Eastern Islamic Raiders&#x27; Front, claimed responsibility for the attacks, police claimed the bombings were &quot;too sophisticated to have been carried out by that group&quot;, with a senior Israeli government source saying: &quot;the attack must have been at least coordinated with international terror organizations&quot;.

<text>Jacob Acker was a painter in the second half of the 15th century in Ulm, Germany. He painted the impressive altar in the St. Leonhard cemetery Chapel in Ehingen (Donau)-Risstissen, Germany which bears his inscription &quot;Jacob acker maler zu ulm hat diese dafel gemacht uf des hailligen Kreutz tag an herst. anno dmi MCCCCLXXXIII jar&quot;. This means: &quot;Jacob Acker, painter in Ulm has completed this painting on the day of the holy cross in the year of 1483&quot;.

Not much is known about this Jacob Acker &quot;der Jüngere&quot; (the younger). Most probably he belonged to the extended Ulm artist family of the Acker, many of them members of the so-called &quot;Ulmer Schule&quot; (school of Ulm). This dynasty of artists started with Jakob Acker &quot;dem Älteren&quot; (the elder), who lived around 1400. He painted some of the surviving stained glass windows of Ulm Minster. His son Hans Acker (about 1380–1461) continued with this profession and his stained glass windows can also still be admired in Ulm Minster. Whether Jacob Acker &quot;der Juengere&quot; is a son or brother of Hans Acker is not known.

Jakob Acker the Younger produced painted doors for the main pipe organ of Ulm Minster. This organ and Jakob Acker&#x27;s doors are lost. In 1529 Ulm converted to Protestantism; under the radical influence of the reformer Zwingli on the so-called &quot;Götzentag&quot;, the people of Ulm burned most of the paintings, altars, and organs of Ulm Minster in a huge fire on the square in front of the church in summer 1531. The Germans called this fundamentalist Protestant religious movement &quot;die Bilderstürmer&quot; (iconoclasts).

Because Risstissen, some 12 miles southwest of Ulm, then only partially owned by the city of Ulm remained Roman Catholic, Jakob Acker&#x27;s remarkable Risstissen altar survived. It is believed to have been part of the decoration of the then Gothic main church of Risstissen, which was removed at the end of the 18th century and replaced with the present church.

<text>The Canteen Stores Department, (CSD), is a solely owned Government of India Enterprise under Ministry of Defence and has its depot in all major military bases operated by the Indian Armed Forces.

CSD are the most profitable retail chain in India, ahead of Future &amp; Reliance Retail and sell a wide variety of products like household provisions, kitchen appliances, alcoholic drinks, cars, and sports equipment. Though originally meant exclusively for active and retired members of the Armed Forces personnel (defined as troops), it is slowly and steadily being expanded to include GREF, NCC Units at Group HQ level, TA units, CDA&#x27;s staff, Indian Ordnance Factories, Embarkation HQs, civilians paid from defence estimates, civilians paid out of civil estimates, and Paramilitary forces under operational/administrative control of the Army civilian government employees. Generally, these goods are procured by CSD in bulk, and sold at concessional rates (without taxes), compared with retail prices. CSD prices are low as the goods sold are exempt from taxes.

The development of these practices have always kept the objective of the organization in view. The department procures consumer goods and consumer-durable products in bulk directly from suppliers and positions them at 33 Area Depots (acting as wholesale depots), spread all over the country, for meeting the requirements of over 3500 URCs which function as retail outlets. Many of the URCs are located in remote/inaccessible parts of the country.

==History==
The Canteen Stores Department traces its origins to the British Raj, when the Army Canteen Board was established in India as an offshoot of the British Navy and Army Canteen Board. Although the Navy and Army Canteen Board was abolished in the UK in 1922, and was replaced by the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI), its counterpart in India continued to function until 1927. The Army Canteen Board in India was established mainly to provide canteen facilities to British troops in India through grocery shops and bars run by canteen contractors.

The Army Canteen Board was liquidated in 1927, and replaced by the Canteen Contractors&#x27; Syndicate (CCS). It was floated in the form of a limited company, under government control with its registration office at Karachi (present-day Pakistan). This company started off with a paid-up capital of , and the shareholding was confined to the canteen contractors. The CCS functioned with reasonable efficiency until the commencement of World War II. However, after the heavy buildup of the British troops in India, the CCS could no longer cope-up with the situation. Therefore, on 1 July 1942, the Government of India made use of the specific provision in Services (India) under the Directorate of Wholesale Trade and Indian Canteen Corps to handle the retail trade in operational areas. Canteen suppliers poured in from abroad and the organization functioned extremely well during the War. By 31 March 1946, it was not only able to pay back to the government the assignments of funds made available to it but could also function on its own trading capital. However, with the end of the war and homeward movement of the British troops, the import facilities dwindled and the turnover of the organization shrank. With the pulling out of troops from the operational areas, the Indian Canteen Corps was disbanded and the staff retrenched.

This was closely followed by the independence and partition of the country, and the wartime organization gave birth to two Canteen Stores Departments, i.e., CSD (India) and CSD (Pakistan). The Pakistani CSD would later bifurcate further to form CSD (Bangladesh), after the independence of Bangladesh. The retail trade, however, reverted to the contractors. A board of Liquidation was formed to oversee the liquidation of assets of the war-time organization which ceased to function from 31 December 1947. The Canteen Stores Department, the present organization, thus took birth on 1 January 1948 with a working capital of assigned to it from assets of its predecessor wartime organization. The Government of India had granted the organization a life of three years on experimental basis. The situation was reviewed in 1950 and the department was accepted as a government undertaking on a permanent basis.

== CSD AFD Portal ==
on 8 Jan 2021, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh launched the Online Portal for CSD Canteen purchases. The platform allows 45 lakh beneficiaries, including armed forces personnel and retirees, to buy AFD-I(Against Firm Demand) items like Cars, Motorcycles, and electronic Appliances online from home. Singh praised the project&#x27;s completion, aligning it with the Digital India vision. The ceremony, held in New Delhi, featured live streaming of deliveries in multiple cities, ensuring a faster and hassle-free experience. Notable attendees included Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and other military leaders. The portal marks a significant step in providing efficient access to AFD-I items.

<doc id="822665" wikidata="Q1194493" url="?curid=822665" title="Cefn Sidan">
<text>; also known as &quot;Pembrey beach&quot;) is a long sandy beach with dunes, which form the outer edge of the Pembrey Burrows between Burry Port and Kidwelly, facing southwestwards over Carmarthen Bay in South Wales. Cefn Sidan beach is backed by dunes, salt marshes, Pembrey Forest and the Pembrey Country Park.

==Geography==
Cefn Sidan stretches for nearly eight miles from the coastal town of Burry Port to Tywyn Point at the mouth of the Gwendraeth estuary near Kidwelly. The sand has small grains and the beach is backed by dunes of windblown sand. There are sand bars projecting as shoals into Carmarthen Bay at either end of the beach. The beach has a life guard patrolling during the summer months and can be accessed by ten approach routes where notices provide information for visitors. Pembrey Forest, the Saltings nature reserve and Pembrey Country Park are inland from the beach, and RAF Pembrey is also sited here.

==Wrecks==

The sands were treacherous to sailing ships and a number of vessels were certainly lost around Pembrey, including &quot;La Jeune Emma&quot; bound from the West Indies to France and blown badly off course in 1828. 13 of the 19 on board drowned, including Adeline Coquelin, the 12-year-old niece of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s divorced wife Josephine de Beauharnais. She is buried at St. Illtyds Church, Pembrey. The last large ship to be lost was the four masted windjammer, the SV &quot;Paul&quot;, carrying a cargo of timber and grounding in a storm in 1925. Today Cefn Sidan forms part of the Pembrey Country Park leisure and nature complex.

The beach is used by naturists, although this is not encouraged by the local council.

The beach is visually spectacular because of the fine structure of its sand granules – however, this makes it unsuitable for making stable structures beyond simple sand castles. On Sunday 3 August 2008 a 16-year-old boy was trapped when the tunnel he was digging in the sand dunes behind the beach collapsed. Swansea Coastguard said the alarm was raised around 19:10 BST, and a Burry Port coastguard team arrived within 15 minutes. After a helicopter air ambulance transfer to Morriston Hospital in Swansea, doctors pronounced him dead.

<text>Jaclyn Smith (born October 26, 1945) is an American actress. She is most notable for her role as Kelly Garrett in the television series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1976–1981), and was the only original female lead to remain with the series for its complete run. She reprised the role with cameo appearances in the films &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003) and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2019). Her other films include &quot;Nightkill&quot; (1980) and &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (1985). Beginning in the 1980s, she began developing and marketing her own brands of clothing and perfume.

Smith began her career in 1968 in minor roles. In 1976, she was cast in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, alongside Kate Jackson and Farrah Fawcett. The show propelled all three to stardom, including an appearance on the front cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. She was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Miniseries or TV Film for the title role in the TV film &quot;Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy&quot; (1981), and went on to star in numerous TV films and miniseries over the next 20 years, including &quot;Rage of Angels&quot; (1983), &quot;George Washington&quot; (1984), &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (1988), &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1990) and &quot;Nightmare in the Daylight&quot; (1992). She had a recurring role from 2002 to 2004 in the drama series &quot;The District&quot; and appeared as Olivia Hodges in two episodes of &quot;&quot; in 2012.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Houston, Texas, the daughter of Margaret Ellen (née Hartsfield) and Jack Smith (born Jacob Kupferschmidt), a dentist. Her father was of Russian-Jewish descent, whereas her mother had English, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh heritage. She graduated from Mirabeau B. Lamar High School in 1964. She majored in psychology and drama at Trinity University (Texas) in San Antonio but completed only a year. Instead, she moved to New York and joined the Balanchine School of American Ballet.

==Career==
===Early career===
Smith&#x27;s career aspirations shifted to modeling and acting as she found work in television commercials and print ads, including one for Listerine mouthwash. In 1966, she auditioned for the role of Victoria Winters on the ABC daytime series &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, but was not hired. The role went instead to Alexandra Moltke. 

First appearing uncredited in &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; (1969), Smith had a noticeable role in &quot;The Adventurers&quot; (1970), in which she played a journalist. Both movies were filmed in 1968. Smith followed these up with guest spots on shows like &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, &quot;Switch&quot; and &quot;The Rookies&quot;. She landed a job as a &quot;Breck girl&quot; for Breck Shampoo in 1971, and a few years later joined Farrah Fawcett as a spokesmodel for Wella Balsam shampoo. She was in the made-for-television movies &quot;Probe&quot; (1972) and &quot;Bootleggers&quot; (1974).

===&quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;===

On March 21, 1976, Smith first played Kelly Garrett in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;; the show was aired as a movie of the week, starring Smith, Kate Jackson and Farrah Fawcett as private investigators for Townsend Associates, a detective agency run by a reclusive multi-millionaire whom the women had never met. Voiced by John Forsythe, the Charles Townsend character presented cases and dispensed advice via a speakerphone to his core team of three female employees, to whom he referred as &quot;Angels&quot;. They were aided in the office and occasionally in the field by two male associates, played by character actors David Doyle and David Ogden Stiers. The program earned a huge Nielsen rating, causing the network to air it a second time and confirm production for a series, with all of the principal characters with the exception of Stiers. The series formally debuted on September 22, 1976, and ran for five seasons. The show would become a big success not only in the U.S. but, in successive years, in syndication around the world, spawning a cottage industry of peripheral products, particularly in the show&#x27;s first three seasons, including several series of bubble gum cards, two sets of fashion dolls, numerous posters, puzzles, and school supplies, novelizations of episodes, toy vans, and a board game, all featuring Smith&#x27;s likeness. The &quot;Angels&quot; also appeared on the covers of magazines around the world, from countless fan magazines to &quot;TV Guide&quot; (four times) to &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Fawcett departed at the end of the first season, and Cheryl Ladd was a successful addition to the cast, remaining until the end of the series. Jackson departed at the end of the third season, and proved harder to replace, as first Shelley Hack and then Tanya Roberts were brought in to try re-igniting the chemistry, media attention and ratings success enjoyed by the earlier teams. Smith played her role for all five seasons of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; until 1981, also portraying the Garrett character in a cameo in the 2003 feature film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; and later in the 2019 film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. 

In 1977 on the first episode of the Aaron Spelling produced comedy, &quot;The San Pedro Beach Bums&quot;, the Bums try to recruit the women of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; to judge the Miss Harbor Beauty Contest. The &quot;Angels&quot; – Smith, Jackson and Ladd – guest-star as themselves.

Christina Chambers portrayed Smith in the 2004 television film &quot;Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;.

===Interim work===
Smith&#x27;s first two acting ventures outside the Angels mold (as an actress of note) was the CBS-TV movie of the week &quot;Escape from Bogen County&quot; in 1977, and Season 1 Episode 2 of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (aired October 1, 1977) where she played Janette Bradford cruising solo while being watched by the private eye her husband hired. Then came a leading role in Joyce Haber&#x27;s &quot;The Users&quot; with Tony Curtis and John Forsythe in 1978. In 1980, Smith starred with Robert Mitchum in the suspense thriller &quot;Nightkill&quot;. Following the cancellation of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; in 1981, Smith starred in the title role of the critically acclaimed television movie &quot;Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy&quot;, earning her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. In 1983, Smith starred as Jennifer Parker in the TV movie &quot;Rage of Angels&quot;, based on the novel by Sidney Sheldon. The film was the highest rated in the Nielsen ratings the week it aired. Smith reprised the role in the 1986 sequel, &quot;Rage of Angels: The Story Continues&quot;.

===After &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;===

Smith continued to appear in a number of television movies and miniseries during the 1980s and 1990s including &quot;George Washington&quot;, &quot;The Night They Saved Christmas&quot; (both 1984), &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; (1985), &quot;Windmills of the Gods&quot; (1988) – another TV film based on a Sidney Sheldon novel – &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (also 1988); adapted from author Robert Ludlum&#x27;s novel of the same name; &quot;Settle the Score&quot; (1989), &quot;Lies Before Kisses&quot;, &quot;The Rape of Dr. Willis&quot; (both 1991), &quot;In the Arms of a Killer&quot; (1992), and several TV versions of Danielle Steel novels, including &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1990) and &quot;Family Album&quot; (1994).

In 1985, Smith starred in the feature film &quot;Deja Vu&quot;, directed by her then-husband Tony Richmond. In 1989, she played the title role in &quot;Christine Cromwell&quot;, a mystery television series based in San Francisco, but which only lasted one season. That same year, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

From 2002 to 2004, Smith had a recurring role as Vanessa Cavanaugh in the TV series &quot;The District&quot;. She reprised her role as Kelly Garrett for a cameo in the 2003 feature film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;, the only &quot;angel&quot; from the original series to appear in a film adaptation. In August 2006, Smith reunited with her angels co-stars Farrah Fawcett and Kate Jackson at the 58th Primetime Emmy awards in tribute to producer Aaron Spelling who had died earlier that year. Her appearance there subsequently led Bravo TV&#x27;s producers to cast Smith as the celebrity host of Bravo&#x27;s weekly competitive reality series &quot;Shear Genius&quot;, which began airing in March 2007. Smith hosted the show for its first two seasons.

In March 2010, Smith returned to acting after a five-year absence with a guest role on the NBC television drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. In March 2012, Smith guest-starred on &quot;&quot; as Olivia Hodges, the mother of David Hodges (played by Wallace Langham).

In January 2019, Smith was seen promoting the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; television series on the MeTV network. She reprised her role as Kelly for a cameo appearance in the 2019 feature film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Smith&#x27;s second cameo in the film franchise.

===Designing===
In 1985, Smith entered the business world with the introduction of her collection of women&#x27;s apparel for Kmart. She pioneered the concept of celebrities developing their own brands rather than merely endorsing others. A season 15 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;The Fat and the Furriest&quot;) lampooned Smith&#x27;s many business successes, portraying her as having her own line of axe heads. In May 2009, Smith allowed a documentary crew to profile her home life, design philosophy and relationship with Kmart in an online video series sponsored by Kmart. Her foray into home furnishings was extended to Kmart stores in the fall of 2008, with the chain&#x27;s introduction of its Jaclyn Smith Today product line of bedding and bath accessories.

In September 2008, Smith launched the STYLE by Jaclyn Smith wig collection for Paula Young Wigs. The wigs are designed by hair stylist José Eber.
In 2024, she had a line of beautiful woman&#x27;s clothing for sale on the Home Shopping channel (HSN).
==Personal life==
Smith has been married four times. Her first marriage was to actor Roger Davis (1968–1975). She was married to Dennis Cole from 1978-1981; he was an actor who appeared on several episodes of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. Smith remained close to Joe Cole, Dennis&#x27;s son from a previous marriage. Joe was murdered in 1991 at the age of 30, a crime which remains unsolved. In 1981, Smith married filmmaker Tony Richmond, with whom she had two children, Gaston (b. 1982) and Spencer Margaret (b. 1985), before divorcing Richmond in 1989. Smith has been married to Houston cardiothoracic surgeon Brad Allen since 1997.

Smith was treated for breast cancer in 2003. In 2010, Smith was featured in &quot;1 a Minute&quot;, a documentary about breast cancer.

<doc id="822700" wikidata="Q2021327" url="?curid=822700" title="Duvet">
<text>A duvet ( , ; ), usually called a comforter or (&quot;down-filled&quot;) quilt in American English, and a doona in Australian English, is a type of bedding consisting of a soft flat bag filled with down, feathers, wool, cotton, silk, or a synthetic alternative, and is typically protected with a removable cover, analogous to a pillow and pillow case. The term &quot;duvet&quot; is mainly British, especially in reference to the bedding; rarely used in US English, it often refers to the cover. Sleepers often use a duvet without a top bed sheet, as the duvet cover can readily be removed and laundered as often as the bottom sheet.

Duvets (known there as eiderdowns, in translation) originated in rural Europe and were filled with the down feathers of ducks or geese. The best quality feathers are taken from the eider duck, which is known for its effectiveness as a thermal insulator. Prior to the uptake of the duvet as a popular bedding option in Britain from the 1970s onwards, the British &quot;eiderdown&quot;, while also a feather-filled object, was essentially thinner than its &quot;continental&quot; equivalent and was used on top of a regular sheet and blankets for extra warmth when needed, and thus did not simplify the process of making the bed.

== Name ==
The word &quot;duvet&quot; is of French origin, meaning &quot;down&quot;. Its first known mention in English came in 1759, when Samuel Johnson used it in one of &quot;The Idler&quot; series of essays. Duvets are often more commonly known by other names outside of Europe.

=== Australia and Europe ===
Originally called a &quot;continental quilt&quot;, duvets are commonly referred to in Australia by the generic trademark &quot;doona&quot;. The Doona brand of duvets were originally manufactured by the Melbourne-based textile company Kimptons and became popular in the 1970s, with the brandname eventually becoming a generic term in Australian English. After a series of mergers and acquisitions, Tontine Group has held the Doona trademark since 1991. Kimptons&#x27; adoption of the term &quot;doona&quot; is generally held to be from the Danish &quot;dyne&quot; (pronounced du-neh), meaning eiderdown, originally from the Norse &quot;dýna&quot;. The word occurs in similar form also in Swedish and Norwegian; elsewhere other variants are also found such as &quot;dunyha&quot; in Hungarian and also, with the same meaning, in Romani or Romany, the language of the travelling Romani people of Europe.

=== Asia ===
In South Asian countries like India and Pakistan, duvets are known as &quot;ralli quilts&quot; or razai.

=== Americas ===
In American English, a duvet may be called a &quot;comforter&quot;; however, comforter is generally used to refer to a slightly different type of bedding that is not as thick, does not have a cover, and is often used over a top sheet.

==History==
Records show the earliest duvets were made in China, around 3000 B.C. During the early middle ages, duvets of eider (duck) down were used by people on the northern coast of Norway. The down from eider has been used for duvets, at least for a thousand years.. The Oseberg viking ship AD 820 contained, amongst the deposits, down duvets. In the 15th century, featherbeds (mattresses) were used by rich monarchs in continental Europe and in England, though not by their courtiers. From the 16th century, wealthy people all over continental Europe began buying and using feather duvets.

Feather duvets came late to England. Samuel Pepys slept under one on 9 September 1665 while visiting his friend Captain George Cocke, whose wife was from Danzig. Paul Rycaut was among the first to try to promote the duvet in England. Around 1700, he sent six-pound bags of down to his friends with instructions, warning that &quot;the coverlet must be quilted high and in large panes, or otherwise it will not be warme&quot;. He also tried to sell them without success.

In the mid-18th century, Thomas Nugent, a Briton on a grand tour then passing through Westphalia, observed with surprise:
Feather coverings came to be used in the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century, just as feather mattresses became common, and were unsurprisingly known as &quot;continental quilts&quot;. They were not, however, universal. Of a British traveller in Germany in the 1930s, it was said that &quot;She even learned to like feather quilts (&#x27;they don&#x27;t seem to know about blankets – perhaps they didn&#x27;t have them in the middle ages&#x27;)&quot;. Duvets remained uncommon in Britain until the 1960s.

Duvets are the most common form of bed covering, especially in northern Europe. They became popular throughout the world in the late 20th century. They are reported as being introduced to Britain by Sir Terence Conran who sold them in via his London Habitat store commencing in 1964; Conran had encountered them in Sweden in the previous decade and believed that they offered an alternative to the traditional, cumbersome British method of bed-making that involved a top sheet, blankets, with sometimes also a thinner (British style) &quot;eiderdown&quot; on the top for extra warmth. British users gradually came to prefer the style of sleeping under a duvet for the freedom of movement it offered and the reduced feel of weight on the body, in addition to the simplification of the bed making process.

==Description==
A modern duvet, like a sleeping bag, may be filled with down or feathers of various quality and cost, or silk, wool, cotton, or artificial fibers such as polyester batting.
Duvets can be made warmer than blankets without becoming heavy, and thereby can reduce the complexity of making a bed, as they can be used without additional blankets, quilts or other bed covers. Although bed making is indeed simpler using a duvet than its traditional &quot;sheet plus blankets&quot; equivalent, this may come at a cost: since a duvet is, by its nature, a fixed thermal efficiency or &quot;tog rating&quot;, multiple duvets, of different tog ratings, may be required to be purchased per individual bed to suit the variation in warmth as required for the different seasons if adamant on not tossing a blanket on top for added warmth.

=== Hygiene ===
The duvet itself, just like an eiderdown, may be cleaned much more rarely, and depending on its contents, may require specialist dry cleaning.
Thus something easily washable is usually placed between the sleeper and the duvet, that can be removed and laundered as often as the bottom sheet and pillow cases. While it is perfectly possible to use top sheets, the common practice is specially made bag-covers, usually of cotton or a cotton-polyester blend.
While a comforter is fundamentally the same as a duvet in terms of construction, it is used somewhat differently. In the United States, comforters are used on top of the flat sheet, often without a cover.

==Thermal performance (tog rating)==
Manufacturers rate the performance of their duvets in togs (10 °C difference between the outsides at 1 Watt), as a measurement of thermal insulation. This enables the purchaser to select a duvet appropriate to the season: the higher the tog rating, the warmer the duvet.

A few manufacturers have marketed combined duvet sets consisting of one 4.5 tog and one 9.0 tog. The light-weight one is for summer and the medium one for spring and autumn; snapped together, 13.5 togs is designed for winter. Manufacturers may also offer up to 15 tog duvets.

In some countries, such as France, the warmth of a duvet is rated in grams per square metre (g/m2) instead of togs. The two systems are incompatible because, for example, a 250 g/m2 polyester filling and a 250 g/m2 feather filling have the same weight but offer different levels of thermal insulation and therefore different tog ratings. However, typical all-season sets are sold as a pair of 200 g/m2 and 300 g/m2 duvets, creating a combined 500 g/m2 winter duvet, which would therefore be expected to match 13.5 togs.

==Disadvantages==
Duvets/continental quilts/doonas are generally marketed as providing a more comfortable, wrap-around sleep experience, better freedom of movement for the sleeper, and easier/quicker bed making compared with the traditional &quot;sheet and blankets&quot; approach commonly found in the U.K. prior to their adoption. They do, however, come with some disadvantages, namely:
*The best duvets (filled with either 100%, or a high percentage of down) are expensive; cheaper equivalents (filled with either 100%, or a high percentage of feather, or a synthetic filling) are either heavier, or less comfortable for the same tog rating
*Duvets filled with feathers and/or down cannot be machine washed at home, but require specialist care
*Duvets tend to come in a fixed tog (warmth) rating, so a winter-grade duvet may be too warm for summer use, and vice versa
*Not all down is ethically produced (being a product of animal farming); certified ethically produced down products generally cost more
*Some people have allergies to products filled with feathers and/or down; for these, synthetic fillings are recommended.

==Standards and sizes==

Modern manufacturing conventions have resulted in a large number of sizes and standards.

==In popular culture==
In the story &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot;, published in 1835, H.C. Andersen wrote about a princess lying on ten eiderdown duvets.

An eiderdown is mentioned in the Pink Floyd songs Julia Dream, Flaming and A Pillow of Winds.

The term &quot;duvet day&quot; is used in some countries to describe an allowance of one or more days a year when employees can simply phone in and say that they are not coming in to work, even though they have no leave booked and are not ill. The provision of this benefit became fashionable in the late 1990s with many larger employers in the UK.

In the 1999 American film &quot;Fight Club&quot;, Tyler Durden gives a speech in which he describes duvets as pretentious blankets:Do you know what a duvet is? [...] It’s a blanket. It’s just a blanket. Then why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is? Is this essential to our survival in the hunter-gatherer sense of the word? No

<text>Johann Heinrich Acker (12 August 1647 – 21 September 1719) was a German writer. He sometimes wrote under the name of Melissander.

He was taught in his native city of Naumburg and at the regional school of Pforta (Schulpforta). Beginning in 1669, he studied in Jena where he became magister and adjunct of the philosophical faculty. In 1673 he became adjunct and pastor in near Gotha, and in 1689 he became superintendent and court chaplain in Blankenhain. He resigned in 1717 due to an illness and moved to Gotha, where he died in 1719.

<doc id="822724" wikidata="Q1137765" url="?curid=822724" title="Exchequer of Pleas">
<text>The Exchequer of Pleas, or Court of Exchequer, was a court that dealt with matters of equity, a set of legal principles based on natural law and common law in England and Wales. Originally part of the , or King&#x27;s Council, the Exchequer of Pleas split from the in the 1190s to sit as an independent central court. The Court of Chancery&#x27;s reputation for tardiness and expense resulted in much of its business transferring to the Exchequer. The Exchequer and Chancery, with similar jurisdictions, drew closer together over the years until an argument was made during the 19th century that having two seemingly identical courts was unnecessary. As a result, the Exchequer lost its equity jurisdiction. With the Judicature Acts, the Exchequer was formally dissolved as a judicial body by an Order in Council on 16 December 1880.

The Exchequer&#x27;s jurisdiction at various times was common law, equity or both. Initially a court of both common law and equity, it lost much of its common law jurisdiction after the formation of the Court of Common Pleas. From then on, it concerned itself with equitable matters and those common law matters that it had discretion to try, such as actions brought against Exchequer officials and actions brought by the monarch against non-paying debtors. 

With the writ of quominus, which allowed the Exchequer to look at &quot;common&quot; cases between subject and subject, this discretionary area was significantly expanded, and it soon regained its standing in common law matters. Cases were formally taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but in practice were heard by the Barons of the Exchequer, judicial officials led by the Chief Baron. Other court officials included the King&#x27;s Remembrancer, who appointed all other officials and kept the Exchequer&#x27;s records, and the sworn and side clerks, who acted as attorneys to parties to a case.

==History==

===Origins===
It was originally claimed that the Exchequer was based on a similar Norman court. While there are many records of the Exchequer&#x27;s work in England, there is no evidence of a similar body in pre-conquest Normandy. The first reliable records come from the time of Henry I, when the sole surviving Pipe roll from his reign shows the Exchequer working out of the king&#x27;s palace as part of the &quot;curia regis&quot;. The &quot;curia regis&quot; followed the king as he travelled, rather than sitting at any one fixed location, and was held in York, London and Northampton at various times. 

By the late 12th century it had taken to sitting in a fixed location, the one body of government in England to do so. By the 1170s it was possible to distinguish the Exchequer&#x27;s work from that of the other parts of the &quot;curia regis&quot;, although the king of the time considered the Exchequer to simply be an element of the &quot;curia&quot;. It was referred to as the &quot;Curia Regis ad Scaccarium&quot;, or King&#x27;s Court at Exchequer. The word &quot;Exchequer&quot; derives from the chequered cloth laid on a table for the purposes of counting money. 

In the 1190s the Exchequer began separating from the &quot;curia regis&quot;, a process which continued until the beginning of the 13th century. Academics have suggested that this was due to an increasing demand on the revenue side of the court, which led to part of the common law element being split off to form the Court of Common Pleas. Although the Exchequer of Pleas was the first common law court, it was the last to separate from the &quot;curia regis&quot;.

===Increasing work and transformation===

There are few records known to date from before 1580, as bills were not dated before then. Until the 16th century, the Exchequer carried out its duties with little variation in its function or practice. A small court, the Exchequer handled around 250 cases a year, compared to 2,500 in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench and 10,000 in the Court of Common Pleas. Under the Tudors, the Exchequer&#x27;s political, judicial and fiscal importance all increased. This was partially thanks to the Lord High Treasurer. Although the Lord Chancellor was more traditionally important, the Lord High Treasurers from 1547 to 1612 were politically influential figures, including Robert Cecil, Thomas Sackville and William Paulet. Since the Lord High Treasurer was head of the Exchequer, with the Treasurer&#x27;s increased influence came increased importance for the Exchequer.

The appointment of the second and third Dukes of Norfolk as Lord High Treasurers from 1501 to 1546 led to a gradual reduction in the Exchequer&#x27;s power. The Dukes were seen by the government as too independent to be trusted with any real power, but too useful to be removed. As a result, to indirectly reduce their power, the Exchequer was deliberately weakened. When William Paulet was appointed Treasurer in 1546 the Exchequer again increased in power, absorbing the Court of Augmentations and Court of First Fruits and Tenths by 1554. The Exchequer was assisted in this period by Thomas Fanshawe, the Queen&#x27;s Remembrancer. A capable man, Fanshawe was often consulted by the Barons of the Exchequer as to the best way to administer the court, and helped standardise pleadings, allowing the Exchequer to cope during a period of increased business. Fanshawe&#x27;s administrative reforms were considered excellent, and his work continued to be used as the standard until the 1830s.

Exchequer business increased under James and Charles I, before the English Civil War disrupted the courts. With the increasing use of the Writ of Quominus, which allowed royal debtors to bring a case against a third party who owed them money if it was that lack of money which prevented them paying the king and the new regime, the Exchequer actively transformed from a &quot;tax court&quot; dealing with civil cases to a dedicated court of equity and common law.

The Civil War caused four equitable courts to be dissolved. The Court of Star Chamber was formally dissolved in 1641, the Council of the North and Council of Wales and the Marches had their equity jurisdiction stripped by the same Act of Parliament, and the Court of Requests became invalid after the Privy Seal was invalidated by the outcome of the English Civil War, as it was dependent on the Seal for its authority. After the War ended there were only two equity courts remaining, the Exchequer and Court of Chancery. The Court of Chancery was publicly reviled for its slow pace and because it was led by the Lord Chancellor John Finch, a political figure who had been intimately involved in the conflict. As a result, the Exchequer increased in importance as a court, although it is not known whether its active transformation was a judicial or political decision.

===Loss of equity jurisdiction and dissolution===

By the beginning of the 18th century, the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer of Pleas was firmly cemented, and it was considered a viable alternative to the Court of Chancery. As a result, each court cited the other&#x27;s cases as precedent, and drew closely together. In addition, 18th-century Acts of Parliament treated them in the same way, merely referring to &quot;courts of equity&quot; rather than mentioning them individually. At the same time, the Treasury became more and more important, leading to a reduction in the inferior Exchequer&#x27;s influence. Despite these warning signs, the Exchequer continued to flourish, maintaining a large amount of business, and by 1810 was almost entirely an equity court, having little common law work. 

The court&#x27;s equity side became deeply unpopular during the 1830s because many cases were heard by a single judge with no real prospect of appeal; while cases could be taken to the House of Lords, it was highly expensive and time-consuming to do so. The Court of Chancery, however, had long had an established method of appealing to the Lords, and later introduced an intermediary appellate court – the Court of Appeal in Chancery. 

At the same time, many elements of the Exchequer&#x27;s equity business had dried up, with the Tithe Commutation Act 1836 ending their tithe cases and the Insolvent Debtors Act 1820 establishing the Court of Bankruptcy, removing cases of insolvency from the Exchequer. The Exchequer&#x27;s fees were also higher than those of the Court of Chancery, and with both courts now using almost identical precedent it was seen as unnecessary to maintain two equitable courts. As a result, the Administration of Justice Act 1841 formally dissolved the equitable jurisdiction of the court.

With the loss of its equitable jurisdiction, the Exchequer became a dedicated common law court, and thus fell prey to the same fate as the other two common law courts (the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench and the Court of Common Pleas) during the late 19th century. There had long been calls for the merger of the courts, and in 1828 Henry Brougham, a Member of Parliament, complained in Parliament that as long as there were three courts unevenness was inevitable, saying that &quot;It is not in the power of the courts, even if all were monopolies and other restrictions done away, to distribute business equally, as long as suitors are left free to choose their own tribunal&quot;, and that there would always be a favourite court, which would therefore attract the best lawyers and judges and entrench its position.

In 1867 a commission was created to look into issues with the central courts, and the outcome were the Judicature Acts, under which all the central courts were made part of a single Supreme Court of Judicature, with the three central common law courts becoming three of the five divisions of the Supreme Court; this was not designed to be permanent, but rather to avoid having to retire or demote two of the three Chief Justices to allow a single head of the Supreme Court, as this would have violated the constitutional principle that senior justices were irremovable. By sheer chance Fitzroy Kelly and Alexander Cockburn, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Lord Chief Justice of England, respectively, both died in 1880, allowing the merger of the common law divisions of the Supreme Court into a single division, the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division, under John Coleridge, who had been Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and became Lord Chief Justice of England, by an Order in Council of 16 December 1880. At this point, the Exchequer of Pleas formally ceased to exist.

==Jurisdiction and relationship with other courts==

The Exchequer&#x27;s position as a court originally came from an informal process of argument between the king and his debtors as to how much money was owed; by the 13th century, this had evolved into formal court proceedings. Therefore, its initial jurisdiction, as defined by the Statute of Rhuddlan, was as a court where only the king could bring cases. The Exchequer became the first &quot;tax court&quot;, where the king was the plaintiff and the debtor the defendant. The king was represented by the Attorney General, allowing him to avoid much of the legal costs associated with a court case. 

The &quot;next logical step&quot; was to allow debtors to collect on their own debts in the Exchequer, so that they could better pay the king; this was done through the Writ of Quominus. The Exchequer also had sole jurisdiction to try cases against their own officials and other figures engaged in collecting the royal revenue. The court was also used to prosecute clerics who, while innocent, had come close to committing an infraction; as the plaintiff was represented by the Attorney General, the costs were reduced, and as the Attorney General had no incentive to compromise it was more threatening to the cleric. In 1649 the Exchequer formally extended its common law and equity jurisdiction, becoming a fully fledged court of law able to hear any civil case.

The main focus of the Exchequer was the collection of royal revenue as part of the greater Exchequer, which was officially undertaken by the Lord High Treasurer. The Exchequer was unique in having jurisdiction in matters of both equity and the common law, the latter initially curtailed after the Magna Carta and reserved for the Court of King&#x27;s Bench and Court of Common Pleas, although it later grew back. This process of common law and equity was reversed; during the 16th century the Exchequer was solely a common law body, with the equity jurisdiction only again becoming relevant near the end of the Tudor period. W. H. Bryson argues that this happened during the reign of Edward I. By 1590 the Exchequer&#x27;s jurisdiction over equity cases was confirmed, and it was handling a significant number a year, including disputes over trusts, mortgages, tithes and copyholds; since taxation was ever-present, it was not difficult to show that the dispute prevented the payment of a debt to the monarch, allowing the Writ of Quominus.

The Exchequer stood on an equal footing with the other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King&#x27;s Bench and Court of Chancery), with cases transferred easily from one to another, although there were problems in the case of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench. The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of &quot;supersedeas&quot;, but the King&#x27;s Bench represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the Exchequer to the King&#x27;s Bench and assert that the case&#x27;s claimant was an officer of the Exchequer, necessitating his trial there rather than in the King&#x27;s Bench. 

The Exchequer maintained a clear rule with the other equity court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in one could not be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The Exchequer had superior status over inferior courts of equity, able to take cases from them and countermand their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the Exchequer, particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records of disputes between the two.

As well as appeals to the Exchequer Chamber, the court also allowed appeals to the House of Lords, which was first used in 1660 for the case of &quot;Fanshawe v Impey&quot; and confirmed in 1677.

==Officers==

===Treasurer===
The formal head of the Exchequer for much of its existence was the Lord High Treasurer, who was tasked with collecting royal revenues. Originally a clerk, he was supervised by the Chief Justiciar, and only became head of the court after this position was abolished during the reign of Henry III. During the reign of Elizabeth I the Treasurer&#x27;s other duties began to increase, and he played less of a role in the Exchequer&#x27;s affairs. By the 17th century, the Lord High Treasurer had been replaced by a dedicated Treasurer of the Exchequer (although earlier writs show that the Lord High Treasurer had been independently given this title), who was ceremoniously presented with a white staff by the monarch. The Treasurer, while active in the revenue side of the Exchequer, played little or no active role in the Exchequer of Pleas.

===Chancellor===
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, independently head of the Court of Chancery, was also involved in the Exchequer of Pleas as a check on the Lord High Treasurer. He evolved out of the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s clerk, or &quot;clericus cancellari&quot;, who sat in the Exchequer and was responsible for correcting and sealing writs of summons, also holding the Exchequer&#x27;s copy of the Great Seal. The earliest appearances of such a clerk in the records come from 1220, when a document was signed by Robert de Neville, &quot;cancellarius&quot;. The Lord Chancellors of the time were clergymen with little interest in judicial or fiscal matters; as a result, the clerk became more independent from the Chancellor and, by the 1230s, became a royal appointment holding the seal independently of the Lord Chancellor, known as the Chancellor of the Exchequer. 

After 1567 the Chancellor was additionally confirmed as the Under-Treasurer of the Exchequer, allowing him to carry out the Treasurer&#x27;s duties when he was unavailable. The Chancellor was appointed by letters patent, and until 1672 it was a life appointment, then changed to an office &quot;to hold only during the pleasures of the crown&quot;. Until the English Civil War the Chancellor of the Exchequer was a judicial office with little political standing; after the War, however, it became seen as a &quot;stepping stone&quot; to higher political appointments. After 1672 it again became an administrative and judicial office, until 1714, when the Chancellor&#x27;s position as head of the Treasury made it an important appointment again.

===Barons===
The main judicial officers were the Barons of the Exchequer, or &quot;barones scaccari&quot;, who were originally the same judges as those of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, only becoming independent positions after the Exchequer&#x27;s separation from the &quot;curia regis&quot;. In the early years of the Exchequer&#x27;s existence, the Barons were the chief auditors of the accounts of England, a role passed to dedicated auditors during the reign of Edward II. With the Exchequer&#x27;s expansion during the Tudor era, the Barons became more important; where previously only the Chief Baron had been appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, with the other Barons mere barristers, it became practice for all Barons of the Exchequer to be Serjeants. This further increased the Exchequer&#x27;s standing, since for the first time it put the Exchequer at the same level as the Court of Common Pleas and Court of King&#x27;s Bench, where all judges were already required to be Serjeants.
At least one Baron sat to hear a case, with convention insisting on a maximum of four Barons after the rule of Edward IV; as a mere convention, it was occasionally broken. When one Baron was ill or otherwise unable to sit it was felt appropriate to appoint a fifth, as in 1604 when Baron Sotherton was ill, and in 1708, when Baron Smith was called to Edinburgh to be a temporary Chief Baron of the Scottish Exchequer. In 1830 a fifth Baron was permanently added to relieve court congestion; at the same time, a fifth judge was added to the Court of Common Pleas and King&#x27;s Bench. 

The First Baron was the Chief Baron of the Exchequer; if the Chancellor and Treasurer were unavailable, he was the head of the court. When he was also absent the Second Baron took charge, and so on; in one case in 1659, the Fourth Baron was the only judge available. The Second, Third and Fourth Barons were known as puisne Barons; initially treated as individual offices, after the time of James I the order was determined by the judges&#x27; seniority. Unlike in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, the different positions did not equate to different degrees of power; each Baron had an equal vote in decisions.

Barons were appointed by letters patent and sworn in by the Lord Chancellor, head of the judiciary. During the 16th century they held their offices &quot;quamdiu se bene gesserint&quot;, or &quot;during good behaviour&quot;. A Baron could leave the Exchequer in one of three situations; resignation, death, or appointment to another court, which automatically made their office void. The letters patent expired after the death of each monarch; when the new one was crowned, a Baron would have to receive a new patent or leave his office. This was mostly a routine event; from 1550 to 1714 all but nine continued in office after the crowning of a new monarch.

===Remembrancer===
The King&#x27;s Remembrancer was the chief clerk of the Exchequer, handling all bills of equity. He was the equivalent of the Court of Chancery&#x27;s Master of the Rolls, in that he headed up the clerical side of the court. As well as his duties to the judicial body, the King&#x27;s Remembrancer also handled the revenue side of the Exchequer, a jurisdiction established in the 14th century. He was originally able to appoint all the sworn clerks, but by the 16th century this jurisdiction had been limited to appointing one of the 24 side clerks, with the sworn clerks appointing the rest. In a similar way, while he was originally in charge of the court&#x27;s records and the enrolment of writs, by the 17th century he no longer possessed the keys to the record office, and the sworn clerks had the exclusive right to search the records. His main job was instead quasi-judicial, examining certain witnesses, taking minutes in court and settling disputes over &quot;scandal and impertinence&quot;.

The Remembrancer was appointed for life, and qualified to appoint a deputy, the first of whom, John West, was appointed by Sir Christopher Hatton in 1616. From 1565 until 1716, the office was kept in the Fanshawe family, starting with Henry Fanshawe and ending with Simon Fanshawe. After 1820, the Remembrancer&#x27;s broad duties were split up by the Court of Exchequer (England) etc. Act 1820. To replace him, two masters were appointed, one of whom was to be the accountant general. These officials were to be appointed by the Chief Baron of the Exchequer from barristers of five years standing, holding offices during good behaviour and unable to appoint a deputy. The masters handled the taking of minutes previously undertaken by the Remembrancer, with the accountant general overseeing all money paid into the court, which was deposited in the Bank of England; previously the Remembrancer had held complete discretion as to what to do with the money.

===Other offices===
Other offices included the sworn clerks, the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King&#x27;s Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so called because they were sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as an attorney for the parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24 side clerks, of whom each sworn clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a sworn clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk&#x27;s name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to sworn clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the depositions. 

In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron&#x27;s name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King&#x27;s Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.
