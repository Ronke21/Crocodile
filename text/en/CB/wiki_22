<text>The culture of Indonesia () has been shaped by the interplay of indigenous customs and diverse foreign influences. With over 600 distinct ethnic groups, including significant Austronesian and Melanesian cultures, contributing to its rich traditions, languages, and customs, Indonesia is a melting pot of diversity. Positioned along ancient trade routes between the Far East, South Asia, and the Middle East, the country has absorbed cultural practices influenced by Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam, and Christianity. These influences have created a complex cultural tapestry that often differs from the original indigenous cultures.

Examples of the fusion of Islam with Hinduism include Javanese Abangan belief. Balinese dances have stories about ancient Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms, while Islamic art forms and architecture are present in Sumatra, especially in the Minangkabau and Aceh regions. Traditional art, music and sport are combined in a martial art form called Pencak Silat.

The Western world has influenced Indonesia in science, technology and modern entertainment such as television shows, film and music, as well as political system and issues. India has notably influenced Indonesian songs and movies. A popular type of song is the Indian-rhythmical dangdut, which is often mixed with Arabic, Javanese and Malay folk music.

Despite the influences of foreign culture, some remote Indonesian regions still preserve uniquely indigenous culture. Indigenous ethnic groups Batak, Nias, Mentawai, Asmat, Dani, Sumba, Dayak, Toraja and many others are still practising their ethnic rituals, customs and wearing traditional clothes.

Indonesia currently holds sixteen items of UNESCO&#x27;s Intangible Cultural Heritage, including wayang puppet theatre, kris, batik, education and training in Indonesian batik, angklung, saman dance, noken, three genres of traditional Balinese dance, pinisi ship, pencak silat, gamelan, jamu, and reog. Additionally, pantun, kebaya, and kolintang were inscribed through joint nominations.

==Traditional performing arts==

===Music===


Indonesia treasures a diverse range of traditional music, notably from Java and Bali, where gamelan holds a central place. Originating in Java, gamelan is renowned for its intricate compositions and unique ensemble of instruments, including metallophones like gambang and bonang, as well as resonant gongs such as kenong and gong ageng. Beyond its musical complexities, gamelan embodies profound cultural narratives and communal identities, playing a pivotal role in rituals, ceremonies, and local storytelling traditions. The rhythmic patterns and melodic interplays reflect a deep connection to spiritual and social contexts, offering insight into the historical and philosophical underpinnings of Indonesian society. UNESCO&#x27;s designation of gamelan as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity underscores its cultural importance in Indonesia.

In West Sumatra, traditional music includes the talempong and saluang of the Minangkabau people, used in ceremonies. The Batak people in North Sumatra play instruments like the gondang (tuned drums), gordang sambilan and the hasapi (traditional lute). In Sulawesi, the Toraja people use bamboo instruments, such as the pa’pompang flute. The Bugis and Makassar people of South Sulawesi play the Kacaping, a plucked string instrument. In Kalimantan, the Dayak people have a rich musical heritage with instruments like the sape (traditional lute) and various gongs. In Papua, traditional music often involves drums and bamboo flutes, reflecting their cultural and spiritual practices.

The angklung, a traditional musical instrument from West Java made from bamboo, has also received international recognition from UNESCO as part of the intangible cultural heritage. In contrast, the Sasando from East Nusa Tenggara features an instrument made from a split leaf of the Lontar palm, resembling a harp and producing a soothing sound.

Kroncong is traditional music genre in Indonesia, featuring guitars and ukuleles. It was introduced by Portuguese traders in the 15th century. Traditional “Keroncong Tugu” groups can be found in North Jakarta and Maluku, showcasing strong Portuguese influences. A modern variation of kroncong is known as Pop Kroncong.

Other notable traditional music genres in Indonesia include Tanjidor from Betawi culture in Jakarta, involving a brass and woodwind ensemble, and Jaipongan from West Java, combining Sundanese music with dance. In the Maluku Islands, Sawat Lenso dance music blends Portuguese and local influences, featuring instruments like the rebana (tambourine) and the ukulele. The music of Nias includes unique instruments such as the aramba (a type of gong) and the doli-doli (a type of slit drum).

On June 29, 1965, Koes Plus, a leading Indonesian pop group of the 1960s to 1980s, was imprisoned in Glodok, West Jakarta, for playing Western-style music. After the resignation of President Sukarno, the law was rescinded, and in the 1970s, the Glodok prison was dismantled and replaced with a large shopping mall. The story of Koes Plus highlights Indonesia&#x27;s evolving musical landscape and cultural exchanges.

Dangdut, a genre that emerged in the 1970s, is a blend of local Indonesian music with Indian, Arabic, and Javanese, Malay influences. It is characterized by its distinct drum beat and flute melodies. Dangdut has become one of the most popular music genres in Indonesia, known for its lively rhythms and often performed at various social gatherings and events.

===Dance===

Indonesian dance reflects the rich diversity of culture from the many ethnic groups that compose the nation of Indonesia. The dances showcase Austronesian roots, Melanesian tribal dance forms, and influences from foreign countries such as Indian subcontinent, Mainland China, and the Middle East, as well as European styles introduced during colonization. With over 3,000 distinct dances, each ethnic group contributes its own unique styles and traditions. Indonesian dances can be categorized into three historical eras: the Prehistoric Era, the Hindu-Buddhist Era, and the Islamic Era, and they fall into two main genres: court dance and folk dance.

Sumatra showcases a rich tapestry of traditional dances that highlight its cultural diversity. In West Sumatra, the Tari Piring (Plate Dance) demonstrates skill in balancing plates with graceful movements, symbolizing harmony and elegance. Aceh&#x27;s Saman dance captivates with its fast-paced rhythm and synchronized movements performed by groups, embodying communal and spiritual values. In 2011, UNESCO officially recognized Aceh&#x27;s traditional Saman dance as an Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. In North Sumatra, the lively Tor-tor dance, performed by the Batak people, is known for its energetic movements and significant ritualistic role. Riau stands out with the elegant Melayu dance, characterized by graceful gestures often seen at ceremonial occasions. Meanwhile, Jambi and Bangka Belitung celebrates the Zapin dance, seamlessly blending Arabic influences with local traditions. Gending Sriwijaya in South Sumatra preserves the cultural legacy of the ancient Srivijaya Empire through its rhythmic music and intricate choreography.

In Java, court dances like Bedhaya and Serimpi are performed in the royal courts of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Bedhaya, considered sacred, features slow, deliberate movements symbolizing harmony between earthly and divine realms. Serimpi emphasizes grace and refinement, often depicting stories from Javanese mythology and royal traditions with elegant movements and intricate patterns.

The topeng dance (Mask Dance) is another prominent Javanese tradition where dancers wear masks portraying characters from Javanese folklore, history, and mythology. Accompanied by traditional gamelan music, the dance combines dramatic and theatrical elements. Gambyong dance, known for its graceful movements, is performed during ceremonies and celebrations in Central Java. This dance conveys messages of joy and cultural pride, showcasing Javanese aesthetics and values influenced by Hindu, Buddhist, and Islamic traditions that have shaped Java&#x27;s artistic landscape over centuries. Folk dances like Kuda Lumping feature performers mimicking riding horses made of woven bamboo. This energetic dance, accompanied by lively gamelan music, highlights rhythmic movements that captivate audiences. Reog, originating from Ponorogo, East Java, combines dance, drama, and elaborate costumes to depict mythical stories and mystical creatures with powerful movements and mesmerizing displays.
In Bali, dance forms a fundamental aspect of the culture, encompassing various genres such as Wali (sacred dances), Bebali (semi-sacred dances), and Balih-balihan (entertainment dances). in 2015 UNESCO recognizes three genres of traditional dance in Bali, as -Intangible cultural heritage. The island&#x27;s dances are characterized by their profound spiritual significance and vibrant artistic expressions. One of the most celebrated dances is the Legong, known for its delicate finger movements, intricate footwork, and expressive gestures that narrate mythical stories and cultural themes. Another iconic Balinese dance is the Barong dance, a dramatic performance portraying the eternal battle between good (Barong) and evil (Rangda). This dance is not only a cultural ritual but also a captivating theatrical spectacle that mesmerizes audiences with its elaborate costumes, dynamic choreography, and symbolic narrative.

The Kecak dance, also known as the “Ramayana Monkey Chant”, is another notable example of Bali&#x27;s rich dance heritage. This unique dance-drama combines rhythmic chanting and synchronized movements of a large group of male performers, retelling episodes from the Hindu epic Ramayana. The rhythmic chanting of &quot;cak&quot; creates a hypnotic atmosphere, making Kecak a distinctive and memorable cultural experience in Bali.

In Kalimantan, the Dayak people uphold rich cultural traditions through their captivating performances, one of which is the Hudoq dance. This vibrant and intricate dance involves wearing elaborate masks and costumes designed to represent various spirits. The Hudoq is not merely a performance but a profound spiritual ritual aimed at seeking blessings for a bountiful harvest. The Kancet Papatai, which depicts scenes of bravery and heroism, is a significant part of Dayak culture. This dance tells stories of ancient warriors and their battles, using energetic movements and traditional weaponry to convey a sense of valor and strength.

Kalimantan is also home to the Banjarese. The Banjar people perform the Baksa kembang dance, a graceful and elegant performance that involves intricate hand movements and beautiful floral arrangements. This dance is often performed at weddings, celebratory events, and to welcome guests, symbolizing beauty and prosperity.

In Sulawesi, traditional dances serve as vibrant expressions of cultural heritage, offering unique insights into local traditions and values. One such example is the Poco-poco, originating from North Sulawesi, which has transcended borders to become popular, notably in Malaysia. However, controversy erupted in early April 2011 when Malaysian Islamic clerics banned the Poco-Poco dance for Muslims, citing perceived Christian origins and concerns that its steps resembled the sign of the cross, despite this Poco-Poco remains a cherished part of social gatherings and community events in various regions. In Central Sulawesi, the Dero dance promotes community unity through its circular formations and synchronized steps, often accompanied by lively music and chants at local festivals. Meanwhile, in South Sulawesi, the graceful Pakarena dance captivates audiences with its intricate storytelling conveyed through elegant movements and traditional costumes, preserving Bugis cultural narratives. Additionally, the Paraga dance demonstrates impressive athleticism by blending acrobatic and martial arts-inspired movements, symbolizing cultural pride during festive occasions.

In the Maluku Islands, the cakalele dance, a warrior dance, is performed with shields and swords, reflecting the region&#x27;s martial traditions. In the northern Maluku, there is a dance called the Gala dance. Gala Dance is a traditional dance originating from the Sula Islands Regency, North Maluku. Gala dance is generally celebrated to welcome guests.In addition to welcoming guests, gala dances are also celebrated during the harvest season, traditional parties, and folk parties and are performed by men and women in pairs.

In Papua, the Sajojo dance is wi In addition to welcoming guests, Serving as both entertainment and a profound expression of Papuan cultural identity. Another notable dance is the War Dance (Tarian Perang), performed by tribes such as the Dani and Yali. This dance symbolizes bravery and valor, accompanied by rhythmic drumming and chanting, with dancers adorned in traditional attire embellished with feathers and shells, enhancing the visual and cultural impact of the performance.

===Drama and theatre===


The Wayang show, the traditional shadow puppet theatre of the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese cultures, is a rich and ancient art form that showcases several mythological legends such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and many more. These performances are deeply rooted in the cultural heritage of Indonesia and serve not only as entertainment but also as a means of conveying moral and philosophical lessons. The shadow puppets, known as &quot;wayang kulit,&quot; are typically crafted from sheets of leather, which are meticulously carved and painted to create intricate designs. These puppets are then ounted on bamboo sticks and manipulated behind a white screen with a light source behind it to cast shadows, creating the illusion of moving figures. Traditional puppet makers, known as &quot;dalang,&quot; possess exceptional skills to craft these unique and intricate shadow puppets.

Another significant form of wayang theatre is Wayang wong, which translates to &quot;human wayang.&quot; This form of Javanese theatre transforms the wayang stories into live dance drama performances featuring human actors. Wayang wong combines elaborate costumes, expressive gestures, and traditional music to bring to life the mythical tales and moral teachings inherent in the wayang tradition. The performers undergo rigorous training to master the precise movements and expressions required to convey the characters&#x27; emotions and the story&#x27;s nuances.

Wayang performances are accompanied by a gamelan orchestra, which provides a rich and dynamic musical backdrop. The music, along with the rhythmic narration by the dalang, enhances the overall atmosphere and emotional impact of the story. The dalang, who is both a puppeteer and a storyteller, plays a crucial role in the performance. They not only manipulate the puppets but also provide voices for all the characters, deliver dialogue, and add sound effects, demonstrating remarkable dexterity and vocal versatility.

UNESCO designated &quot;Wayang&quot; the flat leather shadow puppet (&quot;wayang kulit&quot;) and the three-dimensional wooden puppet (&quot;wayang golek&quot; or &quot;wayang klitik&quot;) theatre, as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 7 November 2003. In return for the acknowledgement, UNESCO required Indonesians to preserve the tradition.

Another form of local drama is Javanese Ludruk, originating in East Java, blends comedy, drama, and audience interaction with improvised dialogue and local humor, making it a favorite among locals for its lively performances. Ketoprak, another traditional Javanese theater form, integrates drama, music, dance, and comedy, often weaving Javanese folklore and moral teachings into its narratives, commonly staged in village squares or traditional markets. Sundanese Sandiwara, from West Java portrays historical or mythological tales through music, dance, and drama, offering insights into Sundanese culture. Betawi Lenong, from Jakarta, features humorous storytelling in the local dialect, often with satire and social commentary reflecting Betawi cultural values.

Ondel-ondel, a Betawi folk performance, showcases large puppet figures paraded during festivals, symbolizing Jakarta&#x27;s Betawi community spirit and cultural heritage. These dramas are known for their humor and audience engagement, bringing communities together in celebration.

Randai is a folk theatre tradition of the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra, usually performed for traditional ceremonies and festivals. It incorporates music, singing, dance, drama and the “silek” or pencak silat martial art, with performances often based on semi-historical Minangkabau legends and love story.

Bangsawan, found in Riau and other Malay-speaking regions, combines elements of drama, music, and dance. It often features romantic or historical narratives, showcasing the region&#x27;s cultural heritage and its connections to wider Malay cultural traditions.

Various Balinese dance drama also can be included within the traditional form of Indonesian drama.

Modern performing art also developed in Indonesia with its distinct style of drama. Notable theatre, dance, and drama troupe such as Teater Koma are gaining popularity in Indonesia as their drama often portray social and political satires of Indonesian society.

===Martial arts===
The art of Pencak Silat was created and firstly developed in the islands of Java and Sumatra. It is an art for survival and practised throughout the Indonesian archipelago. Centuries of tribal wars in Indonesian history had shaped silat as it was used by the ancient warriors of Indonesia. Silat was used to determine the rank and position of warriors in old Indonesian kingdoms.

Contacts with Indians and Chinese has further enriched silat. Silat reached areas beyond Indonesia mainly through the diaspora of Indonesian people. People from various regions like Aceh, Minangkabau, Riau, Bugis, Makassar, Java, Banjar, etc. moved into and settled in Malay Peninsula and other islands. They brought silat and passed it down to their descendants. The Indonesian of half-Dutch descent are also credited as the first to have brought the art into Europe.

Pencak silat was used by Indonesian independence fighters during their struggle against the Dutch colonial rule. Unfortunately, after Indonesia achieving their independence, pencak silat became less popular among Indonesian youth compare to foreign martial arts like Karate and Taekwondo. This probably because silat was not taught openly and only passed down among blood relatives, the other reason is the lack of media portrayal of the art.

Efforts have been made to introduce and reintroduce the beauty of silat to Indonesian youth and the world. Exhibitions and promotions by individuals as well as state-sponsored groups helped the growing of silat&#x27;s popularity, particularly in Europe and United States. Indonesian 2009 Silat movie Merantau is one of Indonesian efforts to introduce silat to the international scene.

Pencak Silat was recognized as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) on 12 December 2019.

Another martial art from Indonesia is Tarung Derajat. It is a modern combat system created by Haji Ahmad Drajat based on his experience as a street fighter. Tarung Drajat has been acknowledged as a national sport by KONI in 1998 and is now used by Indonesian Army as part of their basic training.

In Eastern Indonesia, there is a type of martial art hitting with a whip or stick. Caci is a form of fighting with a whip or stick. It appears to be indigenous to Flores in East Nusa Tenggara, but it is also practised in Bali and Lombok.

==Traditional visual arts==

===Painting===


One of the oldest cave paintings in the world dating back more than 44,000 years old (art of the Upper Paleolithic), was found in caves in the district of Maros (Sulawesi, Indonesia). The oldest types of cave painting are hand stencils and simple geometric shapes.

In 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the then-oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the Indonesian island of Borneo. In December 2019, however, figurative cave paintings depicting pig hunting in the Maros-Pangkep karst in Sulawesi were estimated to be even older, at at least 43,900 years old. The finding was noted to be &quot;the oldest pictorial record of storytelling and the earliest figurative artwork in the world&quot;.
Indonesian painting before the 19th century is mostly restricted to the decorative arts, considered to be a religious and spiritual activity, comparable to the pre-1400 European art. Artists&#x27; names are anonymous since the individual human creator was seen as far less important than their creation to honour the deities or spirits. Some examples are the Kenyah decorative art, based on endemic natural motifs such as ferns and hornbills, found decorating the walls of Kenyah longhouses. Another notable traditional art is the geometric Toraja wood carvings. Balinese paintings are initially the narrative images to depict scenes of Balinese legends and religious scripts. The classical Balinese paintings are often decorating the lontar manuscripts and also the ceilings of temples pavilion.

Under the influence of the Dutch colonial power, a trend toward Western-style painting emerged in the 19th century. In the Netherlands, the term &quot;Indonesian Painting&quot; is applied to the paintings produced by Dutch or other foreign artists who lived and worked in the former Netherlands-Indies. The most famous indigenous 19th-century Indonesian painter is Raden Saleh (1807–1877), the first indigenous artist to study in Europe. His art is heavily influenced by Romanticism. In the 1920s Walter Spies settled in Bali, he is often credited with attracting the attention of Western cultural figures to Balinese culture and art. His works have somehow influenced Balinese artists and painters. Today Bali has one of the most vivid and richest painting traditions in Indonesia.

The 1920s to 1940s were a time of growing nationalism in Indonesia. The previous period of the romanticism movement was not seen as a purely Indonesian movement and did not develop. Painters began to see the natural world for inspiration. Some examples of Indonesian painter during this period are the Balinese Ida Bagus Made and the realist Basuki Abdullah. The Indonesian Painters Association (&quot;Persatuan Ahli-Ahli Gambar Indonesia&quot; or PERSAGI, 1938–1942) was formed during this period. PERSAGI established a contemporary art philosophy that saw artworks as reflections of the artist&#x27;s individual or personal view as well as an expression of national cultural thoughts.

===Wood carvings===

The art of wood carving is quite well-developed in Indonesia. Other than tribal art woodcarvings of Asmat, Batak, Dayak, Nias, and Toraja area is well known for its refined wood carving culture; they are Jepara in Central Java and Bali. Mas village near Ubud in Bali is renowned for its wood carving art. Balinese woodcarving today has a sustained tourist market in Bali.

In South Papua, Asmat art consists of elaborate stylized wood carvings such as the bisj pole and is designed to honour ancestors. Many Asmat artefacts have been collected by the world&#x27;s museums, among the most notable of which are those found in the Michael C. Rockefeller Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam. Bisj poles are carved by Asmat religious carvers (wow-ipits) after a member of their tribe or community had been killed and headhunted by an enemy tribe. Carved out of a single piece of a wild mangrove tree, Bisj poles can reach heights of up to 25 feet (7.62 m). Their carvings depict human figures standing on top of each other, as well as animal figures, phallic symbols, and carvings in the shape of a canoe prow. The Asmat participated in headhunting raids and cannibalism as rituals, many rituals involved the Bisj poles, including dancing, masquerading, singing and headhunting—all performed by men.
In North Sumatra, the people of Nias placed great value on wooden figures or &quot;adu&quot;. The sole purpose of the Nias figures was to fulfil ritual needs, whether it is to ensure wealth or to perform specific beneficial rite. Niassan figures vary in size, from as small as 20 centimetres (7.9 in) in height to more than 2 metres (6.6 ft) tall. When an elderly person died, the family would make a wooden statue known as adu zatua. The statue was unveiled on the fourth day after the death of the person. The shape of the wooden statue reflects the status of the person who used them: the more powerful the owner, the more impressive the statue will be made. Nias people believed that the deceased person&#x27;s spirits reside in the statue, so all events that occurred in the family were shared with the ancestor statues through prayers. Ancestor statues were placed in the main room of the house, sometimes more than a hundred. A missionary work in 1930 had recorded the removal of &#x27;over 2000 &quot;idols&quot; from a house of new northern convert.&#x27; Some missionaries even recorded houses collapsing under the weight of these ancestor figures. Small adu zatua were bound together horizontally using a rattan and pegs.

Many ancestor figures were destroyed in 1916 by Christian missionary movements which saw them as an old blasphemous religious symbol. Some were sold to collectors and can be found in museum or private collections around the world.

In Sulawesi, Torajans carve wood, calling it Pa&#x27;ssura (or &quot;the writing&quot;). One of the Toraja wood carvings is Tau tau, Tau tau is a kind of human statue made of wood or bamboo. Torajans believe that the dead can take their possessions with them to the afterlife, the effigies are usually equipped with small possessions. Traditionally, the effigies were simply carved, only to show the gender of the deceased. However, they have become more and more elaborate, actually attempting to imitate the likeness of the deceased. Nowadays, Tau tau has a photographic likeness to the people they represent.

===Sculpture===

Indonesia has a long history of stone, bronze and Iron Ages arts. Indonesia has a rich history of Hindu–Buddhist sculpture and architecture that has been shaped by a complex fusion of local, indigenous culture combined with foreign customs. Some Indonesian artifacts made from gold and bronze dating back to the 10th century are exhibited in the US. The megalithic sculptures can be found in numerous archaeological sites in Sumatra, Java to Sulawesi. The native Indonesians tribes have their own distinct tribal sculpture styles, usually created to depict ancestors, deities and animals. The stone sculpture artform particularly flourished in 8th-to-10th-century Java and Bali, which demonstrate the influences of Hindu-Buddhist culture, both as stand-alone works of art and also incorporated into temples. The most notable sculpture of the classical Hindu-Buddhist era of Indonesia are the hundreds of meters of relief and hundreds of stone buddhas at the temple of Borobudur in central Java. Approximately two miles of exquisite relief sculpture tell the story of the life of Buddha and illustrate his teachings. The temple was originally home to 504 statues of the seated Buddha.

The examples of notable Indonesian Hindu-Buddhist sculptures are; the statues of Hindu deities; Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Durga, Ganesha and Agastya enthroned in rooms of Prambanan temples, the Vishnu mounting Garuda statue of king Airlangga, the exquisite statue of Eastern Javanese Prajnaparamita and 3.7 meters tall Dvarapala dated from Singhasari period, and also the grand statue of Bhairava Adityawarman discovered in Sumatra. Today, the Hindu-Buddhist style stone sculptures are reproduced in villages in Muntilan near Borobudur also in Trowulan the former capital site of Majapahit in East Java, and Bali, and sold as a garden or pool ornament statues for homes, offices and hotels.

The walls of &quot;candi&quot; also often displayed bas-reliefs, either serve as decorative elements as well as to convey religious symbolic meanings; through describing narrative bas-reliefs. The most exquisite of the temple bas-reliefs can be found in Hindu and Buddhist temples. The first four terraces of Borobudur walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world. The Buddhist scriptures describes as bas-reliefs in Borobudur such as &quot;Karmavibhangga&quot; (the law of karma), &quot;Lalitavistara&quot; (the birth of Buddha), &quot;Jataka&quot;, &quot;Avadana&quot; and &quot;Gandavyuha&quot;. While in Prambanan the Hindu scriptures is describes in its bas-relief panels; the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; (popularly known as &quot;Krishnayana&quot;).

The bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted a temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also native vernacular architecture. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as asuras, gods, boddhisattvas, kinnaras, gandharvas and apsaras. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as a reference for historians to research certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also the mode of transportation of 8th-century Maritime Southeast Asia. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is Borobudur Ship.

=== Digital Preservation of Traditional Indonesian Arts ===
Digital preservation has emerged as a pivotal strategy for safeguarding Indonesia’s diverse and rich traditional arts. By integrating modern technology and participatory media practices, art forms such as gamelan music, Balinese dance, and wayang kulit are being preserved for future generations. Through digital archives, animation, and interactive platforms, these traditions are transcending geographical and temporal barriers, ensuring global reach and continued cultural relevance.

* Social Media Integration: Gamelan communities have utilized social media platforms like YouTube and Instagram to connect with global audiences, share performances, and foster cross-cultural appreciation. Community-led projects often host virtual workshops and live-stream performances, making traditional music accessible to younger and international audiences.
* Museum-Led Digital Archives: Institutions such as the Museum Mpu Tantular in East Java employ participatory media to document and preserve traditional performances. These efforts include creating digital exhibits and interactive platforms that educate and engage the public, particularly younger generations.
* Animated Cultural Storytelling: The animation series Si AA incorporates traditional gamelan music and folklore, presenting Indonesia’s cultural heritage through a modern medium that resonates with international audiences. By blending traditional elements with contemporary storytelling, the series bridges cultural preservation and innovation.

==Architecture==


For centuries, Indonesian vernacular architecture has shaped settlements in Indonesia which commonly took the form of timber structures built on stilts dominated by a large roof. The most dominant foreign influences on Indonesian architecture were Indian, although European influences have been particularly strong since the 19th century and modern architecture in Indonesia is international in scope.
As in much of Southeast Asia, traditional vernacular architecture in Indonesia is built on stilts, with the significant exceptions of Java and Bali. Notable stilt houses are those of the Dayak people in Borneo, the Rumah Gadang of the Minangkabau people in western Sumatra, the Rumah Bolon of the Batak people in northern Sumatra, and the &quot;Tongkonan&quot; of the Toraja people in Sulawesi. Oversized saddle roofs with large eaves, such as the homes of the Batak and the &quot;tongkonan&quot; of Toraja, are often bigger than the house they shelter. The fronts of Torajan houses are frequently decorated with buffalo horns, stacked one above another, as an indication of status. The outside walls also frequently feature decorative reliefs.

Candi is an Indonesian term to refer to ancient temples. Before the rise of Islam, between the 5th to 15th-century Dharmic faiths (Hinduism and Buddhism) were the majority in the Indonesian archipelago, especially in Java and Sumatra. As a result of numerous Hindu temples, locally known as candi, constructed and dominated the landscape of Java. According to local beliefs, Java valley had thousands of Hindu temples that co-existed with Buddhist temples, most of which were buried in the massive eruption of Mount Merapi in 1006 AD.
Between 1100 and 1500 additional Hindu temples were built, but abandoned by Hindus and Buddhists as Islam spread in Java circa the 15th to 16th century. The 8th-century Borobudur temple near Yogyakarta is the largest Buddhist temple in the world and is notable for incorporating about 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues into its structure, telling the story of the life of the Buddha. As the visitor ascends through the eight levels of the temple, the story unfolds, the final three levels simply containing stupas and statues of the Buddha. The building is said to incorporate a map of the Buddhist cosmos and is a masterful fusion of didactic narrative relief, spiritual symbolism, monumental design and the serene meditative environs. The whole monument itself resembles a giant stupa, but seen from above it forms a mandala.

The nearby 9th-century temple complex at Prambanan contains some of the best-preserved examples of Hindu temple architecture in Java. The temple complex comprises eight main shrines, surrounded by 224 smaller shrines. The majority of Hindu temples in Java were dedicated to Shiva, who Javanese Hindus considered as the God who commands the energy to destroy, recombine and recreate the cycle of life. Small temples were often dedicated to Shiva and his family (wife Durga, son Ganesha). Larger temple complexes include temples for Vishnu and Brahma, but the most majestic, sophisticated and central temple was dedicated to Shiva.

==Crafts==

Indonesia is considered as home of world handicraft. Every ethnic group has its own uniqueness, style, and philosophy of crafting. Most of them are made from wood, bone, fabric, stone, and paper. These natural materials were crafted using hands into
profitable and aesthetic items. Handicraft manufacturing serves not only as an important economic sector, but also a tradition and has a social function as well. The handicraft industry employs thousands of people in towns and villages across the country. About half a billion dollar worth of handicraft is exported every year, and many more is consumed domestically.

=== Weaving Techniques and Textiles ===
Among the most celebrated crafts in Indonesia are its weaving traditions, each carrying cultural and economic significance:

* Songket: Found prominently in West Sumatra and South Sumatra, songket is a brocade cloth woven with intricate gold or silver threads. Traditionally used in ceremonial attire, it has also gained prominence in modern fashion collections.
* Ikat: Villages in the Lesser Sunda Islands are known for ikat fabrics, created through a meticulous dye-resist process. These textiles carry deep cultural meaning and are integral to both daily life and rituals. 
* Ulos: Traditional to the Batak people of North Sumatra, ulos textiles symbolize familial bonds and blessings. They remain central to ceremonial events and have increasingly inspired contemporary design.

=== Basketry and Carving ===
Kalimantan is renowned for its basketry and weaving, utilizing rattan and other natural fibers. In Papua, the Asmat people produce intricate wood carvings that are highly valued for their cultural and artistic significance.

=== Batik ===
Batik, perhaps Indonesia’s most iconic textile, is celebrated for its vibrant designs and symbolic patterns. Today, batik patterns have diversified to cater to modern tastes while maintaining their cultural roots. Cities like Cirebon, Pekalongan, and Rembang remain centers of batik production.

=== Woodworking and Furniture ===

* Jepara Wood Carving: Known for its detailed craftsmanship, Jepara produces intricately carved wooden furniture that is exported worldwide.
* Rattan Furniture: Cirebon specializes in rattan furniture, blending traditional techniques with modern designs to meet international demand.
* Phinisi Boats: The art of Phinisi boatbuilding in South Sulawesi was inscribed in 2017 on UNESCO&#x27;s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, showcasing Indonesia’s maritime craftsmanship.

=== Recognition and UNESCO Listings ===
Indonesia’s crafts have earned international recognition for their cultural value:

* In 2005, UNESCO recognized the Kris (ceremonial dagger) as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
* In 2012, the Noken, a multifunctional woven bag from Papua, was listed as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia by UNESCO. Women carrying noken remain a common sight in Wamena.

Indonesia&#x27;s best-known national costumes are Batik and kebaya, although initially these costumes originated mainly from Javanese and Balinese culture, which are most prominent in Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese cultures. Because Java has become the political centre and population of Indonesia, the island&#x27;s folk costume has been raised to national status. As a plural country, Indonesia has 38 provinces, each of which has representatives of traditional clothing from each province with unique and different designs. National costumes are worn at official occasions and traditional ceremonies. each province in Indonesia – more complete each group in Indonesia, has its own traditional costumes. The costumes of this area are in Indonesian called &quot;Pakaian tradisional&quot; or &quot;Pakaian adat&quot;, and are taken from traditional Indonesian textile traditions and crafts.

===National costumes===
====Batik====

Batik is a cloth that is traditionally made using a manual wax-resist dyeing technique to form intricate patterns. Traditionally batik cloth is a large piece of intricately decorated cloth used by Javanese women as &quot;kemben&quot; or torso wrap. Batik cloth was wrapped around the hips with multiple folds in front called &quot;wiron&quot;, while the upper torso wear &quot;kebaya&quot; fitted dress. Traditionally for men, the edge of batik cloth also can be sewn together to make a tubular cloth as sarong, or wrapped around hips as &quot;kain&quot; in a fashion similar to women&#x27;s. Later for men, the batik cloth also is sewn and made into contemporary batik men&#x27;s shirt. Today, &quot;Batik&quot; shirts, which are commonly worn by men in Indonesia (especially in Java), are usually worn during formal occasions; such as attending weddings, traditional ceremonies, formal meetings, communal gatherings, etc. &quot;Batik&quot; is recognized as one of the important identity of Indonesian culture. UNESCO designated Indonesian batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 2 October 2009.

====Kebaya====
The &quot;kebaya&quot; is the national costume of women from Indonesia, although it is more accurately endemic to the Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese peoples. It is sometimes made from sheer material such as silk, thin cotton or semi-transparent nylon or polyester, adorned with brocade or floral pattern embroidery. Kebaya usually worn with a sarong or batik &quot;kain panjang&quot;, or other traditional woven garment such as &quot;ikat&quot;, &quot;songket&quot; with a colorful motif. &quot;Kebaya&quot; is usually worn during official national events by Indonesian first lady, wives of Indonesian diplomats, and Indonesian ladies. It also worn by Indonesian ladies attending traditional ceremonies and weddings. During Balinese traditional ceremonies, Balinese women wore colorful Balinese style &quot;kebaya&quot; with &quot;songket&quot; Bali.

====Peci====
The &quot;Peci&quot;, also known as &quot;songkok&quot; or &quot;kopiah&quot;, is a cap traditionally worn by male Muslims in the Indonesian archipelago. It is quite similar to the Turkish-Egyptian &quot;fez&quot;. In Indonesia, the black velvet peci has become the national headdress with nationalist connotations made popular by Sukarno. A number of Indonesian nationalist movement activists in the early 20th century, wore a peci to convey their nationalistic sentiments and to demonstrate their Indonesian identity. Indonesian male presidents always wear a &quot;peci&quot; as part of their official presidential attire. Since then, the black velvet &quot;peci&quot; is approved to be the national head-dress for Indonesian men. It is worn all over Indonesia, especially by government officials and men (usually Muslim men) throughout the country. The &quot;peci&quot; is usually worn with a &quot;batik&quot; shirt or western-style suits by men in Indonesia for those attending formal occasions.

==Foods==

The cuisine of indonesia has been influenced by Chinese culture and Indian culture, as well as by Western culture. However, in return, Indonesian cuisine has also contributed to the cuisines of neighbouring countries, notably Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei, where Padang or Minangkabau cuisine from West Sumatra is very popular. Also, Satay (&quot;Sate&quot; in Indonesian), which originated from Java, Madura, and Sumatra, has gained popularity as a street vendor food from Singapore to Thailand. In the 15th century, both the Portuguese and Arab traders arrived in Indonesia with the intention of trading for pepper and other spices. During the colonial era, immigrants from many countries arrived in Indonesia and brought different cultures as well as cuisines.

Most native Indonesians eat rice as the main dish, with a wide range of vegetables and meat as side dishes. However, in some parts of the country, such as Papua and Ambon, the majority of the people eat sago (a type of tapioca) and sweet potato.

Indonesian dishes are usually spicy, using a wide range of chilli peppers and spices. The most popular dishes include nasi goreng (fried rice), Satay, Nasi Padang (a dish of Minangkabau) and soy-based dishes, such as tahu and tempe. A unique characteristic of some Indonesian food is the application of spicy peanut sauce in their dishes, as a dressing for Gado-gado or Karedok (Indonesian style salad), or for seasoning grilled chicken satay. Another unique aspect of Indonesian cuisine is using &quot;terasi&quot; or &quot;belacan&quot;, a pungent shrimp paste in dishes of &quot;sambal oelek&quot; (hot pungent chilli sauce). The sprinkling of fried shallots also gives a uniquely crisp texture to some Indonesian dishes.

Chinese and Indian cultures have influenced the serving of food and the types of spices used. It is very common to find Chinese food in Indonesia such as dimsum and noodles, and Indian cuisine such as Tandoori chicken. In addition, Western culture has significantly contributed to the extensive range of dishes. However, the dishes have been transformed to suit Indonesian tastes. For example, steaks are usually served with rice. Popular fast foods such as Kentucky Fried Chicken are served with rice instead of bread and sambal (spicy sauce) instead of ketchup. Some Indonesian foods have been adopted by the Dutch, like Indonesian rice table or &#x27;rijsttafel&#x27;.

In 2023/2024, TasteAtlas rated Indonesian cuisine as the sixth best cuisine in the world. Indonesian cuisine is placed behind Italian, Japanese, Greek, Portuguese, and Chinese cuisines, making Indonesian the best-rated cuisine in Southeast Asia.

==Mythology and folklores==
The mythology of Indonesia is very diverse, the Indonesian people consisting of hundreds of ethnic groups, each with their own myths and legends. The stories within this system of lore often incorporate supernatural entities and magical creatures which form parts of Indonesian mythology. Others relate to creation myths and place naming legends that are often intertwined with historical figures and events. Ancient rituals for healing and traditional medicine as well as complex philosophies regarding health and disease can also be found.

These native mythologies are relatively free from foreign influences, such as Torajans, Nias, Bataks, Dayaks and Papuans. By contrast, Javanese, Balinese, and to some degree Sundanese were influenced by Hindu-Buddhist Indian mythology as early as the 1st century CE. Hindu gods, legends and epics such as &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot; were adopted and adapted into a uniquely local form.

Hindu-Buddhist mythical beings have a role in Javanese and Balinese mythology, including Hindu gods and heroes, devatas, asuras, apsaras (known as hapsari or bidadari), kinnaras, etc., while native gods of nature such as Semar, Dewi Sri, and Nyai Loro Kidul are either given identified as their Hindu counterpart or incorporated into a Java-Bali Hindu pantheon unknown in India. For example, native rice goddess Dewi Sri is identified with Lakshmi the shakti of Vishnu, and Semar and his sons the Punakawans are incorporated into the epic of Mahabharata in Javanese wayang kulit, as the clown servants of the Pandawas. Several names refer to gods, such as &quot;Dewa&quot; (devas), &quot;Dewi&quot; (devi), &quot;dewata&quot; (devatas), and in native traditions usually referred to as &quot;Batara&quot; (male god) and &quot;Batari&quot; (female goddess).

After the coming of Islam to the Indonesian archipelago, Islamic mythology especially those dealing with spiritual beings, such as devils, demons, jinns and angels entered Indonesian mythology. In Sumatra, Malay, Aceh and Minangkabau mythology was almost entirely supplanted by Islamic mythology. However, belief in local spirits such as the forest guardian, the ghost of water or haunted places still exists, often associated with a jinn or the tormented soul of a deceased human.

==Literature==

Early Indonesian literature originates in Malay literature, and the influence of these roots was felt until well into the twentieth century. The phrase &quot;Indonesian literature&quot; refers to Indonesian as written in the nation of Indonesia, but also covers literature written in an earlier form of the language, i.e. the Malay language written in the Dutch East Indies. Pramoedya Ananta Toer was Indonesia&#x27;s most internationally celebrated author, having won the Magsaysay Award as well as being considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Other important figures include the late Chairil Anwar, a poet and member of the &quot;Generation 45&quot; group of authors who were active in the Indonesian independence movement. Tight information controls during Suharto&#x27;s presidency suppressed new writing, especially because of its ability to agitate for social reform.

In the book &quot;Max Havelaar&quot;, Dutch author Multatuli criticised the Dutch treatment of the Indonesians, which gained him international attention.

Modern Indonesian authors include Seno Gumira Adjidarma, Andrea Hirata, Habiburrahman El Shirazy, Ayu Utami, Gus tf Sakai, Eka Kurniawan, Ratih Kumala, Dee, Oka Rusmini. Some of their works have translated to other languages.

&quot;Poetry&quot; has a long tradition in Indonesia, particularly among ethnically Malay populations, of extemporary, interactive, oral composition of poetry. These poems are referred to as &quot;pantun&quot;. Contemporary Indonesian poets include among others, Sutardji Calzoum Bachri, Rendra, Taufiq Ismail, Afrizal Malna, Binhad Nurrohmat, Joko Pinurbo, Nyoman Tusthi Eddy, and Sapardi Djoko Damono. In written poetry and prose, a number of traditional forms dominate, mainly: syair (traditional narrative poetry), gurindam (brief aphorisms), hikayat (stories, fairy-tales, animal fables, chronicles), babad (histories or chronicles).

On 15 December 2020 the &quot;Pantun&quot; is recognized as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization).

==Recreation and sports==
Many traditional games are still preserved and popular in Indonesia, although western culture has influenced some parts of them. Among three hundred officially recognised Indonesian cultures, there are many kinds of traditional games: cockfighting in Bali, annual bull races in Madura, horse racing in Sumbawa and stone jumping in Nias. Stone jumping involves leaping over a stone wall about up to 1.5 m high and was originally used to train warriors. Pencak Silat is another popular form of sport, which was influenced by Asian culture as a whole. Another form of national sport is &quot;sepak takraw&quot;. The rules are similar to volleyball: to keep the rattan ball in the air with the players&#x27; feet.

Popular modern sports in Indonesia played at the international level include football (soccer), badminton and basketball. Badminton is one of Indonesia&#x27;s most successful sports. Indonesian badminton athletes have played in Indonesia Open Badminton Championship, All England Open Badminton Championships, and many international events, including the Summer Olympics and won Olympic gold medals since badminton was made an Olympic sport in 1992. Rudy Hartono is a legendary Indonesian badminton player, who won All England titles seven times in a row (1968 through 1974). Indonesian teams have won the Thomas Cup (men&#x27;s world team championship) thirteen of the twenty-two times that it has been contested since they entered the series in 1957. In the internationally popular sport of football (soccer), Indonesian teams have been active in the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

Sporting events in Indonesia are organised by the National Sports Committee of Indonesia (KONI). The committee, along with the government of Indonesia, has set a National Sports Day every 9 September with &quot;Sports for All&quot; as the motto. Indonesia has hosted the Southeast Asian Games four times, in 1979, 1987, 1997 and 2011, and won the overall champion title in each of these years. As of 2011, Indonesia has won champion titles 10 times overall out of 18 SEA Games it has attended since debuted in 1977. The country also hosted the 1993 Asian Basketball Championship. Besides that, it has also hosted the Asian Games twice, the 1962 Asian Games and the 2018 Asian Games.

==Popular media==

===Cinema===

The largest chain of cinemas in Indonesia is 21 Cineplex, which has cinemas spread throughout twenty-four cities on the major islands of Indonesia. Many smaller independent cinemas also exist.

In the 1980s, the film industry in Indonesia was at its peak, and dominated the cinemas in Indonesia with movies that have retained a high reputation, such as &quot;Catatan Si Boy&quot; and &quot;Blok M&quot; and actors like Onky Alexander, Meriam Bellina, Nike Ardilla and Paramitha Rusady. The film &quot;Tjoet Nja&#x27; Dhien&quot; (1988) winning 9 Citra Awards at the 1988 Indonesian Film Festival. It was also the first Indonesian movie chosen for screening at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was awarded Best International Film in 1989. However, the film industry failed to continue its successes in the 1990s, when the number of movies produced decreased significantly, from 115 movies in 1990 to just 37 in 1993. As a result, most movies produced in the 1990s contained adult themes. The industry started to recover in the late 1990s, with the rise of independent directors and many new movies produced, such as Garin Nugroho&#x27;s &quot;Cinta dalam Sepotong Roti&quot;, Riri Riza and Mira Lesmana&#x27;s &quot;Petualangan Sherina&quot; and &quot;Arisan!&quot; by Nia Dinata. Another form of recovery is the re-establishment of the Indonesian Film Festival (FFI), inactive for twelve years, and the creation of the Jakarta International Film Festival. &quot;Daun di Atas Bantal&quot; (1998) received Asia Pacific Film Festival in Taipei.

===Television===
===Radio===
The public radio network Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI) was founded in 1945. It consists of a network of regional stations located in all provinces of the archipelago. In most cities and large towns there are also many commercial stations. Since 2006, several digital radio stations have been based in Jakarta and Surabaya, using Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) and Hybrid HD-Radio.

==Religion and philosophy==

Islam is Indonesia&#x27;s main religion, with almost 88% of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census, making Indonesia the most populous Muslim-majority nation in the world. The remaining population is 9% Christian (of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant with the remainder mainly Catholic, and a large minority Charismatic), 2% Hindu, and 1% Buddhist.

The &quot;Pancasila&quot;, the statement of two principles that encapsulate the ideology of the Indonesian state, affirms that &quot;The state shall be based on the belief in the one and only God&quot;.

<text>The Middlesex Sevens was a Rugby Sevens tournament held annually at Twickenham stadium in London, England until 2011. It was first held in 1926, and started by Dr J.A. Russell-Cargill, a London-based Scot. The event was held at the end of the rugby union season in May every year for 75 years, but moved to August in 2001 due to lack of available stadium dates and players in May. The Middlesex Sevens tournament was last played in 2011, as the new Premiership Rugby 7s Series caused many of the top clubs that previously took part to pull out.

This tournament was a charitable event, officially called the Middlesex Charity Sevens, with the beneficiaries being Wooden Spoon and the RFU Injured Players Fund. Middlesex Charity Sevens raised over £10 million for charities.

==History==
Traditionally the Middlesex Sevens was an invitation tournament with entertainment derived from overseas and qualifying sides challenging rugby union&#x27;s top teams. In 2005 the tournament became a twelve team competition with only Rugby Premiership teams participating. In 2008 the tournament reverted to sixteen teams. The 2010 final was played between London Irish, who fielded three Armitage brothers, and ULR Samurai with a strong international contingent.
Brazil was amongst the teams invited to take part in the 2011 tournament. The final was played between Esher RFC and Samurai.

Two rugby league clubs have won the Middlesex Sevens: firstly Wigan, who brought a star-studded team including Offiah, Shaun Edwards, Andy Farrell, Tuigamala and a young Jason Robinson to Twickenham in 1996 as a tune-up before the union leg of their historic Clash of the Codes series against Bath. Wigan were joined on the honours list by Bradford Bulls, champions in 2002.

The Women&#x27;s Middlesex 7s was introduced in 2011, the final year of the tournament, and was won by Wooden Spoon Women.

<doc id="803217" wikidata="Q212143" url="?curid=803217" title="The Doctrine of Fascism">
<text>&quot;The Doctrine of Fascism&quot; () is an essay attributed to Benito Mussolini. In truth, the first part of the essay, entitled , was written by the Italian philosopher Giovanni Gentile, while only the second part is the work of Mussolini himself.

== Overview ==

The doctrine was written in 1927 by Mussolini, with the help of Giovanni Gentile. It was first published in 1932, in the 14th volume of the Italian Encyclopedia (&quot;Enciclopedia Italiana&quot;), as the first section of a lengthy entry on . The entire entry on fascism spans pages 847–884 of the &quot;Enciclopedia Italiana&quot;, and includes numerous photographs and graphic images. The entry starts on page 847 and ends on 851 with the credit line &quot;Benito Mussolini&quot;. All subsequent translations of &quot;The Doctrine of Fascism&quot; were derived from this work.

A key concept of the essay was that fascism was a rejection of previous models: &quot;Granted that the nineteenth century was the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy, this does not mean that the twentieth century must also be the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy. Political doctrines pass; nations remain. We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the &quot;right&quot;, a Fascist century. If the nineteenth century was the century of the individual (liberalism implies individualism) we are free to believe that this is the &quot;collective&quot; century, and therefore the century of the State.&quot;

In 1940, Mussolini ordered all remaining copies of the document, which had different editions and translations, to be destroyed &quot;because he changed his mind about certain points&quot;.

==Translations==
The first authorized translation into English was prepared by Jane Soames and published by Leonard and Virginia Woolf in 1933 (&quot;The Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism&quot;, London: Hogarth Press, 1933). Soames&#x27; translation was also published in &quot;The Living Age&quot;, November 1933, New York City, p. 241, as a chapter entitled * Authorized translation of Mussolini&#x27;s &quot;The Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism&quot; (1933).

<text>Otto Clarence Luening (June 15, 1900 – September 2, 1996) was a German-American composer and conductor, and flutist. He was an early pioneer of tape music and electronic music.

==Biography==
Luening was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to German parents, Eugene Luening, a conductor and composer, and Emma (nee Jacobs), an amateur singer. When he was 12, his family moved to Munich, where he studied music at the State Academy of Music. At age 17, he moved to Switzerland and attended the Municipal Conservatory of Music in Zürich and University of Zurich, where he studied with Ferruccio Busoni and Philipp Jarnach, and was also an actor and stage manager for James Joyce&#x27;s English Players Company. He returned to the United States in 1924, and appeared mainly as a conductor of operas, in Chicago and the Eastman School of Music.

His conducting premieres included Virgil Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Mother of Us All&quot;, Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s &quot;The Medium&quot;, and his own &quot;Evangeline&quot;. &quot;Evangeline,&quot; based on the poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, premiered at Columbia University in New York City in 1948.

Luening&#x27;s tape music, including &quot;A Poem in Cycles &amp; Bells&quot;, &quot;Gargoyles for Violin &amp; Synthesized Sound&quot;, and &quot;Sounds of New Music&quot; demonstrated the early potential of synthesizers and special editing techniques for electronic music. An October 28, 1952 concert with Vladimir Ussachevsky at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City introduced &quot;Fantasy in Space&quot;, flute recordings manipulated on magnetic tape, and led to an appearance on The Today Show with Dave Garroway.

<text>Gareth Lloyd Rees (born 30 June 1967) is a Canadian former international rugby union footballer who played at fly-half and full back positions. Rees played for several English club sides, including Wasps and Harlequins. He won 55 caps for Canada, captaining them on 23 occasions and scoring 487 test points. In October 2011, Rees received arguably his greatest honour with induction to the IRB Hall of Fame. He and fellow 2011 inductee Brian Lima of Samoa are the first members of the IRB Hall from nations outside of the traditional top tier of the sport.

==Rugby career==
Rees was born in Duncan, British Columbia, to Alan Rees who had emigrated to Canada from Wales, and was himself a former rugby union footballer having represented Cross Keys, Maesteg and London Welsh. Rees was educated at St. Michaels University School in Victoria and later at Harrow School in England. When studying at Harrow, he was selected to the Wasps starting XV in what was then the John Player Cup final in 1986.

He played club rugby with Castaways, Wasps, Mérignac, Newport, Oxford University, Harlequins, and the Barbarians. Whilst at Wasps he helped them win the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 1999, 13 years after his last appearance in the final, scoring two conversions and four penalties as they defeated Newcastle Falcons.

Rees played in all of the first four Rugby World Cup tournaments, the 1987, 1991, 1995 and 1999. He retired after the 1999 finals becoming the only player to play at the first four Rugby World Cups.

In the 1995 World Cup Rees together with James Dalton and Rod Snow were sent off for fighting in a Canada vs South Africa match that came to be known as the Battle of Boet Erasmus. All three players received a 30-day suspension. Rees did not regret coming to the aid of his team mates, and said after the incident, &quot;We&#x27;re a very tight team. The guys love each other.&quot;

He was inducted in the British Columbia Rugby Hall of Fame.

In 2011 he was inducted in the World Rugby Hall of Fame as the first and only Canadian.
In 2014 he was inducted in the Canada Sports Hall of Fame as the first and only rugby player.

Rees donated one of his rugby boots to be bronzed and used as a trophy to be competed for annually by St. Michaels and Oak Bay High School.

<doc id="803221" wikidata="Q7762693" url="?curid=803221" title="The Screamers">
<text>The Screamers were an American electropunk group founded in 1975. They were among the first wave of the L.A. punk rock scene. The Los Angeles Times applied the label &quot;techno-punk&quot; to the band in 1978. In the documentary &quot;&quot; (2005), vocalist Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys cites the Screamers as a key influence on their group and as one of the great unrecorded groups in rock history.

The Screamers were noted for unusual instrumentation (a drummer and two keyboardists usually on ARP Odyssey synthesizer and Fender Rhodes electric piano). Additional musicians, including violinists and a female vocalist, were occasionally incorporated into their performances. The group featured a theatrical presentation that centered on manic lead vocalist, Tomata du Plenty. DuPlenty and Tommy Gear, a keyboard player and vocalist, were the band&#x27;s principal songwriters.

==History==

The Screamers&#x27; founders Tomata du Plenty (born David Xavier Harrigan) and Tommy Gear first collaborated in Seattle in 1975, where they formed the Tupperwares. 
The original lineup of the Tupperwares included Tommy Gear (at the time, using the name &quot;Melba Toast&quot;), Tomata du Plenty, and Rio de Janeiro on vocals, backed by Pam Lillig and Ben witz (later of Girls), as well as Bill Rieflin (later of the Blackouts and Ministry) and a teenage Eldon Hoke (later known as &quot;El Duce&quot; of the Mentors).

In late 1976, after legal threats from Tupperware trademark owners, the band&#x27;s name was changed to the Screamers. Tomata, Tommy, and Rio migrated to Los Angeles, leaving the other band members behind. Shortly after arriving in Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro left the band due to creative differences and they added David Brown and drummer K. K. Barrett. Brown soon left to found the seminal punk label Dangerhouse Records; he was replaced by Paul Roessler.

The Screamers created a visual presence in the press before they ever played live. Studio photos of the band began to appear in magazines even before a full band had been assembled. Artist Gary Panter&#x27;s logo for the band, a stylized cartoon of a screaming head with spiked hair, became one of the most recognizable images to emerge from punk rock.

From 1977 through 1979, the Screamers became a sensation in Los Angeles rock clubs, selling out multiple-night engagements at the Whisky a Go Go. They were the first band without a recording contract to headline the prestigious Roxy on Sunset Boulevard. They also did several short tours during this period, playing in New York, at CBGB and Hurrah, in &#x27;78 and &#x27;79.

Describing a July 1979 performance, music critic Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; focused on &quot;Tomata&#x27;s extraordinary power on stage.&quot; According to Hilburn, &quot;Tomata&#x27;s hair was greased to stand straight up, giving him the look of a man who had just stuck his finger into an electric socket. His performance reflected the nervous, relentless anxiety of someone whose troubles are even deeper... by the end of the 40-minute set, du Plenty has gone through the same disintegration of the human will that we associate with such books as &quot;1984.&quot; Eventually, the tuxedo jacket, shirt and tie are ripped off, leaving him symbolically naked in his attempt to maintain some dignity and individuality. As if suddenly put in another man&#x27;s body, he asks in horror: &quot;Who am I?&quot; 

The Screamers never released a single official recording of any kind, although several bootleg recordings have since appeared, composed of rehearsals or live tapes. At one point, the group determined they would release their debut album only in video form (a highly unusual approach before MTV existed or VCRs were common), and they devoted time and resources to constructing a small movie studio. Despite some fitful efforts in the early 1980s, the band had effectively dissolved before their video plans were realized. Roessler joined L.A.&#x27;s other &quot;synthpunk&quot; band, Nervous Gender. The other band members pursued non-musical careers, though K.K. Barrett reunited with Roessler to perform several Screamers songs live in late 2000, in tribute to Tomata du Plenty, who had recently died in San Francisco in August 2000.

==Recordings==
Their most well known song, &quot;122 Hours of Fear&quot; was inspired by the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. Their other notable song is &quot;Vertigo&quot;, a song about insanity.

In 2004, Target Video released a DVD of a Screamers concert from 1978, filmed at the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco and appended several early Screamers music videos shot at the Target studio around the same time. Unauthorized live recordings and demo tapes of the Screamers circulate as bootlegs.

Their song &quot;Peer Pressure&quot; is featured on the 2010 compilation &quot;Black Hole: Jon Savage Presents/California Punk 1977–1980&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Tomata du Plenty starred in the 1986 punk rock musical &quot;&quot;. The October 2008 release of &quot;Population: 1&quot; on DVD features a bonus disc of rare Screamers concert footage.

A poster advertising a Screamers show is featured in the hallway (along with many other band&#x27;s posters) of the house in the film &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot;.

The Screamers were a large influence on hardcore bands like Dead Kennedys and the Germs, along with other synthpunk groups like the Units and Mindless Self Indulgence.

<text>Pedro Miguel de Santana Lopes (; born 29 June 1956) is a Portuguese lawyer and politician, who is the current mayor of Figueira da Foz. He most notably served as prime minister of Portugal from 2004 to 2005.

==Background and early life==

Pedro Santana Lopes was born in Campo Grande, Lisbon, to Aníbal Luís Lopes (b. Lisbon, São Sebastião da Pedreira, 17 February 1933), a company administrator whose maternal grandfather&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a relative of João Brandão, and wife (m. Lisbon, São Sebastião da Pedreira, 27 February 1954) Maria Ivone Risques Pereira de Santana (Lisbon, São Sebastião da Pedreira, 3 May 1931 – Lisbon, 23 March 1999), a half-great-great-great-niece of the 2nd Baron of Brissos.

He graduated as a Licentiate in law from the Faculty of Law of the University of Lisbon, where he was the leader of the Student Union, becoming a lawyer.

==Political career==

He joined the Social Democratic Party (PSD) in 1976. There he started his career as a deputy to the Assembly of the Republic.

In 1979, he became a legal advisor to Prime Minister Francisco Sá Carneiro, and has identified himself as a follower of his for all his political life.

In 1986, he became the assistant state secretary to Prime Minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva, an office he left the next year to lead to PSD list to the European Parliament, where he remained for two years of his five-year-term.

In 1990, Cavaco Silva appointed him to the government post of Secretary of State for Culture. He left the office in 1994, in disagreement with Cavaco, and returned to law practice. In the 1997 local elections, he ran successfully to become mayor of Figueira da Foz. He decided not to seek a second term there, and instead ran for mayor of Lisbon in the 2001 local elections, defeating the incumbent João Soares and becoming one of the biggest surprises of the electoral night.

==Prime minister==

When José Manuel Durão Barroso resigned in July 2004 to take up the presidency of the European Commission, Santana Lopes became the president of PSD. At the time, his party had a coalition government with the CDS - People&#x27;s Party, which held a parliamentary majority, and therefore he was nominated prime minister of the XVI Constitutional Government. His term as mayor of Lisbon was automatically suspended, with his deputy Carmona Rodrigues taking over his duties.

The leadership of Santana Lopes was marked by a number of inherited economic and political problems. When his party took power, after the 2002 legislative elections, the country&#x27;s economy was in a poor state, with a rising government-spending deficit, partially because of policies focused on public expenditure by the previous governments (led by António Guterres of the Socialist Party) and the early 2000s recession. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, &quot;Portugal became the first country to breach the EU&#x27;s &#x27;excessive deficit&#x27; rule with a budget deficit of 4.4% of GDP in 2001, well above the 3% of GDP ceiling set by the EU&#x27;s Stability and Growth Pact.&quot; The situation inherited by Santana Lopes was a little better, as the previous government led by Barroso had been able to comply with European Union directives regarding the deficit by selling state assets.

Santana Lopes himself failed to gain a reputation as a competent prime minister. His unusual rise to power, as Barroso&#x27;s successor rather than by election, contributed to these difficulties, despite his nomination being entirely constitutional.

The short career of Santana Lopes as prime minister began with some members of government being shuffled between departments on the same afternoon as the government was being inaugurated. His minister of Defence Paulo Portas looked surprised during the ceremony when he was announced as the &quot;Minister for National Defence and Sea Affairs&quot;. Portas&#x27; look of surprise when the name of his office was announced was broadcast live on television.

Santana Lopes&#x27; period in office was also marked by chaos in the allocation of teachers to schools (more than a month after classes officially started, and resulting from alleged incompetence of the IT provider (designated during the previous Government); the problem was swiftly solved by another small provider), and by claims of pressure exerted on the press, including arranging for the replacement of the information director of the public television channel RTP, and pressing private television channel TVI to tone down the criticism of him by a political commentator, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, a former leader of his own party, who consequently left the channel.

Santana Lopes&#x27; demise as head of government was sealed on 30 November 2004 when President Jorge Sampaio, a member of the opposing party, announced that he was calling an early Parliament election for February 2005, from which a new government would be formed, after Henrique Chaves, a Santana loyalist, resigned after four days as Minister for Sport, claiming that he lacked &quot;loyalty and truth&quot;.

Santana Lopes formally tendered his resignation on 11 December, and his government assumed just a caretaker role until the election. He went on to be defeated in the 2005 legislative elections which was won by the Socialist Party led by José Sócrates. Santana resigned as party leader two days later, although he still briefly assumed the informal position of leader of the opposition, until the election of Luís Marques Mendes as new party leader.

==Subsequent career and activities==

Despite his defeat in the 2005 legislative elections, Santana Lopes retained his seat at the Assembly of the Republic. He would also resume his functions as mayor of Lisbon, which had been suspended since he took office as prime minister. However, he decided not to seek another term on the 2005 local elections, being succeeded by his deputy, Carmona Rodrigues, who had also replaced him during his premiership. In October 2007, after the election of Luís Filipe Menezes as leader of the Social Democratic Party, he was invited to lead the PSD Parliamentary Group, a position he held until Menezes&#x27; resignation in June 2008.

On the 2009 local elections, Santana Lopes ran again for mayor of Lisbon, supported by his party and by the CDS - People&#x27;s Party, the Earth Party and the People&#x27;s Monarchist Party. This coalition was, however, unable to prevent the Socialist Party, led by António Costa, to achieve a big victory. Santana Lopes assumed the position of leader of the opposition in the municipality.

In September 2011, Santana Lopes was nominated by Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho to assume leadership of Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa, a charity that runs Portugal&#x27;s national lottery. In March 2016, the new prime minister, António Costa, nominated Santana Lopes for a new term.

In October 2017, Santana Lopes announced the intention to run again for the leadership of the Social Democratic Party. He resigned leadership of Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa in order to do so, but was defeated by Rui Rio. After the party election, both Rio and Santana tried to cooperate on several levels, an effort which was not successful from Santana&#x27;s point of view. He grew increasingly disgruntled with the course of action imposed by Rui Rio, and in June 2018 announced he would be ending his 42 years of party membership and would seek to create a new political party.

==Alliance (2018–2021)==

On 18 August 2018, it was revealed the new party headed and co-founded by Santana Lopes was to be called Alliance (). The party submitted the legally required paperwork to the Constitutional Court and was officially registered on 23 October.

Immediately after the official registration, the party started working on the campaign for the 2019 European Parliament election. Santana Lopes had already said, even before the party was registered, that he would not be running in the election, and that its top candidate would be announced in the near future. On 2 December 2018, the party formally announced Paulo de Almeida Sande, a professor of European affairs and advisor of the president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, as its top candidate. While being generally considered to have a profound knowledge of European issues, Paulo Sande lacked recognition next to the general public, and relied heavily on Santana&#x27;s personal popularity to engage with supporters and potential voters. In March 2019, Santana Lopes said that the party&#x27;s objective would be to elect at least one MEP, with three being a good result. Paulo Sande fared well in the televised debates, but the party suffered a heavy blow to its campaign on 15 May 2019, when Santana and Sande were involved in a car crash on the A1 motorway. They were heading to a campaign rally in Cascais after an event in Coimbra when, between Soure and Pombal, Santana fell asleep and lost control of the vehicle, a Lexus GS rented in name of his law firm. The car slid slowly to the left, hitting the central reservation barrier and veering abruptly to the right, crashing out of the road and tumbling several times before coming to a standstill in an overturned position. No other vehicles were involved in the accident, but other drivers witnessed it and alerted the emergency services. Paulo Sande was able to get out of the wrecked car by his own means; he tried to help Santana but was unable to release him. Santana Lopes would only be removed from the wreckage by the emergency services, and was transported by helicopter to Coimbra hospital, to where Sande was also taken on an ambulance. The accident was reported by several media outlets, which prompted Alliance to immediately suspend its campaign. Paulo Sande suffered only minor injuries and was discharged from the hospital a few hours later, while Santana spent the night in observation, being discharged on the next day after several exams revealed no significant lesions; he was, however, told by doctors to rest for some days in order to ensure a full recovery. This meant that, with little more than a week to the election day, Paulo Sande was largely left to campaign alone, although Santana appeared on a video three days before the election to urge people to vote. The party obtained 1,86% of the vote and elected no MEPs.

Next on the schedule were the 2019 legislative elections. The party made a campaign of clear opposition to the incumbent government led by António Costa. Santana Lopes said that Alliance hoped to elect two to three MPs in Lisbon district, and eventually some more in Porto and Braga districts; he also stressed that his party would never support a government of the Socialist Party even in the event of a hung parliament. Santana&#x27;s predictions for the election were based at the party&#x27;s results in the European elections. During a campaign event in Lisbon, he told that Alliance obtained 3% in the district at the European elections, and that the same result would allow the party to elect two MPs in the legislative vote. This line of thought proved to be flawed as the party performed considerably worse, obtaining only 0,77% of the vote on national level and electing no MPs. Even in Lisbon district, where it is easier for a small party to elect an MP, the party scored 1,27% of the vote, considerably lower than the 3% anticipated by Santana. On the election night, he admitted for the first time that he could relinquish party leadership.

Without further national elections in the near future, and with all the objectives unachieved, Santana Lopes suspended his executive functions as Alliance&#x27;s leader on 15 May 2020, and announced a period of reorganisation of the party. On 28 August 2020, it was announced that he would not seek re-election as party leader at the next congress, where he was succeeded by Paulo Bento. On 25 January 2021, Alliance announced that Santana Lopes had sent a request for his party membership to be terminated. He considered that Alliance could only have a future without him, citing the fact that many people still link him to the Social Democratic Party as the main reason.

==Independent politician and return to Figueira da Foz==

After Santana&#x27;s announcement that he was leaving Alliance leadership, rumours started circulating that he could be preparing a return to the Social Democratic Party. In October 2020, at least one media outlet reported that its leader, Rui Rio, wanted Santana Lopes to be the party candidate for mayor of Sintra; in March 2021, it was reported that he had declined to be the party candidate for mayor of Torres Vedras. His return to the Social Democratic Party was ruled out when it became known, in late March 2021, that he was seeking to create a citizen&#x27;s group in order to run for mayor of Figueira da Foz, a position he held between 1998 and 2001. His candidacy, leading a list called Figueira The First (), was confirmed in May and generated significant interest, with opinion polls giving him real chances of winning. The candidate of the Social Democratic Party, Pedro Machado, launched on 10 August a legal action to invalidate Santana&#x27;s candidacy due to alleged irregularities in its submission, which was rejected by the local court three days later.

Figueira a Primeira would effectively become the winner, obtaining 40,39% and four councillors, against 38,39% for the Socialist Party, also with four councillors. The Social Democratic Party scored 10,83%, electing only one councillor. Under Portuguese law, the top candidate of the most voted list automatically becomes the mayor, but Santana will have to negotiate with other political groups in order to implement his agenda, since he didn&#x27;t won a majority. He nevertheless considered the result &quot;an extraordinary accomplishment&quot;.

Santana Lopes took office as mayor of Figueira da Foz on 17 October 2021. On his inauguration speech, he announced to have reached a deal with the University of Coimbra to build a campus on Figueira da Foz, dedicated to marine economy and sciences. The campus opened on 20 December 2022.

On 20 April 2023, and without explicitly assuming a candidacy, Santana Lopes entertained the possibility of being a candidate for President of Portugal on the next election, saying that he saw no one better qualified than himself. However, he placed himself definitely out of the race on 19 October 2023, few days after the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war, citing the current state of world affairs as the main reason.

On 21 January 2024, Pedro Santana Lopes attended a convention of the Democratic Alliance, a coalition led by the Social Democratic Party in order to contest the 2024 legislative election. He made a speech praising Luís Montenegro, who reportedly felt moved while listening it. Since Santana formally remains an independent, his presence in the event again fuels speculation about his possible return to his former party.

==Outside politics==

After resigning as Secretary of State for Culture, Santana Lopes successfully ran for president of Sporting CP. Despite being in office for less than a year, the club won the 1994–1995 Taça de Portugal in football under his leadership.

<text>At Heaven&#x27;s Gate is a 1943 novel by Robert Penn Warren, his second. It was reprinted in New York by New Directions Publishing Corporation in 1985 with 

==Plot summary==
Sue Murdock searches for redemption throughout the novel. Her father repeatedly laments his inability to relate to his daughter. Sue rejects his assistance because she believes he is trying to control her. She has a stormy relationship with Jerry Calhoun, who, perhaps because he is profoundly naive and not particularly bright, is unable to understand her. Jerry clings to quaint notions of Southern honor and is respectful of the power and authority Bogan Murdock represents. Therefore, Sue can never be happy with him.

Sue rejects Jerry and soon finds herself with Slim Sarrett, a writer with a room full of pseudo-intellectual friends. Sue falls for Slim, who rejects honor and power in a way Jerry never could. In the end, however, nothing about Slim is real: he is a dedicated liar, deceitful to the last detail. As Sue discovers the depths of his lies — about his past and sexuality — she also discovers that he is not even, in fact, a particularly talented writer.

After rejecting Slim, and his artist&#x27;s pose, she falls into a tepid relationship with Sweetwater. Sweetwater is a cynic, unlike Jerry, and a realist, unlike Slim. Sweetwater is also profoundly honest and struggles to maintain true to himself. Sweetwater falls in love with Sue, but she never loves him in return.

One can read Sue to represent the Southern lower class, abused and controlled for generations. Who can help the lower class escape its shackles? Not the lower-class man who tastes a bit of success and abandons his class to serve selfish interests, as Jerry does. Not the intellectual, the artist, who poses at everything and is unable to fight for anything. The seduction is great, but the reward is small. Perhaps the honest man, Sweetwater&#x27;s labor organizer, can save the class he tries to raise up even as he is betrayed and rejected by it. Perhaps Sue knows that Sweetwater&#x27;s realism and devotion to cause can save her, but she is little interested in it.

==Nashville background==
&quot;At Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; can be definitely linked to Warren&#x27;s residence in Nashville, Tennessee during his time at Vanderbilt University. Scandals surrounding a Nashville bond-trading house, Caldwell &amp; Company, in the 1930s provide a close parallel to some of the machinations of the Murdock empire. Several Caldwell-linked banks were declared insolvent, and the state government itself became embroiled in the matter. Private Porsum is obviously based on Alvin C. York, Tennessee&#x27;s most famous war hero, although in real life York had nothing to do with the bond scandal. News reports have indicated that in later years Warren acknowledged the link between his story and Nashville events during the Great Depression.

<text>Takeley is a village and civil parish in the Uttlesford district of Essex, England.

==History==
A number of theories have arisen over the origin of the village&#x27;s name. One believes the village&#x27;s name was a corruption from the &quot;Teg-Ley&quot; of sheep clearing. Another theory is that Takeley is derived from the Saxon lord Taecca, who owned land in Essex and Oxfordshire, the latter of which has a village named Tackley. In more recent times, Takeley is thought to have derived from &quot;settlement next to open forest&quot; in reference to the Forest of Essex.

When Takeley was first recorded by the Normans in 1086–87 its boundaries were approximately 8 miles (13 km) in length, with a total area of 3,000 acres (12 km2). However, since the development of Stansted Airport, it has lost nearly a third of its land.

The previous Cooper&#x27;s End was demolished and the cargo area of Stansted Airport stands on the ground once occupied by the settlement. The access to and from the airport at Cooper&#x27;s End was closed briefly in January 1991 but was re-opened in November of that year. Cooper&#x27;s End roundabout was constructed as part of the new airport, and is just west of the terminal.

Takeley parish church, dating from the 12th century, is dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and was Grade I listed by English Heritage in 1967.

==Geography==

The village is situated approximately halfway between Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and Great Dunmow, and on Stane Street, the Roman road from Braughing to Colchester. The A120 road and Stansted Airport is at the north.

Takeley consists of a number of &#x27;Ends&#x27; and &#x27;Greens&#x27;, namely Brewer&#x27;s End (John le Brewer, 1327), The Street, Smith&#x27;s Green, Bamber&#x27;s Green (Bambrose Green, from the Banbury family at Sheering Hall), Molehill Green (Morrell&#x27;s Green), and Mill End.

==Governance==
Takeley is part of the electoral ward of Takeley and the Canfields. The population of the ward at the 2021 census was 7,192.

==Sport==
Takeley has a non-league football club, Takeley Football Club, who play at Station Road. They were members of the Essex Olympian League in 2007–08, and entered the Essex Senior League in 2008–09. The cricket team at Takeley was established .

<text>Starnberg is a town in Bavaria, Germany, some southwest of Munich. It is at the north end of Lake Starnberg, in the heart of the &quot;Five Lakes Country&quot;, and serves as capital of the district of Starnberg. Recording a disposable per-capita income of €26,120 in 2007, Starnberg regained its status as the wealthiest town in Germany.

==History==
The town was first mentioned in 1226 under the name of &quot;Aheim am Würmsee&quot;. Würmsee (Lake Würm, after the river of the same name) was the official name of Lake Starnberg until 1962.

The founding of Starnberg Castle is attributed to the Counts of Andechs and dates back to the 11th century. As a defensive structure, the castle is probably older due to its strategic location. Starnberg Castle was first mentioned in documents in 1244. After the death of the last Andechser (1248), the Wittelsbach family, dukes of Bavaria, took over the castle. The dukes then integrated the Starnberg area into their administrative and judicial system. From around 1346 it was the seat of its own court.

In 1541, under Duke Wilhelm IV, the medieval castle was demolished and a residential and defensive building was redesigned in the Renaissance style. Under Duke Albert V, the conversion into a pleasure palace and summer residence began. In 1643 the Swedes stormed the castle during the Thirty Years War and partially destroyed it. Under Elector Ferdinand Maria, the castle was an important summer residence, and from 1663 the magnificent ship &quot;Bucentaur&quot;, based on the Venetian model of the Doges of Venice, floated on Lake Starnberg.

In 1734, a large part of the now baroque palace was destroyed by fire, and the remaining buildings slowly fell into disrepair. From 1803 the castle was used as an office building for the regional court, the rent office and the forestry office. From 1969 to 1972 the castle was completely gutted and rebuilt, ever since used as a tax office.

At the beginning of the 19th century, wealthy families discovered the beauty of the landscape around Lake Starnberg and had the first villas built on the lakeshore as summer residences. Steam shipping was the real impetus for the village&#x27;s rapid development in the second half of the 19th century. A railway line has connected Starnberg with Munich since 1854. The opportunity to work in the city and live by the lake led to a real construction boom in the coming years. The city villas and country houses that professors, lawyers, artists and merchants now had built were no longer just intended to serve as summer homes, they were the main residence of the families.

After 1871, the steamer “Maximilian” carried a million passengers in three years. In 1872 the steamship “Ludwig” was put into operation. He was followed by the steamers “Bavaria” (1878), “Wittelsbach” (1886) and Luitpold (1890). The inns that had been built to cater for the excursionists were soon no longer sufficient, as more and more guests not only wanted to go on a country trip, but also wanted to spend their vacation in Starnberg. Entertainment was provided by sailing regattas, promenade concerts and, above all, a luxuriously equipped bathing establishment. By the turn of the century, in addition to guesthouses, large, elegant hotels had been built, which gave the place the flair of a seaside resort due to their appearance and the high-ranking public who stayed there. In 1890, sewerage began and in 1897 the community&#x27;s first power station went into operation - attracting more people willing to build, whose villas and parks on the surrounding hills completely changed the landscape. In 1900, the once 65 properties had become 384 in which 4,531 people lived.

Since an actual city center was never able to develop due to the short and intensive history of development from a small village to a city (1912), the demolition of many old buildings that became necessary and the construction of modern buildings changed the face of Starnberg particularly lastingly. The district town of Starnberg has developed from a tourist resort into a diversified business location and the cultural center of the surrounding Five Lakes Region. The core city (excluding the incorporated parts of the community) has now reached a population of just over 11,000.

<text>Torsten Nils Wiesel (born 3 June 1924) is a Swedish neurophysiologist. With David H. Hubel, he received the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system; the prize was shared with Roger W. Sperry for his independent research on the cerebral hemispheres.

==Career==
Wiesel was born in Uppsala, Sweden, in 1924, the youngest of five children. In 1947, he began his scientific career in Carl Gustaf Bernhard&#x27;s laboratory at the Karolinska Institute, where he received his medical degree in 1954. He went on to teach in the institute&#x27;s department of physiology and worked in the child psychiatry unit of the Karolinska Hospital. In 1955 he moved to the United States to work at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine under Stephen Kuffler. Wiesel began a fellowship in ophthalmology, and in 1958 he became an assistant professor. That same year, he met David Hubel, beginning a collaboration that would last over twenty years. In 1959 Wiesel and Hubel moved to Harvard University. He became an instructor in pharmacology at Harvard Medical School, beginning a 24-year career with the university. He became professor in the new department of neurobiology in 1968 and its chair in 1973.

In 1983, Wiesel joined the faculty of Rockefeller University as Vincent and Brooke Astor Professor and head of the Laboratory of Neurobiology. He was president of the university from 1991 to 1998. At Rockefeller University he remains co-director of the Shelby White and Leon Levy Center for Mind, Brain and Behavior.

From 2000 to 2009, Wiesel served as Secretary-General of the Human Frontier Science Program, an organization headquartered in Strasbourg, France, which supports international and interdisciplinary collaboration between investigators in the life sciences. Wiesel also has chaired the scientific advisory board of China&#x27;s National Institute of Biological Science (NIBS) in Beijing, and co-chairs the board of governors of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST). He is also member of the boards of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and an advisory board member of the European Brain Research Institute (EBRI).

Wiesel has also served as chair of the board of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center (1995–2001), president of the Society for Neuroscience (1978–1979), and the International Brain Research Organization (1998–2004). He was chair of the board of governors of the New York Academy of Sciences (2001–2006); and he was the academy&#x27;s chairman and interim director in 2001–2002.

==Research==
The Hubel and Wiesel experiments greatly expanded the scientific knowledge of sensory processing. In one experiment, done in 1959, they inserted a microelectrode into the primary visual cortex of an anesthetized cat. They then projected patterns of light and dark on a screen in front of the cat. They found that some neurons fired rapidly when presented with lines at one angle, while others responded best to another angle. They called these neurons &quot;simple cells.&quot; Still other neurons, which they termed &quot;complex cells,&quot; responded best to lines of a certain angle moving in one direction. These studies showed how the visual system builds an image from simple stimuli into more complex representations.

Hubel and Wiesel were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their work on ocular dominance columns in the 1960s and 1970s. By depriving kittens from using one eye, they showed that columns in the primary visual cortex receiving inputs from the other eye took over the areas that would normally receive input from the deprived eye. These kittens also did not develop areas receiving input from both eyes, a feature needed for binocular vision and stereopsis. Hubel and Wiesel&#x27;s experiments showed that the ocular dominance develops irreversibly early in childhood development. These studies opened the door for the understanding and treatment of childhood cataracts and strabismus. They were also important in the study of cortical plasticity.

==Awards and honors==
Wiesel is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and a foreign fellow of the Indian National Science Academy. He also holds the following awards and honors:
* Honorary degree, University of Pavia in 2006.
* Order of the Rising Sun, Grand Cordon, 2009 (Japan).
* Honorary Doctoral Degree in Science, University of Cambodia in 2010
* Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1981
* Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University, in 1978
* Elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1967
* Dr. Jules C. Stein Award in 1971
* Ferrier Medal and Lecture from the Royal Society in 1971
* Lewis S. Rosenstiel Award in 1972
* Freidenwald Award in 1975
* Karl Spencer Lashley Award in 1977
* Ledlie Prize in 1980
* Elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1980
* Elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1982
* Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1982
* W.H. Helmerich III Award in 1989
* Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience in 1993
* Helen Keller Prize for Vision Research in 1996
* Presidential Award in 1998
* David Rall Medal in 2005
* National Medal of Science in 2005 (US).
* Marshall M. Parks MD Medal of Excellence in 2007
In 2001, Wiesel was nominated for a position on an advisory panel in the National Institutes of Health to advise on assisting research in developing countries. Republican Tommy Thompson, who at the time was Secretary of Health and Human Services, rejected Wiesel. In addition to Wiesel, Thompson&#x27;s office rejected another 18 (out of 26) nominations and in return recommended other scientists that whistleblower Gerald Keusch described in an interview as &quot;lightweights&quot; with &quot;no scientific credibility&quot;. When Wiesel&#x27;s name was rejected, an official in Thompson&#x27;s office told Keusch that Wiesel had &quot;signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush.&quot; This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of abuse of science under President George W. Bush&#x27;s administration.

Wiesel was among the eight 2005 recipients of the National Medal of Science. In 2006, he was awarded the Ramon Y Cajal Gold Medal from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC - &quot;Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas&quot;). In 2007, both Wiesel and Hubel were awarded the Marshall M. Parks, MD Medal from The Children&#x27;s Eye Foundation.

==Personal life==
Wiesel is married to Lizette Mususa Reyes (m. 2008). Wiesel was married to Teeri Stenhammar from 1956 to 1970, Ann Yee from 1973 to 1981, and author and editor Jean Stein from 1995 to 2007. His daughter Sara Elisabeth was born in 1975.

Wiesel turned 100 on 3 June 2024.

===Human rights===
Wiesel has done much work as a global human rights advocate. He served for 10 years (1994–2004) as chair of the Committee of Human Rights of the National Academies of Science in the US, as well as the International Human Rights Network of Academies and Scholarly Societies. He was awarded the David Rall Medal from the Institute of Medicine in 2005, in recognition of this important work. In 2009, Wiesel was awarded the Grand Cordon Order of the Rising Sun Medal in Japan.

He is a founding member of the Israeli-Palestinian Science Organization, a nongovernmental nonprofit established in 2004 to support collaborative research between scientists in Israel and Palestine.

<text>London Guildhall University was a university in the United Kingdom from 1992 to 2002, established when the City of London Polytechnic was awarded university status. On 1 August 2002, it merged with the University of North London to form London Metropolitan University. The former London Guildhall University premises now form the new university&#x27;s City campus, situated on various sites in the City of London.
==History==
In 1848 Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London, called upon the clergy to establish evening classes to improve the moral, intellectual and spiritual condition of young men in London. In response, the Reverend Charles Mackenzie, who instituted the Metropolitan Evening Classes for Young Men in Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate, London, with student fees at one shilling per session. Subjects on the original curriculum included Greek, Latin, Hebrew, English, History, Mathematics, Drawing and Natural Philosophy. This fledgling college came under royal patronage following the visit of Prince Albert to the classes in 1851. In 1860 the classes moved to Sussex Hall, the former Livery Hall of the Bricklayers&#x27; Company, in Leadenhall Street. By this time, some 800 students were enrolled annually.

==City of London Polytechnic==

In 1861 the classes were reconstituted as the City of London College. Over the next twenty years, the college was one of the pioneers in the introduction of commercial and technical subjects. The college built new premises in White Street at a cost of £16,000 (contributions were received from Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales) and were opened in 1881. In 1891 the college joined the Birkbeck Institute (now Birkbeck College, University of London) and the Northampton Institute (now City University, London) to form the notional City Polytechnic by a Charity Commissioners&#x27; scheme to facilitate funding for these institutions by the City Parochial Foundation, and to enable the three institutions to work cooperatively. However this attempted federation did not function in practice, as each institution continued to operate more or less independently. The City Polytechnic concept was dissolved in 1906, and the City of London College came under the supervision of London County Council.

In December 1940 the college&#x27;s building was destroyed by a German air raid. The college subsequently moved into premises at 84 Moorgate (now the Guildhall School of Business and Law) in 1944. The college celebrated its centenary in 1948 with a service of thanksgiving addressed by the Archbishop of Canterbury at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

In 1970 the college merged with the Sir John Cass College of Arts and Science to form the City of London Polytechnic, which remained under the control of the Inner London Education Authority (part of the Greater London Council) until the passing of the Education Reform Act 1988. The London College of Furniture was incorporated into the polytechnic in 1990.

==London Guildhall University==
Under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 the polytechnic was awarded university status, previously having awarded the degrees of the former Council for National Academic Awards. London Guildhall University was named to show its links with the City of London and the City&#x27;s many guilds/livery companies. It was unassociated with the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, based at the Barbican Centre. LGU was ranked 30th out of the UK&#x27;s 43 new universities in the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise. In August 2004, in the midst of a contract dispute with former LGU staff following the merger with the University of North London, it was reported that the management of the merged institution had ordered the destruction of the entire print run of a history of the university – &quot;London Guildhall University: From Polytechnic to University&quot; – authored by Sean Glynn, formerly a senior research fellow in the department of Politics and Modern History; the work had been commissioned by Sir Roderick Floud, the President of London Metropolitan University, when Provost of LGU.

Following the merger with North London, London Metropolitan became the largest unitary university in London. It includes the Sir John Cass School of Art, Architecture and Design and Sir John Cass Hall of Residence, so named because of the continued support of Sir John Cass&#x27;s Foundation. In 2002, the unconnected City University Business School became the Sir John Cass Business School for similar reasons.

<text>Semigallians (; ; also &quot;Zemgalians&quot;, &quot;Semigalls&quot; or &quot;Semigalians&quot;) were the Baltic tribe that lived in the south central part of contemporary Latvia and northern Lithuania. They are noted for their long resistance (1219–1290) against the German crusaders and Teutonic Knights during the Northern Crusades.
Semigallians had close linguistic and cultural ties with Samogitians.

==Name==
The name of Semigallia appears in contemporary records as &quot;Seimgala&quot;, &quot;Zimgola&quot; and &quot;Sem&quot;[&quot;e&quot;]&quot;gallen&quot;. The -gal[l] element means &quot;border&quot;, while the first syllable corresponds to &quot;ziem&quot; (&quot;north&quot;) or &quot;zem&quot; (&quot;low&quot;). So the Semigallians were the &quot;people of the northern borderlands&quot; or &quot;people of the low borderlands&quot;, i.e. the lower parts of the Mūša and Lielupe river valleys.

== History ==
During the Viking Age, the Semigallians were involved in battles with Swedish Vikings over control of the lower part of the Daugava waterway. In &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; the Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus wrote that the Viking Starkad crushed the Curonians, all the tribes of Estonia, and the peoples of Semgala. When the Rurikid successors of the Varangians tried to subjugate the Semigallians, the latter defeated the invading army of Polotsk led by Prince Rogvolod Vseslavich in 1106. Russian chronicles claim that 9,000 Russian soldiers were killed.

At the start of German conquests Semigallian lands were divided in Upmale, Dobele, Spārnene, Dobe, Rakte, Silene and Tērvete chieftaincies.

According to the &quot;Livonian Chronicle of Henry&quot;, Semigallians formed an alliance with bishop Albert of Riga against rebellious Livonians before 1203, and received military support to hold back Lithuanian attacks in 1205. In 1207, the Semigallian duke Viestards () helped the christened Livonian chief Caupo conquer back his Turaida castle from pagan rebels.
In 1219, the Semigallian-German alliance was canceled after a crusader invasion in Semigallia. Duke Viestards promptly formed an alliance with Lithuanians and Curonians. In 1228, Semigallians and Curonians attacked the Daugavgrīva monastery, the main crusader stronghold at the Daugava river delta. The crusaders took revenge and invaded Semigallia. The Semigallians, in turn, pillaged land around the Aizkraukle hillfort. In 1236, Semigallians attacked crusaders retreating to Riga after the Battle of Saule, killing many of them. After regular attacks, the Livonian Order partly subdued the Semigallians in 1254.

In 1270, the Lithuanian Grand Duke Traidenis, together with Semigallians, attacked Livonia and Saaremaa. During the Battle of Karuse on the frozen gulf of Riga, the Livonian Order was defeated, and its master Otto von Lutterberg killed.
In 1287, around 1400 Semigallians attacked a crusader stronghold in Ikšķile and plundered nearby lands. As they returned to Semigallia they were caught by the Order&#x27;s forces, and the great battle began near the Garoza river (Battle of Garoza). The crusader forces were besieged and badly defeated. More than 40 knights were killed, including the master of the Livonian Order Willekin von Endorp, and an unknown number of crusader allies. It was the last Semigallian victory over the growing forces of the Livonian Order.

In 1279, after the Battle of Aizkraukle, Grand Duke Traidenis of Lithuania supported a Semigallian revolt against the Livonian Order led by duke Nameisis. 
In the 1280s, the Livonian Order started a massive campaign against the Semigallians, which included burning their fields and thus causing famine. The Semigallians continued their resistance until 1290, when they burned their last castle in Sidrabene, and a large number of Semigallians – the &quot;Rhymed Chronicle&quot; claims 100,000 – migrated to Lithuania and once there continued to fight against the Germans.

==Notable leaders==
There is an unconfirmed theory that the Semigallians were one of the first Baltic tribes to establish a monarchy, yet one weak in comparison to the power of the Semigallian nobles.

One of the most notable Semigallian leaders was duke Viestards (Viesturs). Upon uniting hostile Semigallian clans into a single state in the early 13th century, Viestards formed an alliance with the German crusaders to defeat his enemies on the outside. After the crusaders broke the treaty and invaded his lands, he allied with Lithuanians, resulting in the near annihilation of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in the Battle of Saule in 1236.
Duke Nameisis (Namejs, Nameitis), another renowned Semigallian leader, united Semigallian and Lithuanian tribes for a retaliatory counterattack on Teutonic Knights at Riga in 1279 and in Prussia after 1281. Main sources for his activities are &quot;Livländische Reimchronik&quot; and &quot;Das Zeugenverhör des Franciscus de Moliano (1312).&quot; What is known with certainty, however, is that by the end of the 1270s, a new powerful leader had emerged who achieved several major victories over German crusaders in Zemgale and East Prussia.

<text>Thomas Wentworth Wills (19 August 1835 – 2 May 1880) was an Australian sportsman who is credited with being Australia&#x27;s first cricketer of significance and a founder of Australian rules football. Born in the British penal colony of New South Wales to a wealthy family descended from convicts, Wills grew up in the bush on stations owned by his father, the squatter and politician Horatio Wills, in what is now the state of Victoria. As a child, he befriended local Aboriginal people, learning their language and customs. Aged 14, Wills went to England to attend Rugby School, where he became captain of its cricket team and played an early version of rugby football. After Rugby, Wills represented Cambridge University in the annual cricket match against Oxford, and played at first-class level for Kent and the Marylebone Cricket Club. An athletic bowling all-rounder with tactical nous, he was regarded as one of the finest young cricketers in England.

Returning to Victoria in 1856, Wills achieved Australia-wide stardom captaining the Victoria cricket team to repeated victories in intercolonial matches. He played for the Melbourne Cricket Club but often clashed with its administrators, his larrikin streak and defections to rival clubs straining their relationship. In 1858, seeking a winter pastime for cricketers, he called for the formation of a &quot;foot-ball club&quot; with a &quot;code of laws&quot;. He captained a Melbourne side that winter, and in 1859 co-wrote its laws—the basis of Australian rules. Over their careers, he and his cousin H. C. A. Harrison further developed the game as players, umpires and administrators. In 1861, at the height of his fame, Wills went to outback Queensland to help run a new family station. Soon after his arrival, his father and 18 station personnel were killed in Australia&#x27;s largest massacre of colonists by Aboriginal people. Wills survived and returned to Victoria in 1864, and in 1866–67, he led an Aboriginal cricket team on an Australian tour as its captain-coach.

In a career marked by controversy, Wills subverted cricket&#x27;s amateur-professional divide, and was accused of popularising intimidatory tactics, such as the head-high bouncer. He also earned a reputation for bending sporting rules to the point of cheating, in particular throwing. This he boasted about, and in 1872 he became the first cricketer to be called in a top-class Australian match. Dropped from the Victorian team, Wills failed in an 1876 comeback attempt, by which time he was considered a relic of a bygone era. During this period, he supported Australia&#x27;s first organised women&#x27;s cricket team—the only prominent male cricketer to do so. His final years were characterised by social alienation, flights from creditors, and heavy drinking, likely as a means of numbing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms that resulted from the massacre. In 1880, suffering from delirium tremens, Wills fatally stabbed himself in the heart.

Australia&#x27;s first sporting celebrity, Wills fell into obscurity after his death, but has undergone a revival in Australian culture since the 1980s. Today he is described as an archetypal tragic sports hero and as a symbol of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. He has also become the central figure in &quot;football&#x27;s history wars&quot;—an ongoing dispute over whether Marn Grook, an Aboriginal ball game, influenced early Australian rules. According to biographer Greg de Moore, Wills &quot;stands alone in all his absurdity, his cracked egalitarian heroism and his fatal self-destructiveness—the finest cricketer and footballer of the age&quot;.

==Family and early years==

Wills was born on 19 August 1835 on the Molonglo Plain near modern-day Canberra, in the British penal colony (now the Australian state) of New South Wales, as the elder child of Horatio and Elizabeth (née McGuire) Wills. Tom was a third-generation Australian of convict descent: his mother&#x27;s parents were Irish convicts, and his paternal grandfather Edward was an English highwayman whose death sentence for armed robbery was commuted to transportation, arriving in Botany Bay aboard the &quot;hell ship&quot; in 1799. Granted a conditional pardon in 1803, Edward became rich through mercantile activity in Sydney with his free wife Sarah (née Harding). He died in 1811, five months before Horatio&#x27;s birth, and Sarah remarried to convict George Howe, owner of Australia&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Sydney Gazette&quot;. Mainly self-educated, Horatio worked in the &quot;Gazette&quot; office from a young age, rising to become editor in 1832, the same year he met Elizabeth, an orphan from Parramatta. They married in December 1833. Seventeen months after his birth, Tom was baptised Thomas Wentworth Wills in St Andrew&#x27;s, Sydney, after statesman William Wentworth. Drawing on Wentworth&#x27;s pro-currency writings and the emancipist cause, Horatio, in his nationalist journal &quot;The Currency Lad&quot; (1832–33), made the first call for an Australian republic.
Horatio turned to pastoralism in the mid-1830s and moved with his family to the sheep run Burra Burra on the Molonglo River close to the present site of Burra. Tom was athletic early on but also prone to illness, his parents at one stage in 1839 &quot;almost [despairing] of his recovery&quot;. The following year, in light of Thomas Mitchell&#x27;s account of &quot;Australia Felix&quot;, the Willses overlanded south with shepherds and their families to the Grampians in the colony&#x27;s Port Phillip District (now the state of Victoria). After squatting on Mount William, they moved a few miles north through the foothills of Mount Ararat, named so by Horatio because &quot;like the Ark, we rested there&quot;. Horatio went through a period of intense religiosity while in the Grampians; at times his diary descends into incantation, &quot;perhaps even madness&quot;, according to a number of scholarly assessments. He implored himself and Tom to base their lives upon the Gospel of John.

Living in tents, the Wills family settled a large property named Lexington (near present-day Moyston) in an area used by Djab wurrung Aboriginal clans as a meeting place. According to family members, Tom, as one of the few white children in the area, &quot;was thrown much into the companionship of aborigines&quot;. In an account of corroborees from childhood, his cousin H. C. A. Harrison remembered Tom&#x27;s ability to learn Aboriginal songs, mimic their voice and gestures, and &quot;speak their language as fluently as they did themselves, much to their delight.&quot; He may have also played Aboriginal sports. Horatio wrote fondly of his son&#x27;s kinship with Aboriginal people, and allowed local clans to live and hunt on Lexington. However, George Augustus Robinson, the district&#x27;s Chief Protector of Aborigines, implicated Horatio and other local settlers in the murder of Aboriginal people. Horatio blamed &quot;distant predatory tribes&quot; for provoking hostilities in the area, and the closest he came to admitting that he had killed Aboriginal people was in a letter to Governor Charles La Trobe: &quot;... we shall be compelled in self defence to measures that may involve us in unpleasant consequences&quot;.

Tom&#x27;s first sibling, Emily, was born on Christmas Day 1842. In 1846 Wills began attendance at William Brickwood&#x27;s School in Melbourne, where he lived with Horatio&#x27;s brother Thomas (Tom&#x27;s namesake), a Victorian separatist and son-in-law of the Wills family&#x27;s partner in the shipping trade, convict Mary Reibey. Tom played in his first cricket matches at school and came in contact with the Melbourne Cricket Club through Brickwood, the club&#x27;s vice-president. By 1849, the year Wills&#x27; schooling in Melbourne ended, his family had grown to include brothers Cedric, Horace and Egbert. Horatio had ambitious plans for the education of his children, especially Tom:
==England==
===Rugby School===

Wills&#x27; father sent him to England in February 1850, aged fourteen, to attend Rugby School, then the most prestigious school in the country. In his scheme for his children, Horatio wanted Tom to go on to study law at the University of Cambridge and return to Australia as a &quot;professional man of eminence&quot;. Tom arrived in London after a five-month sea voyage. There, during school holidays, he stayed with his paternal aunt Sarah, who moved from Sydney after the death of her first husband, convict William Redfern.

Reforms enacted by famed headmaster Thomas Arnold made Rugby the crucible of muscular Christianity, a &quot;cult of athleticism&quot; into which Wills was inculcated. Wills took up cricket within a week of entering Evans House. At first he bowled underhand, but it was considered outdated, so he tried roundarm bowling. He clean bowled a batsman with his first ball using this style and declared: &quot;I felt I was a bowler.&quot; Wills soon topped all of his house&#x27;s cricket statistics. At bat he was a &quot;punisher&quot; with a sound defence; however, in an era when stylish stroke-play was expected of amateurs, Wills was said to have no style at all. In April 1852, aged sixteen, he joined the Rugby School XI, and on his debut at Lord&#x27;s against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) a few months later, he took a match-high 12 wickets. While his bowling proved vital that year in establishing Rugby as the greatest public school in English cricket, anonymous critics in the press stated that he ought to be no-balled for throwing. Rugby coach John Lillywhite, considered an authority on bowling, came to his protégé&#x27;s defence, rescuing him from further scandal. Wills went on to play with, and attracted praise from the leading cricketers of the age, including Alfred Mynn. He ended 1853 with the season&#x27;s best bowling average, and in 1854 his hero William Clarke invited him to join the All-England Eleven, but he remained at school. The next year, he became Rugby XI captain.
Like other English public schools, Rugby had evolved its own variant of football. The game in Wills&#x27; era—a rough and highly defensive struggle often involving hundreds of boys—was confined to a competition amongst the houses. Spanning his school years, Wills is one of the few players whose on-field exploits feature in the newspapers&#x27; otherwise brief match reports. His creative play and &quot;eel-like agility&quot; baffled the opposition, and his penchant for theatrics endeared him to the crowds. One journalist noted his use of &quot;slimy tricks&quot;, a possible early reference to his gamesmanship. As a &quot;dodger&quot; in the forward line who served his house&#x27;s kicker, he took long and accurate shots at goal. Wills also shone in the school&#x27;s annual athletics carnival and frequently won the long-distance running game Hare and Hounds.

Wills cut a dashing figure with &quot;impossibly wavy&quot; hair and blue, almond-shaped eyes that &quot;[burnt] with a pale light&quot;. By age 16 at 5&#x27;8&quot; he had already outgrown his father. In &quot;Lillywhite&#x27;s Guide&quot; a few years later he measured in at 5&#x27;10&quot; and it was written that &quot;few athletes can boast of a more muscular and well-developed frame&quot;.

Consumed by sport, Wills fell behind in academics, much to his father&#x27;s chagrin. One schoolmate recalled that he &quot;could not bring himself to study for professional work&quot; after &quot;having led a sort of nomadic life when a youth in Australia&quot;. Suffering from homesickness, Wills decorated his study with objects to remind him of Australia, including Aboriginal weapons. In a letter to Tom, Horatio informed him that his childhood friends, the Djab wurrung, often spoke about him: &quot;They told me to send you up to them as soon as you came back.&quot;

===Libertine cricketer===
In June 1855, nearing his 20th birthday, Wills finished his schooling. Hailed as Rugby&#x27;s exemplar sportsman, his status as a cricketer had come to define him in the eyes of others. In a farewell tribute, fellow students referred to him simply as &quot;the school bowler&quot;.

After leaving Rugby, and with a steady supply of money from his father, Wills roamed Britain in pursuit of cricketing pleasure. Regarded as &quot;one of the most promising cricketers in the kingdom&quot;, he played with royalty, made first-class appearances for the MCC, Kent County Cricket Club, and various Gentlemen sides, and also fell in with the I Zingari—the &quot;gypsy lords of English cricket&quot;—a club of wealthy amateurs known for their exotic costumes and hedonistic lifestyles. Against Horatio&#x27;s wishes, Tom, having failed to matriculate, did not continue his studies at Cambridge, but played for the university&#x27;s cricket team (as well as Magdalene College), most notably against Oxford in 1856 when rules barring non-students from playing in the University Match were ignored, Cambridge claiming to be &quot;one man short&quot;. In June, Wills played cricket at Rugby School for the last time, representing the MCC alongside Lord Guernsey, the Earl of Winterton, and Charles du Cane, governor-to-be of Tasmania. Following a month of cricket in Ireland, Wills, at the behest of Horatio, returned to England to prepare for his journey home to Australia.

The last eighteen months had exposed Wills to &quot;the richest sporting experience on earth&quot;. His six years in England charted a way of life—one of drinking, reckless spending and playing games—that he would follow until his death.

==Colonial hero==
Wills returned to Australia aboard the &quot;Oneida&quot; steamship, arriving in Melbourne on 23 December 1856. The minor port city of his youth had risen to world renown as the booming financial centre of the Victorian gold rush. Horatio, now a member of the Legislative Assembly in the Victorian Parliament, lived on &quot;Belle Vue&quot;, a farm at Point Henry near Geelong, the Wills&#x27; family home since 1853. In his first summer back in Melbourne, Wills stayed with his extended family, the Harrisons, at their home on Victoria Parade, and entered a Collins Street law firm to appease his father, but he seems never to have practised; the few comments he made about law suggest it meant little to him. &quot;Tom was no dunce&quot;, writes Greg de Moore. He was &quot;negotiating a path to greatness.&quot;

The Australian colonies were described as &quot;cricket mad&quot; in the 1850s, and Victorians, in particular, were said to live &quot;in an atmosphere of cricket&quot;. Intercolonial contests, first held in 1851, provided an outlet for the at times intense rivalry between Victoria and New South Wales. With his reputation preceding him, Wills bore Victoria&#x27;s hopes of winning its first match against the elder colony. William Hammersley, a former acquaintance in England and now captain of the Victoria XI, recalled Wills&#x27; first appearance on the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) for a trial match, staged one week after his return:
Wills won the match for his side with a top score of 57 not out, and &quot;The Age&quot; said of his playing style and entertaining ability that &quot;there has not been a more amusing scene on this ground&quot;. In the January 1857 intercolonial against New South Wales, held on the Domain in Sydney, Wills was the leading wicket-taker with ten victims, but failed with the bat. Bowling fast round-arm, the Victorians scoffed at the &quot;antiquated&quot; underhand action of their opponents. The latter style proved effective, however, giving New South Wales a 65-run win. Back in Victoria, Wills joined numerous clubs, including the provincial Corio Cricket Club, based in Geelong, and the elite Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC). Although he had a greater affinity for Corio, the MCC maintained that Wills belonged to them, and took offence at his lack of loyalty to any one club. In order to secure Wills in matches between the two teams, the MCC allowed Corio to field an extra five men to make up for his loss.
Parliament and business came to a standstill in Melbourne for the January 1858 intercolonial match between Victoria and New South Wales, held at the MCG. Captaining Victoria, Wills took 8 wickets, the most of his side, and on the second day, batting in the middle order, a ball hit an imperfection in the pitch and knocked him unconscious. He recovered, played on for two hours, and won the match at day&#x27;s end with a top score of 49*. The crowd rushed the field and chaired Wills off in triumph, and victory celebrations lasted for several days throughout the colony. Now a household name and the darling of Melbourne&#x27;s elite, Wills was proclaimed &quot;the greatest cricketer in the land&quot;.

Although Wills enjoyed his lofty amateur status, he liked to socialise with and support working class professional cricketers—an egalitarian attitude that sometimes led to conflict with sporting officialdom but endeared him to the common man. Wills&#x27; allegiance to professionals was highlighted by an incident in Tasmania in February 1858 when the Launceston Cricket Club shunned professional members of his touring Victorian side. Infuriated, he spoke out against being &quot;forsaken&quot; in a &quot;strange land&quot;. One week later, during a game in Hobart, Wills earned the locals&#x27; ire as he &quot;[jumped] about exultantly&quot; after maiming a Tasmanian batsman with a spell of hostile fast bowling.

Wills served as the MCC&#x27;s secretary during the 1857–58 season. It was a role in which he proved to be chaotic and disorganised. MCC delegates took issue with Wills&#x27; &quot;continued non-attendance&quot; at meetings, and when the club fell into debt, his poor administrative skills were blamed. In mid-1858, he acted on year-long threats and deserted the club, leaving its records and amenities in disarray; to this day, the only MCC minutes that cannot be found date from his secretaryship. A lasting tension existed between Wills and the MCC&#x27;s inner circle. According to Martin Flanagan, &quot;It was a relationship which couldn&#x27;t last as Wills only knew one way—his own.&quot;

==Football pioneer==
Wills was a compulsive writer to the press on cricketing matters and in the late 1850s his letters sometimes appeared on a daily basis. An agitator like his father, he used language &quot;in the manner of a speaker declaiming forcefully from a platform&quot;. On 10 July 1858, the Melbourne-based &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in Victoria and Sporting Chronicle&quot; published by Wills that is regarded as a catalyst for a new style of football, known today as Australian rules football. Titled &quot;Winter Practice&quot;, it begins:
In endeavouring to keep cricketers active during the off-season, Wills made the first public declaration of its kind in Australia: that football should be a regular and organised activity. Around this time he helped to foster football in Melbourne&#x27;s schools. The local headmasters, his collaborators, were inspired in large part by descriptions of football in Thomas Hughes&#x27; novel &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; (1857), an account of life at Rugby School under the headship of Thomas Arnold. Due to similarities between their sporting careers at Rugby, Wills has been called the &quot;real-life embodiment&quot; of Tom Brown, the novel&#x27;s fictitious hero.

Wills&#x27; letter was alluded to two weeks after its publication in an advertisement posted by his friend, professional cricketer and publican Jerry Bryant, for a &quot;scratch match&quot; held adjacent to the MCG at the Richmond Paddock. The first of several kickabouts held that year involving Wills, Bryant and other Melbourne cricketers, it was described by one participant as &quot;football &quot;; a &quot;short code of rules&quot; were to be drawn up afterwards, however this does not seem to have occurred. Another landmark game, played without fixed rules over three Saturdays and co-umpired by Wills and teacher Dr John Macadam, began on the same site on 7 August between forty Scotch College students and a like number from Melbourne Grammar. The two schools have since competed annually. Wills emerged as the standout figure in accounts of Melbourne football in 1858. These early experimental games were more rugby-like than anything else—low-scoring, low-to-the-ground &quot;gladiatorial&quot; tussles. The last recorded match of the year is the subject of the first known Australian football poem, published in &quot;Punch&quot;. Wills, the only player named, is reified as &quot;the Melbourne chief&quot;, leading his men to victory against a side from South Yarra.

Following a scratch match at the start of the 1859 football season, the Melbourne Football Club officially came into being on 14 May. Three days later, Wills and three other members—Hammersley, journalist J. B. Thompson and teacher Thomas H. Smith—met near the MCG at the Parade Hotel, owned by Bryant, to devise and codify the club&#x27;s rules. The men went over the rules of four English schools; Hammersley recalled Wills&#x27; preference for the Rugby game, but it was found to be confusing and too violent. Subsequently, they rejected common features such as &quot;hacking&quot; (shin-kicking) and produced a signed document listing ten simple rules suited to grown men and Australian conditions. Heading the list of signatories, Wills, too, saw the need for compromise. He wrote to his brother Horace: &quot;Rugby was not a game for us, we wanted a winter pastime but men could be harmed if thrown on the ground so we thought differently.&quot; Thompson and Hammersley&#x27;s promotion of the new code, together with Wills&#x27; star power, encouraged the spread of football throughout Victoria.

==Height of celebrity==

After falling out with the MCC, Wills moved freely about Victoria, playing for any club of his choosing. He became president of Collingwood and vice-president of Richmond, raising the standard of the latter club&#x27;s play to make it the best in the colony. There were calls to ban Wills from certain club matches, for his unexpected appearance in a side, often as a late inclusion, altered the odds to such an extent that bookmakers felt compelled to declare &quot;&quot;. All clubs still coveted Wills when it suited their cause, and scarcely a day passed when he did not play or practice cricket.

Wills retained the Victorian captaincy for the January 1859 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Domain. Despite breaking his right middle finger on day one while attempting a catch, Wills top scored in the first innings with 15* and took 5/24 and 6/25, carrying Victoria to an upset win. Later that year, he resigned from the intercolonial match committee in protest after Thompson publicly chastised him for not attending practice ahead of the next match against New South Wales. During a follow-up practice match, players struggled in the day&#x27;s heat, and ignoring calls to retire, Wills suffered a near-fatal sunstroke. Hammersley wrote that Wills felt obliged to perform for the large crowd that had gathered to watch him. Over 25,000 people attended the MCG in February 1860 to see Victoria, captained by Wills, play New South Wales. Wills bowled unchanged in both innings, taking 6/23 and 3/16, and top scored with 20*. Victoria won by 69 runs.

The Melbourne media gave Wills the sobriquet &quot;Great Gun of the Colony&quot;. A British correspondent called him &quot;a cricketer born&quot;. The Sydney press, championing Wills as a native New South Welshman, agreed:

Wills remained an influential figure in Australian football from 1859 to 1860. While he fought for the adoption of several Rugby School customs—such as a free kick for marking, the use of an oval-shaped ball, and (unsuccessfully) a crossbar—he pushed the game in new directions as a captain and tactician. During an 1860 match, he used positional play to exploit the code&#x27;s lack of an offside law, at which point, according to James Coventry, &quot;the full potential of the sport started to be realised&quot;.

At Wills&#x27; insistence, his cousin H. C. A. Harrison took up football in 1859, and quickly became a leading player and captain. Harrison venerated Wills, terming him &quot;the beau-ideal of an athlete&quot;—high praise given Harrison&#x27;s status as the champion runner of Victoria. Their presence in Geelong fuelled a local craze for football and helped ensure during the game&#x27;s early years the supremacy of the Geelong Football Club, which Wills captained in 1860. In an era when players moved freely among clubs, he still occasionally captained, and served on the committee of Melbourne, and in 1860, became the first captain and secretary of the Richmond Football Club (no connection with today&#x27;s AFL club). The code underwent revisions around this time, principally in response to the on-field actions of dominant players. &quot;And there were none more dominant than Wills and Harrison&quot;, writes Coventry.

==Queensland==

With plans underway for the first tour of Australia by an English cricket team, Wills announced his retirement from sport. At his father&#x27;s beckoning, Wills agreed to leave Victoria to help found and manage a new family station, Cullin-la-ringo, on the Nogoa River in outback Queensland. He prepared for six months in country Victoria where learnt the crafts of a squatter. In his will, Horatio—showing a &quot;deep understanding&quot; of Tom&#x27;s personality—wrote that his son would be removed from the station and receive a diminished inheritance in the event of &quot;misconducting himself&quot; as manager.

In January 1861, Tom, Horatio and a party of employees and their families travelled by ship to Brisbane, disembarked in Moreton Bay, and then, with livestock and supplies, set out on an eight-month trek through Queensland&#x27;s rugged interior. Food was scarce and Tom hunted native game to fend off starvation. They suffered many other hardships and even death when, in Toowoomba, one of Horatio&#x27;s men drowned. On the Darling Downs over 10,000 sheep were collected. Hitherto the largest group of colonists to enter the area, the Wills party drew the attention of local Aboriginal people. Wary of what he called the &quot;perpetual war between the whites and blacks&quot; of Central Queensland, Horatio sought to avoid conflict. The party reached Cullin-la-ringo, situated on Gayiri Aboriginal land, in early October, and proceeded to set up camp.

===Cullin-la-ringo massacre===
On 17 October, Horatio and 18 of his party died in Australia&#x27;s deadliest massacre of colonists by Aboriginal people. Tom was away from the property at the time, having been sent with two stockmen to collect supplies the party left en route. He returned several days later to a scene of devastation. Despairing and vengeful, Wills first wrote to Harrison in Melbourne, listing for him the victims and requesting that he send replacements: &quot;men that will shoot every black they see&quot;. Over the following weeks, police, native police and vigilante groups from neighbouring stations drove the Gayiri to near-extinction; an estimated 370 were killed. Due to a dearth of evidence, it has been said that Wills took no part in the counter-massacres. The question of his participation was raised in 2021 after a report that an anonymous &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article, dating from 1895, quotes him as saying that, during a raid on an Aboriginal camp, he and other avengers &quot;killed all in sight&quot;.

Conflicting reports reached the outside world and for a time it was feared that Tom had died. In the press, Horatio was accused of ignoring warnings and allowing Aboriginal people to encroach on his property. The retribution was also deemed excessive. Tom vehemently defended his father against any perceived criticism. Privately, in his letter to Harrison, he admitted, &quot;if we had used common precaution all would have been well&quot;. It was later revealed that, prior to leaving the camp, Tom &quot;had a sort of presentiment&quot; and advised those remaining to arm themselves, including Horatio, who assured him &quot;It was only his boyish fears&quot;. The Queensland press, still in the wake of the massacre, suggested that Wills, &quot;now a Queenslander&quot;, be approached to captain the colony&#x27;s cricket team.

Different reasons were put forward at the time to account for the Wills tragedy. For many colonists, it confirmed the popular belief that Aboriginal people were bloodthirsty s. Tom never articulated his version of events in writing, but his brother Cedric wrote years later that it was an act of revenge for an attack made on local Aboriginal people by Jesse Gregson, a neighbouring squatter whom they mistook to be Horatio. Cedric quoted Tom as saying, &quot;If the truth is ever known, you will find that it was through Gregson shooting those blacks; that was the cause of the murder.&quot;

In the years following the massacre, Wills experienced flashbacks, nightmares and an irritable heart—symptoms of what is now known as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Having eagerly participated in the drinking culture of colonial sport, he increased his alcohol consumption in a likely attempt to blot out memories and alleviate sleep disturbance. Wills&#x27; sister Emily wrote of him two months after the massacre: &quot;He says he never felt so changed in the whole course of his life&quot;.

===Riot and expulsion===

Wills made a vow over Horatio&#x27;s grave to remain on Cullin-la-ringo and make it &quot;the pride of Queensland&quot;—words that, according to de Moore, &quot;enshrined and imprisoned&quot; Tom as the new head of the family. He began to rebuild the station pending the arrival of his uncle-in-law, William Roope, who took control of Cullin-la-ringo in December 1861, but soon left due to Wills&#x27; &quot;exceedingly ill&quot; treatment of him. Hypervigilant, Wills slept only three hours a night with a rifle within reach and watched for signs of another Aboriginal attack. Bushrangers and wildlife also posed threats, and for several weeks &quot;sandy blight&quot; left him half-blind. Short of station hands, he at times led the solitary life of a shepherd. &quot;There is no one up here to love old Tom but the gum trees and the little lambs&quot;, he wrote to his mother.

He went to Sydney in January 1863 to captain Victoria against New South Wales on the Domain. A run out dispute led to Wills&#x27; decision to abandon play. A crowd riot ensued, with the &quot;cabbage tree mob&quot; stoning and beating the Victorians with sticks; Wills received a &quot;severe blow&quot; in the face from a stone before escaping the ground with his men under police escort. Despite this, and with only a nine-man batting order due to William Greaves and George Marshall having fled the city, Wills agreed to resume play the next day. He took 8 wickets and top scored in both innings (25* and 17*), but it was not enough to secure victory. The Melbourne media castigated Wills for allowing the game to resume, and Sydneysiders called him a turncoat for reneging on an earlier promise to play for New South Wales. He denied all accusations and wrote in an angry letter to &quot;The Sydney Herald&quot;: &quot;I for one do not think that Victoria will ever send an Eleven up here again.&quot; Back in Victoria, he became engaged to Julie Anderson, a squatter&#x27;s daughter. He seems to have done so to meet familial expectations. Even so, he was chided by his siblings for prioritising cricket over courtship. In May, as his mother grew concerned over his neglect of Cullin-la-ringo, Wills extended his sojourn south to play football in Geelong.

Wills finally returned to Queensland in May and was sworn in as a Justice of the Peace upon arrival in Brisbane. Over the next few months at Cullin-la-ringo, he reported to the press at least three fatal Aboriginal attacks on local colonists, a shepherd of his numbering among the victims. He accosted government officials for failing to send a native police detachment to his station for protection, and scorned city-dwellers for sympathising with the plight of Aboriginal people in the Nogoa region. With the cricket season approaching, Wills agreed to captain Queensland against New South Wales, and then left the colony to lead a Victoria XXII at the MCG against George Parr&#x27;s All-England Eleven. In awe of his 1,800 mile dash across the continent to play cricket, the English thought it a madman&#x27;s journey. Wills arrived on the final day of the match to a rapturous reception, and went in as a substitute fielder. He then joined the visitors on their Victorian tour.

The 1863–64 season saw Wills&#x27; engagement to Anderson collapse, possibly due to his womanising, and the trustees of Cullin-la-ringo accused him of mismanaging the property, in part by squandering family finances on alcohol while claiming it as station expenditure. They demanded that he stay in Victoria to answer for the property&#x27;s runaway debt. In response, Wills left Australia to join Parr&#x27;s XI on a month-long tour of New Zealand. Initially standing in as umpire, he went on to captain local teams against the English, and filled the same role for a Victoria XXII at the end of the tour in Melbourne. He faced the trustees soon after. With his mother&#x27;s reluctant approval, they dismissed him from Cullin-la-ringo, thus fulfilling the premonition in Horatio&#x27;s will.

==Return to Victoria==

Wills moved to the family home in Geelong. Always a black sheep of sorts, he became increasingly estranged from his mother and sister Emily from this point on. Family letters from mid-1864 reveal that Wills had a &quot;wife&quot;—a &quot;bad woman&quot;, according to Emily. It is likely a reference to the already-married Sarah Barbor (&quot;née&quot; Duff). Born in Dublin, she is a mysterious figure, but is known to have remained Wills&#x27; lifelong partner. The de facto nature of their relationship, and even Barbor&#x27;s existence, were probably kept secret from Wills&#x27; mother for a number of years.

Throughout the 1865 football season, Wills played for and served on the committees of Melbourne and Geelong, then the game&#x27;s most powerful clubs. At the end of a winter beset with public brawls over which team &quot;owned&quot; him, Wills moved to Geelong for the remainder of his career, prompting &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in Victoria&quot; to report that Melbourne had lost &quot;the finest leader of men on the football field&quot;. The following year, when the running bounce and other rules were formalised at a meeting of club delegates under Harrison&#x27;s chairmanship, Wills was not present; his move to Geelong had cut him off from the rule-making process in Melbourne.

Intercolonials between Victoria and New South Wales resumed at the MCG on Boxing Day 1865, nearly three years since the Sydney riot. Sam Cosstick, William Caffyn and other Victorian professionals defected to the rival colony due to pay disputes with the MCC. Wills, leading the weakened Victorian side to an against-the-odds win, took 6 wickets and contributed 58—the first half century in Australian first-class cricket—to 285, a record intercolonial total. Allegations that Wills cheated his way to victory failed to endanger his status as a folk hero and &quot;a source of eternal hope&quot; for Victoria.

==Aboriginal cricket team==
In May 1866, plans were made by the MCC to host and play against an Aboriginal team from Victoria&#x27;s Western District. The motive behind the match, set for Boxing Day of that year, was a financial one, and in August, Wills agreed to coach the Aboriginal players. Wills&#x27; reasons for accepting the role remain a mystery, but a growing need for money likely influenced his decision. The enterprise was to mark the beginning of his transition from amateur to professional sportsman.

Wills travelled inland in November to gather the players from Edenhope and Harrow, where they worked as station hands. One of their employers, William Hayman, had helped train them in cricket over the preceding few years, and acted as the team&#x27;s manager and &quot;protector&quot;. Mostly Jardwadjali men, they shared common vocabulary with the neighbouring Djab wurrung people, which enabled Wills to coach them in the Aboriginal language he learnt as a child. From their training ground at Lake Wallace, Wills, in a &quot;tactical strike&quot;, boasted to the Melbourne press of the Aboriginal players&#x27; skills, especially the batsmanship of Unamurriman, commonly known as Mullagh. Unsettled by Wills&#x27; claims, the MCC strengthened the ranks of its Boxing Day side with non-members. This drew widespread criticism, and public sympathy was with the Aboriginal players when they arrived in Melbourne in late December. Over 10,000 spectators went to the MCG to see them play. Captained by Wills, they lost against the MCC&#x27;s reinforced side, but won unanimous praise for their performance. Wills afterwards accused the MCC of &quot;treachery&quot;.

The team provoked much public discussion over past mistreatment of Aboriginal people and future relations between the races. It is unknown what Wills and his Aboriginal teammates made of these broader social and political dimensions of the enterprise. Some of Wills&#x27; contemporaries were shocked that he would associate with Aboriginal people in the shadow of his father&#x27;s death. Others, such as this contributor to &quot;The Empire&quot;, addressed him as a hero:

Wills&#x27; role took on a symbolic significance: supporters and critics alike used his status as a &#x27;native&#x27; (Australian-born colonist) to identify him with his &#x27;&#x27; (Indigenous) teammates, and he was also noted for speaking in &quot;their own lingo&quot;. Jellico (Murrumgunarriman), the &quot;team jester&quot;, joked to the press: &quot;[Wills] too much along of us. He speak nothing now but talk&quot;. While Melburnians were enthralled by Wills and the Aboriginal team, the annual intercolonial between Victoria and New South Wales—usually the season highlight—failed to excite public interest, and Victoria&#x27;s loss in Sydney was partly attributed to Wills&#x27; absence. The Aboriginal players improved as they toured Victoria under his captaincy in January. After an easy win in Geelong, Wills took the team to &quot;Belle Vue&quot; to meet his mother. Back in Melbourne, two members, Bullocky (Bullenchanach) and Cuzens (Yellana), joined Wills in representing Victoria against a Tasmanian XVI.
In February 1867, they went to Sydney to begin an intercolonial and overseas tour. Aware of the tour&#x27;s lucrative potential, New South Wales captain Charles Lawrence sought to work his way into the team, first by inviting them to stay at his Manly Beach hotel. When they played against his club at the Albert Ground in Redfern, policemen brought the game to an abrupt halt by entering the field and arresting Wills. He and W. E. B. Gurnett, the tour promoter, had been vying to take over as manager, and Wills ended up in Darlinghurst Gaol for a breach of contract. Within days of his release in March, Gurnett embezzled some of the funds and left the team stranded in Sydney, dashing any hopes of a trip overseas and confirming Wills&#x27; suspicion that he was a con artist. Lawrence set up a &quot;benefit&quot; match for the team and joined them on their travels outside Sydney. By the end of the New South Wales leg of the tour, he had usurped Wills as captain.

No longer attracting significant crowds or media attention, they returned to the Western District in May; Lawrence stayed with the team while Wills went to Geelong to play football. It has been said that, due to his drinking habit, Wills exercised a &quot;bad influence&quot; upon the players, four of whom died from illness during or soon after the tour; the inquest into one death, that of Watty (Bilvayarrimin), and a follow-up police report found evidence of alcohol abuse among the players.

The surviving members formed part of the Aboriginal XI which Lawrence took to England in 1868, making it the first Australian sports team to travel overseas. Wills resented Lawrence for reviving the team without him; his exclusion from the landmark tour has been called the tragedy of his sporting career.

==Ambiguous professional==

Without career prospects beyond sport, Wills joined the MCC as a professional at the start of the 1867–68 season; however, he was not openly referred to as such. Instead, the club devised the title of &#x27;tutor&#x27; in order that he maintain the prestige of his amateur background.

Played on the MCG, the December 1867 intercolonial between Victoria and New South Wales ended in a sound victory for the former, principally due to Wills&#x27; nine-wicket haul and Richard Wardill&#x27;s century. Wills had been Victoria&#x27;s preferred captain for over a decade. Writing in his sports column, Hammersley claimed that, as a paid cricketer, Wills lacked &quot;moral ascendancy&quot; over amateurs. When he lost the captaincy to Wardill, an amateur, on the eve of the March 1869 match against New South Wales, he refused to play under him, or, indeed, anyone else. The Victorians condemned Wills and resolved to go on without him, after which he retracted his decision not to play. This was the last intercolonial played on the Domain and Victoria recovered from Wardill&#x27;s diamond duck to win by 78 runs. Wills scalped 7 wickets in a single innings.

After the intercolonial, Wills announced that he would not play for Victoria again, even if the colony wanted him. He planned to return to Cullin-la-ringo in early 1869, but his mother, still &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; with him, requested that he stay away from the station. The MCC took him back and he continued to act as a tutor with the club. Wills&#x27; former Aboriginal teammates, Mullagh and Cuzens, joined him at the MCC as paid bowlers.

Wills&#x27; physical appearance had deteriorated; gaining weight, balding and generally unkempt, with &quot;an alcoholic blush of his cheeks&quot;, he looked older than his years. Describing his body as &quot;stiff&quot; during a cricket match in 1870, he hinted, for the first time, that his talent was fading. Nevertheless, his reputation as Australia&#x27;s preeminent cricketer remained intact, with one journalist writing:

==No-ball plot and downfall==
Hardly a year had passed since Wills&#x27; return to Australia in 1856 without public comment on his suspect bowling action. Such comments increased as he aged and turned professional, and by 1870, many former allies that had once colluded to protect him, including journalists and officials, accused him of deliberately throwing. Wills&#x27; fame and influence helped make him a &quot;convenient caricature&quot; of the cricketing villain, one that, his critics urged, ought to be no-balled for the good of the game in the colonies.

In February 1870 at the MCG, Wills captained Victoria to a 265-run win over a New South Wales side featuring Twopenny (Jarrawuk), an Aboriginal paceman allegedly recruited by Lawrence as a foil to Wills&#x27; &quot;chucks&quot;. Comparing the two, the Melbourne press surmised: &quot;Undoubtedly Wills throws sometimes, but there is some decency about it, some disguise.&quot; In March, Victoria trounced a Tasmanian XVI in Launceston under Wills&#x27; leadership, though not without criticism of his bowling action. Amid accusations that Wills had incited a &quot;plague&quot; of throwing in Australia, one-time ally Hammersley, now Melbourne&#x27;s foremost sportswriter, emerged as his harshest critic. He accused Wills of resorting to throwing to maintain pace as he aged, and criticised him for introducing a type of bouncer designed to injure and intimidate batsmen. &quot;The Australasian&quot;, Hammersley&#x27;s newspaper, summarised Wills&#x27; modus operandi: &quot;If I cannot hit your wicket or make you give a chance soon, I&#x27;ll hit you and hurt you if I can. I&#x27;ll frighten you out.&quot;

In the face of a looming crisis in his career, Wills admitted to throwing in his 1870–71 &quot;Australian Cricketers&#x27; Guide&quot;, and in so doing taunted his enemies to stop him. Nonetheless, he went on to captain Victoria in the March 1871 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Albert Ground. Wills&#x27; first innings top score of 39* was offset by his drunken behaviour in the field, and he seemed reluctant to bowl for fear of being called. Victoria won by 48 runs. Not long after, Wills was no-balled for throwing for the first time in a club match. Rumour soon spread that the opposing club&#x27;s owner had conspired with the umpire against Wills.

A series of superb club cricket performances in February 1872—including a single innings ten-wicket haul for 9 runs against St Kilda—removed any doubt that Wills would play for Victoria in the next intercolonial against New South Wales, scheduled for March on the MCG. Before the game, representatives from both colonies met and entered into a bilateral agreement designed to call Wills. When he opened the bowling, Wills became the first cricketer to be called for throwing in a top-class Australian match. The umpire called him two more times in two overs, and he did not bowl again. He was again no-balled when a Victorian side under his captaincy lost to a combined XIII from New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia late in 1872.

Hammersley had seemingly triumphed in his campaign to have Wills banned from intercolonial cricket. In an exchange of personal attacks in the press, Wills implied that Hammersley was an architect of the no-ball plot, and protested that he and other English colonists were out to oppress native-born Australians. Wills went on to threaten him with legal action. Hammersley closed:
==Grace and comeback attempt==

W. G. Grace, the Victorian era&#x27;s most famous cricketer, brought an English team to Australia in 1873–74. Wills strove to play for Victoria against Grace and rival factions fought over his possible inclusion. Hammersley, a selector, ensured that he missed out. Wills went on to tour with, and play against the Englishmen. Irked by Wills&#x27; constant presence, Grace remarked that he seemed to regard himself as a representative of the whole of Australia. It was assumed that, on his homeward journey, Grace would play a final match in the South Australian capital of Adelaide, but he bypassed the city when Kadina, a remote mining town in the Copper Triangle, offered him more money. Wills coached Kadina&#x27;s miners and captained them against Grace&#x27;s XI. Played in an open, rock-strewn plain of baked earth, the game was deemed a farce. Wills made a pair and Grace later wrote of the &quot;old Rugbeian&quot; as a has-been. Grace neglected to mention that Wills bowled him, ending with 6/28.

In Geelong, Wills was still idolised, though he seemed discontented, seeking any chance to earn money through cricket in the major cities. He maintained an interest in the development of football, what he called &quot;the king of games&quot;. He continued to suggest rule changes, such as the push in the back rule to curb injuries, and, as captain of Geelong, helped shape the sport&#x27;s playing style. Utilising the speed and skill of Geelong&#x27;s young players, Wills devised an innovative game plan—what he called &quot;scientific football&quot;—based on passing and running into open space. He pioneered another tactical manoeuvre in Ballarat by ordering his men to flood the backline to prevent the home side from scoring. Having enraged the crowd, he and his men incited them further by wasting time and deliberately kicking the ball out of bounds. A few years later, in a rare act of diplomacy, Wills quelled tensions after a rival club used his &quot;unchivalrous tactics&quot; against Geelong. He played his last football game in 1874.
In April 1874, Australia&#x27;s first organised women&#x27;s cricket match took place in Bendigo, Victoria between two local sides, in aid of charity. One year later, they made offers to play in Melbourne, but these were declined amid abuse from the city&#x27;s press, with one journalist stating: &quot;Public sentiment appears to be so far from approving it, that the eccentric example of the [Bendigo team] is not likely to be followed elsewhere.&quot; In response, and as secretary of Corio, Wills invited the team to play in Geelong. He was the only person in the colonies to extend such an invitation, and attempted to organise a local women&#x27;s team to play them. Due to poor weather, the match was postponed until 1876, but by then, the Bendigo side had folded. Another decade would pass before women&#x27;s cricket gained traction and recognition in Australia.

After Wills&#x27; ejection from top-class cricket in 1872, the Victoria XI suffered three straight losses against New South Wales. In his 1874–75 &quot;Australian Cricketers&#x27; Guide&quot;, Wills argued that Victoria needed a new captain. &quot;No one reading his words could mistake its intent—what Victoria needed was Tom Wills&quot;, writes de Moore. For the first time in years, Wills was shortlisted by Victorian selectors to appear in the next intercolonial against New South Wales. Noting his faded skills and sullied reputation, the Melbourne press lamented, &quot;There is some sentimental notion afloat that as a captain he is peerless.&quot; Pessimism gave way to hope as Wills promised to restore the colony&#x27;s glory, and in February 1876 he led the Victoria XI onto the Albert Ground. Batting last in the order, he went for 0 and 4 and failed to take a wicket despite bowling the most overs of his side. The media blamed him for Victoria&#x27;s 195-run loss. In turn, he blamed his teammates.

==Final years==
By 1877, Wills&#x27; cricket career &quot;had become a series of petty disputes in petty games&quot; of &quot;ever-deteriorating standards.&quot; No longer an office-bearer with Corio, he moved amongst lower-level clubs in the Geelong area, earning scraps of money wherever he could. In a brief postscript to one of several rejected applications for employment at the MCC, Wills wrote of old cricketers being &quot;left in the cold&quot;. De Moore interpreted it as an &quot;unmistakable backhander for the club&quot;. He continues: &quot;To see Wills simply as a beggar would be to misunderstand him.&quot;
After retiring as a footballer, Wills turned to umpiring and committee work, and despite his continued slide into debt, donated money and trophies for football competitions. He served as Geelong&#x27;s vice-president from 1873 to 1876, and briefly as club delegate after the 1877 formation of the Victorian Football Association (VFA), but was dropped for unknown reasons. During the 1878 VFA season, he acted as central umpire, and defended his adjudication of a June match between Carlton and Albert Park in what would be his last public letter. That year, Wills, broke and hounded by creditors, began selling land in Geelong to help clear his debt, and moved with Barbor to South Melbourne. He held no positions of power at the South Melbourne Cricket Club and only occasionally appeared in local team lists. He did however convince the club to open its ground to football in winter as a means of improving the turf&#x27;s durability. Other clubs soon followed South Melbourne&#x27;s example as football adapted to an oval-shaped field in the late 1870s. By this stage, the sport had spread throughout Australasia with Melbourne matches attracting the world&#x27;s largest football crowds yet seen.

In late 1878, the MCC rejected Wills&#x27; last application for employment, and his dwindling income from cricket was &quot;finally asphyxiated&quot;. From February 1879 onwards, Wills lived with Barbor in Heidelberg, a small village on the margins of Melbourne. Although his life that year went largely unrecorded, he is known to have made only two trips outside of Heidelberg; on one of these, in January 1880, Tom Horan spotted him in the crowd at the MCG during an intercolonial between Victoria and New South Wales. His alcoholism worsened over this period, as did Barbor&#x27;s, also a heavy drinker. He occasionally coached the Heidelberg Cricket Club, its members composed mostly of farmers. On 13 March 1880, he played for the side against the Bohemians—a &quot;travelling circus&quot; of wealthy amateurs—in his last game. Wills took five wickets, his &quot;chucks&quot; working &quot;sweetly&quot; on the rough pitch. In his last surviving letters, sent two days later to his brothers on Cullin-la-ringo, he wrote that he felt &quot;out of the world&quot; in Heidelberg, and fantasised about escaping to Tasmania. Begging for money to help pay off debts, he promised, &quot;I will not trouble any of you again&quot;.

===Suicide===

Isolated and estranged from most of his family, Wills had become, in the words of cricket historian David Frith, &quot;a complete and dangerous and apparently incurable alcoholic&quot;. Oft-repeated stories that Wills ended up in gaol or at Kew Asylum near the end of his life are not supported by substantive evidence. He and Barbor abruptly stopped drinking on 28 April 1880; it is presumed that they ran out of money to buy more alcohol. Two days later, Wills started to show signs of alcohol withdrawal, and on 1 May, Barbor, fearing that a calamity was at hand, admitted him to the Melbourne Hospital, where a physician treated him for delirium tremens. Later that night, Wills absconded, returned home and the next day, in the grip of paranoid delusions, committed suicide by stabbing a pair of scissors into his heart three times. The inquest, on 3 May, presided over by coroner Richard Youl, found that Wills &quot;killed himself when of unsound mind from excessive drinking&quot;.

His burial took place the next day in an unmarked grave in Heidelberg Cemetery at a private funeral attended by only six people: his brother Egbert, sister Emily and cousin Harrison; Harrison&#x27;s sister Adela and her son Amos; and cricketer Verney Cameron, who later ran an unsuccessful fundraiser for a tombstone over the grave. When asked by a journalist about her late son, Elizabeth Wills denied that Tom ever existed, and, according to family lore, she never spoke of him again.

==Personality==
Wills struck his contemporaries as peculiar and at times narcissistic, with a prickly temperament, but also kind, charismatic and companionable. Often embroiled in controversy, he seemed to lack an understanding of how his words and actions could repeatedly get him into trouble. His obsession with sport was such that he showed little interest in anything else. Through his research, journalist Martin Flanagan concluded that Wills was &quot;utterly bereft of insight into himself&quot;, and football historian Gillian Hibbins described him as &quot;an overbearing and undisciplined young man who tended to blame others for his troubles and was more interested in winning a game than in respecting sporting rules.&quot; Wills&#x27; family and peers, though angered by his misbehaviour, frequently forgave him. It seems unlikely that he sought popular favour, but his strong egalitarian streak helped make him a folk hero. This widespread affection for him, coupled with an understanding of his waywardness, found expression in colonial mottoes and drinking songs, one sung in part: &quot;I have a weakness, I confess — it is for Tommy Wills&quot;.

While his manner of speech was breezy and laconic, Wills, as a young adult back in Australia, developed a peculiar stream of consciousness style of writing that sometimes defied syntax and grammar. His letters are laced with puns, oblique classical and Shakespearean allusions, and droll asides, such as this one about Melbourne in a letter to his brother Cedric: &quot;Everything is dull here, but people are kept alive by people getting shot at in the streets&quot;. The overall impression is one of &quot;a mind full of energy and histrionic ideas without a centre&quot;.
In one of his borderline &quot;thought disordered&quot; letters, it is evident that at times he entered a state of depersonalisation: &quot;I do not know what I am standing on ... when anyone speaks to me I cannot for the life of me make out what they are talking about—everything seems so curious.&quot; In 1884, Hammersley compared Wills&#x27; incipient madness and fiery glare to that of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the Australian bush poet. Wills&#x27; mental instability is a source for speculation: epilepsy has been suggested as a possible cause of his perplexed mental state, and a variant of bipolar illness may account for his disjointed thinking and flowery, confused writings.

In 1923, the MCC discovered Wills&#x27; old cricket cap and put it on display in the Block Arcade, prompting Horace Wills to reflect: &quot;My brother was the nicest man I ever met. Though his nature was care-free, amounting almost to wildness, he had the sweetest temper I have seen in a man, and was essentially a sportsman.&quot;

==Playing style and captaincy==
Wills is regarded as Australia&#x27;s first outstanding cricketer. &quot;The picture of the athlete&quot; in his prime, &quot;full to overflowing with animal vigor&quot;, Wills seemed indestructible. Match reports refer to him as a Triton, a Colossus, &quot;and many other things besides a cricketer&quot;. Intensely competitive, his win-at-all-costs mentality undermined the amateur ideal of friendly competition, as did his strategic use of intimidation. A natural leader, his supreme confidence emboldened those around him, and he never despaired the fortunes of his side, even in the face of probable defeat. On the off-chance that he sought another player&#x27;s opinion, he invariably followed his own mind, and his resources at any critical juncture in a match were said to be always clever, and sometimes unique. &quot;As a judge of the game he never had a superior&quot;, wrote Britain&#x27;s &quot;The Sportsman&quot;. He was &quot;at once a cricket crank and genius&quot;, according to &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. The rarity of Wills&#x27; genius drew comparisons to William Shakespeare&#x27;s.
Classified as an all-rounder, Wills saw himself principally as a bowler. With a repertoire spanning &quot;sparklers, rippers, fizzers, trimmers and shooters&quot;, he varied his pace and style in order to quickly work out a batsman&#x27;s weak points. Noted for his deceptive slow deliveries, dropping mid-flight and big on break, Wills&#x27; fast round arm balls sometimes reared head-high from the pitch, terrorising his opponent. His bowling was said to have &quot;the devil&quot; in it at times; English batsman Sir David Serjeant remembered Wills as the only bowler he ever feared. In order to avoid being no-balled for throwing, Wills carefully studied the umpire, and developed various tricks, such as worrying aloud that he might be overstepping the crease at the point of delivery. With the umpire&#x27;s attention diverted to his feet, Wills would &quot;let go a throw for all he was worth&quot;. His most flagrant throws were likened to that of a baseball pitcher.

As a batsman, Wills was an unapologetic stonewaller with a &quot;peculiarly ugly&quot; style; his characteristic shots—cuts and to the leg side—ensured the primacy of defence. He summarised his technique thus: &quot;The ball can&#x27;t get through the bat.&quot; He could also abruptly turn explosive and, according to one sportswriter, hit as hard as Tom Sayers. On one occasion at the MCG, he made a drive into the Richmond Paddock for eight runs. An outstanding fieldsman anywhere, Wills excelled in the slips and ran out batsmen with deadly accurate throwing.

Wills was a &quot;tear-away&quot; footballer whose &quot;pluck and skill&quot;, it was said, only George O&#x27;Mullane matched. The longest drop kick in Victoria, he was an elusive dodger, as at Rugby, and excelled in different positions, moving from a follower and goal-scorer in the ruck to full back. Of the early footballers, Wills was appraised as the greatest, most astute captain, and is credited with opening up the Australian game to new tactics and skills and a more free-flowing style of play. In July 1860—in what the press called a &quot;coup de main&quot;, and what has since been regarded as a &quot;tactical leap&quot; that foreshadowed modern football—Wills breached the era&#x27;s notional offside line by positioning his Richmond men down the field from defence to attack. By a series of short kick passes, they succeeded in scoring. That same month, captaining Melbourne to victory, he pioneered a rudimentary form of flooding; and, in another win for the club, exploited the low player turnout by instructing his men to dart with the ball in open spaces. In his season-by-season ranking of players, early football historian C. C. Mullen named Wills &quot;Champion of the Colony&quot; five times. Historian Bernard Whimpress called Wills an innovator who &quot;would fit easily into today&#x27;s game&quot;. Historian Geoffrey Blainey writes: &quot;How many of the tricks and stratagems of the early years came from this clever tactician we will never know.&quot;

==Legacy==
Australia&#x27;s first celebrity sportsman, Wills began to fade from public consciousness within his own lifetime. His dark reputation and suicide, and his links to convictism and frontier violence—sources of cultural cringe—have been posited as reasons for his descent into obscurity. Academic Barry Judd called him &quot;a ghost inhabiting the margins of written history&quot;. Coinciding with a revival of interest in Australia&#x27;s colonial past, Wills has risen &quot;almost to a vogue&quot;, and is seen as a forerunner of today&#x27;s self-destructive star athletes, some of those qualities that alienated his peers &quot;being less shocking to a generation that likes its heroes flawed&quot;. The subject of scholarly, literary and artistic works, his story has been likened to Ned Kelly&#x27;s as a powerful and quintessentially Australian narrative, and in 2006, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; named him as one of the 100 most influential Australians. After several attempts by different authors since the 1930s, a comprehensive biography was published in 2008, Greg de Moore&#x27;s &quot;Tom Wills: First Wild Man of Australian Sport&quot;.

Wills&#x27; unmarked gravesite was restored in 1980 with a headstone erected by the MCC using public funds. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1989 and became an inaugural member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996. The Tom Wills Room in the MCG&#x27;s Shane Warne Stand serves as a venue for corporate functions. A statue outside the MCG, sculpted by Louis Laumen and erected in 2001, depicts Wills umpiring the famous 1858 football match between Melbourne Grammar and Scotch College. The AFL commemorated the 150th anniversary of the match by staging the Tom Wills Round during the 2008 AFL Season. The two schools played in a curtain raiser at the MCG ahead of the round opener between Melbourne and Geelong. That same year, Victoria&#x27;s busiest freeway interchange, the Monash–EastLink interchange in Dandenong North, was named the Tom Wills Interchange. Tom Wills Oval, inaugurated in 2013 at Sydney Olympic Park, serves as the training base for the AFL&#x27;s Greater Western Sydney Giants.

===Marngrook theory===
Since the 1980s, it has been suggested that Wills played or observed an Aboriginal football game, Marngrook, as a child growing up in the Grampians among the Djab wurrung, and incorporated some of its features into early Australian football. The theory has provoked intense debate, amounting to a controversy dubbed &quot;football&#x27;s history wars&quot;. In her essay &quot;A Seductive Myth&quot;, published in the AFL&#x27;s &quot;The Australian Game of Football Since 1858&quot; (2008), Hibbins calls the proposed link an &quot;emotional belief&quot; lacking &quot;any intellectual credibility&quot;. She points out that neither Wills nor any of his fellow football founders mention Aboriginal games in existing documents, and states that there is no evidence of Marngrook being played in the vicinity where Wills grew up. Since then, among the personal papers of ethnographer Alfred William Howitt, an interview has been found with a Mukjarrawaint man who recalls playing Marngrook in the Grampians. Also, in his first-hand account of Aboriginal games, James Dawson, an Aboriginal rights activist, records the Djab wurrung word for football as &quot;Min&#x27;gorm&quot;. De Moore therefore argues that Marngrook was likely played around where Wills lived as a boy, &quot;or, at the very least, that the local Aboriginal people knew of such a game&quot;. That Wills knew of Marngrook, he adds, is speculative at best.

Proponents of a link point to the games&#x27; similarities, such as drop punting the ball and leaping, catching feats. Academics Jenny Hocking and Nell Reidy write that Wills, in adapting football to Melbourne&#x27;s parklands, wanted a game that kept the players off the ground and the ball in the air. &quot;It is here&quot;, they argue, &quot;in the interstices between rugby and Australian football, that the influence of [Marngrook] can be seen most clearly&quot;. Historian John Hirst countered that early Australian football was aligned with rugby-style roots, and bore little resemblance to Marngrook. According to de Moore, Wills was &quot;almost solely influenced&quot; by Rugby School football, with local conditions also having an effect.

Flanagan promoted the Marngrook theory in his novel &quot;The Call&quot; (1996), an historical imagining into Wills&#x27; life, and argued in an essay addressed to Wills that he must have known Aboriginal games as it was in his nature to play: &quot;There&#x27;s two things about you everybody seems to have agreed on—you&#x27;d drink with anyone and you&#x27;d play with anyone.&quot; He quotes Lawton Wills Cooke, a descendant of Horace Wills (Tom&#x27;s brother), who said a family story had been passed down about Tom playing Marngrook as a boy. Family historian T. S. Wills Cooke disputed that such a story existed, calling the Marngrook link &quot;a bridge too far&quot; and an example of historical revisionism motivated by political correctness. Despite lacking in hard evidence, the theory is often presented as factual. In Moyston, the self-proclaimed birthplace of Australian football, stands an AFL-endorsed monument, unveiled by historian Col Hutchinson, commemorating Wills&#x27; childhood in the area playing Marngrook.

===The &quot;father of football&quot;===

The role that Wills and others played in pioneering Australian football went largely unrecognised in their lifetimes, as the sport had yet to develop a historical perspective. By the late 1870s, Wills&#x27; 1858 letter calling for the organisation and codification of football was singled out as a seminal document. He wrote at this time that he attempted to promote football in Victoria as early as 1857, &quot;but it was not taken to kindly until the following year&quot;. By 1908, the year of Australian football&#x27;s jubilee celebrations, H. C. A. Harrison had become known as the &quot;father of football&quot; on account of his substantial reputation on and off the field. Wills was the next most often recalled pioneer during this period, and Harrison credited him with initiating the sport when he &quot;recommended that we Australians should work out a game of our own.&quot; More recent historiography has shown that while Harrison played a pivotal role over a long period, he did not co-write the first rules in 1859, nor did he play in the 1858 games. With this correction, a number of historians elevated Wills to a position of pre-eminence, variously calling him the game&#x27;s founder, father or inventor. Blainey said of Wills: &quot;It is far too much to say that he founded the game, but it would be too little to say that he was simply one among many founders.&quot;

It is often said that, due to his suicide, Wills was written out of the game&#x27;s history, or at the very least downplayed as an important figure. De Moore rejects this view, noting that the contributions of Hammersley, Smith, Thompson and other pioneers, rather than those of Wills, were generally overlooked. In her analysis of early football, Hibbins concludes that Thompson&#x27;s journalistic ability as a promoter of the game &quot;probably&quot; makes him the most significant pioneer, and that the importance of Wills&#x27; role has been overemphasised. Echoing Hibbins&#x27; arguments, Roy Hay writes that Wills, while a &quot;catalyst&quot; for football, was &quot;much more interested in playing and performing than in organising&quot;. British historian Tony Collins even compared Wills to William Webb Ellis and Abner Doubleday, the apocryphal inventors of rugby and baseball, respectively. In response to Collins&#x27; suggestion that Wills &quot;quickly faded from the footballing scene&quot;, journalist James Coventry highlighted his seventeen-year playing career (by far the longest of the pioneers), the influence he wielded as captain-coach of various clubs for much of that time, and his administrative work. He concludes that Collins and other scholars have &quot;perversely&quot; devalued Wills&#x27; real contributions &quot;in their rush to discredit [the Marngrook theory]&quot;.

==Footnotes==
a. Wills&#x27; birthplace is a matter of some conjecture as there is a lack of reliable archival information on the subject, and the precise whereabouts of his parents are difficult to pinpoint during the period around 1835. Molonglo is given as his birthplace in an in which the author states that Wills had given him notes on his life. A common alternative is Parramatta in modern-day Sydney. When Victorians claimed Wills as one of theirs, he liked to boast that he was a &quot;Sydney man&quot;—a reference to the colony of his birth.

b. Tom had eight siblings: Emily Spencer Wills (1842–1925), Cedric Spencer Wills (1844–1914), Horace Spencer Wills (1847–1928), Egbert Spencer Wills (1849–1931), Elizabeth Spencer Wills (1852–1930), Eugenie Spencer Wills (1854–1937), Minna Spencer Wills (1856–1943) and Hortense Sarah Spencer Wills (1861–1907).

c. Wills and H. C. A. Harrison shared Sarah Howe as a grandmother. Harrison was born ten months after Wills in New South Wales and as a young boy overlanded to the Port Phillip District, where he often visited the Wills family at Lexington. They became brothers-in-law in 1864 when Harrison married Emily Wills.

d. The Aboriginal men went by sobriquets given to them by their European employers in the Western District. In Mullagh&#x27;s case, he was named after the station where he worked.

e. This story was related in the following piece of Wills family oral history: &quot;Elizabeth Wills refused to attend [the funeral] nor would she acknowledge Tom after his death as she was very religious and considered [suicide] a great sin. ... A reporter asked Elizabeth about her son. &#x27;Which son?&#x27; she asked. &#x27;Thomas&#x27; said the reporter. &#x27;I have no son called Thomas&#x27; was the old lady&#x27;s reply&quot;.

f. Gordon suffered a demise similar to that of Wills, committing suicide in 1870. He describes Wills as a fearsome bowler in his 1865 long poem &quot;Ye Wearie Wayfarer&quot;.

g. Each Indigenous language group played its own variant of football and with its own name. &quot;Marngrook&quot;, from the Gunditjmara language, is used as a generic term for Aboriginal football.

<doc id="803263" wikidata="Q707929" url="?curid=803263" title="J. P. Guilford">
<text>Joy Paul Guilford (March 7, 1897 – November 26, 1987) was an American psychologist best known for his psychometric study of human intelligence, including the distinction between convergent and divergent production.

Developing the views of L. L. Thurstone, Guilford rejected Charles Spearman&#x27;s view that intelligence could be characterized in a single numerical parameter. He proposed that three dimensions were necessary for accurate description: operations, content, and products. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Guilford as the 27th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

== Career ==
Guilford graduated from the University of Nebraska before studying under Edward Titchener at Cornell. Guilford was elected a member of the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 1937, and in 1938 he became the third president of the Psychometric Society, following in the footsteps of its founder Louis Leon Thurstone and of Edward Thorndike, who held the position in 1937. Guilford held a number of posts at Nebraska and briefly at the University of Southern California. In 1941 he entered the U.S. Army as a Lieutenant Colonel and served as Director of Psychological Research Unit No. 3 at Santa Ana Army Air Base. There he worked on the selection and ranking of aircrew trainees as the Army Air Force investigated why a sizable proportion of trainees were not graduating.

Promoted to Chief of the Psychological Research Unit at the U.S. Army Air Forces Training Command Headquarters in Fort Worth, Guilford oversaw the Stanine (Standard Nine) Project in 1943, which identified nine specific intellectual abilities crucial to flying a plane. (&quot;Stanines&quot;, now a common term in educational psychology, was coined during Guilford&#x27;s project). Over the course of World War II, Guilford&#x27;s use of these factors in the development of the two-day Classification Test Battery was significant in increasing graduation rates for aircrew trainees.

Discharged as a full colonel after the war, Guilford joined the Education faculty at the University of Southern California and continued to research the factors of intelligence. He published widely on what he ultimately named the Structure of Intellect theory, and his post-War research identified a total of 90 discrete intellectual abilities and 30 behavioral abilities.

Guilford&#x27;s 20 years of research at Southern California were funded by the National Science Foundation, the Office of Education of the former Health, Education and Welfare Department, and the Office of Naval Research. Although Guilford&#x27;s subjects were recruits at the Air Force Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, the Office of Naval Research managed this research.

Guilford&#x27;s post-war research led to the development of classification testing that, modified in different ways, entered into the various personnel assessments administered by all branches of the U.S. Armed Services. So generally speaking, all U.S. Military qualifying exams of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s descended from Guilford&#x27;s research.

== Structure of Intellect theory==
According to Guilford&#x27;s Structure of Intellect (SI) theory (1955), an individual&#x27;s performance on intelligence tests can be traced back to the underlying mental abilities or factors of intelligence. SI theory comprises up to 180 different intellectual abilities organized along three dimensions: operations, content, and products.

The Structure of Intellect Theory advanced by Guilford was applied by Mary N. Meeker for educational purposes.

=== Operations dimension ===
SI includes six operations or general intellectual processes:
#Cognition - The ability to understand, comprehend, discover, and become aware of information
#Memory recording - The ability to encode information
#Memory retention - The ability to recall information
#Divergent production - The ability to generate multiple solutions to a problem; creativity
#Convergent production - The ability to deduce a single solution to a problem; rule-following or problem-solving
#Evaluation - The ability to judge whether or not information is accurate, consistent, or valid

=== Content dimension ===
SI includes four broad areas of information to which the human intellect applies the six operations:

#Figural - Concrete, real world information, tangible objects, things in the environment - It includes A. visual: information perceived through sight, B. auditory: information perceived through hearing, and C. kinesthetic: information perceived through one&#x27;s own physical actions
#Symbolic - Information perceived as symbols or signs that stand for something else, e.g., Arabic numerals, the letters of an alphabet, or musical and scientific notations
#Semantic - Concerned with verbal meaning and ideas - Generally considered to be abstract in nature.
#Behavioral - Information perceived as acts of people (This dimension was not fully researched in Guilford&#x27;s project. It remains theoretical and is generally not included in the final model that he proposed for describing human intelligence.)

=== Product dimension ===
As the name suggests, this dimension contains results of applying particular operations to specific contents. The SI model includes six products in increasing complexity:
#Units - Single items of knowledge
#Classes - Sets of units sharing common attributes
#Relations - Units linked as opposites or in associations, sequences, or analogies
#Systems - Multiple relations interrelated to comprise structures or networks
#Transformations - Changes, perspectives, conversions, or mutations to knowledge
#Implications - Predictions, inferences, consequences, or anticipations of knowledge

Therefore, according to Guilford there are 5 x 5 x 6 = 150 intellectual abilities or factors (his research only confirmed about three behavioral abilities, so it is generally not included in the model). Each ability stands for a particular operation in a particular content area and results in a specific product, such as Comprehension of Figural Units or Evaluation of Semantic Implications.

Guilford&#x27;s original model was composed of 120 components (when the behavioral component is included) because he had not separated Figural Content into separate Auditory and Visual contents, nor had he separated Memory into Memory Recording and Memory Retention. When he separated Figural into Auditory and Visual contents, his model increased to 5 x 5 x 6 = 150 categories. When Guilford separated the memory functions, his model finally increased to 180 factors.

== Criticism ==

Various researchers have criticized the statistical techniques used by Guilford. According to Jensen (1998), Guilford&#x27;s contention that a &quot;g&quot;-factor was untenable was influenced by his observation that cognitive tests of U.S. Air Force personnel did not show correlations significantly different from zero. According to one reanalysis, this resulted from artifacts and methodological errors. Applying more robust methodologies, the correlations in Guilford&#x27;s data sets are positive. In another reanalysis, randomly generated models were found to be as well supported as Guilford&#x27;s own theory.

Guilford&#x27;s Structure of Intellect model of human abilities has few supporters today. Carroll (1993) summarized the view of later researchers:

:&quot;Guilford&#x27;s SOI model must, therefore, be marked down as a somewhat eccentric aberration in the history of intelligence models. The fact that so much attention has been paid to it is disturbing to the extent that textbooks and other treatments of it have given the impression that the model is valid and widely accepted, when clearly it is not.&quot;

<text>Trevecca Nazarene University (TNU) is a private Nazarene liberal arts college in Nashville, Tennessee. It was founded in 1901.

==History==

TNU was founded in 1901 by Cumberland Presbyterian minister J. O. McClurkan as the &quot;Pentecostal Literary and Bible Training School&quot;. Part of the Pentecostal Alliance, it started offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 1910, and the school&#x27;s name was changed to Trevecca College for Christian Workers in 1911, after Trevecca College (now &quot;Coleg Trefeca&quot;) in Wales. The school was located in downtown Nashville until 1914, when it was moved to East Nashville on Gallatin Road. In 1917, the campus suffered a disastrous fire, and its students and faculty temporarily transferred to Ruskin Cave College. That same year, the school became an official college of the Church of the Nazarene, in order to save itself financially. Shortly after it had become a Nazarene institution, it absorbed the Southeastern Nazarene College of Georgia but still found itself in bankruptcy and forced to sell its campus by 1932.

After occupying a temporary space on the former campus of the defunct Walden University on White&#x27;s Creek, it was unable to buy the property and relocated to the Nashville First Church of the Nazarene, taking on the name Trevecca Nazarene College (TNC) in 1934. In 1935, the college moved back to its present location on Murfreesboro Pike in southeast Nashville, where it once again leased and then took over the 7-acre campus of Walden University in 1937. President A. B. Mackey bought an adjoining plot for himself and later transferred it to the college. It was first accredited in 1969 and began offering master&#x27;s degrees in 1984. In 1995, the school&#x27;s name was changed from Trevecca Nazarene College to Trevecca Nazarene University (TNU). In 1999, Trevecca offered its first doctoral degree (an Ed.D.), and in 2011, added its first Ph.D. degree (in clinical counseling).

On March 24, 2017, Trevecca announced a partnership with Eastern Nazarene College in Quincy, Massachusetts. At that time, Trevecca&#x27;s president, Dan Boone, was also announced as president-elect of Eastern Nazarene College. In March 2017, the boards of trustees of both institutions voted to approve a Memorandum of Understanding that would begin a three-year partnership exploring the possibility of an eventual merger. As the president of both institutions, Boone was to provide leadership and oversight for both Trevecca and ENC. Both were to retain separate boards of governance and continue to operate as independent institutions under their respective accrediting bodies. In March 2018, the proposed merger was called off.

Trevecca&#x27;s Presidents: J. O. MCClurkan (1901–1914), Dr. C. E. Hardy (1915–1919, 1920–1925, 1928–1936), Stephen S. White (1919–1920), John T. Benson (1925–1926), A. O. Hendricks (1926–1928), A.B. Mackey (1936–1963), W. M. Greathouse (1963–1968), Mark R. Moore (1968–1979), Homer J. Adams (1979–1991), Millard C. Reed (1991–2005), Dan Boone (2005–Present)

==Affiliation==
TNU is one of eight U.S. liberal arts colleges affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene. TNU is the college for the &quot;Southeast Region&quot; of the United States, comprising the Kentucky, MidSouth, East Tennessee, Alabama North, Alabama South, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Southern Florida districts, which include Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and part of Kentucky. Each college receives financial backing from the Nazarene churches in its region; part of each church budget is paid into a fund for its regional school. Each college or university is also bound by a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement not to physically recruit outside its respective &quot;educational region.&quot; TNU has been accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools since 1969.

==Campus==
Trevecca has a 90+ acre campus in an urban neighborhood environment, located 1.7 miles southeast of downtown Nashville. The campus of Trevecca Nazarene University is part of the Trevecca Community, which includes other entities that are adjacent to the campus: Trevecca Community Church of the Nazarene; Trevecca Towers, a Christian retirement community; and Trevecca Center for Rehabilitation and Healing, a nursing home/long-term care facility.

==Academics==
Trevecca is organized into six schools: the School of Arts and Sciences, the Skinner School of Business and Technology, Education, the Millard Reed School of Theology and Christian Ministry, the School of Music and Worship Arts, and the School of Graduate and Continuing Studies. Each of these schools is divided into departments. Most of the degrees offered by TNU are for traditional undergraduates; however, Trevecca offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 86 baccalaureate majors, two associate degree majors, 20 master&#x27;s degrees, two doctorates, and six certificate programs. The management and human relations degree is a non-traditional undergraduate degree for working adults. Programs for associate degrees, the master&#x27;s degrees, a doctor of philosophy degree, and a doctor of education degree are also available.

==Student life==
There were 3,000-plus students at the college in fall 2016, 1,374 of whom were traditional undergraduates. The undergraduate population has a 1:1.39 male to female ratio, as of fall 2016. As of the fall of 2016, undergraduates represented 43 states, 16 countries, and 28 religious affiliations. The majority of undergraduate students live on campus in residence halls or apartment-style housing.

Students participate in spiritual life activities throughout the school year and summers, including chapels three times a week (a number of which each semester are required for all undergraduates), local community service projects, mission trips both in the U.S. and around the world, small groups (each designed for specific types of spiritual growth and learning), and other spiritually formational activities.

Trevecca has organizations such as the Student Government Association that are in charge of planning and hosting many social life events. Events that have gained the most popularity among the student body include &quot;Friday Night Live&quot; (a rendition of the popular skit show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;), &quot;Trojan Idol&quot;, and the Songwriter&#x27;s Challenge.

In addition to SGA, TNU has a large number of student organizations and groups, including ministry-related clubs, service organizations, political and social interest clubs, and clubs or ensembles for many individual majors.

Trevecca has cooperative agreements with other local universities for programs not available directly through Trevecca, including the Army ROTC at Vanderbilt University, which offers a commission in the Army as well as a degree from Trevecca once the bachelor&#x27;s program at TNU and the ROTC program at Vanderbilt are both successfully completed. Trevecca and Vanderbilt also have a joint program allowing students interested in marching band to participate in the Vandy band during Vanderbilt&#x27;s football season. Through a 3-2 program with Vanderbilt University, students can obtain an applied physics degree at Trevecca. After completion of the program&#x27;s requirements (usually three years at Trevecca and one at Vanderbilt), Trevecca will award the student an applied physics degree. Upon completion of the requirements in the student&#x27;s chosen engineering discipline at Vanderbilt, that institution will award the student an engineering degree.

===Athletics===

Trevecca Nazarene is a member of NCAA Division II and primarily competes in the Gulf South Conference (GSC) since the 2024–25 academic year. They were previously a member of the Great Midwest Athletic Conference from 2012–2013 to 2023–2024 as well as the TranSouth Athletic Conference of the NAIA from 1996–1997 to 2011–2012. They compete in baseball, softball, STUNT, and women&#x27;s volleyball as well as men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams in each of these sports basketball, golf, soccer, cross country, and track. 

Some notable athletic accomplishments include the Trojan women&#x27;s basketball team reaching the NAIA Championship game in 2008. The 2021 Trojan baseball team reached the NCAA Division II College World Series in Cary, North Carolina.

<text>Boris Katz (born October 5, 1947) is a principal American research scientist (computer scientist) at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and head of the Laboratory&#x27;s InfoLab Group. His research interests include natural language processing and understanding, machine learning and intelligent information access. His brother Victor Kac is a mathematician at MIT.

He was able to get out of the USSR with the help of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, before the end of the Cold War.

Over the last several decades, Boris Katz has been developing the START natural language system that allows the user to access various types of information using English.

==Biography==
Boris Katz was born on October 5, 1947, in Chișinău in the family of Hersh Katz (died 1976) and Hayki (Klara) Landman (born 1921, Lipcani, Briceni District - died 2006, Cambridge, Middlesex County), who moved from Lipcani, a town located in the northern Bessarabian, to Chișinău before the war. He graduated from Moscow State University and in November 1978, he left for the United States thanks to the personal intervention of Senator Edward M. Kennedy. He defended his thesis as a candidate of physical and mathematical sciences in 1975 under the supervision of Evgenii M. Landis.

He currently lives in Boston and heads the InfoLabresearch team at the Laboratory of Informatics and Artificial Intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Boris Katz is the creator of the START information processing system (since 1993 - on the Internet), the author of several works in the field of processing, generation and perception of natural languages, machine learning, and accelerated access to multimedia information.

<doc id="803276" wikidata="Q1425384" url="?curid=803276" title="The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik-Yak">
<text>The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik-Yak (original title Gwendoline) is a 1984 French softcore action comedy film directed by Just Jaeckin, written by Jaeckin and John Willie and starring Tawny Kitaen and Brent Huff. The film is loosely based on the bondage-themed comics of Willie and on the character of Sweet Gwendoline. François Schuiten worked as a graphic designer for the film.

In the film, a mercenary rescues two kidnapped women. He is then hired as their guide in an expedition to obtain an elusive butterfly specimen.

== Plot ==
Captured by a trio of thieves at a Chinese port, Gwendoline (Kitaen), a courageous but naïve girl, is sold to a local casino-brothel owner, but after being rescued by Willard (Huff), a mercenary adventurer, she is reunited with her maid, Beth (Zabou), after the latter&#x27;s abduction by the same thieves who had earlier kidnapped Gwendoline. 

Hired to transport an illegal cargo, Willard reluctantly agrees to take both women with him after Beth, withholding information vital to his livelihood, promises to divulge it only if he becomes their guide. Gwendoline, who has come to China to capture the butterfly that eluded her father, who had staked his professional reputation as a scientist on obtaining the insect, offers Willard $2,000 to take her and Beth with him to the land of the Yik-Yak, in which the butterfly may be found.

After escaping from the cannibal tribe of Kiops, the trio find the butterfly, but as she is about to capture it, Beth is captured and Gwendoline and Willard must enter an all-women tribe&#x27;s underground lair to rescue the maid. The tribe is the vestige of the city of Pikaho, a primary diamond mining centre, which was swallowed by a volcanic eruption in the 12th century. Afterwards, the entire male population perished due to a disease spread by the eruption, and Pikaho turned into an all-women society considered nothing more than a legend. To ensure the survival of Pikaho, its Queen (Bernadette Lafont) allows a victor among them to mate with any man who visits or is captured by the tribe. Aided by Beth and the Queen&#x27;s henchman, D&#x27;Arcy (Jean Rougerie), Gwendoline, disguised as a Pikaho warrior, wins this right.

While Gwendoline and Willard make love before the Queen, D&#x27;Arcy activates the volcano and he, the Queen, and the citizens of Pikaho are killed as Gwendoline, Beth and Willard escape. In the process, Willard is able to capture the elusive butterfly.

<doc id="803277" wikidata="Q1066931" url="?curid=803277" title="Charlie Luken">
<text>Charles John Luken (born July 18, 1951) is an American politician of the Democratic party who was mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio, and served in the Ohio&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Luken, who is divorced, has three children. When Luken left office at the end of 2005, he was the longest serving mayor in Cincinnati&#x27;s history with 12 years and one month of service in that role.

== Education ==
Luken graduated from Purcell High School in Cincinnati, then earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Notre Dame (Indiana) in 1973. He then entered law school at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, earning his degree in 1976, after which he started practicing law.

== Early career ==
Rejected by the Democratic party as a successor to his uncle, Jim Luken, Luken first ran for the council as an independent, losing the at-large race in 1979. Luken served on the Cincinnati city council from 1981 to 1984, before becoming mayor. Luken served as mayor of Cincinnati from 1984 to 1990. In 1985 Luken sponsored an amendment to the City&#x27;s charter that made the leading vote-getter in the council race the City&#x27;s mayor. Under that system Luken was elected mayor in 1985, 1987 and 1989.

In 1990, Luken&#x27;s father, Tom Luken, a U.S. representative from Ohio, decided to retire. Charlie then ran for a seat in Ohio&#x27;s District 1 in the United States House of Representatives to replace his father. Luken won the election, defeating another former Cincinnati mayor, Ken Blackwell. Luken began serving in the U.S. House in 1991 (102nd Congress). He declined to run for re-election in 1992.

Returning from Washington, Luken served as a news anchor at WLWT-TV from 1993 to 1999, the same Cincinnati station where ex-mayor Jerry Springer and Luken&#x27;s father&#x27;s onetime political opponent Tom Atkins had worked as news anchors. One of Luken&#x27;s colleagues was future political opponent Courtis Fuller. In that role, Luken&#x27;s newscasts at WLW-TV were awarded best newscast in Ohio on two occasions.

== Cincinnati&#x27;s first &quot;strong mayor&quot; ==
After a change in the Cincinnati city charter that made the mayoralty a separately-elected office and established a &quot;strong-mayor&quot; form of government, Luken returned to politics. In 1999, he again took over the office of mayor of Cincinnati. In his first return term as mayor, Luken had to deal with the 2001 Cincinnati Riots resulting from perceived racism on the part of city police, as evidenced by a pattern of racial profiling and the shooting deaths of several unarmed black men.

In 2001, Luken won a second term against his former co-anchor Fuller (a Democrat running as a Charterite).

Fuller, a popular black anchorman for a local network station, was running at the same time Cincinnati was still dealing with the fallout of the riots, the racial discord highlighted by the continuing Cincinnati boycott by black celebrities and national organizations. The Hamilton County, Ohio, Board of Elections initially questioned the validity of Fuller&#x27;s campaign because he had moved into the city only just before declaring his candidacy. Luken, however, discouraged the board from its inquiry, stating that it would be bad for the city if he had no opponent for re-election, as the Republican party had failed to field a candidate for the office of mayor. Fuller beat Luken by 54-38 percent in the nonpartisan primary held September 11, 2001. However, the infamous terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., that happened the day of the primary overshadowed Fuller&#x27;s victory.

In the general election, Luken managed to beat Fuller. Luken&#x27;s margin was slightly over 10 percent, meaning an 18 point primary defeat was reversed into a 10 percent victory for Luken in just eight weeks. The voting followed race lines, with Fuller receiving 78 percent of the vote in predominantly black voting wards, while Luken received approximately 80 percent of the votes in predominantly white wards. With more whites than blacks in Cincinnati, this racial split gave Luken the win.

== Withdrawal from politics ==
In August 2004, Luken announced he would not seek re-election to a third term. In September 2004, he briefly flirted with running for Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney as a write-in candidate because scandal plagued incumbent Michael K. Allen had no opponent. Luken reactivated his dormant law license but ultimately decided not to run.

The election race for his successor was narrowed down to two candidates after the primary run: first-term councilman David Pepper (son of John Pepper, former CEO of Procter &amp; Gamble) and Mark Mallory, a member of the state Senate. With the previous election following the city&#x27;s racial divides so closely, the race of the candidates — Pepper is white, Mallory is black — was considered significant. Both candidates were members of the Ohio Democratic Party.
Mallory was elected Luken&#x27;s successor on November 8, 2005.

A few days after the riots in April of 2001, Luken requested the United States Justice Department review the policies and practices of The Cincinnati Police Department. The result was The Cincinnati Collaborative Agreement, a wide ranging change in police policies and practices that has become a national model of community engagement in policing.

In 2004 Luken founded the nonprofit development corporation known as The Center City development Corporation (3CDC), and that organization is widely credited with bringing a resurgence to Cincinnati&#x27;s urban core.

Also in 2004, Luken made repeal of Article 12 (a law prohibiting the City from passing any legislation advancing LGBTQ rights) a central part of the City&#x27;s agenda in his State of the City speech. That November the citizens of Cincinnati repealed Article 12.

Luken has also chaired the Ohio State Racing Commission (2006-2010) and is currently the chairman of The Cincinnati Port Authority (cincinnatiport.org).

<doc id="803279" wikidata="Q3119843" url="?curid=803279" title="Time Commanders">
<text>Time Commanders is a technological game show that originally aired on BBC Two from 4 September 2003 to 13 March 2005 with Eddie Mair hosting the first series and Richard Hammond hosting the second series. It returned for a 3-part special on BBC Four from 12 to 27 December 2016 with Gregg Wallace as host.

==Format==
In the first two series, teams of four contestants directed opposite forces. The teams were unfamiliar with computer games, to make sure their gaming skills did not influence their success. In the 2016 revival, two teams of three controlled opposing factions (for example, one team would play as Carthage and the other as Rome).

After a brief introduction of the battle, including an overview of military units, terrain and available forces, the players had to develop a strategy and then deploy their forces. In the first two series, two of the players were selected as generals, who directed the battle and had access to a strategic map; in the 2016 revival, only one player was selected as the general. The other two players were designated lieutenants in the first series, and captains in the second series and 2016 revival. The units were indirectly controlled by the lieutenants, who issued commands to programme assistants, who in turn used the game interface to control the units. Troop deployment and battle followed, although in both the 2005 and 2016 series there was a small skirmish conducted as a separate event to acquaint the players with the game mechanics and their units. In the 2016 series the teams also got strategic pauses where they could refine their strategies. 
During each game, a pair of military specialists analysed the performance of the players and explained how the real historical battle unfolded. Lynette Nusbacher appeared in every episode of the first two series and was joined on a rotating basis by Mike Loades, Saul David, Mark Urban or Dr. Adrian Goldsworthy, the series&#x27; historical advisor. In the 2016 revival, Nusbacher and Loades fulfilled this role in all three episodes.

==Background==
The game engine used was based on &quot;&quot;, the game being released a year later. &quot;Rome: Total War&quot; designer and writer Mike Brunton said, &quot;&quot;Time Commanders&quot; did use &quot;Rome&quot; code pretty much &#x27;as is&#x27;, with tweaks for different troop types and camera controls&quot;. The televised programmes contained no reference to the origin of the software powering the 3D visuals, due to the BBC&#x27;s rules against product placement; however &quot;Rome: Total War&quot; makers The Creative Assembly were named in the credits of the show with a specific mention of them providing the game engine.

==Related media==
A tie-in book was written by Peter Harrison and published by Virgin Books in 2004, called &quot;Time Commanders: Great Battles of the Ancient World.&quot; It covered the 16 battles of the first series, along with details of all the contestants in each of the teams, which battle and which army they each played and whether they won or lost the battle they had been given.

<doc id="803280" wikidata="Q686196" url="?curid=803280" title="Rote Island">
<text>Rote Island (, also spelled &quot;Roti&quot;) is an island of Indonesia, part of the East Nusa Tenggara province of the Lesser Sunda Islands. According to legend, this island got its name accidentally when a lost Portuguese sailor arrived and asked a farmer where he was. The surprised farmer, who could not speak Portuguese, introduced himself, &quot;Rote&quot;. About 80% of the people of Rote Island in Indonesia are Christian. Christianity is an important part of the community.

== Geography ==
Rote lies 500 km (310.686 miles) northwest of the Australian coast and 150 km (105.633 miles) north of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands. The island is situated to the southwest of the larger island of Timor. To the north is the Savu Sea, and to the south is the Timor Sea. To the west lie Savu and Sumba. The uninhabited &quot;Pamana&quot; (or &quot;Ndana&quot;) island, just south of Rote, with an area of , is the southernmost island of Indonesia. Along with some other nearby small islands, such as Nuse Island and Ndao island to the west of Rote, it forms the kabupaten (regency) of Rote Ndao Regency, which in the 2020 decennial census recorded a population of 143,764; the official estimate as at mid 2022 was 148,811. Rote island has an area of (including offshore islands).

The main town, Ba&#x27;a, is located on the northern side of the island. Rote has a good surf area in the south, around the village of Nembrala.

For the most part, the island is covered by grassland and palms. This island experiences tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;) with dry months for much of the year because of the dry winds that blow from mainland Australia. The main rainfall usually occurs between November and March. Between 80% and 95% of all rain falls during the wet west monsoon period and with little or no rain falling between July and October. The mean rainfall for Rote Island is around 1,200 to 1,300 mm annually. During the dry season, many streams and rivers run dry and local inhabitants must rely only on wells for their water supplies.

== Geology ==
Rote is the youngest island of the Banda Fore Arc. The Banda Fore Arc is an accretionary wedge forming in response to an arc continent collision between oceanic crust of the Eurasian Plate and the Australian Plate. As the Australian continental shelf subducts under the Banda Arc, marine sediment is transferred to the upper plate, forming and accretionary wedge. Most of the wedge is submarine, but some parts are exposed above sea level forming the islands of Sumba, Savu, Rote and Timor.

Rote and Savu are the youngest of these islands. Researchers have investigated the biostratigraphy of microfossils to time the uplift of these islands and the rate at which they rose from below sea level. Planktonic microorganisms called Foraminifera build shells of calcite. When they die, their shells accumulate on the seafloor as thick sequences of chalk. Chalk forms in deep marine, low energy environments. The Neogene Batu Putih Formation is a deposit of chalk, 100s of meters thick, that accumulated on top of the Banda Fore Arc accretionary wedge. This chalk is exposed at the surface on Rote and Savu.

By studying the faunal succession and thickness of chalk deposits, researchers have determined that the accretionary wedge began forming at least 5.6 million years ago. Rote rose to the surface around 200,000 years ago, half a million years after nearby Savu, from a depth of at least 2.5 km below sea level, at an average rate of 0.6 mm/year over the past 5.2 million years. Over the last 125,000 years that rate has increased to almost 1.4 mm/year. Changes in the rates in uplift is hypothesized to be a consequence of the subduction of the Scott Plateau of the Australian passive margin. More work is needed to understand the crustal and tectonic mechanisms that are at play in the development of the Rote and Savu islands.

== Transportation ==
There is a daily ferry to the island from Kupang, the provincial capital on West Timor, which provides transport for local passengers and goods as well as tourists. The trip between Kupang and Ba&#x27;a takes around two hours. The ferry leaves at 8.30 AM and costs 80,000 Indonesian rupiah. The fare in 2023 had risen to 202,000 IDR.

Wings Air operates daily flights between Rote&#x27;s David Constantijn Saudale Airport and Kupang&#x27;s El Tari International Airport. Flight time is about 30 minutes.

== Economy ==
Rote consists of rolling hills, terraced plantations, acacia palm, savanna and some forests. The Rotinese depend, like the Savunese, on the lontar palm not only for basic survival but also as a supplement to their income from fishing and jewelry making.

Agriculture is the main form of employment. Fishing is also important, especially in the eastern village of &quot;Papela&quot; (east of &quot;Londalusi&quot; in the map), which has led to disputes with Australia over the water between them.

== Tourist attractions ==
Rote has many historical relics including fine antique Chinese porcelain, as well as ancient arts and traditions. Several prominent Indonesian figures were born in Rote. A popular music instrument, Sasando, is made of palm leaves.

In the eastern part of the island is a pond in Landu Village that has non-poisonous jellyfish. The pond also has a white sandy beach.

Rote Island, also known as Rote Ndao, is an island consisting of 96 small islands and 6 of them are inhabited. Many islands have natural beaches and other natural and frequent tourism, but so far only local tourists often come to Rote. 10 of the most famous tourist attractions in Rote that are Bo&#x27;a beach, Nemberala beach, Lutu Babatu beach, Falii water located in West Rote, Oesosole beach in East Rote, Termanu stone in central Rote, Laguna Nirwana in Southwest Rote, Oekode Waterfall, Zero Point Rote and Inaoe beach in South Rote.

== Culture ==
The ti&#x27;i langga is a traditional hat with a horn-like protrusion at the top that is a symbol of Rote cultural identity.

There are many languages spoken on the island, all related to the languages on nearby Timor island. These languages are: Bilba, Dengka, Lole, Ringgou, Dela-Oenale, Termanu, and Tii.

== Trivia ==
The critically endangered Rote Island snake-necked turtle is endemic to Rote Island.

The US-born Australian scholar, James J. Fox, has written extensively about Rotinese culture.

<text>Thomas Andrew Luken (July 9, 1925 – January 10, 2018) was an American politician of the Democratic Party from Ohio, serving in the United States House of Representatives during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Early life and education==
Luken received his high school diploma in 1942 from Purcell High School. During the Second World War, Luken served as a U.S. Marine. In 1947, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Xavier University in Cincinnati, after having earned some credits at Bowling Green State University. In 1950, he earned a law degree at the Salmon P. Chase College of Law at Northern Kentucky University and began practicing law.

==Career==
From 1955 to 1961, Luken served as solicitor for the city of Deer Park, Ohio. He was then appointed United States District Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, in which he served from 1961 to 1964. He served on the Cincinnati city council from 1964 to 1967 and from 1969 to 1974. He also was the mayor of Cincinnati from 1971 to 1972.

In 1974, Luken won a special election in the Cincinnati-based 1st congressional district to fill out the term of William J. Keating, a Republican who resigned his seat. However, Luken was defeated later that year in his bid for a full term by Republican Bill Gradison, who had preceded him as mayor of Cincinnati. In 1976, Luken ran in the neighboring 2nd district and unseated Republican incumbent Donald D. Clancy, beginning service in 1977 (95th Congress). He was reelected six times, all by large margins. He was only the second Democrat to represent a significant portion of Cincinnati for more than one term in the 20th century.

In 1983, Luken and Gradison swapped districts as a result of the 1980 census, with Luken&#x27;s district being renumbered as the 1st District. He did not run for an eighth term in 1990, opting instead to retire in favor of his son, Cincinnati mayor Charlie Luken, who won a term in his father&#x27;s former seat.

Tom Luken&#x27;s brother, Jim Luken, was a labor leader and also served as a Cincinnati mayor.

==Death==
Tom Luken died on January 10, 2018.

<doc id="803297" wikidata="Q13562559" url="?curid=803297" title="Roxanne Qualls">
<text>Roxanne Qualls (born March 3, 1953) is an American politician who served as the 66th mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio. She also served a two-year term on the Cincinnati City Council prior to her service as mayor, having been elected in 1993. On August 8, 2007, the Charter Committee announced her appointment to fill the unexpired term of council member Jim Tarbell. Qualls was elected to a two-year term on Cincinnati City Council in November 2007, and again in 2009 and 2011. She served as Vice Mayor, the chair of the Budget and Finance Committee, chair of the Livable Communities Committee and chair of the Subcommittee on Major Transportation and Infrastructure Projects.

She was a candidate in the November 2013 election for Mayor of Cincinnati, but was defeated by John Cranley.

==Background==
Qualls was born in Tacoma, Washington. She grew up across the river from Cincinnati in the community of Erlanger, Kentucky. Her parents settled in Erlanger after her father retired from the Air Force when Roxanne was seven years old. Prior to arriving in Kentucky, she had lived in Taiwan, Japan, and New Hampshire.

She attended St. Henry&#x27;s Grade School in Erlanger and then attended Notre Dame Academy in Park Hills, Kentucky for high school. While at Notre Dame Academy, she participated in the school&#x27;s chapters of the National Forensics League and National Honor Society. She attended Thomas More College for three semesters majoring in history and then attended the University of Cincinnati in the Department of Urban Planning and Design at the College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning.

==Early career==
Prior to serving in elective office, Roxanne was the first Director of the Northern Kentucky Rape Crisis Center (1975–1977, now known as the Women&#x27;s Crisis Center, Kentucky), the Executive Director of Women Helping Women (1977–1979, now known as the Hamilton County Rape Crisis and Abuse Center), owned a small business specializing in house painting and renovation, and served as an Associate Director (1983–1985) and then Director (1985–1991) of the Cincinnati office of Ohio Citizen Action (formerly known as Ohio Public Interest Campaign). While director of Ohio Citizen Action&#x27;s Cincinnati office, Roxanne worked with neighborhood groups and environmental organizations to pass the City of Cincinnati&#x27;s air code, lobbied the city to establish the Office of Environmental Management, and advocated for the establishment of the city&#x27;s recycling program. Her office released an annual analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Toxic Release Inventory. She served as a member of the Lower Price Hill Task Force, a collaborative effort to target the environmental causes of Lower Price Hill children&#x27;s health problems.

==Cincinnati City Council, 1991–1993==
Roxanne Qualls first ran for the nine-member at-large Cincinnati City Council in 1987. She placed 14th. She ran again in 1989 and placed 10th. She was elected in 1991.
In her first term on council, Roxanne served as chair of the Intergovernmental Affairs and Environment Committee. She promoted employee health and safety, successfully advocating that the city adopt Occupational Health and Safety Administration standards for city workers and develop an effective loss prevention program. She led the city&#x27;s planning efforts to develop a long-term transportation policy that included mass transit. She worked to establish the Toxic Sweep program that trained city inspectors to recognize threats from hazardous and toxic waste. In addition, she emphasized increased cooperation between the City of Cincinnati and Hamilton County and organized regular meeting between her committee and the County Commission on issues of shared concern.

==Mayor of Cincinnati, 1993–1999==
In 1993, Qualls became Mayor of the City of Cincinnati by achieving the highest number of votes of any council member. She subsequently won elections for the office in 1995 and in 1997 where she served until the end of her term limits.

As mayor, Qualls emphasized openness and accessibility, collaborative public-private partnerships, and community and economic development.

Upon taking the office of mayor in 1993, Qualls established &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Night In&quot; where every Tuesday evening for two hours anyone could come and see her about any issue or concern; and she established the Mayor&#x27;s Business Expansion and Retention Program and the Mayor&#x27;s Business Breakfasts.

She introduced several partnerships with various private sector companies. The partnership with the Greater Cincinnati Home Builders Association resulted in Citirama, a center city home show. A partnership with the Board of Realtors produced the Ambassador Program that familiarized real estate agents with the assets of Cincinnati. The U.S. Conference of Mayors recognized this programs as a &quot;Best Practice&quot; in 2005. She established the Home Ownership Partnership, a coalition of over 32 lending institutions and community development organizations to improve Cincinnati&#x27;s rate of home ownership.

Qualls also enacted multiple policies regarding crime. She developed the Zero Tolerance Initiative: A Campaign to Take Back Our Neighborhoods, to combat blight and neighborhood deterioration. It was recognized by the U.S. Conference of Mayors as a &quot;Best Practice&quot; in 1999. She initiated Cincinnati&#x27;s suit against gun manufacturers for failing to incorporate safety features into guns and for facilitating the illegal distribution of guns. She supported the hiring of more police officers and the Community Oriented Policing (COP) program based around broken window policing. Also, she proposed the Permitting Drug Abuse ordinance to charge property owners for knowingly permitting drug trafficking on their property.

Additionally, Qualls introduced partnerships with different municipalities in the Greater Cincinnati area. As mayor and as a member of the Executive Committee, and later as President of the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council of Governments, she oversaw the Major Investment Study that resulted in the redesign and reconfiguration of Fort Washington Way. She also successfully lobbied for federal dollars to fund the region&#x27;s light rail major investment study. With then-County Commissioner Bob Bedinghaus and members of City Council, she helped form the joint City-County Planning Committee to develop the Master Plan for Cincinnati&#x27;s Central Riverfront and to determine the location of the two stadiums, Paul Brown Stadium and Great American Ballpark.

<doc id="803303" wikidata="Q1176464" url="?curid=803303" title="David S. Mann">
<text>David Scott Mann (born September 25, 1939) is an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the United States representative for Ohio&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 1993 to 1995. He also served as a member of the Cincinnati City Council from 2013 to 2022 and from 1974 to 1992, during which time he served as mayor of Cincinnati from 1980 to 1982 and again in 1991. Mann ran in the 2021 Cincinnati mayoral election, but lost to Hamilton County Clerk of Courts Aftab Pureval.

==Early life==
At the time of his birth, Mann&#x27;s parents resided in Park Hills, a Northern Kentucky suburb of Cincinnati. During his father&#x27;s service in the United States Navy in World War II, Mann lived with his mother in her hometown of Horse Cave, Kentucky before moving to his father&#x27;s assignment of the Bronx. His family later settled in Cincinnati.

Mann completed his secondary education at Dixie Heights High School before attending Harvard University on a Navy ROTC scholarship, graduating &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1961 with a degree in biochemical science. After graduating, Mann served in the Navy from 1961 to 1965. As a lieutenant, Mann served aboard the destroyer USS &quot;English&quot; during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Mann was a supporter of President John F. Kennedy; Mann credits Kennedy&#x27;s assassination with convincing him to attend law school instead of medical school so that he could better engage in public service. After his time in the navy, Mann attended Harvard Law School and was awarded a Bachelor of Laws degree &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1968. He was an editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. Mann returned to the Cincinnati metropolitan area after graduation so that he would be closer to family.

==Political career==
===Early political involvement===
Mann put up yard signs for Jack Gilligan&#x27;s unsuccessful 1968 Senate campaign; he originally intended to help write Gilligan&#x27;s policy proposals, but the campaign did not accept his request. He later contributed to Tom Luken&#x27;s campaign for a seat on the Cincinnati City Council.

===Initial municipal career===
Mann was a member of Cincinnati&#x27;s board of health from 1972 to 1974. Luken encouraged him to run for a seat on the City Council, but Mann&#x27;s first attempt in 1973 was unsuccessful. The following year, Mann replaced Jerry Springer on the Council after Springer resigned due to a prostitution scandal. Mann served as mayor of Cincinnati twice during his time on the Council, first from December 1980 to November 1982 and then from January to November 1991. During both of Mann&#x27;s mayoral terms, the office of mayor was not directly elected and was largely ceremonial in nature. Following a 1989 shooting in Louisville, Mann successfully proposed a ban on most semi-automatic firearms within Cincinnati. He left the Council in 1992.

===Congress===

Ahead of the 1992 House of Representatives elections, incumbent representative Charlie Luken of Ohio&#x27;s 1st congressional district announced that he would not seek re-election after already winning the June primary. Mann was term-limited in the City Council and was considering a campaign for a judicial position, but instead decided to run for the congressional seat, stating that his name recognition would help propel him to victory. Mann won the three-week special primary to become the Democratic nominee, narrowly defeating State Senator William Bowen. Mann won 51% of the vote in the general election, defeating both Republican-backed independent Stephen Grote and Libertarian-affiliated independent Jim Berns.

Mann began serving in the 103rd United States Congress in 1993. While in the House, he sponsored five bills and served on the House Armed Services and House Judiciary Committees. Mann voted against President Bill Clinton&#x27;s stimulus package and budget proposal and was skeptical towards Clinton&#x27;s health care plan. Mann also called for further investigation into the Whitewater controversy. His opposition to much of Clinton&#x27;s agenda led an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to state that he &quot;often behaves more like a Republican than a Democrat&quot;. Mann supported some Clinton-backed initiatives, such as the Brady Bill, which established a waiting period of five days for handgun purchases. Mann voted for the 1994 Crime Bill, which he later said he regretted. After learning that one of his sons was gay, he voted in favor of Barney Frank&#x27;s failed 1994 bill to prohibit anti-LGBT discrimination.

Mann voted in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which damaged his reputation with some of his allies in organized labor. Bowen, with the support of several prominent labor unionists, attempted to primary Mann ahead of the 1994 midterms. Despite statements by unions that they would support primary candidates running against pro-NAFTA Democrats, NPR referred to Bowen as the only &quot;serious&quot; labor-backed primary challenger in the country. The Clinton administration supported Mann in the primary, with Vice President Al Gore attending two fundraisers that collectively grossed over $100,000 for Mann&#x27;s campaign. The sum from Gore&#x27;s fundraisers roughly matched the donations that Bowen stated he would receive from unions. In a debate against Bowen, Mann expressed his alignment with the New Democrats and refused to support increased taxes or spending, stating that Bowen wanted to &quot;tax more and spend more&quot;. Mann won renomination by 667 votes, which an article in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; attributed to his successful television advertising. Unions were divided on Mann&#x27;s general election campaign; some, such as the Ohio Education Association, endorsed him, while others, such as the Cincinnati AFL–CIO Labor Council, refused to do so. Mann ultimately lost his bid for re-election to Republican Steve Chabot in the &quot;Republican Revolution&quot;. Mann left office in 1995.

===Later municipal career===
Mann ran for a position on the Ohio First District Court of Appeals in 1996, but lost to incumbent Lee Hildebrandt, Jr. He would not return to politics until 2013, when he ran for and won a seat on the Cincinnati City Council. He was simultaneously endorsed by the Democratic Party and the Charter Committee. Mann was appointed vice mayor by Mayor John Cranley in 2013, a position which he would hold until 2018. Mann opposed the Cincinnati streetcar and voted to halt its construction on his fourth day in office, but work on the project eventually proceeded. Mann often served as a mediator between Cranley and Cranley&#x27;s opponents on the Council, helping broker deals on a number of issues. In 2015, Mann reached a compromise with Cranley on a budget dispute, preventing a government shutdown. 

Mann was re-elected in 2017. In 2018, Mann became the chair of the Council&#x27;s Budget and Finance Committee, which is responsible for the city&#x27;s finances. That same year, Mann proposed levying an excise tax on short-term rentals, with the proceeds going to the city&#x27;s affordable housing fund. Mann stated that the tax would &quot;strike a balance between preserving and funding affordable housing units and community in neighborhoods, encouraging tourism and entrepreneurship through short-term rentals, and ensuring that all visitors to Cincinnati are staying in units that are safe and up to code&quot;. The proposal was implemented in 2019. In 2020, Mann voted with the majority of the Council to remove the fare from the streetcar.

In May 2020, Mann announced that he would participate in the 2021 Cincinnati mayoral election. In a letter to potential donors, Mann stated that he had no ambitions for higher office beyond city politics and that his &quot;experience and leadership qualities&quot; could help address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2021, Mann won 29% of the vote in the nonpartisan mayoral primary, placing second and advancing to the general election. Following the primary, Mann stated that general election opponent Aftab Pureval lacked the experience to serve as mayor, referring to Pureval&#x27;s position of Hamilton County Clerk of Courts as &quot;small&quot;. By October 21, Mann had raised $388,307, trailing Pureval&#x27;s $961,810. Mann lost the November general election with 34% of the vote to Pureval&#x27;s 66%.

==Other ventures==
Mann joined the Ohio State Bar Association in 1968. From 1995 to 2001, he taught at the University of Cincinnati College of Law. In 1997, Mann and his son Michael founded their own law firm, Mann &amp; Mann. The firm primarily handles tax law and employment discrimination cases.

Mann has served on the boards of numerous charitable organizations, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Freestore Foodbank.

==Personal life==
Mann lives in Clifton with his wife, Betsy. They have three children. Mann is a Methodist.

<text>Patricia Jean Griffin (born March 16, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. She is a vocalist and plays guitar and piano. She is known for her stripped-down songwriting style in the folk music genre. Her songs have been covered by numerous musicians, including Emmylou Harris, Ellis Paul, Kelly Clarkson, Rory Block, Dave Hause, Sugarland, Bette Midler and The Chicks.

In 2007, Griffin received the Artist of the Year award from the Americana Music Association, and her album &quot;Children Running Through&quot; won the award for Best Album. She received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting at the 2023 Americana Music Honors &amp; Awards. In 2011, Griffin&#x27;s album &quot;Downtown Church&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Gospel Album and her 2019 self-titled album won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album.

==Biography==
Griffin is from Old Town, Maine, next to the Penobscot Native American reservation. She is the youngest of seven children in her family. She bought a guitar for $50 at age 16, and initially sang and played with no inclination to become a professional musician. After a six-year marriage that ended in 1994, Griffin began performing in Boston coffee houses and was scouted by A&amp;M Records, which signed her on the strength of her demo tape. When the finished studio recordings were submitted to A&amp;M, company executives thought it was overproduced, so producer Nile Rodgers and the label instead released a stripped-down reworking of her demo recordings as the album &quot;Living with Ghosts.&quot;

Griffin&#x27;s second album, &quot;Flaming Red&quot;, released in 1998, was a departure from the acoustic sound of &quot;Living with Ghosts&quot;, with a mix of mellow songs and high-tempo rock and roll songs. The title track, &quot;Flaming Red&quot;, is an example of the latter, beginning with an even beat until it increases to a fevered pitch of emotion. One of the songs, &quot;Tony&quot;, was featured on the charity benefit album &quot;Live in the X Lounge&quot;.

Her third album, &quot;Silver Bell&quot;, has a sound similar to its predecessor, but while it was recorded in 2000 it was not released by A&amp;M until 2013 (well after unofficial bootleg copies had been circulating). A&amp;M had dropped Griffin&#x27;s contract after &quot;Silver Bell&quot; was recorded, and she was then signed by Dave Matthews&#x27; ATO Records. Griffin re-recorded some songs from &quot;Silver Bell&quot;, such as &quot;Making Pies&quot;, &quot;Mother of God&quot;, &quot;Standing&quot;, and &quot;Top of the World&quot;, for inclusion on later releases. After copies of the unreleased &quot;Silver Bell&quot; recordings were leaked and bootlegged, starting around 2006 they began circulating among fans, many of whom traded/shared music on internet message boards. In August 2013, it was announced that UMe planned to release &quot;Silver Bell&quot;, mixed by producer Glyn Johns, in October 2013.

Four albums followed on ATO: &quot;1000 Kisses&quot; (2002), &quot;A Kiss in Time&quot; (2003), &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; (2004), and &quot;Children Running Through&quot; (2007).

In 2004, Griffin toured with Emmylou Harris, Buddy Miller, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings as the Sweet Harmony Traveling Revue. On February 6, 2007, she released &quot;Children Running Through&quot;. The album debuted at number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with 27,000 copies sold. Of the album, Griffin told &quot;Gibson Lifestyle&quot;, &quot;I just kind of felt like singing what I wanted to sing, and playing how I wanted to play. It&#x27;s not all dark and tragic. It&#x27;s a different way for me to look at things. Getting old—older, I should say, I&#x27;m not so serious all the time.&quot; It was also said that the album was inspired by her childhood.

Griffin&#x27;s songs have been recorded by numerous artists, including the Irish-born singer Maura O&#x27;Connell (&quot;Long Ride Home&quot;), Linda Ronstadt (&quot;Falling Down&quot;), The Chicks (&quot;Truth No. 2&quot;, &quot;Top of the World&quot;, &quot;Let Him Fly&quot;, &quot;Mary&quot;), Bette Midler, Melissa Ferrick and Missy Higgins (&quot;Moses&quot;), Beth Nielsen Chapman, Christine Collister, and Mary Chapin Carpenter (&quot;Dear Old Friend&quot;), Jessica Simpson (&quot;Let Him Fly&quot;), Martina McBride (&quot;Goodbye&quot;), Emmylou Harris (&quot;One Big Love&quot;, &quot;Moon Song&quot;), Bethany Joy Galeotti (&quot;Blue Sky&quot;), the Wreckers (&quot;One More Girl&quot;), Keri Noble and Ruthie Foster (&quot;When It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;), Joan Osborne (&quot;What You Are&quot;), Solomon Burke (&quot;Up to the Mountain&quot;), Miranda Lambert (&quot;Getting Ready&quot;), and Drew Holcomb &amp; The Neighbors (&quot;Long Ride Home&quot;). Kelly Clarkson performed &quot;Up to the Mountain&quot; with Jeff Beck on guitar, accompanied by some orchestration on the &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; episode of &quot;American Idol&quot;, and the live recording was released as a single immediately afterwards, reaching number 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in its first week and giving Griffin her highest-charting position as a songwriter. (The audience gave Clarkson a standing ovation following her performance.) Griffin&#x27;s version of the song was featured in episode 11 of the fourth season of the ABC television show &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

==Recent work==

In September 2008, Griffin sang &quot;You Got Growing Up to Do&quot; in a duet with indie artist Joshua Radin on his album &quot;Simple Times&quot;. In October 2008, she sang background vocals on Todd Snider&#x27;s cover of John Fogerty&#x27;s &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; for Snider&#x27;s &quot;Peace Queer&quot; album. In February 2009, she was featured on the album &quot;Feel That Fire&quot;, by Dierks Bentley, in a duet on the song &quot;Beautiful World&quot;. In 2009, Griffin, along with Mavis Staples and the Tri-City Singers released a version of the song &quot;Waiting for My Child to Come Home&quot; on the compilation album &quot;Oh Happy Day: An All-Star Music Celebration&quot;.
The collaboration with Staples led EMI&#x27;s Peter York to suggest Griffin make an album of gospel songs. Griffin agreed on the condition that friend and bandmate Buddy Miller produced the record. The album, &quot;Downtown Church&quot; (her sixth studio album), recorded at the Downtown Presbyterian Church in Nashville, was released on January 26, 2010. The album, featuring Shawn Colvin, Emmylou Harris, and Griffin&#x27;s long-time friends Buddy and Julie Miller, contains songs by Hank Williams, Willie Mae &quot;Big Mama&quot; Thornton, and &quot;All Creatures of Our God and King&quot; (credited to St. Francis of Assisi).

In July 2010, Robert Plant toured the United States with Band of Joy (reprising the name of his band in the 1960s), with Griffin as a backing vocalist and singer-guitarist Buddy Miller, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Darrell Scott, bassist-vocalist Byron House, and drummer-percussionist-vocalist Marco Giovino. She is also featured on Plant&#x27;s solo album &quot;Band of Joy&quot;, released in September 2010 by Rounder Records.

In 2014 Griffin parted with Plant after a long relationship; they had lived together and divided their time between Austin, Texas, and England. In 2019, Griffin released &quot;River&quot;, a track from her upcoming self-titled album and her first new music since battling breast cancer. &quot;Patty Griffin&quot; was released on March 8, 2019.

On January 11, 2019, along with an official announcement of her new album release &quot;Patty Griffin&quot; (on her PGM Recordings label via Thirty Tigers), a new song, &quot;River&quot;, she announced a 2019 concert tour. She followed this with &quot;Tape&quot; in 2022.

In 1979, he began to produce, write, and star in &quot;Smith &amp; Smith&quot;, a sketch comedy series with a cast consisting of Smith and his wife Morag. The show was produced for Hamilton, Ontario&#x27;s CHCH-TV and syndicated to other television stations in Canada, and featured the first appearances of the Red Green character.

==Career==

In 1985, Smith created the family sitcom &quot;Me &amp; Max&quot;. After the first season the Smiths went back to sketch comedy, creating the series &quot;The Comedy Mill&quot;, which ran for four years. Smith was a writer on &quot;Offside&quot;, a sports comedy series for CTV, head writer for Global&#x27;s &quot;Laughing Matters&quot;, and the TV pilot of &quot;Out of Our Minds&quot; with David Steinberg. He wrote three episodes of CBS&#x27; &quot;Top Cops&quot; series.

In 1997, Smith was credited as his alter-ego, Red Green, in the &quot;Pavement&quot; episode of the Cartoon Network/Adult Swim show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. In 2002 the full-length movie &quot;Duct Tape Forever&quot; was produced. Smith writes a syndicated newspaper column as Red Green, distributed by Newspaper Enterprise Association. In 2009, as a public service announcement by the Ontario Provincial Police and the Ontario Power Generation, Smith supplied his voice to a talking fish, warning of the dangers of illegal fishing near government hydro dams. In 2004, Smith hosted a show on Space called &quot;Steve Smith Playhouse&quot;.

Smith has performed as Red Green on several tours, including the &quot;Wit &amp; Wisdom&quot; Tour (2013), &quot;How to Do Everything&quot; Tour (2014), and the &quot;I&#x27;m Not Old, I&#x27;m Ripe&quot; North American Tour (2016). The 2019 North American tour, &quot;This Could Be It&quot;, began in March 2019 and ran until the end of October, with shows in 34 U.S. cities and 29 Canadian cities.

He was appointed as the UK Prime Minister&#x27;s Special Representative to Saudi Arabia for Education in October 2020 and reappointed as the UK Government Special Representative to Saudi Arabia for Education in December 2024. 

==Early life==
Smith was born on 4 February 1952 in Norwich, England. He attended the City of Norwich School, then a grammar school, on Eaton Road, Norwich. His parents were from working class backgrounds. At a parents&#x27; evening, his form master told his parents about their son that &quot;people like you don&#x27;t go to university&quot;. The school afterwards suggested finding a low-skilled job for him.

Smith gained a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Politics and International Studies in 1973, a Master of Science (MSc) degree in international studies in 1974 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree (PhD) in international relations in 1978, all from the University of Southampton.

From 1976 to 1978, Smith lectured at Huddersfield Polytechnic. From 1979 to 1992, he lectured at University of East Anglia, becoming director of the Centre for Public Choice Studies at UEA. He was a professor at the university from 1990 to 1992. From 1992 to 2002, he was senior pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), as well as professor of international politics at University of Wales, Aberystwyth and head of the Department of International Politics.

In October 2002, he succeeded Geoffrey Holland as vice-chancellor of the University of Exeter.

He is a member of the Board of Governors of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

===Publications===
During his academic career, Smith has written or edited thirteen books and almost 100 academic papers. He has given over 150 academic presentations in 22 different countries. Within international relations theory, he often writes in a post-positivist vein, and has contributed articles to edited volumes on both post-modernism in international relations and Critical Security Studies. He co-authored &quot;Explaining and Understanding International Relations&quot; with the late Professor Martin Hollis.

He was the editor of the joint Cambridge University Press and British International Studies Association, &quot;Cambridge Studies in International Relations&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
Smith was the recipient of 1999 Susan Strange Award, awarded by the International Studies Association. In 2000, he was elected as an Academician of the Social Sciences (AcSS). In April 2007, he was awarded an honorary professorship by Jilin University in China. In 2009, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.

<doc id="803325" wikidata="Q3499123" url="?curid=803325" title="Steve Smith (ice hockey, born April 30, 1963)">
<text>James Stephen Smith (born April 30, 1963) is a Scottish-born Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman and former assistant coach of the Buffalo Sabres, Carolina Hurricanes and Edmonton Oilers. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1984–85 to 2000–01 and coached from 2010–11 to 2020–21. Currently, Smith is the interim head coach with the Hartford Wolfpack of the American Hockey League (AHL). Smith played in the 1991 All-Star game in Chicago and was part of the 1991 Canadian Team that won the Canada Cup in Toronto.

==Playing career==
Smith played for the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League from 1980–81 to 1982–83 before being drafted by the Edmonton Oilers in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft in the 6th round, 111th overall. He spent his first 2 years of professional hockey (1983–84 to 1984–85) playing for the Oilers minor league affiliate teams (Moncton and Halifax). He played with the Oilers starting in the 1984–85 season. He went on to play 804 career games scoring 375 points (72-303-375) along with 2,139 penalty minutes. Smith also played in 134 Stanley Cup Playoff games, scoring 52 points (11-41-52).

Smith played for the Oilers until the end of the 1990–91 season, winning three Stanley Cups with the team. Smith remains the Oilers&#x27; single-season leader in penalty minutes with 286, which he set during the 1987–88 season. He then played for the Chicago Blackhawks until 1997. He announced his retirement due to injury following the 1996–97 season but made a comeback in 1998–99 playing parts of three seasons with the Flames, retiring for good in December 2000.

===The &quot;own goal&quot;===
Although Smith scored 83 goals in his NHL career (including 11 in the playoffs), he may be best known for a shot that went into his &quot;own&quot; net. On April 30, 1986, Smith&#x27;s 23rd birthday, in the seventh game of the Smythe Division Final against the Calgary Flames, Calgary&#x27;s Perry Berezan dumped the puck into the Edmonton zone before leaving the ice on a line change. Smith recovered the puck behind his net and intended to send it down the ice, only to accidentally bounce it off goaltender Grant Fuhr&#x27;s skate and into his own net, giving the Flames a 3–2 lead. (Although he was already off the ice, Berezan was the last Flame to touch the puck and was thus credited with the goal: a rare instance of a hockey player &quot;scoring&quot; a goal while sitting on the bench.) The top-seeded Oilers could not get the equalizer, and thus lost the game and were eliminated from the playoffs. Many fans blamed Smith for the loss, but in his autobiography Wayne Gretzky called that opinion &quot;a total cop-out&quot;, asserting that the Oilers should&#x27;ve clinched the series well before Game Seven. (As of 2023, Calgary and Edmonton have met in the Stanley Cup playoffs six times, and the 1986 tilt remains the Flames&#x27; only victory.) When the Oilers recaptured the Stanley Cup in , Smith was the first player to be handed the cup from Gretzky after receiving it from NHL President John Ziegler.

==Coaching career==
Smith was an assistant coach with the Flames in 1997–98. He worked as a scout with the Chicago Blackhawks before spending four seasons on the Oilers coaching staff from 2010 to 2014. He was hired as an assistant coach of the Hurricanes in June 2014, and then as the assistant coach of the Sabres in July 2018. Smith, along with head coach Ralph Krueger were relieved of their duties by the Sabres on March 17, 2021. He was then hired by the New York Rangers minor league affiliate team the Hartford Wolf Pack as an assistant coach and was named their interim head coach when Kris Knoblauch was hired to be the Edmonton Oilers&#x27; head coach.

==Personal life==
Smith was born in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, but grew up in Cobourg, Ontario and has two brothers, David and Ian.

He is married and has five children. His son, Barron Smith (born April 2, 1991), was selected by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 7th round of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft.

<text>Francis Edward Cotton (born 3 January 1947) is a former rugby union prop forward who played for England and the British Lions. His clubs included Coventry R.F.C. and Sale. A &quot;fearsome&quot; prop, he was primarily a tighthead but also played to a high level at loosehead, winning three Lions caps in 1977 on the left of the front row and the Grand Slam with England in 1980. After retiring, he remained in rugby administration and founded a clothing company. In 2007, Cotton returned to his former club Sale as a member of the club&#x27;s board.

Cotton was born in Wigan, Lancashire, and went to Loughborough University to study physical education. Cotton was ahead of his time in terms of physical preparation. It was during these years that Cotton would win the Glengarth Sevens at Davenport RUFC, now renamed Stockport Rugby Club, along with Steve Smith and Clive Rees. Cotton made his England debut against Scotland in 1971 and played for them 31 times. He also captained the English team three times.

He represented the Lions on their tours to South Africa in 1974 – playing in all four Tests in the series victory – New Zealand in 1977 and South Africa in 1980 when chest pains seht him home early. It was during the game against the Junior All Blacks on the 1977 tour that the famous &#x27;Mudman&#x27; image of Cotton, standing at number one at the front of a lineout while caked head-to-toe in mud, was taken. Captured by Colorsport&#x27;s Colin Elsey, it became one of the most iconic images of rugby union. He considers the third test of the 1974 series the biggest and most violent game he was ever part of 

Cotton was the Tour Manager for the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa.

With Steve Smith he founded the clothing company Cotton Traders in 1987. In 2008 Cotton Traders was forced to pull out of Burma after an investigation by the Burma Campaign UK uncovered the company was sourcing clothing from Burma. Clothing exports generate significant income for the Burmese dictatorship.

==Charitable work==
He is an honorary president of the rugby charity Wooden Spoon improving the lives of disadvantaged children and young people in Britain and Ireland.

<doc id="803343" wikidata="Q4793754" url="?curid=803343" title="Lillian Heath">
<text>Lilian Heath (December 29, 1865 – August 5, 1962) was the first woman physician in the state of Wyoming and one of the first to practice medicine west of the Mississippi River.

She is notorious for having used the top of the skull of outlaw Big Nose George Parrott as a doorstop and pen jar.

==Early life==
Heath was born in Burnett, Wisconsin, then known as Burnett Junction on December 29, 1865. Her family moved to Aplington, Iowa, and later to Laramie, Wyoming, before moving to Rawlins, Wyoming, where her father got a job as a locomotive painter for the Union Pacific Railroad. Heath arrived in the Wyoming territory when she was eight years old. She observed the solar eclipse of July 29, 1878, along with scientist Henry Draper and inventor Thomas Edison, who had come to Wyoming to conduct experiments and had stayed in the Rawlins House, where the Heaths were living at the time.

Heath graduated from Rawlins High School in 1888.

==Nursing==
In the early 1880s, Heath&#x27;s father obtained a job for her as an assistant to Thomas Maghee, a physician employed by the Union Pacific Railroad. Heath would wear men&#x27;s clothing and carried a gun as protection when she went on her house calls at night. She assisted Maghee, helping treat his patients, including one who had attempted suicide by shooting himself in the chin. Maghee and Heath performed an early example of plastic surgery on the man, recreating a nose from a section of his forehead. While assisting Maghee, she learned how to administer anesthesia, which at first consisted of whiskey but was then followed by chloroform and then ether, which to her was harder to use.

After the March 22, 1881, lynching of infamous outlaw Big Nose George Parrott for the murder of Robert Widdowfield, Heath was a witness at the autopsy performed by Maghee and was given the skull cap that had been sawed off Parrott&#x27;s head as a souvenir, while other portions of his body were made into a pair of shoes. She used the skull cap as a doorstop. She kept the skull cap for decades and it was positively identified as an exact match in the 1950s after the remainder of Parrott&#x27;s body was exhumed and examined. The skull cap was put on display at the Union Pacific Railroad Historical Museum in Council Bluffs, Iowa, while the remainder of the skull is on display at the Carbon County Museum in Rawlins.

== Medical career ==
She enrolled in the University of Colorado at Boulder for a year, and then transferred to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Keokuk, Iowa, where she was one of three women in the entering class of 22 students. Their school year ran from October to March in order to ensure that the cadavers were fresh for students. She graduated from medical school in 1893 at the age of 27 and came back to Rawlins, where she established a medical office in her parents&#x27; house at 111 W Cedar Street. One thing Heath noted about her practice was that she received backlash from patients that were women more than from men. One woman even refused to pay for her services once she found out that Heath was a woman herself. She also often had to ride up to forty miles on horseback to treat her patients.

In 1895, she was the only woman to attend the American Medical Association&#x27;s conference in Denver, Colorado.

On October 24, 1898 at the age of 33, she married Louis J. Nelson of Rawlins, a painter and decorator. Her husband also used the top part of the skull cap, as a tobacco pipe ashtray.

==Retirement and death==
Heath retired from practicing medicine about 1909. She practiced medicine for 15 years, but kept her license up to date her entire life. After retirement, she worked as a model for Daniels and Fischer department store out of Denver. Also, she moved to Lamar, Colorado, where she ran the Ben-Mar Hotel with her husband until 1911. After that, she moved back to Rawlins, Wyoming. Keeping up with medicine, in 1955, she flew to Denver, Colorado to inspect hospitals.

She died at Rawlins Memorial Hospital on August 5, 1962, of complications of a broken hip caused by a fall.

<doc id="803374" wikidata="Q8013380" url="?curid=803374" title="William Jabez Muckley">
<text>William Jabez Muckley (March 23, 1829 – August 30, 1905) was a noted English artist who was born at Wordsley, Kingswinford, in Staffordshire. He was the eldest of the seven children of Jabez Muckley who was a glass artisan.

William Jabez Muckley began his career as a glasscutter with W.H. B. &amp; J. Richardson of Wordsley and became their principal designer and engraver. When only 22, he was responsible for much of the engraving that earned the firm considerable praise in the Great Exhibition of 1851. After the Richardson glass firm was declared insolvent in 1852 Muckley joined the Birmingham School of Art. He won one of the eight scholarships competed for by students at all the art schools in Britain. He went on to study in London and Paris and obtained four art degrees of the highest class.

He was head of the Burslem School of Art for five years in the late 1850s and then went on to be headmaster of Wolverhampton School of Art. In 1862 he became principal of Manchester School of Art. He exhibited at the Royal Academy 1859–1904 and at Suffolk Street, the Royal Institution and Grosvenor Gallery.

In 1878 he wrote &quot;The Student&#x27;s Manual of Artistic Anatomy&quot;, with 25 plates of the bones and surface muscles of the human figure, together with a description of the origin, insertion and use of the muscles, and in 1882 wrote &quot;A Handbook for Painters and Art Students&quot; about the character, nature and use of colours, their permanent or fugitive qualities and the proper vehicles to employ, also short remarks on the practice of painting in oil and water colours, and wrote two other books.

Muckley retired to White Notley Hall, Witham, Essex about 1900 and died at home in 1905.

==Family==
Muckley&#x27;s father Jabez was at various times a glasscutter, a glassworks manager and a glass importer. His younger brother Joseph Fairfax Muckley was the engraver of the very fine Muckley Goblet on display in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (inv. 1937M744), although some sources attribute this to William Jabez Muckley himself.

William&#x27;s son Angelo Fairfax Muckley (1859–1920) was also an artist who illustrated many published works.

A nephew, Louis Fairfax Muckley (1862–1926), also illustrated books, most notably the 1897 Dent edition of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; by Edmund Spenser. A couple of Pre-Raphaelite examples of Louis Fairfax Muckley&#x27;s work (attributed by some to Angelo Fairfax Muckley) are at . &quot;Autumn&quot; was bought in, after an estimate of £20-30,000, at Christie&#x27;s London in June 2003.

<text>Earl of Munster is a title that was created twice, once in the Peerage of Ireland and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first creation came in 1789 in favour of Prince William, the third son of King George III. He was made Duke of Clarence and St Andrews at the same time. When William succeeded to the throne as King William IV in 1830 the titles merged with the crown.

The second creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 12 May 1831 for George Augustus Frederick FitzClarence, the eldest illegitimate son of William IV. He was made Viscount FitzClarence and Baron Tewkesbury at the same time. The viscountcy was used as a courtesy title by the heir apparent to the earldom. The titles were created with remainder to the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten. 

Lord Munster&#x27;s great-grandson, the fifth earl (who succeeded his uncle), was a prominent Conservative politician and held ministerial office under five prime ministers. He was succeeded by his second cousin, the sixth earl. He was the son of Brigadier General Charles FitzClarence, VC (8 May 1865 – 12 November 1914), son of Captain the Hon. George FitzClarence, third son of the first earl. On the death of his son, the seventh earl, in 2000, the titles became extinct.

<text>Haydn William Bunton (5 July 1911 – 5 September 1955) was an Australian rules footballer who represented in the Victorian Football League (VFL), in the West Australian Football League (WAFL), and in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) during the 1930s and 1940s.

Bunton is the only footballer to have won the Brownlow Medal and the Sandover Medal three times each. He is one of only four footballers to have won the Brownlow three times (the others being Ian Stewart, Dick Reynolds and Bob Skilton), and one of only five footballers to have won the Sandover at least three times (the others being Bill Walker, who won it four times; and Barry Cable, Graham Farmer and Merv McIntosh, who each won it three times). Bunton is also the only player to have averaged one Brownlow vote per game over his career, averaging 1.04 votes per game.

Like cricketer Don Bradman and the racehorse Phar Lap, Bunton was a sporting champion who made life bearable for the Australian public during the dark days of the Great Depression. A brilliant runner and ball-winner, he was regarded by some historians and observers of Australian rules as its greatest-ever player.

== Early life ==
The son of Victorians Ernest Edward Bunton, a brickmaker, and Matilda Caroline, née Luhrs, Bunton was born and raised in Albury, New South Wales.

As a young teenager, Bunton excelled in Australian rules football, cricket, swimming, and athletics, creating many records in a number of different sports.

==Playing career==
===Albury Rovers/Albury/West Albury Football Clubs (1923–1930)===
Bunton began playing for the Albury Rovers Football Club as a 12-year-old in 1923 and twice won the league&#x27;s best-and-fairest award. After winning premierships with Albury Rovers in 1926 &amp; 1927, he moved across to the Albury Football Club, although Bunton had earlier made his debut for the Albury Football Club in 1924 in the Ovens and Murray Football League as a 13-year-old boy.

He played for the Albury Rovers Football Club in 1926 and 1927 in the Albury and Border Football Association and kicked 4 goals in their 1926 grand final win as a 15-year-old and also played in their 1927 premiership win. He also won the club&#x27;s best-and-fairest award in both 1926 and 1927.

In June 1928, the Victorian Football League played a match against the Ovens and Murray Football League in Wangaratta, and 16-year-old Hayden Bunton was praised after the game by VFL captain Frank Maher as &quot;being able to hold his own in any league team&quot;.

In 1928, Bunton was best on ground for the Albury Football Club in their Ovens and Murray Football League grand final win against St. Patrick&#x27;s FC. Bunton won the club&#x27;s best and fairest award in 1928 too.

In 1929, there were two Albury based teams in the Ovens and Murray Football League (East Albury &amp; West Albury) and Bunton played for the West Albury Football Club in their 1929 Ovens and Murray Football League premiership side against East Albury and once again he was best on ground in the grand final.

It was at this point after starring in four consecutive senior football premierships, that his natural Australian football ability attracted the attention of all twelve VFL clubs.

In early 1930, Bunton was treated to a farewell dinner in the Albury Town Hall, after signing with the Fitzroy Cricket Club and Fitzroy Football Club.

Shortly after Fitzroy had won the race to secure his services, it was revealed that they had paid him £222 (A$18,750 in 2020 terms) to join, which was illegal under VFL rules. He was subsequently disqualified for 12 months by the Victorian Football League&#x27;s Permit Committee and unable to play during the 1930 VFL season for the Fitzroy Football Club despite several appeals. Bunton later claimed in a 1950 newspaper article that he had received the money for a knee operation after he tore his cartilage in the 1930 Ovens and Murray Football League grand final. His initial legal match payments were the modest sum of £2 (A$168 in 2020 terms) per week.

He resisted offers from clubs in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) to play for them during the 1930 season, one club even offering him a brand-new car.

After finally receiving a permit to play back in the Ovens and Murray Football League for West Albury Football Club in June 1930, Bunton was appointed captain/coach and later played in his fifth consecutive grand final. The match was against the Hume Weir Football Club who proved too good and defeated West Albury for the premiership. Bunton once again played a starring role up until just before half time when he injured his knee and took no further part in the match.

=== Fitzroy (1931–1937) ===
In April, 1931 Bunton was cleared to the Fitzroy Football Club from the West Albury Football Club and his clearance was finally approved by the Victorian Football League&#x27;s Permit Committee.

Bunton finally made his much anticipated VFL debut in round one of the 1931 VFL season against Melbourne Football Club at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, kicking one goal in a losing team.

Bunton played as a rover/follower and achieved instant success, winning Brownlow Medals in his first two seasons (1931 and 1932) in the VFL. He worked in a department store during the day, and practised baulking by weaving his way through crowds of shoppers. One of his opponents, Dick Reynolds, spied on him during this activity in order to learn how to defeat his technique.

During his career at Fitzroy, Bunton won five club best-and-fairest awards, in addition to his Brownlows. He was appointed captain of Fitzroy in 1932. He was runner-up for the Brownlow Medal in 1934 before winning the award for a third and final time in 1935. While playing, Bunton also spent the 1936 VFL season as senior coach at Fitzroy, but could only manage two wins. He was also Fitzroy&#x27;s leading goalkicker in 1936 and 1937.

=== Subiaco (1938–1941) ===
In 1938, Bunton moved to Western Australia, taking the position of captain/coach of , while very competitive, they failed to play finals during his coaching stints of 1938, 1939 and 1941.

Bunton captained the Western Australian team to a victory against St.Kilda Football Club in July, 1938.

He won the Sandover Medal three times, in 1938, 1939 and 1941, Bunton polled 17 votes in the 1940 Sandover Medal, finishing in 6th position.

Altogether, Bunton had won six league best and fairest awards in only eleven seasons between the two states in which he had played.

=== Return to Fitzroy (1942) ===
Corporal Haydn Bunton returned to Melbourne from Perth to enter the Army&#x27;s Physical Training School at Frankston and was accompanied by four Fitzroy Football Club recruits from Western Australian in April, 1942.

Bunton returned to his Army unit in Perth in late May, 1942.

He managed to play only two games for Fitzroy Football Club in rounds one and three of 1942 VFL season, due to his Army commitments.

=== Army/Services Football (1943 &amp; 44) ===

Bunton played in the 18-team Services Football competition in Perth, which was divided into a 10-team A-grade competition and 8-team B-Grade competition.

=== Port Adelaide (1945) ===
After being discharged from army service at the end of World War II at the age of 33, he joined Port Adelaide in the SANFL league and played 17 games during the 1945 SANFL season. Bunton would form a formidable duo with Bob Quinn, helping Port Adelaide attract record crowds for the season. At the end of the minor round, Port Adelaide had lost only two games, finishing up with a percentage of 133. Bunton would play in the first final of his career with Port Adelaide in their Second Semi-Final win against Norwood in front of 36,383 spectators at Adelaide Oval. Bunton would kick two goals during the match. The win against Norwood qualified Port Adelaide for the 1945 SANFL Grand Final against West Torrens. During the first quarter of the 1945 SANFL Grand Final, Port Adelaide kicked a record quarter-time score for a SANFL Grand Final of 8.1 (51), which still stands today. However, this was not enough for Bunton to win his first premiership as a player with Port Adelaide, falling short by 13 points to West Torrens. The 1945 SANFL Grand Final would be Haydn Bunton Sr&#x27;s last match in senior football. Bunton would be awarded two Magarey Medal votes during his 17 games for Port Adelaide in 1945, thus achieving the rare feat of garnering votes in the VFL, WAFL, and SANFL.

==North Adelaide (1947 &amp; 1948)==

On Monday, 3 March 1947, the North Adelaide Football Club appointed Haydn Bunton as senior non-playing coach. North Adelaide finished in 6th position in 1947 and in 5th position in 1948. Bunton resigned as coach after the last home-and-away game in September 1948. North Adelaide Football Club went onto win the 1949 SANFL premiership, coached by Ken Farmer.

==Cricket career==
Haydn Bunton was the most outstanding batsman in the Albury and Border Cricket Association, with an average of 149 in the 1927/28 season and averaged 127 in 1928/29, and his services were sought by many Melbourne District Cricket Clubs.

In December 1928, Bunton (144), was involved in a 280-run, second-wicket partnership with William &quot;Cassie&quot; Andrews (146) from Maitland in a Sydney Country Week Cricket Carnival match on the Sydney Cricket Ground between a combined country week team and a combined Sydney first-grade team.

Bunton commenced playing Melbourne district cricket for the Fitzroy Cricket Club during the 1930/31 season and scored 104 against Prahran on Saturday, 9 January 1932. Bunton played for Fitzroy CC in their losing 1931/32 Melbourne District Cricket grand final against St. Kilda Cricket Club.

All up, he played 25 First XI games for Fitzroy CC between 1930/31 and 1933/34.

In 1944, while serving with the Australian Imperial Force, Bunton was stationed in Wallgrove, Sydney, and played cricket with the Petersham Cricket Club.

==Life outside football==
Bunton enlisted in the Australian Army in 1943, at Blackboy Hill, Perth and was assigned to the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps. At the time he was discharged, in April 1945, Bunton (service no. ) was serving with the 5th Motor Ambulance Convoy and held the substantive rank of corporal.

He spent the 1946 SANFL season as an SANFL football field umpire and earned a very good reputation in a very short time, umpiring the 1946 SANFL Preliminary Final, with many believing he was very stiff not to umpire the grand final the following week.

In 1949, 1950 and 1951, Bunton was the feature football writer for the Adelaide newspaper &quot;The Mail&quot;.

==Death and tributes==
On Thursday 1 September 1955, Bunton was critically injured when his car crashed into three gum trees north of Gawler, South Australia. He was alone in the car, and he was treated at the scene for severe head injuries, a punctured lung, a fractured collarbone, fractured ribs, and shock. On Saturday morning, two days later, he rallied slightly to encourage his son Haydn Jr. in an important match for that day, telling him: &quot;Go out and do your best, son.&quot; Bunton was declared dead on the night of Monday 5 September at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. He was buried at North Road Cemetery in Nailsworth, South Australia.

In 1996, Bunton was named at left forward pocket in the AFL Team of the Century, and he was made an inaugural legend in the Australian Football Hall of Fame.

Bunton was inducted into the Ovens &amp; Murray Football League Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Reputation==
During his playing career, Bunton was considered by fans of the sport as a player of integrity, who rarely if ever engaged in unduly rough play. His fame was enhanced by him having his own radio show on 3DB, and he had a Melbourne newspaper column when he played with Fitzroy. He later had radio programs in Perth and Adelaide. He was regarded as a sex symbol in the 1930s, and his looks were compared to those of film star Rudolf Valentino.

When Essendon legend Dick Reynolds won his first Brownlow Medal in 1934, Bunton, whom Reynolds had narrowly beaten to win the award, was the first person to telegraph his congratulations, a sporting gesture that Reynolds deeply appreciated.
During his period with Fitzroy, he was naturally a marked man, but almost perfect balance enabled him to keep out of trouble. He had uncanny ball sense and great speed, was a fine mark, and an accurate, if not outstanding, kick.
The Secretary of Fitzroy, J. Buckley, said of Bunton: &quot;Haydn was the greatest player ever to wear the Fitzroy jersey. He had unlimited stamina, courage, and was the quickest thinker I have ever seen.&quot; 
Bunton once played with Don Bradman in a New South Wales country cricket team; and, in the early 1930s, Bunton was regarded as a possible Test cricketer.

According to the family of Sir Doug Nicholls, Bunton was the only Fitzroy teammate to befriend Nicholls, the only Aboriginal VFL player at that time, during his playing career.

In 1999, historian and teacher Ken Mansell wrote &quot;The Ballad of Haydn Bunton&quot;, a song that highlighted Bunton&#x27;s great achievements.

==Family==

Bunton married Lylia Frances Austin at Scots&#x27; Church, Melbourne, on 22 February 1936.

Bunton had two sons: Haydn Bunton Jr., born in 1937, who would become a prominent footballer in his own right, and David.

In July 1945, Mrs. Bunton sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband&#x27;s misconduct with a certain Doreen May Scott, a member of the Australian Women&#x27;s Army Service (AWAS).

Bunton remarried Lylia Bunton at the Adelaide Registry Office on Saturday, 7 September 1946, in a closed secret ceremony.

Lylia died suddenly at home on 25 December 1954 at the age of 42, less than a year before her husband.

Bunton&#x27;s brother, Cleaver Bunton, was a long-serving mayor of Albury and also a senator for a short time in 1975. Cleaver was the first Ovens &amp; Murray Football League life member. Cleaver played in West Albury&#x27;s 1929 premiership team, was the O&amp;MFL treasurer 1953 to 1993, O&amp;MFL secretary 1930 to 1969 and again in 1976, founder and editor of &quot;The Critic&quot; from 1924 to 1990, the longest-serving administrator in Australian Rules Football history, founder of Albury Umpires Association, establisher of sporting broadcasts on radio, and was the first to broadcast Ovens &amp; Murray football; the O&amp;MFL club championship award is named after him.

<text>tcptrace is a free and open-source tool for analyzing TCP dump files. It accepts as input files produced by packet-capture programs, including tcpdump, Wireshark, and snoop.

tcptrace can produce several different types of output containing information on each connection seen, such as elapsed time, bytes and segments sent and received, retransmissions, round trip times, window advertisements, and throughput. It can also produce graphs for further analysis. As of version 5, minimal UDP processing has been implemented in addition to the TCP capabilities.

<text>Earl Beauchamp () was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The peerage was created in 1815 for William Lygon, 1st Baron Beauchamp, along with the subsidiary title Viscount Elmley, in the County of Worcester. He had already been created Baron Beauchamp of Powyke in the County of Worcester, in 1806, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Beauchamp had previously represented Worcestershire in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl, who also sat as Member of Parliament for Worcestershire. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. In 1813 he assumed by royal licence the surname of Pyndar in lieu of Lygon. On his death in 1853 the titles passed to his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He was a General in the Army as well as a Member of Parliament.

The fourth earl’s second but eldest surviving son, the fifth earl, represented Worcestershire West in Parliament. He died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Earl. He was a Conservative politician and held office in the 1870s and 1880s under Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury. His eldest son, the seventh Earl, was in contrast to his father a prominent Liberal politician and served under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith. He was also Governor of New South Wales. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the eighth Earl. He was also a politician. On Lord Beauchamp&#x27;s death in 1979 the titles became extinct.
The Earls Beauchamp were descended from Richard Lygon (pronounced &quot;Liggon&quot;, ), of Madresfield Court, Worcestershire, who married the Hon. Anne (died 1535), second daughter and co-heir of Richard Beauchamp, 2nd Baron Beauchamp &quot;of Powyke&quot; (1435–1503) (see Baron Beauchamp, the fifth creation (&quot;of Powyke&quot;)), and through the latter from the early Earls of Warwick. Their descendant, William Lygon (1642–1721), also resided at Madresfield. His daughter, Margaret (died 1734), married as her first husband Reginald Pyndar (c. 1687–1721), of Kempley, Gloucestershire. Their son Reginald Pyndar (1712–1788) changed his surname to Lygon in lieu of Pyndar, by a private act of Parliament,  (9 Geo. 2. c. &quot;21&quot; ). His son was the first Earl Beauchamp.

The ancestral family seat of the Lygon family was Madresfield Court, near Malvern, Worcestershire. It is currently the home of Jonathan and Lucy Chenevix-Trench, the 29th generation in descent to live at Madresfield, since 2012. Lucy Chenevix-Trench is the younger daughter of the Hon. Lady Morrison (nee Rosalind Lygon), a niece of the 8th and last Earl Beauchamp and the younger daughter of the late Hon. Richard Lygon (1916–1970), the youngest son of the 7th Earl by his wife, the former Lady Lettice Grosvenor. Rosalind Morrison inherited Madresfield Court in 1990 after the death of Mona Lygon, Countess Beauchamp, widow of the 8th and last Earl (d 1979). She took up residence around 1993 with her daughters and two surviving aunts, Lady Sibell Rowley and Lady Dorothy Heber-Percy. The house has been extensively restored by the Chenevix-Trenches and has been the subject of articles in &quot;Tatler&quot; and the Daily Mail.

*William Lygon, 1st Earl Beauchamp (1747–1816)

<text>Winchcombeshire was an ancient county in the South West of England, in the Anglo-Saxon period, with Winchcombe as its county town. The county originated in the shiring of Mercia in the tenth or early eleventh centuries, perhaps by King Edward the Elder in the early 920s. It was merged into Gloucestershire in the early eleventh century, probably by King Cnut in 1017.

<text>Helen Magill White (November 28, 1853 – October 28, 1944) was an American classicist and academic. She was the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States.

==Early life and education==
Helen Magill was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Edward Hicks Magill and Sarah Warner Beans. She was the eldest of six children in a Quaker family. Magill was brought up to believe that she deserved the same education as a man and all five Magill daughters were educated to become college teachers. In 1859, the family moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where Magill enrolled as the only female student in the Boston Public Latin School. Her father taught French and Latin there for three years, and he was promoted to submaster.

In 1869, Magill&#x27;s father joined the faculty of the new Swarthmore College which was founded by Quakers in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. Magill enrolled as an undergraduate. In 1871 her father was selected as the college&#x27;s second president, serving for 17 years. The younger Magill graduated as a member of the Class of 1873, Swarthmore&#x27;s first graduating class (five women and one man).

Magill attended graduate school at Boston University, earning her Ph.D. in Greek in 1877. She was the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States. Magill traveled to England, studying at the University of Cambridge. Due to an illness, Magill received only a third rank in her 1881 tripos honors examinations at Newnham College, which negatively impacted her academic career.

Magill&#x27;s dissertation, &quot;The Greek Drama&quot;, was long considered lost, but in 2018 it was found in her papers in the Rare Book and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library.

==Career==
After serving as the principal for a year at a private school in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Magill was selected on the recommendation of Edward Everett Hale to organize Howard Collegiate Institute in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts in 1883. Howard was a non-sectarian school for about forty women and Magill had the authority to choose teachers and conduct college courses. Magill&#x27;s father contributed funds for a laboratory and gymnasium and two of Magill&#x27;s sisters taught courses. Although the school expanded rapidly (and therefore needed a new building to accommodate students), Magill resigned in 1887 due to family reasons and due to a dispute with the trustees over her campaign for the provision of better sewerage.

Magill taught for a short amount of time at Evelyn College for Women, a women&#x27;s annex to Princeton University. Suffering from an illness, she taught physical geography at Brooklyn High School for a few years.

==Personal life==
Helen Magill met Andrew D. White in 1887 while she was presenting a paper about her time at Newnham College at the American Social Science Association. A college classmate of Magill&#x27;s father, White was retired from his many years as first president of Cornell University. He had been widowed that year. White described Magill and her paper in his diary as:&quot;Perfect manner &amp; exquisite voice – altogether a triumph for this little Quakeress – daughter of my college mate Magill – of which I am proud.&quot;White encouraged Magill to apply for the post of Director of Sage College for Women at Cornell University. Magill however had been shaken by her experience of directorship of the Howard Collegiate Institute and depression and illness kept her at home for some time. While teaching at Brooklyn High School, Magill maintained a correspondence with White where she commented on her perceived failings:&quot;but it makes me miserable sometimes to think what I might have already done, if I had produced more and criticized less.&quot; (May 15th 1888)Magill and White married in September 1890, and had three children, Edward Magill White (died 1896), Hilda White (1891–1892), and Karin Andreevna White (1893–1971).

Magill accompanied her husband when he was appointed to diplomatic posts in St. Petersburg (1892–94) and Berlin (1897–1903). Magill was presented at both courts and was a noted conversationalist, discussing architecture, sculpture, music, and literature with Kaisar Wilhelm II. Following the family&#x27;s return to the United States, Magill did not participate in public or academic life any further.

After Andrew D. White died in 1918, Magill lived abroad and in Ithaca, New York. She retired to Kittery Point, Maine, where she died in 1944.

==Other pursuits==
Helen Magill White published a letter in 1913 explaining her refusal to donate to a women&#x27;s suffrage organization. However, some historians believe she was expressing her opposition to the actions of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union in England, rather than to the suffrage cause. The Union&#x27;s militant acts included burning churches, bombing homes, and sending letter bombs to public officials.

<text>SimFarm: SimCity&#x27;s Country Cousin is a video game in which players build and manage a virtual farm. It was developed by Maxis and released in 1993 as a spin-off of &quot;SimCity&quot;. The game included a teacher&#x27;s guide to teaching with &quot;SimFarm&quot; with blackline masters to be photocopied for the class and a user manual. In 1996, &quot;SimFarm&quot; and several other Maxis simulation games were rereleased under the &quot;Maxis Collector Series&quot;, with greater compatibility with Windows 95 and differing box art, including the addition of &quot;Classics&quot; beneath the title.

== Gameplay ==
Simulating duties on a real farm in the contiguous United States, &quot;SimFarm&quot; puts players in charge of building up the land, placing the buildings, buying and selling livestock and planting crops. A weather and season system are in place as well, presenting the same kind of challenges found in a real-world farm. As with &quot;SimCity&quot;, there are disasters that can wreak havoc on the player&#x27;s farm. Tornadoes, droughts, pests, and dust storms are some of the events that can disrupt farm crops and harvests. There are four types of livestock in &quot;SimFarm&quot;, all of which have specific food requirements, need water, and breed new livestock. Animals&#x27; value can be increased by making a barn available for their use.

&quot;SimFarm&quot; also has a small town included in its simulation. This town is reminiscent of &quot;SimCity&quot; in its form and function. The player may interact with the town occasionally by suggesting new tile types and joining competitions with livestock (such as sending in a prize pig to potentially earn a blue ribbon and a cash prize). Suggesting that an airport be built in the town will usually cause its construction, thus unlocking the ability to buy and use a crop duster.

The homestead in &quot;SimFarm&quot; is where the player lives; it is expanded at the beginning of each game year if the player has made enough money in the previous year. &quot;SimFarm&quot; allows the player to choose a location derived from the region and climate of one of nine areas of the US or to design one&#x27;s own climate by selecting average winds, rainfall, and temperatures.

Equipment is necessary to maintain your farm and bring your crops to harvest. Structures store equipment, livestock, seeds, etc. The minimum equipment required to bring one field to harvest is one tractor, one planter, one plow, one harvester, one truck, and one trailer. The crops are the main revenue-raising item in &quot;SimFarm&quot;. All crops have specific maturity cycles, water requirements, temperature requirements, and resistance to pests, weeds, and diseases. Each crop type must be grown in a season that meets these requirements, and managed according to its needs, in order to produce a high-value crop.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1993 approved of the game&#x27;s graphics and documentation. The magazine concluded that &quot;it&#x27;s not perfect, but learning how to &quot;SimFarm&quot; is a lot of fun&quot;. Despite giving an overall fun rating of 74%, &quot;PC Games&quot; expressed disdain for the game&#x27;s monotony, further stating, &quot;On the packaging they advertise it as &#x27;Sim City&#x27;s Country Cousin&#x27;, and you should not expect anything more from this program.&quot;

<text>Christopher Fairfield Edley Jr. (January 13, 1953 – May 10, 2024) was an American lawyer and the Dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law from 2004 to 2013. He served as President of The Opportunity Institute, an organization he co-founded with Ann O&#x27;Leary in 2016.

==Early life==
Edley was born on January 13, 1953, to Christopher F. Edley Sr., President of the United Negro College Fund, and Zaida Coles Edley, an actress and speech therapist. He was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and New Rochelle, New York.

== Career ==
Edley was a leading figure in Democratic policy circles for four decades, serving as a senior member of five presidential campaigns, as an economic policy and budget official under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, and as a chair of the Obama-Biden transition team. In 2011 he was appointed by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan as co-chair of the congressionally chartered National Commission on Equity and Excellence in Education.

Edley completed his undergraduate studies in mathematics at Swarthmore College, later serving on its Board of Managers, a position which his father had also held. Edley next attended Harvard Law School, becoming a professor of Administrative Law. Working with Gary Orfield, Edley founded the Harvard Civil Rights Project.

Edley served as an advisor to President Clinton&#x27;s One America Initiative, was a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and chaired President Clinton&#x27;s 1998 Affirmative Action Review. In the 2008 presidential election, he supported and advised candidate Barack Obama, one of his former students at Harvard Law School.

Having served since 2004, Edley resigned as Dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law at the end of 2013 to undergo treatment for prostate cancer. In 2016, he returned to teaching law at Berkeley and served as interim dean of the UC Berkeley School of Education between 2021 and 2023.

According to legal journalist Emily Bazelon, Edley &quot;has written thoughtfully and moderately about affirmative action.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Following two divorces, Edley married Maria Echaveste, the former deputy chief of staff for U.S. President Bill Clinton. He died from complications of surgery in Stanford, California on May 10, 2024, at the age of 71.

<doc id="803434" wikidata="Q2625844" url="?curid=803434" title="Earl of Orford">
<text>Earl of Orford is a title that has been created three times.

The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1697 when the naval commander Admiral of the Fleet Edward Russell was made Earl of Orford, in the County of Suffolk. He was created Baron of Shingay, in the County of Cambridge, and Viscount Barfleur at the same time, also in the Peerage of England. A member of the influential Russell family, he was the son of the Honourable Edward Russell, a younger son of Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford and younger brother of William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford (see Duke of Bedford for earlier history of the Russell family). Lord Orford had no children and the titles became extinct on his death in 1727.

The title was created again in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1742 for Robert Walpole, &quot;de facto&quot; acknowledged to have been the first Prime Minister of Great Britain, who at the same time was created Viscount Walpole and Baron Walpole of Houghton. At the time, the family seat was Houghton Hall, which was owned and commissioned by Robert Walpole. The titles became extinct on the death of the 4th Earl in 1797.

It was created a third time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1806 for Horatio Walpole, 4th Baron Walpole of Walpole, a cousin of the 4th Earl of the 2nd creation. The title became extinct in 1931.

<text>Inge Meysel (; 30 May 1910 – 10 July 2004) was a German actress. From the early 1960s until her death, Meysel was one of Germany&#x27;s most popular actresses. She had a successful stage career and played more than 100 roles in film and on television.

== Life and work ==
Born Ingeborg Charlotte Hansen, the daughter of Anna Hansen, who was Danish, and Julius Meysel, a German Jew. She attended drama schools in Berlin from 1928 until 1930, thereafter she was on stage in Zwickau, Leipzig and Berlin.

During Nazi Germany, Meysel was banned from performing from 1935 until 1945 because of her Jewish father. In 1945 she restarted her career in Hamburg.

Since the early 1960s Inge Meysel mainly acted in made-for-TV films and got the nickname &quot;(Fernseh-) Mutter der Nation&quot; (&quot;(Television) Mother of the Nation&quot;).

She won numerous German actor awards including a lifetime achievement award from the German Television Awards, but in 1981 she refused to accept the Bundesverdienstkreuz because &quot;Einen Orden dafür, daß man anständig gelebt hat, brauche ich nicht&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t need an order of merit just for having lived decently&quot;).

From the mid-1920s until shortly before her death, Meysel was outspoken on many – often controversial – social and political issues. Despite her decidedly leftist and feminist views, this did not harm her popularity as an actress. In 1992, she came out as bisexual.

In 2004, aged 94, she died of heart failure at her home in Bullenhausen near Hamburg. She was cremated and her ashes were buried near her second husband the Austrian film producer (1918–1965) at Ohlsdorf Main Cemetery, Hamburg.

<text>The following is the 1978–79 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1978 through August 1979. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1977–78 season. All times are Eastern and Pacific, with certain exceptions, such as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

New fall series are highlighted in bold. Series ending their original runs are in &quot;italics&quot;.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary.

<doc id="803458" wikidata="Q5448379" url="?curid=803458" title="Filename mangling">
<text>The process of filename mangling, in computing, involves a translation of the file name for compatibility at the operating system level. It occurs when a filename on a filesystem appears in a form incompatible with the operating system accessing it. Such mangling occurs, for example, on computer networks when a Windows machine attempts to access a file on a Unix server and that file has a filename which includes characters not valid in Windows.

==FAT Derivative Filesystem==
===Legacy support under VFAT===

A common example of name mangling occurs on VFAT file systems on versions of Windows from Windows 95 onwards. The VFAT specification allows Long File Names (LFNs). For backwards-compatibility with MS-DOS and older Windows software, which recognizes filenames of a maximum of 11 characters in length with 8.3 format (i.e.: an eight-letter filename, a dot and a three-letter extension, such as codice_1), files with LFNs get stored on disk in 8.3 format (codice_2 becoming codice_3), with the long file name stored elsewhere on the disk.

Normally, when using compatible Windows programs which use standard Windows methods of reading the disk, the I/O subsystem returns the long filename to the program — however, if an old DOS application or an old Windows application tries to address the file, it will use the older, 8.3-only APIs, or work at a lower level and perform its own disk access, which results in the return of an 8.3 filename. In this case, the filenames become mangled by taking the first six non-space characters in the filename and adding a tilde (~) and then a number to ensure the uniqueness of the 8.3 filename on the disk. This mangling scheme can turn (for example) codice_4 into codice_5. This technique persists today when people use DOSBox to play classic DOS games or use Windows 3.1 in conjunction to play Win16 games on 64-bit Windows.

==Unix Filesystems==
Unix file names can contain colons or backslashes, whereas Windows interprets such characters in other ways. Accordingly, software could mangle the Unix file &quot;Notes: 11\04\03&quot; as &quot;Notes_ 11-04-03&quot; to enable Windows software to remotely access the file. Other Unix-like systems, such as Samba on Unix, use different mangling systems to map long filenames to DOS-compatible filenames (although Samba administrators can configure this behavior in the config file).

==Mac OS==

macOS&#x27;s Finder displays instances of &quot;:&quot; in file and directory names with a &quot;/&quot;. This is because the classic Mac OS used the &quot;:&quot; character internally as a path separator. Listing these files or directories using a terminal emulator displays a &quot;:&quot; rather than the &quot;/&quot; character, though.

<text>Otto Boeddicker (1853–1937) was a German astronomer. In 1880 he became the astronomical assistant of Lawrence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse at Birr Castle in Birr, Ireland, and remained in that position until the death of the Earl in 1908. 

He published drawings of naked-eye observations of the Milky Way in 1892, made over a period of six years. He also observed the Moon, including the emitted heat during the total lunar eclipse of 28 January 1888. His drawings of Jupiter were published in the Scientific Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society in 1889. His drawings of Mars were published in &quot;La planète Mars&quot; by Camille Flammarion. 

He left for Germany in 1916 after being designated an enemy alien.

A crater on Mars is named in his honor.

<text>&quot;&quot; (, ; ) is the national anthem of Georgia. It was adopted as the Georgian national anthem in May 2004, along with a new national flag and coat of arms. The symbols&#x27; change was brought about upon the successful overthrow of the previous government in the bloodless Rose Revolution. The music, taken from the Georgian operas &quot;Abesalom da Eteri&quot; (&quot;Abesalom and Eteri&quot;) and &quot;Daisi&quot; (&quot;The Nightfall&quot;), by the Georgian composer Zacharia Paliashvili (), was adapted by Ioseb Kechakmadze () to form the anthem. The lyrics were composed by David Magradze ().

== History ==
The current Georgian national anthem was adopted by the Parliament of Georgia on 20 May 2004, exactly five months after the resignation of President Eduard Shevardnadze in the Rose Revolution. A bill was introduced in the first plenary meeting of the sixth convocation of the Georgian Parliament on 22 April 2004. The bill to adopt &quot;Tavisupleba&quot; as Georgia&#x27;s national anthem was presented by the Minister of Culture Giorgi Gabashvili; in which the music was played for the deputies soon afterwards. The law does not give any regulations, but refers to the corresponding Presidential Decree.

&quot;Tavisupleba&quot; succeeded the old national anthem &quot;Dideba&quot;, which was in use by the Democratic Republic of Georgia from 1918 to 1921, and again by the newly independent (from the Soviet Union) Georgia from 1990 to 2004.

The new national anthem quickly gained popularity in contrast to its predecessor, whose lyrics were somewhat archaic and difficult to memorize.

During U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s visit to Georgia in May 2005, he along with President Mikheil Saakashvili was addressing tens of thousands of Georgians in Freedom Square, Tbilisi when a recording of &quot;Tavisupleba&quot; failed to play properly. Saakashvili then motioned to the choirs, and thousands in the crowd joined the singers in singing it, a moment which was described by media as &quot;the most powerful moment of the day&quot;.

== Music ==
The music of &quot;Tavisupleba&quot; was adapted from two Georgian operas, &quot;Abesalom da Eteri&quot; (1918) and &quot;Daisi&quot; (1923), composed by Zacharia Paliashvili, the father of the Georgian classical music genre.

== Lyrics ==
=== Georgian original ===
=== Abkhaz version ===
=== English translation ===
:Our icon is the homeland
:Trust in God is our creed,
:Enlightened land of plains and mounts,
:Blessed by God and holy heaven.

:Freedom we have learnt to follow
:Makes our future spirits stronger,
:The dawn star will rise above us
:And lighten up the land between the two seas.

:Glory to long-cherished freedom,
:Glory to liberty!

== Regulations ==
According to the Regulations for the Parliament of Georgia, Chapter 3, Article 4.5., the national anthem of Georgia is played at the opening and closing of each session. It is also performed following the signing of the Oath of the Parliamentarian after the Parliament recognizes the authority of at least two-thirds of its newly elected members (Chapter 25, Article 124.7). The anthem is also played prior to the annual report of the President of Georgia to the Parliament.

Georgian Public Broadcaster airs a music video version of the anthem, featuring opera singer Paata Burchuladze.

<text>The Scottish Refugee Council is a registered charity that provides advice and services to asylum seekers and refugees. The objective of the organisation is ‘building a better future with refugees in Scotland’.

The charity was formed in Edinburgh in 1985 but moved to Glasgow in 1999 as the city became one of the main dispersal areas for refugees. Its remit has expanded over time in response to growing demand for its services and is now the leading charity for refugees in Scotland.

In 2011 the organisation celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Refugee Convention. In recognition of the international convention that underpins the Scottish Refugee Council&#x27;s work, the charity produced a short film, &quot;Courage: 60 years of the UN Refugee Convention&quot;.

==History==
Scottish Refugee Council was established in 1985 in response to a growing need for assistance for refugees in Scotland. It was set up with the help of the British Refugee Council (now Refugee Council) and London-based Refugee Action and was operated by a small team of staff and volunteers. The organisation was originally based in Edinburgh where demand was greatest. In its early stages it primarily worked with refugees from Chile and Vietnam, helping with asylum claims, understanding the welfare system and getting access to housing and education.

During the 1990s the Scottish Refugee Council expanded because of international events and a need for more comprehensive refugee services. One major new development during this time was the 1993 establishment of a reception centre for Bosnians who faced persecution and ethnic cleansing in Serbian concentration camps. In 1999, in response to the escalating crisis in Kosovo, the Scottish Refugee Council worked with the Refugee Action, UNHCR and other partners to set up reception centres as part of a humanitarian evacuation programme. The Scottish Refugee Council was at the forefront in helping these refugees settle and integrate into Scottish society. In 2000 the focus changed from resettlement to helping people return safely or make claims for asylum.

The Immigration and Asylum Act (1999) established Glasgow as one of the largest refugee dispersal centres in the UK. This led to a significant increase in the number of people seeking asylum in Scotland. Following this change, the Scottish Refugee Council faced a 20-fold increase in the size of its client base. At this time it was necessary for the organisation to relocate to Glasgow. When its Glasgow-based advice centre was opened in 1999 it delivered 250 advice sessions per week. By 2001 this had grown to 150 sessions per day. The centre was located within the Cadogan Square complex in Glasgow city centre for 14 years. In December 2017, Scottish Refugee Council moved offices to 6th Floor, Portland House, 17 Renfield Street, G2 5AH.

With the dispersal system came challenges to integration and racial tension. One tragic result of this was the fatal stabbing of Firsat Yildiz, a young Turkish Kurd who had recently been dispersed to Glasgow. Following this the Scottish Refugee Council helped to establish the Refugee Integration Forum to lead a community approach to improving the lives of refugees and asylum seekers.

Sabir Zazai was appointed as Chief Executive of Scottish Refugee Council in September 2017. 
Sabir arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker in 1999 from Afghanistan.

Sabir has a wealth of knowledge in refugee integration that is informed by his personal experiences of going through the asylum system and his research and campaigning background in this area. His policy and research work in refugee integration focuses on community cohesion management, integration and social relations.

Dr Alison Phipps UNESCO Chair in Refugee Integration through Languages and the Arts at the University of Glasgow is an Ambassador for the Scottish Refugee Council.

==Principles==

In 1995, on the 10th anniversary of its founding, Nelson Mandela became a patron of the Scottish Refugee Council. He said:

&quot;I am delighted to be associated with the Scottish Refugee Council&#x27;s aims of protection and resettlement of refugees in Scotland and I wish you every success in achieving these aims.&quot;

Scottish Refugee Council States its vision as: &quot;a Scotland in which all people seeking refugee protection are welcome. It is a place where women, children and men are protected, find safety and support, have their human rights and dignity respected and are able to achieve their full potential.&quot;

Its mission is to increase public understanding of refugees and campaign for an end to discrimination, racism and prejudice. Part of this involves supporting refugees’ integration and inclusion, ensuring refugee voices are heeded. It also lobbies for the rights of refugees and people seeking asylum and for changes in legislation and policies. It exists to ensure that refugees and people seeking asylum have access to quality advice services, information and support and to provide these services as an efficient organisation, ensuring quality and value for money.

==Work==
There are three main areas in which Scottish Refugee Council works to help refugees and people seeking asylum in Scotland.

===Service provision===
Scottish Refugee Council provides a number of direct services to refugees and asylum seekers. It helps refugees deal with issues of integration, housing and finances through its Refugee Integration Service. It also assists families with children aged 0–8 years who have recently entered the asylum system through its Family Keywork Service.

===Campaigning and influencing===
Scottish Refugee Council is also actively involved in campaigning and influencing public policy. In conjunction with bodies such as the Refugee Council, Scottish Refugee Council influences policy at Westminster and the Scottish Parliament. To inform its policy work the organisation regularly conducts research, co-ordinating both in-house projects and collaborating with leading researchers in the field of asylum. The charity also focuses on working with the media to broaden public understanding of the issues facing refugees.

===Community and partnership===
Networking and partnership-building is also important to Scottish Refugee Council. It works closely with other refugee agencies in the UK, including the Refugee Council, the Refugee Survival Trust, and Scottish Detainee Visitors. It also has international links with UNHCR and is part of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE). Scottish Refugee Council also plays a part in community development, supporting refugee community organisations in Scotland, helping refugees tell their stories to the media, and involving them in policy discussions with politicians and service providers. It is a member of the Asylum Support Partnership along with the Refugee Council England, the Welsh Refugee Council, Refugee Action, Northern Refugee Centre, and the North of England Refugee Service.

== Refugee Festival Scotland ==
One of the organisation&#x27;s primary calendar events is Refugee Festival Scotland. The event, co-ordinated by Scottish Refugee Council and coincides with World Refugee Day, is the Scottish version of an annual UK wide programme of events for Refugee Week which celebrates the contribution of refugees to the UK. During Refugee Festival Scotland, hundreds of events exploring refugee experiences take place across Scotland. These range from small community and school activities to art exhibitions, political debates, film festivals, music festivals and sports events.

Refugee Festival Scotland took place in 2017 on Tuesday 20 June – Sunday 2 July.

== Funding cuts ==
The work of Scottish Refugee Council was affected following funding cuts introduced by the UK Border Agency in 2011. Funding to the One Stop Service, which provides advice to asylum seekers and refugees, was cut by 62%, while the grant for the organisation&#x27;s work in orientation and support services was cut by 50%. Overall Scottish Refugee Council entered 2011/12 financial year with 30% less funding. This led to a major restructure of the organisation and its services in order to secure the future of the charity.

In its response to the funding reductions, John Wilkes, Chief Executive Officer of the Scottish Refugee Council issued a statement saying: &quot;Savage cuts to the refugee charity sector will force people who have already fled torture, conflict and persecution in their own countries to suffer even further while seeking safety in the UK.&quot;

<text>Julius Adams Stratton (May 18, 1901 – June 22, 1994) was an American electrical engineer, physicist, and university administrator known for his contributions in applied electromagnetism. He attended the University of Washington for one year, where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity, then transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), from which he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1923 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1926 both in electrical engineering. He then followed graduate studies in Europe and the Technische Hochschule of Zürich (ETH Zurich), Switzerland, awarded him the degree of Doctor of Science in 1928.

== Professional biography ==

Stratton was appointed Assistant Professor in Electrical Engineering Department at MIT after his PhD. In 1930 his appointment was transferred to the Physics Department. He was promoted to Professor in 1941. He was one of the first staff members of the MIT Radiation Laboratory who joined the Laboratory in 1940.

He published the classic book &quot;Electromagnetic Theory&quot; as part of the McGraw Hill series in Pure and Applied Physics in 1941. Stratton&#x27;s book was one of the most influential electromagnetic textbooks which had formed an integral part of the graduate electromagnetic educations of both physics and electrical engineering communities since its publication. John David Jackson described Stratton&#x27;s book as his bible and said that he used Stratton&#x27;s book to learn advanced electromagnetism. Stratton&#x27;s book also described by Julian Schwinger as one of the essential electromagnetic textbooks. In 2007 Stratton&#x27;s book had been reissued by the IEEE as one of its classic reissues in the collection of The IEEE Press Series on Electromagnetic Wave Theory. Stratton&#x27;s book was one of the most requested classic electromagnetic textbook for reissuing in electrical engineering community. According to Donald G. Dudley then series editor of The IEEE Press Series on Electromagnetic Wave Theory, over twelve years before reissued publication of textbook in 2007, he had received many requests worldwide to reissue Stratton&#x27;s book.

Stratton was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1946. In the same year he was awarded the Medal for Merit for his services. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1950 and the American Philosophical Society in 1956. He served as the president of MIT between 1959 and 1966, after serving the university in several lesser posts, notably appointments to provost in 1949, vice president in 1951, and chancellor in 1956.

In the 1955–1965 he served as member of Board of Trustees, RAND Corporation. He also served as the chairman of the Ford Foundation between 1964 and 1971.

In 1967, Stratton was seconded to chair a Congressionally established &quot;Commission on Marine Sciences, Engineering and Resources&quot; whose work culminated in a report, &quot;Our Nation and the Sea&quot;, published in 1969, that had a major influence on ocean sciences and management in the United States and abroad. The commission itself became commonly referred to as the Stratton Commission.

Stratton was also a founding member of the National Academy of Engineering.

Stratton collected his speeches in a 1966 book titled &quot;Science and the Educated Man: Selected Speeches of Julius A. Stratton&quot; (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1966), with a foreword by the historian of technology Elting E. Morison who had been on the faculty of MIT as a professor of humanities in the Sloan School of Industrial Management from 1946 to 1966.

MIT&#x27;s Julius Adams Stratton Student Center at 84 Massachusetts Avenue is named in his honor.

<doc id="803531" wikidata="Q3273127" url="?curid=803531" title="Manoa">
<text>Manoa (, ; ) is a valley on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. It is a residential neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii. The neighborhood is approximately three miles (5 km) east and inland from downtown Honolulu and less than a mile (1600 m) from Ala Moana and Waikiki.

== Neighborhood ==

Similar to many Honolulu neighborhoods, Mānoa consists of an entire valley, running from Manoa Falls at the mauka (inland-most) end to King Street. The valley receives almost daily rain, even during the dry season, and is thus richly vegetated – though the valley walls are often dry. Seeing rainbows in the valley is a common occurrence, and is the source of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa sports team names, the Rainbow Warriors (for men&#x27;s teams) and Rainbow Wahine (for the women, with the beach volleyball team more often using BeachBows).

The neighborhood is composed of private houses built before the 1960s and low-rise condominiums. Mānoa is home to the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, the flagship campus of the University of Hawaiʻi System. The university has several faculty and student residence areas in Mānoa.

Other educational institutions located in Mānoa include Manoa Elementary School, Noelani Elementary School, Punahou School, the Mid-Pacific Institute, Saint Francis School, and a handful of small, private preschools.

The central shopping area of Mānoa is the Mānoa Marketplace which features a farmer&#x27;s market several days of the week. More recent development has seen housing on steeper parts of the Diamond Head side valley wall.

== Geography ==
&quot;Mānoa&quot; means &quot;thick&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;vast&quot;, &quot;depth,&quot; or &quot;thickness&quot; in the Hawaiian language. There is another valley named Mānoa on the north shore of Kauaʻi.

Mānoa Stream begins at the base of Mānoa Falls and runs through the valley before joining the Palolo Stream to form the Mānoa-Palolo drainage canal, which flows into the Ala Wai Canal. Floods caused by high rainfall have plagued the residents living along Mānoa Stream. Most recent was on October 30, 2004, when Mānoa Stream overflowed causing millions of dollars in damages to residential homes and University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa buildings.

===Climate===
== History ==
Mānoa was the site of the first sugarcane and coffee plantations in the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiian coffee was first introduced along Mānoa Valley in 1813 by Don Francisco de Paula y Marytin as an ornamental plant. In 1825 Chief Boki, the Royal Governor of Oahu, followed up and brought coffee trees back from Brazil on the ship .

Chief Boki also chose Mānoa Valley as the historic birth site of the very first coffee plantation in Hawaii. With the aid of an agriculture expert, John Wilkinson, the coffee trees were able to survive which allowed its descendants to be brought over to Kona and other islands many years later. 
Hawaiʻi is the only state in the United States that produces coffee commercially. For more history see coffee production in Hawaii.

There are many legends associated with Mānoa. In one legend, Kahalaopuna was born to Kahaukani and Kauakuahine. Kahaukani is the wind of Mānoa and Kauakuahine is the rain of Mānoa. Kakaukani and Kauakuahine were brother and sister, both born to Akaaka (the projecting spur of the Mānoa mountain range) and Nalehuaakaaka (the lehua on the brow of the Mānoa ridge).

==Education==
Hawaii Department of Education operates public schools in Mānoa, which is also home to the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.

The private Saint Francis School was in Mānoa until its 2019 closure.

<text>Samuel Wesley Stratton (July 18, 1861 – October 18, 1931) was an administrator in the American government, physicist, and educator. A physicist by training, Stratton proposed the U.S. Bureau of Standards and was appointed its first director by President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1923, he moved to Boston to become the eighth president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a position he held for seven years.

== Life and work ==
Stratton was born on farm in Litchfield, Illinois on July 18, 1861. In his youth he kept farm machinery in repair and worked as a mechanic and carpenter. He worked his way through Illinois Industrial University at Urbana (later the University of Illinois), receiving his bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering in 1884. He became an instructor in mathematics and physics following his graduation, and in 1889, when Physics department head Theodore B. Comstock, Professor of Mining Engineering and Physics, inexplicably failed to return to campus after the summer vacation, Stratton was appointed head of the Department of Physics by regent Selim Hobart Peabody. As Physics head, Stratton organized a formal curriculum in electrical engineering, which was taught in the Physics Department until a separate department of electrical engineering was established in 1898. Stratton moved to the University of Chicago in 1892 as Assistant Professor of Physics, then Associate Professor in 1895 and Professor in 1898.

Stratton served in the Illinois Naval Militia from 1895, as a lieutenant in the Navy in the Spanish–American War, and from 1904 to 1912 served as commander in charge of the Naval Militia in the District of Columbia.

In 1899 he was asked to head the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey&#x27;s Office of Weights and Measures, where he developed the plan for the establishment of a bureau of standards. He won the support for his plans from Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage and in March 1901, President William McKinley appointed him the first director of the National Bureau of Standards. He served until 1923. Under his leadership it grew from 24 to 900 employees scattered over 14 buildings. His operation was designed to recruit recent college graduates, train them, and feed them into private industry and its higher salaries. His team was called &quot;lowest-paid corps of first-rank scientists ever assembled by any government.&quot; The Bureau worked hand in glove with industry to undertake research that the private sector required but could not finance itself. 

In 1904, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal of The Franklin Institute in 1912. In 1917 Stratton was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. In 1922, he was elected an Honorary Member of The Optical Society.

His boss, then Secretary of Commerce (later President) Herbert Hoover had used the occasion of Stratton&#x27;s departure from government service as an opportunity to bemoan the low salaries paid to government scientists.


Note that the Stratton Student Center on the MIT campus is dedicated to a different former president of MIT, Julius Adams Stratton.

In January 1923 he became the eighth president of M.I.T. and served for seven years. In his inaugural address he said: &quot;The terms pure and applied science have not the same distinction as formerly. The same men, methods and equipment are involved in getting at the facts, whether they are needed in solving problems in industry or in extending our knowledge of principles. There are few cases of the latter that do not find immediate application.&quot; Tying education to industry, he said that industry that had once been slow to seize upon scientific advances was now demanding them. As recounted by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;he demonstrated the economic wisdom of generous support for research in pure science. He said that the automotive industry must find a substitute for gasoline, on which the elder Edison commented that the electric storage battery has already filled the bill. Edison looks for all transportation and industry to be electrified.&quot;

In 1927, he served as one of three members as an Advisory Committee to Massachusetts Governor Alvan T. Fuller, along with President Abbott Lawrence Lowell of Harvard and Probate Judge Robert Grant. They were tasked with reviewing the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti to determine whether the trial had been fair. Stratton, the one member who was not a Boston Brahmin, maintained the lowest public profile of the three committee members and hardly spoke during its hearings.

Upon his retirement in 1930 he became the first chairman of the MIT Corporation under a new plan of organization that he had devised. A lifelong bachelor, Stratton belonged to numerous private clubs. The carpentry he learned in his youth remained a lifelong hobby.

France made him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1909, and he received honorary degrees from the University of Cambridge and Yale University among others.

On October 18, 1931, he died of heart disease at his home in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay while dictating a tribute to his friend Thomas Edison, who died earlier in the day.

He is buried at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in Altadena, California.

The Commerce Department&#x27;s National Institute of Standards and Technology, formerly the National Bureau of Standards, has presented the Samuel Wesley Stratton Award annually since 1962 for outstanding scientific or engineering achievements in support of the objectives of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

<doc id="803536" wikidata="Q948099" url="?curid=803536" title="P45 (tax)">
<text>In the United Kingdom, and formerly in Ireland, a P45 is the reference code of a document titled &quot;Details of employee leaving work&quot;. The term is used in British and Irish slang as a metonym for termination of employment. The equivalent slang term in the United States is &quot;pink slip&quot;.

A P45 is issued by the employer when an employee leaves work.

A P45 is also issued by a pension provider when one claims their pension savings held with the pension provider. When one takes out their entire pension fund as a lump sum, a part of this amount will be considered taxable earnings, and this will need to be reported to HMRC. In such cases, one receives a P45 from the pension provider for their record. This can also be passed on to a new employer if the person continues to work.

==In the United Kingdom==
In the UK, the front section, Part 1, is given by the old employer to HM Revenue and Customs, who then record the pay and tax details on to the individual&#x27;s taxpayer record. Part 1A is to be retained by the employee, Part 2 retained by the new employer, and Part 3 taken by the new employer and sent to their tax office. The P45 contains details of earnings and tax paid during the tax year (tax paid in previous years is detailed on the P60 for that year).

The &quot;P&quot; code refers to documents in the PAYE series, in the same way that self-assessment documents are prefixed &quot;SA&quot; (e.g., SA100 - Individual tax return) and tax credits paperwork is prefixed &quot;TC&quot; (e.g., TC600 - Tax credits application).

==In the Republic of Ireland==
In the Republic of Ireland, P45 was also used as a reference to a form used by the Revenue Commissioners with the same function. The administrative procedures in this area were similar; however, the form itself was different in design from the UK version. The form was eliminated from 1 January 2019, having been replaced by a real-time reporting of tax details to Revenue.

==In popular culture==
On 27 June 2007, the day of his resignation as Prime Minister, Tony Blair jokingly remarked during his final Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions about receiving his P45:


On 4 October 2017, at the annual Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Prime Minister Theresa May was handed a P45 form by prankster Simon Brodkin as a stunt claiming to be from then-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Brodkin was arrested, but no charges were brought.

<doc id="803545" wikidata="Q7356683" url="?curid=803545" title="Roderick Sprague">
<text>Roderick Sprague III (February 18, 1933 – August 20, 2012) was an American anthropologist, ethnohistorian and historical archaeologist, and the emeritus Director of the Laboratory of Anthropology at the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he taught for thirty years. He had extensive experience in environmental impact research, trade beads, aboriginal burial customs, and the Columbia Basin area. 
Sprague was president of the Society of Bead Researchers from 2004 to 2007.

In addition to his work in the traditional anthropological fields, he also collaborated with Professor Grover Krantz in an attempt to apply scientific reasoning to the study of Sasquatch.

==Education==
Sprague received both his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in anthropology from Washington State University in Pullman, serving in the U.S. Army in between. He received his Ph.D. in 1967 from the University of Arizona in Tucson.

As a graduate student in 1964 at Washington State University, he was the field supervisor of a dig at the Palus burial site in Lyons Ferry, Washington when one of only a few known Jefferson Peace Medals was discovered.

Additionally, his dissertation, &quot;Aboriginal burial practices in the plateau region of North America&quot; (1967) is considered one of the best writings on the topic.

==Career==
Sprague&#x27;s career was varied and took him in different directions. He conducted excavations in the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and the Canadian Maritime on Prince Edward Island; and research in the American Southwest and Inner Mongolia. Much of his research was on burial practices and historical archaeology, with a special interest in glass and ceramic trade beads and buttons. He conducted burial research at the request of ten different American Indian tribal governments. Sprague was an early advocate of the importance of repatriation in archaeological and anthropological excavations, long before the enactment of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.

Sprague served many roles in the Society for Historical Archaeology: on the Board of Directors from 1970 to 1971, secretary-treasurer from 1971 to 1974, member of the Editorial Advisory Board since 1977, Book Review Editor from 1977 to 1997, Archivist from 1987 to 1998, as president in 1976 and 1990 and as Parliamentarian from 1984 to 2008.

He was a professor of anthropology at the University of Idaho in Moscow for thirty years, until his retirement in 1997.

Sprague, along with Dr. Deward E. Walker, founded the scholarly journal &quot;Northwest Anthropological Research Notes&quot; in 1966, called the &quot;Journal of Northwest Anthropology&quot; since 2001.

==Awards==
Sprague was the first member of The Society for Historical Archaeology to be awarded both the J. C. Harrington Medal in Historical Archaeology and the Carol Ruppe Distinguished Service Award.

==Personal life==
In retirement, Sprague lived in Moscow with his wife Linda, who also holds degrees in anthropology. He had four children.

<doc id="803554" wikidata="Q2666639" url="?curid=803554" title="Nathan Straus">
<text>Nathan Straus (January 31, 1848 – January 11, 1931) was an American businessman and philanthropist who co-owned two of New York City&#x27;s largest department stores, R. H. Macy &amp; Company and Abraham &amp; Straus. He was the namesake for the Israeli city Netanya.

==Biography==
Nathan Straus was born to a German Jewish family in Otterberg in the former Palatinate, then ruled by the Kingdom of Bavaria (now part of present-day Germany), the third child of Lazarus Straus (1809–1898) and his second wife, Sara (1823–1876). His siblings were Hermine Straus Kohns (1846–1922), Isidor Straus (1845–1912), and Oscar Solomon Straus (1850–1926). The family moved to the U.S. state of Georgia in 1854. After losing everything in the American Civil War the family moved to New York City, where his father formed L. Straus &amp; Sons, a crockery and glassware firm. The Straus family owned slaves and conducted business with other slave owners, taking several formerly enslaved people to the North with the family following the defeat of the Confederacy.

On April 28, 1875, Straus married Lina Gutherz (1854–1930), with whom he had six children: Jerome Nathan Straus (1876–1893); Sara Gutherz Straus (1877–1878); Sara &quot;Sissie&quot; Straus (1879–1950), married to Irving Lehman (1876–1945), Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals from 1940 until his death; Roland Straus (1881–1884); State Senator Nathan Straus Jr. (1889–1961); and Hugh Grant Straus (1890–1961).

==Macy&#x27;s and Abraham &amp; Straus==
Straus and his brothers sold crockery to R. H. Macy &amp; Company department store. The brothers became partners in Macy&#x27;s in 1888 and co-owners in 1896.

In 1893, he and Isidor bought Joseph Wechsler&#x27;s interest in the Abraham and Wechsler dry-goods store in Brooklyn, New York, which they renamed as Abraham &amp; Straus.

==Public service and philanthropy==
In the late 1880s, Straus began a period of philanthropy and public service in New York City. He served as Parks Commissioner from 1889 until 1893, president of the Board of Health and Commissioner of the Department of Health in 1898, and in 1894 he was selected by Tammany Hall to run for Mayor on the Democratic ticket, but withdrew from the race when his friends in society threatened to shun him if he did.

In 1892, he and his wife privately funded the Nathan Straus Pasteurized Milk Laboratory to provide pasteurized milk to children to combat infant mortality and tuberculosis. In his battles with the disease he opened the Tuberculosis Preventorium for Children at Lakewood Township, New Jersey (later it was moved to Farmingdale, New Jersey) in 1909. Their book, &quot;Disease in Milk: The Remedy Pasteurization: The Life Work of Nathan Straus&quot; records that unclean, unpasteurized milk fed to infants was the chief cause of tuberculosis, typhoid, scarlet fever, diphtheria and other diseases that were the main cause of a 25% infant mortality rate in the U.S. in 1890, 15% in 1903 (but 7% in New York in 1900, where pasteurized milk had already become the norm) (it is now below 1% in the U.S.). Straus is credited as the leading proponent of the pasteurization movement, which eliminated the hundreds of thousands of deaths per year then due to disease-bearing milk.

During the economic panic of 1893, Straus used his milk stations to sell coal at the very low price of 5 cents for 25 pounds to those who could pay. Those who could not received coal free. He also opened homeless shelters for 64,000 people, who could get a bed and breakfast for 5 cents, and he funded 50,000 meals for one cent each. He also gave away thousands of turkeys anonymously. At Abraham &amp; Straus he noticed that two of his employees were starving themselves to save their wages to feed their families, so he established what may have been the first subsidized company cafeteria.

In 1898, during the Spanish–American War, Straus donated an ice plant to Santiago, Cuba. He was appointed by President William Taft as the sole United States delegate to the International Congress for Protection of Infants, in Berlin 1911, also delegate to the Tuberculosis Congress, in Rome, Italy, 1912.

Straus retired in 1914 to devote his time to charity. During the winter of 1914–15, he served 1,135,731 penny meals for the unemployed from his milk depots in New York City. In 1916, as American entry into World War I loomed, he sold his yacht &quot;Sisilina&quot; to the Coast Guard, and used the proceeds to feed war orphans. Later he fed returning American servicemen at Battery Park.

Shortly after World War I, Straus traveled to Asheville, North Carolina, to lay a wreath at the Confederate Vance Monument as a &quot;debt of gratitude&quot; for Zebulon Baird Vance&#x27;s opposition to antisemitism. Straus paid for a &quot;suitable fence&quot; to be built around the monument.

Straus donated money to the New York Public Library, specifically targeting young people. The Young People&#x27;s Collection at the Donnell Library Center is named for him. He also helped the city&#x27;s poorer inhabitants by building a recreational pier, the first of many on the city&#x27;s waterfront.

===Visits to Palestine===
Upon touring the Mediterranean with Lina in 1904, the couple stopped over in Palestine, expecting it to be but one stop of many. He wrote, &quot;On reaching Jerusalem, we changed our plans. All that we saw in the Holy Land made such a deep impression on us that we gave up the idea of going to other places. Visiting the holy sights of which one hears and reads since childhood, watching the scenes in life as pictured in the Bible, was most soul-stirring. From that time on we felt a strange and intense desire to return to the land.&quot; Nathan and Lina became staunch Zionists. He built soup kitchens for the aged and the blind and the physically defective from 1912-1917. He supported workrooms so that unskilled laborers could find employment. He built health stations that ministered to the victims of malaria and trachoma. He believed strongly in palliative care. He provided $250,000 for the establishment of the Jerusalem Health Center and made possible the founding of a Pasteur Institute. He lent moral and material support to the farmers and colonists of Israel and labored in the interests of the Hebrew University.

Straus broke his leg on a 1912 visit to Palestine and was unable to join his brother, Isidor, on the RMS Titanic. Isidor died in the sinking.

The Israeli city of Netanya (Hebrew: &quot;Natan&quot;, for Nathan), founded in 1927, was named in his honor. The city&#x27;s founders had hoped that he would contribute towards the development of the city, but Straus didn&#x27;t have anything to give, having contributed his money elsewhere. Rehov Straus (Straus Street) in Jerusalem, which was Chancellor Avenue during the British Mandate, was also named for him.

Nathan Straus died on January 11, 1931, in Manhattan, New York City. Twenty years earlier, at a dinner in his honor, he had given what could have been his own eulogy.

I often think of the old saying, &quot;The world is my country, to do good is my religion. ... This has often been an inspiration to me. I might say, &quot;Humanity is my kin, to save babies is my religion.&quot; It is a religion I hope will have thousands of followers.

He is interred at Beth El Cemetery, also called New Union Field Cemetery, in Ridgewood, Queens.

<text>Helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) is a method for &quot;in vitro&quot; DNA amplification (like the polymerase chain reaction) that takes place at a constant temperature.

==Introduction==
The polymerase chain reaction is the most widely used method for &quot;in vitro&quot; DNA amplification for purposes of molecular biology and biomedical research. This process involves the separation of the double-stranded DNA in high heat into single strands (the denaturation step, typically achieved at 95–97 °C), annealing of the primers to the single stranded DNA (the annealing step) and copying the single strands to create new double-stranded DNA (the extension step that requires the DNA polymerase) requires the reaction to be done in a thermal cycler. These bench-top machines are large, expensive and costly to run and maintain, limiting the potential applications of DNA amplification in situations outside the laboratory (e.g., in the identification of potentially hazardous micro-organisms at the scene of investigation, or at the point of care of a patient). Although PCR is usually associated with thermal cycling, the original patent by Mullis et al. disclosed the use of a helicase as a means for denaturation of double stranded DNA thereby including isothermal nucleic acid amplification.
&quot;In vivo&quot;, DNA is replicated by DNA polymerases with various accessory proteins, including a DNA helicase that acts to separate the DNA by unwinding the DNA double helix. HDA was developed from this concept, using a helicase (an enzyme) to denature the DNA.

== Methodology ==

Strands of double-stranded DNA are first separated by a DNA helicase and coated by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteins. In the second step, two sequence-specific primers hybridise to each border of the DNA template. DNA polymerases are then used to extend the primers annealed to the templates to produce a double-stranded DNA and the two newly synthesized DNA products are then used as substrates by DNA helicases, entering the next round of the reaction. Thus, a simultaneous chain reaction develops, resulting in exponential amplification of the selected target sequence (see Vincent &quot;et al.&quot;., 2004 for a schematic diagram).

== Present progress and the advantages and disadvantages of HDA ==

Since the publication of its discovery, HDA technology has been used for a &quot;simple, easy to adapt nucleic acid test for the detection of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;&quot;. Other applications include the rapid detection of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus &quot; by the amplification and detection of a short DNA sequence specific to the bacterium. The advantages of HDA is that it provides a rapid method of nucleic acid amplification of a specific target at an isothermic temperature that does not require a thermal cycler. However, the optimisation of primers and sometimes buffers is required beforehand by the researcher. Normally primer and buffer optimisation is tested and achieved through PCR, raising the question of the need to spend extra on a separate system to do the actual amplification. Despite the selling point that HDA negates the use of a thermal cycler and therefore allows research to be conducted in the field, much of the work required to detect potentially hazardous microorganisms is carried out in a research/hospital lab setting regardless. At present, mass diagnoses from a great number of samples cannot yet be achieved by HDA, whereas PCR reactions carried out in thermal cycler that can hold multi-well sample plates allows for the amplification and detection of the intended DNA target from a maximum of 96 samples. The cost of purchasing reagents for HDA are also relatively expensive to that of PCR reagents, more so since it comes as a ready-made kit.

<text>, a transliteration of Greek , vocative case of (&quot;Kyrios&quot;), is a common name of an important prayer of Christian liturgy, also called the  ( ; ).

==In the Bible==
The prayer, , &quot;Lord, have mercy&quot; derives from a Biblical phrase. Greek , , is the Septuagint translation of the phrase often found in the Psalms (6:2, 9:13, 31:9, 86:3, and 123:3).

In the New Testament, the Greek phrase occurs three times in Matthew:
* Matthew 15:22: the Canaanite woman cries out to Jesus, &quot;Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David.&quot; ()
* Matthew 17:15: &quot;Lord, have mercy on my son&quot; ()
* Matthew 20:30: two unnamed blind men call out to Jesus, &quot;Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David.&quot; ()

In the Parable of the Publican and the Pharisee (Luke 18:9–14) the despised tax collector who cries out &quot;Lord have mercy on me, a sinner&quot; is contrasted with the smug Pharisee who believes he has no need for forgiveness.

Luke 17:13 has , , instead of , , (), being less suggestive of the used as euphemism for YHWH in the Septuagint.

There are other examples in the text of the gospels without the , e.g. Mark 10:46, where blind Bartimaeus cries out, &quot;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.&quot;

In the biblical text, the phrase is always personalized by an explicit object (such as &quot;on me&quot;, &quot;on us&quot;, &quot;on my son&quot;), while in the Eucharistic celebration it can be seen more as a general expression of confidence in God&#x27;s love.

== In Eastern Christianity ==

The phrase (), whether in Greek or in other languages, is one of the most oft-repeated phrases in Eastern Christianity, including the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian Nestorian, and Eastern Catholic Churches. The Greek phrase, &quot;&quot;, is for instance extensively used in the Coptic (Egyptian) Christian liturgy, which uses both the Coptic and the Greek languages.

The various litanies, frequent in Eastern Orthodox rites, generally have &quot;Lord, have mercy&quot; as their response, either singly or triply. Some petitions in these litanies will have twelve or even forty repetitions of the phrase as a response. 

The phrase is also the origin of the Jesus Prayer, beloved by Eastern Christians as a foundation of personal prayer, and is increasingly popular among some Western Christians.

The prayer is simultaneously a petition and a prayer of thanksgiving; an acknowledgement of what God has done, what God is doing, and what God will continue to do. It is refined in the Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican (), where the Publican prays &quot;God, have mercy on me, a sinner&quot;, thus showing more clearly its connection with the Jesus Prayer.

== In Western Christianity ==
In Rome, the liturgy was first celebrated in Greek. Josef Jungmann suggests the &quot; in the Roman Mass is best seen as a vestige of a litany at the beginning of the Mass, like that of some Eastern churches, retained after Latin became normative.

As early as the sixth century, Pope Gregory the Great noted that there were differences in the way in which eastern and western churches sang &#x27;. In the eastern churches all sing it at the same time, whereas in the western church the clergy sing it and the people respond. Also, the western church sang &#x27; as many times as &quot;&quot;. In the Roman Rite liturgy, this variant, , is a transliteration of Greek .

&#x27; may also be used as a response of the people to intentions mentioned in the Prayer of the Faithful. Since 1549, Anglicans have normally sung or said the &#x27; in English. In the 1552 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the &#x27; was inserted into a recitation of the Ten Commandments. Modern revisions of the Prayer Book have restored the option of using the &#x27; without the Commandments. Other denominations, such as Lutheranism, also use &quot; in their liturgies.

=== &quot; as section of the Mass ordinary ===

In the Tridentine Mass form of the Roman Rite, &#x27; is sung or said three times, followed by a threefold &#x27; and by another threefold &quot;. Collectively, the nine invocations are said to unite the petitions of the faithful to those of the nine choirs of angels in heaven.

==== Musical settings ====

The is the first sung prayer of the Mass ordinary and is usually part of any musical setting of the Mass, one exception being the early English school, whose liturgy featured a troped that was therefore proper to the day. &quot; movements sometimes have a ternary (ABA) musical structure that reflects the symmetrical structure of the text. Polyphonic settings can be found in five (or four) movements, calling for alternatim performance, i. e. alternating with Gregorian chant or with organ versets. Musical settings exist in a variety of styles.

===Use in litanies===
The &quot;&quot; serves as the beginning of litanies in the Roman Rite.

== Modern Catholic thought ==
The terms &quot;aggiornamento&quot; (bringing up to date) and &quot;ressourcement&quot; (light of the Gospel) figure significantly into the documents of Vatican II: “The Church carries the responsibility of scrutinizing the signs of the times and interpreting them in the light of the Gospel” (&quot;Gaudium et spes&quot;, 4). Louis Bouyer, a theologian at Vatican II, claimed that there was a distortion of the Eucharistic spirit of the Mass over the centuries, so that &quot;one could find merely traces of the original sense of the Eucharist as a thanksgiving for the wonders God has wrought.” The &quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot; (&quot;GIRM&quot;) notes that at the Council of Trent &quot;manuscripts in the Vatican ... by no means made it possible to inquire into &#x27;ancient and approved authors&#x27; farther back than the liturgical commentaries of the Middle Ages ... [But] traditions dating back to the first centuries, before the formation of the rites of East and West, are better known today because of the discovery of so many liturgical documents&quot; (7f.). 

Consonant with these modern studies, theologians have suggested that there be a continuity in praise of God between the opening song and the praise of the &quot;Gloria&quot;. This is explained by Mark R. Francis of Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, speaking of the :
Its emphasis is not on us (our sinfulness) but on God’s mercy and salvific action in Jesus Christ. It could just as accurately be translated &quot;O Lord, you are merciful!&quot; Note that the sample tropes all mention what Christ has done for us, not how we have sinned. For example, “you were sent to heal the contrite,” “you have shown us the way to the Father,” or “you come in word and sacrament to strengthen us in holiness,” leading to further acclamation of God’s praises in the Gloria.

In this same line, Hans Urs von Balthasar calls for a renewal of the focus at the Eucharist:
We must make every effort to arouse the sense of community within the liturgy, to restore liturgy to the ecclesial plane, where individuals can take their proper place in it…. Liturgical piety involves a total turning from concern with one’s inner state to the attitude and feeling of the Church. It means enlarging the scope of prayer, so often narrow and selfish, to embrace the concerns of the whole Church and, indeed – as in the Our Father – of God.”

In the &quot;New Dictionary of Sacramental Worship,&quot; the need to establish communion is reinforced as it quotes the GIRM to the effect that the purpose of the introductory rites is “to ensure that the faithful who come together as one &quot;establish communion&quot; and dispose themselves to listen properly to God&#x27;s word and to celebrate the Eucharist worthily” (&quot;GIRM&quot;, 46, emphasis added).

<text>SimPark is a 1996 video game by Maxis. The object of the game is to cultivate and manage a successful park. Similar to &quot;SimTown&quot;, it is targeted more towards children than the average player. &quot;SimPark&quot; attempts to show the importance of ecological balance. It could well be considered a &#x27;lite&#x27; version of &quot;&quot;.

==Overview==
&quot;SimPark&quot; was a simple game designed for a younger audience. It is not possible to lose the game by getting fired or running out of money.

== Gameplay ==

Players have to quickly learn how doing (or not doing) various things will affect how their park grows. For instance, if certain flower types are not planted, the park will not attract bees. If the bees are not flying around the park, then pollination will not occur, which is an important aspect of keeping the park growing. On top of properly managing the plant and animal population, players are also required to identify the park&#x27;s plants and animals.

Players often receive in-game email, such as their boss telling them to make the park more diverse, or their virtual mother telling about life back at home (e.g.: &quot;I baked you a cake...&quot; etc.) Occasionally, the Boss&#x27;s pet frog Rizzo will make an appearance on the screen to give the player advice, or nag about the way they are handling things.

The park can experience disasters, including:
* Garbage Dump: The Garbage Dump is just a big pile of rubbish. As soon as it is made, rats start to emerge from it and inhabit your park. The only ways to get rid of the garbage dump are to put water on it or to place many garbage-eating animals, such as rats and black bears, around the garbage dump.
* Fire
* Kudzu: Kudzu plants begin to overgrown the park.
* Alien invasion: The Alien Invasion consists of flat, pink-and-blue creatures that litter the park grounds and sometimes float on the water. If the map is clicked to get a zoomed-out map view, the pattern the Aliens form may be in the shape of letters. One example of this is a message which reads: &quot;Surrender, Dorothy&quot;. This is a parody of the movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The only way to get rid of aliens, aside from using cheat codes, is to bulldoze them with the &quot;Bulldozer&quot; tool.

The option of using a microphone feature allows you to click on park-goers and listen to what they have to say. Some of the more memorable quotes include, &quot;My socks don&#x27;t match,&quot; &quot;I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth this morning,&quot; &quot;Eddie! Oh Eddie! Where are you?&quot; and &quot;My favourite book is &quot;Wind in the Willows.&quot;&quot;

It takes about four minutes of real time for a year of time to elapse in the game. The game shows the seasons with the changing color of the leaves.

<doc id="803571" wikidata="Q7069480" url="?curid=803571" title="Number 10 Policy Unit">
<text>The Number 10 Policy Unit is a body of policymakers based in 10 Downing Street, providing policy advice directly to the British Prime Minister. Originally set up to support Harold Wilson in 1974, it has gone through a series of guises to suit the needs of successive prime ministers, staffed variously by political advisers, civil servants and more recently a combination of both.

The current Director of the Number 10 Policy Unit is Stuart Ingham.

==Since 2010==

The Coalition Government of May 2010 quickly disbanded two major parts of central infrastructure built by Tony Blair, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Delivery Unit (PMDU) and Prime Minister&#x27;s Strategy Unit (PMSU), as part of the Prime Minister&#x27;s agenda to reduce the number of special advisers and end the micromanagement of Whitehall.In their place, a strengthened Policy and Implementation Unit was launched in early 2011 by the Cabinet Secretary, staffed wholly by civil servants and reporting jointly to the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister under joint heads Paul Kirby (Policy) and Kris Murrin (Implementation).

Members of the Policy Unit in 2010 were Gavin Lockhart-Mirams (Home Affairs), Sean Worth (Health and Adult Social Care), Chris Brown (Education), Richard Freer (Defence), Tim Luke (Business and Enterprise), Michael Lynas (Big Society) and Ben Moxham (Energy and Environment). The Unit was supported by the Research and Analytics Unit.

==Since 2019==

Munira Mirza was appointed director of the Policy Unit when Boris Johnson became prime minister. She had previously been Deputy Mayor of London with responsibility for Education and Culture under Johnson during his time as Mayor of London. Mirza resigned on 4 February 2022 after Johnson failed to apologise for making misleading remarks that implied that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile while the latter was Director of Public Prosecutions.

Andrew Griffith MP was appointed to replace Mirza as the director of the Policy Unit until 8 July 2022. As a sitting MP, he was also appointed as Parliamentary Secretary (Minister for Policy and Head of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Policy Unit). The role was left vacant from 8 July 2022, as Johnson announced his resignation as party leader, with a view to remaining as a caretaker prime minister until his successor had been chosen. 

The vacant post was filled by Jamie Hope on 6 September 2022 as part of the short-lived Truss ministry.

When Rishi Sunak became prime minister in October 2022, Eleanor Shawcross, the daughter of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, William Shawcross and grand-daughter of the barrister Hartley Shawcross, became director of the Policy Unit. She had previously donated £20,000 to his leadership campaign, having advised him while he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Shawcross had previously spent 6 years as deputy chief of staff to George Osborne during his time as Chancellor, and chief of staff at the Department for Work and Pensions where she was later made a non-executive director.

<text>William Francis Quinn (July 13, 1919 – August 28, 2006) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 12th and last governor of the Territory of Hawaii from 1957 to 1959 and the first governor of the State of Hawaii from 1959 to 1962. Originally appointed to the office by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Quinn was the last executive appointed by an American president, after American rule of the Hawaiian Islands began after the overthrow of the monarchy in 1893. He was also the last Republican to serve as governor until Linda Lingle in 2002. Quinn appeared as a guest on the television program &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;. He was the recipient of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, a papal knighthood conferred by Pope John Paul II. He was the state&#x27;s first Republican governor.

== Early years ==
Quinn was born in Rochester, New York on July 13, 1919. His family moved to St. Louis, Missouri during his youth, where he attended prep school at St. Louis University High School and college at Saint Louis University, graduating in 1940. Quinn entered Harvard Law School, but only finished after his stint in the military. He graduated cum laude in 1947. He served in Hawaii in naval intelligence during World War II. Upon his discharge from service, he settled permanently in Honolulu, Hawai&#x27;i.

== Law and political career ==
In 1949, in a deal involving homestead development of the area of Waimea in Hawaii County, as a lawyer with Parker Ranch attorney Garner Anthony, Quinn brokered a deal with the Territorial Land Office and Hawaiian Homes Commission to allow the ranch a more lengthy period of time in which to evacuate the property.

Quinn involved himself in territorial politics and ran for the Hawaii Territorial Senate in 1956.

Quinn worked closely with Congressional Delegate John A. Burns on the Hawaii Statehood Commission. President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Quinn Governor of the Territory of Hawaii in 1957. In 1959, he defeated Burns to win the new state&#x27;s first gubernatorial election. In 1961, Quinn was grand marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California. During the 1962 gubernatorial election, Quinn faced Burns in a rematch; he also faced a strong primary challenge from Lieutenant Governor James Kealoha, and Burns ultimately won the election.

In 1976, Quinn ran for the United States Senate, an election he lost to Spark Matsunaga.

== Later years and personal life ==
On July 11, 1942, Quinn married Nancy Ellen Witbeck; the couple had seven children. They were members of the Portlock Road Association.

He was president of Dole Pineapple Company from 1965 to 1972, and chairman of the board of both the Honolulu Symphony and the East-West Center.

Quinn lectured, occasionally traveled on the public speaking circuit serving as a Republican elder statesman, and spent time with his family in Hawai&#x27;i. A devout Catholic, he was the recipient of a papal knighthood in the Order of the Holy Sepulchre.

He was a dedicated actor and singer in the Honolulu Light Opera. His most notable role was in the 1940s production of &quot;Brigadoon&quot;.

In March 2006, Quinn was injured in a fall and never fully recovered. He died on August 28, 2006, and is buried at National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.

<text>Henry Rootes Jackson (June 24, 1820 – May 23, 1898) was a major general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He owned 11 slaves in 1860.

==Biography==
Jackson was born in Athens, Georgia. He graduated with honors from Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones, in 1839. Before the war, he served as a lawyer, then as colonel of the 1st Georgia volunteers in the Mexican–American War, state judge, as United States Chargé d&#x27;affaires to the Austrian Empire from 1853 to 1854, and as Minister Resident to the Austrian Empire from 1854 to 1858. Jackson was also a poet (his book &quot;Tallulah and Other Poems&quot; appeared in 1850) and a frequent public speaker. For instance, he delivered an oration on &quot;Courage&quot; to the University of Georgia literary societies in 1848 and a dedication address for the Laurel Grove Cemetery in Savannah in 1852. Jackson was a prominent lawyer and prosecutor in Savannah. In 1859, he unsuccessfully prosecuted the owners and crew of the slave ship, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, the second-to-last ship known to have brought people from Africa into the United States for sale as slaves.

Enlisting in the Confederate army in 1861, he served as a judge in Confederate courts. Promoted in June to brigadier general, he later led troops during the Western Virginia campaign, seeing action at the Battle of Cheat Mountain. In December, he was promoted to major general of state militia for Georgia. Returning to Confederate service in September 1863, he led a brigade during the later part of the Atlanta Campaign. He commanded a brigade in William B. Bate&#x27;s division in John Bell Hood&#x27;s Franklin-Nashville Campaign. Jackson was captured at the Battle of Nashville and was paroled from Fort Warren, Massachusetts, on July 8, 1865.

After the war, he resumed his law practice and political career, being named as minister to Mexico from 1885 to 1886. He also was a railroad executive, banker, and president of the Georgia Historical Society (1875 – 1898). Jackson died in Savannah, Georgia, and was buried in Bonaventure Cemetery, owned by City of Savannah, located in Thunderbolt, Ga.

<text>Francesco Bianchini (13 December 16622 March 1729) was an Italian philosopher and scientist. He worked for the curia of three popes, including being &quot;camiere d&#x27;honore&quot; of Clement XI, and secretary of the commission for the reform of the calendar, working on the method to calculate the astronomically correct date for Easter in a given year.

==Life and work==
Bianchini was born of a noble family at Verona, the son of Giuseppe Bianchini and his wife, Cornelia Vailetti. Educated by Jesuits in Bologna, and by the Paduan astronomer, Geminiano Montanari, Bianchini spent most of his university years in Padua studying comets while enrolled in Theology. This early training in astronomy established Bianchini&#x27;s commitment to the experimental and physical sciences. In 1684 he went to Rome, and became librarian to Cardinal Ottoboni, who, as Pope Alexander VIII (1689), raised him to the offices of papal chamberlain and canon of Santa Maria Maggiore. Clement XI sent him on a mission to Paris in 1712, and employed him to form a museum of Christian antiquities. A paper by him on Giovanni Domenico Cassini&#x27;s new method of parallaxes was inserted in the &quot;Acta Eruditorum&quot; of Leipzig in 1685.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in January 1713 after being proposed by Sir Isaac Newton. On 9 January 1706, Bianchini was elected member of the French Academy of Sciences of Paris.

His deduction of a rotational period of Venus was based on the observation of its surface using a 2.6&quot; (66mm) 100-foot focal length aerial telescope. Today, we know that this is impossible, because of the thick cloud cover on this planet. He also worked on the parallax of Venus, and he measured the precession of the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis.

As part of his efforts to improve the accuracy of the calendar, Bianchini was commissioned by Clement XI to construct an important meridian line in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri (the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels and the Martyrs) in Rome, a device for calculating the position of the sun and stars.

According to a Catholic News Service online news story by Carol Glatz from 5 August 2011, Pope Benedict XVI noted this when he explained the importance of astronomyespecially when clocks were primitive and prone to error – in the determination of certain liturgical celebration days and the times for certain daily prayers, such as the Angelus.

His point of view on the Copernican system is not evident, but it was noted that the picture of the planetary system in his book about Venus has an empty centre.

42775 Bianchini, an asteroid, Craters on Mars and the Bianchini crater on the Moon are named in his honour.

He also worked as a topographer and archaeologist of ancient Rome, and as a collector. In 1726, a structure (the columbarium of Livia) consisting of three sepulchral chambers of some of the servants and freedmen of Augustus and his wife Livia were discovered near the Via Appia, and excavated. Bianchini explored these rooms and published a description. In 1727, he fell through the ceiling of a vault while exploring the ruins of the palace of the Caesars on the Palatine Hill (Palace of Domitian), and was severely injured.

He died in Rome on 2 March 1729, and was buried in Santa Maria Maggiore. A monument was raised to his memory in Verona Cathedral.

==Books==
He published many books, including:
* &quot;Storia universale, provata co&#x27; monumenti, e figurata co&#x27; simboli degli antichi&quot; (Rome, 1697 and 1747)
* &quot;De Calendario et Cyclo Caesaris&quot; (1703)

* &quot;Camera Ed Inscrizioni Sepulcrali De&#x27; Liberti, Servi, ed Ufficiali della Casa di Augusto Scoperte nella Via Appia, ed illustrate Con le Annotazioni&quot; (Rome, 1727)
* &quot;Hesperi et Phosphori nova phaenomena sive observationes circa planetam Veneris&quot; (Rome, 1728), in which he asserted Venus to rotate in 24 days and 8 hours.
* &quot;Astronomicae et Geographicae Observationes Selectae&quot; (1737) (posthumously)
* &quot;Del Palazzo de Cesari Opera Postuma&quot; (Verona, 1738) (posthumously)

<doc id="803576" wikidata="Q1188762" url="?curid=803576" title="Tröllaskagi">
<text>Tröllaskagi () is a peninsula in northern Iceland on the Greenland Sea, between the fjords of Eyjafjörður and Skagafjörður. The peninsula is mountainous, with several peaks reaching over 1,000 meters above sea level, the tallest being Kerling (1,538 m). It is the part of Iceland with the highest elevation outside the central highlands.

The peninsula is cut by several deep valleys that were carved by glaciers during the glacial periods of the last Ice age and later by the rivers that now flow down those valleys. A few permanent glacial ice caps still exist in central Tröllaskagi, but they are all rather small.

Human settlement is only extant in the relatively flat lowlands along the coast and in the valleys, but these lowlands are densely populated by Icelandic standards with important agricultural regions and a few towns and villages that mostly base their livelihood on fisheries. Those settlements are (clockwise around the peninsula beginning in Skagafjörður): Hofsós, Hólar, Siglufjörður, Ólafsfjörður, Dalvík, Árskógssandur , Hauganes, Hjalteyri, Hrafnagil and the largest being Akureyri.

== Öxnadalsheiði ==
The Ring Road runs through Tröllaskagi between Skagafjörður and Eyjafjörður through a mountain pass called &quot;Öxnadalsheiði&quot; where the road reaches a maximum elevation of 540 meters above sea level which can sometimes pose a problem during wintertime. Several different tunneling projects have been suggested as a way to bypass Öxnadalsheiði.</text><links>

<text>Network Service Provider (NSP) is one of the roles defined in the National Information Infrastructure (NII) plan, which governed the transition of the Internet from US federal control to private-sector governance, with an accompanying shift from the 1968-1992 single-payer economy to a competitive market economy. The plan envisioned Network Service Providers as a wholesale layer, moving Internet bandwidth produced at Network Access Points (subsequently called &quot;Internet exchange points&quot;) to Internet Service Providers, who would in turn sell it to end-user enterprises, or on to Internet Access Providers (IAPs) who would sell it to individual end-users in their homes. In fact, the original Network Service Providers quickly vertically integrated with Internet Service Providers and Internet Access Providers, through the mid-1990s, creating conglomerates and reducing competition.

Now, the term may refer to telecommunications companies, data carriers, wireless communications providers, Internet service providers, and cable television operators offering Internet access.

<doc id="803584" wikidata="Q2142212" url="?curid=803584" title="SimCopter">
<text>SimCopter is a 1996 flight simulator video game developed by Maxis. It puts the player into a 3D city. Like &quot;Streets of SimCity&quot;, &quot;SimCopter&quot; lets the player import &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; maps into the game. It is also the first game to use the Sim language Simlish.

==Gameplay==
&quot;SimCopter&quot; puts the player in the role of a helicopter pilot. There are two modes of play: user mode and career mode. The user mode (free mode) lets the player fly around cities that they have created (which can be imported from &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;) or any of the 30 cities supplied with the game. However, user cities sometimes need to be designed with &quot;SimCopter&quot; in mind; most of the time, the player must increase the number of police stations, fire stations, and hospitals to allow for speedier dispatches.
The career mode puts the player in the shoes of a pilot doing various jobs around a city.

While all other criminals roam the streets by foot, burglars drive through the city at high speed and are difficult to catch. All types of criminals can be arrested by picking up a police officer from the roof of a police station, and then dropping them near the criminal. Police cars can also be dispatched to aid in the arrest of a criminal. Criminals on foot can also be stopped by landing on top of them with the helicopter, which kills them, but also risks damage to the helicopter. Dropped police officers will call out whether or not they see the suspect; the officers need to be guided by the helicopter&#x27;s spotlight. If a police officer does not find a suspect, it will return to the helicopter. As soon as a police officer sees a suspect, they will remain in pursuit until the suspect is arrested. Criminals can be slowed down by either using the spotlight or calling out the &quot;Stop Criminal&quot; message through the megaphone. Eight jobs are available, namely traffic jams, fires, rescues (which may occur during fire missions), catching criminals, riot control, MEDEVAC, transporting Sims, and speeding cars. Speeders can only be found by looking for a car that is belching exhaust behind it and squeals its tires when making turns. Once a speeder is pulled over, the helicopter must stay with it until a police car arrives to cite them for their reckless driving, or the speeder will take off again. Once the speeder is cited, another car will be selected to become the next speeder.

===Money and points===
Money and points can be earned by completing missions. Money and points can also be lost if the player runs out of time or does not complete a mission. Missions will take points from the player after a set amount of time from the start of the mission while it remains uncompleted. Some missions will eventually be canceled, resulting in a point loss or a forfeited reward after completion. MEDEVAC or firefighting missions will result in large penalties if the victim dies or if the area gets destroyed by the fire. When the player has accumulated enough points, the game lets them move on to the next city. The player then has a choice of going into a new city of the same difficulty or advancing to the next level. There are twelve levels of difficulty, with new types of jobs being introduced and previous types of jobs increasing in difficulty. Jobs will be randomly spawned around the city, but the player&#x27;s actions can also create jobs.

===Helicopters and upgrades===
The player starts with a small, weak helicopter that comes with just a megaphone and a bambi bucket; it can only hold two passengers. As the player accumulates money in the game, they can purchase better helicopters and newer equipment. Some jobs require certain equipment in order to complete them, and better helicopters offer greater speed, smoother handling, and greater passenger capacity. Helicopters have a limited fuel capacity and must return to the hangar about once every half hour to refuel, which costs money. If the helicopter runs out of fuel in mid-air, the player can either attempt to keep the rotors spinning and land it, or just let it fall to the ground and suffer heavy damage. If the helicopter remains intact after falling to the ground, it can be refueled at a highly inflated price.

Crashing the helicopter into a building or slamming it into the ground will not destroy it instantly, but will damage it. The more damage there is to the helicopter, the harder it is to control. Money can be spent to repair a helicopter. If the helicopter is destroyed, it is lost forever along with all of the equipment on board. When a helicopter is destroyed, it may set fire to a nearby building or terrain. If the player does not have enough money to buy a new helicopter, the player is grounded, making it impossible to continue on.

The helicopters in &quot;SimCopter&quot; are:
*Schweizer 300
*Bell 206 JetRanger
*McDonnell Douglas MD 500
*McDonnell Douglas MD 520 NOTAR
*Bell 212
*Augusta A109
*Dauphin 2
*McDonnell Douglas Explorer
*Boeing AH-64 Apache

===UFOs===
Maps that have an Apache in them will also occasionally have a UFO that flies around. They abduct Sims with a mysterious force (Sims will &quot;dance&quot; while they ascend), and also randomly shoot vertical beams that start fires if they hit trees or buildings. If the beam hits the player, the screen fades to white and the copter is instantly destroyed. If the UFO falls into the water, the player can rescue a surviving abductee for more points. If the UFO is shot down, the player receives 1,000 points.

==Easter egg==
The game gained controversy when it was discovered that the designer Jacques Servin inserted an Easter egg that generated shirtless men in Speedo trunks who hugged and kissed each other and appear in great numbers on certain dates, such as Friday the 13th. The egg was caught shortly after release and removed from future copies of the game. He cited his actions as a response to the intolerable working conditions he allegedly suffered at Maxis, particularly working 60-hour weeks and being denied time off. He also reported that he added the &quot;studs&quot;, as he called them, after a heterosexual programmer programmed &quot;bimbo&quot; female characters into the game, and that he wanted to highlight the &quot;implicit heterosexuality&quot; of many games. Although he had initially planned for the characters to appear only occasionally, the random number generator he had created malfunctioned, leading them to appear frequently. Servin was fired as a result, with Maxis reporting that his dismissal was due only to his addition of unauthorized content. This caused a member of AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), a gay AIDS organization, to call for a boycott of all of Maxis&#x27; products, a measure which Servin rejected. Some months later, a group named RTMark announced its existence and claimed responsibility for the Easter egg being inserted into the game, along with 16 other acts of &quot;creative subversion.&quot; Servin stated that he had received a money order of $5,000 from RTMark for the prank. It was revealed later on that Servin was a cofounder of RTMark.

== Nintendo 64 version ==

A Nintendo 64 version was announced by Maxis on May 22, 1997, a few weeks before E3 1997, where a playable prototype was presented. On October 9, 1997, Maxis announced that the game would instead be ported to 64DD peripheral, with an explicit intention of being a North American launch game for the platform, and with Electronic Arts being announced as its publisher; however, years later in an interview for the Video Game History Foundation, Akifumi “Aki” Kodama (president of Maxis K.K., developer of the conversion) and Jeffrey J. Feil (associated producer in &quot;SimCopter 64&quot; for Electronic Arts, owners of Maxis) said they never saw a 64DD build, with the former also saying that interaction with other games was never implemented at any point. When asked about the 64DD in an issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; from January 1998, Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned that the game would have an integration with &quot;Mario Artist&quot; and &quot;SimCity 64&quot;, in earlier interviews he also mentioned integration with &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;. The game was unofficially canceled on March 9, 1999 following the repeated delays of the peripheral.

There are at least two surviving prototypes of the port, one being the E3 1997 build, dated June 16, 1997; which was released by the Video Game History Foundation on November 14, 2022. The other prototype is dated December 26, 1997, and as of 2024 hasn&#x27;t been publicly released.

<text>Wharram Percy is a deserted medieval village and former civil parish near Wharram-le-Street, now in the parish of Wharram, on the western edge of the chalk Wolds of North Yorkshire, England. It is about south of Wharram-le-Street and is signposted from the Beverley to Malton road (B1248). Wharram Percy was part of the East Riding of Yorkshire until the 1974 boundary changes. In 1931 the parish had a population of 40.

The earthworks of the village have been known for many years, and outlines of house platforms were drawn onto the first Ordnance Survey six-inch maps of Yorkshire published in 1854. The site was researched each summer by combined teams of archaeologists, historians and even botanists, from about 1950 to 1990 after it was singled out for study in 1948 by Professor Maurice Beresford of the University of Leeds.

The site is now in the care of Historic England (formerly English Heritage).

==History==
Although the site seems to have been settled since prehistory, the village appears to have been most active from the 10th to the 12th centuries. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 records it as &#x27;Warran&#x27; or &#x27;Warron&#x27;. The suffix &#x27;Percy&#x27; stems from the prominent, aristocratic family that owned the area during the Middle Ages.

The Black Death of 1348–49 does not seem to have played a significant part in the desertion of Wharram Percy, although the large fall in population in the country as a whole at that time must have encouraged relocation to larger settlements.

In 1402 or 1403, the Percy family exchanged their holdings in the area with the Hylton family. Following changes in prices and wages during the 15th century, pastoral farming (particularly sheep) was more profitable for landowners than cereal farming. Over the century following, the Hylton family devoted more and more land to sheep, as their employment of agricultural labour decreased. During the early 16th century, the last residents of Wharram Percy were evicted and their homes were demolished to make room for more sheep pasture. On 1 April 1935 the parish was abolished and merged with Raisthorpe and Burdale and Wharram le Street to form Wharram.

==Present site==
The site is now in the care of Historic England. Although only the ruined church is easily visible above ground, much more of the village layout can be seen in the surrounding fields.

The site has been subject to archaeological investigations since the 1950s. In 2002 English Heritage (now called Historic England) undertook an archaeological investigation and analytical field survey of Wharram Percy. A 2004 study of a sizeable collection of human skeletal remains, excavated from the churchyard of the deserted village, reveals details of disease, diet and death in the rural medieval community. This used the latest scientific techniques to make observations about childhood growth, duration of breastfeeding, and osteoporosis and tuberculosis.

The Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail passes through the site, and the Centenary Way long-distance footpath passes to the east of the village.

==St Martin&#x27;s Church==
St Martin&#x27;s Church has evolved, through six phases, between the early 12th and early 17th centuries. The tower collapsed in 1959 and thereafter the interior was excavated, revealing a smaller, mid-11th-century stone church and an earlier, mid- to late 10th-century, timber building.

<text>Gender asymmetry is an aspect of the constructed international auxiliary language Esperanto which has been challenged by numerous proposals seeking to regularize both grammatical and lexical gender.

In the text below, when a proposed word or usage is not grammatically correct according to the standard rules of Esperanto grammar, it will be marked with an asterisk (*).

== Gender in Esperanto ==

Esperanto does not have grammatical gender other than in the two personal pronouns &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; and their derivatives. Nevertheless, gender is sometimes an issue. In practical usage words formed with the suffix - &quot;person&quot; are ambiguous, sometimes used with a masculine meaning in the singular, but generally neutral in the plural. However, concepts of gender have changed over time, and many words that were once considered masculine are now neutral, especially words related to professions and animals. In older texts it is only context that disambiguates. For example, in the saying &quot;to a happy man, even a gives eggs&quot; (Zamenhof), the word means &quot;cockerel/rooster&quot;, not &quot;chicken&quot;. However, this can be confusing to those who are not familiar with that saying, as the word has become more neutral over time.

In modern usage, most noun roots are lexically neutral, a couple of dozen are lexically masculine, and a smaller number lexically feminine. Most masculine roots may be made feminine through the addition of the suffix - and made to describe a group of both males and females with the addition of -. For example, means &quot;father&quot;, &quot;mother&quot;, and &quot;parents&quot;, but cannot be used traditionally in the singular for &quot;parent&quot;. For these gendered words there is no easy way to make the singular neutral equivalent. Often there is a separate root that acts like this, for example &quot;boy&quot; → &quot;child&quot;; &quot;son&quot; → &quot;offspring&quot;, etc. Some neutral counterparts can be made with word-building. The approximate meaning of &quot;parent&quot; can be achieved with &quot;&quot; or &quot;one of the parents&quot;. However, it is more common to simply say &quot;one of the parents&quot; or &quot;father or mother&quot;.

The most common roots that are masculine unless specifically marked as feminine are:
*Kin terms: &quot;grandfather&quot;, &quot;husband&quot;, &quot;fiancé&quot;, &quot;son&quot;, &quot;brother&quot;, &quot;grandson&quot;, &quot;nephew&quot;, &quot;uncle&quot;, &quot;father&quot;, &quot;widower&quot;, &quot;(male) cousin&quot;
*Words for boys and men: &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;man&quot;
*Titles: &quot;bachelor&quot; (a backformation from , derived from German ), &quot;count&quot;, &quot;prince&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, &quot;mister, sir&quot;

Gender-neutral roots such as &quot;lion&quot; and &quot;waiter&quot; may be made feminine with a grammatical suffix ( &quot;lioness&quot;, &quot;waitress&quot;), but there is no comparable way to derive the masculine; there was not even originally a word for &quot;male&quot;. Words without a feminine suffix may take a masculine reading, especially in the case of people and domestic animals; , for example, means &quot;chicken&quot;, but is read as masculine in &quot;rooster and hen&quot;. Zamenhof used the nominal root &quot;man, human male&quot; to make words for animals masculine. Originally this took the form of a suffix -, but in response to criticisms that the resulting words such as &quot;bull&quot; were ambiguous with mythological man–animal hybrids such as minotaurs (also ), Zamenhof switched to using as a prefix in his translation of &quot;Genesis&quot; finished in 1915. This usage has spread, and - is now widely used as a prefix in the case of animals ( &quot;male-lion&quot;, &quot;male-human&quot;), but as a separate adjective for professions ( &quot;male waiter&quot;), with - now considered archaic, though neither of these conventions is as common as feminine -. Moreover, the prefix - is idiomatic, as (man-bovine) could still mean either &quot;bull&quot; or &quot;minotaur/cherub&quot;; it is only by convention that it is generally understood to mean &quot;bull&quot;, and writers have coined words such as &quot;bull&quot; to bypass the issue.

== Common elements to regularizing Esperanto gender ==
Critics such as Dale Spender and Veronica Zundel feel that deriving feminine from masculine words causes women to be either &quot;linguistically excluded… or else named negatively&quot;, while others are bothered by the lack of symmetry. Such sentiments have sparked numerous attempts at reform, none of which have been accepted by the Akademio de Esperanto.

Reforms tend to address a few key areas:
*A masculine suffix, parallel to the feminine -
*An affix
*An epicene pronoun (like s/he or singular &quot;they&quot; in English)

Three specific proposals surface repeatedly, as they derive from the existing resources of the language. These are the masculine suffix *-, workarounds and expanded uses of the epicene prefix -, and the epicene pronoun .

=== Masculine suffixes ===
The most popular proposal for a masculine grammatical suffix is *-.

While preparing his Reformed Esperanto of 1894, Zamenhof considered *- as a masculine grammatical suffix.
He considered a male suffix logical but a complication for learners as it was against national customs. 
Other proposals have been suggested. was created through ablaut of -. (It is, in fact, the only such possibility, as -, -, and - already exist.) Similarly, *- was created through ablaut of - &quot;person&quot;. *- was created by analogy with the pet-name suffix -, the only masculine suffix in the language, so that pet names and the gender suffixes would be symmetrical:

An element common to all such proposals is that the gender-changing nouns are to be reanalyzed as gender neutral when they occur without a gender suffix, as the names of professions and nationalities came to be treated in the mid twentieth century, such as &quot;policeman&quot; → &quot;police officer&quot; and &quot;Englishman&quot; → &quot;English person&quot;. This doesn&#x27;t affect all words: Nouns that never changed gender to begin with, such as &quot;bull&quot;, do not take gender suffixes in these reforms either. The resulting paradigms are as follows:

The most common objection to the proposal is the very analysis of words such as &quot;patro&quot; as gender neutral. The reason behind the objection is that the specifically masculine words are defined as such in the Fundamento, and it is felt that reanalyzing them as gender neutral violates the Fundamento. One proposed solution to this problem is to introduce new root words for the gender neutral concepts: parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, etc. As an example, the currently neologistic root word (parent) can accept both to denote &quot;father&quot; and to denote &quot;mother&quot;.

Though none of these are widespread, has appeared in books published by Jorge Camacho and Luiz Portella.

Proponents of one proposal often claim that a competing proposal is confusing because it resembles an existing suffix, for example that &quot;father&quot; resembles pejorative &quot;a bad father&quot;, or that &quot;father&quot; resembles &quot;mother&quot;, but there does not seem to be a problem in actual use: With the word stress on the suffix vowel, and are as distinct as many other pairs of Esperanto suffixes, such as . One specific objection to the proposal is that &quot;grandson&quot; is homophonous with , being Esperanto slang for &quot;pussy&quot;; on the other hand, would mean not just &quot;a male&quot; but also &quot;the UN&quot;.

=== Epicene prefixes ===
Various epicene affixes have also been proposed. They may be proposed &quot;instead of&quot; a masculine suffix—that is, gender derivation remains as in standard Esperanto, but the language gains a simple way of saying &quot;a parent&quot;—or &quot;in addition to&quot; a masculine suffix, often to avoid confusion between people speaking reformed and standard Esperanto. The only such affix commonly seen is the prefix . In standard Esperanto, means both sexes together, and is normally only seen in the plural. In conversation, however, singular is not uncommonly extended to meanings such as &quot;a parent&quot; when a speaker either doesn&#x27;t know or doesn&#x27;t wish to reveal the gender of the noun. Many gender-reform proposals would make such usage official.

People who use for &quot;father&quot; may avoid the unaffixed noun &quot;*parent&quot; altogether as ambiguous, or may use it and switch to only when they need to disambiguate.

=== Treatment of gendered words ===
Many of these proposals propose that all gender-changing words such as become neutral once a masculine suffix is in use, with the only remaining gendered words being those such as and that never changed gender to begin with. However, since has numerous masculine uses, and there are already dedicated words for the neutral and feminine equivalents ( &quot;adult&quot; or &quot;grownup&quot;, and &quot;woman&quot;), is also commonly retained as a masculine root.

The word &quot;eunuch&quot; has through back-formation given rise to the suffix for castrated people or animals, creating forms such as &quot;steer&quot;, from &quot;cattle&quot;, to replace &quot;steer&quot;, though &quot;ex-&quot; is sometimes seen in this context: &quot;castrated cat&quot; (lit. &quot;ex-male-cat&quot;) vs. .

== Gender-neutral pronouns ==
As in English, Esperanto has a personal pronoun for &quot;he&quot;, , and &quot;she&quot;, . Paraphrasing &quot;he or she&quot; to avoid mentioning gender is, as in English, considered awkward, exclusive, and is avoided in conversation and literature. There are two general approaches to resolving this issue: modifying an existing pronoun, and creating a new pronoun.

=== Extending the range of an existing pronoun ===
The existing third-person pronouns are &quot;he&quot; (the pronoun traditionally used when gender is not known), &quot;she&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, (reflexive), &quot;that one&quot;.

 is used principally with animals and objects. Zamenhof also prescribed it to be the epicene pronoun for people when the gender of an individual is unknown, saying it was &quot;completely correct grammatically&quot;. He most often used it for children, but also for adults with known gender:
: &quot;the child is crying, because it wants to eat&quot;.
: &quot;They are the lord of our place, lord viscount of ...&quot;
The idea that cannot be used for people is due to its use as a neuter pronoun. In Zamenhof&#x27;s day it was customary to specify gender whenever it was known . A shift from and to would thus be a stylistic extension similar to the ongoing shift from copula-plus-adjective to verb (such as for ), and nothing so radical as the creation of a new pronoun would be required.

However, when gender becomes a problem it is much more common for people to use the demonstrative adjective and pronoun (that one) as a work-around. Unfortunately, this remedy is not always available. For example, in the sentence,
: &quot;Someone just said that he is hungry&quot;,
the pronoun cannot easily be replaced with , as that would normally be understood to refer to someone other than the person speaking:
: &quot;Someone just said that that person is hungry&quot;.
Similar problems of confusion arise with trying to use &quot;one&quot; in such situations:
: &quot;Someone just said that one is hungry&quot;.
This could be used to express deference or other forms of indirectness, but would not be understood to refer to the person who made the statement.

It would be possible to extend the use of reflexive pronoun , which officially cannot occur in subject position, to that of a logophoric pronoun:
: &quot;Someone just said that himself/herself is hungry&quot;.
Although not a full solution, as refers to a previously mentioned person, this could be used in combination with to introduce a subject. It also has the advantage of clarifying the sentence, since it is ambiguous in standard Esperanto whether &quot;he&quot; refers to the someone who is speaking, or someone else. However, logophoric pronouns are alien to European languages, and this solution is rare.

Due to English influence, singular &quot;they&quot; has been reported:
: &quot;Someone just said that they are hungry.&quot;

However this causes problems regarding Esperanto’s noun agreements and is not readily accepted by people of other language backgrounds.

A proposal is to hyphenate (&quot;he&quot;) and (&quot;she&quot;) to or , similar to some other constructs in Esperanto, such as (&quot;more or less&quot;).

=== New pronouns ===
Existing Esperanto personal pronouns end in &quot;i&quot;, and only two proposals for a new pronoun are at all common: and the blend .

As of 2019, is the most popular gender-neutral pronoun proposal.

Another proposal is the blend , the reading pronunciation of the abbreviation &quot;s/he&quot;. It is frequently seen in informal writing.

=== Gender in plural pronouns ===
In addition to removing gender from the singular pronouns, proposals have also been made to add gender to the plural in order to better translate material (such as the Bible) that was written in a language that has plural gender.

Due to the symmetry between &quot;he&quot; and &quot;ili&quot; &quot;they&quot;, the obvious choice is to make masculine and to create an analogous feminine form, . This was proposed by Kálmán Kalocsay and Gaston Waringhien in the third edition of their &quot;Plena Gramatiko de Esperanto&quot; (pp 72–73, note 1). They cited the biblical passage Matthew 28:10-11:
:&quot;Then Jesus said to them [the women], “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.” While they were going, ...&quot;

It is obvious from context that &quot;They will see me there&quot; refers to the brothers. However, the identity of the &quot;they&quot; in &quot;While they were going&quot; is completely opaque. Kalocsay and Waringhien proposed the following solution:

<text>Paul Klebnikov (; June 3, 1963  – July 9, 2004) was an American journalist and historian of Russia. He worked for &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine for more than 10 years and at the time of his death was chief editor of the Russian edition of &quot;Forbes&quot;. His murder in Moscow in 2004 was seen as a blow against investigative journalism in Russia. Three Chechens accused of taking part in the murder were acquitted. Though the murder appeared to be the work of assassins for hire, as of 2022, the alleged organizers of the murder had yet to be identified. According to another version, widely reported in Russian media, Klebnikov was killed by a close associate to the high-ranking member of linked both to the Russian FSS service and Boris Berezovsky, a Russian oligarch.

==Early life==
Paul Klebnikov was born in New York to an aristocratic family of Russian American White émigrés with a long military and political tradition: his great-great-great-grandfather Ivan Pushchin participated in the Decembrist revolt in 1825 and was exiled to Siberia, and his great-grandfather, an admiral in the White Russian fleet, was assassinated by Bolsheviks. As a child, he was known as a daredevil including swimming during hurricanes. He attended St. Bernard&#x27;s School and Phillips Exeter Academy, and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a BA in political science in 1984. He then enrolled in the Officer Candidates School of the US Marine Corps as a way to test himself, but upon completing the course, declined to take the offered commission.

Instead, he pursued a PhD at the London School of Economics, where he would go on to win the Leonard Schapiro Prize &quot;for excellence in Russian studies&quot;. Klebnikov wrote his doctoral thesis on agrarian reform in Russia following the Stolypin Reforms that sought to build an independent, progressive, and prosperous peasantry. His thesis was titled &quot;Agricultural Development in Russia, 1906-1917: Land Reform, Social Agronomy and Cooperation&quot;. From 1987 to 1988, he lectured at the Institute of European Studies in London.

On September 22, 1991, he married Helen &quot;Musa&quot; Train, the daughter of prominent Wall Street banker John Train. The couple would go on to have three children.

== Reporting on Russia ==
Klebnikov joined &quot;Forbes&quot; in 1989 and gained a reputation for investigating murky post-Soviet business dealings and corruption. In 1996, he wrote a cover story for &quot;Forbes&quot; titled &quot;Godfather of the Kremlin?&quot; with the kicker &#x27;Power. Politics. Murder. Boris Berezovsky could teach the guys in Sicily a thing or two.&#x27;, comparing Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky to the Sicilian mafia. The article was published without a byline, but was widely known to be Klebnikov&#x27;s work. Klebnikov soon received death threats, and took a break from reporting in Russia to live with his family in Paris.

Berezovsky subsequently sued &quot;Forbes&quot; for libel in a British court. Because the story had been published in an American magazine about a Russian citizen, the choice of venue was described by several authorities as libel tourism. Berezovsky won a partial retraction of the story in 2003.

Meanwhile, Klebnikov expanded the article into the 2000 book &quot;Godfather of the Kremlin: Boris Berezovsky and the Looting of Russia&quot;. Believed to be based heavily on interviews with Alexander Korzhakov, the head of security for former president Boris Yeltsin, the book described the privatization process used by Yeltsin as &quot;the robbery of the century&quot; and detailed the alleged corruption of various Russian businesspeople, particularly focusing on Berezovsky. The book met with mixed reviews in journalistic circles. A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised it as &quot;richly detailed&quot; and &quot;effectively angry&quot;.

Klebnikov released a second book, &quot;Conversation with a Barbarian: Interviews with a Chechen Field Commander on Banditry and Islam&quot;, in 2003. The book is a transcript of a lengthy interview with Chechen rebel leader Khozh-Ahmed Noukhayev, conducted in Baku, Azerbaijan. In the course of the interview, Nukhayev gives his views on Islam and Chechen society.

In the same year, Klebnikov was chosen to be the first editor of the Russian edition of &quot;Forbes&quot;. Because his wife and children did not wish to move to Russia, Klebnikov agreed with them that he would take the post for only one year. The magazine only put out four issues before his death, including an article covering Russia&#x27;s 100 wealthiest individuals, which some commentators speculate may have been the reason for his death.

==Murder==
On July 9, 2004, while leaving the &quot;Forbes&quot; office, Klebnikov was attacked on a Moscow street late at night by unknown assailants who fired at him from a slowly moving car. Klebnikov was shot four times and initially survived, but he died at the hospital after being transported in an ambulance that had no oxygen bottle, and delays when a hospital elevator broke down.

Authorities described the attack as a contract killing. The publisher of the Russian edition of &quot;Forbes&quot; stated that the murder was &quot;definitely linked&quot; to Klebnikov&#x27;s journalism. Various commentators have speculated that the magazine&#x27;s recent story on Russia&#x27;s 100 richest people may have triggered the attack; others suspect Berezovsky of being behind the murder.

===Russian investigation===
In 2006, prosecutors accused Chechen rebel leader Khozh-Ahmed Noukhayev, subject of Klebnikov&#x27;s book &quot;A Conversation with a Barbarian&quot;, of masterminding the attack. Three Chechen men—Kazbek Dukuzov, Musa Vakhayev, and Fail Sadretdinov—were arrested and tried in a closed trial for the murder, but all three were acquitted. Sadretdinov was later convicted on unrelated charges and sentenced to nine years&#x27; imprisonment, while Vakhayev and Dukuzov had their acquittals overturned by the Supreme Court of Russia, allowing them to be re-prosecuted.

In July 2007, on the third anniversary of the murder, the U.S. Department of State protested the continuing failure of the Russian government to find the perpetrators, calling for further investigation. U.S. President George W. Bush also appealed directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin for action.

Vakhayev and Dukuzov were scheduled to be retried in 2007, again in a closed trial, but could not be located. On December 17, the trial was postponed again because of Dukuzov&#x27;s continued absence. The process then &quot;quietly stalled&quot;.

In July 2009, Russian authorities agreed to reopen the suspended investigation into the killings. They also stated that they no longer believed Nukhayev had masterminded the murder (though they continued to believe he played some role in the attack).

==Legacy==
In 2004, the Committee to Protect Journalists posthumously named Klebnikov one of four winners of the CPJ International Press Freedom Awards.

An organization named the Paul Klebnikov Fund was established in his memory to award an annual courage prize to journalists as well as granting internships to young Russian journalists to work in Western media.

Klebnikov&#x27;s Exeter classmates endowed an annual Klebnikov Lecture to honor his memory. The first Klebnikov Lecture was held on May 12, 2006, at the 25th reunion of Klebnikov&#x27;s Exeter class (1981), and featured remarks by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; correspondent and Exeter alumnus Jon Karp.

=== Project Klebnikov ===
Project Klebnikov is a global alliance specifically devoted to developing new information on the Klebnikov murder and to furthering some of the investigative work Klebnikov began. The organization was founded in July 2005, and includes over 20 journalists and partner media companies. The organization has an international representation of investigative journalists, including individuals from &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, New York University&#x27;s department of journalism, &quot;The Economist&quot;, Bloomberg News and &quot;Forbes&quot;. It was launched by eight journalists from Bloomberg, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Forbes&quot; on July 9, 2005, the anniversary of Klebnikov&#x27;s murder. Journalist Richard Behar serves as the organization&#x27;s director.

<text>The Harvard-Kyoto Convention is a system for transliterating Sanskrit and other languages that use the Devanāgarī script into ASCII. It is predominantly used informally in e-mail, and for electronic texts.

==Harvard-Kyoto system==
Prior to the Unicode era, the following Harvard-Kyoto scheme was developed for putting a fairly large amount of Sanskrit textual material into machine readable format without the use of diacritics as used in IAST. Instead of diacritics it uses upper case letters. Since it employs both upper and lower case letters in its scheme, proper nouns&#x27; first letter capitalization format cannot be followed. Because it is without diacritics, it enables one to input texts with a minimum motion of the fingers on the keyboard. For the consonants, the differences to learn are: compared to IAST, all letters with an underdot are typed as the same letter capitalized; guttural and palatal nasals (ṅ, ñ) as the corresponding upper case voiced plosives (G, J); IAST ḷ, ḻ, ḻh are quite rare; the only transliteration that needs to be remembered is z for ś. The vowels table, the significant difference is for the sonorants and Anusvāra, visarga are capitalized instead of their diacritics. Finally, it is fairly readable with practice.

==Vowels==
==Sonorants==
==Anusvāra and visarga==
==Consonants==
==Conversion to Devanagari==
Sanskrit text encoded in the Harvard-Kyoto convention can be unambiguously converted to Devanāgarī, with two exceptions: Harvard-Kyoto does not distinguish अइ (&quot;a&quot; followed by &quot;i&quot;, in separate syllables, i.e. in hiatus) from ऐ (the diphthong &quot;ai&quot;) or अउ (&quot;a&quot; followed by &quot;u&quot;) from औ (the diphthong &quot;au&quot;). However such a vowel hiatus would occur extremely rarely inside words. Such a hiatus most often occurs in sandhi &quot;between&quot; two words (e.g. a sandhi of a word ending in &#x27;aH&#x27; and one beginning with &#x27;i&#x27; or &#x27;u&#x27;). Since in such a situation a text transliterated in Harvard-Kyoto would introduce a space between the &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;i&#x27; (or &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;u&#x27;) no ambiguity would result.

== Harvard-Kyoto method for modern Russian language ==
This method allows not only determining the correct pronunciation of Russian words but also maintains the Russian orthography, since a single Harvard-Kyoto letter corresponds to each Russian one. There is no need for diacritical signs and potential digraph confusion is prevented. All symbols are available on standard keyboards.

The Harvard-Kyoto system doesn&#x27;t preserve upper-case letters, which is not an issue when only considering pronunciation. But the symbol &quot;^&quot;, if desired, may give the hint that next letter is capitalized (^b = Б). As well, an apostrophe sign may be used to introduce a &quot;stress&quot; sign if necessary (za&#x27;mok – &quot;castle&quot;; zamo&#x27;k – &quot;lock&quot;).

<doc id="803597" wikidata="Q838988" url="?curid=803597" title="Ecumene">
<text>In ancient Greece, the term oecumene (UK) or ecumene (US; ) denoted the known, inhabited, or habitable world. In Greek antiquity, it referred to the portions of the world known to Hellenic geographers, subdivided into three continents: Africa, Europe, and Asia. Under the Roman Empire, it came to refer to civilization itself, as well as the secular and religious imperial administration.

In present usage, it is most often used in the context of &quot;ecumenical&quot; and describes the Christian Church as a unified whole, or the unified modern world civilization. It is also used in cartography to describe a type of world map (&quot;mappa mundi&quot;) used in late antiquity and the Middle Ages.

==Etymology==
The Greek term cited above is the feminine present middle participle of the verb (, &#x27;(I) inhabit&#x27;) and is a clipped form of (, &#x27;inhabited world&#x27;).

==Greece==
Ancient Greek and Roman geographers knew the approximate size of the globe, but remained ignorant of many parts of it. Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276–196 BC) deduced the circumference of the Earth with remarkable accuracy, within 10% of the correct value. The Greek cartographer Crates created a globe about 150 BC.

Claudius Ptolemy (83–161) calculated the Earth&#x27;s surface in his &quot;Geography&quot; and described the inhabited portion as spanning 180 degrees of longitude, from the Fortunate Isles in the west to Serica (northern China) in the east and about 80 degrees of latitude, from Thule in the north to anti-Meroë below the equator. At its widest possible extent, the ancient ecumene thus stretched from northern Europe to equatorial Africa, and from the Atlantic Ocean to western China.

During the Middle Ages, this picture of the world was widened to accommodate Scandinavia, the North Atlantic, East Asia, and eventually sub-equatorial Africa. Ptolemy and other ancient geographers were well aware that they had a limited view of the ecumene, and that their knowledge extended to only a quarter of the globe.

These geographers acknowledged the existence of terrae incognitae, &#x27;unknown lands&#x27;, within Africa, Europe and Asia. A belief in global symmetry led many Greco-Roman geographers to posit other continents elsewhere on the globe, which existed in balance with the ecumene: Perioeci ( &#x27;beside the ecumene&#x27;), Antoeci (&#x27;opposite the ecumene&#x27;) and the Antipodes (&#x27;opposite the feet&#x27;).

==Rome==
The cameo Gemma Augustea includes a Roman artistic personification of Oikoumene as she crowns an emperor, probably Augustus, perhaps for bringing peace to the (Roman) world.
The word was adopted within Christianity after Constantine the Great&#x27;s assembly of a synod of bishops from all over the world at the First Council of Nicaea in 325.

By that time, the Greek term had come to refer more specifically to the civilized world and then simply the Roman Empire. This usage continued after the Diocletian Reforms and the Byzantine emperors used it to refer to their imperial administration. Constantinople was the &quot;Ecumenical City&quot; and, after 586, the Patriarch of Constantinople was known as the &quot;Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople&quot;.

Pope Gregory I objected to the adoption of this style by John IV of Constantinople, as it implied a universal jurisdiction he believed illegal to anyone. His Fifth Epistle berates John for having &quot;attempted to seize upon a new name, whereby the hearts of all your brethren might have come to take offence&quot;, despite the title having been granted at the emperor Maurice&#x27;s behest.

The name continues to be borne by the Greek Orthodox patriarchs, although with the more restricted sense that they are the bishops of the former imperial capital.

==Modernity==
===Religion===


Especially in the 20th century, the term has been employed to refer to unified Christian Church which is the ultimate goal of Ecumenism, a movement to promote cooperation among the various Christian denominations. The movement is not accepted by many Christian groups. The work of ecumenism takes place in the form of negotiations conducted between committees of various denominations and also through the deliberations of inter-denominational organizations such as the World Council of Churches who have registered as their web domain oikoumene.org. Relevant issues include Baptism, the Eucharist and Ministry.

===Culture===
In the context of cultural history, Lewis Mumford used the term &quot;ecumene&quot; in an academic sense in his work, &quot;Technics and Civilization&quot; (1934). William H. McNeill later popularized it in his &quot;Rise of the West&quot; (1963), suggesting that a single global ecumene emerged through the dominance of European political institutions, science, technology, and economic forms from the late 18th century onwards. One could argue that prior to the great voyages of discovery carried out by Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, and Ferdinand Magellan, there were originally two separate ecumenes—one covering the Old World and one the New. The Spanish conquistadores fused these two ecumenes to form a single integrated &quot;world system&quot;.

Peter Sloterdijk uses the terms &quot;First Ecumene&quot; and &quot;Second Ecumene&quot; in his book &quot;In the World Interior of Capital&quot; (2014, original German: &quot;Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals&quot;, 2005). Sloterdijk takes these terms directly from the work of Eric Voegelin, specifically from &quot;Order and History&quot; vol. 4, &quot;The Ecumenic Age&quot; (1974), which he quotes.

Science fiction writer Ursula Le Guin derived the term Ekumen in her Hainish Cycle from this term.

The term &quot;ecumene&quot; can differ depending on the viewpoint from which it is perceived: for example, the Ancient Babylonians and the Ancient Greeks would each have known a different area of the world (though their worlds may have overlapped).

===Cartography===
The term is used in cartography and historical cartography to describe a type of map, namely the symbolic, schematic world maps made in late antiquity and the Middle Ages.

<doc id="803607" wikidata="Q1076421" url="?curid=803607" title="Chorea">
<text>Chorea, or (rarely) choreia, () is an abnormal involuntary movement disorder, characterized by quick movements of the hands or feet. It is one of a group of neurological disorders called dyskinesias. The term &quot;chorea&quot; is derived , as the movements of the body is comparable to dancing.

The term hemichorea refers to chorea of one side of the body, such as chorea of one arm but not both (analogous to hemiballismus).

==Presentation==

Chorea is characterized by brief, semi-directed, irregular movements that are not repetitive or rhythmic, but appear to flow from one muscle to the next. These &#x27;dance-like&#x27; movements of chorea often occur with athetosis, which adds twisting and writhing movements. Walking may become difficult and include odd postures and leg movements. Unlike ataxia, which affects the quality of voluntary movements, or Parkinsonism, which is a hindrance of voluntary movements, the movements of chorea and ballism occur on their own, without conscious effort. Thus, chorea is said to be a hyperkinetic movement disorder. When chorea is serious, slight movements will become thrashing motions; this form of severe chorea is referred to as ballism, or ballismus.

==Causes==
===Huntington&#x27;s disease===
Huntington&#x27;s disease is a neurodegenerative disease and most common inherited cause of chorea. The condition was formerly called Huntington&#x27;s chorea but was renamed because of the important non-choreic features including cognitive decline and behavioural change.

===Other genetic causes===
Other genetic causes of chorea are rare. They include the classical Huntington&#x27;s disease &#x27;mimic&#x27; or phenocopy syndromes, called Huntington&#x27;s disease-like syndrome types 1, 2 and 3; inherited prion disease, the spinocerebellar ataxias type 1, 3 and 17, neuroacanthocytosis, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), brain iron accumulation disorders, Wilson&#x27;s disease, benign hereditary chorea, Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia, mitochondrial disease and Rett syndrome.

===Acquired causes===
The most common acquired causes of chorea are cerebrovascular disease and, in the developing world, HIV infection—usually through its association with cryptococcal disease.

Sydenham&#x27;s chorea occurs as a complication of streptococcal infection. Twenty percent (20%) of children and adolescents with rheumatic fever develop Sydenham&#x27;s chorea as a complication. It is increasingly rare, which may be partially due to penicillin, improved social conditions, and/or a natural reduction in the bacteria (Streptococcus) it has stemmed from. Psychological symptoms may precede or accompany this acquired chorea and may be relapsing and remitting. The broader spectrum of paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection can cause chorea and are collectively referred to as PANDAS.

Chorea gravidarum refers to choreic symptoms that occur during pregnancy. If left untreated, the disease resolves in 30% of patients before delivery but, in the other 70%, it persists. The symptoms then progressively disappear in the next few days following the delivery.

Chorea may also be caused by drugs (commonly levodopa, anti-convulsants and anti-psychotics).

Other acquired causes include CSF leak, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, polycythaemia rubra vera, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, coeliac disease and gluten ataxia.

==Treatment==
There is no standard course of treatment for chorea. Treatment depends on the type of chorea and the associated disease. Although there are many drugs that can control it, no cure has yet been identified.

== History ==
Historically, choreas like Huntington disease and Sydenham&#x27;s chorea were called Saint Vitus&#x27; dance, related to a series of social phenomena of the same name.

<text>Choreia () is a circle dance accompanied by singing (see Greek chorus, &quot;choros&quot;), in ancient Greece. Homer refers to this dance in his epic poem, the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

Terms descended from Greek &quot;choreia&quot; that are used for circle dances in a number of other countries are:

* horon, in Turkey
* khorovod (хоровод), in Russia
* khora (хора), in Ukraine
* hora, in Romania and Moldova

<text>Herbert Jansch (3 November 1943 – 5 October 2011) was a Scottish folk musician and founding member of the band Pentangle. He was born in Glasgow and came to prominence in London in the 1960s as an acoustic guitarist and singer-songwriter. He recorded more than 28 albums and toured extensively from the 1960s to the 21st century.

Jansch was a leading figure in the 1960s British folk revival, touring folk clubs and recording several solo albums, as well as collaborating with other musicians such as John Renbourn and Anne Briggs. In 1968, he co-founded the band Pentangle, touring and recording with them until their break-up in 1972. He then took a few years&#x27; break from music, returning in the late 1970s to work on a series of projects with other musicians. He joined a reformed Pentangle in the early 1980s and remained with them as they evolved through various changes of personnel until 1995. Until his death, Jansch continued to work as a solo artist.

Jansch&#x27;s work influenced many artists, especially Jimmy Page, Mike Oldfield, Paul Simon, Pete Hawkes, Nick Drake, Donovan, Neil Young, and Johnny Marr. He received two Lifetime Achievement Awards at the BBC Folk Awards: one, in 2001, for his solo achievements and the other, in 2007, as a member of Pentangle.

==Early years==
Herbert Jansch was born at Stobhill Hospital in the Springburn district of Glasgow, on 3 November 1943, the descendant of a family originally from Hamburg, Germany, who settled in Scotland during the Victorian era. The family name is most often pronounced as , although Jansch himself, like several other members of his family, pronounced it .

Jansch was brought up in the residential area of Edinburgh known as West Pilton, where he attended Pennywell Primary School and Ainslie Park Secondary School. As a teenager, he acquired a guitar and started visiting a local folk club (&quot;The Howff&quot;) run by Roy Guest. There, he met Archie Fisher and Jill Doyle (Davey Graham&#x27;s half-sister), who introduced him to the music of Big Bill Broonzy, Pete Seeger, Brownie McGhee and Woody Guthrie. He also met and shared a flat with Robin Williamson, who remained a friend when Jansch later moved to London.

After leaving school, Jansch took a job as a nurseryman then, in August 1960, he gave this up, intending to become a full-time musician. He appointed himself as an unofficial caretaker at The Howff and, as well as sleeping there, he may have received some pay to supplement his income as a novice performer who did not own his own guitar. He spent the next two years playing one-night stands in British folk clubs. This was a musical apprenticeship that exposed him to a range of influences, including Martin Carthy and Ian Campbell, but especially Anne Briggs, from whom he learned some of the songs (such as &quot;Blackwaterside&quot; and &quot;Reynardine&quot;) that would later feature strongly in his recording career.

Jansch travelled around Europe and beyond between 1963 and 1965, hitch-hiking from place to place, living on earnings from busking and casual musical performances in bars and cafes. In Scotland he became involved with Licorice McKechnie, who was a teenager at the time. A marriage was planned and the banns were published, but the wedding never took place. Jansch left her behind to travel to Morocco in 1963, and she took up with Robin Williamson of the Incredible String Band. Before leaving Glasgow, Jansch married a 16-year-old girl, Lynda Campbell. It was a marriage of convenience which allowed her to travel with him, as she was too young to have her own passport. They split up after a few months, and Jansch was eventually repatriated to Britain after catching dysentery in Tangiers.

==London (mid-1960s)==
Jansch moved to London. There, in 1963, at the invitation of Bob Wilson – a Staffordshire folksinger who was also an art student at St Martin&#x27;s School of Art – he was asked to take over as resident singer at Bunjies on Litchfield Street with Charles Pearce, another art student. They remained in that situation for a year before Pearce moved to south London to run several clubs south of the Thames. There was a burgeoning interest in folk music throughout London by then. There, he met the engineer and producer Bill Leader, at whose home they made a recording of Jansch&#x27;s music on a reel-to-reel tape recorder. Leader sold the tape for £100 to Transatlantic Records, who produced an album directly from it. The album &quot;Bert Jansch&quot; was released in 1965, and went on to sell 150,000 copies. It included Jansch&#x27;s protest song &quot;Do You Hear Me Now&quot;, which was brought to the attention of the pop music mainstream later that year by the singer Donovan, who covered it on his &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; EP, which reached No. 1 in the UK EP chart and No. 27 in the singles chart. Pearce disappeared from Jansch&#x27;s life after arranging for him to be one of the artists in the Liberal International concert, &quot;Master of the Guitar&quot; at the Royal Festival Hall in 1968. Also included on Jansch&#x27;s first album was his song &quot;Needle of Death&quot;, a stark anti-drugs lament written after a friend died of a heroin overdose.

In his early career, Jansch was sometimes characterized as a British Bob Dylan. During this period, Jansch stated that his musical influences were few: &quot;the only three people that I&#x27;ve ever copied were Big Bill Broonzy, Davy Graham and Archie Fisher.&quot; Jansch followed his first album with two more, produced in quick succession: &quot;It Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot; and &quot;Jack Orion,&quot; which contained his first recording of &quot;Blackwaterside&quot;, later to be taken up by Jimmy Page and recorded by Led Zeppelin as &quot;Black Mountain Side&quot;. Jansch said, &quot;The accompaniment was nicked by a well-known member of one of the most famous rock bands, who used it, unchanged, on one of their records.&quot; Transatlantic took legal advice about the alleged copyright infringement, and was advised that there was &quot;a distinct possibility that Bert might win an action against Page.&quot; Ultimately, Transatlantic was dubious about the costs involved in taking on Led Zeppelin in the courts, and half the costs would have had to be paid by Jansch personally, which he simply could not afford, so the case was never pursued. The arrangement and recording of &quot;Jack Orion&quot; was greatly influenced by Jansch&#x27;s friend, singer Anne Briggs.

In London, Jansch met other innovative acoustic guitar players, including John Renbourn, with whom he shared a flat in Kilburn, Davy Graham, Wizz Jones, Roy Harper and Paul Simon. They would all meet and play in various London music clubs, including the Troubadour in Old Brompton Road, and Les Cousins club in Greek Street, Soho. Renbourn and Jansch frequently played together, developing their own intricate interplay between the two guitars, often referred to as &quot;Folk baroque&quot;.

In 1966, they recorded the &quot;Bert and John&quot; album together, featuring much of this material. Late in 1967, they tired of the all-nighters at Les Cousins and became the resident musicians at a music venue set up by Bruce Dunnet, a Scottish entrepreneur, at the Horseshoe pub (now defunct), at 264–267 Tottenham Court Road. This became the haunt of a number of musicians, including the singer Sandy Denny. Another singer, Jacqui McShee, began performing with the two guitarists and, with the addition of Danny Thompson (string bass) and Terry Cox (drums), they formed the group Pentangle. The venue evolved into a jazz club, but by then the group had moved on.

On 19 October 1968, Jansch married Heather Sewell. At the time, she was an art student and had been the girlfriend of Roy Harper. She inspired several of Jansch&#x27;s songs and instrumentals, the most obvious being &quot;Miss Heather Rosemary Sewell&quot; from his 1968 album &quot;Birthday Blues&quot;, but Jansch says that, despite the name, &quot;M&#x27;Lady Nancy&quot; from the 1971 &quot;Rosemary Lane&quot; album was also written for her. As Heather Jansch, she became a well-known sculptor.

==Pentangle years: 1968–73==

Pentangle&#x27;s first major concert was at the Royal Festival Hall in 1967, and their first album, &quot;The Pentangle&quot;, was released in the following year. Pentangle embarked on a demanding schedule of touring the world and recording and, during this period, Jansch largely gave up solo performances. He did, however, continue to record, releasing &quot;Rosemary Lane&quot; in 1971. The tracks for this album were recorded on a portable tape recorder by Bill Leader at Jansch&#x27;s cottage in Ticehurst, Sussex—a process which took several months, with Jansch only working when he was in the right mood.

Pentangle reached their highest point of commercial success with the release of their &quot;Basket of Light&quot; album in 1969. The single &quot;Light Flight&quot;, taken from the album, became popular through its use as theme music for a TV drama series, &quot;Take Three Girls&quot;, for which the band also provided incidental music. In 1970, at the peak of their popularity, they recorded a soundtrack for the film &quot;Tam Lin&quot;, made at least 12 television appearances, and undertook tours of the UK (including the Isle of Wight Festival) and America (including a concert at Carnegie Hall). However, their fourth album, &quot;Cruel Sister&quot;, released in October 1970, was a commercial disaster. This was an album of traditional songs that included a 20-minute-long version of &quot;Jack Orion&quot;, a song that Jansch and Renbourn had recorded previously as a duo on Jansch&#x27;s &quot;Jack Orion&quot; album.

Pentangle recorded two further albums, but the strains of touring and of working together as a band were taking their toll. Then Pentangle withdrew from their record company, Transatlantic, in a bitter dispute regarding royalties. The final album of the original incarnation of Pentangle was &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Seal&quot; released by Warner Brothers/Reprise in 1972. Colin Harper describes it as &quot;a record of people&#x27;s weariness, but also the product of a unit whose members were still among the best players, writers and musical interpreters of their day.&quot; Pentangle split up in January 1973, and Jansch and his wife bought a farm near Lampeter, in Wales, and withdrew temporarily from the concert circuit.

==Mid 1970s==
Jansch spent two or three years in California in the mid-1970s. He recorded most of his 1974 album &quot;LA Turnaround&quot; and 1975 album &quot;Santa Barbara Honeymoon&quot; while there. The making of &quot;LA Turnaround&quot; was documented in a film produced by Mike Nesmith.

==Late 1970s==
After two years as a farmer, Jansch left his wife and family and returned to music, although Jansch and his wife would not be formally divorced until 1988. In 1977, he recorded the album &quot;A Rare Conundrum&quot; with a new set of musicians: Mike Piggott, Rod Clements and Pick Withers. He then formed the band Conundrum with the addition of Martin Jenkins (violin) and Nigel Smith (bass). They spent six months touring Australia, Japan and the United States. With the end of the tour, Conundrum parted company and Jansch spent six months in the United States, where he recorded the &quot;Heartbreak&quot; album with Albert Lee.

Jansch toured Scandinavia, working as a duo with Martin Jenkins and, based on ideas they developed, recorded the &quot;Avocet&quot; album (initially released in Denmark). Jansch rated this as among his own favourites from his own recordings. On returning to England, he set up Bert Jansch&#x27;s Guitar Shop at 220, New King&#x27;s Road, Fulham. The shop specialised in hand-built acoustic guitars but was not a commercial success and closed after two years.

==1980s==
In 1980, an Italian promoter encouraged the original Pentangle to reform for a tour and a new album. The reunion started badly, with Terry Cox being injured in a car accident, resulting in the band&#x27;s debuting at the Cambridge Folk Festival as a four-piece Pentangle. They managed to complete a tour of Italy (with Cox in a wheelchair) and Australia, before Renbourn left the band in 1983. There then followed a series of personnel changes, including Mike Piggott replacing John Renbourn from 1983 to 1987 and recording &quot;Open the Door&quot; and &quot;In the Round&quot;, but ultimately leaving Jansch and McShee as the only original members. The final incarnation consisting of Jansch, McShee, Nigel Portman Smith (keyboards), Peter Kirtley (guitar and vocals) and Gerry Conway (drums) survived from 1987 to 1995 and recorded three albums: &quot;Think of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;One More Road&quot; and &quot;Live 1994&quot;.

In 1985, two limited edition albums appeared, issued under the name of Loren Auerbach, who was to become Jansch&#x27;s wife: &quot;After the Long Night&quot; was released in February 1985, the second, &quot;Playing the Game&quot;, appearing in October. Jansch was initially a guest player, but also became a writer on some of the songs, as well as an arranger and co-vocalist. Richard Newman was the primary guitarist and songwriter. Auerbach had worked alongside Newman for many years before meeting Jansch. Newman and Jansch were the key players on &quot;After the Long Night&quot;. On &quot;Playing the Game&quot;, Jansch and Newman joined Cliff Aungier, Geoff Bradford (lead guitarist from Cyril Davis&#x27; All Stars, from Long John Baldry&#x27;s Hoochie Coochie Men, and in the first line-up of The Rolling Stones) and Brian Knight (British blues veteran of the Blues By Six). The two albums became one—&quot;After The Long Night / Playing The Game&quot;. Jansch played guitar with Richard Newman on the following Newman songs: &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go Back&quot;, &quot;Smiling Faces&quot;, &quot;Playing the Game&quot;, &quot;Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Days and Nights&quot;, &quot;The Rainbow Man&quot;, &quot;Frozen Beauty&quot;, &quot;Christabel&quot;, &quot;So Lonely&quot; and &quot;The Miller&quot;. All songs were sung by Auerbach with the exception of &quot;The Miller&quot;, which was sung by Newman. Jansch married Auerbach in 1999.

He had always been a heavy drinker, but in 1987 Jansch fell ill while working with Rod Clements and Marty Craggs, and was rushed to hospital, where he was told that he was &quot;as seriously ill as you can be without dying&quot; and that he had a choice of &quot;giving up alcohol or simply giving up.&quot; He chose the former option: Colin Harper states that &quot;There can be no doubt that Bert&#x27;s creativity, reliability, energy, commitment and quality of performance were all rescued dramatically by the decision to quit boozing.&quot; Jansch and Clements continued the work they had started before Jansch&#x27;s illness, resulting in the 1988 &quot;Leather Launderette&quot; album.

==Final years and death: 1992–2011==

Bert was the prime mover in the &quot;Acoustic Routes&quot; film, first broadcast by the BBC in 1992. It shows him revisiting his old haunts and reminiscing with guests such as Al Stewart, Anne Briggs, John Renbourn, and Davy Graham.

From 1995, Jansch appeared frequently at the 12 Bar Club in Denmark Street, London. One of his live sets there was recorded direct to Digital Audio Tape (DAT) by Jansch&#x27;s then manager, Alan King, and was released as the &quot;Live at the 12 Bar: an official bootleg&quot; album in 1996. In 2002, Jansch, Bernard Butler and Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Hodge performed live together at the Jazz Cafe, London. Butler had also appeared on Jansch&#x27;s album of that year, &quot;Edge of a Dream&quot;, which features (among others) Ralph McTell and guitarist Paul Wassif. The instrumental &quot;Black Cat Blues&quot;, featuring Wassif, appears in the 2003 film &quot;Calendar Girls&quot;, and Wassif became a frequent sideman at Bert&#x27;s live shows. In 2003, Jansch celebrated his 60th birthday with a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. The BBC organised a concert for Jansch and various guests at the church of St Luke Old Street, which was televised on BBC Four.

In 2005, Jansch teamed up again with one of his early influences, Davy Graham, for a small number of concerts in England and Scotland. His concert tour had to be postponed, owing to illness, and Jansch underwent major heart surgery in late 2005. By 2006, he had recovered and was playing concerts again. Jansch&#x27;s album &quot;The Black Swan&quot;, his first for four years, was released on Sanctuary on 18 September 2006, featuring Beth Orton and Devendra Banhart on tracks &quot;Katie Cruel&quot;, &quot;When the Sun Comes Up&quot; and &quot;Watch the Stars&quot;, among other guests. In 2007, he was featured on Babyshambles album, &quot;Shotter&#x27;s Nation&quot;, playing acoustic guitar on the song &quot;The Lost Art of Murder&quot;. After recording, he accompanied Babyshambles&#x27; lead singer Pete Doherty on several acoustic gigs, and performed on the Pete and Carl Reunion Gig, where Libertines and Dirty Pretty Things frontman and guitarist Carl Barât joined Doherty on stage.

In 2009, he played a concert at the London Jazz Cafe to celebrate the release of three of his older albums (&quot;LA Turnaround&quot;, &quot;Santa Barbara Honeymoon&quot; and &quot;A Rare Conundrum&quot;) on CD format. However, later that year, due to an unexpected illness, he had to cancel a 22-date North American tour that was due to start on 26 June. Jansch&#x27;s website reported: &quot;Bert is very sorry to be missing the tour, and apologises to all the fans who were hoping to see him. He is looking forward to rescheduling as soon as possible.&quot;

Jansch opened for Neil Young on his &quot;Twisted Road&quot; solo tour in the US and Canada, starting on 18 May 2010. He also performed at Eric Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads festival in June 2010. These were Jansch&#x27;s first shows since his illness. One of his last recording sessions was with Eric Clapton for Paul Wassif&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Looking Up Feeling Down&quot;. Jansch again opened for Young&#x27;s 2011 tour, beginning on 15 April in Durham, North Carolina, and having a final solo performance in Chicago on 7 May. That same year, a few reunion gigs also took place with Pentangle, including performances at the Glastonbury Festival and one final concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London, which was also Jansch&#x27;s last ever public performance.

Jansch died on 5 October 2011, aged 67, at a hospice in Hampstead after a long battle with lung cancer. His wife, Loren Jansch (née Auerbach), died of cancer on 9 December 2011. They are both buried in Highgate Cemetery.

==Recognition and awards==
In 2001, Jansch received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, and on 5 June 2006, he received the MOJO Merit Award at the Mojo Honours List ceremony, based on &quot;an expanded career that still continues to be inspirational.&quot; The award was presented by Beth Orton and Roy Harper. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Jansch as No. 94 on its list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of all Time in 2003.

In January 2007, the five original members of Pentangle (including Jansch) were given a Lifetime Achievement award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. The award was presented by Sir David Attenborough. Producer John Leonard said &quot;Pentangle were one of the most influential groups of the late 20th century and it would be wrong for the awards not to recognise what an impact they had on the music scene.&quot; Pentangle played together for the event, for the first time in more than two decades, and their performance was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on 7 February 2007. In 2007, Jansch was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music by Edinburgh Napier University, &quot;in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the UK music industry.&quot;

==Music==
Jansch&#x27;s musical influences included Big Bill Broonzy and Brownie McGhee, whom he first saw playing at The Howff in 1960 and, much later, claimed that he&#x27;d &quot;still be a gardener&quot; if he hadn&#x27;t encountered McGhee and his music. Jansch was also strongly influenced by the British folk music tradition, particularly by Anne Briggs and, to a lesser extent, A.L. Lloyd. Other influences included jazz (notably Charles Mingus), early music (John Renbourn and Julian Bream) and other contemporary singer-songwriters – especially Clive Palmer. The other major influence was Davy Graham who, himself, brought together an eclectic mixture of musical styles. Also, in his formative years, Jansch had busked his way through Europe to Morocco, picking up musical ideas and rhythms from many sources. From these influences, he distilled his own individual guitar style.

Some of his songs feature a basic Travis picking style of right-hand playing, but these are often distinguished by unusual chord voicings or by chords with added notes. An example of this is his song &quot;Needle of Death&quot;, which features a simple picking style, though several of the chords are decorated with added ninths. Characteristically, the ninths are not the highest note of the chord, but appear in the middle of the arpeggiated finger-picking, creating a &quot;lumpiness&quot; to the sound.

Another characteristic feature was his ability to hold a chord in the lower strings while bending an upper string—often bending up from a semitone below a chord note. These can be heard clearly on songs such as &quot;Reynardine&quot; where the bends are from the diminished fifth to the perfect fifth. Jansch often fitted the accompaniment to the natural rhythm of the words of his songs, rather than playing a consistent rhythm throughout. This can lead to occasional bars appearing in unusual time signatures. For example, his version of the Ewan MacColl song &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, unlike most other covers of that song, switches from 4/4 time to 3/4 and 5/4. A similar disregard for conventional time signatures is found in several of his collaborative compositions with Pentangle: for instance, &quot;Light Flight&quot; from the &quot;Basket of Light&quot; album includes sections in 5/8, 7/8 and 6/4 time.

==Instruments==
Through the development of Pentangle, Jansch played a number of instruments: banjo, Appalachian dulcimer, recorder, and concertina—on rare occasions he was even known to play electric guitar. However, it is his acoustic guitar playing that was most notable.

Jansch&#x27;s first guitar was home-made from a kit but when he left school and started work, he bought a Höfner cello-style guitar. Soon he traded this in for a Zenith which was marketed as the &quot;Lonnie Donegan guitar&quot; and which Jansch played in the folk clubs in the early 1960s. His first album was reputedly recorded using a Martin 00028 borrowed from Martin Carthy. Pictures of Jansch in the middle 1960s show him playing a variety of models, including Martin and Epiphone guitars. He had a guitar hand-built by John Bailey, which was used for most of the Pentangle recordings but was eventually stolen.

Jansch later played two six-string guitars built by the Coventry-based luthier Rob Armstrong, one of which appears on the front and back covers of the 1980 Shanachie release, &quot;Best of Bert Jansch&quot;. He then had a contract with Yamaha, who provided him with an FG1500 which he played, along with a Yamaha LL11 1970s jumbo guitar. Jansch&#x27;s relationship with Yamaha continued and they presented him with an acoustic guitar with gold trim and abalone inlay for his 60th birthday—although Jansch was quoted as saying that, valued at about £3000, it was too good for stage use.

==Influence==
Jansch&#x27;s music, and particularly his acoustic guitar playing, have influenced a range of well-known musicians. His first album (&quot;Bert Jansch&quot;, 1965) was much admired, with Jimmy Page saying, &quot;At one point, I was absolutely obsessed with Bert Jansch. When I first heard that LP, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It was so far ahead of what everyone else was doing. No one in America could touch that.&quot; The same debut album included Jansch&#x27;s version of the Davy Graham instrumental &quot;Angie&quot;. This was a favourite of Mike Oldfield, who practised acoustic guitar alone as a child, and was then heavily influenced by Jansch&#x27;s style. The title of the instrumental inspired Oldfield to call his first band (with sister Sally) the Sallyangie.

Jansch&#x27;s version of &quot;Angie&quot; inspired Paul Simon&#x27;s recording of the piece, which was retitled &quot;Anji&quot; and appeared on the Simon &amp; Garfunkel album &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot;. From the same era, Neil Young is quoted as saying: &quot;As much of a great guitar player as Jimi [Hendrix] was, Bert Jansch is the same thing for acoustic guitar... and my favourite.&quot; Nick Drake and Donovan were both admirers of Jansch. Both recorded cover versions of his songs, and Donovan went on to dedicate two of his own songs to Jansch: &quot;Bert&#x27;s Blues&quot; appeared on his &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; LP, and &quot;House of Jansch&quot; on his fourth album &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot;. Other tributes included Gordon Giltrap&#x27;s album &quot;Janschology&quot; (2000) which has two tunes by Jansch, plus two others that show his influence.

Johnny Marr, who rose to prominence as the guitarist of the Smiths, named Jansch as one of his three biggest influences.

<doc id="803610" wikidata="Q1148834" url="?curid=803610" title="Guildford Four and Maguire Seven">
<text>The Guildford Four and Maguire Seven were two groups of people, mostly Northern Irish, who were wrongly convicted in English courts in 1975 and 1976 of the Guildford pub bombings of 5 October 1974 and the Woolwich pub bombing of 7 November 1974. All the convictions were eventually overturned in 1989 (for the Guildford Four) and 1991 (for the Maguire Seven) after long campaigns for justice, as were those of the Birmingham Six.

== Background ==
On 22 October 1975, at the Old Bailey in London, the Guildford Four were convicted of bombings carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). Subsequently, the Maguire Seven were convicted of handling explosives found during the investigation into the bombings. Both groups&#x27; convictions were eventually declared &quot;unsafe and unsatisfactory&quot; and reversed in 1989 and 1991, respectively, after they had served 15 to 16 years in prison.

Along with the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven, several other people faced charges relating to the bombings, six of whom were charged with murder, but these charges were dropped.

In the wake of the scandal, in October 1989 the UK Government appointed Appeal Court Justice Sir John May to undertake a judicial inquiry into the suspect convictions of the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven. The inquiry&#x27;s findings criticised the trial judge, Lord Donaldson of Lymington. It unearthed improprieties in the handling of scientific evidence that were relevant to the other cases and declared the convictions unsound and recommended referral back to the Court of Appeal, but no action was taken.

No one else has been charged with the Guildford and Woolwich bombings, or with supplying the material. Three police officers were charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice in the wake of the inquiry, but found not guilty in 1993.

Over 700 documents, including secret testimony, were collected by the inquiry and were due to be unsealed for public access in The National Archives on 1 January 2020, but on 31 December 2019 the Home Office removed all the documents from the National Archive and took them back into government control. The files remain sealed for now.

==Guildford Four==
The Guildford Four were charged with direct involvement with the IRA attacks. They were:
After their arrest, all four defendants confessed to the bombing under intense police interrogation. These confessions were later retracted but remained the basis of the case against them. They were later alleged to be the result of coercion by the police, ranging from intimidation to torture—including threats against family members—as well as the effects of drug withdrawal. Conlon wrote in his autobiography that a key factor in his coerced confession was that anti-terrorism laws passed in the early 1970s allowed the police to hold suspects without charges for up to a week, and that he might have been able to withstand the treatment he had received had a shorter time limit been in effect.

The four were convicted on 22 October 1975 of murder and other crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment—mandatory for adults convicted of murder. Richardson, a minor at the time of the bombings, received an indeterminate &quot;at Her Majesty&#x27;s pleasure&quot; sentence for murder and a life sentence for conspiracy. Justice Lord Donaldson of Lymington, who also presided over the Maguire Seven trial, expressed regret that the Four had not been charged with high treason, which still had a mandatory death penalty. Although no hangings had been carried out in the UK since 1964, treason still carried the death penalty until 1998. The usual practice was for judges to be consulted by the Home Secretary when considering release from a life sentence, rather than giving a tariff at trial, but the judge, believing he might be dead by the time they were released, recommended 30 years for Conlon, 35 for Armstrong, and until &quot;great age&quot; for Hill.

The Guildford Four did not &quot;fit the bill&quot; of IRA involvement according to the way they lived. Paddy Armstrong and Carole Richardson, an Englishwoman, lived in a squat and were involved with drugs and petty crime. Conlon asserted at several points in his autobiography that the IRA would not have taken him due to his record for shoplifting and other petty crimes, and that he had been expelled from Fianna Éireann, an Irish republican youth organisation with strong ties to the Provisional IRA.

==Maguire Seven==

The Maguire Seven were charged with possessing nitroglycerine allegedly passed to the IRA to make bombs after the police raided the West Kilburn house of Anne Maguire (Conlon&#x27;s aunt) on 3 December 1974.

They were tried and convicted on 4 March 1976 and received the following sentences:
Giuseppe Conlon had travelled from Belfast to help his son, Gerry Conlon, in the Guildford Four trial. Giuseppe, who had troubles with his lungs for many years, died in prison in January 1980, while the other six served their sentences and were released.

==Appeals==
The Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven sought leave to appeal their convictions immediately and were refused, but a growing body of disparate groups pressed for reexamination of the case.

In February 1977, during the trial of the Balcombe Street ASU, the four IRA men instructed their lawyers to &quot;draw attention to the fact that four totally innocent people were serving massive sentences&quot;, referring to the Guildford Four. Despite telling the police they were responsible, they were never charged with these offences and the Guildford Four remained in prison for another 12 years.

The Guildford Four tried to obtain from the Home Secretary a reference to the Court of Appeal under Section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (later repealed), but were unsuccessful. In 1987, the Home Office issued a memorandum recognising that it was unlikely they were terrorists, but that this would not be sufficient evidence for appeal.

===Campaigns===
After the 1977 court appeal failed, a number of &#x27;lone voices&#x27; publicly questioned the conviction; among them were David Martin in &quot;The Leveller&quot;, Gavin Esler and Chris Mullin in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and David McKittrick in the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot;. On 26 February 1980, BBC One Northern Ireland aired &quot;Spotlight: Giuseppe Conlon and the Bomb Factory&quot;, which contained an interview by Patrick Maguire and the BBC&#x27;s Gavin Esler.

===Quashing of the Guildford Four verdict===

In 1989, detectives from Avon and Somerset Constabulary, investigating the handling of the case, found significant pieces of evidence in relation to Surrey Police&#x27;s handling of the Guildford Four and their statements. Typed notes from Patrick Armstrong&#x27;s police interviews had been extensively edited. Deletions and additions had been made and the notes had been rearranged. The notes and their amendments were consistent with handwritten and typed notes presented at the trial, which suggested that the handwritten notes were made after the interviews had been conducted. The notes presented had been described in court as contemporaneous records. Manuscript notes relating to an interview with Hill showed that Hill&#x27;s fifth statement was taken in breach of Judges&#x27; Rules and may well have been inadmissible as evidence. The information was not made available to the DPP or the prosecution and the officers involved had denied under oath that such an interview had happened. Detention records were inconsistent with the times and durations of the claimed interviews, as reported by the Surrey police.

An appeal was already under way on the basis of other evidence. Lord Gifford represented Paul Hill, and others were represented by human rights solicitor Gareth Peirce. The appeal hearing had been adjourned to January 1990 at the request of the Guildford Four but once the findings of the Somerset and Avon report were available, the hearing was resumed, with the Crown saying it did not wish to support the convictions. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, concluded that, regardless of the impact of the content of the material Avon and Somerset discovered or the alibis or additional evidence the appellants wished to introduce, the level of duplicity meant that all the police evidence was suspect, and the case for the prosecution was unsafe.

Lane remarked:

The Four were released on 19 October 1989, after having their convictions quashed. Hill had also been convicted of the murder of a British soldier, Brian Shaw, based on his confession while in the custody of Surrey Police. This did not fall under the ambit of the Lane appeal, but he was released on bail pending his appeal against this conviction. In 1994, Her Majesty&#x27;s Court of Appeal in Belfast quashed Hill&#x27;s conviction for Shaw&#x27;s murder.

===Quashing of the Maguire verdicts===
On 12 July 1990, the Home Secretary, David Waddington, published &quot;Interim Report on the Maguire Case: The Inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the convictions arising out of the bomb attacks in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974&quot;, which criticised the trial judge, Donaldson, unearthed improprieties in the handling of scientific evidence, declared the convictions unsound, and recommended referral back to the Court of Appeal. The report &quot;strongly criticise[d] the decision by the prosecution at the Guildford Four&#x27;s trial not to disclose to the defence a statement supporting Mr Conlon&#x27;s alibi.&quot; The Maguire Seven&#x27;s convictions were quashed in 1991.

==Aftermath==

=== Guildford Four and Maguire Seven ===
Neither the bombings nor the wrongful imprisonment resulted in convictions. The bombings were most likely the work of the Balcombe Street ASU, which claimed responsibility. They were already serving life sentences, but were released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Three British police officers—Thomas Style, John Donaldson and Vernon Attwell—were charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, but each was found not guilty.

On 9 February 2005, Prime Minister Tony Blair apologised to the families of the 11 people imprisoned for the bombings in Guildford and Woolwich and those related to those who were still alive. He said, in part, &quot;I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice... they deserve to be completely and publicly exonerated.&quot;

The Roman Catholic Church awarded Anne Maguire a Benemerenti medal for her &#x27;remarkable ability to forgive&#x27; and her community work. In 1993, Hill married Courtney Kennedy, a daughter of assassinated U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a niece of assassinated president John F. Kennedy. They had a daughter, Saoirse, in 1997. Paul had a daughter, Cara, from a previous relationship with Gina Tohill. Paul and Courtney legally separated in 2006. Their daughter, Saoirse Kennedy Hill, died in 2019 at age 22.

Hill had a televised meeting with the brother of murdered soldier Brian Shaw, who continued to accuse him. He travelled to Colombia to attend the trial of the Colombia Three.

Gerry Conlon&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Proved Innocent&quot; was adapted into the film &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;, with actor Daniel Day-Lewis portraying Conlon. The film depicts Conlon&#x27;s attempt to rebuild his shattered relationship with his father but is partly fictional; Conlon never shared a cell with his father. He is reported to have settled with the government for compensation in the region of £500,000. Conlon gave support to Tommy Sheridan in relation to the charges brought against him.

Sarah Conlon, who spent 16 years campaigning to have the names of her husband and son cleared and helped secure the apology, died on 20 July 2008.

Paddy Armstrong had problems with drinking and gambling. He eventually married and moved to Dublin. Carole Richardson married and had a daughter soon after her release. She kept out of the public eye and died in 2012 aged 55.

The autobiography of the youngest member of the Maguire Seven, Patrick Maguire, &quot;My Father&#x27;s Watch: The Story of a Child Prisoner in 70s Britain&quot;, was released in 2008. It tells his story before, during, and after his imprisonment and details its impact on his life and those of his family.

Gerry Conlon later joined a campaign to free the &quot;Craigavon Two&quot;, Brendan McConville and John Paul Wootton, convicted of the murder of a police officer in Northern Ireland.

Conlon died at home in Belfast on 21 June 2014. His family issued a statement: &quot;He brought life, love, intelligence, wit and strength to our family through its darkest hours. He helped us to survive what we were not meant to survive. We recognise that what he achieved by fighting for justice for us had a far, far greater importance—it forced the world&#x27;s closed eyes to be opened to injustice; it forced unimaginable wickedness to be acknowledged; we believe it changed the course of history&quot;.

Sir John Donaldson went on to an illustrious judicial career and became Master of the Rolls, Head of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal. The appeal case itself for &quot;R v Maguire 1981&quot;, is now the leading case for disclosure to the defence. In 2018, the BBC broadcast the documentary &quot;A Great British Injustice: The Maguire Story&quot;, with the involvement of the Maguire family&#x27;s surviving members.

=== Key prosecution figures ===
Many of the key figures in the British legal and criminal justice establishment who were responsible for the wrongful prosecution of the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven, while later facing public criticism, were never formally held accountable for their role in the scandal. In 2013, in what is believed to be the final media interview he gave before his premature death in 2014, Gerry Conlon told Italian documentary maker and photographer Lorenzo Moscia that every key British figure involved in his wrongful conviction had subsequently been promoted and reached the top of their respective profession. He contrasted this with the struggles and hardships he and the other wrongfully convicted people faced in the years after their release from prison.

==== Lord Justice Donaldson (trial judge) ====
Two months after Margaret Thatcher became British Prime Minister in 1979, the trial judge in the Guildford Four case, Lord Justice (John) Donaldson, was made a Lord Justice of Appeal and a Privy Counsellor. In 1982 he was appointed Master of the Rolls, the second-most-senior judicial office in England and Wales as head of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales and Head of Civil Justice. In 1988 he was elevated to the House of Lords with a life peerage as Baron Donaldson of Lymington.

==== Sir Peter Imbert (Police investigator) ====
Peter Imbert, the then deputy head of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch in 1974, was the police officer who oversaw the arrest and interrogation of the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven. Lord Chief Justice Lane later called this investigation &quot;a sequence of false confessions and police deceits.&quot; In late 1975 Imbert led the police operation that saw the arrest of the IRA&#x27;s Balcombe Street ASU, members of which later confessed to being the real bombers in Guildford and Woolwich, a fact Imbert knew.

In 1976 Imbert was appointed Assistant Chief Constable, and later Deputy Chief Constable of Surrey Constabulary (the police force that investigated the Guildford pub bombings). In 1979, he became Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police, the youngest Chief Constable in the country at that time. He returned to the Metropolitan Police as Assistant Commissioner in 1985, and in 1987 he was appointed Commissioner of the Met (the seniormost police force position in the UK) by then Conservative Home Secretary Douglas Hurd. Imbert retired from the police in 1992 and in was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Greater London from 1998 until 2008. He was appointed to the House of Lords as a life peer as Baron Imbert, of New Romney in the County of Kent in 1999, sitting as a crossbencher.

==== Sir Norman Skelhorn (Director of Public Prosecutions) ====
Sir Norman Skelhorn was the Director of Public Prosecutions in England and Wales in 1974 oversaw the Crown&#x27;s prosecution of Guildford Four and Maguire Seven, as well as the prosecution of the Birmingham Six. Skelhorn had a chequered history in relation to prosecution of terrorist offences related to the Troubles. He became entangled in the row that erupted around the use of torture in Northern Ireland. Edward Heath, Prime Minister since 1970, had banned sensory deprivation in light of the report by Sir Edmund Compton into internment and interrogation techniques used by the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary. In October 1973, while being questioned at a meeting of the Harvard Law School Forum, Skelhorn did not deny that torture had taken place. On the contrary, he stated that &quot;when dealing with &quot;Irish terrorists&quot; any methods were justified.&quot;

Skelhorn retired as DPP before the publication of the critical report by Lord Devlin published in 1977 recommended statutory prosecution safeguards, on which the then Callaghan Government took no action.

==== Lord (Michael) Havers (Prosecuting counsel) ====
British barrister and Conservative politician Sir Michael Havers MP, was selected by DPP Norman Skelhorn to lead both the prosecution of the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven in 1974, and the Crown&#x27;s case in opposing the subsequent appeals of both groups in the Court of Appeal.

Havers was from a distinguished legal family. His father was High Court judge Sir Cecil Havers, and his sister was Baroness Butler-Sloss who in 1988 became the first woman named to the Court of Appeal and later President of the Family Division. Sir Michael was the father of the well-known English actor Nigel Havers. 

Havers was elected to the House of Commons in 1970 as Conservative MP for Wimbledon (a seat he held until 1987). He served as Solicitor General for England and Wales under Prime Minister Edward Heath from 1972 to 1974. By October 1974, with the Conservatives in opposition, Havers acted for the DPP in both prosecutions. In the case of the Guildford Four, the DPP was found to have suppressed alibi evidence that supported Gerry Conlon&#x27;s and Paul Hill&#x27;s claims of innocence. The DPP, for which Havers was acting, was also found to have suppressed confessions by Provisional IRA bombers in the Balcombe Street Gang, claiming responsibility for the Guildford and Woolwich bombings. While it was never directly shown that Havers knew of the evidence the DPP suppressed, many, including Labour MP Chris Mullin, cast doubt on his integrity in the matter in his submission to the May Inquiry into the wrongful convictions.

In 1977, Havers became a member of the Privy Council. In 1979, Thatcher reappointed him as Attorney-General for England and Wales and as Attorney General for Northern Ireland. He held both posts until 1987. During the Falklands War in 1982, Havers was included in Thatcher&#x27;s War Cabinet, to which he provided advice on international law and rules of engagement.

After Havers retired from the House of Commons in the 1987 UK general election, Thatcher appointed him Lord Chancellor, and he consequently became a life peer as Baron Havers, of St Edmundsbury in the County of Suffolk. At the time, this made him a senior Minister of the Crown, the most senior judicial officer holder in the UK, as well as presiding officer of the House of Lords.
