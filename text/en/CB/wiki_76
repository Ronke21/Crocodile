<text>Slow Train Coming is the nineteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on August 20, 1979, by Columbia Records. It was Dylan&#x27;s first album following his conversion to Christianity, and the songs either express personal faith, or stress the importance of Christian teachings and philosophy. The evangelical nature of the record alienated many of Dylan&#x27;s existing fans; at the same time, many Christians were drawn into his fan base. &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot; was listed at in the 2001 book &quot;CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music&quot;.

The album was generally well-reviewed by music critics, and the single &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody&quot; became his first hit in three years, winning Dylan the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 1980. The album peaked at on the charts in the UK and went platinum in the US, where it reached .

A high-definition 5.1 surround sound edition of the album was released on SACD by Columbia in 2003.

==Background==
By November 1978, Dylan had received some of the worst reviews of his career. In late January, he finally premiered &quot;Renaldo and Clara&quot;, the part-fiction, part-concert film shot in the fall of 1975, during the first Rolling Thunder Revue tour. Though the performances were well-received, the overwhelming majority of film reviews were negative, particularly those by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, which printed four negative reviews by four different critics. Though critical reception in the United Kingdom was kinder, with some British critics proclaiming it a major work, his most recent album, &quot;Street-Legal&quot;, was also received poorly by most American critics. Charges of sexism, poor production, and poor writing were thrown at the album.

In the meantime, Dylan&#x27;s latest tour was getting its own share of negative reviews, many of which reflected the negative criticism which greeted the American release of &quot;Bob Dylan at Budokan&quot;, taken from performances in February and March 1978.

Yet Dylan was in good spirits, according to his own account: &quot;I was doing fine. I had come a long way in just the year we were on the road [in 1978].&quot; This would change on November 17 in San Diego, California. As Clinton Heylin reports, &quot;the show itself was proving to be very physically demanding, but then, he perhaps reasoned, he&#x27;d played a gig in Montreal a month earlier with a temperature of 105.&quot;

&quot;Towards the end of the show someone out in the crowd ... knew I wasn&#x27;t feeling too well,&quot; recalled Dylan in a 1979 interview. &quot;I think they could see that. And they threw a silver cross on the stage. Now usually I don&#x27;t pick things up in front of the stage. Once in a while I do. Sometimes I don&#x27;t. But I looked down at that cross. I said, &#x27;I gotta pick that up.&#x27; So I picked up the cross and I put it in my pocket ... And I brought it backstage and I brought it with me to the next town, which was out in Arizona ... I was feeling even worse than I&#x27;d felt when I was in San Diego. I said, &#x27;Well, I need something tonight.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t know what it was. I was used to all kinds of things. I said, &#x27;I need something tonight that I didn&#x27;t have before.&#x27; And I looked in my pocket and I had this cross.&quot;

Dylan believed he had experienced a vision of Christ in his Tucson hotel room. &quot;Jesus did appear to me as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,&quot; he would later say. &quot;There was a presence in the room that couldn&#x27;t have been anybody but Jesus ... Jesus put his hand on me. It was a physical thing. I felt it. I felt it all over me. I felt my whole body tremble. The glory of the Lord knocked me down and picked me up.&quot;

Heylin writes that &quot;his state of mind may well have made him susceptible to such an experience. Lacking a sense of purpose in his personal life since the collapse of his marriage, he came to believe that, when Jesus revealed Himself, He quite literally rescued him from an early grave.&quot;

&quot;[Dylan&#x27;s] conversion wasn&#x27;t one of those things that happens when an alcoholic goes to Alcoholics Anonymous,&quot; David Mansfield, one of Dylan&#x27;s band members and fellow-born-again Christian, would later say. &quot;The simplest explanation is that he had a very profound experience which answered certain lifelong issues for him.&quot;

Hints of Dylan&#x27;s newfound faith began to appear publicly. In the final four weeks of the tour, Dylan could be seen wearing the same silver cross that catalyzed his conversion. During performances of &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot;, lyrics were replaced with explicit references to the Bible. As Heylin writes, &quot;Rather than having the mysterious lady in the topless bar quoting an Italian poet from the 13th century [sic], she was quoting from the Bible, initially from the Gospel According to Matthew. Gradually, though, the lines changed, until he settled upon a verse from Jeremiah—the one he would quote on the inner sleeve of the &quot;Saved&quot; album: &#x27;Behold, the days come, sayeth the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah&#x27; (Jeremiah 31).&quot;

Dylan also began writing songs that would reflect his new spirituality. During soundchecks on the final two weeks of the tour, he worked on a new song called &quot;Slow Train&quot;. At the final show in Hollywood, Florida, he would introduce a new song to his audience: &quot;Do Right to Me Baby (Do Unto Others)&quot;. According to Heylin, it &quot;was the first song he had ever written around a dictum from the Bible, indeed a saying directly attributed to Jesus himself: &#x27;All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them; this, in fact, is what the Law and the Prophets mean&#x27; (Matthew 7:12).&quot;

Dylan was not alone in his religious awakening. Band members Steven Soles and David Mansfield had already joined the Vineyard Fellowship, a Christian organization introduced to them by T-Bone Burnett. Helena Springs, one of the singers in the band, was brought up Christian and still practiced her faith. Dylan was also romantically linked with Mary Alice Artes; raised as a Christian, she had strayed from her faith only to return to it after joining the Vineyard Fellowship (without the influence of Burnett, Soles or Mansfield).

At one meeting with the Vineyard Fellowship, Artes approached pastor Kenn Gulliksen, seeking pastoral guidance for Dylan. Pastors Larry Myers and Paul Emond were sent to Dylan&#x27;s home where they ministered to him. As Heylin writes, &quot;by embracing the brand of Christianity advocated by the Vineyard Fellowship, Dylan was about to become, in popular perception, just another Bible-[thumping] fundamentalist. In fact, though the Fellowship certainly shared the &#x27;born again&#x27; precepts of more right-wing credos—believing such a change was an awakening from original sin (&#x27;Adam given the Devil reign/Because he sinned I got no choice&#x27;)—it represented a more joyous baptism of faith.&quot; As Mansfield would say, &quot;a big part of the fellowship of that church was music.&quot;

Under the guidance of the Vineyard Fellowship, Dylan was asked to attend a course held at the Vineyard School of Discipleship, which would run four days a week over the course of three months. &quot;At first I said, &#x27;There&#x27;s no way I can devote three months to this, Dylan would say in a 1980 interview. I&#x27;ve got to be back on the road soon.&#x27; But I was sleeping one day and I just sat up in bed at seven in the morning and I was compelled to get dressed and drive over to the Bible school.&quot;

Pastor Gulliksen would later say, &quot;It was an intensive course studying about the life of Jesus; &quot;principles of discipleship&quot;; the Sermon on the Mount; what it is to be a believer; how to grow; &quot;how to share&quot; ... but at the same time a good solid Bible-study overview type of ministry.&quot;

As Heylin writes, &quot;A well-read man, for whom the Bible had previously been little more than a literary source, [Dylan] now made its allegories come out in black and white.&quot; In an interview taken in 1985, Dylan would say, &quot;What I learned in Bible school was just ... an extension of the same thing I believed in all along, but just couldn&#x27;t verbalize or articulate ... People who believe in the coming of the Messiah live their lives right now, as if He was here. That&#x27;s my idea of it, anyway. I know people are going to say to themselves, &#x27;What the fuck is this guy talking about?&#x27; but it&#x27;s all there in black and white, the written and unwritten word. I don&#x27;t have to defend this. The scriptures back me up.&quot;

Through his Bible classes, Dylan became acquainted with &quot;the works of Hal Lindsey, the man to whom God in his infinite wisdom had revealed the true code of Revelation,&quot; writes Heylin. &quot;Though no saint himself, Lindsey was closely associated with the Vineyard Church. His book, &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; (1970), became Dylan&#x27;s second Bible and added an apocalyptic edge to his worldview&quot;.

According to Lindsey, current world events had been foretold in the apocalyptic tracts of the Bible,&quot; Heylin continued. &quot;His basic premise, in &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;, was that the events revealed to St. John in Revelation corresponded with 20th century history, starting with the re-establishment of the Jews&#x27; homeland, Israel. By identifying Russia as Magog and Iran as Gog—the confederation responsible for instigating the final conflict, the Battle of Armageddon—Lindsey prophesied an imminent End.&quot;

In later shows, Dylan would reflect these beliefs on stage. At one show in the fall of 1979, Dylan said, &quot;You know we&#x27;re living in the end times ... The scriptures say, &#x27;In the last days, perilous times shall be at hand. Men shall become lovers of their own selves. Blasphemous, heavy and highminded.&#x27; ... Take a look at the Middle East. We&#x27;re heading for a war ... I told you &#x27;The Times They Are A-Changin&#x27; &#x27; and they did. I said the answer was &#x27;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&#x27; and it was. I&#x27;m telling you now Jesus is coming back, and He is! And there is no other way of salvation ... Jesus is coming back to set up His kingdom in Jerusalem for a thousand years.&quot;

As Heylin writes, &quot;[Dylan&#x27;s] belief in the imminence of the End was reflected in almost all of the songs he now found himself writing.&quot; Dylan would later say in an interview taken in 1984, &quot;The songs that I wrote for the &quot;Slow Train&quot; album [frightened me] ... I didn&#x27;t plan to write them ... I didn&#x27;t like writing them. I didn&#x27;t want to write them.&quot;

&quot;Precious Angel&quot;, &quot;Gonna Change My Way of Thinking&quot;, &quot;When You Gonna Wake Up?&quot; and &quot;When He Returns&quot; all &quot;drew heavily and directly upon the Book of Revelation,&quot; notes Heylin. &quot;In the early months of 1979, Dylan was writing his most message-driven album in sixteen years. This time, though, the pursuit of the millennium had overtaken more sociopolitical concerns.&quot;

==Recording sessions==
Dylan first heard Mark Knopfler when assistant and engineer Arthur Rosato played him the Dire Straits single &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;. Later, on March 29, 1979, Dylan caught the final show of a Dire Straits&#x27; residency at the Roxy in Los Angeles, California. Dylan approached Knopfler after the show, asking the guitarist to participate on his next album. Knopfler agreed, unaware of the religious nature of the material that awaited him.

Dylan also approached Jerry Wexler to produce the upcoming sessions. &quot;What he wanted&quot;, Wexler told interviewer Ted Fox, &quot;was more of a tailored, big funk sound, which he didn&#x27;t have on his records. He wanted a little more precision, a little more musical input. It was something he felt was time.&quot; According to Wexler, it was his, not Dylan&#x27;s, initiative to bring in Knopfler: that was &quot;the innovative part of it...Instead of going with the regular Muscle Shoals section, I changed it a little bit.&quot; Studio recording had become much more complex during the 1970s, and after his struggles recording the large ensemble performances of &quot;Street-Legal&quot;, Dylan was resolute in hiring an experienced producer he could trust. He was familiar with Wexler&#x27;s celebrated work with Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Percy Sledge, Dusty Springfield, and other soul artists. &quot;Synonymous with a small studio in Sheffield, Alabama, the sixties Atlantic recordings of Wexler defined the Muscle Shoals Sound,&quot; writes Clinton Heylin. Like Knopfler, when Wexler agreed to produce, he was unaware of the nature of the material that awaited him.

&quot;Naturally, I wanted to do the album in Muscle Shoals—as Bob did—but we decided to prep it in L.A., where Bob lived,&quot; recalls Wexler. &quot;That&#x27;s when I learned what the songs were about: born-again Christians in the old corral ... I liked the irony of Bob coming to me, the Wandering Jew, to get the Jesus feel ... [But] I had no idea he was on this born-again Christian trip until he started to evangelize me. I said, &#x27;Bob, you&#x27;re dealing with a sixty-two-year-old confirmed Jewish atheist. I&#x27;m hopeless. Let&#x27;s just make an album.&#x27;&quot;

Knopfler voiced his concerns to his manager, Ed Bicknell, remarking that &quot;all these songs are about God,&quot; but he was also impressed with Dylan&#x27;s professionalism. &quot;Bob and I ran down a lot of those songs beforehand,&quot; recalls Knopfler. &quot;And they might be in a very different form when he&#x27;s just hittin&#x27; the piano, and maybe I&#x27;d make suggestions about the tempo or whatever. Or I&#x27;d say, &#x27;What about a twelve-string?&#x27;&quot;

When sessions were held in Alabama, Dylan retained only two members from his 1978 touring band: Helena Springs and Carolyn Dennis, both background singers. Veteran bassist Tim Drummond was hired, as was Dire Straits&#x27; drummer Pick Withers on Knopfler&#x27;s recommendation. Keyboardist Barry Beckett and the Muscle Shoals Horns, both key elements of the celebrated Muscle Shoals Sound, were also brought in.”

The first session was held on April 30; it proved to be very difficult. Much of the day was dedicated to recording &quot;Trouble in Mind,&quot; a song that was ultimately left off &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot;. Wexler criticized Dylan for unnecessarily vocalizing while Dylan refused to wear headphones, adamant that they pursue a more &#x27;live&#x27; sound even though overdubs on the 24-track recordings were virtually expected.

&quot;Bob began playing and singing along with the musicians,&quot; recalls Wexler. &quot;We were in the first stages of building rhythm arrangements; it was too soon for him to sing, but he sang on every take anyway. I finally persuaded him to hold off on the vocals until later, when the arrangements were in shape and the players could place their licks around—not against—Bob.&quot;

As the sessions wore on, Wexler&#x27;s techniques seemed more accommodating. Once arrangements were set, Dylan could focus on recording a strong vocal track while subsequent overdubs would fill in the gaps. As Heylin describes it, the basic tracks with &quot;lead vocals intact [were] laid down before Dylan&#x27;s boredom threshold was reached. Adding and redoing bass parts, acoustic and electric guitars, background vocals, horns, organ, electric piano, and percussion would require their own set of sessions, but by then Dylan could be an interested observer.&quot; For &quot;Precious Angel&quot;, bass, guitar, organ, and horns would all be overdubbed a week after recording the master take. &quot;No Man Righteous (Not No One)&quot; (ultimately left off &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot;) was constructed in similar fashion.

As Heylin notes, Dylan also broke from his &quot;usual practice of recording songs without running them down for the musicians.&quot; &quot;Bob might run it down on piano or guitar, just singing and playing the background until we had a rough shape in our minds; then the Muscle Shoals band would start to play it,&quot; recalls Wexler. &quot;As soon as it sounded right, Bob and the girls would start to sing.&quot; Unlike his previous album sessions, &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot; sessions would run smoothly and efficiently after a slow start. The basic tracks for the remaining ten songs were recorded in just six three-hour sessions over a period of three days. The first takes of &quot;I Believe in You&quot; and &quot;Gonna Change My Way of Thinking&quot; would become the basic tracks for the masters.

The final song recorded was &quot;When He Returns&quot;. Its role as the album&#x27;s closer was already decided, but Dylan planned on having Springs or Dennis sing the lead vocal. After recording a guide vocal, backed by Beckett on piano, he reconsidered. As Heylin suggested, Beckett&#x27;s &quot;strident accompaniment made him think again.&quot; Dylan practiced singing &quot;When He Returns&quot; overnight before laying down eight vocal takes over Beckett&#x27;s original piano track. The final take, described by Heylin as &quot;perhaps Dylan&#x27;s strongest studio vocal since &#x27;Visions of Johanna&#x27;,&quot; was selected as the master.

Wexler convinced Dylan to overdub new vocals for &quot;Gonna Change My Way of Thinking&quot; and &quot;When You Gonna Wake Up?&quot;, but otherwise the overdubbing sessions held the following week focused on instrumental overdubbing.

==Outtakes==
Dylan recorded three additional songs during these sessions, but these did not make the final cut for &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot;. &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot; was issued as a B-side in 1979 and on compilation &quot;Pure Dylan&quot; in 2011. &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Man Righteous&quot; was covered by reggae group Jah Mallah, but no Dylan version was released until 2017. &quot;Ye Shall Be Changed&quot; was issued on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol 1–3&quot;. All three outtakes were also released on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979–1981&quot; in 2017.

* &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Man Righteous, No Not One&quot;

==Reception and aftermath==
As the album approached completion, Dylan was required to provide testimony in a defamation-of-character suit brought against him by Patty Valentine, an eyewitness to the murders described in Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Hurricane&quot; from &quot;Desire&quot;. In a May 22 pre-trial deposition, Dylan was asked about his wealth. &quot;You mean my treasure on earth?&quot; replied Dylan. He was asked about the identity of the &#x27;fool&#x27; in &quot;Hurricane&quot;. Dylan said the &#x27;fool&#x27; was &quot;whoever Satan gave power to ... whoever was blind to the truth and was living by his own truth.&quot; Five days later, Dylan&#x27;s pre-trial statement was reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, which also interviewed Kenn Gulliksen, who revealed to the paper that Dylan had joined the Vineyard Christian Fellowship.

By June, with the album virtually finished, Dylan gave London&#x27;s Capital Radio station an acetate disc of &quot;Precious Angel&quot;, which premiered on Roger Scott&#x27;s afternoon radio show. By July, the album was ready for issue, and pre-release copies of &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot; circulated through the press. &quot;New Musical Express&quot; would proclaim &quot;Dylan &amp; God – It&#x27;s Official&quot;.

In a year when Van Morrison and Patti Smith released their own spiritual works in &quot;Into the Music&quot; and &quot;Wave&quot;, respectively, Dylan&#x27;s album seemed vitriolic and bitter in comparison. Critic Charles Shaar Murray wrote, &quot;Bob Dylan has never seemed more perfect and more impressive than on this album. He has also never seemed more unpleasant and hate-filled.&quot; Greil Marcus wrote, &quot;Dylan&#x27;s received truths never threaten the unbeliever, they only chill the soul&quot; and accused Dylan of &quot;sell[ing] a prepackaged doctrine he&#x27;s received from someone else.&quot; According to Clinton Heylin, &quot;Marcus isolated &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot;&#x27;s greatest flaw, an inevitable by-product of his determination to capture the immediacy of newfound faith in song.&quot;

Robert Christgau gave a mostly positive review, grading it a B+. &quot;The lyrics are indifferently crafted,&quot; wrote Christgau. &quot;Nevertheless, this is his best album since &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;. The singing is passionate and detailed.&quot;

Reviewing the album in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jann Wenner proclaimed it &quot;one of the finest records Dylan has ever made&quot;. However, in an interview in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Ann Druyan stated &quot;The thing that I always loved about Dylan was the courage of his metaphors and the way he could cut to the bone of some kind of naked feeling. It always seemed very gutsy. And now it seems that he&#x27;s turned away, he&#x27;s blinded by the light, and so he looks for some easy explanation.&quot;

On October 20, 1979, Dylan promoted the album with his first—and, to date, only—appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, performing &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody&quot;, &quot;I Believe in You&quot;, and &quot;When You Gonna Wake Up&quot;. On November 1, Dylan began a lengthy residency at the Fox Warfield Theater in San Francisco, California, playing a total of fourteen dates supported by a large ensemble. It was the beginning of six months of touring North America, performing his new music to believers and his hecklers alike.

Despite the mixed reactions to Dylan&#x27;s new direction, &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody&quot; was a US Top 30 hit, and the album outsold both &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; in its first year of release despite missing the top of the charts. It even managed to place at No. 38 on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1979, proving he had some critical support if not universal acclaim.

During this period, Dylan refused to play any of his older compositions, as well as any secular material. Though Pastor Larry Myers had assured Dylan that his old compositions were not sacrilegious, Dylan would say he would not &quot;sing any song which hasn&#x27;t been given to me by the Lord to sing&quot;. Fans wishing to hear his older songs openly expressed their disappointment. Hecklers continued to appear at his concerts, only to be answered by lectures from the stage. Dylan was firmly entrenched in his evangelical ways, and it would continue through his next album, whether his audience would follow or not.

When asked &quot;What, if push comes to shove, is your all-time favourite album?&quot; Nick Cave replied: &quot;I guess it&#x27;s &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot; by Bob Dylan. That&#x27;s a great record, full of mean-spirited spirituality. It&#x27;s a genuinely nasty record, certainly the nastiest &#x27;Christian&#x27; album I&#x27;ve ever come across.&quot;

<text>James Dickie Robinson (October 21, 1840 – April 18, 1912) was a Canadian political figure who, in 1873, served from February 9 to April 15 as Mayor of Victoria, British Columbia. He was born in Ireland in 1840.

Robinson is referred to as the &quot;mysterious missing mayor&quot; because of the scarcity of archival information regarding his term, which is recorded as being the shortest in Victoria&#x27;s history. He also served as the Town Clerk for Victoria from 1884 to 1888. He died in 1912 in Victoria.

<text>Vima Takto or Vima Taktu (Greco-Bactrian: Οοημο Τακτοο, &quot;Oēmo Taktoo&quot;; Kharosthi: 𐨬𐨅𐨨 𐨟𐨑𐨆 &#x27;,&#x27;) was a Kushan emperor who reigned –90 CE.

==Rule==
Vima Takto was long known as &quot;The nameless King&quot;, since his coins only showed the legend &quot;The King of Kings, Great Saviour&quot;, until the discovery of the Rabatak inscription helped connect his name with the title on the coins.

Vima Takto&#x27;s empire covered northwestern India and Bactria towards China, where Kushan presence has been asserted in the Tarim Basin. During his reign, Kushan embassies were also sent to the Eastern Han imperial court.

===Genealogy===
He is mentioned in the Chinese historical chronicle &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;, in relation to his father Kujula Kadphises:

&quot;Qiujiuque (Ch: 丘就卻) [Kujula Kadphises] was more than eighty years old when he died. His son, Yangaozhen (Ch:閻高珍) [probably Vema Tahk(tu) or, possibly, his brother Sadaṣkaṇa], became king in his place. He defeated Tianzhu [North-western India] and installed Generals to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang [Kushan] king, but the Han call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi.&quot;

The connection of Vima Takto with other Kushan rulers is described in the Rabatak inscription, which was written by Kanishka. Kanishka makes the list of the kings who ruled up to his time: Kujula Kadphises as his great-grandfather, Vima Takto as his grandfather, Vima Kadphises as his father, and himself Kanishka:

&quot;... for King Kujula Kadphises (his) great grandfather, and for King Vima Taktu (his) grandfather, and for King Vima Kadphises (his) father, and *also for himself, King Kanishka&quot; (Cribb and Sims-Williams 1995/6: 80)

A later inscription found at Vima&#x27;s sanctuary at Mat, also records that he was the grandfather of Huvishka.

<doc id="836100" wikidata="Q2872469" url="?curid=836100" title="Self-handicapping">
<text>Self-handicapping is a cognitive strategy by which people avoid effort in the hopes of keeping potential failure from hurting self-esteem. It was first theorized by Edward E. Jones and Steven Berglas, according to whom self-handicaps are obstacles created, or claimed, by the individual in anticipation of failing performance.

Self-handicapping can be seen as a method of preserving self-esteem but it can also be used for self-enhancement and to manage the impressions of others. This conservation or augmentation of self-esteem is due to changes in causal attributions or the attributions for success and failure that self-handicapping affords. There are two methods that people use to self-handicap: behavioral and claimed self-handicaps. People withdraw effort or create obstacles to successes so they can maintain public and private self-images of competence.

Self-handicapping is a widespread behavior amongst humans that has been observed in a variety of cultures and geographic areas. For instance, students frequently participate in self-handicapping behavior to avoid feeling bad about themselves if they do not perform well in class. Self-handicapping behavior has also been observed in the business world. The effects of self-handicapping can be both large and small and found in virtually any environment wherein people are expected to perform.

==Overview and relevance==
The first method people use to self-handicap is when they make a task harder for themselves in fear of not successfully completing that task, so that if they do in fact fail, they can simply place the blame on the obstacles rather than placing the blame on themselves. This is known to researchers as &quot;behavioral&quot; handicapping, in which the individual actually creates obstacles to performance. Examples of behavioral handicaps include alcohol consumption, the selection of unattainable goals, and refusal to practice a task or technique (especially in sports and the fine arts). Some of these behaviors include procrastination, self-fulfilling prophecies of negative expectations, learned helplessness, self-handicapping, success avoidance, failures in self-regulation, addictions and risky behaviors.

The second way that people self-handicap is by coming up with justifications for their potential failures, so that if they do not succeed in the task, they can point to their excuses as the reasons for their failures. This is known as &quot;claimed&quot; self-handicapping, in which the individual merely states that an obstacle to performance exists. Examples of claimed self-handicaps include declarations that one is experiencing physical symptoms. When people engage in these behaviors they are doing so in order to protect their own self-esteem or to reduce or inhibit unpleasant emotions. These patterns of behaviors fall under different categories of Personality Disorders, some of which include dependent, borderline personality disorder, and obsessive personality disorders.

Self-handicapping behavior allows individuals to externalize failures but internalize success, accepting credit for achievements but allowing excuses for failings. Individuals that showed signs of unstable self-esteem were more likely to exhibit self-handicapping behaviors in an attempt to externalize failure and internalize success by action or performance setting choice. An example of self-handicapping is the student who spends the night before an important exam partying rather than studying. The student fears failing his exam and appearing incapable. In partying the night before the exam the student has engaged in self-defeating behavior and increased the likelihood of poor exam performance. However, in the event of failure, the student can offer fatigue and a hangover, rather than lack of ability, as plausible explanations. Furthermore, should the student receive positive feedback about his exam, his achievement is enhanced by the fact that he succeeded, despite the handicap. When faced with the possibility of failure, students exhibit some behaviors resulting in a reduction in overall effort, not allotting the proper amount of time to work or produce work, or postponing/procrastinating their work.The end goal is to find a way to blame academic failures on anything but their abilities themselves (Torok et. al 2018). These findings from this study combat Festinger’s social comparison theory (Festinger 1954.) This social comparison theory states that it is a fundamental human motive to obtain information based on their environment and gain feedback about their capabilities as such instead of setting themselves up for failure and refusing to take the blame.

A theory more closely related to the findings of the self-handicapping phenomenon with a similar background and basis is that of Covington&#x27;s Self Worth Theory. According to Covington&#x27;s theory, schools today have what is called a “zero sum scoring system”. This meaning that the recompense available in a classroom is limited and that one student wins, this means that other students are always meant to lose (Covington 1992). Individuals self worth is based on their perceived performance and abilities. Covington and Omelich describe effort as a &quot;double-edged sword&quot;. This meaning that students feel a sense of urgency to make efforts in order to avoid being punished by their instructor causing them to experience feelings of negativity and guilt. All the while, students also face the chance of making an effort that involves the possible chance of feelings such as humiliation or shame if or when their effort results in failure. If their effort is proven to be unsuccessful, they believe that they will be seen as an unsuccessful person. According to Covington this means that students have only two choices. The first one being that they refuse to make an effort and take on the negativity of failure or perceived punishment. The second being that they in fact make an effort which gives creates this sense of vulnerability and opens the door to being judged as being unintelligent or lacking the proper abilities. This is why we see so many students using this self-handicapping mechanism as a last resort effort to protect themselves and their perceived positive self-image.

=== Individual differences ===
People differ in the extent to which they self-handicap and most research on individual differences has used the Self-Handicapping Scale (SHS). The SHS was developed as a means of measuring individuals&#x27; tendency to employ excuses or create handicaps as a means to protect one&#x27;s self-esteem. Research to date shows that SHS has adequate construct validity. For example, individuals who score high on the SHS put in less effort and practice less when concerned about their ability to perform well in a given task. They are also more likely than those rated low self-handicappers (LSH) to mention obstacles or external factors that may hinder their success, prior to performing.

A number of characteristics have been related to self-handicapping (e.g. hypochondriasis) and research suggests that those more prone to self-handicapping may differ motivationally compared to those that do not rely on such defensive strategies. For example, fear of failure, a heightened sensitivity to shame and embarrassment upon failure, motivates self-handicapping behavior. Students who fear failure are more likely to adopt performance goals in the classroom or goals focused on the demonstration of competence or avoidance of demonstrating incompetence; goals that heighten one&#x27;s sensitivity to failure.

A student, for example, may approach course exams with the goal of not performing poorly as this would suggest a lack of ability. To avoid ability attributions and the shame of failure, the student fails to adequately prepare for an exam. While this may provide temporary relief, it renders one&#x27;s ability conceptions more uncertain, resulting in further self-handicapping.

===Gender differences===
While research suggests that claimed self-handicaps are used by men and women alike, several studies have reported significant differences. While research assessing differences in reported self-handicapping have revealed no gender differences or greater self-handicapping among females,
the vast majority of research suggests that males are more inclined to behaviourally self-handicap. These differences are further explained by the different value men and women ascribe to the concept of effort.

==Major theoretical approaches==
The root of research on the act of self-handicapping can be traced back to Adler&#x27;s studies about self-esteem. In the late 1950s, Goffman and Heider published research concerning the manipulation of outward behavior for the purpose of impression management. It was not until 30 years later that self-handicapping behavior was attributed to internal factors. Until this point, self-handicapping only encompassed the usage of external factors, such as alcohol and drugs. Self-handicapping is usually studied in an experimental setting, but is sometimes studied in an observational environment.

Previous research has established that self-handicapping is motivated by uncertainty about one&#x27;s ability or, more generally, anticipated threats to self-esteem. Self-handicapping can be exacerbated by self-presentational concerns but also occurs in situations where such concerns are at a minimum.

==Major empirical findings==
Experiments on self-handicapping have depicted the reasons why people self-handicap and the effects that it has on those people. Self-handicapping has been observed in both laboratory and real world settings. Studying the psychological and physical effects of self-handicapping has allowed researchers to witness the dramatic effects that it has on attitude and performance.

Jones and Berglas gave people positive feedback following a problem-solving test, regardless of actual performance. Half the participants had been given fairly easy problems, while the others were given difficult problems. Participants were then given the choice between a &quot;performance-enhancing drug&quot; and a drug that would inhibit it. Those participants who received the difficult problems were more likely to choose the impairing drug, and participants who faced easy problems were more likely to choose the enhancing drug. It is argued that the participants presented with hard problems, believing that their success had been due to chance, chose the impairing drug because they were looking for an external attribution (what might be called an &quot;excuse&quot;) for expected poor performance in the future, as opposed to an internal attribution.

More recent research finds that, generally, people are willing to use handicaps to protect their self-esteem (e.g., discounting failings) but are more reluctant to employ them for self-enhancement. (e.g., to further credit their success).
Rhodewalt, Morf, Hazlett, and Fairfield (1991) selected participants who scored high or low on the Self-Handicapping Scale (SHS) and who had high or low self-esteem. They presented participants with a handicap and then with success or failure feedback and asked participants to make attributions for their performance. The results showed that both self-protection and self-enhancement occurred, but only as a function of levels of self-esteem and the level of tendency to self-handicap. Participants who were high self-handicappers, regardless of their level of self-esteem, used the handicap as a means of self-protection but only those participants with high self-esteem used the handicap to self-enhance.

In a further study, Rhodewalt (1991) presented the handicap to only half of the participants and gave success and failure feedback. The results provided evidence for self-protection but not for self-enhancement. Participants in the failure feedback, handicap absent group, attributed their failures to their own lack of ability and reported lower self-esteem to the handicap-present, failure-feedback condition. Furthermore, the handicap-present failure group reported levels of self-esteem equal to that of the successful group. This evidence highlights the importance of self-handicaps in self-protection although it offers no support for the handicap acting to self-enhance.

Another experiment, by Martin Seligman and colleagues, examined whether there was a correlation between explanatory styles and the performance of swimmers. After being given false bad times on their preliminary events, the swimmers who justified their poor performance to themselves in a pessimistic way did worse on subsequent performances. In contrast, the subsequent performances of those swimmers who had more optimistic attributions concerning their poor swimming times were not affected. Those who had positive attributions were more likely to succeed after given false times because they were self-handicapping. They attributed their failure to an external force rather than blaming themselves. Therefore, their self-esteem remained intact, which led to their success in subsequent events. This experiment demonstrates the positive effects that self-handicapping can have on an individual because when they attributed the failure to an external factor, they did not internalize the failure and let it psychologically affect them.

Previous research has looked at the consequences of self-handicapping and have suggested that self-handicapping leads to a more positive mood (at least in the short term) or at least guards against a drop in positive mood after failure. Thus, self-handicapping may serve as a means of regulating one&#x27;s emotions in the course of protecting one&#x27;s self-esteem. However, based on past evidence that positive mood motivates self-protective attributions for success and failure and increases the avoidance of negative feedback, recent research has focused on mood as an antecedent to self-handicapping; expecting positive mood to increase self-handicapping behaviour. Results have shown that people who are in positive mood are more likely to engage in self-handicapping, even at the cost of jeopardizing future performance.

Research suggests that among those who self-handicap, self-imposed obstacles may relieve the pressure of a performance and allow one to become more engaged in a task. While this may enhance performance in some situations for some individuals, in general, research indicates that self-handicapping is negatively associated with performance, self-regulated learning, persistence and intrinsic motivation. Additional long-term costs of self-handicapping include worse health and well-being, more frequent negative moods and higher use of various substances.

Zuckerman and Tsai assessed self-handicapping, well-being, and coping among college students on two occasions over several months. Self-handicapping assessed on the first occasion predicted coping with problems by denial, blaming others and criticizing oneself as well as depression and somatic complaints. Depression and somatic complaints also predicted subsequent self-handicapping. Thus, the use of self-handicapping may lead to not only uncertainty as to one&#x27;s ability but also ill-being, which in turn may lead to further reliance on self-handicapping.

==Applications==
There are many real world applications for this concept. For example, if people predict they are going to perform poorly on tasks, they create obstacles, such as taking drugs and consuming alcohol, so that they feel that they have diverted the blame from themselves if they actually do fail. In addition, another way that people self-handicap is by creating already-made excuses just in case they fail. For example, if a student feels that he is going to perform badly on a test, then he might make up an excuse for his potential failure, such as telling his friends that he does not feel well the morning of the test.

===Occurrence in sports===
Previous research has suggested that because in Physical Education (PE) students are required to overtly display their physical abilities and incompetence could be readily observed by others, PE is an ideal setting to observe self-handicapping. Because of its prevalence in the sporting world, self-handicapping behaviour has become of interest to sports psychologists who are interested in increasing sports performance. A study published in the year 2017 showed that self-esteem had a negative effect on self-handicapping. They found that when it came to mastery goals there was a positive effect resulting from self-esteem. It also suggested that there was a negative effect on performance-avoidance goals when it came to self-esteem. The findings from this study stipulate that by improving an individual&#x27;s self-esteem and working towards mastery goals while also lowering the number of performance-avoidance goals present should prove to be pertinent strategies involved in reducing self-handicapping in physical education. Recent research has examined the relationship between behavioural and claimed self-handicaps and athletic performance as well as the effects self-handicapping has on anxiety and fear of failure before athletic performance.

==Controversies==
One controversy was revealed in a study done at the University of Wyoming. Previous research indicated a negative correlation between self-handicapping behaviors and boosting one&#x27;s self-esteem; it was also shown that people who focus on the positive attributes of themselves are less likely to self-handicap. This study, however, demonstrates that this claim is only partially accurate because the reduction of self-handicapping is only apparent in an area unrelated to the present self-esteem risk. As a result, the attempt to protect self-esteem becomes a detriment to future success in that area.

<doc id="836172" wikidata="Q5494999" url="?curid=836172" title="Fred Dibnah">
<text>Frederick Travis Dibnah, (28 April 1938 – 6 November 2004), was an English steeplejack and television personality. Having a keen interest in mechanical engineering, he described himself as a &quot;backstreet mechanic.&quot;

When Dibnah was born, Britain relied heavily upon coal to fuel its industry. As a child, he was fascinated by the steam engines which powered the many textile mills in Bolton, but he paid particular attention to chimneys and the men who worked on them. He began his working life as a joiner, before becoming a steeplejack. From age 22, he served for two years in the Army Catering Corps of the British Army, undertaking his National Service. Once demobbed, he returned to steeplejacking but met with limited success until he was asked to repair Bolton&#x27;s parish church tower. The resulting publicity provided a boost to his business, ensuring he was almost never out of work.

In 1978, while making repairs to Bolton Town Hall, Dibnah was filmed by a regional BBC news crew. The BBC then commissioned a documentary, which followed the rough-hewn steeplejack as he worked on chimneys, interacted with his family and talked about his favourite hobby – steam. His Lanky manner and gentle, self-taught philosophical outlook proved popular with viewers and he featured in a number of television programmes. Towards the end of his life, the decline of Britain&#x27;s industry was mirrored by a decline in his steeplejacking business and Dibnah increasingly came to rely on public appearances and after-dinner speaking to support his income. In 1998, he presented a programme on Britain&#x27;s industrial history and went on to present a number of series, largely concerned with the Industrial Revolution and its mechanical and architectural legacy.

Dibnah died from bladder cancer in November 2004, aged 66.

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Fred Dibnah was born on 28 April 1938. He was the son of Frank and Betsy Dibnah (&quot;née&quot; Travis), who were initially both employed at a bleach works. His mother later worked as a charwoman at a gas works. Named after his uncle Frederick, he was born on 28 April 1938 and brought up in the historic Lancashire town of Bolton, then a predominantly industrial town with a history in the spinning and weaving of cotton. As a child, Dibnah was fascinated by the sights and sounds of industry and the dozens of chimney stacks visible around Burnden Park, and paid particular attention to the steeplejacks he saw on his way to school. A popular pastime for local children was playing around the many mill lodges (industrial ponds) which once littered the area. An inventive child, Dibnah and some friends designed a makeshift diving suit from a crisp tin, a car inner tube and some piping. After being told to remove it from the local swimming baths, they tested it in one of the lodges, but were unsuccessful.

The Bolton arm of the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal was one of Dibnah&#x27;s regular haunts. The canal was by then largely disused (the Bolton arm had been mostly closed in 1924) and Dibnah sometimes dredged it with an iron hook on a rope, for what he called &#x27;plunder&#x27;. Much of this was stored in the back yard of his mother&#x27;s house. Dibnah and his friend Alan Heap built a canoe from old bicycle wheels (cut in half to make the ribs), slate laths and a canvas sheet from the back of a lorry. Much to the consternation of his mother, Dibnah sailed the boat along the nearby River Croal. He once astonished his teachers when, following the theft of the school keys, he cut new keys for each classroom door.

===As a young man===

At school Dibnah was placed in an art class (his reading and writing skills were judged to be poor), following which he spent three years at art college, where his work was based mainly on industrial themes such as machinery, pithead gear and spinning mills. On leaving college at 16 he was offered a job at a funeral parlour, but left quickly to begin work at a local joinery workshop.

Dibnah had watched the activities of steeplejacks throughout his childhood, and first witnessed a chimney felling from his father&#x27;s allotment near Bolton&#x27;s greyhound track at Raikes Park. The steeplejacks removed the top of the chimney and then created a hole in its base, propped with blocks of wood. They then lit a fire, destroying the supports and causing the chimney to collapse. Unfortunately, on this occasion the chimney fell in the wrong direction, onto the greyhound track&#x27;s dog kennels, a local café and a series of power cables.

His first job that involved ladders was given to him while he still worked as a joiner. He was asked to point a garden wall and then the gable end of the customer&#x27;s house. He used several short ladders, lashed together with rope and hardboard. This gave Dibnah valuable experience and his employer expanded the business to include property repairs. Aged about 17–18 he climbed the chimney at Barrow Bridge, for a 10 shilling bet. During the night he took two Union flags to the top and secured each to the lightning conductors there. The &quot;Bolton Evening News&quot; reported the incident, with a photograph of Dibnah&#x27;s feat, but attributed it to the activities of students from Manchester University. At about the same time, Dibnah decided to replace the chimney stack at his mother&#x27;s house on Alfred Street with one of his own design, as his mother used only one fireplace—leaving four of the five chimney pots redundant. As the single opening at the top of the new stack was only about wide, the flue needed regular maintenance. On one occasion, he was cleaning the flue using a sack of bricks tied to a rope when the sack ripped open, breaking several pipes and flooding his mother&#x27;s kitchen. After the death of his mother, the house was sold and the council placed a preservation order on the chimney, which remains standing .

===National service===
Aged 22, Dibnah was conscripted into the army to complete his National Service and was given a position in the cook house. He spent six weeks training at Aldershot, before being sent to Catterick to learn the basics of army catering. He was then posted with the 14th/20th King&#x27;s Hussars and sent to West Germany. There he persuaded his commanding officer to let him repair the regiment&#x27;s farmhouse (used for stabling horses and hounds) and he was soon given a more permanent position as a builder and handyman. He dug a deep shaft into which the horse manure and dog faeces would be emptied and he also fed the animals. He impressed his commanding officers by making a weathercock from army kitchen trays, but was also chastised when he was found with a 1914 Luger P08 pistol he had bought from a fellow soldier. He often received parcels of alcohol and tobacco from his mother, which allowed him to maintain the habits he had formed when he began his working life. Although Dibnah initially resented being called into service, he would later be more positive about the experience:

==Steeplejack==

On his return from National Service in 1962 Dibnah retrieved his tools from storage, bought a 1927 350 cc AJS motorcycle for 21 guineas and looked for more work. Bolton, however, was in the midst of post-industrial decline; between 1957 and 1965 about 70 mills were closed in the town, leaving only 37 mills operational and about 50 disused. Initially he was unable to find much work and existed on smaller, domestic jobs, until he earned enough to buy his own set of ladders and secured his first commission while working at a local mill. He was paid £140 to point a mill tower, which he did on weekends. He struggled, however, to get any more meaningful work, until he met Lonsdale Bonner, one of his teachers from art college. The two agreed a deal whereby Bonner would be paid a commission for each job he got for Dibnah. His first job was dismantling a chimney alongside the Manchester and Bolton Railway, a difficult proposition, as a mistake could force the temporary closure of the railway. The two managed to gain commissions for several jobs, but their relationship was terminated when Dibnah was called upon to undertake another six months of National Service.

He was then commissioned to repair a chimney at a local brewery. While working on this, he met a local welder who also knew the vicar of Bolton (Richard Greville Norburn), who wanted some repairs made to Bolton parish church&#x27;s weathervanes. The vicar drove a 1929 Humber limousine and was impressed by Dibnah&#x27;s AJS motorcycle; the two quickly became friends. The church was the tallest building in Bolton and once Dibnah had repaired the weathervane the vicar asked him to gild it. Dibnah appeared in the local newspaper and the publicity and his friendship with the vicar enabled him to gain more work from the local clergy.

His next major job was for local firm Hick Hargreaves, the proceeds of which enabled him to expand his collection of ladders to 30. He was commissioned to remove the top half of a chimney and employed an assistant, Percy Porter. The top of the chimney contained a length of railway line, which had been used for lifting materials during construction. Dibnah hacksawed the line into pieces, letting each piece fall to the ground, while his assistant below kept the area clear. He then spent the next six months removing each brick by hand while the chimney was still in use, as the factory could not afford to halt production.

===First marriage===

In 1967, following disagreements over who should be invited to their wedding, Dibnah and 19-year-old hairdresser Alison Mary Foster eloped to Gretna Green, to get married. Dibnah had first spotted Alison from the top of a chimney and, when one day she walked into the pub where he was drinking, he asked her out; six weeks later, the two became engaged. They left notes for their parents, caught a train to Carlisle and from there on a series of buses to Dumfries. They had initially planned to stay at the house of a friend but as he had returned to Bolton for his holidays, they stayed instead at a local farmhouse. The two had to be resident for at least 21 days to be married and so Dibnah agreed to point the gable ends of a local hotel in exchange for bed and board.

On 19 May, the two married at the church at Gretna Green and returned to live at Dibnah&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house. They later moved into a Victorian gatehouse on the Earl of Bradford&#x27;s estate, just outside Bolton. Dibnah spent years restoring the property, including building an extension. The house was a listed building and so he had to source appropriately aged bricks for the extension. A vicar offered him some of the old gravestones from the church graveyard, which Dibnah then used to create the stone lintels and mullions, though he later expressed his fear that his property would now be haunted. The couple later purchased the house for £5,000, although it required major repairs to stabilize the rear wall.

The couple had their first child, a girl named Jayne, in June 1968. Alison was initially worried about her husband&#x27;s occupation but learned to deal with the risk and to trust Fred. She organised his accounts and even collected debts. She also helped him demolish some of the chimneys that he worked on, by lighting the fire to burn away the temporary supports he had put in place.

===Chimney felling===

Having mastered his trade repairing chimneys, Dibnah became aware of the demand for a cost-effective method of demolishing them. He offered to remove them without using explosives, by cutting an ingress at the base of the chimney—supporting the brickwork with wooden props—and then burning away the props so that the chimney fell, hopefully in the intended direction. Although this was a tried and tested method, it was not without its opponents. On one occasion he was contracted by the local council to fell two chimneys. The contract obliged him to dismantle each by hand, but he decided to fell them by cutting away the base. The first chimney collapsed as planned, but the council terminated his contract and refused to pay. Dibnah contacted the borough engineer and offered to fell the second chimney for no charge, to prove the effectiveness of his technique. He even offered to let the engineer light the fire, but the wind blew so hard that the chimney did not draw the flames and once the props had been burnt through, it remained standing. Dibnah resorted to using a hydraulic jack to apply extra pressure to the intact side of the base and the chimney eventually fell. He later told the engineer that &quot;it was all about fine balancing and counteracting high wind forces.&quot; 

He almost lost his life in 1997, when a concrete chimney he had been asked to fell on Canvey Island began to collapse before the felling team had finished preparing the base. As the team ran from the chimney, Dibnah tripped and fell and was greeted by the sight of 2,500 tonnes of concrete leaning toward him, but fortunately the chimney righted itself and then fell in the opposite direction. The last chimney he felled, which was his 90th, was in Royton, in May 2004.

===Steam===
Dibnah&#x27;s interest in steam power stemmed from his childhood observations of the steam locomotives on the nearby railway line, and his visits to his father&#x27;s workplace—a bleach works in Bolton—where he was fascinated by the steam engines used to drive the line shafting. A small mill near his childhood home was sometimes and Dibnah once broke in:

He later became a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen who worked on the nearby railway. As a teenager he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learned of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend&#x27;s house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother&#x27;s house in Bolton. 

After he had married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.
Restoring the steamroller placed a heavy burden upon his marriage and Alison would often complain that her husband spent more time in the shed, repairing the engine, than he did in the house. He responded by naming the vehicle &quot;Alison&quot;, telling his wife &quot;It&#x27;s not every woman that has a steam engine named after her.&quot; Alison eventually developed an affection for the antique vehicle, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ve done without for so many years to get it built up. I couldn&#x27;t bear to part with it. There&#x27;s too much of us in it.&quot;

His next purchase, made in the autumn of 1980, was a 1912 Aveling &amp; Porter traction engine. Dibnah paid a friend £2,300 for the vehicle and moved it to the garden behind his home. He built a steam-driven workshop in his garden, salvaging parts from various mills, including line shaft gear and a stationary engine from a mill in Oldham. He gave a conservative estimate of four years to complete the work, but the restoration eventually took 27 years. The engine was sold at auction in July 2010 for £240,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 25/07/2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, he was asked by Caernarfon Council to make repairs to a chimney at Parc Glynllifon. Beneath the chimney, an engine room contained an 1854 single-cylinder steam engine in poor condition. Dibnah repaired the chimney and several weeks later was asked to repair the engine, which he dismantled during the winter of 1988/89 and took back to Bolton. With his assistant Neil Carney, he spent six months repairing the engine. The two sourced a replacement boiler from a local pork pie factory and re-installed the engine in Wales. Dibnah later won a prize for the quality of the restoration work. He also spent about seven months restoring the boiler, engine and blunger at Wetheriggs Pottery near Penrith.

==Fame==

===&quot;Fred Dibnah, Steeplejack&quot;===

In 1978, Dibnah was commissioned to make repairs to Bolton Town Hall. Decades of exposure to soot and rain had caused serious damage to the clock tower and Dibnah alerted the Clerk of Works to the condition of the 16 stone pillars at the top of the tower. He bought new stone, built a lathe in his workshop and created the replacement pillars. He was given the job of repairing the clock tower and he also gilded the golden sphere at the top of the building. While Dibnah was working from his bosun&#x27;s chair, a public relations officer at the Town Hall informed Dibnah that &quot;BBC Look North West&quot; wanted to interview him. The following week, the film crew arrived and Alistair MacDonald conducted the interview from the top of the building, with Dibnah perched outside on his scaffolding.

His warm and friendly manner combined with his enthusiasm and broad Lancashire accent proved popular and he was later contacted by producer Don Haworth, with a view to making a documentary. After several meetings over the course of a few weeks, filming began early one morning just as Dibnah had climbed to the top of a chimney at Shaw and Crompton, Oldham. Sporadic filming took place over an 18-month period and captured Dibnah (with assistant Donald Paiton) working on a range of buildings, spending time with his family and enjoying his hobbies. Giulio Briccialdi&#x27;s &quot;Carnival of Venice&quot; (performed by James Galway) was the music chosen to accompany Dibnah&#x27;s work on Bolton Town Hall. One of the more notable aspects was Dibnah&#x27;s 1979 demolition of a chimney in Rochdale. Standing only yards away from the base of the chimney as it began to collapse, his retreat to safety and subsequent boyish outburst of &quot;Did you like that?&quot; endeared him to viewers.

&quot;Fred Dibnah, Steeplejack&quot; won the 1979 BAFTA award for best documentary, and over the years Haworth returned to film more documentaries. With his newly found fame, however, came distractions from his work. Visitors would arrive at his house, to see his garden. He began to receive fan mail; one individual wrote to offer Dibnah a steam-powered machine he no longer wanted. One company, who were apparently disturbed to see Dibnah&#x27;s matches being extinguished by the wind while at the top of a chimney, sent him a sample of their windproof matches. Filming would also interfere with his work. Cameraman Martin Lightening would climb with Dibnah to the top of a chimney—with a 16mm film camera—and film him at work, often hundreds of feet above the ground.

Several years later, Dibnah and his family went on holiday, to Blackpool. The trip was filmed for television and showed Dibnah&#x27;s preference for working rather than holidaying. He did however manage to undertake the removal of a small chimney stack from a business in the town, under a distinctly grey sky and aided by his wife, Alison. His payment for the job was a new front plate for the boiler of his traction engine. Dibnah, however, refused to take any more holidays and, after 18 years of marriage, Alison booked and paid for a holiday to Greece, taking their three children (Jayne, Lorna and Caroline) with her. Dibnah remained at home and was surprised when, upon her return, she asked for a divorce. 

One day in October 1985, Dibnah attended a solid fuel exhibition in nearby Bury. Upon his return he discovered that Alison had left the house, taking with her their three children, the dog and some items of furniture. Short of money, he was forced to sell his antique AJS motorcycle. He found life without his family difficult but defended his wife: &quot;There is no doubt whatsoever, she were a good help to me and I&#x27;m going to miss her. It was just that all the pressure got too much for her.&quot;

===Second marriage===

Dibnah met his second wife Susan Lorenz—a 28-year-old social worker—at a steam rally in Cheshire. In &quot;The Fred Dibnah Story&quot; (1996) she recalled their first meeting: &quot;He looked sad and miserable, quite a pathetic sort of figure really, none of the bounce that people knew him for.&quot; He later invited her to a chimney felling in Oldham and then a talk he had been invited to give to a group of fans in Halifax, known as The Fred Dibnah Appreciation Society. Sue moved into Dibnah&#x27;s home in Bolton and the two married on 27 February 1987. She encouraged him to grow a moustache and also to give up smoking.

Many of the chimneys around Bolton had now been either repaired, or demolished and so Dibnah was forced to travel further afield for work. He travelled to the Yorkshire Dales to install a lightning conductor on the parish church in Kirkby Malham. While digging the hole for the conductor, they uncovered human bones, for which a reinterment ceremony was held. Their first son, Jack (named after his father&#x27;s trade), was born in 1987. Dibnah offered to make a weathercock, provided that his son was christened in the same church. His second son, Roger, was born in 1991.

==Later life==
In 1996, Dibnah repaired the chimney at Barrow Bridge—the same chimney he had scaled for a bet, in his youth. He was also asked to install a peregrine falcon nest at the top. He was later influential in ensuring the chimney was made a listed building. As a notable raconteur, he also became an after-dinner speaker and would wear his trademark flat cap with his dinner jacket. He made an appearance in a 1996 television advertisement for Kelloggs.

However, the strain of living with a man so dedicated to his hobbies began to take its toll on his wife: Susan met another man and moved out, taking Roger with her and leaving Jack with Fred.

===Third marriage===
By 1997 Dibnah was living alone, with little work or money. Competition from Manchester had reduced his income from steeplejacking and filming for the BBC had dried up completely. He had, however, met Sheila Grundy, a former magician&#x27;s assistant. She had arrived one day with her parents and young son to see Dibnah&#x27;s back yard, and signed the visitor&#x27;s book. The two remained in contact and became friends; they shared an interest in steam and Grundy was fascinated by Dibnah&#x27;s tales of steeplejacking. She and her son moved in with Dibnah in 1998 and the couple married on 26 September that year. At their wedding reception in Bolton, Dibnah was surprised and moved to tears when his youngest daughter, Caroline, came to see him. Dibnah had had little contact with his daughters in the years since his divorce from Alison.

===Television presenting===
In 1997, Dibnah met author David Hall. Hall had been raised in the Bradford district of Manchester and the two swapped tales of growing up in the latter half of the 20th century. Hall suggested that Dibnah would be unlikely to have any further television work commissioned on his life and that he should consider becoming a television presenter. The two worked on new ideas for a programme that would show Dibnah touring the country, visiting important historical locations and speaking to the men involved in the maintenance and restoration of industrial machinery and architecture. The programme would also exploit Dibnah&#x27;s working-class attitude and show him operating some of the machinery he visited. Filming of &quot;Fred Dibnah&#x27;s Industrial Age&quot; began in July 1998. The first location was near Bolton, at the Wet Earth Colliery and the crew then moved on to various locations around the country, continuing to film through the summer and autumn of 1998.

The series achieved high viewing figures, with positive reviews, and the associated website became the second most-visited BBC website at the time. A complementary book was also published and was one of the top five best-selling history books of the year. Dibnah admitted he found speaking to a camera more nerve-racking than climbing a chimney, but the success of &quot;Fred Dibnah&#x27;s Industrial Age&quot; was a portent; he later presented several other television series. Before filming began for &quot;Fred Dibnah&#x27;s Magnificent Monuments&quot;, he had installed his red ladders on the steeple at St Walburge&#x27;s in Preston, ready for an inspection. With filming for television now taking up much of his time, however, he was unable to complete the job. He left the ladders at the church for several years and donated them to the tradesman who eventually took the job.

==Last years==
In 2001, to mark the centenary of the death of Queen Victoria, the BBC transmitted a season of programmes based on a Victorian theme and Dibnah presented &quot;Fred Dibnah&#x27;s Victorian Heroes&quot;. He had long been fascinated by the Victorians, especially Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who was his hero. During filming he visited a number of locations, including the high Clifton Suspension Bridge and the slipway for the SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;.

===Illness===
In early 2001, Dibnah was due to begin filming &quot;Fred Dibnah&#x27;s Building of Britain&quot;, but suffered severe abdominal pains and was admitted to hospital for tests. He was discharged and began filming at locations around the country, including the Globe Theatre, Ely Cathedral and Glamis Castle. Dibnah was the chairman of the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal Society and an episode on the construction of Britain&#x27;s canal network was therefore of particular interest to him. Toward the end of filming, Dibnah went to Bolton Royal Hospital for a check-up, where a tumour was found on his right kidney. The kidney was removed and the tumour was found to be malignant. He went to Christie Hospital in Manchester, where further growths were discovered around his bladder. On the same day, Sheila&#x27;s father fell from the roof of his house and died. Dibnah underwent chemotherapy and once his treatment was finished, tests showed that he was free of cancer.

Filming for &quot;Fred Dibnah&#x27;s Age of Steam&quot; began early in 2003, at the Trencherfield Mill, near Wigan Pier. The film crew visited a number of locations, including a steam rally in Cornwall and the Bluebell Railway in Sussex. Dibnah was travelling around the country working on a subject that fascinated him, visiting old friends and making money from his hobby. The restoration of his traction engine was almost complete; later that year, however, Dibnah had another checkup at Christie Hospital and was told that a large tumour had been found on his bladder.

===&quot;Dig with Dibnah&quot;===
Dibnah had another course of chemotherapy, but this time the treatment was unsuccessful. Undeterred, he began to dig a replica coal mine in the back garden of his home. Although the sight of pithead gear may have been considered by his neighbours to be unusual, as a child raised in Bolton, he had been surrounded by pits such as Ladyshore Colliery and had long harboured an interest in mining. He had already assembled the wooden pithead gear and was planning to sink a brick-lined shaft below this into the hillside. At the bottom of the shaft, a horizontal tunnel would have led out to the steep side of the valley above which his garden sits. 

The intention was to have a narrow gauge railway running along the tunnel, back up the hillside on a rope-hauled inclined plane, returning to the pithead. The ultimate aim was to be able to demonstrate the basic working of an early colliery. Seven years before his diagnosis, therefore, Dibnah had sourced drawings of suitable pithead gear and built a frame from timber and iron bolts. He had applied for and was given planning permission to erect the structure, but made no mention of his wish to dig a shaft underneath it. The BBC decided to make a documentary on Dibnah&#x27;s proposed mine, which would entail his travelling once again around the country, visiting working collieries and heritage mines. Filming started late in 2003, by which time Dibnah and his friend Alf Molyneux had already made a start on the shaft.
Using traditional shaft-sinking techniques and the labour of mining friends Alf Molyneux and Jimmy Crooks, the shaft was sunk to a depth of and lined with brick. The work had been undertaken without planning permission and, when the council eventually found out what was happening, they insisted he apply for planning permission.

Following the sale of Dibnah&#x27;s property, the headgear was acquired by James Palmer of Hindley Green, a lifelong fan of Dibnah, for The Lancashire Mining Museum, where it stands today, funded by Stephen Eckersley .

Palmer says that the day he visited Dibnah&#x27;s House to save the headgear from going to Cumbria was an important day for Dibnah&#x27;s Legacy, as it should stay in Lancashire.

Palmer dismantled the headgear along with Fred fan and friend Jack Bracegirdle ready for transportation to the LMM.

===&quot;Fred Dibnah&#x27;s Made in Britain&quot; ===
Despite Dibnah&#x27;s best efforts, planning permission was refused. Although he appealed against the decision, a new series diverted his attention. At the end of 2003 production began for &quot;Fred Dibnah&#x27;s Made in Britain&quot;. With his friend, Alf Molyneux, Dibnah would tour the country on his completed traction engine, visiting the workshops that still could produce the parts needed for his antique vehicle. His engine, however, was not yet complete and Dibnah&#x27;s medical diagnosis was not good: he knew he had only a short time to live. His traction engine developed a serious fault, but with the help of friends, it was quickly repaired and its restoration completed.
In December 2003, his traction engine was now in working order and planning for the new series commenced. Dibnah&#x27;s illness necessitated that he sleep in hotels, rather than the living van the engine would tow during the trip. For the long distances between locations, the engine would be transported on the back of a low loader. Dibnah&#x27;s engine suffered early mechanical problems; it could barely tow the fully loaded living van uphill, as the cylinder had been placed very slightly closer to the footplate than it should have been. As a result of this, every time the piston was fully forward it covered the steam inlet port. The engine was repaired, and with some minor repair work to one of the pistons, was brought up to full power. The team was joined by Dibnah&#x27;s sons, Jack and Roger.

The production crew made every effort to reduce Dibnah&#x27;s workload. Changes were made to the filming schedule, to allow Dibnah more time to rest at home between filming days. The crew visited the Forth Road Bridge and Dibnah became the first man to drive a traction engine under its own steam across the bridge. Such pleasures provided a welcome distraction for Dibnah, who was by then ill and in pain. By the end of June, he was so ill, he could not continue filming. He was sent home to rest and given medication to alleviate his condition, so that he could collect his MBE.

Filming continued at various locations around the country, with sons Jack and Roger, who had become essential members of the tour, providing much-needed support for their father. By the end of July, the crew had filmed only 34 days with Dibnah, out of a planned 60. It was becoming more difficult by the day for Dibnah to fulfil his filming duties and the crew decided to cut short the schedule. Once home, Dibnah decided to creosote the pithead gear in his garden, but fell and injured his back. He was adamant that he would continue filming, however, and made the trip to North Wales to complete filming. He later made a partial recovery and completed his last days filming at an Ironworks in Atherton.

===Honours===
In mid-2000, Dibnah was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Technology for his achievement in engineering, by Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, and on 19 July 2004, he was made an honorary Doctor of the university by the University of Birmingham.

Dibnah was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2004 New Year Honours for services to heritage and broadcasting. He said &quot;I&#x27;m looking forward to meeting the Queen but I shall probably have to get a new cap. And I&#x27;d like to meet Prince Charles because we share the same views about modern architecture.&quot;

On 7 July 2004, Dibnah went to Buckingham Palace to receive his award from the Queen. He initially planned to drive his traction engine into the palace grounds, but was refused as the Royal Parks Agency feared that its weight would damage the surface of The Mall. Eventually, he was allowed to drive the engine to Wellington Barracks, a short distance from the palace. He collected his medal wearing morning dress and a top hat.

Dibnah was the Castaway on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on 1 December 1991.

===Death===
Dibnah died on 6 November 2004, after suffering from cancer for three years. He was 66 years old.

Eleven days later, thousands of mourners watched as Dibnah&#x27;s coffin (on top of which his trademark flat cap was placed) was towed through the centre of Bolton by his restored traction engine, driven by his son. A cortège of steam-powered vehicles followed, as the procession made its way to Bolton Parish Church. During the hour-long service, David Hall told the congregation &quot;He wasn&#x27;t a posh TV presenter. He was recognised as a working man who had learned through experience.&quot; Following the service, led by the Vicar of Bolton, Canon Michael Williams (a friend of Dibnah), he was buried at Tonge Cemetery, behind his home.

Dibnah changed his will two weeks before his death. He left everything, about £1 million, to his five children from two previous marriages. His last wife Sheila, who was 20 years his junior, subsequently applied to the High Court in a claim for half of the estate, on the basis of &quot;reasonable provision&quot; and the estate eventually reached a settlement.

==Legacy==

Through his television work Dibnah became famous for felling chimneys (he felled 90 in his lifetime), although it was one of his least favourite jobs. As he made more films with Don Haworth, his outspoken views on changing society, work ethics and delinquency, made him the embodiment of the views of many of his fans and epitomised the view of a northern working man.
Dibnah was praised by many notable British people. After reporting on his death, television presenter Peter Sissons remarked: &quot;They don&#x27;t make them like that any more&quot;. Comedian Peter Kay said: &quot;It&#x27;s very sad news. He was one of a kind and now he has gone I think there will be no one else like him. He was enthusiastic about a way of life that has virtually disappeared now.&quot; Brian Tetlow, chairman of the Bolton and District Civic Trust, said: &quot;He&#x27;s unique, not just to Bolton but to Britain and the world. Our thoughts are with his wife and children.&quot;

An bronze statue of Dibnah was unveiled by the Mayor of Bolton, in Bolton town centre, on 29 April 2008. The sculpture was created by Jane Robbins. His home was converted into a heritage centre in 2010 but its contents were sold at auction in March 2018.

A play titled &quot;The Demolition Man&quot;, based on his final years, was staged in 2011 at Bolton&#x27;s Octagon Theatre.

The life and times of Dibnah were celebrated by St Helens comedy folk band the Lancashire Hotpots, who released their song &quot;Dibnah&quot; with a music video in 2016. Band member Dickie Ticker said of Dibnah &quot;When Fred came on the screens – other than on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; – there was no one with a broad Boltonian accent. He was a working class and genuinely nice bloke. Since posting the video we have had dozens and dozens of comments and no one has got a bad word to say about him.&quot;

The American rock band Tuff Sunshine released a song, &quot;The Steeplejack&quot; in 2019 that had been inspired by the 1979 BBC documentary &quot;Fred Dibnah: Steeplejack&quot;.

<text>Eric Wolfgang Weisstein (born March 18, 1969) is an American scientist, mathematician, and encyclopedist who created and maintains the encyclopedias &quot;MathWorld&quot; and &quot;ScienceWorld&quot;. In addition, he is the author of the &quot;CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics&quot;. He works for Wolfram Research.

==Education==
Weisstein holds a Ph.D. in planetary astronomy, which he obtained from the California Institute of Technology&#x27;s Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences in 1996 as well as an M.S. in planetary astronomy in 1993 also from Caltech. Weisstein graduated cum laude from Cornell University with a B.A. in physics and a minor in astronomy in 1990. During his summers away from Cornell, Weisstein participated in research at the Arecibo Observatory, a radio telescope facility in Puerto Rico operated by Cornell. As a graduate student, Weisstein also participated in research at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. During his time at Goddard, Weisstein participated in the development of hurricane visualization software. In 1996 Weisstein published his doctoral thesis titled &quot;Millimeter/Submillimeter Fourier Transform Spectroscopy of Jovian Planet Atmospheres&quot;, which was completed under faculty advisor Dewey Muhleman and in association with Eugene Serabyn, who later became a member of the Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

==Career==

===Academic research===
Upon completion of his doctorate, Weisstein became a research scientist at Caltech in January 1996 and continued work in the field of submillimeter spectroscopy. He collaborated with Eugene Serabyn and published several papers. Six months later, he moved to the University of Virginia&#x27;s Department of Astronomy in Charlottesville where he remained for three years to continue his research.

===MathWorld, ScienceWorld, and Wolfram Research===
In 1995, Weisstein converted a Microsoft Word document of over 200 pages to hypertext format and uploaded it to his webspace at Caltech under the title &quot;Eric&#x27;s Treasure Trove of Sciences.&quot; After Weisstein transferred to the University of Virginia to continue his work in astronomy, he continued to refine his fledgling encyclopedia. In November 1998, Weisstein made a deal with the CRC Press to publish his encyclopedia in book format as the &quot;CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics&quot;. A year later, in 1999, Weisstein accepted the position of encyclopedist at Wolfram Research, Inc. (WRI). &quot;MathWorld&quot; was ready to be unveiled in December 1999 with nearly 13,000 entries, most of them written by Weisstein, encompassing a variety of disciplines, including algebra, geometry, calculus, discrete mathematics, topology, number theory, statistics, and the foundations.

&quot;MathWorld&quot; became involved in a legal dispute with the CRC Press in March 2000. The CRC Press claimed &quot;MathWorld&quot; violated the copyright on the &quot;CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics&quot;. During the dispute, a court order shut down &quot;MathWorld&quot; for over a year starting October 23, 2000. According to Eric Weisstein&#x27;s personal site, he restarted MathWorld on November 6, 2001. This ultimately led to the creation of PlanetMath. Wolfram Research, Stephen Wolfram, and Eric Weisstein settled with the CRC Press for an undisclosed financial award and several benefits. Among these benefits are the inclusion of a copyright notice of the CRC Press at the bottom of all webpages in &quot;MathWorld&quot; and legal rights to reproduce &quot;MathWorld&quot; in a book format again.

&quot;ScienceWorld&quot;, also known as &quot;Eric Weisstein&#x27;s World of Science&quot;, was unveiled to the general public in January 2002. &quot;ScienceWorld&quot; includes more than 1,000 entries in many fields of science including astronomy, chemistry, physics and biographies of scientists.

===Further scientific activities===

In 2014, he became a member of the Global Digital Mathematics Library Working Group of the International Mathematical Union.

<text>Gladys Rosa Zender de Meier (née Zender Urbina; born 19 October 1939) is a Peruvian model and beauty queen who became the first Latina to win the Miss Universe title. She was crowned Miss Peru Universe 1957 by Miss Peru Universe 1956, Lola Sabogal Morzán.

==Miss Universe==
Born to a Swiss father and a Peruvian mother, she won the title of Miss Universe 1957 in Long Beach, California, United States.

After being crowned, it was revealed that she was only 17 years old, a few months under the contest&#x27;s minimum age requirement. Pageant officials decided that she could keep the crown after they were told she was considered to be 18 in Peru.

==Return to Peru==
Zender became an instant celebrity.

*She flew on the inaugural flight from Idlewild International Airport in New York City, New York, to Lima Airport in Lima, Peru, where she was greeted by thousands of fans.
*&quot;Caretas&quot;, one of Peru&#x27;s most-popular newsmagazines, soon featured Zender on their cover. She was also later featured on that publication&#x27;s first all-color cover.
* In March 1958, she agreed to accompany the then sailor Juan Carlos de Borbon, who was on a 4-day stay in Lima during his time as a trainee aboard Spain&#x27;s insignia ship, the Sebastian Elcano, to a couple of social events. He became King of Spain in 1975 and abdicated the crown to his son Felipe VI, in 2014. 
* The Peruvian composer Alicia Maguiña wrote a song called &quot;Polka a Gladys Zender&quot; (Polka dedicated to Gladys Zender). It was also titled &quot;La más hermosa&quot; (The most beautiful) and was recorded by the Peruvian group Los Troveros Criollos.

==Personal life==
Zender married Antonio Meier in 1965, and secluded herself into a family life; they had four children together. Their son, Christian Meier, is a well-known actor and singer in Peru and has achieved some fame in other Latin American countries.
In 2003, Zender allowed &quot;Caretas&quot; to photograph her (and Meier&#x27;s) home showcasing various artifacts, including a collection of Incan art the couple have acquired through their years together.

<doc id="836209" wikidata="Q1151844" url="?curid=836209" title="Sankin-kōtai">
<text>Sankin-kōtai (, now commonly written as ) was a policy of the Tokugawa shogunate during most of the Edo period, created to control the daimyo, the feudal lords of Japan, politically, and to keep them from attempting to overthrow the regime. It required most daimyo to alternate between living in their domain and in the shogunate&#x27;s capital, Edo, every year. This made the daimyo subject to constant surveillance from the shogunate. This also forced the daimyo to have residences in both their domain and Edo. The cost of maintaining several lavish residences as well as the journeys to and from Edo was a constant drain on the finances of the daimyo, which greatly increased the shogunate&#x27;s control over them and kept them militarily weak. The daimyo were also required to keep their wife and children in Edo permanently to act as hostages.

==History==
Toyotomi Hideyoshi had earlier established a similar practice of requiring his feudal lords to keep their wives and heirs at Osaka Castle or the nearby vicinity as hostages to ensure their loyalty. Following the Battle of Sekigahara and the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, this practice was continued at the new capital of Edo as a matter of custom. It was made compulsory for the &quot;tozama daimyōs&quot; in 1635, and for the &quot;fudai daimyōs&quot; from 1642. Aside from an eight-year period under the rule of Tokugawa Yoshimune, the law remained in force until 1862.

===Predecessors===
The &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system was a natural outgrowth of pre-existing practices which were expanded by the Tokugawa shogunate to further their own political interests. Much of the reason the newly created shogunate could impose &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; on the defeated &quot;daimyo&quot; with ease was due to these immediate predecessors.
====Kamakura period====
The Tokugawa period philosopher Kumazawa Banzan wrote in his &quot;Daigaku wakumon&quot; that the Kamakura shogunate had its own version of alternate attendance, which made &quot;gokenin&quot; visit the shogun&#x27;s court in Kamakura for fifty days once every three years. Kumazawa claimed that his account was based on records preserved by the descendants of ancient Kamakura families. Modern scholars have been unable to confirm the existence of such detailed rules, but there is evidence that, at least in principle, Kamakura period &quot;gokenin&quot; owed some kind of service at the shogun&#x27;s court. The obligatory &quot;ōyuka&quot; service required &quot;gokenin&quot; to attend at the shogun&#x27;s court for one month. They were also required to attend on special occasions such as comings of age, weddings, and funerals.

The principal duty of the &quot;gokenin&quot; was &quot;&quot;, which was periodic guard duty at Kyoto and Kamakura. It originated as a public duty of the warrior class, requiring performance of guard service in Kyoto in one out of every three years. In 1186, Minamoto no Yoritomo made this service mandatory for &quot;gokenin&quot; and reduced the duration to six months, and then later to three. In 1275, a similar arrangement was instituted at Kamakura, making &quot;gokenin&quot; in eastern Japan serve there for one month annually. Important &quot;gokenin&quot; who frequently performed guard service there maintained residences in Kamakura, even those from remoter regions in western Japan. It was also frequent practice for &quot;shugo&quot; and &quot;jitō&quot; to have their sons serve in the shogun&#x27;s court, acting as hostages. In some cases, families were kept in Kamakura.

These obligations on the Kamakura &quot;gokenin&quot; had a limiting effect on local independence, like the more rigid &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system that emerged in the Edo period. Shimmi Kichiji claimed that the prolonged absence of the &quot;gokenin&quot; from their fiefs due to their obligatory attendance at the capital delayed the development of true feudalism in Japan.

==Description==

The details changed throughout the 26 decades of Tokugawa rule, but generally, the requirement was that the &quot;daimyōs&quot; of every &quot;han&quot; move periodically between Edo and his fief, typically spending alternate years in each place. His wife and heir were required to remain in Edo as hostages while he was away. The expenditures necessary to maintain lavish residences in both places, and for the procession to and from Edo, placed financial strains on the daimyo, making them unable to wage war. The frequent travel of the daimyo encouraged road building and the construction of inns and facilities along the routes, generating economic activity.

There were a number of exceptions for certain &quot;fudai daimyōs&quot; in the vicinity of Edo, who were allowed to alternate their attendance in Edo every six months instead. Temporary exceptional dispensations were also occasionally granted due to illness or extreme extenuating circumstances.

In principle, the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; was a military service to the shōgun. Each &quot;daimyō&quot; was required to furnish a number of soldiers (samurai) in accordance with the &quot;kokudaka&quot; assessment of his domain. These soldiers accompanied the &quot;daimyō&quot; on the processions to and from Edo.

With hundreds of &quot;daimyōs&quot; entering or leaving Edo each year, were almost daily occurrences in the shogunal capital. The main routes to the provinces were the &quot;kaidō&quot;. Special lodgings, the , were available to &quot;daimyōs&quot; during their travels.

== Effects ==

=== Economic ===
The expense of maintaining lavish residences in both Edo and their domain as well as the costly annual journeys to and from Edo was disastrous for the daimyo and greatly enhanced the political control imposed by the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system. As the main source of money for most daimyo was mainly dependent on the rice surplus, which was sharply limited by the relative inflexibility of the productive capacity of the &quot;han&quot;, the incomes of the daimyo were unable to keep up with the increasing financial needs of the daimyo, forcing them to go into debt. &quot;Sankin-kōtai&quot; expenses regularly made up 70 to 80 percent of the total annual expenditures of daimyo. Economic programs, efforts to increase production, and special taxes were all attempted, but offered no permanent solution. By the Genroku period, practically every daimyo was deep in debt due to the extravagant spending universal during this period. Even the wealthiest feudatory, the Maeda clan of Kaga, began to encounter financial difficulties at this time.

== Similar practices ==
King Louis XIV of France instituted a similar practice upon the completion of his palace at Versailles, requiring the French nobility, particularly the ancient &quot;Noblesse d&#x27;épée&quot; (&quot;nobility of the sword&quot;) to spend six months of each year at the palace, for reasons similar to those of the Japanese shōguns. The nobles were expected to assist the king in his daily duties and state and personal functions, including meals, parties, and, for the privileged, rising from and getting into bed, bathing, and going to church.

<doc id="836212" wikidata="Q1396420" url="?curid=836212" title="Huvishka">
<text>Huvishka (Kushan: Οοηϸκι, &quot;Ooēški&quot;, Brahmi: 𑀳𑀼𑀯𑀺𑀱𑁆𑀓; &#x27;,&#x27;; Kharosthi: 𐨱𐨂𐨬𐨅𐨮𐨿𐨐 &#x27;,&#x27;) was the emperor of the Kushan Empire from the death of Kanishka (assumed on the best evidence available to be in 150 CE) until the succession of Vasudeva I about thirty years later.

His rule was a period of consolidation for the Empire. Huvishka&#x27;s territory encompassed Balkh in Bactria to Mathura in India, locations where it is known that he minted his coinage. Gold coins and amulets in his effigy were found as far as Pataliputra and Bodh Gaya, including one such amulet as an offering under the Enlightenment Throne of the Buddha in Bodh Gaya, suggesting with other finds of Kushan coins in the area that Kushan rule may have extended this far east. His reign seems to have been essentially peaceful, consolidating Kushan power in northern India, and moving the centre of the Kushan Empire to the southern capital city of Mathura.

==Religion==

Huvishka was the son of Kanishka. His reign is also known as the golden age of Kushan rule.

===Mahayana Buddhism===
The reign of Huvishka corresponds with the first known epigraphic evidence of the Buddha Amitabha, on the bottom part of a 2nd-century statue which has been found in Govindo-Nagar, and now at the Mathura Museum. The statue is dated to &quot;the 28th year of the reign of Huvishka&quot;, and dedicated to &quot;Amitabha Buddha&quot; by a family of merchants.

There is also some evidence that Huvishka was a follower of Mahāyāna Buddhism. A Sanskrit manuscript fragment in the Schøyen Collection describes Huvishka as one who has &quot;set forth in the Mahāyāna.&quot; This depiction of Huviska as a Mahayana follower does not necessarily confirm his involvement in promoting Mahayana. However, it does suggest that &quot;Huviska&#x27;s era was a crucial period in the evolution of Mahayana.&quot;

Some reliefs from Gandhara are also thought to portray Huvishka making donations to the Buddha.

Huvishka is widely attested to have supported Buddhism, but the Buddha does not appear on his coinage, possibly out of respect to the Buddha.


===Graeco-Roman deities===
Huvishka also incorporates in his coins for the first and only time in Kushan coinage the Hellenistic-Egyptian Serapis (under the name &quot;ϹΑΡΑΠΟ&quot;, &quot;Sarapo&quot;). Since Serapis was the supreme deity of the pantheon of Alexandria in Egypt, this coin suggests that Huvishka had a strong orientation towards Roman Egypt, which may have been an important market for the products coming from the Kushan Empire.

Another coin possibly depicts the Goddess Roma (&quot;Roma aeterna&quot;), under the name &quot;Rishti&quot; (Greek: ΡΙϷΤ), or &quot;Riom&quot; (Greek: ΡΙΟΜ).

===Iranian deities===
Huvishka is also known to have included Iranian deities in his pantheon. Between 164 and 174, he established a temple to &quot;Pharro&quot; (&quot;Royal splendour&quot;)-&quot;Ardoxsho&quot; in the stronghold of Ayrtam, near Termez, according to the &quot;Ayrtam inscription&quot;. He also issued numerous coins in the name of these deities. Many more Iranian deities are also known from his coinage, such as &quot;Miiro&quot; (Mitra), &quot;Mao&quot; (the Lunar deity Mah), &quot;Nana&quot; (Anahita), &quot;Atsho&quot; (Atar, &quot;The Royal fire&quot;). Another Zoroastrian deity, the supreme god &quot;Ooromozdo&quot; (Ahura Mazda), and &quot;Mazdo oana&quot; (&quot;Mazda the victorious&quot;) also appears. Other Zoroastrian deities include &quot;Rishti&quot; (&quot;Uprightness&quot;, Arshtat), &quot;Ashaeixsho&quot; (&quot;Best righteousness&quot;, Asha Vahishta), the Lunar deity Mah (&quot;Mao&quot;), &quot;Shaoreoro&quot; (&quot;Best royal power&quot;, Khshathra Vairya).

===Indian deities===

Huvishka is known to have restored a temple in Mathura, where provisions were made for hospitality towards the Brahmans. Some of the coins of Huvishka also featured Maaseno on his coins, the Kushan incarnation of the Hindu god Karttikeya, or Skanda, whose epithet was &quot;Mahasena&quot;. This god being particularly important to the Yaudheyas, it may have been incorporated into Kushan coinage when the Kushans expanded into Yaudheya territory in order to establish control of the Mathura area. It may also have been adopted as a way to appease the warlike Yaudheyas. In effect, the Kushans became the suzerains of the Yaudheyas in the area.

In a departure from his predecessor Kanishka, Huvishka also added &quot;Oesho&quot; (&quot;ΟΗϷΟ&quot;, Shiva) on some of his coinage. In replacement of the Iranian god of war Ořlagno, he also added several Indian war gods, such as Skando (Old Indian Skanda), Komaro (Old Indian Kumara), Maaseno (Old Indian Mahāsena), Bizago (Old Indian Viśākha), and even Ommo (Old Indian Umā), the consort of Siva. This could suggest an evolution toward Indian deities among the Kushans, possibly motivated by the enlisting of Indian warriors.

==Coinage and statuary==
The coinage of Huvishka is characterized by a great variety of designs and the large quantity of gold coins that were minted: more gold coins from Huvishka are known than from all other Kushan rulers combined. The locations of his mints were mainly in Balkh and Peshawar, with smaller mints in Kashmir and Mathura.

One of the great remaining puzzles of Huvishka&#x27;s reign is the devaluation of his coinage. Early in his reign the copper coinage plunged in weight from a standard of 16g to about 10–11g. The quality and weight then continued to decline throughout the reign until at the start of the reign of Vasudeva the standard coin (a tetradrachm) weighed only 9g. The devaluation led to a massive production of imitations, and an economic demand for the older, pre-devaluation coins in the Gangetic valley. However, the motivation and some of the details of this devaluation are still unknown.

<doc id="836237" wikidata="Q1282366" url="?curid=836237" title="Vasudeva I">
<text>Vāsudeva I (Kushano Bactrian: Βαζοδηο &quot;Bazodeo&quot;; Middle Brahmi: 𑀯𑀸𑀲𑀼𑀤𑁂𑀯; &quot;&quot;, Chinese: 波調 &quot;Bodiao&quot;; fl. 200 CE) was a Kushan emperor, last of the &quot;Great Kushans.&quot; Named inscriptions dating from year 64 to 98 of Kanishka&#x27;s era suggest his reign extended from at least 191 to 232 CE. He ruled in Northern India and Central Asia, where he minted coins in the city of Balkh (Bactria). He probably had to deal with the rise of the Sasanians and the first incursions of the Kushano-Sasanians in the northwest of his territory.

The last named inscription of his predecessor, Huvishka, was in the year 60 of the Kanishka era (187 CE), and the Chinese evidence suggests he was still ruling as late as 229 CE.
His name &quot;Vāsudeva&quot;, is that of the popular Hindu God Vāsudeva, which refers to Krishna, and he was the first Kushan king to be named after the Indian God. He converted to Hinduism during his reign. His name reinforces the notion that his center of power was in Mathura.

==Contacts with China==
In the Chinese historical chronicle Sanguozhi (三國志), he is recorded to have sent tribute to the Chinese emperor Cao Rui of the Wei in 229 CE (3rd year of Taihe 太和), : 
:&quot;The king of the Da Yuezhi, Bodiao (波調) (Vāsudeva), sent his envoy to present tribute and His Majesty granted him a title of &quot;King of the Da Yuezhi Intimate with Wei (魏)&quot;.&quot; (Sanguozhi)

He is the last Kushan ruler to be mentioned in Chinese sources. His rule corresponds to the retreat of Chinese power from Central Asia, and it is thought that Vasudeva may have filled the power vacuum in that area. The great expansion of the Dharmaguptaka Buddhist group in Central Asia during this period has also been related to this event.

==Coinage==
The coinage of Vasudeva consisted in gold dinars and quarter dinars, as well as copper coins. Vasudeva almost entirely removed the pantheon of deities displayed in the coinage of Kanishka and Huvishka. Apart from a few coins with the effigies of Mao and Nana, all of Vasudeva&#x27;s coins feature Oesho on the reverse, who is generally identified as Shiva. On the obverse, Vasudeva restored the royal imagery of Kanishka, with the standing, making a sacrifice over an altar, although he holds a trident rather than Kanishka&#x27;s spear and he appears nimbate. Another trident is sometimes also added over the small sacrificial altar. At the end of his rule, Vasudeva introduced the nandipada symbol () on his coinage.

==Sassanid invasion in the northwest==
Vasudeva I was the last great Kushan emperor, and the end of his rule coincides with the invasion of the Sassanians as far as northwestern India, and the establishment of the Indo-Sassanians or Kushanshahs from around 240 CE. Vasudeva I may have lost the territory of Bactria with its capital in Balkh to Ardashir I Kushanshah. Thereafter, Kushan rule would be restricted to their eastern territories, in western and central Punjab.


==Statuary==
The relatively peaceful reign of Vasudeva is marked by an important artistic production, in particular in the area of statuary. Several Buddhist statues are dated to the reign of Vasudeva, and are important markers for the chronology of Buddhist art.

An inscription on the base of the Buddha statue of Vasudeva I is also known from the Mathura Museum: &quot;In the 93rd year of Maharaja Devaputra Vasudeva...&quot;, probably corresponding to , or 220 CE with the more recent definition of the Kanishka era as starting in 127 CE. A partially preserved Sakyamuni statue, also from Mathura, has the date &quot;Year 94&quot;, although without mentioning Vasudeva specifically.

Dedications in the name of Vasudeva, with dates, also appear on Jain statuary discovered in Mathura.

<text>A steeplejack is a craftsman who scales buildings, chimneys, and church steeples to carry out repairs or maintenance. 
==Processes and techniques==
Steeplejacks erect ladders on church spires, industrial chimneys, cooling towers, bell towers, clock towers, or any other high structure. In the UK, steeplejacks now use a belay rope fall-arrest system (similar to the method used by rock climbers) attached to the ladders as they are erected to eliminate solo climbing and greatly reduce the risk of falls from height.

Once ladders have been erected, the next stage is usually to suspend a bosun&#x27;s chair (a strong wooden plank on which the steeplejack can sit, pull themselves upwards or lower themselves downwards, or sit in a stationary position), but abseiling (UK) or rappelling (US) equipment is replacing the bosun&#x27;s chair on many operations because of its lighter weight.
Once this has been done it is possible to use this access to begin building scaffolding to carry out any repairs which may be required. This is done by fixing anchors into the wall (whether concrete, stone, or brick) and &quot;kicking&quot; the scaffolding off from there.

It is also possible to carry out repairs from &quot;suspended access cradles&quot;. These are the same type of rig window cleaners use on skyscrapers. The cradle is suspended from four wires. Two of these run through an electric motor which can &quot;climb&quot; or &quot;descend&quot; the wire, and the other two run freely through a box which allows the cradle to travel upwards with no obstruction, but will stop it instantly if it starts to fall. These &quot;suspended access cradles&quot; are popularly called &quot;swing stages&quot; by their crews.
==Duties==
Steeplejacks are called upon to repair or replace masonry (brick, stone or concrete), carry out general carpentry or painting or roof repair, remove and clean and repair windows, as well as sandblasting and other masonry cleaning tasks.

<text>Vasudeva II (Middle Brahmi script: &quot;Vā-su-de-va&quot;) was a Kushan emperor who ruled . He was probably the successor of Kanishka III and may have been succeeded by an emperor named Shaka Kushan.

Vasudeva II probably only was a local ruler in the area of Taxila, in western Punjab, under the suzerainty of the Gupta Empire.

Vasudeva II was a contemporary of Hormizd I Kushanshah of the Kushano-Sasanians, as he is known to have overstruck a large quantity of the early copper coins of Hormizd I issued south of the Hindu-Kush.

<text>Weezer (commonly known as the Blue Album) is the debut studio album by the American rock band Weezer, released on May 10, 1994, by DGC Records. It was produced by Ric Ocasek of the Cars.

Weezer formed in Los Angeles in 1992, and initially struggled to engage audiences, who were more interested in grunge. In November, they recorded a demo, &quot;The Kitchen Tape&quot;, which brought them to the attention of DGC owner Geffen Records. Weezer selected Ocasek to produce because of his work with the Cars. Most of the album was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City between August and September 1993. The group treated the guitars and bass as a single, 10-string instrument, playing in unison. Guitarist Jason Cropper was fired during recording, as the band felt he was threatening their chemistry; he was replaced by Brian Bell.

&quot;Weezer&quot; was supported by the singles &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot;, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, and &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot;, which were accompanied by music videos. The album received critical acclaim and reached number sixteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified 5x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2024. It remains Weezer&#x27;s best-selling album, with more than 15 million copies sold worldwide by 2009. It has been named one of the best albums of the 1990s by several publications. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 294 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

== Musical style ==
&quot;Weezer&quot; has been described as a fusion of &quot;chart-angled hook-craft&quot; with &quot;roaring&quot; guitar distortion, confessional lyrics and &quot;unashamedly vibrant&quot; melodies. Andy Price of Guitar.com observed that the album&#x27;s sound and aesthetic were &quot;distinctly non-alternative&quot;, stating that the band instead &quot;took their style cues from the DIY slackers of the lo-fi indie scene, albeit with a broader audience in mind.&quot;

== Background ==
Weezer was formed on February 14, 1992, in Los Angeles by singer and guitarist Rivers Cuomo, drummer Patrick Wilson, bassist Matt Sharp, and guitarist Jason Cropper. Although they performed future hits including &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot; and &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot;, Cuomo said they struggled to engage audiences, who wanted to see grunge bands instead.

In an effort to create buzz around Los Angeles, Weezer recorded a demo, &quot;The Kitchen Tape&quot;. This attracted attention from major-label A&amp;R reps looking for alternative rock bands to perform on the same bill as That Dog. Weezer were signed to DGC Records on June 26, 1993, by Todd Sullivan, an A&amp;R rep from Geffen Records.

== Recording and production ==
While preparing for the studio sessions, Weezer focused on their vocal interplay by practicing barbershop quartet-style songs, which helped Cuomo and Sharp feel more comfortable collaborating during rehearsals. Sharp, who had never sung before joining Weezer, developed his falsetto: &quot;I had to sing an octave higher than Rivers. After a lot of practice, I started to get it down.&quot;

Weezer rehearsed 15 songs in New York City in preparation for the Electric Lady Studios sessions. Four songs from this rehearsal would not be attempted for the album: &quot;I Swear It&#x27;s True&quot;, &quot;Getting Up and Leaving&quot;, a reprise of &quot;In the Garage&quot;, and &quot;Mykel and Carli&quot;, an ode to the sisters Mykel and Carli Allan, who ran the Weezer fanclub. Weezer later recorded another version of &quot;Mykel and Carli&quot; as a B-side for the single &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot;, with the Weezer collaborator Karl Koch.

Weezer considered self-producing the album, but were pressured by Geffen to choose a producer. They decided on Ric Ocasek, who was the frontman for the Cars. Ocasek convinced them to switch their guitar pickups from the neck to the bridge, resulting in a brighter sound. Sharp and Cuomo imposed several rules on recording, banning reverb and insisting on all downstrokes on guitar. According to the engineer Chris Shaw, the &quot;overriding concept&quot; was to treat the guitars and bass as a single, 10-string instrument, playing in unison. Weezer insisted that the guitars were mixed as loudly as those in Radiohead&#x27;s 1992 song &quot;Creep&quot;, burying some vocals.

During the recording, Cropper learned that his girlfriend was pregnant and began acting erratically. Koch said: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t handling it well … He always said he was fine, and then 20 minutes later he&#x27;d be up on the roof of Electric Lady screaming or something.&quot; Sharp said later that &quot;whatever it is we were setting out to do, it felt like it was gonna be much more difficult if he stayed&quot;. Sharp and Cuomo felt that Cropper would likely leave Weezer eventually and so wanted to remove him before the release of their debut, as they &quot;wanted things to be very stable for the audience&quot;. According to Cropper, Cuomo told him he could not allow him to jeopardize the work and asked him to leave. In 2014, Cropper said Cuomo had made the right decision. 

Cropper left after recording was complete, and was replaced by Brian Bell. While Bell&#x27;s vocals appear on some tracks, Cuomo re-recorded all of Cropper&#x27;s guitar parts. Ocasek recalled: &quot;Rivers came in and said, &#x27;I&#x27;m firing the guitar player, and I&#x27;m going to do all his guitar parts over.&#x27; I said, &#x27;You can&#x27;t do that!&#x27; But he did. In one take.&quot; Bell is credited in the liner notes for playing guitar, while Cropper received a credit on &quot;My Name Is Jonas&quot; for writing the intro.

== Artwork ==

The album artwork, photographed by Peter Gowland, features Wilson, Cuomo, Sharp, and Bell standing in front of a plain blue background. Cuomo said that, while the band liked the photo, Sharp was not happy with the way his head looked, so a Geffen art director used Adobe Photoshop to replace his head with one from another shot. 

The image was used prominently in advertising for the album. The cover was compared to that of the Feelies&#x27; album &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot;, which Weezer had no prior knowledge of. Instead, according to the Weezer collaborator Karl Koch, Cuomo was inspired by the cover of a cheap Beach Boys greatest-hits cassette, which featured the Beach Boys with striped shirts in front of a blue background. The cover has become a part of internet culture and used in memes, usually accompanied by the song &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, from the album. In 2024, the 30th anniversary of the album, Weezer unveiled a mural based on the cover art in Brooklyn, New York City.

== Promotion ==
The first single, &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot;, was described by Cuomo as &quot;the feeling you get when the train stops and the little guy comes knockin&#x27; on your door. It was supposed to be a sad song, but everyone thinks it&#x27;s hilarious.&quot; The video marks one of the early directorial efforts of Spike Jonze, whose pitch was simply &quot;A blue stage, a steadicam, a pack of wild dogs.&quot; The video became an instant hit on MTV. The final single, &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot;, was inspired by Cuomo believing his parents split up when he was four because he thought his father was an alcoholic. The music video, directed by Sophie Muller, was less successful than the previous, Spike Jonze–directed video. It featured the band performing in the garage of their former house and the bandmates playing hacky sack in the backyard.

== Release ==
The Blue Album was released on May 10, 1994. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) just under seven months later, on December 1, 1994, and was certified platinum by the RIAA on January 13, 1995. The Blue Album was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA on August 8, 1995. The album was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA on November 13, 1998. The album peaked at no. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. As a single, &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot; peaked at no. 35 on the UK Top 40, and &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; and &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot; peaked at no. 12 and no. 37 on the UK Top 40 respectively. In the U.S., &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; peaked at no. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart.

A deluxe edition of the album was released on March 23, 2004, comprising the original album and a second disc, &quot;Dusty Gems and Raw Nuggets&quot;, containing B-sides and rarities. As of December 2007, the deluxe edition had sold 86,000 copies. The second disc is also available separately.

A super deluxe edition of the album was announced on September 4, 2024, in celebration of the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, releasing on November 1, 2024. It contains a remastered version of the original album, along with BBC recordings, a variant of the Kitchen Tapes entitled &quot;Opposite Sides of the Same Good Ol&#x27; Fence&quot;, early live recordings of both released and unreleased songs, and recordings from the LMU sessions (including the previously released B-side &quot;Jamie&quot;).

== Critical reception ==

The Blue Album received critical acclaim. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album in its year-end review, saying, &quot;Weezer&#x27;s Rivers Cuomo is great at sketching vignettes (the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; games and Kiss posters that inspire the hapless daydreamer of &#x27;In the Garage&#x27;), and with sweet inspiration like the waltz tempo of &#x27;My Name Is Jonas&#x27; and the self-deprecating humor of lines like &quot;I look just like Buddy Holly / And you&#x27;re Mary Tyler Moore&quot;, his songs easily ingratiate.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was less complimentary and awarded the album a &quot;neither&quot; rating. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; concluded that &quot;Weezer alternates between being agreeably irreverent and merely bratty... &#x27;Buddy Holly&#x27; is a pleasant piece of retro-rock—actually, it sounds more like early 10cc than any song the Crickets ever performed&quot;.

The &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; video won four awards at the 1995 &quot;MTV Video Music Awards&quot;, including prizes for Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Video. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 294 on its updated “500 Greatest Albums of All Time” list.

== Legacy ==
The Blue Album has become one of the most highly regarded albums of the 1990s, as well as of all time, appearing on many &quot;best of&quot; lists. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 294 on its 2020 list of the “500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It was previously ranked at 297 in 2003, and 299 in 2012. In 2002, the readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album the 21st greatest of all time. &quot;Blender&quot; named the Blue Album among the &quot;500 CDs You Must Own&quot;, calling the album &quot;Absolute geek-rock, out and proud.&quot; Non-U.S. publications have acclaimed the album as well: Visions of Germany ranked it number 32 on a list of &quot;The Most Important Albums of the 90s&quot;. In November 2011, the Blue Album was ranked number three on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1994, with Bad Religion&#x27;s &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; and the Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Smash&quot; in first and second places respectively. The album also peaked at number 25 on &quot;Guitar World&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list.

Reviews of the album when its deluxe edition was released have reflected its rise in stature, continuing to be positive. In 2004, &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave the album a very positive review, saying, &quot;I&#x27;d go so far to declare the &#x27;Blue Album&#x27; one of the greatest records of the last 20 years.&quot; And &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reiterated its original positive review by further describing it as &quot;big, vibrant pop-rock that would inspire thousands of emo kids&quot;. Blogcritics gave the album 10/10 and described it as &quot;one of the most important debut albums of the last ten years&quot;. 

In naming &quot;Weezer&quot; the 26th best album of the 1990s, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; summed up the album&#x27;s critical recognition:
&quot;NME&quot; credited the album as a formative influence on &quot;melodic emo&quot;. In a 2024 article commemorating the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Mikael Wood of AOL wrote: AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a perfect score, commending it as &quot;emblematic of its time&quot; and calling it one of the most essential albums of the 1990s.

The band performed the album in its entirety during the &quot;Memories Tour&quot; in 2010 and did so again during the &quot;Voyage to the Blue Planet Tour&quot; in 2024. On March 15, the band performed the album in its entirety at the Lodge Room in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles as a pre-kickoff of the Voyage Tour, with Dogstar as the opening band. Former bassist Matt Sharp attended, and Dominic Fike sang and played &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot; with the band as a surprise.

<doc id="836322" wikidata="Q1723774" url="?curid=836322" title="Kanishka III">
<text>Samrat Kanishka III (Greco-Bactrian: ΚΑΝΗϷΚΕ &quot;Kanēške&quot;; Kharosthi: 𐨐𐨞𐨁𐨮𐨿𐨐 &#x27;,&#x27;; Brahmi: &#x27;,&#x27;; ), was a Kushan emperor who reigned from around the year 265 CE to 270 CE. He is believed to have succeeded Vasishka and was succeeded by Vasudeva II. He ruled in areas of Northwestern India.

==Inscriptions==
In an inscription dated to the &quot;Year 41&quot; (probably of the 2nd century of the Kanishka era) and discovered on the borders of the river Ara in Punjab, he qualifies himself as a &quot;Maharaja rajadhiraja Devaputra Kaisara Kanishka&quot; (&quot;Great King, King of Kings, Son of God, Caesar, Kanishka), suggesting some awareness of the Roman Empire as &quot;Kaisara&quot; seems to stand for &quot;Caesar&quot;, and names himself as the son of Vajheshka, identified as Kushan ruler Vashishka. The inscription is rather worn and the reading &quot;Kaisara&quot; has been doubted, especially since no other mentions of this title are known from Kushan sources.


==Coinage==
It was initially thought that there were no definite coins known of him, as the &quot;Kanishka&quot; named in the coins was not differentiated. Only workmanship and graphical style in relation to other known rulers, tend to suggest attribution to this later Kanishka. However, this hypothesis was shaken by coin hoards being found in Tajikistan where coins of Kanishka III were found and identified in large numbers. All these finds north of the Oxus river seems to indicate that it was legal tender for a period of time.

<doc id="836332" wikidata="Q7759960" url="?curid=836332" title="The Red Wheelbarrow">
<text>&quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot; is a poem by American modernist poet William Carlos Williams. Originally published without a title, it was designated &quot;XXII&quot; in Williams&#x27; 1923 book &quot;Spring and All&quot;, a hybrid collection which incorporated alternating selections of free verse and prose. Only 16 words long, &quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot; is one of Williams&#x27; most frequently anthologized poems, and a prime example of early twentieth-century Imagism.

==Writing and publication==

The pictorial style in which the poem is written owes much to the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and the precisionist style of Charles Sheeler, an American photographer-painter whom Williams met shortly before composing the poem. The poem represents an early stage in Williams&#x27; development as a poet. It focuses on the objective representation of objects, in line with the Imagist philosophy that was ten years old at the time of the poem&#x27;s publication. The poem is written in a brief, haiku-like free-verse form. With regard to the inspiration for the poem, Williams wrote in 1954:

[&quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot;] sprang from affection for an old Negro named Marshall. He had been a fisherman, caught porgies off Gloucester. He used to tell me how he had to work in the cold in freezing weather, standing ankle deep in cracked ice packing down the fish. He said he didn&#x27;t feel cold. He never felt cold in his life until just recently. I liked that man, and his son Milton almost as much. In his back yard I saw the red wheelbarrow surrounded by the white chickens. I suppose my affection for the old man somehow got into the writing.

In 2015, research identified the man who had inspired the work as Thaddeus Lloyd Marshall Sr., who lived a few blocks away from Williams in Rutherford, New Jersey, and is buried in Ridgelawn Cemetery in neighboring Clifton.

When the poem was originally published in &quot;Spring and All&quot;, it was simply titled &quot;XXII&quot;, denoting the poem&#x27;s order within the book. Referring to the poem as &quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot; has been frowned upon by some critics, including Neil Easterbrook, who said that such reference gives the text &quot;a specifically different frame&quot; than which Williams originally intended.

Prior to the revelation about Marshall, some critics and literary analysts believed that the poem was written about one of Williams&#x27; patients, a little girl who was seriously ill:
This poem is reported to have been inspired by a scene in Passaic, New Jersey, where Williams was attending to a sick young girl. Worried that his patient may not survive, Williams looked out the window and saw the wheelbarrow and chickens.

At the time, I remember being mystified by the poem. However, being properly trained in literary criticism, I wondered what the real meaning of the poem was, what it was really about. ... What is left out of Williams&#x27; poem is the fact that when he conceived that image he was sitting at the bedside of a very sick child (Williams was a medical doctor). The story goes that as he sat there, deeply concerned about the child, he looked out the window, saw that image, and penned those words.

I remember well the sneer associated with sentimentality in the university English classes of the early 70s. William Carlos Williams&#x27; celebrated red wheelbarrow poem was written after a night at the bedside of a desperately sick child, but to directly mention the child and describe that situation would have been to court pathos. Such a poem would have been fit only for greeting cards or the poor souls who didn&#x27;t know any better than to like Robert Service.

Of course you can&#x27;t figure it out by studying the text. The clues aren&#x27;t there. This poem was meant to be appreciated only by a chosen literary elite, only by those who were educated, those who had learned the back story (Williams was a doctor, and he wrote the poem one morning after having treated a child who was near death. The red wheelbarrow was her toy.) 

Orrick Johns&#x27; &quot;Blue Under-Shirts Upon a Line&quot;—first published in &quot;&quot; in 1915—may have provided the framework upon which Williams developed &quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot;. In his 2010 essay in &quot;College Literature&quot;, Mark Hama &quot;proposes that what Williams likely recognized in his friend Johns’s poem was the framework for a new modern American poetic line.&quot;

==Critical reception==
The poet John Hollander cited &quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot; as a good example of enjambment to slow down the reader, creating a &quot;meditative&quot; poem.

The editors of &quot;Exploring Poetry&quot; believe that the meaning of the poem and its form are intimately bound together. They state that &quot;since the poem is composed of one sentence broken up at various intervals, it is truthful to say that &#x27;so much depends upon&#x27; each line of the poem. This is so because the form of the poem is also its meaning.&quot; This viewpoint is also argued by Henry M. Sayre who compared the poem to the readymade artwork of Marcel Duchamp.

Peter Baker analyzed the poem in terms of theme, writing that &quot;Williams is saying that perception is necessary to life and that the poem itself can lead to a fuller understanding of one&#x27;s experience.&quot;

Kenneth Lincoln saw humor in the poem, writing &quot;perhaps it adds up to no more than a small comic lesson in the necessity of things in themselves.&quot;

<text>The black-faced antthrush (Formicarius analis) is a species of passerine bird in the family Formicariidae. It is found in Central America from Honduras through Panama, on Trinidad, and in every mainland South American country except Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The black-faced antthrush was formally described in 1837 by the French naturalists Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny and Frédéric de Lafresnaye from a specimen collected in Bolivia. They coined the binomial name &quot;Myothera analis&quot;. The specific epithet is from the Modern Latin &quot;analis&quot; meaning &quot;relating to the undertail-coverts of the vent&quot;. In 1858 it was moved to genus &quot;Formicarius&quot; that had been introduced by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783.

The black-faced antthrush has these 11 subspecies:

* &quot;F. a. umbrosus&quot; 
* &quot;F. a. hoffmanni&quot; 
* &quot;F. a. panamensis&quot; 
* &quot;F. a. virescens&quot; 
* &quot;F. a. saturatus&quot; 
* &quot;F. a. griseoventris&quot; 
* &quot;F. a. connectens&quot; 
* &quot;F. a. zamorae&quot; 
* &quot;F. a. crissalis&quot; 
* &quot;F. a. analis&quot; 
* &quot;F. a. paraensis&quot; 

The first five subspecies on the above list are treated by some taxonomists as the &quot;Central American&quot; group of black-faced anthrushes and the other six as the &quot;black-faced&quot; or &quot;analis&quot; group. Others treat only the first three as the &quot;&quot;hoffmanni&quot; group&quot; and are unsure whether &quot;virescens&quot; and &quot;saturatus&quot; belong with them or with the &quot;black-faced&quot; group. The two groups, however populated, might represent separate species.

What is now the Mayan antthrush (&quot;Formicarius moniliger&quot;), with three subspecies, was formerly considered conspecific with the black-faced antthrush. By 2021 major taxonomic systems had adopted the split.

==Description==

The black-faced antthrush is long and weighs about . The sexes have the same plumage. Adults of the nominate subspecies &quot;F. a. analis&quot; have a dusky brown crown. They have a small white spot on their lores and bare bluish skin around their eye. Their face from their bill to their eye is black that extends down to include the chin and throat. The rest of their face, their nape, back, and rump are brown. Their flight feathers are brown with dusky inner edges and a wide cinnamon band at the base; their wing coverts are brown with a rufescent tinge. Their tail is blackish brown. Their upper breast is dark gray and most of the rest of their underparts are a lighter gray that is lightest in the center of their belly. Their flanks have a brown wash and their undertail coverts are rufous. They have a dark brown iris, a black bill, and gray to bluish legs and feet.

The other subspecies of the black-faced antthrush differ from the nominate and each other thus:

* &quot;F. a. umbrosus&quot;: like the nominate but with brownish undertail coverts
* &quot;F. a. hoffmanni&quot;: pale rufescent or cinnamon crown, little or no white lores spot, and dark cinnamon wash on undertail coverts
* &quot;F. a. panamensis&quot;: pale rufescent or cinnamon crown, little or no white lores spot, olive-tinged brownish breast, and tawny undertail coverts
* &quot;F. a. virescens&quot;: pale rufescent or cinnamon crown, little or no white lores spot, olivaceous mantle, olive-tinged brownish breast, and tawny undertail coverts
* &quot;F. a. saturatus&quot;: pale rufescent or cinnamon crown, little or no white lores spot, cinnamon edge on throat, rufescent-brown mantle, brownish gray breast, and tawny-rusty undertail coverts
* &quot;F. a. griseoventris&quot;: pale rufescent or cinnamon crown, little or no white lores spot, and olivaceous mantle, gray breast, and tawny undertail coverts
* &quot;F. a. connectens&quot;: pale rufescent or cinnamon crown, little or no white lores spot, olivaceous mantle, slate-gray breast, and tawny-rusty undertail coverts
* &quot;F. a. zamorae&quot;: pale rufescent or cinnamon crown, little or no white lores spot, olivaceous mantle, slate-gray breast, sooty slate vent area, and rich chestnut undertail coverts
* &quot;F. a. crissalis&quot;: pale rufescent or cinnamon crown, prominent lores spot, vinaceous-rust ear coverts, cinnamon edge on throat, rufescent-brown mantle, brownish rump and uppertail coverts, brownish gray breast, whitish vent area, and tawny undertail coverts
* &quot;F. a. paraensis&quot;: pale rufescent or cinnamon crown, prominent lores spot, vinaceous ear coverts, cinnamon edge on throat, olive-tinged rufescent-brown mantle, ferruginous rump and uppertail coverts, brownish gray breast, whitish vent area, and tawny undertail coverts

==Distribution and habitat==

The black-faced antthrush has a disjunct distribution, with a large gap north of the Amazon in northestern Brazil, southern Venezuela, and eastern Colombia. The subspecies are found thus:

* &quot;F. a. umbrosus&quot;: Caribbean slope from eastern Honduras through Nicaragua and Costa Rica into western Panama
* &quot;F. a. hoffmanni&quot;: Pacific slope from central Costa Rica to southwestern Panama
* &quot;F. a. panamensis&quot;: from eastern Panama&#x27;s Darién Province into northwestern Colombia
* &quot;F. a. virescens&quot;: Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northeastern Colombia
* &quot;F. a. saturatus&quot;: Colombia&#x27;s Magdalena River Valley, northwestern Venezuela north of the Orinoco River, and Trinidad
* &quot;F. a. griseoventris&quot;: Serranía del Perijá and nearby on the northeastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela border
* &quot;F. a. connectens&quot;: east of the Andes in eastern Colombia
* &quot;F. a. zamorae&quot;: eastern Ecuador, northern Peru, and northwestern Brazil
* &quot;F. a. crissalis&quot;: on the Guianan Shield from eastern Venezuela&#x27;s Bolívar state east through the Guianas into northeastern Brazil north of the Amazon
* &quot;F. a. analis&quot;: Amazon Basin of eastern and southeastern Peru, northern Bolivia, and central Brazil
* &quot;F. a. paraensis&quot;: southeastern Amazonian Brazil

The black-faced antthrush inhabits primary forest and mature secondary forest, primarily &quot;várzea&quot; and transitional forest and to a much smaller extent &quot;terra firme&quot;. In parts of Brazil it is associated with bamboo. In elevation it reaches to in eastern Costa Rica, to in western Costa Rica, to in Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil, to in Peru, and in Venezuela to south of the Orinoco and north of it.

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The black-faced antthrush is a year-round resident throughout its range.

===Feeding===

The black-faced antthrush feeds primarily on a variety of arthropods and also includes small vertebrates such as frogs and lizards in its diet. It is almost entirely terrestrial. It walks slowly and deliberately with its tail cocked like a little rail, sweeping or flicking aside leaf litter with its bill, and often moves in circles. It very rarely deviates from this behavior by leaping into the air to capture fleeing prey. It often but not regularly attends army ant swarms to capture prey fleeing the ants.

===Breeding===

The black-faced antthrush&#x27;s breeding season has not been fully defined, but is known to span March to October in Costa Rica and to include November in Amazonian Brazil. It does not build a conventional nest but makes a platform of dead leaves and flowers at the bottom of a tree or stump cavity. Many cavities have an open top. The cavities have been noted between above the ground. The clutch size is two white eggs. The incubation period is 17 to 20 days and fledging occurs 17 to 20 days after hatch. Both parents incubate the clutch during the day and probably the female alone at night. Both parents provision nestlings.
===Vocalization===

The three subspecies of the black-faced antthrush&#x27;s &quot;hoffmanni&quot; group sing &quot;an emphatic flat-pitched introductory whistle at ca. 2.0 kHz, followed by a slow series of 1–4 similar but slightly lower-pitched whistles (the latter maintaining about the same pitch). It has also been described as &quot;a labored &quot;pyee, pyew, pyew&quot;; the first note (accented and higher) is usually followed by two or three notes, but sometimes as many as ten or more&quot;. The song of members of the &quot;analis&quot; group &quot;begins with an emphatic flat-pitched introductory whistle at ca. 2.0 kHz followed by a fast series of typically 8–15 shorter whistles in a sputtering, mainly falling trill&quot;. It has been written as &quot;tüüü, ti-ti-tí-tí-tí-te-te-tu-tu-tu-tu&quot;. All of the subspecies apparently give an &quot;emphatic short &quot;tleet!&quot;&quot; call.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the black-faced antthrush as being of Least Concern. It has a very large range; its population size is not known and is believed to be decreasing. No immediate threats have been identified. It is considered common in Costa Rica, Peru, and Venezuela, fairly common in Colombia, and &quot;widespread and numerous&quot; in Ecuador. &quot;The species will recolonize forest patches a short time after isolation if there is some habitat connectivity [but] is reported to be sensitive to logging activities and associated habitat alteration, and to oil exploration&quot;.

<text>Violence has been a part of ice hockey since at least the early 1900s. According to the book &quot;&quot;, in 1904 alone, four players were killed during hockey games from the frequent brawls and violent stickwork.

More modern examples of violence include brawls, bench-clearing brawls, fighting, fan involvement, physical abuse of officials and deliberately injuring opponents. Violent actions such as kicking, hitting from behind and prohibited stickwork, are penalized with suspensions or fines. Fighting, or fisticuffs, is also penalized but is considered by many hockey enthusiasts, particularly in North America, to be quite distinct from stick-swinging or other violent acts. They regard fighting as an entrenched, acceptable and integral part of the game.

On the ice, referees may impose penalties for prohibited activities. Off the ice, the National Hockey League (NHL) sometimes fines, suspends or expels players. The criminal justice system has also occasionally charged and convicted players. As a result, hockey has become much more regulated and the violent element much more controlled. This has been aided, in no small part, by dramatic increases in disciplinary processes and technology allowing for a high level of scrutiny of any event which occurs.

==History==
Early hockey in particular was noted for its extreme violence, to the point where two players were killed in three years during brawls. In both cases, the accused assailants were acquitted, but these and other bloody incidents led to calls for the sport to clean up its act or be banned along with the likes of cockfighting. The worst of the violence waned, particularly with the advent of regulations for quasi-legal fisticuffs, though incidents continue to occur from time to time.

Cully Wilson, right winger with the Seattle Metropolitans, slashed Vancouver Millionaires center Mickey MacKay over the mouth during the 1919 PCHA season. MacKay suffered a fractured jaw and missed the rest of the season. When the season was over PCHA chief disciplinarian Frank Patrick banned Wilson from the league, and Wilson never played in the PCHA again.

Billy Coutu was the first, and to date only, player banned from the NHL for life for violence in 1927; he assaulted referee Jerry Laflamme and tackled referee Billy Bell before starting a bench-clearing brawl during a Stanley Cup game between the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators, apparently on the orders of Bruins Head Coach Art Ross. The NHL&#x27;s first president, Frank Calder, expelled Coutu from the NHL for life; the ban was lifted after two-and-a-half years, but Coutu never played in the NHL again.

Other incidents include the December 12, 1933, event when Eddie Shore rammed Toronto Maple Leafs star Ace Bailey from behind, causing Bailey to strike his head on the ice; Bailey never played hockey again. More recently, controversy and criminal charges have resulted from violent attacks by Marty McSorley, Todd Bertuzzi and Chris Simon.

Players who are banned in the American Hockey League (AHL) for violence are not permitted in the ECHL, and vice versa, because of their agreements with the Professional Hockey Players&#x27; Association.

In January 2012, David Johnston, the Governor General of Canada, said that violence such as headshots, high-sticking and fighting should not be part of the sport.

==Reports investigating violence==
There have been two major Canadian reports on violence in hockey. In 1974, William McMurtry provided a report for the Government of Ontario entitled &quot;Investigation and Inquiry into Violence in Amateur Hockey&quot;. In 2000, Bernie Pascall prepared a report for the Government of British Columbia entitled &quot;Eliminating Violence in Hockey&quot;.

==On-ice incidents resulting in charges==

*1905 – Allan Loney was charged with manslaughter in the on-ice clubbing death of Alcide Laurin. Loney claimed self-defence, and was found not guilty.
*1907 – Ottawa Hockey Club players Harry Smith, Alf Smith and Charles Spittal were charged with assault after beating Montreal Wanderers players Hod Stuart, Ernie &quot;Moose&quot; Johnson and Cecil Blachford with their sticks. Harry Smith was acquitted while Spittal and Alf Smith were each fined $20.
*1907 – Ottawa Victorias player Charles Masson was charged with manslaughter after Cornwall player Owen McCourt died of a head wound sustained in a brawl. Masson was found not guilty on the grounds that there was no way to know which blow had killed McCourt.
*1908 – Charles Spittal (of Renfrew Riversides) arrested for knocking out Oren Frood of Pembroke (UOVHL) on January 17, 1908. Charge was withdrawn on January 20, 1908.
*1910 – Rusty Crawford, while a member of the Prince Albert Mintos, assaulted Reginald Brehaut of the Saskatoon Strathconas in a game in Saskatoon on January 11, 1910. Crawford was later found guilty of assault on January 19 in a Saskatoon city police court and fined $5 and costs.
*1912 – Edgar Dey was fined $50 by Halifax magistrate&#x27;s court in Nova Scotia for assaulting Patsy Séguin in a January 5 MPHL game between the Halifax Socials and Halifax Crescents. Dey himself died the following month on February 13 from chest injuries thought to stem partly from his tussle with Séguin.
*1912 – Sprague Cleghorn of the Montreal Wanderers pleaded guilty in a Toronto court of assaulting Newsy Lalonde of the Montreal Canadiens with his stick in a pre-season exhibition game at the Arena Gardens in Toronto on December 21, 1912. Cleghorn was fined $50 by Judge Morgan on December 28. 
*1915 – A riot broke out at the end of a game on January 2, 1915 between Ottawa College and the Cleveland Athletic Club at the Elysium Arena in Cleveland, and Ottawa College goaltender Vincent Doran was arrested on a charge for assaulting Cleveland player Elmer Irving. Irving refused to prosecute and the case was dropped in a Cleveland police court on January 4.
*1915 – Roy McGiffin of the Toronto Blueshirts and Art Ross of the Ottawa Senators were involved in a fist fight with each other in a NHA game between the two clubs on February 17, 1915 which had both players arrested. They were released on $100 bail each, and later appeared in court where they were fined $1 and costs. McGiffin and Ross tossed a coin to determine who would pay the $8 bill, with McGiffin ending up paying for both.
*1916 – Skene Ronan of the Montreal Canadiens assaulted Alf Skinner of the Toronto Blueshirts in a NHA game between the two clubs on January 22, 1916 which had him arrested by police and taken to the Agnes Street station in Toronto, although he was later released on $200 bail. The incident went to trial and Ronan was acquitted of the charge on January 31 before Judge Winchester in Toronto, with Canadiens manager George Kennedy acting as a witness for the defense.
*1918 – Joe Hall of the Montreal Canadiens and Alf Skinner of the Toronto Arenas were both arrested after an NHL game on January 28, 1918 after they had hit each other violently with their sticks. Hall and Skinner appeared in a Toronto court together on January 29 and both were released after being handed a suspended sentence. 
*1922 – Sprague Cleghorn of the Montreal Canadiens injured three Ottawa Senators players (Frank Nighbor, Eddie Gerard and Cy Denneny) in a game on February 1, leading Ottawa police to offer to arrest him.
*1969 – In a pre-season game held in Ottawa, Ted Green of the Boston Bruins and Wayne Maki of the St. Louis Blues engaged in a violent, stick-swinging brawl. A fractured skull and brain damage caused Green to miss the entire 1969–70 season. The NHL suspended Maki for 30 days and Green for 13 games. Both men were acquitted in court.
*1972 – St. Louis Blues head coach Al Arbour and players John Arbour, Phil Roberto, and Floyd Thomson were charged with disorderly conduct and assault and battery on police officers following a brawl with fans and the police during a game against the Philadelphia Flyers. All charges were later dropped.
*1975 – Dan Maloney of the Detroit Red Wings was charged with assault causing bodily harm after he attacked Brian Glennie of the Toronto Maple Leafs from behind. In exchange for a no-contest plea, Maloney did community service work and was banned from playing in Toronto for two seasons. Ironically, after he served his ban, he joined the Maple Leafs as a player and coached for them after his playing career was over.
*1975 – Police charged Boston Bruins player Dave Forbes with aggravated assault after a fight with Henry Boucha of the Minnesota North Stars. After a nine-day trial ended with a hung jury, charges against Forbes were dropped. Boucha suffered blurred vision from the incident and never fully recovered. 
*1976 – Philadelphia Flyers players Joe Watson, Mel Bridgman, Don Saleski and Bob &quot;Hound&quot; Kelly were charged with assault after using their hockey sticks as weapons in a violent playoff game between the Flyers and the Toronto Maple Leafs in which fans had been taunting the Flyers players and spitting at them. Bridgman was acquitted, but the other three Flyers were found guilty of simple assault.
*1976 – Calgary Cowboys forward Rick Jodzio plead guilty to a charge of assault following a cross-check to the head of Quebec Nordiques player Marc Tardif during the World Hockey Association (WHA) playoffs. The hit led to a 20-minute bench-clearing brawl.
*1977 – Dave &quot;Tiger&quot; Williams of the Toronto Maple Leafs hit the Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; Dennis Owchar with his stick. He was charged with assault, but acquitted.
*1980 – Jimmy Mann of the Winnipeg Jets left the bench and sucker-punched Pittsburgh Penguin Paul Gardner, breaking Gardner&#x27;s jaw in two places. Mann was fined $500 and given a suspended sentence in Winnipeg.
*1988 – Dino Ciccarelli hit Maple Leafs defenceman Luke Richardson with his stick. Charged and convicted of assault, he was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $1,000.
*1992 – Enrico Ciccone of the IHL&#x27;s Kalamazoo Wings was arrested on a battery charge after San Diego Gulls photographer Essy Ghavameddini was cut and received a deep bruise below his left eye that required stitches. Ciccone assaulted him after entering the penalty box from where Ghavameddini was photographing the game.
*1998 – Jesse Boulerice of the Plymouth Whalers was suspended for the rest of the playoffs after violently swinging his stick at Guelph Storm forward Andrew Long. Boulerice was charged with assault as a result of the incident.
*1999 – Dean Trboyevich of the Anchorage Aces (West Coast Hockey League) cross-checked Jacques Mailhot of the Fresno Falcons in the face and was arrested at his hotel after the game, and was later released on a $20,000 bail.
*2000 – Marty McSorley of the Boston Bruins hit Vancouver Canucks player Donald Brashear in the head with his stick in the waning moments of the game, after losing a fight to Brashear earlier in the game. McSorley was convicted of assault with a weapon and given an 18-month conditional discharge.
*2004 – In the Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident, Bertuzzi of the Vancouver Canucks sucker-punched Moore of the Colorado Avalanche in the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. The pair then fell to the ice with Bertuzzi&#x27;s weight crushing Moore face-first into the ice, followed by several players from both teams further piling onto the mêlée. Moore sustained three fractured vertebrae, a grade three concussion, vertebral ligament damage, stretching of the brachial plexus nerves and facial lacerations. Bertuzzi was charged by police and given a conditional discharge after pleading guilty to assault causing bodily harm. His suspension resulted in a loss of $500,000 in pay and the Canucks were fined $250,000. Bertuzzi was re-instated in 2005, after a 20 game suspension and an international ban during the 2004-05 lockout season. A civil suit filed by Moore, seeking CAD$68 million in damages and loss of income, was settled on August 19, 2014. The terms of this settlement are confidential.
*2015 – During the warm up before a qualifier to the SHL, André Deveaux from Rögle BK assaulted Västerås IK&#x27;s unsuspecting Per Helmersson. Deveaux swung his stick and slashed Helmersson twice. The attack was retaliation for a hit from behind by Helmersson in the game before, which Deveaux claimed caused him a minor concussion. Both players could complete both games, and Deveaux was only disciplined after the game. Deveaux was charged for the attack, but the charges were later dropped.
*2015 – During an Allsvenskan (Sweden&#x27;s second tier league) game on March 5, 2015 Rögle BK forward Jakob Lilja cross-checked Malmö Redhawks defenceman Jens Olsson from behind in the neck area. Lilja received a 10-game suspension, with four of the games converted into a monetary fine as per custom. Over three years later, on July 10, 2018 the Supreme Court of Sweden, after the case had first gone through the lower District Court of Malmö, handed Lilja a one-month probation sentence while removing the earlier imposed monetary fine because Lilja had already been imposed a fine by the ice hockey Disciplinary Committee.
*2023 - Adam Johnson of the Nottingham Panthers in the Elite Ice Hockey League died on October 28 as a result of skate slash to his neck by Matt Petgrave during a game. Petgrave was later arrested on suspicion of manslaughter on November 14, and released on bail. The incident renewed a debate about the safety of the sport and the International Ice Hockey Federation and multiple national associations made neck guards mandatory to be worn at all levels.

<doc id="836488" wikidata="Q2575292" url="?curid=836488" title="Aikoku Kōtō">
<text>The  was a political party in Meiji-period Japan.

The &quot;Aikoku Kōtō&quot; was formed on 12 January 1874 by Itagaki Taisuke, Etō Shinpei, Gotō Shōjirō and others as part of the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement. Its purpose was to petition the Meiji government to establish a national assembly and on 17 January submitted to the government a &quot;Written Proposal for the Establishment of a House of Representatives&quot;.

The Aikoku Kōto stood on the theory of innate human rights, criticized the tyrannical government, and advocated the creation of a government in which the emperor and subjects were one (kunmin ittai). To this end, they also advocated that the commoners, including samurai, wealthy farmers, and wealthy merchants, be given the right to participate in government and that a Diet be established.

Fearing arrest after the failed Saga Rebellion, Itagaki disbanded it soon after its foundation in 1875.

However, Itagaki, Ueki Emori and others revived the party on May 5, 1890 in response to the situation after the split in the Daidōdan movement, who wanted to rally the former Liberal Party members to the Aikoku Kōtō (Patriotic Public Party). On May 14, the three factions decided to join together to form the Gung Tora Club, and on August 4, the Aikoku Kōtō was dissolved, and the four factions, including the Kyushu Dōshikai, joined together to form the Rikken Jiyū-to (Constitutional Liberal Party) on September 15.

The Aikoku Kōtō can be regarded as the first political party in Japan. It should not be confused with the Aikokusha movement or with later ultranationalist movements with similar names.

<doc id="836500" wikidata="Q237002" url="?curid=836500" title="Ana Guevara">
<text>Ana Gabriela Guevara Espinoza (born March 4, 1977) is a Mexican former track and field athlete who specialized in the 400 meters and is the 7th fastest female 300-meter runner in the world, running 300 meters in 35.3 seconds on May 3, 2003. She served as a Mexican Senator for the 2012–2018 term.

==Early life==
Guevara was born in Nogales, Sonora. Her parents are Cesar Octavio Guevara and Ana María Espinoza. She has four siblings: Azalia, César, Daniela, and Jaime.

==Athletic career==
Ana&#x27;s career began in 1996 when she started participating in her first international competition. In 1998, she won two silver medals in the Central American and Caribbean Games in the 400 and 800 meters.

Her first major victory was the gold medal in the 400 meters at the 1999 Pan American Games in Canada. A year later, she qualified to the 2000 Sydney Olympics going to the 400 meters finals, finishing with a reasonable 5th place with a time of 49.96 seconds. After that race, she won 28 consecutive international races before a second-place finish in Rome in July 2004.

In 2001, she won the 400-meter race at the Herculis in Monaco, one of the two 400-meter events held at Golden League competitions that year. At the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, Guevara made the finals in the 400 m. She came off the last turn leading the race with about 105 meters to go. Unfortunately, she could not keep the fast pace and was passed by Amy Mbacké Thiam from Senegal and Lorraine Fenton from Jamaica with no more than 20 meters to go. Guevara won the bronze medal posting a season-best with a time of 49.97 seconds. In fact, Fenton and Mbacke Thiam also posted personal bests, the last one also being a national record.

In 2002, she won all seven competitions of 400 m of the Golden League (Oslo, Paris, Rome, Monaco, Zürich, Brussels and Berlin) sharing the jackpot of one million dollars in gold bars with three athletes. She also won the gold medal at the 2002 IAAF World Cup in 400 m and 400 m relay, running for the Americas team. She won the 2002 IAAF Grand Prix Final in Paris.

In 2003, she defended her title in the 400 m at the 2003 Pan American Games winning the gold medal. She won the 400-meter race at the Weltklasse Zürich, one of the two 400 m events held at Golden League competitions that year. Later, on August 27, 2003, in Paris, France, she won the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in the women&#x27;s 400 meters. She set a personal record, a national record, and a world-leading time, finishing in 48.89 seconds. She won the 400 m at the 2003 IAAF World Athletics Final in Monaco.

Guevara made her second Olympic appearance in 2004 as the flag carrier for the Mexican delegation and represented her country in the 400 m. After winning her heat in the first round, and her corresponding semi-final, she would go on to win the silver medal in the final. This was Mexico&#x27;s first Olympic medal in athletics outside of race walking. She won the 400 m at the 2004 IAAF World Athletics Final in Monaco.

A year later, at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics, she won the bronze medal in the 400 meters with a time of 49.81 seconds, despite the heavy rainfall that occurred during the event.

In 2007, for the third consecutive time, she won the gold medal in the 400 m at the 2007 Pan American Games. In addition, she led Mexico&#x27;s 4 × 400 m relay team to a second-place finish. About a month later, at the age of 30, Guevara participated in her fourth World Championships in Athletics in Osaka, Japan. She finished in fourth place with a season-best time of 50.16 seconds, just 0.01 seconds ahead of 24-year-old DeeDee Trotter of the United States.

On January 16, 2008, she announced her retirement from all competitions due to conflicts with Mariano Lara, the then president of the Mexican Athletics Federation. No help was received at that time from Carlos Hermosillo, director of the CONADE (Comision Nacional de Cultura Fisica y Deporte), who did not act rapidly and the problem only grew bigger and continued for months. Ana finally said, &quot;My retirement from sport in Mexico is now definitive, I contemplated the possibility of participating independently at the Olympic Games, but my dream was to participate for my country.&quot;

== Political career ==
In 2009, Guevara entered politics. She stood as the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) candidate for the borough of Miguel Hidalgo in Mexico City but ultimately lost to Demetrio Sodi from the National Action Party (PAN). 

In the 2012 general election she won a seat in the Senate on a ticket comprising the PRD, the Labor Party (PT), and the Citizens&#x27; Movement party. At the end of her Senate term, she won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies in the 2018 general election, representing Sonora&#x27;s second district for the PT.

On December 13, 2016, near Mexico City, Guevara was struck by a car while riding her motorcycle and was then physically beaten by the four men who were in the car. News outlets created a national outrage over this incident.

== Allegations of corruption ==
In May 2020, Guevara, while serving as president of CONADE under Andrés Manuel López Obrador&#x27;s presidency, was accused by the Superior Auditor of the Federation for allegedly requesting bribes in exchange for contracts to supply food for athletes and trainers from August 2019 to December 2019.

In February 2024, the Attorney General of Mexico reportedly opened two investigations into Guevara. 

In October of 2024, president Claudia Sheinbaum replaced Guevara&#x27;s position as the president of CONADE with politician and ex diver Rommel Pacheco.

<text>And Then... is the fifth studio album by American recording artist Joe. It was released through Jive Records on December 2, 2003, in the United States. A breakaway from his previous album &quot;Better Days&quot; (2001), the album saw Joe consulting a wider range of collaborators, including labelmate R. Kelly as well as Frank Romano, Roy &quot;Royalty&quot; Hamilton, L.E.S., Kevin &quot;Shekspere&quot; Briggs, Dre &amp; Vidal, Carvin &amp; Ivan and The Underdogs. Rap group G-Unit and rapper Freeway appear as guest vocalists on the album.

The album earned generally lukewarm reviews from music critics who called it solid if not overly exceptional. It debuted and peaked number 26 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 121,000 copies in its first week of release, and was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;And Then...&quot; produced two singles, including US lead single &quot;More &amp; More&quot; and international lead single &quot;Ride wit U&quot; the latter of which reached the top 20 on the UK Singles Chart.

== Background ==
&quot;And Then...&quot; is an album that focuses on ballads. Joe states on his web site that he prefers singing ballads to up-tempo tracks. &quot;I prefer to sing on ballads rather than up-tempos. You kind of showcase yourself as an r&amp;b singer a lot better.&quot; The album also features a number of collaborations with prominent r&amp;b writers and producers. Joe worked with labelmate R. Kelly on the lead single &quot;More &amp; More&quot; and &quot;Make You My Baby&quot;, these two songs were originally intended for R. Kelly&#x27;s unreleased album &quot;Loveland&quot;. Roy &quot;Royalty&quot; Hamilton worked with Joe on the title track, as well as &quot;Sweeter than Sugar&quot; and &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;. Songwriter Kevin &quot;Shekspere&quot; Briggs wrote the song &quot;Bedroom&quot; that appears late on the album. G-Unit appears on the track &quot;Ride wit U&quot;. Produced by Frank Romano, which is one of the up-tempo tracks on the album — Joe returned the favour on their debut album.

== Promotion ==
&quot;More &amp; More,&quot; written and produced by label mate R. Kelly, was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in the United States. It peaked at number 48 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached number 15 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Elsewhere, the song was released on double A-single with &quot;Ride wit U&quot; featuring rap group G-Unit. It peaked at number 22 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and also reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart and the top forty of the Australian Singles Chart, becoming his highest-charting single release since 2000&#x27;s &quot;Stutter&quot;. Third single &quot;Priceless,&quot; produced by The Underdogs, reached number 72 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

== Critical reception ==
Upon release, &quot;And Then...&quot; received generally lukewarm reviews from music critics. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Jon Pareles found that &quot;with his light but precise tenor voice, Joe applies bends and quavers to every note that can withstand them, and like Mr. Kelly, he can sound oddly mournful as he&#x27;s proclaiming his undying love and happiness. The production stays understated, mostly using down-tempo drum machines and sleek keyboards. Joe&#x27;s ambitions don&#x27;t extend far beyond the bedroom (and the garage that holds all the cars he mentions). He&#x27;s not a utopian yearner like Musiq Soulchild, just a guy on the make. But his limited ambitions are easier to achieve.&quot;

AllMusic wrote that &quot;Joe maintains his steady recording output with &quot;And Then...&quot;, another in a line of his generally solid if not overly exceptional albums highlighted by a couple standout cuts [...] Here he&#x27;s in really good hands, especially on the aforementioned Kelly and Hamilton songs, which rank among the very best of his career. They rated the album three and a half stars out of five. &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote: &quot;Enlisting Kelly and other guest producers, Joe undercuts the consistency critique leveled at last year&#x27;s &quot;Better Days&quot;. There are still a few formulaic and trite bumps along the way [...] Those missteps are outpaced by several noteworthy tracks.&quot; Dennis Kelly from &quot;The Morning Call&quot; found that &quot;after his biggest album, 2000&#x27;s &quot;My Name Is Joe&quot;, he seemed to lose his way a bit on the followup, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Better Days&quot;. Now with &quot;And Then…&quot; [...] he&#x27;s back to his slow jam ways [...] that best suit Joe&#x27;s soft, sentimental delivery, which should suit his fans just fine.&quot;

== Commercial success ==
&quot;And Then...&quot; debuted at number 26 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number four on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, selling 121,000 copies during which what &quot;Billboard&quot; described as &quot;a busy holiday retail season.&quot; It was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on September 23, 2004. Outside the United States, the album reached the top thirty on the Dutch MegaCharts. In the United Kingdom, &quot;And Then...&quot; reached number 73 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on July 22, 2013.

<text>Peredur (, Old Welsh &quot;Peretur&quot;) is the name of a number of men from the boundaries of history and legend in sub-Roman Britain. The Peredur who is most familiar to a modern audience is the character who made his entrance as a knight in the Arthurian world of Middle Welsh prose literature.

==Gwrgi and Peredur, sons of Eliffer==
Gwrgi and Peredur are listed as sons of Eliffer (Old Welsh: &quot;Elidir&quot; or &quot;Eleuther&quot;) &quot;of the great warband&quot; (&quot;cascord maur&quot;) and as sons of the Coeling dynasty in the Harleian genealogies, making them first cousins of Urien. Likewise, a pedigree from Jesus College MS 20 includes Gwrgi and Peredur as brothers together with one Arthur &quot;penuchel&quot;. Their principal claim to fame rests on their having fought in the Battle of Arfderydd. The &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; report that this battle (&quot;bellum Armterid&quot;) was fought in 573, but gives no further detail. A later expansion of the entry names Gwrgi and Peredur, both described as sons of Eliffer, as the chieftains on the victorious side and tells that Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio was defeated and slain in the battle. Under the year 580, the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; record the deaths of Gwrgi (&quot;Guurci&quot;) and his brother Peredur (&quot;Peretur&quot;). These references give them a place as heroes in the Hen Ogledd of the late 6th century.

Further detail is supplied in later legendary traditions, notably those represented by the Welsh Triads (&quot;Trioedd Ynys Prydein&quot;). One listing the three &quot;Horse-Burdens&quot; of Britain relates that Gwrgi, Peredur, Dynod Bwr and Cynfelyn Drwsgl were carried by a horse called Corvan, which enabled them to watch the clouds of dust (&quot;battle-fog&quot;) coming from Gwenddoleu and his (mounted) forces in the battle of Arfderydd. The circumstances in which Gwrgi and Peredur died are alluded to in a Triad which explains that they had one of &quot;Three Faithless Warbands of the Island of Britain&quot;. Their warband abandoned them at Caer Greu on the day before a battle with Eda &quot;Glinmaur&quot; (&quot;Great-Knee&quot;) and so they were slain. The Welsh Triads also refer to family relations. One on the &quot;Three Fair Womb-Burdens&quot; of Britain, preserved incompletely in Peniarth MS 47, suggests that Peredur and Gwrgi had a sister called Arddun, while a variant version in Peniarth MS 50 calls the third sibling Ceindrech Pen Asgell (&quot;Wing-head&quot;) and names the mother Efrddyl verch Gynfarch. Peredur is said to have had a son by the name of Gwgon Gwron, called one of the three &quot;Prostrate Chieftains&quot; (&quot;Lledyf Vnben&quot;) because &quot;they would not seek a dominion, which nobody could deny to them&quot;.

Still further allusions are found in early Welsh poetry. The poem &quot;Ymddiddan Myrddin a Thaliesin&quot;, which assumes the form of a dialogue between Myrddin Wyllt (the prototype of Merlin) and the poet Taliesin, deals out praise to the brave &quot;sons of Eliffer&quot;, saying that they did not avoid spears in the heat of battle. The apparent context is the battle of Arfderydd, where Myrddin fought as one of Gwenddoleu&#x27;s warriors, went mad from terror and in this way, acquired the gift of prophecy (see also &quot;Vita Merlini&quot; below). For some unknown reason, however, the poem extends the number of sons to seven. A warrior called Peredur is also listed in one of the younger sections of &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; (&quot;awdl&quot; A.31), which shows him as one of the heroes to have died fighting in battle as a member of the warband of Mynyddog Mwynfawr, chieftain of the Gododdin in &quot;the Old North&quot;. It has been argued that Peredur&#x27;s appearance here may have been due to a tendency in the growth of the poem to draw personages known from such sources as the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; into the orbit of its subject matter, assuming he is the same Peredur.

==Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s Peredurus==
Geoffrey of Monmouth, the author of the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, mentions a Peredur in his &quot;Vita Merlini&quot; (&quot;The Life of Merlin&quot;), an account of Merlin drawing heavily on narrative traditions about Myrddin Wyllt. In an early episode based clearly on the story of the Battle of Arfderydd, Peredur (&quot;Peredurus&quot;) is joined by his allies Merlin, king of the South Welsh, and Rhydderch Hael, king of the Cumbrians, when he engages Gwenddoleu (&quot;Guennolus&quot;), king of Scotland, in a battle at an unnamed site. Merlin loses three brothers and driven mad from grief, takes refuge in the woods. Peredur is here presented as prince of the North Welsh (&quot;dux Venedotorum&quot;) rather than a ruler in the British North.

In his earlier and more famous work, &quot;Historia regum Britanniae&quot;, Geoffrey of Monmouth also used the name &quot;Peredurus&quot; for a legendary ruler of Britain who was the fifth and youngest son born to the legendary Morvidus, king of the Britons. He is said to have conspired with his brother Ingenius to capture and oust their brother Elidurus, locking him up in Trinovantum. When the brothers divided the kingdom between them, Peredur became ruler over the part north of the Humber, including &#x27;Albany&#x27; (Scotland), and following Elidurus&#x27; death, succeeded to the entire kingdom. In the same work, Geoffrey also includes one Peredur map Peridur among the leading magnates of the realm who attended King Arthur&#x27;s plenary Court in the City of the Legion.

==Peredur son of Efrawg (Middle Welsh Arthurian romance)==

A Peredur is also the hero of the Welsh romance &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot;, where he claims the role performed by the Arthurian knight Percival in the works of Chrétien de Troyes and other non-Welsh sources.

==Other==
In the &quot;Englynion y Beddau&quot;, another Peredur, called Peredur of Penweddig (a cantref of Ceredigion), occurs as the father of the legendary hero Môr.

In the syndicated U.S. comic strip &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, Sir Peredur The Rover is a notorious mercenary knight who is hired to fight Gawain in a contest of champions in a March 2021 story line.

Peredur appears as a mythic archetype in Robert Holdstock&#x27;s novel &quot;Mythago Wood&quot;.

<doc id="836535" wikidata="Q4837127" url="?curid=836535" title="Baal-perazim">
<text>Ba&#x27;al-Perazim (Hebrew &quot;Owner of Breakings Through&quot;) was a place in ancient Israel.

It was the scene of a victory gained by David over the Philistines (2 Samuel 5:20; 1 Chronicles 14:11). It is called Mount Perazim in Isaiah 28:21. It was near the Valley of Rephaim, west of Jerusalem. 

Some scholars suggest a site 4 km northwest of Jerusalem, named Sheikh Bodr, to be identical with Ba&#x27;al-Perazim.

There is also a valley near Mount Sodom in the Judaean Desert, called &quot;Wadi Perazim&quot;.

==Etymology==
It is not certain whether the occurrence in 2 Sam.5:20 name is:
*(a) a word play - David is punning on an existing local name.
*(b) an anachronism - such as &quot;Abraham came to Dan&quot; Genesis 14:14.
Yoshitaka Kobayashi considers it an anachronism, but the use of Baal rather than El may indicate a play on an existing local name.

If the reference is to Mt. Perazim in Isaiah 28 then that suggests a mountain with a high ground position for David to attack. Alternatively, since David says &quot;Yahweh burst-through&quot; (פָּרַץ יְהוָה) &quot;like bursting of waters&quot; (פֶרֶץ מָיִם) it may be a reference to waters.

==Cultural influences==
This place name is the origin of term &quot;God of the Breakthrough&quot; in the Gospel music song of that name by Robert Critchley, sung by Lara George.

<text>The southern fire ant (&quot;Solenopsis xyloni&quot;), also known as the Californian fire ant or cotton ant, is a stinging fire ant native to southern parts of the United States. Its behaviour is similar to the red imported fire ant &quot;(S. invicta)&quot;, although its sting is less painful. It has a broad and opportunistic diet, and will store seeds in its nest and eat honeydew collected from other insects.

The southern fire ant shares its range with the red imported fire ant (&quot;S. invicta&quot;), the golden fire ant (&quot;S. aurea&quot;) and &quot;S. amblychila&quot;. The southern fire ant has the widest distribution of these, occurring from the Carolinas to California, including Georgia, lowland Tennessee, Arkansas, and southern Kansas.

<text>Mädchen Amick ( ; born December 12, 1970) is an American actress and television director. She is known for her starring role as Shelly Johnson on the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–1991), its prequel film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992) and its revival television series &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot; (2017). She appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;Baywatch&quot; (1989). She was a series regular on &quot;Central Park West&quot; (1995–1996), &quot;Freddie&quot; (2005–2006), and &quot;Witches of East End&quot; (2013–2014) and as Wendall Meade in &quot;ER&quot; (2004). In film, she had starring roles in &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; (1992) and &quot;Dream Lover&quot; (1993). She also portrayed Alice Cooper on The CW&#x27;s drama television series &quot;Riverdale&quot; (2017–2023).

==Early life==
Mädchen Elaina Amick was born in Sparks, Nevada, a city that borders Reno, the daughter of Judy (née Ross), a medical office manager, and Bill Amick, a musician. Amick&#x27;s parents are of partial German descent; the name &quot;Mädchen&quot; (German for &quot;girl&quot;) was chosen by her parents because they wanted an unusual name. She is also of Norwegian, Swedish, English and Irish descent. As a young girl, Amick was encouraged by her parents to follow her creative instincts. She learned to play the piano, bass, violin and guitar and took lessons in tap, ballet, jazz and modern dance. In 1987, at the age of 16, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting.

==Career==
After moving to Los Angeles, Amick began her career with guest roles on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1989) and &quot;Baywatch&quot; (1989). Amick got her first break when director David Lynch chose her to play waitress Shelly Johnson on the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–1991). Amick&#x27;s character endured physical abuse at the hands of her criminal husband, Leo, and was one of the most popular characters. Amick went on to work twice more with Lynch—reprising her role as Shelly in the prequel film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992) and in seven episodes of the 2017 &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; revival series.

In 1990, Amick was cast as Mandy in &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Her It&#x27;s Me&quot; and portrayed Amy in Tobe Hooper&#x27;s horror film &quot;I&#x27;m Dangerous Tonight&quot;. In 1991, Amick was cast in &quot;The Borrower&quot;. In 1992, Amick portrayed the heroine Tanya Robertson in the Stephen King horror film &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;. The following year, she starred in the thriller film &quot;Love, Cheat &amp; Steal&quot; (1993).

In 1993, Amick was cast as Lena Mathers in the feature film &quot;Dream Lover&quot;, a thriller in which she co-starred with James Spader. In 1995, she and Spader were reunited in the TV movie &quot;The Courtyard&quot;. That same year, Amick appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;French Exit&quot;. In 1996, Amick was cast in the science fiction thriller &quot;Bombshell&quot;. Amick&#x27;s return to network television came in the fall of 1995 with the much-publicized CBS primetime soap opera &quot;Central Park West&quot;. In 1997, she appeared in the film &quot;Wounded&quot;. In 1998, Amick costarred for one season in the reboot of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; on ABC alongside Malcolm McDowell.

After a decade of roles that failed to ignite the publicity &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; had, Amick gradually became a noticeable face in television with recurring roles on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Jake in Progress&quot;, and &quot;Joey&quot;. In 2006, Amick was a regular in the sitcom &quot;Freddie&quot;, which was subsequently canceled.

Amick guest-starred in a number of episodes of the serial thriller &quot;Kidnapped&quot; on NBC, playing a strange and deadly assassin. She also had a recurring role in the second season of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; as the lead character&#x27;s substitute film studies teacher. In 2007, she had a lead role in the short-lived CBS musical series &quot;Viva Laughlin&quot;.

Amick had a recurring role in season 2 of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; as Nate Archibald&#x27;s &quot;cougar&quot; love interest, and she also appears in the second season of the Showtime series &quot;Californication&quot;. In 2008, Amick starred as Christian Slater&#x27;s wife on the NBC series &quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot;. In 2010, Amick played Danielle Marchetti on the FX series &quot;Damages&quot;.

In 2011, she appeared in the post-apocalyptic film &quot;Priest&quot;. In 2013, Amick began starring in the Lifetime supernatural drama &quot;Witches of East End&quot; opposite Julia Ormond, Rachel Boston and Jenna Dewan. Amick&#x27;s character Wendy Beauchamp was originally a guest star, but she became a permanent character after shooting the pilot episode. On August 6, 2015, Amick joined the cast of &quot;American Horror Story: Hotel&quot; as a mother whose son is ailing. Since 2017, Amick has starred as Alice Cooper, Betty Cooper&#x27;s mother, on the CW television series &quot;Riverdale&quot;.

==Personal life==
Amick married her boyfriend of 8 years David Alexis on December 16, 1995. Together they have two children: son Sylvester Time Amick-Alexis and daughter Mina Tobias Amick-Alexis (known professionally as Mina Tobias). Tobias, a musician, released her single &quot;Freedom&quot; in 2018, the music video for which pays homage to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

<doc id="836706" wikidata="Q313077" url="?curid=836706" title="John Banville">
<text>William John Banville (born 8 December 1945) is an Irish novelist, short story writer, adapter of dramas and screenwriter. Though he has been described as &quot;the heir to Proust, via Nabokov&quot;, Banville himself maintains that W. B. Yeats and Henry James are the two real influences on his work.

Banville has won the 1976 James Tait Black Memorial Prize, the 2003 International Nonino Prize, the 2005 Booker Prize, the 2011 Franz Kafka Prize, the 2013 Austrian State Prize for European Literature and the 2014 Prince of Asturias Award for Literature. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2007. Italy made him a &quot;&quot; of the Ordine della Stella d&#x27;Italia (essentially a knighthood) in 2017. He is a former member of Aosdána, having voluntarily relinquished the financial stipend in 2001 to another, more impoverished, writer.

Banville was born and grew up in Wexford town in south-east Ireland. He published his first novel, &quot;Nightspawn&quot;, in 1971. A second, &quot;Birchwood&quot;, followed two years later. &quot;The Revolutions Trilogy&quot;, published between 1976 and 1982, comprises three works, each named in reference to a renowned scientist: &quot;Doctor Copernicus&quot;, &quot;Kepler&quot; and &quot;The Newton Letter&quot;. His next work, &quot;Mefisto&quot;, had a mathematical theme, and, in combination with the three books from the aforementioned &quot;The Revolutions Trilogy,&quot; is the fourth book from the &quot;Scientific Tetralogy.&quot; His 1989 novel &quot;The Book of Evidence&quot;, shortlisted for the Booker Prize and winner of that year&#x27;s Guinness Peat Aviation award, heralded a second trilogy, three works which deal in common with the work of art. &quot;The Frames Trilogy&quot; is completed by &quot;Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Athena&quot;, both published during the 1990s. Banville&#x27;s thirteenth novel, &quot;The Sea&quot;, won the Booker Prize in 2005. In addition, he publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black: most of these feature the character of Quirke, an Irish pathologist based in 1950s Dublin. His alternative history novel &quot;The Secret Guests&quot; (2020) was published under the name B. W. Black.

Banville is considered a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. He lives in Dublin.

==Early life==
William John Banville was born to Agnes (née Doran) and Martin Banville, a garage clerk, in Wexford, Ireland. He is the youngest of three siblings; his older brother Vincent is also a novelist and has written under the name Vincent Lawrence as well as his own. His sister Anne Veronica &quot;Vonnie&quot; Banville-Evans has written both a children&#x27;s novel and a memoir of growing up in Wexford. Banville stole a collection of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s poetry from Wexford County Library while in his teens.

Banville was educated at CBS Primary, Wexford, a Christian Brothers school, and at St Peter&#x27;s College, Wexford. Despite having intended to be a painter and an architect, he did not attend university. Banville has described this as &quot;A great mistake. I should have gone. I regret not taking that four years of getting drunk and falling in love. But I wanted to get away from my family. I wanted to be free.&quot; In contrast, he has stated that college would have had little benefit for him: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I would have learned much more, and I don&#x27;t think I would have had the nerve to tackle some of the things I tackled as a young writer if I had been to university—I would have been beaten into submission by my lecturers.&quot;

After school, Banville worked as a clerk at Aer Lingus, which allowed him to travel at deeply discounted rates. He took advantage of these rates to travel to Greece and Italy. On his return to Ireland, he became a sub-editor at &quot;The Irish Press&quot;, eventually becoming chief sub-editor. Before &quot;The Irish Press&quot; collapsed in 1995, Banville became a sub-editor at &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. He was appointed literary editor in 1998. &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, too, endured financial troubles, and Banville was offered the choice of taking a redundancy package or working as a features department sub-editor. He left.

==Personal life==
Banville has two sons from a marriage to the American textile artist Janet Dunham, whom he met in the United States during the 1960s. Asked in 2012 about the breakdown of that marriage, Banville&#x27;s immediate thoughts focused on the effect it had on his children; &quot;It was hard on them&quot;, he said. Banville later went on to have two daughters from another relationship.

Banville does not eat meat.

==Writing==
Banville published his first book, a collection of short stories titled &quot;Long Lankin&quot;, in 1970. He has disowned his first published novel, &quot;Nightspawn&quot;, describing it as &quot;crotchety, posturing, absurdly pretentious&quot;.

As an unknown writer in the 1980s, he toured Dublin&#x27;s bookshops—&quot;and we had a lot of bookshops back then&quot;—around the time of the publication of his novel &quot;Kepler&quot; &quot;and there wasn&#x27;t a single one of any of my books anywhere&quot;. But, he noted in 2012, &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel badly about it because I was writing the kinds of books I wanted to write. And I had no one but myself to blame if I wasn&#x27;t making money, that wasn&#x27;t anybody&#x27;s fault. Nobody was obliged to buy my books&quot;.

Since 1990, Banville has been a regular contributor to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;.

Banville has written three trilogies: the first, &quot;The Revolutions Trilogy&quot;, focused on great men of science and consisted of &quot;Doctor Copernicus&quot; (1976), &quot;Kepler&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Newton Letter&quot; (1982). He said he became interested in Kepler and other men of science after reading Arthur Koestler&#x27;s &quot;The Sleepwalkers.&quot; He realised that, like him, scientists were trying to impose order in their work.

The second trilogy, sometimes referred to collectively as &quot;The Frames Trilogy&quot;, consists of &quot;The Book of Evidence&quot; (1989), with several of its characters being featured in &quot;Ghosts&quot; (1993); &quot;Athena&quot; (1995) is the third to feature an unreliable narrator and explore the power of works of art.

The third trilogy consists of &quot;Eclipse&quot;, &quot;Shroud&quot; and &quot;Ancient Light&quot;, all of which concern the characters Alexander and Cass Cleave.

In a July 2008 interview with Juan José Delaney in the Argentine newspaper &quot;La Nación&quot;, Banville was asked if his books had been translated into Irish. He replied that nobody would translate them and that he was often referred to pejoratively as a West Brit.

He wrote fondly of John McGahern, who lost his job amid condemnation by his workplace and the Catholic Church for becoming intimately involved with a foreign woman. While on a book tour of the United States in March 2006, Banville received a telephone call: &quot;I have bad news, I&#x27;m afraid. John Banville is dead&quot;. However, Banville was aware that McGahern had been unwell and, having performed the necessary checks to ensure that he was still alive, concluded that it was McGahern who was dead instead. And it was.
He wrote an account of Caravaggio&#x27;s 1602 painting &quot;The Taking of Christ&quot; for the book &quot;Lines of Vision&quot;, released in 2014 to mark the 150th anniversary of the National Gallery of Ireland.

He contributed to &quot;Sons+Fathers&quot;, a book published in 2015 to provide funds for the Irish Hospice Foundation&#x27;s efforts to give care to terminally ill patients within their own homes.

===Crime fiction===
Beginning with &quot;Christine Falls&quot;, published in 2006, Banville has written crime fiction under the pen name Benjamin Black. He writes his Benjamin Black crime fiction much more quickly than he composes his literary novels. He appreciates his work as Black as a craft, while as Banville he is an artist. He considers crime writing, in his own words, as being &quot;cheap fiction&quot;.

The main character in Banville&#x27;s Quirke series is a Dublin pathologist in the 1950s. The first three novels, &quot;Christine Falls&quot; (2006), &quot;The Silver Swan&quot; (2007), and &quot;Elegy for April&quot; (2011) were made into a crime drama television series, &quot;Quirke&quot;. Subsequent novels in the series were: &quot;A Death in Summer&quot; (2011), &quot;Vengeance&quot; (2012), &quot;Holy Orders&quot; (2013), &quot;Even the Dead&quot; (2016), &quot;April in Spain&quot; (2021), &quot;The Lock-Up&quot; (2023) and &quot;The Drowned&quot; (2024). The last three of these were published under Banville&#x27;s own name. A related book (also published under Banville&#x27;s own name) is &quot;Snow&quot; (2020), featuring the character of Detective Inspector St. John Strafford, who subsequently appeared in &quot;April in Spain&quot; and &quot;The Lock-Up&quot;.

Other crime novels, written under the name Benjamin Black, include &quot;The Lemur&quot; (2008), &quot;The Black-Eyed Blonde&quot; (2014), and &quot;Prague Nights&quot; (2017).

&quot;The Secret Guests&quot; (2020) is an alternative history/crime novel, centred on a scenario in which the young British princesses Elizabeth and Margaret are evacuated to County Tipperary in 1940 to escape the threats of the London Blitz and a possible German invasion of Britain. This was published under the name B. W. Black. It again features the character of St. John Strafford.

==Style==
Banville is highly scathing of all of his work, stating of his books: &quot;I hate them all ... I loathe them. They&#x27;re all a standing embarrassment.&quot; Instead of dwelling on the past he is continually looking forward, &quot;You have to crank yourself up every morning and think about all the awful stuff you did yesterday, and how you can compensate for that by doing better today.&quot; He does not read reviews of his work as he already knows—&quot;better than any reviewer&quot;—the places in which its faults lie.

His typical writing day begins with a drive from his home in Dublin to his office by the river. He writes from 9 a.m. until lunch. He then dines on bread, cheese and tea and resumes working until 6 p.m., at which time he returns home. He writes on two desks at right angles to each other, one facing a wall and the other facing a window through which he has no view and never cleans. He advises against young writers approaching him for advice: &quot;I remind them as gently as I can, that they are on their own, with no help available anywhere&quot;. He has compared writing to the life of an athlete: &quot;It&#x27;s asking an awful lot of one&#x27;s self. Every day you have to do your absolute best—it&#x27;s a bit like being a sportsman. You have to perform at the absolute top of your game, six, seven, eight hours a day—that&#x27;s very, very wearing&quot;.

===Themes===
Banville is considered by critics as a master stylist of English, and his writing has been described as perfectly crafted, beautiful, and dazzling. He is known for his dark humour, and sharp, wintery wit. He has been described as &quot;the heir to Proust, via Nabokov&quot;.

Don DeLillo describes Banville&#x27;s work as &quot;dangerous and clear-running prose&quot;, David Mehegan of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; calls him &quot;one of the great stylists writing in English today&quot;, Val Nolan in &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot; calls his style &quot;lyrical, fastidious, and occasionally hilarious&quot;; &quot;The Observer&quot; described &quot;The Book of Evidence&quot; as &quot;flawlessly flowing prose whose lyricism, patrician irony and aching sense of loss are reminiscent of &quot;Lolita&quot;.&quot; Gerry Dukes, reviewing &quot;The Sea&quot; in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, hailed Banville as a &quot;lord of language&quot;.

Michael Ross has stated that Banville is &quot;perhaps the only living writer capable of advancing fiction beyond the point reached by Beckett&quot;.

Banville has said that he is &quot;trying to blend poetry and fiction into some new form&quot;. He writes in the Hiberno-English dialect and dreads this being lost if he were to move abroad as other Irish writers have done.

===Literary influences===

Banville said in an interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot; that he liked Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s style; however, he went on, &quot;But I always thought there was something odd about it that I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on. Then I read an interview in which he admitted he was tone deaf.&quot; Heinrich von Kleist is influential, Banville having written adaptations of three of his plays (including &quot;&quot;), as well as using the myth of Amphitryon as a basis for his novel &quot;The Infinities&quot;.

Banville has said that he imitated James Joyce as a boy: &quot;After I&#x27;d read The &quot;Dubliners&quot;, and was struck at the way Joyce wrote about real life, I immediately started writing bad imitations of The &quot;Dubliners.&quot;&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; reports: &quot;Banville himself has acknowledged that all Irish writers are followers of either Joyce or Beckett—and he places himself in the Beckett camp.&quot; He has also acknowledged other influences. During a 2011 interview on the program &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, Rose asked, &quot;The guiding light has always been Henry James?&quot; and Banville replied, &quot;I think so, I mean people say, you know, I&#x27;ve been influenced by Beckett or Nabokov but it&#x27;s always been Henry James ... so I would follow him, I would be a Jamesian.&quot; Meanwhile, in a 2012 interview with Noah Charney, Banville cited W. B. Yeats and Henry James as the two real influences on his work. Responding to the suggestion that Fyodor Dostoevsky and Albert Camus were worthy comparisons, Banville said: &quot;Dostoyevsky is such a bad writer it is hard to take him seriously... Ditto Camus&quot;.

==Philosophy==
He considers himself to be &quot;incurably terrified of air travel&quot;, fearing &quot;the plane going down amid the terrible shrieking of engines and passengers&quot;.

===Women===
Banville has often spoken and written of his admiration for women.

He is in favour of women&#x27;s rights and has welcomed the gradual freedom that has come about in his native land during his lifetime, over the course of which Ireland changed from a country dominated by Roman Catholic ideology, where women were trapped in the home with little career opportunities and subject to restrictions on the availability of contraception, to a country where the position of women became more valued and where one woman could succeed another woman as the country&#x27;s President, a role previously the exclusive preserve of men. On women in his own writing, Banville told Niamh Horan of the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; in 2012: &quot;I don&#x27;t make a distinction between men and women. To me they are just people&quot;. Horan herself noted Banville&#x27;s &quot;special flair for writing about women and delving into the female psyche&quot;.

Banville contributed the introduction to the fifty-year retrospective of Edna O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s work, &quot;The Love Object: Selected Stories&quot;, praising her as &quot;one of the most sophisticated writers now at work&quot; and noting how it was &quot;hard to think of any contemporary writer who could match [O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s] combination of immediacy and sympathetic recall&quot;. He noted how &quot;striking&quot; is the figuring of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s characters and acknowledged that all her characters &quot;are in some way damaged by the world, and specifically by the world of men&quot;. Banville concluded by describing O&#x27;Brien as &quot;simply one of the finest writers of our time&quot;.

Banville dedicated himself to the task of writing the screenplay for an adaptation of Elizabeth Bowen&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last September&quot;. Bowen&#x27;s work was largely neglected at the time; Vintage published new editions of each of Bowen&#x27;s novels and Hermione Lee&#x27;s biography of her to coincide with its release. Banville later wrote the introduction for her &quot;Collected Stories&quot;.

Close to the literary editor Caroline Walsh, Banville spoke of his devastation upon learning of her death. He dedicated &quot;Ancient Light&quot; to her. Likewise, Banville was close to Eileen Battersby, at whose funeral he was moved to tears whilst reciting a poem in her memory.

===Crime and punishment===
Speaking to Niamh Horan in 2012, Banville related his thoughts on hurt and responsibility: &quot;To hurt other people is the worst thing you can do. To be hurt oneself is bad enough, but hurting other people is unforgivable... Unforgivable. Literally unforgivable. I think that one has to take responsibility for one&#x27;s life and one has to take responsibility for one&#x27;s bad deeds as well as one&#x27;s good deeds. One has to, as I say, be responsible... Failure in art, or failure in making a living, or a success—none of them compares, everything pales beside hurting other people, because, you know, we are here for such a short time and basic life itself is so hard one has a duty to try to be decent to other people&quot;.

===Relationship with animals===
Ben, a labrador, lived until the age of 11 before succumbing to cancer at Christmas 1980. Decades later Banville still regarded Ben as &quot;a lost friend, and every few months he ambles into one of my dreams, snuffling and sighing and obviously wondering why there are no more walks. This may sound sentimental, but it does not feel that way&quot;.

On 21 August 2017, the RTÉ Radio 1 weekday afternoon show &quot;Liveline&quot; was discussing a report on Trinity College Dublin&#x27;s use of 100,000 animals to conduct scientific research over the previous four years when a listener pointed out that Banville had previously raised the matter but been ignored. Banville personally telephoned &quot;Liveline&quot; to call the practice &quot;absolutely disgraceful&quot; and told the tale of how he had come upon some women protesting: 

Asked if he received any other support for his stance in the letter he sent to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, he replied:

This for Banville was a rare intervention of its kind, revealing to the public a different side—as he acknowledged when the presenter asked him if he had a history of objecting to activities such as blood sport: 

==Awards and honours==
===Booker Prize===

Banville wrote a letter in 1981 to &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggesting that the Booker Prize, for which he was &quot;runner-up to the shortlist of contenders&quot;, be given to him so that he could use the money to buy every copy of the longlisted books in Ireland and donate them to libraries, &quot;thus ensuring that the books not only are bought but also read – surely a unique occurrence&quot;.

When his novel &quot;The Book of Evidence&quot; was shortlisted for the 1989 Booker Prize, Banville said a friend—whom he described as &quot;a gentleman of the turf&quot;—instructed him &quot;to bet on the other five shortlistees, saying it was a sure thing, since if I won the prize I would have the prize-money, and if I lost one of the others would win ... But the thing baffled me and I never placed the bets. I doubt I&#x27;ll be visiting Ladbrokes any time soon&quot;.

Banville was not shortlisted for the Booker Prize again until 2005 when his novel &quot;The Sea&quot; was selected. &quot;The Sea&quot; was in contention alongside novels written by Julian Barnes, Sebastian Barry, Kazuo Ishiguro, Ali Smith and Zadie Smith. The chairman of the judges was John Sutherland. Earlier that year Sutherland had written approvingly of Ian McEwan&#x27;s novel &quot;Saturday.&quot; Banville, however, dismissed the work in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; and expressed his dismay that McEwan was increasingly showing &quot;a disturbing tendency toward mellowness&quot;. Anne Haverty later described Banville&#x27;s critique of &quot;Saturday&quot; as &quot;devastatingly effective&quot;. Sutherland sent a letter (signed with the title &quot;Lord Northcliffe Professor Emeritus&quot;) in response to Banville&#x27;s review, a letter in which he took Banville to task over his misreading of a game of squash in the novel. Banville issued a written reply with the opening line: &quot;Summoned, one shuffles guiltily into the Department of Trivia&quot;, before begging Sutherland&#x27;s pardon for his &quot;sluggish comprehension&quot; after managing to make his way through &quot;all seventeen pages&quot; of the game. Banville later admitted that, upon reading Sutherland&#x27;s letter, he had thought: &quot;[W]ell, I can kiss the Booker goodbye&quot;.

At the award ceremony, BBC Two&#x27;s Kirsty Wark quizzed &quot;Financial Times&quot; arts editor Jan Dalley, the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; literary editor Suzi Feay and &quot;The Observer&quot; literary editor Robert McCrum. Banville, Barry and Ali Smith were dismissed outright and much of the discussion focused on Barnes, Ishiguro and Zadie Smith. In the end, the judges&#x27; vote was split between Banville and Ishiguro, with Rick Gekoski one of those favouring Banville. It fell to Sutherland to cast the winning vote; he did so in favour of Banville. Banville later said: &quot;I have not been the most popular person in London literary circles over the past half-year. And I think it was very large of Sutherland to cast the winning vote in my favour&quot;.

When the prize rules later changed to allow entries by American writers, Banville welcomed the idea. However, he later expressed regret over the decision: &quot;The prize was unique in its original form, but has lost that uniqueness. It is now just another prize among prizes. I am convinced the administrators should take the bold step of conceding the change was wrong, and revert&quot;.

===Kafka Prize===
In 2011, Banville was awarded the Franz Kafka Prize. Marcel Reich-Ranicki and John Calder were members of the jury. Banville described the award as &quot;one of the ones one really wants to get. It&#x27;s an old style prize and as an old codger it&#x27;s perfect for me ... I&#x27;ve been wrestling with Kafka since I was an adolescent&quot; and said his bronze statuette trophy &quot;will glare at me from the mantelpiece&quot;.

===Nobel Prize in Literature hoax===
On the day that the 2019 and 2018 prizes were to be announced, the Swedish Academy&#x27;s number appeared on Banville&#x27;s telephone. A man purporting to be Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy Mats Malm told him he had won and even read out the customary citation and asked if he would prefer to be designated the 2018 or 2019 laureate. Banville was attending a physiotherapy appointment at the time and was lying face down on a couch when the call came. He had, however, retained a mobile telephone nearby, should he be contacted to give his view on a possible Irish winner. He informed his daughter; she called her father back while watching the live announcement at midday to tell him his name had not been mentioned. Banville telephoned everyone he had spoken to in the intervening period to tell them: &quot;Don’t buy the champagne, stop throwing your hats in the air&quot;.

After the announcement, a voicemail to Banville (from the man posing as Malm) claimed the Swedish Academy had withdrawn his prize due to a disagreement. Banville felt sorry for the man purporting to be Malm: &quot;He certainly sounded upset, he was a very good actor&quot;. But he then compared the speaker with a YouTube recording of the real Malm, at which point he realised that the speaker&#x27;s voice was deeper than Malm&#x27;s, and Malm had a better grasp of English.

Banville called upon the Swedish Academy to investigate the incident &quot;because I don&#x27;t think the hoax was aimed at me, I think it was aimed at damaging the Academy or one or two members of the Academy&quot;. He described himself as &quot;collateral damage&quot;. When informed of the incident, the real Malm said: &quot;It sounds like a bad joke&quot;. Fellow Academy member Per Wästberg also thought it sounded like a &quot;joke&quot;. Banville later elaborated on the experience: &quot;I have the distinct impression that I wasn’t the target of this really. I think he assumed that I would believe him and that I would make a big fuss in the newspapers and say this is another dispute within the jury. I think that&#x27;s what he expected me to do because that would embarrass the Academy. Specifically, he was talking about some woman on it who was deeply into gender studies. So I suspect it was her that was the target. It wasn&#x27;t done for fun. It has the hallmarks of a man with a grudge. Not a grudge against me&quot;. Banville provided the recording to the Swedish Academy to assist its investigation.

Banville responded well in spite the hoax; he was described in the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; as being &quot;as dignified and eloquent as ever in the face of a disappointment that made headlines around the world&quot; and told &quot;The Observer&quot;: &quot;There is some comedy in it and potential material: &#x27;The man who nearly won the Nobel prize&#x27;&quot;. Media in Ireland described the trick played on Banville as &quot;cruel&quot;, while media in neighbouring England described it as &quot;deceitful&quot;. He received numerous sympathetic emails and telephone calls and support from fellow writers.

<text>Cultural exchanges between western peoples, particularly Arabs and Chinese, have been occurring for centuries. The earliest records go back to 635, with the discovery of the Nestorian Stone, and are then followed by Marco Polo and Ibn Batutta several centuries later.

The Nestorian Stone located in Xi&#x27;an records is the earliest known name of a Christian missionary, Alopen, who traveled to China through the Silk Road to Chang&#x27;an, which was the then capital of the Tang dynasty in 635. He was sent by the Church of the East. When he arrived in Chang&#x27;an, he was welcomed by T&#x27;ai Tsung, who brought him to an imperial library and ordered the books that he brought with him to be translated into Hokkien. It is noted that most of the earliest Christian works can be dated back to the period of Alopen. In 638, three years after Alopen&#x27;s arrival in China, the first Christian church was built in Chang&#x27;an, and with it, came the presence of 21 all-Persian Nestorian monks who were recognized to be in the Tang Empire.

==Marco Polo==
The first tangible record of Westerners in Fuzhou is that of Marco Polo, in about 1285, when he visited Fujiu. He observed that the people were the subjects of Kublai Khan, were ‘idolaters’, and much engaged in commerce and manufacture. Marco Polo remarks that in these parts, Ginger and galangal are produced in quantities, as are other drugs.The people in this part of the country are addicted to eating human flesh, esteeming it more delicate than any other, provided that the person has not been occasioned by disease... They are a most savage race of men, insomuch that when they slay their enemies in battle, they are anxious to drink their blood, and afterwards, they devour their flesh.Marco Polo dictated his book in prison several years after he returned from China. Some suggest that he did not visit this part of China at all. He claims to have visited Quanzhou, which, according to Marco Polo, is fifteen miles from Guangzhou, after leaving Fuzhou and making a detour in Guilin and Guangzhou.

They inquired from what source they had received their faith and their rule, and their informants replied, &quot;From our forefathers.&quot;

==Ibn Battuta==
The Rihla documents the world travels of the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta, including his journey and travels in China. Ibn Batutta left for China from the Samudra Pasai Sultanate, located on the Malaysian island of Sumatra, in April 1346, in a junk provided for him by the ruler of Samudra Pasai, Al-Mailk al Zahir. In The Rihla, Ibn Battuta recalls that the trip to China took four months, possibly owing to stops at two ports in either eastern Malaysia, Champa, or Tonkin. The description and the locations of these places remain unknown and are thought to have not existed at all.

Some historians note that Ibn Battuta&#x27;s travelogue of his visit to China appears superficial, though it did describe Battuta&#x27;s concern with the dominance of paganism in China and his dislike of most of what he saw in China, with him tending to stay at his home &quot;as often as he could&quot;. In the Rihla, it mentions that he first landed in the port city of Quanzhou and later met with a Chinese envoy who was the chief of customs in the city and who had met with Ibn Battuta in his previous travels and arrived in China before Battuta had, and who possibly allowed for Battuta to later visit the capital of the Yuan dynasty to meet the emperor as a diplomat of the Sultanate of India.

He received word that he was to go on to Beijing to meet with the emperor, and Ibn Battuta is thought to have taken the northward route through the canal system, and it is possible that he first stopped at a city he called Qanjanfu, which is now commonly called Fuzhou, and a second stop further up the canal at Hangzhou. He stayed in Hangzhou for a few weeks before returning to Quanzhou, where he would eventually leave from the southern coast in the fall monsoon season of 1346.

<doc id="836740" wikidata="Q2467206" url="?curid=836740" title="Petersburg (novel)">
<text>Petersburg (; pre-reform spelling: Петербургъ) is a novel by Russian writer Andrei Bely. A Symbolist work, it has been compared to other &quot;city novels&quot; like &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;. The first edition was completed in November 1913 and published serially from October 1913 to March 1914 (and later reissued as a book in 1916). It received little attention and was not translated into English until 1959 by John Cournos, over 45 years after it was written.

Today the book is generally considered Bely&#x27;s masterpiece; Vladimir Nabokov ranked it one of the four greatest &quot;masterpieces of twentieth-century prose&quot;, after &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, and before &quot;the first half&quot; of &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.

In 1922, Bely published in Berlin a revised edition which was shorter by a third than the first one. As Bely noted, &quot;the new edition is a completely new book for the readers of the first edition&quot;. In the Berlin version Bely changed the foot of his rhythmic prose from anapest to amphibrach, and removed ironical passages related to the revolutionary movement. The second version is usually considered as inferior to the first one.

The novel is the second part of Bely&#x27;s unfinished trilogy &quot;East or West&quot;, while &quot;The Silver Dove&quot; is the first one.
==Plot summary==
Just after the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Nikolai Apollonovich Ableukhov is given the task of assassinating his bureaucrat father, Apollon Apollonovich, using a time bomb supplied to him by a fellow radical, Alexander Ivanovich Dudkin. Nikolai Apollonovich spends much of his time dressing himself in a red domino costume with a black domino mask, making a fool of himself in front of Sofya Petrovna Likhutina, a woman who has rebuked his flirtations in the past. Instead of focusing on the immense task he has agreed to undertake he gets himself into the newspaper&#x27;s gossip columns with his antics and attends a party. His father notices these exploits and decides that his son is a scoundrel. Dudkin himself answers to a higher power, a man named Lippanchenko who is the leader of their radical group. Eventually both Nikolai Apollonovich and Dudkin experience a change of heart about their mission, however there is much to detain Nikolai Apollonovich on his way to throw the bomb into the river.

==Analysis==

Bely drew many of his characters from historical models: Apollon Apollonovich shares many characteristics with Procurator of the Holy Synod Konstantin Pobedonostsev; Dudkin resembles the revolutionary terrorist Boris Savinkov; Lippanchenko shares many characteristics with the infamous double agent Yevno Azef.

There are similarities with James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. The linguistic rhythms, wordplay, Symbolism, politics, and general structure and themes of the novel have all been compared to Joyce&#x27;s novel, as well as the setting of the action in a capital city (Dublin; St. Petersburg) that is itself a character and the unusual use of humor. However, the differences are also notable; the English translation of Bely remains more accessible than Joyce, for example. Bely&#x27;s work is based on a complex rhythm of patterns, yet does not use such a wide variety of innovations as Joyce.

The comparison of &quot;Petersburg&quot; to &quot;Ulysses&quot; has been made for both its symbolist style and for the centrality of the city within the narrative. There are many allusions within the novel to the city&#x27;s history going back to its founding by Peter the Great, and it incorporates a number of literary allusions to literature set in Petersburg (especially &quot;The Bronze Horseman&quot;) as well as Russian literature in general. The characters such as Apollon Apollonovich and Alexander Ivanovich often merge with their environments, while the city itself forms a significant role in the story&#x27;s unfolding.

The book was informed by many of the philosophies Bely and others of his time were concerned with, both political and spiritual. One of the major influences on the somewhat mystical tone of the book was Bely&#x27;s experience with Rudolf Steiner and his philosophy of anthroposophy. The characters undergo various transcendent states, and these are generally drawn from Bely&#x27;s spiritual studies. There are also discussions of Marxism and Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s ideas, and, though the book revolves around a political action, much of it is concerned with spiritual states.

==Translations==
There have been four major translations of the novel into English:

* &quot;St. Petersburg&quot; (or &quot;Saint Petersburg&quot;), translated by John Cournos (1959, based on the Berlin version)
* &quot;Petersburg&quot;, translated and annotated by John E. Malmstad and Robert A. Maguire (Indiana University Press, 1978; based on the Berlin version) 
* &quot;Petersburg&quot;, translated by David McDuff (Penguin Books, 1995)
* &quot;Petersburg&quot;, translated by John Elsworth (Pushkin Press, 2009); winner of the 2012 Rossica Translation Prize

In a review of all the existing English translations, Professor Michael R. Katz writes that, &quot;if someone wants to read Bely&#x27;s masterpiece and to understand &quot;most&quot; of it, then learn Russian and read it in the original; if he/she wants to understand &quot;some&quot; of it, then read Maguire and Malmstad&#x27;s magisterial annotated, introduced, and reasonably well-translated scholarly edition; and if someone wants just to say that he/she has read Bely&#x27;s &quot;Petersburg&quot; for the sake of adding one notch to his cultural gun [then] go read Elsworth&#x27;s version.&quot; In the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Thomas Karshan noted that &quot;Elsworth&#x27;s version conveys little of Bely&#x27;s sonic patterning&quot; but that &quot;McDuff&#x27;s distinguished 1995 version does a good job of approximating the music of Bely&#x27;s Symbolist prose poetry&quot;.

<text>Britvic was a British producer of soft drinks based in Hemel Hempstead, England. It produced soft drinks under its own name, as well as several other brands. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Carlsberg Group and integrated into Carlsberg&#x27;s UK operations as part of Carlsberg Britvic in January 2025.

==History==
The company was founded in the 1930s in Chelmsford as the &quot;British Vitamin Products Company&quot;. It started producing fruit juices in 1938 and started marketing them under the &quot;Britvic&quot; name in 1949. Acquired by Showerings of Shepton Mallet, and subsequently a division of Allied Breweries from 1968, the company changed its name to &quot;Britvic&quot; in 1971. In 1986, it merged with &quot;Canada Dry Rawlings&quot; and acquired the R. White&#x27;s Lemonade brand. It acquired Tango and the Corona brand from Beechams in 1987 and since that year it has also owned the UK franchise for Pepsi and 7 Up. In 1995, it bought Robinson&#x27;s from Reckitt &amp; Colman.

In December 2005, the company underwent an initial public offering (IPO), allowing its main shareholders (InterContinental Hotels Group, Whitbread, Pernod Ricard) to realise their investments. In May 2007, the Company bought the soft drinks and distribution businesses of Ireland&#x27;s Cantrell &amp; Cochrane (C&amp;C) for £169.5m.

On 14 November 2012, the company announced plans to merge with Scottish soft drink producer A.G. Barr, the maker of brands including Irn-Bru, Tizer and D&#x27;n&#x27;B, which would have created one of Europe&#x27;s largest soft drinks companies. The merger was put into serious doubt after the Office of Fair Trading referred it to the Competition Commission. On 11 July 2013, A.G. Barr chairman, Ronnie Hanna, announced that the proposed merger had been abandoned.

In May 2017, PepsiCo announced that it had decided to sell its long-held 4.5 per cent stake in Britvic.

On 8 July 2024, it was announced that the Danish Carlsberg Group would buy Britvic. Upon completion, Britvic will rebrand under the Carlsberg umbrella, with the brewery company becoming the biggest PepsiCo drink licenser in the world. The transaction was approved by the court on 15 January 2025, so allowing it to complete. 

Britvic was incorporated into Carlsberg&#x27;s existing UK business Carlsberg Marston&#x27;s, and the whole business was renamed Carlsberg Britvic on 17 January 2025.

==Operations==

Most of the company&#x27;s operations are concentrated in the United Kingdom and Ireland and the company exports to over 50 countries. Its corporate headquarters moved from Chelmsford, Essex to Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, in March 2012.

===United Kingdom===
The drink brands the company owns in the UK include Britvic mixers, R. White&#x27;s Lemonade, Tango, Robinson&#x27;s and J2O – as well as being the licensed bottler for PepsiCo products within the UK. In 2008, Britvic launched Gatorade in the UK, after securing the rights to do so from PepsiCo. In May 2010, Britvic launched a UK specific version of the popular drink, Mountain Dew Energy. It tastes similar to its American counterpart, but has a lower caffeine and sugar content.

===Ireland===

After their failed IPO C&amp;C&#x27;s sold their soft drink brands to Britvic, resulting in the company now owning a number of brands in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, including, Ballygowan Water, Britvic, Cidona, MiWadi, and Energise Sport as well as the rights to the Pepsi and 7 Up brands in the territory through its bottling agreements with PepsiCo.

===France===
Britvic bought Fruité Entreprises in May 2010 for £298 million. It has since renamed the business Britvic France. It is mainly a fruit juice business, unlike the GB&amp;I businesses that focus on soft drinks.

===Brazil===
In 2015, Britvic acquired ebba (Empresa Brasileira de Bebidas e Alimentos SA), located in São Paulo, and in 2017 Bela Ischia, located in Rio de Janeiro.

<doc id="836768" wikidata="Q170344" url="?curid=836768" title="Anselm Kiefer">
<text>Anselm Kiefer (born 8 March 1945) is a German painter and sculptor. He studied with Peter Dreher and Horst Antes at the end of the 1960s. His works incorporate materials such as straw, , clay, lead, and shellac. The poems of Paul Celan have played a role in developing Kiefer&#x27;s themes of German history and the horrors of the Holocaust, as have the spiritual concepts of Kabbalah.

In his entire body of work, Kiefer argues with the past and addresses taboo and controversial issues from recent history. Themes from Nazi rule are particularly reflected in his work; for instance, the painting &quot;Margarete&quot; (oil and straw on canvas) was inspired by Celan&#x27;s well-known poem &quot;Todesfuge&quot; (&quot;Death Fugue&quot;).

His works are characterised by an unflinching willingness to confront his culture&#x27;s dark past, and unrealised potential, in works that are often done on a large, confrontational scale well suited to the subjects. It is also characteristic of his work to find signatures and names of people of historical importance, legendary figures or historical places. All of these are encoded sigils through which Kiefer seeks to process the past; this has resulted in his work being linked with the movements &quot;New Symbolism&quot; and &quot;Neo–Expressionism&quot;.

Kiefer has lived and worked in France since 1992. Since 2008, he has lived and worked primarily in Paris. In 2018, he was awarded Austrian citizenship.

==Personal life and career==
The son of a German art teacher, Kiefer was born in Donaueschingen a few months before the end of World War II. His city having been heavily bombed, Kiefer grew up surrounded by the devastation of the war. In 1951, his family moved to , and he attended public school in Rastatt, graduating high school in 1965. He studied at the University of Freiburg, studying pre-law and Romance languages. However, after three semesters he switched to art, studying at art academies in Freiburg and Karlsruhe. In Karlsruhe, he studied under Peter Dreher, a realist and figurative painter. He received an art degree in 1969.

In 1971 Kiefer moved to Hornbach (Walldürn) and established a studio. He remained in the Neckar-Odenwald-Kreis until 1992; his output during this first creative time is known as &quot;The German Years&quot;. In 1992 he relocated to France.

Kiefer left his first wife and children in Germany on his move to Barjac in 1992. From 2008 he lived in Paris, in a large house in the Marais district, with his second wife, the Austrian photographer Renate Graf, and their two children. Kiefer and Graf divorced in 2014.

In 2017, Kiefer was ranked one of the richest 1,001 individuals and families in Germany by the monthly business publication &quot;Manager Magazin&quot;.

Kiefer is the subject of the 3D documentary film &quot;Anselm&quot; (2023), directed by Wim Wenders.

==Artistic process==
Generally, Kiefer attributes traditional mythology, books, and libraries as his main subjects and sources of inspiration. In his middle years, his inspiration came from literary figures, namely Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann. His later works incorporate themes from Judeo-Christian, ancient Egyptian, and Oriental cultures, which he combines with other motifs. Cosmogony is also a large focus in his works. In all, Kiefer searches for the meaning of existence and &quot;representation of the incomprehensible and the non-representational.&quot;

===Philosophy===
Kiefer values a &quot;spiritual connection&quot; with the materials he works with, &quot;extracting the spirit that already lives within [them].&quot; In doing so, he transforms his materials with acid baths and physical blows with sticks and axes, among other processes.

He often chooses materials for their alchemical properties—lead in particular. Kiefer&#x27;s initial attraction to lead arose when he had to repair aging pipes in the first house he owned. Eventually, he came to admire its physical and sensory qualities and began to discover more about its connection to alchemy. Physically, Kiefer specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he sees many colors, especially gold, which he associates to the symbolic gold sought by alchemists.

Kiefer&#x27;s use of straw in his work represents energy. He claims this is due to straw&#x27;s physical qualities, including the color gold and its release of energy and heat when burned. The resulting ash makes way for new creation, thus echoing the motifs of transformation and the cycle of life.

Kiefer also values the balance between order and chaos in his work, stating, &quot;[I]f there is too much order, [the piece] is dead; or if there is much chaos, it doesn&#x27;t cohere.&quot; In addition, he cares deeply about the space in which his works reside. He states that his works &quot;lose their power completely&quot; if put in the wrong spaces.

==Work==
===Photography===
Kiefer began his career creating performances and documenting them in photographs titled &quot;Occupations and Heroische Sinnbilder (Heroic Symbols)&quot;. Dressed in his father&#x27;s Wehrmacht uniform, Kiefer mimicked the Nazi salute in various locations in France, Switzerland and Italy. He asked Germans to remember and to acknowledge the loss to their culture through the mad xenophobia of the Third Reich. In 1969, at Galerie am Kaiserplatz, Karlsruhe, he presented his first single exhibition &quot;Besetzungen (Occupations)&quot; with a series of photographs of controversial political actions.

===Painting and sculpture===
Kiefer is best known for his paintings, which have grown increasingly large in scale with additions of lead, broken glass, and dried flowers or plants. This results in encrusted surfaces and thick layers of impasto.

By 1970, while studying informally under Joseph Beuys at Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, his stylistic leanings resembled Georg Baselitz&#x27;s approach. He worked with glass, straw, wood and plant parts. The use of these materials meant that his art works became temporary and fragile, as Kiefer himself was well aware; he also wanted to showcase the materials in such a way that they were not disguised and could be represented in their natural form. The fragility of his work contrasts with the stark subject matter in his paintings. This use of familiar materials to express ideas was influenced by Beuys, who used fat and carpet felt in his works. It is also typical of the Neo-Expressionist style.

Kiefer returned to the area of his birthplace in 1971. In the years that followed, he incorporated German mythology in particular in his work, and in the next decade he studied the Kabbalah, as well as Qabalists like Robert Fludd. He went on extended journeys throughout Europe, the US and the Middle East; the latter two journeys further influenced his work. Besides paintings, Kiefer created sculptures, watercolors, photographs, and woodcuts, using woodcuts in particular to create a repertoire of figures he could reuse repeatedly in all media over the next decades, lending his work its knotty thematic coherence.

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Kiefer made numerous paintings, watercolors, woodcuts, and books on themes interpreted by Richard Wagner in his four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung).

In the early 1980s, he created more than thirty paintings, painted photographs, and watercolors that refer in their titles and inscriptions to the Romanian Jewish writer Paul Celan&#x27;s poem &quot;Todesfuge&quot; (&quot;Death Fugue&quot;).

A series of paintings which Kiefer executed between 1980 and 1983 depict looming stone edifices, referring to famous examples of National Socialist architecture, particularly buildings designed by Albert Speer and Wilhelm Kreis. The grand plaza in &quot;To the Unknown Painter&quot; (1983) specifically refers to the outdoor courtyard of Hitler&#x27;s Chancellery in Berlin, designed by Speer in 1938 in honor of the Unknown Soldier. In 1984–85, he made a series of works on paper incorporating manipulated black-and-white photographs of desolate landscapes with utility poles and power lines. Such works, like &quot;Heavy Cloud&quot; (1985), were an indirect response to the controversy in West Germany in the early 1980s about NATO&#x27;s stationing of tactical nuclear missiles on German soil and the placement of nuclear fuel processing facilities.

By the mid-1980s, Kiefer&#x27;s themes widened from a focus on Germany&#x27;s role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involved not only national identity and collective memory, but also occult symbolism, theology and mysticism. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life. During the 1980s his paintings became more physical, and featured unusual textures and materials. The range of his themes broadened to include references to ancient Hebrew and Egyptian history, as in the large painting &quot;Osiris and Isis&quot; (1985–87). His paintings of the 1990s, in particular, explore the universal myths of existence and meaning rather than those of national identity. From 1995 to 2001, he produced a cycle of large paintings of the cosmos.

Over the years Kiefer has made many unusual works, but one work stands out among the rest as particularly bizarre—that work being his 20 Years of Solitude piece. Taking over 20 years to create (1971–1991), 20 Years of Solitude is a ceiling-high stack of hundreds of white-painted ledgers and handmade books, strewn with dirt and dried vegetation, whose pages are stained with the artist&#x27;s semen. The word solitude in the title references the artists frequent masturbation onto paper during the 20 years it took to create. He asked American art critic Peter Schjeldahl to write a text for a catalog of the masturbation books. Schjeldahl attempted to oblige but ultimately failed in his endeavor. No other critic would take on the task, so the work has largely faded into obscurity.

He would shock the art world yet again at a dinner party in May 1993. Kiefer and his second wife, Renate Graf, decorated a candlelit commercial loft in New York with white muslin and skinned animals hanging on hooks above a floor carpeted with white sand, and staffed it with waiters dressed as mimes with white-face. A handful of art world elite, such as the likes of Sherrie Levine, were served several courses of arcane organ meats, such as pancreas, that were mostly white in color. Not surprisingly, the guests did not find the meal to be particularly appetizing. A group of NYC nightlife performers including Johanna Constantine, Lavinia Coop, Armen Ra and Flotilla DeBarge were hired to dress in white and mill about the West Village venue, Industria, and Anohni was hired to sing for Kiefer&#x27;s guests.

Since 2002, Kiefer has worked with concrete, creating the towers destined for the Pirelli warehouses in Milan, the series of tributes to Velimir Khlebnikov (paintings of the sea, with boats and an array of leaden objects, 2004–5), a return to the work of Paul Celan with a series of paintings featuring rune motifs (2004–06), and other sculptures. In 2003, he held his first solo show at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Salzburg Villa Katz, &quot;Anselm Kiefer: Am Anfang&quot; dedicated to a series of new works, centered on the recurring themes of history and myths. In 2005, he held his second exhibition in Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac&#x27;s Salzburg location, &quot;Für Paul Celan&quot; which focused on Kiefer&#x27;s preoccupation with the book, linking references to Germanic mythology with the poetry of Paul Celan, a German-speaking Jew from Czernowitz. The exhibition featured eleven works on canvas, a series of bound books shown in display cases, and five sculptures, including one powerful, monumental outdoor sculpture of reinforced concrete and lead elements, two leaden piles of books combined with bronze sunflowers, lead ships and wedges, and two monumental leaden books from the series The Secret Life of Plants. The exhibition toured to Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris and Galerie Yvon Lambert, Paris, the following year.

In 2006, Kiefer&#x27;s exhibition, &quot;Velimir Chlebnikov&quot;, was first shown in a small studio near Barjac, then moved to White Cube in London, then finishing in the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Connecticut. The work consists of 30 large (2 × 3 meters) paintings, hanging in two banks of 15 on facing walls of an expressly constructed corrugated steel building that mimics the studio in which they were created. The work refers to the eccentric theories of the Russian futurist philosopher/poet Velimir Chlebnikov, who invented a &quot;language of the future&quot; called &quot;Zaum&quot;, and who postulated that cataclysmic sea battles shift the course of history once every 317 years. In his paintings, Kiefer&#x27;s toy-like battleships—misshapen, battered, rusted and hanging by twisted wires—are cast about by paint and plaster waves. The work&#x27;s recurrent color notes are black, white, gray, and rust; and their surfaces are rough and slathered with paint, plaster, mud and clay.

In 2007, he became the first artist to be commissioned to install a permanent work at the Louvre, Paris, since Georges Braque some 50 years earlier. The same year, he inaugurated the Monumenta exhibitions series at the Grand Palais in Paris, with works paying special tribute to the poets Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann.

In 2009 Kiefer mounted two exhibitions at the White Cube gallery in London. A series of forest diptychs and triptychs enclosed in glass vitrines, many filled with dense Moroccan thorns, was titled &quot;Karfunkelfee&quot;, a term from German Romanticism stemming from a poem by the post-war Austrian writer Ingeborg Bachmann. In &quot;The Fertile Crescent&quot;, Kiefer presented a group of epic paintings inspired by a trip to India fifteen years earlier where he first encountered rural brick factories. Over the past decade, the photographs that Kiefer took in India &quot;reverberated&quot; in his mind to suggest a vast array of cultural and historical references, reaching from the first human civilization of Mesopotamia to the ruins of Germany in the aftermath of the Second World War, where he played as a boy. &quot;Anyone in search of a resonant meditation on the instability of built grandeur&quot;, wrote the historian Simon Schama in his catalogue essay, &quot;would do well to look hard at Kiefer&#x27;s &quot;The Fertile Crescent&quot;&quot;.

In &quot;Morgenthau Plan&quot; (2012), the gallery is filled with a sculpture of a golden wheat field, enclosed in a five-meter-high steel cage. That same year, Kiefer inaugurated Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac&#x27;s gallery space in Pantin, with an exhibition of monumental new works, &quot;Die Ungeborenen.&quot; The exhibition was accompanied by a publication with a letter by Anselm Kiefer and essays by Alexander Kluge and Emmanuel Daydé. He continues to be represented by the gallery and participates in group and solo exhibitions at their various locations.

===Books===
In 1969 Kiefer began to design books. Early examples are typically worked-over photographs; his more recent books consist of sheets of lead layered with paint, minerals, or dried plant matter. For example, he assembled numerous lead books on steel shelves in libraries, as symbols of the stored, discarded knowledge of history. The book &quot;Rhine&quot; (1981) comprises a sequence of 25 woodcuts that suggest a journey along the Rhine River; the river is central to Germany&#x27;s geographical and historical development, acquiring an almost mythic significance in works such as Wagner&#x27;s Ring of the Nibelungs. Scenes of the unspoiled river are interrupted by dark, swirling pages that represent the sinking of the battleship Bismarck in 1941, during an Atlantic sortie codenamed Rhine Exercise.

===Studios===
Kiefer&#x27;s first large studio was in the attic of his home, a former schoolhouse in Hornbach. Years later he installed his studio in a factory building in Buchen, near Hornbach. In 1988, Kiefer transformed a former brick factory in Höpfingen (also near Buchen) into an extensive artwork including numerous installations and sculptures. In 1991, after twenty years of working in the Odenwald, the artist left Germany to travel around the world—to India, Mexico, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the United States. In 1992 he established himself in Barjac, France, where he transformed his 35-hectare studio compound &quot;La Ribaute&quot; into a Gesamtkunstwerk. A derelict silk factory, his studio is enormous and in many ways is a comment on industrialization. He created an extensive system of glass buildings, archives, installations, storerooms for materials and paintings, subterranean chambers and corridors.

Sophie Fiennes filmed Kiefer&#x27;s studio complex in Barjac for her documentary study &quot;Over Your Cities Grass Will Grow&quot; (2010), which recorded both the environment and the artist at work. One critic wrote of the film: &quot;Building almost from the ground up in a derelict silk factory, Kiefer devised an artistic project extending over acres: miles of corridors, huge studio spaces with ambitious landscape paintings and sculptures that correspond to monumental constructions in the surrounding woodland, and serpentine excavated labyrinths with great earthy columns that resemble stalagmites or termite mounds. Nowhere is it clear where the finished product definitively stands; perhaps it is all work in progress, a monumental concept-art organism.&quot;

During 2008, Kiefer left his studio complex at Barjac and moved to Paris. A fleet of 110 lorries transported his work to a warehouse in Croissy-Beaubourg, outside of Paris, that had once been the depository for the La Samaritaine department store. A journalist wrote of Kiefer&#x27;s abandoned studio complex: &quot;He left behind the great work of Barjac – the art and buildings. A caretaker looks after it. Uninhabited, it quietly waits for nature to take over, because, as we know, over our cities grass will grow&quot;. Kiefer spent the summer of 2019 living and working at Barjac.&quot;

==Exhibitions==

In 1969, Kiefer had his first solo exhibition, at Galerie am Kaiserplatz in Karlsruhe. Along with Georg Baselitz, he represented Germany at the Venice Biennale in 1980. He was also featured in the 1997 Venice Biennale with a one-man show held at the Museo Correr, concentrating on paintings and books.

Comprehensive solo exhibitions of Kiefer&#x27;s work have been organized by the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf (1984); Art Institute of Chicago (1987); Sezon Museum of Art in Tokyo (1993); Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin (1991); Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (1998); Fondation Beyeler in Basel (2001); the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth (2005); the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington D.C. (2006); the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (2007). In 2007, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao presented an extensive survey of recent work. Several of his works were exhibited in 2009 for the first time in the Balearic Islands, in the museum Es Baluard in Palma de Mallorca. In 2012, the Art Gallery of Hamilton presented some of his paintings. London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Arts mounted the first British retrospective of the artist&#x27;s work in September 2014.

In 2007 Kiefer was commissioned to create a huge site-specific installation of sculptures and paintings for the inaugural &quot;Monumenta&quot; at the Grand Palais, Paris. With the unveiling of a triptych – the mural &quot;Athanor&quot; and the two sculptures &quot;Danae&quot; and &quot;Hortus Conclusus&quot; – at the Louvre in 2007, Kiefer became the first living artist to create a permanent site-specific installation in the museum since Georges Braque in 1953.

In 2008, Kiefer installed &quot;Palmsonntag (Palm Sunday)&quot; (2006), a monumental palm tree and 36 steel-and-glass reliquary tablets in the auditorium-gym of the First Baptist Church of Los Angeles, an enormous Spanish Gothic edifice built in 1927. The room was reconfigured to accommodate the work. Floors were sanded to remove the basketball court&#x27;s markings, and the wall for the reliquary paintings was constructed inside the space. In 2010 the piece was installed at the Art Gallery of Ontario museum in Toronto, where Kiefer created eight new panels specifically for the AGO&#x27;s exhibition of this work.

In &quot;Next Year in Jerusalem&quot; (2010) at Gagosian Gallery, Kiefer explained that each of the works was a reaction to a personal &quot;shock&quot; initiated by something he had recently heard of.

In September 2013, The Hall Art Foundation, in partnership with the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, opened a long-term installation of sculpture and paintings in a specifically repurposed, 10,000 square-foot building on the MASS MoCA campus. In 2014, the Foundation landscaped the area surrounding this building in order to present long-term installations of outdoor sculpture. The long-term exhibition—includes &quot;Étroits sont les Vaisseaux&quot; (&quot;Narrow are the Vessels&quot;) (2002), an 82-foot long, undulating wave-like sculpture made of cast concrete, exposed rebar, and lead; &quot;The Women of the Revolution&quot; (&quot;Les Femmes de la Revolution&quot;) (1992), composed of more than twenty lead beds with photographs and wall text; &quot;Velimir Chlebnikov&quot; (2004), a steel pavilion containing 30 paintings dealing with nautical warfare and inspired by the quixotic theories of the Russian mathematical experimentalist Velimir Chlebnikov; and a new, large-format photograph on lead created by the artist for the installation at MASS MoCA.

In 2015, the Centre Pompidou, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, and the Museum der bildenden Künste in Leipzig hosted a retrospective exhibition in honor of Kiefer&#x27;s 70th birthday.

In 2016 the Albertina in Vienna dedicated an exhibition to his woodcuts, showing 35 made between 1977 and 2015, with an accompanying catalogue.

He unveiled his first public art commission in the United States in May 2018, at Rockefeller Center. The &quot;Uraeus&quot; sculpture was inspired in part by the religious symbols of Egypt and &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;. It was put on view until 22 July.

==Recognition==
In 1990, Kiefer was awarded the Wolf Prize. In 1999 the Japan Art Association awarded him the Praemium Imperiale for his lifetime achievements. In the explanatory statement it reads:

&quot;A complex critical engagement with history runs through Anselm Kiefer&#x27;s work. His paintings as well as the sculptures of Georg Baselitz created an uproar at the 1980 Venice Biennale: the viewers had to decide whether the apparent Nazi motifs were meant ironically or whether the works were meant to convey actual fascist ideas. Kiefer worked with the conviction that art could heal a traumatized nation and a vexed, divided world. He created epic paintings on giant canvases that called up the history of German culture with the help of depictions of figures such as Richard Wagner or Goethe, thus continuing the historical tradition of painting as a medium of addressing the world. Only a few contemporary artists have such a pronounced sense of art&#x27;s duty to engage the past and the ethical questions of the present, and are in the position to express the possibility of the absolution of guilt through human effort.&quot;

In 2008, Kiefer was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, given for the first time to a visual artist. Art historian Werner Spies said in his speech that Kiefer is a passionate reader who takes impulses from literature for his work. In 2011 Kiefer was appointed to the chair of creativity in art at the Collège de France.

==Materials==
Due to the spontaneous nature of his creative process, many of his works have issues regarding stability—a concern shared by collectors, dealers, and curators alike. He acknowledges the issue, but says change is part of the process and that their essence will ultimately stay the same. This idea of transformation has a kind of appeal for Kiefer and thus is featured in many of his works. This fascination for the process may have stemmed from the artist&#x27;s keen interest in alchemy. He often chooses materials for their alchemical properties—lead in particular being chief among them. In the case of lead, he specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he would see many colors—especially that of gold—which he thought of in a symbolic sense as the gold sought by alchemists. He is also particularly fond of the oxidation of white on lead. He would often try to induce oxidation artificially with the use of acid to speed up the process. Lead was also associated with the alchemical concepts of magic numbers and represented the planet Saturn.

Shellac, another material popular in his work, corresponded to lead in terms of how he felt about its color and energy possibilities. He also liked that while being polished it takes on energy and becomes warm to the touch.

The use of straw in his work is also in part the result of this common theme of energy. Straw again features the color gold and gives off energy, heat, and warmth when burned. This would make way for new creation thus continuing the cycle of life through the transformation process.

==Art market==
The best selling painting for the artist was &quot;The Fertile Crescent&quot; (2009), which sold for $3,997,103 at the China Guardian action house, on 3 June 2019. The previous record belonged to the painting &quot;To the Unknown Painter&quot; (1983), sold by $3,554,500 at Christie&#x27;s New York, on 11 May 2011, to an American private collector. Previously, it was held by &quot;Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom&quot; (1999), who had sold by $3,549,350 at Christie&#x27;s London, on 8 February 2007.

<text>Baal Hammon, properly Baʿal Ḥamon (Phoenician and ), meaning &quot;Lord Hammon&quot;, was the chief god of ancient Carthage. He was a weather god considered responsible for the fertility of vegetation and esteemed as king of the gods. He was depicted as a bearded older man with curling ram&#x27;s horns. Baʿal Ḥammon&#x27;s female cult partner was Tanit. Baal Hammon was worshipped only in North Africa and Carthagenian colonies of the western mediterranean including Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands.

==Etymology==
The meaning of his first name &quot;Baal&quot; is identified as one of the Phoenician deities covered under the name of Baal. However, the meaning of his second name &quot;Hammon&quot; is a syncretic association with Amun, the god of ancient Libya whose temple was in Siwa Oasis where the only oracle of Amun remained in that part of the Libyan Desert all throughout the ages this connection to Amun, makes it possible to equate Baal Hammon lord of the sky to either Zeus or Cronos. Historians Crake &amp; Walbank dismiss a claim that Hammon meaning &quot;Brazier&quot; in ugarit which implies that Baal Hammon is equated to Apollo which is a solar deity, the original author of this claim describes his own conclusions as &quot;clearly very hypothetical&quot; 

Frank Moore also dismisses a hypothesis based on arguments presented for a connection to &quot;Hamōn&quot;, the Ugaritic name for Mount Amanus, a peak in the Nur Mountains that separate Syria from Cilicia, this connection makes Baal Hammon a Moon god which the author sees as another reason why this connection as insufficient.

==Cult and attributes==
The worship of Baʿal Hammon flourished in the Phoenician colony of Carthage. His supremacy among the Carthaginian gods is believed to date to the fifth century BC after relations between Carthage and Tyre were broken off at the time of the Battle of Himera (480 BC). Baal Hammon was known as the Chief of the pantheon of Carthage and the deity that made vegetation grow; as with most deities of Carthage, he was seemingly propitiated with child sacrifice, likely in times of strife or crisis, or only by elites, perhaps for the good of the whole community. This practice was recorded by Greeks and Romans, but dismissed as propaganda by modern scholars, until archeologists unearthed urns containing the cremated remains of infants in places of ritual sacrifice. Some scholars believe this confirms the accounts of child sacrifice, while others insist these are the remains of children who died young.

He has been identified with a solar deity, although Yigael Yadin thought him to be a moon god. Edward Lipiński identifies him with the god Dagon. In Carthage and North Africa, Baʿal Hammon was especially associated with the ram and was also worshiped as the horned deity Baʿal Qarnaim &quot;Lord of the Two Horns&quot; in an open-air sanctuary at Jebel Boukornine (&quot;the two-horned hill&quot;) across the bay from Carthage, in Tunisia.

The interpretatio graeca identified him with the Titan Cronus. In ancient Rome, he was identified with Saturn, and the cultural exchange between Rome and Carthage as a result of the Second Punic War may have influenced the development of the festival of Saturnalia.

. Attributes of his Romanized form as an African Saturn indicate that Hammon (&quot;Amunus&quot; in Philo&#x27;s work) was a fertility god.

==Legacy==
There is a survival in modern times in onomastics with some first names in use particularly in Tunisia grafted onto the name of the god. Algerian, Tunisian and many other spoken forms of Arabic refer to &quot; farming&quot; to refer to non-irrigated agriculture. Such usage is attested in Hebrew, a Canaanite language sister to Phoenician, already in the 2nd century CE Mishnah.

A street in modern Carthage, located near the Punic Ports, bears the name of &quot;Baal Hammon&quot;.

The city of Carmona (Andalusia, Spain) is believed to derive its name from &quot;Kar-Hammon&quot;, &quot;city of Hammon.&quot;

<text>Maribel Guardia (; born Maribel Del Rocío Fernández García on May 29, 1959) is a Costa Rica and Mexican actress and beauty pageant titleholder. She was the winner of Miss Costa Rica 1978 and a contestant in Miss Universe 1978.

==Miss Universe and Miss World==
Guardia was elected Miss Costa Rica in 1978, going on to represent her country at the Miss Universe 1978 beauty pageant (did not place but was selected as Miss Photogenic) and the Miss World 1978 beauty pageant (placed as a top 15 semi-finalist). The Miss Universe pageant had been held in Acapulco. She received offers by Televisa producer Sergio Bustamante to develop a career there, but she returned to her country. Months later, she accepted the offer and returned to Mexico, leaving her mother and boyfriend.

==Acting and singing career==
Guardia moved to Mexico in 1980, which proved crucial for her show business career. In 1980, she appeared in her first television show alongside Manuel &quot;El Loco&quot; Valdés.

Guardia went on to make multiple telenovelas (soap operas) and release a series of albums in the Norteño music genre. She has been signed to three different labels since her debut album was released in 1988: first with Musart Records, then from the late-1990s until the mid-2000s with Fonovisa Records, and in recent years with EMI Televisa Music in Latin America and Capitol Records in the United States.

Guardia has acted alongside important actors, including Andrés García, Saul Lisazo, and Joan Sebastian. One of her major soap opera hits was alongside Sebastian. Together, they filmed &quot;Tú y yo&quot;. One film where she acted alongside Andrés García was &quot;Pedro Navaja&quot;, where she played the main character&#x27;s wife. She also did a film called &quot;El Rey de Los Taxistas&quot; alongside Luis de Alba. She and another &quot;El Rey de Los Taxistas&quot; co-star, Aida Pierce, would work together again in the telenovela &quot;Serafin.&quot;

Additionally, she has done telenovelas for children. In 2006, she also did a sitcom called &quot;¡Qué madre tan padre!&quot; and the variety show &quot;Muévete.&quot; In 2007, she was included in the book &quot;Televisa Presenta,&quot; commemorating fifty years of network television in Mexico.

In 2008, she released a new album; the leading single is &quot;De Pecho A Pecho&quot; (&quot;From Chest To Chest&quot;) written by the Nicaraguan composer, songwriter, and singer Hernaldo Zúñiga. Apart from her acting and singing jobs, she has also modeled for various calendars and magazines sold to her fans. Guardia also dated Jose Trujillo in the late 1970s.

Since late 2010, she has married Marco Chacón and lived with her son in Mexico City. Guardia has been inducted into the Paseo de las Luminarias in Mexico City.

In January 2010, she announced that she had worked all of 2009 on a new studio album, set to be released on February 13, 2010, under EMI Music, titled &quot;Move You On – Muévete&quot;, which contained 12 tracks recorded in Mexico City, Texas &amp; Colombia, eight tracks were in Spanish, the other four were in English.

==Personal life==
Guardia lived with Joan Sebastian for five years and had a son with him, Julián Figueroa. In her personal life, Maribel Guardia has faced various challenges. Julián Figueroa followed in his parents&#x27; footsteps and pursued a music career. On 9 April 2023, Julián Figueroa was found dead at his home at the age of 27. Maribel Guardia has been married to Marco Chacón since 2010.

<doc id="836921" wikidata="Q4837122" url="?curid=836921" title="Baal-gad">
<text>Baal-Gad was a Canaanite town at the foot of Mount Hermon. It is mentioned in the Bible three times, all of them in the Book of Joshua (Josh. 11:17; 12:7; 13:5). In all cases, it is described as the northernmost point of Joshua&#x27;s conquests. The name may relate to Gad, a Semitic deity of fortune, but more likely simply refers to Baal with the epithet “of fortune”.

==Identification==
The exact location of Baal-gad is uncertain, but it is generally accepted as being in the vicinity of Wadi al-Taym in southeastern Lebanon. The earliest suggestions identified it with Banias or Baalbek, while Abel suggested identifying it with Hasbaya. However, archeological evidence suggests that neither Banias nor Hasbaya were inhabited before the Hellenistic period, while Baalbek is too far north to fit with the geographical details in Joshua. Simons proposes identifying Baal-Gad with the site of Tell Haush/Tell ez-Zeitun, a small tell just north of Haouch El-Qenaabeh (about 8.5 kilometers southwest of Rachaiya and 12 kilometers north of Hasbaya). Jericke accepts this identification, as Tell Haush/Tell ez-Zeitun is the only site with Late Bronze Age and Iron Age remains between (near Marjayoun) to the south and Kumidi to the north.

<text>In linguistic typology, time–manner–place is a sentence structure that defines the order of adpositional phrases and adverbs in a sentence: &quot;yesterday&quot;, &quot;by car&quot;, &quot;to the store&quot;. Japanese, Afrikaans, Dutch, Mandarin, and German use this structure.

An example of this appositional ordering in German is:

The temporal phrase – &#x27; (when? – &quot;today&quot;) – comes first, the manner –&#x27; (how? – &quot;by car&quot;) – is second, and the place – &quot;&quot; (where? – &quot;to Munich&quot;) – is third.

<doc id="836931" wikidata="Q737435" url="?curid=836931" title="Sergei Shamba">
<text>Sergei Shamba (, ) is a senior politician from Abkhazia. He is currently a member of the People&#x27;s Assembly of Abkhazia and Chairman of United Abkhazia. He was Prime Minister of Abkhazia under President Sergei Bagapsh from 13 February 2010 until 27 September 2011. Between 1997 and 2010 he had been Minister for Foreign Affairs under both Bagapsh and his predecessor Vladislav Ardzinba, with only a half-year interruption in 2004. Shamba has twice unsuccessfully participated in presidential elections, in 2004 and 2011. He has been a staunch proponent for dialogue between Abkhazia and Georgia.

==Early life and career==
Sergei Shamba was born on 15 March 1951 in Gudauta. He entered politics at the age of 24. Until February 1992, Shamba was the head of Aidgylara, which played a leading role in Abkhazia&#x27;s struggle for independence. During the 1992-1993 War in Abkhazia, he served as First Deputy Minister of Defence.

==Minister for Foreign Affairs (first time)==
On 7 May 1997, Shamba became Minister for Foreign Affairs, succeeding Konstantin Ozgan. Throughout his time as foreign minister, it often fell to Shamba to defend Abkhazia&#x27;s separation from Georgia in the international media. He has been a strong supporter of Abkhazian independence, and has flatly opposed any attempts at reunification with Georgia. Though he has headed several Abkhaz delegations to United Nations-sponsored talks with Georgia, Abkhazia has failed to receive any international recognition.

As foreign minister, Shamba dealt with several leaders of non-government organizations, meeting, among others, International Red Crescent Organization president Jean Michel Corbot. He succeeded in gaining USAID assistance for several reconstruction projects in Sukhumi.

In 1998, Shamba received his Doctorate from the Yerevan Institute of Archeology. On 9 July 2001, Shamba was awarded the diplomatic rank of Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador.

Shamba resigned from the post of foreign minister on June 14, 2004, citing a number of reasons, such as the murder, five days before, of fellow opposition leader Garri Aiba and the upcoming presidential elections. After his resignation, he openly called for the entire government to stand aside.

==October 2004 presidential election==

Shamba was one of the favorites to receive the nomination of the newly forged Amtsakhara-United Abkhazia opposition alliance for the October 2004 presidential elections. However, on July 20, 2004, the movements named former prime minister Sergei Bagapsh and Stanislav Lakoba as their respective presidential and vice presidential candidates. Shamba still participated in the election with Vladimir Arshba as his running mate and he came in third place with 6.9% of the vote. After the election a conflict broke between front runners Sergei Bagapsh and Raul Khajimba, which was only resolved when the two teams agreed to hold new elections in which they would participate on a joint ticket.

During the crisis on 15 October Shamba had founded the Social-Democratic Party of Abkhazia along with other people from his election campaign, chief of staff Gennadi Alamia became its first chairman. The Social-Democratic Party called on voters to boycott the new elections and Shamba did not participate in it.

==Minister for Foreign Affairs (second time) and Prime Minister==

On 15 December 2004 Shamba had again been appointed Minister for Foreign affairs by Ardzinba, replacing Igor Akhba. The power-sharing agreement between Bagapsh and Khajimba stipulated that the latter could appoint the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Khajimba chose to keep Sergei Shamba, despite the fact that Bagapsh long insisted on appointing Natella Akaba. Even though Shamba had now joined the government, the social-democratic party stayed in opposition.

On 20 May 2009 the Social-Democratic Party was one of a number of opposition parties that during a press conference strongly criticised the government&#x27;s foreign policy. The criticism was rejected by Shamba two days later, dismissing it as &quot;biased&quot;.

Despite being considered by some to again be a possible candidate, Shamba did not participate in the December 2009 presidential election. The election resulted in a second term for Sergei Bagapsh, and on 13 February 2010, Shamba was appointed prime minister, succeeding Alexander Ankvab, who had become vice president. On 26 February Shamba was succeeded as Foreign Minister by his deputy Maxim Gvinjia.

==August 2011 presidential election and retirement from active politics==
The next presidential election was originally scheduled to take place in 2014, however, the Constitution of Abkhazia required an election to be held within three months after the unexpected death of incumbent president Sergei Bagapsh on 29 May 2011. Only three candidates participated: Shamba, outgoing Vice President and Acting President Alexander Ankvab and opposition leader Raul Khajimba. Shamba&#x27;s vice presidential candidate was deputy chairman of the State Committee for Youth Affairs and Sport Shamil Adzynba. The pair was nominated by an initiative group on 8 July and applied for registration on 16 July. All presidential candidates passed their Abkhaz language test on 20 July 2011, were formally registered by the Central Election Commission on 25 July and received their certificates on 26 July.

Shamba and Adzynba received political support from the Party for Economic Development on 21 July, 10 (out of 12) members of the Association of Youth Organisations on 28 July and the Communist Party 9 August. The election campaign was led by Beslan Eshba.

The election was won by Alexander Ankvab. Shamba came in second place with 21.02% of the vote, narrowly ahead of Khajimba.

After the election, Shamba retired from active politics. Observers noted that Shamba would have been above the legal maximum age for the Presidency at the time of the next election. Shamba himself has stated that he wanted to make way for younger politicians, hoping that Abkhazia had entered a new phase of sustained development and conflict-free transfers of power.

==Member of Parliament (second time) and Chairman of United Abkhazia==

Shamba was one of the leaders of the protests that led to the May 2014 ouster of President Ankvab. After the election of Raul Khajimba as president, he participated in the 21 December by-election in Constituency no. 24 that had become necessary after Khajimba had appointed Adgur Kharazia as acting mayor of Sukhumi. On 3 November, Shamba&#x27;s nomination by an initiative group was registered. Shamba failed to obtain a first-round victory, but defeated Tengiz Agrba in the run-off on 28 December.

On 5 September 2015, Shamba became the leader of a faction he established along with six other members of the People&#x27;s Assembly.

On 27 January 2016, Shamba was elected Chairman of United Abkhazia during its sixth congress, after Daur Tarba had resigned the role on 1 October 2015.

<text>James Bovard (; born 1956) is an American libertarian author and lecturer whose political commentary targets examples of waste, failures, corruption, cronyism and abuses of power in government. He is a &quot;USA Today&quot; columnist and is a frequent contributor to &quot;The Hill&quot;. He is the author of &quot;Attention Deficit Democracy&quot; and nine other books. He has written for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;New Republic&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, and many other publications. His books have been translated into Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, and Korean.

==Early life==
He has written &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; articles about his experiences as a shiftless highway worker and a one-season Santa Claus. His early career was summarized in a 1988 &quot;National Journal&quot; profile headlined, &quot;A Free-Lance Crab Apple Shaking the Federal Tree&quot;.

==Views==
In 2017, Bovard criticized President Donald Trump for the missile strike in Syria and referred to it as his &quot;biggest foreign folly.&quot; Bovard writes, &quot;Four years ago, Trump warned in a tweet: &#x27;If the U.S. attacks Syria and hits the wrong targets, killing civilians, there will be worldwide hell to pay.&#x27; But the Trump administration has sharply increased U.S. bombing while curtailing restrictions that sought to protect innocents. A British-based human rights monitoring group estimated Friday that U.S.-led coalition strikes had killed almost 500 civilians in the past month—more than any month since U.S. bombing began. A United Nations commission of inquiry concluded that coalition airstrikes have caused a &#x27;staggering loss of civilian life.&#x27;&quot; He also stated that &quot;Trump&#x27;s most dangerous innovation involves direct attacks on Syrian government forces.&quot;

In 2018, Bovard was critical of Trump, saying that he &quot;has said and done many things to appall the friends of freedom. From Trump&#x27;s pro-torture comments to his praise of police brutality to his cruise-missile barrage against Syria to his threat to annihilate North Korea, there are ample signs that he scorns a freedom-and-peace posture.&quot;

Bovard is a critic of the Transportation Security Administration, writing that &quot;the TSA has a long history of intimidation. In 2002, it created a system of fines to penalize travelers with bad attitudes, charging up to $1,500 for any alleged &#x27;nonphysical interference.&#x27; This included any &#x27;situation that in any way would interfere with the screener and his or her ability to continue to work or interfere with their ability to do their jobs,&#x27; according to a spokeswoman. The TSA failed to specify exactly how much groveling was necessary and eventually abandoned the regime of fines.&quot; He also criticized the TSA&#x27;s watchlist and concluded that &quot;the TSA&#x27;s latest anti-privacy charade is yet more evidence that the agency should be done away with. After pointlessly groping countless Americans, the TSA has no excuse for groping more.&quot;

==Media mentions==
George Will, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, called Bovard &quot;a one-man truth squad&quot;. A 1999 book review in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; called him &quot;the roving inspector general of the modern state&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2007 called Bovard &quot;an anti-czar czar.&quot; A &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist on criminal justice referred in 2017 to the &quot;great writer and civil liberties advocate James Bovard&quot;. He discussed the War on Terror in a one-hour interview on CSPAN&#x27;s &quot;Washington Journal&quot; in 2016.

==Bibliography==
* &quot;The Farm Fiasco&quot;. ICS Press, 1989. &quot;Reason&quot; magazine declared, &quot;Over the past few years Bovard, in a series of newspaper and magazine articles, has contributed more than anyone to the public&#x27;s understanding of our farm program madness. With this book, he presents the ultimate Everyman&#x27;s defense of a free market in agriculture.&quot; The Washington Post noted, &quot;Although [The Farm Fiasco] may sound like a critique of Soviet farm policy, in fact it is American programs at which James Bovard has taken aim.&quot;
* A Wall Street Journal review declared, &quot;Bovard offers a smashing condemnation of American trade policy and exposes the corrupt core of protectionism and the absurdity of Congress making trade more &#x27;fair&#x27; by making it less &#x27;free&#x27;. ... (shows) how arbitrary and ultimately counterproductive and restrictive our trade practices are.&quot;
* A Wall Street Journal review declared, &quot;Bovard&#x27;s unrivaled research has resulted in a virtual encyclopedia of modern government abuse.&quot; The American Spectator declared, &quot;A remarkable book – 400 densely packed pages about the mounting war on property and contract, the tyranny of taxation, and the growth of federal power in the guise of expanding our rights. In this field, Bovard is surely the leading researcher in the country... brilliant.&quot; In a 1998 Vanity Fair article on &quot;Shredding the Bill of Rights,&quot; novelist Gore Vidal quoted extensively from the book, &quot;In James Bovard&#x27;s 1994 book, Lost Rights, the author has assembled a great deal of material on just what our law enforcers are up to in the never-to-be-won wars against Drugs and Terrorism, as they do daily battle with the American people in their homes and cars, on buses and planes, indeed, wherever they can get at them, by hook or by crook or by sting.&quot; A 2012 National Review article declared, &quot;Lost Rights exposé of the threat posed by an emerging bureaucratic police state remains a true classic.&quot; The book won the 1995 Mencken Award for Best Book. 
* (1996) &quot;Shakedown&quot;
* &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; labeled &quot;Freedom in Chains&quot; &quot;a chilling indictment of the U.S. government.&quot; The Wall Street Journal declared, &quot;Never has so much theoretical error and concrete folly been collected and juxtaposed so well under a single cover. Mr. Bovard consistently illuminates the connection between faulty political ideals and specific policy disasters.&quot; Publishers Weekly declared, &quot;Bovard is well-read and makes entertaining use of Rousseau, Hegel, Hobbes (he&#x27;s very fond of Leviathan) and other thinkers. He&#x27;s also consistent and intellectually honest enough to follow his own ideology to its logical conclusion about, for instance, marijuana (legalize it, he says). Few readers will agree with Bovard that the dominant spirit in America today is one that idolizes the state, but most will find that he makes a rousing theoretical case against statism.&quot;
* A Wall Street Journal review declared, &quot;Feeling Your Pain is an eloquent and blistering indictment of the politicians and bureaucrats who, armed with taxpayer dollars and the coercive power of law, have done so much damage to individual lives, and society at large, in recent years.&quot; Insight Magazine commented, &quot;In his powerful new book &#x27;feeling your pain,&#x27; free-lance investigative reporter James Bovard takes on the whole eight years of the Clinton/Gore era and details the administration&#x27;s misuse of power and its enormously successful effort to expand the role of government in our lives.&quot;
* A &quot;Boston Globe&quot; review declared &quot;&quot;Terrorism and Tyranny is a scathing account of the war on terrorism... Bovard is a bipartisan scourge... His lively fury at government incompetence keeps the pages turning quickly... Most riveting.&quot; Publishers Weekly declared, &quot;Journalist Bovard, who has written for the &#x27;Wall Street Journal&#x27; and &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, among others, looks at the post–September 11 policies and actions of the government and finds them sorely lacking... Meticulously documented from contemporary news accounts, this rant against Bush&#x27;s &quot;aura of righteousness&quot; may well leave readers as angry as its author.&quot; &#x27;The Washington Times&#x27; declared, &quot;The author has synthesized and organized a vast amount of information, yet he presents it in an accessible, reader-friendly way. It is rare to read such a well-documented study that flows so smoothly... Terrorism and Tyranny&quot; is a timely, troubling book, exhaustively and impeccably researched and documented.&quot; The Washington Post noted, &quot;The controversial author of Feeling Your Pain takes on Bush, the war with Iraq and the official drive to protect &#x27;the homeland.&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; declared, &quot;Writing from a libertarian perspective, Bovard (Terrorism and Tyranny, etc.) offers a fierce critique of the presidency of George W. Bush, focusing on restrictions on liberty and expansion of government... It is notable as a comprehensive attack on the administration from a less-often-heard place on the political spectrum.&quot; An American Conservative review declared, &quot;With the thoroughly researched and footnoted style that has become his forte, and with the heavy doses of relevant anecdotes and dry humor that have become his trademarks, the author has compiled a virtual almanac of American political abuse.&quot;
* The American Conservative declared, &quot;In nine books and hundreds of articles, the libertarian muckraker James Bovard has returned repeatedly to three themes: government repression, government incompetence, and government deceit. All three go under the microscope in his newest tome, Attention Deficit Democracy, but the focus is on the deceit-and, even more, on the deceived.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; declared, &quot;Bovard describes problems in painstaking detail... those looking for a rousing refresher on the merits of skepticism will find it here in spades.&quot;

<text>The MEKO family of warships was developed by the German company Blohm+Voss. MEKO is a registered trademark. The portmanteau stands for &quot;&quot;Mehrzweck-Kombination&quot;&quot; (English: multi-purpose-combination). It is a concept in modern naval shipbuilding based on modularity of armament, electronics and other equipment, aiming at ease of maintenance and cost reduction.

MEKO ships include families of frigates, corvettes and ocean-going patrol boats. Construction of MEKO ships began in the late 1970s with the design and later building of Nigeria&#x27;s MEKO 360 H1. Vessels of similar classes use different weapons systems. For example, for the main gun, some MEKO 200s use the Mk 45 Mod 2 gun, others use the French 100 mm naval gun or Otobreda 76 mm gun.

The latest variant is the &quot;Combat Ship for the Littorals&quot; or MEKO CSL. It has also been called a &quot;Littoral Combatant Ship&quot;, but it is much smaller than the American Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). There was speculation that this design would be of interest to Israel, but it was not. Ultimately however, Israel opted for four modified K130 &quot;Braunschweig&quot;-class corvettes, the first of which is expected to enter service in 2019. The new variant is dubbed the . Eight extended versions of MEKO A-100 frigate vessels are planned to be supplied for the Brazilian Navy. The consortium is formed by Germany&#x27;s Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, Embraer Defense &amp; Security and Atech, a subsidiary of the Embraer Group. The construction of the vessels, which are more than 100 meters long, are planned for the Oceana shipyard in Itajaí.

== Models ==
The following MEKO models are known to have been built, organized by lineage and delivery dates:
* MEKO 360 (1981) is the earliest MEKO ship.
* MEKO 140 (1985) is designed as a companion ship of MEKO 360, developed from the Portuguese &quot;João Coutinho&quot; class corvettes.
* MEKO 200 (1987) is a frigate design. It evolved into the MEKO A-200 (2001) and the larger MEKO A-300 (planned for Greece and Poland).
* F123 (1994), F124 (2002), and F125 (2016) are a line of MEKO frigates developed for the German Navy.
* K130 (2008) is a corvette designed for the German Navy using some F124 technology.
** Israeli Sa&#x27;ar 6 (2021) is a heavily modified descendant.
* MEKO A-100 (2019) is a current design.
** The 2012 A-100 is a single corvette developed from the A-200. It is occasionally quoted as the same as the MEKO 100 RMN (2004).
** The current design is a family of three sizes (all heavier and longer than the 2012 A-100): corvette, light frigate, patrol corvette.

, the MEKO website showcases A-200, F125, and A-100 models. The following models were once mentioned on the website, but no examples are known to have been built:

* MEKO CSL (2012 website).
* MEKO D Corvette (2012 website).
* MEKO 100 patrol corvette (2012 website). Based on both K130 and MEKO 100 patrol vessel.
* MEKO A-300 frigate based on A-200 and F-125 offered to Greece and Poland
* MEKO A-400 AMD

<doc id="836992" wikidata="Q4749782" url="?curid=836992" title="An American in Canada">
<text>An American in Canada is a Canadian television sitcom that aired on CBC Television in 2003 and 2004.

The show starred Rick Roberts as Jake Crewe, an American television news host who was forced, after beating up his station manager, to accept a job in Calgary, Alberta as co-host of the lowest-rated morning news program in the city. The show found its comedy in Crewe&#x27;s attempts to adapt to Canadian culture, as well as his interactions with coworkers such as producer and love interest Judy Surgick (Hélène Joy) and egotistical host Dennis McIlvane (Stewart Francis).

&quot;An American in Canada&quot; was loosely based on the real-life experiences of Jebb Fink, an American comedian who moved to Canada after marrying a Canadian woman, and did become a morning television host on CKAL-TV, Calgary&#x27;s A-Channel station. It was created by Fink and Howard Busgang.

The show&#x27;s pilot aired as a special in January 2002 as part of the CBC&#x27;s early-2000s strategy of airing comedy pilots to test viewer reaction before ordering the production of a full series. Viewer reaction was overwhelmingly positive, and the series went into production and premiered in 2003. The show produced 16 episodes over two seasons before being cancelled in 2004.

The program won the Gemini Award for Best Comedy Program or Series at the 17th Gemini Awards.

It has also aired on Australia&#x27;s The Comedy Channel with the title &quot;Frostbite&quot;, and in syndication on Showcase in Canada and HDNet in the USA.

<text>Miguel dos Anjos da Cunha Lisboa Trovoada (born 27 December 1936) was the prime minister from 1975 to 1979 and second president of São Tomé and Príncipe 1991 to 2001. On 16 July 2014, he was appointed the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS). Prior to this, he was the executive secretary of the Gulf of Guinea Commission.

==Background==
Born in the city of São Tomé, Trovoada attended secondary school in Angola before studying law at the University of Lisbon in Portugal. In 1960 he cofounded, with former classmate Manuel Pinto da Costa, the Committee for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (CLSTP) - which was renamed the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe in 1972. Operating out of its headquarters in Gabon, Trovoada served as the movement&#x27;s foreign affairs director from 1961 to 1975 and was instrumental in gaining Organization of African Unity (OAU) recognition for the MLSTP in 1972.

After the fall of the Estado Novo regime in Portugal due to the Carnation Revolution, Trovoada served as the São Tomé and Príncipe first Prime Minister (12 July 1975 - March 1979). However, relations between the President and Prime Minister soon deteriorated, culminating in 1979 when President da Costa abolished the post of Prime Minister. Several months later, Trovoada was charged with plotting against the government. After being arrested and detained for 21 months, Trovoada went into exile in France. In May 1990, following the adoption of a democratic constitution, he returned to his country and campaigned for president.

In 1991, Trovoada was elected President in the country&#x27;s first multiparty presidential election; he was re-elected in 1996. When he first ran for President, he was not a member of any political party, but by the end of his first term he had formed a new political party - Independent Democratic Action (ADI).

His government was briefly overthrown in a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; from 15 August 1995 to 21 August 1995.

President Trovoada&#x27;s term ended on 3 September 2001 when Fradique de Menezes was sworn in as the new head of state.

Trovoada took office as executive secretary of the Gulf of Guinea Commission on 21 January 2009.

Miguel Trovoada&#x27;s son Patrice Trovoada is also a politician and served as Prime Minister of São Tomé and Príncipe in 2008.

<doc id="837092" wikidata="Q959811" url="?curid=837092" title="Koshien Stadium">
<text>, commonly referred to as simply Koshien Stadium, is a baseball park located near Kobe in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. The stadium was built to host the national high school baseball tournaments, and opened on 1 August 1924. It was the largest stadium in Asia at the time it was completed, with a capacity of 55,000.

The name comes from &quot;Wood Rat&quot; of the sexagenary cycle system. The year of the stadium&#x27;s founding, 1924, was the first year in the cycle. The design of the stadium was heavily influenced by the Polo Grounds in New York City. In 1936 it became the home stadium for the Osaka Tigers (current Hanshin Tigers), now with the Central League. On 14 February 1964, Hanshin, the Tigers&#x27; owners, was appended to the name of Koshien Stadium.

In addition to the annual National High School Baseball Championship, played in August, the stadium hosts the annual National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in March, a smaller, invitational tournament. Both tournaments are generally known simply as &quot;Kōshien&quot;. The high school tournaments are given a higher priority, with any tournament games that need to be rescheduled forcing the Tigers to postpone conflicting home games. It also hosts Japan&#x27;s American college football national championship game, the Koshien Bowl.

Legendary baseball player Babe Ruth played an exhibition game at Koshien on his Japan tour in 1934. There is a plaque at the stadium commemorating the event.

==Repairs==
The Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995 affected Kōshien. Cracks appeared and part of the stands collapsed. In July 2004, a concrete plan surfaced for improvement of the complete baseball ground facilities.

Construction began during the off-season of 2008 while the stadium continued to be used for baseball. Later stages followed during the off-season, and the large-scale construction was completed in 2010.

The main points of the plan are as follows:
* As much as possible, the present conditions of the baseball grounds are to be preserved, including the Wrigley Field-inspired ivy, which has become a symbol of the stadium.
* The infield continues to be all-dirt.
* The outfield continues to be natural grass and be open to the air (no roof over the grounds).
* The Ginsan roof over the grandstand was removed and replaced with a modern Ginsan roof without pillars.
* The seating capacity was reduced to 47,808 people to help make the stadium barrier-free.

==Price ranges==

The stadium has four seating price ranges.

The top seats are the green seats (sold in season tickets) directly behind home plate and under the Ginsan roof. These seats are entirely covered and corporate. The seats in the infield are colored green on the first base side and the third base side under the Ginsan roof and called &quot;Ivy Seat&quot;. Both sides are ¥4,000. The outfield benches along the lines are called the &quot;Alps&quot; and they are ¥2,500. The outfield seats are ¥1,900.

As with all Japanese stadiums, the home supporters sit in right field and the away supporters in left field. However, even if the opponents are the Yomiuri Giants, the away supporters rarely constitute more than one section high up in left field. On most nights the stadium is jam-packed with cramped seating.

==Appearances in fiction==
Due to its reputation as the main stage of high school baseball, Koshien plays a big part in many baseball manga series, including &quot;Touch&quot;, &quot;Cross Game&quot; and &quot;H2&quot; by Mitsuru Adachi and in other author&#x27;s works like Higuchi Asa&#x27;s &quot;Ōkiku Furikabutte&quot; and &quot;Rookies&quot; by Masanori Morita and &quot;Ace of Diamond&quot; by Yuji Terajima. It was talked about in &quot;Major&quot; where Koshien is the aim of all high school baseball teams to play there.

The park plays a part, in name, in the anime &quot;Princess Nine&quot;. The events of the two-hour &quot;Detective Conan&quot; special episode &quot;Miracle at Koshien Ball Park! The Defiants Face the Dark Demon&quot; take place in the stadium. In the light novel and anime adaptation of &quot;Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot; (specifically the episode &quot;Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Part 5&quot;), Haruhi&#x27;s explanation of why she searches for the supernatural involves a baseball game she viewed with her family in Koshien.

The stadium appears as a stage in the fighting game &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot;, crowded and adapted for the &quot;KOF&quot; tournament, with the fighters standing on a catwalk-like structure. In &quot;Nodame Cantabile&quot;, the heroine Megumi Noda kept a bag of soil from Koshien Stadium. In &quot;Angel Beats!&quot; Hinata says he was part of a baseball team that was aiming to play in Koshien. In &quot;Silver Spoon&quot;, Ichiro Komaba is determined to get his baseball team to Koshien to go pro and make money for his family farm.

In an episode of the &quot;Netflix&quot; anime series &quot;Devilman Crybaby&quot; it is featured as the arena for a track and field event.

It is the home stadium for Osaka Tempters in Gurazeni.

==Access==
Koshien Stadium is a two-minute walk from Koshien Station on the Hanshin Main Line. There is no parking lot at the stadium. Regular television commercials during game broadcasts encourage the public to use public transportation.

He was also nominated for Best Picture for producing &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1962). Additionally, he was a BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, and Directors Guild of America Award nominee. 

Pakula&#x27;s films often dealt with psychological and political themes. His &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary stated Pakula made &quot;different kinds of movies, all of them intended to entertain, but the thread connecting many of them was a style that emphasized and explored the psychology and motivations of his characters.&quot; He was the subject of the 2023 documentary, &quot;Alan Pakula: Going for Truth&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Pakula was born in The Bronx, New York, to Polish Jewish parents, Jeanette (née Goldstein) and Paul Pakula. He was educated at The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and Yale University, where he majored in drama.

==Career==
Pakula started his Hollywood career as an assistant in the cartoon department at Warner Bros. In 1957, he undertook his first production role for Paramount Pictures. In 1962, he produced &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Pakula had a successful professional relationship as the producer of movies directed by &quot;Mockingbird&quot; director Robert Mulligan from 1957 to 1968. In 1969, he directed his first feature, &quot;The Sterile Cuckoo&quot;, starring Liza Minnelli.

=== Paranoia trilogy ===
In 1971, Pakula released the first installment of what would informally come to be known as his &quot;paranoia trilogy&quot;. &quot;Klute&quot;, the story of a relationship between a private eye (played by Donald Sutherland) and a call girl (played by Jane Fonda, who won an Oscar for her performance), was a commercial and critical success. This was followed in 1974 by &quot;The Parallax View&quot; starring Warren Beatty, a labyrinthine post-Watergate thriller involving political assassinations. The film has been noted for its experimental use of hypnotic imagery in a celebrated film-within-a-film sequence in which the protagonist is inducted into the Parallax Corporation, whose main, although secret, enterprise is domestic terrorism.

Finally, in 1976, Pakula rounded out the &quot;trilogy&quot; with &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, based on the bestselling account of the Watergate scandal written by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, played by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, respectively. It was another commercial hit, considered by many critics and fans to be one of the best thrillers of the 1970s.

=== Subsequent films ===
Pakula scored another hit in 1982 with &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;, starring Meryl Streep. His screenplay, based on the novel by William Styron, was nominated for an Academy Award. Later commercial successes included &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot;, based on the bestselling novel by Scott Turow, and &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;, an adaptation of John Grisham&#x27;s bestseller. His final film was the thriller &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot;, where he reunited with Harrison Ford.

==Personal life==
From October 19, 1963, until 1971, Pakula was married to actress Hope Lange. He was married to his second wife, author Hannah Pakula (formerly Hannah Cohn Boorstin) from 1973 until his death in 1998.

He had two stepchildren from his marriage with Hope Lange, Christopher and Patricia Murray, and three stepchildren from his second marriage. They are Louis, Robert, and Anna Boorstin. He also spoke very openly about his stepson&#x27;s battle with depression.

===Death===
On November 19, 1998, Pakula was driving on the Long Island Expressway in Melville, New York, when a driver in front of him hit a metal pipe, causing it to crash through Pakula’s windshield and strike him in the head. His car swerved off the road and into a fence. He was taken to North Shore University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

<doc id="837147" wikidata="Q1516105" url="?curid=837147" title="V2 word order">
<text>In syntax, verb-second (V2) word order is a sentence structure in which the finite verb of a sentence or a clause is placed in the clause&#x27;s second position, so that the verb is preceded by a single word or group of words (a single constituent).

Examples of V2 in English include (brackets indicating a single constituent):
* &quot;Neither do I&quot;, &quot;[Never in my life] have I seen such things&quot;
If English used V2 in all situations, then it would feature such sentences as: 
* &quot;*[In school] learned I about animals&quot;, &quot;*[When she comes home from work] takes she a nap&quot;

V2 word order is common in the Germanic languages and is also found in Northeast Caucasian Ingush, Uto-Aztecan O&#x27;odham, and fragmentarily in Romance Sursilvan (a Rhaeto-Romansh variety) and Finno-Ugric Estonian. Of the Germanic family, English is exceptional in having predominantly SVO order instead of V2, although there are vestiges of the V2 phenomenon.

Most Germanic languages do not normally use V2 order in embedded clauses, with a few exceptions. In particular, German, Dutch, and Afrikaans revert to VF (verb final) word order after a complementizer; Yiddish and Icelandic do, however, allow V2 in all declarative clauses: main, embedded, and subordinate. Kashmiri (an Indo-Aryan language) has V2 in &#x27;declarative content clauses&#x27; but VF order in relative clauses.

==Examples==
The example sentences in (1) from German illustrate the V2 principle, which allows any constituent to occupy the first position as long as the second position is occupied by the finite verb. Sentences (1a) through to (1d) have the finite verb &quot;spielten&quot; &#x27;played&#x27; in second position, with various constituents occupying the first position: in (1a) the subject is in first position; in (1b) the object is; in (1c) the temporal modifier is in first position; and in (1d) the locative modifier is in first position. 


In this example, English is more straightforward to compare to a North Germanic language:
The same inversions occur regularly in the North Germanic languages, and in Dutch, for that matter,
but English uses the North Germanic word order apart from having lost the inversions in common use.
If the same example in Norwegian were translated to English with the inversions intact:



The caveat here (unlike in German) is that in languages without grammatical case, the form with the object first (2b) can only be used unambiguously when the object is unmistakable from the subject, such as if it is a personal pronoun, or as in this example, cannot meaningfully be the subject.
In speech, such inversions are usually marked with emphasis: Apart from inversions that are obligatory in their grammatical context, such as &quot;jeg tenker, derfor er jeg&quot; (I think, &quot;therefore am I&quot;), when an inversion occurs for no other reason than emphasis, which is what opens up for possible ambiguity, the word in the emphasized position before the verb is usually also emphasized in speech.

== Classical accounts ==
In major theoretical research on V2 properties, researchers discussed that verb-final orders found in German and Dutch embedded clauses suggest an underlying SOV order with specific syntactic movement rules which change the underlying SOV order, deriving a surface form where the finite verb is in the second position of the clause.

We first see a &quot;verb preposing&quot; rule, which moves the finite verb to the left-most position in the sentence, then a &quot;constituent preposing&quot; rule, which moves a constituent in front of the finite verb. Following these two rules will always result with the finite verb in second position. &quot;I like the man&quot;:

 → Underlying form in modern German

 → Verb movement to left edge

 → Constituent moved to left edge

==Non-finite verbs and embedded clauses==

===Non-finite verbs===
The V2 principle regulates the position of finite verbs only; its influence on non-finite verbs (infinitives, participles, etc.) is indirect. Non-finite verbs in V2 languages appear in varying positions depending on the language. In German and Dutch, for instance, non-finite verbs appear after the object (if one is present) in clause final position in main clauses (OV order). Swedish and Icelandic, in contrast, position non-finite verbs after the finite verb but before the object (if one is present) (VO order). That is, V2 operates on only the finite verb.

===Embedded clauses===

(In the following examples, finite verb forms are in bold, non-finite verb forms are in &quot;italics&quot; and subjects are underlined.)

Germanic languages vary in the application of V2 order in embedded clauses. They fall into three groups.

====Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Faroese====

In these languages, the word order of clauses is generally fixed in two patterns of conventionally numbered positions. Both end with positions for (5) non-finite verb forms, (6) objects, and (7), adverbials.

In main clauses, the V2 constraint holds. The finite verb must be in position (2) and sentence adverbs in position (4). The latter include words with meanings such as &#x27;not&#x27; and &#x27;always&#x27;. The subject may be position (1), but when a topical expression occupies the position, the subject is in position (3).

In embedded clauses, the V2 constraint is absent. After the conjunction, the subject must immediately follow; it cannot be replaced by a topical expression. Thus, the first four positions are in the fixed order (1) conjunction, (2) subject, (3) sentence adverb, (4) finite verb

The position of the sentence adverbs is important to those theorists who see them as marking the start of a large constituent within the clause. Thus the finite verb is seen as inside that constituent in embedded clauses, but outside that constituent in V2 main clauses.

Swedish
 Main clause Front Finite verb Subject Sentence adverb __ Non-finite verb Object Adverbial
 Embedded clause __ Conjunction Subject Sentence adverb Finite verb Non-finite verb Object Adverbial
 Main clause (a) I dag ville Lotte inte &quot;läsa tidningen&quot;
 today wanted Lotte not read the newspaper
 &quot;Lotte didn&#x27;t want to read the paper today.&quot;
 
 Embedded clause (b) att Lotte inte ville koka kaffe i dag
 that Lotte not wanted brew coffee today
 &quot;that Lotte didn&#x27;t want to make coffee today.&quot;
Danish
So-called Perkerdansk is an example of a variety that does not follow the above.

Norwegian 
(with multiple adverbials and multiple non-finite forms, in two varieties of the language)
Faroese
Unlike continental Scandinavian languages, the sentence adverb may either precede or follow the finite verb in embedded clauses. A (3a) slot is inserted here for the following sentence adverb alternative.

====German ====
In main clauses, the V2 constraint holds. As with other Germanic languages, the finite verb must be in the second position. However, any non-finite forms must be in final position. The subject may be in the first position, but when a topical expression occupies the position, the subject follows the finite verb.

In embedded clauses, the V2 constraint does not hold. The finite verb form must be adjacent to any non-finite at the end of the clause.

German grammarians traditionally divide sentences into fields. Subordinate clauses preceding the main clause are said to be in the first field (Vorfeld), clauses following the main clause in the final field (Nachfeld). 
The central field (Mittelfeld) contains most or all of a clause, and is bounded by left bracket (Linke Satzklammer) and right bracket (Rechte Satzklammer) positions.

In main clauses, the initial element (subject or topical expression) is said to be located in the first field, the V2 finite verb form in the left bracket, and any non-finite verb forms in the right bracket.In embedded clauses, the conjunction is said to be located in the left bracket, and the verb forms in the right bracket. In German embedded clauses, a finite verb form follows any non-finite forms.

German

==== Dutch and Afrikaans ====

V2 word order is used in main clauses; the finite verb must be in the second position. However, in subordinate clauses two word orders are possible for the verb clusters.

Main clauses:

Dutch
This analysis suggests a close parallel between the V2 finite form in main clauses and the conjunctions in embedded clauses. Each is seen as an introduction to its clause-type, a function which some modern scholars have equated with the notion of specifier. The analysis is supported in spoken Dutch by the placement of clitic pronoun subjects. Forms such as ze cannot stand alone, unlike the full-form equivalent zij. The words to which they may be attached are those same introduction words: the V2 form in a main clause, or the conjunction in an embedded clause. 

Subordinate clauses:

In Dutch subordinate clauses two word orders are possible for the verb clusters and are referred to as the &quot;red&quot;: &quot;omdat ik heb gewerkt&quot;, &quot;because I have worked&quot;: like in English, where the auxiliary verb precedes the past particle, and the &quot;green&quot;: &quot;omdat ik gewerkt heb,&quot; where the past particle precedes the auxiliary verb, &quot;because I worked have&quot;: like in German. In Dutch, the green word order is the most used in speech, and the red is the most used in writing, particularly in journalistic texts, but the green is also used in writing as is the red in speech. Unlike in English however adjectives and adverbs must precede the verb: &quot;dat het boek groen is&quot;, &quot;that the book green is&quot;.

====V2 in Icelandic and Yiddish====
These languages freely allow V2 order in embedded clauses.

Icelandic
Two word-order patterns are largely similar to continental Scandinavian. However, in main clauses an extra slot is needed for when the front position is occupied by Það. In these clauses the subject follows any sentence adverbs. In embedded clauses, sentence adverbs follow the finite verb (an optional order in Faroese).
In more radical contrast with other Germanic languages, a third pattern exists for embedded clauses with the conjunction followed by the V2 order: front-finite verb-subject.

Yiddish
Unlike Standard German, Yiddish normally has verb forms before Objects (SVO order), and in embedded clauses has conjunction followed by V2 order.

===Root clauses===
One type of embedded clause with V2 following the conjunction is found throughout the Germanic languages, although it is more common in some than it is others. These are termed root clauses. They are declarative content clauses, the direct objects of so-called bridge verbs, which are understood to quote a statement. For that reason, they exhibit the V2 word order of the equivalent direct quotation.

Danish
Items other than the subject are allowed to appear in front position.
Swedish
Items other than the subject are occasionally allowed to appear in front position. Generally, the statement must be one with which the speaker agrees.
This order is not possible with a statement with which the speaker does not agree.
Norwegian
German
Root clause V2 order is possible only when the conjunction dass is omitted. In such cases, formal usage also places the finite verb form into the present subjunctive (German &quot;Konjunktiv I&quot;) if the verb form is clearly distinguishable from the indicative; if not, the past subjunctive (German &quot;Konjunktiv II&quot;) is used.
: By contrast, a form with an embedded first-person subject would usually use the past subjunctive here, since the present indicative and subjunctive appear identical: &quot;Er behauptet, ich hätte (instead of habe&quot;) &quot;es zur Post gebracht.&quot;
Compare the normal embed-clause order after dass

=== Perspective effects on embedded V2 ===
There are a limited number of V2 languages that can allow for embedded verb movement for a specific pragmatic effect similar to that of English. This is due to the perspective of the speaker. Languages such as German and Swedish have embedded verb second. The embedded verb second in these kinds of languages usually occur after &#x27;bridge verbs&#x27;.

(Bridge verbs are common verbs of speech and thoughts such as &quot;say&quot;, &quot;think&quot;, and &quot;know&quot;, and the word &quot;that&quot; is not needed after these verbs. For example: I think he is coming.)

Based on an assertion theory, the perspective of a speaker is reaffirmed in embedded V2 clauses. A speaker&#x27;s sense of commitment to or responsibility for V2 in embedded clauses is greater than a non-V2 in embedded clause. This is the result of V2 characteristics. As shown in the examples below, there is a greater commitment to the truth in the embedded clause when V2 is in place.

== Variations ==
Variations of V2 order such as V1 (verb-initial word order), V3 and V4 orders are widely attested in many Early Germanic and Medieval Romance languages. These variations are possible in the languages however it is severely restricted to specific contexts.

=== V1 word order ===
V1 (verb-initial word order) is a type of structure that contains the finite verb as the initial clause element. In other words the verb appears before the subject and the object of the sentence.
 (a) Max y-il [ no&#x27; tx;i;] [ naq Lwin]. (Mayan) 
 PFV A3-see CLF dog CLF Pedro 
 &#x27;The dog saw Pedro.&#x27; 

=== V3 word order ===
V3 (verb-third word order) is a variation of V2 in which the finite verb is in third position with two constituents preceding it. In V3, like in V2 word order, the constituents preceding the finite verb are not categorically restricted, as the constituents can be a DP, a PP, a CP and so on.


== Left edge filling trigger (LEFT) ==
V2 is fundamentally derived from a morphological obligatory exponence effect at sentence level. The left edge filling trigger (LEFT) effects are usually seen in classical V2 languages such as Germanic languages and Old Romance languages. The left edge filling trigger is independently active in morphology as EPP effects are found in word-internal levels. The obligatory exponence derives from absolute displacement, ergative displacement and ergative doubling in inflectional morphology. In addition, second position rules in clitic second languages demonstrate post-syntactic rules of LEFT movement. Using the language Breton as an example, absence of a pre-tense expletive will allow for the LEFT to occur to avoid tense-first. The LEFT movement is free from syntactic rules which is evidence for a post-syntactic phenomenon. With the LEFT movement, V2 word order can be obtained as seen in the example below.

In this Breton example, the finite head is phonetically realized and agrees with the category of the preceding element. The pre-tense &quot;Bez&quot; is used in front of the finite verb to obtain the V2 word order. (finite verb &quot;nevo&quot; is bolded).

== Syntactic verb second ==
It is said that V2 patterns are a syntactic phenomenon and therefore have certain environments where it can and cannot be tolerated. Syntactically, V2 requires a left-peripheral head (usually C) with an occupied specifier and paired with raising the highest verb-auxiliary to that head. V2 is usually analyzed as the co-occurrence of these requirements, which can also be referred to as &quot;triggers&quot;. The left-peripheral head, which is a requirement that causes the effect of V2, sets further requirements on a phrase XP that occupies the initial position, so that this phrase XP may always have specific featural characteristics. 

==English==

Modern English differs greatly in word order from other modern Germanic languages, but earlier English shared many similarities. For this reason, some scholars propose a description of Old English with V2 constraint as the norm. The history of English syntax is thus seen as a process of losing the constraint.

===Old English===
In these examples, finite verb forms are in , non-finite verb forms are in and subjects are .

====Main clauses====




====Position of object====
In examples &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, the object of the clause precedes a non-finite verb form. Superficially, the structure is verb-subject-object- verb. To capture generalities, scholars of syntax and linguistic typology treat them as basically subject-object-verb (SOV) structure, modified by the V2 constraint. Thus Old English is classified, to some extent, as an SOV language. However, example &quot;a&quot; represents a number of Old English clauses with object following a non-finite verb form, with the superficial structure verb-subject-verb object. A more substantial number of clauses contain a single finite verb form followed by an object, superficially verb-subject-object. Again, a generalisation is captured by describing these as subject–verb–object (SVO) modified by V2. Thus Old English can be described as intermediate between SOV languages (like German and Dutch) and SVO languages (like Swedish and Icelandic).

====Effect of subject pronouns====
When the subject of a clause was a personal pronoun, V2 did not always operate.

However, V2 verb-subject inversion occurred without exception after a question word or the negative ne, and with few exceptions after þa even with pronominal subjects.



Inversion of a subject pronoun also occurred regularly after a direct quotation.

====Embedded clauses====
Embedded clauses with pronoun subjects were not subject to V2. Even with noun subjects, V2 inversion did not occur.

====Yes–no questions====
In a similar clause pattern, the finite verb form of a yes–no question occupied the first position

===Middle English===

====Continuity====
Early Middle English generally preserved V2 structure in clauses with nominal subjects.

As in Old English, V2 inversion did not apply to clauses with pronoun subjects.

====Change====
Late Middle English texts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries show increasing incidence of clauses without the inversion associated with V2.

Negative clauses were no longer formed with ne (or na) as the first element. Inversion in negative clauses was attributable to other causes.



===Vestiges in Modern English===

As in earlier periods, Modern English normally has subject-verb order in declarative clauses and inverted verb-subject order in interrogative clauses. However these norms are observed irrespective of the number of clause elements preceding the verb.

====Classes of verbs in Modern English: auxiliary and lexical====
Inversion in Old English sentences with a combination of two verbs could be described in terms of their finite and non-finite forms. The word which participated in inversion was the finite verb; the verb which retained its position relative to the object was the non-finite verb. In most types of Modern English clause, there are two verb forms, but the verbs are considered to belong to different syntactic classes. The verbs which participated in inversion have evolved to form a class of auxiliary verbs which may mark tense, aspect and mood; the remaining majority of verbs with full semantic value are said to constitute the class of lexical verbs. The exceptional type of clause is that of declarative clause with a lexical verb in a present simple or past simple form.

====Questions====
Like Yes/No questions, interrogative Wh- questions are regularly formed with inversion of subject and auxiliary. Present Simple and Past Simple questions are formed with the auxiliary do, a process known as do-support. 
:::(see subject-auxiliary inversion in questions)

====With topic adverbs and adverbial phrases====
In certain patterns similar to Old and Middle English, inversion is possible. However, this is a matter of stylistic choice, unlike the constraint on interrogative clauses.

negative or restrictive adverbial first 
:::(see negative inversion)
comparative adverb or adjective first
After the preceding classes of adverbial, only auxiliary verbs, not lexical verbs, participate in inversion

locative or temporal adverb first
prepositional phrase first 
:::(see locative inversion, directive inversion)

After the two latter types of adverbial, only one-word lexical verb forms (Present Simple or Past Simple), not auxiliary verbs, participate in inversion, and only with noun-phrase subjects, not pronominal subjects.

====Direct quotations====
When the object of a verb is a verbatim quotation, it may precede the verb, with a result similar to Old English V2. Such clauses are found in storytelling and in news reports.
:::(see quotative inversion)

====Declarative clauses without inversion====
Corresponding to the above examples, the following clauses show the normal Modern English subject-verb order.

Declarative equivalents
Equivalents without topic fronting

==French==

Modern French is a subject-verb-object (SVO) language like other Romance languages (though Latin was a subject-object-verb language). However, V2 constructions existed in Old French and were more common than in other early Romance language texts. It has been suggested that this may be due to influence from the Germanic Frankish language. Modern French has vestiges of the V2 system similar to those found in modern English.

The following sentences have been identified as possible examples of V2 syntax in Old French:
:

===Old French===
Similarly to Modern French, Old French allows a range of constituents to precede the finite verb in the V2 position.

===Old Occitan===
A language that is compared to Old French is Old Occitan, which is said to be the sister of Old French. Although the two languages are thought to be sister languages, Old Occitan exhibits a relaxed V2 whereas Old French has a much more strict V2. However, the differences between the two languages extend past V2 and also differ in a variation of V2, which is V3. In both language varieties, occurrence of V3 can be triggered by the presence of an initial frame-setting clause or adverbial (1). 

== Other languages ==
===Kotgarhi and Kochi===

In his 1976 three-volume study of two languages of Himachal Pradesh, Hendriksen reports on two intermediate cases: Kotgarhi and Kochi. Although neither language shows a regular V 2 pattern, they have evolved to the point that main and subordinate clauses differ in word order and auxiliaries may separate from other parts of the verb:

Hendriksen reports that relative clauses in Kochi show a greater tendency to have the finite verbal element in clause-final position than matrix clauses do (III:188).

===Ingush===

In Ingush, &quot;for main clauses, other than episode-initial and other all-new ones, verb-second order is most common. The verb, or the finite part of a compound verb or analytic tense form (i.e. the light verb or the auxiliary), follows the first word or phrase in the clause.&quot;

===O&#x27;odham===

O&#x27;odham has relatively free V2 word order within clauses; for example, all of the following sentences mean &quot;the boy brands the pig&quot;:
 ceoj ʼo g ko:jĭ &quot;ceposid&quot;
 ko:jĭ ʼo g ceoj &quot;ceposid&quot;
 ceoj ʼo &quot;ceposid&quot; g ko:jĭ
 ko:jĭ ʼo &quot;ceposid&quot; g ceoj
 &quot;ceposid&quot; ʼo g ceoj g ko:jĭ
 &quot;ceposid&quot; ʼo g ko:jĭ g ceoj

The finite verb is &quot;&#x27;o&quot; and appears after a constituent in the second position.

Despite the general freedom of sentence word order, O&#x27;odham is fairly strictly V2 in its placement of the auxiliary verb (in the sentences above, it is &quot;ʼo&quot;; in the sentences below, it is &quot;ʼañ&quot;):
 Affirmative: &quot;cipkan&quot; ʼañ = &quot;I am working&quot;
 Negative: pi ʼañ &quot;cipkan&quot; = &quot;I am not working&quot; [not *pi &quot;cipkan&quot; ʼañ]

===Sursilvan===

Among dialects of the Romansh, V2 word order is limited to Sursilvan, the insertion of entire phrases between auxiliary verbs and participles occurs, as in &#x27;Cun Mariano Tschuor ha Augustin Beeli &quot;discurriu&quot; &#x27; (&#x27;Mariano Tschuor has spoken with Augustin Beeli&#x27;), as compared to Engadinese &#x27;Cun Rudolf Gasser ha &quot;discurrü&quot; Gion Peider Mischol&#x27; (&#x27;Rudolf Gasser has spoken with Gion Peider Mischol&#x27;.)

The constituent that is bounded by the auxiliary, &quot;ha&quot;, and the participle, &quot;discurriu&quot;, is known as a Satzklammer or &#x27;verbal bracket&#x27;.

===Estonian===
In Estonian, V2 is very frequent in the literate register but less frequent in the spoken register. When V2 occurs, it is found in main clauses as illustrated in (1). 

Unlike Germanic V2 languages, Estonian has several instances where V2 word order is not attested in embedded clauses, such as wh-interrogatives (2), exclamatives (3), and non-subject-initial clauses (4).



===Welsh===
In Welsh, V2 word order is found in Middle Welsh but not in Old and Modern Welsh, which have only verb-initial order. Middle Welsh displays three characteristics of V2 grammar: 
 (1) A finite verb in the C-domain
 (2) The constituent preceding the verb can be any constituent (often driven by pragmatic features). 
 (3) Only one constituent preceding the verb in subject position

As can be seen in the following examples of V2 in Welsh, there is only one constituent preceding the finite verb, but any kind of constituent (such as a noun phrase NP, adverb phrase AP and preposition phrase PP) can occur in this position.
 


Middle Welsh can also exhibit variations of V2 such as cases of V1 (verb-initial word order) and V3 orders. However, these variations are restricted to specific contexts, such as in sentences with impersonal verbs, imperatives, answers or direct responses to questions or commands and idiomatic sayings. A preverbal particle can also precede the verb in V2, but such sentences are limited as well.

=== Wymysorys ===
Wymysory is classified as a West Germanic language but can exhibit various Slavonic characteristics. It is argued that Wymysorys enables its speaker to operate between two word order system, which represent both forces driving its grammar: Germanic and Slavonic. The Germanic system is not as flexible and allows for V2 to exist in it form, but the Slavonic system is relatively free. The rigid word order in the Germanic system causes the placement of the verb to be determined by syntactic rules in which V2 is commonly respected.

Wymysory, like with other languages that exhibit V2, has the finite verb in second position, and a constituent of any category precedes the verb such as DP, PP, AP and so on.



=== Classical Portuguese === 
V2 word order existed in Classical Portuguese much longer than in other Romance languages. Although Classical Portuguese was a V2 language, V1 occurred more frequently and so it is argued whether or not Classical Portuguese really is a V2-like language. However, Classical Portuguese was a relaxed V2 language, and V2 co-exist with its variations: V1 and V3. Classical Portuguese had a strong relationship between V1 and V2 since V2 clauses were derived from V1 clauses.

In languages where both V1 and V2 exist, both patterns depend on the movement of the verb to a high position of the CP layer. The difference is whether or not a phrase is moved to a preverbal position.

Although V1 occurred more frequently in Classical Portuguese, V2 was more frequently found in matrix clauses. Post-verbal subjects could also occupy a high position in the clause and precede VP adverbs. In (1) and (2), it can be seen that the adverb &#x27;bem&#x27; could be before or after the post-verbal subject. 

In (2), the post-verbal subject is understood as an informational focus, but the same cannot be said for (1) because the different positions determine how the subject is interpreted.

==Structural analysis==
Various structural analyses of V2 have been developed, including within the model of dependency grammar and generative grammar.

===Dependency grammar ===

Dependency grammar (DG) can accommodate the V2 phenomenon simply by stipulating that one and only one constituent must be a predependent of the finite verb (i.e. a dependent which precedes its head) in declarative (matrix) clauses (in this, Dependency Grammar assumes only one clausal level and one position of the verb, instead of a distinction between a VP-internal and a higher clausal position of the verb as in Generative Grammar, cf. the next section). On this account, the V2 principle is violated if the finite verb has more than one predependent or no predependent at all. The following DG structures of the first four German sentences above illustrate the analysis (the sentence means &#x27;The kids play soccer in the park before school&#x27;):

The finite verb &quot;spielen&quot; is the root of all clause structure. The V2 principle requires that this root have a single predependent, which it does in each of the four sentences.

The four English sentences above involving the V2 phenomenon receive the following analyses:

===Generative grammar ===

In the theory of Generative Grammar, the verb second phenomenon has been described as an application of X-bar theory. The combination of a first position for a phrase and a second position for a single verb has been identified as the combination of &quot;specifier&quot; and &quot;head&quot; of a phrase. The part after the finite verb is then the &quot;complement&quot;. While the sentence structure of English is usually analysed in terms of three levels, CP, IP, and VP, in German linguistics the consensus has emerged that there is no IP in German.

The VP (verb phrase) structure assigns position and functions to the arguments of the verb. Hence, this structure is shaped by the grammatical properties of the V (verb) which heads the structure. 
The CP (complementizer phrase) structure incorporates the grammatical information which identifies the clause as declarative or interrogative, main or embedded. The structure is shaped by the abstract C (complementiser) which is considered the head of the structure. In embedded clauses the C position accommodates complementizers. In German declarative main clauses, C hosts the finite verb.
Thus the V2 structure is analysed as 
:1 Topic element (specifier of CP)
:2 Finite-verb form (C=head of CP) i.e. verb-second
:3 Remainder of the clause

In embedded clauses, the C position is occupied by a complementizer. In most Germanic languages (but not in Icelandic or Yiddish), this generally prevents the finite verb from moving to C. 
:The structure is analysed as
::1 Complementizer (C=head of CP)
::2 Bulk of clause (VP), including, in German, the subject.
::3 Finite verb (V position)

This analysis does not provide a structure for the instances in some language of root clauses after bridge verbs. 
:Example: Danish Vi ved at denne bog har Bo ikke læst with the object of the embedded clause fronted.
: (Literally &#x27;We know that this book has Bo not read&#x27;)
The solution is to allow verbs such as ved to accept a clause with a second (recursive) CP.
: The complementizer occupies C position in the upper CP.
: The finite verb moves to the C position in the lower CP.

<text>Rebecca Walker (born Rebecca Leventhal; November 17, 1969) is an American writer, feminist, and activist. Walker has been regarded as one of the prominent voices of Third Wave Feminism, and the coiner of the term &quot;third wave&quot;, since publishing a 1992 article on feminism in &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine called &quot;Becoming the Third Wave&quot;, in which she proclaimed: &quot;I am the Third Wave.&quot;

Walker&#x27;s writing, teaching, and speeches focus on race, gender, politics, power, and culture. In her activism work, she helped co-found the Third Wave Fund that morphed into the Third Wave Foundation, an organization that supports young women of color, queer, intersex, and trans individuals by providing tools and resources they need to be leaders in their communities through activism and philanthropy.

Walker does extensive writing and speaking about gender, racial, economic, and social justice at universities around the United States and internationally.

In 1994, &quot;Time&quot; named Walker as one of the 50 future leaders of America. Her work has appeared in publications including &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, &quot;Salon&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, and &quot;Essence&quot; and has been featured on CNN and MTV.

==Early life and education==
Born Rebecca Leventhal in 1969 in Jackson, Mississippi, she is the daughter of Alice Walker, an African-American writer whose work includes &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, and Melvyn R. Leventhal, a Jewish American civil rights lawyer. Her parents married in New York before going to Mississippi to work in civil rights. After her parents divorced in 1976, Walker spent her childhood alternating every two years between her father&#x27;s home in the largely Jewish Riverdale section of the Bronx in New York City and her mother&#x27;s largely African-American environment in San Francisco. Walker attended The Urban School of San Francisco.

When she was 15, she decided to change her surname from Leventhal to Walker, her mother&#x27;s surname. After high school, she studied at Yale University, where she graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1992. Walker identifies as Jewish, white and Black; her 2000 memoir is titled &quot;Black, White, and Jewish: Autobiography of a Shifting Self&quot;.

== Activism ==

=== The Third Wave Fund ===

After graduating from Yale University, she and Shannon Liss (now Shannon Liss-Riordan) co-founded the Third Wave Fund, a non-profit organization aimed at encouraging young women to get involved in activism and leadership roles. The organization&#x27;s initial mission, based on Walker&#x27;s article, was to &quot;fill a void in young women&#x27;s leadership and to mobilize young people to become more involved socially and politically in their communities.&quot; In its first year, the organization initiated a campaign that registered more than 20,000 new voters across the United States. The organization now provides grants to individuals and projects that support young women. The fund was adapted as The Third Wave Foundation in 1997 and continues to support young activists. In the wake of the November 2016 presidential election in the United States, the organization received more than four times the normal number of requests for emergency grants.

=== Teaching ===

Walker views teaching as a way to give people the strength to speak the truth, to change perspectives, and to empower people with the ability to change the world. She lectures on writing memoirs, multi-generational feminism, diversity in the media, multi-racial identity, contemporary visual arts and emerging cultures.

== Speaking ==
Walker concentrates on speaking about multicultural identity (including her own), enlightened masculinity, and inter-generational and third-wave feminism at high schools, universities and conferences around the world. She has spoken at Harvard, Exeter, Head Royce, Oberlin, Smith, MIT, Xavier, Stanford, and Louisiana State University. She has also addressed organizations and corporations such as The National Council of Teachers of English, the Walker Art Center, the American Association of University Women, the National Women&#x27;s Studies Association, Out and Equal, the National Organization for Women, and Hewitt Associates. In the United States, she has been featured on various popular media outlets such as &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, and &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;.

== Books and writing ==

=== Major works ===

Walker&#x27;s first major work was the book &quot;To be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism&quot; (1996), which consisted of articles that she compiled and edited. The book reevaluated the feminist movement of the time. Reviewer Emilie Fale, an Assistant Professor of Communication at Ithaca College, described it: &quot;The twenty-three contributors in &quot;To Be Real&quot; offer varied perspectives and experiences that challenge our stereotypes of feminist beliefs as they negotiate the troubled waters of gender roles, identity politics and &quot;power feminism&quot;. As a collection of &quot;personal testimonies&quot;, this work shows how third-wave activists use personal narratives to describe their experiences with social and gender injustice. Contributors include feminist writers such as bell hooks and Naomi Wolf. According to Walker&#x27;s website, this book has been taught in Gender Studies programs around the world.

In her memoir &quot;Black, White and Jewish: Autobiography of a Shifting Self&quot; (2000), Walker explores her early years in Mississippi as the child of parents who were active in the later years of the Civil Rights Movement. She also touches on living with two parents with very active careers, which she believes led to their separation. She discusses encountering racial prejudice and the difficulties of being mixed-race in a society with rigid cultural barriers. She also discusses developing her sexuality and identity as a bisexual woman.

Her 2007 memoir &quot;Baby Love: Choosing Motherhood After A Lifetime of Ambivalence&quot; explores her life with a stepson and biological son against a framework of feminism. Walker was criticized for her stigmatizing views on biological parenthood being superior to adoptive parenthood and adoptive parents boycotted her work.

Walker was a contributing editor to &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine for many years. Her writing has been published in a range of magazines, such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;Buddhadharma&quot;, &quot;Vibe&quot;, &quot;Child&quot;, and &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazines. She has appeared on CNN and MTV, and has been covered in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Chicago Times&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Shambhala Sun&quot;, among other publications. Walker has taught workshops on writing at international conferences and MFA programs. She also works as a private publishing consultant.

Her first novel, &quot;Adé: A Love Story&quot;, was published in 2013. It features a biracial college student, Farida, who falls in love with Adé, a black Kenyan man. The couple&#x27;s plan to marry is interrupted when Farida gets malaria and the two must struggle through a civil war in Kenya. The novel was generally well received by critics and laypeople alike.

==Personal life==
Walker identifies as bisexual. She dated neo-soul musician Meshell Ndegeocello, whose son she helped raise even after their relationship ended.

She has a son (b. 2004) with her former partner Choyin Rangdrol, a Buddhist teacher.

Once estranged from her mother Alice Walker, she has reconciled with her, and the two have since appeared at literary events together.

<doc id="837167" wikidata="Q180664" url="?curid=837167" title="Acute lymphoblastic leukemia">
<text>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer of the lymphoid line of blood cells characterized by the development of large numbers of immature lymphocytes. Symptoms may include feeling tired, pale skin color, fever, easy bleeding or bruising, enlarged lymph nodes, or bone pain. As an acute leukemia, ALL progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
In most cases, the cause is unknown. Genetic risk factors may include Down syndrome, Li–Fraumeni syndrome, or neurofibromatosis type 1. Environmental risk factors may include significant radiation exposure or prior chemotherapy. Evidence regarding electromagnetic fields or pesticides is unclear. Some hypothesize that an abnormal immune response to a common infection may be a trigger. The underlying mechanism involves multiple genetic mutations that results in rapid cell division. The excessive immature lymphocytes in the bone marrow interfere with the production of new red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Diagnosis is typically based on blood tests and bone marrow examination.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is typically treated initially with chemotherapy aimed at bringing about remission. This is then followed by further chemotherapy typically over a number of years. Treatment usually also includes intrathecal chemotherapy since systemic chemotherapy can have limited penetration into the central nervous system and the central nervous system is a common site for relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Treatment can also include radiation therapy if spread to the brain has occurred. Stem cell transplantation may be used if the disease recurs following standard treatment. Additional treatments such as Chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy are being used and further studied.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia affected about 876,000 people globally in 2015 and resulted in about 111,000 deaths. It occurs most commonly in children, particularly those between the ages of two and five. In the United States it is the most common cause of cancer and death from cancer among children. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is notable for being the first disseminated cancer to be cured. Survival for children increased from under 10% in the 1960s to 90% in 2015. Survival rates remain lower for babies (50%) and adults (35%).
== Signs and symptoms ==
Initial symptoms can be nonspecific, particularly in children. Over 50% of children with leukemia had one or more of five features: a liver one can feel (64%), a spleen one can feel (61%), pale complexion (54%), fever (53%), and bruising (52%). Additionally, recurrent infections, feeling tired, arm or leg pain, and enlarged lymph nodes can be prominent features. The B symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, are often present as well.

Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms such as cranial neuropathies due to meningeal infiltration are identified in less than 10% of adults and less than 5% of children, particularly mature B-cell ALL (Burkitt leukemia) at presentation.

The signs and symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are variable and include:
* Generalized weakness and feeling tired
* Anemia
* Dizziness
* Headache, vomiting, lethargy, neck stiffness, or cranial nerve palsies (CNS involvement)
* Frequent or unexplained fever and infection
* Weight loss and/or loss of appetite
* Excessive and unexplained bruising
* Bone pain, joint pain (caused by the spread of &quot;blast&quot; cells to the surface of the bone or into the joint from the marrow cavity)
* Breathlessness
* Enlarged lymph nodes, liver, and/or spleen
* Pitting edema (swelling) in the lower limbs and/or abdomen
* Petechiae, which are tiny red spots or lines in the skin due to low platelet levels
* Testicular enlargement
* Mediastinal mass

== Cause ==

The cancerous cell in ALL is the lymphoblast. Normal lymphoblasts develop into mature, infection-fighting B-cells or T-cells, also called lymphocytes. Signals in the body control the number of lymphocytes so neither too few nor too many are made. In ALL, the normal development of some lymphocytes and the control over the number of lymphoid cells become defective.

ALL emerges when a single lymphoblast gains many mutations to genes that affect blood cell development and proliferation. In childhood ALL, this process begins at conception with the inheritance of some of these genes. These genes, in turn, increase the risk that more mutations will occur in developing lymphoid cells. Certain genetic syndromes, like Down Syndrome, have the same effect. Environmental risk factors are also needed to help create enough genetic mutations to cause disease. Evidence for the role of the environment is seen in childhood ALL among twins, where only 10–15% of both genetically identical twins get ALL. Since they have the same genes, different environmental exposures explain why one twin gets ALL and the other does not.

Infant ALL is a rare variant that occurs in babies less than one-year-old. &quot;KMT2A&quot; (formerly &quot;MLL&quot;) gene rearrangements are most common and happen in the embryo or fetus before birth. These rearrangements result in increased expression of blood cell development genes by promoting gene transcription and through epigenetic changes. In contrast to childhood ALL, environmental factors are not thought to play a significant role. Aside from the &quot;KMT2A&quot; rearrangement, only one extra mutation is typically found. Environmental exposures are not needed to help create more mutations.

=== Risk factors ===

==== Genetics ====

Common inherited risk factors include mutations in &quot;ARID5B&quot;, &quot;CDKN2A/2B&quot;, &quot;CEBPE&quot;, &quot;IKZF1&quot;, &quot;GATA3&quot;, &quot;PIP4K2A&quot; and, more rarely, &quot;TP53&quot;. These genes play important roles in cellular development, proliferation, and differentiation. Individually, most of these mutations are low risk for ALL. A significant risk of disease occurs when a person inherits several of these mutations together.

The uneven distribution of genetic risk factors may help explain differences in disease rates among ethnic groups. For instance, the &quot;ARID5B&quot; mutation is less common in ethnic African populations.

Several genetic syndromes also carry an increased risk of ALL. These include: Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, severe combined immunodeficiency, Shwachman–Diamond syndrome, Kostmann syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, ataxia-telangiectasia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and Li–Fraumeni syndrome. Fewer than 5% of cases are associated with a known genetic syndrome.

Rare mutations in &quot;ETV6&quot; and &quot;PAX5&quot; are associated with a familial form of ALL with autosomal dominant patterns of inheritance.

==== Environmental ====

The environmental exposures that contribute to the emergence of ALL are contentious and a subject of ongoing debate.

High levels of radiation exposure from nuclear fallout is a known risk factor for developing leukemia. Evidence whether lesser radiation, as from x-ray imaging during pregnancy, increases the risk of disease remains inconclusive. Studies that have identified an association between x-ray imaging during pregnancy and ALL found only a slightly increased risk. Exposure to strong electromagnetic radiation from power lines has also been associated with a slightly increased ALL risk. This result is questioned as no causal mechanism linking electromagnetic radiation with cancer is known.

High birth weight (greater than 4000 g or 8.8 lbs) is also associated with a small increased risk. The mechanism connecting high birth weight to ALL is also not known.

Evidence suggests that secondary leukemia can develop in individuals treated with certain types of chemotherapy, such as epipodophyllotoxins and cyclophosphamide.

==== Infections ====
There is some evidence that a common infection, such as influenza, may indirectly promote the emergence of ALL. The delayed-infection hypothesis states that ALL results from an abnormal immune response to infection in a person with genetic risk factors. Delayed development of the immune system due to limited disease exposure may result in excessive production of lymphocytes and increased mutation rate during an illness. Several studies have identified lower ALL rates among children with greater exposure to illness early in life. Very young children who attend daycare have lower rates of ALL. Evidence from many other studies looking at disease exposure and ALL is inconclusive. Some researchers have linked the hygiene hypothesis.

Several characteristic genetic changes lead to the creation of a leukemic lymphoblast. These changes include chromosomal translocations, intrachromosomal rearrangements, changes in the number of chromosomes in leukemic cells, and additional mutations in individual genes. Chromosomal translocations involve moving a large region of DNA from one chromosome to another. This move can result in placing a gene from one chromosome that promotes cell division to a more actively transcribed area on another chromosome. The result is a cell that divides more often. An example of this includes the translocation of &quot;C-MYC&quot;, a gene that encodes a transcription factor that leads to increased cell division, next to the immunoglobulin heavy- or light-chain gene enhancers, leading to increased &quot;C-MYC&quot; expression and increased cell division. Other large changes in chromosomal structure can result in the placement of two genes directly next to each other. The result is the combination of two usually separate proteins into a new fusion protein. This protein can have a new function that promotes the development of cancer. Examples of this include the &quot;ETV6&quot;–&quot;RUNX1&quot; fusion gene that combines two factors that promote blood cell development and the &quot;BCR&quot;-&quot;ABL1&quot; fusion gene of the Philadelphia chromosome. &quot;BCR&quot;–&quot;ABL1&quot; encodes an always-activated tyrosine kinase that causes frequent cell division. These mutations produce a cell that divides more often, even in the absence of growth factors.

Other genetic changes in B-cell ALL include changes to the number of chromosomes within the leukemic cells. Gaining at least five additional chromosomes, called high hyperdiploidy, occurs more commonly. Less often, chromosomes are lost, called hypodiploidy, which is associated with a poorer prognosis. Additional common genetic changes in B-cell ALL involve non-inherited mutations to &quot;PAX5&quot; and &quot;IKZF1&quot;. In T-cell ALL, &quot;LYL1&quot;, &quot;TAL1&quot;, &quot;TLX1&quot;, and &quot;TLX3&quot; rearrangements can occur.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia results when enough of these genetic changes are present in a single lymphoblast. In childhood ALL, for example, one fusion gene translocation is often found along with six to eight other ALL-related genetic changes. The initial leukemic lymphoblast copies itself into an excessive number of new lymphoblasts, none of which can develop into functioning lymphocytes. These lymphoblasts build up in the bone marrow and may spread to other sites in the body, such as lymph nodes, the mediastinum, the spleen, the testicles, and the brain, leading to the common symptoms of the disease.

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosing ALL begins with a thorough medical history, physical examination, complete blood count, and blood smears. While many symptoms of ALL can be found in common illnesses, persistent or unexplained symptoms raise suspicion of cancer. Because many features on the medical history and exam are not specific to ALL, further testing is often needed. A large number of white blood cells and lymphoblasts in the circulating blood can be suspicious for ALL because they indicate a rapid production of lymphoid cells in the marrow. The higher these numbers typically point to a worse prognosis. While white blood cell counts at initial presentation can vary significantly, circulating lymphoblast cells are seen on peripheral blood smears in the majority of cases.

A bone marrow biopsy provides conclusive proof of ALL, typically with &gt;20% of all cells being leukemic lymphoblasts. A lumbar puncture (also known as a spinal tap) can determine whether the spinal column and brain have been invaded. Brain and spinal column involvement can be diagnosed either through confirmation of leukemic cells in the lumbar puncture or through clinical signs of CNS leukemia as described above. Laboratory tests that might show abnormalities include blood count, kidney function, electrolyte, and liver enzyme tests.

Pathological examination, cytogenetics (in particular the presence of Philadelphia chromosome), and immunophenotyping establish whether the leukemic cells are myeloblastic (neutrophils, eosinophils, or basophils) or lymphoblastic (B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes). Cytogenetic testing on the marrow samples can help classify disease and predict how aggressive the disease course will be. Different mutations have been associated with shorter or longer survival. Immunohistochemical testing may reveal TdT or CALLA antigens on the surface of leukemic cells. TdT is a protein expressed early in the development of pre-T and pre-B cells, whereas CALLA is an antigen found in 80% of ALL cases and also in the &quot;blast crisis&quot; of CML.

Medical imaging (such as ultrasound or CT scanning) can find invasion of other organs, commonly the lungs, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, brain, kidneys, and reproductive organs.

=== Immunophenotyping ===

In addition to cell morphology and cytogenetics, immunophenotyping, a laboratory technique used to identify proteins that are expressed on their cell surface, is a key component in the diagnosis of ALL. The preferred method of immunophenotyping is through flow cytometry. In the malignant lymphoblasts of ALL, expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) on the cell surface can help differentiate malignant lymphocyte cells from reactive lymphocytes, white blood cells that are reacting normally to an infection in the body. On the other hand, myeloperoxidase (MPO), a marker for the myeloid lineage, is typically not expressed. Because precursor B cells and precursor T cells look the same, immunophenotyping can help differentiate the subtype of ALL and the level of maturity of the malignant white blood cells. The subtypes of ALL as determined by immunophenotype and according to the stages of maturation.

An extensive panel of monoclonal antibodies to cell surface markers, particularly CD or cluster of differentiation markers, are used to classify cells by lineage. Below are immunological markers associated with B cell and T cell ALL.
=== Cytogenetics ===

Cytogenetic analysis has shown different proportions and frequencies of genetic abnormalities in cases of ALL from different age groups. This information is particularly valuable for classification and can in part explain the different prognoses of these groups. In regards to genetic analysis, cases can be stratified according to ploidy, a number of sets of chromosomes in the cell, and specific genetic abnormalities, such as translocations. Hyperdiploid cells are defined as cells with more than 50 chromosomes, while hypodiploid are defined as cells with less than 44 chromosomes. Hyperdiploid cases tend to carry a good prognosis while hypodiploid cases do not. For example, the most common specific abnormality in childhood B-ALL is the t(12;21) &quot;ETV6&quot;–&quot;RUNX1&quot; translocation, in which the &quot;RUNX1&quot; gene, encoding a protein involved in transcriptional control of hemopoiesis, has been translocated and repressed by the &quot;ETV6&quot;–&quot;RUNX1&quot; fusion protein.

Below is a table with the frequencies of some cytogenetic translocations and molecular genetic abnormalities in ALL.
=== Classification ===

French-American-British

Historically, before 2008, ALL was classified morphologically using the French-American-British (FAB) system that heavily relied on morphological assessment. The FAB system takes into account information on size, cytoplasm, nucleoli, basophilia (color of cytoplasm), and vacuolation (bubble-like properties).

While some clinicians still use the FAB scheme to describe tumor cell appearance, much of this classification has been abandoned because of its limited impact on treatment choice and prognostic value.

World Health Organization

In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of ALL was developed in an attempt to create a classification system that was more clinically relevant and could produce meaningful prognostic and treatment decisions. This system recognized differences in genetic, immunophenotype, molecular, and morphological features found through cytogenetic and molecular diagnostics tests. This subtyping helps determine the prognosis and the most appropriate treatment for each specific case of ALL.

The WHO subtypes related to ALL are:
* B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma
** Not otherwise specified (NOS)
** with recurrent genetic abnormalities
** with t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2);&quot;BCR-ABL1&quot;
** with t(v;11q23.3);&quot;KMT2A&quot; rearranged
** with t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1); &quot;ETV6-RUNX1&quot;
** with t(5;14)(q31.1;q32.3) &quot;IL3-IGH&quot;
** with t(1;19)(q23;p13.3);&quot;TCF3-PBX1&quot;
** with hyperdiploidy
** with hypodiploidy
* T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma
* Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage
** Acute undifferentiated leukemia
** Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) with t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2); &quot;BCR–ABL1&quot;
** MPAL with t(v;11q23.3); &quot;KMT2A&quot; rearranged
** MPAL, B/myeloid, NOS
** MPAL, T/myeloid, NOS

== Treatment ==

The aim of treatment is to induce a lasting remission, defined as the absence of detectable cancer cells in the body (usually less than 5% blast cells in the bone marrow) or the absence of minimal residual disease.

Over the past several decades, there have been strides to increase the efficacy of treatment regimens, resulting in increased survival rates. Possible treatments for acute leukemia include chemotherapy, steroids, radiation therapy, intensive combined treatments (including bone marrow or stem cell transplants), targeted therapy, and/or growth factors.

=== Chemotherapy ===

Chemotherapy is the initial treatment of choice, and most people with ALL receive a combination of medications. There are no surgical options because of the body-wide distribution of the malignant cells. In general, cytotoxic chemotherapy for ALL combines multiple antileukemic drugs tailored to each person. Chemotherapy for ALL consists of three phases: remission induction, intensification, and maintenance therapy.
Adult chemotherapy regimens mimic those of childhood ALL; however, are linked with a higher risk of disease relapse with chemotherapy alone. Two subtypes of ALL (B-cell ALL and T-cell ALL) require special considerations when it comes to selecting an appropriate treatment regimen in adults with ALL. B-cell ALL is often associated with cytogenetic abnormalities (specifically, t(8;14), t (2;8), and t(8;22)), which require aggressive therapy consisting of brief, high-intensity regimens. T-cell ALL responds to cyclophosphamide-containing agents the most.

Recent updates on the treatment of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) include advancements in immunotherapy, particularly the use of monoclonal antibodies like blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin, which target specific cancer cells and are used alongside stem cell transplantation. Additionally, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib and dasatinib are incorporated for Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, improving treatment outcomes.

=== Radiation therapy ===

Radiation therapy (or radiotherapy) is used on painful bony areas, in high disease burdens, or as part of the preparations for a bone marrow transplant (total body irradiation). In the past, physicians commonly utilized radiation in the form of whole-brain radiation for central nervous system prophylaxis, to prevent the occurrence and/or recurrence of leukemia in the brain. Recent studies showed that CNS chemotherapy provided results as favorable but with fewer developmental side effects. As a result, the use of whole-brain radiation has been more limited. Most specialists in adult leukemia have abandoned the use of radiation therapy for CNS prophylaxis, instead using intrathecal chemotherapy.

=== Biological therapy ===

Selection of biological targets based on their combinatorial effects on the leukemic lymphoblasts can lead to clinical trials for improvement in the effects of ALL treatment. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib, are often incorporated into the treatment plan for people with &quot;Bcr-Abl1+ (Ph+)&quot; ALL. However, this subtype of ALL is frequently resistant to the combination of chemotherapy and TKIs, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation is often recommended upon relapse.

Blinatumomab is not only a promising add-on to chemotherapy in infant ALL, it is also a promising standalone therapy in children.

=== Immunotherapy ===

Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have been developed as a promising immunotherapy for ALL. This technology uses a single chain variable fragment (scFv) designed to recognize the cell surface marker CD19 as a method of treating ALL.

CD19 is a molecule found on all B-cells and can be used as a means of distinguishing the potentially malignant B-cell population. In this therapy, mice are immunized with the CD19 antigen and produce anti-CD19 antibodies. Hybridomas developed from mouse spleen cells fused to a myeloma cell line can be developed as a source for the cDNA encoding the CD19-specific antibody. The cDNA is sequenced and the sequence encoding the variable heavy and variable light chains of these antibodies are cloned together using a small peptide linker. This resulting sequence encodes the scFv. This can be cloned into a transgene, encoding what will become the endodomain of the CAR. Varying arrangements of subunits serve as the endodomain, but they generally consist of the hinge region that attaches to the scFv, a transmembrane region, the intracellular region of a costimulatory molecule such as CD28, and the intracellular domain of CD3-zeta containing ITAM repeats. Other sequences frequently included are: 4-1bb and OX40. The final transgene sequence, containing the scFv and endodomain sequences is then inserted into immune effector cells that are obtained from the person and expanded &quot;in vitro&quot;. In trials these have been a type of T-cell capable of cytotoxicity.

Inserting the DNA into the effector cell can be accomplished by several methods. Most commonly, this is done using a lentivirus that encodes the transgene. Pseudotyped, self-inactivating lentiviruses are an effective method for the stable insertion of a desired transgene into the target cell. Other methods include electroporation and transfection, but these are limited in their efficacy as transgene expression diminishes over time.

The gene-modified effector cells are then transplanted back into the person. Typically this process is done in conjunction with a conditioning regimen such as cyclophosphamide, which has been shown to potentiate the effects of infused T-cells. This effect has been attributed to making an immunologic space within which the cells populate. The process as a whole results in an effector cell, typically a T-cell, that can recognize a tumor cell antigen in a manner that is independent of the major histocompatibility complex and which can initiate a cytotoxic response.

In 2017, tisagenlecleucel was approved by the FDA as a CAR-T therapy for people with acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia who did not respond adequately to other treatments or have relapsed. In a 22-day process, the &quot;drug&quot; is customized for each person. T cells purified from each person are modified by a virus that inserts genes that encode a chimaeric antigen receptor into their DNA, one that recognizes leukemia cells.

Obecabtagene autoleucel (Aucatzyl) was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2024.

=== Relapsed ALL ===
Typically, people who experience a relapse in their ALL after initial treatment have a poorer prognosis than those who remain in complete remission after induction therapy. It is unlikely that recurrent leukemia will respond favorably to the standard chemotherapy regimen that was initially implemented, and instead, these people should be trialed on reinduction chemotherapy followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. These people in relapse may also receive blinatumomab, as it has shown to increase remission rates and overall survival rates, without increased toxic effects.

Low-dose palliative radiation may also help reduce the burden of tumors inside or outside the central nervous system and alleviate some symptoms.

There has also been evidence and approval of use for dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It has shown efficacy in cases of people with Ph1-positive and imatinib-resistant ALL, but more research needs to be done on long-term survival and time to relapse.

=== Side effects ===
Chemotherapies or stem cell transplantations may require a platelet transfusion to prevent bleeding. Moreover, patients undergoing a stem cell transplantation can develop a graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). It was evaluated whether mesenchymal stromal cells can be used to prevent a GvHD. The evidence is very uncertain about the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stromal cells to treat graft-versus-host diseases after a stem cell transplantation on the all-cause mortality and complete disappearance of chronic acute graft-versus-host diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells may result in little to no difference in the all-cause mortality, relapse of malignant disease, and incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host diseases if they are used for prophylactic reasons.

=== Supportive therapy ===
Adding physical exercises to the standard treatment for adult patients with haematological malignancies like ALL may result in little to no difference in mortality, quality of life, and physical functioning. These exercises may result in a slight reduction in depression. Furthermore, aerobic physical exercises probably reduce fatigue. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on anxiety and serious adverse events.

=== Cell therapy ===
Brexucabtagene autoleucel (Tecartus) was approved by the FDA in October 2021 for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL, and later by the EMA in December 2021.

Each dose of brexucabtagene autoleucel is a customized treatment created using the recipient&#x27;s immune system to help fight the leukaeamia. The recipient&#x27;s T cells, a type of white blood cell, are collected and genetically modified to include a new gene that facilitates the targeting and killing of the lymphoma cells. These modified T cells are then infused back into the recipient.

== Prognosis ==

Before the development of chemotherapy regimens and hematopoietic stem cell transplants, children were surviving a median length of 3 months, largely due to either infection or bleeding. Since the advent of chemotherapy, the prognosis for childhood leukemia has improved greatly and children with ALL are estimated to have a 95% probability of achieving a successful remission after 4 weeks of initiating treatment. People in pediatric care with ALL in developed countries have a greater than 80% five-year survival rate. It is estimated that 60–80% of adults undergoing induction chemotherapy achieve complete remission after 4 weeks, and those over the age of 70 have a cure rate of 5%.
However, there are differing prognoses for ALL among individuals depending on a variety of factors:
* Gender: Females tend to fare better than males.
* Ethnicity: Caucasians are more likely to develop acute leukemia than African-Americans, Asians, or Hispanics. However, they also tend to have a better prognosis than non-Caucasians.
* Age at diagnosis: children 1–10 years of age are most likely to develop ALL and to be cured of it. Cases in older people are more likely to result from chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., the Philadelphia chromosome) that make treatment more difficult and prognoses poorer. Older people are also likely to have co-morbid medical conditions that make it even more difficult to tolerate ALL treatment.
* White blood cell count at diagnosis of greater than 30,000 (B-ALL) or 100,000 (T-ALL) is associated with worse outcomes
* Cancer spreading into the central nervous system (brain or spinal cord) has worse outcomes.
* Morphological, immunological, and genetic subtypes
* Person&#x27;s response to initial treatment and longer length of time required (greater than 4 weeks) to reach complete remission
* Early relapse of ALL
* Minimal residual disease
* Genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, and other chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidy and translocations)

Cytogenetics, the study of characteristic large changes in the chromosomes of cancer cells, is an important predictor of outcome. Some cytogenetic subtypes have a worse prognosis than others. These include:
* Person with t(9,22) positive-ALL (30% of adult ALL cases) and other &quot;Bcr-abl-&quot;rearranged leukemias are more likely to have a poor prognosis, but survival rates may rise with treatment consisting of chemotherapy and &quot;Bcr-abl&quot; tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
* A translocation between chromosomes 4 and 11 occurs in about 4% of cases and is most common in infants under 12 months.
* Hyperdiploidy (&gt;50 chromosomes) and t(12;21) are good prognostic factors and also makeup 50% of pediatric ALL cases.
Unclassified ALL is considered to have an intermediate prognosis risk, somewhere in-between the good and poor risk categories.

== Epidemiology ==

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia affected about 876,000 people and resulted in 111,000 deaths globally in 2015. It occurs in both children and adults with the highest rates seen between the ages three and seven years. Around 75% of cases occur before the age of 6 with a secondary rise after the age of 40. It is estimated to affect 1 in 1500 children.

Accounting for the broad age profiles of those affected, ALL newly occurs in about 1.7 per 100,000 people annually. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia represents approximately 20% of adults and 80% of childhood leukemias, making it the most common childhood cancer. Although 80 to 90% of children will have a long-term complete response with treatment, it remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among children. 85% of cases are of B-cell lineage and have an equal number of cases in both males and females. The remaining 15% of T-cell lineage have a male predominance.

Globally, ALL typically occurs more often in Caucasians, Hispanics, and Latin Americans than in Africans. In the US, ALL is more common in children from Caucasian (36 cases/million) and Hispanic (41 cases/million) descent when compared to those from African (15 cases/million) descent.

== Pregnancy ==
Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women. The management of leukemia in a pregnant woman depends primarily on the type of leukemia. Acute leukemias normally require prompt, aggressive treatment, despite significant risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive first trimester.

<text>Major General Joseph Saidu Momoh, OOR, OBE (January 26, 1937 – August 3, 2003) was a Sierra Leonean politician and military officer who served as the second President of Sierra Leone from November 1985 to 29 April 1992.

Momoh was a member of the Limba ethnic group and briefly began a career in civil service before joining the military in 1956. Following the rise to power of Siaka Stevens, Momoh was appointed force commander in 1971, promoted to major-general in 1983, and became the secretary general of the country&#x27;s sole legal party, the All People&#x27;s Congress in 1985.

Stevens&#x27; retired later that year, and was succeeded by Momoh after a presidential election with himself as the only candidate. He inherited a deteriorating economy, but made significant improvements in combatting corruption. In foreign policy, he enjoyed positive relations with the United States and the United Kingdom. In 1991, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel group incited the Sierra Leone Civil War with the goal of overthrowing him. Later that year, he introduced a new constitution allowing for a multiparty system. Despite this, he was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état the following year led by Valentine Strasser, who cited his government&#x27;s unpaid salaries and poor logistical supply to frontline soldiers fighting against the RUF as motives. He fled into exile in Guinea, where he died in 2003, one year after the end of the war.

==Early life==
Joseph Saidu Momoh was born on January 26, 1937, in Binkolo, Bombali District in the Northern Province of British Sierra Leone to Limba parents. In the early 1940s, his family moved to Freetown, ultimately settling in Wilberforce. His family were Christians.

From 1951 to 1955, he was educated at the West African Methodist Collegiate School. Momoh was very athletic and enjoyed playing tennis, basketball and volleyball. He played competitive football for the Young Stars FC at Makeni and Blackpool FC.

He completed his education at the Government Clerks School, Technical Institute.

==Career==

===Civil service===

In 1956, Momoh worked as third grade clerk in Sierra Leone&#x27;s civil service. He resigned from this position in 1958 in order to join the armed forces.

===Military career===

Momoh&#x27;s military career began in 1958, when he enlisted in the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF) as a private. He trained at the Regular Officers Training School in Ghana and the Nigerian Military Training Academy. He then travelled to the United Kingdom to train at the School of Infantry at Hythe and the Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot.

He was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Royal Sierra Leone Military Forces in 1963. He was elevated to the rank of major and given command at Moa Barracks, Kailahun.

In 1969, Momoh became lieutenant colonel and commanding officer of the First Battalion. A year later, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel.

He was appointed deputy force commander in 1971 by President Siaka Stevens, after a coup attempt by Brigadier John Amadu Bangura. Momoh succeeded Bangura as force commander in November 1971.

In 1974, he was appointed minister of state with cabinet status. He became major-general in 1983.

=== President of Sierra Leone ===

In 1985, Momoh became secretary-general and head of the All People&#x27;s Congress (APC). The same year, he succeeded President Siaka Stevens by becoming the only candidate in a one-party election in the form of a referendum on 8 October 1985.

Momoh became the second President of Sierra Leone and he served from November 28, 1985, to April 29, 1992.

Momoh declared a state of economic emergency early in his rule, granting himself greater control over Sierra Leone&#x27;s economy, but he was not regarded as a dictator. Instead, his people viewed him as far too weak and inattentive to the affairs of state, allowing his notoriously corrupt advisors to manipulate matters behind the scenes.

Momoh had inherited a disintegrating economy from his predecessor and he was unable to stop the trend. The country&#x27;s currency decreased in value. Sierra Leone reached the point under President Momoh where it could not afford to import gasoline and fuel oil, and the country went without electricity for months at a time.

Momoh had also inherited a system that was rife with corruption and the instability which corruption led to. Momoh took huge strides to root out graft, cronyism, embezzlement, influence peddling and extortion from within Sierra Leone&#x27;s government. International observers considered him mostly successful in these endeavors. This led to him forming a good relationship with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and American President Ronald Reagan, who were encouraged by advisors to meet with Momoh and form a good partnership with him as a way of welcoming Sierra Leone out of the instability it had fallen into for so much of the 1970s and 1980s. Both leaders increased aid to Sierra Leone and increased governmental cooperation between their governments and that of Momoh&#x27;s administration throughout 1987 and early 1988.

===1987 treason trial===

On 23 March 1987, police reported that a group of conspirators was plotting to assassinate Momoh and stage a coup d&#x27;état after they raided a house in Freetown and discovered a cache of weapons, including rocket launchers.

James Bambay Kamara, the Inspector General of the Sierra Leone Police, gave the order to arrest First Vice President Francis Minah, G.M.T. Kaikai, Jamil Sahid Mohamed and fifteen others.

Minah was a personal friend of Momoh and while he did not personally believe that Minah was involved in the plot, he did not want to oppose Inspector General Kamara. Momoh did not intervene on behalf of Minah.

The treason trial went on for five months until October 1987 when the jury delivered a guilty verdict. The former First Vice President and 17 others were convicted of treason and sentenced to death. Jamil Sahid Mohamed escaped to Lebanon where he remained in exile. They were executed on warrants signed by Momoh. A team of international oberservers from Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Algeria and South Korea all concurred that the trial was justified, and was not politically motivated.

===The 1991 Persian Gulf War===

Under Momoh&#x27;s leadership, Sierra Leone joined the coalition of nations that opposed Saddam Hussein&#x27;s occupation of Kuwait.

===The SCIPA Group===

The SCIPA Group was an Israeli mineral company led by Nir Guaz that arrived in Sierra Leone in 1989. SCIPA bought its way into Momoh&#x27;s favor by providing the government with loans and enabling Sierra Leone to enter into negotiations with the International Monetary Fund. On Christmas Eve 1989, Momoh had Guaz arrested, charged with economic sabotage and deported from Sierra Leone.

In September 1991, after the start of the Sierra Leone Civil War, Momoh ushered in a new constitution which dismantled the one-party state established in 1978 and instituted multiparty democracy. He also played a great part in dissolving tribalism. He was congratulated on this by British Prime Minister John Major and American President George H. W. Bush, who both declared these reforms as &quot;important steps towards democratization&quot; and &quot;essential steps forward.&quot; Momoh said John Major had proven to be a &quot;genuine friend of Sierra Leone&quot; and he referred to George H.W. Bush as a &quot;great leader of the world.&quot;

==Military coup==

Unfortunately, Momoh&#x27;s efforts at reform came too late to rescue Sierra Leone from chaos. He was overthrown in a military coup staged by Valentine Strasser, a 25-year-old army captain, in April 1992.

In April 1992, a group of young soldiers marched to Freetown from the war front where they had been fighting the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) led by Foday Sankoh. Incensed by terrible working conditions, unpaid salaries and a lack of government support they staged a coup d&#x27;état.

On 29 April 1992, the soldiers, led by Captain Valentine Strasser announced the military coup on the radio.

Momoh fled to Guinea and sought political asylum.

==Exile and death==

Momoh was granted political asylum in neighboring Guinea by President Lansana Conté. He took up residence in a mansion in Nongo Tadi, Conakry. Momoh died on August 2, 2003, at the age of 66, Momoh spent the last years of his life as a guest of the military government in Guinea. Ironically, Foday Sankoh had died a few days earlier.

==Honours==

In 1971, Momoh was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. He was decorated as an Officer of the Order of the Rokel in 1974 by President Siaka Stevens.

<text>Loughgall Football Club is a semi-professional Northern Irish football club currently playing in the NIFL Premiership. The club has been managed by Dean Smith since 2016.

==History==
The club, founded in 1967, is situated in the village of Loughgall, near Armagh in County Armagh and they play their home games in the village at Lakeview Park. The club was accepted into the old Irish League B Division in 1991, having played largely at junior level prior. Alfie Wylie is their longest serving manager, being in charge from 1986 to 1999. In the 1996–97 season, the club would have a good season, notably defeating Cliftonville in the League Cup, winning the Bob Radcliffe cup and reaching the semi-final of the Irish Cup. In the space of four years, the Lakeview Park side would win four consecutive B Divisions however would not be granted election to the 1st Division, being overlooked for other, arguably bigger clubs further down the league table.

===First Premiership foray, Championship era and Premiership return (2004-) ===
They achieved senior status in 2004 on promotion to the Irish Premier League, but reverted to intermediate status upon relegation in 2007. In 2007, under the management of Niall Currie, the club had their most successful season, winning the first division, Bob Radciffe, Mid Ulster Cup, Intermediate Cup and Carnegie League Cup. The villagers would win the league again in 2009–10 but would not be promoted.
On 3 March 2018, Loughgall defeated Glenavon 2–1 to reach the semi-final of the Irish Cup for the first time since 1997.

In April 2023, the club would return to the NIFL Premiership for the first time since 2007, following a 3–1 win away to Dundela. In being promoted, the village of Loughgall would become the smallest settlement, with a population of 283, to have a top flight team in Europe. The club would start their season away to Newry City. The club would perform incredibly well in the top flight, securing a notable victory over champions Larne, and finishing well clear of the relegation zone. The villagers plaudits would see manager Dean Smith receive Manager of the Year from the NIFWA.
Striker Benji Magee had been subject of significant interest from Larne, Glentoran and Walsall following a strong campaign with the club, before securing a move to champions Larne in August 2024.

<doc id="837215" wikidata="Q5542564" url="?curid=837215" title="George Monckton-Arundell, 8th Viscount Galway">
<text>George Vere Arundell Monckton-Arundell, 8th Viscount Galway, (24 March 1882 – 27 March 1943) was a British politician. He served as the fifth Governor-General of New Zealand from 1935 to 1941.

==Early life==

George Vere Arundell Monckton-Arundell Galway was born on 24 March 1882. His parents were George Monckton-Arundell, 7th Viscount Galway and Vere Gosling. He had one sibling: Violet Frances Monckton-Arundell (wife of married Lt.-Col. Geoffrey Henry Julian FitzPatrick, son of Edward Skeffington-Smyth).

He received his education at a preparatory school in Berkshire before attending Eton College (1895–1900) and Christ Church College, University of Oxford (1900–1904). He read Modern History and graduated with Bachelor of Arts and took the Master of Arts subsequently (this degree at Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin is an elevation in rank and not a postgraduate qualification).

Lord Galway succeeded his father to the family&#x27;s Irish peerage in 1931.

==Career==
===Military career===
Monckton-Arundell was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Nottinghamshire (Sherwood Rangers) Yeomanry on 1 January 1900, and promoted to lieutenant on 11 June 1902. In 1904, he joined the First Life Guards, the senior regiment of the British Army that makes up the Household Cavalry, where he rose to the rank of colonel. During the First World War he was appointed as adjutant general and quartermaster general. He was of the Royal Artillery (1933–35). In 1933 he was appointed Colonel Commandant of the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) until 1935, when he relinquished it on appointment as Governor-General of New Zealand. Upon retirement from his post as governor-general he returned as Colonel Commandant of the HAC until his death. He was also appointed Honorary Colonel of the 7th (Robin Hood) Battalion, Sherwood Foresters (later 42nd (The Robin Hoods, Sherwood Foresters) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers) in 1933.

===Political ambitions===
In 1910, Monckton-Arundell attempted to follow his father into the House of Commons. He contested the Scarborough constituency in the January and December elections of 1910, but was unsuccessful both times.

===Governor-General of New Zealand===
Viscount Galway was Governor-General of New Zealand from 12 April 1935 to 3 February 1941. His military background made an impression with cabinet ministers of the time. His term was twice extended because of the Second World War. Viscount Galway and his wife received numerous gifts during his time as governor-general. Some were returned to New Zealand around the time of the sale of the family house Serlby Hall, and were donated to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in 1980.

Galway was a freemason. During his term as governor-general, he was also Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of New Zealand. In the 1937 Coronation Honours, he was appointed a member of the Privy Council.

===Later years===
Upon his return to England, Galway held the honorary post of Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire under the 7th Duke of Portland.

==Personal life==
Viscount Galway married Lucia Margaret White, daughter of the 3rd Baron Annaly, in 1922. They had four children:

* Mary Victoria Monckton (1924–2010), who married David Henry Fetherstonhaugh, son of Lt.-Col. Timothy Fetherstonhaugh, in 1947. They divorced in 1972 and she married Maj. Robert Patricius Chaworth-Musters, son of Col. John Neville Chaworth-Musters, in 1974.
* Celia Ella Vere Monckton (1925–1997), who married Sir Joshua Rowley, 7th Baronet, son of Lt.-Col. Sir Charles Rowley, 6th Baronet, in 1959.
* Isabel Cynthia Monckton (b. 1926), who married John King, Baron King of Wartnaby, son of Albert John King, in 1970.
* Simon George Robert Monckton-Arundell (1929–1971), who married Lady Theresa Jane Fox-Strangways, daughter of Harry Fox-Strangways, 7th Earl of Ilchester, in 1953.

He died suddenly on 27 March 1943 in Blyth.

<doc id="837245" wikidata="Q809507" url="?curid=837245" title="Bartolomeo Montagna">
<text>Bartolomeo (or Bartolommeo) Montagna (, , ; 1450?– 11 October 1523) was an Italian Renaissance painter who mainly worked in Vicenza. He also produced works in Venice, Verona, and Padua. He is most famous for his many Madonnas and his works are known for their soft figures and depiction of eccentric marble architecture. He is considered to be heavily influenced by Giovanni Bellini, in whose workshop he might have worked around 1470. Benedetto Montagna, a productive engraver, was his son and pupil and active until about 1540. He was mentioned in Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; as a student of Andrea Mantegna but this is widely contested by art historians.

==Life==
He was born Bartolomeo Cincani and later changed his name to Bartolomeo Montagna. The first known written record of his existence is from 1459 and lists him as a minor. The first known documentation of him as an adult is in 1480 as a witness of a will. Differences in two documents regarding his father&#x27;s property from 1467 and 1469 imply he became an adult between those two years. Because of the lack of formal documentation of his birth and confusion on the age of legal adulthood in Vicenza at that time, there is much debate as to his actual birthdate. Some scholars have agreed on close to 1450 while others place him closer to 1453-1454.

His family originated in Brescia, Italy and later moved to Biron around 1450 before settling in Vicenza sometime by 1460. His brother, Baldissera, was a goldsmith. For most of his life through his death he was a resident of Vicenza and lived in a house he purchased directly across from the Church of San Lorenzo in 1484. From 1469-1475 Montagna was in Venice before returning to Vicenza and starting his career as a painter. In 1509, he moved from Vicenza to Padua likely due to the war in Vicenza, and remained there until 1514.

The identity of his wife is unknown, but they had three sons. One of his sons, Benedetto Montagna, was also an artist famous for his engravings. His other two sons, Filippo and Paolo are mentioned in some contracts but absent from his will. Bartolomeo Montagna died on October 11, 1523. He left the majority of his possessions and his practice to his son, Benedetto.

== Career ==
Because the birthdate of Montagna is unknown, there is also debate as to when exactly he began his career and how old he was at the time. Throughout his career, his works are characterized by a simple, laconic nature. His figures often appear solemn and plastic in form.

=== Early works (1480s–1499) ===

His first known documented commission was for two paintings for the Scuola Grande di San Marco in Venice. The paintings were contracted to depict the Deluge (flood myth) and another scene from Genesis, however their final status is unknown as they were destroyed in a fire in 1485. The next known record of Montagna&#x27;s work is for an altarpiece in the hospital of Vicenza, of which the current whereabouts are also unknown.

His first extant painting is from September 1487 (as inscribed on the back of the work) for a painting of The &quot;Virgin and Child with Saint Sebastian and Roch&quot;. A small work intended for private use, it depicts the figures in a marble enclosure with a Vicentine landscape in the background. This painting also shows Montagna&#x27;s first known use of trachyte marble, a unique texture of marble, which is seen in most of his works. Around this time, he was also commissioned to do the high altarpiece of San Bartolomeo of Vicenza, of which the exact date is often debated. This shows influences from multiple works of Giovanni Bellini located Venice that are also undated. In 1490 he painted an altarpiece for the Certosa di Pavia showing the &quot;Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saint John the Baptist and Jerome&quot;. In 1491 he painted the altarpiece, the semi-dome, and other wall frescos for the oratory dedicated to St. Blaise at the church of Santi Nazaro e Celso in Verona. The semidome depicts St. Blaise with companions and the walls depict other scenes from the legends of St. Blaise. These works are noted for their realistic gaunt figures. From 1497-1499 he was paid monthly to work on an altarpiece for the Squarzi family. His final payment was in the form of a piece of property which he kept until 1503. This was located in a chapel in the Church of San Michele and entitled &quot;Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints&quot;. The outlines of this painting are very bold compared to his other works and it features detailed drapery.
His early works are generally characterized by the use of trachyte marble architecture and a particular positioning of the Virgin&#x27;s hand, showing the middle and ring-finger touching and widely separated from the index and pinky finger. They also are usually distinguished by their symmetry, organization, equally distributed light, and plastic-like quality to the figures.

=== Maturity (1499–1507) ===

An altarpiece in San Michele at Vicenza (&quot;Virgin and Child with Four Saints and Music-making Angels&quot;) from 1499 is considered by many art historians to be a turning point in Montagna&#x27;s style. This development in his style is characterized by change in tone and use of warmer and richer colors. This particular painting depicts an outdoor scene and is a variation of a work by Giovanni Bellini. Around this time he also completed another Bellinesque altarpiece for San Bartolomeo in Vicenza, &quot;Madonna and Child with Saint Monica and Mary.&quot; In 1500 Montagna completed a Pieta in the Church of the Madonna del Monte. The painting depicts the Virgin Mary holding Christ&#x27;s dead body and Mary Magdalen kissing his feet. They are flanked by St. John and St. Joseph. This features dull color and the use continuous lines as a compositional element, a growing trend in renaissance paintings. This painting is characterized by a less rigid form than Montagna&#x27;s previous works. In the same year he also completed the &quot;Virgin and St. Joseph Adoring Christ&quot; in the Church of Orgiano. This depicts the infant Jesus sitting upright, flanked by the soft figures of the Virgin and St. Joseph.

Around this time the Bishop of Vicenza, Cardinal Battista Zeno, also commissioned Montagna to create a painting of the &quot;Virgin and Child with Eight Saints&quot; for the Cathedral of Vicenza. This work was lost after 1779 but is documented in multiple records. In 1504 Montagna travelled to Verona to complete frescos for the choir and vaults of the Cappella di San Biagio depicting many scenes of St. Blaise. Due to the success of this work, in 1507 he was commissioned to do the altarpiece for the Church of San Sebastiano in Verona, depicting the &quot;Virgin and Child Enthroned with St. Sebastian and St. Jerome.&quot; This work is characterized by brightly colored architecture, an oddly shaped throne, and elaborate outfits. After returning to Vicenza, Montagna completed a painting of &quot;Madonna between Saint Anthony and John the Evangelists&quot; for San Lorenzo. This is often considered the height of Montagna&#x27;s paintings.

Montagna&#x27;s style at this time is noted for its eccentric qualities despite the trend of a more mellow style that was adopted by his peers. His paintings frequently featured bright colors, decorative architecture, detailed drapery, and sharp angles. Despite the bright colors and sharp angles, the human figures pictured in them were often fuller and softer.

=== Late works (1507–1522) ===
The last known dated painting of Montagna&#x27;s is from 1507 although there are many paintings that have been dated by scholars after this time. Paintings from the last 15 years of his life are often considered a decline from the height of his career. His style was noticeably different in the years he spent in Padua (1509-1514), showing more landscapes, sunsets and warm colors incorporated with his signature architecture look. His style was more inconsistent, but often included fuller figures, deep shadows and less angular details. Examples of works Montagna&#x27;s time in Padua featuring this style are the &quot;Exhumation of St. Anthony&quot; for the Scuola di San Antonio and the &quot;Virgin and Child with Four Saints&quot; in Saint Maria in Vanzo. In 1517 Montagna returned to Vicenza. In 1522 he was commissioned by the Scuola di San Giuseppe to paint an altarpiece for Cologna Veneta. This depicts the Virgin, Child, 3 shepherds, and St. Joseph and St. Sebastian.

== Influences ==
There is no written record of Montagna&#x27;s training as a painter but there are many speculations and debates about his influences. In the second edition of Vasari&#x27;s Lives, Vasari mentions that Montagna learned to draw from Andrea Mantegna but does not specify if he did this as an actual pupil or if he just privately studied Mantegna&#x27;s works. It is generally agreed on that Montagna was influenced by Giovanni Bellini, Antonello da Messina, and Alvise Vivarni. It is generally accepted that Bellini had the most prolific influence on Montagna&#x27;s works, but to whether he was actually a pupil of any of these artists and in what order is highly debated. Montagna&#x27;s use of intricate and angular drapery is linked to the works of Vivarni. His works inspired by Antonello are characterized by rounded forms whereas those inspired by Bellini feature thinner and sharper figures. His transition to use of brighter and richer colorings later in life are also attributed to Bellini&#x27;s influence. A drawing with a previously mistranslated note was attributed to Montagna, but has now been identified as a gift from Bellini to Montagna. This still however does not confirm Bellini as Montagna&#x27;s master as it was common among artists of the renaissance to gift each other drawings. Many of Montagna&#x27;s paintings borrow compositions from these mentioned artists, a common practice in Italian renaissance painting.

<text>Lurgan Celtic Football Club is a Northern Irish intermediate football club based in Lurgan, County Armagh, that currently plays in the Mid-Ulster Football League Junior Division 1. The club was founded 1903 and reformed in 1970, and plays in a strip based on Scottish team Celtic. On 15 August 2019, Lurgan Celtic announced that its senior side would withdraw from the NIFL and implement new youth academy structures, with a view to restarting its senior teams for the 2020–21 season. Lurgan Celtic resumed senior football activities at the bottom of the Mid-Ulster Football League pyramid, upon the commencement of the 2020–21 season.

==History==

A club by the name of Lurgan Celtic was originally formed in 1903, with its name slanting towards the Roman Catholic community of Lurgan, adopting the name and colours of Glasgow Celtic, a popular club among the Irish Catholics population of Glasgow and the west of Scotland. The Gaelic Athletic Association was in its early stages and was keen to promote Gaelic games and association football in particular, perceived as &quot;foreign&quot;, was discouraged. A change in attitudes gradually took hold in the early 1970s and Lurgan Celtic was reborn, subsequently rising to become one of the strongest clubs in the Craigavon area. The club won several honours in Mid-Ulster Football League Divisions &amp; Cup competitions in various age groups, including several senior honours in that league, during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.

Irish Football League membership remained elusive during these years, partly due to the presence of Glenavon down the road at a time when the IFA was trying to reach out to new footballing towns. There was also a suggestion that it was the club&#x27;s nationalist stance as they pushed for membership of what was considered a predominantly Unionist league that stood in their way. So strongly was this felt that the club joined forces with Belfast club Donegal Celtic, another club that took its name and kit from the Glasgow club, and threatened the league with legal action to gain membership. The restructuring of the league in the early part of the 21st century eventually resulted in both Celtic clubs gaining admission to the Irish Football League Second Division for the 2002–03 season.

In 2003, the club closed their town centre ground Grattan Park and relocated to share Oxford United&#x27;s ground on the edge of Lurgan at Knockramer Park, which offered better facilities.

Promotion to the Intermediate League First Division was achieved in 2006–07, but in 2008 the club failed to meet the criteria for a place in the new IFA Championship, and found itself in the IFA Interim League for the 2008–09 season. They made the necessary improvements to gain admission to the newly formed third tier, IFA Championship 2, for the 2009–10 season. After seven seasons of consolidation in Championship 2 with the occasional risk of relegation, Celtic rose to the 2014–15 NIFL Championship 2 title, achieving promotion to the national second tier, Championship 1.

On the back of their title success the previous season, Celtic reached the quarter-finals for the first time ever in the 2015–16 Irish Cup. The club were drawn to face senior NIFL Premiership side and beaten Irish Cup finalists the previous year, Portadown away at Shamrock Park. Celtic stunned Portadown by taking a 2–0 lead after 54 minutes. However, Portadown came back into the match after 70 minutes with two goals of their own to level the score at 2–2. However, Lurgan Celtic had the last say, and scored a last-minute penalty to win 3–2 and cause a major upset by eliminating Portadown, and reaching the semi-finals of the cup for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. The match was Portadown&#x27;s final match under the management of Ronnie McFall. After the match, the Portadown manager resigned, ending his reign at the club after 29 years. In the Irish Cup semi-final they were defeated 3–0 by Linfield with Aaron Burns scoring a hat-trick.

Despite the achievement of reaching the Irish-Cup semi-finals, manager Colin Malone resigned at the end of the 2016-17 season and the club endured a period of instability. The appointment of Brendan Shannon as Celtic player-manager could not prevent a downturn in results, and Shannon left halfway through the 2017-18 season, to be succeeded by Frankie Wilson. By this point, relegation to the third tier had become an inevitability; Celtic finished the season 20 points adrift of 11th-placed Dergview.

Life in the NIFL Premier Intermediate League started with another managerial change, with former Glenavon, Spurs and Northern Ireland winger Gerard McMahon taking the reins at Knockramer Park. This, however, failed to stem the club&#x27;s decline, as they finished second-bottom of the division, on 19 points.

A 17-year spell in the Northern Ireland Football League ended on 15 August 2019, as the club announced its intention to withdraw from the Premier Intermediate League, with a view to reforming youth structures and resuming senior football activities for the 2020–21 season. It was announced on 29 June 2020 that Lurgan Celtic&#x27;s application to join the Mid-Ulster Football League was accepted, and the club was due to play in the MUFL Junior Division 3 for the 2020–21 season.

<doc id="837251" wikidata="Q103598" url="?curid=837251" title="Luc Montagnier">
<text>Luc Montagnier ( , ; 18 August 1932 – 8 February 2022) was a French virologist and joint recipient, with and , of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He worked as a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and as a full-time professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China.

In 2017, Montagnier was criticised by other academics for using his Nobel prize status to &quot;spread dangerous health messages outside of his field of knowledge&quot;. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Montagnier promoted the lab-leak theory that SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, was deliberately created and escaped from a laboratory. Such a claim has been rejected by some virologists.

==Early life and education==
Montagnier was born in Chabris in central France. Montagnier became interested in science as a teenager. He studied science at the University of Poitiers, France, and then became an assistant in the Faculty of Sciences at Sorbonne University, where he obtained a PhD.

==Career==
In 1960, Montagnier moved to Carshalton, UK as a postdoctoral fellow at the now defunct Virus Research Unit of the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom). In 1963, he moved to the Glasgow Institute of Virology. He developed a soft agar culture medium to culture viruses.

From 1965 until 1972 he was Laboratory Chief at the Institut Curie, then moved to the Institut Pasteur working on the effects of interferon on viruses.

===Discovery of HIV===
In 1982, Willy Rozenbaum, a clinician at the &quot;Hôpital Bichat&quot; hospital in Paris, asked Montagnier for assistance in establishing the cause of a mysterious new syndrome, AIDS (known at the time as &quot;gay-related immune deficiency&quot; or GRID). Rozenbaum had suggested at scientific meetings that the cause of the disease might be a retrovirus. Montagnier and members of his group at the Pasteur Institute, notably including Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Jean-Claude Chermann, had extensive experience with retroviruses. Montagnier and his team examined samples taken from Rozenbaum&#x27;s AIDS patients in 1983 and found the virus that would later become known as HIV in a lymph node biopsy. They named it &quot;lymphadenopathy-associated virus&quot;, or LAV, since it was not then clear that it was the cause of AIDS, and published their findings in the journal &quot;Science&quot; on 20 May 1983.

A team led by Robert Gallo of the United States published similar findings in the same issue of &quot;Science&quot; and later confirmed the discovery of the virus and presented evidence that it caused AIDS. Gallo called the virus &quot;human T-lymphotropic virus type III&quot; (HTLV-III) because of perceived similarities with HTLV-I and -II, which had previously been discovered in his lab. Because of the timing of the discoveries, whether Montagnier&#x27;s or Gallo&#x27;s group was first to isolate HIV was for many years the subject of an acrimonious dispute. HIV isolates usually have a high degree of variability because the virus mutates rapidly. In comparison, the first two-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates, Lai/LAV (formerly LAV, isolated at the Pasteur Institute) and Lai/IIIB (formerly HTLV-IIIB, isolated from a pooled culture at the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute) were strikingly similar in sequence, suggesting that the two isolates were in fact the same, and likely from the same source.

In November 1990, the Office of Scientific Integrity at the National Institutes of Health attempted to clear up the matter by commissioning a group at Roche to analyze archival samples established at the Pasteur Institute and the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute between 1983 and 1985. The group, led by American epidemiologist Sheng-Yung Chang, examined archival specimens and concluded in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1993 that the American sample in fact originated from the French lab.

Chang determined that the French group&#x27;s LAV was a virus from one patient that had contaminated a culture from another. On request, Montagnier&#x27;s group had sent a sample of this culture to Gallo, not knowing it contained two viruses. It then contaminated the pooled culture on which Gallo was working.

Before the 1993 publication of Chang&#x27;s results, Gallo&#x27;s lab was accused and initially found guilty of &quot;minor misconduct&quot; by the Office of Scientific Integrity in 1991, and then by the newly created Office of Research Integrity in 1992 for the misappropriation of a sample of HIV produced at the Pasteur Institute. The subsequent publication in 1993 of Chang&#x27;s investigation cleared Gallo&#x27;s lab of the charges, although his reputation had already been tainted by the accusations.

Today it is agreed that Montagnier&#x27;s group first isolated HIV, but Gallo&#x27;s group is credited with discovering that the virus causes AIDS and with generating much of the science that made the discovery possible, including a technique previously developed by Gallo&#x27;s lab for growing T cells in the laboratory. When Montagnier&#x27;s group first published their discovery, they said HIV&#x27;s role in causing AIDS &quot;remains to be determined.&quot;

The question of whether the true discoverers of the virus were French or American was more than a matter of prestige. A US government patent for the AIDS test, filed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services and based on what was claimed to be Gallo&#x27;s identification of the virus, was at stake. In 1987, both governments attempted to end the dispute by arranging to split the prestige of the discovery and the proceeds from the patent 50–50, naming Montagnier and Gallo co-discoverers. The two scientists continued to dispute each other&#x27;s claims until 1987.

It was not until French President François Mitterrand and American President Ronald Reagan met in person that the major issues were ironed out. The scientists finally agreed to share credit for the discovery of HIV, and in 1986, both the French and the US names (LAV and HTLV-III) were dropped in favor of the new term &quot;human immunodeficiency virus&quot; (virus de l&#x27;immunodéficience humaine, abbreviated HIV or VIH) (Coffin, 1986). They concluded that the origin of the HIV-1 Lai/IIIB isolate discovered by Gallo was the same as that discovered by Montagnier (but not known by Montagnier to cause AIDS). This compromise allowed Montagnier and Gallo to end their feud and collaborate with each other again, writing a chronology that appeared in &quot;Nature&quot; that year.

On 29 November 2002 issue of &quot;Science&quot;, Gallo and Montagnier published a series of articles, one of which was co-written by both scientists, in which they acknowledged the pivotal roles that each had played in the discovery of HIV.

== Personal life and death ==
In 1961, Montagnier married Dorothea Ackerman, and they had three children. He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine on 8 February 2022, at the age of 89.

== Awards and honors ==
The 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi for the discovery of HIV. They shared the Prize with Harald zur Hausen, who discovered that human papilloma viruses can cause cervical cancer. Montagnier said he was &quot;surprised&quot; that Robert Gallo was not also recognized by the Nobel Committee: &quot;It was important to prove that HIV was the cause of AIDS, and Gallo had a very important role in that. I&#x27;m very sorry for Robert Gallo.&quot; According to Maria Masucci, a member of the Nobel Assembly, &quot;there was no doubt as to who made the fundamental discoveries.&quot;

Montagnier was the co-founder of the World Foundation for AIDS Research and Prevention and co-directed the Program for International Viral Collaboration. He was the founder and a former president of the Houston-based World Foundation for Medical Research and Prevention. He received more than 20 major awards, including the National Order of Merit (Commander, 1986) and the Légion d&#x27;honneur (Knight: 1984; Officer: 1990; Commander: 1993; Grand Officer: 2009), He was a recipient of the Lasker Award and the Scheele Award (1986), the Louis-Jeantet Prize for medicine (1986), the Gairdner Award (1987), the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1987), King Faisal International Prize (1993) (known as the Arab Nobel Prize), and the Prince of Asturias Award (2000). He was also a member of the Académie Nationale de Médecine, and was awarded the honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) from Whittier College in 2010.

== Controversies ==
=== Electromagnetic signals from DNA ===

In 2009, Montagnier published two controversial independent research studies, one of which was entitled &quot;Electromagnetic Signals Are Produced by Aqueous Nanostructures Derived from Bacterial DNA Sequences&quot;. Jeff Reimers, of the University of Sydney, said that if its conclusions are true, &quot;these would be the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 years, demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry&quot;. The paper concluded that diluted DNA from pathogenic bacterial and viral species was able to emit &quot;specific radio waves&quot; and that &quot;these radio waves [are] associated with &#x27;nanostructures&#x27; in the solution that might be able to recreate the pathogen&quot;.

They were published in a new journal, of which he was chair of the editorial board, allegedly detecting electromagnetic signals from bacterial DNA (&quot;M. pirum&quot; and &quot;E. coli&quot;) in water that had been prepared using agitation and high dilutions, and similar research on electromagnetic detection of HIV RNA in the blood of AIDS patients treated by antiretroviral therapy.

=== Homeopathy ===
On 28 June 2010, Montagnier spoke at the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in Germany, &quot;where 60 Nobel prize winners had gathered, along with 700 other scientists, to discuss the latest breakthroughs in medicine, chemistry and physics.&quot; He &quot;stunned his colleagues ... when he presented a new method for detecting viral infections that bore close parallels to the basic tenets of homeopathy. Although fellow Nobel prize winners – who view homeopathy as quackery – were left openly shaking their heads, Montagnier&#x27;s comments were rapidly embraced by homeopaths eager for greater credibility. Cristal Sumner, of the British Homeopathic Association, said Montagnier&#x27;s work gave homeopathy &#x27;a true scientific ethos&#x27;.&quot;

When asked by Canada&#x27;s CBC &quot;Marketplace&quot; program if his work was indeed a theoretical basis for homeopathy as homeopaths had claimed, Montagnier replied that one &quot;cannot extrapolate it to the products used in homeopathy&quot;.

==== Responses, criticisms, and interviews ====
The homeopathy paper met with harsh criticism for not being peer-reviewed, and its claims unsubstantiated by modern mainstream conventions of physics and chemistry. In response to Montagnier&#x27;s statement that the generally unfavorable response is due to the &quot;non-understanding or misunderstanding of the breakthrough findings&quot;, blogger Andy Lewis has written that he has found it difficult to assert what the paper &quot;actually claims&quot;, saying: &quot;The paper ... lacks any rigour. ... important experimental steps are described dismissively in a sentence and little attempt is made to describe the detail of the work&quot;. While homeopaths claim his research as support for homeopathy, many scientists have greeted it with scorn and harsh criticism.

In a 24 December 2010 &quot;Science&quot; magazine interview entitled &quot;French Nobelist Escapes &#x27;Intellectual Terror&#x27; to Pursue Radical Ideas in China&quot;, he was questioned about his research and plans. In the interview he stated that Jacques Benveniste, whose controversial homeopathic work had been discredited, was &quot;a modern Galileo&quot;. When asked if he was not &quot;worried that your colleagues will think you have drifted into pseudo-science&quot;, he replied: &quot;No, because it&#x27;s not pseudoscience. It&#x27;s not quackery. These are real phenomena which deserve further study.&quot; He also mentioned that his applications for funding had been turned down and that he was leaving his home country to set up shop in China so he could escape what he called the &quot;intellectual terror&quot; which he claimed had prevented others from publishing their results. He stated that China&#x27;s Shanghai Jiao Tong University is more &quot;open minded&quot; to his research. There he was chairman of the editorial board of a new journal which published his research.

Montagnier was also questioned on his beliefs about homeopathy, to which he replied: &quot;I can&#x27;t say that homeopathy is right in everything. What I can say now is that the high dilutions are right. High dilutions of something are not nothing. They are water structures which mimic the original molecules. We find that with DNA, we cannot work at the extremely high dilutions used in homeopathy; we cannot go further than a 10−18 dilution, or we lose the signal. But even at 10−18, you can calculate that there is not a single molecule of DNA left. And yet we detect a signal.&quot;

A 12 January 2011 &quot;New Scientist&quot; editorial described the controversial nature of the research, while also noting how many researchers &quot;reacted with disbelief&quot;, with chemist and university president Gary Schuster comparing it to &quot;pathological science&quot;. Evolutionary biologist PZ Myers also described the work as &quot;pathological science&quot;. He described the paper as &quot;one of the more unprofessional write-ups I&#x27;ve ever run across&quot;, and criticized the publication process as having an &quot;unbelievable turnaround&quot; time: &quot;another suspicious sign are the dates. This paper was submitted on 3 January 2009, revised on 5 January 2009, and accepted on 6 January 2009&quot;, leading him to ask: &quot;Who reviewed this, the author&#x27;s mother? Maybe someone even closer. Guess who the chairman of the editorial board is: Luc Montagnier.&quot;

On 25 May 2012, he gave the keynote address at the 2012 conference for AutismOne, an anti-vaccination group. Similar to the controversy he aroused by extolling homeopathy, his latest group, Chronimed, claimed to have made a discovery for autistic children that was sharply criticized by computational biologist Steven Salzberg.

In 2017, 106 academic scientists wrote an open letter &quot;calling [Montagnier] to order&quot;. The letter read: &quot;We, academics of medicine, cannot accept that one of our peers is using his Nobel prize [status] to spread dangerous health messages outside of his field of knowledge.&quot;

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
In 2020, Montagnier argued that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was man-made in a laboratory and that it might have been the result of an attempt to create a vaccine for HIV/AIDS. His allegation came after the United States had launched a probe into whether the virus came from a laboratory. According to Montagnier, the &quot;presence of elements of HIV and germ of malaria in the genome of coronavirus is highly suspect and the characteristics of the virus could not have arisen naturally.&quot; Montagnier&#x27;s conclusions were rejected as hasty by the scientific community, considering the gene sequences were common among similar organisms; no evidence arose that SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered. Bioinformatics analyses show that the common sequences are short, that their similarity is insufficient to support the hypothesis of common origin, and that the identified sequences were independent insertions which occurred at varied points during the evolution of coronaviruses.

In a 2021 interview with the French media group &quot;Hold Up&quot;, Montagnier claimed that the use of vaccinations for COVID was steering the evolution of new strains, and that the process of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) would cause vaccinated individuals to suffer more strongly. The former claim had no obvious basis in fact, while ADE had only ever been conclusively demonstrated for dengue virus infections, and not for COVID-19.

For his defense of such anti-scientific views, Montagnier has been cited as an example of the phenomenon called Nobel disease.

<doc id="837281" wikidata="Q505463" url="?curid=837281" title="Andrew Jackson Montague">
<text>Andrew Jackson Montague (October 3, 1862January 24, 1937; nickname &quot;Jack&quot;) was a Virginia lawyer and American politician. He served as the 44th governor of Virginia, from 1902 to 1906, and a Congressman from 1912 until his death in 1937. A Democrat, Montague was the first Virginia governor since the American Civil War not to have served in the Confederate military. Initially a Progressive, Governor Montague expanded the state capitol building, supported public education and the Good Roads Movement and opposed the Martin Organization. However, later as U.S. Congressman, he became a Conservative Democrat and supporter of the Byrd Organization.

==Early life and education==
The son of prominent Confederate and later state judge Robert Latane Montague, Andrew Jackson Montague was born in 1862 in Campbell County near Lynchburg, Virginia. He was named after his father&#x27;s youngest brother, a cadet at the Virginia Military Institute who died defending Richmond at the Battle of Gaines Mill months before during the American Civil War. After the war, his family returned to the Tidewater area; since their enslaved workers had been freed and many left, Montague worked on the family farm and attended schools in Middlesex County and Williamsburg.

After his father died in 1880, Montague left the farm and went to Richmond, Virginia. He attended Richmond College (predecessor to the University of Richmond), where he gained a reputation as a skilled orator and debater. After several years as a private tutor, Montague began legal studies at the University of Virginia, graduating with a law degree in 1885. He later received an honorary doctorate of laws degree from Brown University in 1905.

==Career==
After admission to the Virginia bar, Montague began his legal practice in Danville, while becoming increasing involved with the local Democratic party. In the presidential election campaign of 1892, Montague developed a relationship with Grover Cleveland, who then appointed Montague in 1893 as the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. Montague held that position five years, until, in 1898, he was elected as the Attorney General of Virginia.

==Governor==
While serving as attorney general, Montague became increasingly involved with the Virginia Progressive movement, which emphasized education reform and disfranchisement of black voters as a way to stem political corruption. Positioning himself as the independent alternative to Senator Thomas S. Martin&#x27;s political machine, Montague determined to make a run in the upcoming Virginia gubernatorial election. Running on the independent platform, Montague solidly defeated Martin&#x27;s candidate, Claude A. Swanson, for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Virginia.

Montague won 58.19% of the vote in the general election of 1901, easily defeating Republican John Hampton Hoge, as well as Prohibitionist O.C. Rucker, and Socialists Hugh Motter and John J. Quantz. He became the first Virginia governor since the Civil War who had not served with the Confederate Army.

Shortly after Montague&#x27;s inauguration, and with his support, the Virginia Constitution of 1902 was enacted without a referendum. Its poll taxes and literacy tests effectively disenfranchised black and poor white voters. Ironically, the new Constitution created a smaller and more easily controlled electorate, thus strengthening the Martin machine.
As governor, Montague enunciated a progressive agenda, and he made speeches throughout the state calling for progress toward &quot;good schools&quot; and &quot;good roads&quot;. His efforts on behalf of schools resulted in some tangible progress, particularly in terms of increased local funding, longer terms and school consolidation. For roads, he pressed for the creation of a state highway commission, which officially came into being two months after he left office. Montague also corresponded with progressives as varied as President Theodore Roosevelt, Clara Barton of the American Red Cross and Booker T. Washington of the Tuskegee Institute. He championed the primary process as a more open way to select political party candidates, which helped lead to the primary system being adopted for the first time in 1905. However, these accomplishments fell far short of Montague&#x27;s legislative ambitions, for which he blamed a hostile legislature and the political machine run by his long-time foe, Senator Martin.

In 1905, while still governor, Montague determined to make a run for the United States Senate against the incumbent Martin. Martin and Montague represented the two main factions within the Virginia Democratic party, and their contest would effectively determine which would control Virginia politics. Martin responded to the challenge by publicly embracing Montague&#x27;s main issues: good schools, good roads and the primary election process. Having minimized the differences between their positions and with a larger political organization, Senator Martin handily won re-election, leaving an embittered Montague to finish out his term as governor.

==Internationalist==
After leaving office as governor, Montague served as the dean of Richmond College Law School for three years, before returning to the private practice of law in 1909.

In July, 1906 Montague was among the American delegates at the Conference of American States meeting in Rio de Janeiro. He later was a delegate to the Third International Conference on Maritime Law at Brussels in 1909 and 1910, as well as a trustee of Carnegie Institute in Washington, D.C., and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He would become president of the American Society for Judicial Settlement of International Disputes in 1917, and serve as president of the American Peace Society (1920–1924). Montague was an &quot;outspoken Anglophile&quot; who was among a group of six Virginia congressmen consisting of himself as well as Patrick H. Drewry, S. Otis Bland, Joseph T. Deal, George C. Peery and Henry St. George Tucker III who spent much of the 1920s advocating closer relations between the United States and the United Kingdom.

==Congressman==

In 1912, Montague ran for the Richmond District seat in the United States House of Representatives. He defeated the Republican incumbent, and would retain for almost a quarter of a century.

A supporter of President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s internationalist agenda, Montague lost influence when the Republicans took control of Congress in the 1920s. Despite this, and a failed bid to gain appointment to the Supreme Court, Montague was respected by his colleagues, even acquiring the nickname &quot;Judge&quot;. In 1926, he was selected by the House as one of the impeachment managers that served as the prosecution the impeachment trial of Judge George W. English.

==Personal life==

He married Elizabeth Lyne Hoskins (1868 - 1951), daughter of a Middlesex county doctor, on December 11, 1889. They had two sons (one of whom died young, the other served heroically in World War I and became Brig. Gen. Robert Latane Montague Jr. (1897–1972)), as well as two daughters, Matilda Gay Montague Moore (1891–1988) and Janet Roy Montague Nunnally (1895–1977). Betsy Montague was very active in historic preservation in Alexandria, Virginia and in Williamsburg, and Gov. Montague corresponded with philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. who established Colonial Williamsburg. In 1934, the Montagues purchased Sandwich at Urbanna, Virginia.

==Death and legacy==

Congressman Montague died in office on January 24, 1937, after winning a narrow election against his first significant (primary) opposition in twenty-five years. He is interred in the family&#x27;s section at the graveyard of Christ Church in Saluda, Virginia.

<text>Petre Dumitrescu (; 18 February 1882 – 15 January 1950) was a Romanian general during World War II who led the Romanian Third Army on its campaign against the Red Army in the Eastern Front.

==Early life and military career==

Dumitrescu was born in Dobridor, Dolj County. He began his military training at the Artillery and Engineers Officers&#x27; School in 1901, graduating in 1903 with the rank of second lieutenant. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1906 and, five years later, to captain. That year, he was admitted into the Military Academy at Bucharest, graduating in 1913.

When World War I started, Dumitrescu was a major. Following the war, he climbed higher and higher in the military hierarchy, becoming a lieutenant colonel in 1920, a brigadier general in 1930, and a major general in 1937. Between 1937 and the beginning of World War II, Dumitrescu served as a military attaché in both Paris and Brussels. After returning to Romania from these postings, he was given command of the First Army.
==Initial successes==

On March 25, 1941, Dumitrescu was made commander of the Third Army, a post which he would hold for the duration of the war. On July 5, 1941, he attacked the Soviet forces in northern Bukovina and took Cernăuți (Chernivtsi), reclaiming territory occupied by Soviet troops since June 28, 1940. He then crossed the Prut to recover northern Bessarabia. The German Eleventh Army covered Dumitrescu&#x27;s right flank while he advanced towards the Dniester. At that point his army and the German 11th army switched places, with Italians continuing advancement over the Dniester towards the Southern Bug river, and Dumitrescu remaining on recovered Romanian territory. In September of that year, Dumitrescu repulsed a Soviet attempt to cross the Dniester in the east, behind the Eleventh Army.

After Adolf Hitler convinced Ion Antonescu to continue the war beyond Romania&#x27;s pre-1940 borders, Dumitrescu then led the Third Army to the Crimea, taking part in the Battle of the Sea of Azov. By October 10, the Third Army had marched 1,700 kilometres from Romania, fought four major battles and 42 minor engagements.

By this time, Dumitrescu&#x27;s Third Army had inflicted casualties of over 20,000 killed and 40,000 wounded and also captured 15,565 prisoners of war, 149 tanks, 128 artillery pieces, and more than 700 machine guns, while suffering 10,541 casualties (2,555 dead, 6,201 wounded, and 1,785 missing in action.)

For his effort in this campaign, Dumitrescu was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross, the second Romanian to receive the award after Ion Antonescu. Later on he was even given the Oak Leaves. In October, he was awarded the Order of Michael the Brave, 3rd class.

On July 18, 1942 he was made a general, thus becoming Antonescu&#x27;s second-in-command. Shortly after his promotion, Dumitrescu advanced towards the Taman Peninsula, between the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, creating a vital bridge between Axis forces in Europe and those deeper inside the Soviet Union.

==Retreat==

The German forces in Stalingrad were in dire need of assistance, and the German High Command transferred many of its troops to the besieged city, which meant the Third Army now had fewer troops to defend an increasingly large front. This was ameliorated, to a certain degree, by the High Command&#x27;s decision to incorporate all Romanian forces in the southwest of the Soviet Union into the Third Army. The High Command, however, chose to ignore Dumitrescu&#x27;s reports about a Soviet troop buildup in the southwest, as they did with his repeated suggestions to attack the Soviet bridgehead at Kletskaya.

In November 1942 the Red Army launched a devastating attack in the southwest, breaking through the Romanian line and forcing Dumitrescu into retreat. For a brief period, the Third Army dug in near the Chir River, but Soviet troops pushed them back. In December 1942, the decision was made to strategically retreat westwards.

Between 26 March and 24 August 1944, he commanded &quot;Army Group Dumitrescu&quot; which was composed of the German 6th Army, under command of Maximilian de Angelis and later Maximilian Fretter-Pico, and his own Romanian 3rd Army.

After the Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive, Dumitrescu&#x27;s plan was to reach Bucharest and avoid any engagements with the Red Army along the way. However, Red Army troops ambushed Dumitrescu. When what remained of the Third Army arrived in Bucharest, the Soviets had captured more than 130,000 Romanian soldiers.

By this time, however, as with the rest of Romania, Dumitrescu turned against Nazi Germany and captured more than 6,000 German prisoners of war. He retired in early September, 1944, as the Romanian Army and the Red Army retook Northern Transylvania and advanced into Hungary.

==After the war==

In 1946, Dumitrescu was put under house arrest and put on trial for war crimes by the new communist government, but was eventually acquitted because of a lack of evidence. He died of natural causes at his Bucharest home in 1950.

<text>The United Ulster Unionist Party (UUUP) was a unionist political party which existed in Northern Ireland between 1975 and 1984.

It emerged from a division in the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party in the late 1970s. Vanguard had traditionally opposed the concept of compulsory power sharing with nationalists enshrined in the Sunningdale Agreement, but after the failure of Sunningdale, the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention was set up to provide a forum with the aim of finding a new settlement for Northern Ireland. During the proceedings the leader of Vanguard, William Craig, proposed a voluntary coalition with the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party. Many in Vanguard found this anathema, including the party&#x27;s deputy leader Ernest Baird, Mid Ulster MP John Dunlop and East Belfast Convention member (and future Ulster Unionist Party leader) Reg Empey. They left Vanguard and formed the United Ulster Unionist Movement. Initially Baird denied that this was a party since the original aim was to create a single Unionist party. When this aim proved unattainable the UUUM relaunched as the United Ulster Unionist Party led by Baird with Empey as Deputy Leader.

Many critics highlighted the irony of the name, given that the UUUP was a breakaway from Vanguard, itself a breakaway from the Ulster Unionist Party and there were many other Unionist parties in existence.

The UUUP did not prosper long. In the 1979 general election Dunlop held his seat but only due to an agreement with other unionist parties to not divide the unionist vote where a nationalist might get elected. Elsewhere Baird stood in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, dividing the unionist vote but polling poorly. It has been argued that it was Baird&#x27;s candidacy that ensured a victory for Frank Maguire in the seat.

The decline was evident even before the local government elections of 1981 as 4 of the 12 UUUP councillors elected in 1977 had defected to other Unionist parties (2 to UUP, 1 to DUP and 1 to the Ulster Popular Unionist Party). The party had a miserable showing in the 1981 elections with its overall vote share declining from 2.8% in 1977 to 0.7% in 1981. It only won 5 council seats (a decline of 7 seats) and even then one of these was purely due to a quirk of the electoral system, as the party only polled 105 votes (1.6%) in Lisburn &#x27;E&#x27; against 1,909 (30.0%) for the DUP and 1,830 (28.7%) for the UUP. However they benefited from the other two Unionist parties only putting up one candidate each and benefitted from hefty transfers to win an unlikely seat.

In 1982 a new Northern Ireland Assembly was established to provide a degree of scrutiny over the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The UUUP got a derisory vote, with even Dunlop getting barely 3% of the vote in his Mid Ulster constituency. The party soon folded. Dunlop remained as MP for Mid Ulster until the 1983 general election but did not contest his seat. The formal end came in May 1984 when Baird dissolved the party and left it to individual members to choose which Unionist party to join in its wake.

<doc id="837299" wikidata="Q1255614" url="?curid=837299" title="Indo-Parthian kingdom">
<text>The Indo-Parthian kingdom was a Parthian kingdom founded by Gondophares, and active from 19 CE to c. 226 CE. At their zenith, they ruled an area covering parts of eastern Iran, various parts of Afghanistan and the northwest regions of the Indian subcontinent (most of modern Pakistan and parts of northwestern India). The rulers may have been members of the House of Suren, and the kingdom has even been called the &quot;Suren Kingdom&quot; by some authors.

The kingdom was founded in 19/20 when the governor of Drangiana (Sakastan) Gondophares declared independence from the Parthian Empire. He would later make expeditions to the east, conquering territory from the Indo-Scythians and Indo-Greeks, thus transforming his kingdom into an empire. The domains of the Indo-Parthians were greatly reduced following the invasions of the Kushans in the second half of the 1st. century. They managed to retain control of Sakastan, until its conquest by the Sasanian Empire in c. 224/5. In Baluchistan, the Paratarajas, a local Indo-Parthian dynasty, fell into the orbit of the Sasanian Empire circa 262 CE.

The Indo-Parthians are noted for the construction of the Buddhist monastery Takht-i-Bahi (UNESCO World Heritage Site) in Mardan, Pakistan.

==Gondophares I and his successors==

Gondophares I originally seems to have been a ruler of Seistan in what is today eastern Iran, probably a vassal or relative of the Apracarajas. He may have replaced previous Parthian governors of Seistan, such as Cheiroukes or Tanlismaidates. These Parthian satraps had been ruling the region of Sakastan since the time when Mithridates II (124–88 BC) had vanquished the Sakas of the region.

Around 20–10 BC, he made conquests in the former Indo-Scythian kingdom, perhaps after the death of the important ruler Azes. Gondophares became the ruler of areas comprising Arachosia, Seistan, Sindh, Punjab, and the Kabul valley, but it does not seem as though he held territory beyond eastern Punjab. Gondophares called himself &quot;King of Kings&quot;, a Parthian title that in his case correctly reflects that the Indo-Parthian empire was only a loose framework: a number of smaller dynasts certainly maintained their positions during the Indo-Parthian period, likely in exchange for their recognition of Gondophares and his successors. These smaller dynasts included the Apracarajas themselves, and Indo-Scythian satraps such as Zeionises and Rajuvula, as well as anonymous Scythians who struck imitations of Azes coins. The Ksaharatas also held sway in Gujarat, perhaps just outside Gondophares&#x27; dominions.
After the death of Gondophares I, the empire started to fragment. The name or title &quot;Gondophares&quot; was adapted by Sarpedones, who become Gondophares II and was possibly son of the first Gondophares. Even though he claimed to be the main ruler, Sarpedones’ rule was shaky and he issued a fragmented coinage in Sind, eastern Punjab and Arachosia in southern Afghanistan. The most important successor was Abdagases, Gondophares’ nephew, who ruled in Punjab and possibly in the homeland of Seistan. After a short reign, Sarpedones seems to have been succeeded by Orthagnes, who became Gondophares III Gadana. Orthagnes ruled mostly in Seistan and Arachosia, with Abdagases further east, during the first decades AD, and was briefly succeeded by his son Ubouzanes Coin. After 20 AD, a king named Sases, a nephew of the Apracaraja ruler Aspavarma, took over Abdagases’ territories and became Gondophares IV Sases. According to Senior, this is the Gondophares referred to in the Takht-i-Bahi inscription.

There were other minor kings: Sanabares was an ephemeral usurper in Seistan, who called himself Great King of Kings, and there was also a second Abdagases Coin, a ruler named Agata in Sind, another ruler called Satavastres Coin, and an anonymous prince who claimed to be brother of the king Arsaces, in that case an actual member of the ruling dynasty in Parthia.

But the Indo-Parthians never regained the position of Gondophares I, and from the middle of the 1st century AD the Kushans under Kujula Kadphises began absorbing the northern Indian part of the kingdom.

===Rulers of Turan and Sakastan (160-230 AD)===

The Indo-Parthians managed to retain control of Turan and Sakastan, which they ruled until the fall of the Parthian Empire at the hands of the Sasanian Empire circa 230 CE. Pahares I (160-230 AD) was a ruler of Turan following the partition of the remains of the Indo-Parthian kingdom. The kingdom of Sakastan was ruled by a second king with the name Sanabares II (160-175 AD). The Kingdoms of Turan and Sakastan ended when they submitted to the Sasanian ruler Ardeshir I circa 230 CE. These events were recorded by Al-Tabari, describing the arrival of envoys to Ardeshir at Gor:

==Archaeology and sources==

The city of Taxila is thought to have been a capital of the Indo-Parthians. Large strata were excavated by Sir John Marshall with a quantity of Parthian-style artifacts. The nearby temple of Jandial is usually interpreted as a Zoroastrian fire temple from the period of the Indo-Parthians.

Some ancient writings describe the presence of the Indo-Parthians in the area, such as the story of Saint Thomas the Apostle, who was recruited as a carpenter to serve at the court of king &quot;Gudnaphar&quot; (thought to be Gondophares) in India. The Acts of Thomas describes in chapter 17 Thomas&#x27; visit to king Gudnaphar in northern India; chapters 2 and 3 depict him as embarking on a sea voyage to India, thus connecting Thomas to the west coast of India.

As Senior points out, this Gudnaphar has usually been identified with the first Gondophares, who has thus been dated after the advent of Christianity, but there is no evidence for this assumption, and Senior&#x27;s research shows that Gondophares I could be dated even before 1 AD. If the account is even historical, Saint Thomas may have encountered one of the later kings who bore the same title.
The Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana is related by Philostratus in &quot;Life of Apollonius Tyana&quot; to have visited India, and specifically the city of Taxila around 46 AD. He describes constructions of the Greek type,
probably referring to Sirkap, and explains that the Indo-Parthian king of Taxila, named Phraotes, received a Greek education at the court of his father and spoke Greek fluently:
:

The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea is a surviving 1st century guide to the routes commonly being used for navigating the Arabian Sea. It describes the presence of Parthian kings fighting with each other in the area of Sindh, a region traditionally known at that time as &quot;Scythia&quot; due to the previous rule of the Indo-Scythians there:

:&quot;This river (Indus) has seven mouths, very shallow and marshy, so that they are not navigable, except the one in the middle; at which by the shore, is the market-town, Barbaricum. Before it there lies a small island, and inland behind it is the metropolis of Scythia, Minnagara; it is subject to Parthian princes who are constantly driving each other out.&quot; Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Chap 38

An inscription from Takht-i-Bahi bears two dates, one in the regnal year 26 of the Maharaja Guduvhara (again thought to be a Gondophares), and the year 103 of an unknown era.

===Religion of the Indo-Parthians===

We do not know the religion of the House of Suren although we know they were in religious conflict with the Zoroastrian Arsacid dynasty. Unlike the Indo-Greeks or Indo-Scythians, there are no explicit records of Indo-Parthian rulers supporting Buddhism, such as religious dedications, inscriptions, or even legendary accounts. Also, although Indo-Parthian coins generally closely follow Greek numismatics, they never display the Buddhist triratna symbol (apart from the later Sases), nor do they ever use depictions of the elephant or the bull, possible religious symbols which were profusely used by their predecessors. They are thought to have retained Zoroastrianism, being of Iranian extraction themselves. This Iranian mythological system was inherited from them by the later Kushans who ruled from the Peshawar-Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa region of Pakistan.

Coins of the Hindu deity Shiva have also been found issued in the reign of Gondophares I.

===Representation of Indo-Parthian devotees===

On their coins and in the art of Gandhara, Indo-Parthians are depicted with short crossover jackets and large baggy trousers, possibly supplemented by chap-like over-trousers. Their jackets are adorned with rows of decorative rings or medals. Their hair is usually bushy and contained with a headband, a practise largely adopted by the Parthians from the 1st century AD.

Individuals in Indo-Parthian attire are sometimes shown as actors in Buddhist devotional scenes. It is usually considered that most of the excavations that were done at Sirkap near Taxila by John Marshall relate to Indo-Parthian layers, although more recent scholarship sometimes relates them to the Indo-Greeks instead. These archaeological researches provided a quantity of Hellenistic artifacts combined with elements of Buddhist worship (stupas). Some other temples, such as nearby Jandial may have been used as a Zoroastrian fire temple.

===Buddhist sculptures===
The statues found at Sirkap in the late Scythian to Parthian level (level 2, 1–60 AD) suggest an already developed state of Gandharan art at the time or even before Parthian rule. A multiplicity of statues, ranging from Hellenistic gods, to various Gandharan lay devotees, are combined with what are thought as some of the early representations of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas. Today, it is still unclear when the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara exactly emerged, but the findings in Sirkap do indicate that this art was already highly developed before the advent of the Kushans.

===Stone palettes===

Numerous stone palettes found in Gandhara are considered as good representatives of Indo-Parthian art. These palettes combine Greek and Persian influences, together with a frontality in representations which is considered as characteristic of Parthian art. Such palettes have only been found in archaeological layers corresponding to Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian rule, and are essentially unknown the preceding Mauryan layers or the succeeding Kushan layers.

Very often these palettes represent people in Greek dress in mythological scenes, but a few of them represent people in Parthian dress (head-bands over bushy hair, crossed-over jacket on a bare chest, jewelry, belt, baggy trousers). A palette from the Naprstek Museum in Prague shows an Indo-Parthian king seated crossed-legged on a large sofa, surrounded by two attendants also in Parthian dress. They are shown drinking and serving wine.
==Silk Road transmission of Buddhism==

Some pockets of Parthian rule remained in the East, even after the takeover by the Sassanids in 226. From the 2nd century several Central-Asian Buddhist missionaries appeared in the Chinese capital cities of Luoyang and sometimes Nanjing, where they particularly distinguished themselves by their translation work. The first known translators of Buddhist texts into Chinese are actually Parthian missionaries, distinguished in Chinese by their Parthian surname &quot;An&quot;, for &quot;Anshi&quot;, &quot;country of the Arsacids&quot;.
*An Shih Kao, was a Parthian prince, who made the first known translations of Hinayana Buddhist texts into Chinese (148–170).
*An Hsuan, was a Parthian merchant who became a monk in China 181 AD.
*Tan-ti (c. 254), a Parthian monk.
*An Fajin (281–306), a monk of Parthian origins.

<text>AlterNIC was an unofficial, controversial Internet domain name registry that relied on an alternative DNS root. The primary purpose of the project was to challenge the monopoly of InterNIC, the official governing body for generic top-level domains (gTLDs) until the creation of the ICANN in 1998. AlterNIC offered second level domain registration in its own TLDs at lower prices than InterNIC. However, these domain names could only be resolved by name servers that were specifically configured to use the AlterNIC root zone. The project is now defunct; the domain name alternic.net is parked and no longer associated with AlterNIC.

== History ==
Eugene Kashpureff and Diane Boling created AlterNIC in 1995, defining it as a privately developed and operated Internet network information center and domain name registry service, with the purpose of enhancing the Internet with new information services.

In the mid-1990s, the Internet was in a governance transition phase. Until then, the organizational structure of the network was still heavily influenced by its military, academic and governmental origins. At the same time, there was a rapidly increasing interest of private companies, followed by the general public, to gain access to the Internet. Domain names began to play a crucial role in business visibility, and the number of registrations grew exponentially.

Initially, registration of new domain names and their maintenance involved no direct costs for the registrant. In 1995, the National Science Foundation authorized Network Solutions (NSI), the private company that they had mandated to maintain and operate the registries, to begin charging registrants an annual fee. Some perceived this move as unfair, given that the market was closed to competitors.

Eugene Kashpureff and company were among them and they decided to create an alternative registry to challenge the monopoly of NSI.

== Alternative TLDs ==
AlterNIC started operating their registries even though their name servers were not included in the Internet official root zone. As a result, only users of manually reconfigured name servers were able to resolve AlterNIC names.

AlterNIC offered several dozens of alternative TLDs, such as

* .alt
* .biz (unrelated to the subsequent, official .biz gTLD created by the ICANN)
* .corp
* .eur (European name services, by NetName)
* .fam
* .fcn (Free Community Network - no cost DNS for charities &amp; non-profits. Inactive.)
* .free
* .sex
* .usa (designed as a competitor to the official .us)
* .wtv (World Tele Virtual Network commercial Internet TV. Inactive.)
* .xxx (unrelated to the .xxx that was first approved, then revoked by the ICANN, and then approved again)

During the experimental phase, domains could be registered without fees using the .exp and .lnx TLDs. Some TLDs such as .ltd, .med or .xxx were operated directly by AlterNIC. The setup fee for AlterNIC registries was $50. The annual fee was $24, half of the $50 that were charged yearly by NSI for a .com or .net domain ($15 of the $50 were retained for a US Government fund).

A notable feature of AlterNIC was the possibility to request a new custom TLD for the same price as for registrations in existing TLDs. Established publishing groups had requested their own names: Wired magazine had reserved .wired and IDG&#x27;s affiliate in Europe has reserved .idg

== Controversy ==
A part of the Internet community has praised the initiative, with some recent scholarship proposing that alternative DNS roots may allow for a more democratic network control structure. Yet many others considered it harmful to the Internet. Using an alternative DNS root breaks the principle of universal resolvability, unless it is for a strictly private purpose. From a DNS perspective, it prevents some parts of the Internet from reaching other parts. Jon Postel, a significant contributor to Internet standards, asserted that it would lead to chaos. In May 2000, the Internet Architecture Board spoke out strongly against alternative roots in RFC 2826.

== Hijacking of InterNIC&#x27;s website ==
On July 11, 1997, against the advice of his AlterNIC colleagues, Kashpureff hijacked the InterNIC website, redirecting affected visitors to the AlterNIC website instead, where they could read about the AlterNIC protest or click a link to the InterNIC page. Kashpureff stopped the hijacking three days later on July 14, but started it again on July 18. This led NSI, the operator of the InterNIC website, to file a lawsuit against Kashpureff.

The civil lawsuit was quickly settled, but NSI had also contacted the FBI to investigate whether Kashpureff had broken federal computer crime laws. On October 31, he was arrested in Toronto on U.S. charges related to wire fraud and faced extradition to the United States. After fighting extradition for two months, he waived his rights, and was extradited to New York City. He was released on December 24, given a $100 fine and sentenced to two years probation.

The hijacking was made possible using a DNS cache poisoning attack, exploiting a security vulnerability in versions of BIND earlier than 4.9.6.

<text>The University of South Carolina Upstate (USC Upstate) is a public university in Valley Falls, South Carolina, with a Spartanburg postal address. Founded in 1967 and formerly known as University of South Carolina Spartanburg, the institution changed its name in the summer of 2004. It offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees for students in the Upstate and surrounding areas. It is part of the University of South Carolina System and home to approximately 5,200 students and 340 full-time faculty. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

==History==
After the Spartanburg General Hospital decided to discontinue its degree program for nurses, local politicians, led by G.B. Hodge, decided to create a separate university for the region. In 1967 the Spartanburg Regional Campus was opened as a two-year college with an initial enrollment of 177 students. Because of increased popularity, the school became a four-year institution in 1975 and was renamed as the University of South Carolina Spartanburg. During the following years, both the campus and the scope of the University expanded. 

In the summer of 2004 USC&#x27;s board of trustees voted to change the name to the University of South Carolina Upstate to better reflect its mission to educate the people of South Carolina&#x27;s upstate region. It has become the largest educational provider in the University Center Greenville, a consortium of seven institutions of higher learning in Greenville, South Carolina and the immediate surrounding area.

<doc id="837362" wikidata="Q164845" url="?curid=837362" title="Coat of arms of Estonia">
<text>The coat of arms of the Republic of Estonia () is a golden shield which includes a picture of three left-facing blue lions with red tongues in the middle, with golden oak branches placed on both sides of the shield. The coat of armes was derived from the 13th century royal coat of arms of Denmark, as the Duchy of Estonia (1219–1346) in what now northern Estonia was part of Denmark at the time.

==Description==
The coat of arms depicts a golden shield, which includes three slim blue &quot;lions passant gardant&quot; with red tongues in the middle and golden oak branches along both sides of the shield. The lesser coat of arms lacks these oak branches. The three lions on the national symbol of Estonia originate from the arms of King Valdemar II of Denmark who conquered northern Estonia in 1219. The lions became part of the greater coat of arms of Tallinn (Reval), the centre of Danish government in Estonia, and the fiefdoms (German: &quot;Ritterschaften&quot;) of Harria and Viru.

In 1346, the king of Denmark sold his Estonian dominion to the State of the Teutonic Order. The three lions, however, remained the central element of the greater coat of arms of Tallinn. In later centuries, the motif of the three lions transferred to the coats of arms of the Duchy of Estonia, the Estonian Knighthood, the Governorate of Estonia, and incorporated into the greater coat of arms of the Russian Empire. The &quot;Riigikogu&quot; (parliament) of the newly independent Republic of Estonia adopted the law which confirmed it as the national coat of arms on 19 June 1925.

During World War II, following the Soviet invasion and occupation of Estonia in June 1940, the display of the coat of arms, as well as of any other national symbols of Estonia, was banned by the new Stalinist regime. The symbols were replaced with Soviet-inspired emblems. The Soviet authorities persecuted anyone using the coat of arms or the national colours of Estonia. After World War II the coat of arms remained in use in the Western Bloc countries by a number of surviving diplomatic representatives of the Republic of Estonia, by the Estonian government-in-exile and by the large Estonian diaspora.

The coat of arms along with other national symbols were readopted on 7 August 1990, this marked one of the high points in the struggle for the restoration of the independent Estonian state which was eventually achieved on 20 August 1991. The use of the coat of arms is regulated by the &quot;Law on State Coat of Arms&quot;, passed on 6 April 1993.

<text>Juan Esteban Montero Rodríguez (February 12, 1879 – February 25, 1948) was a Chilean political figure. He served twice as president of Chile between 1931 and 1932.

==Early life==
He was born in Santiago, the son of Benjamín Montero and of Eugenia Rodríguez. Juan Esteban Montero studied at the &quot;colegio de San Ignacio&quot; and at the Universidad de Chile. He graduated as a lawyer on September 16, 1901, and soon after became professor of civil and Roman law at his &quot;alma mater&quot;. He also worked as a government lawyer and in private practice. He married Graciela Fehrman Martínez, with whom he had four children: Juan Esteban, Pedro, Benjamín and Carmen.

==Presidency==

Montero&#x27;s first incursion in politics was in 1931, when President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo named him Minister of the Interior and Social Welfare. After the resignation of president Ibáñez on July 26, 1931, he reluctantly agreed to serve in similar position to Ibáñez&#x27;s successor, Pedro Opazo; just to find himself promoted to president the very next day, after Opazo&#x27;s resignation. Montero, as a way out of the political impasse, immediately called for presidential elections. In the meanwhile he assumed as vice president.

Very soon after, Montero accepted the presidential nomination of the Radical Party, and in order to qualify, he resigned his vicepresidency on August 20, 1931. The position was assumed by Manuel Trucco. The Trucco administration was only supposed to be a caretaker one, keeping order in the country until the presidential elections. Nonetheless, it was faced with very difficult moments such as the Sailors&#x27; mutiny in the navy, caused by the reduction of the salaries of the enlisted men (September 1–5, 1931), which was controlled only after an aerial bombing of the fleet and presaged difficult times ahead.

Supported by the Liberals and Conservatives as well as the Radicals, Juan Esteban Montero was the clear winner of the presidential elections, obtaining almost 64% of the popular vote, defeating leftist José Santos Salas, a protégé of former President Carlos Ibáñez. He took over on November 15, in the midst of a political and economic chaos that resulted from the market crash of 1929. His program called for the implementation of an austerity program that involved the reduction of public expenditures and public salaries, a downsizing of the public administration and an increase of the foreign debt. Notwithstanding these harsh measures, the depreciation of the currency continued, and inflation soared while the Central Bank reserves were at an all-time low. This economic program only managed to cause widespread discontent, while in no way improving the economy, and in turn led to his downfall.

On June 4, 1932, colonel Marmaduke Grove staged a coup d&#x27;état by taking over the Air Force base of El Bosque, in Santiago, and demanding the resignation of President Montero. Montero refused to call on the army to put down the coup, and instead chose to resign. That same night, the victorious revolutionaries organized a Government Junta composed of retired General Arturo Puga, Eugenio Matte and Carlos Dávila, with colonel Grove as their minister of Defense. After this episode, Montero retired completely from politics, and went back to private practice and business. He died in Santiago, on February 25, 1948, at the age of 69.

Montes was born on 5 October 1861, in the city of La Paz, Bolivia. He belonged to a wealthy land-owning family. Montes was the son of General Clodomiro Montes and Tomasa Gamboa.

In 1878, he continued his higher studies by entering the Faculty of Law of the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés (UMSA), but due to the occupation by the Chilean army of the Bolivian town of Antofagasta on 14 February 1879, Montes decided to leave his studies and enlist as a private in the &quot;Murillo&quot; Regiment, then belonging to the &quot;Bolivian Legion&quot;. In 1880, Montes&#x27; regiment was ordered to participate in the Battle of Alto de la Alianza, the last great battle between Bolivia and Chile in the War of the Pacific, in which he participated and barely survived, finishing the battle seriously wounded. Incidentally, he was captured by the Chilean army and remained as a prisoner for the remainder of the war.

Upon his return to Bolivia, due to his heroism during the battle, Montes was directly promoted to the rank of captain by the government. Once Bolivia&#x27;s participation in the war came to an end in 1880, Montes began working as an instructor in the Bolivian army. However, in 1884, Montes decided to retire from the army to continue with his law studies at the UMSA, which he had left at the beginning of the war. He graduated with a law degree on 12 June 1886.

== Political career ==
In 1890, at the age of twenty-nine, Montes was elected as a Deputy representing the Liberal Party (Bolivia), however, his ideology collided with the prevailing conservatism of the time. Montes was elected as the head of Civil Law at the faculty of law in the UMSA.

As a deputy, Montes was known for his elegant and eloquent personality, making him a perfect partner to the vociferous and mercurial Atanasio de Urioste Velasco, another staunch liberal of the time. The two remained friends and allies until the end of their lives.

=== The Civil War of 1898–1899 ===

==== Prelude and the &quot;Radicatory Law&quot; ====

Conservative President Severo Fernández wanted to settle the decade-long debate regarding what city was officially the Bolivian capital. Up until 1880, the seat of executive power was wherever the current president resided. Hence, Congress met, between 1825 and 1900, on twenty-nine occasions in Sucre, twenty in La Paz, seven in Oruro, two in Cochabamba and one in Tapacarí. Officially, the capital of Bolivia was Sucre since the presidency of Antonio José de Sucre, remaining as such over the years due to the lack of resources to build a new capital and the influence of its aristocracy. However, by the 1880s, conservative presidents chose to settle in Sucre, making it the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the country.

On 31 October 1898, the deputies of Sucre proposed to definitively install the executive capital in Sucre, known as the &quot;Radicatory Law&quot;. However, their La Paz counterparts proposed that the Congress should move to Cochabamba (a neutral place), a proposition which was rejected. The liberals seemed to initially accept the plan to make Sucre the official capital. The liberals had done so strategically since if they had vetoed it they would have provoked the inhabitants of the capital, and they knew that if it was approved they could convince the people and the garrison of La Paz (under the orders of Colonel José Manuel Pando) to mount an insurrection. On 6 November there was a massive riot in La Paz: rioters demanded federalism and that their city be made the capital. On 14 November, a Federal Committee was created and chaired by Colonel Pando while its deputies defended their cause in Congress. Three days later, the &quot;Radicatory Law&quot; was approved, making Sucre the official capital and seat of executive power. On 19 November, the new status of the city was officially promulgated.

In response, on 12 December, with the people of La Paz behind them, a Federal Board of Liberals was formed, which included some authority figures who had switched sides (these being the Prefect and Commander General Serapio Reyes Ortiz and the Minister of Instruction Macario Pinilla). Pando&#x27;s liberals allied themselves with Pablo Zárate Willka, cacique (or &#x27;chief&#x27;) of the &quot;Altiplano&quot;.

==== Outbreak of war ====
After these events, the deputies from La Paz withdrew by order of the Federal Board. The people of La Paz received their representatives with great fanfare and ceremony. One of the federalists&#x27; main objectives then became the overthrow of Fernández. In Sucre, La Paz&#x27;s pro-Fernández counterpart, there were public demonstrations in support of the government.

Fernández decided to march on La Paz with the three divisions stationed in Sucre (Bolívar, Junín and Hussars). In Challapata, he found out that the rebels had acquired more than two thousand weapons, so he called for the recruitment of volunteers in the capital. Two brigades were formed: the first was made up of the &quot;25 de Mayo&quot; battalion and the &quot;Sucre&quot; squadron. These were made up of upper-class youths with their own horses and weapons, and included the Olañeta battalion and the Monteagudo squadron, made up of young men from popular classes. During their march to reinforce the president, the government&#x27;s forces plundered the indigenous populations that lived in the countryside.

The government&#x27;s first brigade encountered Pando and some of his soldiers in Cosmini, and, after being forced to take refuge in the parish of Ayo Ayo, they were massacred on 24 January 1899. In Potosí the population was openly against helping government forces, meanwhile in Santa Cruz and Tarija the populations took a neutral stance. Among the indigenous communities of Cochabamba, Oruro, La Paz, and Potosí there were uprisings in favor of the Liberals.

The decisive battle of the civil war was the battle of the Segundo Crucero, on 10 April 1899, where the president and Pando met. After four hours of combat, Pando&#x27;s troops emerged victorious. The defeated withdrew to Oruro and, shortly after, Fernández went into exile. During the entire duration of the conflict, Montes remained a loyal partisan to the liberal cause and fought under Pando&#x27;s command.
=== After the civil war ===
Montes attended the Assembly of Oruro, a meeting convened to discuss the future of the country. Once Pando was elected president, Montes was appointed Minister of War of Bolivia and was promoted to colonel. During his time as minister, Montes was concerned with improving the army, subjecting it to greater discipline and equipping it with modern material. Montes also led a military expedition to fight in the north of the country against Brazilian filibusters in the so-called Acre War (1900–1903). After the war, he devoted himself fully to politics, intending to replace José Manuel Pando when his term ended.

In 1904, his party chose him as a candidate for the presidency in the general elections that were to be held that same year. His opponent, Lucio Pérez Velasco, was defeated after a hard-fought election.

== President of Bolivia ==

=== First term ===
On 20 October 1904, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship with Chile was signed, which put an end to the state of war between the two countries, not ended since the War of the Pacific because only a truce had been signed in 1884. In the treaty, Montes recognized the absolute and perpetual cession of the Bolivian coast occupied by Chile.

According to Bolivian historiography of the mid-20th century onwards, this treaty was the result of the harassing pressure exerted by Chile on Bolivia (motivated by the expropriation of Chilean and foreign capital that triggered the War of the Pacific), with customs controls and trade restrictions. The liberal governments of Pando and Montes believed that it was time to turn the page with Chile and were convinced that the development of the railways and free transit, stipulated in the treaty, were compensations that were worth the sacrifice. In 1902, Chile had signed a treaty with Argentina that ended their militaristic rivalry with Buenos Aires, reducing its military personnel, creating a compulsory military service law and reducing the number of naval units, meaning that Chile could hardly aspire to exert military pressure on the Montes government.

Montes also signed a trade and customs treaty with Peru in 1905. A staunch liberal, Montes established civil marriage, freedom of worship and the abolition of ecclesiastical jurisdiction as fundamental liberties and rights in the Bolivian Constitution. This caused a rupture between the Holy See and the Bolivian government, prompting Pope Pius X to issue the apostolic letter &quot;Afflictum propioribus&quot; in November 1906. He also modernized the Bolivian Army, managing to bring a French military mission from Europe.

During the general elections of 1908, the government promoted the candidacy of the politician Fernando Eloy Guachalla for President and Eufronio Viscarra for Vice President, a formula that was successful. However, Guachalla fell ill and died shortly before assuming the presidency.

Under the influence of Montes, the liberal majority in Congress denied Vice President Viscarra the right of succession, with Atanasio de Urioste Velasco alleging that the incumbent&#x27;s death had occurred before he took office, which allowed Montes to be granted a year-long extension to his current term. During the general elections of 1909, the liberal candidate Eliodoro Villazón Montaño, from the Liberal Party, was victorious.

=== Second term ===
In 1913, Montes returned to Bolivia from Europe to run again for the presidency of the republic. He won the general elections of 1913 by a wide margin, returning to the presidency for the second nonconsecutive time. Perhaps one of Montes&#x27; most important acts as president was the foundation of the Central Bank of the Bolivia, which would be crucial in centralizing the national ecnonomy.

During his second term, the dissidence of Liberal Party members increased. Eventually, several liberals defected to Pando&#x27;s newly founded Republican Party, which the former president had founded in 1914. As the end of his constitutional period approached, Montes promoted the candidacy of the liberal José Gutiérrez Guerra, a childhood friend of his most loyal ally, Atanasio de Urioste. Gutiérrez was triumphant, thus maintaining the hegemony of the Liberal Party.

At the end of his government, Montes became the Bolivian ambassador to France. In 1920, he was still in the city of Paris, when the liberals were ousted from power by the republicans in Bolivia, which forced Montes to remain in France as an exile until 1928, the year in which he returned to assume the leadership of the Liberal Party yet again.

He was President of Central Bank of Bolivia from 1931 to 1933.

==The Chaco War and its final years==
Throughout his life, Montes had an illustrious military career which began at an early age, initially participating in the War of the Pacific in 1879, then in the Civil War of 1898–1899, and finally in the War of Acre of 1900–1903. These international as well as internal conflicts had given him valuable experiences in acquiring military prestige at the national level for more than fifty years. It is for this reason that during the Chaco War (1932–1935), President Daniel Salamanca decided to commission him as military advisor to the Bolivian army in the Chaco.

Montes was unable to witness the outcome nor the conclusion of the war. While he was still serving as military advisor, due to his advanced age, he suddenly died on 16 October 1933, in the city of La Paz.

<text>Francisco Labastida Ochoa (; born 14 August 1942) is a Mexican economist and politician affiliated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who became the first presidential candidate of his party to lose a presidential election, which he did in the 2000 presidential election to Vicente Fox.

Labastida was born to Gloria Ochoa de Labastida and Eduardo Labastida Kofahl. His wife, Teresa Uriarte, was director of UNAM&#x27;s Institute of Aesthetics Research. His great-grandfather fought on the side of Mexican President Benito Juárez in the War of Reform, and his grandfather was Governor of Sinaloa as well as federal deputy.

Labastida served as governor of Sinaloa (1987–1992), defeating Manuel Clouthier of the National Action Party. During and after his tenure as governor, Labastida was accused of protecting Sinaloan drug traffickers and overlooking their activities.

Labastida was Secretary of Energy during the administration of Miguel de la Madrid. He was also Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of the Interior during the administration of Ernesto Zedillo.

After losing the 2000 presidential election, he served as president of the Centro de Estudios para el Desarrollo de México. In the 2006 general election, he was elected to the Senate for the PRI, representing Sinaloa.

<text>Giulio Monteverde (8 October 1837 – 3 October 1917) was an Italian naturalist sculptor and teacher.

==Biography==
Monteverde was born in Bistagno, Italy and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome. He later became a professor there. Among his students were Yulia Brazol, Lola Mora and Victor de Pol, who both developed significant public work in Buenos Aires.

He was made an Officer in the Legion d&#x27;Honneur in 1878 and an Italian Senator in 1889. He died in Rome in 1917, five days shy of his 80th birthday.

There are three of the Resurrection Angel in the New York City area, and three of the &quot;Angel of the Night&quot; in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Monteverde also created a &quot;Resurrection Angel&quot; for his own family tomb in Verano Cemetery in Rome.

<text>Dom Bernard de Montfaucon, O.S.B. (; 13 January 1655 – 21 December 1741) was a French Benedictine monk of the Congregation of Saint Maur. He was an astute scholar who founded the discipline of palaeography, as well as being an editor of works of the Fathers of the Church. He is regarded as one of the founders of the modern discipline of archaeology.

==Early life==

Montfaucon was born on 13 January 1655 in the Castle of Soulatgé, a small village in the Corbières Massif, then in the ancient Province of Languedoc, now in the modern Department of Aude. Other sources claimed his birth date is in 16 January, the most accepted date. After one year he was moved to the Castle of Roquetaillade, residence of his family. When he was seven, he was sent to Limoux, to the college run by the Fathers of Christian Doctrine.

==Career==
Montfaucon served in the French army as a volunteer and participated in the Franco-Dutch War of 1673. He was a captain of grenadiers and made two campaigns under the command of Marshall Turenne, participated in the Battle of Herbsthausen and fell ill in Saverne in Alsace. Because of his infectious illness he made a vow to Our Lady of Marceille to give one hundred &quot;livres&quot; to her sanctuary in Limoux and to become a monk, if he was able to return to his country as a result of her intervention.

After the death of Montfaucon&#x27;s father at the Château de Roquetaillade, in 1675 he entered the novitiate of the Benedictine monastery of Bream in Toulouse. There he learned several ancient languages: Greek, Hebrew, Chaldean, Syriac, and Coptic.

In 1687 Montfaucon was called to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés and he started to work on an edition of the works of the Greek Church Fathers.

In 1705 Montfaucon examined and described the manuscripts of the Fonds Coislin, in &quot;Bibliotheca Coisliniana&quot; (Paris, 1705). In 1708 in &quot;Palaeographia Graeca&quot; Montfaucon became the first to use the term &quot;palaeography&quot;. The work illustrates the entire history of Greek writing. It contains Montfaucon&#x27;s discussions of variations in Greek letter forms, the use of abbreviations in Greek manuscripts, and the process of deciphering archaic writing. It was Montfaucon&#x27;s special interest. In this work he often cited Greek manuscripts in texts of Athanasius of Alexandria, Origen, and John Chrysostom. The book dealt so comprehensively with the handwriting and other characteristics of Greek manuscripts that it remained the leading authority on the subject for almost two centuries.

Montfaucon published 15 volumes of &quot;L&#x27;antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures&quot; between 1719 and 1724. An English translation of this work was published in 1721–25 under the title &quot;Antiquity Explained and Represented in Sculptures&quot;. The work contained copperplate folio engravings of classical antiquities. It included a depiction of the &quot;Barberini Vase&quot;, more commonly known as the &quot;Portland Vase&quot;. This book is published in English under the title &quot;Antiquities&quot;. The materials used in this work were taken from the manuscripts deposited in French libraries. It contains many illustrative facsimiles, though they are engraved in a rather coarse way.

In 1719, Montfaucon was nominated by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. In 1719, following the death of the Jesuit priest, Michel Le Tellier (1643–1719), confessor to the late King Louis XIV, Montfaucon became confessor to the young King Louis XV.

Montfaucon died on 21 December 1741 at the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where he was buried.

==Legacy==
In a letter of 24 June 1786, Josiah Wedgwood explains that he had seen Montfaucon&#x27;s engravings of the Portland Vase.

Montfaucon was the original editor of the homilies &quot;Adversus Judaeos&quot; by saint John Chrysostom along with many other works of the Fathers of the Church.

Montfaucon laid the foundation for the study of Greek manuscripts. Scrivener stated that his work still maintains a high authority, even &quot;after more recent discoveries&quot;, especially of papyri in Egypt. Modern scholars agree that he effectively created a new discipline, palaeography, and brought it to an advanced state of sophistication.

Montfaucon was largely responsible for bringing the Bayeux Tapestry to public attention. In 1724, the scholar Antoine Lancelot discovered drawings of a section of the tapestry (about 30 feet of the Tapestry&#x27;s 231 feet) among papers of Nicolas-Joseph Foucault, a Norman administrator. (These drawings of the tapestry&#x27;s images &quot;classicized&quot; the somewhat crude Anglo-Norman originals by adding shadows and dimensionality to the figures.) Lancelot, unsure of what medium the drawings depicted, suggested that they might be a tomb relief, stained glass, a fresco, or even a tapestry. When Lancelot presented Foucault&#x27;s drawings in 1724 to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in Paris, they attracted the attention of Montfaucon, who subsequently tracked down the textile in the drawings with help from his Benedictine colleagues in Normandy. This is often regarded as the modern &quot;discovery&quot; of the Bayeux Tapestry, which had been displayed annually in Bayeux Cathedral, perhaps for centuries, without attracting outside attention. Montfaucon published the Foucault drawings in the first volume his &quot;Les Monumens de la Monarchie Françoise&quot;. In anticipation of volume 2 of &quot;Les Monumens&quot;, Montfaucon engaged the artist Antoine Benoit, and sent him to Bayeux to copy the Tapestry in its entirety and in a manner more faithful to its style. Emory University art history professor Elizabeth Carson Pastan criticizes Montfaucon for his &quot;Norman Triumphalist&quot; point of view in dealing with the story of the Tapestry, despite the fact that he asserted that one should trust &quot;the best historians of Normandy&quot;. She does state, however, that modern scholars are indebted to him for his process of examining many accounts of the Norman Conquest in interpreting the Tapestry, and his highlighting of the Tapestry&#x27;s ambiguity and enigma (such as why Harold Godwinson went to Normandy in 1064 and the identity of the elusive Aelfgyva).

<text>Rodolfo Biagi (March 14, 1906, in Buenos Aires – September 24, 1969) was an Argentine Tango musician who started his musical career by playing background pianist for silent movies, and this was where he was first discovered by a tango band leader.

As a tango pianist, he played with several orchestras, including the orchestra of Juan d&#x27;Arienzo from 1935 to 1938, and is often partly credited with the development of d&#x27;Arienzo&#x27;s rhythmic style. He later formed his own orchestra, and the special rhythmic qualities of his music are easily recognisable.

<doc id="837424" wikidata="Q1397542" url="?curid=837424" title="Gondophares">
<text>Gondophares I (Greek: Γονδοφαρης &quot;Gondopharēs&quot;, Υνδοφερρης &quot;Hyndopherrēs&quot;; Kharosthi: 𐨒𐨂𐨡𐨥𐨪 &#x27;,&#x27;; 𐨒𐨂𐨡𐨥𐨪𐨿𐨣 &#x27;,&#x27;; 𐨒𐨂𐨡𐨂𐨵𐨪 &#x27;,&#x27;) was the founder of the Indo-Parthian Kingdom and its most prominent king, ruling from 19 to 46. He probably belonged to a line of local princes who had governed the Parthian province of Drangiana since its disruption by the Indo-Scythians in c. 129 BC, and may have been a member of the House of Suren. During his reign, his kingdom became independent from Parthian authority and was transformed into an empire, which encompassed Drangiana, Arachosia, and Gandhara. He is generally known from the Acts of Thomas, the Takht-i-Bahi inscription, and silver and copper coins bearing his visage.

He was succeeded in Drangiana and Arachosia by Orthagnes, and in Gandhara by his nephew Abdagases I.

== Etymology ==
The name of Gondophares was not a personal name, but an epithet derived from the Middle Iranian name 𐭅𐭉𐭍𐭃𐭐𐭓𐭍, &quot;Windafarn&quot; (Parthian), and 𐭢𐭥𐭭𐭣𐭯𐭥, &quot;Gundapar&quot; (Middle Persian), in turn derived from the Old Iranian name 𐎻𐎡𐎭𐎳𐎼𐎴𐎠 (&quot;Vindafarnâ&quot;, &quot;May he find glory&quot; (cf. Greek , &quot;Intaphernes&quot;)), which was also the name of one of the six nobles that helped the Achaemenid king of kings (&quot;shahanshah&quot;) Darius the Great () to seize the throne. In old Armenian, it is &quot;Gastaphar&quot;. &quot;Gundaparnah&quot; was apparently the Eastern Iranian form of the name.

Ernst Herzfeld claims his name is perpetuated in the name of the Afghan city Kandahar, which he founded under the name Gundopharron.

According to a historical perspective to the Persian literature, Gondophares is identical with Fariborz of Iranian national narratives. The name of &quot;Fariborz&quot; (فریبرز) was written by Abu Ali Bal&#x27;ami and Al-Tabari as &quot;Borzāfrah&quot; (بُرزافره) and Ibn Balkhi as &quot;Zarāfah&quot; (زَرافَه). The author of Mojmal al-Tawarikh wrote the name as &quot;Borzfari&quot; (بُرزفَری) and stated that Ferdowsi changed it to &quot;Fariborz&quot; to keep the rhythmic structure of meter.

== Background ==

Gondophares may have been a member of the House of Suren, one of the most esteemed families in Arsacid Iran, that not only had the hereditary right to lead the royal military, but also to place the crown on the Parthian king at the coronation. In c. 129 BC, the eastern portions of the Parthian Empire, primarily Drangiana, was invaded by nomadic peoples, mainly by the Eastern Iranian Saka (Indo-Scythians) and the (likely also Indo-European, but of disputed affiliation) Yuezhi, thus giving the rise to the name of the province of Sakastan (&quot;land of the Saka&quot;).

The ruler of the Parthian Empire ruler Mithridates II (124–88 BCE) vanquished the Sakas of the region of Sakastan, and established &quot;Satraps&quot; in the region, one of them probably being Tanlis Mardates. These Parthian satraps ruled over Sakastan until the establishment of the dynasty of Gondophares (19-46 CE).

As a result of these invasions, the Suren family was may have been given control of Sakastan in order to defend the empire from further nomad incursions; the Surenids not only may have managed to repel the Indo-Scythians, but also to invade and seize their lands in Arachosia and Punjab, thus resulting in the establishment of the Indo-Parthian Kingdom.

==Rule==

Gondophares ascended the throne in c. 19 or c. 20, and quickly declared independence from the Parthian Empire, minting coins in Drangiana where he assumed the Greek title of &quot;autokrator&quot; (&quot;one who rules by himself&quot;).

Gondophares I has traditionally been given a later date; the reign of one king calling himself Gondophares has been established at 20 AD by the rock inscription he set up at Takht-i-Bahi near Mardan, Pakistan, in 46 AD., and he has also been connected with the third-century &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot;.

Gondophares I took over the Kabul valley and the Punjab and Sindh region area from the Scythian king Azes. In reality, a number of vassal rulers seem to have switched allegiance from the Indo-Scythians to Gondophares I. His empire was vast, but was only a loose framework, which fragmented soon after his death. His capital was the Gandharan city of Taxila. Taxila is located in Punjab to the west of the present Islamabad.

==Chronology==
On the coins of Gondophares, the royal names are Iranian, but the other legends of the coins are in Greek and Kharoṣṭhī.

Ernst Herzfeld maintained that the dynasty of Gondophares represented the House of Suren.

==The Biblical Magus &quot;Gaspar&quot;==
The name of Gondophares was translated in Armenian in &quot;Gastaphar&quot;, and then in Western languages into &quot;Gasbar[d], Gaspas, Caspus, Kaspar, גִזבָּר &quot;. He may be the &quot;Gasbar[d], Treasurer and King of Persia&quot;, who, according to apocryphal texts and eastern Christian tradition, was one of the three Biblical Magi who attended the birth of Christ. Through this interaction and association, Gaspar[d] was adopted by the Europeans (and in Western tradition) as a male first name.

==Connection with Saint Thomas and Apollonius of Tyana==

The apocryphical &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot; mentions one king &quot;Gudnaphar&quot;. This king has been associated with Gondophares I by scholars such as M. Reinaud, as it was not yet established that there were several kings with the same name. Since St. Thomas is said to have lived there in a specific time frame, this is often used to provide more specific chronology to an otherwise historiographically lacking time frame. Richard N. Frye, Emeritus Professor of Iranian Studies at Harvard University, has noted that this ruler has been identified with a king called Caspar in the Christian tradition of the Apostle St Thomas and his visit to India. Recent numismatic research by R.C. Senior supports the notion that the king who best fits these references was Gondophares-Sases, the fourth king using the title Gondophares.

A. D. H. Bivar, writing in &quot;The Cambridge History of Iran&quot;, said that the reign dates of one Gondophares recorded in the Takht-i Bahi inscription (20–46 or later AD) are consistent with the dates given in the &quot;Apocryphal Acts of Thomas&quot; for the Apostle&#x27;s voyage to India following the Crucifixion in c. 30 AD. B. N. Puri, of the Department of Ancient Indian History and Archaeology, University of Lucknow, India, also identified Gondophares with the ruler said to have been converted by Saint Thomas the Apostle. The same goes for the reference to an Indo-Parthian king in the accounts of the life of Apollonius of Tyana. Puri says that the dates given by Philostratus in his &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot; for Apollonius&#x27; visit to Taxila, 43–44 AD, are within the period of the reign of Gondophares I, who also went by the Parthian name, Phraotes.
Saint Thomas was brought before King Gundaphar (Gondophares) at his capital, Taxila. &quot;Taxila&quot; is the Greek form of the contemporary Pali name for the city, &quot;Takkasila&quot;, from the Sanskrit &quot;Taksha-sila&quot;. The name of the city was transformed in subsequent legends concerning Thomas, which were consolidated into the &quot;Historia Trium Regum (History of the Three Kings)&quot; by John of Hildesheim (1364–1375), into &quot;Silla&quot;, &quot;Egrisilla&quot;, &quot;Grisculla&quot;, and so on, the name having undergone a process of metamorphosis similar to that which transformed &quot;Vindapharnah&quot; (Gondophares) to &quot;Caspar&quot;. 
Hildesheim&#x27;s &quot;Historia Trium Regum&quot; says: &quot;In the third India is the kingdom of Tharsis, which at that time was ruled over by King Caspar, who offered incense to our Lord. The famous island Eyrisoulla [or Egrocilla] lies in this land: it is there that the holy apostle St Thomas is buried&quot;. &quot;Egrisilla&quot; appears on the globe made in Nuremberg by Martin Behaim in 1492, where it appears on the southernmost part of the peninsula of Hoch India, &quot;High India&quot; or &quot;India Superior&quot;, on the eastern side of the Sinus Magnus (&quot;Great Gulf&quot;, the Gulf of Thailand): there Egrisilla is identified with the inscription, &quot;das lant wird genant egtisilla,&quot; (&quot;the land called Egrisilla&quot;). In his study of Behaim&#x27;s globe, E. G. Ravenstein noted: &quot;Egtisilla, or Eyrisculla [or Egrisilla: the letters &quot;r&quot; and &quot;t&quot; in the script on the globe look similar], is referred to in John of Hildesheim&#x27;s version of the ‘Three Kings’ as an island where St. Thomas lies buried&quot;.

<doc id="837456" wikidata="Q3269483" url="?curid=837456" title="James Montgomery (poet)">
<text>James Montgomery (4 November 1771 – 30 April 1854) was a Scottish-born hymn writer, poet and editor, who eventually settled in Sheffield. He was raised in the Moravian Church and theologically trained there, so that his writings often reflect concern for humanitarian causes, such as the abolition of slavery and the exploitation of child chimney sweeps.

==Early life and poetry==
Montgomery was born at Irvine in south-west Scotland, the son of a pastor and missionary of the Moravian Brethren. He was sent to be trained for the ministry at the Moravian School at Fulneck, near Leeds, while his parents left for the West Indies, where both died within a year of each other. At Fulneck, secular studies were banned, but James still found means of borrowing and reading a good deal of poetry and made ambitious plans to write epics of his own.

On failing to complete his schooling, Montgomery was apprenticed to a baker in Mirfield, then to a store-keeper at Wath-upon-Dearne. After further efforts, including an unsuccessful attempt at a literary career in London, he moved north again to Sheffield in 1792 as an assistant to Joseph Gales, auctioneer, bookseller and printer of the &quot;Sheffield Register&quot;, who introduced him into the local Lodge of Oddfellows, to which he later addressed a song. In 1794, Gales left England to avoid political prosecution and Montgomery took the paper in hand, changing its name to the &quot;Sheffield Iris&quot;.

These were times of political repression. Montgomery was twice imprisoned on charges of sedition, first in 1795 for printing a poem to celebrate the fall of the Bastille in revolutionary France, and secondly in 1796 for criticising a magistrate for forcibly dispersing a political protest in Sheffield. Turning his jail experiences to some profit, he then published a pamphlet of poems written during his captivity: &quot;Prison Amusements&quot; (1797). His later prose account of the period appeared in 1840.

For some time the &quot;Iris&quot; was the only newspaper in Sheffield, but beyond an ability to produce fairly creditable articles from week to week, Montgomery lacked the journalistic skills to take full advantage of his position. Other newspapers arose to fill the place which his might have held and in 1825 he sold out to a local bookseller, John Blackwell.

Meanwhile, Montgomery continued to write poetry. He achieved some fame with &quot;The Wanderer of Switzerland&quot; (1806), a poem in six parts written in seven-syllable cross-rhymed quatrains. It addressed the French annexation of Switzerland and quickly went through two editions. When it was denounced the following year in the conservative &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; as a poem that would be speedily forgotten, Lord Byron came to its defence in the satire &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot;. Nevertheless, within 18 months a fourth impression of 1500 copies was issued from the very presses that had printed the criticism, and several more would follow. This success brought Montgomery a commission from the printer Bowyer to write a poem on the abolition of the slave trade, to be published with other poems on the subject by Elizabeth Benger and James Grahame in a handsome illustrated volume. The subject appealed to the poet&#x27;s philanthropic enthusiasm and his own family associations with the West Indies. The four-part poem in heroic couplets appeared in 1809 as &quot;The West Indies&quot;.

Montgomery also used heroic couplets for &quot;The World before the Flood&quot; (1812), a piece of historical reconstruction in ten cantos. He then turned to attacking the lottery in &quot;Thoughts on Wheels&quot; (1817) and took up the cause of chimney sweeps&#x27; apprentices in &quot;The Climbing Boys&#x27; Soliloquies&quot;. His next major poem was &quot;Greenland&quot; (1819) in five cantos of heroic couplets. It was prefaced by a description of the ancient Moravian church, its 18th-century revival and its mission to Greenland in 1733. The poem was noted for the beauty of its descriptions:
==Later career==

Montgomery&#x27;s only other long poem, after retiring from newspaper editorship, was &quot;The Pelican Island&quot; (1828): nine cantos of descriptive blank verse, which garnered mixed responses, ranging between the summarily dismissive and &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;the best of all Montgomery&#x27;s poems: in idea the most original, in execution the most powerful.&quot;

Montgomery himself expected that his name would live, if at all, in his hymns. Some of these, such as &quot;Hail to the Lord&#x27;s Anointed&quot;, &quot;Prayer is the Soul&#x27;s Sincere Desire&quot;, &quot;Stand up and Bless the Lord&quot; and the carol &quot;Angels from the Realms of Glory&quot;, are still sung. &quot;The Lord Is My Shepherd&quot; is a popular hymn with many denominations, based on Psalm 23. &quot;A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief&quot; has been adopted as a favourite in the Latter Day Saint movement. The earliest of his hymns dates from his days in Wath on Dearne and he added to their number over the years. The main boost came when the Rev. James Cotterill arrived at the parish church St Paul&#x27;s, a chapel of ease to St Peter&#x27;s, Sheffield&#x27;s only parish church, in 1817.

Cotterill had compiled and published &quot;A Selection of Psalms and Hymns Adapted to the Services of the Church of England&quot; in 1810, but to his disappointment and concern he found that his new parishioners did not take kindly to using it. He therefore enlisted the help of James Montgomery to help him revise the collection and improve it by adding some hymns of the poet&#x27;s own composition. This new edition, meeting with the approval of the Archbishop of York (and eventually of the parishioners at St Paul&#x27;s), was finally published in 1820. In 1822 Montgomery published his own &quot;Songs of Zion: Being Imitations of Psalms&quot;, the first of several more collections of hymns. During his life he composed some 400 hymns, although less than a hundred of them are commonly sung today.

Montgomery later compiled and published the journals of Daniel Tyerman after his death during a missionary voyage with George Bennet. The account was originally published from London in a two-volume format in 1831, with the title &quot;Journal of voyages and travels by the Rev. Daniel Tyerman and George Bennet, Esq., deputed from the London Missionary Society to visit their various stations in the South Sea Islands, Australia, China, India, &amp;c [Madagascar, and South Africa] between the years 1821 and 1829&quot;,
 and a revised second edition followed in 1840. This also contained a short chapter on African slavery.

From 1835 until his death, Montgomery lived at The Mount in Glossop Road, Sheffield. He was well regarded in the city and played an active part in its philanthropy and religious life. He died on 30 April 1854, was honoured by a public funeral, and buried in Sheffield General Cemetery. He had remained unmarried.

==Legacy==
In 1861, a monument designed by John Bell (1811–1895) was erected over his grave in the Sheffield cemetery at a cost of £1000, raised by public subscription on the initiative of the Sheffield Sunday School Union, of which he was among the founding members. On its granite pedestal is inscribed: &quot;Here lies interred, beloved by all who knew him, the Christian poet, patriot, and philanthropist. Wherever poetry is read, or Christian hymns sung, in the English language, &#x27;he being dead, yet speaketh&#x27; by the genius, piety and taste embodied in his writings.&quot; There are also extracts from his poems &quot;Prayer&quot; and &quot;The Grave&quot;. After the statue fell into disrepair it was moved in 1971 to the precincts of Sheffield Cathedral, where there is also a memorial window to him.

Elsewhere in Sheffield there are various streets named after Montgomery, as is a Grade II-listed drinking fountain on Broad Lane. The Surrey Street meeting hall of the Sunday Schools Union (now known as The Montgomery) was named in his honour in 1886. It houses a 420-seat theatre, which also bears his name. Elsewhere, Wath-upon-Dearne, flattered by being called &quot;the queen of villages&quot; in his work, has repaid the compliment by naming after him a community hall, a street and a square. His birthplace in Irvine was renamed Montgomery House after he had paid the town a return visit in 1841, but it has since been demolished.

<text>Field Marshal Sir Archibald Armar Montgomery-Massingberd, (6 December 1871 – 13 October 1947), known as Archibald Armar Montgomery until October 1926, was a senior British Army officer who served as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) from 1933 to 1936. He served in the Second Boer War and in the First World War, and later was the driving force behind the formation of a permanent &quot;Mobile Division&quot;, the fore-runner of the 1st Armoured Division.

==Military career==
His father was Hugh de Fellenberg Montgomery, a landowner and Ulster Unionist politician, and his mother was Mary Sophia Juliana May Montgomery (née Maude). The young Montgomery was educated at Charterhouse and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and then was commissioned a second lieutenant into the Royal Field Artillery on 4 November 1891. He was posted to a field battery in India in 1892 and became a lieutenant on 4 November 1894. He served with the Royal Field Artillery during the Second Boer War and took part in the Battle of Magersfontein and the Battle of Paardeberg. Having been promoted to captain on 8 March 1900, he was mentioned in despatches on 4 September 1901. He stayed in South Africa throughout the war, which ended with the Peace of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902, and returned home on the which arrived at Southampton in late October 1902.

After the war, Montgomery served as a battery captain at Bulford Camp before attending Staff College, Camberley from 1905 to 1906. He became a staff captain at the Inspectorate of Horse and Field Artillery in 1907 and a staff officer at Aldershot Command in 1908. Promoted to major on 5 June 1909, he was appointed a general staff officer, grade 2 (GSO2) at the Indian Staff College at Quetta in India on 9 February 1912. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel as a result of his GSO2 appointment.

At the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914, Montgomery was promoted once more to temporary lieutenant colonel and appointed a general staff officer grade 2 (GSO2) of the 4th Division of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which landed in France in August. Towards the end of the following month the division was temporarily commanded by Major-General Henry Rawlinson, &quot;who formed a high opinion of Montgomery&#x27;s abilities and thereafter retained him in his personal entourage&quot;. He was promoted to GSO1 in September, taking over this position from Colonel James Edward Edmonds, but this was short lived as he was appointed chief of staff at IV Corps, commanded by Rawlinson, now a lieutenant-general, in October, and received the temporary rank of colonel on 4 November. Having been promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant colonel on 16 May 1915, and to temporary brigadier general on 19 August, he was promoted to temporary major-general in February 1916 became major-general, general staff (MGGS) of the newly created Fourth Army of the BEF in February 1916, with Rawlinson in command. It was a role for which, according to General Sir Douglas Haig, commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of the BEF from December 1915 onwards, from the planning for the Battle of the Somme in 1916 he carried out with &quot;great ability and success&quot;. Promoted to the substantive rank of major-general on 1 January 1917, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his services in the field on 1 January 1918. He was effectively deputy commander of the Fourth Army (deputising for Rawlinson) in the final months of the war and played an important role in the success of the Battle of Amiens. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George for his services in connection with military operations in France and Flanders on 1 January 1919 and was also awarded the American Distinguished Service Medal by the President of the United States on 12 July 1919. The medal&#x27;s citation reads:

Montgomery was appointed chief of staff of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) following the war and then Deputy Chief of the General Staff in India on 27 March 1920, before becoming GOC of the 53rd (Welsh) Division on 3 March 1922. He became GOC 1st Division, in succession to Major General Sir Guy Bainbridge, at Aldershot on 4 June 1923 and, having been advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1925 New Year Honours, he was promoted to lieutenant general on 16 March 1926. Following a two-year break on half-pay, he became GOC-in-C Southern Command on 17 June 1928. Promoted to full general on 1 October 1930, he was appointed Adjutant-General to the Forces on 1 March 1931 and made aide-de-camp general to the King on 3 March 1931.

Montgomery-Massingberd was appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) in February 1933. Among his main achievements at this time was the mechanising of the cavalry: indeed he was the driving force behind the formation of a permanent &quot;Mobile Division&quot;. Despite this, according to Williamson and Millett, he was a great obstacle to innovation of mechanized forces and suppressed the analysis of the British Army&#x27;s performance in the First World War initiated by his predecessor, Lord Milne. Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1934, he was made a field marshal on 7 June 1935. Following the death of King George V he took part in the funeral procession in January 1936 and then retired in March 1936.

Montgomery-Massingberd was also colonel commandant of the Royal Regiment of Artillery from 19 November 1927, Colonel Commandant of the Royal Tank Corps from 7 December 1934, Colonel Commandant of the 20th Burma Rifles from 5 April 1935, Honorary Colonel of the 46th (Lincolnshire Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers, from 17 March 1937 and Colonel Commandant of the Royal Malta Artillery from 11 May 1937.

In retirement Montgomery-Massingberd became deputy lieutenant and then vice-lieutenant of the County of Lincoln. During the Second World War the Air Ministry attempted to build an airfield at Great Steeping in Lincolnshire that would have extended into Sir Archibald&#x27;s wife&#x27;s traditional family estate, necessitating the demolition of the magnificent mansion of Gunby Hall. He personally appealed to King George VI and the Air Ministry relented, redrawing the plans that resulted in the resiting of the new RAF Spilsby two miles further south. During the Second World War he also took charge of organizing and recruiting the Home Guard in Lincolnshire for nine months. His major passion in life was horsemanship. He died at the age of 75 at his home, Gunby Hall, on 13 October 1947 and was buried at St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Gunby.

==Family==
In 1896 Archibald Montgomery married Diana Langton Massingberd. They had no children. In October 1926, his wife inherited Massingberd family estates, and he changed his name by Royal Licence to add her name to his own. Thus, references to him as &quot;Montgomery-Massingberd&quot; during the First World War are anachronistic. The journalist and genealogist Hugh Massingberd was a great-nephew of both the field marshal and, independently, the field marshal&#x27;s wife, and in 1963 he and his father also adopted the Massingberd name to inherit the same estates.

<text>Baron Nöel Frédéric Armand André de Lafresnaye (24 July 1783 – 14 July 1861) was a French ornithologist and collector.

Lafresnaye was born into an aristocratic family at Chateau de La Fresnaye in Falaise, Normandy. He took an early interest in natural history, particularly entomology. It was only after acquiring a collection of European birds that he turned his attention to ornithology.

Lafresnaye described a number of new bird species, some with Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny. He accumulated a collection of over 8,000 bird skins at his home. After his death the collection was purchased by the American collector Henry Bryant and donated to the Boston Natural History Society. It was transferred to the Museum of Comparative Zoology in 1914.

Lafresnaye&#x27;s piculet, Lafresnaye&#x27;s woodcreeper and Lafresnaye&#x27;s vanga are avian species that bear his name.

<text>Hoop cheese is a traditional cow&#x27;s milk cheese that was common in the Southern United States from the early to mid 1900s. It is still available today, although it is much less common. It is a simple cheese prepared by separating the whey from curds. Today, the American Dairy Association has no criteria in place to classify hoop cheese, although it has sometimes been referred to as a type of pot cheese. 

==Overview==
Hoop cheese is a simple, traditional fresh cow&#x27;s milk cheese, prepared by pressing curds until the whey is entirely pressed-out, leaving the final cheese product. This involves the use of a cheese hoop, a ring of wood used to press out and separate the whey from the completed cheese, typically with cheesecloth, whereby the whey drains out through the cloth and the hoop cheese remains atop. Using this preparation method, the cheese is typically pressed into rounds and then wrapped in cheesecloth or parchment paper or sealed in wax. Hoop cheese has been described as a &quot;truly low-fat&quot; product. It has a firm, but not hard, consistency, and has been described as being similar to farmer cheese and as having a creamy texture. In contemporary times, it is sometimes packaged with a coating of red wax.

Hoop cheese can be difficult to find commercially in some areas of the United States, due to the difficulty of automating the manufacturing process and because it has a short shelf life. It used to be a common cheese product in the Southern United States in the early to mid 1900s. Today, it can still be found at some roadside stands, small restaurants, grocers, farmers markets and independent gas stations in the Southern United States.

==Classification==
Today, the American Dairy Association has no criteria or standards in place to define what specifically constitutes hoop cheese. A 1915 Department Reports of the State of New York entry characterized hoop cheese as a type of pot cheese.

==History==

As an example of its commercial production, hoop cheese was mass-produced in the 1910s in Otsego County, New York and shipped along with farmer cheese to New York on the New York Central Railroad. During this time period hoop and farmer cheeses were packed in cans and boxes in 100-pound increments. Hoop cheese was also packed for commercial transport in this manner through the 1920s in New York state.

Hoop cheese was once so common that a device called a hoop cheese cutter was manufactured and used in general stores during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The hoop cheese cutter was patented in 1905 in the United States and resembled a turntable with a knife blade suspended above it. It was built by scale companies of the period to cut to order the exact amount of cheese a customer wanted.

==Similar foods==
Hoop cheese is different from farmer cheese in that farmer cheese is made with milk, cream, and salt, while hoop cheese is made from milk alone.

<doc id="837483" wikidata="Q723643" url="?curid=837483" title="Vincenzo Monti">
<text>Vincenzo Monti (19 February 1754 – 13 October 1828) was an Italian poet, playwright, translator, and scholar, the greatest interpreter of Italian neoclassicism in all of its various phases. His verse translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot; is considered one of the greatest of them all, with its iconic opening (&quot;Cantami, o Diva, del Pelide Achille l&#x27;ira funesta&quot;, lib. I, verses 1–2) becoming an extremely recognizable phrase among Italians (for example, being the text shown when opening a font file in Microsoft Windows).

==Biography==
Monti was born in Alfonsine, Province of Ravenna, Emilia-Romagna the son of Fedele and Domenica Maria Mazzari, landowners. He was educated at the seminar in Faenza and at the University of Ferrara, where he studied medicine and jurisprudence.

Monti derived from his classical education a taste for the elegance of Virgil and of the Arcadian poet Carlo Innocenzo Frugoni. In 1775 he was admitted to membership in the Academy of Arcadians, for which he took the pastoral name &#x27;Autonide Saturnino&#x27;. In the following year he composed the &quot;Visione d&#x27;Ezechiello&quot; (&quot;Ezekiel&#x27;s vision&quot;), a Dantesque Vision, in &quot;terza rima&quot;, written under the influence of Alfonso Varano, which he dedicated to Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the Papal Legate in Ferrara. The Cardinal was struck by Monti&#x27;s promise as a poet and invited him to Rome, where he settled in 1778.

In Rome, where he lived for some twenty years, until 1797, Monti composed odes and a variety of lengthier works. He served as secretary to Duke Luigi Braschi Onesti, enjoyed favour at the court of the enlightened and judicious Pope Pius VI, the uncle of his patron, and soon gained a leading position in Roman literary circles.

Soon after his arrival in Rome, two remarkable archaeological finds, the busts of Pericles and of Aspasia, unearthed at Tivoli and Civitavecchia respectively, provided the theme of &quot;La Prosopopea di Pericle&quot; (1779), Monti&#x27;s first Roman ode. This was followed by &quot;La bellezza dell&#x27;universo&quot; (1781) and the &quot;Ode al signor di Montgolfier&quot; (1784). In the former, which is in &quot;terza rima&quot;, the beauties of Nature from the time of the Creation are depicted, in a sequence of magnificent images; the latter was written to mark the first ascent of the brothers Charles and Robert Montgolfier in their hydrogen balloon, which took off in the Tuileries on 1 December 1783. The &quot;Ode al signor di Montgolfier&quot; is typically &#x27;Montian&#x27; in its spirit of eulogy and in its exaltation of scientific enterprise within the context of Greek myth.

The &quot;Ode al signor di Montgolfier&quot;, which was composed in the form of a &quot;canzonetta&quot; with lines of seven syllables arranged in four-line stanzas, was recited in Arcadia in 1784, the year of its composition. In the same year Monti began one of his most distinguished poems, &quot;La Feroniade&quot;, a mythological composition of Virgilian inspiration in which he extolled the plans of Pius VI for the drainage and reclamation of the Pontine Marshes. The poem is in three cantos in &quot;versi sciolti&quot;. But although Monti worked on it occasionally throughout his life, it was left incomplete at the time of his death.

An unhappy love-affair at this time provided inspiration for &quot;Al Principe Don Sigismondo Chigi&quot; and &quot;Pensieri d&#x27;amore&quot; (1783) – the latter, with its perhaps too faithful rendering of passages from Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;, being unique among all his poetry for its emotional content.

In 1785 Monti published his tragedy &quot;Aristodemo&quot;, which was received with great favour. Encouraged by this success, Monti undertook a new tragedy in the Alfieri manner, this time with a subject drawn from fifteenth-century Italian history, &quot;Galeotto Manfredi&quot;. In 1791 he married the actress who bore him a daughter, Costanza, and a son, Francesco (the latter dies at only two years old). Through her the singer Fanny Eckerlin is his niece.

In the aftermath of the French Revolution Monti&#x27;s verses became more political. At first he was a militant classicist and counter-revolutionary; but he later became an advocate of Romantic attitudes and an enthusiastic supporter of Napoleon. In 1793 he published the &quot;Bassvilliana&quot;, (1793; tr. A. Lodge, &quot;The Death of Bassville&quot;, 1845), the most important anti-revolutionary poem that had yet appeared in Italy. The subject of the &quot;Bassvilliana&quot;, four cantos in &quot;terza rima&quot;, was provided by a political assassination: on 13 January 1793 Nicolas Jean Hugou de Basseville, who had been sent to Naples as secretary to the French Legation to sustain the Republican cause, was stabbed to death by a mob stirred up against him by the reactionaries. At this time Monti deplored the excesses of the Revolution and the violence of the Jacobins, and in the poem he turned the interest away from the protagonist to the unfortunate Louis XVI, who is presented as an innocent victim of the Revolutionaries. The &quot;Bassvilliana&quot; was a great success and passed through eighteen editions in six months.

In 1797 Monti left Rome and, after visiting Bologna and Venice, finally settled in Milan, forsaking his former opposition to the French Revolution (expressed in the &quot;Bassvilliana&quot;) and becoming a supporter of the newborn Cisalpine Republic. From 1797 until 1799 was secretary of foreign affairs of the Cisalpine Republic, then secretary of the Directoire.

In 1799, he was forced to leave the city when the French were defeated, but it took him only two years to come back, following the Battle of Marengo (1800). While in Paris, Monti devoted more and more of his time to translations from French and Latin, which today are considered to be his best works: he published &quot;La Pucelle d&#x27;Orleans&quot; by Voltaire, soon to be followed by the &quot;Satire&quot; by Persius and the &quot;Iliade&quot; (Iliad) by Homer.

When the French returned to Italy, Monti also returned, this time official Poet Laureate of the new Kingdom of Italy. Soon after his return, Monti published his tragedy of &quot;Caio Gracco&quot;, &quot;La Mascheroniana&quot;, a poem on the death of his friend Lorenzo Mascheroni, and his beautiful and popular hymn &quot;Per la liberazione d&#x27;Italia&quot;. In 1802 Monti was appointed to the chair of eloquence and poetry in the University of Pavia and on the coronation of Napoleon, in 1805, was appointed &quot;Historiographer of the Italic Reign&quot;. He filled this office rather as court poet than historian, and lavished a profusion of eulogistic verses on the emperor and his family. He was made knight of the Legion of Honour and of the Iron Crown, and was chosen a member of the Institute of the Kingdom of Italy.

In these years Monti wrote &quot;Il beneficio&quot; (1805), celebrating the coronation of the emperor, &quot;Il bardo della selva nera&quot; (1806) - a classical-Romantic pastiche influenced especially by Ossian and the bardic verse of Thomas Gray &quot;La spada di Federigo&quot; (1806), and various other works, in a variety of forms, in which Napoleon was either directly or indirectly honoured. His translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot; in &quot;versi sciolti&quot;, which appeared in 1810, is often regarded as the most beautiful of the Italian versions of this much-translated work and Monti&#x27;s poetic masterpiece.

After the fall of Napoleon in 1815, Monti tried to win back the Austrian regime with his last poems &quot;Il mistico omaggio&quot; and &quot;Il ritorno di Astrea&quot;, before committing to the development of Italian linguistics during his last years. His later years were embittered by ill-health and by financial worries. He adopted a conservative standpoint and in his last poem, the &quot;Sermone sulla mitologia&quot; (1825), he roundly condemned Romantic aesthetics and defended the rights of the new literature to use mythological imaterial, as he himself was doing in &quot;Le nozze di Cadmo e d&#x27;Ermione&quot; (1825).

Monti&#x27;s poetry is notable for its rational polish and its formal elegance. A staunch classicist, he defended the value of the imaginative and evocative use of mythology (cf. &quot;La Musogonia&quot;, 1793-7), as opposed to the emotional emphasis of the Romantics (cf. the polemical &quot;Sermone sulla mitologia&quot;, 1825).

==Criticism==
Many authors have given different opinions about the poet&#x27;s value. Two factors are generally agreed upon, but they are given different weight yielding a more or less favourable judgement: the lack of ideals and authenticity, and the superior technical skills.

In the fast-changing political scenario of his time, Monti appears not to live up to his ideals: he is blamed from the political point of view for being first an opposer to the French Revolution, then an open supporter of Napoleon, then eventually a supporter of the Austrian Empire. Furthermore, he is accused of expressing insincere feelings in his works and of only caring about the formal aspects of his productions.

In a time of strong political ideals such as the &quot;Risorgimento&quot; and strong interior passions such as Romanticism, famous representatives of
Italian literature such as Ugo Foscolo and Giacomo Leopardi pointed to these as unforgivable flaws, whereas in their opinion a poet should never give up his beliefs in exchange for practical advantages, and should prefer a worthy content over a much refined literary technique.

<text>Boiler Room is a 2000 American crime drama film written and directed by Ben Younger and starring Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Nia Long, Ben Affleck, Nicky Katt, Scott Caan, Tom Everett Scott, Ron Rifkin and Jamie Kennedy. The film was conceived when Younger interviewed for a job at brokerage firm Sterling Foster. &quot;I walked in and immediately realized, &#x27;This is my movie.&#x27; I mean, you see these kids and know something is going on.&quot;

The film was nominated for several awards including a Black Reel Award, a British Independent Film Award and two Independent Spirit Awards. It won the Special Jury Prize at the 2000 Deauville Film Festival.

==Plot==

In 1999, Seth Davis, a 19-year-old Queens College dropout, runs an unlicensed casino in his home near the campus, catering to college students. Although he earns a successful living, he is a disappointment to his father, Marty, a New York City federal judge. One night, his cousin Adam stops by the casino to play blackjack, bringing a rich associate named Greg Weinstein along with him. Greg recruits Seth to join J. T. Marlin, a brokerage firm based somewhere off the Long Island Expressway, promising him that he has the opportunity to get rich.

Arriving at J. T. Marlin, Seth attends a group interview and learns from Jim Young, one of the co-founders of the firm, what is expected of his work and also how he can become a millionaire, which he assures to the new applicants will happen within three years of their first day of employment at J. T. Marlin. The firm&#x27;s techniques of selling are through cold calling investors to sell stock, and Seth joins as a stockbroker trainee, having to close 40 accounts and pass a Series 7 Exam to begin working independently. The brokers love to quote insider trader Gordon Gekko from &quot;Wall Street&quot;, seeing him as a role model. He is soon making a good living, as well as winning his father&#x27;s approval and embarking on a romance with Abbie Halpert, a secretary and Greg&#x27;s ex-girlfriend.

Gradually, he learns that J. T. Marlin is a chop shop brokerage firm that runs a &quot;pump and dump&quot;, using its brokers to create artificial demand in the stock of expired or fake companies, and speculative penny stocks. When the firm is done pumping the stock, the firm founders sell and trade for legitimate stocks for record profits. However, the investors then have no one to sell their shares to in the market when the price of the stock plummets, causing them to lose their investment. The FBI agents investigating the firm decide to pursue Seth, hoping to make him their informant.

Seth passes his Series 7 Exam and becomes a broker. He then contacts Harry Reynard, the purchasing manager of a gourmet foods company. Although Harry is reluctant, he gives in after Seth lies that the stock is guaranteed to go up in value; Seth sells him 100 shares at $8 each. When the stock&#x27;s value drops, Harry calls back to ask why the stock has done so poorly, only to have Seth persuade him to buy more worthless shares. The stock eventually tanks, costing Harry his savings and his family.

Feeling guilty for scamming Harry, Seth resolves to shut the firm down. Marty, discovering that J.T. Marlin was nothing more than a chop shop meant to scam gullible investors, then disowns him, accusing him of destroying peoples&#x27; lives. Seth investigates further, discovering that the firm&#x27;s founders are already preparing to abandon J. T. Marlin, destroy the records, and cut ties with their employees to re-brand and start their scheme under a new name, leaving their victims to face a lengthy legal battle without much hope of recovering their money. Seth shows up at his father&#x27;s office and tearfully explains that he shut down his casino and went along with a highly criminal line of work that he thought was legal to gain his family&#x27;s approval. He then requests that his father help him on an IPO scheme to rob the firm of their money and bring them down, hoping that his actions, while illegal, will recover enough money to help J. T. Marlin&#x27;s victims. Although Marty initially refuses due to the risk of losing his judgeship, he calls Seth the next day, reconciling with him and offering to help with the scheme.

Seth is eventually arrested by the FBI for the violation of 26 SEC and NASD regulations, and is brought into their custody along with his father, as the bureau had discovered their IPO scheme from a tape-recorded phone conversation. The FBI offer him federal immunity if he agrees to testify against J. T. Marlin once all the suspects are brought into court, and threaten to involve Marty in order to assure Seth&#x27;s cooperation. Seth asserts that he will testify against the firm and provide strong evidence of their illegal practices only if his father is released. He and the agents come to an agreement on this, with Seth being kept overnight. After that, it is implied that he will be free to go as the FBI will proceed to raid the building and prosecute everybody else.

Seth returns to work the next day and goes along with the FBI&#x27;s instructions to make copies of investment files onto a floppy disk to use as evidence. Before leaving, Seth attempts to get Harry&#x27;s money back. He lies to Michael Brantley, the company&#x27;s founder, by explaining that the firm can lose a lot of money by refusing to continue to do business with Harry Reynard, who Seth makes out to be an important prospect at a make-or-break point. Brantley agrees to proceed, offering him shares of the next IPO, with a caveat that he cannot sell the shares until the firm has sold off theirs. In order to sell the shares behind Michael&#x27;s back, Seth needs a sell ticket signed by a senior broker, something that his direct supervisor, Greg, has explicitly said that he would never do. He seeks a signing from Chris Varick, explaining that he may as well &quot;do one thing right&quot; in helping a severely hit investor make his money back, now that the firm will be raided and, soon enough, there will be no future in continuing business at J. T. Marlin. Chris reluctantly agrees, and proceeds to escape the building in an attempt to flee federal enforcement. Seth walks out to his car, deciding what to do with his life now that his ties with J. T. Marlin are finished. As he departs in his car, several FBI cars, buses, and tow trucks enter the parking lot, with agents storming out ready to raid the building.

==Cast==
==Production==
In interviews, Ben Younger said he was inspired to write the script for the film after going to a job interview at a Long Island-based brokerage firm that turned out to be a pyramid scheme. Younger said he used a speech given by a top broker to the would-be trainees as the model for the lecture the Jim Young character makes early in the film. Jordan Belfort, a former stockbroker and financial criminal who would write &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, claimed that the movie was also loosely based on his rise and fall. Younger spent two years interviewing stockbrokers at boiler rooms, where callers aggressively peddle often fraudulent investments to consumers. Younger sold his script on the condition that he direct. Artisan Entertainment initially backed the production and helped bring actors Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, and Affleck to the project, but later backed out. New Line Cinema then stepped in for distribution.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film opened in the United States on February 18, 2000 alongside &quot;Hanging Up&quot;, &quot;Pitch Black&quot; and &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot;, grossing $6.7 million on its opening weekend. Eventually, the film grossed $17 million domestically and $11.8 million in other territories, with a worldwide total of $28.8 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 66% based on reviews from 104 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;Its ending is disappointingly tidy, but &quot;Boiler Room&quot; boasts just enough sharp writing and brisk pacing to make getting there worthwhile.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 63 out of 100 based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C+ on scale of A to F.

Multiple critics noted the film&#x27;s echoes of other corporate greed films like &quot;Wall Street&quot; and &quot;Glengarry Glenn Ross&quot;. Malcolm Johnson of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; wrote &quot;Affleck, the best-known actor in the ensemble, proves no match for Alec Baldwin of &quot;&#x27;Glengarry&quot;,&#x27; who played a similar character in David Mamet&#x27;s look at a phony real estate operation.&quot; He also said &quot;the screenplay misses the verbal pyrotechnics of both [Oliver] Stone and Mamet.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote Giovanni Ribisi &quot;captures Seth&#x27;s man-child suavity as well as his childish sensitivity, and the sweetness underneath his cynicism&quot;, and &quot;Nia Long brings wit and patience to the underwritten role of Marlin&#x27;s receptionist and Seth&#x27;s love interest, a black woman surrounded by white guys trying to act like homeboys.&quot; Vin Diesel was also cited as being one of the more &quot;likable&quot; characters at the brokerage firm.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and wrote: &quot;Has the high-octane feel of real life, closely observed.&quot; Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a mixed review and said while it &quot;begins extremely well as a saga of greed and conspicuous consumption...it gradually loses its bite.&quot; Levy also praised Affleck for his performance. James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; gave it 3 out of 4 stars and called it &quot;A compelling movie-going experience.&quot; Berardinelli praised the attention to detail and said the film achieves &quot;the same sort of insight into stock brokering that &quot;Glengarry Glenn Ross&quot; offered into sales. In fact, this aspect of the film is what makes &quot;Boiler Room&quot; a compelling movie-going experience. The characters and plot become secondary to the setting and atmosphere.&quot;

<doc id="837500" wikidata="Q1743540" url="?curid=837500" title="Theaudience (band)">
<text>Theaudience (styled as theaudience) were an English rock band, formed in London in 1996. They released one album and saw three singles enter the UK Singles Chart. The band&#x27;s lead vocalist Sophie Ellis-Bextor became a successful solo artist after the band&#x27;s disbandment.

== History ==
theaudience were founded by guitarist Billy Reeves, formerly of the indie group Congregation. The group was fronted by Sophie Ellis-Bextor and included drummer/producer &quot;Patch&quot; Hannan (ex-The Sundays), keyboard player Nigel Butler (ex-The Bridge), guitarist Dean Mollett (ex-Porcupine) and bass guitarist Kerin Smith. Their one self-titled album received critical acclaim and reached No. 22 in the UK Albums Chart, with two of four singles released reaching the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart.

Reeves left the band in December 1998, and although the remaining band members wrote and demoed at least 33 songs for a second album, it was rejected by record label Mercury Records, who then dropped the band, which split in 1999. Approximately half of these tracks were leaked onto the internet, most of which appeared as a fourteen-track bootleg album in 2009 under the fan-made title &quot;Quiet Storm&quot;.

Ellis-Bextor started a solo career in major label artist-driven dance-pop music following the success of her collaboration with Spiller on &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot; in 2000.

== Discography ==
The discography of Theaudience consists of one studio album, four singles and four music videos. The album track &quot;Keep In Touch&quot; was earmarked as a potential fifth single.

Thirty three songs were recorded as full band demos in 1998-1999 for a second album, just over half of which circulate as bootleg/download tracks. One such track, &quot;Out With The Old School&quot; was released contemporarily on NME sampler cassette &quot;Wicked Women&quot; in late 1998.

<doc id="837503" wikidata="Q1152965" url="?curid=837503" title="Adolphe Monticelli">
<text>Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli (October 14, 1824 – June 29, 1886) was a French painter of the generation preceding the Impressionists.

==Biography==

Monticelli was born in Marseille in humble circumstances. He attended the École Municipale de Dessin in Marseille from 1842 to 1846, and continued his artistic training in Paris, where he studied under Paul Delaroche at the École des Beaux-Arts. In Paris he made copies after the Old Masters in the Louvre, and admired the oil sketches of Eugène Delacroix. In 1855 he met Narcisse Diaz, a member of the Barbizon school, and the two often painted together in the Fontainebleau Forest. Monticelli frequently adopted Diaz&#x27;s practice of introducing nudes or elegantly costumed figures into his landscapes.

He developed a highly individual Romantic style of painting, in which richly colored, dappled, textured and glazed surfaces produce a scintillating effect. He painted courtly subjects inspired by Antoine Watteau; he also painted still lifes, portraits, and Orientalist subjects that owe much to the example of Delacroix.

After 1870, Monticelli returned to Marseille, where he lived in poverty despite a prolific output, selling his paintings for small sums. An unworldly man, he dedicated himself single-mindedly to his art.

The young Paul Cézanne befriended Monticelli in the 1860s, and the influence of the older painter&#x27;s work can be seen in Cézanne&#x27;s work of that decade. Between 1878 and 1884 the two artists often painted landscapes together, once spending a month roaming the Aix countryside. Although Monticelli experimented briefly around 1870 with a treatment of light reflecting the discoveries of the Impressionists, he found the objectivity of this approach uncongenial.

Confronted with criticism of his style of painting Monticelli himself remarked, &quot;I paint for thirty years from now&quot;. His work reached its greatest spontaneity in the decade before his death in 1886.

==Legacy==

More than a century after his death, Monticelli&#x27;s art is still subject to controversy.

In its painterly freedom Monticelli&#x27;s work prefigures that of Vincent van Gogh, who greatly admired his work after seeing it in Paris when he arrived there in 1886. Van Gogh immediately adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, and later remarked, &quot;I sometimes think I am really continuing that man.&quot; In 1890, Van Gogh and his brother Theo were instrumental in publishing the first book about Monticelli.

Monticelli&#x27;s reputation grew after his death. Among his collectors was Oscar Wilde who, after going to prison in 1895, wrote of his bankruptcy in a letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, &quot;De Profundis&quot;: &quot;That all my charming things were to be sold: my Burne-Jones drawings: my Whistler drawings: my Monticelli: my Simeon Solomons: my china: my Library...&quot;

Others have expressed disdain for Monticelli&#x27;s work. In a statement published in 2005 in The Guardian, Sir Timothy Clifford, director general of the National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh, even chose Monticelli&#x27;s &quot;A Garden Fete&quot; as the worst painting in Britain, and commented, &quot;We have been bequested eight paintings by Monticelli, each one more hideous than the last. In my 21 years here, none has been hung because I think Monticelli produces screamingly awful art. I call this one a Fete Worse Than Death.&quot;

A monument honoring Monticelli, designed in 1909 by the sculptor Auguste Carli, is installed in the Palais Longchamp Marseille.

==Exhibitions==

From September 2008 until January 2009, an exhibition entitled &quot;Van Gogh and Monticelli&quot; took place in Marseille&#x27;s &quot;Centre de la Vieille Charité&quot;, highlighting Monticelli&#x27;s influence on Van Gogh&#x27;s work.

From April 25 until September 27, 2015, an exhibition entitled &quot;Van Gogh and Co. Criss-crossing the collection&quot; at the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, The Netherlands, displayed paintings by Van Gogh and his predecessors, contemporaries and followers, among them François Bonvin, Charley Toorop, Henri Fantin-Latour, Jean-Baptiste Corot, Paul Cézanne, Bart van der Leck and Adolphe Monticelli.

<text>James Gabriel Montresor (19 November 1704 – 6 January 1776) was a British military engineer.

==Early life and the western Mediterranean==
Montresor was born on Broad Street or St. James&#x27;s, Westminster, 19 November 1704, the son of James Gabriel le Trésor and Nanon de Hauteville. His father, who belonged to a Huguenot refugee family, joined the British service and was naturalized, taking the name of Montresor. He would later become Lieutenant Governor of Fort William where he died 22 January 1723/4.

Joining the Royal Artillery, Montresor is said to have been present at the 1727 siege of Gibraltar, but more credible accounts place him in Menorca, as a matross. He was later a bombardier at Gibraltar, and was there commissioned as an engineer in 1731. He continued to serve at Gibraltar, with a brief interlude in Menorca, until in 1747 he was named chief engineer of Gibraltar. He had also held a commission as Lieutenant in the 14th Regiment of Foot since 23 July 1737.

==America==
In 1754, he was appointed chief engineer for General Braddock and went to America with the troops. He is frequently said to have been present at the defeat of Braddock&#x27;s expedition in 1755, but this appears to confuse him with his son John Montresor, who was wounded in the battle (some accounts suggest illness prevented the father&#x27;s presence). He spent most of the remainder of the French and Indian War in and around Albany, where his activities included the design and construction of numerous military fortifications, including a new fort on the site previously occupied by Fort William Henry, named Fort George. Montresor was promoted to Director and Lieutenant Colonel, Royal Engineers, 4 Jan. 1758.

==Return to Britain==
By 1760, he had risen to the role of Chief Engineer in the Provinces, and in recognition of his efforts in New York he was granted 10,000 acres (40 km2) of land on the eastern (Vermont) side of Lake Champlain. However, in that year ill health forced his return to England, followed by the resignation of his commission in the 14th Foot in 1762. He would later construct powder magazines at Purfleet, and was chief engineer at Chatham. Throughout his career, he also drafted numerous maps and plans of the areas around which he was stationed, and kept journals, which have been published.

James Gabriel Montresor married first, 11 June 1735, Mary Haswell, daughter of Robert Haswell, Master Attendant of the royal dockyard at Gibraltar. By her he had two daughters and five sons, most notable among these being John Montresor. Mary died 5 March 1761. He remarried 25 August 1766, Henrietta Fielding, daughter of novelist Henry Fielding who was already &quot;in deep decline&quot;, and died months later, 11 December 1766. Montresor married as his third wife Frances Nickolls, daughter of H. Nickolls and widow of William Kemp. He died at Teynham, Kent, 6 January 1776.
