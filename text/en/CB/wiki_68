<text>The Moose Fraternity (formerly The Loyal Order of Moose) is a fraternal and service organization founded in 1888 and headquartered in Mooseheart, Illinois.

Moose International supports the operation of Mooseheart Child City &amp; School, a community for children and teens in need, located west of Chicago; and Moosehaven, a retirement community for its members near Jacksonville, Florida.

Additionally, the Moose organization conducts numerous sports and recreational programs, in local Lodge/Chapter facilities called either Moose Family Centers or Activity Centers, in the majority of 44 State and Provincial Associations, and on a fraternity-wide basis. There is also a Loyal Order of Moose in Britain. These organizations together make up the Moose International.

== History ==
The Loyal Order of Moose was founded in Louisville, Kentucky, in the spring of 1888 by Dr. John Henry Wilson. Originally intended purely as a men&#x27;s social club, lodges were soon founded in Cincinnati, Ohio; St. Louis, Missouri; and Crawfordsville and Frankfort, Indiana. The early order was not prosperous. Dr. Wilson was dissatisfied and left the order of the Moose before the turn of the century. When Albert C. Stevens was compiling his &quot;Cyclopedia of Fraternities&quot; in the late 1890s, he was unable to ascertain whether it was still in existence.

In the fall of 1906, the Order had only the two Indiana lodges remaining. On October 27 of that year James J. Davis became the 247th member of the Order. Davis was a Welsh immigrant who had come to the United States as a youth and worked as an iron puddler in the steel mills of Pennsylvania and an active labor organizer (he later became United States Secretary of Labor in the Harding administration). He saw the Order as a way to provide a social safety net for a working class membership, using a low annual membership fee of $10–$15 (equivalent to $–$ in ). After giving a rousing address to the seven delegates of the 1906 Moose national convention, he was appointed &quot;Supreme Organizer&quot; of the Order. Davis and a group of organizers set out to recruit members and establish lodges throughout the US and Canada. He was quite successful, and the Order grew to nearly half a million members in 1,000 lodges by 1912.

===Racial discrimination===
Old National Moose Lodge bylaws restricted membership in this men&#x27;s club to white people. In 1972, K. Leroy Irvis, an African-American member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, was invited to visit a lodge in Harrisburg by a member as a guest. The lodge dining room refused to serve Irvis on account of his race. Irvis sued the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board in federal court, arguing that the issuance of a liquor license to an organization with racially discriminatory policies constituted an illegal state action. A Pennsylvania court ruled in Irvis&#x27; favor. The case was ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled that Irvis lacked standing to sue based on membership and that state was not involved in the discriminatory guest practices to qualify as a state action prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.

In 1994, a Moose Lodge in Hagerstown, Maryland, denied membership based on race. Officials at Moose International took action and revoked the charter of the Moose Lodge.

=== Mooseheart and Moosehaven ===
At the 1911 convention in Detroit, Davis, the &quot;Director General&quot; of the Order, recommended that the LOOM (Loyal Order Of Moose) acquire property for an &quot;Institute&quot;, &quot;School&quot; or &quot;College&quot; that would be a home, schooling, and vocational training for the orphans of LOOM members. For months offers came in and a number of meetings were held regarding the project. It was eventually agreed that the center should be located somewhere near the center of population, adjacent to both rail and river transportation and within a day&#x27;s travel to a major city. On December 14, 1912, the leaders of the organization decided to purchase the 750-acre Brookline Farm. Brookline was a dairy farm near Batavia, Illinois. It was close to the Fox River, two railway lines and the (then dirt) Lincoln Highway. The leadership also wished to buy additional real estate to the west and north owned by two other families, for a total of 1,023 acres. Negotiations for the purchases were held in January and February 1913, and legal possession of the property was taken on March 1. The name &quot;Mooseheart&quot; had been adopted for the school at the suggestion of Ohio Congressman and Supreme Council member John J. Lentz by a unanimous joint meeting of the Supreme Council and Institute Trustees on February 1. Mooseheart was dedicated on July 27, 1913. Vice President Thomas R. Marshall gave a speech for the occasion.

While Mooseheart began as a school, it soon grew to become a small incorporated village and hub of the organization, housing the headquarters of the LOOM as well as the Women of the Moose. The population of Mooseheart would grow to 1,000 by 1920, reach a peak of 1,300 during the Great Depression, and decline to approximately 500, the campus&#x27; current maximum capacity, in 1979.

In addition to Mooseheart, the LOOM also runs a retirement center, Moosehaven, located in Orange Park, Florida. This project was inaugurated in the autumn of 1922 with 26 acres of property and 22 retired Moose residents. It has grown to a 63-acre community with over 400 residents.

== Organization ==
Local units are called &quot;Lodges&quot;, state groups are &quot;State Associations&quot; and the national authority is the &quot;Supreme Lodge of the World&quot;, which meets annually. In 1923 there were 1,669 lodges &quot;promulgated in every civilized country controlled by the Caucasian race&quot;. In 1966 3,500 lodges were reported in every US state, Guam, Canada, Bermuda and England. In 1979 the Order had 36 State Associations and over 4,000 Lodges. Today it has 1,600 Lodges in 49 states, four Canadian provinces, and the United Kingdom.

The entire membership is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Moose Domain&quot;.

== Membership ==
Until at least the 1970s, membership was restricted to white men of &quot;sound mind and body, in good standing in the community, engaged in lawful business who are able to speak and write the English language&quot;. In June 1972 the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a decision partially in the Order&#x27;s favor, saying that a Moose Lodge in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, need not have its state liquor license revoked because it refused to serve a Black guest, but that the state could subsequently condition its license on nondiscriminatory practices.

In the early 1920s, the LOOM reportedly had over half a million members, with 32,570 in the Mooseheart Legion and 5,178 in the Junior Order of Moose.

== Rituals ==
An important ritual for the Moose is the &quot;9 o&#x27;clock Ceremony&quot;. At nine o&#x27;clock, all Moose are directed to face toward Mooseheart with bowed heads and folded arms and repeat a silent prayer &quot;Let the little children come unto me, do not keep them away. For they are like the Kingdom of Heaven. God bless Mooseheart.&quot; At that same time the children of Mooseheart kneel at their bedside in prayers as well. There are also the ten &quot;thou shalts&quot;. These begin with &quot;Thou shalt believe in God and worship Him as thy conscience dictates. Thou shalt be tolerant to let others worship each in his own way&quot;. Other &quot;thou shalts&quot; pertain to patriotism, service to fellowmen, protection of the weak, avoidance of slander to a brother Moose, love of the LOM, faithfulness and humility

James Davis drew up the initiation ritual for the order. It is relatively short, usually taking 45 minutes. The governor of the lodge asks the Sergeant-at-Arms to administer the Moose obligation. After candidates are asked if they believe in a Supreme Being, and if they are willing to assume the obligation they take the oath with their left hand on their heart and their right hand raised. Among other things, this obligation pledges the candidate not to &quot;communicate or disclose or give any information—concerning anything—I may hereafter hear, see or experience in this lodge or in any other Lodge&quot;. At this point, the lodge performs the 9 o&#x27;clock ceremony, and then the lodge chaplain or prelate explains the ten &quot;thou shalts&quot;. Next, the governor grasps the hands of the candidates while the members sing &quot;Blest Be the Tie that Binds&quot;. Finally, the governor administers the second part of the obligation, the candidates promise to support Mooseheart and Moosehaven, help fellow Moose, settle disputes within the order, and not join any unauthorized Moose organizations. The prelate offers another prayer at the altar, and all then join in singing &quot;Friendship We Now Extend&quot;.

There are also death and graveside services, granted on request of the family of deceased Moose, as well as a Memorial Day ceremony every first Sunday in May. The lodge altar is draped in black and white cloth, a Bible, a flower and drapes are placed on the lodge charter and the lodge prelate leads the members in prayers and the singing of &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot;.
After the Moose unified its male and female members under the &quot;One Moose&quot; banner, many of the original LOOM (now called the Lodge) rituals were removed from required meeting practices. 

=== Gustin–Kenny incident ===
On July 24, 1913, two candidates for LOOM membership, Donald A. Kenny and Christopher Gustin, died during their initiation ceremony in Birmingham, Alabama. Kenny was the president of the local Chauffeurs Union, and Gustin was an iron moulder. Both men were made to look upon a red hot emblem of the Order, and then blindfolded and disrobed and have a chilled rubber version of the emblem applied to their chests while a magneto was attached to their legs and an electric current was applied to them by a wire to their shoulders. The aim was evidently to make them believe that they were being branded. Both men fainted, but, as it was thought that they were feigning, the lodge officers did not stop the initiation until it was evident that the two were dying and the lodge physician was unable to revive them.

== Benefits and philanthropy ==
The LOOM has historically supported numerous charitable and civic activities. It has sponsored medical research for muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, cancer and cardiology, as well as the March of Dimes. It has also supported Boy Scout and Girl Scout programs.

Moose distributed a recruiting video, filmed in 2000, called &quot;Unbelievably Cool&quot;.

== Independent, Benevolent and Protective Order of Moose ==
In 1925, the LOOM brought a suit against the Independent, Benevolent and Protective Order of Moose, an African American order. They attempted to obtain a legal injunction to keep them from using the Moose name, ritual, emblem and titles of its officers. The New York Supreme Court found that the evidence presented by the Loyal Order of Moose was inadmissible, and it found in favor of the Independent, Benevolent and Protective Order of Moose. 

In another lawsuit heard by a Maryland Circuit Court, the Loyal Order of Moose sued the Independent, Benevolent and Protective Order of Moose, saying they had infringed on its intellectual property by using the word &quot;moose&quot; in its name, by using the moose in its emblem, and by having similar rituals. The court found that the two organizations&#x27; emblems and part of their rituals were virtually identical, and the court restrained the African American order from using the word &quot;moose&quot; in its name. The court allowed the Independent, Benevolent and Protective Order of Moose to continue using the same fraternal titles and colors. 

The IBPOOM was an unrelated all-African woman order.

== Religious objections ==
By 1966, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Synod forbade membership in the Loyal Order of Moose. The Catholic Church, however, has never explicitly objected to the Moose, despite having condemned similar organizations, such as the Freemasons, for their oaths and other rituals. Papal Encyclicals, specifically Paragraph 9 of Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s 1884 encyclical: Humanum Genus, condemn any and all Freemasonic organizations and sects and bans the laity from becoming members.

<doc id="829567" wikidata="Q1777778" url="?curid=829567" title="Ko Phi Phi Don">
<text>Ko Phi Phi Don (, , ) is the largest of the islands in the Phi Phi archipelago, in Thailand. Phi Phi Don is 10.27 km2 (3.76 mi2): 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) in length and 3.5 kilometres (2.2 miles) wide. Part of the islands are administratively part of Ao Nang in Krabi Province. It is the only island in the group with permanent inhabitants, although most are temporary workers servicing the tourist trade.

Like the other islands in the archipelago, Phi Phi Don is a non-volcanic island largely made of limestone. It is almost separated into two islands, but a strand of flat land connects them. On this strand lies the largest settlement on the island, as well as most of the resorts.

==Villages==

*Laem Tong
*Ban Ton Sai
*Hat Yao

==2004 tsunami==

More than 1,000 people died 26 December 2004, when a tsunami struck the island.

Lohdalum Bay was hit the hardest, with the majority of the bungalows and restaurants along the beach destroyed. There is a memorial for those killed in the tsunami on the beach facing Lohdalum Bay. Every year, there is a small memorial service where family members and friends come to pay their respects and talk about those they lost. A moment of silence is observed at the time the tsunami hit.

There were three waves: the first one flooded Lohdalum Bay, the second destroyed all of the wooden buildings and the third and largest ruined stone buildings as if they were made of sand. The whole tsunami lasted for only three minutes (from 10:29–10:32) but it nearly destroyed the whole island.

==Environment==

Most of the Phi Phi Islands are in a protected marine reserve, part of Hat Noppharat Thara-Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park. But parts of Phi Phi Don are outside the park&#x27;s jurisdiction, and under the jurisdiction of, and funded by, the Ao Nang Tambon Administrative Organisation (TAO). Its budget is based on the number of permanent, registered residents and takes no account of visitors. The island has very few documented residents. Most who service the tourist trade are registered residents elsewhere in Thailand. The number of residents, permanent and temporary, is dwarfed by the number of visitors. Thus, the Ao Nang TAO allocates only about 170 million baht per year to the Phi Phis. Underfunding has contributed to serious environmental issues.

===Solid waste===
The Phi Phi Islands in 2014 produced an average of 25 tonnes of solid waste a day, jumping to 40 tonnes during the high season that runs roughly from November to April. All tourists arriving on the island pay a 20 baht fee at Ton Sai Pier to assist in &quot;keeping Ko Phi Phi clean&quot;. The money, up to 20,000 baht per day (2014), is then paid to a private company to haul roughly 20 tonnes of rubbish from the island daily to Krabi for disposal. In 2014, the Ao Nang TAO paid 600,000 baht per month for this service. Collections from visitors amount to only about a third of the sum needed to effectively handle the solid waste generated.

===Water: potable and waste===
According to a research team from Kasetsart University&#x27;s Faculty of Engineering, Phi Phi Don suffers from a severe shortage of clean freshwater. The problem stems from the period of low rainfall coinciding with the high tourist season, exacerbated by improper handling of wastewater. During the driest period of the year, from November to April, the island is packed with tourists, causing water demand to spike. There is no rainfall to top up the two freshwater ponds that are the only sources of piped water on the island. The limited supply drives the cost of piped water up, in turn driving businesses to sink wells to tap ground water. This lowers the water table. Lowering aquifer water levels allows seawater to encroach on groundwater. In addition, the island&#x27;s water treatment plant cannot handle the volume of waste water generated, meaning that excess untreated waste water is flushed into the sea where it also contaminates groundwater. Short of substantial infrastructure investment, the lead Kasetsart researcher recommended that the number of visitors be capped at the carrying capacity of the island: 12,000 to 27,000 people per day. Her recommendation was prefigured in 2015 by a member of Thailand&#x27;s National Reform Council, who called Phi Phi a &quot;slum&quot; and recommending capping tourist numbers.

<text>Horn-Bad Meinberg (; Low German: &quot; Häoern-Möomag &quot;) is a German city in the Lippe district in the north-east of North Rhine-Westphalia on the edge of the Teutoburg forest. The district Bad Meinberg is a spa resort. It has 17,263 inhabitants (2019). It was formed in 1970 by merging various other municipalities that had grown together, including Bad Meinberg and Horn - the new entity&#x27;s original name was Bad Meinberg-Horn, before taking its present name.
Horn-Bad Meinberg is the location of the Externsteine, a rock formation consisting of several tall, narrow columns.

==Geography==
In the municipality are the two highest peaks of the Eggegebirge, the Lipp Velmerstot (441 m) and the Prussian Velmerstot with about (464 m) above sea level and the highest elevation of the Teutoburg forest, the Barnacken with (446 m). The deepest point of the metropolitan area is (125 m). 
Between the districts Horn and Holzhausen-Externsteine is the most famous natural monument of the Teutoburg Forest, the Externsteine, nearby springs the Wiembecke.

===Neighbouring communities===
Starting in the west the municipality is bordering to Schlangen, Detmold, Blomberg and Schieder-Schwalenberg in Lippe. It follows in the south Höxter with the community Steinheim. Southwest still meets the Kreis Paderborn with the communities Altenbeken and Bad Lippspringe on the border with the municipality Horn-Bad Meinberg.

===Constituent communities===
The merger of the city of Horn and the municipalities Bad Meinberg, Belle, Bellenberg, Billerbeck, Fromhausen, Heesten, Holzhausen-Externsteine, Leopoldstal, Schmedissen, Vahlhausen at Horn, Veldrom and Wehren and Kempenfeldrom and the integration of parts of the municipalities Oberschönenbuch Hagen (Fissenknick) and Schönemark (Wilberg) formed the newly Horn-Bad Meinberg&quot;

==Horn==

===History===
The oldest known written mention of &quot;Horn&quot; shows that the foundation of the city was in 1248. Armed conflicts around the city were especially during the Soest Feud (1444-1449) and during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618-1648). 1761 the town resisted in the Seven Years&#x27; War the siege of the French troops commanded by the princes of Beauvau.
In 1864, large parts of the city were destroyed by fire, including the old town hall; a new neo-Gothic town hall was built in its stead.
A connection for the city of Horn to the railway connection was made in 1895. The station was built outside the city center and is located on the route Detmold-Altenbeken.

==Settlement Moorlage==
In the east of Horn arose at the beginning of World War II, the &quot; settlement Moorlage &quot;. Reason was the relocation of the village Haustenbeck in Senne, which was given to the Sennelager Training Area. Many people from the community moved to Horn, where the company &quot;Künnemeyer&quot; needed workers. The farmers received courtyards of the &quot;Reichsumsiedlungsgesellschaft&quot;. On February 18, 1938, the first proposal was made to build a closed settlement. Some forty families settled around to Horn.
End of August 1939 arrived the first domestic, mayor Wilhelm Mehrmann. 1989 were still 42 of 44 settlement houses owned by the families, who they also built before the war.

<doc id="829645" wikidata="Q14953" url="?curid=829645" title="Lage, North Rhine-Westphalia">
<text>Lage () is a town in the Lippe district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, approximatively 8 km northwest of the administrative centre Detmold. It has 35,099 inhabitants (2016). The coat of arms of Lage depicts a farmer&#x27;s plough. The city is not far from the Teutoburg Forest. Due to its convenient location Lage developed into a traffic hub in the former Principality of Lippe, today&#x27;s district of Lippe.

==History==
Numerous finds indicate a colonization of the location since the Neolithic times (2400 to 1800 b.c.).

Around 900 a.d. the parish church of St. Johann (today&#x27;s Marktkirche) has been founded on a hillhock at the river Werre and is the origin of today&#x27;s city Lage. In 1274, Lage is mentioned the first time in a document for the life annuity of the local clergy by the sentence &quot;&quot;Jordanus plebanis in Lagis&quot;.&quot; In 1539, with the election of the first mayor self-administration rights are provable.

In 1843, borough rights were awarded by ruler Leopold II, Prince of Lippe. In the years after 1880 the construction of the railway lines Herford to Detmold (1880) and Bielefeld to Lemgo (1893) linked Lage to the surrounding cities by train and created an interchange station.

During World War I (1914-1918) the hospital served as a military hospital. Sections of the Infantry Regiment 67 were quartered in the town. On 9 January 1933, Adolf Hitler spoke on a central square (Jahnplatz) in Lage. During World War II (1939-1945) several attacks by Allied bombers hit the center of Lage, causing over 60 casualties in the local population and destroying many houses.

In 1970, the city merged to form a large municipality with a population of 32,000 with the surrounding communities Billinghausen, Ehrentrup, Hagen, Hardissen, Hedderhagen, Heiden, Heßloh, Horste, Kachtenhausen / Wellentrup, Müssen, Ohrsen, Pottenhausen, Stapelage, Waddenhausen and Wissentrup after local government reorganization.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Lage is twinned with:
* Horsham, England, United Kingdom
* Sankt Johann im Pongau, Austria

==Notable people==
*Heinemann Vogelstein (1841–1911), rabbi
*Gottlieb Reber (1880–1959), art collector
*Fritz Bracht (1899–1945), Nazi Gauleiter of Upper Silesia

<text>Nyeri is a town situated in the Central Highlands of Kenya. It is the county headquarters of Nyeri County and was the central administrative headquarters of the country&#x27;s former Central Province. The town is situated about 150 km north of Kenya&#x27;s capital Nairobi, in the country&#x27;s densely populated and fertile Central Highlands. The town lies between the eastern base of the Aberdare &quot;(Nyandarua)&quot; Range, which forms part of the eastern end of the Great Rift Valley, and the western slopes of Mount Kenya.

The town&#x27;s population, according to the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census, was estimated at 140,338 inhabitants. However, the number is rapidly growing. There is, however, a significant population of primarily Government and corporate workers who ordinarily reside in Nyeri but who, during the census, choose to be counted in their areas of origin or the areas where their families are residents. The town has a relatively low cost of living in comparison to Nairobi and other major urban centres in Kenya. Located in Kenya&#x27;s fertile highlands, food and water are plentiful and relatively affordable.

Nyeri hosts the tomb of Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout movement. It is also the home town of the late Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai. The town is also the home of the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT), founded by the local community in the early 1970s as an institute of technology, and converted into a fully fledged university in 2012.

== History ==
Towards the end of 1902, as the British were establishing their colonial presence, Richard Meinertzhagen marched a strong military column meeting spirited resistance from the native Kikuyu warriors led by Wangombe Wa Ihura. The Kikuyu were eventually defeated. After Meinertzhagen&#x27;s victory, a decision was reached to site a British post close to a little hill on the slopes of Mt. Kenya. The Kikuyu called the hill &quot;Kia-Nyiri&quot; while their Maasai neighbours called the hill &quot;Na-aier.&quot; The post took its name from the little hill. On 18 December 1902, Nyeri was founded.

Shortly after the establishment of the post, a trickle of European settlers and missionaries and Indian merchants began to migrate into Nyeri and the surrounding areas. The city soon burgeoned into a trading centre for white settler farmers who produced cattle, wheat and coffee. The city became particularly associated with the Happy Valley set in the first half of the twentieth century. The Nyeri Golf Club, The White Rhino Hotel, Outspan Hotel, and the Aberdare Country Club at the nearby Mweiga township are relics of those colonial days.

== Demographics and culture ==

=== Ethnicity and language ===
The majority of Nyeri residents are members of Kenya&#x27;s largest ethnic group, the Kikuyu, with residents generally being known as &quot;Nyeri Kikuyu&quot;. The Kikuyu language is widely spoken, along with Kenya&#x27;s National language Swahili as well as Kenya&#x27;s official language English.

=== Religion ===
Following the national pattern of Kenya being a predominantly Christian country, Christianity is the main religion. The main Christian denominations are Catholic-that hosts the Cathedral and the Archbishop&#x27;s official residence-, Presbyterian, Anglican, Pentecostals and indigenous denominations, in that order. The older residents, who tend to attend the mainstream churches, are invariably more religious than the younger ones. Muslims, traditional African believers and Hindus, in declining order, make up a small minority.

About 5 km from the city centre is the Mathari Mission settlement, a complex of several Catholic buildings and institutions, established by Italian missionaries at the beginning of the 20th century. The mission is composed of convents for nuns, schools, a teacher training college and other vocational colleges. It also hosts the Consolata Hospital and School of Nursing, which is staffed largely by nuns of the Consolata order. Nyeri is also the place where Blessed Stephanie Nyaatha was laid to rest.

=== Education ===

In addition to its two home-grown universities, Dedan Kimathi University of Technology and the recently upgraded Karatina University College, Nyeri hosts satellite campuses of various Kenyan public universities such as University of Nairobi and Kenyatta University.

The National Police Training College is situated in Kiganjo, 10.8 km from the city. There is a Medical Training College, a government nursing school, two polytechnic colleges, and several private and public secondary and primary schools such as Moi Nyeri Complex, Temple Road, DEB Muslim and Ngangarithi primary school. The town is also home to the Nyeri National Polytechnic.. Other technical training colleges in the town include Tetu TVC, Mathira TVC and Kieni Esat TVC as well as many vocational and technical training centres spread across the county. The Roman Catholic Church Archdiocese of Nyeri runs several schools, colleges, and hospitals. The town is also home to three national schools, Kagumo High School, Nyeri High School and the Bishop Gatimu Girls High School in Nyeri. It is the home to prestigious extra county schools in the nation like Othaya Boys High School and Mahiga Girls Secondary School. St. Mary&#x27;s Boys Secondary School Nyeri is another top-performing high school located in Nyeri&#x27;s town.

== Economy ==
The largest formal employer in Nyeri, being until recently the administrative headquarters of the former Central Province, is the Government of Kenya. The local Municipal Council and utility providers are also significant employers. The various sectors of the service industry, including retail, hospitality, banking, insurance, the charity industry, religious bodies especially the Catholic Church and professionals are also significant employers.

The main industrial plants are a Coca-Cola bottling plant, a water and fruit juice bottling plant, several tea and coffee processing factories, a milk processing and packaging factory owned and run by the Kenya Co-operative Creameries Ltd, and a number of maize millers. There is also a wide range of largely unsophisticated light industries, including motor vehicle repair garages, electronics repair shops, furniture workshops, tailoring shops, and bakeries. Attractive investment opportunities exist within the Nyeri industrial area of Kiganjo which is served by the newly refurbished railway line and has ample land for industrial expansion.

A major industry in Nyeri is farming, which is mostly unmechanised. The city urban area is actually part of the surrounding rural areas of greater Nyeri County, with farms within the municipality blending seamlessly into the rural area. The main cash crops are coffee and tea, grown mainly by smallholders who are organised into quasi-private state-supported and supervised co-operatives or companies for farm input distribution, basic processing and marketing purposes.

The main food crops are maize, the staple food in most of Kenya, legumes (especially beans and peas), tubers (mainly potatoes), and vegetables (especially tomatoes, cabbages, spinaches and kales). Livestock, mainly dairy cattle, goats, sheep, and chicken are also widely kept. Food crop and livestock farming are also done by smallholders, with marketing and distribution of surplus produce (after farmers&#x27; consumption) being done privately.

Tourism is also significant, as there are many tourist destinations nearby, including the Aberdare and Mount Kenya National Parks, and a number of hotels offering conference tourism and short upcountry holidays. The Nyeri Museum is located within Nyeri town, it houses cultural artifacts and Kenya&#x27;s colonial history.

=== Infrastructure ===
Nyeri has tarmacked roads, and the county and national governments are upgrading many of them. Houses have drinkable water, but sewage provision is through soak pits, pit latrines and septic tanks are still widespread. The city&#x27;s topography allows nature and gravity to take care of most of the city&#x27;s storm water drainage.

Phone services, especially mobile telephony, and internet services are widely available. A fibre optic cable network linking the city to offshore submarine cables recently reached Kenya&#x27;s coast.

=== Transport ===

Nyeri is served by a reasonably well-maintained tarmac road network connecting it to Nairobi, Nakuru, Nanyuki, Othaya and other surrounding towns. The newly built Kenol-Marua 4 lane super highway ends few kilometers from Nyeri town, Most transportation of cargo to and from Nyeri is by road, although the city has a largely underutilised railway station at Kiganjo (about six kilometres out of city towards Nanyuki) on the branchline of the railway from Nairobi to Nanyuki.

An airport and some airstrips serve the city: one at Mweiga (about out of city towards Nakuru) and another at Nyaribo, off the Nanyuki – Naromoru highway. The main mode of public passenger transport to, from, and within Nyeri is by way of fourteen-seater minibuses (matatu), though un-metered salon car taxis are also widely used. 

=== Notable graves ===

Nyeri has many visitors to the Baden-Powell grave, the resting place of Lieutenant-General Lord Baden-Powell, a British commander in the Boer War and the founder of the Scouting Movement, who once wrote &quot;the nearer to Nyeri the nearer to bliss&quot;. He and his wife Olave, Lady Baden-Powell, G.B.E., are buried in the City cemetery. Baden-Powell had a cottage built, which he called &quot;Paxtu&quot;. He lived there until his death, and it is now a small museum; it stands in the grounds of the Outspan Hotel. Nyeri remains a place of pilgrimage for the worldwide Scouting and Guiding Movements, with members congregating in the city from time to time for various activities and functions.

There are also visitors to the Italian War Memorial Chapel at Mathari, built in 1952 by the Italian government in honour of Royal Italian Army soldiers, prisoners of war, and other internees, from the time of the Second World War who died in East Africa, including 69 African recruits to the Italian forces, mostly Somalis. Among those buried at Mathari is Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, Viceroy of Italian East Africa, whose tomb is within the Chapel, in front of the altar.

The chapel is not used for regular worship, but a special Mass is celebrated every 2 November in memory of the fallen soldiers and those who died in captivity. Covering the walls of the main church building are memorials for the many Italian servicemen who died during the war. Each memorial is in the form of a small oblong plaque indicating the name of the soldier, the battalion he served in, and the place where he died.

Nyeri is also the burial place of hunter and conservationist Jim Corbett, the author of Man-Eaters of Kumaon (1944), who also spent his final years in Paxtu, B-P&#x27;s cottage.

==== Mount Kenya ====
Mount Kenya and Nyeri hill are near each other, as well as the Tetu hills 50 km to the North East. About 20 km from the city is Mount Kenya National Park. Mount Kenya is an extinct volcano lying astride the Equator. The mountain has two main snow-covered peaks – Batian (5 200 m) and Nelion (5 1880 m). It is the highest mountain in the country and the second, after Mount Kilimanjaro, in Africa.

The mountain slopes are covered in forest, bamboo, scrub and moorland giving way on high central peaks to rock, ice and snow. Its U-shaped glacial valleys, rugged snow-capped peaks, Afro-alpine desert, thirty lakes and eight different natural forest types and a variety of wildlife species make it a convergence of natural attractions. The wildlife found in the park include giant forest hog, tree hyrax, white-tailed mongoose, black leopard, mountain bongo, elephant, black rhino, suni, black-fronted duiker, mole-rat and over 130 species of birds. Activities taking place in the park include game drives, nature walks, mountain climbing, wildlife viewing, camping and cave exploration.

==== The Aberdares ====
About fifteen kilometres out of Nyeri on the opposite side to Mt. Kenya is the Aberdare National Park. The Aberdares is an old volcanic mountain range with lower peaks due to a longer period of erosion. It offers views of Mount Kenya to the east and the Great Rift Valley to the west. Its unusual vegetation, rugged terrain, deep ravines cutting through its forested eastern and western slopes, clear water streams and waterfalls combine to create an area of great scenic beauty. Its major attractions include the Lesatima and Kinangop peaks and many waterfalls, including the magnificent Karuru falls which drop 272 meters, Zaina falls which drop about 140 metrers and the Gura Falls which drop 305 meters.

The park is home to many endangered species including the rare bongo, giant forest hog, packs of the now very rare wild dogs, and endemic mole-rat and mole shrew. Other game include a large population of black rhino, leopard servile, endemic bird species, reptiles and insects. Activities include game drives and nature walks. Both brown and rainbow trout abound in the cool mountain streams. Within the park, lodges near watering holes offer close proximity night game viewing. It was at Treetops Lodge that Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (now Elizabeth II) was advised of the death of her father while on a honeymoon retreat, and her ascent to the throne. The park is also known for the Kimathi hideouts, the Mau-Mau Caves, and the Kimathi &quot;post office&quot; where agents used to drop messages for Mau Mau fighters during the guerrilla wars for Kenyan independence.

==== Private ranches ====
Close to the city are several privately owned ranches, many of which also serve as private wildlife sanctuaries like Solio Ranch, Ol Pejeta Conservancy, and Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. Many higher-end tourists stay at these ranches, including celebrities such as Bill Gates.

== Administration and government ==

Nyeri is now, as an administrative centre, currently in transition as the new governance and administrative structures created by the new Kenyan Constitution are in the early stages of implementation.

=== Central government ===
;Provincial Administration:
Nyeri, as aforesaid, had been the Provincial Headquarters of the now defunct Central Province.

<text>Fraternal Order of Eagles (F.O.E.) is a fraternal organization that was founded on February 6, 1898, in Seattle, Washington, by a group of six theater-owners including John Cort (the first president), brothers John W. and Tim J. Considine, Harry (H.L.) Leavitt (who later joined the Loyal Order of Moose), Mose Goldsmith and Arthur Williams. Originally made up of those engaged in one way or another in the performing arts, the Eagles grew and claimed credit for establishing the Mother&#x27;s Day holiday in the United States as well as the &quot;impetus for Social Security&quot; in the United States. Their lodges are known as &quot;aeries&quot;.

==History==


The Fraternal Order of Eagles was founded on February 6, 1898. The organization was formed by six theater owners sitting on a pile of lumber in Moran&#x27;s shipyard in Seattle, Washington. They were competitors who had come together to discuss a musicians&#x27; strike. After deciding how to handle the strike, they agreed to &quot;bury the hatchet&quot; and form an organization dubbed &quot;The Order of Good Things&quot;.

Early meetings were held on local theater stages, and after taking care of business, attendees rolled out a keg of beer and enjoyed social time. As numbers grew, participants selected the bald eagle as the official emblem and changed the name to &quot;The Fraternal Order of Eagles&quot;. In April 1898, the membership formed a Grand Aerie, secured a charter and developed a constitution and by-laws, with John Cort elected the Eagles&#x27; first president.

Touring theater troupes are credited with much of the Eagles&#x27; rapid growth. Most early members were actors, stagehands and playwrights, who carried the Eagles story as they toured across the United States and Canada. The organization&#x27;s appeal is also attributed to its funeral benefits (no Eagle was ever been known to be buried in a potter&#x27;s field), the provision of an aerie physician, and other membership benefits.
The Eagles pushed for the founding of Mother&#x27;s Day, provided the impetus for Social Security, and pushed to end job discrimination based on age. The Eagles have provided support for medical centers across the United States and Canada to build and provide research on medical conditions. Every year they raise millions of dollars to combat heart disease and cancer, help children with disabilities, and uplift the aged and infirm.

Some chapters of the Order once had a bad reputation for violating alcohol laws. This was stopped under President Frank E. Hering, who began revoking the charters of non-compliant Aeries. The organization&#x27;s strongest areas were the Mississippi Valley and the Rocky Mountain region. Many of its leaders, such as Frank E. Hering, were high degree Freemasons.

== History of the Aerie ==

An in nature is the lofty nest of any bird of prey, including eagles and hawks. In the Fraternal Order of Eagles, the term Aerie is the name of the building in which the members meet and hold events.

== History of the Auxiliary ==

A &quot;new era for the women of Eagledom&quot; began when an amendment to the Grand Aerie Laws to establish a Grand Auxiliary passed unanimously at the 1951 Grand Aerie Convention in Rochester, New York. Eagle Auxiliaries had existed before the Grand Auxiliary was formed, the first being founded on March 24, 1927, in Pittsburg, Kansas. Three days later, a second Auxiliary was established in Frontenac, Kansas. By March 1951, 965 local Auxiliaries were in existence, totaling 130,000 members. By the end of that year, 22 state and provincial Auxiliaries were also operating.

==Structure and Organization==

Local units are called &quot;Aeries&quot;. There were 1,400 Aeries scattered across the US and Canada in 2001. The national convention is known as the &quot;Grand Aerie&quot; and meets annually. &quot;Grand Aerie&quot; is also the name of the headquarters of the organization, currently at Grove City, Ohio.

Aeries are known by their instituting number and the name of the city in which they are located. The Aerie instituting number is appointed based on the order in which an Aerie is instituted; at current date the Grand Aerie is instituting Aeries in the 4500 range. Aerie #1, located in Seattle, Washington, is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Mother Aerie&quot;.

The Grand Aerie Fraternal Order of Eagles International Convention is held each year in a different city in either the United States or Canada. During the International Convention, delegates from all Aeries and Auxiliaries vote on the new Grand Aerie and Grand Auxiliary representatives, new by-laws and other relevant issues.

===Officers===

Officers of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, on a local and international level, are elected each year by popular vote of their delegates. State and regional leaders are appointed each year by the Grand Worthy and Grand Madam Presidents.

The organization is led by the two highest elected positions, the Grand Worthy President and the Grand Madam President. The Grand Worthy and Grand Madam Presidents serve a one-year term touring the two countries meeting and celebrating milestone events with all Aerie and Auxiliary members.

The Grand Aerie Officers are the operating body of the Fraternal Order of Eagles between conventions and work with the Board of Grand Trustees and the Grand Auxiliary. The Board of Grand Trustees, with the exception of the chairman of the board, is also an elected body. The chairman of the board is the immediate past Grand Worthy President.

== Membership ==

At one point the qualifications for membership were that one must be 21 years old, possess a good character, not be a Communist and be a Caucasian. By the late 1970s the all-white provision had officially been rescinded, but, because the Order used the blackball to admit new members, it was difficult for minorities to gain membership. In 1979 the FOE tried to get a lawsuit dismissed that alleged it was violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by not allowing African Americans to use their athletic facilities. The article stated that a local Eagle official could only cite Joe Louis as a black member of the FOE.

In 1979 the Order had 800,000 members, a figure said to have been relatively constant over a decade. In 2011, it had 850,000 members in the main organization and 250,000 members of the women&#x27;s auxiliary.

As of 2019, membership is open to any person of good moral character, and believes in the existence of a supreme being, and is not a member of the Communist Party nor any organization which advocates the overthrow of the United States government. Currently, either gender can become a member of an Aerie, however, only women can become a member of an Auxiliary. In recent history, numerous Aerie chapters have absorbed their Auxiliaries to form one unified chapter that allows all genders, to which the Grand Aerie and Grand Auxiliary responded with enacting a law that any Auxiliary members who wish to leave the women&#x27;s only chapter and join the Aerie, must be a non-member of the entire organization for one full year, which has discouraged countless members from doing so.

The FOE no longer uses secret passwords or &quot;roughhouse initiation&quot; rites. But, in 1979, it still had a ritual. The prospective member was asked to promise before God and on his honor, not to disclose the rituals of the Order to anyone outside of the FOE. The initiation took place in a lodge room furnished with an altar and a Bible and included religious phrases and prayers.

The FOE had an insurance program in its early years, but discontinued this in 1927. Instead it offered sick and death benefits for members who would pay higher fees. Therefore, the FOE now has two membership categories, beneficial and non-beneficial.

==Charitable giving==
&quot;People helping people&quot; is a statement that guides the charitable actions of the Fraternal Order of Eagles and has led the Eagles to donate more than $100 million annually. As part of the charitable philosophy, the Eagles give back 100 percent of the contributions received in the form of grants. All administrative costs are paid by the International Organization through membership dues.

In 1941 the FOE donated funds for the construction of a dormitory at Boys Town, Nebraska. Father Flanagan, the founder of Boys Town, was member of the order. A few years later the Order sponsored the creation of Eagle Hall at the Range for Boys at Sentinel Butte, North Dakota. The High Girl Ranch, near Midland, Texas has also received a dormitory.

The Memorial Foundation was founded in 1946, and regularly supports medical research projects. In the 1970s the FOE joined environmentalists in efforts to save the bald eagle from extinction. They also lent their efforts to help the golden eagle as well. In 1959 the FOE began construction on a retirement home for elderly members in Bradenton, Florida. Today this home is part of Eagle Village, where there are other facilities available to the elderly.

==Government Relations==
Since the time of the New Deal the FOE has promoted social legislation, particularly old age and mothers pensions, Social Security and workmen&#x27;s compensation. By 1980 it was advocating for seniors to work after age 65 and to return the Social Security system back to its original purpose.

===Mother&#x27;s Day===
Frank E. Hering, a Past Grand Worthy President of the Fraternal Order of Eagles in South Bend, Indiana, campaigned for &quot;a national day to honor our mothers&quot;, nearly 35 years after social activist Ann Jarvis first proposed a similar U.S. holiday. The idea of advocating for Mother&#x27;s Day came to Hering when he was a faculty member at the University of Notre Dame. Walking into the classroom of a fellow instructor, Hering found his colleague distributing penny postcards to students. Each student addressed his or her card and scribbled a message on it. Hering was informed the students could write anything, as long as it was addressed to the students&#x27; mothers.

Hering leveraged his connection with the Fraternal Organization of Eagles to organize its members in promoting the holiday, and in 1914, legislation in the U.S. Congress requested a presidential proclamation to designate the second Sunday in May as Mother&#x27;s Day. This date was encouraged by Anna Marie Jarvis, daughter of Ann Jarvis who continued her mother&#x27;s work in crusading for a U.S. memorial day for mothers. President Woodrow Wilson signed the proclamation and May 10, 1914, became the first official Mother&#x27;s Day.

In 1925, the &quot;Society of War Mothers&quot; invited Hering to participate in a special Mother&#x27;s Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. There, at the &quot;Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&quot;, before a large audience including many congressmen and senators, Hering was introduced as &quot;the Father of Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;. That was 11 years after President Woodrow Wilson by Proclamation officially made Mother&#x27;s Day the second Sunday in May.

Today the Eagles&#x27; work to acknowledge mothers on Mother&#x27;s Day is recognized by the Anna Jarvis Birthplace Museum – a museum honoring the daughter of Ann Jarvis. Grand Madam President Margaret Cox (2007–2008), was named &quot;2008 Mother of the Year&quot; by the Anna Jarvis Birthplace Museum in partnership with the International Mother&#x27;s Day Shrine in Grafton, WV. Cox was honored at the 100th anniversary of the holiday during the Mother&#x27;s Day Founder&#x27;s Festival, May 10 and 11, 2008.

===Ten Commandments===
In the 1940s, E.J. Ruegemer, a Minnesota juvenile court judge and member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, launched
a nationwide campaign to post copies of the Ten Commandments in juvenile courts across the country.
His stated goal was to provide a moral foundation for troubled youth.

In 1956, director Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s epic film &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; opened across the country. DeMille and Ruegemer drummed up publicity for the film by working together to erect granite monuments
of the Ten Commandments across the nation.

Although there is no official record of how many monuments were erected, estimates range from less than 100 to more than 2,000. The Fraternal Order of Eagles kept the project going long after the film opened, and some monuments didn&#x27;t get erected until up to 10 years later. Many monuments went up in public places like parks, city halls, and courthouses.
On August 30, 1961, the Fraternal Order of Eagles of Texas presented the State of Texas with a 6-foot-high monolith inscribed with the Ten Commandments, which in 2006 became the subject of a divisive and controversial legal dispute (Van Orden v. Perry) that reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The case was ruled 5–4 in favor of the defendant, the State of Texas, and the monument was allowed to remain on the grounds of the State Capitol.

<doc id="829663" wikidata="Q1283391" url="?curid=829663" title="Alice (1988 film)">
<text>Alice is a 1988 surrealist dark fantasy film written and directed by Jan Švankmajer. Its original Czech title is Něco z Alenky, which means &quot;Something from Alice&quot;. It is a loose adaptation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s first Alice book, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865), about a girl who chases a white rabbit into a bizarre fantasy land. Alice is played by Kristýna Kohoutová. The film combines live-action with stop-motion animation, and is distinguished by its dark production design.

For Švankmajer, a prolific director of short films for more than two decades, &quot;Alice&quot; became his first venture into feature-length filmmaking. The director had been disappointed by other adaptations of Carroll&#x27;s book, which interpret it as a fairy tale. His aim was instead to make the story play out like an amoral dream. The film won the feature film award at the 1989 Annecy International Animated Film Festival.

==Plot==
Alice is sitting by a brook with her sister, throwing rocks in the water. Later, she is in her sitting room, throwing rocks in a cup of tea. A creaking noise draws her attention to a taxidermic White Rabbit in a glass case. Alice hides beneath a writing desk while the Rabbit comes alive, dressing himself and retrieving a pair of scissors from a hidden drawer, which he uses to smash the case, freeing himself.

Alice chases the Rabbit into a writing desk on top of a hill; crawling into the drawer after him, she soon finds herself in a cellar. She falls backwards into a dustbin and finds herself in an elevator that takes her past all sorts of objects on shelves. The elevator stops and deposits her atop a pile of leaves. The leaves begin to stir on their own, revealing another desk in which Alice finds a tiny key. Alice uses the key to open a miniature door, through which she sees the Rabbit disappear into a painted garden; she herself is too large to fit through the door. She finds an unlabeled bottle of a dark, inky liquid. Drinking it transforms her into a small china doll in her likeness. She then finds a butter tart that causes her to grow large, again rendering her unable to fit through the door. Frustrated, Alice cries until the room floods with tears. The White Rabbit rows by, dropping a tray of tarts. Eating one returns Alice to her doll size and she is able to retrieve the key and chase the Rabbit.

Once through the door, Alice finds herself at the banks of a brook and encounters the White Rabbit, who mistakes her for his maid and commands her to fetch scissors from his house. Inside, she drinks from another ink bottle and returns to her true size, trapping her inside the now too-small house. The Rabbit and his animal companions try to force her out by launching a skull-headed lizard through the window. Alice kicks him away, causing him to burst and spill his sawdust innards. The angry animals imprison Alice inside an Alice-shaped doll shell, which they lock inside a storage room filled with specimen jars.

Alice breaks free of the doll shell and discovers a key inside a sardine can. She uses the key to escape the storage room, stepping into a hall of doors. Behind one of them, she meets a stocking-Caterpillar in a room swarming with sock-worms that bore holes in the floor. The Caterpillar tells her that eating one piece of his darning mushroom causes things to grow, while the other piece causes things to shrink. Alice follows the sound of a crying baby to a tiny dollhouse, which she enlarges by eating a piece of the mushroom. She discovers the Rabbit inside tending a piglet in baby&#x27;s clothes. The Rabbit escapes while Alice chases the piglet downstairs, where a mechanical tea party is being hosted by a wind-up March Hare and a marionette Hatter. The Rabbit flees to the attic and Alice follows.

Behind a curtain of clothes, Alice reaches the painted garden. The King and Queen of Hearts march into the garden with a troop of playing cards. The Queen commands the White Rabbit to behead two fencing Jacks, among others; he does so with his scissors. The Queen invites Alice to play croquet, but Alice storms off when the mallets and balls turn into chickens and hedgehogs. In a courtroom, she is put on trial for eating the Queen&#x27;s tarts. Alice tries to explain herself but the King commands her to follow a script. Annoyed, Alice starts eating the tarts and the Queen demands Alice&#x27;s head. Alice asks &quot;Which one?&quot;, and her head morphs into the heads of the other characters. The Queen demands &quot;all&quot; her heads be severed, and the Rabbit advances with his scissors.

Alice wakes in her sitting room. Around the room are the various household objects that populated her dream: playing cards, china dolls, marionettes, an inkwell, and socks in a sewing basket. The case that formerly contained the taxidermic rabbit is still broken and empty. Opening the hidden drawer in the case, she finds the White Rabbit&#x27;s scissors. Examining the scissors, Alice says to herself, &quot;He&#x27;s late, as usual. I think I&#x27;ll cut &quot;his&quot; head off.&quot;

==Cast==
*Kristýna Kohoutová as Alice. In addition to being a character within the film itself, Alice also serves as the narrator throughout its entirety, and all the other characters are voiced by her. After every line of dialogue, a close-up of Alice&#x27;s mouth is shown saying &quot;said (insert character&#x27;s name here)&quot;. For example, the Queen of Hearts would say &quot;now off with their heads&quot; in Alice&#x27;s voice, and Alice&#x27;s mouth is shown saying &quot;said the Queen of Hearts&quot;.
In Alice&#x27;s English version:
*Camilla Power as Alice&#x27;s voice

==Production==
Jan Švankmajer, who had been making short films since the mid-1960s, says he got the confidence to make a feature-length film after finishing the shorts &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; and &quot;Down to the Cellar&quot;. He described Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, a work which had followed him since he was a child, as &quot;one of the most important and amazing books produced by this civilisation.&quot; He argued that other film adaptations of the story had interpreted it as a fairy tale, but that Carroll had written it like a dream, and that was what he wanted to transmit: &quot;While a fairy tale has got an educational aspect – it works with the moral of the lifted forefinger (good overcomes evil), dream, as an expression of our unconscious, uncompromisingly pursues the realisation of our most secret wishes without considering rational and moral inhibitions, because it is driven by the principle of pleasure. My &quot;Alice&quot; is a realised dream.&quot; Despite the film&#x27;s heavy usage of stop motion, and unlike most other traditional stop motion films, the film does not utilize any miniature sets to portray its special effects.

==Release==
The film premiered in the United States, where it was released on 3 August 1988. It played at the 1989 Annecy International Animated Film Festival where it received the prize for best feature film. In Czechoslovakia it premiered on 1 November 1990. The English dubbed version features the voice of Camilla Power.

===Critical response===
In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James wrote that although Švankmajer &quot;strips away all sweetness and light, he does not violate Lewis Carroll&#x27;s story&quot;, and called &quot;Alice&quot; an &quot;extraordinary film [which] explores the story&#x27;s dark undercurrents&quot;. James described the animation as &quot;remarkably fluid&quot; and held forward the dynamics of the film, which contrasts visually captivating elements with superficiality: &quot;Mr. Švankmajer never lets us forget we are watching a film in which an actress plays Alice telling a story&quot;, although, &quot;with its extreme close-ups, its constant motion and its smooth animation, the film is so visually active that it distracts us from a heavy-handed fact – this is a world of symbols come alive.&quot; Upon the British home-media release in 2011, Philip Horne reviewed the film for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Horne called it &quot;an astonishing film&quot;, and wrote: &quot;This is no cleaned up version approved by preview audiences or committees of studio executives – my youthful fellow-spectator declared quite aptly at one point, &#x27;She&#x27;s rather a violent young girl, isn&#x27;t she?&#x27; – but its glorious proliferation of magical transformations works like a charm on anyone who values the imagination.&quot; The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has &quot;Alice&quot; with a &quot;Fresh&quot; rating of based on reviews.

===Home media===
An English dubbed version was released in the US on VHS in 1992 by First Run Features Home Video.

The film with original Czech audio and English subtitles was unavailable on home video until 2011 when the British Film Institute released the film on DVD and Blu-ray.

<text>Lügde is a town in the Lippe district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, with c. 9,800 inhabitants (2013).

The first written mention of Lügde appears in 784, in the annals of the Frankish Empire, when Charlemagne visited the village during the Saxon Wars. During these wars Charlemagne celebrated his first Christmas in Saxony in Lügde, and the site then became the location of the first church to be built in Saxony. The gothic church, dedicated to Saint Kilian, was rebuilt in the 12th century and still stands today. The church is known as the Kilians-Kirche.

In 2019 Lügde made national news as the site of a series of child rapes on a campground; investigators estimate 1,000 child rapes were committed over the course of 10 years.

<text>Adriana da Cunha Calcanhotto (born 3 October 1965) is a Brazilian singer-songwriter. Her melancholic songs are often categorized in the MPB genre. She began her professional career in 1984 and released her first studio album in 1990.

==Career==
Born from musician Carlos Calcanhotto (originally Calcagnotto) of Italian origin from Volpago del Montello, Veneto, and from a Brazilian dancer.
Adriana&#x27;s first album, called &quot;Enguiço&quot;, was released in 1990 and consisted mostly of covers of well known MPB (Brazilian pop) songs, part of the repertoire she used to perform as a singer in restaurants and bars in Porto Alegre. It included only one original composition, the title track. It spawned her first hit, a cover of Caetano Veloso&#x27;s &quot;Naquela Estação&quot;, which became successful thanks to it being included in the soundtrack of the successful 1990 telenovela &quot;Rainha da Sucata.&quot;

1992 saw the release of &quot;Senhas&quot;, which included the hits &quot;Mentiras&quot; and &quot;Esquadros&quot; and was followed by a successful national tour. In 1994, Adriana, sporting a new look (short black hair as opposed to the slightly longer bright blond haircut she&#x27;d had since the beginning of her career) released &quot;A Fábrica do Poema&quot;, considered by many to be her most poetic album. She collaborated with lyricists like Waly Salomão and António Cícero (brother and constant musical partner of fellow singer Marina Lima) and included the hits &quot;Metade&quot; and &quot;Inverno&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Maritmo&quot; (a combination of the words &quot;marítimo&quot; (maritime) and &quot;ritmo&quot; (rhythm)), a concept album intended as the first part of a trilogy having water as a main theme.

At the turn of the millennium, Adriana experienced the peak of her career with the release of the album &quot;Público&quot; in 2000. Her first live album/DVD, &quot;Público&quot; was recorded in a &quot;voz-e-violão&quot; (voice and guitar) style, meaning there was no band, only the singer playing her acoustic guitar, an instrument which has followed her through her entire career. The album included a cover of the staple torch song &quot;Devolva-me&quot;, made famous by the duo Leno &amp; Lilian back in the 1960s. This album was followed by her first greatest hits compilation, &quot;Perfil&quot; (the success of this album prompted her record company to make it a series, releasing compilations of the same title by such artists as Cássia Eller, Zélia Duncan and Djavan). Another album of new material wouldn&#x27;t be released until 2002, when the singer released &quot;Cantada&quot;. In the meantime, Adriana toured Europe and Japan (as she has done many times since).

After the release of that album, Adriana took on the persona of Adriana Partimpim, an alias the singer claims to have used as a child. Adriana Partimpim released her self-titled &quot;debut&quot; in 2004, an album of covers featuring essentially traditional children&#x27;s songs, but which also included familiar pop songs made to resemble children&#x27;s songs. Examples of such songs are the covers of Paula Toller&#x27;s &quot;Oito Anos&quot; (a song Toller wrote for her own son, Gabriel) and Claudinho &amp; Buchecha&#x27;s &quot;Fico Assim Sem Você&quot;, which became a hit on adult radios. A live CD/DVD combo of the show was also released the following year.

Her most recent album, &quot;Maré&quot;, was released in early 2008 and features a guest appearance by the singer&#x27;s personal friend, Marisa Monte as well as a cover of Marina Lima&#x27;s song &quot;Três&quot;. She toured Brazil to promote the record, as well as once again touring Europe, Japan and the United States. Adriana has chronicled her adventures on tour in the book &quot;Saga Lusa&quot; (Portuguese Saga), in which she shares her memoirs of the Portuguese leg of her most recent tour. The book was released on October 28 in Rio de Janeiro.

On October 23, 2009, Adriana performed in front of an adoring crowd at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada in a free performance presented by the Embassy of Brazil.

Since 2015, Calcanhotto had joined Universidade de Coimbra as a university ambassador, acting as visiting lecturer on song composition courses and as an artist-in-residence.

Her album &quot;Errante&quot; was chosen by the Associação Paulista de Críticos de Arte as one of the 50 best Brazilian albums of 2023.

== Personal life ==
From 2021 to 2022, she dated actress Maitê Proença.

<doc id="829697" wikidata="Q2165889" url="?curid=829697" title="Spinthariscope">
<text>A spinthariscope () is a device for observing individual nuclear disintegrations caused by the interaction of ionizing radiation with a phosphor (see radioluminescence) or scintillator.

==Invention==
The spinthariscope was invented by William Crookes in 1903. While observing the apparently uniform fluorescence on a zinc sulfide screen created by the radioactive emissions (mostly alpha radiation) of a sample of radium bromide, he spilled some of the sample, and, owing to its extreme rarity and cost, he was eager to find and recover it. Upon inspecting the zinc sulfide screen under a microscope, he noticed separate flashes of light created by individual alpha particle collisions with the screen. Crookes took his discovery a step further and invented a device specifically intended to view these scintillations. It consisted of a small screen coated with zinc sulfide affixed to the end of a tube, with a tiny amount of radium salt suspended a short distance from the screen and a lens on the other end of the tube for viewing the screen. Crookes named his device from () &quot;spark&quot;.

Crookes debuted the spinthariscope at a meeting of the Royal Society, London on 15 May 1903.

==Toy spinthariscopes==
Spinthariscopes were quickly replaced with more accurate and quantitative devices for measuring radiation in scientific experiments, but enjoyed a modest revival in the mid 20th century as children&#x27;s educational toys. In 1947, Kix cereal offered a Lone Ranger atomic bomb ring that contained a small one, in exchange for a box top and US$0.15 (). Spinthariscopes can still be bought today as instructional novelties, but they now use americium or thorium. Looking into a properly focused toy spinthariscope, one can see many flashes of light spread randomly across the screen. Almost all are circular, with a very bright pinpoint centre surrounded by a dimmer circle of emission.

==In museums==
The American History Museum of the Smithsonian has several spinthariscopes in its collections, and an article discussing them. However, none are currently on display.

<doc id="829701" wikidata="Q7097233" url="?curid=829701" title="Operation Lifesaver">
<text>Operation Lifesaver is the largest rail safety education organization in the United States. It was founded by the Union Pacific Railroad in the early 1970s.

==History==
In 1972, the Idaho State Highway Patrol, then-Governor Cecil Andrus and the Union Pacific Railroad mounted campaign to promote &quot;Stop, Look and Listen&quot; safety at highway-rail grade crossings. The initial teams spoke to civic groups, school groups, school bus and truck drivers. Idaho experienced a 43% reduction in fatalities that first year.

In 2022, Operation Lifesaver celebrated 50 years of rail safety education. 

Operation Lifesaver has trained instructors and authorized volunteer speakers who provide free rail safety education programs across the U.S. and abroad. They give free presentations to school groups, driver education classes, community members, professional drivers, law enforcement officers, and emergency responders. Their programs are co-sponsored by federal, state and local government agencies, highway safety organizations and America&#x27;s railroad systems.

==Campaigns==
In 2006, Operation Lifesaver requested that Disney edit a scene of the Pixar film &quot;Cars&quot; in which the character of Lightning McQueen races a train to a grade crossing while the crossing lights are flashing. Disney/Pixar removed the scene in question from theater showings, but the DVD release of the movie still included the scene. Disney/Pixar created a series of PSAs featuring Lightning McQueen to promote safe driving habits.

On October 14, 2016, Operation Lifesaver requested via a Facebook post that Hollister Co. remove advertisements from their website showing teenagers walking on railroad tracks. Hollister removed the advertisements five days later on October 19.

In September 2017, Operation Lifesaver spearheaded the observance of Rail Safety Week across the U.S. to raise awareness of the need for caution near railroad tracks and property. 

In 2018, Operation Lifesaver Canada, which had been holding rail safety week observances for years, aligned its Rail Safety Week dates to coincide with the U.S. observance.

In 2024, Operation Lifesaver, Inc. renamed its observance of Rail Safety Week to See Tracks? Think Train® Week (ST3Week for short) throughout the U.S. to better represent what the week-long observance is all about:

 - Preventing railroad crossing and trespass incidents 
 - Concentrating public attention on the need for rail safety education

==Criticism==
Operation Lifesaver has been criticized for its strong ties to the railroad industry and the group&#x27;s skew toward the railroad industry. The industry has reduced its support of the group’s efforts by providing fewer workers to help spread the group’s safety message. The group has also been criticized for not doing enough to support pedestrian railroad safety in the United States.

<text>Video Ezy was an Australian home video rental business that offered titles on VHS, DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray, as well as console video games, for rent. At its peak in the mid-2000s, Video Ezy had over 500 company-owned and franchised video rental shops in the country, and owned 40% of the Australian video rental market after taking over Blockbuster&#x27;s Australian operations. The company also expanded internationally into New Zealand and Asia.

In the late 2000s and 2010s the company saw significant store closures, and by 2020 the brand consisted solely of automated rental kiosks operating within Australia. In March 2021 Evolve Entertainment, the company managing Video Ezy&#x27;s rental kiosks, entered liquidation.

As with most video rental chains, the once dominant business&#x27;s fall is largely attributed to the rise of online streaming services.

== History ==
Video Ezy commenced trading in 1983, when Kevin Slater opened his first store in the Sydney suburb of Hurstville, renting out a small selection of VHS and Betamax format movies. In September 1984, Peter McLaughlin and Bill Coe opened the first franchised store at Miranda. Other stores to open in quick succession were in the Sydney suburbs of Bankstown, Liverpool and Chatswood. In the majority of these stores, Slater funded 50% of the capital required to open. By 1986, Video Ezy comprised 18 stores, and by August 1987, there were 34 stores located across New South Wales and Queensland. Expansion followed throughout other Australian states. By 1990, the brand had grown to 102 stores, and over 300 by 1996. In that same year the Malaysian Berjaya Group made a major investment in the company, obtaining a 60 percent stake in the business, with Video Ezy Chairman Robert Maidment owning the other 40 percent of the company. During that time Video Ezy was made a subsidiary of CarLovers, an Australian car wash business also owned by Berjaya. Berjaya Group eventually divested its stake in the company in 2002 for AUD$12.5 million, selling it to Australian private equity firm CHAMP Ventures.

In May 2000, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) charged Video Ezy with unlawfully increasing the rental price of new release movies in its corporate-owned stores in anticipation of the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax later that year. It was the first case of GST price exploitation to be investigated by the commission, and the company faced possible fines of up to AUD$10 million if found guilty. Video Ezy Chairman Robert Maidment refuted the allegations and vowed to fight the charges. The case was ultimately dropped in April 2001 after the company admitted to misleading customers, made an apology, and paid part of the ACCC&#x27;s legal costs.

In 2003, Video Ezy sold almost all its corporate-owned stores in Australia, leaving only 2 stores, Narellan and Rosehill, some 10 minutes away from its new head office at Rhodes (although in 2006 it would acquire additional corporate-owned stores). The company also commenced selling and renting Ezy Exclusive-branded TV series and movies on DVD such as &quot;Dinotopia&quot;, &quot;Kingpin&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;Taken&quot;, &quot;The Believer&quot; and other exclusive titles from Hallmark Entertainment and NBC. These titles were usually branded with Video Ezy&#x27;s logo and carried slightly different artwork to DVDs sold outside the Region 4 market. Ezy Exclusives were phased out in 2006. In 2004 Video Ezy introduced a subscription scheme called DVD Unlimited; for a monthly fee, Video Ezy customers could take home up to four movies at any one time and pay no late fees. The scheme was inspired by Netflix&#x27;s online DVD subscription service in the United States. The scheme was unrelated to the New Zealand venture of the same name.

In August 2005, business partners Paul Uniacke and Edward Nedelko, who between them owned 24 Video Ezy franchises in Victoria, purchased the shares held in Video Ezy Australasia by CHAMP Ventures, Perpetual Trustees and Ivany Investments to become majority shareholders in the company and replaced Robert Maidment as chairman. At that stage Video Ezy-branded outlets numbered 560 in Australia. The company established a training facility in 2006 to develop staff expertise. They had previously worked with a company called Rascals which promoted the use of Australian Workplace Agreements.

In March 2006, Paul Uniacke announced that the company had been working with digital media consultancy The Content Factory to develop a video on demand service with a planned launch the following year. The service would have used set-top boxes for delivering content and was also planned to eventually launch in Video Ezy&#x27;s international markets. Video Ezy and The Content Factory also trialled a service where customers could download movies at a store to a portable storage device, which could then be watched at home via a digital media player designed by Australian tech company Mobilesoft. Although both services did not move beyond limited market testing in Australia, the New Zealand franchisor of the company would launch a short-lived streaming service named Video Ezy on Demand in 2014.

In February 2007, Blockbuster, seeking to rationalise its international operations and concentrate on its home United States market, sold its entire Australian store network to Video Ezy Australasia. At the time, Blockbuster Australia comprised 370 outlets nationwide: 29 owned by the company and 341 owned by franchisees. Video Ezy had 518 Australian outlets, all of them being owned by franchisees, pushing the combined group&#x27;s market share to 40% of the country&#x27;s video rental sector. Video Ezy committed to the master franchise agreement with Blockbuster for 10 years operating the brand with the possibility of renewal for a further 10 years after that. As a consequence of the deal, the company changed its name from Video Ezy Australasia Pty Ltd to Franchise Entertainment Group.

In January 2009, Franchise Entertainment Group bought failed video retail chain EzyDVD from receivers Ferrier Hodgson for an estimated $10 million. The transaction included the EzyDVD brand and online business, and its 25-store franchise network in addition to stock, plant, equipment and the remaining 11 company-owned stores. FEG CEO Paul Uniacke said to the media after the deal, &quot;We don&#x27;t have video rental stores in high-traffic areas such as the major malls because you can&#x27;t rent a DVD and the next day just easily park your car and return to it. The EzyDVD stores are in all the major mall chains and this cements us well and truly in this market.&quot; Soon after, EzyDVD&#x27;s head office, warehouse and distribution facility in Torrensville closed. In October 2010, Uniacke and Nedelko arranged for the transfer of the Video Ezy Australia, Blockbuster Australia and EzyDVD online businesses from FEG to their other company Elan Media Partners, leaving FEG to manage the franchise relationships with individual Video Ezy and Blockbuster outlets and the remaining EzyDVD-branded stores. By October 2013, only three EzyDVD stores remained in Launceston, Browns Plains and Elizabeth. EzyDVD was later acquired by The Kingston Group in 2017; only its website and online store have remained operating as of 2021.

In May 2011, a new loyalty card branded as Flash Rewards was introduced by Video Ezy (superseding DVD Unlimited), offering customers who sign-up and pay a fee, discounts and extended services in all participating Video Ezy stores. This allowed customers to upgrade their basic rental membership, with Paul Uniacke adding, &quot;when someone joins Flash Rewards, they can then rent from any participating Video Ezy store and access their Flash benefits without the need to sign up with each store every time.&quot; In addition, Flash Rewards offered discounts from partner companies such as Donut King, Eagle Boys, AMF Bowling, Anytime Fitness, ACP Magazines, and 25% off cinema ticket prices at Village Cinemas, Event Cinemas/Greater Union/Birch Carroll &amp; Coyle, Hoyts, Reading Cinemas, Wallis Cinemas, Dendy, and Palace Cinemas. However, the deals involving outside partner companies ended in early 2013.

In June 2011, a select group of Video Ezy and Blockbuster franchises incorporated Metcash&#x27;s Lucky 7 convenience stores, stocking more than 500 different products including newspapers, bread, milk and various snacks. In October 2011, it was announced that Daryl McCormack, a former chief executive officer of Video Ezy and their largest franchisee, would partner his 15 stores with Franchised Food Company&#x27;s Cold Rock Ice Creamery to open smaller, Express outlets within stores becoming dual franchises. The first Video Ezy and Cold Rock Express outlet opened in Kew, Melbourne.

In November 2011, Video Ezy found itself embroiled in a social media backlash when it refused to end its long-term sponsorship with Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s networked radio program &quot;Take40 Australia&quot; after its co-host, Kyle Sandilands made sexist comments about a News Limited journalist on his 2Day FM breakfast program, &quot;The Kyle &amp; Jackie O Show&quot;. Even though the comments were made on another program with Video Ezy having the added complication of being a naming rights sponsor of &quot;Take40 Australia&quot;, complaints piled up on its Facebook page to such an extent that after a month the brand was forced to pull advertising from the show temporarily during the summer. Sandilands was removed as co-host of &quot;Take40 Australia&quot; during this period, and Video Ezy continued to sponsor the program.

===International expansion and decline===
Video Ezy opened its first international location in Auckland, New Zealand in 1988, with master licensor Video Ezy International Ltd established in 1991 to expand the brand worldwide. In January 1997, partnering with Berjaya Group, Video Ezy expanded into the Asian market with its first outlet in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In May 1998, Video Ezy Chairman Robert Maidment told the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; that the company was &quot;looking to make Video Ezy an international brand name&quot;, and had held discussions with potential partners in Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, Brazil, Mexico and the United Kingdom, with plans to also expand into Brunei and the Philippines. In March 1999 the company opened its first outlet in Bangkok, Thailand. The company aimed to open 100 stores in the country by the end of the year 2000, and 150 in Malaysia by 2003.

The first Indonesian Video Ezy outlet opened in March 2001. That same year the first Video Ezy outlet opened in Singapore within the Jelita Shopping Centre at Bukit Timah. The Singapore network consisted of a mixture of corporate-owned and franchised stores located in either outdoor shopping strips like Holland Village, residential towers such as International Plaza, or large shopping centres such as VivoCity. Unlike Australia, Video Ezy Singapore could operate in most shopping centres due to 7-day-week late night shopping hours and its population less reliant on private automobiles needing to park outside stores. 

In June 2005, Video Ezy opened its first outlet in the United Arab Emirates at the Ibn Battuta Mall in Dubai. The company planned to open 17 more stores throughout Dubai in the following 10 years. By August 2005, Video Ezy had 156 stores in New Zealand, 128 in Thailand, 135 in Indonesia, 19 in Singapore (24 in December 2005 and 28 in 2007), nine in Malaysia, one in the United Arab Emirates and one in Fiji.

In its Asian franchises, Video Ezy also offered Video CD and LaserDisc movie rentals to its customers due to the increased popularity of the formats there. However one of Video Ezy&#x27;s biggest challenges in doing business in Asia was the rampant video piracy in the region. This had particularly affected Video Ezy&#x27;s plans for expansion in Malaysia. In Indonesia, where consumers could buy pirated movies on Video CD for as low as USD50¢, Video Ezy tried to mitigate this by lowering their rental prices to match, with some success. Video piracy also negatively effected the business in Fiji, forcing the owner of the Fijian Video Ezy franchise to close his five remaining stores in 2012 after incurring losses of USD$170,000.

Between 2008 and 2011, Video Ezy Indonesia closed 51 of their stores, blaming the closures on the continuing wide availability of pirated movies on DVD and Video CD as well as the rise in popularity of Pay TV channels and internet downloads, leaving 105 outlets left in the country. From 2011 to January 2013, the Indonesian franchise had shut down a further 60 of their outlets. By mid-2014 Video Ezy had 90 stores left in New Zealand. In 2015, Video Ezy International (NZ), the New Zealand franchisor entered liquidation, forcing the Australian parent company to take over. The company eventually pulled out of New Zealand in 2018, with only 6 stores still operating at the time of closure. The company sold off its three remaining Singaporean outlets to local video rental chain Movie Magic in 2015.

===Rental kiosks===

In December 2011, Franchise Entertainment Group switched on its first Video Ezy Express DVD and Blu-ray rental kiosk after announcing their roll-out in May that year. FEG bought one thousand DVD kiosks through US company, NCR Corporation for AUD$20 million with Uniacke adding, &quot;we&#x27;re looking to get to 3,000 within three years. I&#x27;m looking to own the market within a two-year period.&quot; FEG established Evolve Entertainment to manage the rental kiosk side of the business. Video Ezy Express kiosks could be leased from Evolve by local Video Ezy and Blockbuster franchisees and located in high foot-traffic areas such as shopping centres and supermarkets. For consumers, prices to rent are much lower, and no membership cards are required with the initial rental fee and extended fees being charged direct to the consumer&#x27;s credit card.

Video Ezy Express initially competed in Australia and New Zealand with the 300 plus strong Hoyts Kiosk network. They also competed with approximately 100 RedRoom kiosks for the first month until Evolve acquired the entire seven-year-old business, taking out a significant competitor while adding capacity. In November 2017, Evolve acquired Hoyts Kiosk with all machines replaced with Express-branded kiosks. A small number of Blockbuster-branded rental kiosks also continued to operate.

Video Ezy&#x27;s kiosks initially operated under a hub and spoke distribution model, with a franchisee operating a store supported by several kiosks in surrounding areas. While the kiosk would feature new release movies, consumers looking for older titles would come into the store which had a much larger video library. As stores began to close, franchisees moved on to operate only kiosks.

At a March 2021 general meeting of the company, it was decided that Evolve Entertainment would be wound up and liquidators appointed.

==Marketing==
In 1993, the &quot;Get it first time, or get it free&quot; guarantee was launched. Video Ezy re-launched their guarantee under the &quot;Movie Guarantee&quot; umbrella in April 2007. This included a Rental Guarantee, a Price Guarantee and an Ex-Rental Guarantee.

Video Ezy promoted rent-only releases with the &quot;Rent It – The Only Way To Get It&quot; campaign. Another advertising campaign used by Video Ezy was &quot;Upsize Your Entertainment&quot;: when a consumer rents a specific title they have the opportunity to &quot;upsize&quot; by buying a specified similar title for only $4.95. For example, in April 2007, Video Ezy had &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; as the rental title and &quot;Paulie&quot; as the upsize title.

Slogans used by the company throughout the years include:
* &quot;In the Mood&quot; (1990s)
* &quot;Relax&quot; (1998–2000)
* &quot;Ezy does it&quot; (October 2003)
* &quot;There is More to See (2000–2003)
* &quot;The choice is Ezy&quot; (1990s)
* &quot;Get it first time, or get it free&quot;
* &quot;We have so many copies of our Rental Guarantee title, we guarantee you&#x27;ll rent it now, or rent it free&quot;
* &quot;Love Movies&quot; (2009)
* &quot;More to Love&quot;
* &quot;Rent it. Buy it.&quot; (Singapore)

Due to the franchise nature of Video Ezy stores, each store also ran their own promotions and set their own pricing.

Video Ezy were major sponsors of the Canberra Raiders between 1990 and 1992.

==Competitors and downfall==
In its home market of Australia, Video Ezy competed with other rental chains such as Blockbuster (before its Australian operations were sold to the company), Civic Video, Network Video, Video City, Movies 4U (also known as Top Video or Leading Edge Video) and many independently branded stores throughout the country. Video Ezy dominated the New South Wales market; however, in other Australian states like Queensland, it had a similar number of stores to its rival Civic Video, and in Tasmania, its chain of Video City outlets were more numerous and larger in floor space. In the area of video and gaming retail, Video Ezy competed primarily against retailers such as Kmart, Target, Myer, Big W, Sanity, JB Hi-Fi, EB Games and EzyDVD (before their acquisition by FEG), and online retailer Amazon. From 2003, local DVD rental-by-mail business Quickflix also emerged as a competitor.

However, the proliferation of high speed internet in the late 2000s and 2010s that saw consumers gravitate towards more convenient online entertainment in the form of legal services such as iTunes, or illegal BitTorrent movie downloads ultimately became the greatest challenge to Video Ezy&#x27;s established business model. The introduction and increasing take up of legal streaming services such as Netflix and Stan also became serious threats to the business, and is commonly thought to be largely responsible for the downfall of Video Ezy and the Australian video rental industry as a whole. In November 2013, SmartCompany compared Australian Bureau of Statistics figures from financial year 1999–2000, which stated there were 1166 individual video hire businesses operating within Australia, to a 2013 IBISWorld study finding that just 255 DVD rental businesses were still operating in the country (a drop of almost 80%). The same study also found that the overall industry had declined at an annual rate of 14.8% over the five years to 2013. In addition to the previously noted online competition and threats to video rental businesses, SmartCompany also blamed recent developments from Pay TV and free-to-air television, which at the time had both radically increased their channel selections, as well as the reduced cost of DVD and Blu-ray discs, which saw the average 2013 price of a DVD settle at $16 in Australia, compared to $20 in the early-2000s, which acted as a double-edged sword for the industry, boosting the numbers of DVD sales, but also turning renters into buyers. Increasingly higher rent and wages also impacted the viability of video rental businesses to continue operating, as did continuing franchise fees. The Global Financial Crisis also had an impact on consumer spending.

These impacts on the video rental industry were reflected in Video Ezy and Blockbuster franchises closing 270 stores across Australia in the four years to August 2011. By February 2016 only seven stores were left operating in South Australia, while over 50 Western Australian Video Ezy stores were reduced to a single surviving franchise by December 2018. This also lead to Australian regional centres such as Lithgow and Berri losing their only full scale video libraries when their Video Ezy and Blockbuster franchises shut down. In the face of decreased business some franchisees tried diversifying their stores, such as selling film and pop culture collectables in addition to video rental or subletting floorspace in their stores to other small businesses. Other stores, unable to continue as Video Ezy franchises, rebranded to rival video rental affiliations such as Network Video or went independent. 2018 and 2019 saw the last few remaining Video Ezy stores close down. The last Australian Blockbuster store, in Morley, Western Australia, would close in March 2019. This left Video Ezy Express and Blockbuster rental kiosks as the only side of the business to remain operating.

In March 2013, Franchise Entertainment Group&#x27;s CEO, Paul Uniacke told &quot;Sunshine Coast Daily&quot; in response to a local Maroochydore outlet closing that, &quot;I&#x27;m not happy that Maroochydore has gone. It&#x27;s not something we like to see, absolutely there is a human cost to what&#x27;s happening here.&quot; He went on to add, &quot;the worst thing that happens in a rationalisation is losing stores and losing good people. We&#x27;ve been up on the Coast with Blockbuster for a number of years and with Video Ezy for about 20 years.&quot; Uniacke stated that he believed Video Ezy Express rental kiosks would ultimately fill the void left by closed stores. He asserted that &quot;you will see us back in a short space of time. We don&#x27;t want to leave that territory without the brand too long, we want to stay strong.&quot; He also added that franchisees were &quot;lined up out the door to run kiosks in there, so you will see Blockbuster, or maybe Video Ezy kiosks flowing through there&quot;, but in the same interview he admitted, &quot;absolutely we will have less stores, but I don&#x27;t want to do away with them because they form a valuable part of the business.&quot; In February 2016 Uniacke blamed high rents and wages as the main factor behind store closures, and stated that he believed the increasing popularity of online streaming did not have a major impact on the business, highlighting that at the time Video Ezy&#x27;s stores and kiosks offered newer release movies that were available on disc months before they appeared on online services. He also asserted that &quot;the business model for rental stores can be, and still is, viable under certain circumstances.&quot; Ultimately, the few rental stores that have hung on the longest have done so through diversification, downsizing, and catering for older customers unwilling or unable to go online, or film buffs looking for more obscure titles not available on streaming services or with poor internet connections.

Although Video Ezy&#x27;s rental kiosks had extended the life of the brand beyond store closures, they were still ultimately affected by a declining customer base as well as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a lack of new, high-profile titles from being available after a number of blockbuster films had their original 2020 theatrical release dates (and subsequent DVD and Blu-ray releases) delayed into the following year.

<text>Vladimir Sergeyevich Solovyov (; – ) was a Russian philosopher, theologian, poet, pamphleteer, and literary critic, who played a significant role in the development of Russian philosophy and poetry at the end of the 19th century and in the spiritual renaissance of the early 20th century.

==Life and work==

Vladimir Solovyov was born in Moscow; the second son of the historian Sergey Mikhaylovich Solovyov (1820–1879); his elder brother Vsevolod (1849-1903), became a historical novelist, and his younger sister, Polyxena (1867-1924), became a poet. Vladimir Solovyov&#x27;s mother Polyxena Vladimirovna (née Romanova, d. 1909) belonged to a family of Polish origin and among her ancestors was the philosopher Gregory Skovoroda (1722–1794).

In his teens, he renounced Eastern Orthodoxy for nihilism, but later his disapproval of positivism saw him begin to express some views that were in line with those of the Orthodox Church. From 1869 to 1873 Solovyov studied at the Imperial Moscow University, where his philosophy professor was Pamfil Yurkevich (1826-1874).

In his 1874 work &quot;The Crisis of Western Philosophy: Against the Positivists&quot; (, Solovyov discredited the positivists&#x27; rejection of Aristotle&#x27;s essentialism, or philosophical realism. In &quot;Against the Positivists&quot; he took the position of intuitive noetic comprehension, or insight. He saw consciousness as integral (see the Russian term &quot;sobornost&quot;) and requiring both phenomenon (validated by dianoia) and noumenon validated intuitively. Positivism, according to Solovyov, validates only the phenomenon of an object, denying the intuitive reality that people experience as part of their consciousness. As Solovyov&#x27;s basic philosophy rests on the idea that the essence of an object (see essentialism) can be validated only by intuition and that consciousness as a single organic whole is done in part by reason or logic but in completeness by (non-dualist) intuition. Solovyov was partially attempting to reconcile the dualism (subject-object) found in German idealism.
In 1877, Solovyov moved to Saint Petersburg, where he became a friend and confidant of the writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821–1881). In opposition to his friend, Solovyov was sympathetic to the Roman Catholic Church. He favoured the healing of the schism (ecumenism, &quot;sobornost&quot;) between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches. It is clear from Solovyov&#x27;s work that he accepted papal primacy over the Universal Church, but there is not enough evidence, , to support the claim that he ever officially embraced Roman Catholicism.
As an active member of Society for the Promotion of Culture Among the Jews of Russia, he spoke Hebrew and struggled to reconcile Judaism and Christianity. Politically, he became renowned as the leading defender of Jewish civil rights in tsarist Russia in the 1880s. Solovyov also advocated for his cause internationally and published a letter in &quot;The London Times&quot; pleading for international support for his struggle. The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; describes him as &quot;a friend of the Jews&quot; and states that &quot;Even on his death-bed he is said to have prayed for the Jewish people&quot;.

Solovyov&#x27;s attempts to chart a course of civilization&#x27;s progress toward an East-West Christian ecumenism developed an increasing bias against Asian cultures—which he had initially studied with great interest. He dismissed the Buddhist concept of Nirvana as a pessimistic nihilistic &quot;nothingness&quot;, antithetical to salvation and no better than Gnostic dualism. Solovyov spent his final years obsessed with fear of the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, warning that soon the Asian peoples, especially the Chinese, would invade and destroy Russia.

Solovyov further elaborated this theme in his apocalyptic short-story &quot;Tale of the Antichrist&quot; (published in the &quot;Nedelya&quot; newspaper on 27 February 1900), in which China and Japan join forces to conquer Russia. His 1894 poem &quot;Pan-Mongolism&quot;, whose opening lines serve as epigraph to the story, was widely seen as predicting the coming Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.

Solovyov never married or had children, but he pursued idealized relationships as immortalized in his spiritual love-poetry, including with two women named Sophia. He rebuffed the advances of the Christian mystic Anna Nikolayevna Schmidt, who claimed to be his divine partner. In his later years, Solovyov became a vegetarian, but ate fish occasionally. He often lived alone for months without a servant and would work into the night.

==Influence==
It is widely held that Solovyov was one of the sources for Dostoevsky&#x27;s characters Alyosha Karamazov and Ivan Karamazov in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;. In Janko Lavrin&#x27;s opinion, Solovyov has not left a single work which can be considered an epoch-making contribution to philosophy as such. And yet his writings have proved one of the most stimulating influences to the religious-philosophic thought of his country. Solovyov&#x27;s influence can also be seen in the writings of the Symbolist and Neo-Idealist writers of the later Russian Soviet era. His book &quot;The &quot; can be seen as one of the philosophical sources of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; (1889). It was also the work in which he introduced the concept of &#x27;syzygy&#x27;, to denote &#x27;close union&#x27;.

==Sophiology==
Solovyov synthesized a philosophy based on Hellenistic philosophy (see Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus) and early Christian tradition with Buddhist and Hebrew Kabbalistic elements (Philo of Alexandria). He also studied Gnosticism and the works of the Gnostic Valentinus. His religious philosophy was syncretic and fused philosophical elements of various religious traditions with Orthodox Christianity and his own experience of Sophia.

Solovyov described his encounters with the entity Sophia in his works, such as &quot;Three Encounters&quot; and &quot;Lectures on Godmanhood&quot;. His fusion was driven by the desire to reconcile and/or unite with Orthodox Christianity the various traditions by the Russian Slavophiles&#x27; concept of sobornost. His Russian religious philosophy had a very strong impact on the Russian Symbolist art and poetry movements of the Silver Age and his written arguments in favor of the reunion of the Russian Orthodox Church with the Holy See played an instrumental role in the formation of the Russian Greek Catholic Church. His teachings on Sophia, conceived as the merciful unifying feminine wisdom of God comparable to the Hebrew Shekinah or various goddess traditions, have been deemed a heresy by Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and as unsound and unorthodox by the Patriarchate of Moscow. This condemnation, however, was not agreed upon by other jurisdictions of the Orthodox church and was directed specifically against Sergius Bulgakov who continued to be defended by his own hierarch Metropolitan Evlogy until his death.

In his 2005 forward to Solovyov’s &quot;Justification of the Good&quot;, the Orthodox Christian theologian David Bentley Hart wrote a defense of Sophiology including a specific defense of Solovyov&#x27;s later thought:

==Sobornost==
Solovyov sought to create a philosophy that could through his system of logic or reason reconcile all bodies of knowledge or disciplines of thought, and fuse all conflicting concepts into a single system. The central component of this complete philosophic reconciliation was the Russian Slavophile concept of &quot;sobornost&quot; (organic or spontaneous order through integration, which is related to the Russian word for &#x27;catholic&#x27;). Solovyov sought to find and validate common ground, or where conflicts found common ground, and, by focusing on this common ground, to establish absolute unity and/or integral fusion of opposing ideas and/or peoples.

==Death==
Intense mental work shattered Solovyov&#x27;s health. He died at the Moscow estate of Nikolai Petrovitch Troubetzkoy, where a relative of the latter, Sergei Nikolaevich Trubetskoy, was living.

By 1900, Solovyov was apparently a homeless pauper. He left his brother, Mikhail Sergeevich, and several colleagues to defend and promote his intellectual legacy. He is buried at Novodevichy Convent.

<text>Kit&#x27;s Coty House or Kit&#x27;s Coty is a chambered long barrow near the village of Aylesford in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed &quot;circa&quot; 4000 BCE, during the Early Neolithic period of British prehistory, today it survives in a ruined state.

Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Kit&#x27;s Coty House belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the River Medway, now known as the Medway Megaliths. Of these, it lies near to both Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House and the Coffin Stone on the eastern side of the river. Three further surviving long barrows, Addington Long Barrow, Chestnuts Long Barrow, and Coldrum Long Barrow, are located west of the Medway.

They were among the first ancient British remains to be protected by the state, on the advice of General Augustus Pitt-Rivers, the first Inspector of Ancient Monuments. The site is now under the ownership of non-departmental public body English Heritage, and is open to visitors all year round.

Kit&#x27;s Coty can be reached on foot along a track that appears at the junction where the Pilgrim&#x27;s Way and Rochester Road meet.
The chamber is encircled by iron railings. It lies approximately 2 kilometres north of another of the Medway Megaliths, Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House.

The name &quot;Kits Coty&quot; allegedly means &quot;Tomb in the Forest&quot; according to signs at the site, possibly related to the Ancient British &quot;*kaitom&quot;, later &quot;*keiton&quot;, meaning &quot;forest&quot;. The site is the namesake of Kitscoty, a village in Alberta, Canada.
The inclusion of the term &quot;House&quot; in the site&#x27;s name has confused some visitors, who have gone to the site expecting a built dwelling.

==Context==
The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.

Britain was largely forested in this period; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from the vicinity of the White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the River Medway, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.

===Medway Megaliths===

Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These structures included chambered long barrows, rectangular or oval earthen tumuli which had a chamber built into one end. Some of these chambers were constructed out of timber, although others were built using large stones, now known as &quot;megaliths&quot;. These long barrows often served as tombs, housing the physical remains of the dead within their chamber. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. These chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from southeastern Spain up to southern Sweden, taking in most of the British Isles; the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. Although there are stone buildings—like Göbekli Tepe in modern Turkey—which predate them, the chambered long barrows constitute humanity&#x27;s first widespread tradition of construction using stone.

Although now all in a ruinous state and not retaining their original appearance, at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain. Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the North Downs, they constitute the most southeasterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles, and the only megalithic group in eastern England. The archaeologists Brian Philp and Mike Dutto deemed the Medway Megaliths to be &quot;some of the most interesting and well known&quot; archaeological sites in Kent, while the archaeologist Paul Ashbee described them as &quot;the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern England&quot;.

The Medway Megaliths can be divided into two separate clusters: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between . The western group includes Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the Chestnuts Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, the Coffin Stone, and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs, most notably the White Horse Stone. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.

The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. They had internal heights of up to , making them taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected.

These common architectural features among the Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles. Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows—such as the Cotswold-Severn group in south-western Britain—there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum&#x27;s rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow&#x27;s facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit&#x27;s Coty. These variations might have been caused by the tombs being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would be composite structures.

The builders of these monuments were probably influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines they were aware of. Whether those people had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known. Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs, the archaeologist Stuart Piggott thought that the plan behind the Medway Megaliths had originated in the area around the Low Countries; conversely, Glyn Daniel thought their design derived from Scandinavia, John H. Evans thought Germany, and Ronald F. Jessup suggested an influence from the Cotswold-Severn group. Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe, and emphasised that the Medway Megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe. He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was &quot;impossible to indicate&quot; with the available evidence.

==Design and construction==

The surviving part of the monument represents three stones covered by a capstone.
The H-shaped entrance to the tomb survives. It is made of sarsen (a fine-grained, crystalline sandstone) and consists of three orthostats supporting a horizontal capstone. The archaeologist Timothy Champion suggested that these stones &quot;give some idea of the scale of the sculpture&quot;. The front part of the chamber, as well as a possible façade, are now gone.

The mound and flanking ditches have largely been ploughed flat but remain visible from aerial photographs.
A 1981 survey found the mound to be &quot;circa&quot; 70 metres long and 1 metre high. Champion suggested that in total, the long-barrow would have been about 80m long. As a result of chalk rubble in the plough soul, it estimated that it had once been c.11 to 15 metres wide. An area of dark soil suggested that there had been a wide ditch on the southern side.

Ashbee noted that various worn pottery sherds had been found in the soil on the barrow. In 1897, John Evans recounted as having found a leaf-shaped arrowhead—likely of Neolithic date—near to the site.

===The General&#x27;s Tombstone===

At the western end of the monument was a megalith known as &quot;the General&#x27;s Tombstone&quot;, which was destroyed in 1867. This may once have been part of the long barrow&#x27;s structure.

==Damage and dilapidation==

Ashbee suggested that when the barrow was being slighted, the kerbstones might have been dragged away or buried under the ditches.

==Folklore, folk tradition, and modern Paganism==

In 1722, the antiquarian Hercules Ayleway noted—in a letter written to his friend, the fellow antiquarian William Stukeley—a local belief that the Lower Kit&#x27;s Coty House and Kit&#x27;s Coty House were erected in memory of two contending kings of Kent who died in battle.

In 1946, Evans recorded a local folk tale that held that the chamber at Kit&#x27;s Coty House was erected by three witches who lived on Blue Bell Hill. According to this story, a fourth witch helped them put the capstone on.

Several modern Pagan religions are practised at the Medway Megaliths, the most publicly visible of which is Druidry. Research conducted among these Druids in 2014 revealed that some Druidic ceremonial activity had taken place at Kit&#x27;s Coty.

==Antiquarian and archaeological investigation==
Kit&#x27;s Coty House was briefly mentioned in John Twyne&#x27;s &quot;De Rebus Albionicis&quot; (written c.1550, but not published until 1590), and in William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; (1586): Camden reported the popular tradition that it was the tomb of the 5th-century British prince Catigern, supposedly killed at the Battle of Aylesford in 455.

In 1590, a group of antiquaries visited the site. One of them, John Stow, wrote:
Stow published a version of this report in his &quot;Annals&quot; in 1592; while another of the group, William Lambarde, published his own description in the 1596 edition of his &quot;Perambulation of Kent&quot;, drawing a comparison with Stonehenge. Camden described the monument in greater detail from personal observation in the expanded 1610 English translation of &quot;Britannia&quot;:

In 1659, Thomas Philipot wrote about the site, again describing it as the tomb of Catigern.

The antiquarian John Aubrey made mention of the monument in his unpublished manuscript on British archaeological sites, the &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot;. There he included a drawing of the site produced by the classical scholar Thomas Gale. Aubrey then directly cited Philipot&#x27;s earlier work. There is no direct evidence that Aubrey visited the site but Ashbee thought it &quot;inconceivable that he did not&quot; given that he made frequent visits to Kent, using a road which would have taken him very close to Kit&#x27;s Coty House.

William Stukeley visited the site in 1722 and was able to sketch the site whilst it was still largely intact. Before this, Samuel Pepys also saw it and wrote:

Stukeley included four engravings of Kit&#x27;s Coty House in his two volumes of &quot;Itinerarium Curiosum&quot;. A 1722 print of the site showed the chamber, mound, and the General&#x27;s Tombstone.

In c.1783, James Douglas set one of his workmen to dig on the western side of the monument, and produced a watercolour painting illustrating the scene.

In 1880, the archaeologist Flinders Petrie included the stones at Addington in his list of Kentish earthworks. In 1893, the antiquarian George Payne mentioned the monument in his &quot;Collectanea Cantiana&quot;, describing it as a &quot;fallen cromlech&quot; and noting that there were various other megaliths scattered in the vicinity, suggesting that these were part of the monument of another like it, since destroyed.

In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed Kit&#x27;s Coty House alongside the other Medway Megaliths and reprinted one of Stukeley&#x27;s engravings of it.

The author George Orwell visited the site on 21 August 1938, as detailed in his domestic diary of that date. He describes it as &quot;a druidical altar or something of the kind. ... The stones are on top of a high hill &amp; it appears they belong to quite another part of the country.&quot; The stones are actually well down the slope of Blue Bell Hill, 1.32 km to the north.

In January 1981, Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit carried out a survey of the site.

===Management by English Heritage===

Ashbee suggested that Kit&#x27;s Coty House was &quot;the best known&quot; of the Medway Megaliths, while Champion thought it &quot;perhaps the best-known monument in Kent&quot;.
In 2005, Philp and Dutto referred to Kits Coty as an &quot;important monument&quot; that was &quot;amongst the best known in Britain&quot;.

<doc id="829780" wikidata="Q939736" url="?curid=829780" title="Millennium Actress">
<text>is a 2001 Japanese animated drama film co-written and directed by Satoshi Kon and produced by Madhouse. Loosely based on the lives of actresses Setsuko Hara and Hideko Takamine, it tells the story of two documentary filmmakers investigating the life of a retired acting legend. As she tells them the story of her life, the borderline between cinema and reality gradually becomes blurred.

==Plot==

Chiyoko Fujiwara, a renowned former actress and prominent star for film company Ginei, accepts a request for a retrospective interview amidst the demolition of the company&#x27;s obsolete studio, her first interview in thirty years after her sudden retirement from the entertainment industry. Documentarian Genya Tachibana, a fan of Chiyoko, visits her house with his cameraman Kyoji Ida. Genya gives Chiyoko a small box containing an old-fashioned key. She remarks that the key &quot;opens the most important thing&quot; and begins reflecting on her life.

Chiyoko was born during the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which took the life of her father. As a schoolgirl, she is scouted by Ginei&#x27;s general manager to appear in a government-sponsored film to inspire troops serving in the Second Sino-Japanese War. While her mother opposes, intending for Chiyoko to inherit the family&#x27;s confectionery store, Chiyoko remains uncertain. She meets a political dissident painter being pursued by police and hides him in her home&#x27;s storehouse. The next day, he leaves for Manchuria to join his allies, leaving Chiyoko the key to his box of art supplies. Chiyoko fails to catch him before his train departs, but vows to reunite with him. Genya tearfully recognizes this as a scene from one of Chiyoko&#x27;s films; from this point forward, Chiyoko&#x27;s memories and films become intertwined.

Recalling that Ginei&#x27;s film is set in Manchuria, Chiyoko becomes an actress and travels there in the hopes of reuniting with the artist. She meets the general manager&#x27;s nephew, aspiring director Junichi Ōtaki, and Ginei&#x27;s lead actress, Eiko Shimao. During filming, Chiyoko is led to northern Manchuria by a fortuneteller bribed by Eiko. Her train is attacked by bandits before the setting shifts to a burning Sengoku period castle - Chiyoko, in the role of a princess, is tricked by an old wraith into drinking a cursed tea that will cause her to &quot;burn forever in the flames of eternal love&quot;. In Chiyoko&#x27;s continuing search for the artist, the setting and Chiyoko&#x27;s role changes in quick succession, ranging from a courtesan in a brothel at the end of the Edo period to a schoolgirl in the Taishō era. Her family&#x27;s store is destroyed in an air raid, but on a surviving wall, she finds a portrait of her painted by the artist and a promise of their reunion.

After World War II, Chiyoko&#x27;s career flourishes, but she never forgets the artist. One day during filming, Eiko secretly steals the key. When asked by the film crew about the significance of the key, Chiyoko despondently realizes that she can no longer remember the artist&#x27;s face, and resigns herself to a married life with Junichi. She eventually finds the key hidden in their home and confronts Junichi about it; Junichi, having been aware of Eiko&#x27;s role in the fortuneteller incident, coerced her into stealing the key on his behalf in order to secure Chiyoko&#x27;s hand in marriage. Eiko admits to being motivated by jealousy toward Chiyoko&#x27;s youth and innocence. An old, scarred man who had pursued the artist as a military policeman approaches Chiyoko on a journey of atonement and hands her a letter from the artist. Chiyoko boards an express train to the artist&#x27;s hometown in Hokkaido, but the conclusion of her trek proves fruitless.

During production of Chiyoko&#x27;s final film, an earthquake causes the set to collapse. A young Genya, working as an assistant at the time, rescues her. Seeing the wraith in her prop helmet, Chiyoko flees the set and retires from acting. In the present day, Chiyoko, once more seeing the wraith in her reflection, acknowledges that she is no longer the girl the artist had met. Upon the end of the interview, another earthquake strikes, upsetting Chiyoko&#x27;s fragile health. En route to the hospital, Genya confides to Kyoji that after Chiyoko left for Hokkaido, the policeman confessed to him that he tortured the artist to death. On her deathbed, Chiyoko thanks Genya for rekindling her memories of the artist and reviving the young girl she was before. She concludes that it does not matter if she sees the artist again or not, because what she really loved was the search for him.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Millennium Actress&quot; is the second film directed by Satoshi Kon and his first original work, after the highly acclaimed &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;.
It was planned by Masao Maruyama and produced by Taro Maki. The film is partly based on the life of Japanese actress Setsuko Hara, although it was produced and released more than a decade prior to her death.

Following the release of &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;, Kon considered adapting the Yasutaka Tsutsui novel &quot;Paprika&quot; (1993) into his next film. 
However, these plans were stalled when the distribution company for &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;, Rex Entertainment, went bankrupt.

The project for &quot;Millennium Actress&quot; came from the words &quot;Let&#x27;s make a movie that looks like a trompe l&#x27;oeil&quot; by Taro Maki, who decided to produce Kon&#x27;s film because he thought his previous work was amazing.
The script writing began with a sentence that Kon came up with: &quot;An old woman who was once touted as a great actress is supposed to be recounting her life story, but her memories get confused and the various roles she played in the past begin to blend into it, creating a tumultuous story.&quot;
The structure of the story was decided at the rough plot stage when Kon fleshed out this sentence, and the last scene remained intact in the finished film.
He then worked with the scenario writer, Sadayuki Murai, and the producer to develop the episodes and detailed character settings to be included in the plot.

Unlike the previous film, which he was hired to direct, this one was his original project, so he was able to express his own opinions, and decided to put more emphasis on the sound, especially the music, and asked Susumu Hirasawa, who had been adored for a long time, to compose the music.
There were about 250 staff members in total, and the production period was about two years. The 20 or so main staff members were almost the same as in the previous work, with only the animation director changing.
In the previous work, the character design was done by Hisashi Eguchi and the animation director by Hideki Hamasu, but in this work, both were done by Takeshi Honda.
The reason for this is that the animation director is a very important and burdensome position, and the animators who have the skills and abilities that Kon would like to work with are usually those prefer to draw key frames rather than the animation director, making it difficult to ask them to continue their work.
For the character designs, Honda was chosen because he is someone who draws elegant pictures that can appeal to those outside of the animation community and is genuinely talented in the animation industry, in order to make sure that the movie would have reach audiences both within and outside the spectrum of animation fandom.
Some of the character designs were done by Kon himself, and all the posters of Chiyoko in the movie were also drawn by Kon.

This is Kon&#x27;s last movie to utilize cel animation, as his later works were produced using digital ink-and-paint among other digital methods. And most of the scenes are drawn based on Kon&#x27;s layout.

The budget was initially 130 million yen, and the final budget was around 100 million and a few tens of millions of yen, one of the lowest production costs for an animated film in Japan.

==Release==
The film was released in North America on September 12, 2003, distributed by DreamWorks&#x27; arthouse and foreign movie publishing company Go Fish Pictures, with a total of six screens.

Theatrical anime distribution company Eleven Arts acquired the North American rights and re-released the film theatrically in its original Japanese language version on August 13, 2019, and in an all-new English dubbed version on August 19, 2019.

===Box office===
Commercially, the film performed modestly on its US release earning $18,732 on its opening weekend and $37,285 during its full three-week release. The film was shown almost exclusively in New York and Los Angeles and received a minimal advertising campaign from Go Fish Pictures, a division of DreamWorks SKG.
Although the scale of the release was not large, the merit of the theatrical release was not only in the box-office revenue, but also in the fact that critics would view the film and publish reviews and criticisms in general newspapers, magazines and websites, which would raise awareness of the work and reach an audience outside of the hardcore anime fandom.

== Themes ==
&quot;Millennium Actress&quot; began with a request to make a trompe l&#x27;oeil movie like the previous &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;. However, it was only a film technique, not a film theme. Both works share the same methodology of &quot;blurring the boundary between fiction and reality,&quot; and both works are like two sides of the same coin for Kon.
The previous film focused on the negative side of human nature, while this film focuses on the positive side.
The previous film depicted the gradual blurring of the boundary between fiction and reality, while this film seamlessly connects fiction and reality from the beginning, and shows the characters freely moving back and forth between fiction and reality.
The technique of mixing fiction and reality was used to express the protagonist&#x27;s uneasy inner world in the previous film, and used in this film for a fun adventure, turning the film from psycho-horror and suspense to a tricky and humorous entertainment.

In the previous film, he tried to confuse the audience by depicting the inner turmoil and chaos of the main character through the mixture of fiction and reality, but in this film, his intention is not to confuse the audience, but to let the audience enjoy the mixture of fiction and reality itself.
He aimed to create a film a kind of The Adventures of Old Lady Blowing Smoke by mixing fiction and reality to the point where it becomes meaningless to distinguish between them.

There are various kinds of trompe l&#x27;oeil paintings, but one example that Kon gave to the staff was Utagawa Kuniyoshi&#x27;s ukiyoe &quot;At first glance he looks very fierce, but he is actually a kind person&quot; (). At first glance, it appears to be the face of a single person, but upon closer inspection, one can see that many people are intertwined, and he likened this characteristic of the painting, &quot;non-faces coming together to form a face,&quot; to the concept of this work, &quot;lies piling up to reveal the truth.

The film has a complex structure in which the staff members who visit the legendary actress for an interview experience her life story in a fictional world where the actress&#x27; past and the movies she appeared in intersect, making the story a mixture of reality and fiction as well as a tribute to various classic movies.
The main character is modeled on Setsuko Hara and Hideko Takamine, and the movies that appear in the film include a period piece in the style of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;, a film by Yasujiro Ozu, a chanbara (sword fighting) story featuring &quot;Kurama Tengu&quot;, a monster story that borrows images from &quot;Godzilla&quot;, and a science fiction story.

The story follows the personal story of Chiyoko Fujiwara, an elderly actress, and gradually becomes a muddle of reality, dreams, and movies. Each episode repeats a series of scenes of &quot;chasing, running, and falling&quot; in different situations and times. Her life, the sum of all of these, also repeats various setbacks and revivals while continuing to chase after Man with Key, who is almost an illusion.
This work is basically a repetition of the same episode, a cyclical story like Boléro in music.
Kon said that this idea of a fractal structure owes a lot to the music of Susumu Hirasawa.
The story also reflects the hospitalization Kon experienced after his debut as a manga artist, and the frustration and struggle he felt at that time: &quot;Everything is ruined, but can I still make a comeback?&quot;
This film is famous for making many audiences feel betrayed by Chiyoko&#x27;s last line. Kon said that the process of human growth is a repetition of death and rebirth, in which the values we have accumulated up to that point become unacceptable in a new phase, and even if we rebuild them once they are broken, they become unacceptable again in a new phase, and he involved the audience in the fractal of the film by asking them whether they would be able to get up and continue to &quot;chase, run, and fall&quot; even after they &quot;fell&quot; at the end of the film.

Kon said, &quot;There is no single solution - that&#x27;s what I want most for my work to be. I want people to see it in many different ways.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;Millennium Actress&quot; was favorably received by critics, gaining a 93% &quot;fresh&quot; rating at Rotten Tomatoes. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Kenneth Turan said of the film &quot;as a rumination on the place movies have in our personal and collective subconscious, &quot;Millennium Actress&quot; fascinatingly goes where films have not often gone before&quot;. Kevin M. Williams of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the movie 4 stars and put his feelings for the film this way: &quot;A piece of cinematic art. It&#x27;s modern day Japanese animation at its best [...] It&#x27;s animated, but it&#x27;s human and will touch the soul of anyone who has loved deeply&quot;. In February 2004, &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; listed the anime as one of the &quot;10 Essential Animations&quot;, stating that it &quot;represents a new maturity for anime, one where the technical achievements of 40 years are finally put at the full service of an emotionally rich story.&quot;

===Awards===
&quot;Millennium Actress&quot; received the Grand Prize in the Japan Agency of Cultural Affairs Media Arts Festival, tying with &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. Additionally, it won the awards of Best Animation Film and Fantasia Ground-Breaker at the 2001 Fantasia Film Festival. It was awarded the Feature Film Award at the 8th Animation Kobe. The movie took home the prestigious Ofuji Noburo Award at the 2002 Mainichi Film Awards, and was honored with the Orient Express Award at the 2001 Festival de Cine de Sitges in Spain. The film was nominated for four Annie Awards in 2004, including Outstanding Direction and Writing. It was also promoted by its studio as a contender for the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but it was not nominated.

<doc id="829827" wikidata="Q449710" url="?curid=829827" title="Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned">
<text>Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned is the fourth studio album by English electronic music group the Prodigy. It was first released on 11 August 2004 in Japan, on 23 August 2004 in the United Kingdom by XL Recordings, and on 15 September 2004 in the United States by Maverick Records. Recorded almost entirely using Propellerhead Reason and mastered with Pro Tools, the album contrasts with the group&#x27;s previous releases, and features a larger use of vocals than their previous album &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; (1997). Keith Flint and Maxim Reality do not provide any contribution to the official record, which leaves Liam Howlett as the sole band member to do so for the only time in the group&#x27;s history.

The title is a play on the name of the Walter Mosley novel &quot;Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned&quot;. Despite achieving commercial success upon release, the album is among the band&#x27;s lowest sellers. As a result, XL and Maverick dropped the group after the release of the compilation album &quot;Their Law: The Singles 1990–2005&quot;.

== Background ==

In 1996, the Prodigy rose to fame outside their native UK with &quot;Firestarter&quot;, the lead single from &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot;, which was released in 1997 and topped several charts, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band ended the tour that promoted the album, taking a break from touring and recording and writing material for their fourth studio album. To coincide with the departure of Leeroy Thornhill during the period, the band shut down their official website for over two years, with its home page replaced with a logo of the band and the text &quot;We will be back&quot; set against a black background, leading to rumours that the band went on hiatus. The website was relaunched prior to releasing a new single in 2002.

The single released in that year, and one of the songs intended to be featured on the album was &quot;Baby&#x27;s Got a Temper&quot;. Generating controversy upon release for the lyrics by Keith Flint, which heavily focused on the misuse of the drug rohypnol, the song was met with mostly negative reviews from critics. Liam Howlett has since disowned the song. Despite its apparently low popularity, the song reached the top five of the Canadian Singles Chart and UK Singles Chart. It was intended to be released as a single from the then-upcoming album. Eventually, the group went in another direction, and the plan to include the song on the album was cancelled. Because it was left a non-album single, in 2008, the band&#x27;s official website&#x27;s discography classified it as an EP.

== Recording ==

Pre-production was done at Mews Recording Studios, while recording began in September 1998 and ended in April 2004. Unlike their predecessors, which featured contributions from the entire band, with Keith Flint only appearing on the group&#x27;s third album at the time, Liam Howlett recorded the album mostly by himself in similar vein to &quot;Experience&quot; (1992), using the Propellerhead Reason program installed on his Macintosh laptop. Moet Mastered, Damian Taylor, and Emily Lazar mastered the album via Pro Tools on the same computer.

Although the production process started in 1998, Howlett disliked the sound of the new album. He initially took a break in 2000, to &quot;go out with my mates and get drunk&quot;. He returned to Essex in 2001 to resume work on the record, but after six songs were written, he hired producer Neil McLellan, moving to a house after four months and then returning to the original studio:

My studio is crammed with equipment, but I ended up feeling I was being overcome by it all—it was just too much. I used to go to bed every night thinking &#x27;Tomorrow, I&#x27;m going to write the tune. Tomorrow is going to be the day&#x27;, but nothing ever happened. Eventually Neil McLellan pointed out that we&#x27;d been in the studio for four months without having anything to show for it. [...] Nat (his wife and All Saints member) was doing her own record so we weren&#x27;t spending a lot of time together, but there were always dogs to stroke and videos to watch and gardens to walk &#x27;round, so I didn&#x27;t ever feel like I was at work—I was too laid-back. [...] Neil [McLellan] said we had to get out, get back to London. I knew I physically couldn&#x27;t sit in my room any more, and for the first time in my life I listened to someone else and realised I actually needed help. It wasn&#x27;t that I needed help with the writing, just that I needed help finding the right headspace to get into the right frame of mind. I wanted to write a good album—one I was happy with—but to do that I knew I&#x27;d have to jerk myself out of [the] situation I was in and start again.

Howlett purchased and brought a laptop, a copy of the Reason program and selected a &quot;Thermionic Culture Phoenix valve compressor and Culture Vulture distortion unit, a Korg Micro Keyboard, a Manley Laboratories valve EQ and a 1970s Korg MS20 analogue keyboard&quot;. He would write the songs in &quot;his bed&quot;, and then create them using the equipment. After the recording was finished, Taylor, Mastered and Lazar mixed the album with Pro Tools, completing development on the album.

Of the three members of the Prodigy, only Howlett is present on the album musically. Actress Juliette Lewis, Oasis frontmen Liam and Noel Gallagher, Kool Keith of the Ultramagnetic MCs, who was previously featured on &quot;Diesel Power&quot; from &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot;, American rapper Twista, Shahin Badar, American hip hop musician Princess Superstar and the Magnificent Ping Pong Bitches were guest musicians on the album. &quot;This album is about reminding people what The Prodigy was always about—the beats and the music&quot;, Howlett wrote on a blog of a fansite after finishing the album. He also noted that his intention was to use vocals mostly as an extension of the sound rather than the main focal point, as was the case on &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot;.

== Composition ==

&quot;Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned&quot; is a shift in style that differs from previous releases. Although it was recorded heavily using Propellerhead Reason, the album features contributions from various musicians.

The album opens with &quot;Spitfire&quot;, named after and a tribute to the World War II plane of the same name. The song, which features Juliette Lewis on backing vocals, was featured on the soundtrack of the 2005 horror film &quot;House of Wax&quot;. &quot;Girls&quot; begins with a sample from &quot;Style of the Street&quot; by Broken Glass. When the beats and bass enter, its structure changes from that of an industrial hip hop song to excessive distortion and noise. The vocal samples used in this track are from D. Train song &quot;You&#x27;re the One for Me&quot;. &quot;Memphis Bells&quot; segues from &quot;Girls&quot;, and includes Princess Superstar on vocals.

Other tracks include elements unusual for a song from the Prodigy. &quot;Get Up Get Off&quot; features Twista (who co-wrote the song) on lead vocals. &quot;Hotride&quot; (whose music video was rejected by Howlett after completion) interpolates elements from &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;, while &quot;Wake Up Call&quot; was about waking up in the morning and getting &quot;back on tour&quot;. &quot;Action Radar&quot;&#x27;s beat was influenced by early hip hop music, but Howlett does not mention this, even in the booklet. 

&quot;Medusa&#x27;s Path&quot; was inspired by &quot;[Damian] Taylor&#x27;s parents&#x27;&quot; trip to Iran. This song is a six-minute instrumental that shares elements from &quot;Elahaye Naz&quot;, and samples a remix of a Jaydee song titled &quot;Plastic Dreams&quot;. What Howlett called &quot;analogue shit&quot; was the synthesizer that was used for &quot;Phoenix&quot;. When &quot;Medusa&#x27;s Path&quot; segues to this track, the synthesizer enters. The song is accompanied by a repeating sample of the Shocking Blue song &quot;Love Buzz&quot;. Following the track is &quot;You&#x27;ll Be Under My Wheels&quot;, the second time Kool Keith collaborated with the band, though his only lyrics are &quot;I rock, I roll.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ll Be Under My Wheels&quot; would be later used for the soundtrack of the 2005 racing video game &quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot; and the film &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot;. &quot;The Way It Is&quot;, samples Michael Jackson&#x27;s 1983 single &quot;Thriller&quot;, follows, while the album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Shoot Down&quot;, includes a sample from &quot;My World Fell Down&quot;, a song performed by Sagittarius. This sample had been used earlier on the unreleased live track &quot;Trigger&quot;.

== Promotion ==

&quot;Girls&quot; was released on 30 August 2004 as the lead single from &quot;Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned&quot;, entering the UK singles chart at No. 19. &quot;Hotride&quot;, released on 1 November 2004 in the United Kingdom, was not eligible to enter the UK charts as the CD was released in extended play format with three additional B-sides, and so did not conform to chart regulations. &quot;Spitfire&quot; was released on 4 April 2005 as the album&#x27;s third and final single. &quot;Memphis Bells&quot;, released on 28 June 2004, was exclusively available online as a digital download via a website promoting the album, in a limited edition of 5,000 copies. Each copy was a combination of customer-chosen instrumental, rhythmic, and melodic options, of which 39,600 choices were available. Five mixes were sold in three file formats, WAV, two audio mixes in MP3, and a 5.1 DTS surround sound mix and all were free of digital rights management. The experiment was a success, with all copies being sold out in over 36 hours, despite server problems from the demand.

== Release ==

&quot;Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned&quot; debuted at the top spot on the UK Albums Chart in its first week, and performed well in Australia, reaching number five on the ARIA Album Chart. However, with three singles, the album did not have any major hits worldwide. A limited edition of 5,000 copies of the album was released, sporting a black, inverted cover variant and no other extras. In Japan and the United States, the album contained a reworked version of &quot;Girls&quot;, entitled &quot;More Girls&quot;, which features Maxim Reality on vocals. It was promoted by a promotional double A-sided 12&quot; vinyl of &quot;Girls&quot; and &quot;Memphis Bells&quot;, released in very limited numbers on 21 June 2004, as well as a tour that lasted over two years.

== Reception ==
The album was released to mixed reviews, despite being commercially successful. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 53, based on 23 reviews. Drowned in Sound critic Adam Anonymous described the album&#x27;s overall sound thus: &quot;while Howlett may show his age occasionally throughout &quot;Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned&quot;, minus the circus-freak sideshow, all that remains is some very slightly contemporary dance music to get down to.&quot; Tim O&#x27;Neil of &quot;PopMatters&quot; felt that the album, while &quot;not bereft of highlights&quot;, is nonetheless &quot;the first Prodigy album that does not in some way build of its predecessor, and it suffers&quot;. In contrast, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, as well as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, AllMusic and several other publications were more critical, stating that the album sounded like an underdeveloped recording.

In February 2012, French electronic duo Justice included it in the &quot;NME&quot; list of &quot;100 Great Albums You&#x27;ve Never Heard&quot;.

<doc id="829828" wikidata="Q9349" url="?curid=829828" title="Picasa">
<text>Picasa was a cross-platform image organizer and image viewer for organizing and editing digital photos, integrated with a now defunct photo-sharing website, originally created by a company named Lifescape (which at that time was incubated by Idealab) in 2002. &quot;Picasa&quot; is a blend of the name of Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, the word &quot;casa&quot; (Spanish for &quot;house&quot;) and &quot;pic&quot; for pictures.

Native applications for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and macOS were available. Linux support was provided by bundling the Windows version alongside the Wine compatibility layer. An iPhoto plugin and a standalone program for uploading photos were available for Mac OS X 10.4 and later.

In July 2004, Google acquired Picasa from Lifescape and began offering it as freeware. The name was also registered by Google as an LLC. On February 12, 2016, Google announced it was discontinuing support for Picasa Desktop and Picasa Web Albums, effective March 15, 2016, and focusing on the cloud-based Google Photos as its successor. Picasa Web Albums, a companion service, was closed on May 1, 2016.

==Version history==

===Windows===
, the latest version of Picasa is 3.9, which supports Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7, and has Google+ integration for users of that service. Version 3.9 also removed integration with Picasa Web Albums for users of Google+.

===Linux===

Since June 2006, Linux versions have become available as free downloads for most distributions of the Linux operating system. It is not a native Linux program but an adapted Windows version that uses the Wine libraries. Google has announced that there will be no Linux version for 3.5. Currently, Google has only officially offered Picasa 3.0 Beta for Linux.

On April 20, 2012, Google announced that they were deprecating Picasa for Linux and will no longer maintain it for Linux.

To use latest version of Picasa on Linux, Linux users can use Wine and install Picasa for Windows. Linux users can use other programs to upload to Picasa Web Albums, including Shotwell and Digikam.

===Mac OS X===
On January 5, 2009, Google released a beta version of Picasa for Mac (Intel-based Macs only). Also, a plugin is available for iPhoto to upload to the Picasa Web Albums hosting service. There is also a standalone Picasa Web Albums uploading tools for OS X 10.4 or later. The Picasa for Mac is a Google Labs release.

==Features==
===Organization and editing===
For organizing photos, Picasa has file importing and tracking features, as well as tags, facial recognition, and collections for further sorting. It also offers several basic photo editing functions, including color enhancement, red eye reduction, and cropping. Other features include slide shows, printing, and image timelines. Images can also be prepared for external use, such as for e-mailing or printing, by reducing file size and setting up page layouts. There is also integration with online photo printing services. Other simple editing features include adding text to the image. Picasa supports Google&#x27;s WebP image format as well as the JPG format and most Raw image format (RAW files). A user can view and edit RAW files and save the finished edit (as JPG, or other forms) without any changes to the original RAW file.

====Keywords====
Picasa uses picasa.ini files to keep track of keywords for each image. In addition to this, Picasa attaches IPTC Information Interchange Model (IPTC) keyword data to JPEG files, but not to any other file format. Keywords attached to JPEG files in Picasa can be read by other image library software like Adobe Photoshop Album, Adobe Bridge, Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, digiKam, Aperture, and iPhoto.

According to the Picasa Readme, Picasa can parse Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) data. However, it cannot search local files for existing XMP keywords.

====Searching====
Picasa has a search bar that is always visible when viewing the library. Searches are live, so that displayed items are filtered as one types. The search bar will search filenames, captions, tags, folder names, and other metadata.

Picasa also has an experimental feature that allows searching for images that contain certain colors with the &quot;color&quot; operator.

===Viewing===
Picasa has no separate view window. There is only an &quot;edit view&quot; with a viewing area. Fullscreen view is available in slideshow mode, by holding down the ctrl+alt keys while in &quot;edit view&quot;, or by pressing the Alt Gr key. This feature is also available through the context menu of Windows Explorer, and provides a way to start the Picasa editor as well.

===Backup===
In Picasa 2 and earlier versions, changes to pictures made in Picasa overwrite the original file, but a backup version of the original is saved in a hidden folder named &quot;Originals&quot; in the same folder as the original picture (codice_1 on Mac OS X).

In Picasa 3, changes to pictures made in Picasa are saved to a hidden file codice_2 in the same folder as the original picture. This allows multiple edits to be performed without altering the original image. Viewing the picture in Picasa or using the Picasa Photo Viewer will apply modifications on the fly, whereas viewing through other programs (such as Windows XP&#x27;s Photo and Fax Viewer) will display the original image. Changes can also be made permanent using the &quot;Save&quot; function, where the original file is backed up in a hidden folder codice_1 located in the same folder as the original picture and the modified version is written in its place.

===Face recognition===
On August 15, 2006, Google announced it had acquired Neven Vision, whose technology can be used to search for features within photos such as people or buildings. Google applied this technology for face recognition, and this functionality was launched on Picasa Web Albums on September 2, 2008.

Neven Vision incorporates several patents specifically centered around face recognition from digital photo and video images.

===Geotagging===
Since June 2007, Picasa can write geographic coordinates to Exif metadata, thus geotagging an image.

Since version 3.5 of Picasa, geotagging may be done directly inside Picasa, in the Places panel.

The geotagging functionality is described in the Picasa User&#x27;s Guide.

==Other Picasa applications==

===Picasa Web Albums===

Besides Google+, Picasa also integrated with Picasa Web Albums, an image hosting and sharing web service. The service allowed users with a Google account to store and share their photos on the service. Users with a Google+ account received unlimited storage for photos of a resolution less than 2048x2048 pixels; all others received unlimited storage for photos of a resolution less than 800x800.

===Hello===
Hello by Google&#x27;s Picasa was a free computer program that enabled users to send images across the Internet and publish them to their blogs. It was similar to an instant messaging program because it allowed users to send text, but &quot;Hello&quot; focused on digital photographs. Users could opt to view the same pictures as their friends in real-time. One of the advantages claimed at the website is that photos could be shared through firewalls.

The service was canceled at the end of 2006, and users were instructed to try the Picasa &quot;Blog This&quot; functionality for uploading pictures to their blogs.
According to the official website, the Hello project was shut down on May 15, 2008.

==Discontinuation==

On February 12, 2016, Google announced that the Picasa desktop application would be discontinued on March 15, 2016, followed by the closure of the Picasa Web Albums service on May 1, 2016. Google stated that the primary reason for retiring Picasa was that it wanted to focus its efforts &quot;entirely on a single photos service&quot; the cross-platform, web-based Google Photos. While support for the desktop version of Picasa ended, Google stated that users who downloaded the software, or who chose to download it prior to the March 15th deadline could still be able to use its functionality, albeit with no support from Google.

<doc id="829830" wikidata="Q581967" url="?curid=829830" title="Billy Coutu">
<text>Wilfrid Arthur &quot;Billy&quot; Coutu (March 1, 1892 – February 25, 1977), nicknamed &quot;Wild Beaver&quot;, was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played ten seasons in the National Hockey League for the Montreal Canadiens, the Hamilton Tigers, and the Boston Bruins. Known for his fiery temper, Coutu was once given 42 penalty minutes in a 1923 playoff game against the Ottawa Senators, still a record to this day. He is the only player ever to have been banned from the NHL for life, as a result of his attack on a referee in 1927.

While a member of the Montreal Canadiens, Coutu was one of the players hospitalized during the cancelled 1919 Stanley Cup series, won the Stanley Cup in the 1923–24 NHL season, and was captain of the team in the 1925–26 NHL season. After his eviction from the NHL, Coutu played a total of four years in the Canadian-American Hockey League (C-AHL) and American Hockey Association (AHA), then coached the C-AHL&#x27;s Providence Reds.

==Personal life==
Billy Coutu&#x27;s last name is sometimes incorrectly spelled &quot;Couture&quot;, an error which appears in many NHL history books and, for a time, even showed up on the Montreal Canadiens website. Several hockey history books, including &quot;The Hockey News &quot;Habs Heroes&quot;&quot; by Ken Campbell incorrectly attribute his name to a photograph of teammate Louis Berlinguette. He and his family pronounced their name &quot;Kootoo&quot;, which was sometimes confused with &quot;Couture&quot;.

Coutu&#x27;s brother, Louis, was a trapper, who in 1928 discovered a message in a bottle from a survivor of the shipwreck of the SS Kamloops.

Coutu&#x27;s wife Gertrude was the sister of Wilhemina Aird Stewart, the mother of Mary Morenz, wife of Hockey Hall of Fame member Howie Morenz and grandmother to their daughter Marlene Geoffrion, wife of Bernie Geoffrion, another Hall of Famer. Howie Morenz played with Coutu on the Canadiens.

==Playing career==
Coutu turned professional with the Canadiens in 1916–17, the last season of the NHA. He stayed with the Canadiens when the new NHL formed for 1917–18. During the Stanley Cup playoffs in 1919, Coutu and four other teammates contracted influenza and were hospitalized. The 1919 Stanley Cup series was cancelled.

After playing the 1920–21 NHL season with the Hamilton Tigers, Coutu was traded back to Montreal prior to the start of the 1921–22 NHL season, along with Sprague Cleghorn, in exchange for Harry Mummery, Amos Arbour, and Cully Wilson, in the NHL&#x27;s first multiple-player trade.

Wearing No. 9, Coutu was named Canadiens captain in 1925–26, replacing Sprague Cleghorn. After the 1925–26 NHL season, Coutu was deemed expendable and traded to the Boston Bruins in exchange for defenceman Amby Moran who ultimately played just 12 games for the Canadiens.

During his first practice with the Bruins, Coutu body-slammed Eddie Shore. Coutu&#x27;s forehead hit Shore&#x27;s skull, severing Shore&#x27;s ear. Shore visited several doctors who wanted to amputate the ear, but finally found one who sewed it back on. After refusing anaesthetic, Shore used a mirror to watch the doctor sew the ear back on. Shore claimed Coutu used his hockey stick to cut off the ear, and Coutu was fined $50; Shore later recanted and Coutu&#x27;s money was refunded.
At the end of Game 4 of the 1927 Stanley Cup Finals, Coutu started a bench-clearing brawl, apparently at the request of coach Art Ross, by assaulting referee Jerry Laflamme and tackling referee Billy Bell in the corridor. As a result, he was expelled from the NHL for life; the longest suspension to date. On October 8, 1929, the suspension was lifted allowing Coutu to play in minor professional leagues, where he played into his late 30s with Minneapolis and also coached for several years. He never played in the NHL again, although the lifetime ban was lifted in 1929–30 and Coutu was reinstated in 1932–33 at the insistence of Canadiens owner Leo Dandurand.

<doc id="829848" wikidata="Q1923093" url="?curid=829848" title="Farragut Square">
<text>Farragut Square is a city square in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Ward 2. It is bordered by K Street NW to the north, I Street NW to the south, on the east and west by segments of 17th Street NW, and interrupts Connecticut Avenue NW. It is the sister park of McPherson Square two blocks east. It is serviced by two stops on the Washington Metro rail system: on the Red Line and on the Blue, Orange, and Silver Lines.

Designed by Pierre L&#x27;Enfant in 1791, Farragut Square is a hub of downtown D.C., at the center of a bustling daytime commercial and business district. The neighborhood includes major hotels, legal and professional offices, news media offices, travel agencies, and many restaurants including two underground food courts. Sometimes events are scheduled for the lunchtime crowds which gather in and around the square, such as the free Farragut Fridays series, held every Friday from 9 a.m. to dark from July through September, which features outdoor work and relaxation spaces, among other attractions. The park is the scene of popular D.C. pastimes like outdoor movies and yoga in the park. With its heavy pedestrian traffic, it also serves as a popular site for food trucks, leafleting, TV camera opinion polls, and for commercial promotions and political activity such as canvassing and demonstrations.

The most prominent institution on the square is the Army Navy Club on the southeast. Since the commercial building boom of the 1960s, there is little residential property in the area, and the square is mostly quiet after business hours. Many of the sandwich shops and coffeehouses that cater to neighborhood workers close before the dinner hour, as do the many street vendors. In recent years, however, especially since the 2003 rehabilitation of the park, movie screenings and similar evening activities have become more common, as have nightclubs in adjacent downtown areas.

Monday through Friday, several food trucks congregate on streets surrounding Farragut Square.

==Statue==
In the center of the square is a statue of David G. Farragut, a Union admiral in the American Civil War who rallied his fleet with the cry, &quot;Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!&quot; He was the &quot;First Admiral in the Navy.&quot; Its only inscription is &quot;Farragut.&quot; The statue was sponsored by an act of Congress, authorizing $20,000 on April 16, 1872. It was sculpted by Vinnie (Ream) Hoxie and dedicated April 25, 1881 by President James A. Garfield and First Lady Lucretia Garfield.

The statue and park are maintained by the National Park Service and administered as part of its National Mall and Memorial Parks unit. A proposal to build an underground parking garage below it was rejected in 1961.

<doc id="829852" wikidata="Q5538697" url="?curid=829852" title="George Dvorsky">
<text>George P. Dvorsky (born May 11, 1970) is a Canadian bioethicist, transhumanist and futurist. He is a contributing editor at io9 and producer of the &quot;Sentient Developments&quot; blog and podcast. He was chair of the board for the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (IEET) and is the founder and chair of the IEET&#x27;s Rights of Non-Human Persons Program, a group that is working to secure human-equivalent rights and protections for highly sapient animals. He also serves on the Advisory Council of METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence).

Dvorsky is a secular Buddhist, progressive environmentalist, ancestral health advocate, and animal rights activist. Primarily concerned with the ethical and sociological impacts of emerging technologies, specifically, &quot;human enhancement&quot; technologies; he seeks to promote open discussion for the purposes of education and foresight. He writes and speaks on a wide range of topics, including technoscience, ethics, existential risks, artificial intelligence, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and futurology, from a democratic transhumanist perspective.

== Nonhuman rights and ethics ==

=== Uplift ethics ===

Dvorsky presented an argument for non-human animal biological uplift at the IEET &quot;Human Enhancement Technologies and Human Rights&quot; conference at Stanford University in May 2006; and wrote the first published article in defence of the Ashley Treatment in November 2006, and subsequently the only bioethicist cited by Ashley X&#x27;s parents in their defense.

=== Existential risk ===
Dvorsky also presented an argument warning of the decline of democratic values and institutions in the face of existential and catastrophic risks at the &quot;Global Catastrophic Risks: Building a Resilient Civilization&quot; conference in November 2008.

=== Dysonian SETI ===

Dvorsky, along with Milan M. Ćirković and Robert Bradbury, published a critique of SETI in the May 2012 &quot;Journal of the British Interplanetary Society&quot; (JBIS) arguing that SETI techniques and practices have become outdated. In its place, Dvorsky, Ćirković, and Bradbury advocated for what they called Dysonian SETI, namely the search for those signatures and artefacts indicative of highly advanced extraterrestrial life.

== Space development ==

Dvorsky has written extensively in favor of space exploration and has both promoted and criticized various Megascale engineering concepts.

=== Dyson sphere ===

Dvorsky gained some notoriety in 2012 after writing about Dyson spheres, hypothetical structures intended to collect the entire energetic output of a star with solar power collectors. While Dvorsky presented it as a solution to humanity&#x27;s resource needs including power and living space, &quot;Forbes&quot; blogger Alex Knapp and astronomer Phil Plait, among others, have criticized Dvorsky&#x27;s article.

Other publications including &quot;Popular Science&quot;, &quot;Vice&quot;, and skeptical blog &quot;Weird Things&quot; followed up on this exchange. None of them note the above numerical inaccuracies, although &quot;Weird Things&quot; does point out Plait&#x27;s misunderstanding regarding bootstrapping, which Knapp agreed with in an update to his post. James Nicoll noted in his blog that Knapp seriously underestimated the area of a sphere.

North east of the River Werre and Salze (Bega) runs a strand of the Lipper highlands runs through the largely wooded hills with elevations up to 250 meters in the city. The lowest point is on the border of the River Werre at Herford at about 70 meters. Since 2008, the city is part of the Teutoburg Forest Nature Park / Eggegebirge.

The municipal area is crossed by the river floodplains of the Werre, and Salze. Podzol and Stagnosol brown soils prevail as soil types. The podzolic soils are mainly found in layers from the Tertiary Period, which are crossed by fault block from the Mesozoic. Characteristic of Bad Salzuflen are the saline springs that emerge at these geological folds and which give the region the name of &quot;Germany&#x27;s healing garden&quot;.
The geothermal heat sources are of sufficient quality that it makes it viable to use heat recovery systems utilising borehole heat exchangers and heat pumps.

===Expansion and use of the urban area===
The part of Bad Salzulfen classified as the main central town covers an area of . The municipal area has a roughly oval shape, with a maximum extension in east–west direction and 13 km in north–south direction of 11 km.
===Neighbouring settlements===
Bad Salzuflen is bordered to the east by the town of Lemgo, to the south by Lage and on the southwest by Leopoldshöhe. All three communities are part of the district of Lippe. To the west lies the county town of Bielefeld and in the north west, the city of Herford. To the north Bad Salzuflen borders on Vlotho in the district of Herford. Together with Herford, Bad Salzuflen belongs to conurbation of Bielefeld.

===Areas of the town===
The city is divided into twelve districts Bad Salzuflen, Biemsen-Ahmsen, Ehrsen-Breden, Grastrup-Hölsen (with Hölserheide), Holzhausen (with Sylbach), Lockhausen, Papenhausen (with Volkhausen) Retzen, Schotmar, Werl-Aspe (with Knetterheide), Wülfer-Bexten and the largest area in the district of Wüsten (with Frettholz, Glimke, Heller Hausen, Hollenstein, Pehlen, Pillenbruch, Voßhagen and Waldemeine). The most populous districts are Bad Salzuflen with about 19,700 inhabitants, Schotmar with 8,900, Werl-Aspe with 7,500 and Wüsten with 4,000 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2006). Together, these four districts over 70% of the population of Bad Salzuflen. The districts of Bad Salzuflen, Schotmar, Werl-Aspe, Holzhausen and Ehrsen-Breden form a continuous area of settlement.

===Climate===
Bad Salzuflen displays the typical fully humid temperate climate for Central Europe, with its maximum rainfall during the summer. The annual average temperature of 9.3 °C corresponds to the latitude and the altitude, however, the annual sum of precipitation is 743 mm which is slightly higher than the North German (640 mm) or the German average (690 mm), but due to its location in the rain shadow of the Teutoburg Forest, is slightly lower than the average for Lippe (877 mm).


==History==
The first mention of the settlement of &quot;Uflon&quot; comes in the middle of the eleventh century and of a &quot;place of salt&quot; nearby. In Old High German &quot;Uflon&quot; means &quot;The Woods/Forest&quot;. This later evolved into &quot;Uflen&quot;, &quot; Mitteluflen&quot; and &quot;Dorf Uflen&quot;. Therefore, the entire name means &quot;The salt baths in the woods&quot;.

It was the use of the Pauline salt source in the Middle Ages that led to the establishment of the first &quot;Saline&quot;. These salt workshops were located at a place which is still called &quot;the Salt Yard&quot; or &quot;Salzhof&quot; and the well is represented in the town&#x27;s coat of arms. Thanks to the lucrative salt trade and the promotion of the town to a city by the Counts of Sternberg, it was fortified with a circular wall and four gates. The Schliepsteiner gateway lies to the north (toward Exter), Heßkamper gateway to North East (toward Wüsten), Arminius to the southeast (toward Schotmar) and Herford Gateway to the West (toward Herford) with three fortified towers which also included the Katzenturm which can still be seen today. Until the Thirty Years&#x27; War, trading flourished with the white gold and brought great wealth to the town. The old houses, the sumptuous Bürgerhäuser and the Town Hall built in 1545/47 bear witness to this. The oldest surviving building in the city today is a three-storey Traufenbau of 1520.

Bad Salzuflen was made famous by its cures. With its three drinking water, three thermal and three salt springs it had the status of a Lippischer State bath. Although the founding of the royal Solebads was made nearly 100 years ago, Salzuflen only received the additional name &quot;Bad&quot; on 14 April 1914.

Bad Salzuflen was one of the few cities in the Middle Ages that did not suffer from financial difficulties because of its salt production, its topographical position and its thriving commercial development. This is proven today by the many beautiful houses with their typical architectural style for that time. The high healing properties of the water meant that new bath houses were built and other sources were drilled, such as the Leopoldsprudel whose sacred well is in the midst of today&#x27;s spa gardens. The development of the resort led to significant changes in the cityscape. The saltworks on the Salzhof discontinued salt production and is now the &quot;town square&quot; where the weekly market and town festivals take place. The Gradierwerke developed into a place that people with respiratory diseases retreated to. Over time, the long-established industry sectors disappeared and were replaced by the trading and spa industry, which benefited the numerous inns of the city.

The economic boom in the nineteenth century was also closely followed by the founding in 1850 of the Hoffmann starch factories that later rose to be the biggest European starch producers. The strategic location of Bad Salzuflen was rather insignificant and so was preserved largely during the Second World War from Allied bombing raids, and survived the war relatively unscathed after the war ended.

Between 1909 and 1924, the &quot;Bad Salzufler und Schötmarschen Straßenbahn GmbH&quot; plied their trade between those towns. From 1963, the Herford Light railway ran between the towns of Wallenbrück, Spenge, Herford, Vlotho, Weserhafen and the west of Herford.
==Religion==
In Bad Salzuflen, there are a variety of different religious communities. As the town is in the Protestant dominated Lippe District, they outweigh other evangelical Christians. The Evangelical Reformed Congregation are a part of the reformed Lippe Church and the Evangelical Lutheran congregation are unique in the town. There is a small Roman Catholic presence in the town as well as Baptists, Methodists, Gospel Christians, Mennonite Brethren, New Apostolics and Seventh-day Adventists. There is also a small Muslim community with a mosque in the town.

According to the 2011 census, there were 11.6% Roman Catholic Church and 54.5% Evangelical Church with other religions and those stating no religion making up the remaining 33.9%.

===Churches===
At the site of today&#x27;s Evangelical Reformed Church of St. Kilian (neogothic) on the Kirchplatz in Schotmar stood the original building from around the year 800 AD, the first Christian church in the region. She is the mother parish for many villages in the surrounding area. It is a three-aisled neo-Gothic hall church. The west tower has an octagonal floor, which is crowned by a lantern-like roof riders with steep roof.

The Evangelical Reformed City Church is located on the area known as Hallenbrink, the highest elevation within the old town. The core of the late medieval hall building was rebuilt in 1762 after a fire. In 1892 there was a comprehensive renovation and expansion of the building. The most important piece is the pulpit made in 1765 by Heinrich Kamp Meyer. The community center near the town church is a stucco building with stepped gables, built in 1928 in expressionist style.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in the Martin-Luther-Straße is run under supervision by Karl Siebold (Schildesche), a neo-Romanesque church built around 1891–1892 after a design by architect Hermann Held (Bethel). The foundation stone was laid on 12 July 1891, the inauguration took place on 8 May 1892, the Jubilate Sunday. In 1908–1909 the church was enlarged by Karl Siebold to the western part with tower. A new extension was carried out in 1939 by Gerhard Balke (Bethel).

The Catholic Church of Our Lady is at the corner of Grabenstraße and Woldemarstraße. The groundbreaking ceremony was on 23 September 1956 which began construction of the church, which was designed by the architect Joseph Lucas in Paderborn, with the foundation stone laid on 8 December 1956. The consecration took place on 8 March 1959 under the title: &quot;Mary, Our Lady, Queen of Peace.&quot;

The Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Resurrection on the corner Gröchteweg and Volkhausenstraße was built in 1964–1966 by the architect Loos (Bad Salzuflen). A significant contribution by the artist couple Hans-Helmuth von Rath and Margarete von Rath (Bad Salzuflen) can be seen in the artwork. The foundation stone was laid on 13 July 1964, and on 1 May 1966 the Jubilate Sunday, the church was consecrated. The Church of the Resurrection is used by the Lutheran and Reformed churches.
==Governance==
Two years after the division of the Free State of Lippe into districts, Bad Salzuflen was incorporated into in the county of Lemgo in 1934. On 1 January 1969, as part of the implementation of the &quot;Law for the reorganization of the district Lemgo&quot;, part of the North Rhine-Westphalian territorial reform, the new town of Bad Salzuflen was formed from the two towns of Bad Salzuflen and Schotmar and the ten municipalities Biemsen-Ahmsen, Ehrsen-Breden, Grastrup-Hölsen, Holzhausen, Lockhausen, Papenhausen, Retzen, Werl-Aspe, Wülfer-Bexten and Wüsten.

===Transport===

====Roads====
Bad Salzuflen lies on Bundesstraße 239. The A2 (E34) runs near the city and has easy accessibility to Junction 28 from the Ostwestfalenstraße and Junction 29 from the 239 feeder road. Today Lockhauser Straße connects the eastern and the western part of the city. The two previously existing roads over the Bega and Werre rivers were not able to accommodate the traffic in the city. Therefore, in the early 1980s the construction of a four-lane elevated highway was needed in the city.

====Bus and rail====
The central Bus station is called &quot;Am Markt&quot;. The city has four bus routes running hourly services which all run through &quot;Am Markt&quot;. All routes are operated by Bad Salzuflen GmbH, a subsidiary of Stadtwerke Bad Salzuflen.

The factory was established on 29 September 1850 by Henry Salomon Hoffmann and was founded on today&#x27;s Hoffmannstraße. The largest European producers of starch at its height employed, around the turn of the century, about 1,200 employees and was not only the most powerful business enterprises in Salzuflen, but also in Lippe. The Ciba-Geigy AG of Basel took over the majority of shares in 1981, and in 1985 was taken over by the British firm Reckitt &amp; Colman PLC, which ceased production at the site in Salzuflen in 1990. The distribution of Hoffmann&#x27;s products is done today by Reckitt Benckiser from Slough near London.

==Spa and health facilities==
A remnant of the salt mining, the Gradierwerke had a total length of 424 meters before today&#x27;s length of about 300 m. Of the original four existing salt works, only two are completely preserved. A third, whose origins date back to the seventeenth century, had to be closed due to disrepair. It was rebuilt after a Council decision as Erlebnisgradierwerk and inaugurated again on 28 July 2007 Festival in July 2007. The salt works are now operated only for short cures. The brine trickles down, the air is enriched near the salt works with the salt, the water droplets bind particles in the air. Inhaling salty air moistens the respiratory tract and positively affects the walls of the respiratory organs. In addition, the fine salt crystals have an expectoprant action on secretions, which intensively cleanse the respiratory of bacteria and can reduce swelling of the mucous membranes.

<text>Julien Offray de La Mettrie (; November 23, 1709 – November 11, 1751) was a French physician and philosopher, and one of the earliest of the French materialists of the Enlightenment. He is best known for his 1747 work &quot;L&#x27;homme machine&quot; (&quot;Man a Machine&quot;).

La Mettrie is most remembered for taking the position that humans are complex animals and no more have souls than other animals do. He considered that the mind is part of the body and that life should be lived so as to produce pleasure (hedonism). His views were so controversial that he had to flee France and settle in Berlin.

==Early life==
La Mettrie was born at Saint-Malo in Brittany on November 23, 1709, and was the son of a prosperous textile merchant. His initial schooling took place in the colleges of Coutances and Caen. After attending the Collège du Plessis in Paris, he seemed to have acquired a vocational interest in becoming a clergyman, but after studying theology in the Jansenist schools for some years, his interests turned away from the Church. In 1725, La Mettrie entered the College d&#x27;Harcourt to study philosophy and natural science, probably graduating around 1728. At this time, D&#x27;Harcourt was pioneering the teaching of Cartesianism in France. In 1734, he went on to study under Hermann Boerhaave, a renowned physician who, similarly, had originally intended on becoming a clergyman. It was under Boerhaave that La Mettrie was influenced to try to bring changes to medical education in France.

==Medical career==
After his studies at D&#x27;Harcourt, La Mettrie decided to take up the profession of medicine. A friend of the La Mettrie family, François-Joseph Hunauld, who was about to take the chair of anatomy at the Jardin du Roi, seems to have influenced him in this decision. For five years, La Mettrie studied at faculty of medicine in Paris, and enjoyed the mentorship of Hunauld.

In 1733, however, he departed for Leiden to study under the famous Herman Boerhaave. His stay in Holland proved to be short but influential. In the following years, La Mettrie settled down to professional medical practice in his home region of Saint-Malo, disseminating the works and theories of Boerhaave through the publication and translation of several works. He married in 1739 but the marriage, which produced two children, proved an unhappy one. In 1742 La Mettrie left his family and travelled to Paris, where he obtained the appointment of surgeon to the Gardes Françaises regiment, taking part in several battles during the War of the Austrian Succession. This experience would instill in him a deep aversion to violence which is evident in his philosophical writings. Much of his time, however, was spent in Paris, and it is likely that during this time he made the acquaintance of Maupertuis and the Marquise de Châtelet.

It was in these years, during an attack of fever, that he made observations on himself with reference to the action of quickened blood circulation upon thought, which led him to the conclusion that mental processes were to be accounted for as the effects of organic changes in the brain and nervous system. This conclusion he worked out in his earliest philosophical work, the &quot;Histoire naturelle de l&#x27;âme&quot; (1745). So great was the outcry caused by its publication that La Mettrie was forced to quit his position with the French Guards, taking refuge in Leiden. There he developed his doctrines still more boldly and completely in &quot;L&#x27;Homme machine&quot;, a hastily written treatise based upon consistently materialistic and quasi-atheistic principles. La Mettrie&#x27;s materialism was in many ways the product of his medical concerns, drawing on the work of 17th-century predecessors such as the Epicurean physician Guillaume Lamy.

The ethical implications of these principles would later be worked out in his &quot;Discours sur le bonheur&quot;; La Mettrie considered it his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. Here he developed his &quot;theory of remorse&quot;, i.e. his view about the inauspicious effects of the feelings of guilt acquired at early age during the process of enculturation. This was the idea which brought him the enmity of virtually all thinkers of the French Enlightenment, and a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; which was lifted only a century later by Friedrich Albert Lange in his &quot;Geschichte des Materialismus&quot;.

==Philosophy==
Julien de La Mettrie is considered one of the most influential determinists of the eighteenth century. He believed that mental processes were caused by the body. He expressed these thoughts in his most important work &quot;Man a Machine&quot;. There he also expressed his belief that humans worked like a machine. This theory can be considered to build off the work of Descartes and his approach to the human body working as a machine. La Mettrie believed that man, body and mind, worked like a machine. Although he helped further Descartes&#x27; view of mechanization in explaining human bodily behavior, he argued against Descartes&#x27; dualistic view on the mind. His opinions were so strong that he stated that Descartes was actually a materialist in regards to the mind.

The philosopher David Skrbina considers La Mettrie an adherent of &quot;vitalistic materialism&quot;: 


===Man and the animal===
Prior to &quot;Man a Machine&quot; he published &quot;The Natural History of the Soul&quot; in 1745. He argued that humans were just complex animals. A great deal of controversy emerged due to his belief that &quot;from animals to man there is no abrupt transition&quot;. He later built on that idea: he claimed that humans and animals were composed of organized matter. He believed that humans and animals were only different in regards to the complexity that matter was organized. He compared the differences between man and animal to those of high quality pendulum clocks and watches stating: &quot;[Man] is to the ape, and to the most intelligent animals, as the planetary pendulum of Huygens is to a watch of Julien Le Roy&quot;. The idea that essentially no real difference between humans and animals existed was based on his findings that sensory feelings were present in animals and plants. While he did recognize that only humans spoke a language, he thought that animals were capable of learning a language. He used apes as an example, stating that if they were trained they would be &quot;perfect [men]&quot;. He further expressed his ideas that man was not very different from animals by suggesting that we learn through imitation as do animals.

His beliefs about humans and animals were based on two types of continuity. The first being weak continuity, suggesting that humans and animals are made of the same things but are organized differently. His main emphasis however was on strong continuity, the idea that the psychology and behavior between humans and animals was not all that different.

===&quot;Man a machine&quot;===
La Mettrie believed that man worked like a machine due to mental thoughts depending on bodily actions. He then argued that the organization of matter at a high and complex level resulted in human thought. He did not believe in the existence of God. He rather chose to argue that the organization of humans was done to provide the best use of complex matter as possible.

La Mettrie arrived at this belief after finding that his bodily and mental illnesses were associated with each other. After gathering enough evidence, in medical and psychological fields, he published the book.

Some of the evidence La Mettrie presented was disregarded due to the nature of it. He argued that events such as a beheaded chicken running around, or a recently removed heart of an animal still working, proved the connection between the brain and the body. While theories did build off La Mettrie&#x27;s, his works were not necessarily scientific. Rather, his writings were controversial and defiant.

===Human nature===
He further expressed his radical beliefs by asserting himself as a determinist, dismissing the use of judges. He disagreed with Christian beliefs and emphasized the importance of going after sensual pleasure, a hedonistic approach to human behavior. He further looked at human behavior by questioning the belief that humans have a higher sense of morality than animals. He noted that animals rarely tortured each other and argued that some animals were capable of some level of morality. He believed that as machines, humans would follow the law of nature and ignore their own interests for those of others.

===Influence===
La Mettrie most directly influenced Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis, a prominent French physician. He worked off La Mettrie&#x27;s materialistic views but modified them in order to be not as extreme. La Mettrie&#x27;s extreme beliefs were rejected strongly, but his work did help influence psychology, specifically behaviorism. His influence is seen in the reductionist approach of behavioral psychologists. Nonetheless, the backlash he received was so strong that many behaviorists knew very little to nothing about La Mettrie and rather built off other materialists with similar arguments.

Cybernetics and its applications to psychology are also consistent with La Mettrie&#x27;s position.

However, currently the psychological school most clearly influenced by La Mettrie is cognitive science, including the 
philosophy of artificial intelligence, which proposes to build robots in the image and likeness of the human being and other living beings, and even analyze the human being based on the robot analogy.

==Later life==

===Journey to Prussia===

 La Mettrie&#x27;s hedonistic and materialistic principles caused outrage even in the relatively tolerant Netherlands. So strong was the feeling against him that in 1748 he was compelled to leave for Berlin, where, thanks in part to the offices of Maupertuis, the Prussian king Frederick the Great not only allowed him to practice as a physician, but appointed him court reader. There La Mettrie wrote the &quot;Discours sur le bonheur&quot; (1748), which appalled leading Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire, Diderot and D&#x27;Holbach due to its explicitly hedonistic sensualist principles which prioritised the unbridled pursuit of pleasure above all other things.

===Death===
La Mettrie&#x27;s celebration of sensual pleasure was said to have resulted in his early death. The French ambassador to Prussia, the comte de Tyrconnel, grateful to La Mettrie for curing him of an illness, held a feast in his honour. It was claimed that La Mettrie wanted to show either his power of gluttony or his strong constitution by devouring a large quantity of &quot;pâté de faisan aux truffes&quot;. As a result, he developed a gastric illness of some sort. Soon after he began suffering from a severe fever and eventually died.

Frederick the Great gave the funeral oration, which remains the major biographical source on La Mettrie&#x27;s life. He declared: &quot;La Mettrie died in the house of Milord Tirconnel, the French plenipotentiary, whom he had restored to life. It seems that the disease, knowing with whom it had to deal, was cunning enough to attack him first by the brain, in order to destroy him the more surely. A violent fever with fierce delirium came on. The invalid was obliged to have recourse to the science of his colleagues, but he failed to find the succor that his own skill had so often afforded as well to himself as to the public&quot;.&quot; In a letter to his sister, Frederick described him as a good devil and medic but a very bad author. He was survived by his wife and a 5-year-old daughter.

La Mettrie&#x27;s collected &quot;Œuvres philosophiques&quot; appeared after his death in several editions, published in London, Berlin and Amsterdam.

<text>Oerlinghausen (; ) is a city in the Lippe district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany located between Bielefeld and Detmold in the Teutoburg Forest. At the end of February 2023, it had 17,314 inhabitants.

==Geography==
Geographically, Oerlinghausen is situated on top of the Teutoburger Forest hills. Oerlinghausen&#x27;s highest point is the Tönsberg with 334 meters. The flatlands of northern Germany start some 40 km north of Oerlinghausen. There are hiking routes (such as the Hermannsweg) along the hill chain which stretches 80 km in east-west direction. To the south of the hills are large sand areas originating from melting glaciers during past ice ages. Although not high, the hills are steep in many places and almost completely covered by forest.

==History and culture==

First mentioned in documents in 1036, the town became a city in 1926 by authority of the Land of Lippe. In 1969 the city was expanded with the addition of Helpup, Währentrup and Lipperreihe as part of the &quot;Gebietsreform&quot; movement.

Oerlinghausen is home to an airfield which is one of Europe&#x27;s largest gliding centres as well as the well known &quot;Archäologisches Freilichtmuseum Oerlinghausen&quot; (archaeological open-air museum) featuring reconstructions of a variety of dwellings spanning from 10,000 BC to 1000 AD.

The city has also been home to an unusual number of well-known sociologists. Marianne Weber (born Schnitger), who was born in Oerlinghausen and married Max Weber here in 1893, was a well-respected author herself. Niklas Luhmann and Richard Grathoff, two of the key sociologists who made the Bielefeld University one of the premier institutions for sociology in Europe, have also lived in Oerlinghausen for extended time periods.

Hanning Elektro-Werke is headquartered in Oerlinghausen.

<doc id="829939" wikidata="Q553887" url="?curid=829939" title="Michel de Certeau">
<text>Michel de Certeau (; 17 May 1925 – 9 January 1986) was a French Jesuit priest and scholar whose work combined history, psychoanalysis, philosophy, and the social sciences as well as hermeneutics, semiotics, ethnology, and religion. He was known as a philosopher of everyday life and widely regarded as a historian who had interests ranging from travelogues of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to contemporary urban life.

==Early life and education==
Michel Jean Emmanuel de La Barge de Certeau was born in 1925 in Chambéry, Savoie. De Certeau&#x27;s education was eclectic, following the medieval tradition of &quot;peregrinatio academica&quot;. After obtaining degrees in classics and philosophy at the universities of Grenoble and Lyon, he studied the works of Pierre Favre (1506–1546) at the École pratique des hautes études (Paris) with Jean Orcibal. He undertook religious training at a seminary in Lyon, where he entered the Jesuit order (Society of Jesus) in 1950 and was ordained in 1956. De Certeau entered the Society of Jesus hoping to do missionary work in China. In the year of his ordination, de Certeau became one of the founders of the journal &quot;Christus&quot;, with which he would actively be involved for much of his life. In 1960 he earned his doctorate (&quot;thèse de 3e Cycle&quot;) at the Sorbonne with a study of co-founder of the Society of Jesus Pierre Favre before embarking on his celebrated study of Jean-Joseph Surin.

== Career ==
De Certeau was greatly influenced by Sigmund Freud and was, along with Jacques Lacan, one of the founding members of École Freudienne de Paris, an informal group which served as a focal point for French scholars interested in psychoanalysis. He came to public attention after publishing an article dealing with the May 1968 events in France. He also took part in Robert Jaulin&#x27;s department of ethnology at the University of Paris-VII after May 68.

De Certeau went on to teach at several universities in locations as diverse as Geneva, San Diego, and Paris. Through the 1970s and 1980s he produced a string of works that demonstrated his interest in mysticism, phenomenology, and psychoanalysis.

===&quot;The Practice of Everyday Life&quot;===
De Certeau&#x27;s most well-known and influential work in the United States has been &quot;The Practice of Everyday Life&quot;, cited in fields such as rhetoric, performance studies, and law. In &quot;The Practice of Everyday Life&quot;, de Certeau combined his disparate scholarly interests to develop a theory of the productive and consumptive activity inherent in everyday life. According to de Certeau, everyday life is distinctive from other practices of daily existence because it is repetitive and unconscious. De Certeau’s study of everyday life is neither the study of “popular culture”, nor is it necessarily the study of everyday resistances to regimes of power. Instead, he attempts to outline the way individuals unconsciously navigate everything from city streets to literary texts.

&quot;The Practice of Everyday Life&quot; distinguishes between the concepts of strategy and tactics. De Certeau links &quot;strategies&quot; with institutions and structures of power who are the &quot;producers&quot;, while individuals are &quot;consumers&quot; or &quot;poachers,&quot; acting in accordance with, or against, environments defined by strategies by using &quot;tactics&quot;. In the chapter &quot;Walking in the City&quot;, de Certeau asserts that &quot;the city&quot; is generated by the strategies of governments, corporations, and other institutional bodies who produce things like maps that describe the city as a unified whole. De Certeau uses the vantage from the World Trade Center in New York to illustrate the idea of a synoptic, unified view. By contrast, the walker at street level moves in ways that are tactical and never fully determined by the plans of organizing bodies, taking shortcuts in spite of the strategic grid of the streets. De Certeau&#x27;s argument is that everyday life works by a process of poaching on the territory of others, using the rules and products that already exist in culture in a way that is influenced, but never wholly determined, by those rules and products.

According to Andrew Blauvelt, who relies on the work of de Certeau in his essay on design and everyday life:

De Certeau&#x27;s investigations into the realm of routine practices, or the &quot;arts of doing&quot; such as walking, talking, reading, dwelling, and cooking, were guided by his belief that despite repressive aspects of modern society, there exists an element of creative resistance to these structures enacted by ordinary people. In &quot;The Practice of Everyday Life&quot;, de Certeau outlines an important critical distinction between strategies and tactics in this battle of repression and expression. According to him, strategies are used by those within organizational power structures, whether small or large, such as the state or municipality, the corporation or the proprietor, a scientific enterprise or the scientist. Strategies are deployed against some external entity to institute a set of relations for official or proper ends, whether adversaries, competitors, clients, customers, or simply subjects. Tactics, on the other hand, are employed by those who are subjugated. By their very nature tactics are defensive and opportunistic, used in more limited ways and seized momentarily within spaces, both physical and psychological, produced and governed by more powerful strategic relations.

===&quot;The Writing of History&quot;===
His work &quot;The Writing of History&quot;, translated into English after his death, deals with the relationship between history and religion. De Certeau makes a point in linking the history of writing history to the legitimization of political power and that &quot;Western&quot; traditions of history involve using the act of writing as a tool of colonialism; writing their own histories while un-writing the embodied traditions of native peoples.

===Death===
He died in Paris in 1986, aged 60, from pancreatic cancer. 

==Legacy==
A multidisciplinarian, he wrote ground-breaking studies in fields as diverse as mysticism, the act of faith, cultural dynamics in contemporary society, and historiography as an intellectual practice. His impact continues unabated, with new volumes appearing regularly, and perhaps surprisingly his reputation is growing even more rapidly in English and German-speaking countries and the Mediterranean than in his native France. This strong and growing interest in academia is not matched in the public sphere; however, partly due to his being considered a &quot;difficult&quot; author because of his highly personal style which makes translation difficult, and partly due to the declining status of French in the world generally. Nevertheless, portions of his prolific output have been translated into a dozen languages.

His fellow-Jesuit, Pope Francis, makes reference to his works in his 2024 encyclical letter &quot;Dilexit nos&quot;.

<text>DVD Shrink is a freeware DVD transcoder program for Microsoft Windows that uses a DVD ripper to back up DVD video. It can also be run under Linux using Wine. The final versions are 3.2.0.15 (English) and 3.2.0.16 (German); all other versions, such as DVD Shrink 2010, are illegitimate. DVD Shrink&#x27;s purpose is, as its name implies, to reduce the amount of data stored on a DVD with minimal loss of quality, although some loss of quality is inevitable (due to the lossy MPEG-2 compression algorithm). It creates a copy of a DVD, during which the DVD region code is removed, and copy protection may also be circumvented. A stamped DVD may require more space than is available on a writeable DVD, unless shrunk. Many commercially released video DVDs are dual layer (8.5 GB); DVD Shrink can make a shrunk copy which will fit on a single-layer (4.7 GB) writeable DVD, processing the video with some loss of quality and allowing the user to discard unwanted content such as foreign-language soundtracks.

==Features==
DVD Shrink is designed to be easy to use. It is contained within a single executable file that is one megabyte in size. The program features a DeCSS decryption algorithm, enabling it to open and decrypt many currently available DVDs, although it is defeated by some newer copy protection techniques. As well as this, it can open DVD files contained in a VIDEO_TS folder or a disk image (ISO, IMG, NRG or MDS/Ixx).

The DVD video may then be re-encoded by the application&#x27;s VBR encoder. The user is able to choose how the compression is to be distributed across the DVD. DVD Shrink can automatically re-compress video, to as little as 39% of its original size, depending on the aspect ratio of the original DVD (with a corresponding loss in quality) to allow it to fit on a standard DVD±R(W), a Dual-Layer DVD+R, or any user-defined custom size. When &quot;Deep Analysis&quot; and &quot;Adaptive Error Compensation&quot; options are selected, the quality of the resulting DVD is improved. These options are more time-consuming because DVD Shrink runs through the DVD once doing the analysis, and then again doing the transcoding. The transcoder in DVD Shrink was unusual at the time of its release in that it employs compressed domain video processing technology to avoid a full decode and re-encode of the video stream. This boosts performance significantly as only part of the video stream is decoded and scraped.

DVD Shrink operates in two main modes, &quot;Reauthor&quot; and &quot;Full Disk&quot;.

In &quot;Reauthor&quot; mode, the interface allows the user to choose specifically which DVD elements (Main Title, Menus, audio tracks and subtitles, and Special Features) to retain on the &quot;shrunken&quot; DVD; the Menu clips are stored in folders and some of them are playable. The compression is automatic if the Main Title only is selected, to fit it onto the selected size of DVD. If Special Features are also selected, their compression may be manually selected at the minimum possible using the Custom Ratio option, to give disk space to the Main Title.

In &quot;Full Disk&quot; mode, DVD Shrink allows the user to make a functionally identical backup copy without changes; alternatively random audio/subtitle streams can be deselected. Sections of the DVD, such as unwanted messages or logos/titles, can be replaced with still images, saving disk space for the Main Title. The compression can be automatic or manual, which allows selection of greatest compression for Menus or Special Features, saving disc space for the Main Title.

In either mode, the program has options to facilitate the stripping of the CSS copy protection, User operation prohibition (prohibiting skipping over previews or &quot;FBI Warnings&quot; and so on), and also allows the copy to be either made region-free (the default setting) or set for any region code. Extra software (such as AnyDVD, AVS Video Converter, or DVD Decrypter) may be required to remove more recent forms of copy protection such as Macrovision Ripguard. DVD Shrink can also shrink hard disk files already ripped by programs that can overcome more recent copy protection systems, but that do not offer the 2-layer to 1-layer compression.

Once the DVD content has been reduced in data size, the resulting output is an ISO file or a DVD VIDEO_TS folder. The program cannot burn these images itself, as it does not contain a built-in burning engine. It can however automatically pass the burning job to either Nero (version 7 or lower), DVD Decrypter or CopyToDVD as long as these programs are installed. This process appears transparent to the end user. To burn with ImgBurn the user can either copy the ImgBurn executable to the DVD Decrypter folder and rename it to dvddecrypter.exe (both engines use the same commands as they are coded by the same programmer) or use the hacked DVD Shrink with ImgBurn version. Alternatively, the resulting ISO file may be burned with any software capable of writing ISO files.

Although DVD Shrink gives the user free rein over compression settings for individual tracks on the DVD, removing content altogether is not allowed as there is a risk of upsetting the DVD&#x27;s menu software. Audio tracks and subtitles can, however, be removed. DVD Shrink also gives the alternative option of transferring selected sections as a series of stills, which acts as a high-compression &quot;placeholder&quot; for the original.

Recent events (increase in processor speed, lower cost terabyte disk storage, RAID drive functionality, etc.) have made it easier to store the ISO files directly to hard drive, in effect creating large-scale DVD media servers. Playback of these ISO files can be done directly on a network connected computer running a virtual DVD ROM emulator (like Daemon Tools Lite), or even through open source media systems (like XBMC).

DVD Shrink also has other uses. In particular, the 8-cm discs produced by the new DVD-based video camcorders are not fully compatible with all computers and DVD players; &quot;ripping&quot; them with DVD Shrink (or a similar program) and re-recording them to standard-sized DVDs is a quick and very effective solution to this problem. It also allows the recorded footage to be used with drives that do not support 8-cm discs, such as slot-loading drives (often used in Apple Macintosh computers).

Due to new copy protections that have come along since the final edition of DVD Shrink, backups may need the help of one or more other programs such as DVD Decrypter, DVDFab, DVD43 or AnyDVD.

==Legal status==
On August 17, 2005 the official DVD Shrink website was updated to say that the site &quot;is no more!&quot;, prompting many sites to mirror the latest DVD Shrink version and offer it for download. This was a result of DVD Shrink&#x27;s web host receiving a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice, as compromising limits on the accessibility of a copyrighted work is prohibited in many cases under the laws of the United States, specifically the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Shortly after, the website was restored, and a search box was put in place of the download link. DVD Shrink is now available from the official web page again, as it is available from many other sites on the Internet as well, and it suggests finding a download source using a general web search, &quot;DVD Shrink&quot;.

In some countries, the software in itself is illegal under applicable laws pertaining to copyrighted content. German law, for instance, while allowing the manufacture of copies of copyrighted digital material for personal, non-commercial use, dictates that it is illegal to circumvent mechanisms that prevent copying. Therefore, the use of any software enabling a user to work around copyright restrictions such as CSS is against the law in Germany.

==Scams==
The final versions are 3.2.0.15 (English) and 3.2.0.16 (German); all other versions are scams. The &quot;official website&quot; (dvdshrink.org) is not operated by the original developers. Alternate sites like Softpedia have been providing a clean, adware-free download of DVDShrink for a decade but is no longer available there, as well. A list of checksums for other valid DVD Shrink versions is available at the as well as at the doom9 forum.

<doc id="829966" wikidata="Q7758096" url="?curid=829966" title="The Press of Atlantic City">
<text>The Press of Atlantic City is the fourth-largest daily newspaper in New Jersey. Originally based in Pleasantville, it is the primary newspaper for southeastern New Jersey and the Jersey Shore. The newspaper designated market runs from Waretown in southern Ocean County (exit 69 on the Garden State Parkway) down to Cape May (exit 0). It also reaches west to Cumberland County. The &quot;Press&quot; closed its printing facility in Pleasantville in 2014, at which time it outsourced printing to a facility in Freehold. That printing plant (owned by Gannett) closed in 2017, with most of the New Jersey printing and production operations consolidated in Gannett&#x27;s Rockaway plant.

Coverage focuses largely on local and regional news, with limited state, national and international news appearing on the Nation &amp; World page in the Money section. &quot;The Press&quot; also publishes various other products, including &quot;At The Shore&quot;, the area&#x27;s entertainment guide. Presented in tabloid format, it is inserted in the paper each Thursday and an additional 20,000–40,000 copies are bulk dropped to key tourist locations throughout the year. Other specialty niche publications include &quot;Bliss&quot;, a twice-yearly bridal magazine; &quot;Real Estate Monthly&quot;; &quot;Summer Fun&quot;; &quot;The Atlantic County Living Guide&quot;; and &quot;The Cape May County Living Guide&quot;, among many others. Two branded editions of the paper, &quot;Press Extra&quot; and &quot;Sunday Saver&quot;, provide very limited coverage of the area.

Because &quot;The Press&quot; focuses on local issues, with an emphasis on local and school events – particularly high school sports – other daily papers have penetration in the area. These include &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, the &quot;Asbury Park Press&quot;, Cherry Hill&#x27;s &quot;Courier-Post&quot;, and the &quot;Vineland Daily Journal&quot;. In recent years, the Press has begun covering college football.

==History==
The newspaper was founded in 1895 by Walter Edge as the &quot;Atlantic City Daily Press&quot;. In 1930, the name of the paper was changed to the &quot;Atlantic City Press&quot;, and in 1971, the name was changed to &quot;The Press&quot;. In 1988, its name was changed again to &quot;The Press of Atlantic City&quot;, the name currently in use.

The paper was owned from 1951 to 2013 by Abarta, a privately owned Pittsburgh-based holding company largely known for Coca-Cola bottling, and oil and gas operations in Pennsylvania. On January 14, 2013, Abarta officials announced they were selling the paper to focus on their other business operations. On July 18, 2013, an asset purchase agreement was signed with BH Media, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary, for $9.6 million and the paper became wholly owned by BH Media on August 11, 2013. In 2014, BH Media bought the &quot;Current&quot; and &quot;Gazette&quot; newspapers. In 2015, BH Media bought &quot;Atlantic City Weekly&quot;. The newspapers were acquired by Lee Enterprises upon its purchase of BH Media in 2020.

Since April 3, 2023, the newspaper has published its print edition three days a week on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The print edition is also delivered by the U.S. Postal Service, rather than by newspaper carriers.

==Editions and subscription rates ==
&quot;The Press of Atlantic City&quot; is available in several formats. It is published in print and in several digital formats. In May 2013, the paper shifted from a traditional business model of separate paid subscriptions for print and digital, and created All Access Passes which give readers access to the news across all available platforms for one price. Current rates range from $16.50 a month for full digital access with Sunday home delivery or no home deliver, to $23.50 for seven-day print home delivery plus full digital access. The print newsstand rate is $1.00 for the daily edition, and $2.00 for Sunday. Prices are higher in Toms River and north.

On October 15, 2011, PressofAtlanticCity.com became a paid content website, and was the first daily newspaper site in New Jersey to request payment for access to its digital content. It is also available in a replica e-edition that allows viewers to see the entire paper digitally as it appears each day in print, along with page-turning technology and links. In addition to news and sports, both web editions have local auto, real estate and job pages within the respective sites. Readers may currently view up to five pages on a free trial, after which they are asked to subscribe.

<doc id="829987" wikidata="Q640386" url="?curid=829987" title="Lone Wolf (gamebooks)">
<text>Lone Wolf is a series currently consisting of 31 gamebooks, created by Joe Dever and initially illustrated (books 1–8) by Gary Chalk. Dever wrote the first 29 books of the series before his son Ben, with help from French author Vincent Lazzari, took over writing duty upon his father&#x27;s death. The first book was published in July 1984 and the series has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide.

The story focuses on the fictional world of Magnamund, where the forces of good and evil are fighting for control. The main protagonist is Lone Wolf, last of his caste of warrior monks known as Kai Lords, although in latter books the focus shifts on one of his pupils as the main character. The book series is written in the second person and recounts Lone Wolf&#x27;s adventures as if the reader is the main character.

==Original publication (1984-1998)==

===Development and popularization===
Joe Dever was seven years old when he became a fan of the British comic series The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire, which appeared in the magazine &quot;Look and Learn&quot;. He built armies of Airfix Roman soldiers and converted their spears to laser rifles, long before he was introduced to fantasy. Dever was introduced to &quot;science fantasy&quot; by his high school English tutor. He was the first and possibly only British person to compete in the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Championship of America, which he won in 1982.

Dever has stated that his earliest inspirations for Lone Wolf were medieval classical texts such as &quot;Beowulf&quot;, &quot;Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; and &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. In his teenage years Tolkien, Moorcock and Mervyn Peake along with military history and Norse mythology all contributed to the creation of the Kai. He also used travel books to discover images of &quot;exotic places&quot;.

Dever developed the world of Magnamund from 1975 to 1983 as a setting for his &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaigns. Originally called &quot;Chinaraux&quot;, the world consisted of only northern Magnamund. The Kai lords are like &quot;psionic rangers with special powers bestowed upon them by their gods&quot;. An individual book took 9 weeks to write, with three for mapping and plotting, and then 6 weeks of writing the story, creating an average of 12 entries per day.

Dever was originally contracted by London-based publisher Hutchinsons for four books, despite having planned out at least 13 for the series. When the first books proved to be popular, Dever was allowed an extension of contract and went on to write 20 books with Lone Wolf as the main hero, and 8 more featuring a new Kai Lord. He also developed the character Grey Star during this period, and four books were written using this character by Ian Page.

Dever also wrote &quot;The Magnamund Companion&quot;, in which all countries of the Lone Wolf world are described in some detail; readers are also given details on the Darklords and a trainer course in the Giak language. There are two games included, a Ragadorn Tavern Board game, and a short solo adventure that takes place immediately prior to book one, putting the player in the role of Banedon, a young magician who goes on to become a recurring character in the Lone Wolf books.

===Novelizations and canon problem===
With the help of Joe Dever, Paul Barnett, whose pen name is John Grant, wrote twelve novelizations of the Lone Wolf books known as the Legends of Lone Wolf, several of which were heavily edited before publication. They have received mixed reviews from fans. Barnett was the creator of the characters Alyss, Qinefer, and Thog. Random House stopped publishing the novelizations after the twelfth book because &quot;the books weren&#x27;t selling,&quot; though the truth of this statement is contested. Barnett entered discussions with an Italian publisher about reprinting the books unedited in Italian, this finally occurring with some editing of the original text. In July 2009, he announced on his blog that Dark Quest Books would republish an upgraded version of the series in English beginning in 2010. Only three omnibuses, containing the first eight novels, were released before the publisher ceased operation in the second half of 2016.

There has long been uncertainty amongst fans as to which version of the series is canon. Joe Dever has stated that as the game books precede the novelization, they are the &quot;authoritative&quot; versions. There is still some cross over between the novelizations and the gamebooks, however; most notably in the form of Alyss, an original character of John Grant&#x27;s who plays a significant role in the final books of the Grand Master series.

Only the first four volumes of the Legends of Lone Wolf were made available in the United States (though &quot;Sword of the Sun&quot; was divided into two separate volumes, &quot;The Tides of Treachery&quot; and &quot;Sword of the Sun&quot;).

===Decline of the genre, launch of Project Aon ===
During the latter period of writing, Joe Dever and publisher Red Fox were at odds, and Red Fox ceased publishing the Lone Wolf series after book 28, &quot;The Hunger of Sejanoz&quot;, citing lack of interest in the interactive gaming genre, despite hundreds of requests for the reprinting of several Lone Wolf books that had gone out of print. This left the series unfinished, as Dever had 4 other books planned. He first did plan on releasing these books in some form after completing his collaboration on the new Lone Wolf RPG.

In the United States, only the first 20 of the core Lone Wolf gamebook series were made available, the last 8 books were never printed in the US. It should also be noted that the American editions of books 13-20 were abridged versions and thus are shorter than the UK editions. The original color maps were also rendered in black and white for these books.

Although the series ceased publication and went out of print in 1998, a fan-operated organisation called Project Aon was established in 1999 which has subsequently converted many of the books to HTML format. Joe Dever first gave his permission for Project Aon to distribute the Lone Wolf books (1 to 20) online via the internet before eventually also giving the rights for the New Order series (21 to 28). However, a strong interest in Lone Wolf outside the English-speaking world, particularly in Italy, Spain, and France where the books were republished between 2002 and 2006, still existed.

As of December 2020, 29 of the 31 Lone Wolf gamebooks, the World of Lone Wolf series, the Magnamund Companion, and several other Lone Wolf related written works are available for download on the Project Aon website.

==Republication and expansion (since 2007)==
===The Collector&#x27;s Edition===
In 2007, Joe Dever announced that a revised and expanded version of the original series, called the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, would be published. Plans were also made to publish the final four books of the series for the very first time. However, several issues led the author to transfer the rights to various publishers over the years, with each publisher only releasing a part of the series.

====Mongoose Publishing (2007-2013)====
In 2007, Mongoose Publishing, editor of the &quot;Lone Wolf RPG&quot;, announced that the Lone Wolf books were going to be printed again. Mongoose Publishing planned to publish all the original 28 gamebooks of the series plus four new ones that were originally outlined by Joe Dever before the cancellation of the series by the end of 1990s. Mongoose republished 17 of the gamebooks from July 2007 to February 2013 before the termination of the partnership with the author.

====Mantikore-Verlag (2013-2015)====
In February 2013, after Mongoose had released 17 of the 28 original books, the publication of the rest of the series was transferred to a German publisher, Mantikore-Verlag. The deal only include the republication of the last eleven books of the original series (18-28) and did not include the first publication of the new four books (29-32).

On 1 April 2015, it was announced that book 29 would be first published in Italian by Vincent Books in November 2015, and then in English by Mantikore-Verlag the following month. However, the English version was not published as the rights transferred once again before the publication, after Mantikore had released books 18 to 22.

====Cubicle 7 (2015)====
Since April 2013, Joe Dever had made a partnership with Cubicle 7 to work on the series, which led to the publication of a new version of the role-playing game. In December 2015, Cubicle 7 Entertainment announced that they would be publishing the entire series of Lone Wolf gamebooks, including the English version of Lone Wolf 29, only to come back on their decision the following month.

====Holmgard Press (Since 2016)====
On 1 April 2016, Joe Dever announced that he would publish the remaining Lone Wolf books himself with his own imprint, Holmgard Press, starting with the publication of book 29 later the same month, which was finally published on 13 May 2016, 18 years after the publication of book 28. This included the publication of the four gamebooks that were never published before (29 to 32) and the republication of the gamebooks that were neither republished by Mongoose or Mantikore (23 to 28).

Following Dever&#x27;s death in November 2016, his son Ben and longtime fan Vincent Lazzari were tasked to complete the series, a decision that was difficult for Ben who had not read the books when he was a child. Book 30, &quot;Dead in the Deep&quot; was published in Italian in 2018 with plans to publish it in English in 2019, along with book 23, &quot;Mydnight&#x27;s Hero&quot;. Both books were released on June 27 of that year.

As of November 2022, Holmgard Press has published books 23 to 28 in a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, 29 to 31 in a &quot;First Edition&quot; and has started republishing the whole series in a &quot;Definitive Edition&quot;, with the first five books currently available.

In February of 2024, Holmgard Press released The Huntress series, a spin-off prequel featuring the eponymous Huntress. This trilogy was written by Jonathan Stark, co-host of the Journeys Through Magnamund Podcast, and is a self-contained series featuring a mercenary seeking the truth of who she is. It addresses some major lore questions fans of the series had held for years but which Joe never released answers to. A prequel to this series is available to play for free online.

====Megara Entertainment (2014)====
In September 2014, the publisher Megara Entertainment announces the publication of a spinoff, &quot;Autumn Snow&quot;, approved by Joe Dever and written by Martin Charbonneau, and calls for a crowdfunding to finance original illustrations from Gary Chalk. This is the adaptation of a work from Martin &quot;The Oiseau&quot; Charbonneau previously published in French the webzine &quot;Draco Venturus&quot; by the non-profit publisher . Two books were published, &quot;The Pit of Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Wildlands Hunt&quot;, before the publisher ceased operation.

Megara also republished the first book of The World of Lone Wolf series, written by Ian Page, &quot;Grey Star The Wizard&quot;.

===The Definitive Edition===
In June 2021, it was announced that Holmgard Press would make a second reprint of the whole series called the &quot;Definitive Edition&quot;, leading to the publication of the last story of the series, &quot;Light of the Kai&quot;, which will be split into two volumes. On October 31, 2021, it was announced that the first three books of the &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; were to be launched together in January 2022, but delays pushed the release to March 2022. The first three paperbacks were published in the US in January 2023.

As of June 2024, the first twelve books have been released.

===Reprint edition details===
====Extended version of &quot;Flight from the Dark&quot; and &quot;The Hunger of Sejanoz&quot;====
When &quot;Flight from the Dark&quot; was released by Mongoose Publishing in the Collector&#x27;s Edition format, it was partially rewritten and extended by Joe Dever to 550 sections instead of the original 350. It features a retcon of the opening of the book, where instead of Lone Wolf waking to find everyone at his monastery dead, he joins the fight. Dever has stated that, since he has the chance, and considers himself a better writer, that this is a good opportunity to make a better beginning. Longtime fan and assistant Jonathan Blake said of the retconning that overall, despite his love of the original, the surprises, grittier illustrations, and better writing have &quot;won him over&quot;. As of 2023, Holmgard Press offers both the original (as a softcover) and extended (as a hardcover) versions of this book in the Definitive Edition format.

&quot;The Hunger of Sejanoz&quot; had only 300 sections when it was originally published in 1998, as the last book in the initial publication run of the series. When Holmgard Press republished the book in November 2022, it was extended to the originally planned 350 sections, with Ben Dever and Vincent Lazzari writing the new 50 sections.

====Differences between the various editions====
Holmgard Press makes a difference between the first republication of the series by various publishers, their own second republication and the first publication of gamebooks 29 to 32.

The first republication of the first 28 gamebooks (made by Mongoose, Mantikore-Verlag and Holmgard Press) are called &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;. They have a hardcover and contain a bonus mini-adventure added at the end of each book (except book 1) featuring a character that is encountered during the main adventure or that lives events linked to it, although some of them are not linked to the main story whatsoever (like the various installments of the Dire series). These bonus adventures were written by various authors under the supervision of Dever or the staff of Holmgard Press after his death and don&#x27;t have the same amount of sections than the main adventure.

Gamebooks 29 to 31 have been published for the very first time by Holmgard Press between 2016 and 2020 and are called &quot;First Edition&quot; by the publisher. The three books share common elements with the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; of the other gamebooks, with a hardcover and a bonus adventure for books 29 and 30. However, they lack the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; tag on the cover and book 31 doesn&#x27;t have a bonus adventure like the other ones.

The second republication of the full series started in March 2022, which is also made by Holmgard Press, and is called the &quot;Definitive Edition&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t have the bonus adventures like the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; but features encyclopedic entries about different characters, places and artefacts that the player came across during the main adventure. Some adjustments have also been made to the main story of each book, with changes to some enemy stats, new powers granted by certain items and corrections to the text and some of the links of the previous editions. New sets of rules for advanced players are also offered. As of April 2023, the first seven books are available in hardcover and the first five in softcover, while ebook versions are due to be published at a later date. The chief differences between the hardbacks and the paperback books are the maps (in colors in the hardbacks, black and white in the paperback) and the 350 section &#x27;classic&#x27; version of Flight from the Dark in the paperback versus its 550 section version in the hardbacks.

The Limited Edition is the signed and numbered to 350 version of the Definitive Edition. Only books 6 &amp; 7 have been published so far in that edition.

====Internal artwork====
The &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; of the books feature new internal artwork by Richard Longmore (books 1 to 12, 17 and 20), Nathan Furman (books 13 and 18), Pascal Quidault (books 14 to 16), Hauke Kock (book 19 and 21) and Stephanie Böhm (book 21). However, the original illustrations by the late Brian Williams were reused for books 22 to 28.

For the &quot;First Edition&quot; of gamebooks 29 to 31, Giuseppe Camuncoli was hired to illustrate book 29, while Richard &quot;Nerdgore&quot; Sampson did the illustrations for books 30 and 31. Gary Chalk will return to the series by illustrating &quot;Light of the Kai&quot;.

For the &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; by Holmgard Press, Richard &quot;Nerdgore&quot; Sampson provided entirely new artwork for the extended version of book 1. For the original version of book 1 and for books 2 to 8, the original art by Gary Chalk will be reused. No information is currently available for the internal artwork of the subsequent books.

Illustrations for the various bonus adventures were done by Nathan Furman (books 2 to 11 and 17), Richard Longmore (books 12 to 16 and 23), Stephanie Böhm (books 18, 20 and 21), Aljosa Mujabasic (book 20), Hauke Kock (books 19, 22 and 24), Richard &quot;Nerdgore&quot; Sampson (books 25 and 26), Oliver &quot;Koa&quot; Cramm (books 27 and 28) and Adélaïde Euriat (book 29). No illustrations were made for the bonus adventure in book 30.

==Series synopsis==

Magnamund, a planet in the universe of Aon, is the focus of battle between the powers of Good, among them Kai (God of the Sun) and Ishir (Goddess of the Moon), and Naar, the evil God of Darkness.

In the north-east of Magnamund&#x27;s northern continent lies the realm of Sommerlund. Its people, the Sommlending, are devoted followers of Kai. There are those among them, known as Kai Lords or simply &#x27;the Kai&#x27;, who possess extraordinary innate abilities. Trained from childhood at the Kai Monastery, the Kai Lords are Sommerlund&#x27;s greatest defense against Naar&#x27;s agents.

Naar&#x27;s champions upon Magnamund are the Darklords, who dwell in the scorched wastes of the Darklands, west of Sommerlund. This realm, inhospitable to most life, enables the Darklords to survive on Magnamund — though powerful, they are greatly weakened by the natural atmosphere of their world. Forced to enact their will at a distance, the Darklords wage war with armies of Drakkarim (humans devoted to Naar), Giaks (goblin-like creatures spawned in vast numbers), and other creatures, and are served by agents such as Vordaks (undead with psychic powers) and Helghasts (shapechanging undead).

At the Kai Monastery is a young initiate, given the name Silent Wolf. On the feastday of Fehmarn, when all the Kai Lords gather at the monastery, Silent Wolf is sent to cut wood from the surrounding forest as a punishment for his inattention in class. While he is gone, a surprise attack is launched from the Darklands at several places across Sommerlund. The Monastery is assaulted and the gathered Kai Lords massacred. Rushing back from the woods, Silent Wolf is knocked out by a low-lying tree branch (in the Legends of Lone Wolf novelizations based on the books, it&#x27;s implied that the branch was placed there by a demi-goddess called Alyss so Silent Wolf would be spared the attack). When he awakes, he finds himself the only survivor. The last of the Kai, he renames himself Lone Wolf and sets out for the capital to inform the King of the loss of the Kai.

In the re-release version of &quot;Flight from the Dark&quot; in 2007 by Mongoose Publishing, the beginning of the story is slightly different as Silent Wolf takes part in the battle.

===The Kai Series===
The Kai Series (gamebooks 1 to 5) follows Lone Wolf as he rallies the armies of Sommerlund and her ally, Durenor, to repel the invasion, pursues and captures the traitor who brought about the invasion, and survives plots to complete the destruction of the Kai.

In &quot;Flight from the Dark&quot;, Lone Wolf reaches the King in Holmgard who then dispatches him to Durenor to recover the Sommerswerd in &quot;Fire on the Water&quot;, and returning to defeat Archlord Zagarna, leader of the Darklords. The third book, &quot;The Caverns of Kalte&quot;, finds Lone Wolf chasing the betrayer of Sommerlund, Vonotar, in the frozen northern wastes of Kalte. In &quot;The Chasm of Doom&quot;, Lone Wolf thwarts the resurrection of the first and most powerful Darklord, Vashna. At the end of the series, in &quot;Shadow on the Sand&quot;, Lone Wolf recovers the Book of the Magnakai, the ancient text which contains the higher lore of the Kai Lords through an encounter with Haakon, the new leader of the Darklords. With the massacre of the Kai, and Lone Wolf only an initiate, these teachings were thought to be lost.

===The Magnakai Series===
The Magnakai Series (gamebooks 6 to 12) continues the tale, with Lone Wolf now a fledgling Kai Master striving to understand the Magnakai teachings. The Book of the Magnakai, however, is ancient and incomplete. To perfect his understanding and train a new order of Kai Lords, Lone Wolf must follow the path of Sun Eagle, the first Kai Lord and author of the Book of the Magnakai. Sun Eagle quested for the wisdom encapsulated in the Lorestones of Nyxator, seven orbs scattered across Northern Magnamund.

As Lone Wolf begins the same quest, however, war breaks out again. The Darklords have again rallied behind a new leader, Archlord Gnaag, and now hasten their invasion to defeat the Magnakai quest. In &quot;The Kingdoms of Terror&quot;, Lone Wolf pursues the quest through the war-torn realms to find the Lorestone of Varetta. &quot;Castle Death&quot; leads Lone Wolf to his first encounter with the Elder Magi and the capture of a second Lorestone in the fortress of Kazan-Oud. The third Lorestone is found in the Danarg swamp in &quot;The Jungle of Horrors&quot;. An old enemy from &quot;Shadow on the Sand&quot; is finally defeated in &quot;The Cauldron of Fear&quot;.

Lone Wolf then makes the perilous journey to the edge of the Darklands, deep in the territory of the Darklords. There, in &quot;The Dungeons of Torgar&quot;, he falls into a void leading beyond the plane of Magnamund. Finding the final two Lorestones and finally settling the score with Vonotar, Lone Wolf is able to return to Sommerlund, chronicled in &quot;The Prisoners of Time&quot;. When Lone Wolf returns to Magnamund, he finds that 8 years have passed and most of the world is under the grip of the Darklords under the leadership of Archlord Gnaag. Ultimately, in &quot;The Masters of Darkness&quot;, Lone Wolf enters the Darkland capital of Helgedad and brings about the destruction of the Darklords after having faced and bested Archlord Gnaag himself in single combat.

===The Grand Master Series===
The Grand Master Series (gamebooks 13 to 20) continues the story of Grand Master Lone Wolf and introduces the restored order of Kai Lords. With the destruction of the Darklords, Naar and his agents abandon open warfare and seek new paths to dominance, often focused directly on Lone Wolf as the keystone of the forces of Light.

In &quot;The Plague Lords of Ruel&quot;, Lone Wolf meets for the first time Archdruid Cadak, leader of the Cener Druids, and destroys the deadly virus they were creating to wipe out all life on Magnamund. Following that, the closest friend of Lone Wolf, Guildmaster Banedon, is kidnapped. The Kai Grand Master makes haste to save his friend in &quot;The Captives of Kaag&quot;. Meanwhile, Warlord Magnaarn of Nyras is trying to find the Doomstone of Darke to combine it with the Nyras Sceptre. In &quot;The Darke Crusade&quot;, Lone Wolf tries to find the Doomstone before the Drakkarim. For the second time, Lone Wolf prevents the resurrection of Darklord Vashna in &quot;The Legacy of Vashna&quot;.

Shortly after, &quot;The Deathlord of Ixia&quot; comes into possession of the Deathstaff, an item to be used to resurrect Vashna. But while Lone Wolf is away from Sommerlund, Naar attempts to destroy the Kai Monastery for the second time in &quot;Dawn of the Dragons&quot;. Following his defeat, the Dark God executes a new plan for revenge on Lone Wolf by sending a doppelgänger named &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Bane&quot; in the book of the same name. During the mission involving Wolf&#x27;s Bane, Lone Wolf finds out that Naar had come into possession of the holy Moonstone. In his final mission, the Kai Grand Master infiltrates the Plane of Darkness to retrieve the sacred jewel in &quot;The Curse of Naar&quot;.

===The New Order Series===
The New Order Series (gamebooks 21 to 32) was originally intended to be 12 books long but in January 2023, Holmgard Press announced that the 12th book would be split into two volumes, bringing the series to a total of 13 books. Only the first eight books were originally released before the cancellation of the series in 1998; it took 18 years before the next book got published.

The New Order series features a new protagonist, a Grand Master in the Second Order of the Kai and a student of Lone Wolf, who is now Supreme Master. This series allows the player to &#x27;customize&#x27; his character by allowing the choice of an individual name (originally, the name was speculated to be Falco Nero, or Black Hawk).

Much of the series focuses on attempts by Naar&#x27;s minions to use remnants of the power of Agarash the Damned, Naar&#x27;s greatest champion and predecessor to the Darklords. The series is mostly set in Southern Magnamund, center of Agarash&#x27;s empire, which was not featured in the earlier series. In &quot;Voyage of the Moonstone&quot;, the new protagonist is sent to the Isle of Lorn to return the Moonstone to its creators, the Shianti. However, this book ends midway during the trip, in Elzian. The second part of this adventure plays out in &quot;The Buccaneers of Shadaki&quot;. After completing this quest, the Grand Master is sent, in &quot;Mydnight&#x27;s Hero&quot;, to the Isle of Sheasu to persuade Prince Karvas, heir of the King of Siyen, to return to his homeland to claim the throne before the evil Baron Sadanzo takes it.

In &quot;Rune War&quot;, the Kai Order goes on a crusade to help the land of Lyris which has been invaded by the forces of Eldenora. The enemy leader, Lord Vandyan, has come into possession of the Runes of Agarash which grants him great power. At the end of the mission to destroy the runes, the Grand Master learns that Lone Wolf has been kidnapped and taken to the former Darklands&#x27; stronghold of Gazad Helkona. Similar to &quot;The Captives of Kaag&quot;, the Grand Master sets out to the rescue of his leader in &quot;Trail of the Wolf&quot;. A year later, in &quot;The Fall of Blood Mountain&quot;, the Grand Master is sent to help the Kingdom of Bor. Its inhabitants, the dwarves, have freed the evil Shom&#x27;zaa, who is now wreaking havoc in the caves of this subterranean land. He returns to Southern Magnamund in &quot;Vampirium&quot;, to deal with Autarch Sejanoz of Bhanar, who has found the Claw of Naar, a powerful weapon. After retrieving this artefact from the Autarch, in &quot;The Hunger of Sejanoz&quot; the Grand Master escorts Xo-lin, emperor of Chai, to safety in the distant city of Tazhan across the Lissanian Plain as news of Sejanoz&#x27; invasion force reach the palace in Pensei.

The following adventure, &quot;The Storms of Chai&quot;, takes place 18 years later. Just like for the Nyras Sceptre from &quot;The Darke Crusade&quot;, the Claw of Naar can be coupled with a mystical evil stone to increase its power. This jewel, the Eye of Agarash, is set on the throne of the Khea-Khan (emperor) of Chai and the mission of the Grand Master is to retrieve it. This is just one of the six missions Lone Wolf has given to his six Grand Masters: upon completing his mission, the Grand Master learns that two of his brothers have died during their own missions and that Grand Master Steel Hand has been captured by the forces of darkness near the Maakengorge.

In &quot;Dead in the Deep&quot;, the Grand Master must rescue Steel Hand before it is too late. Traveling to the ruins of the Lyrisian city of Emolyria, the Grand Master discovers that the Lake of Blood, which once surrounded Helgedad, had moved to the bottom of the Maakengorge. The Nadziranim are using the power of the lake to open a Shadow Gate and bring forth the Tzomah, an incarnation of the Chaos-master of the Daziarn. Freeing Steel Hand, the Grand Master also destroys the hidden fortress under Emolyria.

In &quot;The Dusk of Eternal Night&quot;, Archlord Vashna has returned but that is not the only danger the Grand Master must faces. An evil secret organisation is preparing a ritual to free the True Son of Naar and the Grand Master must stop it before it is too late.

The last story of the series will be titled &quot;Light of the Kai&quot; and will be divided into two volumes which will be published respectively in October 2024 and October 2025.

==Reception==
The gamebook series was published between 1984 and 1998 in over 30 countries, translated into 18 languages, and sold in excess of 10 million copies worldwide. Each of the first 20 books had average print runs of 250,000.

The response to the original Lone Wolf book series has been largely positive. Three books of the series won &quot;Game Book of the Year&quot; between 1985 and 1987. The series was also awarded the Gamemaster International &quot;All Time Great&quot; award in 1991. The high quality of Joe Dever&#x27;s descriptive prose receives especial praise, as well as the fact that the books, if played together, form a cohesive continuing story, with recurring characters (something not often seen in gamebooks).

In the inaugural issue of &quot;The Games Machine&quot;, John Woods called the combat system &quot;quite ingenious, including considerably more variety than that of &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; while being just as easy to use.&quot; He noted that one could play any book in the series as a standalone adventure, but recommended playing the books as an ongoing series, saying &quot;the feel of a book is added to if it is played as part of an on-going saga - one of the factors that has made &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; so successful.

The 2007 extended version of &quot;Flight from the Dark&quot; was also well received by critics. It was a semi-finalist for the 34th Origins Awards in the &quot;Publication, fiction&quot; category while its German version won the 2010 RPC Game Award in the &quot;Gamebook&quot; category.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
Three scripts were developed for a potential Lone Wolf film release but they did not proceed beyond the pre-production phase. However, in July 2009, a small company, called Convergence Entertainment, who produced the King of Fighters movie, announced that it had bought the rights to make a live-action film based on Lone Wolf.

===Audio===
The &quot;Legends of Lone Wolf&quot; novel &quot;Eclipse of the Kai&quot; was abridged as an audio book read by Edward da Souza on 7 May 1992. Another was recorded but not released. A version narrated and composed by Joe Dever was also made, but never released.

There was also a series of telephone adventures called &quot;Phonequest&quot;, one of which was known as &quot;Fortress of Doom&quot;.

===Video games===

Three computer games were released during the late 1980s using the Lone Wolf license. The first two, published by Hutchinson, were adapted from the first two gamebooks, while the third, from Audiogenic Software and entitled &quot;Mirror of Death&quot;, featured an original storyline. &quot;Mirror of Death&quot; was well received by several game magazines.

An online MMORPG was in development by fans with the support of Joe Dever and a playable demo had been released for beta testing, but development abruptly stopped when it was announced that a first-person computer game was being developed by Singapore-based Ksatria Gameworks Pte Ltd. Joe Dever was cited as Lead Designer on the project, for which no official release date have ever been announced. The studio also had the license to produce more Lone Wolf games. However, the company abruptly dissolved in 2009 because of the Great Recession. The rights to make a video game were shortly held by Red Entertainment before the Italian company Forge Reply announced in August 2011 that it was working on a game for the next-gen consoles.

In March 2013, an application for IOS and Android was unveiled by Forge Reply at the Game Developers Conference as a story occurring between the third and fourth books, taking Lone Wolf to a mining town to unravel a mystery. Called Joe Dever&#x27;s Lone Wolf, it consisted of four separate acts, the first one being called &quot;Rockstarn&quot; which was released in November 2013. The following acts, named &quot;Forest Hunt&quot;, &quot;Shianti Temple&quot;, and &quot;V’taag&quot; respectively, were subsequently released. The four acts were then released together in one bundle for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2016, and then for Nintendo Switch in 2018.

An adaption of the first five books for the Nintendo DS handheld console, called LoneWolfDS, is available in homebrew format. &quot;Lone Wolf Saga&quot;, a complete Android version of the first 20 gamebooks (the Kai, Magnakai and Grandmaster sub-series) is available, similarly &quot;Seventh Sense S&quot; is a complete Microsoft Windows version. All used Project Aon&#x27;s licence and data.

Two game modules for the game &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; were named after the Lone Wolf book series.

On October 10, 2018, the Lone Wolf AR game was announced. Describing itself as the world&#x27;s first augmented reality role-playing game, it was developed by Visionizar LTD and was launched at the Lucca Comics &amp; Games event on October 31, 2018.

=== Tabletop roleplaying game ===
Several adaptations also exist of the Lone Wolf series, including &quot;Lone Wolf: The Roleplaying Game&quot;, a D20-style role-playing game from Mongoose Publishing Ltd UK. A second version of this role-playing game, &quot;Lone Wolf Multiplayer Game Book&quot;, with rules closer to those of the gamebooks, was also released by Mongoose. A third version, by Cubicle 7, is currently in preparation.

In 2004 the license was adapted as &quot;Lone Wolf: The Roleplaying Game&quot;, a role-playing game by Mongoose Publishing under the Open Game License using Mongoose&#x27;s OGL System. This has met mostly with praise for its adaptation of the Lone Wolf world, though some believe that there are many overlooked problems with the RPG, such as balance between classes and &quot;hard to interpret&quot; rules. Dever is credited with helping the game&#x27;s principal designer, August Hahn, incorporate information from his final four unreleased books into the game. A line of miniatures was also created for the game.

In March 2010, a new version of the roleplaying game called &quot;Lone Wolf Multiplayer Game Book&quot;, with rules closer to the ones of the gamebooks, was launched by Mongoose Publishing. The French editor took part of the development of the background. In March 2013, Cubicle 7 announced that it had obtained the rights to develop a roleplaying game based on Lone Wolf.

On 30 October 2013, Cubicle 7 announced the development of a new roleplaying game, called &quot;Lone Wolf Adventure Game&quot;, as &quot;a development of the previous Multiplayer Game&quot;. A crowdfunding was launched on Kickstarter and collected £68,000. On 26 August 2014, C7 publishes the character sheet with a summary of rules. The core rules were released in 2015 as a boxed set consisting of three books: &quot;Book of Kai Training&quot;, allowing players to create their own characters for the game, &quot;Book of Kai Wisdom&quot;, containing the rules to play the game, and the &quot;Book of Kai Legends&quot; which consists of two adventures and advice on creating future adventures. In addition to the books pre-generated characters and blank character sheets were included. The boxed set was designed to be played straight from the box, with the first adventure in the &quot;Book of Kai Legends&quot; allowing new players to start with the pre-generated characters and play immediately.

<doc id="830002" wikidata="Q127124" url="?curid=830002" title="Hook (music)">
<text>A hook is a musical idea, often a short riff, passage, or phrase, that is used in popular music to make a song appealing and to &quot;catch the ear of the listener.&quot; The term generally applies to popular music, especially rock, R&amp;B, hip hop, dance, and pop. In these genres, the hook is often found in, or consists of, the chorus. A hook can be either melodic or rhythmic, and often incorporates the main motif for a piece of music.

==Definitions==
One definition of a hook is &quot;a musical or lyrical phrase that stands out and is easily remembered.&quot; Definitions typically include some of the following: that a hook is repetitive, attention-grabbing, memorable, easy to dance to, and has commercial potential and lyrics. A hook has been defined as a &quot;part of a song, sometimes the title or key lyric line, that keeps recurring.&quot; Alternatively, the term has been defined as

and can be something as insubstantial as a &#x27;sound&#x27; (such as &quot;da doo ron ron&quot; or &quot;toora-loora-loo&quot;) but

While some melodic hooks include skips of an octave or more to make the line more interesting, a hook can be equally catchy by employing rhythmic syncopation or other devices. A hook may also garner attention from listeners from other factors, such as the vocal timbre or instrumentation, as in the case of the Beach Boys&#x27; use of an Electro-Theremin in &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. Some hooks become popular without using any unusual elements. For example, in the song &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, performed by The Ronettes, the hook consists of the words &quot;be my baby&quot; over the conventional I–vi–IV–V chord progression of the chorus. Hooks in hip hop almost always refer to the chorus between verses; as in the lyrics to &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;, &quot;check out the hook, while my DJ revolves it&quot;, that leads into the chorus itself.

==Use in market research==
The hooks of a song may be used in market research to assist in gauging the popularity of a song based on the listener&#x27;s ability to recognize the song&#x27;s hook. Often radio stations conduct &quot;call out&quot; either on the Internet, via telephone, or a music test (either online or in an in-person setting) to conduct surveys. Stations may use the services of a professional &quot;hook service&quot; or prepare the materials themselves. In some studies, radio stations play the hook, typically 8–12 bars long, for audiences of up to 150 participants. The participants are then asked to rate the song on a scale from &quot;dislike very much&quot; to &quot;like very much&quot;. Top 40 stations typically can&#x27;t wait that long for results and have participants &quot;call out&quot; directly, by listening and rating different hooks. Studies such as these inform the radio station how popular current songs are or if the audience is &quot;burned out&quot; of a certain song. Market research based on hooks gives radio stations of all genres awareness of what their audience demographic wants to listen to, and is even used to test the musical boundaries of the audience. Some groups even release these research hooks on a single&#x27;s CD release.

==Scientific research==
A European consortium (including Utrecht University and the University of Amsterdam) studies the hook by using online games and the wisdom of the crowd to understand and quantify the effect of catchiness on musical memory.

<text>The coat of arms of South Australia is an official symbol of the state of South Australia. It was granted by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 April 1984. They replaced a coat of arms granted to the State in 1936 by King Edward VIII.

The shield has the piping shrike within a golden disc (representing the rising sun) on a blue background. The piping shrike is the unofficial bird emblem of South Australia and also appears on the state badge. The crest is the Sturt&#x27;s desert pea, the floral emblem of South Australia, on top of a wreath of the state colours. The coat of arms has no supporters, but a 1984 proposal showed koala and wombat supporters. The compartment, or base, is a grassland with symbols of agriculture and industry, and a motto with the name &quot;South Australia&quot;.

<doc id="830024" wikidata="Q1418747" url="?curid=830024" title="Fire Bomber">
<text>Fire Bomber is a fictional rock band from the anime series &quot;Macross 7&quot; (and related projects such as &quot;Macross 7 Trash&quot;, &quot;Macross 7 Encore&quot;, and &quot;Macross Dynamite 7&quot;). In real life, Fire Bomber&#x27;s music was performed by Yoshiki Fukuyama (the singing voice and guitar of Basara), Chie Kajiura (the singing voice of Mylene), and occasionally by Tomo Sakurai (the acting spokesperson of Mylene).

The four band members are among the main characters of &quot;Macross 7&quot;, whose narrative significantly focuses on their adventures (particularly on those of the two lead vocalists Basara Nekki and Mylene Flare Jenius). The band members sing on stage as well as in space, where they occasionally engage in combat in their mecha. In the fictional world of &quot;Macross&quot;, Fire Bomber was pivotal in defeating the alien &quot;Protodeviln&quot; after discovering that their music was the only thing capable of affecting them. 

Three of their songs were also featured in the 2008 series &quot;Macross Frontier&quot;, as S.M.S. Skull Leader Ozma Lee is a fan of the band. In the second &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; movie, Ranka Lee and other SMS members acted as the cover band of Fire Bomber (titled &quot;Lovely Bomber&quot;) as part of a diversion to free Sheryl Nome from prison. 

==Fictional line-up==
* Basara Nekki – Lead vocals, guitar
* Mylene Flare Jenius – Bass, co-lead vocals
* Ray Lovelock – Keytar

==Discography==
===Albums===
* &quot;Let&#x27;s Fire!!&quot;. The first Macross 7/Fire Bomber album was released. It contains the tracks played in the first half of the TV series in more or less the order in which they appear in the episodes.
* &quot;Second Fire!&quot;. The second Fire Bomber CD. Contains the songs played in the second half of the series, including the two &quot;Let&#x27;s Bomber!&quot; video songs.
* &quot;Dynamite Fire!!&quot; The Dynamite OVA song album. Songs are in more or less the order in which they appear in the series, though there are several that are no sung in the OVA.
* &quot;Radio Fire!!&quot;. This CD contains the complete radio program from all the radio broadcasts from Elma&#x27;s radio and the Zola public radio in the Dynamite OVA. Most of the tracks on this CD are drama tracks. There are also different versions of Fire Bomber songs and songs by other artists.
* &quot;Live Fire!!&quot; (1995). A recording CD of Fire Bomber live in concert. The tracks are mostly sung by the voice actor of Basara (Hayashi Nobutoushi) and Mylene (Sakurai Tomo), not their singing voices from the anime.
* &quot;Kara-OK Fire!!&quot;. Karaoke album of most of the songs that appear in the TV series. Contains duet and guitar karaoke bonus tracks at the end for Planet Dance.
* &quot;Acoustic Fire!!&quot; The songs on this acoustic album are not quite the acoustic versions found in the anime itself. There&#x27;s more instrumentation, though little enough to be called &quot;acoustic&quot;. The album also has a more &quot;country American&quot; feel to it, since it was recorded in the US.
* &quot;Ultra Fire!!&quot; &quot;Best of&quot; Fire Bomber album.
* &quot;Galaxy Network Chart 1&quot;. A &quot;real&quot; Macross universe album containing tracks from what is probably a single week of the Galaxy Network Chart&#x27;s top 10 ratings of bands from all over the galaxy. Note that Fire Bomber has five of the ten spots.
* &quot;Galaxy Network Chart 2&quot; As above.
* &quot;Mylene Jenius Sings Lynn Minmay&quot; (1995) Two female vocalists of Macross join forces in this album. Mylene sings Minmay&#x27;s most famous songs including Ai Oboeteimasu ka? (Do You Remember Love?), the version of which appears in Fleet of the Strongest Women. The singer is not Chie Kajiura, Mylene&#x27;s series singing voice, but is instead her voice actress Sakurai Tomo.
* &quot;English Fire&quot;. All the songs on this album have been redone in English by the band &quot;Fire Bomber American&quot;. Instead of simply being English versions of Fire Bomber songs, the makers of Macross have created an English version of the band Fire Bomber. In the Macross universe, Fire Bomber American is a band on the English-speaking fleet &quot;Macross 11&quot; that claims that the Macross 7 Fire Bomber is a rip-off of it. The singers for this band are also different. According to the fictional &quot;Macross&quot; continuity Lynn Kaifun, a character from the first TV series from 1982 (who was Lynn Minmay&#x27;s cousin and also her former manager) is the creator and manager of Fire Bomber American.
* &quot;Best Collection&quot; (not an official release)
* &quot;Other Fire!!&quot; (not an official release)
* &quot;Memorial CD&quot; (not an official release)
* &quot;Seventh Moon&quot; single
* &quot;My Friends&quot; single
* &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; single
* &quot;Dynamite Explosion&quot; single
* &quot;Fukuyama Fire&quot;. On May 24, 2005, 10 years after Macross 7 aired in Japan, Yoshiki Fukuyama (singing voice for Basara) released a tribute album (&quot;Fukuyama Fire – A Tribute to Nekki Basara&quot;) in which he sings the most popular Macross 7 songs with new arrangements plus a new song.
* &quot;Re.Fire&quot;. Fifteen years after Macross 7 first aired in Japan, Fire Bomber released its newest album, &quot;Re.Fire&quot; in Japan on October 14, 2009. This new album brings 10 newly made songs, and two new versions of the hit songs &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Totsugeki Love Heart&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, crystals are Cartesian sections of certain fibered categories. They were introduced by , who named them crystals because in some sense they are &quot;rigid&quot; and &quot;grow&quot;. In particular quasicoherent crystals over the crystalline site are analogous to quasicoherent modules over a scheme. 

An isocrystal is a crystal up to isogeny. They are formula_1-adic analogues of formula_2-adic étale sheaves, introduced by and (though the definition of isocrystal only appears in part II of this paper by ). Convergent isocrystals are a variation of isocrystals that work better over non-perfect fields, and overconvergent isocrystals are another variation related to overconvergent cohomology theories.

A [[Dieudonné crystal]] is a crystal with Verschiebung and Frobenius maps. An F-crystal is a structure in semilinear algebra somewhat related to crystals.

==Crystals over the infinitesimal and crystalline sites==

The infinitesimal site formula_3 has as objects the infinitesimal extensions of open sets of formula_4.
If formula_4 is a scheme over formula_6 then the sheaf formula_7 is defined by 
formula_8 = coordinate ring of formula_9, where we write formula_9 as an abbreviation for 
an object formula_11 of formula_3. Sheaves on this site grow in the sense that they can be extended from open sets to infinitesimal extensions of open sets. 

A crystal on the site formula_3 is a sheaf formula_14 of formula_7 modules that is rigid in the following sense:
:for any map formula_16 between objects formula_9, formula_18; of formula_3, the natural map from formula_20 to formula_21 is an isomorphism.
This is similar to the definition of a quasicoherent sheaf of modules in the Zariski topology.

An example of a crystal is the sheaf formula_7.

Crystals on the crystalline site 
are defined in a similar way.

==Crystals in fibered categories==

In general, if formula_23 is a fibered category over formula_14, then a crystal is a cartesian section of the fibered category. In the special case when formula_14 is the category of infinitesimal extensions of a scheme formula_4 and formula_23 the category of quasicoherent modules over objects of formula_14, then crystals of this fibered category are the same as crystals of the infinitesimal site.

<doc id="830074" wikidata="Q4868587" url="?curid=830074" title="Batang Kali massacre">
<text>The Batang Kali massacre was the killing of 24 unarmed male civilians in Batang Kali by the British Army&#x27;s Scots Guards on 12 December 1948. The massacre took place in Batang Kali, Malaya (now Malaysia) during the Malayan Emergency, a communist insurgency involving the British Commonwealth and communist guerrillas belonging to the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA). British author Christopher Hale described the massacre as &quot;Britain&#x27;s &quot;My Lai&quot;&quot; in his book titled &quot;Massacre in Malaya: Exposing Britain&#x27;s My Lai&quot;.

The massacre was one of a number committed during the war that saw British extrajudicial killings of unarmed villagers, in violation of the Geneva Conventions, communist and trade union leaders, and the participation of British military forces in headhunting their civilian and MNLA victims.

==Background==
After World War II, the British returned to Malaya to recover control from Japanese military forces. During the war, the British government had supported the guerrillas who continued to fight against the Japanese forces. However, following VJ Day in August 1945, many resistance units did not completely disband. The groups instead became the foundation for the independence movement against British rule in Malaya. Some guerrillas turned from agitation to communism and began targeting British commercial interests in the colony by attacking rubber plantations and tin mines. By June 1948, escalating violence and the assassinations of several prominent British landowners led colonial authorities in Malaya to declare an &quot;Emergency&quot;.

That gave the Royal Malaysia Police and government greater powers and flexibility in combating the insurgents. Although the British had extensive experience in jungle warfare, most recently in the Burma Campaign during World War II, military leaders had not formalized their experience into a specific jungle warfare curriculum.

Training on soldiers&#x27; obligations under principles of international humanitarian law was minimal or even non-existent. Basic training for the troops focused on infantry skills, not their ability to judge the appropriateness of orders in the context of the law of war. The specific jungle warfare training included shooting exercises where soldiers had to quickly distinguish between &quot;enemy&quot; and &quot;friendly&quot; targets, but otherwise continued the focus on infantry skills. Michael Gilbert, a member of the Suffolk Regiment, said that his training &quot;[was] teaching you how to march, how to handle a rifle, and how to behave in a soldierly manner.&quot; Raymond Burdett, another member of the Suffolk Regiment, reflected on his experience and said that the trainers sought &quot;to get us to follow instructions, not to question commands.&quot;

The quality of officers in the Scots Guards at the time was poor, with high turnover, and some platoon commanders resented being sent to fight a colonial war when they had been trained to fight a war in Europe. The patrol that committed the massacre was led by two sergeants, one with little experience; this was deemed highly unusual by its soldiers. Further, the regimental culture of the Scots Guards looked down on patrols, and the regiment&#x27;s record of successes against the MNLA was poor before the massacre.

At the time of the massacre, no international law existed that dealt with non-international armed conflict. Two years prior to the massacre, the judges at the Nuremberg trials, which were established by the victorious Allies after World War II, stated that &quot;the laws and customs of war apply between belligerents, but not domestically&quot;. The 1949 Geneva Conventions included Common Article 3, which is a &quot;mini-convention&quot; applicable to non-international armed conflict and simply prohibits the murder of non-combatants under the physical control or custody of State or non-state forces. However, Britain ratified the Geneva Conventions in 1957, owning much of its reluctance to apply Common Article 3 to its colonial wars.

==Killings==
In December 1948, 7th Platoon, G Company, 2nd Scots Guards, surrounded a rubber plantation at Sungai Rimoh near Batang Kali in Selangor. The Guards then rounded up civilians. The Guards separated the men from the women and children for interrogation. The Scots Guards promptly massacred 24 unarmed men from the village with automatic weapons. The only adult male survivor was a man named Chong Hong, who was in his twenties. He fainted and was presumed dead. Other eyewitnesses included the victims&#x27; spouses and children, such as Tham Yong, who was 17, and Loh Ah Choy, who was about seven.

== Legacy of the massacre ==
After the massacre, British diplomats introduced Regulation 27A, which authorised &quot;the use of lethal weapons&quot; to &quot;prevent escape from arrest&quot;, in an attempt to retrospectively legalise the Scots Guards&#x27; massacre of civilians. This new regulation was uncovered within secret documents which had been hidden from public view at Hanslope Park by the Foreign Office, and was known as &quot;Regulation 27A&quot;. The UK Foreign Office and various UK governments attempted to hide the existence of the massacre by intervening to block investigations into the Batang Kali Massacre.

Despite several investigations by the British government since the 1950s, and a re-examination of the evidence by the Royal Malaysia Police between 1993 and 1997, no charges were brought against any of the alleged perpetrators. The British government has never apologised for the killings nor made any attempts to redress the massacre.

==Subsequent developments==
In 1970, the British Sunday newspaper The People published testimonies by members of the platoon that a massacre had occurred. In response the government referred the matter to the Department of Public Prosecutions, but the investigation was terminated shortly after only a few months due, according to the Director of Public Prosecutions, to a lack of documentation and the difficulty of verifying testimony about an event that had occurred twenty years prior.

On 9 September 1992, a BBC documentary, an investigative report into the massacre, &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, was aired in the United Kingdom and revealed fresh evidence. The documentary included accounts from witnesses and survivors, including confessions of an ex-Scots Guards soldier and interviews with the Scotland Yard police officers who had investigated the case.

On 8 June 1993, with the help of the MCA Legal Bureau, a petition was presented to Queen Elizabeth II asking that justice be done. On 14 July 1993 a police report was lodged by three survivors, accompanied by the MCA Public Service and Complaints Bureau Chief Michael Chong. On 18 September 1993, however, Gavin Hewitt (Head of South East Asia Department of the Foreign Office, UK) stated, &quot;No new evidence has been uncovered by the British authorities to warrant the setting up of another official inquiry into the alleged massacre of 24 villagers in Batang Kali...&quot;.

On 30 December 1997, an investigation report was submitted to the Royal Malaysian Police Jabatan Siasatan Jenayah Bukit Aman. The case was closed on the grounds of insufficient evidence for prosecution.

On 13 July 2004, the DAP, a Malaysian political party, raised the Batang Kali massacre in the Malaysian Parliament.

On 25 March 2008, the family members of the massacre victims and several NGOs formed an Action Committee Condemning the Batang Kali Massacre and submitted a petition to the British High Commission in Malaysia. The petition seeks official apology, compensation for the family members of the 24 massacre victims and financial contribution towards the educational and cultural development of the Ulu Yam community.

On 30 January 2009, the Foreign Office in Britain rejected a call for an inquiry into the massacre of villagers. On 24 April 2009, the British government announced that it was reconsidering this decision.

On 30 April 2009, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that the British government had agreed to reinvestigate the massacre.

In January 2012, lawyers for the victims and their families were given Foreign Office correspondence and Cabinet Office guidance relating to the incident.

==Judicial review==
Malaysian victims unsuccessfully petitioned Queen Elizabeth II personally to reopen an inquiry into the massacre in 1993 and in 2004. They tried again in 2008 and failed to receive a reply from the British government until 2011, when the High Court agreed to review the case.

Survivors of the Batang Kali Massacre and relatives of civilians executed by the Scots Guards started a legal battle in 2012 with against the British government over the killings. Although many of the Scots Guards who had committed the massacre were still alive, the families and survivors did not seek criminal prosecutions against individual soldiers.

One of the relatives of the victims who shared her eyewitness account was Lim Ah Yin, whose 11th birthday happened on the same day as the massacre. Her father was one of the civilians executed by the Scots Guards, and she noted that the last time she saw her father was when a Scots Guard was pointing a rifle at him and telling him to shut up. A week after the Scots Guards had shot her father dead, both she and her heavily pregnant mother were made to clean up his corpse which was bloated and covered in flies.“The bodies were covered in flies. They were bloated and swollen, lying in groups of three or four. Finally I found my father. He had been shot in the chest. That day, December 12th, had been my birthday. My mother cried almost every day. She brought me and my sister up. When the baby was born she gave it away for adoption. She only stopped crying when I married and her granddaughter was born. She was 92 when she died.&quot;British courts ruled that although the Scots Guards had massacred innocent civilians and that this was possibly a war crime committed by the British Army, they also ruled that the government was not obliged to hold a public inquiry because the massacre happened too long ago, and that due to a legal technicality nobody could be held legally responsible. This ruling was condemned by various human rights organisations and legal experts who argued that such a decision could be used to justify many historic instances of war crimes committed by the British military.

In May 2012, the judicial review on the British government&#x27;s position was held at the High Court of Justice in London. On 4 September 2012, the High Court&#x27;s judges in London upheld a government decision not to hold a public hearing into the killing. It also ruled that Britain was responsible for the killing in Batang Kali. In its written judgement, it said, &quot;There is evidence that supports a deliberate execution of the 24 civilians at Batang Kali.&quot;

In March 2014, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales announced it would make a ruling on whether a public enquiry will be held into the killings. The move was welcomed by families of the plantation workers who had died at Batang Kali. The British government had rejected calls for a public hearing, a decision that was upheld by the High Court in September 2012.

In November 2015, the United Kingdom Supreme Court ruled that the British government was not obliged to hold a public inquiry into the 1940s killing by a British army patrol of 24 Malayan villagers even though it may have been a war crime, because the atrocity was committed too long ago. An appeal to the European Court of Human Rights failed when the case was ruled inadmissible on essentially the same grounds in October 2018.

<doc id="830110" wikidata="Q982783" url="?curid=830110" title="Seatbelts (band)">
<text>is a Japanese band led by composer and instrumentalist Yoko Kanno. An international ensemble comprising both a stable lineup of musicians and various collaborators, the band was assembled by Kanno in 1998 to perform the soundtrack music for the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; anime series. Their repertoire covered and blended many different genres, mainly jazz, but also a wide variety of rock, electronic, funk, blues, orchestral pop and other styles of genres.

==Band history==
The name of the band, according to the fictional description given in their first album &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, derives from how the performers wear seatbelts to be safe while they play hardcore jam sessions.

The band performed the entire soundtrack of the anime series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; and produced a total of seven albums (three new songs in &quot;Cowboy Bebop Tank! THE! BEST!&quot;) and one live DVD.

The band performed virtually in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 to participate in new projects. In collaboration with Funimation, Sunrise, and composer Mason Lieberman, the band rerecorded the ending theme of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;The Real Folk Blues&quot; to raise proceeds for COVID-19 relief.

In addition, the band began the Session Starducks project on a newly founded YouTube channel in April 2020. In collaboration with different musicians as well as with the original members of the band, the project recorded new interpretations of various compositions. These include songs from &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&quot; and &quot;Macross Frontier&quot;.

It was confirmed in April 2020 that Kanno would be returning to compose the upcoming live-action adaption of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; for Netflix. It was later confirmed in November 2021 that the Seatbelts were to perform the music for the new adaptation.

<doc id="830137" wikidata="Q962197" url="?curid=830137" title="Carl Craig">
<text>Carl Craig (born May 22, 1969) is an American electronic music producer, DJ, and founder of the record label Planet E Communications. He is known as a leading figure and pioneer in the second wave of Detroit techno artists during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He has recorded under his given name in addition to a variety of aliases, including Psyche, BFC, and Innerzone Orchestra.

Craig&#x27;s early releases were collected on the 1996 compilation &quot;Elements 1989-1990&quot;. He has released several studio albums, beginning with &quot;Landcruising&quot; (1995). Craig has also remixed a variety of artists including Manuel Göttsching, Maurizio, Theo Parrish, Tori Amos, and Depeche Mode. He was nominated for the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording for his remix of the Junior Boys track &quot;Like a Child.&quot; He has released collaborative recordings with Moritz von Oswald (2008&#x27;s &quot;Recomposed&quot;) and Green Velvet (2015&#x27;s &quot;Unity&quot;).

==Early life==
Carl Craig was born in Detroit, Michigan, on May 22, 1969. His mother was a teacher&#x27;s assistant and his father was a post office worker. He attended Cooley High School, where he developed an interest in music. He learned to play guitar and later became interested in club music through his cousin Doug Craig, who worked lighting for Detroit area parties. After hearing Derrick May&#x27;s radio show on WJLB, Craig began experimenting with recording on a dual-deck cassette player. Craig met someone who knew May and passed along a tape of some of his home studio productions.

==Career==
Since 1989, Craig has released many recordings under a large number of aliases, including Psyche, BFC, 69, Paperclip People, and Innerzone Orchestra. Many of these early Psyche and BFC releases were collected on the 1996 compilation &quot;Elements 1989–1990&quot;. Craig founded his own record label called Planet E Communications in 1991. Since then, it has released records by other artists such as Kevin Saunderson, Moodymann, and Kenny Larkin.

His first studio album, &quot;Landcruising&quot;, was released on Blanco y Negro Records in 1995. In 1996, he released &quot;The Secret Tapes of Doctor Eich&quot; under the Paperclip People moniker. In 1997, he released &quot;More Songs About Food and Revolutionary Art&quot;. It was placed at number 29 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s &quot;50 Best IDM Albums of All Time&quot; list. In 1999, he released &quot;Programmed&quot; under the Innerzone Orchestra moniker.

Craig served as co-creator and artistic director for the Detroit Electronic Music Festival in 2000 and 2001. His subsequent dismissal by festival organizers caused substantial controversy within the Detroit techno community, igniting a high-profile campaign in his favor. In 2001, he filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against festival producer Pop Culture Media.

He released a reworked version of &quot;Landcruising&quot;, titled &quot;The Album Formerly Known As...&quot;, in 2005. In 2008, he released a collaborative album with Moritz Von Oswald, titled &quot;Recomposed&quot;, on Deutsche Grammophon. He returned as artistic director for the 2010 Detroit Electronic Music Festival. In 2015, he released a collaborative album with Green Velvet, titled &quot;Unity&quot;, on Relief Records. In 2017, he released &quot;Versus&quot; on InFiné.

Craig created a sound installation, titled &quot;Party/After-Party&quot;, which opened at the Dia Beacon art museum in March 2020. The culmination of a five-year-long engagement with Dia Beacon, it was his first foray into the art world. In 2023 the installation was brought to The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA, Los Angeles and the exhibition was accompanied by Party/After-Party Sessions, a series of three live concerts that were including DJs and electronic musicians DJ Holographic, Felix Da Housecat, King Britt, Moodymann, Kenny Larkin. 

==Style and legacy==
&quot;Mixmag&quot; called Carl Craig &quot;a leading figure in Detroit techno&#x27;s second generation,&quot; while &quot;Exclaim!&quot; called him a &quot;central figure&quot; in the genre&#x27;s second wave. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described him as &quot;techno pioneer.&quot; He has approached techno using inspiration from a wide range of musical genres, including soul, jazz, new wave, industrial, and krautrock, while his works have spanned ambient techno, breakbeat, house, classical, and modular synthesizer-based stylings. In a 2015 interview, he cited The Electrifying Mojo, Prince, Kraftwerk, Juan Atkins, and Jeff Mills as the major influences on his music.

Craig&#x27;s 1992 track &quot;Bug in the Bassbin&quot;, released under the Innerzone Orchestra moniker, was picked up by DJs such as 4hero, Goldie, and J Majik. In the United Kingdom, DJs started playing the track at 45 rpm instead of the intended 33 rpm. According to &quot;Now&quot;, the track &quot;ended up providing inspiration and in many ways writing the blueprint for what drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass was to become in England.&quot;

According to &quot;Vinyl Me, Please&quot;, Craig &quot;managed to not only push the boundaries of Detroit techno, he also introduced an urgency and melodic richness to the sometimes navel-gazing world of IDM&quot; with releases such as &quot;More Songs About Food and Revolutionary Art&quot; (1997).

<doc id="830156" wikidata="Q1631609" url="?curid=830156" title="Savile Row">
<text>Savile Row (pronounced ) is a street in Mayfair, central London. Known principally for its traditional bespoke tailoring for men, the street has had a varied history that has included accommodating the headquarters of the Royal Geographical Society at 1 Savile Row, where significant British explorations to Africa and the South Pole were planned; and more recently, the Apple office of the Beatles at 3 Savile Row, where the band&#x27;s final live performance was held on the roof of the building.

Originally named Savile Street, it was built between 1731 and 1735 as part of the development of the Burlington Estate. It was designed under the influence of Burlington&#x27;s interpretation of Palladian architecture, known as &quot;Burlingtonian&quot;. Henry Flitcroft, under the supervision of Daniel Garrett, appears to have been the main architect – though 1 and 22–23 Savile Row were designed by William Kent. Initially, the street was occupied mainly by military officers and their wives; later William Pitt the Younger and Irish-born playwright and MP Richard Brinsley Sheridan were residents.

Tailors started doing business in the area in the late 18th century; first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. In 1846, Henry Poole, later credited as the creator of the dinner jacket, opened an entrance to Savile Row from his tailoring premises in Old Burlington Street. Founded in 1849 by Henry Huntsman, H. Huntsman &amp; Sons moved to No. 11 Savile Row with the ending of the war in 1919. During the First World War, Huntsman&#x27;s was a tailor to the military, producing dress uniforms for British officers. In 1969, Nutters of Savile Row modernised the style and approach of traditional Savile Row tailoring; a modernisation that continued into the 1990s with the &quot;New Bespoke Movement&quot;, involving the designers Richard James, Ozwald Boateng, and Timothy Everest. The term &quot;bespoke&quot; as applied to fine tailoring is understood to have originated in Savile Row, and came to mean a suit cut and made by hand.

Savile Row runs parallel to Regent Street between Conduit Street at the northern end and Vigo Street with Burlington Gardens at the southern. Linking roads include New Burlington Street, Boyle Street, and Clifford Street. The freehold is owned by the Pollen Estate. In 2016 Westminster City Council commenced attempts to protect the street&#x27;s tailoring heritage under the Savile Row SPA (Special Policy Area). In 2014, Norway&#x27;s Oil Fund, the world&#x27;s largest sovereign wealth fund, acquired a 57.8% interest in the Pollen Estate from The Church Commissioners. This includes properties in Mayfair, among which is Savile Row.

== History ==
The first house in what would become Savile Row was &quot;a fine House and Ground&quot;, built in 1674 on the site of what is now No. 1, and occupied by a series of nobles until it was demolished in 1730 in preparation for the laying out of the houses on the east of Savile Row in 1731. Savile Row was built between 1731 and 1735, on freehold land known as Ten Acres belonging to a merchant tailor, William Maddox, as part of the development of the Burlington Estate, and is named after Lady Dorothy Savile, wife of the 3rd Earl of Burlington. Maddox&#x27;s land, consisting mainly of fruit and other trees covering what would become Savile Row and the streets around, some of which is still owned by his descendants as the Pollen Estate. When initially laid out – under the name Saville Street – Savile Row ran from Burlington Gardens (then Vigo Lane) to Boyle Street, with houses only on the east side, but in the 19th century, houses were built on the west side.

===Nineteenth century===
Initially, the street was occupied by military officers and their wives, along with politicians: William Pitt the Younger wrote letters from the street when it was called Savile Street; Irish-born playwright and MP, Richard Brinsley Sheridan lived at 14 Savile Row in 1813–16, till his death. Jules Verne had Phileas Fogg, his lead character in &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, live at 7 Savile Row – a &quot;fashionable address&quot; and &quot;the former home of Sheridan&quot;. It may have been the affluent and influential nature of the residents of Savile Row that first attracted dealers in luxury goods to the area.

Tailors started to take premises around Savile Row in the late 18th century, first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. In 1846, Henry Poole, credited as creator of the dinner jacket or tuxedo, opened an entrance at 37 Savile Row from his late father&#x27;s tailoring premises at 4 Old Burlington Street. As tailoring moved into the street, the house frontages were altered to bring natural light into the tailors&#x27; working area with the addition of glass frontages and lightwells. The houses have been much altered over time; the original Burlingtonian design has been mostly lost, though No. 14 still retains much of the original external features.

===Royal Geographical Society===
The Royal Geographical Society occupied No. 1 from 1870 to 1912, from where significant British exploration was planned, including into Asia, Africa, and the South Pole; and, according to the society, the address &quot;became associated with adventure and travel&quot;. David Livingstone was laid out in state at the society&#x27;s headquarters, before being buried in Westminster Abbey. In 1871, shortly after the Royal Geographical Society moved into Savile Row, so did the Savile Club; a gentlemen&#x27;s club founded in 1868 as the New Club, occupying rooms overlooking Trafalgar Square; it changed to its current name during its residence at 12 Savile Row, retaining the name when it moved in 1882 to premises in Piccadilly.

===Twentieth century===
Savile Row was extended to Conduit Street in 1937–38, and by 1939, the Metropolitan Police Station was constructed on the corner of Boyle Street. This police station was damaged in another German bombing raid in September 1940, during which the building opposite, No. 21a, was destroyed, as was No. 7 earlier that month. Fortress House, an eight-storey block of offices faced with Portland stone, was constructed at 23 Savile Row in 1949-50 and occupied by a series of government ministries, ending with a long period of occupation by English Heritage until 2006. It was demolished in 2009 and replaced by a new mixed-use development designed by Eric Parry, Architects.

In July 1968, the Beatles moved Apple Corps, their multimedia corporation, into 3 Savile Row. Apple purchased the building on June22 for half-a-million pounds (). A studio was built in the basement; though it was poorly designed, the Beatles recorded &quot;Let It Be&quot; there before a new studio was constructed in 1971 at an estimated cost of $1.5 million. Various artists, including Badfinger, Mary Hopkin, and Marc Bolan recorded in the basement studio until it closed in May 1975. The Beatles&#x27; final live performance, known as the &quot;rooftop concert&quot;, was held on the roof of the building, on 30 January 1969, and was recorded for the documentary film &quot;Let It Be&quot;; the last words of the band, spoken by John Lennon as the police stopped the performance, were &quot;I hope we passed the audition.&quot;

In 1969, Nutters of Savile Row modernised the style and approach of the traditional tailors; a modernisation which continued in the 1990s with the &quot;New Bespoke Movement&quot;, involving the designers Richard James, Ozwald Boateng, and Timothy Everest. With increasing rents and criticisms from Giorgio Armani of falling behind the times, the number of tailors in Savile Row had declined to 19 in 2006, from approximately 40 in the 1950s. However, tailoring businesses have increased since 2006; as of October 2014, a local online directory listed 44 tailoring and clothing businesses on and around Savile Row. Some tailors had expressed concern in 2005 that an increase in commercial development in the area could lead to the death of the business locally, as tailors, many of whom traditionally manufacture their suits in their premises, in basement studios, could be priced out of the local property market. The Savile Row Bespoke Association was founded in 2004 to protect and develop bespoke tailoring as practised in Savile Row and the surrounding streets. The member tailors are typically required to put at least 50 hours of hand labour into each two-piece suit. The Association, along with the owners, the Pollen Estate, is working in partnership with Westminster Council to protect the street&#x27;s tailoring heritage under the Savile Row SPA (Special Policy Area).

The Association objected to the American retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch&#x27;s plan to open a children&#x27;s store at 3 Savile Row, concerned that chain stores entering the street would drive up rents, and took part in, what was then, a successful protest in 2012. However, A&amp;F were allowed to move in and set up a children&#x27;s store in 2013, although it has since closed.

Starting in 1946, 14 Savile Row was the home of Hardy Amies which changed ownership several times over the course of its history. In 2018, the company went into administration for a second time, and was attempting to sell its assets in 2019. The Savile Row store was closed in March 2019 and the space taken over by Hackett in June as its flagship store.

==Architecture==
The original architectural plan for Savile Row is believed to have been drawn up by Colen Campbell, with Henry Flitcroft as the main architect of the street, under the supervision of Daniel Garrett; though 1 and 22–23 Savile Row were designed by William Kent, who moved into No. 2. These architects were all under the influence of Burlington&#x27;s interpretation of Palladian architecture, known as &quot;Burlingtonian&quot;, which was to have some influence on English architecture in the 16th century. As tailoring moved into the street, the house frontages were altered to bring natural light into the tailors&#x27; working area with the addition of glass frontages and light wells. The houses have been much altered over time; the original Burlingtonian design has been mostly lost, though No. 14 still retains much of the original external features. When the Royal Geographical Society occupied No. 1, they built a glass-roofed map-room in the courtyard, a small astronomical observatory on the roof, and a new portico – which may be the basis for the current appearance of the façade.

Several of the buildings on Savile Row are listed on the National Heritage List for England; 1 Savile Row (6A Vigo Street) is listed Grade II, 3 Savile Row is listed II*, 12, 12A and 13 are listed II as a group, 14 is listed Grade II*, 17 is listed Grade II, 16 is listed Grade II, and 11 is listed II*.

==Tailoring ==


Savile Row&#x27;s reputation is built on bespoke tailoring, where each suit is made to individually fit. The term &quot;bespoke&quot;, which has an etymology developing from &quot;to exclaim&quot; through &quot;discussed in advance&quot; and is generally understood to mean &quot;made to order&quot;, became associated with fine tailoring, with tailors claiming that the term has been in common use for tailoring since the 17th century. Savile Row tailors argue that &quot;bespoke&quot;, in relation to tailoring, is understood to mean a suit cut and made by hand; however, after a ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority in 2008, the term may now also be applied to machine sewed garments, provided they are made-to-measure.

Customers of the &quot;golden mile of tailoring&quot; have included Lord Nelson, Napoleon III, Winston Churchill, Charles III, and Jude Law. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, used to order his suits from Savile Row. Although it is sometimes reported that Ian Fleming and his character James Bond bought suits in Savile Row, there is no evidence for this in the novels; both Fleming and the Bond film character wore suits designed by non-Savile Row tailors, in particular Anthony Sinclair of nearby Conduit Street.

Tailors, attracted by the affluent and influential nature of the residents of Savile Row, started to open businesses in the area in the late 18th century, first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. None of those original tailors survive today, though Henry Poole &amp; Co, who through Edward VII&#x27;s patronage, helped make the street fashionable, still have a presence in Savile Row. Poole moved the company into 32 Savile Row in 1846, following the death of his father James Poole, and the company is now at No. 15. Henry Poole is credited as creator of the dinner jacket, when he made a smoking jacket for the young Edward VII in 1860.
Tailoring was softened in the early 20th century by Dutch tailor Frederick Scholte when he developed the English drape for the Duke of Windsor. Scholte&#x27;s &quot;dress soft&quot; style was developed into the &quot;London cut&quot;, the house style of Anderson &amp; Sheppard, by Per Anderson, a protégé of Sholte. The &quot;London cut&quot; is a high small armhole with a generous upper sleeve that permits the jacket to remain close to the neck while freeing the arm to move with comfort.

Though the reputation of tailoring on Savile Row is for bespoke suits, ready-to-wear clothes were introduced by Gieves &amp; Hawkes, a company formed in 1974 by the merger of two separate businesses who both date from the late 19th century: Gieves, a Royal Navy tailor founded in Portsmouth; and Hawkes, a London-based cap-maker and tailor to the British Army. Hardy Amies Ltd further broadened the scope and appeal of tailoring in Savile Row: in 1961, he staged the first men&#x27;s ready-to-wear catwalk shows, at the Ritz Hotel in London, he designed costumes for the 1966 England World Cup team, and for the 1968 film &quot;2001: Space Odyssey&quot;, and dressed the Queen, designing the gown used for the Silver Jubilee portrait in 1977. Hardy Amies founded the company in 1946, converting the bombed out shell of No. 14. Amies sold the business to the Luxury Brands Group and retired in 2001, but it went into administration in 2008 when it was bought by Fung Capital. It went back into administration in 2018 but on this occasion no buyer was found and the House was closed.
Modernisation of tailoring continued in 1969 with Nutters of Savile Row. Nutters of Savile Row was opened on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1969 by Tommy Nutter and Edward Sexton, who had worked together at Donaldson, Williamson &amp; Ward. Financially backed by Cilla Black and Peter Brown of the Beatles Apple Corps, Nutters used bold window displays, created by the then unknown Simon Doonan; and clients included the Beatles, Mick Jagger, Elton John, and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Nutter left the company in 1976 and went to work at Kilgour. He died in 1992. However, Terry Haste, cutter at Tommy Nutter, continues with John Kent (holder of the Royal Warrant for the Duke of Edinburgh) nearby at 7 Sackville Street.

Modernisation had slowed by the early 1990s; Savile Row tailors were &quot;struggling to find relevance with an audience that had grown increasingly disassociated&quot;. Three tailors, Ozwald Boateng, Timothy Everest (an apprentice of Nutter&#x27;s), and Richard James, then became known for revitalising the bespoke style for the modern market - having each broken away independently from the Savile Row mould. Public relations professional Alison Hargreaves coined the term &quot;New Bespoke Movement&quot; to describe collectively the work of this &quot;new generation&quot; of tailors. Interest reached a peak in 1997 when the three were featured together in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. The newcomers altered their shop fronts and used marketing and publicity to their advantage; challenging the traditional Savile Row styling, they brought twists and &quot;a fine sense of colour to bespoke suits.&quot; They were seen to &quot;push the envelope of modern suit making and bespoke active wear, creating more contemporary silhouettes with bolder fabrics,&quot; and set out to attract celebrity clients, sell their clothing via supermarket chains, and attract wider national and international custom, raising the profile of their new tailoring style.

<doc id="830206" wikidata="Q1261114" url="?curid=830206" title="Magnetic amplifier">
<text>The magnetic amplifier (colloquially known as a &quot;mag amp&quot;) is an electromagnetic device for amplifying electrical signals. The magnetic amplifier was invented early in the 20th century, and was used as an alternative to vacuum tube amplifiers where robustness and high current capacity were required. World War II Germany perfected this type of amplifier, and it was used in the V-2 rocket. The magnetic amplifier was most prominent in power control and low-frequency signal applications from 1947 to about 1957, when the transistor began to supplant it. The magnetic amplifier has now been largely superseded by the transistor-based amplifier, except in a few safety critical, high-reliability or extremely demanding applications. Combinations of transistor and mag-amp techniques are still used.

== Principle of operation ==

Visually a mag amp device may resemble a transformer, but the operating principle is quite different from a transformer – essentially the mag amp is a saturable reactor. It makes use of magnetic saturation of the core, a non-linear property of a certain class of transformer cores. For controlled saturation characteristics, the magnetic amplifier employs core materials that have been designed to have a specific B-H curve shape that is highly rectangular, in contrast to the slowly tapering B-H curve of softly saturating core materials that are often used in normal transformers.

The typical magnetic amplifier consists of two physically separate but similar transformer magnetic cores, each of which has two windings: a control winding and an AC winding. Another common design uses a single core shaped like the number &quot;8&quot; with one control winding and two AC windings as shown in the photo above. A small DC current from a low-impedance source is fed into the control winding. The AC windings may be connected either in series or in parallel, the configurations resulting in different types of mag amps. The amount of control current fed into the control winding sets the point in the AC winding waveform at which either core will saturate. In saturation, the AC winding on the saturated core will go from a high-impedance state (&quot;off&quot;) into a very low-impedance state (&quot;on&quot;) – that is, the control current controls the point at which voltage the mag amp switches &quot;on&quot;.

A relatively small DC current on the control winding is able to control or switch large AC currents on the AC windings. This results in current amplification.

Two magnetic cores are used because the AC current will generate high voltage in the control windings. By connecting them in opposite phase, the two cancel each other, so that no current is induced in the control circuit. The alternate design shown above with the &quot;8&quot; shaped core accomplishes this same objective magnetically.

== Strengths ==
The magnetic amplifier is a static device with no moving parts. It has no wear-out mechanism and has a good tolerance to mechanical shock and vibration. It requires no warm-up time.
Multiple isolated signals may be summed by additional control windings on the magnetic cores. The windings of a magnetic amplifier have a higher tolerance to momentary overloads than comparable solid-state devices. The magnetic amplifier is also used as a transducer in applications such as current measurement and the flux gate compass. The reactor cores of magnetic amplifiers withstand neutron radiation extremely well. For this special reason magnetic amplifiers have been used in nuclear power applications.

==Limitations==
The gain available from a single stage is limited and low compared to electronic amplifiers. Frequency response of a high-gain amplifier is limited to about one-tenth the excitation frequency, although this is often mitigated by exciting magnetic amplifiers with currents at higher than utility frequency. Solid-state electronic amplifiers can be more compact and efficient than magnetic amplifiers. The bias and feedback windings are not unilateral and may couple energy back from the controlled circuit into the control circuit. This complicates the design of multistage amplifiers when compared with electronic devices.

 Magnetic amplifiers introduce substantial harmonic distortion to the output waveform consisting entirely of the odd harmonics. Unlike the silicon controlled rectifiers or TRIACs which replaced them, the magnitude of these harmonics decreases rapidly with frequency so interference with nearby electronic devices such as radio receivers is uncommon.

== Applications ==
Magnetic amplifiers were important as modulation and control amplifiers in the early development of voice transmission by radio. A magnetic amplifier was used as voice modulator for a 2 kilowatt Alexanderson alternator, and magnetic amplifiers were used in the keying circuits of large high-frequency alternators used for radio communications. Magnetic amplifiers were also used to regulate the speed of Alexanderson alternators to maintain the accuracy of the transmitted radio frequency. Magnetic amplifiers were used to control large high-power alternators by turning them on and off for telegraphy or to vary the signal for voice modulation. The alternator&#x27;s frequency limits were rather low to where a frequency multiplier had to be utilized to generate higher radio frequencies than the alternator was capable of producing. Even so, early magnetic amplifiers incorporating powdered-iron cores were incapable of producing radio frequencies above approximately 200 kHz. Other core materials, such as ferrite cores and oil-filled transformers, would have to be developed to allow the amplifier to produce higher frequencies.

The ability to control large currents with small control power made magnetic amplifiers useful for control of lighting circuits, for stage lighting and for advertising signs. Saturable reactor amplifiers were used for control of power to industrial furnaces. Magnetic amplifiers as variable AC voltage controllers have been mostly replaced by silicon controlled rectifiers or TRIACs. Magnetic amplifiers are still used in some arc welders.

Small magnetic amplifiers were used for radio tuning indicators, control of small motor and cooling fan speed, control of battery chargers.

Magnetic amplifiers were used extensively as the switching element in early switched-mode (SMPS) power supplies, as well as in lighting control. Semiconductor-based solid-state switches have largely superseded them, though recently there has been some regained interest in using mag amps in compact and reliable switching power supplies. PC ATX power supplies often use mag amps for secondary side voltage regulation. Cores designed specifically for switch mode power supplies are currently manufactured by several large electromagnetics companies, including Metglas and Mag-Inc.

Magnetic amplifiers were used by locomotives to detect wheel slip, until replaced by Hall effect current transducers. The cables from two traction motors passed through the core of the device. During normal operation the resultant flux was zero as both currents were the same and in opposite directions. The currents would differ during wheel slip, producing a resultant flux that acted as the Control winding, developing a voltage across a resistor in series with the AC winding which was sent to the wheel slip correction circuits.

Magnetic amplifiers can be used for measuring high DC-voltages without direct connection to the high voltage and are therefore still used in the HVDC-technique. The current to be measured is passed through the two cores, possibly by a solid bus bar. There is almost no voltage drop in this bus bar. The output signal, proportional to the ampere turns in the control current bus bar, is derived from the alternating excitation voltage of the magnetic amplifier, there is no voltage created or induced on the bus bar. The output signal has only a magnetic connection with the bus bar so the bus may be, quite safely, at any (EHT) voltage with respect to the instrumentation.

Instrumentation magnetic amplifiers are commonly found on space craft where a clean electromagnetic environment is highly desirable. 

The German Kriegsmarine made extensive use of the magnetic amplifiers. They were used for the master stable element systems, for slow moving transmission for controlling guns, directors and rangefinders and train and elevation controls. Magnetic amplifiers were used in aircraft systems (avionics) before the advent of high reliability semiconductors. They were important in implementing early autoland systems and Concorde made use of the technology for the control of its engine air intakes before development of a system using digital electronics. Magnetic amplifiers were used in stabilizer controls of V2 rockets.

===Usage in computing===

Magnetic amplifiers were widely studied during the 1950s as a potential switching element for mainframe computers. Like transistors, mag amps were somewhat smaller than the typical vacuum tube, and had the significant advantage that they were not subject to &quot;burning out&quot; and thus had dramatically lower maintenance requirements. Another advantage is that a single mag amp could be used to sum several inputs in a single core, which was useful in the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) as it could greatly reduce the component count. Custom tubes could do the same, but transistors could not, so the mag amp was able to combine the advantages of tubes and transistors in an era when the latter were expensive and unreliable.

The principles of magnetic amplifiers were applied non linearly to create magnetic digital logic gates. That era was short, lasting from the mid-1950s to about 1960, when new fabrication techniques produced great improvements in transistors and dramatically lowered their cost. Only one large-scale mag amp machine was put into production, the UNIVAC Solid State, but a number of contemporary late-1950s/early-1960s computers used the technology, like the Ferranti Sirius, Ferranti Orion and the English Electric KDF9, or the one-off MAGSTEC.

== History ==

===Early development===

A voltage source and a series connected variable resistor may be regarded as a direct current signal source for a low resistance load such as the control coil of a saturable reactor which amplifies the signal. Thus, in principle, a saturable reactor is already an amplifier, although before 20th century they were used for simple tasks, such as controlling lighting and electrical machinery as early as 1885.

In 1904 radio pioneer Reginald Fessenden placed an order for a high frequency rotary mechanical alternator from the General Electric Company capable of generate AC at a frequency of 100 kHz to be used for continuous wave radio transmission over great distances. The design job was given to General Electric engineer Ernst F. Alexanderson who developed the 2 kW Alexanderson alternator. By 1916 Alexanderson added a magnetic amplifier to control the transmission of these rotary alternators for transoceanic radio communication.

The experimental telegraphy and telephony demonstrations made during 1917 attracted the attention of the US Government, especially in light of partial failures in the transoceanic cable across the Atlantic Ocean. The 50 kW alternator was commandeered by the US Navy and put into service in January 1918 and was used until 1920, when a 200 kW generator-alternator set was built and installed.

===Usage in electric power generation===
Magnetic amplifiers were extensively used in electricity power generation from the early 1960s onwards. They provided the small signal amplification for generator automatic voltage regulation (AVR) from a small error signal at milliwatt (mW) level to 100 kilowatt (kW) level. This was in turn converted by a rotating machine (exciter) to 5 megawatt (MW) level, the excitation power required by a typical 500 MW Power Plant Turbine Generator Unit. They proved durable and reliable. Many are recorded in service through the mid-1990s and some are still in use at older generating stations, notably in hydroelectric plants operating in northern California.

== Misnomer uses ==

In the 1970s, Robert Carver designed and produced several high quality high-powered audio amplifiers, calling them magnetic amplifiers. In fact, they were in most respects conventional audio amplifier designs with unusual power supply circuits. They were not magnetic amplifiers as defined in this article. They should not be confused with real magnetic audio amplifiers.

<doc id="830227" wikidata="Q17397" url="?curid=830227" title="Aqua (satellite)">
<text>Aqua (EOS PM-1) is a NASA scientific research satellite in orbit around the Earth, studying the precipitation, evaporation, and cycling of water. It is the second major component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) preceded by Terra (launched 1999) and followed by Aura (launched 2004).

The name &quot;Aqua&quot; comes from the Latin word for water. The satellite was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on May 4, 2002, aboard a Delta II rocket. Aqua operated in a Sun-synchronous orbit as the third in the satellite formation called the &quot;A Train&quot; with several other satellites (OCO-2, the Japanese GCOM W1, PARASOL, CALIPSO, CloudSat, and Aura) for most of its first 20 years; but in January 2022 Aqua left the A-Train (as Cloud Sat, CALIPSO and PARASOL had already done) when, due to its fuel limitations, it transitioned to a free-drift mode, wherein its equatorial crossing time is slowly drifting to later times, from its tightly controlled orbit.

==Mission==
Aqua is one of NASA&#x27;s missions for Earth science operating in the A-Train constellation. It has demonstrated a very high level of precision in making the primary long-term measurements of the mission. These highly calibrated climate quality measurements of radiance, reflectance, and backscatter have been used to cross-calibrate past and present sensors launched by NASA, as well as a variety of sensors launched from other agencies and the international community. Thousands of scientists and operational users from around the world have made use of the Aqua data to address NASA&#x27;s 6 interdisciplinary Earth science focus areas: Atmospheric Composition, Weather, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems, Water and Energy Cycle, Climate Variability and Change, and Earth Surface and Interior.

Aqua has experienced some minor, non-mission ending anomalies.

Because of a 2007 anomaly with the Solid State Recorder (SSR) it can only hold two orbits worth of data. A series of solar array and array regulator electronics anomalies starting in 2010 has led to the loss of 23 strings of solar cells out of a total of 132 strings. A 2005 short circuit within a battery cell led to a partial loss of cell capacity. In 2009, a solar panel thermistor failed and an error in the Solar Array offset was detected. The offset issue has been corrected periodically since then. On September 8, 2007, the Dual Thruster Module (DTM-2) Heater experienced an anomaly. On August 16, 2020, The Formatter Multiplexer Unit (FMU) experienced an anomaly, corrupting some data in the SSR and stopping all data streams until it was recovered on September 2, 2020.

The current end of mission plan is to let Aqua&#x27;s orbit decay naturally at least until June 2024 and continue data collection into 2026
or even 2027, dependent on such items as budget, fuel, hardware, power, and end-of mission requirements. Aqua&#x27;s life could be extended with a possible re-fueling mission. A worst-case scenario would result in a re-entry by 2046.

==Instruments==

Aqua carries six instruments for studies of water on the Earth&#x27;s surface and in the atmosphere, of which four are still operating:
*Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) — measures cloud properties, sea surface temperature, near-surface wind speed, radiative energy flux, surface water, ice and snow. Furnished by the National Space Development Agency of Japan. The AMSR-E instrument had over 480 pounds of spinning mass, and the lubricant in the bearing assembly gradually deteriorated over the course of the mission. By 2007, there was a noticeable increase in motor current. This led to the development of new contingency procedures in case of high current or torque, which were put in place in 2011. In October 2011, the instrument began to cause yaw vibrations in the spacecraft that exceeded torque limits and on October 4, 2011, was automatically slowed to 4 rpm from the normal 40 rpm and then, because it could not maintain 4 rpm, was slowed to a stop. A recovery procedure was developed and tested through 2012, culminating with a December 4, 2012 successful acceleration to 2.0767 rpm to allow for cross-calibration with the AMSR-2 instrument launched in 2012 aboard the GCOM-W1 satellite. On December 4, 2015, AMSR-E was slowed to a stop and then on March 3, 2016, it was turned off.
*Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) — also measures cloud properties and radiative energy flux, also aerosol properties; land cover and land use change, fires and volcanoes. An identical MODIS instrument is also aboard Terra. As of 2017, some degradation of channels in the MODIS short wave visible bands has been observed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG).
*Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-A) — measures atmospheric temperature and humidity. Since launch, AMSU has lost 5 of 15 channels. Power to the AMSU-A2 microwave instrument was lost at 19:47 UT September 24, 2016. This caused the loss of Channels 1 and 2. All recovery attempts were unsuccessful and no further recovery attempts are planned.
*Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) — measures atmospheric temperature and humidity, land and sea surface temperatures. Cooler A telemetry became frozen on March 24, 2014, but this had no impact on science gathering. On September 25, 2016, Cooler-A experienced a shut down anomaly. Anomaly recovery occurred two days later and also cleared a condition that had disabled Cooler-A telemetry since the 2014 Cooler-A anomaly.
*Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB) — VHF band equipment measuring atmospheric humidity. Furnished by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais of Brazil. The HSB instrument has been in survival mode, and thus non-operational, since February 5, 2003, when the scan mirror motor failed.
*Clouds and the Earth&#x27;s Radiant Energy System (CERES) — Flying Modules 3 and 4, measure broadband radiative energy flux. CERES&#x27; shortwave channel on module 4 failed on March 30, 2005, but its two other channels remain operational.

The Aqua spacecraft has a mass of about , plus propellant of about at launch. Stowed for launch, the satellite fit in a volume of 2.68 m x 2.49 m x 6.49 m. Deployed, Aqua is 4.81 m x 16.70 m x 8.04 m.

<doc id="830429" wikidata="Q4834348" url="?curid=830429" title="B105 FM">
<text>B105 (call sign 4BBB) is a commercial FM radio station broadcasting in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, on a frequency of 105.3 MHz, and is part of Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s Hit Network. The station has undergone numerous branding changes over the years; it was branded as B105 following its conversion from AM to FM. This lasted until a co-branding as Hit 105.3 B105, then as Hit B105 (dropping the &quot;B&quot; shortly after) and finally back to B105 in July 2020.

==History==
The station began life as 4BK, commencing transmission in 1930 on the AM band, initially on the frequency 1290 kHz before changing to 1300 kHz on 1 Sep 1935 (to accord with the new Australian 10 kHz channel spacing raster). Again the implementation by Australia of the 9 kHz channel spacing raster developed by the ITU and formalised in the 1975 Geneva Plan necessitated 4BK moving to 1296 kHz on 23 November 1978.

In 1988, the Austereo group purchased the station from Hoyts, intending to use it as a vehicle to bid for an FM conversion licence. Austereo won the FM licence, and in February 1990, the station changed its callsign to 4BBB (not used on-air except during test broadcasts, unlike the previous AM callsign) and commenced broadcasting on a frequency of 105.3 MHz with the on-air name B105.

Between March 1990 until 2006 it was the highest rating station in Brisbane, except in one ratings survey in 1994, beaten by AM station 4KQ.

In April 2011 the Austereo Group was purchased by Southern Cross Media for more than $700 million, and is now operated under the name Southern Cross Austereo.

On 6 March 2015, B105 rebranded as Hit 105. On 27 July 2020, Hit 105 rebranded back to B105.

==Studios==
The 4BK studio complex, an AM radio facility was located at 16 Campbell Street Bowen Hills. When the FM conversion license was granted, the Austereo group converted the premises to an FM facility and began broadcasting as B105 FM in 1990.

The B105 studio complex remained at the Bowen Hills location until July 2000, when Austereo relocated B105 and sister station Triple M into new combined premises at 309 North Quay, Brisbane. The new complex was the first in Australia to use the now defunct Klotz Digital audio system, which was revolutionary at the time however was replaced during a 2016 studio upgrade with Axia Fusion.

In June 2019, B105 moved from North Quay into new studios at The Barracks on Petrie Terrace.

==Transmission==

4BBB&#x27;s FM transmission has always emanated from the TVQ Ten tower at Mount Coot-tha, Brisbane. The station originally used two Harris HT10 tube transmitters in an A/B failsafe configuration to deliver the service. In 2002 a new solid state Harris Z10CD transmitter was installed at the newly created TX Australia facility, located under the TVQ Ten tower. The existing HT10 transmitter now serves as a backup facility located at the BTQ Seven tower, away from Channel Ten on Mount Coot-tha. 
B105&#x27;s service is licensed for 12kW Effective Radiated Power at the antenna, and operates its transmitters at 5kW base power.

B105 and Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s DAB services all emanate from the TVQ Ten tower on combined equipment used by all radio broadcasters in Brisbane.

<text>Football Club Dinamo City, commonly referred to as Dinamo City and colloquially known as Dinamo, is an Albanian professional football club based out of Tirana. They compete in the Kategoria Superiore, the top tier of Albanian football. Founded in 1950, the club was historically affiliated to the Interior Ministry and having won 18 National Championships, it is considered to be the second most decorated club after local rivals KF Tirana.

==History==
The club was officially founded on 3 March 1950 by the Interior Ministry of Albania during the communist regime under dictator Enver Hoxha. They won four consecutive championships from 1950 to 1953. During this time, Dinamo recorded a hot streak of 25 consecutive wins, a record in Albanian football and 4th longest domestic winning streak in Europe.

In 1967, Dinamo won its 9th championship by leaving Tirana, then 17 Nëntori, one point behind, who was expelled for the tournament three weeks before the end. This championship is not officially recognised by UEFA, however.

In 1989, Dinamo eventually finished third in the league which was won by 17 Nëntori, which made eligible to play in European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup for the third time in their history. In the preliminary round of the tournament the team faced Chernomorets Burgas, losing the first leg 1–3 (Demollari scoring the lone goal for Dinamo City) but winning the second 4–0 at home, thus recording its biggest win in a UEFA club competition. The team then was eliminated in the first round by Dinamo București despite winning the first leg in Tirana 1–0.
Dinamo București won the second leg 2–0.

In 1995, the team were renamed KS Olimpik Tirana to leave behind the &quot;communist past&quot;, but the club returned to their original name two years later.

After finishing third in the table in 2005–06 season, Dinamo City named Faruk Sejdini as their new coach. One of Albania&#x27;s best teachers of footballing fundamentals, he had a spell at the club last term before being dismissed by president Besnik Sulaj. Having returned following a spell at Shkumbini, Sejdini said: &quot;It&#x27;s nice to be back.&quot; On 23 October 2006, he was fired.

At the start of the 2007–08 season, Agim Canaj took over as head coach, replacing Ilir Daja who led Dinamo towards the championship title, after a dramatic win against Partizani 2–1 in the final match, playing for 36 minutes with 9 players. In the summer of 2008, Ilir Daja moved into a position as director in order to make place for Marcelo Javier Zuleta from Argentina. The Argentinian coach also brought with him four Argentinian players; goalkeeper Daniel Bertoya, defender Alejandro Palladino, midfielder Agustín González, and striker Cristian Campozano. Zuleta only lasted for the first Champions League qualification match against Bosnians FK Modriča before he was replaced as coach by Artan Mërgjyshi, for only one match.

Together with Zuleta, the four Argentinian players also left the club. After Mërgjyshi left, Zlatko Dalić, the actual coach of Croatia, was appointed as new coach for Dinamo. He signed a two-year contract with the club. That deal was broken when Dinamo lost its second game in the re-beginning of the 2008–09 season against Partizani. Shkëlqim Muça was then appointed manager of the club five days after of Zlatko Dalić&#x27;s leave. In the 2009–10 season, Dinamo won the championship again, registering its 18th success.

In 2011–12 season, the club experienced its worst period of all time, finishing last in the league with 13 points from 26 matches, winning only 3 times. They were relegated to the Kategoria e Parë for the first time in their history. Since the 2012–13 season, the club have played in the Kategoria e Parë and have risked relegation to the third tier several times.
After spending 9 seasons in the second division, Dinamo clinched the promotion to the Superiore, confirming first place in Group A following a 2–0 win against FK Vora.

On 25 August 2023, it was officially announced by president Bardhi that the club would rebrand to Dinamo City, ahead of the 2023–24 Kategoria Superiore season.

==Stadium==
Dinamo City has historically played at Selman Stërmasi Stadium which was also known as Dinamo Stadium when it first opened. After a spell playing at Niko Dovana Stadium, Durrës, Dinamo rebranded in 2023 and now play at the Elbasan Arena in Elbasan. 

==Supporters==

<text>Klubi i Futbollit Tirana is an Albanian professional football club based in the country&#x27;s capital city, Tirana, that competes in the Kategoria Superiore, the top tier of Albanian football. The men&#x27;s football club is part of the multi-disciplinary sports club SK Tirana, and is the most successful in Albania, having won 54 major domestic trophies. They are the only football club in Albania with two stars in their crest after winning their 20th league championship in 2003 (each star corresponds to ten championships), making them the first and only Albanian club to have achieved this feat to date. They play their home games at the Selman Stërmasi Stadium in Tirana.

The club was founded on 15 August 1920 as Sport Klub Tirana, but were renamed to Shoqata e Futbollit Agimi (English: Agimi Football Association) and had participated in all the top tier national championships in Albanian football through 2017. However, their ninth-place finish in the 2016–17 season resulted in the club’s first-ever relegation to the Albanian First Division (second-tier).

The club competed under the name SK Tirana between 1927 and 1947, when the communist regime forcibly renamed the club &quot;17 Nëntori Tirana&quot;, &quot;Puna Tirana&quot; and &quot;KS 17 Nëntori&quot;. In 1991 the club retook its pre-1947 name and was divided into two branches, the multi disciplinary SK Tirana and the football branch KF Tirana.

KF Tirana is the most successful Albanian team in European competitions, having progressed from the first round on 14 occasions (once directly by draw, without playing) since their European debut in the 1965–66 European Cup. They have reached Round of 16 in European competition four times, including three times in the European Cup (now Champions League) during the 1980s. The club also holds the historical record for highest ranked Albanian club according to IFFHS, having been ranked 31st in the world in 1987 following their 1986–87 campaign. KF Tirana is an ECA member.

==History==
===1920–1937: Beginnings of Klubi i Futbollit Tirana===

Tirana was officially founded on 15 August 1920. The first coach was appointed Palok Nika. The first name of the club was &quot;Sportklub Tirona&quot; which was later changed into &quot;Futboll Klub Tirona&quot;. The team played their first official match in October at Shallvare against Juventus Shkodër.

Tirana played their first international match against Yugoslav team Crnogorac Cetinje from Montenegro in 1925. On 16 August 1927, which was the seventh anniversary of the formation of the Agimi Sports Association, the club&#x27;s name changed into &quot;Sportklub Tirana&quot;, which would be commonly referred to as SK Tirana. On that day the president of the club was Teki Selenica.

in 1930, Tirana took part in the first officially recognised football competition held in Albania, organised by newly founded Albanian Football Association. The team dominated the tournament, reaching the final after winning five matches, drawing four and losing just one, to finish joint top, along with Skënderbeu Korçë, albeit with a slightly better goal difference. Tirana faced in the championship final Skënderbeu Korçë, who refused to play as a sign of protest against the bias of the competition and the Albanian Football Association towards Tirana. The club was named champion after the games were awarded 2–0.

The following season, the club introduced new players such as goalkeeper Vasfi Samimi, Sabit Çoku, Muhamet Agolli and Halim Begeja. The championship format changed as it divided the teams into two groups. Tirana was placed in Group A and managed to finish 1st after collecting five points from three matches. In the final against Group B winners Teuta Durrës, the team drew 1–1 in the first leg at home but managed a 3–0 win in the second one to retain the championship title.

Tirana continued to dominate the Albanian football even in the next season, despite the fact that the championship format was changed once again. In a group where every club would play each other twice and the winner would be decided by who finished top of the league, Tirana had it easy as they finished the championship unbeaten, winning five matches and drawing three, winning the title for the third consecutive year, which further cemented their place in history as the first club to dominate football in Albania. The club lost the title for the first time in history in 1933, finishing in a disappointing third place out of six, behind Bashkimi Shkodran and the winners Skënderbeu Korçë. It turned out to be a transition period as team bounced back firmly in the 1934 Championship, finishing five points ahead of runners-up Skënderbeu Korçë in a seven team format.

In the next years, Tirana managed to win the 1936 and 1937 championship, guided by ethnic-Albanian forward Riza Lushta who was named top goalscorer in both years. This was the last pre-World War II competition held by the Albanian Football Association as there was no championship held in 1938 and World War II broke out in 1939.

===1939–1947: War years===
In 1939, Albania was under Italian invasion; Giovanni Giro, a loyal trustee of Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano, was in charge of organising the first football competition under Victor Emmanuel III, which was called &quot;Turneja Kombëtare E Footbollit Për Ndeshjet E Trofeut Të Liktorit&quot; (National Tour of Football for the Matches of the Lictor Trophy). Tirana participated in the tournament, eliminating 9–0 on aggregate Dragoj Pogradeci in the first round to reach the semi-finals. In the semi-final, the team played Skënderbeu Korçë, beating them 3–0 to reach the final against Vllaznia Shkodër. In the final played at the Shallvare field in the capital on 30 September 1939, Tirana won the trophy by winning 6–5.

A similar tournament was held in the next year by the fascist regime, this time in a group format where teams were divided into two groups based on geography location. Two of Tirana&#x27;s most important players Kryeziu and Lushta left Albania for Italy to join Bari and Roma respectively. In the first match, Tirana drew 2–2 with Vllaznia Shkodër, and then won 3–0 at home against Elbasani. The rest of the campaign did not prove to be fruitful as Vllaznia finished top of the group ahead of Tirana and reached the championship finals, where they defeated Skënderbeu Korçë 11–1 on aggregate to win their first national championship, to this day unrecognised by the Albanian Federal Association.

The championship was not held in 1941 but returned in the following year, which also had three clubs from Kosovo. These clubs from Kosovo competed in the northern section along with the reigning champions Vllaznia Shkodër and Tirana competed in the new middle section group and the southern clubs competed in their own group. In a bizarre ruling, only players born between 1921 and 1925 were allowed to participate in the competition, meaning that only players between the ages of 17 and 22 were allowed to play. However, this rule was not followed by most clubs and senior players did participate in the competition. Tirana reached the semi-finals after winning 5–1 versus Elbasani and drawing 1–1 against Teuta Durrës. In the semi-final, the team faced Prizreni; the first leg ended in a 2–2 draw while the second one was won by Tirana 2–1. The team thus reached the final once again where they faced Vllaznia Shkodër on 29 June. The regular time ended in a 1–1 draw, leading the Italian referee Michele Carone then asked both sides to play extra time of two 15-minute halves, but Vllaznia declined. Two days after the final had been played the match was awarded 2–0 to Tirana along with the title.

The club won two out of the three National Championships that were held during World War II, but in March 2013, Albanian Football Association made a decision by refusing to recognise them, stating that they were not legitimate, since they weren&#x27;t organised by the AFA, but by the fascist regime.

===1944–1957: Postwar period===

Following the end of World War II, footballing activities resumed as they had done before the war under the guidance of the Albanian Football Association. In the championship of 1945, Tirana was placed in Group B. The team topped the group easily, collecting 16 points from 10 matches, thus reaching the final where they faced Vllaznia Shkodër once again. They lost both matches 2–1, thus missing the opportunity to win another championship.

Under communist regime led by dictator Enver Hoxha, Tirana would quickly become a victim as in early March 1946 the ruling communist Politburo had instructed the club to change its name to 17 Nëntori (&quot;17 November&quot;) in honour of the Liberation of Tirana which took place on 17 November 1944. In the following decade, the club was subject to appalling treatment by the regime, and this was highlighted by the creation of a privilege system for the newly created communist backed teams Partizani Tirana and Dinamo Tirana.

The following decade would unroll in the same suffocating atmosphere, becoming even heavier after the foundation of two system-privileged teams that would follow the experiences of their sisters in the former USSR, former Yugoslavia, and the other eastern European countries: Partizani, the Defense Ministry team and Dinamo, the Internal Affairs Ministry team. Dozens of Tirana&#x27;s talented players were &quot;convinced&quot;, against their will, to play for either Partizani or Dinamo. As a result, &quot;17 Nentori&quot; struggled to stay at the top during the years 1947–57, however the team managed to gain some of the lost ground during the second part of the 1950s after replacing in part some of the first choice players of its line up.

=== 1958–1990: Decline and revival ===

From 1958 to 1964 Tirana kept on producing some good football and finishing the championship almost always at the third spot. These years were a prelude to what was about to happen later: Tirana reexperienced its pre-war glory spell under the services of the unforgettable coach Myslym Alla. At the end of the 28th national championship Tirana became champions of Albania more than twenty years after their last title.

The team repeated the success the year after, but this was an obvious challenge to Partizani&#x27;s generals and Dinamo&#x27;s secret service bosses.

==== 1967 title unjustly denied ====

It was 24 June 1967. Tirana and Partizani played their derby of the 19th round of 1966–67 Albanian First League. The match was not finished due to a fight breaking out with many Tirana and Partizani players throwing punches on the field. It was not a huge surprise to see the paper headlines the next morning: &quot;Due to direct decision of the AFA, Tirana and Partizani forfeit the match 0:3, are deducted 3 points each and will thereafter lose by default remaining matches!&quot; By forfeiting that match and losing the subsequent 3 remaining matches, Dinamo would automatically gain enough points to overtake Tirana and win the title.

==== Defiance ====

After this, Tirana won the championship two years in a row in style, losing only two matches in 1968 and only one during the 1969–70 season.

During the seventies, Tirana struggled hard to stay at the top, the best result being the second place and the worst the thirteenth. Yet the club won the national cup twice. The generation of older players came to the end of their careers and this could only mark the end of a highly successful era. However the unsuccessful spell would not last long this time. Tirana won the championship at the end of the 1981–82 season, and they went on to win the title three other times during the eighties, in 1984–85, 1987–88 and 1988–89 and the Albanian Cup in 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1985–86. The club was also successful in European club competitions, reaching there the round of 16 four times in the 1980s, alone in the European Cup three times. Many of the team&#x27;s players made up the core of the Albania national football team, such as Agustin Kola, Arben Minga, Shkëlqim Muça and Mirel Josa.

===1991–2006: Return to success===
In August 1991, less than a year following the fall of communism in Albania, Tirana regained its old name, and likewise the whole Albanian society, went through a period of profound changes. Almost all the best Albanian players left the country and went abroad looking for a richer team who could hire them. But it seems that the club simply could not stand being too long from the leading spots. The team returned to the winning ways by winning the Albanian Cup in the 1993–94 season, defeating 1–0 on aggregate Teuta Durrës. Shortly after, in January 1995, the team won also their first Albanian Supercup trophy, defeating 1–0 Teuta Durrës at Qemal Stafa Stadium. A couple of months later, they clinched their 15th championship by finishing 12 points ahead of the runner-up Teuta Durrës.

This championship was followed by another one in the 1995–96 season, as Tirana won it just one point ahead of Teuta Durrës once again. The team also clinched the cup in that season, completing the domestic double for the second time in history. Another domestic double followed in 1998–99 season. In the following years, Tirana continued to dominate the Albanian football, winning 10 out of the last 18 Albania&#x27;s championships. The team also dominated in the domestic cups, adding to their trophy cabinet three Albanian Cups and five other Albanian Supercups.

===2011–2018: Change in ownership, decline and relegation===

Following a successful 2006–07 campaign which saw the club win the Albanian Superliga comfortably, the team begun to struggle for results. They began the season by getting eliminated from the UEFA Champions League by NK Domžale. Despite winning the Albanian Supercup versus Besa Kavajë, Tirana managed only a 6th-place finish their worst finish since 1993. In cup, the team lost the final to Vllaznia Shkodër.

In the following season, Tirana bounced back; inspired by striker Migen Memelli, who went on to score 30 goals, Tirana managed to win the championship for the 24th time in history. In cup they reached another final, only to be defeated again, this time by Flamurtari Vlorë. In the next years, Tirana experiences mixed fortunes, being unable to win the championship but remaining on top in domestic cups, winning the Albanian Cup in 2010–11 and 2011–12, and three other Albanian Supercups in 2009, 2011 and 2012. There was also major controversies off the field between club&#x27;s chief and president in the 2010–11 season, which led to a delay in paying the players&#x27; wages and even some players not receiving their wages.

On 12 October 2011, Municipality of Tirana city council voted through a unanimous decision to change the status of the club from a municipality owned to a shareholder own one, under the name KF Tirana Sh.A, with the municipality of Tirana initially holding a 100% stake in the club but with the possibility of any future private sponsors and donors to own stocks in the club.

Starting from 2013, Tirana entered in a period of disappointments. In the 2013–14 season, the team was seriously in risk of getting relegated for the first time in history. By the end of December 2013 the team was ranked in the last position with only 10 points from 13 matches, 7 points away from the safe zone. However, with Gugash Magani as manager and a strong transfer market, the team bounced back and eventually finished in 6th position, escaping the relegation only in the penultimate match. On 26 June 2014, the Tirana city council approved a proposal to give private donors a 66% stake in the club&#x27;s assets for the next 18 years, which at the time fell in the hands of Refik Halili and Lulzim Morina, which enabled such donors to invest in players, facilities and youth teams.
Tirana begun the 2014–15 season with high expectations, challenging for the title in the first part of the season. In the second part, however, the team declined and ultimately finished in 5th position. In cup, Tirana was controversially eliminated from Laçi in the semi-final 1–0 on aggregate. Laçi eventually won the final against Kukësi, leaving Tirana without Europa League football once again. The club was relegated during the 2016–17 season. From title contender halfway through the season, Tirana fell continuously to dramatically succumb to relegation for the first time in their history. Ilir Daja was sacked on 1 November following a goalless draw against Vllaznia Shkodër, and was replaced by the returned Mirel Josa. The club also broke the relationship with the fans after allowing with their lifetime rivals Partizani Tirana to play at Selman Stërmasi Stadium; they opposed such an agreement and subsequently abandoned the matches for the entire season as a result. Tirana then endured a 15 winless match streak before winning 2–0 against Korabi Peshkopi. Their relegation was officially confirmed on 27 May following a goalless draw versus fellow relegation strugglers Vllaznia Shkodër. In cup, Tirana did much better, winning their 16th trophy on 31 May after defeating 3–1 Skënderbeu Korçë at Elbasan Arena. This meant the return of Tirana in European competitions after five years.

Tirana retained most of their players ahead of the new season. The club appointed former Brazil international Zé Maria as the new manager. The team eliminated from the UEFA Europa League by Israel&#x27;s Maccabi Tel Aviv In September 2017, Tirana won another trophy, their 11th Albanian Supercup after winning 1–0 against Kukësi. Winning two major domestic trophies and also participating in Europe, Tirana set an astonishing record by becoming the first and only Albanian First Division side to achieve this feat. In the league Tirana dominated with hammering results in either home or away matches. Club&#x27;s goal of a quick promotion in Superliga was reached with three spare rounds to play. Tirana won their first ever Albanian First Division title on 16 May by winning 2–0 against the Group A winners Kastrioti Krujë.

===2019–present: 100th anniversary and return to top-flight as a powerhouse===
Tirana won the 25th championship in the 2019–20 season which was also the club&#x27;s 100th anniversary. It was the first title after 11 years. During the season the team recorded two wins against Partizani, ending the negative record of 18 winless matches against them; the 5–1 win in February 2020 was the biggest since 2005. Ndubuisi Egbo took charge of the team starting in the 13th matchday; he was highly praised for his work and also become the first African coach to win a league title in Europe. In cup, the team managed to reach the final but was defeated 2–0 by Teuta.

In the summer of 2020, Tirana reached the play-off of UEFA Europa League, becoming the second Albanian club to achieve this feat after Skënderbeu. They were eliminated by Switzerland&#x27;s BSC Young Boys. During the domestic season, Tirana failed to defend the title and finished a disappointing 5th place. Coach Egbo was fired and replaced by Orges Shehi halfway through the season. In the next campaign, Tirana dominated the championship and won it for the 26th time in history. Aided by the attacking duo Taulant Seferi and Redon Xhixha, and players such as Ennur Totre, Vesel Limaj, Visar Bekaj, and Ardit Toli, Tirana secured the title with three rounds to spare.

==Grounds==

===Shallvare (1920–46)===
The club&#x27;s first home ground was the Shallvare, located in the centre of Tirana where today is the existing Shallvare block, acquired by the club prior to their formation in 1920. The also field served as an amusement centre for the youth of Tirana to enjoy, and it was a popular gathering place where various games were played during religious holidays. Before its use as a football ground the site was use by the Ottoman garrison as a playground, and in 1916 it served as a runway for the Austrian-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops. The club played their first game at the Shallvare in 1920 against a team made up of the occupying Austrian-Hungarians. In 1925 there were changing rooms built at the ground, and in the early 1930s there was an athletics track built around the football pitch. The administrator of the ground was the football referee, Besim Hamdiu (Qorri), who only had one assistant in the maintenance of the ground. The ground did not have a main stand or seating area for spectators, but rather a two storied building that was constructed in 1923 by a member of parliament Masar Këlliçi . The building stood 50 metres away from the football pitch and was located in line with the middle of the pitch, with its balcony facing the field and the Dajt mountains. The ground was also used for other sporting events as well as military parades, one of which the president and later king Ahmet Zogu attended in 1927. The ground was destroyed in 1951 and Soviet–style apartment blocks were built onto of it instead.

===Qemal Stafa Stadium (1946–2015)===
The home ground of KF Tirana is Selman Stërmasi Stadium, which is shared with city rivals Dinamo Tirana and Partizani Tirana. However, most derby and significant matches are played at the national team&#x27;s Qemal Stafa Stadium; the stadium is also used if the Selman Stërmasi Stadium is unavailable as it is used by three different teams. The club has expressed its desire to rebuild the current Selman Stërmasi Stadium into a modern complex with around 15,000 to 20,000 seats. They want it to be Albania&#x27;s first modern post-Communism stadium without an athletic track around the field, which they hope will provide more atmosphere and attract more fans. However, it has not yet been decided when this will be built but it is rumoured to be the club&#x27;s 100th anniversary present in 2020.

===Selman Stërmasi Stadium (1956–present)===
KF Tirana plays most of its official and friendly games at the Selman Stërmasi Stadium in Tirana. The Selman Stërmasi Stadium was built in 1956 and was previously named the &#x27;Dinamo&#x27; Stadium until 1991 when it was permanently given its new name. The Football Association of Albania and the club decided to name the stadium post mortem after the eminent KF Tirana player, coach and president, Selman Stërmasi.

The stadium has a capacity of 12,500 (8,400 seated). In December 2014, another phase of reconstruction was started, involving a new pitch, central main covered stand, central fans stand including two extra rows extension, broken or missing seats replacements/repairs, interior facilities, general lineaments and a shopping center just under central seated. The internal facilities include general repairs, a press conference room, journalists&#x27; corner and modern showers. The side fans stands will temporary be shut and covered by advertising boards. It is still unclear when will stadium scoreboard and clock be fitted.

The main parking area is located at the front of the stadium, which leads to the entrance. The whole external part of the stadium is surrounded by a 2.7 M (9 ft) rail fence.

===Skënder Halili Complex===
The club&#x27;s training ground is called the Skënder Halili Complex and it is located off Rruga e Kavajës, near the Birra Tirana factory. The training complex was posthumously named after Skënder Halili, who was one of the club&#x27;s most notable associates, both during his playing career and after. The complex features a full sized natural grass football pitch, as well as a smaller astro turf fan along with dressing rooms used by senior team as well as some of the youth teams. In December 2014 work began on both the Skënder Halili Complex and the Selman Stërmasi Stadium in order to fully renovate these grounds to be used by the club, and at the training ground the training facilities were all improved which included the dressing rooms and even the single stand that holds a small number of spectators for those wishing to attend training sessions and even occasional friendlies that are played at the ground.

==Supporters==
Tirana is considered to be one of the most supported football clubs in Albania, and its supporters also formed the first Ultras group in the country in 1986 called 
Ultras Tirona. The group was forced to operate illegally as the communist regime did not allow such organised groups to function. However, despite this, its supporters used games as an outlet to show their dissent against the regime in place and following the fall of communism in Albania they became more organised and attracted more supporters in the late 90s and early 2000s. During the mid-2000s, younger supporters began to emerge on the scene and felt that the older Ultras Tirona did not entirely represent them, which led to the younger supporters forming a new Ultras group called the Tirona Fanatics on 8 January 2006.They are now the best ultras in Albania 
Tirona Fanatics are widely regarded as a right wing tifo-group, whereas Ultras Guerrils are mostly associated with the left due to their history. 
The group quickly rose in membership and became the most organised supporters group in Albania, following Tirana home and away, including European games. On 20 May 2015 the majority of the founding members of Tirona Fanatics decided to hand over the management of the group to younger supporters. The group has partnerships withMacedonian group Shvercerat of FK Shkupi.
KF Tirana has another Ultras group called &quot;Capital Crew&quot; which offer a spectacular atmosphere when they are in the stadium.

===Rivalries===
Tirana have three main rivals. Vllaznia Shkodër, the oldest derby in the country, with the matches between them called the All-time Albanian derby. The other rivalries are the Tirana derbies with Dinamo Tirana and Partizani Tirana. However, since 2010s, they have developed a fierce rivalry with Skënderbeu Korçë since the latter side&#x27;s rise to prominence.

<text>The Royal Palace of Caserta ( ; ) is a former royal residence in Caserta, Campania, 35km north of Naples in southern Italy, constructed by the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies as their main residence as kings of Naples. Located 35 km north of the historic centre of Naples, Italy, the complex is the largest palace erected in Europe during the 18th century. In 1997, the palace was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site; its nomination described it as &quot;the swan song of the spectacular art of the Baroque, from which it adopted all the features needed to create the illusions of multidirectional space&quot;. The Royal Palace of Caserta is the largest former royal residence in the world, over 2 million m3 in volume and covering an area of 47,000 m2 and a floorspace of 138,000 square metres is distributed in the five stories of the building.

==History==

The construction of the palace began in 1752 for Charles VII of Naples (later Charles III of Spain), who worked closely with his architect, Luigi Vanvitelli. When Charles saw Vanvitelli&#x27;s grandly scaled model for Caserta, it filled him with emotion &quot;fit to tear his heart from his breast.&quot; In the end, Charles never slept a night at the Reggia, as he abdicated in 1759 to become King of Spain. The project was carried to only partial completion for Charles&#x27; third son and successor, Ferdinand IV of Naples.

The political and social model for Vanvitelli&#x27;s palace was Versailles, which, though strikingly different in its variety and disposition, solved similar problems of assembling and providing for the king, court, and government in a massive building with the social structure of a small city, confronting a baroque view of a highly subordinated nature, &quot;la nature forcée&quot;. This was part of the entire concept of the palace when Mario Gioffredo first proposed it in 1750. According to George L. Hersey, the proposal envisaged a palace &quot;that was a virtual city, housing not just the court and king but all the main political and cultural elites of the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily - university, museum, library, cabinet bureaus, military high commands, and so on.&quot;

Noted British art historian Anthony Blunt said the palace: &quot;...became the symbol of the new monarchy, and Vanvitelli&#x27;s bold design brilliantly expresses this idea. The vastness of the scale. The vistas through open vestibules to the park, and the dramatically planned grand staircase are all evidence that Charles aimed at rivalling Versailles; but not a single element is directly borrowed from Louis XIV&#x27;s palace, and Caserta has the great advantage over its model of having been planned as a whole by a single architect at a single moment, as opposed to the sometimes untidy agglomeration of elements which makes Versailles more picturesque but less harmonious.&quot;

The population of Caserta Vecchia was moved to provide a workforce closer to the palace. A silk factory at San Leucio was disguised as a pavilion in the immense parkland.

Another of the king&#x27;s primary objectives was to have a magnificent new royal court and administrative center for the kingdom in a location protected from sea attack and distant from the revolt-prone and congested city of Naples. Troop barracks were housed within the palace to provide the king with suitable protection.

The Royal Palace of Madrid, where Charles had grown up, had been devised by Filippo Juvarra for Charles&#x27; father, Philip V of Spain, and Charlottenburg Palace provided models. A spacious octagonal vestibule seems to have been inspired by Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute in Venice, while the palatine chapel is most often compared to the Royal Chapel at Versailles. Vanvitelli died in 1773: the construction was continued by his son Carlo and then by other architects; but the elder Vanvitelli&#x27;s original project, which included a vast pair of frontal wings similar to Bernini&#x27;s colonnades at St. Peter&#x27;s Square, was never finished. In 1861, with the birth of the Kingdom of Italy, Savoyard officials surveyed the contents of the Palace. The bidet was inventoried as follows: &quot;strange object in the shape of a guitar&quot;.

From 1923 to 1943, the palace was the location of the Accademia Aeronautica, the Italian Air Force Academy. From 1943, during the allied invasion, the royal palace served as Allied Force Headquarters for the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean area; Sir Maitland Wilson, and later Sir Harold Alexander. In April 1945, the palace was the site of the signing of the unconditional surrender of German and Italian RSI forces in Italy. The agreement covered between 600,000 and 900,000 soldiers along the Italian Front, including troops in sections of Austria. The first Allied war crimes trial took place in the palace in 1945; German general Anton Dostler was sentenced to death and executed nearby, in Aversa. In the left-hand arc behind the façade, a set of barracks was built. During World War II, the soldiers of the US Fifth Army recovered here in a &quot;rest center.&quot; The palace continued as Allied Force Headquarters in 1946 under Britain&#x27;s Gen. Sir William Duthie Morgan and in 1947 under American Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee, each serving as Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean Theater of Operations, working to secure weapons and ordnance, restore infrastructure throughout the region, return refugees, and feed hundreds of thousands. The Theater was dissolved in September 1947. The palace was damaged by U.S. bombers in 1943, and was virtually emptied of furnishings during the war by looters. The Italian government took great pains to restore the building and return or replace decorations in keeping with the original pieces. Also, during World War II, Nazis occupied Caserta; therefore, the likelihood of them robbing the palace of pieces of its history is high.

In 1998, the palace was a filming location for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, specifically as the interior of the Theed City Naboo Palace. It was used as a location for four days after it had been closed to visitors. Scenes with explosions were filmed on replica sets in Leavesden Studios in England to avoid damaging the actual palace. In addition, scenes from Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones were also filmed at the palace, specifically in the Upper Vestibule.

The Royal Palace of Caserta has also been the site of other notable movies and tv series, such as The Great, , Angels &amp; Demons, Kaos, Conclave, Ferdinando and Carolina among others.

==Layout of the palace==
&quot;The palace has five floors; 1,200 rooms, including two dozen state apartments; 1,742 windows; 34 staircases; 1,026 fireplaces; a large library; and a theatre modelled after the Teatro San Carlo of Naples. A monumental avenue running 20 kilometers between the palace and Naples was planned but never realized.&quot;

The palace has a rectangular plan, measuring 247 × 184 m, and the four sides are connected by two orthogonal arms, forming four inner courts.

Even without the surface area of the internal courtyards, Caserta is by far the largest royal palace resulting from a single original project in the world in terms of volume, with more than . The floor space is 138,000 square meters. Behind the façades of its matching segmental ranges of outbuildings that flank the giant forecourt, a jumble of buildings arose to facilitate daily business. The palace encloses four courts that feature what scholars describe as a well-proportioned interior that evokes a monotonous dignity unique in its time.

Of all the royal residences inspired by the Palace of Versailles, the Reggia of Caserta is the one that bears the greatest resemblance to the original model: the unbroken balustraded skyline and the slight break provided by pavilions within the long, somewhat monotonous façade. As at Versailles, a large aqueduct was required to bring water for the prodigious water displays. Like its French predecessor, the palace was intended to display the power and grandeur of an absolute Bourbon monarchy. A solecism at Caserta is that above the &quot;piano reale&quot;, the King&#x27;s floor, is another floor of equal magnificence. The enfilades of Late Baroque &quot;saloni&quot; were the heart and seat of government, as well as displays of national wealth. Caserta provided a royal refuge from the dust and factions of the capital, just as Versailles had freed Louis XIV from Paris. The royal palace has more than 40 monumental rooms completely decorated with frescoes when, in comparison, Versailles counts only 22 monumental rooms.

==The park==
The garden, a typical example of the Baroque extension of formal vistas, stretches for 120 hectares, partly on hilly terrain. Its construction started in 1753, and it is also inspired by the park of Versailles. The park starts from the back façade of the palace, flanking a long alley with artificial fountains and cascades. There is a botanical garden called &quot;The English Garden&quot; in the upper part designed in the 1780s by Carlo Vanvitelli and the German-born botanist, nurseryman, and plantsman-designer, John Graefer, who was trained in London and recommended to Sir William Hamilton by Sir Joseph Banks. It is an early Continental example of an English garden in the svelte naturalistic taste of Capability Brown.

The fountains and cascades, each filling a &quot;vasca&quot; (basin), with architecture and hydraulics by Luigi Vanvitelli at intervals along a wide straight canal that runs to the horizon, rivalled those at Peterhoff Palace outside St. Petersburg. These include:
*The Fountain of Diana and Actaeon (sculptures by Paolo Persico, Angelo Maria Brunelli, and Tommaso Solari);
*The Fountain of Venus and Adonis (1770–80);
*The Fountain of the Dolphins (1773–80);
*The Fountain of Aeolus;
*The Fountain of Ceres.

Many figures from classical Antiquity were modelled by Gaetano Salomone for the gardens of the Reggia and were executed by large workshops.

Contemporary observers noted that the Caserta surpassed all other European royal palaces, including its models, in one particular aspect: the combination of completeness and stateliness. This is attributed to the spacious oval piazza in front of the edifice&#x27;s south side.

==UNESCO World Heritage Site==
The palace was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. According to the rationale, the palace, &quot;whilst cast in the same mould as other 18th-century royal establishments, is exceptional for the broad sweep of its design, incorporating not only an imposing palace and park but also much of the surrounding natural landscape and an ambitious new town laid out according to the urban planning precepts of its time.&quot;

<text>Football Club Infonet Levadia Tallinn, commonly known as FCI Levadia, or simply as Levadia, is a professional football club based in Tallinn that competes in the Meistriliiga, the top flight of Estonian football. The club&#x27;s home ground is Lilleküla Stadium.

Founded in 1998 in Maardu, the club moved to Tallinn in 2000 and officially affiliated themselves with the capital city in 2004. In 2017, Levadia&#x27;s first team merged with FCI Tallinn, and became FCI Levadia. Levadia has played in the Meistriliiga since the 1999 season and have never been relegated from the Estonian top division. Levadia are the second most successful club in Estonian football with 31 domestic titles; including 11 Meistriliiga titles, a record 11 Estonian Cups and 9 Estonian Supercups.

==History==
===Early history===
Levadia was founded on 22 October 1998, when Viktor Levada&#x27;s Levadia Group OÜ became the official sponsor of Maardu based Esiliiga club Olümp, which subsequently changed its name to Levadia. The club won the 1998 Esiliiga and were promoted to the Meistriliiga. In January 1999, Sergei Ratnikov was appointed as manager. Levadia immediately made a mark during their first season in top flight football in 1999, becoming the first team to win the Meistriliiga, the Estonian Cup and the Estonian Supercup in the same year. 

After the turn of the century, Levadia moved their home matches from Maardu to the Kadriorg Stadium and managed to repeat their success by winning another treble during the 2000 season. In the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League, Levadia defeated The New Saints 6–2 on aggregate in the first qualifying round, but lost to Shakhtar Donetsk 2–9 on aggregate in the second qualifying round. Following the loss to Shakhtar Donetsk, Ratnikov was sacked. In 2001, Valeri Bondarenko was appointed as a manager. Levadia failed to defend their title, finishing the 2001 season in third place and in November 2001, Bondarenko was replaced by Pasi Rautiainen. Under Rautiainen, Levadia finished the 2002 Meistriliiga as runners-up, only two points behind champions Flora. After the season, Rautiainen resigned and was replaced by Franco Pancheri in January 2003. Pancheri coached Levadia for just 9 Meistriliiga matches, before he was sacked in June 2003. He was replaced by Tarmo Rüütli and Levadia finished the 2003 season in third place.

===Relocation to Tallinn===
In 2004, Levadia officially moved to Tallinn and the club was renamed from Levadia Maardu to Levadia Tallinn, although the team had already been playing at the Kadriorg Stadium since 2000. The club&#x27;s previously Tallinn-based reserve team changed its name to Levadia II. Under Rüütli, Levadia won the league in the 2004 season, but failed to defend the title in 2005, finishing as runners-up. In the 2006–07 UEFA Cup qualifying rounds, Levadia defeated Haka and Twente, but lost to Newcastle United 1–3 on aggregate in the first round. In the process, they became the first Estonian club to reach the first round of the UEFA Cup. Levadia won two more Meistriliiga titles in 2006 and 2007. 

In March 2008, Rüütli was hired by the Estonian Football Association to coach the Estonia national team and his assistant Igor Prins took over as manager. Under Prins, Levadia won two consecutive Meistriliiga titles in 2008 and 2009 and an Estonian Cup in 2010. In August 2010, Prins was sacked due to disagreements with the board and replaced by Levadia II manager Aleksandr Puštov. Levadia finished the 2010 season as runners-up. In July 2011, Puštov was sacked after disappointing results in the Meistriliiga and the Champions League and replaced by Sergei Hohlov-Simson. Levadia finished the 2011 season in fourth place, their lowest ever league placing since the club was promoted to the Meistriliiga. In December 2011, Marko Kristal was appointed as manager. The club won the 2011–12 Estonian Cup and finished the 2012 season as runners-up. Levadia won the Meistriliiga title in the 2013 season. The team defended their title in 2014, but finished the 2015 season as runners-up. In November 2015, it was announced that Sergei Ratnikov will return to Levadia after 15 years and replace Kristal as manager. Ratnikov&#x27;s second tenure as Levadia&#x27;s manager lasted until July 2016, when he was sacked following a 0–1 loss to Pärnu Linnameeskond. He was replaced by another returning manager, Igor Prins. Levadia finished the 2016 season as runners-up.

=== Merger with FC Infonet ===
Following another second-place finish in the 2017 season, Levadia announced they will merge with FC Infonet Tallinn, the Estonian champions of 2016. The two clubs merged their first teams, becoming FCI Levadia, with FCI Tallinn&#x27;s Aleksandar Rogić taking over as manager. FCI Levadia finished the 2018 season as runners-up, but won the Estonian Cup, beating rivals FC Flora 1–0 in the final. In 2019, Levadia moved to Estonia&#x27;s largest football stadium A. Le Coq Arena. On 15 September 2019, Rogić was sacked after disappointing results, with assistant coach Vladimir Vassiljev taking over as caretaker manager. In November 2019, former Estonia head coach and record cap holder Martin Reim was appointed as manager. However, after a disappointing start to the season, Martin Reim decided to resign in July 2020 and Vladimir Vassiljev took over the role. 

In August 2020, Levadia&#x27;s former assistant coach Marko Savić returned to the club and became joint managers with Vassiljev. In the following 2021 season, Levadia ended their 7-year Premium Liiga title drought, becoming Estonian champions in the last day of the season, after drawing 2–2 with rivals FC Flora in the title-deciding final match. FCI Levadia also lifted the Estonian Cup in 2021 and Estonian Supercup in February 2022, again beating Flora in both of the finals. In July 2022, Marko Savić and Vladimir Vassiljev announced they will be stepping down as head coaches of the club, with the main driver for the resignation being the disappointing 1–6 loss against Víkingur Reykjavík in the UEFA Champions League preliminary round. The remainder of the 2022 season was widely described by Estonian media outlets as turbulent, with Levadia changing head coaches multiple times in a short period of time and sporting director Tarmo Kink and CEO Sergei Hohlov-Simson also leaving the club. FCI Levadia finished the 2022 season as runners-up.

In November 2022, Levadia announced the appointment of former Spanish international Curro Torres as manager. The club finished the 2023 season as runners-up, before winning the double in 2024 by defeating Paide Linnameeskond 4–2 in the 2023–24 Estonian Cup final and lifting their 11th Premium Liiga title at the end of the 2024 season. Levadia started the 2025 season by winning their 9th Estonian Supercup.

==Stadiums==
===Lilleküla Stadium===

The club&#x27;s home ground is the 14,336-seat Lilleküla Stadium (commonly known as A. Le Coq Arena for sponsorship reasons). Opened in 2001 and expanded from 2016 to 2018, it is the largest football stadium in Estonia. The stadium is also home to Levadia&#x27;s rival FC Flora and the Estonian national team. Lilleküla Stadium is located at Jalgpalli 21, Kesklinn, Tallinn.

Levadia uses Sportland Arena artificial turf stadium for training and home matches during winter and early spring months. Levadia&#x27;s training in summer and autumn takes place in their Maarjamäe training complex.

===Kadriorg Stadium===

From 2000 to 2018, Levadia played at the Kadriorg Stadium. Built from 1922 to 1926 and renovated from 2000 to 2001, it is one of the oldest football stadiums in Estonia and used to be the home ground of the Estonia national team until the completion of Lilleküla Stadium in 2001.

== Rivalries ==
=== The Tallinn Derby ===
Levadia&#x27;s deepest rivalry is with FC Flora and the fixture between the two clubs is known as the Tallinn Derby (). Levadia and Flora are the two biggest and most successful clubs in Estonian football. The rivalry began in 1999, when Levadia entered Meistriliiga and immediately challenged the reigning champions Flora for the title, winning the treble in their first year in top-flight football. In the early 2000s, language and nationality was also one of the separating factors between the two clubs, as Levadia was seen as the club of choice for the Russian speaking population of the city and Flora for the Estonian speaking. However, that image of Levadia has since then faded away. From 2019, the two clubs also share their home ground A. Le Coq Arena. The attendance record of 3,510 was set on 28 June 2023.

<text>Kwame Kwei-Armah (born Ian Roberts; 24 March 1967 in Hillingdon, London) is a British actor, playwright, director and broadcaster. In 2005, Kwei-Armah became the second black Briton to have a play staged in the West End of London when his award-winning piece &quot;Elmina&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; transferred to the Garrick Theatre. He was the first black Briton to head a major British national theater, when he took the directorship of the Young Vic in 2018. Kwei-Armah was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to drama. 

Brought up in Southall, West London, he changed his name at the age of 19, after tracing his family history, through the slave trade back to his ancestral African roots in Ghana. His parents were born in Grenada. He has four children.

As an actor, Kwei-Armah is probably best known for playing paramedic Finlay Newton in the BBC medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot; from 1999 until 2004. He served as the chancellor of the University of the Arts London from 2011 to 2015. and was the artistic director of Baltimore&#x27;s Center Stage Theater in the United States from 2011 to 2018. From 2018, he was artistic director of the Young Vic theatre in London, announcing his departure in February 2024.

==Early life==
Kwei-Armah was born at Hillingdon Hospital in West London, and named Ian Roberts. He changed his name when he was aged 19 after tracing his family history (in which he first became interested as a child after watching the TV series &quot;Roots&quot;), through the slave trade back to his ancestral African roots in Ghana, descendant of Coromantins. His parents were born in Grenada, then a British colony. His maternal grandmother moved to Trinidad, where she died, leaving her five children including Kwei-Armah&#x27;s mother as orphans in Grenada. Kwei-Armah&#x27;s mother moved to Britain in 1962. His father, Eric, moved to Britain in 1960, at a time when there was high unemployment in Grenada, and found work in London at the local Quaker Oats factory.

When he was one year old, Kwei-Armah&#x27;s family moved to a two-storey terraced house in Southall where they let two rooms to help to pay for the mortgage. Kwei-Armah started at his first primary school as a five-year-old, and after a teacher disciplined him by kicking him in the back, his mother took on three jobs to pay for him and his two siblings to go to a private stage school, the Barbara Speake Stage School in London – working as a child minder, as a night nurse at Hillingdon Hospital, and doing some hairdressing work. He also attended The Salvation Army, and received musical training there. At the age of about 35, his mother had a stroke leading to left-sided weakness, from which she slowly recovered.

Kwei-Armah grew up in West London&#x27;s Southall in the 1970s at a time when Asian families were moving in and white families were moving out, and he perceived animosity from the Asian community towards the Afro-Caribbean community. One day, at the time of Friday 3 July 1981Southall riots, his father came home after the evening work-shift and took him out to see the Hambrough Tavern on fire. Kwei-Armah saw a police van arrive, and when the police started to charge at the crowd using batons and shields he ran home frightened. He claims to have seen from the upstairs front room the police chasing black and Asian boys along the street followed by skinheads, who also had batons and shields, chasing behind the police. The event shocked him making him feel that he was living in an alien environment, and reinforced his resolve to do well in his education. He later wrote about the event in his first play, &quot;A Bitter Herb&quot;.

==Appearances on stage, television and radio==
As Ian Roberts, Kwei-Armah portrayed Duke, who was one of &quot;The Latchkey Children&quot; in the eponymous London Weekend Television series that was written by Eric Allen and aired in 1980.

Kwei-Armah appeared in the original London production of &quot;Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens&quot;, which played at the Criterion Theatre in 1993.

Kwei-Armah first achieved fame playing the paramedic Finlay Newton in the BBC drama series &quot;Casualty&quot; from 1999 to 2004. His other television credits include appearances in episodes of &quot;Casualty&quot;′s sister series &quot;Holby City&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Afternoon Play&quot;, &quot;Between the Lines&quot; and &quot;The Bill&quot;. In 2003 he appeared as a contestant on the &quot;Reality TV programme Comic Relief does Fame Academy&quot; and subsequently released an album, &quot;Kwame&quot;. In 2007, he starred as E. R. Braithwaite in the two-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Braithwaite&#x27;s novel &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot;.

Kwei-Armah was seen in the episode &quot;Who Shot the Sheriff?&quot; in the 2006 BBC One revival of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, as an ambitious town planner in &quot;Lewis&quot;, and in the feature film &quot;Fade to Black&quot; opposite Danny Huston, Christopher Walken and Diego Luna. He is also a regular on &quot;TheatreVoice&quot;.

He presented the 15 February 2009 episode of the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Christianity: A History&quot;, during which he spoke about his own Christian faith and African identity, in addition to the African origins of Christianity in Ethiopia.

In the summer of 2009, he presented the Channel 4 series &quot;On Tour with the Queen&quot;, which looked at the impact of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s tour of the Commonwealth that took place between November 1953 and May 1954. He also met with King George Tupou V of Tonga, Sitiveni Rabuka and Queen Elizabeth II herself on the trip. In March 2010, Kwei-Armah appeared in the penultimate and final episodes of the fourth series of &quot;Skins&quot;.

For a number of years Kwei-Armah has appeared as a panellist on the arts discussion show &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;Question Time&quot; on two occasions and reported for &quot;The Culture Show&quot;.

On 15 May 2011 he was the stranded person on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His musical selections included the political power-rap of Chuck D and his band Public Enemy, Marvin Gaye, Bob Marley and Lord Kitchener. Kwei-Armah said living with his parents was like existing with two very different types of theatre in the family home: he would be serving rum to his father and his pals, while his mother was hosting church meetings in the living-room.

In 2011 Kwei-Armah chose Marcus Garvey as his subject for the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Great Lives&quot;.

==Career as a playwright==
Kwei-Armah&#x27;s first play, &quot;Bitter Herb&quot; (1998), won him a Peggy Ramsay award, and was subsequently put on by the Bristol Old Vic, where he also became writer-in-residence. His &quot;Blues Brother, Soul Sister&quot; was produced at the Theatre Royal, Bristol, in 1999, and &quot;Big Nose&quot; was performed in 1999 at the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry.

Kwei-Armah&#x27;s fifth play, &quot;Elmina&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, premiered in May 2003 at the National Theatre, and was shortlisted in the &quot;Best New Play&quot; category at the 2004 Laurence Olivier Awards. That same year, Kwei-Armah received the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Award for the Most Promising New Playwright of 2003. In 2005, he was nominated for a BAFTA award for the television version of &quot;Elmina&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;.

&quot;Walter&#x27;s War&quot;, a drama written by Kwei-Armah and based on the wartime experiences of footballer Walter Tull&#x27;s life, was made by UK TV channel BBC Four and screened on 9 November 2008 as part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Ninety Years of Remembrance&quot; season in November 2008. Kwei-Armah also had a cameo role in the film.

Kwei-Armah is a member of the board of the National Theatre and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Open University in 2008, and in 2009 was a judge for the BBC World Service&#x27;s International Radio Playwriting Competition. On 28 February 2011, he was named as the new artistic director at Baltimore&#x27;s Center Stage theatre, replacing Irene Lewis, who had served in the position for 19 years. Kwei-Armah&#x27;s play &quot;Elmina&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; had been staged in 2005, followed by &quot;Let There Be Love&quot; in 2010, and in 2007 he directed Naomi Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Things of Dry Hours&quot;.

Kwei-Armah was involved in the Bush Theatre&#x27;s 2011 project &quot;Sixty-Six Books&quot;, for which he wrote a piece based on a chapter of the King James Bible.

He is also a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres.

Kwei-Armah wrote and directed the world premiere of &quot;Marley&quot;, a musical based on the life and music of Bob Marley which ran at Center Stage, Baltimore in May and June 2015. In March and April 2017 the musical made its UK premiere in a new production (rewritten by Kwei Armah) at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre under a new title &quot;One Love: The Bob Marley Musical&quot;.

In October 2016 Kwei-Armah directed the European premiere of &quot;One Night in Miami&quot; by the award-winning, black, US playwright Kemp Powers. &quot;One Night in Miami&quot; ran from 6 October to 3 December 2016 at the Donmar Warehouse in London&#x27;s West End. The all-black cast portrays the friendship between four of the most celebrated black icons in American history at a pivotal moment in their lives: 22-year-old boxing champion Cassius Clay, on the brink of becoming Muhammad Ali, celebrates his world heavyweight championship title with controversial civil rights activist Malcolm X, along with singer songwriter Sam Cooke and NFL champion footballer Jim Brown. The action takes place in a Miami hotel room, watched over by Nation of Islam security.

Kwei-Armah collaborated with Idris Elba on the musical &quot;Tree&quot;, which premiered at the Manchester International Festival in 2019.

Kwei-Armah was a credited lyricist on the ArrDee and Cat Burns single &quot;Home for My Heart&quot;, which was released on 9 March 2023. The single debuted at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart.

===Controversy surrounding &quot;Tree&quot;===
On 2 July 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published a story describing how Tori Allen-Martin and Sarah Henley claimed they had been removed from the production of &quot;Tree&quot;. In 2015, Elba had asked them to develop and workshop his idea for a musical based on his album &quot;Idris Elba Presents mi Mandela&quot;, on which Allen-Martin had also collaborated. Allen-Martin and Henley said they had worked on the project for four years. In 2018, the show was commissioned by Manchester International Festival for their 2019 festival and Kwei-Armah was asked to join the project by Elba and Manchester International Festival as writer and director of the show. &quot;Tree&quot; was later billed as &quot;created by Idris Elba and Kwame Kwei-Armah&quot;. Allen-Martin and Henley claim that their creative input had included research, script-writing as well as the play&#x27;s title, and that they were threatened with legal action if they went public with the story. The co-producers of &quot;Tree&quot; released a statement refuting their claims. Kwei-Armah and Elba both published personal responses to Allen-Martin and Henley&#x27;s claims on Twitter. Elba said it was his &quot;contractual right as beholder of the original idea, the album&quot; to take the show in a different creative direction. The producers state that the two versions of &quot;Tree&quot; are &quot;different projects...Any similarities between the 2019 production of &quot;Tree&quot;, and Tori and Sarah’s 2016 workshopped script can be attributed to the fact that both were based upon the same original concept created by Idris Elba.&quot;

==Personal life==
Kwei-Armah has three children from his first marriage to Fyna Dowe and one from his second. His son Kwame Jr, professionally known as KZ, contributed production and vocals to Wretch 32 and Avelino&#x27;s 2015 mixtape &quot;Young Fire, Old Flame&quot;, and Wretch 32&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Growing Over Life&quot;, released in September 2016.

<doc id="830528" wikidata="Q3435114" url="?curid=830528" title="Tob">
<text>Tob was the name of a place in ancient Israel, mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.

==Hebrew Bible==
Jephthah flees from his brothers to the &quot;land of Tob&quot;. 
In Tob, Jephtha gatheres some men until his brothers want him back to fight against the Ammonites (). The place may be the same as the one mentioned in , named Ishtob (cf. Hebrew &quot;ish Tov&quot;). Some believe it should be translated &quot;men of Tob&quot;, rather than &quot;Ishtob&quot;.

==Identification==
There is a place named as Ṭby or Ṭubu in second millennium BCE sources, mentioned among the cities in Bashan. This led Benjamin Mazar and Martin Noth to identify it with the region near &quot;Taiyibeh&quot;, to the east of biblical Edrei (today&#x27;s Daraa in southern Syria), where today there is a Syrian village by this name (coordinates: 32°33&#x27;45 N, 36°14&#x27;38 E). Conder gave for his choice of Tob/Taibeh the coordinates &quot;32° 35&#x27; N., 35° 42&#x27; E.&quot;, a place described in Brown–Driver–Briggs as 12 miles southeast of the Sea of Galilee, corresponding to modern-day Taibah near Irbid in northern Jordan.

It has been suggested that the &quot;land of Tob&quot; was back country, used by outlaws as a place of refuge.

==Amarna letters==
Tob is also a town referred to in the Amarna letters, circa 1350 BCE. Among the c. 382 letters (EA 1 through EA 382) there is only one mention of the town, by the name &quot;TuBu&quot;, and in this small group of letters, the leader of the town of Tubu is only referred to as the &quot;Man&quot; of the town, i.e. &quot;the mayor&quot; or &quot;governor&quot;. Man was one of many common designations. He would have been a prince-type local leader - the chief of a tribe, clan, city, region, etc. EA letter 205 is the letter from the &quot;Man of Tubu&quot; and is one of 6 letters written by the same scribe.

==Appearances==

===In &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;===

At the start of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;, Kira is a shy, friendly teenager living peacefully in the Heliopolis colony. Kira is a highly skilled computer programmer who assists with research and development at the Heliopolis technical college, where he is a student. When a war between the Naturals and Coordinators is brought to Heliopolis, Kira takes control of a mobile suit, the , to protect his friends from ZAFTthe military organization of the Coordinators. Born as a Coordinator, Kira&#x27;s advanced mental and physical skills allow him to skillfully control the Strike. Kira is shocked when he discovers that his childhood friend Athrun Zala is a member of ZAFT. When they last met, Athrun gave Kira his robotic pet as a sign of their enduring friendship, (voiced by Naomi Shindou in the Japanese anime and Tabitha St. Germain in the English dub) which Kira is often seen with.

Several survivors from Heliopolis are brought on board the Archangel and Kira defends them from enemy attacks until they arrive in Alaska on Earth. Kira has strong reservations against fighting, fearing he may confront Athrun and that he may kill a person. After manipulation by Flay Allster, Kira gradually becomes more aggressive when defending the Archangel to the point where he could kill a person without hesitation. During one of the Archangel&#x27;s battles against ZAFT, the Strike suffers multiple damages by Athrun and Kira is declared missing in action. He is found alive but injured by Reverend Malchio, who transports him to a space colony known as PLANT where most coordinators reside and is ZAFT&#x27;s homebase. There, his wounds are treated by Lacus Clyne, a Coordinator who befriended Kira when she was taken aboard the Archangel and was used as a hostage.

After hearing that ZAFT plans to attack the base his friends are staying at, Kira decides to continue battling to bring the war to an end. Lacus then gives Kira ZAFT&#x27;s new mobile suit, , which he uses to accompany the Archangel, whose objective has also changed to ending the war. When piloting Freedom Kira is noted to avoid hitting enemy mobile suits&#x27; cockpits to reduce the number of human casualties. Kira joins the Archangel and Lacus&#x27; faction to fight both the Earth Alliance and ZAFT to stop both sides from destroying each other.

Kira learns of his origins from ZAFT commander Rau Le Creuset during these battles. Kira is the Ultimate Coordinator; his fetus was artificially developed outside his mother&#x27;s womb and his genetic enhancements were intended to be superior to all other Coordinators. Kira was the only fetus to survive the process. He was born as the twin brother of his comrade Cagalli Yula Athha but does not learn about this relationship until the latter half of the series. Kira was adopted by his aunt Caridad and uncle Haruma Yamato and was led to believe they were his biological parents. Despite being shocked by his origins as the Ultimate Coordinator, Kira continues to fight alongside the Archangel until their opponents, including Rau, have been defeated and the war comes to end.

===In &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;===
During &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;, Kira has been living in the secluded Marshall Islands since the end of the war within the country of Orb. He and Lacus have spent the past two years since the end of the war assisting Reverend Malchio and Kira&#x27;s adoptive mother with their orphanage. When an incident triggers another war, Coordinators try to kill Lacus; Kira pilots Freedom to defeat them. When Orb attempts to join the war as a member of the Earth Alliance, Kira and the Archangel intervene Orb&#x27;s forces to preserve the nation&#x27;s neutral status. Kira suspects Gilbert Durandal, the chairman of the PLANT colonies and leader of ZAFT, to be behind Lacus&#x27; attempted murder, but his motives are questioned by Athrun who is working in ZAFT. Later, when the Archangel becomes a target of the ZAFT ship known as Minerva, Kira is defeated and the Freedom is destroyed by pilot Shinn Asuka. Lacus gives Kira an upgraded version of Freedom, , so he can continue fighting. Having obtained a weapon of mass destruction, Durandal imposes the Destiny Plan, a rule which removes freewill and dictates a person&#x27;s entire life based on their genetics. Kira, the Archangel and their allies confront ZAFT&#x27;s forces in space and defeat them in the final battle. Kira personally confronts Durandal and the latter is killed by one of his own subordinates. Kira appears in the original video animation (OVA) &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Final Plus&quot;. Following Durandal&#x27;s death, Kira meets Shinn and they promise to work for a peaceful future. He is also featured in films &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: Special Edition&quot;, which retell the events from the television series and adds a scene of Kira becoming a member of ZAFT after the war ends.

===In &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Freedom&quot;===
In &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Freedom&quot; (set 2 years after the end of &quot;Destiny&quot;), Kira has moved to the PLANTs with Lacus, and has become the member of a peacekeeping organization called COMPASS alongside Shinn, and other comrades from his past with the Earth Alliance and Orb. At the beginning of the film, he pilots a new mobile suit, the STSS-909 Rising Freedom (STTS-909 ライジングフリーダムガンダム), which he uses to fight for Compass. However, Orphee Lam Tao from Blue Cosmos becomes jealous of Kira and Lacus&#x27;s relationship and has a sbordinate use his Accord genes to manipulate Kira as he crosses into Eurasia&#x27;s territory unknowingly and is attacked in retaliation under Lacus&#x27;s orders. The Freedom is destroyed by the Black Knights serving Orphee Lam Tao but manages to escape. Unaware of Lacus&#x27;s actions, believing that he has betrayed her, Kira breaks but he is supported by Athrun to search for her in order to understand the truth. An assault team led by Kira infiltrates Foundation&#x27;s base on the Artemis asteroid and rescues Lacus, as both declare their unconditional love. Kira is then given the old Strike Freedom to face the Battle Knights again, most importantly Orphee and Ingrid&#x27;s own mobile suit. Although Kira is overwhelmed in combat, Lacus aids him by the providing the MDE262S Proud Defender, to become the ZGMF/A-262PD-P Mighty Strike Freedom. Lacus arrives and assists Kira in destroying all of the Foundation&#x27;s mobile suits and ships. After defeating Orphee and Ingrid with Freedom&#x27;s giant sword, the war ends and Lacus and Kira descend to Earth on a beach, where they share a kiss.

===In other media===
Kira is featured in the manga adaptations of &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;. Kira&#x27;s designs, according to Masatsugu Iwaseauthor of the &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; mangawas intended to be that of &quot;a spineless wimp while not making him look too childish&quot;, but he later decided to make him a strong character in the manga. The manga &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: The Edge Desire&quot; features a story about Kira&#x27;s recovery following Freedom&#x27;s destruction.

The manga series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray&quot; explores Kira&#x27;s survival after the Strike&#x27;s defeat; a technician named Lowe Guele finds Kira wounded and takes him to Reverend Malchio. Although Kira appears only at the end, his defeat is the objective of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED X Astray&quot;″s protagonist, Canard Pars. In &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73 Δ Astray&quot; Kira makes a brief appearance; he kidnaps Cagalli from Orb during the events of &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;. He has also been featured in two character CDs from the series, with tracks performed by his Japanese voice actor, Sōichirō Hoshi.

Kira has also appeared in various video games in the Gundam franchise, including &quot;Gundam Seed: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T.&quot; and its sequel &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. II&quot;. He is the main playable character in the mobile phone game &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Phase-Act Delivery&quot;. He appears in the Gundam fighting crossover games &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2&quot; and &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3&quot; with Strike Freedom as a playable mobile suit. Other Gundam crossover games also feature Kira as a pilot including &quot;Gundam vs. Gundam Next&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs.&quot;. Another crossover game in which he is playable is &quot;Gundam Assault Survive&quot;, piloting the Strike. Kira, along with other &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; characters, appears in several video games from the &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; series. He appears in &quot;Another Century&#x27;s Episode 3&quot; piloting the Freedom mobile suit and its follow-up, &quot;Another Century&#x27;s Episode R&quot;, with the Strike Freedom.

==Creation and conception==
Director Mitsuo Fukuda stated that initially the story of &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; was written from Kira&#x27;s point of view. Kira&#x27;s personality and thought process were derived from what Fukuda considered to be Japanese people&#x27;s thoughts. He said that his story was about his forced wish to fight, in contrast to Shinn Asuka who was not reluctant to fight in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;. In retrospective, Fukuda emphasized a contrast between both Kira&#x27;s and Shinn&#x27;s characters to the point both were the opposite of each other regarding their opinions; Kira&#x27;s development was easier to script. Fukuda said that as both Kira&#x27;s and Shinn&#x27;s characters as were similar, they were easy to voice. Fukuda said that he was influenced by the September 11 terrorist attacks and formed the image of the main character of &quot;SEED&quot; based on the concept of an Islamic soldier fighting in the US military. The setting in which the mechanics that appear are powered by electricity was influenced by &quot;Gear Fighter Dendoh&quot; which Fukuda previously directed, and when it came to handling the Gundam, he focused on its aspect as a symbol of the character piloting it. Fukuda reclaims having enjoyed the scene from episode 46 based on the emotional support Lacus provides to Kira. Ishida agreed with Fukuda, stating the scene was well directed. For the final episode of the series, Fukuda aimed to bring Kira to his lowest where he becomes unstable when Flay is killed by Rau, leaving a major impact in him, considering himself a failure for failing to protect her. When it came to this scene in both retelling films and HD remaster of the series, Fukuda wanted the original audio to remain the same as he feared adding a song or changing the background music would have ruined it. Following Rau&#x27;s death at Kira&#x27;s hand in the final episode of the series, Fukuda wanted the last scene involving Kira being outside Freedom in space while being rescued by Athrun and Cagalli to change for the remaster for adding a more symbolic tone. 

Kira&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Destiny&quot; was made in order to tell a story from three people&#x27;s point of views: Kira&#x27;s, Athrun&#x27;s and Shinn. Kira&#x27;s quite characterization was the made in order to reflect his trauma in regards to the fights he had in the first &quot;Seed&quot; series. In contrast to the stronger Kira from &quot;Seed&quot; who managed to &quot;devours&quot; other characters, the Kira from &quot;Destiny&quot; was written to lack emotion with the exception of the moments he becomes romantic with Lacus. This was also done to avoid having Kira overshadow Athrun&#x27;s arc again. Another challenge for the director involved the handling of Kira&#x27;s skills when piloting the Freedom and then create a new mobile suit. The director lamented that from the three protagonists, Kira was the least explored character during the making of the series alongside two other characters with major importance: Durandal and Lacus. As Kira was quite an active character in &quot;SEED&quot;, Fukuda undeniably labelled him as the protagonist. In contrast, he was more quiet in &quot;Destiny&quot;, leading to the decision to Athrun and Cagalli being more fitting of being the protagonists. This is more notable in &quot;Destiny&quot; compilation movies where Athrun acts as the main narrator. Fukuda described Kira in &quot;SEED Destiny&quot; as a person who runs away from fights despite often his values for Orb. His characterization was made to change briefly across the story as Kira faced Gilbert Durandal&#x27;s ideals and became a person more compromised with war in contrast to his original pacifist persona after this incarnation was challenged multiple other characters in regards to his actions in the battlefield.

With a new film being released several years after the end of &quot;Destiny&quot;, Fukuda decided to use Kira as the main character, resulting in the subtitle &quot;Freedom&quot;. &quot;Freedom&quot; which serves as one of the main themes of the trilogy and contrasted Gilbert Durandal&#x27;s Destiny Plan used in the climax of the previous series. Fukuda reflected such series left unfinished drama to the protagonists of Kira, Athrun and Shinn and thus wanted to explore such possibilities with &quot;Freedom&quot;. During the course of the movie, Kira is direct to Lacus about his love for her. In an interview following the release of the movie, Mitsuo Fukuda revealed that in regards to the script he made the decision to have Kira be direct to Lacus about his love for her as he felt the time was right for him to express how he felt for Lacus in words in addition to actions.

Fukuda recounts that his wife, late writer Chiaki Morosawa, wanted a character punch Kira due to lack of violence outside mobile suit fights as well as sink the Archangel. Morowasa did not believe that the story could end properly this happened alongside to the destruction of the &quot;Archangel&quot; ship. Regarding the reason for choosing a motorcycle as the vehicle for the two of them rather than a four-wheeled car for marketing Kira and Lacus&#x27; hobbies, Fukuda said, cars feel like they move on a single axis or in a flat manner, but motorcycles also have roll movements, so it&#x27;s more free-flowing. This fits Kira and Lacus, as it symbolizes the freedom that they crave. Fukuda was inspired by his own youth to animate bikes as he relates them with superheroes like &quot;Bari Bari Densetsu&quot;. Though not major in the movie, the bikes Kira and Lacus ride together were hard to animate but Fukuda still personally drew scene. In regards to how they work, the Gold Wing that Kira is riding is a reciprocating engine. Promotions also included a collaboration with &quot;&quot; in the form of an alternate version of &quot;Dune: Part Two&quot;&#x27;s movie poster featuring Lacus and Kira in place of Chani (Zendaya) and Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) respectively.

===Casting===

Fukuda had initial mixed feelings about the portrayal of Kira since he believed him and the famous voice actor were regularly seen in Japanese animes. However, Fukuda was attracted by Soichiro Hoshi&#x27;s popularity and decided to contact him for &quot;Seed&quot;. Akira Ishida was also pictured to be Kira&#x27;s actor but then Fukuda decided to pick Athrun Zala instead. Since Hoshi was one of the youngest voice actors in &quot;Seed&quot;, Fukuda often contacted him about how to properly portrayal; He often told Hoshi that Kira is constantly in a state of sadness in the first episodes as he was going to lose his humanity the more he fought. Hoshi said that the character of Kira was the one who left him the biggest attention in his career. The first half of the anime ended with a meeting between Kira and Athrun were the two act casually as they had to avoid being enemies. In the end, Fukuda praised Hoshi for bringing Kira&#x27;s charm. Hoshi believed Kira managed to mature thanks to Lacus Clyne after his fight with Athrun.

Hoshi expressed joy in voicing the character and was happy when redoing his character&#x27;s lines for the remaster of the series. One of Hoshi&#x27;s favorite lines in the franchise is &quot;I still have a world I want to protect!&quot; in the final episode of &quot;SEED&quot; when facing Rau as he felt it was heartwarming. Another aspect Hoshi enjoyed in regards to his work was how Kira and Athrun become allies in the 39th episode following multiple fights across the anime. In retrospect, Hoshi claims there was brief tension in recording early episodes and was often assisted by Fukuda. Although Kira and Athrun often face each other, Hoshi found no difficulties in voicing their scenes as he often believed the two would reform their friendship with Athrun&#x27;s voice actor Akira Ishida agreeing. 

For the English dub, he is voiced by Matt Hill, who got the role thanks to a friend from the dub&#x27;s director, who told Hill not to have too much energy when doing the voice. The line &quot;Kira Yamato! Launching!&quot; was repeated by Hill several times when obtaining the role. Hill remembers enjoying his work, having taken a liking to the character. Max Mittelman replaced Hill for the NYAV dub.

===Critical response===

Manga and anime publications have commented on Kira&#x27;s character, and he received mainly positive critical responses. IGN&#x27;s Andy Patrizio said Kira&#x27;s character was likable and the only problem he found was how he often repeated Athrun Zala&#x27;s name in early episodes. THEM Anime Reviews&#x27; Derrick L. Tucker said he was one of the strongest characters from the series; Tucker also said he was likable despite his angsty displays. Tucker also compared him with Amuro Ray from the first Gundam series, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, finding both likeable. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment liked Kira&#x27;s handling of the mobile suits and his ability to reprogram them, finding it as a new concept in the Gundam franchise. 

In an analysis of gender roles in anime by Shunyao Yu from University of Jyväskylä, Kira&#x27;s characterization was noted to challenge typical ones by having &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; start with Kira as a sensitive teenager who becomes mature across the narrative. In a further analysis, Kira was noted to be as a mentally unstable forced soldier in the plot due to how Kira starts suffering depression due to failing to protect a ship containing innocent civilians. Kira and Flay&#x27;s relationship are also noted to stand out as &quot;comfort abuse&quot; within the franchise, alongside the narrative of &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,&quot; due to how Flay manipulates Kira to fight for Archangel&#x27;s cause. While in the early episodes of the series, Kira was attracted to her, he had not planned start a relationship with her with sexual tones that felt written to make Flay similar to a prostitute. The writer notes that after Kira&#x27;s apparent death in his fight against Athrun Zala, Flay develops guilt for turning Kira in a soldier. Meanwhile, the fight between Kira and his best friend was commented as the idea of the chaos war can cause.

Kira is described by Sophia Tate from University of Tasmania as a realistic war soldier but more sympathetic than his rivals as, while he suffers grief during, he does not expose such ideals of revenge shown by his friends. His parallels with Athrun were also noted as both characters are treated heavily by their superiors to follow their orders and keep fighting during their war. The relationships Kira develops also result in tragedy in the same way as Athrun&#x27;s, making it especially notable for the viewers as the dying soldiers have had appearances for nearly thirty episodes. In particular, the character&#x27;s actions have been compared with soldiers from World War II. In the book &quot;Japan and Asia: Business, Political and Cultural Interactions&quot;, Kira is noted to be properly linked with the Freedom mobile suit he pilots as his actions can be treated as a terrorist despite the pílot&#x27;s desire to end war at any cost especially in &quot;Destiny&quot;.

Also writing for Mania Entertainment, Kim Wolstenholme was worried about how much Kira&#x27;s and Athrun&#x27;s relationship would be focused in &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;, but liked that Lacus Clyne&#x27;s introduction added tension to it. Ever Cheung from Animefringe who wondered about the future of Kira and Lacus because the two are about to embrace in the anime&#x27;s opening sequence. He said, &quot;If that&#x27;s real, this story may be more interesting than I thought ...&quot; Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network enjoyed Kira&#x27;s and Athrun&#x27;s rivalry which resulted in well-done fight scenes from each of their mobile suits as well as intense drama due to how originally the two were friends. Liversidge praised the development from such rivalry as the two started hating each other and their battle. DVDTalk writer Don Houston considered Kira to be similar to other anime protagonists because he fights for peace and not glory, labeling him the &quot;reluctant hero&quot;, but still praised his character arc in the series without overshadowing other character like Athrun and Cagalli. Due to the origins regarding Kira&#x27;s original nature and his connections with Rau, UK Anime Network expected to see an intense final battle but was sightly disappointed despite enjoying Kira&#x27;s anger displayed in the finale when engaging his enemy.

Besides &quot;SEED&quot;″s television series, Kira&#x27;s actions in the compilation films were commented. Due to the compilation films not carefully adapting the television series, both Anime News Network and the Fandom Post feel like Kira&#x27;s struggle to keep up with his philosophy of not killing and his relationship with Athrun do not work in this format and thus only returning fans might enjoy the movies. While still praising the narrative originally provided in Kira&#x27;s premise, IGN disliked how the game &quot;Locked and Rocked&quot; failed to portray Kira accurately as a result of lacking enough dialogue. In 2021, &quot;UK Anime Network&quot; writer Ross Locksly stated that despite several criticism the Western audience tends to give Kira to the point of calling him a Mary Sue, he still viewed Kira as an outstanding anime character due to his formal and caring demeanor which contrasts stereotypes as well as his constant team ups with Mu la Flaga in the first &quot;SEED&quot; to protect the Archangel from ZAFT forces.

Reviewers have also commented on Kira&#x27;s role in the sequel &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;. Initial reviews mentioned his lack of appearances during the first episodes and whether the new characters could be as appealing as him. He was expected to return in the series to fight the new lead character Shinn Asuka. While writing an article for later episodes, Liversidge found Kira&#x27;s actions more appealing than Shinn&#x27;s, and was looking forward to them. DVDTalk.com shared similar feelings and stated Kira&#x27;s return to the battlefield appears to be a theme &quot;key players from the previous series are forced into positions they aren&#x27;t happy with&quot; something he felt was the focus of Kira&#x27;s group. Luis Cruz from Mania Entertainment found that Kira&#x27;s character expansion developed depth, pointing to one of Kira&#x27;s discussions with Athrun about the relation between people&#x27;s dreams and conflicts. &quot;HobbyConsolas&quot; praised Kira&#x27;s characterization and his relationship with Lacus as an appealing couple due to their mutual caring in &quot;SEED Destiny&quot; as well their actions in the plot. Despite finding flaws within the narrative, Mania liked how Kira is forced to drop his pacifist methods on Stella leading to her death resulting into an appealing conflict between him and Shinn who wants to avenge her. Anime News Network writer Carl Kimlinger said that in the series&#x27; OVA finale, Kira was highly developed. Matt Hill&#x27;s English-language performance in the OVA was criticized in comparison with other voice actors from the series who were praised. Kimlinger said Kira had &quot;grown into a martial leader of Buddha-like calm and compassion&quot;, and that the last OVA allows viewers to enjoy his actions. On the other hand, Manga News claimed that because of Kira comes across as a messiah figure with too much strength in &quot;Destiny&quot; that several viewers of the series were annoyed by such portrayal.

In regards to the film &quot;Gundam SEED Freedom&quot;, Kira was often praised for the focus his romantic relationship with Lacus often being compared with the developers of the movie as the writer had passed away when writing the film and the director happens to be her husband. &quot;&quot; said that the novelization of the movie felt to further explore Kira&#x27;s pain and kindess as he becomes more involved in the war on his own. Kira&#x27;s thoughts are clearly depicted in the novel, and we can see that although he may seem indecisive, he is a man with strong convictions. When Kira becomes brainwashed by the Compass and starts acting against the law, Lacus ironically is the one who others the forces to stop him. The second novel helps to add far more peaceful scenes between Kira and Lacus as a sign of relief to the fans. The second novelization was praised for Lacus joining up with Kira&#x27;s Mighty Strike Freedom more explained than in the movie. The couple is able to pilot the mobile suit together to defeat the leaders of the Compass. Manga News claimed that because Kira comes across as a more flawed in individual in &quot;Freedom&quot; than in &quot;Destiny&quot; when dealing with fights and remembering his encounter with Durandal and philosphy that his character was more enjoyable to watch.

===Controversy===
The sixteenth episode of &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; features a scene in which Kira is seen dressing after getting out of a bed where Flay lies sleeping naked, suggesting a sexual relationship. The Japanese Commission for Better Broadcasting reported that viewers filed complaints regarding the scene as the show was aired at 6 pm when children would be watching. Mainichi replied by mentioning it should have given more careful consideration to the episode before airing it. The scene was extended in one of the compilation films with John Oppliger noting it expanded the off-screen scene with three shots.

<text>Bohemian Football Club (Irish: An Cumann Peile Bóihéamach), more commonly referred to as Bohemians or Bohs, is an Irish professional association football club based in Dublin. Bohemians compete in the Premier Division of the League of Ireland, Bohs are the fourth most successful club in League of Ireland football history, having won the League of Ireland title 11 times, the FAI Cup 7 times, the League of Ireland Shield 6 times and the League of Ireland Cup 3 times. Prior to the establishment of the Football Association of Ireland and League of Ireland, Bohemians competed in the Irish Football League and Irish Cup, which were at the time all-Ireland competitions. During that period they won the Irish Cup once and finished runners up 5 times. They hold the record for Leinster Senior Cup wins with 33 cups claimed.

Bohemians were founded by members of Bell&#x27;s Academy (a Civil Service college), the Royal Hibernian Military School (a school for orphaned children of members of the British armed forces in Ireland), medical students and others, on 6 September 1890 in the Phoenix Park Gate Lodge beside the North Circular Road entrance and played its first games in the Park&#x27;s Polo Grounds. They were one of the founding members of the League of Ireland in 1921, after their withdrawal from the Irish Football League. They established themselves as a major force within the first 15 years of the League of Ireland, winning 5 league titles, 2 FAI Cups and 4 Shields, but struggled for decades after that, largely due to their strict amateur status, going 34 seasons without winning a major trophy. Bohemians dropped their amateur ethos in 1969 and proceeded to win 2 League titles, 2 FAI Cups, and 2 League cups during the season 1970s. They suffered a further decline throughout the 1980s and most of the 1990s before claiming League and Cup doubles in 2001 and 2008, alongside the 2003 and most recently 2009 title wins.

Bohemians play their home matches at Dalymount Park in Phibsborough on the northside of Dublin. They are owned 100% by the members of the club. Their club colours are red and black, which they adopted at the 4th AGM in October 1893. Bohemians supporters often refer to their club by a number of nicknames including Bohs and The Gypsies, and provide one half of a bitter rivalry with southside club, Shamrock Rovers.

==History==

Bohemians were founded on 6 September 1890. They were members of the Irish Football League from 1902 to 1911 (the first club from Dublin to join) and from 1912 to 1920. During this time the club&#x27;s greatest success was winning the Irish Cup in 1908.
It was a founding member of the League of Ireland in 1921, and it is one of only two clubs to have been members of the League of Ireland since its inception (the other being Shelbourne), and it is the only club to have been ever-present in the top division of the league. In its first season it finished second in the league, just two points behind St. James Gate. The club won its first league title in 1924. In 1928 the club won its second league title and completed a double that season by winning its first FAI Cup also. The club was one of the major forces in the early years of the league, going on to win another three league titles and another FAI Cup in the next eight seasons.

After this success the club began to struggle, often finishing at the foot of the league and rarely mounting a title challenge, largely because of an inability to attract or keep top players due to its strict amateur status, which had been a fundamental part of the club since its formation. The club went 34 seasons without winning a major trophy. In 1969 the club ended its amateur status, and the first player to sign professional terms was Tony O&#x27;Connell, who signed on 11 March 1969.

The club then went on to win two league titles, two FAI Cups and two league cups in the 1970s, more trophies than any other club that decade. In 1970 the club entered European competition for the first time where it was beaten in the first qualifying round of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (see below). The club went through another trophy-less spell after its 1979 league cup victory, which was not broken until the club won its fifth FAI Cup in 1992. It was not until 2001 that it regained the league title, also winning the FAI Cup that season to complete its second double. After adding another league title in 2003, Bohemians triumphed once again in 2008, under Pat Fenlon, winning the double of both the league for the tenth time with four league games still to play, and the FAI cup in a penalty shoot-out.
In September 2009, Bohemians claimed the League Cup for the third time in the club&#x27;s history with a 3–1 win over Waterford United in the final.

On 6 November 2009, Bohemians retained the title after a 1–1 draw against Bray Wanderers. They were already assured of the league title before the final round of matches as they held a three-point lead and 16-goal difference advantage over their nearest rivals Shamrock Rovers. Captain Owen Heary collected the Premier Division trophy for the club&#x27;s first back-to-back league win. Bohs narrowly missed out on a hat trick of league titles on goal difference in 2010 in a season which also saw them suffer European disappointment at the hands of Welsh club TNS.

==Stadiums==
Bohemians&#x27; first permanent home ground was on the Polo Ground in Phoenix Park. Goal posts and other equipment were kept at Gate Lodge on North Circular Road (Dublin). They remained there until the 1893–94 season when they obtained a private ground on Jones Road now known as Croke Park, the headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The space then took in the ground previously occupied by the Old Belvedere playing pitches and now occupied by the Cusack Stand. For the first time it was possible for the club to build up some sort of finances, since a charge for admission was made at all important home matches.
They moved to a new home at Whitehall Farm, Glasnevin, in time for the start of the 1895–96 season but in those days, the area was out of the way and without public transport so the Bohemian committee continued to look for a new home ground. Their search came to an end when they moved to Dalymount Park which was officially opened on 7 September 1901.

In 2006 the club&#x27;s members decided to sell Dalymount Park to developer Liam Carroll in a reported €65,000,000 deal, although then board members refused to allow members to see the details of the deal. The deal included the development of a new 10,000-seater stadium in Harristown near Dublin Airport. On 7 November 2008, Bohemians lost a court case versus Albion Ltd, when it was discovered that the board, led by Gerry Cuffe and Gerry Conway, had attempted to re-sell part of the ground which the club no longer owned, which has had the effect of putting the move on hold long enough for the property market to collapse and the deal to be all but dead. In March 2015 Dublin City Council announced that it would purchase Dalymount park. The Council completed the purchase in June 2015 for €3.8million. In February 2016 the Council published plans to demolish and rebuild Dalymount on a phased basis at a cost of €20 million. In October 2022, the council published its updated redevelopment plans, with a proposed capacity of 7,880, and a completion date of 2026. It is likely that Bohemians would need to play elsewhere during redevelopment.

==European record==
Although they did not make their first appearance in European competition until 1970, they have, like all Irish clubs, found the going tough in Europe, but they have had some famous successes too. Their finest hour came when they eliminated Scottish Premier League club (and former Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and European Super Cup champions) Aberdeen from the UEFA Cup in August 2000. That triumph was set up by a dramatic 2–1 victory away from home, in which Bohs scored 2 late goals to overturn a 1–0 deficit. That was the first time an Irish club defeated British opposition away from home in European competition. Other notable results include wins against Rangers and Kaiserslautern (away) and draws against Rangers, Newcastle United, Sporting CP, Dundee United (away) and Aberdeen. In all, they have beaten a total of 11 different teams, from 9 countries (Denmark, Cyprus, Scotland, Germany, Estonia, Belarus, Belgium, Wales and Latvia). Bohs bowed out of the 2008 Intertoto Cup on away goals to Latvian side FK Riga despite winning the second leg 2–1. Earlier in that campaign they recorded their biggest single leg (5–1) and aggregate (9–3) wins in Europe (against Welsh Premier League club Rhyl).

Bohemians started their 2009–10 UEFA Champions League campaign away to Austrian Bundesliga champions Red Bull Salzburg on 16 July 2009 with a 1–1 draw in Salzburg.
In the second leg on 22 July 2009, Bohemians held out until an 87th-minute goal by Patrik Ježek for Red Bull Salzburg gave them a one-nil victory on the night and two one win on aggregate.
After retaining the league title in 2009, Bohs entered the Champions League again in 2010–11. They were drawn against Welsh side The New Saints in the Second Qualifying Round, and won the first leg 1–0 at Dalymount Park on 13 July 2010. They lost the second leg 4–0 and were eliminated 4–1 on aggregate. Bohs manager Pat Fenlon later labelled the performance as &#x27;disgraceful&#x27; and said &#x27;the players let the club, league and country down&#x27;. The result was labelled by others as the worst result in Bohs&#x27; 40-year European history.

After a nearly a decade away from continental competition, Bohs faced Hungarian opposition in the form of Fehérvár in the 2020-2021 UEFA Europa League qualifiers. The gypsies narrowly missed out by virtue of a penalty shoot-out loss, decided after a solitary one-legged affair was played, due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Bohs entered the inaugural Europa Conference League the year after and consecutively sold out their home matches at Dublin&#x27;s Aviva Stadium in matches with Stjarnan FC and F91 Dudelange, both home legs ending with famous 3-0 victories.

&quot;Bohs&quot; 2021 European campaign came to end in Thessalonika after defeat to PAOK, when they lost the 3–2 on aggregate, following a heroic win in the first leg at the Aviva Stadium on 3 August, when Scottish winger Ali Coote scored a brace in what has to rank as one of the best ever wins by an Irish team in Europe. The Greek side had just signed ex Dortmund and Manchester United star Shinji Kagawa and had a budget of circa €75M compared to the Bohemian&#x27;s estimated €750,000. On 12 August the Irish team bowed out of the Europa Conference League Qualification campaign after their fans were denied access to the stadium amid protests from the home fans about Covid restrictions, following a 2–0 defeat on the night in a tense Thessalonika atmosphere.

===Overview===
===Matches===
==Supporters and rivalries==

Bohs&#x27; fan base is mainly drawn from the northside of Dublin and their supporters share a bitter rivalry with Southside club, Shamrock Rovers. However, the club has many fans from other parts of the city, across Ireland and worldwide. The club shares a rivalry with their Northside neighbours Shelbourne largely because of geographical proximity as both clubs are now located roughly just 1 mile apart, and also because they featured prominently in the early days of Dublin football, when nationwide football was still based around Belfast. Shelbourne and Bohs were often featured in the Belfast-centered Irish Football League before partition and the rivalry was kept on-off after they formed the new Irish Free State league with Shamrock Rovers and other clubs.

During 2006, a number of Bohemians fans formed an ultra group in an effort to create a more interesting atmosphere at home games. Ironically named The Notorious Boo-Boys (or NBB, a term used by journalists to disparage the patience of Bohs fans), the group bought flags and organised displays during games to lift the atmosphere of the home of Irish football Dalymount Park. The fans have friendly contacts with Prague club Bohemians 1905, Welsh club Wrexham AFC, Swedish club Malmö FF as well as English non-league and fellow supporter owned club FC United of Manchester.

The club boasts some well known supporters such as Johnny Logan, Samuel L. Jackson, Aslan&#x27;s Christy Dignam, alternative band Royseven, post-punk band Fontaines D.C., as well as musicians Brush Shiels, Rob Smith and novelist Irvine Welsh. The club also has a working relationship with Hibernian FC of Edinburgh.

==Women==

On 27 November 2018, Bohemians were accepted to the Under-17 Women&#x27;s National League beginning with the 2019 season. The aim was to grow the number of women in the club and eventually compete in the Women&#x27;s National League. The historic first game in the Under-17 Women&#x27;s National League for Bohemians was played on 13 April 2019 against Cork City and ended in 0–2 defeat.

Just one year after being accepted to compete in the Under-17 Women&#x27;s National League, Bohemians was accepted to the Women&#x27;s National League on 18 February 2020. The first match was originally scheduled for 15 March 2020, however, the team was made to wait until 8 August 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland which delayed the start of the season. The game ended in a 4–1 defeat to Wexford Youth. Chloe Darby scored the consolation goal and wrote herself into the history books as Bohemians&#x27; first-ever female goalscorer.

==Bohemians Academy==

Bohemians compete with elite teams in the underage National Leagues at all available age groups: U19, U17, U15 and U14 for boys. And U17 and U19 age groups for girls.

Beyond the elite teams, Bohemians have over 500 boys and girls playing across 35+ teams, which compete in the DDSL, NDSL and MGL.

===Academy Staff===
===Bohemian Futsal===
Bohemian Futsal compete in the AUL Futsal Premier Division, the winners of which compete in the UEFA Futsal Champions League preliminary rounds. Bohs also have a &#x27;B&#x27; team that compete in the AUL Futsal Division One. They are the only League of Ireland club with a futsal club.

==Training Ground and DCU partnership==

In 2021, Dublin City University and Bohemians agreed an 18-year multi-faceted partnership involving football, social inclusion, social outreach and academic programme collaboration. As part of the arrangement, DCU Sports Campus became Bohemians’ training base. Bohemians committed to invest around €1.5 million into the facility. The training complex has numerous full-size all-weather pitches, grass pitches, high performance gym, club offices, meeting rooms, physio rooms and kit room.

<text>Shelbourne Football Club is an Irish professional football club based in Drumcondra, Dublin, currently playing in the League of Ireland Premier Division. They are the reigning Premier Division champions and managed by former Ireland international Damien Duff.

==Overview==
With its first name being associated with its more common nickname, &quot;Shels&quot;, the club plays its home matches at Tolka Park, in the Dublin suburb of Drumcondra. Founded in Dublin in 1895, Shelbourne F.C.&#x27;s colours are primarily red and white, with home jerseys being predominantly red though in the club’s first season they wore sky blue and chocolate following an error with the kit order.

In 1904, the club joined the Irish Football League, which was then an all-Ireland competition, before becoming one of the founding members of the League of Ireland in 1921, winning their first title in the 1925–26 season. Shelbourne have won the league 14 times and are one of just three clubs to have won both the IFA Cup and the FAI Cup.

In the 2004–05 European season, Shelbourne became the first Irish club to reach the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. Their performances in European competition and former striker Jason Byrne being capped for the Republic of Ireland whilst with the club, gained Shelbourne international exposure. In the 2023 season, Shelbourne marked another milestone as they qualified for the Europa Conference League qualifiers for the first time in their history.

The club lost their Premier Division licence for the 2007 season due to the club&#x27;s debt situation. Although the club was saved, since then, Shelbourne had mainly played in the second tier of the League of Ireland with short stints back in the Premier Division in 2012, 2013 and 2020. The club were promoted back to the Premier Division in 2021 and have been competing back in the top flight since then, winning the Premier Division in 2024

==History==

===Formation &amp; IFA years: 1895–1921===
Shelbourne Football Club was formed in 1895 in the Ringsend area of Dublin by a group of men led by James Rowan. The club took its name from the nearby Shelbourne Road. The club&#x27;s first pitch was at Havelock Square just behind the north stand at the present day Aviva Stadium.

Shelbourne&#x27;s second season was their first in competitive competition. Shelbourne played 28 matches, won 25, drew two and lost only one. Their goal tally was 109 for and 15 against. Shelbourne won the principal junior competitions, the Leinster Junior Cup and League Championship. The club decided to enter the senior ranks for the 1897–98 season and reached the Leinster Senior Cup final at their first attempt, only to lose to Bohemians. They also finished runners-up in the Leinster Senior League. The club won their first Leinster Senior Cup in 1899/1900, winning the competition again in 1901 and 1904.

The club made it to the final of the IFA Cup in 1905 but were beaten by Distillery. The following year Shelbourne defeated Belfast Celtic in the Cup Final 2–0 at Dalymount Park and became the first Southern club to win the IFA Cup, according to a Dublin newspaper &quot;Tar Barrels and bonfires were blazing across Ringsend and Sandymount that night as the Irish Cup was paraded around the district&quot;. In 1906 Shelbourne player Val Harris became the club&#x27;s first player to line out for Ireland. In 1906 Shelbourne won their fourth Leinster Senior Cup, the club also playing in a charity match against Bohemians the same year and raised more than 100 pounds to build a church in Ringsend. Shelbourne reached the IFA Cup Final again in 1907 and 1908 but were beaten on both occasions in replays against Cliftonville and Bohemians, respectively. In 1907 Shelbourne were also Irish Football League runners-up to Linfield. They won the Leinster Senior Cup again in 1908 and 1909. In 1909 Shelbourne were City Cup winners and finished third place in the Irish Football League, behind champions Linfield and Glentoran. In 1911 Shelbourne won the IFA Cup for their second time and went on to win the Leinster Senior Cup again in 1913 and 1914. Shelbourne were 1914 Gold Cup runners-up, and then winners in 1915, were Leinster Senior Cup winners again in 1917 and 1919, and winners of the IFA Cup once more, in 1920, after the other semi-final was declared void as both of the teams involved (Belfast Celtic and Glentoran) were ejected from the competition, before Shelbourne&#x27;s association with the Irish Football Association was to come to an end.

===Founder Members of the League of Ireland: 1921–1929===
:&quot;Additional reading: IFA#North-South Split&quot;

Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Partition of Ireland and establishment of the Irish Free State, the League of Ireland was formed for clubs in the 26 counties of Ireland that had regained independence from the United Kingdom. The immediate cause of the split lay in a bitter dispute over the venue for the replay of an Irish Cup match in 1921 involving Glentoran of Belfast and Shelbourne. When the first cup match was drawn in Belfast, because of the Irish war of independence, the IFA reneged on a promise to play the replay in Dublin and scheduled the rematch again for Belfast. Shelbourne refused to comply and forfeited the Cup. Such was the anger over the issue that the Leinster FA broke away from the IFA and formed its own national association, the present-day Football Association of Ireland. Shelbourne became one of the original League of Ireland founder clubs along with Bohemians, St James&#x27;s Gate, Jacobs, Olympia, Frankfort, Dublin United and YMCA.

In the opening 1921–22 season, Shelbourne finished in third place behind winners St James&#x27;s Gate and Bohemians. Shelbourne finished runners-up the following two seasons and won the 1924 Leinster Senior Cup. &quot;The Reds&quot; finished third in the league again in the 1924–25 season before winning the league for their first time the following season in 1925–26. They finished runners-up the following two years before winning the 1928–29 Championship.

===Thirties: 1930–1939===
:&quot;Additional reading: Reds United&quot;
Having failed to retain the title in 1930, &quot;Shels&quot; won their third league title in 1931 and were Leinster Senior Cup winners that same year. In 1934 the club got into a dispute with the Irish Free State F.A. when they looked for compensation after the FAIFS had arranged a match for the same day that Shelbourne had a match scheduled. In the row that followed, &quot;Shels&quot; resigned from the League and were then suspended from football for a year by the FAI. The club played no football during the 1934–35 season and spent the 1935–36 season in the Athletic Union League before being re-admitted to the League of Ireland for the start of the 1936–37 season. During the 1935–36 season a team called Reds United, made up of a number of Shelbourne players and backed by &quot;Shels&quot; personnel, competed in the League of Ireland and finished a respectable fourth. At the end of the season, they resigned from the League to make way for Shelbourne’s return.

The decade had a happy ending, though, as success in the FAI Cup finally arrived (many fans had started to believe the club was suffering from a curse): it was in the 1939 Cup Final that the supposed curse was broken. Sligo Rovers who boasted Dixie Dean, the goalscoring legend of the Football League, were eventually beaten after a replay thanks to a long-range goal from &#x27;Sacky&#x27; Glen. After so many attempts, the blue ribbon of Irish football made its way to Shelbourne Park for the first time. Official figures put the attendances at 30,000 and 25,000 for the first final and the replay respectively.

===Forties: 1940–1949===
As the euphoria of the first FAI Cup success wore off, the forties started slowly enough for &quot;the Reds&quot;, and it wasn&#x27;t until 1944 that the league championship was won again — for a fourth time — along with the Shield. The title was clinched after an epic 5–3 win over local rivals Shamrock Rovers. Luck was reversed though in the FAI Cup Final as Rovers stopped the Reds from winning the treble. Shelbourne went down 3–2 but felt aggrieved that the referee only awarded them a penalty when it seemed a Rovers defender had handled the ball after it went over the goal-line, as the subsequent penalty was missed. The club issued a 48 page brochure to mark its&#x27; golden jubilee in 1945. &quot;Shels&quot; won another Leinster Senior Cup in 1946.

Another league title, however, was wrapped up on the last day in 1947 and was again secured against Shamrock Rovers.

The closing of the decade marked the end of an era. In April 1949, Shelbourne drew 2–2 against Waterford in what was the club&#x27;s final competitive game at Shelbourne Park. The plan was that the team would build a new stadium in Irishtown. The 1948–49 season also saw &quot;Shels&quot; win their seventh Shield and 14th Leinster Senior Cup.

===Fifties: 1950–1959===
In 1951, Shelbourne made it to the FAI Cup final where they met Cork Athletic who had already wrapped up the league. Tommy Carberry had scored in every round for &quot;the Reds&quot; and did so again in the final, played in front of over 38,900 fans, but it was only good enough to earn a replay which Athletic won. A sixth league title was won in 1953, and then in 1955–56 &quot;Shels&quot; played their only season in Irishtown Stadium. The ground, however, was far from complete despite a huge amount of voluntary work being carried out by supporters and offered no shelter for the fans from the elements. The following season Shelbourne were tenants across the bay at Tolka Park.

During that season Gerry Doyle was appointed manager and a new era was being ushered in for the team. The FAI Youth Cup was won in 1959 and Doyle was true to his word, &quot;if they&#x27;re good enough, they&#x27;re old enough&quot; and six of the Youth Cup-winning team became first-team regulars. Amongst them was Tony Dunne who would be later transferred to Manchester United with whom he picked up a European Cup winners medal in 1968.

===Sixties: 1960–1969===
:&quot;Additional reading: Shelbourne F.C. in Europe&quot;
The early years of the sixties went great for &quot;the Reds&quot;. Three-goal wins over Bohemians, Shamrock Rovers and Dundalk put Shelbourne in the 1960 FAI Cup Final where they beat Cork Hibernians 2–0 to get their hands on the trophy for only the second time. Cork Celtic were beaten by a Ben Hannigan goal in a play-off for the league in 1962 and only illness to three key players as a result of vaccinations taken on a League of Ireland XI trip to Italy prevented Shelbourne from winning the FAI Cup and a first &#x27;double&#x27; as they went down to Shamrock Rovers in the final despite being red-hot favourites. The FAI Cup was, however, won the following year and it was a repeat of the 1960 final: a 2–0 win over Cork Hibs.

With this success came the excitement of European club football. Shelbourne played their first European match against Sporting Clube de Portugal in 1962: they were beaten 2–0 in the first leg held at Dalymount Park and then 5–1 in Portugal to go out 7–1 on aggregate. The following season they took on FC Barcelona in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup but were beaten 5–1 on aggregate. In 1963 Shelbourne won another Leinster Senior Cup. In 1964 the club finally sold their last interest in Irishtown Stadium. Shelbourne won their first European game and tie in the 1964–65 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, after the first leg resulted in a 0–0 draw and the second leg finished 1–1. They won a playoff match against Portuguese side Belenenses, although the following round they were eliminated 2–0 on aggregate by Atlético Madrid. On 19 November 1967, in a match between Shelbourne and rivals Bohemians, Shelbourne player Jimmy O&#x27;Connor set the record for the world&#x27;s fastest hat-trick in top tier domestic league history, scoring three goals in two minutes and 13 seconds at Dalymount Park. Shelbourne won the Leinster Senior Cup in 1968. In the years that followed, televised highlights of English football began to be broadcast into Ireland and the crowds around most of the league grounds plummeted. Clubs in the league came under huge financial pressure, players left for England at a younger age, grounds became derelict, and media coverage almost disappeared.

===Decline in the seventies and eighties: 1970–1989===
There was a bright enough start to the seventies as Athlone Town were beaten in the Shield final second replay, a win that would see &quot;the Reds&quot; enter the new UEFA Cup the following season. However, it was to be the last trophy the club would win for some time apart from their Leinster Senior Cup win in 1972. Cork Hibs beat &quot;Shels&quot; in the replay of the 1973 FAI Cup Final in Flower Lodge — the only time the final was ever played outside Dublin — while Shelbourne were eliminated from the UEFA Cup by Hungarians Vasas SC in what would be their last European game for 21 years. Two years later Shelbourne were shocked in the Cup final by amateurs Home Farm. During this time the club&#x27;s ongoing problems were covered in a ground-breaking RTÉ fly-on-the-wall documentary entitled &quot;In My Book You Should Be Ahead&quot;. In 1978, Jimmy Johnstone, a European Cup winner with Celtic in 1967, signed briefly for the club. &#x27;Jinky&#x27; only played nine games for &quot;the Reds&quot; and the European Cup winner failed to score in any of his appearances.

In 1984, Shelbourne lost out to Shamrock Rovers in the FAI Cup semi-final replay. As the league was to expand to two divisions in the summer of 1985, the bottom four clubs at the end of the 1984/85 season were to be relegated. Needing a win on the last day of the season, &quot;Shels&quot; found themselves two goals down at half-time away to Galway United. However, a heroic comeback ensued and the team scored three goals to take both points and avoid the drop. But the reprieve only lasted twelve months, as Shelbourne were relegated on goal difference after finishing level on 13 points with Cork but on −25 goal difference compared to Cork&#x27;s −21. &quot;Shels&quot; stay in the First Division was short-lived though, as they came back up straight away with Derry City. After two decades and more in the doldrums, the grey skies were clearing. Tony Donnelly took over the club in 1989 and started to invest heavily. &quot;Shels&quot; were out of the derelict Harold&#x27;s Cross Stadium and taking over Tolka Park. Former Irish international Pat Byrne was installed as player-manager, and a plethora of new players arrived shortly after to bring back the glory days.

===Return to success: 1990–1999===
:&quot;Additional reading: Shelbourne F.C. in Europe&quot;
The heavy investment in the club by the Donnelly family gave an almost instant return as Shelbourne captured their eighth league title at the end of the 1991/92 season – the first for 30 years – when they won 3–1 away to outgoing champions Dundalk. Despite only needing a draw, Brian Flood sealed the win with a spectacular goal from 35 yards. Although the league title was lost the following season after two series of play-offs involving Cork City and Bohemians, the FAI Cup was won, again after a 30-year wait, when a Greg Costello header was enough to defeat Dundalk in Lansdowne Road. The club made a return to European competitions after a 21-year wait in 1992 when they faced Ukrainian club SC Tavriya Simferopol in the newly formed UEFA Champions League. Despite holding the Ukrainians to a scoreless draw in Dublin they were beaten 2–1 in Ukraine and eliminated from the competition. The following season Shelbourne won their first game in Europe for 30 years when they beat FC Karpaty Lviv of Ukraine and advanced to play Greek Giants Panathinaikos but were beaten 5–1 on aggregate. Byrne and his assistant Jim McLaughlin were dismissed that October and replaced by Eoin Hand. Later that season &quot;the Reds&quot; won yet another Leinster Senior Cup.

Two seasons later they were beaten 6–0 on aggregate by Icelandic club ÍA Akraness in the UEFA Cup, the previous season they finished third in the league and just two points behind winners Dundalk. Both the League Cup and the FAI Cup were won in sensational circumstances in 1996 under Damien Richardson. The League Cup was won, for the first time, in a penalty shootout against Sligo Rovers after &quot;Shels&quot; had come from two-down late on. In the FAI Cup Final against St. Patrick&#x27;s, Shels were reduced early on to 10 men as keeper Alan Gough was sent off and, with no sub keeper, midfielder Brian Flood played 70 minutes in goal. Despite trailing 1–0, Tony Sheridan equalised with a stunning lob in the last couple of minutes to force a replay. With Alan Gough back in goal for the rematch, &quot;Shels&quot; won the trophy after Gough saved a late penalty and Stephen Geoghegan scored an even later winner. Shelbourne became only the third club to retain the FAI Cup when they defeated Derry City 2–0 in the 1997 final, but fell to SK Brann in the 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Preliminary round.

The 1997–98 season brought heartbreak. &quot;Shels&quot; lost the League Cup Final to Sligo Rovers, the FAI Cup Final to Cork City after a replay and, missed out on the league title on the final day of the season. They were also narrowly eliminated from the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup by Kilmarnock. Richardson departed after this disappointment and in stepped the uncompromising Dermot Keely. Keely&#x27;s first season ended in disappointment: Shelbourne finished third in the league and were knocked out of the FAI Cup at the semifinal stage. In the first Qualifying round of the 1998–99 UEFA Cup Shelbourne were drawn against Glasgow side and one of the Old Firm teams, Rangers. Due to security concerns Shelbourne&#x27;s home leg was moved to Prenton Park in Birkenhead. Despite leading the first leg at Tranmere’s ground 3–0, Shelbourne were beaten 5–3 and later beaten 2–0 in the second leg. In the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup Shelbourne were beaten in the first round by Swiss club Neuchâtel Xamax.

===Glory years, European success &amp; financial implosion: 2000–2006===
:&quot;Additional reading: Shelbourne F.C. Seasons&quot;
:&quot;Additional reading: Shelbourne F.C. in Europe&quot;
After a mediocre first season, Dermot Keely brought &quot;Shels&quot; a historic first-ever League and FAI Cup double in 1999–2000. Having secured the league with a 2–0 win in Waterford which saw Shelbourne lose just once before then, the double was claimed thanks to a Pat Fenlon goal in the FAI Cup final replay away in Dalymount Park against Bohemians. The following season, though, saw &quot;Shels&quot; again let the league title slip away on the last day. Shelbourne beat Macedonian club FK Sloga Jugomagnat to set up a tie with Rosenborg BK, but were eliminated by the Norwegians 4–2 on aggregate.

The 2001–02 season was dogged by controversy as title challengers St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic were docked nine points for fielding an unregistered player in accordance with the league&#x27;s rules, before having them restored. The league eventually docked them 15 points when it emerged a second unregistered player had played five games. This all led to Shelbourne claiming their 10th league title, in the same season they were eliminated from the UEFA Cup in the preliminary round by Danish club Brøndby.
Under new manager Pat Fenlon the title was missed out on in 2002–03 and Shelbourne were knocked out in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League first qualifying round by Maltese side Hibernians. Then for the first time ever, the club won back-to-back titles in 2003 and 2004 as the league changed to a summer season, although they were eliminated from the 2003–04 UEFA Cup in the competition’s opening round by Slovenians NK Olimpija Ljubljana. Shelbourne entered the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds in the first round. After beating KR Reykjavík they advanced to face the then-Croatian League Champions HNK Hajduk Split. After the first leg in Croatia, Shelbourne were trailing 3–2, but thanks to a 2–0 victory at home Shelbourne advanced 4–3 on aggregate, becoming the first Irish club to reach the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League and pulling off one of the biggest upsets in European competitions by an Irish club. However, Shelbourne&#x27;s historic Champions League run came to an end when they were beaten by Spanish club, Deportivo La Coruña 3–0 on aggregate, having achieved a 0–0 draw in Lansdowne Road in front of 25,000 fans. That season the club also set a record for the longest European run in Irish history, a record they held for seven more seasons. After the Champions League exit at the hands of Deportivo the club was entered into the UEFA Cup. There, &quot;Shels&quot; met French side Lille and were beaten 4–2 on aggregate, having come back from a two-goal deficit in Lansdowne Road to achieve a creditable draw thanks to a brace from substitute Glen Fitzpatrick. Shelbourne went on to win the League in 2004.

Having just failed to make the group stages of the Champions League and UEFA Cup in 2004, &quot;Shels&quot; brought in big-name players for the 2005 season, but only finished third in the league and lost to Linfield in the first-ever Setanta Cup Final at Tolka Park, after beating Glentoran. In the first qualifying round of the Champions League they were knocked out 4–1 on aggregate by Romanian club SC Fotbal Club FCSB SA, despite holding the Bucharest powerhouse to a 0–0 draw in the first leg at Tolka Park.
2006 saw a change in fortunes for Shelbourne, with &quot;The Reds&quot; winning the title on the last day of the season on goal difference from the old Derry City, the first time a club had won the title on goal difference following a rule change in 1993. They also managed to reach the Intertoto Cup semi-finals in the Northern Region after beating Lithuanian club FK Vėtra 5–0 on aggregate, the largest victory in European Competitions for Shelbourne, but they were knocked out of the competition by Danish side Odense BK 3–1 on aggregate — &quot;The Reds&quot; had been beaten 3–0 in the first leg at Fionia Park in Odense but earned a very respectable 1–0 win at Tolka, remaining undefeated at home in Europe for eight games, an Irish record. In 2006 Shelbourne also reached the League of Ireland Cup final for the first time since 1998 but lost on penalties. That same year, Shelbourne became a member of the &#x27;European Club Forum&#x27;.

However, after ongoing financial problems for Shelbourne during the 2006 season, Pat Fenlon resigned as manager and the vast majority of players left,
some for rival clubs; others to British clubs.

===Demotion to the second tier: 2007–2011===
:&quot;Additional reading: Shelbourne F.C. Seasons&quot;
Shelbourne withdrew from the 2007 Setanta Sports Cup and before the start of the new league season were demoted to the First Division by the FAI. The club announced on 29 March 2007 that they would not be applying for a UEFA licence to compete in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds. The club&#x27;s majority shareholder Oliver Byrne suffered a brain tumour (he died in August 2007) though Joe Casey had already taken over as chairman. Former manager Dermot Keely was brought back in and assembled a squad just in time for the club to take its place in the 2007 League of Ireland First Division. A respectable fifth-place finish in the top half of the table was secured.

In the 2008 campaign, with promotion close a last-minute goal by Limerick 37 in Tolka Park gave Dundalk the division title and the accompanying promotion. In 2008 the club left the disbanded European Club Forum and joined its replacement, the European Club Association, only to leave this organisation the following year. In 2009, the chance for promotion again evaporated when &quot;Shels&quot; lost 1–2 at home to Sporting Fingal in the promotion/relegation play-off semi-final.

In 2010 former &quot;Reds&quot; player Alan Mathews became the new manager. Under Mathews, Shelbourne won the 2010 Leinster Senior Cup and later that year narrowly missed out on a place in the promotion play-offs thanks to a 2–1 defeat at home to Waterford United on the final day of the season.

2011 was a year of mixed fortunes for Shelbourne: a change in the promotion rules allowing automatic promotion to both the First Division Champions and
Runners-up, which proved to be beneficial for Shelbourne. &quot;The Reds&quot; clinched promotion back to the Premier Division thanks to a 4–0 home victory against Finn Harps on 25 October. 2011 was also a memorable Cup year for Shelbourne, as they were drawn to play Sheriff Y.C. in the fourth round, although despite leading the game by two goals, Shelbourne were beaten by Sheriff 3–2. However, Sheriff were subsequently found to have fielded an ineligible player, were ejected from the Cup, and as a result Shelbourne were moved in to the quarter-finals. After victories over Limerick in the quarter-final and St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic in a semi-final replay, after playing with ten men in the first meeting, they secured a place in the 2011 FAI Cup Final, where they were beaten 4–1 on penalties by Sligo Rovers after the game finished 1–1 after extra time.

===Brief return to the top-flight, First Division: 2012–2019===
:&quot;Additional reading: Shelbourne F.C. Seasons&quot;

2012 saw Shelbourne finish eighth out of 11 teams on their return to the Premier Division. The club also reached the Cup semi-finals, losing to Derry in a Replay at Tolka Park. However Shelbourne stayed in the top flight for just two seasons, with &quot;the Reds&quot; finishing bottom of the 2013 Premier Division Alan Mathews was replaced by Johnny McDonnell as manager on 24 May 2013. The 2014 season saw Shelbourne finish second in the First Division, and the club thus advanced to a promotion playoff against Galway FC. Galway FC won the two-legged tie, and Shels remained in the First Division. At the end of the 2014 campaign, McDonnell left to manage Drogheda United and was replaced by Kevin Doherty.

The 2015 season saw the club finish fourth in the league. A disappointing 2016 campaign ended in a sixth-place finish. Former player Owen Heary took over as manager midway through the season following the resignation of Kevin Doherty. In 2017, Heary&#x27;s first full season as manager ended in a fourth-place league finish. In 2018, the team qualified for a promotion playoff after a third-place finish. &quot;Shels&quot; lost in the first round to Drogheda over two legs. In 2019, however, Shelbourne would regain promotion to the Premier Division for the first time since 2013 by winning the First Division. They claimed the title with a 3–1 away win over Drogheda at United Park on 14 September 2019.

=== Return to the Premier Division, relegation, promotion and League of Ireland title win: 2020–24 ===
In 2020, Shelbourne competed in the Premier Division for the first time since 2013. They were condemned to the First Division once again at the end of the 2020 via a promotion/relegation playoff, but secured a return after winning promotion and the 2021 First Division championship on 1 October 2021. The following month former Irish international Damien Duff was appointed as first team manager. In late 2021, the club, in association with Hope Brewery, launched its&#x27; own beer. 
Having investigated the purchase of Dundalk F.C. in early 2023, Turkish media company Acun Medya, owners of EFL Championship side Hull City, announced the purchase of Shelbourne in June 2023.

In November 2023, the club announced the restructuring of its shareholdings, with the acquisition by long-term supporter and shareholder Mickey O’Rourke, founder of Setanta Sports, through TDL Media, the shareholding of Acun Medya. In the same month, the men&#x27;s side qualified for UEFA 
club competition after finishing fourth in the league and Bohemians losing the FAI Cup final. 

On 1 November 2024, Shelbourne won the 2024 League of Ireland Premier Division after a 1-0 win against Derry City at the Brandywell as Damien Duff&#x27;s team rounded off a surprise title winning season with the winning goal coming five minutes from the season&#x27;s end to win on the final day having started the season at 25/1 for the title. The final day decider attracted the largest ever tv audience for a League of Ireland game.

In February 2025, Shels won the season curtain raiser, the President of Ireland&#x27;s Cup, for the first time defeating Drogheda United 2:0 in Tolka Park. 

==Stadium==
:&quot;Additional reading: Tolka Park&quot;
In 1989 Shelbourne acquired the lease on Tolka Park from Dublin Corporation. Before moving to Drumcondra, &quot;Shels&quot; had most recently been based in Harold&#x27;s Cross Stadium, while prior to that they had been housed in Shelbourne Park, for one season Irishtown Stadium and occasionally Dalymount Park. &quot;Shels&quot; had played home games regularly in Tolka during the fifties, sixties, seventies, and early eighties. Before Tolka Park was home to Shelbourne it housed Drumcondra F.C. from 1924 until 1972 when Drumcondra unexpectedly went out of business, vacating the ground. Home Farm were the next tenants in Tolka Park, but the club never drew large crowds. When Shelbourne moved into the ground they invested heavily in the stadium, converting it into Ireland&#x27;s first all-seater stadium and building a new stand behind the Drumcondra end goal in 1999. The first-ever League of Ireland match to be broadcast live on TV was a fixture between Shelbourne and Derry City, staged at Tolka Park during the 1996–97 season.

In 2016, the club announced a future move as co-tenants of Dublin City Council-owned Dalymount Park once redevelopment was completed around 2020. In 2021, the redevelopment was planned to conclude by 2025. The same year however, a coalition of Shels fans, local residents and political activists launched a &quot;Save Tolka Park&quot; campaign. 

In May 2024, the council granted the club a 250-year lease on Tolka Park. This followed proposals in 2022 for the club to repurchase the ground.

==Supporters and rivalries==
The club&#x27;s fanbase is mainly drawn from the northside of Dublin although there are a number of supporters from the Southside, mainly the Ringsend area where the club originates from. The average home league attendance for 2024 was 4,269.

&#x27;Briogáid Dearg&#x27; (&quot;Red Brigade&quot;) was formed in 2003 and is the club&#x27;s single Ultras group. &#x27;Reds Independent&#x27; are a Shelbourne supporters group formed in 1998 after Shelbourne FC moved their home UEFA Cup tie with Rangers out of the country and to Prenton Park, the home of Tranmere Rovers FC. The group gives Shelbourne fans an independent voice, through &quot;Red Inc.&quot;, one of the longest-running fanzines in the world. &quot;Red Inc.&quot; was first sold as a sixteen-page publication priced fifty pence for a home league tie against Cork City on 31 January 1999. The &#x27;Shelbourne Supporters&#x27; Development Group&#x27; was founded in 2006 with the aim of securing badly needed funding from the Shelbourne supporter base. The Group have been promised shares in Shelbourne FC Ltd and representation on the board if it raises a certain amount of money for Shelbourne FC each year.
In October 2012 a Shelbourne FC Supporters&#x27; Trust was agreed to be launched by fans. The Trust&#x27;s name was officially voted as &quot;The 1895 Trust&quot; in celebration of the founding year of the club. The Trust was officially launched in 2013.

In 2016, some Reds voiced their opposition to the board&#x27;s proposal to have Tolka Park redeveloped for housing and the men&#x27;s senior team to become tenants in Dalymount Park. The final home match of the season against Waterford United was halted due to the protests. &quot;Reds Independent&quot; fans group called for a boycott following the club&#x27;s failure to engage with fans on issues surrounding the proposed move.

Shelbourne shares a rivalry with Bohemians largely because of geographical proximity as both clubs are now located roughly just one mile apart, and also because of their early days in the old Belfast-centered Irish League and the early Irish Free State league. The club also has rivalries with other Dublin sides: St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic are also rivals, with both sides having a fierce rivalry filling stadiums on derby day; &quot;Shels&quot; also have a derby with Shamrock Rovers named the Ringsend derby. Some Shelbourne fans share long friendships with fans from Danish club Brøndby IF as well as Italian club AS Roma. 

==European football==
Shelbourne have a long, illustrious history in European competitions, taking on clubs such as Sporting Lisbon, Barcelona, Atlético Madrid, Panathinaikos, Rangers, Rosenborg, Brøndby, Hajduk Split, Deportivo de La Coruña, Lille, FCSB (formerly Steaua Bucharest), and FC Zürich.

Shelbourne first performed on the European stage in the 1962-63 season, taking on Sporting Lisbon in the European Cup. From 1995 to 2006, Shelbourne had been ever-present in European competition and enjoyed a considerable amount of success.

Due to the club&#x27;s recent decline, they had been unranked in the UEFA Team Rankings, but have re-emerged in the 2024-25 rankings with 377 club coefficient points. The club will return to the UEFA Champions League qualifiers in 2025.

==Other teams==

===Women’s team===

In 2015 Shelbourne Ladies took over Raheny United&#x27;s senior women&#x27;s team. This effectively saw Shelbourne Ladies replace Raheny United in the Women&#x27;s National League. During the subsequent 2015–16 season, Shelbourne Ladies finished as runners-up in the FAI Women&#x27;s Cup, the WNL Shield and the Women&#x27;s National League. All three competitions were won by Wexford Youths. However Shelbourne Ladies did win the WNL Cup after defeating UCD Waves 3–2 in the final at Richmond Park on 1 May 2016. In 2016 Shelbourne won the double with the FAI Women&#x27;s Cup success coming with the hammering of Wexford Youths 5–0 in the final at the Aviva Stadium. The most notable individual performance to come out of the game was undoubtedly that of &quot;Shels&quot;&#x27; Leanne Kiernan, who scored a hat-trick and picked up the &#x27;player of the match&#x27; award for her efforts.

The team won their first league championship when they finished the shortened 2016 season in first place. They qualified for the 2017–18 UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League with that title. In March 2019 Shelbourne announced a number of steps intended to boost &quot;equality and parity of esteem for all of our players.&quot; They dropped the word Ladies from the women&#x27;s team&#x27;s name and moved WNL home games from the AUL Complex to the main stadium at Tolka Park. The WNL team won the WNL and FAI Women&#x27;s Cup in 2022, and the cup again in 2024.

===U-19 team===
It was announced on 21 April 2011, by the Football Association of Ireland that there would be the formation of a League of Ireland U19 Division, thus giving young players in Ireland the prospect of ultimately breaking into the first teams of League of Ireland clubs.

===Schoolboys===
Shelbourne have seventeen schoolboy teams competing in the Dublin &amp; District Schoolboy Leagues. Schoolboy teams have participated in numerous Youth Cups worldwide including the Milk Cup and Umbro Galway Cup.They also have a new u13s League of Ireland SSE Airtricity schoolboy team.

Shelbourne are also involved in a football scholarship programme with Larkin Community College, on Dublin&#x27;s northside. This scheme is considered to have helped stop the falling enrolment rates, and early leaving of school, in part of Dublin&#x27;s north inner city.

===Amateur team===
Shelbourne also has an amateur team playing in the United Churches Football League, Division 1. However, the team started in the Amateur Football League Division 2. They won promotion to Division 1 in 2008 and earned a place in the Premier Division a year later following a playoff victory against Columba Rovers.
In 2013 they won the Premier Division with two games to spare.
In 2014 the team had silverware again. This time it was the Maher Cup after a 1-0 victory in the final.
2015 saw the team move away from the Amateur Football League to the United Churches Football League, where it remains to date.

===Reserve team===
The Shelbourne A team took part in the 2010 A Championship and finished sixth in Group 1. The team did not participate in the 2011 edition of the Championship, which was the last edition of the competition.

<text>Gezer, or Tel Gezer (), in – Tell Jezar or Tell el-Jezari is an archaeological site in the foothills of the Judaean Mountains at the border of the Shfela region roughly midway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. It is now an Israeli national park. In the Hebrew Bible, Gezer is associated with Joshua and Solomon.

The archaeological site of Tel Gezer rises to an elevation of above sea-level, and affords a commanding prospect of the plains to the west, north and east.

Gezer became a major fortified Canaanite city-state in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. It was later destroyed by fire and rebuilt. It is first mentioned in several ancient Egyptian inscriptions. Its importance was due in part to the strategic position it held at the crossroads of the ancient coastal trade route linking Egypt with Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, and the road to Jerusalem and Jericho, both important trade routes. In Roman and Byzantine times, the site was sparsely populated. Later, In the modern era, Tel Gezer was the site of the Palestinian village of Abu Shusheh, the residents of which fled or were expelled by Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

==Sources==
===Late Bronze===
====Egyptian Period====
18th Dynasty. Gezer is first mentioned as part of a list of cities taken by Thutmose III on the walls of the Precinct of Amun-Re, at Karnak. The Amarna letters mention kings of Gezer swearing loyalty to the Egyptian pharaoh.

19th Dynasty. Gezer is mentioned in the victory stele of Merneptah, dating from the end of the 13th century BCE, which states: &quot;Plundered is the Canaan with every evil; carried off is Ashkelon; seized upon is Gezer; Yanoam is made as that which does not exist; Israel is laid waste, his seed is not&quot;.

===Biblical conquest under Joshua===
In biblical times, Gezer, which lay on the outskirts of Jewish land, was incorporated at a later time. The biblical story of the Israelite conquest of Canaan under their leader Joshua mentions a certain &quot;king of Gezer&quot; () who had gone to help his countrymen in Lachish, where he met his death.
Gezer is listed in the Book of Joshua as one of the cities allotted to the tribe of Ephraim, as well as a Levitical city, one of ten allotted to the Levite children of Kehoth – the Kohathites (). Eusebius (4th century CE), describing the biblical Gezer of his day, writes:
Gazer . The lot of Ephraim, set aside for Levites. And Joshua besieged it, killing its king . Solomon also built here . It is now called Gazara, a village of Nikopolis (Emmaus), [which is a place located] 4 milestones from it in the north. The tribe of Ephraim did not expel the foreigners from it .

====The Egyptian sack of Gezer====
According to the Hebrew Bible, the only source for this particular event, the &quot;Sack of Gezer&quot; took place at the beginning of the 10th century BCE, when the city was conquered and burned by an unnamed Egyptian pharaoh, identified by some with Siamun, during his military campaign in Philistia. This anonymous Egyptian pharaoh then gave it to King Solomon as the dowry of his daughter. Solomon then rebuilt Gezer and fortified it.

The Bible states:
====Identifying the biblical pharaoh====

The only mention in the Bible of a pharaoh who might be Siamun (ruled 986–967 BCE) is the text from 1 Kings quoted above, and we have no other historical sources that clearly identify what really happened. As shown below, Kenneth Kitchen believes that Siamun conquered Gezer and gave it to Solomon. Others such as Paul S. Ash and Mark W. Chavalas disagree, and in 2001 Chavalas states that &quot;it is impossible to conclude which Egyptian monarch ruled concurrently with David and Solomon&quot;. Professor Edward Lipinski argues that Gezer, then unfortified, was destroyed late in the 10th century (and thus not contemporary with Solomon) and that the most likely Pharaoh was Shoshenq I (ruled 943–922 BCE). However, the archaeological evidence recovered at the site indicates that Gezer was previously destroyed in an earlier stratum, around the times of Siamun. 

Lindelle C. Webster&#x27;s excavation team concluded recently that correlation of Stratum IX, in Tel Gezer, with Solomon’s era and Siamun &quot;[is] improbable [as the end] of Tandy Stratum 10A is estimated by [radiocarbon] within the 11th century BCE, contemporary with the 21st Dynasty of Egypt but too early for Solomon by any estimate,&quot; and that correlation of Stratum 7 &quot;with Shishak/[Shoshenq I]&#x27;s [e]nd boundary, (927–885 BCE, 68.3% hpd), [included in] the biblical date for Shishak’s campaign [d]oes not fit well with current [radiocarbon]-based estimates for [Shoshenq I].&quot; They estimate Shoshenq I&#x27;s reign within the Stratum 8 destruction of Tel Gezer, which has been radiocarbon dated to the mid-10th century BCE (c. 969-940 BCE with 68.3% hpd, and 991-930 BCE with 95.4% hpd).

====Tanis temple relief====
One fragmentary but well-known surviving triumphal relief scene from the Temple of Amun at Tanis believed to be related to the sack of Gezer depicts an Egyptian pharaoh smiting his enemies with a mace. According to the Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen, this pharaoh is Siamun. The pharaoh appears here &quot;in typical pose brandishing a mace to strike down prisoners(?) now lost at the right except for two arms and hands, one of which grasps a remarkable double-bladed axe by its socket.&quot; The writer observes that this double-bladed axe or &#x27;halberd&#x27; has a flared crescent-shaped blade which is close in form to the Aegean-influenced double axe but is quite distinct from the Canaanite double-headed axe, which has a different shape that resembles an X. Thus, Kitchen concludes Siamun&#x27;s foes were the Philistines, who were descendants of the Aegean-based Sea Peoples and that Siamun was commemorating his recent victory over them at Gezer by depicting himself in a formal battle scene relief at the temple in Tanis. Alternatively, Paul S. Ash had put forward a detailed argument that Siamun&#x27;s relief portrays a fictitious battle. He points out that in Egyptian reliefs Philistines are never shown holding an axe, and that there is no archaeological evidence for Philistines using axes. He also argues that there is nothing in the relief to connect it with Philistia or the Levant.
==Location==
Gezer was located on the northern fringe of the Shephelah region, approximately northwest of Jerusalem. It was strategically situated at the junction of the Via Maris, the international coastal highway, and the highway connecting it with Jerusalem through the valley of Ayalon, or Ajalon. The nearest modern-Israeli settlement to the archaeological site is Karmei Yosef.

Verification of the identification of this site with biblical Gezer comes from a dozen bilingual inscriptions in either Hebrew or Aramaic, and Greek, found engraved on rocks several hundred meters from the tell. These inscriptions from the 1st century BCE read &quot;boundary of Gezer&quot; and &quot;of Alkios&quot; (probably the governor of Gezer at the time). The discovery of these boundary stones near the archaeological site makes it the first biblical city to be positively identified.

Today&#x27;s archaeological site spans an area of 130 dunams (32 acres), and contains 26 levels of settlement, from the Chalcolithic to the early Roman periods (3500 BCE to 100 CE). Most of the remains date from the Middle and Late Canaanite and the Israelite periods.

== History ==

===Chalcolithic===
The first settlement established at Tel Gezer dates to the end of the 4th millennium BCE during the Chalcolithic period, when large caves cut into the rock were used as dwellings.

===Early Bronze Age===
At the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (early 3rd millennium BCE), an unfortified settlement covered the tell. It was destroyed in the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE and subsequently abandoned for several centuries.

===Middle Bronze Age===
In the Middle Bronze Age IIB (MBIIB, first half of the 2nd millennium BCE), Gezer became a major city, well fortified and containing a large cultic site. It may have grown due to MBIIA-sites like Aphek becoming weaker.

:Fortifications
On the north side of the city, the fortifications consisted of at least two lines of defense surrounding the tell. Some excavators have noted as many as three defensive walls built in different periods: an outer earthen rampart, a central wall and an inner wall. In what remained of the outer rampart, it reached a height of about 5 metres, and was built of compacted alternating layers of chalk and earth covered with plaster. The inner wall measured 4 metres in width and was made of large stone blocks, reinforced with towers. The city gate stood near the southwest corner of the wall, was flanked by two towers which protected the wooden doors, a common design for its time.
The tell was surrounded by a massive stone wall and towers, protected by a earthen rampart covered with plaster. The wooden city gate, near the southwestern corner of the wall, was fortified by two towers.

:Cultic site with massebot
Cultic remains discovered in the northern part of the tell were a row of ten large standing pillars, known as or , singular , oriented north–south, the tallest of which was three meters high, with an altar-type structure in the middle, and a large, square, stone basin, probably used for cultic libations. The exact purpose of these megaliths is still debated, but they may have constituted a Canaanite &quot;high place&quot; from the Middle Bronze Age, ca. 1600 BCE, each &quot;masseba&quot; possibly representing a Canaanite city connected to Gezer by treaties enforced by rituals performed here. Both the number and size of the standing stones confer a unique character to this cultic site. Such &quot;massebot&quot; are found elsewhere in the country, but those from Gezer &quot;massebot&quot; are the most impressive examples.
The area was almost completely cleared by Macalister. The remains were re-excavated in 1968. A double cave beneath the high place was shown to be predating it and not connected to it.

===Late Bronze Age===

In the Late Bronze Age (second half of the 2nd millennium BCE) a new city wall, thick, was erected outside the earlier one. It is a very rare example of Late Bronze Age fortifications in the country, witness for the elevated political status of Gezer in southern Canaan during Egyptian rule.

====Thutmosid Period====
The Canaanite city was destroyed in a fire, presumably in the wake of a campaign by the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III (ruled 1479–1425 BCE). The oldest known historical reference to the city is to be found on an inscription of conquered sites at Thutmose&#x27;s temple at Karnak. A destruction layer from this event was found in all excavated areas of the tell.

====Amarna Period====
The Tell Amarna letters, dating from the 14th century BCE, include ten letters from the kings of Gezer swearing loyalty to the Egyptian pharaoh. The city-state of Gezer (named &quot;Gazru&quot; in Babylonian) was ruled by at least three leaders during the 20-year period covered by the Amarna letters. Discoveries of several pottery vessels, a cache of cylinder seals and a large scarab with the cartouche of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III attest to the existence of a city at Gezer&#x27;s location in the 14th century BCE—one that was apparently destroyed in the next century—and suggest that the city was inhabited by Canaanites with strong ties to Egypt.

In the 14th century BCE, a palace was constructed on the high western part of the tell, the city&#x27;s acropolis. Archaeologists also discovered remains of what might have been the Egyptian governor&#x27;s residence from the same period in the northern part of the tell.

====Ramesside Period====

In the late reign of Ramesses II, climate became drier and colder causing turmoil in the Mediterranean from around 1250 BCE, eventually leading to the Late Bronze collapse. The death of Ramesses II caused cities in Canaan to rebel to become independent. Merneptah of Egypt, who succeeded Ramesses II, had to regain control and boasted about his capture of Gezer. A massive fiery destruction seems to support this in excavations done by Prof. Steven Ortiz.

Toward the end of the Bronze Age, the city declined and its population diminished.

===Iron Age===
In 12th and 11th centuries BCE, a large building with many rooms and courtyards was situated on the acropolis. Grinding stones and grains of wheat found among the sherds indicate that it was a granary. Macalister describes the Iron Age construction of an olive press with collecting vats. Local and Philistine vessels attest to a mixed Canaanite/Philistine population.

The 10th century BCE seems to have been a period of notable urban development for the city until it became destroyed in the third quarter of that century, probably as a result of Shoshenq I&#x27;s campaign in Canaan at that time.
==== Israelite city gate, wall ====

On the southern slope about 200 meters east of the gate from the Middle Bronze Age IIB, there is what is now known as the &quot;Solomon Gate&quot;. This area was excavated at the beginning of the 20th century by Macalister, who defined the remains discovered there as a &quot;Maccabean citadel&quot; from the 2nd century BCE, because on one of the stones a curse against Simon was found engraved in Greek (Macalister 1912, vol. I: 209–23; 236–56).

After the discovery of identical gates from the time of King Solomon in Megiddo and Hazor, and following what is told in the Bible about the construction projects of this king in the three cities, Yigael Yadin proved in 1957 that in fact the Hasmonean citadel was no other than a gate from the days of Solomon. In the excavations of the 1960s, the entire gate was revealed. It is identical in plan and size to the other two mentioned and is connected by a casemate wall. On both sides of the passageway within the gate are four pairs of pillars and three pairs of cell-like chambers. In front of the entranceway stood two towers. At the gate, a construction of hewn-stone in the style typical of the days of Solomon is evident. The Solomon Gate has since been reinterpreted by some as dating from several centuries later, by virtue of the fact that the gate was rebuilt, although recent radiocarbon tests support an early date for the strata at the site.

====Tiglath-Pileser III and the Neo-Assyrian period====
The Neo-Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III put Gezer under siege between the years 734 and 732 BCE. The city was probably captured by the Assyrians at the end of the campaign of Tiglath-Pileser III to Canaan. At any rate, a fiery destruction so severe befell the city at this time, insofar that it reduced the upper two courses of stone in the inner casemate wall to powdery lime. A reference to Gezer&#x27;s destruction appears in a cuneiform relief from the 8th-century BCE royal palace of Tiglath-Pileser III at Nimrud. The city inscribed on the relief is called &#x27;Gazru&#x27;.

===Hellenistic period===
Stamped Rhodian amphora handles, a Tyrian lead weight of the Tanit series, and a &quot;didrachm&quot; of Ptolemy VI found &quot;in situ&quot; suggest a Hellenistic occupation from the end of the 3rd century BCE to 142 BCE. 

According to the book of 1 Maccabees, Simon Thassi captured Gazara and expelled the population during the Maccabean Revolt. He then brought in new settlers of devout Jews and fortified it, making it part of the Hasmonean kingdom. Gezer became known as Gazara in the Hellenistic period and became an important city for the Hasmonean rulers.

Notwithstanding Simon&#x27;s capture of Gezer in &quot;circa&quot; 142 BCE, Josephus alludes to the fact that Gezer returned under Seleucid control in the days of Antiochus VII Sidetes and during the high-priesthood of Simon&#x27;s son, John Hyrcanus.

Josephus, in both his &quot;Antiquities&quot; (12.7.4.; 13.6.7.; 13.9.2.) and in the &quot;Jewish War&quot; (1.2.2.), cites the &quot;Book of Maccabees&quot; as his primary source for these events and retains the Greek form of the name &quot;Gazara&quot; (), meaning, Gezer.

Elsewhere, Josephus (&quot;Jewish War&quot; 1.170) wrote that a certain &quot;Gadara&quot; () was one of the five &quot;synedria&quot;, or regional administrative capitals of the Hasmonean realm, established by Aulus Gabinius, the Roman proconsul of Syria, in 57 BCE. The name has been edited to &quot;Gazara&quot; in the Loeb edition (&quot;Jewish War&quot; 1.170). However, in this case, other researchers prefer one of two candidates from Transjordan, Gadara in Perea, or Gadara of the Decapolis (see more at Perea and Gadara (disambiguation)).

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
Gezer was sparsely populated during Roman times and later times, as other regional population centers took its place. Archaeological finds attesting to the Hellenistic and early Roman periods include two bath houses discovered &quot;in situ&quot;, as well as a number of ritual baths (mikveh) and rock tombs. The site continued to be occupied after the destruction of the Second Temple, but was gradually abandoned during the late Roman-early Byzantine period.

===Crusader period===

In 1177, the plains around Gezer were the site of the Battle of Montgisard, in which the Crusaders under Baldwin IV defeated the forces of Saladin. There was a Crusader Lordship of Montgisard and apparently a castle stood there, a short distance from Ramleh.

===Early modern and modern periods===
R.A. Stewart Macalister who excavated the ruin in the years 1902–1905 and 1907–1909 has noted that around the year 1869 the mound and other parts of the lands of the village of Abû Shûsheh were acquired by Messrs. Bergheim, who had been bankers in Jerusalem. Their acquisition of these lands would prove &quot;a fortunate circumstance&quot; for the excavator, as the site was later put at the disposal of the Palestine Exploration Fund.

==Archaeological highlights==
===Canaanite water system===
A large Canaanite (Bronze Age) water system comprising a tunnel going down to a spring, similar to those found in Jerusalem, Tel Hazor and Tel Megiddo, was first excavated by Macalister and was re-excavated as part of the 2006–2017 campaigns of the Tel Gezer Excavation and Publication Project.

In 2010 a team from the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary (&quot;NOBTS&quot;), in partnership with the Israeli Parks Authority and the Israeli Antiquities Authority, launched an effort to clear a massive water tunnel, discovered first by Macalister over a hundred years earlier. Macalister never fully excavated the tunnel because a strong storm blew debris back into the tunnel and he considered it too expensive and time consuming to re-excavate the site.

In 2011 professor Dennis Cole, archaeologist Dan Warner and engineer Jim Parker from NOBTS, and Tsvika Tsuk from the Israeli Parks Authority, led another team in an attempt to finish the effort. In just two years the teams removed approximately 299 tons of debris from the ancient water system.

In 2012, the team uncovered a large sealed cavern about nine meters beyond the water pool and &quot;Macalister&#x27;s Causeway.&quot;

In 2013, the team began an effort to preserve the ancient Canaanite mudbrick gate and complex near the water system.

In the Water System: &quot;Most of the first two weeks of the dig were spent searching for the bottom step and cleaning Macalister’s causeway. Tons of debris and rocks were removed in the process. When the bottom step was located and the causeway area clear, the team excavated three probes in the pool area. Each of the pool probes reached a depth of more than six feet before the end of the season and the bottom of the pool was discovered in only one probe (Eastern probe)—the one just below the bottom step of the water shaft.&quot;

The debris removal and excavation continued until the summer of 2017.

===Gezer calendar===
One of the best-known finds is the &quot;Gezer calendar&quot;. This is a plaque containing a text appearing to be either a schoolboy&#x27;s memory exercises, or a text designated for organising the collection of taxes from farmers. Another possibility is that the text was a popular folk song, or child&#x27;s song, listing the months of the year according to the agricultural seasons. It has proved to be of value by informing modern researchers of ancient Middle Eastern script and language, as well as the agricultural seasons.

===Boundary stones===
Thirteen boundary stones have been identified near the tell, distanced between less than 200 metres to almost 2 km from it, probably dating from the Late Hellenistic period (late 2nd – 1st century BCE), the most recent having been found by archaeologists from SWBTS in 2012. See also Location.

There are only a few &quot;lost&quot; biblical cities that have been positively identified through inscriptions discovered by means of archaeological work (surveys or digs). Gezer is the first among them, thanks to Clermont-Ganneau&#x27;s discovery of three such inscribed stones in 1874 and of a fourth in 1881.

Ten of the thirteen inscriptions are bilingual, including the first three ones, containing two distinct parts, one in Greek and one either Hebrew or Aramaic, and written in what is known as square Hebrew characters. Clermont-Ganneau&#x27;s reading of the Hebrew/Aramaic part as &quot;the boundary of Gezer&quot; was later confirmed. The inscriptions&#x27; Greek part contains personal names, either (H)alkios, Alexas, or Archelaos, for instance Clermont-Ganneau&#x27;s four stones were all bearing the inscription &quot;of Alkios&quot;. Sometimes the two parts are upside-down, or &quot;tête-bêche&quot;, in relation to each other, on the last discovered one the lines being separated by a line and the Hebrew/Aramaic inscription &gt; &quot;Teḥum Gezer&quot; (&quot;the boundary of Gezer&quot;) facing the tell. With the discovery of the last nine inscriptions it became evident that their distribution does not support Clermont-Ganneau&#x27;s initial interpretation, of them marking Gezer&#x27;s Sabbath limit, but rather that they probably mark the boundaries between private estates, or between city land and these estates. Analysis of the lettering have led to the conclusion that they were all contemporaneous, with opinions based on palaeography and history slightly diverging in regard to their date – either Hasmonean or Herodian. The earlier date and the Hebrew script can be connected to what is known from the First Book of Maccabees about Simon replacing the gentile inhabitants with Jewish ones () The later date can be supported by a scenario in which Herod, after acquiring the lands of the vanquished Hasmoneans, gave them to (H)alkios, Archelaos and Alexas, all three names mentioned by Josephus for members of a powerful land-owning family from Herod&#x27;s court.

====Language: Hebrew or Aramaic====
David M. Jacobson wrote that the inscriptions are in Hebrew and that this suggests a need for a closer look at their date.

Other scholars are not convinced that the language of the inscriptions is Hebrew and not Aramaic, leaving both options as possible as is the case in the Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaeae/Palaestinae.
===Egyptian-era remains===
In July 2017, archaeologists discovered skeletal remains of a family of three, one of the adults and a child wearing earrings, believed to have been killed during an Egyptian invasion in the 13th century BCE. A 13th-century BCE amulet, various scarabs and cylinder seals were also found on the site. The amulet bears the cartouches—or official royal monikers—of the Egyptian pharaohs Thutmose III and Ramses II.

==Archaeological excavation history==
Archaeological excavation at Gezer has been going on since the early 20th century, and it has become one of the most excavated sites in Israel. The site was identified with ancient Gezer by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau in 1871. R. A. Stewart Macalister excavated the site between 1902 and 1909 on behalf of the &quot;Palestine Exploration Fund&quot;. Twentyone quarterly dig reports were published in the Palestine Exploration Quarterly. Macalister recovered several artifacts and discovered several constructions and defenses. He also established Gezer&#x27;s habitation strata, though due to poor stratigraphical methods, these were later found to be mostly incorrect (as well as many of his theories). In 1914 and 1921 Raymond-Charles Weill dug there, focusing mainly on the Bronze and Iron Age Tombs. Results were not published due the Weill&#x27;s assistant Paule Zerlwer-Silberberg dying in a camp in occupied France and the excavation data was lost at that time. Surprisingly, the master thesis of that assistant, about the dig, was recently discovered and was published in 2012. Alan Rowe briefly visited the site in 1934. Between 1964 and 1974 G.E. Wright, William Dever and Joe Seger worked at Gezer on behalf of the Nelson Glueck School of Archaeology in the Hebrew Union College and Harvard University. Dever worked there again in 1984 and 1990, with the Andrews University.
===Latest excavations and surveys (2006–2017)===
Excavations were renewed in June 2006 by a consortium of institutions under the direction of Steve Ortiz of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) and Sam Wolff of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). The Tel Gezer Excavation and Publication Project is a multi-disciplinary field project investigating the Iron Age history of Gezer. The effort completed in 2017.

The first season of the Gezer excavations concluded successfully and revealed some interesting details. Among other things is a discovery of a thick destruction layer may be dated to the destruction at the hands of the Egyptians, which some associate with the biblical episode from : &quot;Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had attacked and captured Gezer, killing the Canaanite population and burning it down. He gave the city to his daughter as a wedding gift when she married Solomon.&quot;

In 2013, two separate archaeological survey-excavations were conducted at Tel Gezer, one by Tsvika Tsuk, Yohanan Hagai, and Daniel Warner, on behalf of the IAA, and the other led by a team of archaeologists from the SWBTS and Andrews University&#x27;s Institute of Archaeology.

<text>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation, is a non-departmental public body (NDPB), and is the largest UK public funder of non-medical bioscience. It predominantly funds scientific research institutes and university research departments in the UK.

==Purpose==
Receiving its funding through the science budget of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, BBSRC&#x27;s mission is to &quot;promote and support, by any means, high-quality basic, strategic and applied research and related postgraduate training relating to the understanding and exploitation of biological systems&quot;.

==Structure==
BBSRC&#x27;s head office is at Polaris House in Swindon - the same building as the other councils of UK Research and Innovation, AHRC EPSRC, ESRC, Innovate UK, MRC, NERC, Research England and STFC, as well as the UKSA. Funded by Government, BBSRC invested over £498 million in bioscience in 2017–18. BBSRC also manages the joint Research Councils&#x27; Office in Brussels – the UK Research Office (UKRO).

==History==
BBSRC was created in 1994, merging the former Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC) and taking over the biological science activities of the former Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).

Chairs
* Sir Alistair Grant (1994–1998)
* Dr Peter Doyle (1998–2003)
* Dr Peter Ringrose (2003–2009)
* Prof Sir Tom Blundell (2009–2015)
* Prof Sir Gordon Duff (2015–present)

Chief executives
* Prof (now Sir) Tom Blundell (1994–1996)
* Prof Ray Baker (1996–2002)
* Prof (now Dame) Julia Goodfellow (2002–2007)
* Prof Douglas Kell (2008–2013)
* Dr Jackie Hunter (from 21 October 2013)
* Prof Melanie Welham (2016–2018)

Executive chairs

* Prof Melanie Welham (2018–2023)
* Prof Guy Poppy (2023–2024)
* Prof Anne Ferguson-Smith (2024–) (from 1 July 2024)

==Governance and management==
BBSRC is managed by the BBSRC Council consisting of a chair (Professor Martin Humphries), an executive chair (Professor Guy Poppy) and from ten to eighteen representatives from UK universities, government and industry. The council approves policies, strategy, budgets and major funding.

A research panel provides expert advice which BBSRC Council draws upon in making decisions. The purpose of the research panel is to advise on:

* the development and implementation of the council&#x27;s strategic plans
* the competitiveness, relevance, economic impact, and societal considerations of the science and innovation activities funded by BBSRC
* opportunities for partnership with national and international organisations

===Boards, panels and committees===
In addition to the council and the research panel, BBSRC has a series of other internal bodies for specific purposes.

* Appointments Board
* Remuneration Board
* Strategy Advisory Panels – eight panels advise and report to the BBSRC Executive Chair
* Research Committees – five committees award research grants in specific science areas

==Institutes==
The council strategically funds eight research institutes in the UK, and a number of centres. 

They have strong links with business, industry and the wider community, and support policy development.

The institutes&#x27; research underpins key sectors of the UK economy such as agriculture, bioenergy, biotechnology, food and drink and pharmaceuticals. In addition, the institutes maintain unique research facilities of national importance.

* Babraham Institute (BI) (Cambridge)
* Earlham Institute (EI) (formerly The Genome Analysis Centre) (Norwich)
* The Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS), part of Aberystwyth University (Aberystwyth)
* John Innes Centre (JIC) (Norwich)
* The Pirbright Institute (Pirbright), formerly the Institute for Animal Health (IAH)
* Quadram Institute (Norwich), formerly the Institute of Food Research
* The Roslin Institute (RI) (Midlothian), part of the University of Edinburgh
* Rothamsted Research (Harpenden and North Wyke)

Other research institutes have merged with each other or with local universities. Previous BBSRC (or AFRC) sponsored institutes include:
* Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER – Aberystwyth), merged with the University of Aberystwyth 2008
* Letcombe Laboratory
* Long Ashton Research Station (LARS – Bristol)
* the Plant Breeding Institute (PBI – Cambridge)
* the Weed Research Organisation (WRO – Oxford)
* Silsoe Research Institute (SRI – Bedfordshire) was closed in 2006.

<doc id="830653" wikidata="Q7232403" url="?curid=830653" title="Portsdown Hill">
<text>Portsdown Hill is a long chalk ridge in Hampshire, England. The highest point of the hill lies within Fort Southwick at 131m above sea level. The ridge offers good views to the south over Portsmouth, the Solent, Hayling Island and Gosport, with the Isle of Wight beyond. The hill is on the mainland, just to the north of Ports Creek, which separates the mainland from Portsea Island, on which lies the main part of the city of Portsmouth, one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s main naval bases. To the north lies the Forest of Bere, with the South Downs visible in the distance. Butser Hill can be seen on a clear day. The hill is formed from an inlier of chalk which has been brought to the surface by an east–west upfold of the local strata known as the Portsdown Anticline.

Southwick House is close by the north side of the hill, the HQ for U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower during the D-Day invasions; the generals prayed together before D-Day at Christ Church Portsdown, on the hill, which has a memorial window. The A3(M) motorway cuts through the east side of the hill while the original A3 climbs over the centre by the George Inn pub and Christ Church. The nearest railway stations (from west to east) are Portchester, Cosham and Bedhampton. There are many stories about real and imagined tunnels in the hill. The area contains active military research establishments, including one of the core sites of Dstl (known as Dstl Portsdown West) and sites run by QinetiQ. Part of the hill has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Most of the southern flank of the ridge is designated as access land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and thereby freely available for the public to enjoy on foot.

During the early part of the English Civil War, Royalist forces from Portsmouth were involved in a number of skirmishes with Parliamentarians on the hill.
From 1716 until the hill was taken over for defence purposes in the 1860s, the hill was home to a fair on Easter Mondays.

==Portsdown Forts==

The forts on Portsdown Hill were built as a result of the 1859 Royal Commission, as part of a series of fortifications built to defend Portsmouth and its dockyard (five miles away) from a possible attack from &quot;inland&quot;, as the development of rifled gun barrels made it possible for an invading army to land elsewhere, circle around to the top of the hill and bombard the city from there, rendering the existing Hilsea Lines at the bottom of the ridge useless. A series of six forts were planned along the of the ridge. From west to east they are forts Fareham, Wallington, Nelson, Southwick, Widley and Purbrook. The line was finished off at the eastern end with Crookhorn Redoubt and Farlington Redoubt. The main threat was perceived to be from Napoleon III of France, but this receded soon after the forts&#x27; completion. Due to this they became known as &quot;Palmerston&#x27;s Folly&quot; but, though never needed for their original purpose, were useful anti-aircraft gun emplacements during World War II.

Fort Fareham is now a small industrial estate. The remains of the fort are Grade II listed.

Fort Wallington has been largely demolished to make way for an industrial estate. What remains is now a Grade II Listed Building.

Fort Nelson has been extensively restored as an artillery museum run by the Royal Armouries. It is a Grade I Listed Building, the highest level of designation.

Fort Southwick was for many years an Admiralty Research Establishment, sold in 2003 for housing. It is also now a Grade I Listed Building.

Fort Widley is owned by Portsmouth council, hosting a stable and various community rooms. Tours run on summer weekends. It is Grade II* Listed.

Fort Purbrook is open occasionally for craft fairs. It is also home to an activity centre which offers (but is not limited to) archery, rifle shooting and indoor rock-climbing. It is also Grade II* Listed. In October 2021, the fort was one of 142 sites across England to receive part of a £35-million injection into the government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund.

Guarding Fort Purbrook, the Crookhorn redoubt suffered from subsidence, and was demolished by 1876. The Farlington redoubt had only the ditches and gun positions dug, and was finally demolished in the 1970s. The tunnel between Crookhorn and Purbrook has been rediscovered.

Portsdown also gave its name to an army estate in Singapore. Long after the British army moved out in 1967, the Portsdown estate continues to thrive, with Portsdown Road the main road running through the middle.

==Portsdown SSSI==

Over fifty hectares of the south face of the hill are a Site of Special Scientific Interest owing to its chalk grassland habitat. Grazing ceased in the early 1950s, and consequently the site was gradually invaded by scrub, mostly hawthorn, dogwood, and wild privet. An intensive restoration programme funded by the Countryside Commission and Portsmouth City Council was initiated in 1995; large areas of scrub have now been cleared by machine, and flowers and grasses allowed to regenerate naturally. Scrub re-encroachment is controlled by cattle and horses which graze overwinter.

Several species of butterfly became extinct owing to the loss of habitat to scrub, notably the Adonis blue, silver-studded blue, dingy skipper, and dark green fritillary. Others such as the chalkhill blue and small blue were at the brink of extinction, but are now flourishing again. Indeed, the hill has now probably the largest metapopulation of the small blue in the UK.

==Portsdown Technology Park==
Portsdown Technology Park is located near Fort Southwick on Portsdown Hill. It is home to a number of defense companies including Qinetiq and BAE Systems. Within the park is a building featuring radar towers similar to a Type 45 destroyer, which are visible to a wide area of Hampshire. The site is the former home of the Admiralty Surface Weapons Establishment. DSTL has a smaller site situated to the west of Fort Southwick.

<text>Nogometno društvo Gorica, commonly referred to as ND Gorica or simply Gorica, is a Slovenian football club based in Nova Gorica that competes in the Slovenian Second League, the second tier of Slovenian football. They are one of the most successful Slovenian clubs with four Slovenian PrvaLiga and three Slovenian Cup titles. The club plays its home matches at the Nova Gorica Sports Park, which has a capacity of 3,100 seats.

==History==
===Yugoslav period (1947–1991)===
The history of football in the Goriška region goes back to 1907, when the first football club Jugoslavija was formed by the Slovenes of Gorizia.

October 1947 marks the beginning of the club with the foundation of FD Gorica in Šempeter pri Gorici, where it operated until 1963. They started in the second-level but quickly promoted to the Slovenian Republic League in 1950 under the new name Železničar Nova Gorica. Five years later they became republic champions and qualified for the Yugoslav Second League, which was club&#x27;s biggest achievement during the time of Yugoslavia. In 1963 the club merged with Branik Solkan and the club&#x27;s activity was transferred to Nova Gorica, where it remains ever since. They stabilised as a mid-table club in the 1960s, renamed as NK Vozila in 1971 and achieved better results only in the last years before Slovenia&#x27;s independence. Managed by Pavel Pinni, Vozila finished third in the 1988–89 season of the Slovenian Republic League.

===Slovenian independence (1991 to present)===
Following Slovenia&#x27;s independence in 1991, the club played in the 1. SNL under the name HIT Gorica and during the 1995–96 season, Gorica won the Slovenian championship for the first time. In the next season, the club played its first Slovenian Supercup final and won their second trophy with a 3–1 victory over Olimpija. During the league domination of Maribor, the club managed to win two Slovenian cup titles in a row (2000–01 and 2001–02).

On the last day of the 2003–04 season on 30 May 2004, Gorica won its second title after one of the most dramatic rounds in the Slovenian league history. Before the last round, Maribor was leading the table with 54 points, one point ahead of Gorica. In the final round, Maribor played an away match against their rivals Mura and Gorica played at home against Koper. Maribor lost the game 2–1 after a second-half comeback by Mura, meaning that Gorica, who eventually won against Koper 2–0, had secured their second title.

The second title started an impressive run for Gorica as the team won another two league titles in a row (2004–05 and 2005–06). After the last title, Gorica was a runner-up in the 2006–07 and 2008–09 seasons, while finishing third in 2007–08 and 2009–10.

In 2013, Gorica started cooperating with the Italian club Parma. On 21 May 2014 they won their first trophy after eight years as they defeated Maribor 2–0 in the cup final. After 28 seasons in the top division, Gorica was relegated for the first time in the 2018–19 season after losing the relegation play-offs against Tabor Sežana.
