<text>Naval Group is a major French industrial group specializing in naval defense design, development and construction. Its headquarters are located in Paris.

Heir to the French naval dockyards initiated in 1631 by Cardinal Richelieu and to the Direction des Constructions et Armes Navales (&quot;DCAN&quot;), which became Direction des Constructions Navales (&quot;DCN&quot;) in 1991 and then DCNS in 2007, the company was rebranded &quot;Naval Group&quot; in 2017. Its two main shareholders are the French State (62.25%) and Thales Group (35%).

Naval Group employs 14,182 people across 18 countries.

==History==

Naval Group has a heritage of almost 400 years. Major shipyards were built in France in Brest (1631), Nantes-Indret (1771), Lorient (1778) and, subsequently, Cherbourg (1813). Others were to follow. As early as 1926, what we know as the Naval Group today already had all the facilities now owned by the group in mainland France.

===The birth of the naval dockyards===
In 1624, Cardinal Richelieu, who was King Louis XIII of France&#x27;s Prime Minister, devised a policy meant to expand France&#x27;s maritime capabilities. This policy was put into practice from 1631, with the creation of the Ponant fleet in the Atlantic and the Levant fleet in the Mediterranean, the foundation of the Brest dockyards as well as the extension of the Toulon dockyards built under King Henri IV.

The policy was continued by Colbert, Louis XIV&#x27;s Navy Minister, who developed several major dockyards. He extended the dockyards in Toulon, ordered the excavation of the docks in Brest and founded the Rochefort dockyards. His son, Seignelay, who succeeded him in 1683, followed in his footsteps.

The French Royal Navy&#x27;s network of dockyards was further strengthened in the 18th century. In 1750, the Marquis de Montalembert converted a former paper mill into a forge producing cannons at Ruelle-sur-Touvre. In 1777, Antoine de Sartine, Louis XVI&#x27;s Navy Minister, opened a cannon foundry near the naval shipyards in Indret. In the same year, work started on the development of the port in Cherbourg, which was completed in 1813. In 1778, the Lorient naval dockyards succeeded &quot;La Compagnie des Indes du port de L’Orient&quot;.

The naval dockyards in Rochefort were closed in 1926. In 1937, the establishment in Saint-Tropez was opened on the former site of the company Schneider, which specialised in torpedoes. By this time, most of the Naval Group&#x27;s French sites already existed, and they have not changed since then.

===Industrialisation and technical innovations===

During the 19th century, the naval dockyards underwent a transformation as the fleet of sailing ships and were replaced by motorised vessels. The sites were industrialised and gradually specialised. In 1865, the naval dockyards in Brest became exclusively military, with the closure of the Penfeld port to commercial vessels. In 1898, after specialising in the building of vessels with propellers rather than sails, the shipyards in Cherbourg were tasked exclusively with the construction of submarines. Finally, in 1927, a decree definitively laid out the missions of the various naval dockyards: Brest and Lorient were tasked with the construction of large vessels, Cherbourg with building submarines, while Toulon, Bizerte and Saigon took charge of the maintenance of the fleet.

This rationalisation of the roles of the naval dockyards was accompanied by technical and military innovations and the production of vessels at a higher pace, against the backdrop of an arms race and colonisation. In 1858, , the first ocean-going battleship in the world sailed out of the dockyards in Toulon. The 1860s saw the arrival of the first torpedo boats and military submarines, with the launch of in 1863. The technical problems experienced by this first-ever motorised submarine meant that it remained a prototype rather than an operational war vessel. But it did open the way for the construction of in 1886 and &quot;Le Narval&quot; in 1899, which were the first operational torpedo submarines in history.

The production of heavy surface vessels was also stepped up in the 1910s. Several battleships were built before the start of the First World War, and the fleet was strengthened by the 35,000-ton in 1939.

===Reorganisation of activities===
In 1946, a review of the French naval dockyards completed the attributions of the various sites announced in the 1927 decree. Brest was tasked with the production and repair of large vessels, Lorient with the construction of medium-sized vessels, Cherbourg with submarines and Toulon with repairing and maintaining the fleet. Amongst the inland sites, Indret took over the vessel propulsion activities, Ruelle the construction of guns, large parts and electronics, Saint-Tropez the production of torpedoes and Guérigny the construction of naval chains and anchors. Five sites are located overseas: Mers el-Kébir, Bizerte, Dakar, Diego-Suarez and Papeete.

Until 1961, the French navy maintained and repaired its fleet itself, through the &quot;Directions des Constructions et Armes Navales&quot; (DCAN) in the naval dockyards. The engineers working in the DCANs were officers in the French navy&#x27;s engineering division. At this time, the dockyards broke away from the Navy, creating the opportunity for the diversification of their activities in the 1970s.

A single DCAN covered all the mainland and overseas naval dockyards, reporting to the &quot;Direction Technique des Constructions Navales&quot; (DTCN). In turn, the DTCN was answerable to the &quot;Délégation Ministérielle pour l’Armement&quot; (DMA), set up by Michel Debré. In 1977, the DMA became the &quot;Délégation Générale de l’Armement&quot; (DGA). The purpose of this reform was to centralise all the armed forces&#x27; design and construction capacities in a single inter-armed forces delegation operating under the government&#x27;s authority.

In 1958, the official launch by General de Gaulle of the French military nuclear programme and deterrent policy prompted the restructuring of the defence industry and defence technology.

The Cœlacanthe project brought together the DTCN and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, and in 1971, , the first French missile-launching nuclear submarine, came into service.

===Transformation into a company===
The international economic climate and decolonisation in the 1970s lead the DCAN to venture into new markets. The loss of the overseas naval dockyards was compounded by the French Navy&#x27;s reduced need for vessels and the increased difficulty in obtaining funding. This trend gathered more pace after the end of the Cold War, despite the diversification of the DCAN activities, which now included maintaining the electric power network and clearing mines from the coastline. Some sites also specialised in civilian projects: Brest built trucks, Guérigny made agricultural machinery and Toulon produced civilian vessels (yachts, liners).

But, looking beyond the order books, it was the public status of the DCAN that was gradually called into question, and it came to be considered as an administrative obstacle to the development of the potential of France&#x27;s naval dockyards.

This transformation occurred in several stages. In 1991, the DCAN was christened the DCN (Direction des Construction Navales). In the same year, DCN International was created. The mission of this PLC was to promote the activities of the DCN on an international scale and to facilitate the export of its products.

In 1992, the DCN&#x27;s activities for the state were attached to the Naval Programmes department (SPN), which was the contracting authority for vessels for the French navy. Since then, the DCN has only been responsible for industrial activities, while remaining part of the DGA. This change of status has allowed DCN International to provide the DCN with commercial and legal support in the development of its international trade since the end of the 1990s.

The development strategy pursued by DCN International resulted in the signing of several major contracts. In 1994, three submarines were delivered to Pakistan, and, in 1997, two s were built for Chile. A contract was also won in 2000 to supply six s to Singapore. In 2007, a contract was signed with Malaysia for two Scorpène submarines, through the subsidiary Armaris.

The DCN has also won contracts in the field of off-shore drilling for oil. In 1997, the Brest site modernised the Sedco 707 platform and now builds SFX type oil rigs.

In 1999, the DCN became an agency with national authority (SCN), reporting directly to the Ministry of Defence. Finally, in 2001, the French government decided to transform the DCN into a fully state-owned private limited company. The change of status came into effect in 2003. The DCN became just DCN, which no longer stood for &quot;Direction des Constructions Navales&quot;.

===The development and continuation of the DCNS group===

In 2007, DCN acquired the French naval activities branch of Thales, Armaris, a former subsidiary that was equally shared between DCN and Thales, and MOPA2, the company in charge of the project to build a second aircraft carrier. To stress its new identity, the resulting group was named DCNS. Thales acquired a 25% stake in the group&#x27;s capital. In 2011, Thales increased its share of DCNS&#x27; capital to 35%.

Construction of the stealthy multi-function frigates (FREMM) started in 2007. In 2008, an aerial drone landed on the deck of a frigate at sea for the first time in history. In 2013, the group set up DCNS Research to promote its research activities. DCNS India, today Naval Group India was founded in 2008, thanks to two contracts signed in 2005 and 2008 for the delivery of six conventional Scorpène-class submarines. Similarly, in 2013, a submarine construction site was opened in Brazil. The group created the DCNS University in 2013 to deliver internal and external training.

On 28 June 2017, DCNS changed its name to Naval Group.

==Activities==
Naval Group&#x27;s activities can be broken down into two main sectors: naval defence, the group&#x27;s historical core business (ships, submarines, operational readiness management of the forces). In 2021, Naval Group stops its activities in the area of maritime renewable energy.

===Naval defence===
Naval Group designs, develops and manages the operational readiness of surface and underwater naval systems, and their associated systems and infrastructures. As a project manager and integrator of armed vessels, Naval Group intervenes all along the value chain, from strategic programme planning, to design, construction and the management of operational readiness.

The group works with the French navy and other navies, for conventional products, and with the authorisation of the French government. It also offers its military expertise to the French Air Force to design automated navigation and combat systems, and to renovate aircraft.

====Surface naval systems====

* Aircraft carriers: 
* Helicopter carriers: LHD
* Multi-mission frigates: FREMM-class frigates &amp; Frégate de défense et d&#x27;intervention-class frigates (planned); La Fayette-class frigate
* Multi-mission frigates: Design of Second Generation Patrol Vessel for the Royal Malaysian Navy, based on the 
* Air defence frigates: s
* Medium-tonnage vessels: s 
* Construction of aerial drones for the navy

====Submarines and underwater weapons====
* Conventional submarines: , and 
* Nuclear submarines: ballistic missile nuclear submarines and 
* Nuclear submarines: nuclear attack submarines and Barracuda class
* Hybrid concepts: the company&#x27;s &quot;Sous-Marin Experimental&quot; (SMX) series explores advanced concepts for submarine warfare. One in the series—the SMX-25—was designed to arrive in theatre rapidly through high surface speed and then operate as normal underwater.
* Suffren class: Nuclear submarines: nuclear attack submarines Rubis class and Barracuda class : Barracuda (class Suffren)
* F21 heavy-weight torpedoes
* MU90 light-weight torpedoes

===Energy and marine infrastructures===
The group collaborates with EDF, the CEA and AREVA in the construction of EPR power plants and the maintenance of nuclear power plants. Naval Group also builds thermal electric power plants and naval bases. The group designed the electric power plants in Mayotte, La Réunion and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. Since 2008, they have been studying a concept of a small nuclear power plant (50 to 250 MWe) named Flexblue. The project was put on hold in 2014.

Naval Group was investing in four renewable marine technologies: wave energy, marine current turbines, ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), and floating wind turbines. Naval created Naval Energies in 2017. Since it gained control of the Irish company OpenHydro in 2013, Naval Group has been able to progress from the research and development phase to industrial production. In 2021, Naval Group stopped the Naval Energies activities.

==Corporate responsibility==
Naval Group operates several programmes to promote training and professional integration. The group has signed the &quot;Pacte PME&quot;, which fosters relations between large companies and smaller enterprises and sets up partnerships with leading universities and academic institutions. Between 2006 and 2013, DCNS organised the &quot;Trophée Poséidon&quot; for students in engineering schools, which rewarded student projects in the fields of innovation and the maritime environment.

Between 2008 and 2014, Naval Group also ran a professional integration programme for both persons with technical qualifications and persons without any qualifications, called the &quot;Filières du Talent&quot;. In 2010, this programme was rewarded by the &quot;Trophée national 2010 de l’entreprise citoyenne&quot;.

DCNS has also been involved in the world of yachting for many years by sharing its technologies and through its sponsoring and mentoring activities. The group is a partner of the &quot;Grand-Prix de l&#x27;École Navale&quot;, a regatta that has been held near the Crozon peninsula since 2001. It has also been a partner of the &quot;Pôle France Voile&quot; in Brest since 2007, and works for the professional integration of former sportsmen and sportswomen.

In 2008, DCNS built the single-hull DCNS 1000, a yacht designed for round-the-world races, which featured in the 2013 film &quot;En Solitaire&quot;, by Christophe Offenstein, starring François Cluzet.

Today, Naval Group also shared its technical expertise in composites for hulls and in navigation systems by building the experimental trimaran &quot;L&#x27;Hydroptère&quot;, and it partnered with the Areva Challenge team that took part in the Americas Cup in 2007. 
The Naval Group industrial site in Toulon has been a partner of Toulon rugby club since 2005.

==Organisation==
Naval Group is a private limited company in which the French state holds a 62.49% stake. The Thales groups holds 35% of the capital, and the remaining 2.51% is made up of company &amp; employee shares. At the end of 2016, Naval Group employed 12,771 people, more than half of whom are private sector workers, while the other half are public sector workers. The group is present in 18 countries and has entered several partnerships outside France through its subsidiaries and joint ventures.

== Controversies ==

The DCN / DCNS plays a major role in &quot;one of France&#x27;s biggest political and financial scandals of the last generation [that left] a trail of eight unexplained deaths, nearly half a billion dollars in missing cash and troubling allegations of government complicity&quot; connected to a sale of warships to Taiwan in the 1990s.

Apart from the issues surrounding the sale of ships to Taiwan mentioned above, French prosecutors started investigating a wide range of corruption charges in 2010 involving different submarine sales, with possible bribery and kickbacks to top officials in France. In particular interest by the prosecutors are sales of Scorpène-class submarines to countries like India and Malaysia. The investigation in Malaysia has been prompted by human rights group Suaram as it involved Prime Minister Najib Razak when he was defence minister and his friend Abdul Razak Baginda whose company Primekar was alleged to be paid a huge commission during the purchase of two Scorpène submarines. French investigators are interested in the fact that Primekar was formed only a few months before the contract was signed with the Malaysian government and DCNS and that Primekar had no track record in servicing submarines and did not have the financial capability to support the contract. Investigations have also revealed that a Hong Kong-based company called Terasasi Ltd in which the directors are Razak Baginda and his father, sold classified Malaysian navy defence documents to DCNS. Also under scrutiny are allegations of extortion and the murder of Shaariibuugiin Altantuyaa, a translator who worked on the deal.

On 15 December 2015, French courts indicted Bernard Baiocco, former president of Thales International Asia for paying kickbacks to Abdul Razak Baginda. At the same time director of shipbuilder DCN International was indicted for misuse of corporate assets.

On 24 August 2016, it was reported by the newspaper &quot;The Australian&quot; that a 22,000-page report leak has taken place regarding the unrelated Scorpène-class submarine currently being built by India as a part of a 3.5 billion dollar deal. The suspected leak of sensitive information for the Scorpène was claimed to contain information regarding stealth, sensors, the noise level of the submarine at different sea depths, acoustic information and more. The Indian Navy passed the blame for the data leak onto unnamed overseas sources, possibly from the hacking of sensitive data. Naval Group filed a complaint against the newspaper with the Supreme Court of the State of New South Wales in Australia for having illegally published documents containing old technical information about the Scorpene. The Australian court ruled in favour of Naval Group on 29 August and confirmed its decision on 1 September.

<text>Lee University is a private Christian university in Cleveland, Tennessee. It was founded in 1918 as the Church of God Bible Training School with twelve students and one teacher, Nora I. Chambers. The school grew to become Lee College, with a Bible college and junior college on its current site, in 1948. Twenty years later, Lee received accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools as a four-year liberal arts college. In 1997, Lee became a university; it now offers master&#x27;s degrees as well as undergraduate degrees.

==History==
=== Bible training school ===
Lee University’s current campus originally housed a Methodist institution, Centenary College and Music School, as early as 1885. Part of the original Centenary facility remains on campus today as part of Lee’s administrative building.

In 1911, at its sixth annual General Assembly, the Church of God appointed a committee to establish plans for a Bible training school. Six years later, on January 1, 1918, the school’s first term began with a tuition of $1 per week. Classes met in the council chamber of the Church of God Publishing House in Cleveland. Rev. A. J. Tomlinson served as the first superintendent of education. The only teacher, Nora Chambers, had twelve students.
In 1920, the school expanded to the old sanctuary of the North Cleveland Church of God on People street and included a dormitory. In 1925, it moved to a larger facility on Montgomery Avenue: the Church of God Auditorium. In 1930, the institution added a high school, school of business, and school of music. The school constructed its first building, a women&#x27;s dormitory, in 1937, but the following year the school moved to a 63-acre campus in Sevierville, Tennessee, when it purchased the Murphy Collegiate Institute for $29,990. Intramural athletic teams began in the 1940s. In 1941, the school added a two-year junior-college to focus on teacher training and business education. The &quot;Vindagua&quot; yearbook began in 1942 and the &quot;Clarion&quot; student newspaper was first published in 1946.

=== Becoming Lee College ===

In 1947, Bob Jones College moved from Cleveland to Greenville, South Carolina. The Bible training school purchased the 20-acre campus for $1.5 million and the institution returned to Cleveland under a new name, Lee College, to honor its second president, Rev. F.J. Lee. After the move, the junior college received accreditation from the University of Tennessee. In 1958, Lee gained its first varsity sports team: men&#x27;s basketball.

In 1960, the junior-college was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The school adopted the Vikings mascot in 1961. Greek letter clubs began the following year. The annual Parade of Favorites pageant began in 1963. The first Lee Day was held in 1964. In 1965, Lee’s high school program closed and the school opened a science building. The following year Lee desegregated, reached an enrollment of 1,000, and started the shift to a four-year institution. The 1,800-seat Conn Center auditorium was constructed in 1977. In 1982, the college mascot became the Flames. The sports arena and library were built in 1983 and 1984 respectively.

=== The Conn administration ===
Dr. Charles Paul Conn became president in 1986. He became the longest-serving president of any college or university in Tennessee history. During his tenure Lee’s enrollment quadrupled from around 1,000 to more than 5,100. In 1988, Lee closed Church Street on campus to create the Sharp Pedestrian Mall.

In the 1990s, Lee built a theatre, recreation center, music building, and college of education. In November 1993, the Ellis Hall dormitory was destroyed by arson in the middle of the night. All 73 students were evacuated. The Voices of Lee choir debuted in fall 1994. The next year Lee launched its first graduate program, church music. During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Lee housed more than 300 athletes and coaches participating in the games. In fall 1997, Lee became a university. The following year Lee established its Global Perspectives program, requiring all undergraduates to study abroad.

The 2000s brought a new student center, three-story humanities center, and school of religion building. In 2007, Lee launched its Encore program for students over 60 and purchased the former campus of Mayfield Elementary School. In 2010, Lee purchased the downtown campus of Cleveland&#x27;s First Baptist Church for $5 million to house a performance venue, Pangle Hall, and the School of Business. A chapel and communications building were completed in the early 2010s. In 2013, a Lee University choir sang at the second inauguration of U.S. President Barack Obama. Lee began a School of Nursing in 2014 and finished a building for the department two years later. The university filed an amicus brief in favor of employment discrimination against LGBT people in the court case &quot;Bostock v. Clayton County&quot; in 2019.

<doc id="807921" wikidata="Q327138" url="?curid=807921" title="Skitch Henderson">
<text>Lyle Russel &quot;Skitch&quot; Henderson (January 27, 1918 – November 1, 2005) was an American pianist, conductor, and composer. His nickname &quot;Skitch&quot; came from his ability to &quot;re-sketch&quot; a song in a different key. Bing Crosby suggested that he should use the name professionally.

==Early years==
As his career developed, Henderson often claimed to have been born in Birmingham, England, also adding &quot;Cedric&quot; to his name. However, he was born in the town of Halstad in northwest Minnesota in 1918 to Joseph and Josephine (Scheie) Henderson, both of Norwegian descent. After his mother died when he was two in 1920, he was raised in Halstad by his aunt Hattie Henderson Gift and uncle Frank Gift. His aunt taught him piano, starting at the age of four. Although he did not receive formal conservatory education in music, Henderson received classical training under Fritz Reiner, Albert Coates, Arnold Schoenberg, Ernst Toch and Arturo Toscanini, who invited him to conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Henderson would later recount learning the ropes by playing in taverns with popular singers of the day.

==Film==
After starting his professional career in the 1930s playing piano in the roadhouses of the American Midwest, Henderson&#x27;s major break came when he was an accompanist on a 1937 MGM promotional tour featuring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. Henderson later said that as a member of MGM&#x27;s music department, he worked with Garland to learn &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; during rehearsals for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and played piano for her first public performance of the song at a local nightclub before the film was finished. However this account is at odds with the memoirs of the tune&#x27;s composer, Harold Arlen, who said he first performed the song for the 17-year-old Garland.

==Radio==
&quot;Blue Network Varieties&quot;, which began May 20, 1940, on NBC&#x27;s Pacific Coast Blue Network, featured Henderson in charge of the music, leading &quot;a novelty instrumental group.&quot;

After the war, Henderson worked for NBC Radio Network, where he was the musical director for Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Light-Up Time&quot;. He was also accompanist on &quot;Philco Radio Time&quot; with Bing Crosby on the new ABC network. Henderson also played on Bob Hope&#x27;s &quot;Pepsodent Show&quot;.

In 1946, Henderson and the Golden Gate Quartet headlined a 13-week summer replacement program on NBC, sponsored by Old Gold cigarettes.

In 1950, Henderson had a disc jockey program on WNBC in New York City.

Henderson also recorded transcriptions for the Capitol Transcriptions service.

== Recordings ==
In 1946, Henderson formed his own orchestra and signed a contract with Capitol Records. Among his earliest releases for Capitol was a 3-disc set titled &quot;Keyboard Sketches.&quot; His recording career spanned the period from 78s to CDs. Two albums as pianist for Arbors Records were released in the early 21st century, &quot;Swinging With Strings&quot; (2001) and &quot;Legends,&quot; with Bucky Pizzarelli (2003). Henderson also served as conductor of The New York Pops with Maureen McGovern on &quot;With a Song in My Heart: The Great Songs of Richard Rodgers&quot; for Reader&#x27;s Digest and Centaur Records.

Henderson conducted a 1963 recording for RCA Victor of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; with Leontyne Price and William Warfield, which won a Grammy.

== Television ==

In his career at NBC, Henderson was conductor of the orchestras for &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;Tonight Starring Steve Allen&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Henderson began his NBC work in 1951 and left in 1957 when Allen was replaced by Jack Paar, then returned when Carson took over and led the orchestra from 1962-1966 during Carson&#x27;s early years as host and was replaced by Milton Delugg, who was succeeded by trumpeter Doc Severinsen who led the NBC Orchestra until Carson&#x27;s retirement in 1992.

== Conducting career ==
In 1983, Henderson founded The New York Pops orchestra, which makes its home at Carnegie Hall in New York City. He served as the music director and conductor of the orchestra until his death in 2005. Henderson also conducted numerous symphonic orchestras throughout the world.

His radio work included:
* &quot;California Melodies&quot; debuted 1940, Mutual, KHJ (AM)
* &quot;Songs by Sinatra&quot; 1946
* &quot;I Deal in Crime&quot; 1946, ABC
* &quot;Philco Radio Time&quot; starring Bing Crosby 1946, ABC
* &quot;Best of All&quot; 1954, NBC
* &quot;United States Air Force Presents&quot; 1969
* &quot;Skitch Henderson with the Music Makers&quot;

== Television programs ==
* &quot;Match Game&quot;, 1962–1963
* &quot;Password&quot;, 5 episodes, 1967
* &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot;, co-host, 1951–1952
* &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, Mystery Guest, 1973

== Filmography ==
* &quot;Act One&quot; (1963)
* &quot;Who Says I Can&#x27;t Ride a Rainbow!&quot; (1971)

He also wrote &quot;Baby Made a Change in Me&quot; for the 1948 movie &quot;On Our Merry Way&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1997, Henderson was honored for the vital role he played in the cultural life of New York City by being awarded the Handel Medallion, presented by the City of New York, New York.

On January 29, 2005, Henderson was awarded the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s highest honor, the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal. An exhibit highlighting the musician&#x27;s career and showcasing the medal, &quot;Skitch Henderson: A Man and His Music,&quot; was on display at the Smithsonian from January 30, 2005, to March 13, 2005.

Henderson was the recipient of three honorary degrees – from St. Thomas Aquinas College, the University of South Florida, and Western Connecticut State University.

== Miscellaneous ==
The Retro Swing Band at the University of Wisconsin plays arrangements from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and the BBC Dance Orchestra included in the Skitch Henderson Collection at the Mills Music Library.

Henderson was known for his unique laugh on the Carson show. In addition to Ed McMahon&#x27;s famously hearty laugh, Henderson could also occasionally be heard laughing his distinctive &quot;Hoo-hoo-hoo!&quot;

== Personal life ==

Henderson married movie actress and television personality Faye Emerson in 1950. They were divorced seven years later. 

In 1958, he then married Ruth Einsiedel and raised two children, Hans and Heidi. Hans was married to Sandra Watson for 18 years, before divorcing in 2000. Heidi was married to actor William Hurt from 1989 to 1992, and they have two sons. 

From 1972 until his death, Ruth and Skitch Henderson owned and operated The Silo, a store, art gallery, and cooking school in New Milford, Connecticut. In 2003, Ruth and Skitch Henderson co-founded the Hunt Hill Farm Trust, an effort to preserve their farm&#x27;s land and buildings and to celebrate Americana in music, art and literature through the creation of a living museum.

Henderson died of natural causes on November 1, 2005, at age 87.

== Legal problems ==
Henderson was indicted on July 2, 1974, on charges of tax evasion for the years 1969 and 1970, concerning claims about the value (allegedly $350,000) of a music library he donated to the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He further claimed he had consulted with Leonard Bernstein and Henry Mancini about the value of his collection, both of whom denied this in testimony at trial. A signature on an acceptance letter from the library director was also deemed a forgery. Henderson was convicted on two counts of filing false tax returns. He was acquitted on the tax evasion charges and obstructing a tax audit.

Henderson was sentenced on January 17, 1975, to six months in prison, and was fined (). He began serving his sentence at a minimum-security Federal prison on April 9, 1975, and was released after four months, on August 4, 1975.

<text>William Weber Coblentz (November 20, 1873 – September 15, 1962) was an American physicist notable for his contributions to infrared radiometry and spectroscopy.

==Early life, education, and employment==
William Coblentz was born in North Lima, Ohio to parents of German and Swiss descent. His mother (Catherine) died when Coblentz was just under three, leaving him temporarily with a family of just his younger brother (Oscar) and their father (David). However, the father remarried about 2 years later, and Coblentz appears to have admired his second mother (Amelia). Throughout Coblentz&#x27;s childhood and adolescence, his family lived on farms, but apparently were never able to buy one of their own. The family&#x27;s extremely modest circumstances led to a somewhat-delayed education for Coblentz, who did not finish high school (Youngstown, Ohio) until 1896, when he was 22 years old.

Coblentz entered the Case School of Applied Science, now Case Western Reserve University in the fall of 1896, and received his Bachelor of Science degree in physics in June, 1900. He went on to earn MS (1901) and PhD (1903) degrees from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, staying two years beyond his doctoral time by working as a Research Fellow with support from the Carnegie Institution. In the spring of 1905, Coblentz accepted a position with the newly founded National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST) in Washington, DC, where he spent his entire career. In 1905 he founded the Bureau&#x27;s radiometry section, and headed it for 40 years until his retirement in 1945.

==Scientific work==

During the course of a long and productive career, Coblentz made many scientific contributions both of a pure and applied nature. Bibliographies of his work show that he had hundreds of scientific publications, talks, and abstracts to his credit. He received a total of ten patents during his lifetime, the first being US Patent 1,077,219 for a solar cell invention to convert sunlight to electricity.

Coblentz&#x27;s first publication, &quot;Some Optical Properties of Iodine&quot;, was based on his PhD research. On acquiring his doctorate, he soon began publishing regularly on problems related to infrared (IR) radiation, both those concerning spectroscopy and those concerning radiometry. For example, Coblentz was among the first, if not the very first, to verify Planck&#x27;s Law.

===Infrared studies===

When Coblentz entered Cornell University, infrared spectroscopy was in what today would be considered an extremely primitive state. As a young Cornell researcher, Coblentz assembled and calibrated his own IR equipment, and extended the range of IR measurements to longer wavelengths than had ever been reached. By 1905 he had acquired hundreds of spectra by tedious point-by-point measurements with a prism instrument of his own construction. These were published in 1905 with large fold-outs charts (not available in the later reprints), and tables of wavelengths at which various materials absorbed IR light. While such a massive spectral compilation itself was something of a &quot;tour de force&quot;, it is perhaps not the most important part of Coblentz&#x27;s 1905 book. Instead, that honor probably goes to his generalization that certain molecular groupings, or functional groups in modern parlance, appeared to absorb specific and characteristic IR wavelengths. In time this would allow scientists to use a molecule&#x27;s IR spectrum as a type of molecular fingerprint. This generalization had been hinted at in earlier work by others, but not with such a large amount of supporting data as Coblentz presented. Today, IR spectra are used in thousands of laboratories around the globe by scientists in many fields.

As an aside, Coblentz&#x27;s early work on molecular spectra was not given the eager reception that hindsight might suggest. The reasons are numerous and have been explored by several authors.

===Astronomical studies===

Coblentz had a long interest in astronomical problems. In 1913, he developed thermopile detectors and used them at Lick Observatory to measure IR radiation from 110 stars, and the planets Mars, Venus, and Jupiter. In this work he was assisted by Seth Nicholson, later of the Mt. Wilson Observatory. Extending this work, Coblentz and Carl Lampland, of the Lowell Observatory, measured large differences between the day and night temperatures on Mars, which implied a thin Martian atmosphere.

For his applications of IR detectors to astronomy, Coblentz is regarded as the founder of astronomical infrared spectroscopy. In recognition of his astronomical contributions, craters on the moon and Mars were named after him by the International Astronomical Union.

Coblentz also made observations of solar eclipses, and published papers describing his work.

===Other research===

An inspection of Coblentz&#x27;s bibliography shows that from about 1930 his research turned more toward measurements involving the ultraviolet (UV) region and away from infrared work. Much of this research had a distinctly bio-medical slant, such as his investigations of ultraviolet therapy (1938) and the production of skin cancer by UV exposure (1948).

Although Coblentz is remembered today mainly for his contributions to physics and astronomy, he also had interests in bioluminescence, atmospheric ozone, and, perhaps surprisingly, parapsychology. He appears to have brought the same energy to the latter field as he did to his other areas of interest.

==Honors==
Coblentz was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1930.

Among the awards Coblentz received were the 1911 Howard N. Potts Medal from the Franklin Institute, the 1920 Janssen Medal from the French Academy of Sciences, and the 1937 Rumford Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1945, shortly after retiring, Coblentz received the Frederic Ives Medal from the Optical Society of America.

The Coblentz Society, dedicated to the understanding and application of vibrational spectroscopy, is named in his honor, as is the Coblentz Medal. Coblentz was given membership card number 1 from the Society. Coblentz died just before his 1905 work on infrared spectroscopy was reprinted, nearly 60 years after its first publication.

==Family and personal life==
In his autobiography, &quot;From the Life of a Researcher&quot; (1951), William Coblentz described his typical day as long hours of laboratory research followed by evenings spent on data analysis and writing papers. This left little time for socializing, and so it is not unexpected that Coblentz was over 50 before ever marrying. He wed Catherine Emma Cate of Vermont on June 10, 1924, and it is said that they spent their honeymoon in Flagstaff, Arizona while Coblentz was at the Lowell Observatory measuring planetary temperatures. Catherine Cate Coblentz achieved success as a writer of children&#x27;s book, worked for a time at the National Bureau of Standards, and was instrumental in raising money to build the Cleveland Park Neighborhood Library in Washington, DC.

William Coblentz reportedly was plagued by periods of poor health, but he lived nearly 90 years. He is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, DC alongside his wife and an infant daughter.

<text>James Griffin Stadium is a 4,367-capacity stadium in Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA.

== History ==
Although it is located on the grounds of Saint Paul Central High School, It was previously a venue for two high schools in the Saint Paul public school district who did* not have a football stadium of their own; Como Park and Johnson. It was also home the Concordia University football and women&#x27;s soccer teams until 2008 as well as the Hamline University football team for one season while their stadium was rebuilt.

The stadium was home to the Minnesota Thunder from 2004 through May 12, 2008.

The stadium, colloquially referred to as &quot;The Jimmy&quot; by Thunder supporters and &quot;The Griff&quot; by Concordia fans, was originally named Central Stadium. It was renamed in 1988 for James S. Griffin, the first black police captain in Saint Paul, as well as an athlete and athletic official.

After 14 years at the National Sports Center in Blaine the Minnesota Thunder moved to James Griffin Stadium. The Thunder cited the increased accessibility, compared to a suburb away, and the want to expand its fan base. In May 2008 the Thunder moved back to the National Sports Center.

==Evolution==

James Griffin Stadium has seen a significant number of changes in the early 2000s. The first of these changes were the installation of powerful halogen lights in place of old light poles that were placed in front of the bleachers. The old lights were known to block some viewing angles from fans as well as television crews.

In 2003, the grass surface was removed from the field and replaced by artificial turf, manufactured and installed by Sprinturf. This was a welcome move by many Central and Concordia athletes, as the grass surface was torn up by the high amount of football and soccer games in the fall. Funding was made possible through donations from Concordia University, the Minnesota Vikings, and the NFL Youth Football Fund.

During the winter of 2006-2007, the track was replaced and expanded. The track had been previously damaged when the artificial turf was installed in 2003. The track expanded from 6 lanes to 8 lanes and now can accommodate Minnesota State High School League sanctioned events in track and field. The renovations moved the handicap accessible ramps from ground level into the stands themselves.

During this time, the Minnesota Thunder team again relocated back to their original headquarters in Blaine. Concordia University also began construction on a brand new stadium of their own on the other side of their campus. With the departure of both Concordia and the Minnesota Thunder, Griffin Stadium was again officially designated as Central High School&#x27;s home field by the St. Paul School District. However, other high schools within the district (including Como Park and Johnson) continue to use it for varsity athletics in lieu of their own fields which have not yet been evaluated by the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL).

The scoreboard was the last element to receive an upgrade in the stadium. Before the start of fall sports in 2009, the eggcrate-style scoreboard was replaced with an LED version to enhance visibility during daytime games.

In addition to sporting events, James Griffin Stadium has been the host site for the Rondo Days drill team competition numerous times.

<doc id="807936" wikidata="Q1138500" url="?curid=807936" title="Cathedra">
<text>A cathedra is the raised throne of a bishop in the early Christian basilica. When used with this meaning, it may also be called the bishop&#x27;s throne. With time, the related term &quot;cathedral&quot; became synonymous with the &quot;seat&quot;, or principal church, of a bishopric.

The word in modern languages derives from a normal Greek word καθέδρα [&quot;kathédra&quot;], meaning &quot;seat&quot;, with no special religious connotations, and the Latin &quot;cathedra&quot;, specifically a chair with arms.

It is a symbol of the bishop&#x27;s teaching authority in the Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion churches.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;cathedra&quot;, plural cathedrae, comes from the Latin word for &quot;armchair&quot;, itself derived from the Greek (καθέδρα). After the 4th century, the term&#x27;s Roman connotations of authority reserved for the Emperor were adopted by bishops. It is closely related to the etymology of the word chair.

===&quot;Cathedrae apostolorum&quot;===
The term appears in early Christian literature in the phrase &quot;cathedrae apostolorum&quot;, indicating authority derived directly from the apostles.

===&quot;Ex cathedra&quot;===

The doctrine of papal infallibility, the Latin phrase &quot;ex cathedra&quot; (literally, &quot;from the chair&quot;) was proclaimed at the First Vatican Council by Pius IX in 1870 as meaning &quot;when, in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, the Bishop of Rome defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole Church.&quot;

===&quot;Cathedra&quot; as bishop&#x27;s see===
Tertullian () was the first to use cathedra in the meaning of a bishop&#x27;s see.

===Cathedrals as a bishop&#x27;s seat===
Eventually, the main church of a diocese, used as the primary church by its bishop, received the title &#x27;cathedral&#x27;. The cathedral is literally the church into which a bishop&#x27;s official &quot;cathedra&quot; is installed.

The Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church makes use of the term &quot;cathedral&quot; to point out the existence of a bishop in each local church, in the heart of ecclesial apostolicity.

==Notable examples==
===Cathedra Petri===

The definitive example of a &quot;cathedra&quot; is that encased within the &quot;Triumph of the cathedra Petri&quot; designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1657, and completed and installed in St Peter&#x27;s Rome in 1666. As early as the 8th century, an ancient wooden chair overlaid with ivory plaques depicting The Twelve Labours of Heracles and some of the constellations, was venerated as the episcopal chair of St. Peter. It is a Byzantine throne with framed fragments of acacia wood, encased in the oak carcass and reinforced with iron bands. It was long believed to have been used by the Apostle Saint Peter, but the Holy See recognises that the chair was a gift from Holy Roman Emperor Charles the Bald to Pope John VIII in 875. Several rings facilitated its transportation during processions. Pope Alexander VII commissioned Bernini to build a monument to display this relic in a triumphant manner. Bernini&#x27;s gilded bronze throne, richly ornamented with &quot;bas-reliefs&quot;, encloses the relic. On January 17, 1666, it was solemnly set above the altar of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City. Greater than life-sized sculptures of four Doctors of the Church form an honour guard: St. Ambrose and St. Athanasius on the left, and St. John Chrysostom and St. Augustine on the right.

Celebrated on February 22 in accordance with the calendar of saints, the Feast of Cathedra Petri (the Feast of the Chair of Peter the Apostle) honours the founding of the church in Rome and gives thanks for the work of Saint Peter.

===Chair of Bishop Maximianus===
A fifth- or sixth-century bishop&#x27;s throne decorated with elaborate ivory carving is preserved in the sacristy of the cathedral at Ravenna. It bears a monogram in front, &quot;Maximianus ep.&quot;, which gave it its name. The identity of the bishop is given by the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia as Maximianus of Constantinople (d. 431), considered as more likely than Maximianus of Ravenna (d. 556).

===Chair of St. Augustine===
The Chair of St. Augustine represents one of the most ancient extant cathedrae in use. Named after the first Archbishop of Canterbury, St. Augustine of Canterbury, it is made of Purbeck Marble or Bethesda marble and dates to sometime between the 6th and 12th centuries. Those who argue for an older date suggest that it may have been used to crown the kings of Kent. Canterbury Cathedral, in which the cathedra is housed, maintains that the chair was once part of the furnishings of the shrine of St. Thomas Becket, since dismantled. Since the Middle Ages, it has always been used in the triple enthronement of an Archbishop of Canterbury. He is seated on the throne in the quire as Diocesan Bishop, in the chapter house as titular abbot, and in St. Augustine&#x27;s chair as Primate of All England. This is the only occasion in which the cathedra is used. A second cathedra is used for other occasions at which the archbishop is present.

==Placement==
The early Christian bishop&#x27;s throne, or &quot;cathedra&quot;, stood in an elevated position behind the altar, near the wall of the apse. It had been the position of the magistrate in the apse of the Roman basilica, which provided the model type—and sometimes were adapted as the structures—for early Christian basilicas.

===Western churches===
In the Middle Ages, as altars came to be placed against the wall of the apse, the practice of placing the cathedra to one side (mostly left) became standard.

In the Roman Catholic Church since the Second Vatican Council, the altar is often free-standing. The cathedra in cathedrals built or renovated after Vatican II is sometimes placed behind the altar, as in ancient Roman basilicas.

In Anglican practice, the cathedra tends to be placed to one side in the choir, although in more contemporary practice, it is commonly placed on the gospel side of the chancel (i.e., to the left of the altar, as one looks at it from the front).

===Eastern churches===
Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Catholic churches have a throne for the bishop in the apse behind the holy table, with seats for the priests (Greek: &quot;synthranon&quot;) arranged to either side. This location is referred to as the &quot;high place&quot; and represents the presence of Christ presiding over the services, even when the bishop is not present and therefore an icon of Christ is often placed above the bishop&#x27;s throne. The bishop ascends to the high place only during the divine liturgy, at the &quot;Trisagion&quot;. For this reason, the consecration of a bishop takes place at the &quot;Trisagion,&quot; so that he may ascend to the high place for the first time as a bishop during the liturgy at which he is consecrated.

Another throne is provided for the bishop in the nave of the church:

*In the Greek Orthodox Church practice, this is normally located along the southern wall of the church, on the kliros. In this style, it is one of the monastic choir stalls (&quot;kathismata&quot;), only more elaborately carved, usually at the top of three steps, and with a canopy above it. During the divine liturgy, the deacon ascends to this throne to read the gospel, facing west.
*In the Russian Orthodox Church practice, the &quot;kafedra&quot; (, &quot;káfedra&quot;) is a large square platform set in the very center of the nave, with a removable chair or faldstool placed on it. This arrangement is a remnant of the ancient bemah (Greek: &quot;amvon&quot;), borrowed from the Jewish synagogue, which stood in the center of the church in ancient times. Sometimes during the liturgy, the deacon stands on this platform, facing east, to read the gospel.

An &quot;orlets&quot; is usually placed at both the high place and the throne in the nave. An orlets is usually kept permanently on the Russian &quot;kafedra&quot;, even when the chair is removed; the orlets is, however, removed when a deacon stands on the &quot;kafedra&quot; to read the gospel.

<doc id="807939" wikidata="Q8057497" url="?curid=807939" title="You Shall Know Our Velocity">
<text>You Shall Know Our Velocity! is a 2002 novel by Dave Eggers. It was Eggers&#x27;s debut novel, following the success of his memoir &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot; (2000).

The plot follows Will and Hand, two childhood friends who set out on a week-long around-the-world odyssey, ostensibly to give away a large sum of money.

==Plot summary==
Will has surprisingly come into a large amount of money, around $32,000. His photograph screwing in a light bulb has been made into a silhouette and is being used as a picture for a lighting company&#x27;s light bulb boxes. He is uncomfortable having this money since he feels he did nothing to earn it and is left with guilt and purposelessness. Shortly after receiving the sum, Will and Hand&#x27;s mutual childhood friend, Jack, was involved in a car accident. The pair had delusional ambitions to use the money to save his life, but to no avail. After Jack&#x27;s death, Will and Hand are asked to help go through Jack&#x27;s possessions in a storage facility, where Hand decides to wander around and leaves Will.

During Hand&#x27;s absence, Will is brutally beaten by three men. Will and Hand agree that it is best not to go to the hospital lest the attackers attempt to track them. As a result of his confusion due to a conglomerate of issues, such as the large sum of money, Jack&#x27;s death, Will&#x27;s beating, and other personal issues, Will and Hand plan to travel around the world, visiting obscure countries and giving away all the money, bit by bit, to people they arbitrarily decide are most deserving. According to Hand, they gave to people for the benefit of both parties as a sacrament to restore faith in humanity.

The two devise many creative ways of distributing the unwanted money. One plan involves taping money to a donkey in a graph paper pouch that reads &quot;HERE I AM ROCK YOU LIKE A HURRICANE&quot; and another creating a treasure map for Estonian children. While on the journey, the two friends do many wild and spontaneous things, including practicing rolling over cars and jumping from tree to tree while 20 feet in the air. However, their quest proves surprisingly tricky without a solid set of criteria or a definitive direction in their plan. They experience much awkward confusion and moral uncertainty, and they often fear being robbed and killed. Will becomes unstable and begins to lose his composure.

The plot is both a log of the journey and a look into the narrator&#x27;s mind, Will.

A pseudo-sequel, titled &quot;The Only Meaning of the Oil-Wet Water&quot;, follows Hand and the minor character Pilar in Central America. This short story is featured in the collection &quot;How We Are Hungry: Stories&quot; (2004).

==Different editions==
In February 2003, Eggers and McSweeney&#x27;s published &quot;Sacrament&quot;, a retitled hardcover edition of &quot;You Shall Know Our Velocity&quot; that included a new 49-page section inserted into the middle of the story. The U.S. trade paperback edition of &quot;You Shall Know Our Velocity!&quot; (with an exclamation point added to the title), released later that year by Vintage, includes this new material. The addition, narrated by Hand, calls into question the reliability of the narrator, and, depending on which version is read, &quot;You Shall Know Our Velocity&quot; can be viewed as two different stories. In Hand&#x27;s version, their third friend, Jack, never existed. Instead, he is a metaphorical representation of Will&#x27;s mother, a device Will used to cope with the loss that occurred several years before the trip (rather than alive and in contact with Will as in his version). Hand also corrects one of the most startling scenes in Will&#x27;s version, in which Will breaks down emotionally, claiming that Will was too shy to do such a thing. Hand does say that Will&#x27;s version was 85% true, though he did hate the title, renaming it &quot;Sacrament&quot;.

Will narrated the original version entirely. In the world of the revised version, Will&#x27;s memoirs was published six years earlier. Hand has taken it upon himself to insert his perspective immediately after the story&#x27;s climax. Hand&#x27;s meta-narrative is entirely self-contained, and it is as much a personal digression as it is a relevant critique of the story as presented by Will.

For the hardcover version of You Shall Know Our Velocity, the opening paragraph is printed directly on the front cover. In Sacrament, Hand alludes to the opening paragraph being written by a ghostwriter.

==Reception==
On Bookmarks January/February 2003 issue, a magazine that aggregates critic reviews of books, the book received a (2.5 out of 5) based on critic reviews with a critical summary saying, &quot;Dave Eggers can lay claim to some &quot;glorious gifts as a writer&quot; (Michiko Kakutani, &quot;The New York Times&quot;), but for the most part, &quot;Velocity&quot; is a mediocre follow-up to his comic and grief-stricken &quot;Heartbreaking Work&quot;&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; review under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Independent On Sunday&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and &quot;TLS&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Literary Review&quot; review under &quot;Ok&quot; and &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Observer&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reviews under &quot;Rubbish&quot;. 
==Film adaptation==
The book was optioned by Process Productions, with Miguel Arteta attached to direct.

<text>A tiltwing aircraft features a wing that is horizontal for conventional forward flight and rotates up for vertical takeoff and landing. It is similar to the tiltrotor design where only the propeller and engine rotate. Tiltwing aircraft are typically fully capable of VTOL operations.

The tiltwing design offers certain advantages in vertical flight relative to a tiltrotor. Because the slipstream from the rotor strikes the wing on its smallest dimension, the tiltwing is able to apply more of its engine power to lifting the aircraft. For comparison, the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor loses about 10% of its thrust to interference from the wings.

Another advantage of tiltwing aircraft is the ease of transition between VTOL and horizontal flight modes. A tiltrotor must first fly forwards like a helicopter, building airspeed until wing lift is sufficient to allow the nacelles to begin tilting down. As a note, the MV-22 Osprey&#x27;s stall speed in airplane mode is . Conversely, a tiltwing aircraft can begin the transition from helicopter to airplane at zero forward airspeed. Because of this, the Canadair CL-84 Dynavert was able to take off vertically, then accelerate from zero airspeed to in 8 seconds.

However, the fixed wing of a tiltrotor aircraft offers a superior angle of attack—thus more lift and a shorter takeoff roll—when performing STOL/STOVL operations.

The main drawbacks of tiltwing aircraft are susceptibility to wind gusts in VTOL mode and lower hover efficiency. The wing tilted vertically represents a large surface area for crosswinds to push against. Tiltrotors generally have better hover efficiency than tiltwings, but less than helicopters. This is due to the difference in rotor disk loading.

As of 2014, NASA is testing a diesel-electric hybrid 10-foot 10-rotor tiltwing called the GL-10 Greased Lightning, with most propellers folding during horizontal flight.

<doc id="807946" wikidata="Q2564753" url="?curid=807946" title="Union Observatory">
<text>Union Observatory, also known as Transvaal Observatory, Republic Observatory and Johannesburg Observatory (078), is a defunct astronomical observatory in Johannesburg, South Africa that operated from 1903 to 1971. It is located on Observatory Ridge, the city&#x27;s highest point at 1,808 metres altitude in the suburb Observatory.

The observatory and its former annex, the , are known for the discovery of 6,000 double stars and for Proxima Centauri, made by astronomer Robert Innes. At the observatory, 578 identifications of minor planet were made, a record number at the time. The Minor Planet Center credits the observatory as the site where 147 minor planets were discovered by astronomers Harry Wood, Cyril Jackson, Hendrik van Gent, Ernest Johnson, Ejnar Hertzsprung, Jacobus Bruwer and Joseph Churms &quot;(see )&quot;.

== History ==
The origins of the observatory began when Theodore Reunert of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science petitioned Alfred Milner Governor of the Transvaal Colony on 29 October 1902 for the establishment of a meteorological and astronomical observatory in Johannesburg. Assistant Colonial Secretary W.H. Moor agreed to the project on 17 December 1902 with the budget increased from £1,350 to £5,629 due to equipment changes. 

On 1 April 1903, a new Meteorological Department was temporarily established in Johannesburg. A location was sought for the new observatory and the Johannesburg Town Council made a decision on 12 May 1903, located within the municipal boundaries. The land of eight acres, on a ridge west of the Indian War Memorial, was on the northern boundary of the farm &quot;Doornfontein&quot;, presently part of the suburb Observatory and was given as a gift by the Bezuidenhout family, with a further two acres sold for £500. The land was given only for the use of science and a road, later called Observatory Avenue, was also to be built close to the site. The observatory building was built and the formal opening took place on 17 January 1905 by Governor Milner, but had no astronomical equipment.

In 1906 it was lent a Hamberg universal instrument (2 5/8-inch object glass) by Dr Oskar Backlund. In September 1907 a 9-inch Grubb refractor was now used but repolished in 1908. Mr J. Franklin-Adams gifted the observatory a 10-inch triple O.G. Cooke Star-Camera in 1909. J.B. Rissik, Minister for Lands, permitted the purchase of a 26-inch refracting telescope from the Grubb Telescope Company in 1909.

With the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, South Africa&#x27;s two colonial observatories came under the control of the Minister of the Interior. With the removal of the meteorological functions, the observatory was renamed Observatory of the Union of South Africa (Union Observatory) on 1 April 1912. It became the Republic Observatory in 1961.

Well remembered for the quality of its Directors, work done on minor planets and the discovery of Proxima Centauri, growing light pollution problems in Johannesburg led to its closure in 1971–1972. The Observatory&#x27;s buildings at 18a Gill Street, Observatory, Johannesburg, still exist.

At that time the South African government decided to amalgamate all astronomical research into one body, which later became known as the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO); it has its headquarters in Cape Town and has Sutherland as its outstation. The main Cape telescopes were moved to Sutherland, and the Radcliffe Observatory at Pretoria was also dismantled.

The main-belt asteroid 1585 Union, discovered by Ernest Johnson in 1947, was named for the Union observatory.


=== Name changes ===
Union Observatory went through a number of name changes:
* 1903–1909: Transvaal Meteorological Department
* 1909–1912: Transvaal Observatory 
* 1912–1961: Union Observatory
* 1961–1971: Republic Observatory 

=== Directors ===
Its directors were:
* 1903–1927: Robert Innes 
* 1927–1941: Harry Edwin Wood 
* 1941–1956: Willem Hendrik van den Bos 
* 1957–1965: William Stephen Finsen
* 1965–1971: Jan Hers (1915–2010)
== Leiden Southern Station ==

The Leiden Southern Station () was a collaboration between the Dutch Leiden Observatory and Union Observatory. From 1938 to 1954 it was an annex to the Union Observatory, and was moved to Hartbeespoort in 1954 due to light pollution. It operated until 1978.

== Discoveries ==

=== List of discovered minor planets ===

The Minor Planet Center credits Union Observatory (&quot;Johannesburg&quot;), as the site of 147 minor planet discoveries, made by the following list of astronomers:

* Harry Edwin Wood
* Cyril Jackson
* Hendrik van Gent
* Ernest Leonard Johnson
* Ejnar Hertzsprung
* Jacobus Albertus Bruwer
* Joseph Churms

<doc id="807964" wikidata="Q1593067" url="?curid=807964" title="Tail-sitter">
<text>A tail-sitter, or tailsitter, is a type of VTOL aircraft that takes off and lands on its tail, then tilts horizontally for forward flight.

Originating in the 1920s with the inventor Nikola Tesla, the first aircraft to adopt a tail-sitter configuration were developed by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Development of such aircraft spiked during the late 1940s and 1950s, as aircraft designers and defence planners alike recognised the potential value of fixed-wing aircraft that could perform both a vertical take-off and vertical landing while also transitioning into and out of conventional flight. Inherent problems with tail-sitter aircraft were poor pilot visibility and control difficulties, especially during vertical descent and landing. Programmes to develop manned tail-sitters were typically terminated in the form of the more practical thrust vectoring approach, as used by aircraft such as the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and Yakovlev Yak-38.

== Description ==
A tail-sitter sits vertically on its tail for takeoff and landing, then tilts the whole aircraft forward for horizontal flight. This is very different from the many other kinds of VTOL technologies, which have horizontally-oriented fuselages.

Tail-sitters change fuselage orientation after take-off. They start off with the back of the aircraft to the ground (...a vertical orientation), and then reorient to a horizontal orientation in flight.

Some tail-sitters then landed conventionally in horizontally-oriented configuration, while others had a much more ambitious goal of landing vertically with the aircraft&#x27;s back to the ground, a highly hazardous procedure for many reasons, prime of which was increased fuel consumption and limited pilot visibility.

==History==
===Early work===
The concept of a tail-sitting aircraft can be attributed to originate with the inventor Nikola Tesla, who filed for an associated patent during 1928. However, no immediate attempt to implement this concept into a functional aircraft would emerge for almost two decades.

During the Second World War, Nazi Germany worked on the Focke-Wulf &quot;Triebflügel&quot; (&quot;thrust-wing&quot;) fighter that incorporated the tail-sitter concept into its design. It featured three wings that were mounted radially as a rotor on a rotating section of the fuselage, these were driven by small jet engines positioned on the wingtips to propel the aircraft via this wing rotation. For takeoff and landing, it would fly vertically (akin to a helicopter) before tilting over horizontally to fly as a self-propelled wing generating both lift and thrust. The contemporary Heinkel Lerche project had an annular wing forming a duct around a conventional propeller, and in the transition from vertical to forward flight the lift would have transferred to the wing.

===Cold War era===
During the 1950s, aircraft designers around the world engaged in programmes to develop fixed-wing aircraft that could not only perform both a vertical take-off and vertical landing, but transition into and out of conventional flight as well. As observed by the aviation author Francis K. Mason, a combat aircraft that possessed such qualities would have effectively eliminate the traditional reliance on relatively vulnerable runways by taking off and landing vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach. Accordingly, the development of viable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft was particularly attractive to military planners of the early postwar era. As the thrust-to-weight ratio of turbojet engines increased sufficiently for a single engine be able to lift an aircraft, designers began to investigate ways of maintaining stability while an aircraft was flying in the VTOL stage of flight.

One company that opted to engage in VTOL research was the French engine manufacturer SNECMA who, beginning in 1956, built a series of wingless test rigs called the Atar Volant. Only the first of these was unpiloted and the second flew freely, both stabilized by gas jets on outrigger pipes The third had a tilting seat to allow the pilot to sit upright when the fuselage was level and had the lateral air intakes planned for the free flying aircraft, though it always operated attached to a movable cradle. The pilot for these experiments was Auguste Morel. However, the Atar Volant was not an end onto itself; its long term purpose was to serve as precursors to a larger fixed-wing aircraft. Independently of this work, substantial influence on the direction of development came from the Austrian design engineer Helmut von Zborowski, who had designed an innovative doughnut-shaped annular wing that could function &quot;as power plant, airframe of a flying wing aircraft and drag-reducing housing&quot;. It was theorised that such a wing could function as a ramjet engine and propel an aircraft at supersonic speeds, suitable for an interceptor aircraft.

SNECMA&#x27;s design team decided to integrate this radical annual wing design into their VTOL efforts. Accordingly, from this decision emerged the basic configuration of the C.450 Coléoptère. In December 1958, the Coléoptère first left the ground under its own power, albeit while attached to a gantry. Several challenging flight characteristics were observed, such as the tendency for the aircraft to slowly spin on its axis while in a vertical hover; its pilot also noted that the vertical speed indicator was unrealistic and that the controls were incapable of steering the aircraft with precision while performing the critical landing phase. Dead-stick landings were deemed to be an impossibility. One of aircraft&#x27;s flights involved a public display of its hover performance before an assembled audience. The eye-catching design of the Coléoptère rapidly made waves in the public conscious, even internationally; author Jeremy Davis observed that the aircraft had even influenced international efforts, having allegedly motivated the United States Navy to contract American helicopter manufacturer Kaman Aircraft to design its own annular-wing vehicle, nicknamed the Flying Barrel.

Accordingly, the United States experimented with its own tail-sitters, typically involving propeller-driven design configurations with relatively conventional fixed wings. The Convair XFY Pogo was one such aircraft, featuring a delta wing with cruciform tail configuration; initial test flights were conducted inside of a naval airship hangar at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California. The XFY successfully demonstrated the full transition between flight modes on 5 November 1954. A somewhat similar aircraft was the Lockheed XFV &quot;Salmon&quot;, which paired a straight wing with an X tail; however, the XFV never achieved the crucial flight transition. However, it became evident during flight testing that such VTOL aircraft would be flown only by the most experienced pilots, even if all technical problems were disregarded; thus, it was not feasible to place VTOL fighters—as previously hoped for—on every ship. Also, whereas jet-engined fighters had top speeds that approached Mach 2, the turboprop VTOL fighter was at a disadvantage due to its maximum speed being below Mach 1. As a result of these circumstances, work on the XFY was halted. During 1955, the United States commenced flight testing of a jet-powered design, the Ryan X-13 Vertijet. Two prototypes were constructed, both of which flew, made successful transitions to and from horizontal flight, and landed. The X-13&#x27;s final test flight was conducted near Washington DC during 1957.

An inherent problem with all these tail-sitter designs was poor pilot visibility, especially of the ground, during vertical descent and landing. Ultimately, most work on applying the concept towards manned aircraft were abandoned upon the arrival of more practical form of VTOL appeared, in the form of thrust vectoring, as used by production aircraft such as the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and Yakovlev Yak-38. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) does not suffer the problem of pilot attitude. The Dornier Aerodyne is of ducted-fan configuration similar to a coleopter, and a test UAV flew successfully in hover mode in 1972, before development was discontinued. Another contemporary UAV project was the NSRDC BQM-108 that was developed by the United States Navy; although work was discontinued almost immediately after its single successful test flight.

During the 1970s, several studies and wind tunnel models were made of a tail-sitting version of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon that was intended for use on board ships; however, it was decided not to pursue further development of the concept due to the large thrust requirement involved, as well as the need for extensive apparatus to handle take-off and landing.

=== In the present ===
At present, most of the tail sitter projects or proposals fall under the category of unmanned aircraft such as Bell Apt or Northrop Grumman Tern.

<doc id="807979" wikidata="Q1367163" url="?curid=807979" title="Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)">
<text>Swiss Family Robinson is a 1960 American adventure film starring John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, James MacArthur, Janet Munro, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran in a tale of a shipwrecked family building an island home. It was the second feature film based on the 1812 novel &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; by Johann David Wyss, a previous adaptation having been released by RKO Pictures in 1940. Directed by Ken Annakin and shot in Tobago and Pinewood Studios outside London, it was the first widescreen Walt Disney Pictures film shot with Panavision lenses; when shooting in widescreen, Disney had almost always used a matted wide screen or filmed in CinemaScope.

Upon its release, &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; was a major success with both critics and audiences and remains one of Disney&#x27;s most beloved live-action feature films.

==Plot==

A ship carrying a Swiss family from Bern—Father, Mother, and their three sons, who are relocating to a colony in New Guinea to escape the Napoleonic Wars—is attacked by pirates. Abandoned by the crew, the ship eventually grounds on rocks off an uninhabited island. The family makes their way ashore along with the captain&#x27;s two Great Danes. Father, eldest son Fritz, and middle son Ernst salvage supplies and livestock from the shipwreck. The pirates locate the ship, but Father scares them off by putting up a quarantine flag, signaling Bubonic plague aboard.

The family soon discovers that the island contains a diversity of wildlife, including a dangerous tiger. To provide safety and comfort, Father, Fritz, and Ernst construct an elaborate tree house complete with a water wheel. Youngest son Francis collects various animals including a young Asian elephant, a monkey, and an ostrich. Ernst theorizes that the island may once have been part of a land bridge between Africa and Asia. As the family settles in, Father opines that, by going back to nature, they have found everything they need in life. Mother, however, worries that her sons will never marry or have families if they are not rescued, and consents to allow Fritz and Ernst to circumnavigate the island in a homemade outrigger boat and search for other settlements.

During their expedition, the brothers come across the pirates, who have captured another ship and taken its captain and cabin boy captive. They rescue the cabin boy, but the pirates spot them before they can free the captain, who insists they leave him since the pirates intend to ransom him. The brothers and the boy flee the pirates through the jungle, the brothers later learning that the &quot;boy&quot; is really a girl named Roberta. The captain (her grandfather) cut her hair and dressed her as a boy to disguise her gender from the pirates. They survive an attack by a green anaconda, but become lost and fight over what to do. Fritz&#x27;s strong personality wins in the end, and they decide to press on. They rescue a zebra from hyenas and a quicksand trap; using it as a mount, they arrive back at the tree house just in time for Christmas.

Anticipating that the pirates will come looking for Roberta, the family scuttles their wrecked ship to hide their location. They fortify a rocky clifftop, building defenses and booby traps. Fritz and Ernst become rivals for Roberta&#x27;s affections. Believing that her grandfather will return for her once ransomed, she intends to return to London; Ernst is interested in going to school there, while Fritz would rather go on to New Guinea to build a home of his own. Despite this, a romance develops between Fritz and Roberta, and the brothers come to blows over her. To relieve tension, Father declares a holiday to be held. That night, Francis manages to catch the tiger in one of the pits that they have dug.

The holiday begins with a race, the boys and Roberta riding on various animals. The pirates, sailing nearby, hear the sound of the starting pistol and come ashore. The family retreats to their fort, and the attackers fall victim to their traps and defenses. Kuala, the pirate captain, demands that they hand over Roberta, while his men sneak up the cliff side and attack from the rear. As the family is about to be overwhelmed, a ship captained by Roberta&#x27;s grandfather appears, destroying the pirates and their ship with cannon fire.

The captain offers to help Ernst get into a London university, and to take the rest of the family back to Europe or on to New Guinea. Father and Mother, however, decide that they would rather stay on the island and keep Francis with them for a few more years. The captain speculates that the island will become a new colony, and that Father will be nominated to be its governor. Fritz and Roberta also decide to stay on the island, and the family waves goodbye to Ernst as he, the captain, and the ship&#x27;s crew set out for England.

==Production==

===Development===
The film is based upon &quot;Der Schweizerische Robinson&quot; (translated as &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;), a book written by Johann David Wyss. RKO Pictures had previously made an adaptation in 1940, directed by Edward Ludwig. After watching that movie, Walt Disney and Bill Anderson decided to produce their own version of the story. Anderson talked with director Ken Annakin during filming of another live-action Disney picture, &quot;Third Man on the Mountain&quot;, near Zermatt (Switzerland). Ken Annakin had also worked with Disney in the 1953 adventure film &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot;.

Annakin worked on the script with Bill Anderson and Lowell Hawley. The idea to have the brothers discover a girl dressed as a boy came from Janet Munro, who had been in &quot;Third Man in the Mountain&quot; and was then making &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot;. She was telling stories about playing a boy when working on stage with her father and Disney had this incorporated into the film.
There were several meetings to decide filming locations. There was talk of making the film in a studio in Burbank, California or filming on location in a natural environment. Annakin wanted to film in Ceylon, and the associate producer Basil Keys, in East Africa. Bill Anderson stressed that they should examine the Caribbean. They visited Jamaica and Trinidad, but it was not what they wanted. Somebody in Trinidad told them of a nearby island, Tobago. When they saw the island for the first time, they &quot;fell instantly in love&quot;, and they sent a telegram to Anderson, who traveled to Tobago and found it fitted to their needs. However, one of the drawbacks of this choice was that the island had no local wildlife. Once Walt Disney accepted, cast and crew got their shots and passports for a six-month stay in Tobago. Filming began in August 1959 and was a wrap just before Christmas 1959. The closeups of the stars on the animals—to complete the animal race scene around the treehouse—was done in January 1960.

===Filming===
Richmond Bay was featured prominently as the Robinsons&#x27; beach, while Mount Irvine Bay was used for the scene where the boys rescue Bertie from the pirates. The vine-swinging/waterfall scenes were filmed at the Craig Hall Waterfall in Moriah. The choppy waters at Quashie (Carapuse) Bay in Belle Garden was used for anchoring the shipwreck against the rocks, giving the illusion that it was out at sea. The cliffs at Bay Hill Rock, situated at the edge of John Dial Beach, Hillsborough Bay, was used for filming the canoe outrigger crashing on the rocks. Here, the boys came ashore to free Roberta (Janet Munro).

The treehouse was constructed in a 200-foot tall saman in the Goldsborough Bay area. Referring to the treehouse, Annakin said that &quot;it was really solid—capable of holding twenty crew and cast and constructed in sections so that it could be taken apart and rebuilt on film by the family.&quot; The tree was not an easy place to shoot, with only 3 hours of sunlight per day due to surrounding foliage. Walt Disney Productions constructed a massive studio in Goodwood which housed replica indoor sets of both the shipwreck and the main room of the treehouse. All of the scenes with the family aboard the ship, and the indoor treehouse scenes were filmed at the Disney studio in Goodwood.

The script required animals, which arrived from all around the world. Fourteen trainers looked after the animals. Gene Holter was one of the providers of animals from California and his trainers Ray Chandler and Fez Reynolds. The trainers met with the director every day around 4 PM and went over attitudes or gestures that the animals should play the next day. They spent the night learning them. The animals that were brought included eight dogs, two giant tortoises, forty monkeys, two elephants, six ostriches, four zebras, one hundred flamingos, six hyenas, two anacondas, and a tiger. Disney also brought some King Vultures (corbeaux) from Trinidad. After filming was completed in January 1960, the vultures were released and they all flew back to Trinidad.

Annakin wrote &quot;Moochie&quot; Corcoran &quot;was wonderfully coordinated and had hung around so many animal trainers and stuntmen, that he knew exactly what was called for and how much of the action he could handle. I never had to use a double with ‘Moochie&#x27;.&quot;

Soon after filming began in Tobago, the British film crew became unhappy with the wages that they were being paid by Disney. They threatened to abandon filming and return home. Their National Association of Theatrical and Kine Employees (NATKE) union representative, Cyril (Cid) Thawley, negotiated a new wage agreement which included overtime pay. Cid Thawley, along with some of the Disney crew were accommodated at Dellamira Hotel in Bacolet. The rest of the crew stayed at Robinson Crusoe Hotel in Scarborough and Blue Haven Hotel in Bacolet. Most evenings, the prop men relaxed at the Club La Tropical, located next to the Dellamira hotel.

After filming, the local Tobagonians convinced Disney, who had intended to remove all evidence of filmmaking, to let the treehouse remain, sans interior furnishing. In 1960, the treehouse was listed for sale for $9,000, a fraction of its original cost, and later became a popular attraction among locals and tourists, before the structure was finally destroyed by Hurricane Flora in September 1963. The tree still remains, and is located on the property of Roberts Auto Service and Tyre Shop, at Cow Farm Road, Goldsborough, just off the Windward Road. Tobagonian Lennox Straker says, &quot;The tree has fallen into obscurity; only a few of the older people knew of its significance.&quot; Three Tobagonians acted as stand-ins and doubles for the stars - James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, Janet Munro and Dorothy McGuire. Two of them still reside in Tobago and one lives in the USA. A few locals who were employed by Disney as drivers, hoteliers and office staff still live in Tobago. They are happy to share their memories of working with &#x27;the film company&#x27; back in 1959.

===Music===
The film features one original song, &quot;My Heart Was an Island,&quot; written by Terry Gilkyson. Mother Robinson sings the song as she hangs new curtains in the family&#x27;s treehouse. The song, however, is not heard in its entirety, as it trails off when the scene shifts to Ernst on the ground.

==Reception==
The film premiered in New York City on December 10, 1960 and was released for the general U.S. audience on December 21, 1960. It earned $8.1 million in domestic rentals, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 1960. Initial worldwide rentals were $12 million. It received generally positive reviews by critics and remains one of the most iconic live-action Disney films. When re-released in 1969, the film earned an additional $6.4 million in rentals in North America. The film&#x27;s lifetime domestic box office gross stands at $40 million.

Upon the film&#x27;s initial release, &quot;New York Times&quot; film critic Howard Thompson lauded it by writing, &quot;it&#x27;s hard to imagine how the picture could be better as a rousing, humorous and gentle-hearted tale of family love amid primitive isolation and dangers.&quot; In his &quot;Family Guide to Movies on Video&quot;, Henry Herx wrote: &quot;Nicely directed by Ken Annakin, much of the fun for children will come from the delightful and inventive conveniences the family builds and their relationships with the island&#x27;s wildlife.&quot; Tommy Kirk, who played Ernst, said it was the film he was most proud of. The film holds an 84% approval rating at the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, and, as of late November 2023, a 7.1 rating at IMDB, the online database of information related to films and TV programs. &quot;Filmink&quot; called it &quot;a deserved classic&quot;.

==Issues==
In 2019, Disney added a disclaimer to this and other films in their classic movie catalog, which led to some commentary asking whether the disclaimers were enough. The original disclaimers were updated in 2020 to acknowledge issues regarding racial stereotypes which “were wrong then and are wrong now.” Specifically, critics have objected to the film&#x27;s depiction of the villainous pirates, who are either portrayed by actors of color or by actors wearing makeup to appear Asian; one called it &quot;grossly stereotypical, insulting, and unnecessary.&quot; Critics have also argued that the film endorses colonization, as the Robinsons do not appear to consider whether there are native inhabitants on the island (although none are shown in the film).

==Remake==
On December 12, 2004, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that a remake of &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; was in development at Walt Disney Pictures, with Mandeville Films co-producing the film. In June 2005 it was reported that Jonathan Mostow would direct the remake, and David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman would produce. The following month, it was reported that studio veteran Lindsay Lohan was being considered for a role: &quot;Lindsay&#x27;s just talk at the moment...but that&#x27;s someone they want. It might depend on whether she&#x27;s happy to be part of an ensemble, and not the headliner.&quot;

Production on the remake never began, and the film was believed to be shelved until early 2009, when it was announced by /Film that it was still in the works, had been renamed &quot;The Robinsons&quot;, and was to star Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and their children Trey, Jaden and Willow. A movie was ultimately made based on elements of &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, titled &quot;After Earth&quot;, starring Will and Jaden Smith and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, and released in 2013.

In 2011, actor Bill Paxton expressed serious interest in producing and starring in a remake of the original film: &quot;I talked to a very prominent producer/filmmaker about the idea of teaming up to do this. I just think it would be great to make a little bit more of a butch, PG-13 version of that story – and I know it&#x27;s something that would appeal to an international audience.&quot; In 2014 it was announced that Steve Carell would possibly star in a modern update of the film, titled &quot;Brooklyn Family Robinson&quot;.

<text>Cockerill-Sambre was a group of Belgian steel manufacturers headquartered in Seraing, on the river Meuse, and in Charleroi, on the river Sambre. The Cockerill-Sambre group was formed in 1981 by the merger of two Belgian steel groups – SA Cockerill-Ougrée based at Seraing in the province of Liège, and Hainaut-Sambre based at Charleroi in the province of Hainaut – both being the result of post-World War II consolidations of the Belgian steel industry.

The company inherited a steel industry with significant debts and production overcapacity based on blast furnace production rather than electric furnace recycling, with numerous factory sites in constrained city locations, and adversely affected by competition in the export market from new steel-producing countries (such as South Korea and Brasil). The need to streamline was complicated by regional dependence on employment in the steel industry.

It was merged into Usinor in 1999, and after 2002 was part of the Arcelor group. As of 2010, the bulk of the group is part of the ArcelorMittal multinational steel group, where it is known as ArcelorMittal Liège.

The Cockerill group&#x27;s name came from the English-born Belgian industrialist John Cockerill, who founded John Cockerill &amp; Cie. in 1817. During the first few decades of its existence, the firm rose to become a major integrated steel company, not only producing iron in blast furnaces, but also producing machines and other articles from the metal. After John Cockerill&#x27;s death in 1840, the company became the state-owned Société anonyme John Cockerill, and an international-scale producer of iron and steel metal and products.

The 8 day Strike of the 100,000 originated at Cockerill on 10 May 1941, and eventually spread across the entirety of Liege province. The strike was both a way of seeking higher wages, and passively resisting the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. The strike was settled following an 8% wage increase, and future wartime strikes were often repressed by force.

In 1955 the company merged with Ougrée-Marihaye and &quot;Ferblatil&quot; to form Cockerill-Ougrée. The new company had a total steel production of over 2 million tonnes, and it employed over 45,000 people in 1957.

In 1961 &quot;Tolmatil&quot; became part of Cockerill-Ougrée, in 1962 it participated in the founding of Sidmar contributing 1bn Belgian francs of the companies 4.5bn capital. Further consolidation of companies occurred in 1966 when it merged with &quot;Les Forges de la Providence&quot;, a Belgian steelmaker with plants in northern France with three steel plants; in Réhon and Hautmont, (France) and in Marchienne-au-Pont, (Belgium) adding over 35,000 persons to the company. The new company was named Cockerill-Ougrée-Providence, and had a production capacity of 5 million tonnes of steel.

In 1969 the Phenix Works (Flémalle-Haute) became part of the Cockerill-Ougrée-Providence group (fully absorbed 1989).

In 1970 the company merged with the Liège-based &quot;Société Métallurgique d&#x27;Espérance Longdoz&quot;, forming Cockerill-Ougrée-Providence et Espérance Longdoz; the new group was the fifth largest steelmaker in the EEC, with a steel production capacity of 7million tonnes; the new group contained all the steel producing companies in the Liège basin.

In 1975 the company sold its 25% stake in Sidmar to Arbed. In 1979 the &quot;Forges de la Providence&quot; company was sold to &quot;Thy-Marcinelle et Monceau&quot; (TMM), disposing of the group&#x27;s interests outside the Liège area; the resulting Liège-based group being known simply as Cockerill.

The company then merged with the Charleroi-based steel group Hainaut-Sambre in 1981 to form Cockerill-Sambre.

===Cockerill-Sambre===
The merger to form Cockerill-Sambre was announced on 16 January 1981, and the company came into being on 26 June 1981. The company inherited a debt equivalent to 1363million Eur from Cockerill and a similar amount from Hainaut-Sambre. A rescue plan was drawn up by consultant Jean Gandois in 1983, the aim was to return the company by 1985, which was a prerequisite for sanction by the European Commission of a government-backed investment plan (the second Claes plan). One consequence of the restructuring was that, of 22,000 workers (1983), nearly 8,000 would no longer be required by 1986, in addition to production cuts and closures.

EKO Stahl (Eisenhüttenstadt) was acquired in 1994.

In 1999 the group became part of the French steel group Usinor; in 2002 there was another merger, this time with Arbed and Aceralia of Luxembourg and Spain, to form the continental western European steel giant Arcelor.

<text>(; &quot;West German Broadcasting Cologne&quot;), shortened to WDR (), is a German public-broadcasting institution based in the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia with its main office in Cologne. WDR is a constituent member of the consortium of German public-broadcasting institutions, ARD. As well as contributing to the output of the national television channel , WDR produces the regional television service (formerly known as WDF and West3) and six regional radio networks.

==History==

===Origins===
The Westdeutsche Funkstunde AG (WEFAG) was established on 15 September 1924.

There was a substantial purge of left wing staff following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. This included Ernst Hardt, Hans Stein and Walter Stern.
WDR was created in 1955, when Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) was split into Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) – covering Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, and Hamburg – and Westdeutscher Rundfunk, responsible for North Rhine-Westphalia. WDR began broadcasting on two radio networks (one produced jointly with NDR) on 1 January 1956. WDR constitutes the most prominent example of regional broadcasting in Germany.

==Funding==
WDR is in part funded by the limited sale of on-air commercial advertising time; however, its principal source of income is the revenue derived from viewer and listener licence fees. As of 2023 the monthly fee due from each household for radio and television reception was €18.36. These fees are collected not directly by WDR but by a joint agency of ARD (and its member institutions), ZDF, and Deutschlandradio.

==Services==
===Television===

WDR began its regional television service, Westdeutsches Fernsehen (WDF), on 17 December 1965. On 27 August 1967, when West Germany broadcast its first color TV program, WDF used a live broadcast originating from a Bosch outside broadcast van to start broadcasting in color. In 1988, the channel was renamed West 3; since 1994, it has been known as WDR Fernsehen.

While the programmes are mainly run from their Cologne headquarters, they also have a number of sub-regional studios contributing to a regular broadcast called &quot;Lokalzeit&quot; with the opt-outs &quot;aus Aachen&quot; (Aachen), &quot;OWL&quot; (Bielefeld), &quot;aus Bonn&quot; (Bonn), &quot;aus Dortmund&quot; (Dortmund), &quot;aus Düsseldorf&quot; (Düsseldorf), &quot;aus Duisburg&quot; (Duisburg), &quot;Ruhr&quot; (Essen), &quot;aus Köln&quot; (Cologne and Bonn), &quot;Münsterland&quot; (Münster), &quot;Südwestfalen&quot; (Siegen) and &quot;Bergisches Land&quot; (Wuppertal) for each respective region. WDR has its current affairs and regional politics studios in Düsseldorf.

It has served as the production entity for shows on Das Erste, such as &quot;Verbotene Liebe&quot; (&#x27;Forbidden Love&#x27;), which, over the years, has introduced many young actors to the German audience, such as Andreas Stenschke, Jo Weil, Luca Zamperoni and Kay Böger. The &quot;Sportschau&quot; is produced for ARD in Cologne, and WDR contributes to ARD Digital, &quot;3sat&quot; and &quot;arte&quot;.

===Radio===
A long-running talk show on wheels was &quot;Hallo Ü-Wagen&quot; (&quot;Hello Radio Van&quot;), which ran from 1974 to 2010 with Carmen Thomas as the original host.

WDR&#x27;s main radio channels are available on FM and digital (DAB+), as well as via cable and satellite:
* 1LIVE is a popular music channel modelled on BBC Radio 1 and aimed at a young audience. Its schedules include such non-mainstream night-time programmes as &quot;Heimatkult&quot;, focusing on pop music from Germany, and &quot;Lauschangriff&quot;, a series of audio-books.
* WDR 2, featuring adult-oriented popular music, focuses strongly on national and regional news, current affairs, and sport.
* WDR 3, the cultural channel, offers mostly classical, jazz and world music as well as radio drama and spoken-word features dealing with literature and the performing arts.
* WDR 4 (motto: &quot;Melodien für ein gutes Gefühl&quot;, &quot;Melodies for a good feeling&quot;) is a channel aimed chiefly towards an older audience. Its focus is on tuneful music – in particular, oldies and classic hits: popular music of the 1960s to the 1980s or later – with more specialized programming (operetta, country, folk) in the evenings. Around 30–40% of WDR 4&#x27;s musical output is made up of German-language songs.
* WDR 5 features spoken-word programming with the focus on present-day culture and society. Between 6.05 and 9.45 each Monday to Saturday morning the channel offers news, background briefing, interviews, and correspondents&#x27; reports in a sequence entitled &quot;Morgenecho&quot;. The main lunchtime and early-evening news and current affairs programmes &quot;Mittagsecho&quot; (at 13.05–14.00 on Mondays to Fridays and 13.30–14.30 on Sundays) and &quot;Echo des Tages&quot; (at 18.30–19.00 daily) are both co-productions with Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) in Hamburg. Additionally, WDR 2&#x27;s 30-minute round-up of the day&#x27;s most important news reports, &quot;Berichte von heute&quot;, is simulcast by WDR 5 on Monday to Friday evenings at 23.30. WDR 5 also carries children&#x27;s radio programming from KiRaKa at 19.05–20.00 each evening as well as on Sundays at 7.05–8.00 and 14.05–15.00.
* COSMO (earlier WDR 5 Funkhaus Europa – an offshoot of WDR 5 – and now a joint production of Radio Bremen, RBB, and WDR) is a channel principally aimed at serving immigrants and promoting integration. It features a wide selection of world music. It is not available over-the-air in every part of WDR&#x27;s broadcasting area.

Broadcast only via DAB (Digital Radio) as well as DVB-S and partly DVB-C:

<doc id="808044" wikidata="Q1202610" url="?curid=808044" title="La Fayette-class frigate">
<text>The &quot;La Fayette&quot; class (also known as FL-3000 for &quot;Frégate Légère de 3,000 tonnes&quot;, or FLF for &quot;Frégate Légère Furtive&quot;) is a class of general purpose frigates built by DCNS in the 1980s and 1990s, operated by the French Navy and three other navies. Derivatives of the type are in service in the navies of Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Taiwan.

The ships were originally known as &quot;stealth frigates&quot; due to their unique stealth design at the time. Their reduced radar cross section is achieved by a clean superstructure compared to conventional designs, angled sides and radar absorbent material, a composite material of wood and glass fibre as hard as steel, light, and resistant to fire. Most modern combat ships built since the introduction of the &quot;La Fayette&quot; class have followed the same principles of stealth.

All information gathered by the onboard sensors is managed by the Information Processing System, the electronic brain of the operation centre of the ship. It is completed by an electronic command aid system.

The ships are designed to accommodate a helicopter in the Panther or NH90 range (though they are also capable of operating the Super Frelon and similar heavy helicopters). These helicopters can carry anti-ship missiles AM39 or AS15, and they can be launched during sea state five or six due to the Samahé helicopter handling system. France ordered five ships of the &quot;La Fayette&quot; class in 1988, the last of which entered service in 2001. In the French Navy, they will be incrementally superseded in &quot;first-rank&quot; functions by five &quot;frégates de taille intermédiaire&quot; (&quot;FTI&quot;, &quot;intermediate size frigates&quot;) from 2024.

==French version==

=== Background ===

In the late 1980s, the French Navy (&quot;Marine Nationale&quot;) started the studies for frigates adapted to low-intensity conflicts in the post–Cold War era. The ships were to serve in the large French exclusive economic zone (EEZ), be adapted to humanitarian operations or low-intensity operations in support of land troops, and replace the aging s, which tended to prove too focused on naval operations and were ill-suited for joint operations.

Conventional warships used in low-intensity or humanitarian relief operations proved costly, with their heavy equipment and large crew. Hence came the requirement for lightly armed frigates with economical engines and small crew. In Italy, the same requirements led to the development of the and type corvettes, built according to both civilian and military standards. These ships were limited to because the limited size and depth of the Mediterranean Sea and the proximity of the homeland. The French Navy, on the other hand, had to be present in overseas territories, bases and EEZ. To be enduring enough, the ships had to reach , the size of a frigate. The larger displacement allows combining strong firepower (like the &quot;Minerva&quot; class) and a capacity for a medium helicopter (like the &quot;Cassiopea&quot; class), along with a good autonomy and seaworthiness.

The first type of ships built on these principles were the s, built on civilian standards, with a limited armament, and carrying a medium helicopter. These ships are high endurance units designed to be operated in overseas territories in the Caribbean Sea, Polynesia, and New Caledonia and the EEZ, where the likelihood of a naval threat is low. The speed is limited to because of the low-power engines which emphasised autonomy and reliability. To fight pirates in fast rigid-hulled inflatable boats, the &quot;Floréal&quot;s rely on their onboard helicopter and marine detachment.

The niche for more hostile environments is covered by the &quot;La Fayette&quot; type, designed to operate in complex zones like the Indian Ocean or Djibouti. These ships were to be able to secure the EEZ, but also to operate in naval groups or intelligence gathering missions. The intended role for the ships was in fact very varied, because the experience of the C.70 class, with an intended 20 ships cut down to only nine (the seven s and two s) had taught that project downsizing and reorganisation could lead to badly balanced naval capabilities. The new ships were to benefit from breakthroughs in stealth (&quot;furtivité&quot;) achieved by the DCN in the 1980s.

It took several years to refine the concept, and the first ship was eventually launched in 1992, two years after the final design was completed. Weapon system testing took place in 1994, and particularly extensive trials were undertaken to prove the structure of the ship under a wide range of conditions. &quot;La Fayette&quot; was eventually commissioned in March 1996.

===Stealth===

At the time of their commissioning, the units of the &quot;La Fayette&quot; class were the state of the art in stealth for warships. The shape of the hull and the superstructures is devised for the optimal reduction of the radar signature.Stealth is achieved with inclined flanks, as few vertical lines as possible, and very clean lines and superstructures: stairs and mooring equipment are internal, and prominent structures are covered by clear surfaces. The superstructures are built using radar-absorbent synthetic materials.

Their radar cross-section is equivalent to that of a large fishing boat, which can make camouflage among civilian ships possible; or that of a much less capable corvette, which could lead an enemy to underestimate the capabilities of the ship. In case of a direct attack, the small radar signature helps evade enemy missiles and fire control systems. The &quot;La Fayette&quot;s are also equipped with jammers that can generate false radar images, as well as decoy launchers.

Thanks to the adoption of low-power diesel motors and a special heat dissipation system, the &quot;La Fayette&quot; ships have a low thermal signature. The usual funnel is replaced with a small sets of pipes, aft of the mast, which cool the exit gas before it is released. The ships usually operate in warm areas, which further decreases the thermal contrast with the environment.

The magnetic signature is reduced by the presence of a demagnetisation belt.

The acoustic signature is minimized by mounting the engines on elastomeric supports, which minimize vibration transfers to the hull, and by rubber coatings on the propellers. The &quot;La Fayette&quot;s are equipped with the Prairie Masker active acoustic camouflage system, which generates small bubbles from underneath the hull to confuse sonars.

===Construction===
The superstructure is made of light alloy and glass-reinforced plastic, which allow a reduction in top weight. This provides adequate but sub-optimal resistance to fire. Vital zones are armoured in Kevlar, and important systems are redundant. The crew is protected against biological, chemical, and nuclear environments.

The ships were built with a modular inner structure from eleven prefabricated modules which were completed at the factory, delivered to the shipyard and assembled there. This technique results in a construction time of less than two years.

The hull has a pronounced angle at the stem, with a short forecastle that integrates directly into the superstructure. The ship&#x27;s sides have a negative inclination of ten degrees. The single anchor is located exactly on the stem, into which it is completely recessed. The deck where the seamanship equipment and capstans are installed is internal in order to hide it from radar.

The superstructure is built in one piece and directly integrates into the hull, with only a change in inclination. A platform is located between the main gun and the bridge. The superstructure runs continuously down to the helicopter hangar, on top of which short-range anti-aircraft Crotale missiles were initially installed (being replaced on three ships in the early 2020s with the SADRAL/Mistral system).

The ships feature two masts. The main mast has a pyramidal structure which integrates funnels and supports the antenna of the Syracuse military communications satellite system, while the second supports the main radar.

===Life extension upgrades===

Three of the French Navy frigates (&quot;La Fayette&quot;, &quot;Courbet&quot; and &quot;Aconit&quot;) were selected to receive mid-life upgrades extending their useful service lives into the early 2030s. The three frigates are receiving KingKlip Mk2 hull-mounted sonar to incorporate an anti-submarine capability, modernized point air defence systems (consisting of two renovated SADRAL launchers, removed from the retired &quot;Georges Leygues&quot; class, and operating Mistral Mk3 SAMs/SSMs) as well as other improvements including the ability to carry the latest version of the Exocet anti-ship missile and &quot;CANTO&quot; anti-torpedo countermeasures (initially fitted first to &quot;La Fayette&quot; when she received her upgrade in 2021–22). The upgrades increase the displacement of the ships by some and will permit the three ships to operate through the 2020s and be retired between 2031 and 2034. The first vessel, &quot;Courbet&quot;, began her conversion refit in October 2020. She returned to sea in June 2021. In October 2021, &quot;La Fayette&quot; began her planned refit and in November 2022 was declared operational again upon its completion. In February 2023 &quot;Aconit&quot;, the last of the frigates to be upgraded, began her life extension refit. She was relaunched in July and was expected to be fully operational again in 2024.

The other two vessels of the class (&quot;Surcouf&quot; and &quot;Guépratte&quot;) were scheduled to undergo more modest structural and technical upgrades (with the elderly Crotale SAM to be removed), and be withdrawn from service in 2027 and 2031 respectively. With somewhat reduced general purpose capability, it had been anticipated that the two ships would be re-assigned to offshore patrol duties for the remainder of their service life. However, subsequently it was decided to retain both ships in the frigate role despite their not having received a mid-life upgrade.

From 2024 the &quot;La Fayette&quot;-class units will be incrementally complemented, and eventually replaced, in first rank functions in the French Navy by the FDI-class frigates.

===Ships===
==Export==

===&quot;Al Riyadh&quot; class: Saudi Arabia===

The three &quot;Al Riyadh&quot;-class ships are an expanded anti-air version of the French &quot;La Fayette&quot; class, displacing about and extended to in length.

The ships&#x27; combat systems are produced by Armaris (a DCN/Thales joint venture) and are armed with the Aster 15 missile. The Aster missiles use the DCN SYLVER launcher. As with the &quot;La Fayette&quot; class the primary offensive weapon is the anti-surface Exocet missile. The ships&#x27; main gun is the Oto Melara 76 mm/62 Super Rapid gun replacing the 100 mm TR automatic gun. There are also four aft torpedo tubes. The ship is armed with the DCNS F17 heavyweight anti-submarine torpedo.

The ships are capable of a maximum speed of with a maximum range of .

===&quot;Formidable&quot; class: Singapore===
The Republic of Singapore Navy&#x27;s six s are of comparable size to the &quot;La Fayette&quot; class but differ from that class and the Saudi &quot;Al Riyadh&quot; class in the armament carried: in place of the Exocet is the Boeing Harpoon. The main gun is a stealth cupola equipped with an Oto Melara 76 mm gun replacing the 100 mm TR automatic gun. The &quot;Formidable&quot; class also uses the SYLVER launcher/Aster missile combination.

The first ship, RSS &quot;Formidable&quot;, was built by DCN, while the remaining ships were constructed by Singapore Technologies Marine.

Anti-submarine capability includes S-70B Seahawk helicopters.

Maximum speed is , making it the fastest variant. The ships have a maximum range of .

===&quot;Kang Ding&quot; class: Republic of China (Taiwan)===

As the Republic of China (Taiwan)&#x27;s defensive stance is aimed towards the Taiwan Strait, the Republic of China (Taiwan) Navy is constantly seeking to upgrade its anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The US$1.75 billion agreement with France in the early 1990s was an example of this procurement strategy: the six ships are configured for both ASW and surface attack. The Exocet was replaced by Taiwan-developed Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missile and the AAW weapon is the Sea Chaparral. The main gun is an Oto Melara 76 mm/62 mk 75 gun, similar to its Singaporean counterparts, the &quot;Formidable&quot;-class frigates. Some problems in the integration of Taiwanese and French systems had been reported. The frigate carries a single Sikorsky S-70C(M)-1/2 ASW helicopter.

In 2021 it was reported that the Republic of China (Taiwan) would upgrade the &quot;Kang Ding&quot; class. It was reported that the MIM-72 Chaparral surface-to-air missile defence system will be replaced by the indigenous Sky Sword II. It was also reported that the upgrade of the battle system will also be involved.

The class&#x27;s maximum speed is with a maximum range of .

The class&#x27;s Mk 75 main guns have been upgraded and have an improved firing rate of 100 rounds a minute.

<doc id="808049" wikidata="Q183245" url="?curid=808049" title="George Frederic Watts">
<text>George Frederic Watts (23 February 1817 – 1 July 1904) was a British painter and sculptor associated with the Symbolist movement. Watts became famous in his lifetime for his allegorical works, such as &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Love and Life&quot;. These paintings were intended to form part of an epic symbolic cycle called the &quot;House of Life&quot;, in which the emotions and aspirations of life would all be represented in a universal symbolic language.

==Early life and education==
Watts was born in Marylebone in central London on the birthday of George Frederic Handel (after whom he was named), to the second wife of a poor piano-maker. Delicate in health and with his mother dying while he was still young, he was home-schooled by his father in a conservative interpretation of Christianity as well as via the classics such as the &quot;Iliad&quot;. The former put him off conventional religion for life, while the latter was a continual influence on his art. He showed artistic promise very early, learning sculpture from the age of 10 with William Behnes, starting to study devotedly the Elgin Marbles (later writing &quot;It was from them alone that I learned&quot;) and then enrolling as a student at the Royal Academy Schools at the age of 18.

==Career==
===First exhibitions===
He first exhibited at the Academy in 1837, with a picture of &quot;The Wounded Heron&quot; and two portraits, but his attendance at the Academy was short-lived, and his further art education was confined to personal experiment and endeavour, guided by a constant appeal to the standard of ancient Greek sculpture. He also began his portraiture career, receiving patronage from his close contemporary Alexander Constantine Ionides, who later came to be a close friend.
===Westminster mural prize===
He came to the public eye with a drawing entitled &quot;Caractacus&quot;, which was entered for a competition to design murals for the new Houses of Parliament at Westminster in 1843. Watts won a first prize in the competition, which was intended to promote narrative paintings on patriotic subjects, appropriate to the nation&#x27;s legislature, securing a prize of £300. In the end Watts made little contribution to the Westminster decorations, but from it he conceived his vision of a building covered with murals representing the spiritual and social evolution of humanity.
===Italian travels===
The prize from the Westminster competition did, however, fund a long visit to Italy from 1843 onwards, where Watts stayed and became friends with the British ambassador Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland and his wife Augusta at their homes in Casa Feroni and the Villa Careggi in Tuscany. For them he painted a portrait of Lady Holland, exhibited in 1848, and in the villa a fresco, after making some experimental studies in that medium. Also while in Italy Watts began producing landscapes and was inspired by Michelangelo&#x27;s Sistine Chapel and Giotto&#x27;s Scrovegni Chapel. In 1847, while still in Italy, Watts entered a new competition for the Houses of Parliament with his image of Alfred the Great, &quot;Alfred Inciting the Saxons to Prevent the Landing of the Danes by Encountering them at Sea&quot;, on a patriotic subject but using Phidean inspiration.

===Return to Britain===
Leaving Florence in April 1847 for what was intended to be a brief return to London, he ended up staying. After obtaining a first-class prize of £500, his winning painting at the exhibition in Westminster Hall was purchased by the government, and was hung in one of the committee rooms of the House of Commons. It led, moreover, to a commission for the fresco of &quot;St George overcomes the Dragon,&quot; which, begun in 1848 and finished in 1853, formed part of the decorations of the Hall of the Poets in the Houses of Parliament.

Back in Britain he was unable to obtain a building in which to carry out his plan of a grand fresco based on his Italian experiences, though he did produce a 45 ft by 40 ft fresco on the upper part of the east wall of the Great Hall of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn entitled &quot;Justice, A Hemicycle of Lawgivers&quot; (completed 1859), inspired by Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The School of Athens&quot;. In consequence most of his major works are conventional oil paintings, some of which were intended as studies for the &quot;House of Life&quot;.

===Prinsep circle===
In his studio he met Henry Thoby Prinsep (for 16 years a member of the Council of India) and his wife Sara (née Pattle). Watts thus joined the Prinsep circle of bohemians, including Sara&#x27;s seven sisters (including Virginia, with whom Watts fell in love but who married Charles, Viscount Eastnor in 1850), and Julia Margaret Cameron. Previously staying at 48 Cambridge Street, and then in Mayfair, in 1850 he helped the Prinseps into a 21-year lease on Little Holland House, and stayed there with them and their salon for the next 21 years. (The building was the dower house on the Hollands&#x27; London estate in Kensington, near the house of Lord Leighton.)
===Productive painting period===
While the Lincoln&#x27;s Inn undertaking was still in progress, Watts was working steadily at pictures and portraits. In 1849 the first two of the allegorical compositions which form the most characteristic of the artist&#x27;s productions were exhibited—&quot;Life&#x27;s Illusions,&quot; an elaborate presentment of the vanity of human desires, and &quot;The people that sat in darkness,&quot; turning eagerly towards the growing dawn. In 1850 he first gave public expression to his intense longing to improve the condition of humanity in the picture of &quot;The Good Samaritan&quot; bending over the wounded traveller; this, as recorded in the catalogue of the Royal Academy, was &quot;painted as an expression of the artist&#x27;s admiration and respect for the noble philanthropy of Thomas Wright, of Manchester,&quot; and to that city he presented the work. From the late 1840s onward he painted many portraits in France and England, some of which are described below. Notable pictures of the same period are &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; (1862), &quot;Ariadne in Naxos&quot; (1863), &quot;Time and Oblivion&quot; (1864), originally designed for sculpture to be carried out &quot;in divers materials after the manner of Pheidias,&quot; and &quot;Thetis&quot; (1866).
===Teaching, further travels===
One of only two pupils Watts ever accepted was Henry&#x27;s son Valentine Cameron Prinsep; the other was John Roddam Spencer Stanhope — both remained friends, but neither became a major artist. While living as tenant at Little Holland House, Watts&#x27;s epic paintings were exhibited in Whitechapel by his friend the social reformer Canon Samuel Barnett, and he finally received a commission for the Houses of Parliament, completing his &quot;The Triumph of the Red Cross Knight&quot; (from &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;) in 1852–53. He also took a short trip back to Italy in 1853 (including Venice, where Titian became yet more of an inspiration) and with Charles Thomas Newton to excavate Halicarnassus in 1856–57, via Constantinople and the Greek islands. In 1856 Watts paid a visit to Lord Holland at Paris, where he was then ambassador, and through him made the acquaintance and painted the portraits of Adolphe Thiers, Jérôme Bonaparte and other famous Frenchmen. Apart from some visits to Italy, Greece and Egypt, the greater part of his subsequent life was passed in the seclusion of his home studios.
===Brief marriage===
In the 1860s, Watts&#x27;s work shows the influence of Rossetti, often emphasising sensuous pleasure and rich colour. Among these paintings is a portrait of his young wife, the actress Ellen Terry, who was 30 years his junior – having been introduced by mutual friend Tom Taylor, they married on 20 February 1864, just seven days short of her 17th birthday. They separated within a year of the wedding; Watts did not immediately divorce her, but made her allowance (paid to her father) conditional on her never returning to the stage.

===Later influences===
Watts&#x27;s association with Rossetti and the Aesthetic movement altered during the 1870s, as his work increasingly combined Classical traditions with a deliberately agitated and troubled surface, to suggest the dynamic energies of life and evolution, as well as the tentative and transitory qualities of life. These works formed part of a revised version of the &quot;House of Life&quot;, influenced by the ideas of Max Müller, the founder of comparative religion. Watts hoped to trace the evolving &quot;mythologies of the races [of the world]&quot; in a grand synthesis of spiritual ideas with modern science, especially Darwinian evolution.
===Later life===
With the lease on Little Holland House nearing its end and the building soon to be demolished, in the early 1870s he commissioned a new London home nearby from F. P. Cockerell: New Little Holland House (backing onto the estate of Lord Leighton), and acquired a house at Freshwater, Isle of Wight – his friends Julia Margaret Cameron and Lord Tennyson already had homes on the island. To maintain his friendship with the Prinsep family as their children began leaving home, he built The Briary for them near Freshwater, and adopted their relative Blanche Clogstoun. In 1877, his decree nisi from Ellen Terry finally came through, and the Grosvenor Gallery was opened by his friend Coutts Lindsay. This was to prove his ideal venue for the next ten years.

In 1886, at the age of 69, Watts remarried, to Mary Fraser Tytler, a Scottish designer and potter, then aged 36. In 1891 he bought land near Compton, south of Guildford, in Surrey. The couple named the house &quot;Limnerslease&quot; (combining the words &quot;limner&quot; or artist with &quot;leasen&quot; or glean) and built the Watts Gallery nearby, a museum dedicated to his work – the first (and now the only) purpose-built gallery in Britain devoted to a single artist – which opened in April 1904, shortly before his death, and received a major expansion between 2006 and 2011.

===Watts Mortuary Chapel===
Watts&#x27;s wife Mary had designed the nearby earlier Watts Mortuary Chapel, which Watts paid for; he also painted a version of &quot;The All-Pervading&quot; for the altar only three months before he died. Both Limnerslease and the chapel are now maintained, and the house owned, by the Watts Gallery. In 2016 Watts&#x27;s studio in the house re-opened, restored as far as possible using photographs from Watts&#x27;s lifetime, as part of the Watts Gallery, and the main residential section can be visited on a guided tour.

===Collections===
Many of his paintings are owned by Tate Britain – he donated 18 of his symbolic paintings to Tate in 1897, and three more in 1900. Some of these have been loaned to the Watts Gallery in recent years, and are on display there.
===Awards and honours===
Refusing the baronetcy twice offered him by Queen Victoria, he was finally elected as an Academician to the Royal Academy in 1867 and accepted to be one of the original members of the new Order of Merit (OM) in 1902 — in his own words, on behalf of all English artists. The order was announced in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and he received the insignia from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902.
===Late paintings===
In his late paintings, Watts&#x27;s creative aspirations mutate into mystical images such as &quot;The Sower of the Systems&quot;, in which Watts seems to anticipate abstract art. This painting depicts God as a barely visible shape in an energised pattern of stars and nebulae. Some of Watts&#x27;s other late works also seem to anticipate the paintings of Picasso&#x27;s Blue Period.
===Portraiture===
He was also admired as a portrait painter. His portraits were of the most important men and women of the day, intended to form a &quot;House of Fame&quot;. In his portraits Watts sought to create a tension between disciplined stability and the power of action. He was also notable for emphasising the signs of strain and wear on his sitter&#x27;s faces. Of his British subjects many are now in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery: 17 were donated in 1895, with more than 30 more added subsequently. Some who sat for him from the late 1840s were François Guizot (1848), Sir Henry Rawlinson, Sir Henry Taylor and Thomas Wright (1851), Lord John Russell (1852), Tennyson (1856, and again in 1859), John Lothrop Motley the historian (1859), the Duke of Argyll (1860), Lord Lawrence and Lord Lyndhurst (1862), James Parke, 1st Baron Wensleydale (1864), Gladstone (1858 and 1865), Sir William Bowman and Swinburne (1865), Anthony Panizzi (1866) and Dean Stanley in 1867. Other sitters included Charles Dilke, Thomas Carlyle, James Martineau, and William Morris.

===&quot;Physical Energy&quot;===

Although best known as a painter, Watts was also a sculptor. After completing a commission for the Duke of Westminster for an equestrian monument to commemorate his ancestor, Hugh Lupus, Watts set to work on a new plaster model of another horse and rider, without specific reference to any individual, in 1883. Seeking to reinvigorate the rhetoric of the equestrian monument for the modern age, he was still working on it at the time of his death in 1904. The plaster model was part of the artist&#x27;s bequest to Watts Gallery, and, also in 1904, the first bronze cast of the work (made in 1902 at the Parlanti Foundry) became the artist&#x27;s last submission to the Royal Academy&#x27;s summer exhibition. It marked a new prominence for the courtyard of Burlington House as a site for dramatic contemporary sculpture (a role continued today by the Annenberg Courtyard). &quot;Physical Energy&quot; then travelled to Cape Town to form part of a memorial to the founder of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Cecil Rhodes. In 1907, a posthumous cast was made and sited in Kensington Gardens, London, fulfilling the artist&#x27;s intention to gift the work to the British Government, insisting that it should be &quot;for the nation&quot; and displayed &quot;somewhere in London&quot;. A third cast, created in 1959, is situated in the grounds of the National Archives of Zimbabwe in Harare.

The culmination of Watts&#x27;s ambition in the field of public sculpture, &quot;Physical Energy&quot; is an allegory of human vitality and humanity&#x27;s ceaseless struggle for betterment; he said it was &quot;a symbol of that restless physical impulse to seek the still unachieved in the domain of material things&quot;. It also embodied the artist&#x27;s belief that access to great art would bring immense benefits to the country at large.

=== Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice ===
An admirer of royalty – he had painted Prince de Joinville and Edward, Prince of Wales – Watts proposed, in 1887, to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria by creating a Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice to commemorate ordinary people who had died saving the lives of others, and who might otherwise have been forgotten. The scheme was not accepted at that time, but in 1898 Watts was approached by Henry Gamble, the vicar of St Botolph&#x27;s Aldersgate church. He suggested the memorial could be created in Postman&#x27;s Park in the City of London.

The memorial was unveiled in an unfinished state in 1900, consisting of a 50-foot (15 m) wooden loggia designed by Ernest George, sheltering a wall with space for 120 ceramic memorial tiles to be designed and made by William De Morgan. At the time of opening, only four of the memorial tiles were in place. Watts died in 1904, and his widow Mary Watts took over the running of the project.

== Reception ==
Several reverent biographies of Watts were written shortly after his death; and one (by G. K. Chesterton) earlier in the year of his death. With the emergence of Modernism, however, his reputation declined. Virginia Woolf&#x27;s comic play &quot;Freshwater&quot; portrays him in a satirical manner, an approach also adopted by Wilfred Blunt, former curator of the Watts Gallery, in his irreverent 1975 biography &quot;England&#x27;s Michelangelo&quot;. In his 1988 book on Ruskin, the art critic Peter Fuller emphasised Watts&#x27;s spiritual and stylistic importance, also noting that late post-symbolist works such as &quot;The Sower of the Systems&quot; &quot;stretched beyond the brink of abstraction&quot;. On the centenary of his death Veronica Franklin Gould published &quot;G. F. Watts: The Last Great Victorian&quot;, a positive study of his life and work.

The composer Charles Villiers Stanford wrote his Sixth Symphony &quot;In Memoriam G. F. Watts&quot;. It was composed in 1905 and first performed on 18 January 1906 in London under Stanford&#x27;s direction. The four movements, although not having a detailed programme, are inspired by several works of art by Watts.

Literary references to Watts and his work include Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s 1953 novel &quot;Angel&quot;, where a picture by Watts is donated to a provincial museum by the protagonist, and mention of Watts&#x27;s painting &quot;Progress&quot; in &quot;Bella Donna&quot; by Robert Hichens (1909, p. 34). Watts features (not altogether favourably) as a character in Lynne Truss&#x27;s comic novel &quot;Tennyson&#x27;s Gift&quot; (1996).

<doc id="808076" wikidata="Q4585737" url="?curid=808076" title="1989–90 United States network television schedule">
<text>The 1989–90 network television schedule for the four major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers primetime hours from September 1989 through August 1990. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1988–89 season.

Beginning this season, Fox started their prime time expansion starting with Mondays.

This is the first season to feature entirely closed captioning programs on the Big Four networks.

This was the first time that two programs were tied for the no. 1 spot in the Nielsen ratings.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary.

New series are highlighted in bold.

All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

<text>Artemidorus Daldianus () or Ephesius was a professional diviner and dream interpreter who lived in the 2nd century AD. He is known from an extant five-volume Greek work, the &quot;Oneirocritica&quot; or &quot;Oneirokritikon&quot; ().

==Life and work==
Artemidorus was surnamed &quot;Ephesius&quot;, from Ephesus, on the west coast of Asia Minor, but was also called &quot;Daldianus,&quot; from his mother&#x27;s native city, Daldis in Lydia. He lived in the 2nd century AD.

According to Artemidorus, the material for his work was gathered during lengthy travels through Greece, Italy and Asia, from diviners of high and low station. Another major source were the writings of Artemidorus&#x27; predecessors, sixteen of whom he cites by name. It is clear he built on a rich written tradition, now otherwise lost. Artemidorus&#x27; method is, at root, analogical. He writes that dream interpretation is &quot;nothing other than the juxtaposition of similarities&quot; (2.25). But like other types of Greek divination, including astrology, celestial divination and pallomancy, Greek dream divination (Oneiromancy) became exceedingly complex, a given dream subject to a number of interpretations depending on secondary considerations, such as the age, sex, and status of the dreamer. At other times, subtle distinctions within the dream itself are significant. In a particularly memorable passage, Artemidorus expounds upon the meaning of dreams involving sex with one&#x27;s mother:

:The case of one&#x27;s mother is both complex and manifold and admits of many different interpretations—a thing not all dream interpreters have realized. The fact is that the mere act of intercourse by itself is not enough to show what is portended. Rather, the manner of the embraces and the various positions of the bodies indicate different outcomes. &quot;(Trans. Robert J. White)&quot;

There follows a lengthy and minute recitation of the divinatory significance of having sex with one&#x27;s mother in various sexual positions.

The first three books of the &quot;Oneirocritica&quot; are dedicated to one Cassius Maximus, usually identified with the rhetorician Maximus of Tyre, and were intended to serve as a detailed introduction for both diviners and the general public. Books four and five were written for Artemidorus&#x27; son, also named Artemidorus, to give him a leg-up on competitors, and Artemidorus cautions him about making copies.

According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Artemidorus also penned a &quot;Oiônoscopica&quot; (Οἰωνοσκοπικὰ) (Interpretation of Birds) and a &quot;Chiroscopica&quot; (Χειροσκοπικά) (Palmistry), but neither has survived, and the authorship is discounted. In the &quot;Oneirocritica,&quot; Artemidorus displays a hostile attitude to palmistry.

Among the authors Artemidorus cites are Antiphon (possibly the same as Antiphon the Sophist), Aristander of Telmessus, Demetrius of Phalerum, Alexander of Myndus in Caria, and Artemon of Miletus. The fragments of these authors, from Artemidorus and other sources, were collected by Del Corno in his &quot;Graecorum de re onirocritica scriptorum reliquiae&quot; (1969).

==Editions and translations==
*The definitive edition of the Greek text is by Roger Pack, &quot;Artemidori Daldiani Onirocriticon Libri V&quot; (Teubner 1963)

<doc id="808138" wikidata="Q1768704" url="?curid=808138" title="Rangitīkei River">
<text>The Rangitīkei River is one of New Zealand&#x27;s longest rivers, long.

Its headwaters are to the southeast of Lake Taupō in the Kaimanawa Ranges. It flows from the Central Plateau south past Taihape, Mangaweka, Hunterville, Marton, and Bulls, to the South Taranaki Bight at Tangimoana, southeast of Whanganui. The river gives its name to the surrounding Rangitikei District.

In 1897 the river flooded and all the bridges over it (Vinegar Hill, Onepuhi, Kakariki railway bridge and Bulls) were damaged or destroyed. Port of Rangitikei, at the mouth of the river was also washed away and never rebuilt. Other notable floods were in 1882, 1917, 1936, 1958, 1965 and 2004. Until 1908 a ferry linked Tangimoana to Scotts Ferry. Onepuhi, or Onepuehu, bridge was shown on the 1941 map, but missing from the 1968 and later maps. Further decking for the long Onepuhi bridge was suggested in 1958.

The river is a popular leisure and recreation area for jetboating, white water rafting, kayaking and fishing, and includes public camp grounds along its banks, including Vinegar Hill, New Zealand. Its sheer vertical &quot;paapa&quot; (clay) cliffs (unique to this part of New Zealand) and deep canyons provide the perfect setting for adventure activities such as bungy jumps and flying fox rides. The cliffs, which display oxygen isotope stages, have been incised into the soft Quaternary, 2.6 to 1.7 million year old, marine sediments as the land has risen since the last ice age. The rise has left 19 terraces, which have been mapped.

Part of the river was used as the Anduin River in Peter Jackson&#x27;s movie &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.

Both rainbow and brown trout throughout the river system with fish in the upper reaches reaching trophy size (i.e. over 4.5 kg) with the average through the rest of the system being around 1.5 to 2 kg. Fish numbers are good throughout the system though there are fewer fish per kilometre in the upper reaches. This is made up for by the quality and size of the fish being larger in this section.

==Springvale Suspension Bridge==
The Springvale Suspension Bridge crosses the Rangitīkei River on the Taihape–Napier Road (known as the Gentle Annie). It is located on the Ngamatea Plateau in the district of Ngamahanga, 41 km north–east of Taihape and 111 km west of Napier. It was built to support farming which increased in the inland Patea region after World War I and the need to transport stock and wool to the port at Napier. The bridge was designed by Rangitīkei County engineer Sydney Mair and built by William Salt. Construction commenced in 1923, the bridge opened in 1925 and it was known as the Rangitīkei Bridge or Erewhon Bridge after the name of the farming block. The name Springvale came from the nearby sheep farm. The bridge was replaced by the nearby Callender–Hamilton bridge in 1970 as it was no longer able to carry heavy trucks. As an early example of a suspension bridge with reinforced concrete towers its importance in engineering heritage was recognised by Heritage New Zealand designating it as a Category II historic site.

The bridge has a span of 61m supported by 7m high concrete towers at either end. The deck is made of wood and at 2.4m wide is a single lane.

<doc id="808161" wikidata="Q1171030" url="?curid=808161" title="Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium">
<text>Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium (Spanish: &quot;Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel&quot;) is a soccer-specific stadium located in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. It is best known as the former home of the Puerto Rico Islanders of the North American Soccer League and current home of the Bayamón FC of the Liga Puerto Rico. The stadium can seat up to 12,500 people. It can be publicly access by the metro station known as &quot;Deportivo Station.&quot;

==History==

Built in 1973 as a baseball stadium with a capacity of 12,500, it was home to the Vaqueros de Bayamón until 2003 when the team became defunct.

===La Meca of Puerto Rican Football===
In 2003 with the Vaqueros folding, the stadium seemed doomed to be relegated to a youth stadium or to demolition, but late that same year the stadium became home of the Puerto Rico Islanders. Its &quot;L&quot; shaped stands were not suited for the sport and it originally had an awkward feel to it since the stand behind the goal angles away from the pitch.

Another name that has been used for the stadium is &quot;La Islandera&quot; since it was the home of the Islanders.

It was home to Bayamon FC, a professional football team in the Puerto Rico Soccer League now playing in the Bayamon Soccer Complex, and Sevilla Bayamon FC, now called Sevilla-FC Juncos; they moved to Juncos.

It has also played host to the CFU Club Championship Group C in 2006, where the Islanders played but lost to Trinidad and Tobago, W Connection 0-1 and the Puerto Rico MLS-USL Challenge in 2007, and two 2010 World Cup qualifying matches against the Dominican Republic and Honduras.

====Renovation in 2012====
The renovations to the stadium have been made to upgrade a stadium created for baseball to be soccer-specific. The stadium will also have new dressing rooms and bathrooms and the replacement of some seating. There will also be some temporary bleachers until the addition for new seating is completed later. Lighting has also been adjusted to be more uniform across the field.

The remodeling of the stadium will be done in several stages, with a total cost of $7 million.
===A new team, a new home (2015–2017)===
In 2015, it was announced home to Puerto Rico FC of the North American Soccer League. The team played in the 2016 North American Soccer League season of Fall season.

===Hurricane damage to the stadium (2017)===
On September 22, 2017, the stadium was severely damaged by Hurricane Maria, which led to cancellations of the games and forced Puerto Rico FC to play the next same matches in neutral venues.

===2018-present===
The first match played after Hurricane María was a friendly match between Puerto Rico women&#x27;s national football team and Argentina on September 2, 2018.

On November 19, 2019, it was announced that Bayamón FC will be using the stadium for its home matches of the Liga Puerto Rico.

==Events==
The first boxing bout between Alfredo Escalera and Alexis Argüello dubbed The Bloody Battle of Bayamon, took place at the stadium on January 28, 1978.

On July 16, 1988, wrestler Bruiser Brody was fatally stabbed in the shower by fellow wrestler Jose Huertas Gonzalez.

On September 26, 1992 the heavy metal band Iron Maiden played on their Fear of the Dark Tour. This was the first time Iron Maiden visited Puerto Rico.
The popstar Madonna performed a sold out concert at the stadium on October 26, 1993 during The Girlie Show World Tour.

American pop-singer Michael Jackson planned to perform there in November 1993 as part of his Dangerous World Tour, but the concert was cancelled due to Jackson’s illness

The rock band Aerosmith performed there on January 28, 1994 during their Get a Grip Tour.

<text>François Ozon (; born 15 November 1967) is a French film director and screenwriter.

Ozon is considered one of the most important modern French filmmakers.
His films are characterized by aesthetic beauty, sharp satirical humor and a free-wheeling view of human sexuality. Recurring themes in his films are friendship, sexual identity, different perceptions of reality, transience and death.

Ozon has achieved international acclaim for his films &quot;8 femmes&quot; (2002) and &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; (2003). He is considered one of the most important directors in the new &quot;New Wave&quot; in French cinema, along with Jean-Paul Civeyrac, Philippe Ramos, and Yves Caumon, as well as a group of French filmmakers associated with a &quot;cinema du corps&quot; (&quot;cinema of the body&quot;).

== Life and career ==
Ozon was born in Paris, France. Having studied directing at the French film school La Femis, Ozon made several short films such as &quot;A Summer Dress&quot; (&quot;Une robe d&#x27;été&quot;, 1996) and &quot;Scènes de lit&quot; (1998). His motion picture directing debut was &quot;Sitcom&quot; (also 1998), which was well received by both critics and audiences.

After the Fassbinder adaptation &quot;Water Drops on Burning Rocks&quot; (&quot;Gouttes d&#x27;eau sur pierres brûlantes&quot;, 2000) came the film which made his name outside France, &quot;8 Women&quot; (&quot;8 femmes&quot;, 2002), starring Catherine Deneuve, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle Huppert and Emmanuelle Béart. With its quirky mix of musical numbers and murder mystery and a production design harking back to 1950s Hollywood melodramas such as those directed by Douglas Sirk, the film became a huge commercial success.

In 2003, &quot;Swimming Pool&quot;, starring Charlotte Rampling and Ludivine Sagnier, was released. Ozon considered it a very personal film that gives insight into the difficult process of writing a novel or screenplay.

In 2004 he directed the film &quot;5x2&quot;. His next film, &quot;Time to Leave&quot; (&quot;Le temps qui reste&quot;) (which one critic said explored the question &quot;how does a frivolous person deal with his own mortality?&quot;) screened at film festivals worldwide in 2005, and in 2006 it was distributed in the U.S.

Ozon&#x27;s first full English-language production, &quot;Angel&quot;, starring Romola Garai, was released in 2007. The film, based on a novel by British writer Elizabeth Taylor, follows the story of a poor girl who climbs Edwardian England&#x27;s social ladder by becoming a romance writer. The film was shot at Tyntesfield House and Estate near Bristol, at other UK locations and in Belgium.

While filming &quot;Angel&quot;, Ozon developed a strong friendship with Garai and called her his &quot;muse&quot;.

His film &quot;The Refuge&quot; had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2009.

Ozon was on the jury for the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival, held in February 2012.

His 2013 film &quot;Young &amp; Beautiful&quot; (&quot;Jeune &amp; Jolie&quot;) was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Ozon was voted best screenwriter at the 2013 European Film Awards for his 2012 film &quot;In the House&quot;.

His 2014 film &quot;The New Girlfriend&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2014.

His film &quot;Peter von Kant&quot;, a gender-flipped reinterpretation of Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot;, premiered at the 2022 Berlin Film Festival.

<text>The Ina () is a river in northwestern Poland, a right tributary of the Oder River.

The origins of the river are in Insko Lake (Polish: jezioro Ińsko), and it flows through a succession of smaller lakes. The confluence of Ina River is localized in Police town, near Szczecin. It has a length of 129 km, and the basin area of the Ina is 2189 km2.

The main towns situated on the Ina River are:
* Ińsko
* Goleniów
* Stargard with the famous Stargard Mill Gate
* Police, Poland (on the confluence of Ina River into the Oder)

In Pomeranian history, the Ihna from 1295 to 1464 separated Pomerania-Stettin and Pomerania-Wolgast. In the 16th century, it was one of the first European rivers to have its channel straightened, and was an important shipping artery up to WWII. Tributaries of the Ina are: Krępiel, Mała Ina, Reczek, Struga Goleniowska.

<doc id="808256" wikidata="Q667305" url="?curid=808256" title="Urticating hair">
<text>Urticating hairs or urticating bristles are one of the primary defense mechanisms used by numerous plants, almost all New World tarantulas, and various lepidopteran caterpillars. &quot;Urtica&quot; is Latin for &quot;nettle&quot; (stinging nettles are in the genus &quot;Urtica&quot;), and bristles that urticate are characteristic of this type of plant, and many other plants in several families. This term also refers to certain types of barbed bristles that cover the dorsal and posterior surface of a tarantula&#x27;s or caterpillar&#x27;s abdomen. Many tarantula species eject bristles from their abdomens, directing them toward potential attackers. These bristles can embed themselves in the other animal&#x27;s skin or eyes, causing physical irritation, usually to great discomfort. The term &quot;hairs&quot; is technically a misnomer, as only mammals possess true hairs. The scientific term for plant hairs is trichomes.

==In plants==
The most common form of urticating hairs in plants are typified by nettles, which possess sharp-pointed hollow bristles seated on a gland that secretes an acrid fluid. The points of these bristles usually break off in the wound, and the acrid fluid is pressed into it. Various plants unrelated to true nettles (&quot;Urtica&quot; species) possess similar defensive bristles, and the common names often reflect this (e.g. &quot;bull nettle&quot;).

Many cacti of the sub-family Opuntioideae feature fine, loosely attached short spines called glochids. When the plant is disturbed many of these spines fall off and penetrate the skin, causing irritation. Many glochidia are barbed, complicating their removal and enhancing their persistence in the skin. Exposure to glochidia is an occupational hazard to fruit pickers and other outside workers in areas where Opuntioideae thrive, as the spines can persist in clothing and gloves and can become airborne under the right conditions.

==In Lepidoptera==

Several lepidopteran families include species whose larvae bear urticating hairs. Families prominent in this respect include the following:
*Anthelidae
*Bombycidae
*Erebidae
*Eupterotidae
*Lasiocampidae
*Limacodidae
*Megalopygidae
*Noctuidae
*Notodontidae
*Nymphalidae
*Saturniidae
Adults of some species also have urticating scales, and some species shed some of their urticating hairs as defense for their pupae and eggs.

The urticating setae, or spines, can cause irritation when they break off and lodge in the skin of larger animals or humans. In some species, the setae are hollow, connecting to venom-producing cells, like a hypodermic needle. Generally, setae are only externally irritating, but may be more dangerous if contact is made with mucous membranes or if ingested; some can cause severe skin necrosis, eczema-like symptoms and shedding. Certain species of &quot;Lonomia&quot; (family Saturniidae) can inject venom that is life-threatening to humans.

Stings do not often occur as a defense, but are mainly the result of brushing against the spines. However, many species, whose larvae are armed with these bristles, have evolved to utilize them as a defense mechanism against any perceived threat. For example, many larvae in the family Lasiocampidae bear dense bands of short, stinging bristles across their thoracic segments. The bristles are normally retracted into folds in the skin, but, if the caterpillar is disturbed, it will display its bristles, which are usually of contrasting colors; in nature, bright and/or contrasting colors are used by many invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, fungi and plants as visual warnings for predators, indicating the presence of toxicity, venom or poison. The same defensive adaptation may also be seen as a &#x27;bluff&#x27; technique in certain harmless species, in which they mimic the appearance of a similar-looking, toxic, species as a means of protection. For example (in reptiles), the coral snakes (family Elapidae) are well-known as venomous, while the non-venomous milk snakes (Colubridae) appear visually very similar, utilizing mimicry to their advantage.

If roughly stimulated or held, lasiocampid larvae are likely to writhe and lash about, forcing the stinging bristles into any vulnerable surface they can. Many other species of larvae lack any such localized concentrations of bristles and are armed more generally with urticating hairs; even so, they too will lash about frantically if disturbed, making them difficult to handle without suitable equipment. Toxins from the broken bristles may spill out, causing dermatitis on the surface of the skin. For brown-tail moths (&quot;Euproctis chrysorrhoea&quot;) native to Europe and invasive in other parts of the world, bristles are shed or broken off during molts and can be wind-borne, so that direct contact with live or dead larvae is not required to trigger a rash.

In spite of such defenses, some species of birds feed avidly on &quot;hairy&quot; caterpillars, grabbing them in their beaks and scrubbing them on the ground until the majority of the bristles have been stripped or damaged; at least a few species of cuckoos, apparently, collect the bristles in their digestive tracts until they form &#x27;pellets&#x27; to be regurgitated. Examples of predators other than cuckoos that feed on &quot;hairy&quot; caterpillars include several reptiles and insectivorous mammal species, from several continents.

==In tarantulas==
Urticating hairs (setae) are found in about 90% of the species of tarantula (spiders of the family Theraphosidae) found in the New World. They are not found in tarantulas from other parts of the world.

===Development===
Urticating hairs do not appear at birth but form with each consecutive molt, widening from molt to molt and outwardly presenting themselves around areas of more dark bristles on the upper back part of the abdomen of juveniles. In elder ages their coloration shifts to match the main tone of abdomen. Despite this shift, urticating hairs nonetheless retain unique characteristics that render them visually distinct from abdominal bristles, such as their tendency to cover only a portion instead of the entirety of the opisthosoma.

===Types===
There are seven different types of urticating hair known in tarantulas, varying in size and shape, particularly the distribution of barbs.

* Type I (0.2–0.6 mm)
* Type II (0.5–1.5 mm)
* Type III (0.3–1.2 mm)
* Type IV (0.06–0.2 mm)
* Type V
* Type VI
* Type VII

Each type of urticating hair is believed to target different enemies. Defined targets for some bristle types are unknown.

Type II is usually not kicked off by the tarantula, rather delivered by direct contact. However, there is at least one aviculariine species—&quot;Caribena versicolor&quot;—which can kick type II urticating hairs off of the abdomen, similarly to species from the subfamily Theraphosinae. Tarantulas from the genera &quot;Avicularia&quot;, &quot;Pachistopelma&quot; and &quot;Iridopelma&quot; possess Type II hairs (Hoover, 1997). 

Type III urticating hairs are most efficient for defense against vertebrates and invertebrates. Types III and IV are the most irritating to mammalian predators.

===Types particular to species===

Not all urticating hair types are exhibited by each species of tarantula. Type II urticating hairs can be found in the genera &quot;Avicularia&quot;, &quot;Iridopelma&quot; and &quot;Pachistopelma&quot; (subfamily Aviculariinae). Type I and III urticating hairs are representative on a wide diversity of large bodied genera in the subfamily Theraphosinae: &quot;Lasiodora&quot;, &quot;Acanthoscurria&quot;, &quot;Nhandu&quot;, &quot;Megaphobema&quot;, &quot;Sericopelma&quot;, &quot;Eupalaestrus&quot;, &quot;Proshapalopus&quot;, &quot;Brachypelma&quot;, &quot;Cyrtopholis&quot;, and others, although some only have Type I in mature males. Unusually, Type III urticating hairs are found only on the species of &quot;Theraphosa&quot;, but these otherwise are similar to many species that also have Type I hairs.

Type III alone is found in many &quot;dwarf&quot; New World genera, e.g. &quot;Hapalopus&quot;. Type IV is found in several South American genera, e.g. &quot;Grammostola&quot;, &quot;Euathlus&quot; etc. (exhibits types III and IV). Type V urticating hairs are typical of the species of the genus &quot;Ephebopus&quot;. They are located on the pedipalps. They are much shorter and lighter in contrast with other types of urticating hair. These are easily thrown by the spider into the air. Type VI urticating hairs are found in the genus &quot;Hemirrhagus&quot;.

Genera with the most urticating hairs are &quot;Lasiodora&quot;, &quot;Grammostola&quot; and &quot;Acanthoscurria&quot;.

===Defensive behavior===
New World tarantulas will, at the moment of danger, turn toward the attacker and briskly rub their hind legs against the opisthosoma, throwing the urticating hairs in the direction of the enemy. The cloud of small bristles can get into the mucous membrane of small mammals and cause edema, which can be fatal. The bristles cause both mechanical and chemical harm to the skin and membranes.

Humans&#x27; reaction and the degree of irritation to a defensive urticating hair barrage can vary tremendously, based on the species in question. Some, such as those of the Chilean rose tarantula (&quot;Grammastola rosea&quot;) and the pinktoe tarantula (&quot;Avicularia avicularia&quot;), are fairly mild and innocuous to humans. Others, such as those of the Brazilian giant white knee tarantula (&quot;Acanthoscurria geniculata&quot;), are moderately irritating. Still others, such as the Goliath birdeater (&quot;Theraphosa blondi&quot;), are far more severe. These bristles can result in painful rashes, and have been likened to sharp shards of fiberglass.

After kicking urticating hairs, the tarantula will have a bald spot on its abdominal region.

===As territorial markings===
Urticating hairs are not just thrown at an enemy as a first line defense, but are also used as an indication of territory. They can be found on and around the burrow entrance and in webbing for protection (for example, some subfamily Theraphosinae species include these bristles in cocoon silk).

Urticating hairs protect tarantula egg sacs (&quot;Avicularia&quot; spp. and &quot;Theraphosa blondi&quot;, respectively). This is thought to discourage fly larvae from consuming their eggs and young.

==Human reactions==

In humans, urticating hairs can cause allergic skin reactions which can manifest as inflammation, rash and itching. The reactions can last from several hours to weeks. &quot;Ophthalmia nodosa&quot;, an irritation reaction, can result when the barbed bristles lodge in the cornea. Handlers are advised to wear eye protection.

<doc id="808290" wikidata="Q2667479" url="?curid=808290" title="Leucospermum">
<text>Leucospermum commonly known as pincushions, is a genus of evergreen upright, sometimes creeping shrubs that is assigned to the Proteaceae, with currently 48 known species.

The shrubs mostly have a single stem at their base, but some species sprout from an underground rootstock, from which the plant can regrow after fire has killed the above ground biomass. In a larger group of species, specimens are killed by fire, and their survival depends on the seeds. In all species, seeds are collected by ants, which take them to their underground nests to feed on their ant breads, a seed dispersal strategy known as myrmecochory. This ensures that the seeds do not burn, so new plants can grow from them.

&quot;Leucospermum&quot; species mostly have seated, simple, mostly leathery, often softly hairy leaves, set in a spiral, with entire margins or more often, with 3–17 blunt teeth with thickened, bony tips, and without stipules at their foot. The flowers are organised with many together in heads with bracts on the under- or outside. The hermaphrodite flowers themselves are set on a common base that may be cylindrical, conical or flat, and have small bracts at their base. The flowers have a perianth that is hairy on the outside, particularly at the tip, and consists of four tepals that are merged into a tube. Usually the four anthers are merged individually with the tip the perianth lobes, and only in a few species, a very short filament is present that further down cannot be distinguished from the tepals anymore. While still in the bud, the pollen is transferred from the anthers to the pollen-presenter, a thickening at the tip of the style. At that stage, the style grows considerably and rips through the sutures between the two perianth lobes facing away from the centre of the flower head. The perianth lobes all four remain attached to each other, or with three, or the four free lobes all curl back on themselves (like the lid of a sardine can), rimming the top of the tube. The superior ovary consists of one carpel and contains a single ovary, and is subtended by four small scales. The fruit is an oval or almost globe-shaped nut.

Most species have very limited ecological ranges and distribution areas, and many are rare or endangered. The often attractive, large flower heads and evergreen foliage, the straight stems, combined with long flowering period makes that &quot;Leucospermum&quot; species and their hybrids are bred as garden ornamental and cut flower.

== Description ==
Most pincushions are upright shrubs or even small trees of high, that usually have a single main stem. Some species however only have trailing branches and can form low mats, in diameter. Yet another set of species grow several stems directly from a rootstock in the ground. This is an important character in distinguishing between some species. Dried specimens of &quot;L. pedunculatum&quot; and &quot;L. prostratum&quot; can be difficult to distinguish, but although both are prostrate species, the growth habits in the field differ considerably. In &quot;L. pedunculatum&quot; many horizontally spreading branches develop from an about main stem, in &quot;L. prostratum&quot; the branches rise from an underground woody rootstock. The leaves are alternately set along the stem, distanced and slightly pointing towards the tip of the branch or overlapping, mostly without, sometimes with a leaf stalk but always without stipules at their base, long and linear, elliptic, oblanceolate, oval, inverted egg-shaped or spade-shaped, the edge entire or with up to 17 teeth towards the tip, hairless or with a covering of soft cringy one-celled hairs, sometime interspersed with longer straight silky hairs.

The flower heads are seated or have a short stalk, and grow individually in species with large heads or with two to ten together in species with smaller heads, in the axils of the leaves near the end of the branches. The general shape of the heads is a flattened, round, egg- or cone-shaped sphere of in diameter. The position not at the very tip of the branches helps to distinguish &quot;Leucospermum&quot; from related genera such as &quot;Diastella&quot;, while the more than one head per branch helps to distinguish the sections &quot;Diastelloides&quot; and &quot;Hamatum&quot; from the other sections. The involucral bracts are green in fresh specimens, and inconspicuous. They may have different shapes such as linear or ovate, with a sharp or pointed tip. In the majority of the species the involucral bracts have tough rubbery consistency and are usually softly hairy, overlapping and tightly pressed against the flower head. &quot; L. parile&quot;, &quot;L. tottum&quot; and &quot;L. vestitum&quot; on the other hand have thin, papery bracts. The common base of the flowers that jointly constitute a single flowerhead (called receptacle) varies considerably among species. It may be flat, globe-shaped, pointy conical or blunt cylindric. This character can best be seen by cutting a flower head lengthwise in two equal halves.

The individual flowers are subtended by a bract (or bracteole) that is wooly at its foot and softly hairy or hairless near the tip. Sometimes it grows on while the flower is in bloom and eventually becomes woody. While still in the bud, the perianth is a tube of long. When flowering, the perianth is yellow, orange, crimson, pink or white in color, straight or often curved towards the center of the flower head. The perianth consists of four tepals that are fused into a tube of either of uniform width or expanding towards the tip, but there are also a few species where it is inflated nearer the tip, such as in &quot;L. utriculosum&quot;, &quot;L. hamatum&quot; and &quot;L. harpagonatum&quot;. Above the tube, three of the lobes may become fused in a sheath, open towards the outside of the flower head, while the lobe facing the rim of the flower head is free. In the upper part of the perianth (or limbs) all four lobes may remain fused or only the three that remained already fused in the middle part. In the section &quot;Diastelloidea&quot; all four lobes are free in the upper parts and curl back forming a four-part rim around the top of the tube. The anthers differ little between species of &quot;Leucospermum&quot; and are usually fused with the tips of the perianth lobes, and filaments cannot be identified, but in the species that constitute the section &quot;Brevifilamentum&quot;, a filament of long makes the connection between the anther and the lobe. The buds are ripped open along a suture facing away from the center of the flower head by the style that grows in length quickly, eventually reaching a length of , straight or with a curve towards the center of the flower head, in diameter, often narrower nearer to the tip or thread-shaped, mostly identically colored as the perianth. The end of the style is (sometimes only slightly) thickened and holds the pollen that is transferred there just before the bud rips open. There is a considerable morphological variation in this so-called pollen presenter between species. The pollen presenter may be cylindric, oval, or conic in shape, either or not split in two lobes near the tip or oblique. The very tip has a groove that functions as the stigma that is centrally or oblique oriented. The finely powdery ovary is long, and gradually merges into the style base. It consists of one carpel and contains a single pendulous ovule. At the base of the ovary are four linear or awl-shaped scales of long that secrete a copious amount of nectar.

The indehiscent fruit consists of one cavity, containing one oval to globe-shaped seed of long, with a broad indent where it was attached, hairless or covered with a fine powder and generally partially covered by a pale elaiosome.

The sixteen &quot;Leucospermum&quot; species that have been analysed are all diploids having twelve sets of homologue chromosomes (2n=24), which is consistent with the rest of the subtribe Proteinae.

=== Differences with related genera ===
&quot;Leucospermum&quot; differs from genera such as &quot;Protea&quot;, &quot;Leucadendron&quot;, &quot;Mimetes&quot;, &quot;Diastella&quot;, &quot;Paranomus&quot;, &quot;Serruria&quot;, and &quot;Orothamnus&quot; by having the flower heads in the axils of the leaves (although often very near the tip of the branch), small and inconspicuous bracts subtending the head, brightly coloured styles that are straight or curve toward the center of the flower head and extend far from the perianth, giving the flower head the appearance of a pincushion, and large nut-like fruits covered by a pale and soft layer that attracts ants. The style breaks out of the bud at the side facing the rim of the head, and the perianth lobes may stick together with four or three forming a sheath, or roll back individually.

=== Sections ===
Currently, the genus is subdivided in nine sections based on morphological communalities and differences.

==== &quot;Brevifilamentum&quot; ====
The six species of the section &quot;Brevifilamentum&quot; are sometimes called showy pincushions, and include several horticultural species. The species all share a character that is unique in the genus &quot;Leucospermum&quot;: their anthers top a short, long filament that attach the anthers to the perianth, while in all other sections the anthers are directly fused with the limbs of the perianth lobes. The common base of the flowers in one head (or involucral receptacle) as can be seen by cutting lengthwise through a head is very narrowly conical with a sharp tip. The pollen presenter is egg-shaped, obliquely egg-shaped or hoof-shaped.

==== &quot;Cardinistyle&quot; ====
The six species that are assigned to the section &quot;Cardinistyle&quot; are sometimes called fireworks pincushions. They are all large upright shrubs, with only one main stem. The common base of the flowers is a narrow cone with a pointy tip. The flowers have styles of long that move downward when the flowers open, and are topped by a narrow pollen presenter ending in a sharp tip. &quot;L. reflexum&quot; has oval or narrowly oval greyish, felty leaves of long and wide. The perianth is yellow or scarlet long, and a style uniquely pointing downwards when the flower is open.

==== &quot;Conocarpodendron&quot; ====
The three species and one subspecies of the section &quot;Conocarpodendron&quot; are sometimes called tree pincushions. They are all small trees of up to high with a single trunk. The common base of the flowers in the same head is conical or narrowly conical with a pointy tip. The styles are long that carries a narrowly conical pollen presenter with a pointy tip. The bracts that subtend the flower heads are pointed and may have a hooked tip.

==== &quot;Crassicaudex&quot; ====
The four species assigned to the section &quot;Crassicaudex&quot; are sometimes called cylindric pincushions. These four all have a cylinder-shaped common base of the flowers in the same head. All are upright shrubs with several main stems that rise up from a woody rootstock underground. This makes the species very tolerant to fire. The leaves are wedge-shaped. All three species that occur outside the Cape Floral Region are assigned to this section.

==== &quot;Crinitae&quot; ====
The four species of the section &quot;Crinitae&quot; are sometimes called flat pincushions. They are upright or spreading shrubs. The involucral receptacle is always flat and in diameter with bowl-shaped flower heads. The lobes of the perianth remain erect after flowering and do not curl back as usual in other sections. The styles are thread-like and the flowers change color conspicuously when aging. &quot;L. saxatile&quot; is a creeper with wide leaves and lime-green flowers. &quot;L. gracile&quot; is also a prostrate shrub with 2–5 mm wide leaves, but its flowers are yellow. &quot;L. oleifolium&quot; has leaves 10 – 85 mm wide that are mostly entire but sometimes have up to five teeth, and with flowers that are pale yellow at first but become crimson with age. &quot;L. mundii&quot; is an upright shrub with two distinct populations, one with leaves 10 – 85 mm wide that have 7 - 17 teeth at their tip, flowers pale yellow aging to orange.

==== &quot;Diastelloidea&quot; ====
The species of the section &quot;Diastelloidea&quot; are sometimes called louse pincushions. They may be upright, spreading or creeping shrubs, that usually have sharply pointed leaves without teeth at the tip. The flowerheads are small and globe-shaped, mostly with two to six together very close to the tip of the branches, in diameter. The involucral receptacle is never flat. The style is long, topped by a club-shaped, cylindric or rounded conical pollen presenter. The colour of the flower changes when ageing, from cream to pink or from yellow to orange. All four perianth lobes curl back individually to form four small rolls surrounding the style, and these rolled lobes are said to resemble lice.

==== &quot;Hamatum&quot; ====
The species of the section &quot;Hamatum&quot; are sometimes called hook pincushions. Both species are trailing, mat-forming species with stiff, narrow, erect leaves and have small heads with between four and twelve flowers in one whorl. The perianth tubes are inflated towards the upper end and the styles are beset by very small teeth facing towards the base, strongly curved towards the center of the head, making the head reminiscent of a grappling hook. &quot;L. hamatum&quot; has linear leaves mostly with three teeth near the tip, a poorly developed or absent involucre, but four or five very large bracts forming a pseudo-involucre subtending the four to seven flowers per head. The perianth is hairless. &quot;L. harpagonatum&quot; has entire (narrowly) linear leaves, a well-developed involucre consisting of 25–35 bracts (subtending the flower head as a whole), eight to rarely twelve flowers per head, the perianth tubes densely wooly in the upper part.

==== &quot;Leucospermum&quot; ====
The species assigned to the section &quot;Leucospermum&quot; are sometimes called sandveld pincushions. Among it are both upright, spreading and creeping shrubs, and leaf-shapes vary from line- to egg- and wedge-shaped, but they all have felty hairy leaves, even when aged. The bud is usually straight, always with a sweet scent and colored brightly yellow. In the open flower, the three perianth lobes at the side of the center of the flower head remain attached, while the remaining lobe is free. The pollen presenter at the tip of the style is cylindrical or club-shaped.

==== &quot;Tumiditubus&quot; ====
The species assigned to the section &quot;Tumiditubus&quot; are sometimes called wide-tubed pincushions. All eight of them are erect or spreading shrubs with one main stem. All of them have a conical or wide-conical common base of the flowers within one head. The base of lowest, fully fused part of the flower (called tube) is narrow and gets wider towards the upper end.

== Taxonomy ==
The earliest known description from a species we now include in the genus &quot;Leucospermum&quot; was by Paul Hermann in &quot;Paradisus Batavus&quot;, a book describing the plants of the Hortus Botanicus Leiden (botanical garden of the Leyden University), that was published in 1689, three years after his death. He called it &quot;Salix conophora Africana&quot; (African cone-bearing willow), based on his observation of &quot;Leucospermum conocarpodendron&quot; on the lower slopes of the Table Mountain. In the following six decades, several other descriptions were published, such as by Leonard Plukenet, James Petiver, John Ray and Herman Boerhaave. Names published before 1753, the year that was chosen as a starting point for the binominal nomenclature proposed by Carl Linnaeus, are not valid however.

The first valid names were already created that very year with the publication of the first edition of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;, with the description of two species, &quot;Leucadendron conocarpodendron&quot; and &quot;Leucadendron hypophyllocarpodendron&quot; (now &quot;Leucospermum conocarpodendron&quot; and &quot;L. hypophyllocarpodendron&quot;) by Linnaeus. In 1763, Michel Adanson also described several Proteaceae species, and did so under the generic names &quot;Lepidocarpus&quot; and &quot;Conocarpus&quot;. Four more species were described, by Linnaeus (&quot;Protea pubera&quot; and &quot;P. totta&quot; in 1771, now &quot;L. calligerum&quot; and &quot;L. tottum&quot;), Peter Jonas Bergius (&quot;Leucadendron oleaefolium&quot; 1766, now &quot;Leucospermum oleifolium&quot;) and Nicolaas Laurens Burman (&quot;Leucadendron cuneiforme&quot;, now &quot;Leucospermum cuneiforme&quot;), before Carl Peter Thunberg in 1781 published a revision containing nine species now included in &quot;Leucospermum&quot;, including &quot;Protea heterophylla&quot; and &quot;P. tomentosa&quot; (now &quot;L. heterophyllum&quot; and &quot;L. tomentosum&quot;). Further species were added by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck: &quot;Protea vestita&quot; 1792 (now &quot;L. vestitum&quot;), Thunberg: &quot;P. prostrata&quot; in 1794 (now &quot;L. prostratum&quot;), Henry Cranke Andrews: &quot;Protea formosa&quot; 1798 (now &quot;L. formosum&quot;), and &quot;P. candicans&quot; in 1803 (now &quot;Leucospermum rodolentum&quot;) a later homonym of &quot;P. candicans&quot; (now &quot;Paranomus candicans&quot;), and in The Paradisus Londinensis by botanical illustrator William Hooker and botanist Richard Anthony Salisbury: &quot;Leucadendrum grandiflorum&quot; in 1808 (now &quot;Leucospermum grandiflorum&quot;).

Joseph Knight published a book in 1809 titled &quot;On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae&quot;, that contained an extensive revision of the Proteaceae attributed to Salisbury. Salisbury assigned twenty-four species to his new genus &quot;Leucadendrum&quot;, with newcomers &quot;Leucadendrum cordifolium&quot;, &quot;Leucadendrum gracile&quot;, &quot;Leucadendrum parile&quot;, &quot;Leucadendrum royenaefolium&quot;, &quot;Leucadendrum saxatile&quot; and &quot;Leucadendrum truncatulum&quot;, all of which are now included in &quot;Leucospermum&quot; with the identical species name. It is assumed that Salisbury had based his review on a draft he had been studying of a paper called &quot;On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae&quot; that Robert Brown was to publish in 1810. Brown however, called the genus &quot;Leucospermum&quot;, distinguished eighteen species and made the new combinations &quot;Leucospermum lineare&quot; and &quot;L. spathulatum&quot;. Salisbury&#x27;s names were ignored by botanists in favour of those that Brown had created, and this was formalised in 1900 when &quot;Leucospermum&quot; was given priority over &quot;Leucadendrum&quot;.

Johann Friedrich Klotzsch described &quot;L. pedunculatum&quot; in 1845. Carl Meissner, who contributed a section on the Proteaceae in 1856 to the series Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis by Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle, recognised twenty-three species, including seven new ones: &quot;L. gueinzii&quot;, &quot;L. mundii&quot;, &quot;L. reflexum&quot;, &quot;L. oleaefolium&quot; var. &quot;brownii&quot; (now &quot;L. bolusii&quot;), &quot;L. zeyheri&quot; var. &quot;truncatum&quot; (now &quot;L. truncatum&quot;), &quot;L. attenuatum&quot; var. &quot;praemorsum&quot; and var. &quot;ambiguum&quot; (now &quot;L. praemorsum&quot; and &quot;L. erubescens&quot;). Otto Kuntze revised the genus in 1891 and called it &quot;Leucadendron&quot;, a homonym of a name that had already been used by Linnaeus in 1753 for another group of Proteaceae, which have separate sexes and very large bracts. Edwin Percy Phillips newly described &quot;L. glabrum&quot; and &quot;L. muirii&quot; in 1910, Spencer Le Marchant Moore portrayed &quot;L. saxosum&quot; in 1911, while Otto Stapf added &quot;L. gerrardii&quot; in 1912. In 1912, Phillips and Otto Stapf revised &quot;Leucospermum&quot; and recognised thirty-one species. Afterwards, Phillips described &quot;L. cordatum&quot; (1923) and &quot;L. patersonii&quot; (1928). Robert Harold Compton added &quot;L. wittebergense&quot; in 1931 and &quot;L. catherinae&quot; in 1933. This was followed by &quot;L. arenarium&quot; by Hedley Brian Rycroft in 1959. John Patrick Rourke in 1970 distinguished 47 species, eight of which new to science: &quot;L. erubescens&quot;, &quot;L. fulgens&quot;, &quot;L. innovans&quot;, &quot;L. pluridens&quot;, &quot;L. praecox&quot;, &quot;L. profugum&quot;, &quot;L. secundifolium&quot; and &quot;L. utriculosum&quot;. He later added the newly discovered &quot;L. winteri&quot; in 1978, &quot;L. hamatum&quot; in 1983, and &quot;L. harpagonatum&quot; in 1994. Rourke erected several sections in 1970, among which &quot;Xericola&quot;, to which he assigned &quot;L. alpinum&quot; including a subspecies &quot;amoenum&quot;, &quot;L. obtusum&quot; including a subspecies &quot;albomontanum&quot;, as well as &quot;L. secundiflorum&quot;. In 1984, he erected a new genus &quot;Vexatorella&quot; to which he moved these taxa, with the exception of &quot;L. secundiflorum&quot;, that he included in the section &quot;Diastelloidea&quot;.

The name of the genus &quot;Leucospermum&quot; is compounded from the Greek words λευκός (leukos) meaning white, and σπέρμα (sperma) meaning seed, so &quot;white seed&quot;, which is a reference to the pale elaiosome surrounding the seeds. Species within the genus are commonly known as pincushions.

=== Phylogeny ===
Comparison of homologous DNA has increased the insight in the phylogenetic relationships between the Proteaceae. &quot;Leucospermum&quot; belongs to a group that further only consists of genera endemic to the Cape Floristic Region, that together constitute the subtribe Leucadendrinae. &quot;Leucospermum&quot; is most related to &quot;Mimetes&quot;, which however is only monophyletic if both &quot;Diastella&quot; and &quot;Orothamnus&quot; would be included in it. A subgroup of &quot;Paranomus&quot;, &quot;Vexatorella&quot;, &quot;Sorocephalus&quot; and &quot;Spatalla&quot; is the sister group to the &quot;Leucospermum&quot;-&quot;Mimetes&quot; subgroup. The following tree represents those insights.
=== Subdivision ===
The genus &quot;Leucospermum&quot; is divided into nine groups called sections. These are &quot;Brevifilamentum&quot;, &quot;Cardinistyle&quot;, &quot;Conocarpodendron&quot;, &quot;Crassicaudex&quot;, &quot;Crinitae&quot; (synonym &quot;Diastella&quot; ), &quot;Diastelloidea&quot;, &quot;Hamatum&quot;, &quot;Leucospermum&quot; (synonym &quot;Hypophylloidea&quot;) and &quot;Timiditubus&quot;.

The following taxa are assigned to the respective sections.
* Brevifilamentum: &quot;L. vestitum&quot; (type), &quot;L. cordatum&quot;, &quot;L. cordifolium&quot;, &quot;L. lineare&quot;, &quot;L. patersonii&quot;, &quot;L. tottum&quot;
* Cardinistyle: &quot;L. formosum&quot; (type), &quot;L. catherinae&quot;, &quot;L. grandiflorum&quot;, &quot;L. gueinzii&quot;, &quot;L. praemorsum&quot;, &quot;L. reflexum&quot;
* Conocarpodendron: &quot;L. conocarpodendron&quot; (type), &quot;L. glabrum&quot;, &quot;L. pluridens&quot;
* Crassicaudex: &quot;L. cuneiforme&quot; (type), &quot;L. gerrardii&quot;, &quot;L. innovans&quot;, &quot;L. saxosum&quot;
* Crinitae: &quot;L. oleifolium&quot; (type), &quot;L. gracile&quot;, &quot;L. mundii&quot;, &quot;L. saxatile&quot;
* Diastelloidea: &quot;L. calligerum&quot; (type), &quot;L. bolusii&quot;, &quot;L. heterophyllum&quot;, &quot;L. pedunculatum&quot;, &quot;L. prostratum&quot;, &quot;L. royenifolium&quot;, &quot;L. secundifolium&quot;, &quot;L. truncatulum&quot;, &quot;L. winteri&quot;, &quot;L. wittebergense&quot;
* Hamatum: &quot;L. hamatum&quot; (type), &quot;L. harpagonatum&quot;
* Leucospermum: &quot;L. hypophyllocarpodendron&quot; (type), &quot;L. arenarium&quot;, &quot;L. parile&quot;, &quot;L. rodolentum&quot;, &quot;L. tomentosum&quot;
* Tumiditubus: &quot;L. praecox&quot; (type), &quot;L. erubescens&quot;, &quot;L. fulgens&quot;, &quot;L. muirii&quot;, &quot;L. profugum&quot;, &quot;L. spathulatum&quot;, &quot;L. truncatum&quot;, &quot;L. utriculosum&quot;

=== Putative hybrids ===
In the field, sometimes few specimens are observed that are suspected to be interspecific hybrids, with characters that are intermediate between two clearly separate species. Wherever hybrids are observed in the wild, their origin 
is mostly quite clear because plants of the parent species grow nearby. The low number of such intermediate plants, suggests these hybrids are infertile. The following putative hybrids have been observed in gardens and in the field.

* &quot;L. hypophyllocarpodendron&quot; x &quot;L. pedunculatum&quot;
* &quot;L. hypophyllocarpodendron&quot; x &quot;L. calligerum&quot;
* &quot;L. mundii&quot; x &quot;L. calligerum&quot;
* &quot;L. truncatulum&quot; x &quot;L. prostratum&quot;
* &quot;L. truncatulum&quot; x &quot;L. gracile&quot;
* &quot;L. reflexum&quot; x &quot;L. catherinae&quot;
* &quot;L. conocarpodendron&quot; x &quot;L. cordifolium&quot;

Rourke suggested that &quot;L. tottum&quot; var. &quot;glabrum&quot; is probably the hybrid between &quot;L. tottum&quot; and &quot;L. vestitum&quot;. Many other hybrids have consciously been created and are propagated as ornamental or cut flower.

=== Reassigned species ===
The species that were originally described as, or moved to &quot;Leucospermum&quot; or one of its synonyms, which since have been reassigned include the following:

* &quot;L. alpinum&quot; subsp. &quot;alpinum&quot; = &quot;Vexatorella alpina&quot;
* &quot;L. alpinum&quot; subsp. &quot;amoenum&quot; = &quot;Vexatorella amoena&quot;
* &quot;L. glaberrimum&quot; = &quot;Leucadendron glaberrimum&quot; 
* &quot;L. involucratum&quot; = &quot;Leucadendron salignum&quot; 
* &quot;L. marginatum&quot; = &quot;Leucadendron spissifolium&quot;
* &quot;L. obtusatum&quot; = &quot;Vexatorella obtusata&quot;
* &quot;L. ovatum&quot; = &quot;Protea longiflora&quot;
* &quot;L. rochetianum&quot; = &quot;Faurea rochetiana&quot;
* &quot;L. zwartbergense&quot; = &quot;Leucadendron dregei&quot;
=== Names that cannot be assigned ===
For &quot;Leucadendron filiamentosum&quot;, &quot;L. polifolium&quot; and &quot;L. bellidifolium&quot;, no type specimens could be found, and their descriptions are too general to determine which &quot;Leucospermum&quot; species they are synonymous with. For &quot;L. obovatum&quot;, no description has been provided, so it is a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;.

== Distribution ==
Pincushions can only be found in a narrow zone from the southwestern Cape, along the Great Escarpment to eastern Transvaal and Eswatini, and two isolated areas, one in the Chimanimani Mountain range on the Zimbabwe-Mozambique border, and the other in Namaqualand. Only &quot;L. gerrardii&quot;, &quot;L. innovans&quot; and &quot;L. saxosum&quot; occur outside the Cape Floristic District. A remarkable concentration of 30% of the species occurs in a narrow strip of about long on the south coast between Hermanus and Witsand. Most of the individual species have restricted distributions, some as small as a few square km.

== Habitat ==
In the Cape, most &quot;Leucospermum&quot; species grow on acid soils that result from the weathering of Table Mountain Sandstone. More to the east a few species occur on eroded Witteberg quartzite, which is also very poor in nutrients. &quot;L. arenarium&quot;, &quot;L. fulgens&quot;, &quot;L. hypophyllocarpodendron&quot;, &quot;L. muirii&quot;, &quot;L. parile&quot;, &quot;L. praecox&quot;, &quot;L. rodolentum&quot; and &quot;L. tomentosum&quot; can only be encountered on deep white sands. A few other species like &quot;L. grandiflorum&quot;, &quot;L. guenzii&quot; and &quot;L. lineare&quot; can be found on the heavy clay that develops from Cape Granite. &quot;L. calligerum&quot; and &quot;L. heterophyllum&quot; sometimes grow on Malmsbury Gravel. On the other hand, &quot;L. patersonii&quot; and &quot;L. truncatum&quot; are specialists that only can be found on a ridge of limestone of the Alexandria Formation, parallel to the southern coast between Stilbaai and Danger Point.

== Ecology ==

=== Pollination ===
During flowering, the extended styles protrude far beyond the perianth tube. Initially, the tip of the style carries pollen at the thickened tip, that is called pollen-presenter. The pollen is brushed on the heads and bodies of the birds, mammals and large insects that try to reach the copious and thick nectar that fills the perianth tube. In older flower heads of &quot;Leucospermum&quot; most of the pollen will have been transferred to the bodies of earlier pollinators, and a small groove at the very tip of the style opens. In most &quot;Leucospermum&quot; species, plants are entirely infertile to their own pollen. Even a small amount of pollen of other specimens of the same species results in the development of the seed. The flowerheads are also visited by many small insects that are unlikely to pollinate &quot;Leucospermum&quot;, but the birds eat insects in addition to nectar. The birds&#x27; nesting season coincides with the flowering season of &quot;Leucospermum&quot; and both for egg-laying and growing chicks, a large quantity of proteine is needed, where nectar provides hardly any. The Cape sugarbird seems to be present in all stands of non-creeping &quot;Leucospermum&quot; species, but the malachite sunbird &quot;Nectarinia famosa&quot;, southern double-collared sunbird &quot;Cinnyris chalybeus&quot; and orange-breasted sunbird &quot;Anthobaphes violacea&quot; are locally also important pollinators. Red-winged starling &quot;Onychognathus morio&quot; and Cape weaver &quot;Ploceus capensis&quot; are occasional visitors that damage the perianth tube to extract the nectar, and are probably much less effective pollinators. Large monkey beetles, like &quot;Trichostetha fascicularis&quot;, &quot;T. capensis&quot;, &quot;T. albopicta&quot;, and &quot;Anisonyx ursus&quot; can for a time be feeding on &quot;Leucospermum&quot; nectar in large numbers, and do transport pollen on their long hairs. These are however only present during a few weeks each year, and likely less important pollinators than the birds. Several rodents may be responsible for the pollination of species that produce their flower heads at ground level. Hairy-footed gerbils &quot;Gerbillurus paeba&quot;, and striped field mice &quot;Rhabdomys pumilio&quot; were observed to visit the flowers of &quot;L. arenarium&quot;, and both carried its pollen on forehead and breast. &quot;L. arenarium&quot; nectar is thick and is present at the tips of the perianth lobes. Here, mice can lick it off without having to damage the flowers. The nectar is produced by the scales subtending the ovary as in other &quot;Leucospermum&quot; species, but is transported by capillary ducts to the tips of the perianth.

=== Seed dispersal ===
The fruits of &quot;Leucadendron&quot; have but one seed cavity, that does not open, and contains only one seed, a fruit type called nut. The fruits consist partly of a whitish, fleshy or gelatinous pericarp, a so-called elaiosome, that attracts ants because they contain chemicals that mimic pheromones. After the fruits fall from the plant, mostly &quot;Anoplolepis&quot; ants gather them, and carry them to their nest by sinking their jaws in the fleshy elaiosome. Once in the underground nests, the elaiosome is consumed. The smooth and hard seeds that remain do not fit the ants&#x27; small jaws, and are abandoned, protected from fire and seed eaters. The survival of the seeds is further enhanced by fungicidal and anti-bacterial substances that the ants excrete to keep their nests in a healthy condition. In the fynbos, this so-called myrmecochory is a strategy used by many plant species to survive the fire. Invasive ants species, like in South Africa &quot;Linepithema humile&quot; (Argentine ant), destroy the nests of the indigenous ants, and eat the elaiosomes where ever the seed has fallen, so that it is not protected against fire and can easily be found and eaten by mice and birds.

=== Fire ===
Periodic wildfires are an important factor in south and west South Africa. The occurrence of these fires among other things determines the extent of fynbos. All species that naturally occur in the fynbos have adaptations that ensure these species can survive the natural fire regime, but different species have different strategies. This is also true for the species of &quot;Leucospermum&quot;, even the few that occur outside the fynbos. A large majority of &quot;Leucospermum&quot; species is killed by fire because these have a single stem that only branches higher up, and are covered by a rather thin bark. One year after the fire however, many seedlings have occurred. All specimens within the area covered by the most recent fire, are therefore of the same age. After three to four years, these plants begin to flower and produce seeds, that do not yet germinate, but remain in the soil seed bank, until they get activated during the aftermath of a fire. Specimens belonging to these species are subject to biological aging (or senescence), and lose their vitality. The maximum life expectancy differs between twenty-five to thirty years in smaller species like &quot;L. truncatulum&quot; and &quot;L. oleifolia&quot;, to fifty to eighty years in &quot;L. praemorsum&quot;. For this group of species, fire is a prerequisite to rejuvenate and so maintain the population. If the fires occur as frequent as every two or three year however, the soil seed bank gets depleted because no new seeds are added, and the species may locally disappear. A number of large species (&quot;L. conocarpodendron&quot;, &quot;L. heterophyllum&quot;, &quot;L. patersonii&quot;, &quot;L. pedunculatum&quot;, &quot;L. profugum&quot; and &quot;L. royenifolium&quot;) have thick bark, which allows them to survive fires if these are not too intense, and so stretch their lifespan regularly beyond the interval between successive incidents. The fire survival rate in this group was estimated at 30–50 %. Since the fire destroys lower branches, regrowth only takes place from the higher branches, and the plants attain an umbrella-shape. A smaller group of &quot;Leucospermum&quot; species has a more effective method to survive fire. Above ground parts of these species die, but new shoots appear directly from the ground from woody tubers. This mechanism is best developed in the species of the section &quot;Crassicaudex&quot; (&quot;L. cuneiforme&quot;, &quot;L. gerrardii&quot;, &quot;L. innovans&quot; and &quot;L. saxosum&quot;) that mostly occur outside the fynbos, in areas with dominant summer rainfall where fires may be more frequent, but is also present in &quot;L. hypophyllocarpodendron&quot;, &quot;L. prostratum&quot; and &quot;L. tomentosum&quot;. The survival rate in this group is estimated at 95% or more. The young plants of these species can be distinguished because of the profuse development of side branches very low on the primary stem.

== Conservation ==
There are 48 species, two of which having two subspecies each. Two others have two varieties each. The survival of eight is considered to be of least concern: &quot;L. calligerum&quot;, &quot;L. cuneiforme&quot;, &quot;L. oleifolium&quot;, &quot;L. pedunculatum&quot;, &quot;L. royenifolium&quot;, &quot;L. truncatum&quot;, &quot;L. utriculosum&quot; and &quot;L. wittebergensis&quot;. Twelve taxa are regarded as near-threatened: &quot;L. bolusii&quot;, &quot;L. conocarpodendron&quot; subsp. &quot;viridum&quot;, &quot;L. cordifolium&quot;, &quot;L. gerrardii&quot;, &quot;L. gracile&quot;, &quot;L. pluridens&quot;, &quot;L. reflexum&quot; (its two varieties have not been evaluated), &quot;L. spathulatum&quot;, &quot;L. tottum&quot; var. &quot;tottum&quot;, &quot;L. truncatulum&quot;, &quot;L. vestitum&quot; and &quot;L. winteri&quot;. Three species are rare: &quot;L. erubescens&quot;, &quot;L. mundii&quot; and &quot;L. secundifolium&quot;. Nine taxa are regarded as vulnerable: both subspecies of &quot;L. hypophyllocarpodendron&quot;, &quot;L. lineare&quot;, &quot;L. patersonii&quot;, &quot;L. praecox&quot;, &quot;L. praemorsum&quot;, &quot;L. prostratum&quot;, &quot;L. rodolentum&quot; and &quot;L. tomentosum&quot;. Fifteen have been categorised as endangered species: &quot;L. catharinae&quot;, &quot;L. conocarpodendron&quot; subsp. &quot;conocarpodendron&quot;, &quot;L. cordatum&quot;, &quot;L. formosum&quot;, &quot;L. glabrum&quot;, &quot;L. grandiflorum&quot;, &quot;L. gueinzii&quot;, &quot;L. hamatum&quot;, &quot;L. heterophyllum&quot;, &quot;L. innovans&quot;, &quot;L. muirii&quot;, &quot;L. parile&quot;, &quot;L. profugum&quot;, &quot;L. saxatile&quot; and &quot;L. saxosum&quot;. Finally, four taxa are thought to be critically endangered: &quot;L. arenarium&quot;, &quot;L. fulgens&quot;, &quot;L. harpagonatum&quot; and &quot;L. tottum&quot; var. &quot;glabrum&quot;.

== Cultivation ==
The breeding of pincushions provides an important export product in South Africa and a few other countries. &quot;L. conocarpodendron&quot;, &quot;L. cordifolia&quot;, &quot;L. lineare&quot;, &quot;L. patersonii&quot; and &quot;L. vestitum&quot; and a range of hybrids supply cut flowers.

<text>A group is a military unit or a military formation that is most often associated with military aviation.

== Air and aviation groups ==
The terms group and wing differ significantly from one country to another, as well as between different branches of a national defence force. Air groups vary considerably in size and status, but generally take two forms:
* A unit of two to four squadrons, commanded by a lieutenant colonel, colonel, commander, naval captain or an equivalent rank. The United States Air Force (USAF), &quot;groupes&quot; of the French &quot;Armée de l&#x27;air&quot;, &quot;gruppen&quot; of the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, United States Marine Corps Aviation, British Fleet Air Arm and some other naval air services usually follow this pattern.
* A larger formation, often comprising more than 10 squadrons, commanded by a major general, brigadier general, commodore, rear admiral, air commodore or air vice-marshal. The air forces of many Commonwealth countries, such as the British Royal Air Force (RAF), follow this pattern. In such cases, the group is equivalent to a US wing, a German &quot;Geschwader&quot; or a French &quot;escadron&quot;.

== Historical overview ==
During the early stages of World War I in France and Germany, the respective aviation services formed &quot;groupes&quot; and &quot;Gruppen&quot;. Beneath the level of the group was a unit of six to 16 aircraft: an &quot;escadrille&quot; or &quot;Staffel&quot;. Immediately above the French and German groups was the &quot;escadron&quot; or &quot;Geschwader&quot;. In the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), a squadron was usually composed of 18–24 aircraft.

When the Royal Air Force (RAF) was formed in 1918 from a merger of the RFC and RNAS, an officer with the rank of colonel typically commanded a group. The following year, when the RAF introduced its own rank system, RAF colonels became group captains, reflecting both the level of command responsibility and the seniority of naval captains (the equivalent Royal Navy rank).

By World War II, the &quot;groupes&quot; of the French &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; usually comprised two &quot;escadrilles&quot; (but sometimes only one, or as many as four). French &quot;groupes&quot; were the equivalent of U.S. Army Air Corps (USAAC)/U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) groups (analogous to RAF wings), while a &quot;groupement&quot; was the equivalent of a RAF group (USAAC/USAAF wing). For example, in May 1940 the &quot;Groupe de Bombardement I/31&quot;, a bomber unit, was operationally part of &quot;Groupement de Bombardement 6&quot;.

In the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, the principal unit of action was the &quot;Gruppe&quot; (plural &quot;Gruppen&quot;); the equivalent of a French or USAAC/USAAF group. &quot;Gruppen&quot; were part of a &quot;Geschwader&quot; (equivalent to a USAAC/USAAF wing or an RAF group) and the &quot;Geschwader&quot; were named according to their function. For instance, I./StG 77 was &quot;I Gruppe Sturzkampfgeschwader 77&quot;, which flew Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers. II./JG 26 was &quot;II Gruppe Jagdgeschwader 26&quot;, which flew Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters, then switched to Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters. Each &quot;Gruppe&quot; was composed of three, sometimes four, &quot;Staffeln&quot; (singular &quot;Staffel&quot;) (usually 8–12 aircraft). Each &quot;Geschwader&quot; was composed of three &quot;Gruppen&quot;.

By the time of World War II, some Commonwealth air force groups were commanded by air commodores (equivalent to brigadiers/brigadier generals and commodores) or even air vice-marshals (equivalent to major generals and rear admirals). They were somewhat analogous to a USAAF numbered air force (led by a brigadier general), with 200 to 400 aircraft. From 1943 to 1945, RAF Bomber Command groups were composed of several stations (air bases) and were analogous to USAAF wings.

== Commonwealth nations ==
In the RAF (like the air forces of most other Commonwealth countries), a group is made up of several stations or wings, each of which typically controls two or more squadrons, so that a group normally includes six to 10 squadrons.

When the ranks of the RAF were designed, an officer with the rank of group captain (equivalent to colonel and naval captain) commanded such a unit, although by the time of World War II, many groups were commanded by air commodores (equivalent to brigadiers/brigadier generals and commodores) or air vice-marshals (equivalent to major generals and rear admirals).

Several RAF stations (air bases) are controlled by a particular group, although expeditionary air groups control expeditionary air wings directly. Groups are directly subordinate to a command (or, historically, to a tactical air force).

In the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm, like some other Commonwealth naval air services, a group usually consists of two or three squadrons.

== United States ==

=== US Air Force ===
In the United States Air Force (USAF) a group consists of two or more squadrons, often functionally aligned within a wing. Per AFI 38-101 Air Force Organization (21 April 2015) a group is a &quot;level of command between wings and squadrons. Groups bring together multiple squadrons or other lower echelon units to provide a broader capability.&quot;

Prior to 1991, it was not unusual for a USAF support group to have no subordinate squadrons, but merely be a larger unit than a squadron. In such cases the group would not have a headquarters.

USAF groups may be dependent or independent: &quot;A dependent group is a mission, maintenance, mission support, medical, or large functional unit (e.g., security forces, special tactics, communications, etc.) that encompasses a number of related squadrons to provide the specified capability to a parent wing. Such groups may possess small supporting staff elements, such as standardization and evaluation or quality control, that are organized as sections.&quot; &quot;An independent group has the same functions and responsibilities as a like-type wing but its scope and size do not warrant wing-level designation and associated overhead costs.&quot; A group requires at least 400 personnel, while a wing requires at least 1,000. A fighter wing, for example, is normally composed of dependent groups: an operations group of typically three flying squadrons and an operations support squadron and a maintenance group with aircraft, equipment, and component maintenance squadrons and a maintenance support squadron.

Wings responsible for an air base also have other dependent groups such as a mission support group (security, communications, logistics support, mission support, and civil engineering squadrons) and a medical group. The dependent group commanders are considered to be in command billets, but they function like staff officers (the A3/S-3/G-3/J3 or the A4/S-4/G-4/J4) in other organizations. Independent groups are effectively small wings with both flying and maintenance squadrons. USAF groups are usually commanded by officers in the grade of OF-5 (US pay grade O-6), i.e., a full colonel. Wings are also usually commanded by officers in the grade of OF-5, but these are typically more senior colonels by virtue of time in grade and/or date of rank. Some USAF wings are also commanded by officers in the grade of OF-6 (US pay grade O-7), i.e., a brigadier general.

=== US Marine Corps Aviation ===
In the United States Marine Corps, a Marine Aircraft Group (MAG), Marine Air Control Group (MACG) or Marine Aviation Training Support Group (MATSG) is a regimental-level unit within United States Marine Corps Aviation, equivalent to a USAF wing. A MAG consists of at least two air aircraft squadrons and two aviation support squadrons; two or more MAGs and a MACG form a Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW).
Marine Aircraft Groups consist of two or more aircraft squadrons (usually four to six) and can range to as many as ten (see MAG-14). A MAG also contains a Marine Aviation Logistics Squadrons (MALS) (intermediate aircraft maintenance, aviation supply, and aviation ordnance support), a Marine Wing Support Squadron (MWSS) (air base functions), and a MAG headquarters detachment with a colonel as the commanding officer. The MAG is the organizational equivalent of a Marine Regiment.

Marine Air Control Groups (MACG) consist of several aviation command, control, communications, and air defense units. These units include: a Marine Air Control Squadron (MACS) (control of air traffic and tactical air defense), a Marine Air Support Squadron (MASS) (control and coordination of tactical aircraft operations directly supporting ground forces), a Marine Tactical Air Command Squadron (MTACS) (command of tactical ground support and tactical air defense), a Marine Wing Communication Squadron (MWCS) (wire, radio, data, and satellite services), and a Low Altitude Air Defense (LAAD) (ground-based anti-aircraft missile and machinegun weapons) battalion/detachment, under a MACG headquarters detachment, commanded by a colonel.

Marine Air Training Support Groups (MATSG) provide administrative control and training support at for Marines at formal naval aviation training units (e.g., combined USN/USMC Fleet Readiness Squadrons (FRS) and Naval Air Training Command and Naval Air Technical Training Command installations). These groups, commanded by a colonel, do not have subordinate squadrons assigned and are not part of the Fleet Marine Force (FMF).

Two or more MAGs (usually three or four), and a MACG, under a Marine Aircraft Wing Headquarters (MAW HQ) supported by a Marine Wing Headquarters Squadron (MWHS) form a Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), usually commanded by a major general, and is the FMF organizational equivalent of a Marine Division (MARDIV). The MAW is analogous to a USAF numbered air force or a British Royal Air Force (RAF) group.

=== US Navy aviation ===
All the aircraft on a United States Navy (USN) aircraft carrier, historically, were called the carrier air group regardless of whether the total was 72–90 on a fleet carrier or 20 to 30 on an escort carrier. Even today, the commander of the carrier air wing is traditionally called &quot;CAG,&quot; a legacy title from when they were known as &quot;commander, air group.&quot;

A USN aviation wing is designated as either carrier air, maritime patrol &amp; reconnaissance, strategic communications, training air, or type (there are type wings for strike fighters, electronic warfare, airborne early warning and logistics, maritime strike helicopter, and sea combat helicopters that provide squadrons to the carrier air wing for operations, as well as shore based fleet logistics support and tactical support wings that operate independently of aircraft carriers). All of these entities maintain administrative and standardization control and are OF 5 (US pay grade O-6) captain commands roughly analogous to a USMC Marine Aircraft Group or USAF wing. Officers in command of wing level units other than carrier air wings utilize the legacy title of &quot;commodore&quot; and are authorized to fly a command broad pennant from their headquarters ashore or when embarked aboard a warship as the senior officer present afloat (SOPA).

Group is no longer a contemporary term in the USN portion of Naval Aviation except for that of the tactical air control group. This entity uses &quot;group&quot; in lieu of &quot;wing&quot; as a legacy title and is also an OF 5 (US pay grade O-6) captain command analogous to a USMC Marine Aircraft Group, Marine Air Control Group, or USAF wing in which the incumbent senior officer also utilizes the title of &quot;commodore&quot; while in command.

The immediate superior of a carrier air wing commander (CAG) is the flag officer who is the carrier strike group commander, a surface or aviation rear admiral in the grade of OF 6 or 7 (US pay grade O-7 or O-8), with a mixed air, surface, and subsurface staff, who integrates four major USN (OF 5) (US pay grade O-6) commands – a carrier air wing, an aircraft carrier, one or more cruisers, a destroyer squadron, and an attached attack submarine – into a coherent air, surface and subsurface fighting force.

The commodores of the other USN aviation organizations will also report to similar rank flag officers, e.g., patrol &amp; reconnaissance wing commodores reporting to the commander, Patrol and Reconnaissance Group (COMPATRECONGRU); training air wing commodores reporting to the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA); tactical air control group commodore reporting to an expeditionary strike group (ESG) commander, etc.

==== Patrol and reconnaissance group ====
A patrol and reconnaissance group (PATRECONGRU) consists of two or more patrol and reconnaissance wings under the command of a flag officer at the OF6 (US pay grade O-7) level.

=== United States Army Aviation Branch ===
In the United States Army Aviation Branch, a group is a term that has, historically, been used interchangeably with combat aviation brigade or air division.

==Naval groups==

===US Navy Carrier Strike Group (CSG)===
A CSG usually consists of one aircraft carrier with an embarked carrier air wing, one or two guided missile cruisers, a destroyer squadron of two or three guided missile destroyers, one or two attack submarines, and a logistics support ship, all under the command of an embarked flag officer at the OF6 (US pay grade O-7) or OF7 (US pay grade O-8) level.

==Groups in armies ==
Within armies and land forces, groups are units or formations that are roughly equivalent to regiments and are commanded by colonels. Groups should not be confused with army groups which are multiple armies commanded by a general or field marshal.

=== British Army ===
Many group-sized formations have existed throughout the modern history of the British Army, especially post-Second World War. For instance, following the radical 1966 Defence White Paper, several signal groups were formed, such as the 1st Signal Group, 2nd Signal Group (Static Communications Network), and 3rd Signal Group. These formations were all commanded by a Colonel. Since 2012, several colonel sized groups have been formed, including: 7th Air Defence Group and 29th Pre-Hospital Divisional Medical Group.

===Canadian Army===
By the late 1980s, the doctrinal Canadian Army division organized manoeuvre forces into brigades while division level combat support and combat service support was organized into groups. The doctrinal division would have had an artillery group, an engineer group, and a support group. Present day Canadian Army divisions each contain a division support group commanded by a colonel.

===Indonesian Army===

In the Indonesian Army, the Special Forces Command (Kopassus) uses this term to identify the different divisions within the unit. Each &quot;Group&quot; consists of a total of about 1000 personnel from several battalions. 

=== United States Army ===
In the United States Army, certain non-aviation formations (e.g., currently the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne)&#x27;s Special Forces Groups and PSYOP Groups and formerly some Air Defense Artillery, Armored Cavalry, Combat Engineer, Field Artillery, Military Intelligence, Military Police, and Signal Corps units) are/were also organized into groups, vice brigades or regiments. These units are/were generally smaller than brigades, usually consisting of from two to four battalions/squadrons (armored cavalry only), separate companies/batteries (air defense and field artillery)/troops (armored cavalry only), and/or detachments.

<text>The Ingrian War () was a conflict fought between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia which lasted between 1610 and 1617. It can be seen as part of Russia&#x27;s Time of Troubles, and is mainly remembered for the attempt to put a Swedish duke on the Russian throne. It ended with a large Swedish territorial gain (including Ingria) in the Treaty of Stolbovo, which laid an important foundation to Sweden&#x27;s Age of Greatness.

== Prelude ==
During Russia&#x27;s Time of Troubles, Vasily IV of Russia was besieged in Moscow by the supporters of the False Dmitry II. Driven to despair by the Polish intervention, he entered into an alliance with Charles IX of Sweden, who was also waging war against Poland. According to the Vyborg Treatise of 1609, the tsar promised to cede Korela Fortress to Sweden in recompense for military support against False Dmitry II and the Poles. Russia also renounced all territorial claims on the coast of the Baltic Sea coast. The Swedish commander Jacob De la Gardie joined his forces with the Russian commander Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky and marched from Novgorod towards Moscow in order to relieve the tsar. In May, the De la Gardie campaign began, where the Swedish corps fought as part of the army of Skopin-Shuisky, who managed to clear a significant part of Russia from the interventionists.

Sweden&#x27;s involvement in Russian affairs gave King Sigismund III Vasa of Poland a pretext to declare war on Russia. After the sudden death of Skopin-Shuisky, De la Gardie&#x27;s troops were united with Shuisky&#x27;s army, and the Poles defeated the combined Russo-Swedish force at the Battle of Klushino on . The Swedish mercenaries taking part in the De la Gardie Campaign surrendered and De la Gardie concluded an agreement with Polish hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski. The battle had serious consequences for Russia, as the tsar was deposed by the Seven Boyars and the Poles occupied the Moscow Kremlin, after which the Russian state began to fall into its constituent parts. De la Gardie then sought to take control of the Russian north-west in order to prevent the Poles from extending their power and therefore threaten Sweden with an offensive on its Baltic territories.

== War ==
In July 1611, a Swedish expeditionary corps under Jacob De la Gardie captured Novgorod. The Novgorodians asked the Swedish king to install one of his sons (Carl Filip or Gustavus Adolphus) as their monarch.

In the meantime, Gustavus Adolphus succeeded to the Swedish throne. The young king decided to press his brother&#x27;s claim to the Russian throne even after the Poles had been expelled from Moscow by a patriotic uprising in 1612 and Mikhail Romanov had been elected the new tsar.
He was the first tsar of the House of Romanov.

While the Swedish statesmen envisaged the creation of a Trans-Baltic dominion extending northwards to Archangelsk and eastwards to Vologda, De la Gardie and other Swedish soldiers, still holding Novgorod and Ingria, saw the war as a reaction for their forces not receiving payment for their succour during the De la Gardie Campaign.

In 1613, the Swedish troops advanced towards Tikhvin and laid siege to the city but were repelled. The Russian counteroffensive failed to regain Novgorod, however. The Russian tsar refused to commit his troops to battle, and the war lumbered on until 1614 when the Swedes captured Gdov.

The following year, Gustavus Adolphus laid siege to Pskov but Russian Generals Morozov and Buturlin held their own. Sweden and Russia began negotiations on , which resulted in an end to the war by the Treaty of Stolbovo.

==Result==
In 1617, the Treaty of Stolbovo was concluded between Russia and Sweden in which the Swedes acquired significant territories in Ingria, with the townships of Ivangorod, Jama, Koporye, and Nöteborg, as well as Kexholm in Karelia, but restored Novgorod and Gdov which they had occupied since 1611 and 1614, respectively. As a result, Russia was denied access to the Baltic Sea for about a century, despite its persistent efforts to reverse the situation. This led to the increased importance of Arkhangelsk for its trading connections with Western Europe. Russia also renounced all claims to Estonia and Livonia and were obligated to pay 20,000 rubles in war reparations, while Sweden recognised Michael Romanov as the rightful Russian tsar.

A majority of sources assess the war as a victory for the Swedes, with some specifying it as a Swedish military victory. The treaty was considered humiliating in the Soviet era, but more recent Russian historiography views it differently; since the treaty allowed the Russians to concentrate their forces against Poland in the concurrent war, the loss of the Baltic coast was seen as less concerning at the time. Russian historian German Zamyatin claims that, while the treaty was difficult for Russia, Sweden had suffered a diplomatic defeat in its failure to secure Novgorod and Gdov, while other sources express a similar point of view. Gennady Kovalenko considers the agreement a mutually beneficial compromise. The Russian tsar and the Swedish king were both pleased with the peace treaty, with parades being held in Moscow as part of its conclusion.

<doc id="808362" wikidata="Q315630" url="?curid=808362" title="Vivarium">
<text>A vivarium (; or vivariums) is an area, usually enclosed, for keeping and raising animals or plants for observation or research. Water-based vivaria may have open tops providing they are not connected to other water bodies. An animal enclosure is considered a vivarium only if it provides quality of life through naturalistic components such as ample living space and natural decor that allow and encourage natural behaviours. Often, a portion of the ecosystem for a particular species is simulated on a smaller scale, with controls for environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and light.

A vivarium may be small enough to sit on a desk or table, such as a terrarium or an aquarium, or may be a very large structure, possibly outdoors. Large vivaria, particularly those holding organisms capable of flight, typically include some sort of a dual-door mechanism such as a sally port for entry and exit, so that the outer door can be closed to prevent escape before the inner door is opened.

== Types of vivarium==
Some vivaria can be subcategorized according to the habitat or lifeforms enclosed within. A vivarium that contains multiple components may be named according to its primary component, or simply called a vivarium. Each subcategory can refer to either an individual enclosure, or a facility that encompasses numerous like enclosures.

===Aquarium===

An aquarium (&quot;aqua&quot; = water) is a water-filled enclosure housing aquatic plants and/or animals such as fish. A bioactive aquarium would additionally house micro-organisms such as beneficial bacteria, and janitor animal species such as caridean shrimp, boxer shrimp, algae-eating snails and burrowing snails. At least one side of an aquarium is glazed to allow viewing of the aquatic habitat from the side as though viewing from underwater. Aquaria are further subcategorized by temperature (cold water, tropical) and salinity (freshwater, brackish, marine).

A Dutch aquarium (origin = Netherlands) is an underwater garden that features plants, with minimal visible hardscaping and few fish. It is terraced or the back-wall is lined in moss to prevent view through the rear of the aquarium.

===Terrarium===

A terrarium (&quot;terra&quot; = land) is an enclosure for a land habitat for animals, plants, fungi, lichens or any combination thereof. A bioactive terrarium would additionally house soil microorganisms and janitor animal species such as springtails and terrestrial isopods. It is distinct from a pot plant or animal cage by being enclosed to an extent to permit maintenance of temperature and humidity levels different from the ambient environment. Terraria are further subcategorized by biome (tropical/temperate desert, rainforest, grassland, etc.). A terrarium may feature a horizontal land surface, an escarpment (steep slope or cliff), or a fossorial (underground) section.

A Wardian case is a 19th-century sealed terrarium used for transport or display of plants or small animals such as moths under conditions where ventilation was more harmful than beneficial such as where ambient conditions were too saline, dry or polluted to support delicate species.

A bottle garden is a small sealed glazed terrarium, an actual glass bottle or otherwise, in which all water and nutrients that will be required for future growth of the plant(s) and soil microorganisms are sealed into the vessel at the time of planting, the only required care being management of light and temperature.

A sandwich-style terrarium is a terrarium or a section of a terrarium where soil, other firm substrate or a tree cookie (cross-section or disc) is enclosed in a narrow space between two sheets of glass or two nested jars, for observation of fossorial or woodboring animals such as earthworms, ants or termites.

A glirarium (&quot;glires&quot; = dormice; plural of &quot;glis&quot;) is an enclosure for housing trapped edible dormice as they fatten in preparation for hibernation.

===Semi-aquatic vivarium===

A semi-aquatic vivarium is an enclosure for species that live partially submerged or alternate between immersion in water and air. Examples include:
A paludarium (&quot;palus&quot; = marsh or swamp) is a semi-aquatic enclosure with aerial space above and water below, designed to house semi-aquatic plants that are rooted underwater but whose crowns reach above the surface of the water, or animals that do the same such as the mata mata. In addition to semi-aquatic plants, a paludarium may house animals such as shallow-water fish and treefrogs. The land area of a paludarium is absent or insignificant, but the term paludarium is often misused to refer to a riparium.

A riparium (&quot;ripa&quot; = bank or shore) is a semi-aquatic enclosure with a land area beside a water area. Though often used for semi-aquatic animals such as newts or turtles that alternate between time in the water and on land, a riparium can simply be an aquarium-terrarium combination set together for visual effect or to use the water area as means to help increase the humidity for terrestrial species.

An oceanarium is a semi-aquatic marine (saltwater) habitat, with aerial space above the water for animals such as dolphins which emerge wholly or partially above the ocean surface, and/or a land area beside the water to accommodate semi-aquatic species such as seals or penguins that emerge from the water to rest on land. An oceanarium can also house fully aquatic marine animals such as sharks and rays where the aerial space above the tank is designed only to accommodate the observer. A dolphinarium is an oceanarium for dolphins, a penguinarium is an oceanarium for penguins.

===Pond===

A natural, excavated or elevated pond is a vivarium if it is sealed from other waterbodies and managed such as by filtration, aeration or additions of animals or plants.

A water garden is an ornamental pond and its shore that features plants growing in and around the water, but may also house animals such as goldfish, turtles or mandarin ducks.

A fish pond is a controlled pond, artificial lake, or reservoir that is stocked with fish.

A koi pond is a pond used for keeping American koi or Japanese nishikigoi.

===Aviary===
An aviary (&quot;avis&quot; = bird) is a large enclosure for birds or other flying, gliding or swinging arboreal animals such as butterflies, bats, flying squirrels or primates. An aviary accommodates the birds&#x27; in-flight turning radius, whereas a flight cage restricts the bird to linear flight. Planted aviaries often have a very high ratio of plants to birds as many bird species will completely defoliate sparse plantings.

===Other===
A nocturnal house (&quot;nocturnus&quot; = night (adj.)) is a windowless building or room for housing nocturnal or crepuscular animals, or nyctinastic plants. Artificial lighting is staggered to the local natural daylight so that the inhabitants experience a natural 24-hour cycle, but their activity is scheduled at a time that is convenient for observers.

A greenhouse is an enclosure for plants with a glazed roof and wall(s) that allow the plants to make use of natural sunlight.

A conservatory is a room of a house or of another building, with a glazed roof and wall(s) that combines growing space for plants with a sitting room or dining area for people. Some conservatories also house animals such as koi, tortoises or free-flying birds.

An arboretum (&quot;arbor&quot; = tree) is a greenhouse, conservatory or outdoor place where many varieties of trees or shrubs are grown.

Some animal vivaria are not well-described by their name as related animal species can require vastly different habitats:
*A herpetarium (&quot;herpeton&quot; = reptile, creeping thing) is an enclosure housing amphibians or reptiles. A serpentarium is a herpetarium for snakes.
*An insectarium is an enclosure for housing insects. When used to refer to a facility, it often refers to a facility that houses both insects and other invertebrates. A formicarium (&quot;formica&quot; = ant) or ant farm is an enclosure housing ants.

==Size and materials==
A vivarium is usually made from clear container (often plastic or glass). Unless it is an aquarium, it does not need to withstand the pressure of water, so it can also be made out of wood or metal, with at least one transparent side. Modern vivariums can be as simple as a bottle (see bottle garden) and are sometimes constructed from epoxy-coated plywood and fitted with sliding glass doors. Coating the inside of a plywood vivarium helps to retain the natural effect of the environment. Epoxy-coated plywood vivariums retain heat better than glass or plastic enclosures and are able to withstand high degrees of humidity. They may be cubical, spherical, cuboidal, or other shapes. The choice of materials depends on the desired size and weight of the entire ensemble, resistance to high humidity, the cost and the desired quality.

The floor of a vivarium must have sufficient surface area for the species living inside. The height can also be important for the larger plants, climbing plants, or for tree climbing animal species. The width must be great enough to create the sensation of depth, both for the pleasure of the spectator and the good of the species inside.

The most commonly used substrates are common soil, small pebbles, sand, peat, chips of various trees, wood mulch, vegetable fibres (of coconut, for example), or a combination of these. The choice of the substrate depends on the needs of the plants or of the animals, moisture, the risks involved and aesthetic aspects. Sterile vivariums, sometimes used to ensure high levels of hygiene (especially during quarantine periods), generally have very straightforward, easily removable substrates such as paper tissue, wood chips and even newspaper. Typically, a low-nutrient, high-drainage substrate is placed on top of a false bottom or layer of expanded clay aggregate or stones, which retains humidity without saturating the substrate surface.

==Environmental controls==

===Lighting===
A lighting system is necessary, always adapted to the requirements of the animal and plant species. For example, certain reptiles in their natural environment need to heat themselves by the sun, so various bulbs may be necessary to simulate this in a terrarium.

Also, certain plants or diurnal animals need a source of UV to help synthesize Vitamin D and assimilate calcium. Such UV can be provided by specialized fluorescent tubes or daylight bulbs, which recreate the reptiles&#x27; natural environment and emit a more natural sunlight effect compared to the blue glow of a fluorescent tube.

A day/night regulator might be needed to simulate with accuracy the alternation of light and dark periods. The duration of the simulated day and night depends on the conditions in the natural habitat of the species and the season desired.

===Temperature===
The temperature can be a very important parameter for species that cannot adapt to other conditions than those found in their natural habitat.

Heating can be provided by several means, all of which are usually controlled by a thermostat:
heating lamps or infrared lamps,
hot plates and heat mats, providing heat at the base or sides of a terrarium,
heating cords or heat mats placed beneath the substrate,
heat rocks, or
more complex equipment generating or producing hot air to the inside of the vivarium.

Similar to lighting, a decrease in temperature might be needed for the simulated night periods, thus keeping living species healthy. Such variation need to be coherent to those found in the natural habitats of the species. Thermo-control systems are often used to regulate light cycles and heating, as well as humidity (coupled to built-in misting or rain systems). Light-dependent resistors or photo-diodes connected to the lighting are frequently used to simulate daytime, evening and nighttime light cycles, as well as timers to switch lighting and heating on and off when necessary.

===Humidity===
Many plants and animals have quite limited tolerance to the variation of moisture.

The regulation of humidity can be done by several means:
regular water pulverization,
water evaporation inside (from a basin, or circulation of water), or
automated pulverization systems and humidifiers.

===Ventilation and openings===
Access inside the vivarium is required for the purpose of maintenance, to take care of the plants and animals, or for the addition and withdrawal of food.
In the case of some animals, a frontal opening is preferable because accessing a vivarium from the top is associated by some species with the presence of predators and can therefore cause unnecessary stress.

Ventilation is not just important for circulating air, but also for preventing the growth of mold and development and spread of harmful bacteria. This is especially important in warm, humid vivariums. The traditional method consists of placing a suction fan (or ventilation slits) at a low level and another exhaust fan at a higher level, which allows the continual circulation of fresh air.

<doc id="808374" wikidata="Q7572630" url="?curid=808374" title="Space sunshade">
<text>A space sunshade or sunshield is something that diverts or otherwise reduces some of the Sun&#x27;s radiation, preventing it from hitting the Earth and thereby reducing its insolation, which results in reduced heating. Light can be diverted by different methods. The concept of the construction of sunshade as a method of climate engineering dates back to the years 1923, 1929, 1957 and 1978 by the physicist Hermann Oberth. Space mirrors in orbit around the Earth with a diameter of 100 to 300 km, as designed by Hermann Oberth, were intended to focus sunlight on individual regions of the Earth’s surface or deflect it into space so that the solar radiation is weakened in a specifically controlled manner for individual regions on the Earth’s surface. 
First proposed in 1989, another space sunshade concept involves putting a large occulting disc, or technology of equivalent purpose, between the Earth and Sun.

A sunshade could potentially be one climate engineering method for mitigating global warming through solar radiation management, because internationally negotiated reductions in carbon emissions may be insufficient to stem climate change. Sunshades could also be used to produce space solar power, acting as solar power satellites. Proposed shade designs include a single-piece shade and a shade made by a great number of small objects. Most such proposals contemplate a blocking element at the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point.

Modern proposals are based on some form of distributed sunshade composed of lightweight transparent elements or inflatable &quot;space bubbles&quot; manufactured in space to reduce the cost of launching massive objects to space. However it would cost trillions of dollars and no prototype has yet been launched. Critics also argue that building it would be too slow to prevent dangerous levels of global warming.

==Proposed designs ==

=== Cloud of small spacecraft ===
One proposed sunshade would be composed of 16 trillion small disks at the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point, 1.5 million kilometers from Earth and between it and the Sun. Each disk is proposed to have a 0.6-meter diameter and a thickness of about 5 micrometers. The mass of each disk would be about a gram, adding up to a total of almost 20 million tonnes. Such a group of small sunshades that blocks 2% of the sunlight, deflecting it off into space, would be enough to halt global warming. If 100 tonnes of disks were launched to low Earth orbit every day, it would take 550 years to launch all of them.

The individual autonomous flyers building up the cloud of sunshades are proposed not to reflect the sunlight but rather to be transparent lenses, deflecting the light slightly so it does not hit Earth. This minimizes the effect of solar radiation pressure on the units, requiring less effort to hold them in place at the L1 point. An optical prototype has been constructed by Roger Angel with funding from NIAC.

The remaining solar pressure and the fact that the L1 point is one of unstable equilibrium, easily disturbed by the wobble of the Earth due to gravitational effects from the Moon, requires the small autonomous flyers to be capable of maneuvering themselves to hold position. A suggested solution is to place mirrors capable of rotation on the surface of the flyers. By using the solar radiation pressure on the mirrors as solar sails and tilting them in the right direction, the flyer will be capable of altering its speed and direction to keep in position.

Such a group of sunshades would need to occupy an area of about 3.8 million square kilometers if placed at the L1 point (see other lower disc size estimates below).
It would still take years to launch enough of the disks into orbit to have any effect. This means a long lead time. Roger Angel of the University of Arizona presented the idea for a sunshade at the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in April 2006 and won a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts grant for further research in July 2006. Creating this sunshade in space was estimated to cost in excess of US$130 billion over 20 years with an estimated lifetime of 50-100 years. Thus leading Professor Angel to conclude that &quot;the sunshade is no substitute for developing renewable energy, the only permanent solution. A similar massive level of technological innovation and financial investment could ensure that. But if the planet gets into an abrupt climate crisis that can only be fixed by cooling, it would be good to be ready with some shading solutions that have been worked out.&quot;

Researchers from the University of Stuttgart, Institute of Space Systems described a roadmap for the development, construction and transport of an international planetary sun shield (IPSS) at the Lagrange point 1 in 2021, which would also be a photovoltaic plant. Here, too, as with Hermann Oberth, production on the Moon, the use of an electromagnetic Moon slingshot (lunar coilgun) and the transport of the components from the Moon to the Lagrange point 1 between the Earth and the Sun are discussed by means of electric spaceships (alternatively with sun sails) assumed. The authors refer to the many international activities and the chance to put the sunlight shield into operation by 2060.

==== Lightweight solutions and &quot;Space bubbles&quot; ====
A more recent design has been proposed by Olivia Borgue and Andreas M. Hein in 2022, proposing a distributed sunshade with a mass on the order of 100,000 tons, composed of ultra-thin polymeric films and SiO2 nanotubes. The author estimated that launching such mass would require 399 yearly launches of a vehicle such as SpaceX Starship for 10 years.

A 2022 concept by MIT Senseable City Lab proposes using thin-film structures (&quot;space bubbles&quot;) manufactured in outer space to solve the problem of launching the required mass to space. MIT scientists led by Carlo Ratti believe deflecting 1.8 percent of solar radiation can fully reverse climate change. The full raft of inflatable bubbles would be roughly the size of Brazil and include a control system to regulate its distance from the Sun and optimise its effects. The shell of the thin-film bubbles would be made of silicon, tested in outer space-like conditions at a pressure of .0028 atm and at -50 degrees Celsius. They plan to investigate low vapor-pressure materials to rapidly inflate the bubbles, such as a silicon-based melt or a graphene-reinforced ionic liquid.

In July 2022, a pair of researchers from MIT Senseable City Lab, Olivia Borgue and Andreas M. Hein, have instead proposed integrating nanotubes made out of silicon dioxide into ultra-thin polymeric films (described as &quot;space bubbles&quot; in the media ), whose semi-transparent nature would allow them to resist the pressure of solar wind at L1 point better than any alternative with the same weight. The use of these &quot;bubbles&quot; would limit the mass of a distributed sunshade roughly the size of Brazil to about 100,000 tons, much lower than the earlier proposals. However, it would still require between 399 and 899 yearly launches of a vehicle such as SpaceX Starship for a period of around 10 years, even though the production of the bubbles themselves would have to be done in space. The flights would not begin until research into production and maintenance of these bubbles is completed, which the authors estimate would require a minimum of 10–15 years. After that, the space shield may be large enough by 2050 to prevent crossing of the threshold.

In 2023, three astronomers revisited the space dust concept, instead advocating for a lunar colony which would continuously mine the Moon in order to eject lunar dust into space on a trajectory where it would interfere with sunlight streaming towards the Earth. Ejections would have to be near-continuous, as since the dust would scatter in a matter of days, and about 10 million tons would have to be dug out and launched annually. The authors admit that they lack a background in either climate or rocket science, and the proposal may not be logistically feasible.

===One Fresnel lens===
Several authors have proposed dispersing light before it reaches the Earth by putting a very large lens in space, perhaps at the L1 point between the Earth and the Sun. This plan was proposed in 1989 by J. T. Early. His design involved making a large glass (2,000 km) occulter from lunar material and placing at the L1 point. Issues included the large amount of material needed to make the disc and also the energy to launch it to its orbit.

In 2004, physicist and science fiction author Gregory Benford calculated that a concave rotating Fresnel lens 1000 kilometres across, yet only a few millimeters thick, floating in space at the point, would reduce the solar energy reaching the Earth by approximately 0.5% to 1%.

The cost of such a lens has been disputed. At a science fiction convention in 2004, Benford estimated that it would cost about US$10 billion up front, and another $10 billion in supportive cost during its lifespan.

===One diffraction grating===
A similar approach involves placing a very large diffraction grating (thin wire mesh) in space, perhaps at the L1 point between the Earth and the Sun. A proposal for a 3,000 ton diffraction mesh was made in 1997 by Edward Teller, Lowell Wood, and Roderick Hyde, although in 2002 these same authors argued for blocking solar radiation in the stratosphere rather than in orbit given then-current space launch technologies.

Other Lower Disc Size Estimates

Recent work by Feinberg (2022) illustrate that lower disc area sizes (factor of approximately 3.5 reduction) are feasible when the background climate response is considered. For example, the background Earth climate would yield less re-radiation and feedback. In addition, disc area sizes can be further reduced by 50 times using an Annual Solar Geoengineering approach as indicated by Feinberg (2024).

<doc id="808381" wikidata="Q3576683" url="?curid=808381" title="À Hauteur d'homme">
<text>À Hauteur d&#x27;homme is a 2003 Canadian political documentary directed in 2003 by Jean-Claude Labrecque about Bernard Landry and the 2003 general election in Quebec, Canada. It won a Jutra Award for &quot;Best Documentary&quot; (tie) in 2004. Its style belongs to the Quebec cinéma direct school of filmmaking.

== Overview ==
&quot;À Hauteur d&#x27;homme&quot; is a political documentary film revolving first around one man, Bernard Landry, leader of the Parti Québécois (PQ), and second around the re-election campaign of his party in 2003. The movie shows an intimate, never-before-seen look at the works of an election campaign. The finality of the story, the defeat of the party, gives this work a mood of tragedy, but with final acceptance. It also features, amongst others, Landry&#x27;s girlfriend, Chantal Renaud, and press attaché Hubert Bolduc.

Landry, the protagonist, is an independentist, social democrat, Premier of Quebec, fighting for the re-election of the Parti Québécois in the hope of obtaining his life&#x27;s dream: the independence of Quebec from Canada. His opponents in the election, Jean Charest of the Parti Libéral du Québec (PLQ) and Mario Dumont of the Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ), are rarely seen in the film.

Along with his team, he goes through an intense experience in two periods. The first half of the campaign goes smoothly: Landry is relaxed and confident. After having fought for its very life, the party is popular again and leads the polls. The televised leaders&#x27; debate is the turning point. During the debate Charest confronts Landry with a news report purportingly quoting Jacques Parizeau, the former PQ premier, as being unrepentant for his 1995 referendum evening&#x27;s unfortunate remarks. In the following days, this sparks a controversy that will be known as the Parizeau Affair. From then on, a second period begins. The PQ loses some steam. Charest slowly surpasses Landry in the polls.

Often trapped by insistent, forceful questions by reporters, Landry shares with the team his impression that journalists are unjustly harassing him and the party&#x27;s campaign. After being, in turn, anxious, angry, and sometimes morose, he accepts the coming ineluctable defeat with serenity, but with much emotion, with the comfort of his loved ones and colleagues.

The documentary features the following politicians: Pauline Marois, André Boisclair and François Legault.

Landry&#x27;s strategist team consists of: Richard Nadeau, Brigitte Pelletier, Hubert Bolduc, Denis Hardy, Frederic Alberro, Marie-Johanne Nadeau, Nathalie Verger, Pierre Langlois, Éric Côté and Jacques Wilkins.

==Context==
In 2002, the poll numbers for the Parti Québécois fell sharply. The PQ government had been in power for two mandates and was seen as worn-out by some. An important part of the PQ&#x27;s support went to the Action Démocratique du Québec and its young leader, Mario Dumont, and some to the Liberal Party of Quebec. It is under this dramatic situation for the PQ followers that Landry underwent a revitalization of the party and its image. The PQ was aided by the fall popularity of the ADQ&#x27;s ideas as their conservative nature was uncovered, and by social democratic measures taken by the PQ government like the passing of the Act to combat poverty and social exclusion. The Parti Québécois succeeded in gaining back popularity in the beginning of 2003 to take the lead in the public opinion polls again. The PQ felt confident again to take upon a singular task: to become the first Quebec government in more than forty years to win a third mandate.

It is at the time of the downfall of 2002 that Labrecque decided to work on bringing about a movie about the coming election. He stated that, for this election, he believed the PQ had a lot to win if it succeeded, and a lot to lose if it did not: the re-election of the party could bring Quebec to independence, while a loss had the potential of hurting the sovereigntist movement, perhaps halting it for years.

The 2003 Quebec election itself happened over the backdrop of the war in Iraq. The principal battles in that war took place during the first half of the campaign, diverting the attention of the media and the population. Landry became known for his custom of wearing the white ribbon worn by Quebecers in favour of peace. The wearing of this ribbon was soon adopted by the two other main party leaders, Charest and Dumont.

==Production==

===General===
For months, Landry was filmed everywhere he went, up to voting day. The fact that a politician had accepted to be filmed in such privacy impressed many and was therefore seen as an historical feat: few other movies have had such access to a political figure before.

===Audio===
These two previously existing (that is to say that they were not created for the movie soundtrack) musical compositions of the soundtrack are the backbone of the musical backdrop of the film. Audio excerpts from Amazon.com.
*&quot;Facades&quot; by Philip Glass returns in leitmotiv throughout the movie. It was chosen by Labrecque for its repetitive nature, representative of the 2003 political campaign in some ways.
*&quot;Fur Alina&quot; by Arvo Pärt and its very melancholic ambiance is used in the final scene where Landry conceded defeat and is comforted by the people close to him.

===Visuals===
It is rare for such emphasis be placed on attention to visual beauty in a documentary, especially a political one. This has brought much admiration for the work. It can be stated that Labrecque made it a point to show Landry as a human being with often very intimate, tight shots, breaking the standard of the news channel waist shot or talking heads type of clips that politicians are mostly seen through.

==Awards==
The film was co-winner, with Benoît Pilon&#x27;s &quot;Roger Toupin, épicier variété&quot;, of the Jutra Award for Best Documentary Film at the 6th Jutra Awards in 2004.

<doc id="808398" wikidata="Q3196371" url="?curid=808398" title="Kid Nichols">
<text>Charles Augustus &quot;Kid&quot; Nichols (September 14, 1869 – April 11, 1953) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher who played for the Boston Beaneaters, St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies from 1890 to 1906. A switch hitter who threw right-handed, he was listed at and . He is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Nichols played minor league baseball for three teams until 1889, when he signed with the Boston Beaneaters. After making his debut the following season and spending 12 seasons with the Beaneaters, Nichols spent a two-year sojourn in the minor leagues. He was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1904 and subsequently played for the Philadelphia Phillies, with whom he finished his career in 1906. He is famous for being the youngest pitcher to join the 300 win club.

== Early life ==

Nichols was born on September 14, 1869, in Madison, Wisconsin. His parents were Robert and Christina Nichols. His father had worked as a butcher and owned a grocery store with several locations in Madison. Robert had at least four children from a prior marriage to a woman named Sarah, who died of tuberculosis in 1859. Robert and Christina had several children together.

The family moved from Madison to Kansas City, Missouri when Nichols was a child. While his siblings worked in the family butcher shop, Nichols pursued baseball.

== Baseball career ==

Before he turned 18 years old, Nichols had debuted in the minor leagues with the 1887 Kansas City Cowboys of the Western League, earning an 18–12 win–loss record that season. He spent 1888 between the Kansas City Blues of the Western Association and Memphis of the Southern League, finishing the year with a combined 27–10 record. In 1889, he registered a 39–8 record for the Omaha Omahogs of the Western Association.

Nichols signed with the Boston Beaneaters in September 1889 and entered the major leagues in with them in 1890. Due to Nichols&#x27;s youthful appearance and relative lack of physical heft, Beaneaters&#x27; players and fans began calling him &quot;Kid,&quot; a nickname which stuck for the rest of his career. Nichols recorded a 27–19 win–loss record, a 2.23 earned run average (ERA) and 222 strikeouts, beginning a string of 10 consecutive seasons with 20 wins or more. Nichols also had a major league record seven 30-win seasons in this time (1891–1894, 1896–1898) with a career high of 35 in 1892. The Beaneaters won several pennant races during Nichols&#x27; tenure, finishing in first place five times between 1891 and 1898. The team had 102 wins per season in 1892 and 1898, which stood as franchise highs until 1998. Baseball-Reference.com calculates that Nichols led the team in wins above replacement in 1890 and 1892 through 1898.

Nichols had his first losing season in 1900, when he went 13–16. He improved to 19–16 the following year. After the 1901 season, Nichols purchased an interest in a minor league franchise in Kansas City, the Kansas City Blue Stockings. He left the Beaneaters to manage and pitch for the Kansas City Blue Stockings, where he won a total of 48 games in 1902 and 1903. After a two-year hiatus from the major leagues, Nichols returned to the 20-win plateau for the 11th and final time in his career in 1904 for a new team, the St. Louis Cardinals. The Philadelphia Phillies picked him up off waivers in 1905, and he finished his career with them in 1906, playing his final game on May 18, 1906.

Nichols retired with 362 wins, 208 losses, 1,881 strikeouts and a 2.96 ERA. Nichols&#x27;s win total was exceeded at the time only by Cy Young and Pud Galvin and is now the seventh highest total in major league history. His 5,067 innings pitched ranks 11th all-time. He was the youngest pitcher to win 300 games, reaching that milestone at the age of 30.

== Later life ==

After baseball, Nichols dabbled in the motion picture industry, partnering with Joe Tinker in a business that distributed movies to theatres in the midwest. An accomplished bowler, Nichols also opened bowling alleys in the Kansas City area. He won Kansas City&#x27;s Class A bowling championship at age 64.

Nichols was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1949. He was said to have been proud of two things: his Hall of Fame selection and the fact that he had never been replaced in a game by a relief pitcher.

In October 1952, the 83-year-old Nichols was admitted to Menorah Hospital in Kansas City to investigate a complaint with his neck. Doctors ordered tests, but Nichols would not submit to them until after the seventh game of the World Series ended. He was later diagnosed with carcinomatosis, cancer that had spread throughout his body. He died on April 11, 1953.

== Quotes ==
Nichols took pride in throwing complete games, stating, &quot;I take pride in two things. My election to baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame and the fact I never was removed from a game for a relief hurler.&quot;

<text>The Mexico national football team () represents Mexico in men&#x27;s international football and is governed by the Federación Mexicana de Fútbol (). It has been a member of FIFA since 1929 and competes as a member of CONCACAF since 1961, of which it was one of the founding members.
From 1946 to 1961, it was a member of NAFC, which was a predecessor confederation of CONCACAF and the governing body of football in North America in that period, and was also a member of PFC, the attempt at a unified confederation of the Americas.

Mexico has qualified to seventeen World Cups and has qualified consecutively since 1994, making it one of six countries to do so. Mexico played France in the first match of the first World Cup on 13 July 1930. Mexico&#x27;s best progression in World Cups has been reaching the quarterfinals in both the 1970 and 1986 World Cups, both times as host, and will play host for the third time in 2026.

Mexico is historically the most successful national team in its confederation, winning 13 CONCACAF continental titles, which are 12 CONCACAF Championship/CONCACAF Gold Cup titles and 1 CONCACAF Cup. It also won the NAFC Championship twice, one North American Nations Cup and two gold medals of the Central American and Caribbean Games. It is one of eight national teams to have won two of the three most important worldwide football competitions that are recognized and endorsed by FIFA (World Cup, Confederations Cup, and Olympic football tournament), having won the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2012 Olympic football tournament. Mexico is the only team from CONCACAF and also the only non-European or South American team to have won an official worldwide FIFA competition for senior national teams, after winning the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup at home. Although Mexico is under the jurisdiction of CONCACAF, the national team was invited since 1993 to participate in the Copa América, which is CONMEBOL&#x27;s main continental competition, finishing runners-up twice (1993 and 2001), and obtaining third place in three editions.

==History==
===Early years===
Football in Mexico was first organized in the early 20th century by European immigrant groups, notably miners from Cornwall, England, and in later years Spanish exiles fleeing the Spanish Civil War.

The team&#x27;s first match was played on 9 December 1923 at &quot;Parque España&quot; in Mexico City, beating Guatemala 2–1, which was the first match of a series of international friendlies played against Guatemala. The second match played on 12 December was won by Mexico 2–0, and the final match of the series, played on 16 December, ended in a 3–3 draw. The manager for this team was Rafael Garza Gutiérrez.

It would be another four years before the national team would be represented in international friendlies. Mexico faced Spain, drawing 3–3 on 19 June 1927. During this series, the team also played against Nacional de Montevideo, losing 1–3.

===Formation===
In 1927, the first official governing football body in Mexico was founded. The 1928 Olympic Football Tournament was Mexico&#x27;s first official international competition, where Mexico lost to Spain 1–7 in the round of 16.

Mexico participated in the inaugural 1930 FIFA World Cup in Uruguay, grouped with Argentina, Chile, and France. Mexico took part in the first World Cup match ever, a 4–1 loss to France, with Mexico&#x27;s first World Cup goal scored by Juan Carreño. In their second match, Mexico fell to Chile 3–0. Mexico&#x27;s third match, against Argentina, featured the first penalty of the tournament, scored by Mexico&#x27;s Manuel Rosas, although Mexico would go on to lose this match by a score of 6–3.

===Post-WWII===

Mexico did not appear in another World Cup tournament until 1950. Despite being the strongest team in the North American Football Confederation and its successor, CONCACAF, Mexico struggled to make much of an impact in the World Cup before 1970, and found it difficult to compete against European and South American teams. However, goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal has the distinction of being the first player ever to appear in five consecutive World Cups.

In 1965, Mexico won the 1965 CONCACAF Championship to become continental champions for the first time.
Mexico hosted the 1970 World Cup and kicked off their campaign with a scoreless draw against the Soviet Union, followed by a 4–0 win over El Salvador. Mexico advanced to the next round with a victory against Belgium, and in the quarter-finals, Mexico was eliminated by Italy, losing 4–1.

Mexico failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup in West Germany, but did make it into the 1978 finals, as they suffered an early exit after three defeats: 0–6 against the 1974 hosts, 1–3 against Tunisia, and 1–3 to Poland. Mexico failed to qualify for the 1982 World Cup.

In 1986, Mexico again hosted the World Cup. Coached by Bora Milutinović, Mexico was placed in Group B where they defeated Belgium 2–1, drew 1–1 with Paraguay, and defeated Iraq 1–0. El Tri topped their group, and advanced to the next round where they defeated Bulgaria 2–0. In the quarter-finals, Mexico lost to West Germany 1–4 in a penalty shootout after the match finished 0–0.

====1990s====
Mexico was disqualified from the 1990 FIFA World Cup (and other international competitions) after using players over the age limit in the qualifying round for the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship, known as the &quot;Cachirules&quot; scandal. The punishment was applied to all Mexico national representatives of all FIFA-sanctioned tournaments.

In the 1990s, after hiring coach César Luis Menotti, Mexican football began experiencing greater international success. In the 1993 Copa América they finished second, losing to Argentina 2–1 in the final. At the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States, Mexico won its group on tiebreakers, emerging from a group composed of Italy, Ireland, and Norway. However, Mexico lost in the round of 16 to Bulgaria on penalty kicks.

At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Mexico was placed in a group with the Netherlands, South Korea and Belgium. Mexico won their opening fixture 3–1 against South Korea, drew Belgium 2–2, and against the Netherlands with the same score, qualifying for the round of 16. In that round, Mexico lost 2–1 to Germany.

In 1999, Mexico won its first official FIFA tournament by becoming the first host nation to win the FIFA Confederations Cup. Mexico defeated the United States 1–0 in the semifinals, and 1998 World Cup runners-up Brazil 4–3 in the final.

===21st century===
====2000s====
Mexico was placed in Group G at the 2002 World Cup alongside Italy, Croatia, and Ecuador. Mexico started with a 1–0 win over Croatia. In the second match, Mexico earned a 2–1 win over Ecuador. Mexico then achieved a 1–1 draw against Italy. In the round of 16, Mexico played rivals United States, losing 2–0.
Mexico was one of eight seeded teams at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, and entered Group D, being drawn with Iran, Angola and Portugal. Mexico won their opening match 3–1 against Iran. In their second match, Mexico played to a 0–0 draw against Angola. After losing to Portugal 2–1, Mexico reached the round of 16, where they would be eliminated again, this time to Argentina, 2–1. Mexico&#x27;s coach Ricardo Lavolpe stepped down after the tournament, and was succeeded by Hugo Sánchez.

After losing the final match of the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup 1–2 against the United States, Mexico successfully rebounded at the 2007 Copa América. Beginning by beating Brazil 2–0, they then defeated Ecuador and tied with Chile to come first in Group B. In the quarter-finals, Mexico beat Paraguay 6–0, but lost in the semi-finals 3–0 to Argentina. Mexico secured third place against Uruguay, winning 3–1.

In July 2009, Mexico won their fifth Gold Cup, and eighth CONCACAF Championship overall, after beating the United States 5–0 in the final.

====2010s====

Mexico qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, where they were drawn into Group A alongside host South Africa, France and Uruguay. They drew 1–1 against South Africa, defeated France 2–0, and lost 1–0 to Uruguay, and advanced to the round of 16, where they were eliminated following another defeat to Argentina, 1–3.

The 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup saw Mexico win their group with three wins and no losses. During the tournament, however, five players tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol and were suspended from the competition. Mexico beat Guatemala in the quarter-finals 2–1, and Honduras 2–0 in the semi-finals. For the third-straight year, the final would be contested between Mexico and the United States; Mexico won the match 4–2, and qualified for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil, where they were eliminated at the group stage.

Mexico placed second in their group at the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and advanced to the semifinals and faced Panama. Mexico lost the match 2–1, their second defeat to Panama in the competition after losing to them in the group stage. The two losses to Panama were the first two times Panama had ever defeated Mexico in a Gold Cup match.

Mexico won only two of ten matches during the fourth round of 2014 World Cup qualifying, but qualified for an intercontinental play-off as the fourth-highest placed team in the CONCACAF region. They defeated New Zealand 9–3 on aggregate to qualify for a sixth consecutive World Cup. The team reached the round of 16 where they were defeated 2–1 by the Netherlands.

At the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup, Mexico was drawn into Group C along with Triniad and Tobago, Cuba and Guatemala. The team placed second in the group, and won the quarterfinal match against Costa Rica and semifinal against Panama, both under controversial circumstances. Mexico won the Gold Cup after defeating Jamaica 3–1 in the final. Two days after the final, Miguel Herrera was released as coach of the national team after an alleged physical altercation with TV Azteca announcer Christian Martinoli. On 10 October, Mexico defeated the United States 3–2 to win the inaugural edition of the CONCACAF Cup, thus earning qualification to the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia. The following month, Juan Carlos Osorio was hired as Mexico&#x27;s 16th manager, replacing interim manager Ricardo Ferretti.

Mexico entered the Copa América Centenario, hosted in the United States, on a 13-match unbeaten streak that began in July 2015. El Tri placed first in Group C, winning 3–1 over Uruguay and 2–0 over Jamaica, and drawing 1–1 with Venezuela. In the quarter-final against Chile in Santa Clara, California, the team lost 7–0, ending the unbeaten streak at 16 after nearly a year. After the match, manager Osorio apologized to Mexico&#x27;s fans for what he described as an &quot;embarrassment, an accident of football&quot;.

At the 2017 Confederations Cup, Mexico was drawn into Group A along with Portugal, New Zealand, and hosts Russia. El Tri advanced as runners-up of the group, and lost 4–1 to Germany in the semi-finals. Mexico finished fourth in the tournament, losing 2–1 to Portugal in the third-place match.
In their opening match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Mexico defeated defending champion Germany, thanks to a sole goal from Hirving Lozano, for the first time in a World Cup match. They would go on to defeat South Korea 2–1 in their next match, with goals from Carlos Vela and Javier Hernández, before falling 3–0 to Sweden in the last group stage match. Despite the loss, Mexico qualified to the round of 16 for the seventh-consecutive tournament. In the round of 16, Mexico was defeated 2–0 by Brazil; the defeat meant that for the seventh tournament in a row, Mexico failed to reach the quarterfinals since they last hosted the World Cup in 1986. On 28 July, Juan Carlos Osorio left as head coach on the expiry of his contract.

In January 2019, Gerardo Martino was appointed as Mexico&#x27;s new head coach, becoming the third Argentine to coach the national team. In that year&#x27;s Gold Cup tournament, they won all three group stage matches, defeated Costa Rica in penalties 5–4 following a 1–1 draw in the quarter-final and won against Haiti in the semi-final. Mexico won the Gold Cup after defeating the United States 1–0 in the final.

====2020s====
Mexico finished runners-up in the 2021 CONCACAF Nations League Final and the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup, both in losses to the United States. At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Mexico finished third in Group C behind Argentina and Poland (due to goal difference), making it the first time since 1978 that Mexico were eliminated in the group stage (the 1982 and 1990 World Cup tournaments, in which Mexico did not participate, notwithstanding). This led to the end of Mexico&#x27;s streak of reaching the round of 16 (which it had done in the previous seven World Cups), and as a result head coach Gerardo Martino stepped down immediately after the elimination.

In February 2023, Diego Cocca was appointed as the new head coach, the fourth Argentine to take the job. The same month, Mexico automatically qualified for the 2026 World Cup as co-host. In the 2023 CONCACAF Nations League semi-finals, Mexico suffered a 0–3 defeat to the United States, which caused even more widespread outrage in Mexico. They defeated Panama 1–0 in the third place match that was largely boycotted by Mexican fans; the following day, Cocca was dismissed from his post, with Jaime Lozano appointed on an interim basis to take charge for the forthcoming Gold Cup. Mexico went on to win the tournament, defeating Panama 1–0 in the final. After the win, Lozano was appointed as head coach on a permanent basis. However, following an underwhelming group stage exit from the 2024 Copa América, on 16 July, Lozano was dismissed from his position.

==Home stadium==
The Estadio Azteca, also known in Spanish as &quot;El Coloso de Santa Úrsula&quot;, was built in 1966. It is the official home stadium of the Mexico national team, as well as the Mexican club team Club América. It has an official capacity of 87,523, making it the largest football-specific stadium in the Americas and the third largest football stadium in the world. The stadium hosted the FIFA World Cup Final in 1970 and 1986, and the stadium will host the tournament again in 2026.

Friendly matches hosted by the Mexico national team often take place in stadiums across the United States, which are marketed under the branding MEXTOUR by FMF. From 2000 to 2019, the national team played 110 friendlies in the United States, which were criticized as &quot;cash grabs&quot; by fans. In 2022, the team played 15 matches in the United States and averaged over 52,000 in attendance at each of them; several were played at AT&amp;T Stadium in Dallas, which El Tri head coach Jaime Lozano labeled as &quot;the second home of the Mexican national team&quot;. Additional friendlies under the MEXTOUR brand are also played in Mexico, including at the Azteca for special occasions.

==Team image==
===Kit===
The Mexico national team traditionally utilizes a tricolor system, composed of green shirts, white shorts and red socks, which originate from the national flag of Mexico, known as the &quot;tricolor&quot;. Until the mid-1950s, Mexico wore a predominantly maroon kit, with black or dark blue shorts.

In 2015, Adidas released a new all-black color scheme for Mexico&#x27;s home kit. Green, white and red remain as accent colors.

In 2017, the Mexico national team&#x27;s jerseys were updated to reflect their Spanish names correctly spelled, with the diacritic mark.

=== Kit suppliers ===
===Media coverage===
All of Mexico&#x27;s matches are shown live on over-the-air networks Televisa and TV Azteca in Mexico. In the United States all of Mexico&#x27;s international friendlies and home World Cup qualifiers are shown on Spanish language network Univision while away World Cup qualifiers are shown on Telemundo. On 30 January 2013, English language network ESPN and Univision announced an agreement to telecast the Mexico national team home World Cup qualifiers and international friendly matches in English in the United States.

===Supporters===

====&quot;¡Eh, puto!&quot;====

Mexico&#x27;s fans are infamously known for the vulgar, homophobic chant &quot;¡Eh, puto!&quot;, which is typically said when an opponent&#x27;s goalkeeper is about to perform a goal kick.

=====Origins=====
The origins of the chant is thought to have had developed in the 1980s in Monterrey where in little league American football games, fans would chant &quot;¡Eh, pum!&quot; during the opening kickoff. This chant was not disparagingly used as the word &quot;pum&quot; is attributed to an impact of some sort. Though the current incarnation of the chant is widely thought to have originated sometime between 2000 and 2003 by supporters of Atlas to former Atlas goalkeeper, Oswaldo Sánchez, no primary sources exist that support this claim and is an urban legend. The earliest documented usage of &quot;puto&quot; being chanted by fans in this manner occurred on 22 May 2004, during the second leg of the 2004 Clausura repechage match between Cruz Azul and Pachuca. Fans of Pachuca repeatedly chanted &quot;puto&quot; every time Óscar Pérez performed a goal kick.

=====Sanctions=====
Due to the homophobic meaning of the word &quot;puto&quot; in Mexican Spanish (a vulgar term for a male prostitute), the chant received negative attention in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Mexico&#x27;s fans defended it as being traditionally used in the Liga MX. On 23 June 2014, FIFA dropped an investigation, concluding that the chant &quot;was not considered insulting in the specific context&quot;. Football Against Racism in Europe, an anti-discrimination organization, criticized the ruling as &quot;disappointing&quot;. In 2017, in advance of the 2018 World Cup, FIFA fined the Mexico football federation over fans&#x27; use of the chant and introduced escalating sanctions, which were first applied in Liga MX games in 2019. In 2021, three Mexico international matches in the United States were halted because of fan behaviour, including the CONCACAF Nations League final against the United States, in which fans also threw things onto the pitch and Giovanni Reyna was hit in the face by a heavy object. On 18 June 2021, FIFA announced that as a penalty for the use of the chant in a pre-Olympics tournament in Guadalajara, spectators would be barred from Mexico&#x27;s first two qualifying matches for the 2022 World Cup. During the semifinals, the match between Mexico and the United States was stopped at the 90th minute and eventually ended early due to the chants.

== Rivalries ==
=== United States ===
Mexico and the United States are widely considered as the two top teams in CONCACAF. Matches between the two nations often attracts media attention, public interest and discourse in both countries. Although the first match was played in 1934, their rivalry was not considered major until the late 20th century, when the U.S. emerged as a solid international side. 

Mexico met the United States in the round of 16 of the 2002 World Cup, losing 2–0. Ten years later, on 15 August 2012, the United States defeated Mexico at Estadio Azteca in the first victory for the U.S. against Mexico on Mexican soil in 75 years. On 10 October 2015, Mexico defeated the U.S. 3–2 in Los Angeles to qualify for the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia, winning on American soil for the first time since 1980. On 11 November 2016, El Tri achieved their second consecutive victory on U.S. soil, in qualification for the 2018 World Cup, by defeating the U.S. in Columbus, Ohio.

Since their first meeting in 1934, the two teams have met 78 times, with Mexico leading at 37 wins, 17 draws, and 24 losses, 147 goals scored, and 92 conceded. Mexico dominated in early years, with a 27–9–5 record through 1990. However, since that time the series has become much more competitive, largely due to growth of soccer in the United States; since 2000, the series has favored the U.S. 18–8–9, with Mexico outscored 48–33. But in the 2010s, the rivalry has been marked by Mexican success, with Mexico defeating the United States in the Gold Cup final in 2011 and 2019, and the CONCACAF Cup in 2015. In 2021, however, Mexico lost to the United States in both the CONCACAF Nations League final and the Gold Cup final. Still, Mexico remains undefeated to the United States at home soil in competitive matches, with all 19 meetings at home soil being either a win (15) or a draw (4).

=== Argentina ===
Mexico has a rivalry with Argentina, given these two nations are among the most renowned Hispanic nations in the world. The rivalry is abnormal by the fact it is intercontinental, with Argentina part of CONMEBOL and Mexico part of CONCACAF. This rivalry is more keenly felt by Mexican supporters than Argentines, who typically view Brazil, Uruguay, England and Germany as bigger rivals. In fact, a number of Argentines do not consider Mexico as rivals. Mexico has historically not fared well against Argentina, recording only 4 wins, 16 losses and 12 draws.

=== Costa Rica ===
Mexico has a growing rivalry with Costa Rica, as Costa Rica is the first country in CONCACAF to beat Mexico on Mexican soil in FIFA World Cup qualification, known as &quot;Aztecazo&quot;. Costa Rica is also widely recognised as the only Central American national team to have sufficient quality to compete at the global stage, which increased the importance of the rivalry. Mexico holds a dominant record against Costa Rica with 32 wins, 20 draws and only 6 losses.

<text>Reginald Aldworth Daly (May 19, 1871 – September 19, 1957) was a Canadian geologist. He is best known for being one of the first proponents of the giant-impact hypothesis of the formation of the Moon.

==Biography==
Reginald Daly was educated at the University of Toronto, where geologist A.P. Coleman persuaded him away from teaching mathematics and into Earth Sciences. He obtained his PhD at Harvard, and did postgraduate work in Germany and France. After working as a field geologist for the International Boundary Commission, he was a professor, and headed the Department of Geology at Harvard University from 1912 until 1942. Daly was president of The Geological Society of America in 1932.

For the Boundary Commission, working in six field seasons, Daly mapped the border from the Pacific Ocean to the Great Plains, a rugged swath long and wide – an area of about . He documented the geology alone, but had the help of one field assistant and numerous wranglers and porters. He collected 1,500 rock specimens and made 960 thin sections, using a German polishing technique he learnt as a student. The project also included 1,300 photographs, dozens of lake soundings, stratigraphic and structural mapping, petrology, and morphology. In 1912, he filed his final report with the Geological Survey of Canada, a massive 3-volume tome he called &quot;North America Cordillera: Forty-Ninth Parallel.&quot; This work along the 49th parallel led him to formulate a theory of the origins of igneous rocks, and later publish his seminal work &quot;Igneous Rocks and Their Origin&quot; in 1914.

According to Daly&#x27;s biographer, James Natland, Daly was an early proponent of Arthur Holmes and Alfred Wegener&#x27;s continental drift theory. Daly summarized his ideas in his 1926 book, &quot;Our Mobile Earth,&quot; which included on the title page small print adopted from Galileo: &quot;E pur si muove&quot;. Daly&#x27;s theory on continental displacement was based partly on the idea that after the Moon was ejected from the Earth, continental movement was an inevitable part of rebalancing the planet; he also suggested that continental material accruing near oceans eventually slips, and forces continents to creep along. He expanded this notion in &quot;Strength and Structure of the Earth,&quot; in 1940, where Daly anticipated aspects of plate tectonics, including introduction of a &quot;mesospheric shell&quot; and a slippery vitreous basaltic substratum.

Daly also proposed the impact theory of lunar creation in 1946, which countered two prevailing notions: George Darwin&#x27;s hypothesis that the Moon spun out of the primordial Earth due to centrifugal force; and, another fashionable theory that the Moon was a captured wayward asteroid. Daly applied Newtonian physics to make his point, which was later validated.

His doctoral students included the Canadian geologist Norman L. Bowen, who, based on experiments and observations of natural rocks, summarized the order of crystallization of common silicate minerals from typical basaltic magma undergoing fractional crystallization, now known as Bowen&#x27;s reaction series.

==Family==
In 1903, Daly married Louise Porter Haskell, daughter of Alexander Cheves Haskell and Alice Van Yeveren, and elder sister of Mary Elizabeth Haskell. After their marriage, Louise accompanied Daly on his travels, and in the field, as an assistant. She did much of the work in preparing and editing his manuscripts and books, and Daly&#x27;s 1914 book on &#x27;Igneous Rocks and their Origin&#x27; is dedicated to her; his &quot;inspiring fellow worker&quot;.

==Awards==
In 1909, Daly was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1913 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1925. Daly was awarded the Penrose Medal in 1935, the Wollaston Medal in 1942 and the William Bowie Medal in 1946. In 1950 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. The potassium zirconium silicate mineral dalyite and craters on Mars and the Moon are named in his honor. His Cambridge, Massachusetts, house (the Reginald A. Daly House) is now a National Historic Landmark.

She completed a shorthand typing course at Pitman&#x27;s College and was a regular dancer on the popular music TV programme Ready Steady Go! Franks initially worked in various secretarial jobs before taking a journalistic role at &quot;Petticoat&quot;, working under Eve Pollard and alongside Janet Street-Porter. Whilst assigned to write and edit the Freemans in-house publications, she met Paul Howie, an Australian fashion buyer and designer, whom she later married.

==Lynne Franks PR==
Following a brief period as a PR assistant, at the encouragement of the fashion designer Katharine Hamnett, Franks started her own PR agency at the age of 21. Her first clients included Hamnett&#x27;s own fashion business, Tuttabankem, and Wendy Dagworthy. Working initially from her home, the new agency then moved to the Covent Garden area of London. The agency subsequently worked with high street brands including Harvey Nichols and Tommy Hilfiger, and represented individuals such as Jean-Paul Gaultier, Annie Lennox, Lenny Henry and Ruby Wax. Franks PR also worked briefly with the Labour Party in 1986.

In 1984 Franks used her relationship with the Murjani Corporation (owners of Gloria Vanderbilt jeans) to persuade them to sponsor a large fashion tent outside the Commonwealth Institute in Kensington. This helped to grow the then fledgling London Fashion Week.

In October 1993, she stepped down as chairperson to concentrate on broadcasting.

It has been claimed that the character Edina Monsoon in the British sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, created by Jennifer Saunders, a former client of Franks, was intended to be a satirised version of Franks during this period. The claim has been denied by both Franks and Saunders.

==Later work==
In July 1995, Franks chaired a consortium that launched Viva! 963, Britain&#x27;s first radio station for women, with Franks herself hosting a twice-weekly interview show entitled Frankly Speaking.

In 1997, Franks published her autobiography, &quot;Absolutely Now!: A Futurist&#x27;s Journey to Her Inner Truth,&quot; describing Franks&#x27; emotional and spiritual journey since leaving the world of PR, including her spiritual experiences at locations such as the Findhorn Foundation in Scotland and the Esalen Institute in California and her ideas on feminism, environmental issues and ethical business practices.

Following the book&#x27;s publication, Franks moved to California, and formed GlobalFusion, a cause-related marketing agency, working to promote environmentally-friendly fashion and cosmetic brands and helping to launch &quot;The Big Issue&quot; in Los Angeles.

In July 2011, Franks was awarded an honorary doctorate from Middlesex University in recognition of her career achievements in business and the media.

==SEED==
Whilst in California, Franks developed the idea of SEED, an acronym for Sustainable Enterprise and Empowerment Dynamics, the principles for which she described in her book published in 2000, &quot;The SEED Handbook: The Feminine Way to Create Business.&quot; Franks later published &quot;Grow: The Modern Woman&#x27;s Handbook&quot; and &quot;Bloom: A Woman&#x27;s Journal for Inspired Living.&quot;

In collaboration with Tribal Education, Franks developed the SEED Women into Enterprise Programme, a blended learning course for self-employment. Aimed particularly at women from disadvantaged communities around the UK, the programme has been delivered through local government agencies, training companies and charities. In 2009, she launched the SEED Community Site, a social networking website to connect women entrepreneurs around the world.

She was a member of the advisory board for McDonald&#x27;s in the UK, helping to initiate their Women&#x27;s Leadership Development Programme and worked with Regus to create and develop the &quot;B.Hive&quot; network of women&#x27;s business clubs. 

==V-Day campaign==
Franks was the chair of V-Day UK, a charity created by Eve Ensler, that campaigns to end violence against women and girls. In March 2009, she organised a Women of Influence Lunch at the House of Lords, to draw attention to the campaign. 

The following November, Franks organised the Great Congo Demonstration at the Royal Albert Hall calling for an end to the systemic sexual violence against women in the region.

<doc id="808418" wikidata="Q1327677" url="?curid=808418" title="Black cat">
<text>A black cat is a domestic cat with black fur. They may be a specific breed, or a common domestic cat of no particular or mixed breed. Most black cats have golden irises due to their high melanin pigment content. Black cats are the subject of myth, legend, and superstition. They are often associated with witches and good or bad luck in European folklore.

The Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) recognizes 22 cat breeds that can come with solid black coats. The Bombay breed is exclusively black.

== Coat ==
Any cat whose fur is a single color, including black, is known as a &quot;solid&quot; or &quot;self&quot;. A &quot;solid black&quot; cat may be coal black, grayish black, or brownish black. Most solid-colored cats result from a recessive gene that suppresses the tabby pattern. Sometimes the tabby pattern is not completely suppressed; faint markings may appear in certain lights, even on a solid black cat. A cat having black fur with white roots is known as a &quot;black smoke&quot;.

Black cats can also &quot;rust&quot; in sunlight, the coat turning a lighter brownish-red shade. Eumelanin, the pigment required to produce the black fur, is somewhat fragile, so the rusting effect can be more pronounced in cats that frequently spend time in the sun. A rarer situation that can also cause rusting is a deficiency of the amino acid tyrosine, which is required to produce eumelanin.

In addition to the Bombay, the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association allows solid black as a color option in 21 other breeds. The color description for those breeds is:

:&quot;Black&quot;: dense coal black, sound from roots to tip of fur. Free from any tinge of rust on the ends. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.

The exceptions are:
* Oriental – &quot;Ebony&quot;: dense coal black. Free from any tinge of rust on tips or smoke undercoat. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.
* Sphynx – &quot;Black&quot;: black. One level tone from nose to tip of the tail. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.
* Ragamuffin – Although black is not specifically mentioned, the standard allows for &quot;any color, with or without white&quot;, so technically speaking, an all-black Ragamuffin would be allowed under the breed standard.

== Historical associations ==
=== As a positive omen in Britain and Ireland ===
The superstitions surrounding black cats vary from culture to culture, and black cats have positive associations in the Celtic nations and England, where a black cat crossing your path is considered good luck. In 2014, the animal welfare organisation RSPCA stated that &quot;in UK folklore, black cats symbolise good luck&quot;. Scottish lore holds that a black cat&#x27;s arrival at a new home signifies prosperity, while Welsh lore states that a black cat brings good health:

The Gaels had traditions of feral and sometimes malevolent black cats. In Scottish mythology, a fairy known as the Cat sìth takes the form of a black cat with a white spot on its chest.

=== Superstition, folklore, bringer of good or bad luck ===
Black cats are often a symbol of Halloween or witchcraft.

In the present day many Westerners, including Christian clergy, have black cats as pets, and very few people attach superstitions to them anymore.

In contrast, the supernatural powers ascribed to black cats were sometimes viewed positively; for example, sailors considering a &quot;ship&#x27;s cat&quot; would want a black one because it would bring good luck. Sometimes, fishermen&#x27;s wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea.

In the folklore of Chiloé of southern Chile, black cats are an important element that is needed when treasure hunting for the treasure of the carbunclo.

In Japan, black cats are good luck and are connected with the god Maneki-neko. Scottish culture associates black cats with prosperity and the goddess Brigid. In Latvia, black cats on farms mean prosperity and a good harvest. In Italy black cats mean upcoming good luck. In Germany, a black cat walking left to right is good luck. In Thailand, black cats are considered auspicious and bring prosperity to their owners. According to the Tamra Maew, a guidebook to cats from the Ayutthaya period, there are as many as 9 breeds of black cats.

In the early days of television in the United States, many stations located on VHF channel 13 used a black cat as a mascot in order to make sport of being located on an &quot;unlucky&quot; channel number.

=== Anarcho-syndicalism ===

Since the 1880s, the color black has been associated with anarchism. The black cat, in an alert, fighting stance was later adopted as an anarchist symbol.

More specifically, the black cat—sometimes called the &quot;sab cat&quot; or &quot;sabo-tabby&quot;—is associated with anarcho-syndicalism, a branch of anarchism that focuses on labor organizing, including the use of wildcat strikes and direct action tactics.

According to Ralph Chaplin, who is generally credited with creating the International Workers of the World&#x27;s black cat symbol, &quot;My &#x27;Sab Cat&#x27; was supposed to symbolize the &#x27;slow down&#x27; as a means of &#x27;striking on the job&#x27;,&quot; although others in the IWW used the symbol much more broadly. In testimony before the court in a 1918 trial of Industrial Workers of the World leaders, Chaplin stated that the black cat &quot;was commonly used by the boys as representing the idea of sabotage. The idea being to frighten the employer by the mention of the name &quot;sabotage&quot;, or by putting a black cat somewhere around. You know if you saw a black cat go across your path you would think, if you were superstitious, You are going to have a little bad luck. The idea of sabotage is to use a little black cat on the boss.&quot;

=== Space Shuttle program ===

When the Space Shuttle program naming system for missions was reworked to avoid a Space Transportation System (STS)-13, some sourced this to superstition and Apollo 13. The crew for what would have been STS-13 (which turned out to be STS-41C) made a humorous mission patch that included a black cat and a number 13. The mission was successful and even landed on Friday the 13th.

== Notable black cats ==

The UK Government has adopted several cats from Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home as mousers. Gladstone is known as the Chief Mouser of HM Treasury. India, also known as Willie, was a presidential cat owned by George W. Bush and Laura Bush who lived with them at the White House.

Trim sailed with Matthew Flinders as he mapped the coastline of Australia between 1801 and 1803. Trim now accompanies him on several statues in Australia and England. Hodge (fl. ) was a cat belonging to Samuel Johnson. Most of what is known about Hodge comes from James Boswell&#x27;s biography and a statue of Hodge stands outside Dr Johnson&#x27;s House.

Oscar the &quot;bionic&quot; cat had his back legs sliced off by a combine harvester whilst sleeping in a field in Jersey. He was flown to the UK and received prosthetic limbs in an innovative operation in 2010.

== Adoption and Black Cat Day == 
There is a common myth that black cats are the least likely to be adopted from animal shelters. However, this is untrue, and the ASPCA has said that black cats are adopted at a higher rate than cats with any other coat color. 

Some shelters suspend or limit adoptions of black cats around Halloween for fear they will be tortured, or used as &quot;living decorations&quot; for the holiday and then abandoned. Despite this, no one has ever documented in the history of humane work any relationship between adopting black cats and cats being killed or injured. When such killings are reported, forensic evidence has pointed to natural predators, such as coyotes, eagles, or raptors as the likely cause. Limiting or suspending adoptions around Halloween also places more cats of all colors at risk of dying in shelters due to overcrowding.

October 27 has been designated &#x27;Black Cat Day&#x27; by Cats Protection in the United Kingdom, to celebrate the virtues of black cats and to encourage people to adopt an unwanted black cat. Cats Protection&#x27;s own figures suggest that black cats are more difficult for them to find a new home for than other colors. In 2014, the RSPCA reported that 70% of the abandoned cats in its care were black, saying that though black cats symbolise good luck in UK folklore, one reason for the high percentage of black cats in its care was that black cats tend not to photograph as well.

In the United States, August 17 is &quot;Black Cat Appreciation Day&quot;. Wayne H. Morris created the day in honor of his late sister, June, who had a black cat, Sinbad. The day was chosen in memorial of June&#x27;s passing.

In 2014 Toronto, Canada&#x27;s largest city, held an event on Black Friday during which people could adopt a black cat without paying the usual $75 adoption fee, in order to encourage the adoption of black cats. This trend has now spread across the United States, with many shelters offering free adoption of black cats on Black Friday.

With the success of the 2018 African-themed superhero film, &quot;Black Panther&quot;, there was a fad of adopting black domestic cats as pets and naming them after various characters of the film, such as T&#x27;Challa and Shuri. It has been observed that usually people were not going out of their way to follow this fad, but visited animal shelters to simply adopt a pet under normal circumstances and were inspired by the Black Panther to adopt a black cat when they see one. Regardless, as much as this was a welcome development for pets that are difficult to get adopted, to reduce the chance of such cats being abandoned when the fad fades, reputable animal shelter personnel took the usual precautions of having potential adopters fill out questionnaires to weed out potentially abusive guardians and have them read literature about the needs and responsibilities of such a pet to dissuade the less conscientious.

<text>The Sword of Shannara is a 1977 epic fantasy novel by American writer Terry Brooks. It is the first book in a titular trilogy.

The novel interweaves two major plots into a fictional world called The Four Lands. One follows the protagonist Shea Ohmsford on his quest to gain the Sword of Shannara and use it to confront the Warlock Lord (the antagonist). The other plot shadows Prince Balinor Buckhannah&#x27;s attempt to oust his insane brother Palance from the throne of Callahorn while the country and its capital (Tyrsis) come under attack from overwhelming armies of the Warlock Lord. The novel contains themes of mundane heroism and nuclear holocaust throughout.

Brooks wrote &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; over seven years, during which time he also attended law school. Ballantine Books published the novel and used it to launch the company&#x27;s new subsidiary, Del Rey Books. The success of &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; significantly boosted the commercial prospects of the fantasy literary genre. Critics derided the novel for being derivative of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Some accused Brooks of lifting the entire plot and many of his characters directly from Tolkien&#x27;s work; others praised its execution despite the lack of originality.

== Plot ==
=== Background ===

Two thousand years before the events of the plot, a nuclear holocaust known as the &quot;Great Wars&quot; ended mankind&#x27;s hegemony on Earth. These wars rearranged the planet&#x27;s geography and wiped out 90% of the human population. Only traces of technological artifacts have been found; most advanced technology has been lost, but magic has been rediscovered. During this time, Mankind mutated into several distinct races: humans, dwarves, gnomes and trolls, all named after creatures from &quot;age-old&quot; myths. Also, elves begin to emerge after having been in seclusion and hiding for centuries. Man retreats southward while the other races settle elsewhere: the dwarves in the east, the gnomes in the hills of the northeast, the trolls in the north and the elves in the west. Due to this distribution, the territories, which roughly correspond to the Northwestern United States, are called the Four Lands.

A thousand years later, an Elf named Galaphile gathers all of the people who still hold some knowledge of the old world to the citadel of Paranor. Naming themselves the First Druid Council, they try to bring peace and order to all of the races. The rogue Druid Brona departs with his followers and the Ildatch, a magical tome that controls their minds. Hundreds of years later, Brona convinces all Men to attack the other races, triggering the First War of the Races. Although nearly victorious, he is ultimately defeated by the council and disappears. The Druids divide the Four Lands among the races and become reclusive, withdrawing to Paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members.

Several centuries after the First War of the Races, Brona returns as the Warlock Lord, now with Skull Bearers as his servants. Chronicled in the prequel novel &quot;First King of Shannara&quot;, the Second War of the Races begins with the destruction of the Druid Order. A lone Druid, Bremen, forges a magical talisman to destroy the Warlock Lord; it is given to the Elven King, Jerle Shannara. As it takes the form of a blade, the talisman is named the &quot;Sword of Shannara&quot;. It succeeds in banishing the Warlock Lord. He is not killed, but his army is defeated by the combined armies of the Elves and Dwarves. Peace comes at a high price: interracial tension is renewed and the Druids have vanished.

=== Story ===
Five centuries later, Allanon, the last remaining Druid, arrives at the Ohmsford family inn in the Southland town of Shady Vale. He warns Shea, a half-elf adopted by the Ohmsfords, that the Warlock King has returned to the Skull Kingdom in the Northland and is coming for Shea. As the last descendant of Jerle Shannara, Shea is the only one who can wield the Sword of Shannara against the Warlock Lord. Allanon departs, leaving Shea three Blue Elfstones for protection. A few weeks later, the Callahorn prince Balinor Buckhannah arrives and tells Shea that the Warlock Lord&#x27;s servants are pursuing him. Shea and his adopted brother Flick flee with a Skull Bearer on their trail. They take refuge in the nearby city of Leah where they find Shea&#x27;s friend Menion, the son of the city&#x27;s lord. Menion decides to accompany the two, and they travel to Culhaven to meet with Allanon and Balinor.

The council at Culhaven, which also includes the elven brothers Durin and Dayel Elessedil and the dwarf Hendel, assesses the Warlock King&#x27;s current threat and decide to recover the Sword of Shannara from Paranor. During the party&#x27;s trek to Paranor, they are beset by earthquakes, causing the path to crumble and sending the panicked Shea plummeting over a waterfall. His companions reach Paranor without him and engage in battle with minions of the Warlock Lord, only to find that the Sword of Shannara has already been removed. Learning of the Warlock Lord&#x27;s invasion of the Southland, the party decides to split up, with some going to mobilize armies and others conducting a search for Shea.

After being captured by gnomes, Shea is rescued by the one-handed thief Panamon Creel and his mute Troll companion Keltset Mallicos. Journeying to the Northland, they reach the Skull Kingdom and pursue the insane Gnome deserter Orl Fane, who has carried the Sword of Shannara. Meanwhile, a disguised Flick infiltrates an enemy camp and rescues the captive Elven King, Eventine Elessedil; at the same time, in Kern, Menion saves a woman named Shirl Ravenlock and makes love to her. They organize an evacuation of Kern before the Northland army reaches the city.

Balinor returns to Tyrsis to activate the Border Legion only to find that it has been disbanded. Balinor is then imprisoned by his brother Palance Buckhannah, who has taken control of Callahorn&#x27;s rule. His advisor, Stenmin, has driven Palance mad with poisoned food, making him his pawn. With help from Menion, Balinor escapes and confronts Palance and Stenmin. Cornered, Stenmin kills Palance as a distraction and flees. Now commanded by Balinor, Callahorn&#x27;s reformed Border Legion marches out of Tyrsis and engages the Northland army at the Mermiddon River, killing many Northlanders before being forced to pull back; the Border Legion retreats to Tyrsis and makes preparations for defense.

During the siege of Tyrsis, Hendel and Menion come upon Stenmin and some of his supporters in an underground passage. Hendel is killed, but Menion kills Stenmin and closes the passage. After three days, the Border Legion is beaten back from the Outer Wall of Tyrsis as a result of treachery—the wall falls when the traitors destroy the locks on the main gate, jamming it open. At the defenders&#x27; last stand on the Bridge of Sendic, the Northlanders abruptly break and run.

Infiltrating the Warlock Lord&#x27;s fortress in the Skull Mountain, Shea seizes the sword and learns of its true power: those touched by it are confronted with the truth about their lives. The Warlock Lord materializes and tries to destroy Shea. Although immune to physical weapons, the Warlock Lord is subjected to the sword&#x27;s power and forced to confront the truth about himself: he had deluded himself into believing that he is immortal, but this is impossible. Faced with this paradox, the Warlock Lord is destroyed.

Without its master, the Skull Kingdom crumbles, during which Keltset sacrifices himself to save his companions. In the south, the Northland army retreats after the Warlock Lord&#x27;s downfall. Allanon saves Shea&#x27;s life and reveals himself as Bremen&#x27;s centuries-old son. Shea reunites with his companions in Tyrsis as peace returns to the Four Lands. Balinor takes up his country&#x27;s rule, while Dayel and Durin return to the Westland, and Menion returns to Leah with Shirl. Shea and Flick reunite and return to Shady Vale.

== Characters ==

=== Main characters ===
* Shea Ohmsford, the protagonist, Flick&#x27;s adopted brother and the only remaining descendant of Jerle Shannara. Shea must find an ancient magical sword, the Sword of Shannara, and use it to destroy the antagonist, the Warlock Lord. A major theme of this novel revolves around Shea—part of his quest includes finding a belief in himself. This is a search that every subsequent Brooks protagonist must undergo.
* Flick Ohmsford, Shea&#x27;s adopted brother.
* Menion Leah, a friend of Shea and the Prince of the small country of Leah.
* Balinor Buckhannah, the Crown Prince of the country of Callahorn and the charismatic commander of the Border Legion.
* Allanon, the last Druid of Paranor. Allanon has been described as a parallel to Merlin from Arthurian legend.
* Hendel, a taciturn Dwarf warrior.
* Durin and Dayel Elessedil, a pair of elven brothers who are cousins to King Eventine. The elder brother Durin is calm and inspires confidence, and the younger brother Dayel is gentle and shy.

=== Supporting characters ===
* Panamon Creel, a one-handed &quot;con-man&quot; wanderer whose left hand is now an iron pike. The inspiration for his character came directly from Rupert of Hentzau from &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, by Anthony Hope.
* Keltset Mallicos, Panamon&#x27;s mute troll companion.
* Palance Buckhannah, the brother of Balinor Buckhannah and a prince of Callahorn.
* Shirl Ravenlock, the daughter of an elder on the governing council of Kern, and a descendant of royal blood. She is one of only two women to appear directly in the book, with the other being the Siren.
* Shade of Bremen, the deceased father of Allanon. He resides in a lake called the Hadeshorn, just outside of the Hall of Kings.
* Eventine Elessedil, the king of the elves. He was captured by the gnome and troll army of Brona.
* Stenmin, a traitor to Callahorn now working for the Warlock Lord.
* Brona (the Warlock Lord), the former Druid and antagonist of the novel. In days long ago, Brona was a Druid before he was subverted by dark magic.
* Skull Bearers, &quot;winged black destroyers&quot; who sacrificed their humanity to become the Warlock Lord&#x27;s most trusted servants.
* Orl Fane, a &quot;Gollum-like&quot; Gnome who &quot;covets the Sword as Gollum does the ring.&quot;

== Development ==
Brooks began writing &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; in 1967 when he was twenty-three years old. He started writing the novel to challenge himself and as a way of staying &quot;sane&quot; while he attended law school at Washington and Lee University. Brooks had been a writer since high school, but he had never found &#x27;his&#x27; genre: &quot;I tried my hand at science fiction, westerns, war stories, you name it. All those efforts ... weren&#x27;t very good.&quot; When he was starting college, he was given a copy of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to read for the first time. From then on, Brooks knew that he had found a genre he could write in. Writing &quot;Sword&quot; took seven years, as Brooks worked on it only sporadically while also completing his law school courses and rewrote it many times.

Brooks initially submitted his manuscript to DAW Books, whose editor Donald A. Wollheim rejected it and recommended submission to Judy-Lynn del Rey at Ballantine Books instead. Ballantine Books accepted &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; in November 1974. Brooks&#x27; editor was Lester del Rey, who used the book to launch Ballantine&#x27;s new Del Rey Books imprint/subsidiary. Del Rey chose it because he felt that it was &quot;the first long epic fantasy adventure which had any chance of meeting the demands of Tolkien readers for similar pleasures.&quot;

In 1977, &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; was simultaneously released as a trade paperback by Ballantine Books and hardback by Random House. The Brothers Hildebrandt, who had previously done illustration work for the work of Tolkien, were asked to make the cover. Greg Hildebrandt remembers the Del Reys as being &quot;obsessed with the project. It was their baby.&quot; The novel was a commercial success, becoming the first fantasy fiction novel to appear on &quot;The New York Times&quot; trade paperback bestseller list.

The original inspiration for &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; was Brooks&#x27; desire to put &quot;Tolkien&#x27;s magic and fairy creatures [into] the worlds of Walter Scott and [Alexander] Dumas&quot;. Brooks was inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and adventure fiction such as Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The White Company&quot; and Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;.

Brooks decided not to use historical settings like these works. He instead followed Tolkien&#x27;s use of a fantasy setting:

He admits that he was very influenced by &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; when writing it, being his first novel. However, Brooks has said that he has since evolved his own style :

Brooks also made decisions about his novel&#x27;s characterization and use of magic, saying that the magic &quot;couldn&#x27;t be dependable or simply good or bad&quot;. Also, he wanted to blur the distinctions between good and evil, &quot;because life simply [doesn&#x27;t] work that way.&quot; He wanted to ensure that readers would identify with his protagonist, Shea, which he accomplished by casting Shea as &quot;a person simply trying to muddle through&quot;.

== Major themes ==
&quot;Ordinary men placed in extraordinary circumstances&quot; is a prevalent theme in &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot;. Brooks credits Tolkien with introducing this theme of mundane heroism into fantasy literature and influencing his own fiction. &quot;[M]y protagonists are cut from the same bolt of cloth as Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. It was Tolkien&#x27;s genius to reinvent the traditional epic fantasy by making the central character neither God nor hero, but a simple man in search of a way to do the right thing. ... I was impressed enough by how it had changed the face of epic fantasy that I never gave a second thought to not using it as the cornerstone of my own writing.&quot;

&quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; is set in a post-apocalyptic Earth, where chemical and nuclear holocaust devastated the land in the distant past. Due to the numerous references in &quot;Sword&quot; to this catastrophe, Brooks was asked a question about whether he thought that his &#x27;prediction&#x27; might come true. He answered:

Environment plays a role in all of the &quot;Shannara&quot; novels: &quot;Environment is a character in my story and almost always plays a major role in affecting the story&#x27;s outcome. I have always believed that fantasy, in particular, because it takes place in an imaginary world with at least some imaginary characters, needs to make the reader feel at home in the setting. That means bringing the setting alive for the reader, which is what creating environment as a character is really all about.&quot; However, Brooks believes that &quot;Sword&quot; was more about behavioral issues and personal sacrifice.

== Literary significance and reception ==
&quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; received mixed reviews following its publication, most of which remarked on its similarity to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. &quot;Choice&quot; stated that the novel was &quot;exceptionally well-written, very readable&quot; and &quot;will be accepted by most teenagers.&quot; Marshall F. Tymn also thought that it contained quality prose. Tymn believed that &quot;Sword&quot; followed &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; too closely, but he also cited some of the differences, such as the use of a post-holocaust setting with the races which sprang from it, and an &quot;unexpected ending springing from the nature of the sword.&quot; Cathi Dunn MacRae felt that his strength was &quot;his plot&#x27;s momentum, maintained through cliffhangers&quot; and &quot;unexpected twists of fortune&quot;.

=== Similarities with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===

&quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; has drawn extensive criticism from critics who believe that Brooks derived too much of his novel from Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In 1978, American fantasy editor Lin Carter denounced &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; as &quot;the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read&quot;. He further wrote that &quot;Terry Brooks wasn&#x27;t trying to imitate Tolkien&#x27;s prose, just steal his story line and complete cast of characters, and he did it with such clumsiness and so heavy-handedly, that he virtually rubbed your nose in it.&quot; Roger C. Schlobin was kinder in his assessment, though he still thought that &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; was a disappointment because of its similarities to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Brian Attebery accused &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; of being &quot;undigested Tolkien&quot; which was &quot;especially blatant in its point-for-point correspondence&quot; with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In an educational article on writing, author Orson Scott Card cited &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; as a cautionary example of overly derivative writing, finding the work &quot;artistically displeasing&quot; for this reason.

Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that the novel is distinctive for &quot;the dogged way in which it follows Tolkien point for point&quot;. Shippey located analogues for Tolkien characters within Brooks&#x27; novel, such as Sauron (Brona), Gandalf (Allanon), the Hobbits (Shea and Flick), Aragorn (Menion), Boromir (Balinor), Gimli (Hendel), Legolas (Durin and Dayel), Gollum (Orl Fane), the Barrow-wight (Mist Wraith), the Nazgûl (Skull Bearers), and Tom Bombadil (King of the Silver River), among others. He also found plot similarities to events in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, such as the Fellowship of the Ring&#x27;s formation and adventures, the journeys to Rivendell (Culhaven) and Lothlórien (Storlock), Gandalf&#x27;s (Allanon) fall in Moria (Paranor) and subsequent reappearance, and the Rohirrim&#x27;s arrival at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields (Battle of Tyrsis), among others. Shippey attributes the book&#x27;s success to the post-Tolkien advent of the fantasy genre: &quot;What &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; seems to show is that many readers had developed the taste ... for heroic fantasy so strongly that if they could not get the real thing they would take any substitute, no matter how diluted.&quot;

Terry Brooks has said that Tolkien&#x27;s works were a major influence in his writing, though he has also said that Tolkien was not his only influence. Other influences included his editor Lester del Rey, as well as the many different books which he had read over his life. Brooks was also inspired by the mythology and ancient civilizations that he had learned about in school.

Author Gene Wolfe defended Brooks&#x27; derivation of material from Tolkien in a 2001 &quot;Interzone&quot; essay: &quot;Terry Brooks has often been disparaged for imitating Tolkien, particularly by those reviewers who find his books inferior to Tolkien&#x27;s own. I can say only that I wish there were more imitators—we need them—and that all imitations of so great an original must necessarily be inferior.&quot; &quot;Dune&quot; author Frank Herbert also defended Brooks: &quot;Brooks demonstrates that it doesn&#x27;t matter where you get the idea; what matters is that you tell a rousing story.&quot;

John Batchelor feels that it was the weakest of the 1977 surge in fantasy, ranking it below Stephen R. Donaldson&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever&quot;, Seamus Cullen&#x27;s &quot;Astra and Flondrix&quot;, and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, edited by Christopher Tolkien, while commenting that it &quot;unabashedly copies&quot; &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; feels that &quot;Sword&quot; embodies the Tolkien spirit and tradition but is quite able to stand apart from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.

=== Book impact ===
&quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; sold about 125,000 copies in its first year in print, and this success provided a major boost to the fantasy genre. Louise J. Winters writes that &quot;until &quot;Shannara&quot;, no fantasy writer except J. R. R. Tolkien had made such an impression on the general public.&quot; Critic David Pringle said that Brooks &quot;demonstrated in 1977 that the commercial success of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; had not been a fluke, and that fantasy really did have the potential to become a mass-market genre&quot;. Stephen R. Donaldson&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever&quot; and &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; ushered in &quot;the era of the big commercial fantasy&quot; and helped make epic fantasy the leading fantasy subgenre. &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; and its sequels helped inspire later versions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

== Television adaptation ==
The Shannara books were to be adapted by Mike Newell, the director of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire;&quot; however, he left the project. The books eventually were adapted for television by Farah Films and executive produced by Brooks, Dan Farah, and Stewart Till. They began with &quot;Elfstones&quot;, intending to leave &quot;Sword&quot; for a later date. &quot;The Shannara Chronicles&quot; premiered on American television network MTV on January 5, 2016.

<doc id="808429" wikidata="Q497989" url="?curid=808429" title="Montserrat national football team">
<text>The Montserrat national football team represents Montserrat in international football. Football is the second most popular sport in Montserrat, after cricket. The team plays at the Blakes Estate Stadium. The Montserrat football team was formed in 1973, and has entered the World Cup qualifiers since the 2002 edition, being eliminated in the first round on each occasion.

Due to the volcanic activity on the island from 1995 to 2010, the team has only played a handful of matches, and most of those have been away from home. Their only victories were against neighboring Anguilla in the qualifying tournament of the 1995 Caribbean Cup, winning 3–2 at home and 1–0 away. Apart from one draw against Anguilla, all their other matches before 2018 were losses. Since then, however, Montserrat has proven more competitive.

On 30 June 2002, the day of the 2002 World Cup final, Montserrat, then the lowest ranked team in the world, played against the second lowest ranked team, Bhutan, in a friendly match known as &quot;The Other Final&quot;; losing 4–0. The game took place in Bhutan in front of a crowd of 15,000.

==History==
The Montserrat national team is one of the newest in international football, having played its first senior match on 10 May 1991, during the 1991 Caribbean Cup tournament. The team suffered a 3–0 defeat against Saint Lucia. The team&#x27;s next match was against Anguilla; securing a 1–1 draw. Montserrat once again entered the Caribbean Cup the following year, but were once more knocked out in the group stage, with heavy defeats against Saint Kitts and Nevis and Antigua and Barbuda. They were drawn against the same two teams in the 1994 Caribbean Cup, again being eliminated in the tournament&#x27;s group stage, conceding 17 goals in two matches. In 1994, the Montserrat Football Association (MFA) was formed. Like all other football teams based in the Caribbean, the MFA became a member of CONCACAF.

On 26 March 1995, Montserrat played their first ever home international match. They defeated Anguilla 3–2, thus achieving their first win. The team beat Anguilla again in the next fixture, to ensure progression to the Second Qualifying Round of the 1995 Caribbean Cup. The 1–0 win in the second leg, was their only clean sheet in international football, and their most recent victory for the next seventeen years. The side exited the competition in the next stage, losing 20–0 against Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

Soon afterwards, the Soufrière Hills volcano became active and the eruptions destroyed Plymouth, the capital of Montserrat, severely disrupting life on the island. Despite the lack of football action, the MFA became a member of FIFA in 1996. However, it was a further three years before the Montserrat team played another match. This was mostly because many of the island&#x27;s footballers had emigrated from the area, many of them to England.

After a four-year hiatus, the team entered the 1999 Caribbean Nations Cup. They were knocked out in the preliminary round of the tournament, losing 6–1 to the British Virgin Islands. Due to the volcanic activity on the island, Montserrat had been unable to enter the FIFA World Cup 1998 tournament, so their entry to the 2002 World Cup was their first; but it was not a success as they were defeated 6–1 by the Dominican Republic. In 2001, the MFA visited The Football Association to raise money for a new stadium. Shortly after this the Blakes Estate Stadium was opened. The team&#x27;s next match was on 30 June 2002, the day of the World Cup Final, when Montserrat played Bhutan in a game known as &quot;The Other Final&quot;. The friendly match between the two lowest-ranked teams in the world ended with a 4–0 win for Bhutan in front of 15,000 fans in Thimphu.

Montserrat entered the World Cup qualifiers once more for the 2006 competition, but again lost in the first qualifying round, this time losing 20–0 against Bermuda. Montserrat then competed in the 2005 Caribbean Cup, but once more failed to progress past the preliminary round. In 2008, they were defeated 7–1 by Suriname in the first qualifying round of the 2010 World Cup.

The team played a friendly match against a Network Rail XI on May 19, 2012, ending in a 4–4 draw.

Montserrat achieved their first victory since 1995 and their first ever victory since joining FIFA, beating the British Virgin Islands 7–0 in a 2012 Caribbean Championship qualifying match.

Montserrat&#x27;s fortunes changed dramatically in 2018 with the arrival of Willie Donachie and the launch of the CONCACAF Nations League. The side won three of their four qualifying games, but missed out on qualification for the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup on goal difference. The team went on to take second place in their group in the inaugural season with two wins, draws, and losses each, thus keeping their place in the second tier.

Following Willie Donachie, in 2022 Matt Lockwood took over for a spell as head coach and technical director, supported in March 2023 by assistant coaches Craig Easton and David Preece.
Just months later on September 8, Lee Bowyer took over as the Montserrat manager and Steve Gallen is the assistant. In their first game they beat Barbados with a 99th-minute winner to go second in their CONCACAF Nations League group.

==World rankings==
Due to the team&#x27;s poor results, they have often been at the lower end of the FIFA World Rankings. The loss to Bhutan in &quot;The Other Final&quot; saw them fall to 203rd in the rankings, becoming the worst-ranked side in the world. After the addition of another two teams to FIFA, Montserrat achieved a new low of 205th between July and October 2004. In July 2006, they achieved a record high rank of 196th, but then fell to 198th the following month. Success in the qualifying tournament for the CONCACAF Nations League and the first edition of the league proper saw them rise to 184th.

The team have also languished in the lower reaches of the unofficial World Football Elo Ratings, which ranks teams directly based on their match results.

==Colours==
Since the team&#x27;s first match in 1991, Montserrat have usually worn a first-choice kit of green, either plain green or green and white hoops. Currently, the away kit is a red jersey, shorts and socks.

<text>WPGC-FM (95.5 MHz) is a commercial radio station licensed to Morningside, Maryland, and serving the Washington metropolitan area. It is owned by Audacy, Inc., and airs an urban contemporary format.

WPGC-FM has studios in the Navy Yard neighborhood of Southeast D.C., with its transmitter located off Walker Mill Road at Tanow Place in Capitol Heights, Maryland. In 2005, WPGC began broadcasting in IBOC digital radio, using the HD Radio system from iBiquity. The HD-2 digital subchannel carries a simulcast of WJFK-FM.

==History==

===WBUZ===
The station signed on the air on January 18, 1948, at 7 a.m., on the 96.7 frequency with the WBUZ call letters. WBUZ was owned by Arthur Baldwin Curtis, president of Chesapeake Broadcasting Company, Incorporated, and was located in Bradbury Heights. WBUZ-FM broadcasting at 420 watts effective radiated power. The call letters were a play on the word &quot;bus&quot;, as WBUZ broadcast background music for a Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland based bus company.

In May 1953, WBUZ-FM raised power to 6,300 watts and its city of license was changed to Oakland, Maryland (near District Heights; not the Western Maryland town). Then on June 8, 1953, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted a permit to the station to raise power from 6.3 to 18 kilowatts. WBUZ-FM changed frequency from 96.7 to 95.5 Megahertz and power was reduced to 16.5 kilowatts from a new transmitter and tower site on Walker Mill Road in Oakland. The calls were changed to WRNC on March 30, 1956. By the end of the year, WRNC was simulcasting WPGC (AM). The ERP was reduced to 15.7 kilowatts while the power increase authorized for WPGC (AM) in 1955 to 10,000 watts daytime only.

===Top 40/&quot;Classy 95&quot;===
WPGC-AM, Inc., purchased WRNC in 1956. The calls were changed to WPGC-FM in March 1958. WPGC-FM temporarily went silent until February 1959, as new studios were being constructed for the top 40 format. Though the calls have always stood for Prince George&#x27;s County for the county Morningside resides in, during the 70s and early 80s an alternate contest slogan had them standing for &quot;Where People Get Cash&quot; on-air.

WPGC-FM maintained some form of the top 40 format (skewed from rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll-based to adult contemporary) until 1984, when it flipped to easy listening/adult contemporary. For two years, the station took the calls WCLY and was known on-air as &quot;Classy 95&quot;.
===Hip hop/R&amp;B===
&quot;Classy 95&quot; ended up being a failure, and First Media sold its stations off to Cook Inlet Radio Partners, a group of Alaska Natives for $177 million in 1987. Cook Inlet returned the WPGC-FM calls on the weekend after Memorial Day on May 30, 1987. The first song under the new format was &quot;Jam On It&quot; by Newcleus, and the new CHR format with an urban lean became much more popular. The station was initially branded &quot;WPGC, 95 Jams&quot;. In the early 2000s, the branding reverted to simply &quot;WPGC 95.5&quot;, dropping the &quot;Jams&quot; moniker from the brand, although it still visibly remained on the station&#x27;s logo. In August 2009, the station rebranded again to &quot;95-5 PGC&quot;.

Donnie Simpson hosted &quot;The Donnie Simpson Morning Show&quot; during the morning drive from March 1993 to January 29, 2010.

Infinity Broadcasting acquired the station and sister station WPGC from Cook Inlet in June 1994 for $60 million. The stations moved to new studios and offices at 4200 Parliament Place, Suite 300 in Lanham, Maryland, in the summer of 2000. In January 2006 owner Viacom split into two companies, Viacom and CBS, and the Infinity Broadcasting name was dropped in favor of CBS Radio.

WPGC announced they were moving their studios from Parliament Place in Lanham in suburban Maryland to the Navy Yard neighborhood in southeast DC on March 26, 2015.

On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.

===Programming history===
Similar to other long-time rhythmic turned urban stations including KMEL in San Francisco and WQHT in New York, WPGC has evolved into a full-service urban contemporary station that is still monitored by Nielsen BDS as a rhythmic. WPGC-FM also has been a debated topic amongst radio experts about its format classification as a Rhythmic Contemporary Hit radio station even though it really operates musically and programmed as an Urban Contemporary. In 1987, when the current format on WPGC was introduced it was a mix of R&amp;B, hip-hop, dance and pop titles. This came at a time when many radio stations took on the &quot;crossover&quot;-based format for the first time as Emmis Communications pioneered it on KPWR in Los Angeles and WQHT in New York upon acquiring those stations. In the case of Washington, D.C., the new format niched in well with established R&amp;B stations WKYS, WMMJ and WOL as well as top 40 stations (at the time) WRQX and WAVA-FM.

By 1997, following the departure of longtime assistant program director/music director and afternoon host Albie Dee, its playlist consisted mainly of R&amp;B and hip-hop titles. Many critics say the ability to attract more mainstream advertisers as Rhythmic, rather than Urban, is the real reason. By the early 2000s, WPGC was regularly airing go-go, a local sub-genre of funk, soul, and R&amp;B, made popular by live performers including Chuck Brown, Experience Unlimited, and Rare Essence in local clubs and performance venues.

In June 2009, speculation began circulating that WPGC might be evolving towards a Top 40/CHR direction or back to its former urban-leaning Rhythmic format similar to sister station WZMX. The move might have been fueled by the recent drop in the ratings and in part due to the introduction of PPMs in the market, where it has hurt them audience-wise. However, WPGC remained an urban, albeit a Mainstream Urban (in terms of programming and music playlist, although still basically considered a rhythmic), that focuses primarily on the current urban hits with some recurrents and throwbacks mixed into its playlist.

In December 2010, WPGC began to open up its playlist to include songs that they wouldn&#x27;t have touched, i.e. &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot; from Bruno Mars. This issue of whether WPGC might be shifting to a broader Rhythmic sound continued to be debated on message boards like Radio-Info. Even though WPGC-FM was still considered as a rhythmic, it added more rhythmic-friendly tracks but reduced the urban lean from 2010 to 2018.

From 1992 to 1997, WPGC was an original member of the BDS Rhythmic Top 40 panel, when it was moved to BDS&#x27;s R&amp;B/Hip-Hop reporting panel in 1997. It was the only Rhythmic owned by then CBS Radio that was not listed on the Nielsen BDS rhythmic panel. From 1997 to 2012, Nielsen BDS placed WPGC-FM on the urban panel, while it remained on the rhythmic panel on Mediabase, as Radio One&#x27;s WKYS is its competitor, but is an urban contemporary station. On June 13, 2012, WPGC returned to the Nielsen BDS Rhythmic Top 40 panel after 15 years. CBS Radio moved WPGC to the Rhythmic panel from the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop panel due to WPGC becoming more of a hit-driven Rhythmic Top 40 that is more in line with their other Rhythmic outlets and to be more competitive with Top 40/CHR rival WIHT. However, it retained a heavy urban lean to programming when compared to most rhythmic-formatted stations on the panel. Ironically, they were also the second CBS Radio Rhythmic outlet on the BDS Rhythmic panel with a R&amp;B/Hip-Hop direction, the other being WZMX-Hartford, Connecticut.

WPGC is considered the 2nd largest and co-flagship (along with WVEE) owned by Audacy within its urban/rhythmic division, based on market size (Washington, DC #8). Until August 2012, CBS Radio did list WPGC as an urban on their corporate listings, but by 2012, it was programmed as a hybrid of both formats. As a result, Atlanta (market rank #7) sister station, WVEE, is considered the largest urban station from 2012 to 2018 and again in 2023, but WVEE is still the co-flagship of the company&#x27;s urban/rhythmic division. As of January 2018, Audacy does list WPGC-FM as an urban on their station listings, making WPGC an urban station once again.

As of April 2021, Mediabase does monitor WPGC-FM as an urban on its weekly station panel.

==Current programming==

Currently, WPGC is musically programmed as a hit-driven, full-service, urban contemporary station that spins a heavy concentration of mainly contemporary hip-hop, soul, go-go and R&amp;B music with numerous urban music throwbacks throughout the day and an occasional crossover pop hit song. The station directly competes with urban contemporary rival WKYS and urban adult contemporary rivals WMMJ and WHUR full-time, and to a lesser extent the station competes with contemporary hit radio rival WIHT. The station airs current and classic R&amp;B and soul slow jams late nights on Sunday through Thursday dubbed &quot;The Coolout&quot;. After many years of only giving occasional spins to urban contemporary gospel music that charted well on the Billboard, the station added a program dedicated to the genre on early Sunday mornings. The station also airs urban and crossover pop music throwbacks on Sunday evenings.

The station&#x27;s signal covers both Washington and Baltimore, so it also competes with Baltimore&#x27;s WERQ, an Urban One-owned urban contemporary station, and to a lesser extent, iHeartMedia&#x27;s WZFT which has a more generic Top 40/CHR format. It is the only Audacy rhythmic/urban in the Eastern United States to use its call letters as a branding on-air (the other two, KSFM in Sacramento and KLUC-FM in Las Vegas, are both in the Western United States).

The station is an official sponsor of the Prince George&#x27;s Film Festival.

==Notable on-air personalities==
* Big Tigger - former personality that hosted the afternoon drive, nights, and morning drive shows various times throughout the 1990s, 2000s through 2011
* Joe Clair – former morning drive host from 2015 to 2021
* Free (rapper) - former morning drive co-host
* Lil&#x27; Mo - former afternoon drive host
* Donnie Simpson - former morning drive show host from 1993 to 2010

===HD programming===

*HD2: In March 2006, WPGC launched a HD2 subchannel, which featured a format geared to local hip-hop and R&amp;B artists under the billing &quot;Crank&quot;. However, by September 2011, the format was replaced with a Dance Top 40 format, billed as &quot;Area 955&quot;. In 2021, the format would be replaced with a simulcast of sister station WJFK-FM.
*HD3 had been a simulcast of WJFK (1580 AM). That service was later discontinued.

<doc id="808450" wikidata="Q101873619" url="?curid=808450" title="Princess Maker">
<text>is a series of social simulation bishōjo games where the player must act as a parental figure and raise a young girl. The series was produced by the video game and anime production company Gainax. The first &quot;Princess Maker&quot;, while popular enough to be translated into Chinese, was never released in the United States. &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot; was translated by SoftEgg for a North American release, but this release was cancelled because publisher Intracorp went bankrupt. &quot;Princess Maker 3&quot;, &quot;Princess Maker 4&quot;, and &quot;Princess Maker 5&quot; have subsequently been released, as did several spin-off games. The series has been translated and released in Korea (Fujitsu) and Taiwan (Kingformation). An English release of &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot; was attempted in mid-90s, but it resulted in failure, and no games in this series were released in English until &quot;Princess Maker 2 Refine&quot; in 2016. &quot;Petite Princess Yucie&quot;, an anime series loosely based on the third game but with characters from all previous games, ran for 26 episodes in 2002–2003.

== Main series ==

=== &quot;Princess Maker&quot; ===
The first of the &quot;Princess Maker&quot; game was a popular MicroCabin game at the time of its release in 1991. It was re-released in a &#x27;Refine Edition&#x27; with enhanced graphics and voices. There is a fan-made English and Spanish translation for the normal MSX version. The original version is for the NEC PC-9801 system, and the Refine Edition is out for the PlayStation 2 as well as Windows.

The player is in charge of a war orphan, Maria, after defeating an evil demon. This game is similar to &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot;, but one cannot give pocket money to the daughter, and in this version, the player can send the daughter to town to view the people&#x27;s opinions of her. The wardrobe is also much larger than the sequel. There are four sets of clothing for each season. These clothes change after aging. Therefore, there are about 28 sets of clothing the daughter can wear over the years. The Harvest Festival has a Combat Tournament and a Miss Kingdom Contest. If the daughter succeeds, her popularity will rise. There are 74 possible endings, ranging from humble jobs such as a soldier or a mason, to prestigious jobs such as Archbishop or Prime Minister, to &quot;dark side&quot; jobs such as prostitute or crime lord. In addition, numerous factors decide whether or not the daughter is successful at her job, whom she marries, and whether she has children of her own.

&quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine&#x27;s Reader Cross Review gave the PC Engine version of the game an 8 out of 10.

===&quot;Princess Maker 2&quot;===

The second game in the series, &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot;, was released in 1993.

===&quot;Princess Maker 3: Fairy Tales Come True&quot;===
Released in 1997, this game was originally revealed in 1994 for a summer 1995 release on PlayStation. It was then unnumbered and called &quot;Princess Maker: Faery Tales Come True&quot;. It was released for the PlayStation, Windows, Dreamcast (as a collection with Princess Maker 2) and Sega Saturn. In 2019, the HD remake of the game was released on Nintendo Switch and PC.

In &quot;Princess Maker 3&quot;, the daughter is a young faery who desires to become a human princess. The player&#x27;s task is to help her reach adulthood. In this version, everything said to the player&#x27;s daughter and done will help determine the daughter&#x27;s attitude, social status, and outlook on life. Unlike the previous game, the player has a chance to choose between six occupations. The occupation determines the player&#x27;s social status in the kingdom, cash at hand, and the amount of yearly wage. The occupation will also affect various factors in the main character, starting with the attitude with which she begins. Along these lines, unlike the previous games where she was either happy, sick, or rebellious, the daughter&#x27;s attitude can range from happy, to average, to worried, to spoiled. Her attitude will be determined based on both the player&#x27;s job starting off (Merchant, Performer, Fallen Nobleman, Priest, Retired Knight, and Bard) and how well is she treated by the player during the game. There are 60 endings in this game ranging from the typical ones like General and Hero, to some more distinctive like Gambler and Freelancer. There are also many &quot;magical&quot; endings, with not only the princess ending, but princess of darkness, cats, etc. She can also marry a variety of people.

The player&#x27;s daughter has a number of courses and jobs available, just like in &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot;. The courses to enhance her status include regular school, ballet class or church. All courses, save for church and fasting sessions, will challenge the daughter with a test/exam based on her status and how long she has dedicated herself to the course. The result of the test/exam will be directly proportional to the daughter&#x27;s status. Once the result is announced, her reaction will depend on her overall status. The daughter&#x27;s reactions vary, and it may or may not have effect on status for better or for worse. For all courses with test/exam, the daughter will have an opportunity to encounter her &quot;rival&quot; depending on the player&#x27;s status related to the course. All courses, save for church and fasting sessions, will offer a unique rival female character. If the status related to the course is high enough, the rival may offer her friendship. Once the friendship is forged, the rival character will bring present on the character&#x27;s birthday that would boost up some of her status depending on what kind of gift it is. They also would occasionally visit the player&#x27;s daughter and hang out, which reduces her stress level and boosts certain personality status. School course is rather unusual as she may get a scholarship offer depending on her academic status.

===&quot;Princess Maker 4&quot;===
Unlike past installments, &quot;Princess Maker 4&quot; was developed by GeneX, although Takami Akai (original series creator) remained on hand as a supervisor. This time, character illustrations were handled by Tenhiro Naoto, the creator of &quot;Sister Princess&quot;. It was released in 2005 on the PlayStation 2.

Structurally, &quot;Princess Maker 4&quot; draws much inspiration from &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot;, although an adventure mode does not exist anymore. As with &quot;PM3&quot;, full voiceovers have been recorded, including contributions from famous voice actors like Sakurai Takahiro (Prince Sharul/Charles). &quot;PM4&quot; is highly drama-oriented. Throughout the game, there are various event scenes that offer clues about the player&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s past, not to mention the war between humans and non-humans and her demonic roots. This is probably what differentiates it the most from previous &quot;PM&quot; games. Another change is that most of the vice-related jobs are less &quot;adult-oriented&quot; as it is impossible for the daughter to receive less reputable jobs such as Cabaret Dancing or as an assassin.

The story begins when the player, a soldier, falls in love with a mysterious woman. However, she disappears, only to be found by him a few years later. She hands him the child, whose default name is Patricia, along with Cube the butler, and so his quest to fatherhood begins.

A Japanese PC version of &quot;Princess Maker 4&quot; was released on July 28, 2006. It contains many more endings and events compared to the original. A PlayStation Portable version of &quot;Princess Maker 4&quot; was released in Japan on October 12, 2006. A Nintendo DS version of it was released with a few more endings and &quot;extras&quot; not released in the PC version. These extras are, like ending galleries, only accessible after finishing the first ending and credit sequence.

Earlier, there was an entirely different &quot;Princess Maker 4&quot; in the works. Under development at Ninelives, the game was to take place in modern Tokyo rather than the medieval world featured in the final game. This project was eventually abandoned due to Akai&#x27;s health issues. However, the concept went on to be the basis of &quot;Princess Maker 5&quot;, including the modern Japan setting and the fact that Cube can transform himself into a dog.

===&quot;Princess Maker 5&quot;===

&quot;Princess Maker 5&quot; released for Windows in 2007.

===&quot;Princess Maker: Legend of Another World&quot;===
This 1995 game shares many similarities with &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot; and was released for the Super NES by Takara. Unlike the other games, the daughter does not have a default name, but is named Melody Blue in &quot;Go! Go! Princess&quot;.

== Anime ==
The anime &quot;Petite Princess Yucie&quot; is loosely based on all the &quot;Princess Maker&quot; games, has the character of Cube from &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot; appearing as Yucie&#x27;s steward in the anime, looking nearly identical in style and design to how he appears in the game. Yucie herself looks almost identical to the character of Lisa from &quot;Princess Maker 3&quot;, including the hairstyle and unusually large forehead. The final &quot;villain&quot; of the anime shares the appearance of Maria, the daughter from &quot;Princess Maker 1&quot;. Ket Shi the demon cat, a minor villain in one episode, is also from &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot;, although in the game he is the god of the Wildcat tribe, and can be helpful to the player rather than harmful. Other characters in &quot;Petite Princess Yucie&quot; can undoubtedly also be found in other &quot;Princess Maker&quot; games.

<text>WRBC is the college radio station of Bates College, located in Lewiston, Maine and at 91.5 MHz on the FM dial. The WRBC studio is located in the basement of 31 Frye Street across from the student coffee house, The Ronj. The WRBC board of directors publish an online music blog called The Monkey.

WRBC is currently ranked by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; as the 12th best college radio station in the United States and Canada, making it the top college radio in the New England Small College Athletic Conference. WRBC was also the Maine headquarters for College Radio Day in October 2012.

==History==
Originally started as an AM station, radio at Bates began with the efforts of rhetoric professor and debate coach Brooks Quimby. A radio enthusiast, he ran his own amateur station, and wrote the FCC in 1942 asking to build a 10-watt radio station on campus. Though his efforts to secure a license were unsuccessful, he did not give up. &quot;Bates On The Air&quot;, a weekly program produced by his Radio Class from studios in Chase Hall, debuted in 1945 on WCOU in Lewiston. This program was also occasionally carried on stations in Portland and Augusta, and continued into the mid-1950s.

===1950s===
In the spring of 1951, interest in a campus radio station resurfaced among the student body. A group of students met to organize and plan for the construction. A professor in the Physics department volunteered to build the transmitting equipment for a carrier current AM station. That fall an organizational meeting drew 150 people. The station, calling itself WVBC (Voice of Bates College), signed on at 9:00 p.m. on Friday evening, November 2, 1951. Broadcasting from the Chase Hall studios, it initially featured a two-hour schedule of programming six nights a week. The signal could be heard at 640 kHz AM in all campus buildings, except the infirmary.

Despite its beginning, technical problems plagued the station in the 1950s. Because of these problems Bates College again applied to the FCC for a 10-watt station on the then relatively new FM band. The staff suggested several possible call signs for the new station to the FCC including WVBC, WBCR, WRBC, WVOB, and WRJR (after the first initials of staff members Ron Cook, Joan Williams Lepper, Ray Hendess, and Robert Kalisher). The FCC decided on the call letters WRJR. The new station took to the public airwaves at 1:00 p.m. on Sunday, October 26, 1958, at 91.5 FM, from purpose-built studios in the basement of Pettigrew Hall.

Despite its technical superiority, FM radio had yet to come into mass acceptance. Since so few people owned FM-capable radios in 1958, FM-to-AM converters were initially installed at strategic locations around the Bates College campus to rebroadcast the signal at 800 AM. However, these converters soon either broke down, or were shut down due to issues with off-campus interference. As a result, WRJR found itself broadcasting to slim audiences, both on campus and off.

===1970s and 1980s===
In the early 1970s, WRJR moved from its purpose-built studio in the basement of Pettigrew to its present quarters in the basement of The Office of Career Services at 31 Frye Street. The new basement location offered multiple studios which have since converted to office space. The station&#x27;s transmitting antenna was also moved to its present location behind its current studios. Though the call letters WRJR had been with the station for many years, they were not immediately interpretable as being related to Bates College. Station managers, including Jonathan Hall - now a television news anchor in Boston - had tried for a number of combinations, including WBCR (Bates College Radio) and WVBC (Voice of Bates College). Then in the late 1970s, an all-news AM station in Jackson, Mississippi, with the call letters WRBC. went silent. The station applied to the FCC for a new call sign, and on April 5, 1981 (the 126th anniversary of Bates&#x27; founding), the small college station formally became known as WRBC (&quot;Radio Bates College&quot;).

In 1982, WRBC increased its power output from 10 watts to the present 120 watts. This increased the station&#x27;s listening area greatly. Previously the station could only be heard on campus and in the surrounding neighborhoods of Lewiston. Although previously licensed to transmit at up to 10 watts, a measurement made in 1974 recorded only 3 watts of actual output from the antenna. After the upgrade the station could now be picked up for about a 10- to 15-mile radius around the Bates campus. The station commenced 24-hour operation in the early 1980s. Students would work 3-hour shifts, and it was no problem finding people willing to do 3–6 am during the week. WRBC also featured news from the ABC radio network during this period, through an agreement with local station WLAM.
Starting in 1988, General Manager Scott Dalton and Program Director R. Kevin Doyle, along with the rest of the staff, worked to pay off the station’s accrued debt while also beginning the conversion of WRBC to a digital station.

===1990s and present day===
In 1990, General Manager Sheri Pizzi and Program Director George Reese landed funding to renovate the station&#x27;s on-air and production studies and convert the entire station from LP to CD. They began a program to reach out to the local community that included shows broadcast by Lewiston/Auburn residents. As Summer 1992 approached General Manager Denis Howard and his fellow staff members announced an open invitation to residents of the greater Lewiston / Auburn area to attend the weekly station meetings. This was done to determine interest in (and the potential of) broadcasting throughout the summer months after most Bates students had returned home. This program increased the station&#x27;s listenership in the twin cities as many WRBC genre directors are members of the L/A community and not Bates students. In 2013, twenty out of WRBC&#x27;s 75 active radio shows are hosted by members of the L/A community.

Sachs was born in Baltimore, Maryland and received his BS in math from MIT in 1970. He later worked at MIT for several years, where he wrote the STOIC language, at Data General, and at Concentric Data Systems.

1-2-3 was known for its speed and efficiency. The original program was implemented in Intel 8088 assembly language, rather than a higher level language such as C. It was also nearly bug-free, and introduced the letter hierarchical menus still used in Windows applications. Later versions of 1-2-3 were implemented in C, becoming much larger and more complex.

<text>A pincushion (or pin cushion) is a small, stuffed cushion, typically across, which is used in sewing to store pins or needles with their heads protruding to take hold of them easily, collect them, and keep them organized.

Pincushions are typically filled tightly with stuffing to hold pins rigidly in place. Magnetic pin cushions are also sometimes used; though technically they are not &quot;cushions&quot;, they serve the same basic function of holding pins neatly.

==History==

The recorded origins of pincushions date back to the Middle Ages of Europe. In the English language, they became known by many names: &quot;pimpilowes, pimpilos, pimplos, pimploes, pin-pillows, pin-poppets&quot;. In 1376, Jehanne de Mesnil was bequeathed a silver pin case in a French text called &quot;Testament of Advice&quot; written by a woman known as La Monteure, from Rouen. Other references to pin cases during the Medieval era exist. By the 16th century, these were supplanted by references to &quot;pin pillows&quot;. Some examples from various parts of Europe survive that have elaborate embroidery. Small porcelain baskets with a pin cushion inside were highly popular, as were small cushions, such as wedding pillows or maternity pillows, embroidered with messages. Typically, the pincushion was filled with cotton, wool, horsehair, or sawdust, though some were filled with emery powder, an abrasive to clean and sharpen the pins.
During the 18th century, weighted pincushions became popular among seamstresses. In England, seam clamps attached to a table and designed for holding hems for sewing became common and were often in the shape of a bird (the tail would be pinched to open and close the &quot;beak&quot; to hold the fabric), attached to the back of the bird was a velvet pin cushion.

One especially popular design is that of a tomato, often with a small attached strawberry containing emery powder. The tomato design was most likely introduced during the Victorian Era. It is commonly stated that the origin of this design was a belief that placing a tomato on the mantel of a new house guaranteed prosperity and repelled evil spirits and that if tomatoes were out of season, families improvised by using a round ball of red fabric filled with sand or sawdust, which also became a place to store pins. However, this statement appears to have no basis in historical fact, and pincushions in the shapes of many different vegetables were common in the Victorian Era.

==Pincushion dolls==

Porcelain pincushion dolls, or half-dolls, were fashionable in late 19th-century Europe and remain collectible today. Millions were made and sold during the 19th century, but due to their fragility, examples in excellent condition remain scarce. The form resembles a typical china figurine of a beautiful woman. Still, the porcelain doll ends at the waist, where holes are included in the design to allow the half-doll to be stitched to a pincushion. The pincushion half of the doll may be made of satin fabric and trimmings to resemble a skirt.

The original popularity of the pincushion dolls continued into the early 20th century, and some styles reflect Art Deco or similar 20th-century styles. The most collectible examples are from pre-World War II Dresden and Meissen, which may sell for around $500 US when the condition is perfect. More common designs in imperfect condition sell for less than $25 US. Similar dolls were produced to top the covers of tissue boxes, jewelry boxes, or tea pot cosies. Some uncommon examples are nude and have a risque style.

<text>John de Warenne (24/30 June 1286 - June 1347), 7th Earl of Surrey, was the last Warenne Earl of Surrey.

==Life==
John was born on either 24 or 30 June 1286 and baptised on 7 November of that year.He was the son of William de Warenne, the only son of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey. His mother was Joan, daughter of Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford.
Warenne was only six months old when his father died. 

John was still a minor when his grandfather died in 1304. Because of this his lands were taken into the custody of the Crown at the time, and he was made a royal ward of his relative Edward I of England. He was given seisin of the lands of his inheritance from his grandfather, the late John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, in April 1306. On 6 June 1306, John was referred to as &quot;the present earl of Surrey.&quot;

He was knighted on 22 May 1306 at Westminster Abbey along with 266 others, among which included the Prince of Wales, the future Edward II. This chivalric celebration was named the Feast of the Swans. From that time onwards he was much engaged in the Scottish wars.

John was one of the great nobles offended by the rise of Edward II&#x27;s favorite Piers Gaveston, and helped secure Gaveston&#x27;s 1308 banishment. The two were somewhat reconciled after Gaveston&#x27;s return the next year, but in 1312 Warenne was one of the nobles who captured Gaveston. He was however unhappy about Gaveston&#x27;s execution at the behest of the earl of Warwick, which pushed him back into the king&#x27;s camp.

The baronial opposition was led by the king&#x27;s cousin Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and he and Warenne became bitter enemies. Private war erupted between the two, and over the next few years Warenne lost a good part of his estates to Lancaster. In 1319, the King granted the Earl of Lancaster the towns of Conisboro and Sandal, along with the manors of Wakefield, Thorne, Hatfield, Sowerby, Braithwell, Fishlake, Dewsbury, and Halifax with their appurtenances, which were held of the King &quot;in capite&quot;, and which John de Warenne had previously held under Royal Grant. On May 17, 1326, these Yorkshire estates were then re-granted to Warenne, after the forfeiture of the Earl of Lancaster&#x27;s estate in 1322.

Warenne was one of the four earls who captured the two Roger Mortimers, the uncle and the nephew. In 1322 he was one of the nobles who condemned to death the Earl of Lancaster.

Warenne and his brother-in-law Edmund Fitzalan, 9th Earl of Arundel, were the last two earls to remain loyal to Edward II after the rise to power of Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer. After Arundel&#x27;s execution he went over to the queen&#x27;s side, urging Edward II&#x27;s abdication in 1327.

He was the guardian of his cousin Edward Balliol, and after Balliol lay claim to the Scottish throne, accompanied him on his campaign in Lothian. Balliol created Warenne earl of Strathern, but this was in name only for the properties of the earldom were held by the Scots.

Warenne died in 1347 at Conisbrough Castle. His burial took place at the Priory church of St Pancras, in Lewes. John gave instruction in his will that he wished to be buried in an arch at the church which he had prepared near the high altar. The date of his death recorded in his inquisition post mortems, ranges from 28 - 30 June 1347. He was succeeded as earl by his nephew Richard Fitzalan, who was also earl of Arundel.

== Family ==
On 15 March 1305, King Edward I of England offered John the marriage of his granddaughter Joan of Bar, Countess of Surrey, which he &quot;willingly accepted.&quot; She was a daughter of count Henry III of Bar, and Eleanor of England, Countess of Bar, the eldest daughter of king Edward I of England. 

John&#x27;s father was a first cousin of Edward I of England which meant that himself and his bride to be were second cousins once removed. They were both descended from Isabella of Angoulême. A dispensation was granted from Pope Clement V in order for the marriage to take place, due to them being related within the fourth degree of kindred.
They were married on 25 May 1306, in the royal chapel of Westminster Palace. Joan (or Jeanne) was only around 10 years old at the time of the marriage. After marriage, the couple lived in Yorkshire on John&#x27;s estates. Sometimes they lived at Sandal Castle, while the rest of the time they lived at Conisbrough Castle. There were soon indicators that this marriage may not be a happy one, when in 1309 king Edward II of England granted leave for John to make any person he wished heir to the lands that he held. But he requested surety that any heir which he may have by his wife Joan was not to be disinherited. John and his wife did not have any children. He tried on several occasions to divorce Joan but was not successful.

Warenne had a relationship with Maud de Nerford, with whom he had several illegitimate children, one of whom included Sir Edward de Warren. He was living openly with Maud by 1311. In 1313 the King arranged for his yeoman William Aune to take Joan from Conisbrough Castle, and bring her to him. Edward II of England then paid all Joan&#x27;s expenses while she lodged at the Tower of London. 

On 8 March 1315 Maud was described as &quot;Maud of Neyrford, daughter of the former William of Neyrford Knight, deceased, of the diocese of Norwich.&quot; This description occurred during a notice delivered by &quot;Robert, called of the chapel of Jackesle, a clerk of the diocese of Lincoln,&quot; to Joan of Bar that she was cited to appear before Thomas Gerdeston, the Archdeacon of Norfolk or his commissary to answer in a case of matrimony and divorce between herself and John de Warenne. This case was brought by Maud herself. However, the notice was read out to Joan while she was in the crypt of Saint Stephen&#x27;s in Westminster and attending to the queen, which was forbidden. And so Robert was sent to the Tower of London, and Thomas Gerdeston was ordered to appear at the next parliament. Maud had petitioned for the divorce of Warenne and his wife Joan on the basis that she had been precontracted to be married to John. This matter dragged on, and on 20 February 1316 the King allowed Maud&#x27;s case to begin afresh. He granted Maud, and the Earl of Surrey, along with any other person that they may bring forward in their causes, protection pending the suits. John wished to be divorced from his wife Joan, and tried to bring the suit at the same time as Maud, because he claimed that at the time he agreed to marry her, he was unaware they were related. He also stated he was under age at the time he contracted to marry Joan and was forced into it. On 24 February 1316, the Earl and Maud were granted licence by the King for their suits to take place. There is no record of the hearing of the two cases. But no divorce was granted. In John&#x27;s case this was probably due to the fact that it was forbidden under church law for a man to bring divorce proceedings based on consanguinity. Concerning Maud&#x27;s case and her claims of a previous contract, no contract had been found. There were other obvious issues with the Earl&#x27;s case: A dispensation had been obtained from the Pope at the time of marriage because John and Joan were related. At 19 years of age, John was above the age of consent to be married. And he is recorded as willingly accepting the marriage when it was proposed to him. By 1320 John had &quot;expelled Maud de Nerforde from his heart and his company.&quot; 

He later had a relationship with Isabella Holand, sister of Thomas Holland, later earl of Kent.

<text>Diego de Torres Vargas (1615 – 1670) was a Puerto Rican Catholic priest, and the first person to write a comprehensive history of Puerto Rico.

== Early years ==
Torres Vargas was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to a prosperous family. His father, Garcia de la Torre, was a Sergeant Mayor in the Spanish Army who died while fighting alongside Captain Juan de Amézqueta against Captain Balduino Enrico (Boudewijn Hendricksz), leader of the Dutch armada, who attempted to invade the island, in the Battle of San Juan of 1625.

== Academic education ==
Torres Vargas studied and graduated from the University of Salamanca in Spain where he earned his degree in Theology and Canon law. He returned to Puerto Rico where he was ordained a priest. King Philip IV appointed him to various positions in the Cathedral of San Juan including the position of Dean of said institution. Later Torres Vargas, became the secretary of the Bishop of San Juan, Haro Damian Lopez.

== &quot;Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico&quot; ==
In 1647 he wrote &quot;Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico&quot; (&quot;Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico&quot;). This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island.

The book described all the fruits and commercial establishments. It also listed and described every mine, church, and hospital in the island at the time. The book contained notices on the State and Capital, plus an extensive and erudite bibliography. This is considered to be the first organized history of Puerto Rico written by a Puerto Rican. Diego de la Torre de Vargas died in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1670

== Coat of arms of San Juan ==
On March 8, 1948, the city of San Juan officially adopted as the city&#x27;s first flag a white field, in the center of which is the current coat of arms of the city. 

The flag is based on Father Diego de Torres Vargas&#x27; text and it reads: &quot;Escudo de armas dado a Puerto Rico por los Reyes Católicos en el año de 1511, siendo Procurador un vecino llamado Pedro Moreno. Son: un cordero blanco con su banderilla colorada, sobre un libro, y todo sobre una isla verde, que es la de Puerto Rico, y por los lados una F y una I, que quiere decir Fernando e Isabel, los Reyes Católicos que se las dieron, y hoy se conservan en el estandarte real, que es de damasco anaranjado, con que se ganó la ciudad&quot; (&quot;coat of arms given to Puerto Rico by the Catholic Monarchs in the year 1511 when a &quot;vecino&quot; (roughly &quot;freeman&quot;) named Pedro Moreno was Procurator. They are: a white lamb with its red flag, on top of a book, and everything above a green island, which is Puerto Rico...which is an orange damask, with which the city was won&quot;). 

It appears that this orange was changed to white at some point.

She joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1934 and was a CCF campaign manager during the 1938 provincial election. By 1937, she joined the Communist Party of Canada but did not disclose her membership until 1943 remaining a member of the CCF until her riding association was dissolved because of its support of a popular front campaign with the Communists.

She was the first member of the Communist Party of Canada to be elected to the House of Commons of Canada, serving during World War II. She was the third woman elected to Canadian Parliament and the first to still be raising young children while holding political office. She won a seat in the 1940 federal election representing the Saskatchewan riding of North Battleford on the &quot;United Progressives&quot; label, beating the Liberal candidate in a two-way race. Canada banned the Communist Party in June 1940 due to the party&#x27;s opposition to the war. Nielsen, through indirect contact with Montreal-based Communist leaders who had escaped imprisonment, became a spokeswoman for the Communist Party through speeches made in the House of Commons.

When the Labor-Progressive Party was officially formed in 1943 as a legal front for the still banned Communist Party, Nielsen declared her affiliation with the party and was elected to its national executive committee. She ran for re-election in the 1945 election for the Labor-Progressive Party (the name the Communist Party would use until 1959), but came in third behind the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and Liberal candidates with 13% of the vote.

After her defeat, she and her children moved to Toronto where she worked as an organizer for the Labor-Progressive Party and wrote a weekly column for its newspaper, &quot;Canadian Tribune&quot;, called &quot;Women&#x27;s Place is Everywhere&quot;. At times she used the column to promote feminist views; for example, as related by her biographer, Faith Johnston, in 1949 she &quot;explained that only when a socialist economy lifted the burdens of child care and housework from the shoulders of individual women would they be able to compete with men on an equal footing. &#x27;It is being tied to all the multitudinous tasks of home and family that robs women of the opportunity to compete with men, not her inferiority.&quot; She helped found the Congress of Canadian Women and attended the Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation Peace Congress in Budapest in 1948 and helped found the Canadian Peace Congress the next year.

In 1949, she became executive secretary of the Canadian-Soviet Friendship Association and organized national tours and local chapters, distributed films and books, and did most of the organizational work for the association. Frustrated by having to play second fiddle to CSFA president Dyson Carter and being paid a lower salary than him, she resigned in the summer of 1953.
She ran again for the LPP in the 1953 election, this time in Brantford, Ontario, but came in last place with 216 votes.

===After politics===
Finding it difficult to find work outside of the party due to her age and possibly blacklisted due to her Communist allegiance, she found a job in the mid-1950s working in the office of the United Electrical Workers but found it dull, and left Canada in 1955 for London, England with her partner, Constant Godefroy (she had been estranged from husband Pete Nielsen since 1940). They returned to Canada in 1956, and Nielsen found a job clipping articles for Maclean-Hunter Publishing.

In 1957, Nielsen and Godefroy received permission to go to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, where she lived for the final 23 years of her life until her death in 1980. She spent most of those years working as an English teacher and as an editor for the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing.

She became a Chinese citizen in 1962.

==Family==

Dorise and Peter Nielsen had four children, one of whom died in infancy. Their youngest daughter was Thelma Nielsen, known as Sally (born 1931), who in 1980 married Dyson Carter, Dorise Nielsen&#x27;s former superior at the Canadian-Soviet Friendship Association.

<text>Ghanananda Saraswati (born Kewsi Essel; 12 September 1937 – 18 January 2016), commonly known as Swami Ghanananda, was a prominent swami (&quot;sannyasi&quot;) of the indigenous Hindu community in Ghana, and the first Hindu swami of African ancestry. He was initiated as a swami by the late Swami Krishnananda of India in 1975, and was head of the Hindu Monastery of Africa in Accra, Ghana.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Swami Ghanananda was born as Kwesi Essel on September 12, 1937, in Senya Beraku, a village in the Central Region of Ghana. His family practiced a native Ghanaian faith, but his parents later converted to Christianity. From a very early age Swami Ghanananda was interested in the mysteries of the universe and read various religious texts.

===Journey to India===
After reading some books on Hinduism, Ghanananda travelled to Rishikesh in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, in northern India. He spent some time there with a spiritual guru who suggested him to open the monastery in Accra.

===First meeting with Swami Krishnananda===
In 1962, Swami Ghanananda moved to Accra and on 24 November, he formed the Divine Mystic Path Society. He then started correspondence courses on the Hindu way of life (Sanatana Dharma) with the Divine Life Society of Rishikesh, located in the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India, where he first met Swami Krishnananda of India and became his śishya (disciple), and then in 1975 Swami Krishnananda initiated Swami Ghanananda as a swami.

<doc id="808512" wikidata="Q1506735" url="?curid=808512" title="Train Protection &amp; Warning System">
<text>The Train Protection &amp; Warning System (TPWS) is a train protection system used throughout the British passenger main-line railway network, and in Victoria, Australia.

According to the UK Rail Safety and Standards Board, the purpose of TPWS is to stop a train by automatically initiating a brake demand, where TPWS track equipment is fitted, if the train has: passed a signal at danger without authority; approached a signal at danger too fast; approached a reduction in permissible speed too fast; approached buffer stops too fast. TPWS is not designed to prevent signals passed at danger (SPADs) but to mitigate the consequences of a SPAD, by preventing a train that has had a SPAD from reaching a conflict point after the signal.

A standard installation consists of an on-track transmitter adjacent to a signal, activated when the signal is at danger. A train that passes the signal will have its emergency brake activated. If the train is travelling at speed, this may be too late to stop it before the point of collision, therefore a second transmitter may be placed on the approach to the signal that applies the brakes on trains going too quickly to stop at the signal, positioned to stop trains approaching at up to 75 mph (120 km/h).

At around 400 high-risk locations, TPWS+ is installed with a third transmitter further in rear of the signal increasing the effectiveness to 100 mph (160 km/h). When installed in conjunction with signal controls such as &#x27;double blocking&#x27; (i.e. two red signal aspects in succession), TPWS can be fully effective at any realistic speed.

TPWS is not the same as train stops which accomplish a similar task using electro-mechanical technology. Buffer stop protection using train stops is known as ‘Moorgate protection&#x27; or &#x27;Moorgate control’.

==History==
TPWS was developed by British Rail and its successor Railtrack, following a determination in 1994 that British Rail&#x27;s Automatic Train Protection system was not economical, costing £600,000,000 to implement, compared to value in lives saved: £3-£4 million ( - in 2019), per life saved, which was estimated to be 2.9 per year.

Trial installations of track side and train mounted equipment were made in 1997, with trials and development continuing over the next two years.

The rollout of TPWS accelerated when the Railway Safety Regulations 1999 came into force in 2003, requiring the installation of train stops at a number of types of location. However, in March 2001 the &quot;Joint Inquiry Into Train Protection Systems&quot; report found that TPWS had a number of limitations, and that while it provided a relatively cheap stop-gap prior to the widescale introduction of ATP and ERTMS, nothing should impede the installation of the much more capable European Train Control System.

== How it works ==

=== Overview ===
A pair of electronic loops are placed 50–450 metres on the approach side of the signal, energized when it is at danger. The distance between the loops determines the minimum speed at which the on board equipment will apply the train&#x27;s emergency brake. When the train&#x27;s TPWS receiver passes over the first loop a timer begins to count down. If the second loop is passed before the timer has reached zero, the TPWS will activate. The greater the line speed, the more widely spaced the two loops will be.

There is another pair of loops at the signal, also energised when the signal is at danger. These are end to end, and thus will initiate a brake application on a train about to pass a signal at danger regardless of speed.

=== On-track equipment ===
In a standard installation there are two pairs of loops, colloquially referred to as &quot;grids&quot; or &quot;toast racks&quot;. Both pairs consist of an &#x27;arming&#x27; and a &#x27;trigger&#x27; loop. If the signal is at danger the loops will be energised. If the signal is clear, the loops will de-energise.

The first pair, the Overspeed Sensor System (OSS), is sited at a position determined by line speed and gradient. The loops are separated by a distance that should not be traversed within less than a pre-determined period of time of about one second if the train is running at a safe speed approaching the signal at danger. The exact timings are 974 milliseconds for passenger trains and 1218 milliseconds for freight trains, determined by equipment on the train. Freight trains use the 1.25 times longer timing because of their different braking characteristics.

The first, &#x27;arming&#x27;, loop emits a frequency of 64.25 kHz. The second, &#x27;trigger&#x27;, loop has a frequency of 65.25 kHz.

The other pair of loops is back to back at the signal, and is called a Train Stop System (TSS). The &#x27;arming&#x27; and &#x27;trigger&#x27; loops work at 66.25 kHz and 65.25 kHz respectively. The brakes will be applied if the on-train equipment detects both frequencies together after having detected the arming frequency alone. Thus, an energised TSS is effective at any speed, but only if a train passes it in the right direction. Since a train may be required to pass a signal at danger during failure etc., the driver has the option to override a TSS, but not an OSS.

When a subsidiary signal associated with a main aspect signal is cleared for a shunting movement, the TSS loops are de-energised, but the OSS loops remain active.

Where trains are signalled in opposite directions on an individual line it could be possible for an unwarranted TPWS intervention to occur as a train travelled between an OSS arming and either trigger loops that were in fact associated with different signals. To cater for this situation one signal would be nominated the ‘normal direction’ and fitted with ‘ND’ equipment. The other signal would be nominated the ‘opposite direction’ and fitted with ‘OD’ equipment. Opposite direction TPWS transmission frequencies are slightly different, working at 64.75 (OSS arming), 66.75 (TSS arming), and 65.75 kHz (common trigger).

=== Location equipment ===

At the lineside there are two modules associated with each set of loops: a Signal Interface Module (SIM) and an OSS or TSS module. These generate the frequencies for the loops, and prove the loops are intact. They interface with the signalling system.

SIM Modules are colour coded red

ND TSS Modules are colour coded green

OD TSS Modules are colour coded brown

ND OSS Modules are colour coded yellow

OD OSS Modules are colour coded blue

=== On-train equipment ===

Every traction unit is fitted with a:
* TPWS receiver.
* TPWS control panel (standard or enhanced version).
* AWS/TPWS acknowledgement button.
* TPWS temporary isolation switch.
* AWS/TPWS full isolation switch.

If the loops are energised, an aerial on the underside of the train picks up the radio frequency signal and passes it to the receiver. A timer measures how long it takes to pass between the arming and trigger loops. This time is used to check the speed, and if it is higher than the TPWS &#x27;set speed&#x27;, an emergency brake application is initiated. If the train is travelling slower than the TPWS set speed, but then passes the signal at danger, the aerial will receive the signal from the energised Train Stop System loops, and the brake will be applied to stop the train within the overlap. Multiple unit trains have an aerial at each end. Vehicles that can operate singly (single car DMUs and locomotives) only have one aerial. This would be either at the front or rear of it depending on the direction the vehicle was moving in.

=== In-cab equipment ===
Every driving cab has a TPWS control panel, located where the driver can see it from their desk. There are two types of panel; the original &#x27;standard&#x27; type, and a more recent &#x27;enhanced&#x27; version, which gives separate indications for a brake demand caused by a SPAD, Overspeed or AWS.

The standard type consists of two circular indicator lamps and a square push button.

The push switch marked &quot;Train Stop Override&quot; is used to pass a signal at danger with authority. It ignores the TPWS TSS loops for approximately 20 seconds (generally for passenger trains) or 60 seconds (generally for slower accelerating freight trains) or until the loops have been passed, whichever is sooner.

The AWS system and the TPWS system are inter-linked and if either of these has initiated a brake application, the &quot;Brake Demand&quot; indicator lamp will flash.

The &quot;Temporary Isolation/Fault&quot; indicator lamp will flash if there is a TPWS system fault, or will show a steady illumination if the &quot;Temporary Isolation Switch&quot; has been activated.

There is also a separate TPWS Temporary Isolation Switch located out of reach of the driver&#x27;s desk. This is operated by the driver when the train is being worked in degraded conditions such as Temporary Block Working where multiple signals need to be passed at danger with the signaller&#x27;s authority. Temporarily isolating the TPWS does not affect the AWS. The driver must reinstate the TPWS immediately at the point where normal working is resumed. As a safety feature, if they forget to do this, the TPWS will be reinstated on the next occasion that the driver&#x27;s desk is shut down and then opened up again.

=== TPWS use in depot personnel safety ===

An alternative to using derailers in Depot Personnel Protection Systems is to equip the system with TPWS. This equipment safeguards staff from unauthorised movements by using the TPWS equipment. Any unplanned movement will cause the train to automatically come to a stand when it has passed the relevant signal set at danger. This has the added benefit of preventing damage to the infrastructure and traction and rolling stock that a derailer system can cause. The first known installation of such a system is at Ilford Depot. TPWS equipped depot protection systems are suitable only for locations where vehicles are driven in and out of the maintenance building from a leading driving cab - they are not suitable for use with loose coaching stock or wagon maintenance, where vehicle movements are undertaken by a propelling shunting loco (in this case the lead vehicles would not be equipped with the relevant TPWS safety equipment), nor will it prevent a run-away vehicle from entering a protected work area.

=== Variations ===

Certain signals may have multiple OSSes fitted. Alternatively, usually due to low line speeds, an OSS may not be fitted. An example of this is a terminal station platform starting signal. An OSS on its own may be used to protect a permanent speed restriction, or buffer stop. Although loops are standard, buffer stops may be fitted with &#x27;mini loops&#x27;, due to the very low approach speed, usually 10 mph. When buffer stops were originally fitted with TPWS using standard loops there were many instances of false applications, causing delays whilst it reset, with trains potentially blocking the station throat, plus the risk of passengers standing to alight being thrown over by the sudden braking. This problem arose when a train passed over the arming loop so slowly that it was still detected by the train&#x27;s receiver after the on-board timer had completed its cycle. The timer would reset and begin timing again, and the trigger loop then being detected within this second timing cycle would lead to a false intervention. As a temporary solution, drivers were instructed to pass the buffer stop OSSs at 5 mph, eliminating the problem, but meaning that trains no longer had the momentum to roll to the normal stopping point and requiring drivers to apply power beyond the OSS, just a short distance from the buffers, arguably making a buffer stop collision more likely than before TPWS was fitted. The redesigned &#x27;mini loops&#x27;, roughly a third the length of the standard ones, eliminate this problem, although due to the low speed and low margin, buffer stop OSSs are still a major cause of TPWS trips.

Recent applications in the UK have, in conjunction with advanced SPAD protection techniques, used TPWS with outer home signals that protect converging junctions with a higher than average risk by controlling the speed of an approaching train an extra signal section in rear of the junction. If this fails the resultant TPWS application of brakes will stop the train before the point of conflict is reached. This system is referred to as TPWS OS (Outer Signal).

== Limitations ==

=== Speed ===
Standard TPWS installations can only bring a train to a stop prior to passing a red signal, at . In 2001, it was observed that roughly one-third of the UK railway allows for a speed above . Further this assumes the train&#x27;s brakes is capable of providing a brake force of 12%g. A number of train types, most notably, the HSTs were not capable of achieving this, despite having a top speed of . TPWS-A was capable of stopping a train up to .

===Signals passed at danger with permission===
TPWS has no ability to regulate speed after a train passes a signal at danger &quot;with authority&quot;. However, on those occasions there are strict rules governing the actions of drivers, train speed, and the use of TPWS.

There are many reasons why a driver might be required to pass a signal at danger with authority. The signaller will advise the driver to pass the signal at danger, proceed with caution, be prepared to stop short of any obstruction, and then obey all other signals. Immediately before moving, the driver will press the &quot;Trainstop Override&quot; button on the TPWS panel, so that the train can pass the signal without triggering the TPWS to apply the brakes.

The driver must then proceed at a speed which enables them to stop within the distance that they can see to be clear. Even if it appears that the section is clear to the next signal, they must still exercise caution.

===Track conditions===
TPWS failed to prevent the 2021 Salisbury rail crash, because although the train went to full emergency braking, the slick conditions produced wheel slide and the train therefore was not brought to a stop prior to the collision point. (ATP would not have prevented this circumstance either).

===Compared with other safety systems===
Critics, such as those representing victims of the Ladbroke Grove and Southhall rail crashes, and ASLEF and RMT rail unions pushed for the abandonment of TPWS in the late 1990s in favor of continuing with British Rail&#x27;s ATP project.

A 2000 study, &quot;Automatic Train Protection for the rail network in Britain&quot; remarked that TPWS was &quot;in terms of avoiding “ATP preventable accidents” it is about 70% effective.&quot;, highlighting the speed limitation. That 2000 study did still conclude that TPWS was good solution for the short term of 10–15 years, but stressed that European Train Control system was the long term solution.

Notably, the combination of TPWS and AWS is least effective in accidents like the one at Purley, where a driver repeatedly cancelled the AWS warning without applying the brakes, passing the danger signal at high speed. Purley was one of several high profile SPAD crashes in the late 1980s, that led to the initial plan in the 1990s for the mass rollout of ATP, that was subsequently canceled in 1994 to be replaced by TPWS.

Supporters of TPWS claim that even where it could not prevent accidents due to SPADs, it would likely reduce the impact, and reduce or eliminate fatalities, by at least slowing the train down. However, it is likely that in those cases the driver would have applied the emergency brakes well before the overspeed sensor.

While it has been noted that there have been very few fatalities since the fitting of TPWS that would have been prevented had ATP been fitted instead. This overlooks that during the delay between the decision to cancel ATP and replace it with TPWS and the actual roll out of TPWS that Ladbroke Grove and Southall rail crash both occurred, accidents that were ATP preventable, and occurred on the Great Western line, which had been outfitted with ATP as part of the pilot studies in the early-90s.

<text>Ginevra de&#x27; Benci is a portrait painting by Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th-century Florentine aristocrat Ginevra de&#x27; Benci (born ). It was acquired by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. US from Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein in February 1967 for a record price for a painting of between $5 and $6 million. It is the only painting by Leonardo on public view in the Americas.

== Subject ==


Ginevra de&#x27; Benci, a well-known young Florentine woman, is universally considered to be the portrait&#x27;s sitter. Leonardo painted the portrait in Florence between 1474 and 1478, possibly to commemorate Ginevra&#x27;s marriage to Luigi di Bernardo Niccolini at the age of 16. More likely, it commemorates the engagement. Commonly, contemporary portraits of females were commissioned for either of two occasions: betrothal or marriage. Wedding portraits traditionally were created in pairs, with the woman on the right, facing left; since this portrait faces right, it more likely represents betrothal.

The juniper bush that surrounds Ginevra&#x27;s head and fills much of the background, serves more than mere decorative purposes. In Renaissance Italy, the juniper was regarded a symbol of female virtue, while the Italian word for juniper, &quot;ginepro&quot;, also makes a play on Ginevra&#x27;s name.

The imagery and text on the reverse of the panel—a juniper sprig encircled by a wreath of laurel and palm, memorialized by the Latin motto (&quot;Beauty adorns virtue&quot;)—further support the identification of the portrait. The phrase is understood as symbolizing the intricate relationship between Ginevra&#x27;s intellectual and moral virtue on the one hand, and her physical beauty on the other. The sprig of juniper, encircled by laurel and palm, suggests her name. The laurel and palm are in the personal emblem of Bernardo Bembo, a Venetian ambassador to Florence whose platonic relationship with Ginevra is revealed in poems exchanged between them. Infrared examination has revealed Bembo&#x27;s motto &quot;Virtue and Honor&quot; beneath Ginevra&#x27;s [????], making it likely that Bembo was somehow involved in the commission of the portrait.

The portrait is one of the highlights of the National Gallery of Art, and is admired by many for its portrayal of Ginevra&#x27;s temperament. Ginevra is beautiful, but austere; she has no hint of a smile and her gaze, although forward, seems indifferent to the viewer.

At some point, the bottom of the painting was removed, presumably owing to damage, and Ginevra&#x27;s arms and hands are thought to have been lost. Using the golden ratio, Susan Dorothea White has drawn an interpretation of how her arms and hands may have been positioned in the original. The adaptation is based on drawings of hands by Leonardo thought to be studies for this painting.

== Trivia ==
* As a woman of renowned beauty, Ginevra de&#x27; Benci was also the subject of ten poems written by members of the Medici circle, Cristoforo Landino and Alessandro Braccesi, and of two sonnets by Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici himself.
* According to Giorgio Vasari, Ginevra de&#x27; Benci was also included in the fresco by Domenico Ghirlandaio of the Visitation of Mary and Elizabeth in the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, but it is now believed that Vasari made a mistake and that Ghirlandaio painted Giovanna Tornabuoni.
* Ginevra&#x27;s brother Giovanni (1456–1523) was a friend of Leonardo. When Vasari wrote his &quot;Lives&quot;, Leonardo&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; was in the house of Amerigo Benci, Giovanni&#x27;s son.
* In 2017, the researcher and cryptographer Carla Glori anagrammatized fifty Latin sentences signed VINCI, formed with the very same alphabetical letters of the motto when supplemented with the Latin word &quot;iuniperus&quot; (juniper [sprig]). Glori argues that the anagrams form a coherent text and have a meaning that unequivocally refers to the portrait and to the biography of Ginevra Benci.

<doc id="808519" wikidata="Q1228851" url="?curid=808519" title="Discrete category">
<text>In mathematics, in the field of category theory, a discrete category is a category whose only morphisms are the identity morphisms:
:hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;X&quot;) = {id&quot;X&quot;} for all objects &quot;X&quot;
:hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) = ∅ for all objects &quot;X&quot; ≠ &quot;Y&quot;

Since by axioms, there is always the identity morphism between the same object, we can express the above as condition on the cardinality of the hom-set

:| hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) | is 1 when &quot;X&quot; = &quot;Y&quot; and 0 when &quot;X&quot; is not equal to &quot;Y&quot;.

Some authors prefer a weaker notion, where a discrete category merely needs to be equivalent to such a category.

== Simple facts ==
Any class of objects defines a discrete category when augmented with identity maps.

Any subcategory of a discrete category is discrete. Also, a category is discrete if and only if all of its subcategories are full.

The limit of any functor from a discrete category into another category is called a product, while the colimit is called a coproduct. Thus, for example, the discrete category with just two objects can be used as a diagram or diagonal functor to define a product or coproduct of two objects. Alternately, for a general category C and the discrete category 2, one can consider the functor category C2. The diagrams of 2 in this category are pairs of objects, and the limit of the diagram is the product. 

The functor from Set to Cat that sends a set to the corresponding discrete category is left adjoint to the functor sending a small category to its set of objects. (For the right adjoint, see indiscrete category.)

<doc id="808527" wikidata="Q2999029" url="?curid=808527" title="Extra-base hit">
<text>In baseball, an extra-base hit (EB, EBH or XBH), also known as a long hit, is any base hit on which the batter is able to advance past first base without the benefit of a fielder either committing an error or opting to make a throw to retire another base runner (see fielder&#x27;s choice). Extra-base hits are often not listed separately in tables of baseball statistics, but are easily determined by calculating the sum total of a batter&#x27;s doubles, triples, and home runs. Extra-base hits are particularly valuable because they ensure that there will be no runners on base that will be forced to advance on the next fair ball.

Another related statistic of interest that can be calculated is &quot;extra bases on long hits&quot;. A batter gets three of these for each home run, two for each triple, and one for each double. Thus, leading the league in &quot;Most extra bases in long hits&quot; is a significant accomplishment in power hitting.

The statistic Extra-Base Hits Allowed (for example by a pitcher or by the fielding team in general) is denoted by the abbreviation XBA.

==Major League Baseball leaders==
===Career===

The record for most career extra-base hits is 1,477, held by Hank Aaron. Among players with at least 1,000 career hits, Mark McGwire is the only one to have had at least half of his hits go for extra bases.

===Season===
There have been 15 instances of a player recording 100 extra-base hits in a single season; Lou Gehrig, Chuck Klein and Todd Helton are the only players to have achieved this twice, with Helton the only one to do so in consecutive seasons.

The top 5 are as follows: (totals are current through the end of the 2016 season)

#Babe Ruth (1921) – 119
#Lou Gehrig (1927) – 117
#Barry Bonds (2001) – 107
#Chuck Klein (1930) – 107
#Todd Helton (2001) – 105

===Single game===
The modern-era record for most extra-base hits by one batter, in one game, is five, held by 15 different players, including Lou Boudreau, Joe Adcock, Willie Stargell, Steve Garvey, Shawn Green, Kelly Shoppach, Josh Hamilton, Jackie Bradley Jr., Kris Bryant, José Ramírez, Matt Carpenter, Alex Dickerson, Luis Urías, Adolis García, and most recently Shohei Ohtani. Adock, Green, and Hamilton did so while hitting four home runs. In the postseason, Albert Pujols, Hideki Matsui, Bob Robertson, Frank Isbell and Enrique Hernández have all recorded four extra-base hits in a game.

===Consecutive games===
Paul Waner (1927) and Chipper Jones (2006) jointly hold the longest hitting streak for extra bases. Both players recorded extra-base hits in 14 consecutive games.

==Team records==
The Boston Red Sox recorded 17 extra-base hits in a 29–4 victory against the St. Louis Browns in 1950. In the postseason, the team single game record for extra-base hits is 13, by the New York Yankees against the Red Sox in game 3 of the 2004 ALCS. Two teams have 9 extra-base hits in a World Series game, namely the 1925 Pittsburgh Pirates (in game 7 vs the Washington Senators) and the 2007 Boston Red Sox (game 1, vs the Colorado Rockies).

The 2003 Boston Red Sox had 649 extra-base hits, the most by one team in a single season.

<text>Jane March Horwood is an English film actress and former model.

==Early life and education==
March&#x27;s father, Bernard Horwood, was a design and technology secondary school teacher of English and Spanish ancestry. Her mother, Jean, a newsagent, is Vietnamese and Chinese.

At age 14, whilst still attending Nower Hill High School in Pinner, north London, March won a local &quot;Become a Model&quot; contest.

==Career==
After GCSEs, March moved to an apartment in Wimbledon with friends and continued to model before a call to audition in Paris on her 17th birthday following a cover shoot of &quot;Just Seventeen&quot; which had attracted the attention of French director Jean-Jacques Annaud&#x27;s wife, Laurence Duval Annaud. March played the female lead in the 1992 film &quot;The Lover&quot;, based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Marguerite Duras.

Two years after &quot;The Lover&quot;, she co-starred with Bruce Willis in the erotic thriller &quot;Color of Night&quot; (1994), directed by Richard Rush. &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine ranked her sex scene in the film as &quot;the Best Sex Scene in film history&quot;.

==Personal life==
While &quot;Color of Night&quot; was in production, March began dating the film&#x27;s co-producer, Carmine Zozzora. The couple married in June 1993, with Willis as the best man and Demi Moore as the maid of honour. According to &quot;Color of Night&quot; director Richard Rush, March still received many offers from Hollywood studios after the film&#x27;s release, but Zozzora required the studios to also hire him as the producer for any film in which March would star, a condition most studios rejected. For this reason, March did not star in more films during their marriage.

March and Zozzora separated in 1997 and divorced in 2001. A few years later, March married Steven Waddington. They have one child.

<doc id="808561" wikidata="Q3143236" url="?curid=808561" title="Humboldt Park, Chicago">
<text>Humboldt Park, one of 77 designated community areas, is on the West Side of Chicago, Illinois. The Humboldt Park neighborhood is known for its dynamic social and ethnic demographic change over the years. The Puerto Rican community has identified strongly with the area since the 1970s. Humboldt Park is also the name of the Chicago Park District&#x27;s historic 207-acre (0.8 km2) park or public garden adjacent to the community area.

==Boundaries and subsections==
The official community boundaries established by the City of Chicago include Bloomingdale Ave to the north, the Union Pacific railroad tracks to the south, the train tracks running between Kostner and Cicero to the west, and Humboldt Park proper to the east (to the East side of California Ave).

In contrast to the Humboldt Park Official Community Area, the Humboldt Park Neighborhood&#x27;s borders include Western Avenue to the east, Pulaski Road to the west, North Avenue to the North, and the Union Pacific tracks to the south. The railyards southeast of Grand and Sacramento are also part of the community area. There are two distinct areas of Humboldt Park (the neighborhood): East Humboldt Park (In the West Town Community Area) and West Humboldt Park (In the Humboldt Park Community Area), divided by Sacramento Boulevard.

===East Humboldt Park/West Town===
East Humboldt Park is bordered by Sacramento Boulevard, Western Avenue, North Avenue and Division Street. Though it is considered a part of the Humboldt Park neighborhood, it is officially a part of the West Town community area. The area has been known for its working and lower middle class Puerto Rican community from the 1970s to the 2000s. The area has seen a large influx of White middle to upper middle class residents due to the process of gentrification, though parts of the neighborhood are still impoverished and still is known for high crime and gang activity. The area once had the largest middle class Puerto Rican community in the Midwest.

The area is home to many social service institutions, bars, restaurants, cafes and shops as well as two sixty-foot Puerto Rican flags on a stretch of Division Street designated Paseo Boricua. Mayor Rahm Emanuel&#x27;s sweeping school closings closed Von Humboldt Elementary, De Duprey Elementary, and Lafayette Elementary, leaving no neighborhood elementary schools in the area.

===West Humboldt Park===
West Humboldt Park is the area west of Sacramento Boulevard. Many residents on this side of Humboldt Park are low-income working class residents. Though in conventional terms the Humboldt Park neighborhood has been considered between Western Avenue, Pulaski Road, North Avenue, and Chicago Avenue. The area west of Pulaski until Kenton Avenue is considered West Humboldt Park as well.

=== K-Town ===

K-Town is a nickname for an area in Humboldt Park, North Lawndale, and West Garfield Park between Pulaski Road and Cicero Avenue in which the names of many north–south avenues begin with the letter K (Keystone, Karlov, Kedvale, Keeler, Kenneth, Kilbourn, Kildare, Kolin, Kolmar, Komensky, Kostner, Kilpatrick, Kenton, Knox, and Keating). The pattern is a historical relic of a 1913 street-naming proposal, by which streets were to be systematically named according to their distance from the Illinois-Indiana border. K, the eleventh letter, was to be assigned to streets within the eleventh mile, counting west from the state line.

The eleventh mile is the easternmost area in which the plan was widely implemented, as many neighborhoods to the east were already developed and had street names in place. The portion of K-Town bounded by W. Cullerton St, W. Cermak Rd, S. Kostner Ave, and S. Pulaski Rd was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places on September 9, 2010.

==History==
The park was named for Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), a Prussian naturalist and geographer, an early observer of human-induced climate change, was famed for his five-volume work &quot;&quot;. His single visit to the United States in 1804 did not include Chicago, but citizens sponsored his monumental statue, unveiled in October 1892. Humboldt Park is part of Chicago&#x27;s Boulevard Park System, which flanks the Loop with large parks linked with boulevards.

The park is lined with graystone houses and is no longer subject to landmark status restrictions on Kedzie Ave. The park itself has 3 major historical public buildings, including the Boat House (designed by Schmidt, Garden and Martin), the Field House (which received a 1.5 million dollar renovation grant, being implemented in 2013) and the Historic Stables (described more below).
Chicago annexed most of the neighborhood in 1869, the year the park was laid out. Because the area lay just beyond the city&#x27;s fire code jurisdiction, as set out after the 1871 fire, this made low cost construction possible.

The neighborhood has been a center for many ethnic groups since Chicago&#x27;s inception:
# Scandinavians (especially Norwegian and Danish, but also Swedish)
# European Jews (approximately of the community with a peak of 30,000 in the 1930s), Germans, &amp; Italians
# Polish
# Puerto Ricans, Cubans, African Americans, Mexicans, and other Latinos
The currently abandoned Pioneer Trust and Savings Bank Building at the intersection of N. Pulaski/North avenue was at one point one of the United States 300 largest commercial banks. In 1895, streetcars began operating along North avenue, once a bustling commercial hub, and would travel west down towards Pulaski. In 1911, streetcars began running on Pulaski itself, making this intersection in particular a nucleus of activity.

===Our Lady of the Angels School fire===
Our Lady of the Angels School Fire occurred at the Our Lady of the Angels School on December 1, 1958, on 909 North Avers Avenue in the Humboldt Park area. The school, which was operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago, lost 92 students and three nuns in five classrooms on the second floor.

=== Recent history ===
In 1980, Puerto Ricans were the largest ethnic group in Humboldt Park, with a majority in 42 census tracts in the Humboldt Park area. In 2009 Puerto Ricans were the largest ethnic presence in 11 census tracts in the Humboldt Park area. 

In the 1970s, Humboldt Park became more dangerous with high levels of gang activity, crime, and violence. The neighborhood was economically depressed, with housing values below the citywide average, until the recent upswing. Overcrowding remains a serious problem, as does gang activity and violent crime. Gentrification, beginning in the late 1990s, along with changing police tactics, and cultural, political and social organizations, have changed the demographics, politics, economy and rates of the area.

Research indicates that as communities experience gentrification, new and more affluent residents push out legacy residents through higher property taxes, and interpersonal divestment in contributing to the culture of the neighborhood. New and more affluent residents in Humboldt Park prioritize community concerns. The previous poorer and non-White residents are often criminalized by these new residents who increasingly use law enforcement agencies.

According to the Woodstock institute, 550 foreclosures in Humboldt Park during 2010 further decreased the Puerto Rican presence. Newer middle-class and wealthy White people, as well as working class Mexican people have shifted the Puerto Rican majority in Humboldt Park. Some Puerto Ricans that are upwardly mobile have left Humboldt Park, while others dispersed due to economic difficulty throughout the city, especially into the neighborhoods of Belmont Cragin, Hermosa, and Portage Park. Many have dispersed throughout Cook County.

In June 2024, the part of the Humboldt Park neighborhood in Chicago known as Puerto Rico Town or Paseo Boricua officially changed its name to Barrio Borikén.

=== Gang History ===

Humboldt Park is the founding grounds for several major gangs, including the Latin Kings, Maniac Latin Disciples, and Simon City Royals, among a number of other gangs with active chapters in the area. Many of these gangs were originally formed along racial lines, largely in the face of discrimination and tension, such as between Puerto Ricans and white greaser gangs around the area. Violence between these groups would lead to the formation of the Latin Kings in 1954. The Division Street Riots in 1966 would be yet another formative event in the organization of various groups around the neighborhood.

The gang culture that brewed in the neighborhood during the 1950s and 1960s carried on for successive generations. The 1970s was a particularly tumultuous decade in Chicago for violent crime, and against Chicago Police officers who faced some of the highest fatality rates in many decades, often as a result of gunfire. The center stage for much of this crime, frequently stemming from gang activity and drug dealing, would be Humboldt Park. By the late 1980s/early 90s, approximately 49 of the 139 gangs in chicago operated out of the neighborhood. Eventually in the 1990s, the east side of the neighborhood began experiencing some gentrification, and crime gradually lowered around this area with the 2010s seeing notably lowered violent crime levels. However, crime has been a concern for some residents of the area as recently as 2023. Members have been known to actively gangbang in or around the park, such as a group of 13 who maintained an open-air market where they openly sold crack and fentanyl-laced drugs. In 2023, Humboldt Park residents held several rallies protesting continued issues surrounding drug dealing and violent crimes, such as armed robberies and shootings.

==Demographics==
As of February 2013, the 26th Ward of the City of Chicago (which encompasses the majority of Humboldt Park) had a population of 28.0% Puerto Ricans. East of Humboldt Park, which is West Town part of the First Ward, is now 45.12% White due to the larger amount of gentrification factors on the east side of the park. Increasing property taxes during the past two decades have forced out the Latino and Eastern European residents that live east of the park.

This shift can be easily seen moving westward towards Kedzie Avenue past Humboldt Park and the reduced coverage and visibility of the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Consistent price increases in neighboring have out-priced gentrifiers in surrounding neighborhoods, sending them to Humboldt Park, displacing residents whom they had already displaced in the previous neighborhoods.

The area around Our Lady of the Angels Church was majority Irish American in the late 1800s. At some point many ethnic Irish moved to suburban municipalities, and in the 1950s, these sections of were characterized by the Italian American community. Some Irish Americans remained, and there were also Polish Americans at that time.

===Puerto Rican community===
As early as the 1950s, Puerto Ricans settled in Humboldt Park. Many came directly from Puerto Rico as migration was averaging over ten thousand Puerto Ricans per year in the 1950s and 1960s, throughout the United States. Others were forced out by urban renewal from the first Puerto Rican neighborhoods of La Madison near the Eisenhower Expressway and University of Illinois, Chicago campus and from Old Town and Lincoln Park, then called La Clark.

The infamous Division Street Riots resulted in the start of organizations for Puerto Rican rights in 1966. Another smaller riot took place in Lincoln Park in 1967. The Young Lords, under the leadership of Jose Cha Cha Jimenez worked with gangs like the Latin Kings, the Spanish Cobras, the Latin Disciples and the above-mentioned community organizations to build unity and to redirect youth energies toward education and empowerment strategies.

To the Young Lords, it was one community and they organized several solidarity marches from Lincoln Park to Humboldt Park and to City Hall, demanding social services, an end to police brutality and an end to neighborhood displacement. The last point refers especially to the Puerto Rican community&#x27;s (socio-economic-culturally forced) migration West in the city from Lincoln Park.

In 1995, city officials and Puerto Rican-American activists in a symbolic gesture to recognize the neighborhood and the Puerto Rican residents&#x27; roots, christened a stretch of Division Street &quot;Paseo Boricua&quot;. Two metal -tall Puerto Rican flags, each weighing 45 tons, arch over the street at each end of the strip. There is a proud historical and ongoing imprint of Puerto Rican identity in Humboldt Park.

====Fiestas Puertorriqueñas and The People&#x27;s Parade on Division Street====

Every summer, there is the tradition of Fiestas Puertorriquenas in Humboldt Park (the park itself, as well as the neighborhood). The parade, named The People&#x27;s Parade, takes place along Division Street between Western Avenue and California Avenue. The park is transformed into a party, replete with top live performers of &quot;salsa, merengue, bomba, plena, reggaeton&quot; (and its relative, hip-hop espanol) and other Puerto Rican and related Afro-Caribbean music (e.g. Dominican-based &quot;Bachata; Cuban Son, Son-Montuno, Rumba&quot;).

There is a carnival with amusement rides and Puerto Rican food: &quot;arroz con gandules, pollo guisado, pinchos, mofongo, and alcapurrias&quot; (just to name a few of the foods). Vendor booths purvey the food as well as deejays playing traditional and new Chicago house music with Spanish vocals and soulful (often orchestral Latin-jazz laden) Afro-Caribbean syncopated rhythms. In 2021, the festival celebrated the 40th anniversary of Boricua en la luna, a poem written by Juan Antonio Corretjer and popularized by Roy Brown as well as the 50th anniversary of a Puerto Rican mural at the corner of North and Artesian Avenues.

==Riot Fest==
In 2012, Riot Fest changed the location of its annual music festival to Humboldt Park. The fest expanded to become Riot Fest &amp; Carnival, with rides, games, wrestling, gourmet food vendors and three stages. Performers included Iggy Pop And The Stooges, Rise Against, Elvis Costello &amp; The Imposters, The Offspring, and many more. In 2013, attendance at increased, with a peak of 30,000 people on the first day. and additional festivals were held in Toronto and Denver.

In 2014, 160,000 people attended Riot Fest that had a lineup that included Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Rise Against, and Slayer, The Flaming Lips, Wu-Tang Clan, The Cure, Weezer, Social Distortion, Primus, Tegan and Sara, Cheap Trick, and Patti Smith. This Riot Fest included the inaugural &quot;Riot Fest Speaks&quot; panel, moderated by Henry Rollins and featuring Pussy Riot members Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina, Bad Religion vocalist and UCLA professor Greg Graffin, Rise Against vocalist Tim McIlrath, writer/activist Marcelle Karp, and Riot Fest founder Michael Petryshyn.

In 2015, after some members of the community protested the presence of Riot Fest as a sign of gentrification in the neighborhood (along with the prolonged closure of the park for cleanup and repair after the 2014 event), Alderman Roberto Maldonado vocally opposed allowing the event to continue using Humboldt Park. The festival ultimately relocated to North Lawndale&#x27;s Douglass Park, where the community is also opposed.

== Organizations ==
===The Greater Humboldt Park Community of Wellness===
The Greater Humboldt Park Community of Wellness is a coalition of neighborhood organizations that all focus on improving the quality of health and awareness of health in the following areas: asthma, active lifestyles, behavioral health, diabetes, health careers, HIV/AIDS, oral health, and school health. The coalition works within the Humboldt Park community area as well as the West Town community area, and mainly focuses on the health needs of Puerto Rican, Mexican, and Black residents within the neighborhood to support low-income residents who may not have access to health services. VIDA/SIDA, a project of the Puerto Rican Cultural Center, has a major presence in the community, educating the neighborhood on sexual health and LGBTQ issues, especially within the Latino/a community.

=== East Humboldt Park Neighborhood Association (EHPNA) ===
Founded in 2007 to organize those who live East of the Park and participate in the Chicago Police Department&#x27;s CAPS Beat 1423 initiatives. 
The foundational intents are three-fold:
#As a way to give neighbors and relatively newer residents of the East Humboldt Park a voice, an identity, and a way to get connected with each other.
#As an efficient way to disseminate information about the community. Usually CAPS and other Community updates.
#As a forum where neighbors can feel free to discuss some of the issues residents in East Humboldt Park as well as neighborhood victories to celebrate.

=== Historic Humboldt Park stables and the Institute of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture ===
Originally completed in 1895 by Chicago architects Frommann and Jebsen, the Humboldt Park Stable and Receptory is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a Chicago Landmark. The building&#x27;s design highlights the Germanic character of the neighborhood in the 1890s and is a fanciful creation of Ludowici tile roofs, finials, brick, and half-timbering. The Institute of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture has a 15-year lease that began in May 2006 and expires in 2021.

It is dedicated to the history of Puerto Rican culture and the Puerto Rican diaspora. Funding from an ISTEA grant allowed the Chicago Park District to fully restore the building. About $3.4 million was spent to renovate the exterior of the building ($1 Million came from City of Chicago Tax Increment Finance (TIF) and another $3.2 (State of Illinois Grant) million for the interior.

The stables were once in use by a special Chicago Parks Police Force and is located at 3015 W. Division St. The turret on the Southeast corner of the building 
was part of the office of Jens Jensen, a landscape architect who left his mark on the impressive design of the park&#x27;s natural hardscape and water features.

=== United Blocks of West Humboldt Park ===
On 5 May 1995, local West Humboldt Park residents organized to address the problems and concerns of residents and property owners living in West Humboldt Park, and as a result, incorporated The United Blocks of West Humboldt Park (TUBOWHP). The purposes for which TUBOWHP is organized are:

A.) To enhance the livability of the area by establishing and maintaining an open line of communication and liaison between the neighborhood, government agencies and other neighborhoods.

B.) To provide an open process by which all members of the neighborhood may involve themselves in the affairs of the neighborhood.

==Cultural references to the community==
Humboldt Park figures prominently in the literary works that chronicled Chicago&#x27;s blue collar life in the 1950s and 1960s.
*Saul Bellow&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Augie March&quot; charts the long drifting life of a Jewish Chicagoan and his myriad eccentric acquaintances throughout the early 20th century: growing up in the then Polish neighborhood of Humboldt Park, he ends up cavorting with heiresses on the Gold Coast, studying at the University of Chicago, fleeing union thugs in the Loop, and taking the odd detour to hang out with Trotsky in Mexico while eagle-hunting giant iguanas on horseback.
*John Guzlowski&#x27;s &quot;Echoes of Tattered Tongues: Memory Unfolded&quot; chronicles the author&#x27;s experiences growing up in the immigrant and DP neighborhoods around Humboldt Park in Chicago, in the context of Jewish hardware store clerks with Auschwitz tattoos on their wrists, Polish Cavalry officers who still mourned for their dead horses, and women who walked from Siberia to Iran to escape the Russians.
*John Guzlowski&#x27;s detective novels &quot;Suitcase Charlie,&quot; &quot;Little Altar Boy,&quot; and &quot;Murdertown&quot; deal with crime in the refugee and immigrant neighborhood east of Humboldt Park from the 1950s through the 1970s.
*Sarah Paretsky&#x27;s 1999 detective thriller &quot;Hard Time&quot;, part of the V. I. Warshawski series, is set in Humboldt Park as it was in the 1970s and 1980s, with the high levels of gang activity, crime, and violence.

Humboldt Park has also been featured in film and television.
*&quot;The Horn Blows at Midnight&quot;, a 1945 film starring Jack Benny, Margaret Dumont, and Alexis Smith, also features Humboldt Park. Benny portrays an angel sent from heaven to blow his horn at an appointed time and destroy the world. However, because the angel hasn&#x27;t lived on Earth for several centuries, he becomes totally lost in modern Chicago. He floats from one misadventure to the next, including a visit to Humboldt Park during an ethnic German picnic, where he encounters Germans in traditional garb enjoying traditional German food and music. Ultimately the angel refuses to blow his horn, arguing to God that the kindness and goodness displayed by the Chicagoans he met warrants saving the world, not destroying it. God agrees.
*&quot;Nothing Like the Holidays&quot;, starring Freddy Rodriguez, John Leguizamo, Debra Messing, Alfred Molina, Jay Hernandez, Ramses Jimenez, Luis Guzman, Melonie Diaz, Vanessa Ferlito and Elizabeth Peña, follows three siblings returning to their parents&#x27; home in Humboldt Park for the holidays.
*The television series &quot;Chicago Fire&quot; is filmed on location in Chicago and has filmed several episodes in Humboldt Park. One of the characters Firefighter Joe Cruz (Joe Minoso) mentions growing up and living there, where he would be &quot;lulled to sleep by gunfire&quot; and has witnessed many of his childhood friends, including his own younger brother, enter a life of crime with the local ethnic gang.

Franklin Boulevard Hospital, in the community area, began operations in the 1930s. Franklin Boulevard treated victims of the Our Lady of the Angels fire. Annie Sweeney and Steve Mills of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that this hospital &quot;played a crucial role&quot; in giving medical treatment in that disaster. It was described as being in &quot;immediate risk&quot; of shuttering by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1988. Later the hospital became known as West Side Community Hospital, doing business as Sacred Heart Hospital; the rename was done by the owner honoring a religious relative. The hospital was not operated by nor otherwise affiliated with any religious organization. In July 2013 that hospital closed due to losing federal funding, and the hospital owner was criminally indicted.

<text>Uptown is one of Chicago&#x27;s 77 community areas. Uptown&#x27;s boundaries are Foster Avenue to the north; Lake Michigan to the east; Montrose Avenue (Ravenswood Avenue to Clark Street), and Irving Park Road (Clark Street to Lake Michigan) to the south; Ravenswood Avenue (Foster Avenue to Montrose Avenue), and Clark Street (Montrose Avenue to Irving Park Road) to the west. To the north is Edgewater, to the west is Lincoln Square, and to the south is Lakeview. Near the lake are some of the northern reaches of Lincoln Park, including Montrose Beach and multiple nature reserves. The area has a mix of commercial and residential development, and includes a well-established entertainment district of clubs and concert venues, and was a center for early film making. Truman College, a two-year city college, is located here, and the area&#x27;s southwest corner includes the historic 19th century Graceland Cemetery.


==History==

=== Early years ===
The historical, cultural, and commercial center of Uptown is Broadway, with Uptown Square at the center. In 1900, the Northwestern Elevated Railroad constructed its terminal at Wilson and Broadway (now part of the CTA Red Line). Uptown became a summer resort town for downtown dwellers, and derived its name from the Uptown Store, which was the commercial center for the community. For a time, all northbound elevated trains from downtown ended in Uptown. Uptown became known as an entertainment destination. Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson and other early film stars produced films at the Essanay Studios on Argyle Street. The Aragon Ballroom, Riviera Theater, Uptown Theatre, and Green Mill Jazz Club are all located within a half block of Lawrence and Broadway. Uptown is also home to one of Chicago&#x27;s most celebrated final resting spots, Graceland Cemetery.

The Uptown neighborhood boundary once extended farther to the North, to Hollywood Avenue. Beginning at the turn of the 20th century, just after the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, the entire area had experienced a housing construction boom. In the mid-1920s, construction of large and luxurious entertainment venues resulted in many of the ornate and historic Uptown Square buildings which exist today. The craftsmanship and artistry of those Uptown Square buildings reflects the ornate pavilions of the Exposition.

For over a century, Uptown has been a popular Chicago entertainment district, playing a significant role in ushering in the Gilded Age, the American Lyceum movement, the jazz age, the silent film era, the swing era, the big band era, and the rock and roll era. It has also been a filming location for over 480 movies. Uptown has ties to significant spectator sport athletes and organizations, including the Chicago Blackhawks and three Olympic figure skaters, as well as theater, comedy clubs, dance performers who later became nationally famous, and even &quot;The People&#x27;s Music School,&quot; a needs-based, tuition-free music school for formal classical music training.

=== Postwar era ===
By the 1950s, the middle class was leaving Uptown for more distant suburbs, as commuter rail and elevated train lines were extended. Uptown&#x27;s housing stock was aging, and old mansions were subdivided. Residential hotels which had housed wives of sailors attached to the Great Lakes Naval Station during World War II now served low-income migrants from the South and Appalachia. Uptown developed a reputation as &quot;Hillbilly Heaven&quot; in the 1950s and the 1960s. The Council of the Southern Mountains, headquartered in Berea, Kentucky, launched the Chicago Southern Center in 1963 in Uptown, with help from the Chicago philanthropist W. Clement Stone. Chicago&#x27;s anti-poverty program opened the Montrose Urban Progress Center. Students for a Democratic Society initiated a community organizing project, JOIN (Jobs or Income Now) in 1963. Large-scale urban renewal projects like Harry S. Truman College eliminated much low-cost housing, and the low-income Southern white residents dispersed. New waves of Asian, Hispanic, and African-American migrants moved into the remaining neighborhoods.

Beginning in the 1950s, Native Americans came to Chicago in increasing numbers as part of a relocation program initiated by the federal government, although those sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Affairs may have constituted a minority of arrivals, who often came to the city independently in search of economic opportunities. With supportive neighborhood institutions such as the American Indian Center, availability of social services, and low housing costs, Uptown established itself as the central hub for the growing community. Indeed, the Native population in Chicago nearly doubled from 3,400 in the 1960 Census to at least 6,500 by the end of the decade, with growth continuing even after the lapse of the federal relocation program. The majority of Uptown&#x27;s Native American residents dispersed following the decline in factory jobs throughout the 1980s, with some moving to neighborhoods west of Uptown while others returned to their reservations altogether.

Latinos forced out from other near downtown and lakefront areas by urban renewal settled close to the border with Lakeview at Sheridan, near Irving Park Rd. In 1975 Young Lords founder Jose (Cha-Cha) Jimenez joined with a broad coalition of whites, blacks and Latinos and ran unsuccessfully against Daley-sponsored Christopher Cohen but still garnered 39% of the vote. His main campaign issue was housing corruption, which was displacing Latinos and the poor from prime real estate areas of Chicago.

=== 21st century ===
Most recently, since 2000, gentrification has spread north from neighboring Lakeview and south from Edgewater. Median condo prices jumped 69.1% from 2000-2005.

In 2008, a group of residents sued the City of Chicago over its designation of the Wilson Yards lot as a Tax Increment Financing (&quot;TIF&quot;) district.

In December 2009, a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; story reported on the problem facing eastern sections of Uptown where several nursing homes clustered in the area house the mentally ill, including felons. Many of these residents have committed a variety of serious crimes including murder, and 11 nursing homes in the area house 318 convicted felons and 1350 mentally ill people.

=== Historical records ===
Historical images of Uptown can be found in Explore Chicago Collections, a digital repository made available by Chicago Collections archives, libraries and other cultural institutions in the city.

== Neighborhoods ==
=== Buena Park ===
Buena Park is a neighborhood bounded by Montrose Avenue, Irving Park Road, Graceland Cemetery and Lake Shore Drive. At the core of the neighborhood is the Hutchinson Street Historic District, a tree-lined stretch several blocks long featuring mansions that make up &quot;one of the best collections of Prairie-style architecture in the city.&quot; It is in sharp contrast to the skyscrapers that populate the area around it. The neighborhood was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It can be accessed from the Sheridan stop on the CTA&#x27;s Red Line.

Robert A. Waller developed Buena Park starting in 1887 by subdividing his property. The site of the original Waller home now holds St. Mary of the Lake church (built in 1917). Buena Park pre-dates the remainder of Uptown by a number of years. Buena Park is also home to one of the most active neighborhood organizations in Chicago: Buena Park Neighbors.

&quot;The Delectable Ballad of the Waller Lot&quot; by Chicago poet Eugene Field:

&quot;Up yonder in Buena Park&quot;
&quot;There is a famous spot,&quot;
&quot;In legend and in history&quot;
&quot;(Known as) the Waller lot.&quot;

===Sheridan Park===

Sheridan Park is a neighborhood roughly bounded by Lawrence Avenue on the north, Clark Street on the west, Montrose on the south, and Broadway on the east. It is mostly residential, containing six-flats, single family homes, and courtyard apartment buildings. There is a growing business district along Wilson Avenue, which bisects Sheridan Park. Truman College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago, is also located in Sheridan Park. The neighborhood can be accessed from either the Wilson or Lawrence stop on the CTA&#x27;s Red Line.

In 1985, the Sheridan Park Historic District (a National Landmark District) was established to protect the unique single-family and smaller multi-family architecture of the area. According to the National Park Service, the district is roughly bounded by Lawrence Avenue on the north, Clark Street on the west, Montrose on the south, and Racine on the east. Some structures of Uptown Square were also added as contributing structures.

In December 2007, the Chicago City Council approved the Dover Street Historic District in Sheridan Park. This designation covered the three northern blocks of Dover Street and four single-family homes on the west side of adjacent Beacon Street just south of Lawrence Avenue. Unlike federal Landmark District status, City landmark status limits the demolition and modification of properties without the approval of the Chicago Landmarks Commission.

=== Argyle Street===

More recently known as &quot;Asia on Argyle,&quot; but also known as &quot;Little Saigon&quot;, and &quot;Little Vietnam&quot;, this neighborhood was once a predominantly Jewish community. In the 1970s, the neighborhood became home to many immigrants from China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, many of whom were refugees from the Vietnam War and Sino-Vietnamese War. Asia on Argyle hosts Asian eateries, cafes, and grocery stores, including Vietnamese, Thai, Laotian, and Chinese restaurants. In the summer, the Argyle Night Market, a weekly street festival, draws tens of thousands of attendees.

The neighborhood is served by the Argyle stop on the CTA&#x27;s Red Line and CTA busses on Sheridan Rd. and Broadway. It should not be confused with Chinatown, which is in the Armour Square community area on the South Side of the city.

=== Margate Park ===

Margate Park is situated in the northeast corner of the Uptown community, nestled between the recently rejuvenated strip of new construction on Sheridan Road and the pleasantries of the northern reaches of Lincoln Park. It is bound by Lincoln Park and Sheridan Road to its east and west, and Foster Avenue and Lawrence Avenue to its north and south, respectively.

Its tree-lined streets, historic mansions, and gilded mid-rises reflect the area&#x27;s development in the bustle of Uptown&#x27;s entertainment industry from the early 1900s, now undergoing a burgeoning revitalization. The diverse housing also includes ornate, imposing terracotta clad buildings, immortalized in the movies of early twentieth century Chicago as apartment hotels and boarding houses. Some of these 1920s, Jazz-Age hotels have since been converted to high-end condos and co-ops, adding to the tremendously diverse population of the area. The Margate Park community, as well as much of the Uptown neighborhood of which it is a part, is a popular and thriving home to many of the city&#x27;s LGBT residents. On Margate Park&#x27;s western edge is also one of the city&#x27;s longest running gay bars, Big Chicks, owned and operated for the past 30 years. Designed in 1937 by architect Charles Kristen, its asymmetrical facade, clearly influenced by the 1933-34 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, features dazzling decoration, with yellow vertical piers on a backdrop of cobalt blue, as well as splashes of aqua. The building itself is architecturally significant for its deco facade.

Margate Park contains a Lake Shore Drive underpass near Argyle Avenue adjacent to the Margate Playground, just east of Marine Drive, which permits pedestrians and bikers easy access to the lakefront path and the Foster and Lawrence Avenue beaches.

Many of the houses here were built from the 1890s to the 1920s. Although it has remained a mostly white and wealthy area throughout the 20th century, it is a fairly integrated community. In 1940 some blacks who lived as domestic workers resided in a single block of houses in close proximity to their employers. Those houses were described by Jacalyn D. Harden, author of &quot;Double Cross: Japanese Americans in Black and White Chicago&quot;, as being &quot;modest&quot;.

At 5000 North Marine Drive is The Aquitania, a co-op building constructed in 1923 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2002. The Aquitania was built by Ralph C. Harris and Byron H. Jillson in the Classical Revival style. It was developed by George K. Spoor, the co-founder of Essanay Studios, a producer of silent movies in the first decades of the twentieth century. At this time, Chicago rivaled both New York City and Hollywood in film production, and Spoor was able to use his considerable wealth to build an apartment he felt fitting for the film stars connected with Chicago&#x27;s growing entertainment industry.

== Landmarks ==

=== Uptown Entertainment District ===
Historically a very popular tourist destination, the Uptown Entertainment District is home to various music venues, nightclubs, restaurants and shops. The Uptown Entertainment District is now experiencing a revival, with new restaurants and shops opening every year. Uptown Square, at the center of the Uptown Entertainment District, was designated as a National Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Uptown is also a stop for Chicago Gangster tours, with many locations tied to infamous gangsters such as John Dillinger, Al Capone, Machine Gun Jack McGurn, and Roger Touhy (&quot;Terrible Touhy&quot;).

====Aragon Ballroom====

The Aragon Ballroom is still a very popular music venue. During the 1920s and 1930s, most of the nation&#x27;s well-known jazz groups played the Aragon. Live radio broadcasts from the Aragon helped promote the Aragon&#x27;s entertainers throughout the Midwest and beyond. Hotels quickly sprang up in the Uptown area, and it became a mecca for young adults who visited Chicago to dance to the Big Bands of the 1940s and 1950s. Frank Sinatra, Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Lawrence Welk, Guy Lombardo, Wayne King and other famous bandleaders often played there. In decades to follow, a very diverse selection of &quot;big name&quot; groups have performed, including The Rolling Stones, U2, The Smiths, The Doors, Snoop Dogg, Green Day, Gwen Stefani, The B-52s, Capital Cities, Talking Heads/David Byrne, B.B. King, Robert Plant, Metallica, Tommy Bolin, Morrissey, Queens of the Stone Age, The Clash, Tangerine Dream, deadmau5, Tiësto, Nirvana, and The Ramones.

The Aragon Ballroom is located at the intersection of Lawrence and Winthrop Avenues, just adjacent to the Lawrence Red Line &#x27;L&#x27; stop.

====Riviera Theater====
The Riviera Theater, also a popular music venue, was once a Jazz Age movie palace which featured live jazz performances with the movies. In the 1980s, the seats were removed on the main floor, and it was converted to a concert venue.

====Uptown Theatre====
The Uptown Theatre is a large, ornate movie palace with almost 4,500 seats. The largest in Chicago, this architectural gem is on several Landmark Registers. The Uptown Theatre was designed by famous movie palace architects, Rapp and Rapp, who also designed the Chicago Theatre in the Chicago Loop. It was managed by the Balaban and Katz Company.

The Uptown Theatre as of 2018 will begin renovation, after numerous attempts, by &quot;Friends of the Uptown Theatre&quot; and other local groups to restore and reopen the theater with $75 million renaissance plan. Progress was stymied for years by various legal issues, including disputes by multiple mortgage holders and city liens. However, on August 18, 2008, the Uptown Theatre was sold to Jam Productions Ltd, a Chicago-based music promoter who has committed to bringing a spectacular entertainment venue comparable to the Chicago Theatre in the Loop&#x27;s Theatre District downtown. In November 2019, the Chicago Tribune reported that the start of the renovation was still stalled due to slow private fundraising needed for the project. Development plans, within blocks, call for renovation of the former AON Insurance building to luxury mixed use retail and apartments already in progress, new high-rise apartment/retail building at Broadway and Winona Street, new parking structure on Lawrence at the Redline, and plans for a new high-rise luxury hotel.

A 2006 documentary, , shows the interior of the theatre. It is also featured on the cover of the book &quot;The Chicago Movie Palaces of Balaban and Katz&quot; by David Balaban.

====Green Mill Cocktail Lounge====
The Green Mill Cocktail Lounge is located at 4802 N. Broadway in Chicago, on the site of a much bigger Green Mill Gardens complex, which was an outdoor music gardens fashioned after The Moulin Rouge Gardens in Paris. It was a sunken gardens area, surrounded by a wall and featured nightly entertainment during the summer months. It also featured a dining room which was later converted to the Green Mill Cocktail Lounge during construction of the Uptown Theatre on the former site of the outdoor music gardens. The club was once owned by &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Jack McGurn, a right-hand man of Al Capone, who was a regular patron at The Green Mill. The 1957 movie &quot;The Joker Is Wild&quot; is based on the life of a regular performer at the Green Mill, Joe E. Lewis. Starring Frank Sinatra, the movie is the story about how Lewis tried to leave his gig at the Green Mill and was attacked and left for dead in his apartment. Lewis survived and continued his successful career in California. The Green Mill still hosts top jazz performers. Patricia Barber, internationally acclaimed jazz performer, plays there most Monday nights, as she has for the past 15 + years. In 2008, Kurt Elling was a regularly featured performer with his current band. The Green Mill also hosts a weekly Poetry Slam. Poet Marc Smith is credited for developing the Poetry Slam, and still hosts the weekly events at the Green Mill.

====Baton Show Lounge and Double Door====
In late 2018, it was announced that two established Chicago entertainment venues were moving to Uptown. The Baton Show Lounge which opened in 1969, has hosted many celebrities, and presents drag performance. The popular indie music venue Double Door (established, 1994) plans to reopen the Wilson Avenue Theater. The Wilson first presented vaudeville in 1910, although its classical architecture caused it to be used as a bank for most of the 20th and into the 21st century.

====Former venues====

=====The Rainbo=====
The Rainbo, at 4812 N. Clark Street, was purchased in 2002 and torn down to make way for a new condo and townhouse development. At one point, however, it was a very popular outdoor music garden, fashioned after the Moulin Rouge Gardens in Paris, which is the original namesake for what was then called &quot;Moulin Rouge Gardens.&quot;

Investors bought the Moulin Rouge Gardens property and spent one-million dollars to expand the facility. Opened in 1921, Mann&#x27;s Million Dollar Rainbo Room, named after Fred Mann&#x27;s wartime service in the U.S. Army&#x27;s 42nd Infantry or &quot;Rainbow&quot; Division, was said to be the largest nightclub in America, featuring some of the biggest names in Vaudeville and musical entertainment. Larry Fine was performing there the night he was asked to join The Three Stooges. The Rainbo Room had a revolving stage to allow for continuous entertainment. There was table seating for 2,000 patrons and space on the dance floor for an additional 1,500. Until 1927, WMAQ radio shared the 670 kilohertz frequency with station WQJ, which was owned by the Rainbo and Calumet Baking Powder Company; it broadcast music of the Rainbo&#x27;s performers as a form of promotion.

In 1927, during prohibition, it was converted to a major casino and sports venue, called the Rainbo Fronton.

In 1934, during the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair (Century of Progress), it became French Casino. The French Casino is where John Dillinger spent his birthday, June 22, 1934, a month before he was shot.

In 1939, it became Mike Todd&#x27;s Theater Cafe, which was a popular dinner theater. Tommy Sutton, the Theater Cafe&#x27;s choreographer, went on to work with Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington and Nat King Cole, among others. It was also a venue for Championship Wrestling where, in 1955, the first women&#x27;s tag team wrestling match was held.

In 1957, The Theater Cafe was converted to an ice skating rink, called Rainbo Arena, which was a practice rink for the Chicago Blackhawks including the year they won the 1961 Stanley Cup. The Rainbo Arena was also a training rink for several Olympic figure skaters, and during much of the 1960s was the only indoor hockey rink in the Chicago area open to the public. Several hockey leagues were headquartered at Rainbo, and particularly on weekends, hockey-playing groups would rent the ice at all hours of the day and night.

The south end of the building housed a pro bowling alley in the 1960s which was converted in 1968 into the original Electric Theatre/Kinetic Playground music venue.

In the 1970s and thereafter, Rainbo was a popular late night roller rink until it was torn down for a new housing development called Rainbo Village. When the building was being demolished in 2003, an assortment of human bones and tennis shoes were discovered in what had been the building&#x27;s basement. How the bones and shoes ended up there has remained unresolved.

=====Arcadia Ballroom=====
The Arcadia Ballroom, at 4444 N. Broadway was one of the first Dance Halls in Chicago. Promoter Paddy Harmon, who later developed Dreamland Ballroom and the Chicago Stadium, found that black jazz bands were popular with the Arcadia Ballroom late night crowds. It was one of the few places on the north side of Chicago which would book black jazz bands in the 1920s and 1930s, the other being the Green Mill Jazz Club. The building was destroyed in a fire in the 1950s.

=====5100 Club=====
The 5100 Club, at 5100 N. Broadway, was a nightclub that hosted comedy performances before the advent of television. One regular headliner was Danny Thomas, who was discovered there by the head of the William Morris Agency. Danny would later go on to star in movies and in &quot;Make Room For Daddy&quot;, one of the longest running sitcoms in American Television history.

=== Argyle Street Asian restaurants and shops ===
Argyle Street, from Sheridan to Broadway and spilling onto Broadway, features Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Laotian, French Vietnamese and Cambodian ethnic restaurants and bakeries. There are also many Asian groceries, shops and trading companies that sell unique Asian merchandise. This area is locally called by many different names, including New Chinatown, North Chinatown, Little Chinatown, Little Saigon, New Saigon, Little Cambodia, Vietnamese Town, Little Vietnam, or by many in the Asian community simply as &quot;Argyle&quot;. The surrounding neighborhood, which has attracted Asian immigrants and refugees for the past several decades, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the West Argyle Street Historic District. It is easily reached by the Argyle stop on the Red Line &#x27;L.&#x27;

One block east of the Argyle &#x27;L&#x27; stop, at the corner of Argyle and Winthrop is The Roots of Argyle mural, a community-produced painting depicting 100 years of immigration and daily life on Argyle Street.

=== Graceland Cemetery ===

In southwestern Uptown is historic Graceland Cemetery. Visitors here can find the elaborate tombs of Chicago&#x27;s famed dead. Because some of Chicago&#x27;s famous architects designed memorials and are buried here, the Chicago Architecture Foundation and the Chicago History Museum offer several walking tours of the cemetery during the spring, summer, and fall.

=== Winthrop Family Historical Garden ===
The Winthrop Family Historical Garden was established in 2009 as a community greenspace on the 4600 block of Winthrop. It was renovated in 2022 through a City of Chicago Public Outdoor Plaza (POP!) grant. It commemorates the history of 4600 block of North Winthrop Avenue, which in 1931 was listed due to restrictive covenants by Chicago Uptown Association as the only block African Americans could live or open establishments. The residents developed a close-knit community they named the &quot;Winthrop Family&quot;

== Amenities ==

=== Parks and leisure ===
Uptown is full of parkland, chiefly Lincoln Park, providing ample opportunity for sports, leisure, and nature exploration.

For sports and exercise, Lincoln Park contains soccer and athletic fields, the Chicago lakefront bicycle/running path, a golf course, a sledding hill, and the Wilson Skate Park. Chase Park, located on the west side of Clark Street at Leland Avenue, has indoor and outdoor athletic facilities, as well as an outdoor pool and tennis courts. Clarendon Park and Margate Park, both feature athletic fields, children&#x27;s playgrounds and indoor sports facilities.

Dog lovers can visit Uptown&#x27;s Montrose Dog Beach or its Puptown Dog Park in Margate Park. Other leisure opportunities include Montrose Beach and Montrose Harbor, a marina for local and transient boaters and home to the Chicago Corinthian Yacht Club.

The Montrose Beach Dunes Natural Area features dunes, wetlands, and the Montrose Point Bird Sanctuary that provide refuge for endangered plants and animals. One block north, the Uptown Natural Area provides nature trails through six aces of prairie and savanna.

<doc id="808576" wikidata="Q158921" url="?curid=808576" title="Clavering, Essex">
<text>Clavering is a village and civil parish in the Uttlesford district, in north-west Essex in England. It is about from Cambridge and from Southend-on-Sea. The name &#x27;Clavering&#x27; means &#x27;place where clover grows&#x27;. In 2011 it had a population of 1461.

==Location and local area==
Clavering lies 20 miles (32 km) south of Cambridge on the River Stort, close to the border with Hertfordshire. It is one of over 100 villages in the district of Uttlesford. Local towns are Saffron Walden, which is just over six miles north-east of the village, and Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, eight miles to the south. The closest railway stations are Newport and Audley End. Clavering is 10 miles from Stansted Airport.

Today, Clavering is a large and scattered village community that encompasses seven &#x27;greens&#x27; and three &#x27;ends&#x27;, namely: Hill Green, Stickling Green, Starling&#x27;s Green, Roast Green, Sheepcote Green, Birds Green, Deer&#x27;s Green, Mill End, Ford End and Further Ford End. It retains many old timber-framed and thatched buildings. The oldest remaining parts of medieval Clavering&#x27;s village centre are around Church End and Middle Street, close to the church and the river.

==Village amenities==
The village has a large playing field, Jubilee Field, with bowls and tennis facilities and a children&#x27;s play area. The adjoining Simon&#x27;s Wood provides access to many countryside walks. The area has several accessible fishing lakes, which attract anglers. These include Clavering Lakes, a series of five purpose-built lakes created in 1991. Clavering has a primary school and large village shop with the post office being on Stortford Road, and there is a long-established garden centre/nursery on Hill Green called FW Whyman.

Village clubs and societies include Clavering Players, an amateur drama company that began life in 1945 as Cheerio&#x27;s Concert Party. Clavering Cricket Club plays on Hill Green and has done so since the turn of the 20th century. The pavilion was built in 1950 and features seating from Lord&#x27;s, the home of English cricket.

Chef and TV presenter Jamie Oliver comes from Clavering, and lived there until he sold his property to Daisy Ridley in 2019. Jamie&#x27;s parents Trevor and Sally ran one of the two village pubs, The Cricketers, from the 1970s until 2021. The Fox and Hounds is at the other end of the village, opposite the River Stort. Both pubs attract people from nearby villages such as Arkesden, Wicken Bonhunt and Langley Upper Green, as well as Clavering residents.

==Places of historic interest==

Notable sites in Clavering include Clavering Castle and the former Clavering guildhall, now known as The Bury. The remains of the castle are now just ringworks and earthworks. The castle is believed to date from pre-Norman times. The former guildhall is a medieval Grade II* listed building. Constructed in the early 14th century, it was restored following a fire in 1991.

The parish Church of St Mary &amp; St Clement is largely 15th-century but contains some evidence of a pre-medieval church that stood on the site. Notable objects include the carved Elizabethan pulpit and stained glass. There is a memorial in the church to Mary Wales, whose brother Charles Green and husband William Wales sailed on Captain James Cook&#x27;s first and second voyages.

Two other church buildings stand in Clavering. There is a brick built Primitive Methodist chapel (now a private home), dating from 1877 to 1878, on Hill Green. Clavering Christian Centre, now an ecumenical church/community centre, is on Stortford Road in a building that originally housed a Congregational church.

==The Moat Farm murder and &#x27;Sally Arsenic&#x27;==

Two notorious murder cases are part of the village&#x27;s history. The Moat Farm Murder in 1903 attracted scores of sightseers after the body of Camille Cecile Holland was dug up in the grounds of Moat Farm, the place of residence she had acquired whilst presenting herself as the wife of Samuel Herbert Dougal. Dougal was married to another woman by the name of Sarah (née Sarah Henrietta White) who, once Miss Holland had been disposed of, took up residence at the Moat Farm, pretending, initially at least, to be Dougal&#x27;s daughter. This pretence nevertheless was soon dropped when she started wearing clothes known to have been the property of Miss Holland. Samuel Herbert Dougal was hanged for the crime yet Sarah escaped all scrutiny and disappeared from all records from that time onward.

Some 50 years earlier, Sarah Chesham (known locally as &#x27;Sally Arsenic&#x27;) was hanged for the attempted murder of her husband. Previously she had been tried and acquitted for the murder of her two sons and the illegitimate son of a neighbour, and this &quot;bad character&quot; led to the police and coroner disregarding the initial inquest&#x27;s findings that there was insufficient evidence to bring the case to trial. Unlike the previous three trials, Sarah did not have legal counsel in this final trial and was left to defend herself from the dubious account put forward by an old friend she had fallen out with, the assertions of a well respected expert, who himself had admitted in a letter that the amount of arsenic present in Richard&#x27;s body was not enough to bring a case to trial, and a jury influenced by sensationalised media coverage that had persisted since the original three trials. Unsurprisingly, the illiterate wife of a farm labourer was unable to convince the jury of her innocence. However, in 2019 the conviction was deemed unsafe by the BBC TV programme &quot;Murder, Mystery and My Family&quot;, during which, the barrister acting for the prosecution advised the judge that Sarah should not have been found guilty.

This case influenced a change in the law on selling arsenic, requiring vendors to make a note of the purchaser&#x27;s name, address and reason for needing poison.

==Governance==

An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward had a population of 1,461 at the 2011 Census.

Clavering parish is within the local government district of Uttlesford and the North West Essex Parliamentary constituency.

<text>Father Francisco Ayerra de Santa María (1630–1708) is considered to be Puerto Rico&#x27;s first native born poet.

==Early years==
Santa Maria was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he received his primary and secondary education. He went to Mexico as a young and enrolled in the University of Mexico, where he earned a degree in Canonic Law. Following this, he was ordained as priest.
It was in Mexico that Santa Maria wrote most of his works and became successful as a poet. His Poetic style was known as &quot;cultural&quot;, because it was based on religious and historical themes. He wrote his verses in both Spanish and Latin. His work has been included in many anthologies.

==First rector of the Tridentino Seminary in Mexico==
In 1690, Carlos de Sigüenza, a Mexican Intellectual, became fascinated with the adventures of Puerto Rican named Alonzo Ramirez, who as a child embarked from San Juan, Puerto Rico on an adventurous voyage in 1675, that would take him around the world and eventually to his final destination Yucatan, Mexico. Sigüenza wrote the book titled &quot;Infortunios de Alonso Ramírez&quot; (The Misfortunes of Alonso Ramirez) where he narrated these adventures. Archival evidence recently discovered by Fabio López-Lázaro proves not only the existence of Ramírez but also the historical accuracy of his experiences with pirates, most noticeably William Dampier, as narrated by Sigüenza. Santa Maria held the position of Censor from the Holy Office in Mexico when he was approached by Sigüenza. During this period of time, the church would normally censor that type of work, however Santa Maria who like Ramirez was also a native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, overlooked his obligations and cleared it for publication. It is believed that Alonso Ramirez is the first Puerto Rican to have traveled around the world. Eventually, Santa Maria became the first rector of the Tridentino Seminary in Mexico. Father Francisco Ayerra de Santa Maria died in Mexico in 1708.

<doc id="808585" wikidata="Q1135237" url="?curid=808585" title="Skeleton Coast">
<text>The Skeleton Coast is the northern part of the Atlantic coast of Namibia. Immediately south of Angola, it stretches from the Kunene River to the Swakop River, although the name is sometimes used to describe the entire Namib Desert coast. The indigenous San people (formerly known as Bushmen), of the Namibian interior called the region &quot;The Land God Made in Anger&quot;, while Portuguese sailors once referred to it as &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot;.

On the coast, the upwelling of the cold Benguela current gives rise to dense ocean fogs (called &quot;cassimbo&quot; by the Angolans) for much of the year. The winds blow from land to sea, rainfall rarely exceeds annually, and the climate is highly inhospitable. There is a constant, heavy surf on the beaches. In the days before engine-powered ships and boats, it was possible to get ashore through the surf, but impossible to launch from the shore. The only way out was by going through a marsh hundreds of kilometres long and only accessible via a hot and arid desert.

The coast is largely made up of soft sand occasionally interrupted by rocky outcrops. The southern section consists of gravel plains, while north of Terrace Bay the landscape is dominated by high sand dunes.

Skeleton Bay is known as a great location for surfing.

==Etymology==

The area&#x27;s name derives from the whale and seal bones that once littered the shore, partly due to the whaling industry, although in modern times the coast also harbours the skeletal remains of the shipwrecks caused by offshore rocks and fog. More than a thousand such vessels of various sizes litter the coast, notably the &quot;Eduard Bohlen&quot;, &quot;Benguela Eagle&quot;, &quot;Otavi&quot;, &quot;Dunedin Star&quot; and &quot;Tong Taw&quot;.

The name &quot;Skeleton Coast&quot; was coined by John Henry Marsh as the title for the book he wrote chronicling the shipwreck of the &quot;Dunedin Star&quot;. Since the book was first published in 1944, it has become so well known that the coast is now generally referred to as &quot;Skeleton Coast&quot; and is named so on most maps today. See , below.

==History==
One of the oldest shipwrecks in the Skeleton Coast region is that of the &quot;Bom Jesus&quot;, near the town of Oranjemund. It ran aground during the 1530s and is known to be one of the oldest discovered shipwrecks of the Iberian Atlantic tradition in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

Past human occupation by Strandlopers is shown by shell middens of white mussels found along parts of the Skeleton Coast.

In 1942 the British refrigerated cargo liner &quot;Dunedin Star&quot; ran aground. All her 106 passengers and crew were eventually rescued, but at the cost of a tug, an SAAF aircraft and the lives of two rescuers. The account is recorded in a book &quot;Skeleton Coast&quot; by John Henry Marsh.

On Thursday, 22 March 2018, a Japanese registered fishing vessel, MVF &quot;Fukuseki Maru&quot;, got into trouble and ran aground near Durissa Bay, south of the Ugab River mouth, lying 2 km from the Skeleton Coast beach in the ocean. All 24 foreign crew members were rescued by Namibian authorities.

==Wildlife==

Namibia has declared the area of coastline and adjacent deserts, scrub and marshlands as Skeleton Coast National Park, from the Ugab River to the Kunene. The northern half of the park is a designated wilderness area. Notable features are the clay castles of the Hoarusib River, the Agate Mountain salt pans, and the large brown fur seal colonies at Cape Fria. The remainder of the coast is the National West Coast Recreation Area. The national park is part of the Iona – Skeleton Coast Transfrontier Conservation Area.

The coast has been the subject of a number of wildlife documentaries, particularly concerning adaptations to extreme aridity, such as the 1965 &quot;National Geographic&quot; documentary &quot;Survivors of the Skeleton Coast&quot;. Many of the native species of succulent plants depend on the thick sea fogs, which roll-in from the coast, for their moisture; in addition to water droplets for their hydration, windblown detritus from the arid interior serves as a food source for numerous invertebrates, which, in turn, feed the herpetofauna and form the base of the desert food chain. The desert bird assemblages have been studied in terms of their thermoregulation, coloration, breeding strategies and nomadism.

The riverbeds and flatlands further away from the beaches are home to bush elephants, Chacma baboons, southern giraffe, lions, leopard, black rhinoceros, spotted and brown hyenas, gemsbok and springbok, among many other species. The animals get most of their water from wells dug by one another, in addition to consuming various water-laden succulent plants. The black rhinoceros population was the main reason why the CBBC show &quot;Serious Desert&quot; was filmed in the region.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;Skeleton Coast&quot; is a novel by Clive Cussler that uses the shifting sands of the coastline as a prominent plot device in the fourth entry in the Oregon Files.

<text>Jacob Penner (August 12, 1880 – August 28, 1965) was a popular international socialist politician in Canada. A founder of the Social Democratic Party of Canada and the Communist Party of Canada, Penner was elected to the Winnipeg city council in 1933. He would remain at that post until 1960, becoming the longest serving elected Communist city council member in North America.

During World War II, Penner would become the first Canadian Communist interned for political security reasons. He would be incarcerated from June 1940 until being granted his release in July 1942.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Jacob Penner was born August 12, 1880, in or near Ekaterinoslav (today&#x27;s Dnipropetrovsk), Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire, to a German-speaking Mennonite family. Appalled by the poverty among the peasantry in the Tsarist regime, Penner became a revolutionary socialist at an early age — political activity which forced him to emigrate to Canada in 1904.

Upon arriving in Canada, Penner worked for a time in the fruit orchards of British Columbia. He then moved east to the prairie city of Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1906, where he worked as a clerk and floral designer in a florist firm. It was there that he met his future wife, Rose Shapack, a Jewish Russian immigrant, in 1906 during an address by Emma Goldman at the Winnipeg Radical Club. The pair married in 1912.

Penner would continue to work as a florist until 1917. He then moved to a position as a bookkeeper for the Workers&#x27; and Farmers&#x27; Cooperative Company in Winnipeg, where he would remain until the early 1930s.

A Marxist, he helped found the Social Democratic Party of Canada and was an opponent of conscription during the Conscription crisis of 1917. Penner was active in the Canadian One Big Union movement (OBU), and played a role as an organiser of the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919.

===First electoral campaigns===
In 1921, he participated in the founding of the Communist Party of Canada and was the party&#x27;s western organiser. That fall he ran as the candidate of the Workers&#x27; Alliance, the &quot;legal political party&quot; associated with the underground Communist Party at that time for the House of Commons of Canada in Winnipeg North.

With little hope of winning office in the election, Penner made use of the campaign to advocate for world revolution, not hesitating to declare his allegiance to the Communist International and appealing for the overthrow of capitalism. He declared in a published election statement during the 1921 federal campaign that
&quot;The Communist Revolution can triumph only as a world revolution... In the years 1917, 1918, 1919, all the powers sought to overthrow Soviet Russia; in 1919 they throttled Soviet Hungary... The existence of the proletarian dictatorship is in constant danger if the workers of other countries do not rally to its support... The international solidarity of the proletariat is not merely a toy or a fine phrase for the workers, but a vital necessity, without which the cause of the working class is doomed to destruction.&quot;

In the 1921 race, Penner drew a total of 565 votes in the urban Winnipeg North electoral district in a losing campaign.

Penner also stood as a Communist in the 1927 Manitoba provincial election, garnering 2,015 votes on the first count in another losing effort.

===Communist city council member===
Penner first ran in a Winnipeg city political race in 1931 when he was selected as the Communist candidate for Mayor of Winnipeg. He would garner 3,954 votes out of 52,572 cast (7.5%), finishing in fourth place in a five candidate race.

Penner would run again in the annual election of 1932. In his second effort at election as Winnipeg Mayor, Penner captured 3,495 votes out of 49,387 ballots cast (7.1%), finishing in last place in a four-person race.

In 1933, after Communist Party Political Committee member Leslie Morris was stricken from the ballot on a legal technicality, Penner was tapped as a Communist candidate for Winnipeg&#x27;s city council. In the November 1933 election Penner topped all vote-getters in the city&#x27;s North End to win election, assuming his seat on January 2, 1934. Penner would be regularly re-elected as a Winnipeg alderman, holding the position until 1960, excepting a time during WWII when he was put in a concentration camp for being a Communist. Penner thereby became the longest serving elected Communist alderman in North America.

Penner was very popular among his constituents in the city&#x27;s impoverished north end and attracted support from across party lines. He was an early advocate of a minimum wage and unemployment insurance and used his political position to campaign for these reforms.

In addition to his service in municipal politics, Penner stood for higher electoral office at least two more times, running again for the provincial legislature in the election of 1932, picking up 1,106 votes in a losing effort, and in the 1958 Manitoba election, in which he received 588 votes running in the St. Johns riding.

When he retired in 1960, fellow Communist Joseph Zuken was elected to succeed him on the Winnipeg City Council. Zuken would serve into the 1980s.

===Wartime internment===
During World War II, Penner became the first Canadian Communist interned for security reasons, being arrested on June 11, 1940 under Regulation 21 of the Defence of Canada Regulations. This allowed for the Minister of Justice, in this case Ernest Lapointe, to order the arrest and detention of individuals deemed dangerous to public safety as prisoners of war. Penner was just beginning his third term of office as an elected member of the Winnipeg City Council at the time of his arrest.

Arrested together with John Naviziwsky as &quot;active and dangerous Communists,&quot; Penner was interred in a camp for political prisoners located at Kananaskis, Alberta, outside of Calgary. The pair were held at the Kananaskis internment camp with several hundred Germans suspected of Nazi sympathies.

Penner was unseated from the Winnipeg City Council as a result of his incarceration in a concentration camp, only to be replaced in a by-election by former Communist member of the Winnipeg City Council Martin &quot;Joe&quot; Forkin, who ran of necessity as an &quot;Independent.&quot;

Following Soviet entry into the war on the side of the British Empire, France, and the United States in the summer of 1941, Penner&#x27;s incarceration became a &quot;cause célèbre,&quot; with Winnipeg politicians from across the political spectrum advocating for his pardon, culminating in Penner&#x27;s release in July 1942. Following his release, Penner joined his Communist Party associates in advocating publicly for the immediate opening of a second front in Europe to take military pressure off the Soviet Union, which was fighting for its survival in the aftermath of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Operation Barbarossa.

===Death and legacy===
Penner died on August 28, 1965. He was 85 years old at the time of his death.

One son, Roland Penner, joined the Manitoba New Democratic Party and served as the province&#x27;s Attorney-General in the 1980s. Another son, Norman Penner, was a professor at York University and historian of Canadian radicalism.

<text>Wolf Gunther Plaut, (November 1, 1912 – February 8, 2012) was an American Reform rabbi and writer who was based in Canada. Plaut was the rabbi of Holy Blossom Temple in Toronto for several decades and since 1978 was its senior scholar.

==Life and work==
He was born in Münster, Germany. His father&#x27;s name was Jonas and his mother&#x27;s name was Selma. Gunther had a younger brother, Walter, who was the Rabbi of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck, NY at the time of his death in 1964 at the age of 44. Gunther received his Doctor of Laws degree and in 1935 fled the Nazis and went to the United States. In 1939, he received his ordination as a Rabbi from Hebrew Union College. After receiving his U.S. citizenship on March 31, 1943, he enlisted as a chaplain in the U.S. Army. He was eventually assigned to the 104th Infantry &quot;Timberwolf&quot; Division and served as a frontline chaplain with the 104th in Belgium and Germany. He held pulpits in Chicago, Illinois 1939-49) and at Mount Zion Temple in St. Paul, Minnesota (1948–1961). He moved to Holy Blossom Temple in 1961, replacing Abraham Feinberg.

He published a volume of commentary on the Torah and Haftarah, which has become the standard Humash used by the Reform movement. He was a long-time columnist for the &quot;Canadian Jewish News&quot; as well as a contributor of opinion pieces to various Canadian newspapers such as &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. He was the first recipient of the W. Gunther Plaut Humanitarian Award. In 1978, he was the honoree of the Toronto Jewish National Fund Negev Dinner.

He was president of the Canadian Jewish Congress from 1977 to 1980, and was also vice-chair of the Ontario Human Rights Commission. In 1983, he was elected president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the international association for Reform rabbis.

In 1978 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1999. In 1993, he was awarded the Order of Ontario. In 1999, he received the Commander&#x27;s Cross (Komturkreuz) of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.

A number of years ago, Plaut was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and withdrew from all public activities. In February 2012, he died at Baycrest Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada at the age of 99.

His son, Jonathan V. Plaut, was also a Reform rabbi, who served as rabbi of Temple Beth Israel in Jackson, Michigan.
His nephew, Rabbi Joshua Eli Plaut, Ph.D (son of Rabbi Walter H. and Hadassah Y. Plaut) is the director of the New York City based American Friends of Rabin Medical Center.

<text>Cheryl Rae Tiegs (born September 25, 1947) is an American model and fashion designer. Frequently described as America&#x27;s first supermodel,&lt;ref name=&quot;Swim Daily/SI&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tiegs made multiple appearances on the covers of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue and &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Her 1978 &quot;Pink Bikini&quot; poster became an iconic image of 1970s pop culture.

== Early life ==
Tiegs was born in Breckenridge, Minnesota, to Phyllis and Theodore Tiegs, an auto-assembly lineman turned funeral director. She and her family moved to Alhambra, California, in 1952. She is of German descent. Tiegs was encouraged to start modeling by a friend. Regarding the start of her career, Tiegs stated,

As a senior at Alhambra High School, Tiegs posed for a swimsuit ad for bathing suit manufacturer Cole of California; the ad, which appeared in &quot;Seventeen&quot;, launched her career as a model. Although she enrolled as an English major at California State University, Los Angeles, she left college before her junior year in order to pursue her career.

== Career ==
Tiegs&#x27;s break as a model came when she was 17, after the editorial staff at &quot;Glamour&quot; saw the Cole bathing suit ad. Bypassing the traditional in-person meeting, Tiegs was booked on a shoot in Saint Thomas with Ali MacGraw, which resulted in her first &quot;Glamour&quot; cover. Later that same year, Tiegs made the covers of &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;Elle&quot;. She subsequently appeared on the covers of &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, among others.

Tiegs was the first model to appear twice on the cover of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue, but she significantly raised her profile in 1978, when she posed in a fishnet swimsuit. Tiegs additionally made the cover of &quot;People&quot; four times, and did three covers for &quot;Time&quot;, most notably for the &quot;All-American Model&quot; cover story in 1978. A year later, she was signed to a reported $1.5 million two-year contract with Cover Girl cosmetics, then the biggest contract ever. In 2004, Tiegs was inducted into the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue″s 40th anniversary &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;, and was included on &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; 2008 50 Most Beautiful People list, and &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2012 &quot;100 Hottest Women of All Time&quot; feature. Tiegs posed in 2001 in a bikini for the cover of &quot;More&quot;, and earned considerable praise for breaking age barriers related to fitness, fashion, and beauty.

Tiegs met photographer Peter Beard in New York in 1978. In 1979, she traveled to Kenya with him on a photographic expedition to investigate the management and widespread destruction of African wildlife; their journey was documented in an Emmy-winning episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The American Sportsman&quot; titled &quot;Africa: End of the Game&quot;. Tiegs and Beard were married in 1981; between 1978 and 1982 she traveled back and forth between the US and Hog Ranch in Kenya. In 1979, &quot;Look&quot; magazine ran a cover story titled &quot;Cheryl Tiegs: The New African Queen&quot;. She was also featured on the cover of &quot;Outside&quot; in 1980.
In 1980, Tiegs launched a signature line of clothing and accessories for Sears. The first retail venture by a supermodel, the Cheryl Tiegs collection neared $1 billion in sales by 1989. Tiegs was credited with helping the retail chain&#x27;s 1980s turnaround, and once again appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;, this time for a cover story titled &quot;Sassy Sears&quot;. A doll in her likeness was created in 1990 as part of the &quot;Real Model Collection&quot;, which additionally featured Christie Brinkley and Beverly Johnson. In 1995, Tiegs established Cheryl Tiegs Sportwear, which sold exclusively on QVC. She also developed a line of wigs and hair accessories for Revlon.

In 2012, Tiegs was a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, with proceeds from her participation benefiting the Farrah Fawcett Foundation. She has also appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Just Shoot Me&quot;, Oxygen&#x27;s &quot;Girls Behaving Badly&quot; and, in a recurring role, portraying herself in &quot;Family Guy&quot;. Tiegs hosted a 13-part travel adventure series, &quot;Pathfinders: Exotic Journeys&quot; for the Travel Channel, appeared as a judge on the ABC reality show &quot;True Beauty&quot;, and was a regular guest on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. Additionally, Tiegs has frequently appeared on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Extra&quot;, and &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot;. Her film credits include Vincent Gallo&#x27;s &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;, and &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot; with John C. Reilly. Tiegs created and was featured in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s exercise video &quot;Aerobic Interval Training&quot;.

Tiegs is the spokeswoman for &quot;Renewal: A Time for You&quot;, a program created by Deepak Chopra which offers practical advice on healthy lifestyle changes for women in transition. Additionally, she is the spokesperson for Cambria, a producer of natural quartz surfaces.

== Philanthropy and activism ==
Tiegs is active in the philanthropic community, and serves on the Board of Directors of C.O.A.C.H. for Kids and the Earth Conservation Corps. She is a spokeswoman for City of Hope and an Ambassador for the International Planned Parenthood Foundation. Tiegs also supports the Macula Vision Research Foundation, I Am Waters, and the Farrah Fawcett Foundation. As an activist, Tiegs explored the effects of global warming via an expedition to the Arctic. She also participated in a General Motors environmental program, driving a hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicle for three months to raise awareness for zero emissions. In 2010, she appeared on &quot;Living with Ed&quot;, to promote environmentally conscious living, and was named &quot;Green Star of the Week&quot; by &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;.

== Personal life==
Tiegs has been married four times: to film director Stan Dragoti (from 1970 to 1979); to photographer Peter Beard (from 1981 to 1983); to Anthony Peck (from 1990 to 1995), son of actor Gregory Peck; and to yoga instructor Rod Stryker (from 1998 to 2001). She has three sons: Zachary (born in 1991), with Anthony Peck, and twins Theo and Jaden (born in 2000), who were delivered via surrogacy during her marriage to Stryker.

<doc id="808613" wikidata="Q1078252" url="?curid=808613" title="Lee Smith (baseball)">
<text>Lee Arthur Smith (born December 4, 1957) is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 18 years in Major League Baseball (MLB) for eight teams. Serving mostly as a relief pitcher during his career, he was a dominant closer, was the first pitcher to reach 400 saves, and held the major league record for career saves from 1993 until 2006, when Trevor Hoffman passed his total of 478. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame as part of the class of by the Today&#x27;s Game Era Committee.

A native of Jamestown in Bienville Parish in north Louisiana, Smith was scouted by Buck O&#x27;Neil and was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the 1975 MLB draft. Smith was an intimidating figure on the pitcher&#x27;s mound at and with a 95-mile-per-hour (150 km/h) fastball. In 1991, he set a National League (NL) record with 47 saves for the St. Louis Cardinals, and was runner-up for the league&#x27;s Cy Young Award; it was the second of three times Smith led the NL in saves, and he later led the American League (AL) in saves once. When he retired, he held the major league record for career games finished (802) and was third in games pitched (1,022). He holds the Cubs&#x27; team record for career saves (180), and held the same record for the Cardinals (160) until 2006.

After his playing career, Smith worked as a pitching instructor in Minor League Baseball for the San Francisco Giants. He served as the pitching coach for the South Africa national baseball team in the World Baseball Classics of 2006 and 2009.

==Early life==
Smith attended high school in Castor, Louisiana, where his favorite sport was basketball; he did not play on the baseball team until he was a junior. Smith said he began playing only because his brother bet him $10 that he couldn’t handle the position of catcher. Negro leagues veteran Buck O&#x27;Neil is credited with having scouted him.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
At age 17, Smith was selected in the second round of the 1975 MLB draft by the Chicago Cubs with the 28th overall pick. The Cubs, via O&#x27;Neil, were able to get Smith under contract for a $50,000 signing bonus plus $8,000 for his education.

Smith began his professional career as a starting pitcher, first playing in the rookie-level Gulf Coast League in 1975. He played in Class A in 1976 and 1977 with the Pompano Beach Cubs, then in Double-A during 1978 and 1979 with the Midland Cubs. In 1978, Smith struggled with Midland in the Texas League, walking 128 batters in 155 innings pitched. When the team moved him to the bullpen, Smith felt he was being demoted and nearly quit the team; a talk from former Cubs outfielder Billy Williams convinced him to stay. Smith returned to Midland in 1979, lowering his earned run average (ERA) by a full run compared to the prior season (5.98 to 4.93). In 1980, Smith played in Triple-A with the Wichita Aeros of the American Association, recording 15 saves and a 3.70 ERA.

===Chicago Cubs (1980–1987)===
Smith made his major league debut with the Cubs, who were struggling to a last-place finish, on September 1, 1980, against the Atlanta Braves. He pitched a scoreless inning and recorded his first MLB strikeout, coming against Glenn Hubbard. Smith made 18 relief appearances through the end of the season, pitching to a 2.91 ERA with a 2–0 record. He returned to the Cubs for the 1981 season, and was used mostly as a middle relief pitcher. His first major league save came on August 29, when he recorded the final five outs of a 3–1 Cubs win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Smith had an ERA of 3.94 through early June, when the season was interrupted by the 1981 Major League Baseball strike. He finished the season with an ERA of 3.51 and a 3–6 record, coming in 39 relief appearances plus a single start at the end of the season.

During the 1982 season, closing for the Cubs was shared between Smith, Willie Hernández, Bill Campbell and Dick Tidrow, each of whom finished at least 25 games while registering 17, 10, 8, and 6 saves, respectively. Smith also started five games between June 16 and July 5, registering a no decision followed by four consecutive losses. These five starts, along with the start at the end of the 1981 season, were the only six starts that Smith made during his major league career. Smith also collected his first MLB hit, coming on July 5 against Atlanta, a second-inning home run off of Phil Niekro. Smith only collected two additional hits, one each in 1983 and 1984, registering a career batting average of .047 (3-for-64).

Ferguson Jenkins, who had pitched for the Cubs from 1966 to 1973, returned to the Cubs for the final two seasons of his career, 1982 and 1983. Years later, Smith credited Jenkins with simplifying his delivery, introducing him to the slider and forkball, and teaching him how to set up hitters. Smith subsequently led the Cubs in games finished and saves for each of the 1983 through 1987 seasons.

During his first 10 appearances of 1983, Smith allowed no runs while allowing only three hits and striking out 12 batters in innings pitched; his ERA was not above 1.85 at any point during the year. His overall 1.65 ERA for the season proved to be the lowest of his major league career, nearly two runs better than the NL average of 3.63, and he also posted a career-best 1.074 WHIP. He led the NL with 29 saves and 56 games finished. Smith was selected to his first All-Star Game, allowing two runs (one earned) on two hits in an inning of work as his NL team lost the 1983 mid-summer classic to the AL, 13–3. Smith received a point in the NL&#x27;s Cy Young Award voting and eight points in the NL Most Valuable Player Award voting.

The 1984 Cubs made the franchise&#x27;s first postseason appearance since 1945, and were the first of only two playoff teams that Smith played for (the other being the 1988 Red Sox). Smith saved more than 30 games for the first time in his career, but compiled a 3.65 ERA, his worst of the decade. In the postseason, he appeared in two games of the NL Championship Series. In Game 2, Smith earned the save in a 4–2 Cubs win by recording the final two outs. The win gave the Cubs a two-games-to-none lead in the best-of-five series, but the San Diego Padres won the next three games to deny the Cubs a berth in the 1984 World Series. Smith took the loss in Game 4: entering in the bottom of the eighth with the game tied, 5–5, he allowed one hit and kept the game tied; in the bottom of the ninth, he allowed a one-out single to Tony Gwynn, followed by a two-run walk-off home run by Steve Garvey to force a deciding fifth game. Smith did not pitch in Game 5, and San Diego won the final game of the series with a score of 6–3.

In 1985, Smith for the first time dominated the league in strikeouts as a relief pitcher. After averaging fewer than eight strikeouts per nine innings in each prior season, he improved to 10.32 in 1985. He finished the season with a career-high 112 strikeouts in only innings pitched. Smith saved more than 30 games while the Cubs had losing records in 1985, 1986 and 1987. In 1987, he was chosen for his second All-Star Game. When the midsummer classic went into extra innings, Smith pitched the 10th, 11th and 12th innings, striking out four and getting credit for the win when the NL scored the only two runs of the game in the 13th. With his 30th save in 1987, Smith became only the second pitcher (joining Dan Quisenberry) to reach the mark in four consecutive seasons. One player told writers Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo for their book, &quot;Baseball Confidential&quot;, that one of the most daunting sights in the majors was Smith throwing &quot;pure gas from out of the shadows&quot; of Wrigley Field, which did not have lights at the time.

Despite his numbers, rumors were swirling about his weight and its effect on his knees, and his request for a trade out of Chicago. On December 8, Smith, the team&#x27;s career leader in saves, was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al Nipper and Calvin Schiraldi. While Smith registered nearly 300 saves after the trade, Nipper only pitched in 31 more major-league games, while Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30.

===Boston Red Sox (1988–1990)===
The Boston Red Sox finished the 1987 season with a losing record, at 78–84. One of the main problems was a weak bullpen, leading to Boston&#x27;s acquisition of Smith in December 1987. Despite giving up a game-winning home run in his 1988 Opening Day debut at Fenway Park, Smith posted an ERA of 2.80 in 64 regular season appearances, his lowest ERA since 1983 (1.65). The Red Sox finished first in the American League East division with a regular season record of 89–73. In Smith&#x27;s second (and final) appearance in the postseason, he made two appearances in the AL Championship Series. Against the Oakland Athletics, he was the losing pitcher in Game 2, allowing the winning run via three ninth-inning singles. In Game 4, with Boston down three games to none and trailing 2–1, Smith allowed two insurance runs in the eighth inning as Oakland completed the series sweep.

Entering 1989, Smith&#x27;s salary rose to $1.425 million. His ERA for the season was 3.57, his highest since 1984 (3.65), and he only pitched innings, his lowest total since 1981 (). He recorded a career-high of 12.2 strikeouts per nine innings. The Red Sox finished at 83–79, third place in their division.

For the 1980s, Smith recorded 234 saves in 580 MLB relief appearances, with an ERA of 2.95. Smith and Jeff Reardon are considered to be among the top relievers of the decade, with Reardon recording 264 saves in 507 relief appearances with a 3.06 ERA for the decade. In December 1989, the Red Sox signed free agent Reardon to a three-year, $6.8 million contract. During the first month of the 1990 season, both Smith and Reardon pitched for the Red Sox, with Smith earning four saves and Reardon earning one. On May 4, the Red Sox chose to bolster their offense and traded Smith to the St. Louis Cardinals for outfielder Tom Brunansky. Overall in his two-plus seasons in Boston, Smith had appeared in 139 games while collecting 58 saves; in innings pitched he struck out 209 batters.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1990–1993)===
Smith made his St. Louis debut on May 6, 1990, allowing two runs on three hits in an inning of work during a 5–1 loss. He made 53 appearances with the 1990 Cardinals, registering 27 saves with a 2.10 ERA while striking out 70 batters in innings. He also had a stretch of 16 consecutive appearances without allowing a run, spanning late June to early August. The team, however, finished at 70–92 and in last place.

In 1991, St. Louis improved to 84–78, while Smith recorded a career-high 47 saves. He surpassed the National League record for saves on October 1, previously held by Bruce Sutter and set in 1984 when Sutter also played for the Cardinals. With Smith&#x27;s salary roughly doubled to nearly $2.8 million, this was the first of four consecutive seasons during which he had over 40 saves. Smith won his first Rolaids Relief Man Award, received the most significant consideration for league MVP in his career (finishing eighth in NL MVP voting), and finished second in Cy Young Award voting behind Tom Glavine.

Smith again led the NL in saves in 1992, registering 43. In 70 appearances, he struck out 60 batters in 75 innings, while recording a 3.12 ERA; he also won his second Rolaids Relief Man Award. In a game on September 23, 1992, Smith committed an error; he had last committed an error in a National League game on June 30, 1982, while with the Cubs. This span of 546 appearances was the NL record for consecutive errorless games by a pitcher until broken by Heath Bell in 2013.

In 1993, Smith passed Jeff Reardon in MLB career saves on April 13 with save number 358, and passed Bruce Sutter on April 14 for the National League&#x27;s career saves record, recording NL save number 301, compiled with the Cubs and Cardinals. In June, Smith had 15 saves, which set an MLB record for the most saves in any month. On August 31, with St. Louis 10 games behind the Philadelphia Phillies, seemingly out of contention, and with Smith poised to become a free agent after the season, the Cardinals traded Smith to the Yankees for reliever Rich Batchelor. With St. Louis, Smith recorded 43 saves in 55 appearances during 1993, striking out 49 batters in 50 innings, albeit with a 4.50 ERA. He left the Cardinals as their all-time save leader (160) until Jason Isringhausen passed him on June 13, 2006. Smith&#x27;s NL single-season record of 47 saves was bested by both Rod Beck of the San Francisco Giants and Randy Myers of the Cubs two years later, with 48 and 53 saves respectively.

===New York Yankees (1993)===
The Yankees were just games behind the Toronto Blue Jays when they acquired Smith. In eight appearances for the Yankees, Smith did not allow any runs and picked up three saves and 11 strikeouts in eight innings pitched. The team went 11–15 during September as Toronto won the division by seven games. Smith filed for free agency after the season.

===Baltimore Orioles (1994)===
Smith signed with the Baltimore Orioles for the 1994 season for $1.5 million plus incentives. At age 36, he had his most successful season; in his first 12 games, he had 12 saves and a 0.00 ERA. After nearly two months, his ERA was under 1.00 and it was still under 2.00 in mid-July. Smith was selected for the All-Star Game in 1991, 1992, and 1993, but had not played. The 1994 All-Star Game was his sixth selection, and he was brought into the game to hold a two-run American League lead in the ninth inning. Instead, he gave up a game-tying two-run home run to Fred McGriff, and the AL lost in 10 innings. Smith&#x27;s bad streak continued for the next several weeks until the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike ended the season. In the strike-shortened campaign, Smith recorded 33 saves with a 3.29 ERA and captured his third (and final) Rolaids Relief Man Award.

===California Angels (1995–1996)===
After filing for free agency again, Smith signed a two-year contract with the California Angels for over $2.5 million while the strike was still in progress. In 1995, Smith registered a save in every appearance from April 28 to June 25. On June 11, he saved his 16th consecutive game to break the major league record set by Doug Jones in 1988. He ran his streak to 19 games before losing a save game on June 28; Smith&#x27;s record was broken by John Wetteland, who saved 24 straight the next year. After keeping his ERA at 0.00 through the first two months of the season, Smith was selected to his seventh and final All-Star Game, thereby becoming the fourth player to be an All-Star for four different teams (after Walker Cooper, George Kell and Goose Gossage). Smith did not fare well for the next month, pushing his ERA up to 5.40. The Angels held a double-digit lead in the division and seemed poised for the postseason. However, the Angels went 14–29 in their final 43 games to finish in a tie with the Seattle Mariners atop the AL West, then lost the tie-breaker game to miss the playoffs. Despite the team&#x27;s difficulties, Smith pitched effectively during August and September, registering 13 saves against a single blown save. He finished the season with 37 saves and an ERA more than a run lower than the AL average (3.47 vs. 4.71).

Early in the 1996 season, Smith spent time on the disabled list following offseason surgery—he had torn a tendon in his right knee while on a hunting trip—and second-year pitcher Troy Percival established himself as the Angels&#x27; closer. Smith was briefly with the Lake Elsinore Storm on a rehabilitation assignment, his first time in the minor leagues since 1980. Upon his return to the Angels, Smith was unhappy with an inconsistent role, commenting, &quot;I could write a movie about the past few weeks... but it would have to be a cartoon.&quot; He pitched in a total of 11 games for the Angels during April and May, then was traded to the Cincinnati Reds.

===Cincinnati Reds (1996)===
Smith was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for reliever Chuck McElroy on May 27, 1996. Smith assumed setup duty for the Reds as closer Jeff Brantley was en route to a career-high 44 saves. In his return to the National League, Smith appeared in 43 games and registered two saves; his ERA with the Reds (4.06) was nearly as high as the league average (4.21), while for the full season he logged 6.7 strikeouts per nine innings pitched, the lowest to that point in his career. The Reds granted him free agency after the season.

===Montreal Expos (1997)===
Smith was picked up by the Montreal Expos for 1997 on a $400,000 contract. This was Smith&#x27;s final season of his career. His last game of the season, and his career, was two innings of extra-innings relief during an interleague rivalry game won by Toronto on July 2. After posting career-worsts in ERA (5.82), hits per nine innings (11.63) and several other statistics, Smith announced his retirement on July 15. Smith was formally released by the Expos on September 25, 1997.

===Post-playing career===
Despite his retirement announcement, the Kansas City Royals signed Smith as a free agent and invited him to spring training for 1998. In late March, he refused a minor-league assignment and left training camp. In early June, he signed a minor-league deal with the Houston Astros, appearing in two Double-A games with the Jackson Generals and 10 Triple-A games with the New Orleans Zephyrs. After posting an ERA near 7.00 in Triple-A, he was released at the end of June, and retired again. Over the course of his career in the major leagues, Smith appeared in 1,022 games, accruing a 7192 win–loss record to go along with his 478 saves. His career ERA was 3.03, and he struck out 1,251 batters.

==Post-retirement==
Two years after his retirement in 1998, Smith went to work as a roving minor league pitching instructor for the San Francisco Giants. Giants director of player personnel, former teammate Dick Tidrow, along with the manager of the Double-A Shreveport Captains, Jack Hiatt, offered the job to Smith, who gladly agreed, since it was in his hometown. Smith still held this job with the Giants as of 2009.

In the 2006 World Baseball Classic, Smith served as the pitching coach of the South Africa national baseball team, which was eliminated in pool play, finishing with an 0–3 record. In 2007, Smith was a coach in the European Baseball Academy for Major League Baseball International in Tirrenia, Italy. For the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Smith returned as a coach for South Africa; the team was again eliminated during pool play, losing both of their games.

Smith has three children from a previous marriage, Nikita, Lee Jr. and Dimitri. From his current marriage, he has additional twins, Alana and Nicholas.

==National Baseball Hall of Fame candidacy==
===Background===
In 1995, sportswriter Jim Murray selected Lee Smith as the active player most likely to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, describing him as &quot;the best one-inning pitcher the game ever saw&quot;, and &quot;the best at smuggling a game into the clubhouse in history.&quot;

Following Smith&#x27;s retirement, there was speculation on his chances of becoming a member of the Hall of Fame, while more generally &quot;debate continues to rage over how to properly value reliever contributions.&quot; At the time that Smith retired, only Hoyt Wilhelm and Rollie Fingers had been inducted to the Hall of Fame primarily for their relief pitching, in 1985 and 1992, respectively. During the time Smith appeared on Hall of Fame balloting (2003–2017), the Hall added relievers Dennis Eckersley (2004), Bruce Sutter (2006), and Goose Gossage (2008). Eckersley, Fingers, and Sutter each captured a Cy Young Award, with Eckersley and Fingers also winning MVP awards, while Smith fared no better than second in Cy Young Award voting and eighth in MVP voting (both coming in 1991). Smith pitched in a transitional era, when closers began to be expected to pitch only a single inning. Although Smith and Gossage each pitched in slightly over 1,000 games, Gossage ended his career with over 500 more innings pitched ( to ). Sutter was the first MLB pitcher elected to the Hall with fewer than 1,700 innings pitched; Smith, who pitched less than 100 innings each season after 1984 and did not exceed 75 innings in any season after 1990, ended his career with fewer than 1,300.

In 2005, statistician Alan Schwarz described Smith as a long shot for election despite the career record, and used Retrosheet data to compare the saves of several top relievers including Smith, Eckersley, Fingers, Gossage and Sutter. While Smith&#x27;s save percentage (82%), outs per save (3.72) and average of inherited runners per game (.50) compared well with Eckersley&#x27;s marks (84%, 3.33, .49), his figures in the last two categories sharply trailed those of the others; Fingers, Gossage and Sutter all averaged between 4.72 and 4.82 outs per save, with Sutter inheriting .67 runners per game and the other two .86, suggesting their saves were harder to achieve. Smith started his career earning multiple-inning saves, but the strategy in baseball for closers changed, and he was later used as a one-inning pitcher. He had a higher career save percentage than Fingers, Gossage and Sutter. Closers Trevor Hoffman and Mariano Rivera—elected to the Hall in 2018 and 2019, respectively—exceeded Smith&#x27;s former record of 478 saves, and the two are now widely considered the best ever one-inning closers.

In July 2006, at Sutter&#x27;s induction to the Hall, Smith talked with reporters about his chances for election, commenting that he was puzzled that he had not yet been selected: &quot;This confuses the hell out of me. But I&#x27;ve always been baffled by it.&quot;

===BBWAA balloting===
In annual balloting for the Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA), Smith received a high of 50.6% of votes cast, with 75% being the minimum for induction to the Hall. He appeared on the ballot from 2003 through 2017, never falling below 29.9% of the vote, with 5% being the minimum required each year to continue to appear on the ballot. He was removed from the ballot only when he reached the maximum of 15 appearances—he was the last player to appear on 15 BBWAA ballots, having been grandfathered after a 2014 change limited players to 10 years on the ballot.


===Election===
After not being elected by the BBWAA, Smith was later selected for consideration by the 16-member Today&#x27;s Game Committee as part of 2019 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting. On December 9, 2018, Smith and outfielder Harold Baines were elected, receiving 16 and 12 votes, respectively, to meet the 75% threshold for induction. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 21, 2019. Along with Smith and Baines, the Hall inducted BBWAA-electees Roy Halladay, Edgar Martínez, Mike Mussina, and Mariano Rivera. Smith acknowledged his hometown during his speech, saying, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just my arm that got me here. It&#x27;s the whole community of Castor. I thank you.&quot;

<doc id="808619" wikidata="Q4586623" url="?curid=808619" title="1990–91 United States network television schedule">
<text>The 1990–91 network television schedule for the four major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers primetime hours from September 1990 through August 1991. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1989–90 season.

Beginning this season, Fox started their prime time expansion starting with Thursdays and Fridays.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary.

New series are highlighted in bold.

All times are U.S. Eastern Time and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

==Legend==
==Sunday==
==Monday==

Note: On CBS, &quot;Face to Face with Connie Chung&quot; was to have aired 10-11 p.m., but it was replaced by &quot;The Trials of Rosie O&#x27;Neill&quot; at the last minute due to Connie Chung&#x27;s personal health commitments.

==Tuesday==
==Wednesday==
Note: Top Cops aired at 10:00 PM on CBS from July to October 1990. &quot;Police Squad!&quot; on CBS consisted of reruns of the 1982 ABC series.

==Thursday==

On CBS, &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; was supposed to premiere on October 25, 1990, while &quot;The Flash&quot; is supposed to start at 8:00-9:00 p.m., but the show was shelved.

<text>The following is a list of NGC objects, that is objects listed in the New General Catalogue (NGC). It is one of the largest comprehensive astronomical catalogues for deep sky objects such as star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies.
*List of NGC objects (1–1000)
*List of NGC objects (1001–2000)
*List of NGC objects (2001–3000)
*List of NGC objects (3001–4000)
*List of NGC objects (4001–5000)
*List of NGC objects (5001–6000)
*List of NGC objects (6001–7000)
*List of NGC objects (7001–7840)

== Stars ==

Some objects originally thought to be deep sky objects and listed in the NGC have been subsequently shown to be ordinary stars, so their inclusion in the catalog is now considered erroneous. This list of stars is based on the &quot;NGC 2000.0&quot; version of the catalog, which lists the stars in its errata, supplemented with data on each individual star from the VizieR database.
