<text>Mankombu Sambasivan Swaminathan (7 August 1925 – 28 September 2023) was an Indian geneticist and plant breeder, administrator and humanitarian. Swaminathan was a global leader of the green revolution. He has been called the main architect of the green revolution in India for his leadership and role in introducing and further developing high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice. 

Swaminathan&#x27;s collaborative scientific efforts with Norman Borlaug, spearheading a mass movement with farmers and other scientists and backed by public policies, saved India and Pakistan from certain famine-like conditions in the 1960s. His leadership as director general of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines was instrumental in his being awarded the first World Food Prize in 1987, recognized as one of the highest honours in the field of agriculture. The United Nations Environment Programme has called him &quot;the Father of Economic Ecology&quot;.
He was recently conferred the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of the Republic of India, in 2024.

Swaminathan contributed basic research related to potato, wheat, and rice, in areas such as cytogenetics, ionizing radiation, and radiosensitivity. He was a president of the Pugwash Conferences and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In 1999, he was one of three Indians, along with Gandhi and Tagore, on &quot;Time&quot; list of the 20 most influential Asian people of the 20th century. Swaminathan received numerous awards and honours, including the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award, the Ramon Magsaysay Award, and the Albert Einstein World Science Award. Swaminathan chaired the National Commission on Farmers in 2004, which recommended far-reaching ways to improve India&#x27;s farming system. He was the founder of an eponymous research foundation. He coined the term &quot;Evergreen Revolution&quot; in 1990 to describe his vision of &quot;productivity in perpetuity without associated ecological harm&quot;. He was nominated to the Parliament of India for one term between 2007 and 2013. During his tenure he put forward a bill for the recognition of women farmers in India.

== Life ==

=== Early life and education ===
Swaminathan was born in a Tamil family in Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency, on 7 August 1925. He was the second son of general surgeon M. K. Sambasivan and Parvati Thangammal Sambasivan. At age 11, after his father&#x27;s death, Swaminathan was looked after by his father&#x27;s brother. Swaminathan’s parents were second-generation descendants of migrants from Thanjavur, and were natives of Mankombu, Alappuzha, Kerala. This was the reason he was carrying Mankombu in his name.

Swaminathan was educated at a local high school and later at the Catholic Little Flower High School in Kumbakonam, from which he matriculated at age 15. From childhood, he interacted with farming and farmers; his extended family grew rice, mangoes, and coconut, and later expanded into other areas such as coffee. He saw the impact that fluctuations in the price of crops had on his family, including the devastation that weather and pests could cause to crops as well as incomes.

His parents wanted him to study medicine. With that in mind, he started off his higher education with zoology. But when he witnessed the impacts of the Bengal famine of 1943 during the Second World War and shortages of rice throughout the sub-continent, he decided to devote his life to ensuring India had enough food. Despite his family background, and belonging to an era where medicine and engineering were considered much more prestigious, he chose agriculture.

He went on to finish his undergraduate degree in zoology at Maharaja&#x27;s College in Trivandrum, Kerala (now known as University College, Thiruvananthapuram at the University of Kerala). He then studied at University of Madras (Madras Agricultural College, now the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University) from 1940 to 1944 and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Science. During this time he was also taught by Cotah Ramaswami, a professor of agronomy.

In 1947 he moved to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi to study genetics and plant breeding. He obtained a post-graduate degree with high distinction in cytogenetics in 1949. His research focused on the genus &quot;Solanum&quot;, with specific attention to the potato. Social pressures resulted in him competing in the examinations for civil services, through which he was selected to the Indian Police Service. At the same time, an opportunity for him arose in the agriculture field in the form of a UNESCO fellowship in genetics in the Netherlands. He chose genetics.

=== Netherlands and Europe ===
Swaminathan was a UNESCO fellow at the Wageningen Agricultural University&#x27;s Institute of Genetics in the Netherlands for eight months. The demand for potatoes during the Second World War resulted in deviations in age-old crop rotations. This caused golden nematode infestations in certain areas such as reclaimed agricultural lands. Swaminathan worked on adapting genes to provide resilience against such parasites, as well as cold weather. To this effect, the research succeeded. Ideologically the university influenced his later scientific pursuits in India with respect to food production. During this time he also made a visit to the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in war-torn Germany; this would later influence him deeply as during his next visit, a decade later, he saw that the Germans had transformed Germany, both infrastructurally and energetically.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 1950, he moved to study at the Plant Breeding Institute of the University of Cambridge School of Agriculture. He earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1952 for his thesis &quot;Species Differentiation, and the Nature of Polyploidy in certain species of the genus &quot;Solanum&quot; – section Tuberarium&quot;. The following December he stayed for a week with F.L. Brayne, a former Indian Civil Service officer, whose experiences with rural India influenced Swaminathan in his later years.

=== United States of America ===
Swaminathan then spent 15 months in the United States. He accepted a post-doctoral research associateship at the University of Wisconsin&#x27;s Laboratory of Genetics to help set up a USDA potato research station. The laboratory at the time had Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg on its faculty. His associateship ended in December 1953. Swaminathan turned down a faculty position in order to continue to make a difference back home in India.

=== India ===
Swaminathan returned to India in early 1954. There were no jobs in his specialisation and it was only three months later that he received an opportunity through a former professor to work temporarily as an assistant botanist at Central Rice Research Institute in Cuttack. At Cuttack, he was under an indica-japonica rice hybridisation program started by Krishnaswami Ramiah. This stint would go on to influence his future work with wheat. Half a year later he joined Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi in October 1954 as an assistant cytogeneticist. Swaminathan was critical of India importing food grains when seventy percent of India was dependent on agriculture. Further drought and famine-like situations were developing in the country.
Swaminathan and Norman Borlaug collaborated, with Borlaug touring India and sending supplies for a range of Mexican dwarf varieties of wheat, which were to be bred with Japanese varieties. Initial testing in an experimental plot showed good results. The crop was high-yield, good quality, and disease free. There was hesitation by farmers to adopt the new variety whose high yields were unnerving. In 1964, following repeated requests by Swaminathan to demonstrate the new variety, he was given funding to plant small demonstration plots. A total of 150 demonstration plots on 1 hectare were planted. The results were promising and the anxieties of the farmers were reduced. More modifications were made to the grain in the laboratory to better suit Indian conditions. The new wheat varieties were sown and in 1968 production went to 17 million tonnes, 5 million tonnes more than the last harvest.

Just before receiving his Nobel Prize in 1970, Norman Borlaug wrote to Swaminathan:

Notable contributions were made by Indian agronomists and geneticists such as Gurdev Khush and Dilbagh Singh Athwal. The Government of India declared India self-sufficient in food production in 1971. India and Swaminathan could now deal with other serious issues of access to food, hunger, and nutrition. He was with IARI between 1954 and 1972.

=== Administrator and educator ===
In 1972, Swaminathan was appointed as the director-general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and a secretary to the Government of India. In 1979, in a rare move for a scientist, he was made a principal secretary, a senior position in the Government of India. The next year he was shifted to the Planning Commission. As director-general of ICAR, he pushed for technical literacy, setting up centres all over India for this. Droughts during this period led him to form groups to watch weather and crop patterns, with the ultimate aim of protecting the poor from malnutrition. His shift to the Planning Commission for two years resulted in the introduction of women and environment with respect to development in India&#x27;s five year plans for the first time.

In 1982, he was made the first Asian director general of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. He was there until 1988. One of the contributions he made during his tenure here was conducting an international conference &quot;Women in Rice Farming Systems&quot;. For this, the United States–based Association for Women in Development gave Swaminathan their first award for &quot;outstanding contributions to the integration of women in development&quot;. As director general, he spread awareness among rice-growing families of making the value of each part of the rice crop. His leadership at IRRI was instrumental in the first World Food Prize being awarded to him. In 1984 he became the president and vice-president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and World Wildlife Fund respectively.

In 1987 he was awarded the first World Food Prize. The prize money was used to set up the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation. Accepting the award, Swaminathan spoke of the growing hunger despite the increase in food production. He spoke of the fear of sharing &quot;power and resources&quot;, and that the goal of a world without hunger remains unfinished. In their commendation letters, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, Frank Press, President Ronald Reagan, and others recognized his efforts.

Swaminathan would go on to chair the World Food Prize Selection Committee following Borlaug. In ICAR, from the late 1950s onwards, he taught cytogenetics, radiation genetics, and mutation breeding. Swaminathan mentored numerous Borlaug‐Ruan interns, part of the Borlaug‐Ruan International Internship.

=== Institution builder ===
Swaminathan established the Nuclear Research Laboratory at the IARI. He played a role in and promoting the setting up of the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in India; the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (now known as Bioversity International) in Italy and the International Council for Research in Agro-Forestry in Kenya. He helped to build and develop a number of institutions and provided research support in China, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran, and Cambodia.

===Later years===
Swaminathan co-chaired the United Nations Millennium Project on hunger from 2002 to 2005 and was head of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs between 2002 and 2007. In 2005 Bruce Alberts, President of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences said of Swaminathan: &quot;At 80, M.S. retains all the energy and idealism of his youth, and he continues to inspire good behaviour and more idealism from millions of his fellow human beings on this Earth. For that, we can all be thankful&quot;. Swaminathan had the aim of a hunger-free India by 2007.
Swaminathan was the chair of the National Commission on Farmers constituted in 2004. In 2007, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam nominated Swaminathan to the Rajya Sabha. Swaminathan introduced one bill during his tenure, The Women Farmers&#x27; Entitlements Bill 2011, which lapsed. One of the aims it proposed was recognising women farmers.

A term coined by Swaminathan, &#x27;Evergreen Revolution&#x27;, based on the enduring influence of the green revolution, aims to address the continuous increase in sustainable productivity that mankind requires. He has described it as &quot;productivity with perpetuity&quot;.

In his later years, he had also been part of initiatives related to bridging the digital divide, and bringing research to decision-makers in the field of hunger and nutrition.

=== Personal life and death===
He was married to Mina Swaminathan, whom he met in 1951 while they were both studying at Cambridge. They lived in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Their three daughters are Soumya Swaminathan (a paediatrician), Madhura Swaminathan (an economist), and Nitya Swaminathan (gender and rural development).

Gandhi and Ramana Maharshi influenced his life. Of the 2000 acres owned by their family, they donated one-third to Vinoba Bhave&#x27;s cause. In an interview in 2011, he said that when he was young, he followed Swami Vivekananda.

Swaminathan died at home in Chennai on 28 September 2023, at age 98.

== Scientific career ==

=== Potato ===
In the 1950s, Swaminathan&#x27;s explanation and analysis of the origin and evolutionary processes of potato was a major contribution. He elucidated its origin as an autotetraploid and its cell division behaviour. His findings related to polyploids were also significant. Swaminathan&#x27;s thesis in 1952 was based on his basic research related to &quot;species differentiation and the nature of polyploidy in certain species of the genus Solanum, section Tuberarium&quot;. The impact was the greater ability to transfer genes from a wild species to the cultivated potato.

What made his research on potatoes valuable was its real-world application in the development of new potato varieties. During his post-doctoral at Wisconsin University, he helped develop a frost-resistant potato. His genetic analysis of potatoes, including the genetic traits that govern yield and growth, important factors in increasing productivity, was pivotal. His multi-disciplinary systems approach perspective brought together many different genetic facets.

=== Wheat ===
In the 1950s and 1960s Swaminathan did basic research into the cytogenetics of hexaploid wheat. The varieties of wheat and rice developed by Swaminathan and Borlaug were foundational to the green revolution.

=== Rice ===
Efforts towards growing rice with C4 carbon fixation capabilities, which would allow a better photosynthesis and water usage, were started at IRRI under Swaminathan. Swaminathan also played a role in the development of the world&#x27;s first high-yielding basmati.

=== Radiation botany ===
The Genetics Division of the IARI under Swaminathan was globally renowned for its research on mutagens. He set up a &#x27;Cobalt-60 Gamma Garden&#x27; to study radiation mutation. Swaminathan&#x27;s association with Homi J. Bhabha, Vikram Sarabhai, Raja Ramana, M. R. Srinivasan and other Indian nuclear scientists allowed agricultural scientists to access facilities at the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (which would later become the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre). Swaminathan&#x27;s first PhD student, A. T. Natarajan, would go on to write his thesis in this direction. One of the aims of such research was to increase plant responsiveness to fertilisers and demonstrate real-world application of crop mutations. Swaminathan&#x27;s early basic research on the effects of radiation on cells and organisms partly formed the base of future redox biology.

 calls Swaminathan&#x27;s paper on neutron radiation in agriculture in 1966 presented at an International Atomic Energy Agency conference in the United States as &quot;epoch-making&quot;. The work of Swaminathan and his colleagues was relevant to food irradiation.

== Public recognition ==
=== Awards and honours ===
Swaminathan received the Mendel Memorial Medal from the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1965. Following this he received numerous international awards and honours, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award (1971), the Albert Einstein World Science Award (1986), the first World Food Prize (1987), the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement (1991), the Four Freedoms Award (2000), and the Planet and Humanity Medal of the International Geographical Union (2000). When accepting the Ramon Magsaysay Award, Swaminathan quoted Seneca: &quot;A hungry person listens neither to reason, nor to religion, nor is bent by any prayer.&quot;

He was conferred with the Order of the Golden Heart of the Philippines, the Order of Agricultural Merit of France, the Order of the Golden Ark of Netherlands, and the Royal Order of Sahametrei of Cambodia. China awarded him with the &quot;Award for International Co-operation on Environment and Development&quot;. In the &#x27;Dr Norman E. Borlaug Hall of Laureates&#x27; at Des Moines, Iowa, United States, there is an artwork of Swaminathan made up of 250,000 pieces of glass. The IRRI has named a building and a scholarship fund after him.

One of the first national awards he received was the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in 1961. Following this he was conferred Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Vibhushan awards, as well as the H K Firodia award, the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award, and the Indira Gandhi Prize. As of 2016, he had received 33 national and 32 international awards. In 2004, an agricultural think-tank in India named an annual award after Swaminathan, the eponymously named &#x27;Dr. M.S. Swaminathan Award for Leadership in Agriculture&#x27;.

On 9 February 2024, he was conferred the Bharat Ratna posthumously, the highest civilian award of the Republic of India. On that occasion, then PM of India, Narendra Modi wrote:
=== Honorary doctorates and fellowships ===

Swaminathan was the recipient of 84 honorary doctorates and was a guide for numerous Ph.D. scholars. Sardar Patel University conferred him with an honorary degree in 1970; Delhi University, Banaras Hindu University and others would follow. Internationally, Technische Universität Berlin (1981) and the Asian Institute of Technology (1985) honoured him. The University of Wisconsin honoured Swaminathan with an honorary doctorate in 1983. When the University of Massachusetts, Boston, honoured him with a science doctorate, they commented on the &quot;magnificent inclusiveness of [Swaminathan&#x27;s] concerns, by nation, socioeconomic group, gender, inter-generational, and including both human and natural environments&quot;. Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, from where he received his PhD in botany, made him an honorary fellow in 2014.

Swaminathan had been elected a fellow of a number of science academies in India. Internationally he had been recognised as a fellow by 30 academies of science and societies across the world including the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Sweden, Italy, China, Bangladesh, as well as the European Academy of Arts, Science and Humanities. He was a founder fellow of The World Academy of Sciences. The National Agrarian University in Peru conferred him with an honorary professorship.

==Publications==

Swaminathan published 46 single-author papers between 1950 and 1980. In total he had 254 papers to his credit, 155 of which he was the single or first author. His scientific papers are in the fields of crop improvement (95), cytogenetics and genetics (87) and phylogenetics (72). His most frequent publishers were &quot;Indian Journal of Genetics&quot; (46), &quot;Current Science&quot; (36), &quot;Nature&quot; (12) and &quot;Radiation Botany&quot; (12). Selected publications include:
*

===Controversies===
In the 1970s, a scientific paper in which Swaminathan and his team claimed to have produced a mutant breed of wheat by gamma irradiation of a Mexican variety (Sonora 64) resulting in &quot;Sharbati Sonora,&quot; claimed to have a very high lysine content, led to a major controversy. The case was claimed to be an error made by the laboratory assistant. The episode was also compounded by the suicide of an agricultural scientist. It has been studied as part of a systemic problem in Indian agriculture research.

A paper published in the 25 November 2018 edition of &quot;Current Science&quot; titled &#x27;Modern Technologies for Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security&#x27; listed Swaminathan as a co-author. The article was criticised by a number of scientific experts, including K. VijayRaghavan, the principal scientific adviser to the Government of India, who commented that it was &quot;deeply flawed and full of errors&quot;. Swaminathan claimed that his role in the paper was &quot;extremely limited&quot; and that he shouldn&#x27;t have been named as the co-author.

<doc id="841441" wikidata="Q1758584" url="?curid=841441" title="Psychonautics">
<text>Psychonautics (from the Ancient Greek &#x27; &#x27;soul, spirit, mind&#x27; and&#x27; &#x27;sailor, navigator&#x27;) refers both to a methodology for describing and explaining the subjective effects of altered states of consciousness, including those induced by meditation or mind-altering substances, and to a research group in which the researcher voluntarily immerses themselves into an altered mental state in order to explore the accompanying experiences. 

The term has been applied diversely, to cover all activities by which altered states are induced and utilized for spiritual purposes or the exploration of the human condition, including shamanism, lamas of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Siddhars of Ancient India, sensory deprivation, and archaic/modern drug users who use entheogenic substances in order to gain deeper insights and spiritual experiences. Self-experimentation of psychedelics in groups may foster innovation of alternative medication treatment. A person who uses altered states for such exploration is known as a &quot;&quot;.

==Etymology and categorization==
The term &quot;psychonautics&quot; derives from the prior term &quot;psychonaut&quot;, which began appearing in North American works in the late 1950s. The first reference that corresponds to contemporary usages of the term was in the 1965 edition of the &quot;Group Psychotherapy&quot; journal. A 1968 magazine, &quot;Beyond Baroque&quot;, refers to Timothy Leary as a psychonaut. 

German author Ernst Jünger describes ideas related to psychonautics - in reference to Arthur Heffter - in his 1970 essay on his own extensive drug experiences &quot;Annäherungen: Drogen und Rausch&quot; (literally: &quot;Approaches: Drugs and Inebriation&quot;). In this essay, Jünger draws many parallels between drug experience and physical exploration—for example, the danger of encountering hidden &quot;reefs.&quot;

Peter J. Carroll made &quot;Psychonaut&quot; the title of a 1982 book on the experimental use of meditation, ritual and drugs in the experimental exploration of consciousness and of psychic phenomena, or &quot;chaos magic&quot;.

The term&#x27;s first published use in a scholarly context is attributed to ethnobotanist Jonathan Ott, in 2001.

===Definition and usage===
Clinical psychiatrist Jan Dirk Blom describes psychonautics as denoting &quot;the exploration of the psyche by means of techniques such as lucid dreaming, brainwave entrainment, sensory deprivation, and the use of hallucinogens or entheogens, and a psychonaut as one who &quot;seeks to investigate their mind using intentionally induced altered states of consciousness&quot; for spiritual, scientific, or research purposes.

Psychologist Dr. Elliot Cohen of Leeds Beckett University and the UK Institute of Psychosomanautics defines psychonautics as &quot;the means to study and explore consciousness (including the unconscious) and altered states of consciousness; it rests on the realization that to study consciousness is to transform it.&quot; He associates it with a long tradition of historical cultures worldwide. Leeds Beckett University offers a module in Psychonautics and may be the only university in the UK to do so.

American Buddhist writer Robert Thurman depicts the Tibetan Buddhist master as a psychonaut, stating that &quot;Tibetan lamas could be called psychonauts, since they journey across the frontiers of death into the in-between realm.&quot;

===Categorization===
The aims and methods of psychonautics, when state-altering substances are involved, is commonly distinguished from recreational drug use by research sources. Psychonautics as a means of exploration need not involve drugs, and may take place in a spiritual context with an established history. Cohen considers psychonautics closer in its association to wisdom traditions and other transpersonal and integral movements.

However, there is considerable overlap with modern drug use and due to its modern close association with psychedelics and other drugs, it is also studied in the context of drug abuse from a perspective of addiction, the drug abuse market and online psychology, and studies into existing and emerging drugs within toxicology.

==Methods==

* Hallucinogens, oneirogens, and especially psychedelics such as peyote, psilocybin mushrooms, LSD and DMT, but also dissociatives and &quot;atypical&quot; psychedelics such as ketamine, dextromethorphan, &quot;Tabernanthe iboga&quot;, &quot;Amanita muscaria,&quot; &quot;Salvia divinorum,&quot; MDMA, and Cannabis
* Icaros, which are the songs (i.e. something verbal that is ordinarily perceived as an auditory sensation) the Ayahuasceros sing to induce pictorial representations, rich tapestries of colors and patterns that are visually seen by the listener. (See: synesthesia) The ayahuasca ingredient, harmine, was once known as telepathine because of this group-facilitated activity of singing icaros and the shared perception it cultivates. A shaman who is one of the Ayahuascero people is expected to memorize as many icaros as they can.
* Disruption of psychological and physiological processes required for usual mental states - sleep deprivation, fasting, sensory deprivation, oxygen deprivation/smoke inhalation, holotropic breathwork
* Ritual, both as a means of inducing an altered state, and also for practical purposes of and of obtaining suitable focus and intention
* Dreaming, in particular lucid dreaming in which the person retains a degree of volition and awareness, and dream journals
* Hypnosis
* Meditation
* Meditative or trance inducing dance, like Sufi whirling can also be used to induce altered state of consciousness
* Prayer
* Biofeedback and other devices that change neural activity in the brain (brainwave entrainment) by means of light, sound, or electrical impulses, including: mind machines, dreamachines, binaural beats, and cranial electrotherapy stimulation
* Guided Imagery and Music (GIM) refers to all forms of music-imaging in an expanded state of consciousness, including not only the specific individual and group forms that music therapist and researcher Helen Bonny developed, but also all variations and modifications in those forms created by her followers.

These may be used in combination; for example, traditions such as shamanism may combine ritual, fasting, and hallucinogenic substances.

==Works and notable figures==
Works such as Confessions of an English Opium-Eater by Thomas De Quincey, The Hasheesh Eater by Fitz Hugh Ludlow, and &quot;On Hashish&quot; by Walter Benjamin have psychonautic elements insofar as they explore human and drug-induced experiences. They may be considered precursors to psychonautic literature, but they are not psychonautic works in their own right.

One of the best known psychonautic works is Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;, which recounts his experience after taking 400mg of mescaline. The American physician, neuroscientist, psychoanalyst, philosopher, writer and inventor John C. Lilly was a well-known psychonaut. Lilly was interested in the nature of consciousness and, amongst other techniques, he used isolation tanks in his research. 

Ken Kesey is an author well-known for accounts of his experimentation with psychedelic drugs. Philosophical- and Science-fiction author Philip K. Dick has also been described as a psychonaut for several of his works such as &quot;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch&quot;.

Another influential figure is the psychologist and writer Timothy Leary. Leary is known for controversial talks and research on the subject; he wrote several books including &quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot;. Another widely known name is that of American philosopher, ethnobotanist, lecturer, and author Terence McKenna. McKenna spoke and wrote about subjects including psychedelic drugs, plant-based entheogens, shamanism, metaphysics, alchemy, language, culture, technology, and the theoretical origins of human consciousness.

Among the most influential figures are undoubtedly Alexander Shulgin and Ann Shulgin who together authored PiHKAL and TiHKAL, a pair of books which contain fictionalized autobiographies and detailed notes on over 230 psychoactive compounds. Some present-day psychonauts refer to themselves as &quot;Shulginists&quot; to denote a belief in the principles they identify in Shulgins&#x27; work.

<doc id="841448" wikidata="Q1936356" url="?curid=841448" title="Hantaro Nagaoka">
<text>was a Japanese physicist and a pioneer of Japanese physics during the Meiji period.

== Life ==

Nagaoka was born in Nagasaki, Japan on August 19, 1865 and educated at the University of Tokyo. After graduating with a degree in physics in 1887, Nagaoka worked with a visiting Scottish physicist, Cargill Gilston Knott, on early problems in magnetism, namely magnetostriction in liquid nickel. In 1893, Nagaoka traveled to Europe, where he continued his education at the universities of Berlin, Munich, and Vienna, including courses on Saturn&#x27;s rings and a course with Ludwig Boltzmann on his Kinetic Theory of Gases, two influences which would be reflected in Nagaoka&#x27;s later work. Nagaoka also attended, in 1900, the First International Congress of Physicists in Paris, where he heard Marie Curie lecture on radioactivity, an event that aroused Nagaoka&#x27;s interest in atomic physics. Nagaoka returned to Japan in 1901 and served as professor of physics at Tokyo University until 1925. After his retirement from Tokyo University, Nagaoka was appointed a head scientist at RIKEN, and also served as the first president of Osaka University, from 1931 to 1934.

His granddaughter was pianist Nagaoka Nobuko.

==Saturnian model of the atom==

By 1900 physicists had begun to consider new models for the structure of the atom. The recent discovery by J. J. Thomson of the negatively charged electron implied that a neutral atom must also contain an opposite positive charge. In 1904, Thomson suggested that the atom was a sphere of uniform positive electrification, with electrons scattered through it like plums in a pudding, giving rise to the term plum pudding model.

Nagaoka rejected Thomson&#x27;s model on the grounds that opposite charges are impenetrable. In 1904, Nagaoka proposed an alternative planetary model of the atom in which a positively charged center is surrounded by a number of revolving electrons, in the manner of Saturn and its rings.

Nagaoka&#x27;s model featured:
* a very massive atomic center (in analogy to a very massive planet)
* thousands of electrons revolving around the nucleus, bound by electrostatic forces (in analogy to the rings revolving around Saturn, bound by gravitational forces).
For his model to be stable, Nagaoka showed that the central charge had to be 10,000 times the charge on the electron.

Based on his model, Nagaoka suggested that radioactive beta decay resulted from instability in the electron orbits. However this explanation did not account for important aspects of radioactivity such as its random nature and the high energy of alpha particle emission. He also suggested that the model would explain atomic spectra and chemical properties. 

Ernest Rutherford mentions Nagaoka&#x27;s model in his 1911 paper in which the atomic nucleus is proposed. However Nagaoka&#x27;s work probably did not influence Rutherford&#x27;s proposal.

Nagaoka&#x27;s model was widely discussed by prominent scientists of the day, but a detailed study by George Schott showed the model could not correctly predict atomic spectra.
Nagaoka himself abandoned his proposed model in 1908.
Rutherford and Niels Bohr would present the more viable Bohr model in 1913.

==Other works==

Nagaoka later did research in spectroscopy and other fields. In 1909, he published a paper on the inductance of solenoids. In 1924, he achieved the first successful synthesis of gold, produced from mercury by neutron bombardment. In 1929, Nagaoka became the first person to describe meteor burst communications.

Nagoka also did early research on earthquakes, from the 1900s to the 1920s, building upon works published Europe; &quot;One used the principle of elasticity studies against the background of the current that succeeded in France in the first half of the 19th century. The other defined potential functions and explained phenomena from continuous equations of the nature of waves against the background of new currents that emerged in Britain or Germany from the mid-19th century onwards.&quot;

==Awards and recognition==

*For his lifetime of scientific work, Nagaoka was granted the Order of Culture by the Japanese government in 1937.
*The Nagaoka crater on the Moon is named after him.

<text>John Gayle (September 11, 1792 – July 21, 1859) was the 7th Governor of Alabama, a United States representative from Alabama, a justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama and a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama.

==Education and career==

Born on September 11, 1792, in Sumter County, South Carolina, Gayle pursued classical studies and graduated from South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) in 1813 and read law in 1818. He was President of the Clariosophic Society while at South Carolina College. He was admitted to the bar and entered private practice in St. Stephens, Alabama Territory (State of Alabama from December 14, 1819) starting in 1818. He was a member of the Legislative Council for Alabama Territory from 1818 to 1819. He was a solicitor for the First Judicial Circuit of Alabama from 1819 to 1821. He was a member of the Alabama House of Representatives from 1822 to 1823, and again from 1829 to 1830, serving as Speaker in 1829. He was a Judge of the Alabama Circuit Court for the Third Judicial Circuit from 1823 to 1825. He resumed private practice in Greene County, Alabama from 1826 to 1828. He was a justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama from 1828 to 1829. He was Governor of Alabama from 1831 to 1835. He again resumed private practice in Mobile, Alabama from 1835 to 1846. Gayle was mentioned in &quot;American Slavery As It Is&quot;, an abolitionist book published in 1839. He is given as an example of slavers who disregard marriages of enslaved African Americans. The book reprints a signed advertisement Gayle had placed in a newspaper seeking help capturing an escaped man and suggesting the fugitive could be heading to a neighboring county where the enslaved man&#x27;s wife lived.

===Notable state court case===

During his service as a judge, Gayle presided over the Petition for Freedom of Cornelius Sinclair, a young African American child who had been kidnapped and sold into slavery in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

===Notable achievements as Governor===

During Gayle&#x27;s term as Governor of Alabama, the state bank was expanded, and the first railroad was completed in Alabama. The Bell Factory, the state&#x27;s first textile mill, was incorporated in Madison County.

==Congressional service==

Gayle was elected as a Whig from Alabama&#x27;s 1st congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 30th United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1847, to March 3, 1849. He was Chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims for the 30th United States Congress.

==Federal judicial service==

Gayle was nominated by President Zachary Taylor on March 12, 1849, to a joint seat on the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama vacated by Judge William Crawford. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 13, 1849, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on July 21, 1859, due to his death in Jacksonville, Alabama. He was interred in Magnolia Cemetery in Mobile.

==Family==

Gayle was married to Sarah Ann Haynsworth, formerly a resident of South Carolina, from June 11, 1819, until she died in 1835, due to lockjaw (tetanus). They had six children. In 1837, Gayle married Clarissa Stedman Peck at Gaston, Alabama. They had four children. Gayle died of ill health and natural causes on July 21, 1859, aged 66.

During his time on Alabama Supreme Court (1828–29), John Gayle constructed his family home in Greensboro, Alabama, then a part of Greene County, now part of Hale County. There Sarah gave birth to Amelia Gayle Gorgas. She was the wife of Gen. Josiah Gorgas, Chief of Ordnance of the Confederate States of America, mother of William Crawford Gorgas, 22nd United States Surgeon General who freed the Panama Canal Zone of yellow fever.

<doc id="841452" wikidata="Q311485" url="?curid=841452" title="Pherecydes of Syros">
<text>Pherecydes of Syros (; ; fl. 6th century BCE) was an Ancient Greek mythographer and proto-philosopher from the island of Syros. Little is known about his life and death. Some ancient testimonies counted Pherecydes among the Seven Sages of Greece, although he is generally believed to have lived in the generation after them. Others claim he may have been a teacher of Pythagoras, a student of Pittacus, or a well-traveled autodidact who had studied secret Phoenician books. 

Pherecydes wrote a book on cosmogony, known as the &quot;Pentemychos&quot; or &quot;Heptamychos&quot;. He was considered the first writer to communicate philosophical ideas in prose as opposed to verse. However, other than a few short fragments preserved in quotations from other ancient philosophers and a long fragment discovered on an Egyptian papyrus, his work is lost. However, it survived into the Hellenistic period and a significant amount of its content can be conjectured indirectly through ancient testimonies. His cosmogony was derived from three divine principles: &quot;Zas&quot; (Life), &quot;Cthonie&quot; (Earth), and &quot;Chronos&quot; (Time). In the narrative, Chronos creates the Classical elements and other gods in cavities within the earth. Later, Zas defeats the dragon Ophion in a battle for supremacy and throws him in Oceanus. Zas marries Chthoniê, who then becomes the recognizable Earth (Gê) with forests and mountains. Chronos retires from the world as creator, and Zas succeeds him as ruler and assigns all beings their place. 

Pherecydes&#x27; cosmogony forms a bridge between the mythological thought of Hesiod and pre-Socratic Greek philosophy; Aristotle considered him one of the earliest thinkers to abandon traditional mythology in order to arrive at a systematic explanation of the world, although Plutarch, as well as many other writers, still gave him the title of &quot;theologus,&quot; as opposed to the later &quot;physiologoi&quot; of the Ionian school. Later hellenistic doxographers also considered him as one of the first thinkers to introduce a doctrine of the transmigration of souls to the Ancient Greek religion, which influenced the metempsychosis of Pythagoreanism, and the theogonies of Orphism. Various legends and miracles were ascribed to him, many of which tie him to the development of Pythagoreanism or Orphism.

== Life ==
Although it is relatively certain the Pherecydes was a native of the island of Syros, and that he lived in the 6th century BCE, almost nothing else is known about his life. There is even some discrepancy in the ancient sources of his life as to when exactly he lived within the 6th century. The Suda places his date of birth during the reign of King Alyattes in Lydia (c. 605-560 BCE), which would place him as a contemporary of the Seven Sages of Greece, among whose number he was occasionally included. Alternatively, Apollodorus, places his floruit several decades later, in the 59th Olympiad (544–541 BCE), a generation later. Assuming that Pherecydes was born in this later generation, younger than the philosopher Thales (624-545 BC) and thus an older contemporary of Anaximander, he would also be approximately the correct age for the Pythagorean tradition in which he is regarded as a teacher of Pythagoras. Most of the other biographical information is probably fiction, and the ambiguity and contradictions in the surviving testimonies suggest that any reliable biographical data that may have existed was no longer available in the Hellenistic period. The identity of Pherecydes was also unclear in ancient times because there were two authors of that name who both wrote about mythology: Pherecydes of Syros and Pherecydes of Athens (fl. 5th century BC). 

According to a forged letter attributed to Thales, Pherecydes never traveled but according to other sources he traveled throughout the Greek cultural area, to Delphi, the Peloponnese, Ephesus and Samos. According to Josephus and Byzantine writers, Pherecydes also made a journey to Egypt. Such a journey, however, is a common tale that is also part of other biographies of philosophers. A sun-dial (&quot;heliotropion&quot;), supposedly made by Pherecydes, was said by Diogenes Laërtius to be &quot;preserved on the island of Syros.&quot; Several miraculous deeds were also attributed to Pherecydes; such as that he accurately predicted an earthquake on Syros after drinking from a well, or that he predicted the sinking of a ship that he saw along the coast of Syros, which then proceeded to sink. In Messene he allegedly warned his friend Perilaus that the city would be conquered. Finally, Hercules was said to have visited him in a dream and told him to tell the Spartans not to value silver or gold, and that same night Heracles is said to have told the king of Sparta in his sleep to listen to Pherecydes. Many of those miracles however, were also attributed to other legendary philosophers such as Pythagoras or Epimenides. 

There are many conflicting legends that purport to be an account of the death of Pherecydes. According to one story, Pherecydes was killed and skinned as a sacrifice by the Spartans, and their king kept the skin out of respect for Pherecydes&#x27; wisdom. However, the same story was also told about Epimenides. Other accounts have the philosopher perishing in a battle between the Ephesians and Magnesians, or throwing himself from Mount Corycus in Delphi, or succumbing to typhoid fever. According to Aelianus typhoid fever was a punishment for his wickedness . The latter story was already known to Aristotle and may have arisen from the idea that wise men did not care about physical care. Other stories connect Pherecydes&#x27; death to Pythagoras. However, the historicity of all this is debatable.

=== Influences ===
Pherecydes was designated as &#x27;wise&#x27; (&quot;sophos&quot;), but only Servius calls him a philosopher (&quot;philosophus&quot;). Aristotle places him between theologians and philosophers, because he no longer expressed himself completely mythical in his research. No consistent teacher of Pherecydes was known by name in late antiquity; according to the doxographer Diogenes Laërtius Pherecydes was taught by Pittacus, but according to the &quot;Suda&quot; he taught himself after he got his hands on &#x27;the secret books of the Phoenicians&#x27;. 

Although this latter claim is almost certainly fictitious, it may be based on the similarity between Pherecydes&#x27; ideas and Eastern religious motifs. For example, in his book he describes an important battle in the earliest times between Kronos and Ophion, and this motif occurs in the Middle East. His father was named Babys, a name that presumably originated from southern Anatolia, based on linguistic evidence. Eternal time as god is also Middle Eastern. In addition, Pherecydes has been associated with Zoroastrianism. Isidore the Gnostic claimed that Pherecydes based his allegorical work on a &#x27;prophecy of Ham&#x27;. Ham, as referred to here, may be Zoroaster, who was quite well known in the Greek world of late antiquity. Isidore may have concluded this because the Zoroastrian literature available to him was influenced by Hellenization, or because Pherecydes&#x27; work influenced it. There is also a short fragment in which Pherecydes talks about ambrosia of the moon, the potion of the gods. This representation has parallels in the Samaveda, where there the moon is a vessel from which the gods drink soma (god drink) and is important in the reincarnation theory as guardian of heaven.

=== Writings ===
Pherecydes wrote a cosmogony (explanatory model for the origin of the universe) that contained a theogony, an explanatory model for the gods and their properties. This work broke with the mythological and theological tradition and shows Eastern influences. Pherecydes, along with Anaximander and Anaximenes, has long been regarded as one of the first Greek writers to compose his work in prose rather than hexameter verse. Martin Litchfield West notes that the subject matter that all of three of these authors wrote on, the nature of the universe and how it came to be, had been written in verse prior to these authors. West speculates based on the word choice that early logographers used (&quot;words I have heard&quot; instead of &quot;I have read&quot;) that the original intent of a book written in prose was essentially a &quot;write-up&quot; of a lecture that a person interest in topics such as cosmology gave as a speech or public discourse. The book was known variously under the titles such as &quot;Seven niches&quot; (&quot; Heptamychos&quot;, Ἑπτάμυχος), &quot;Five niches&quot; (Pentemychos, Πεντέμυχος), and &quot;Mixing of the Gods&quot; (&quot;Theokrasia&quot;, Θεοκρασία).

In this work, Pherecydes taught his philosophy through the medium of mythic representations. Although it is lost, it was extant in the Hellenistic period, and the fragments and testimony that survive from works that describe it are enough to reconstruct a basic outline. The opening sentence is given by Diogenes Laertius, and two fragments in the middle of the text have also been preserved in fragments from a 3rd century Egyptian papyrus discovered by Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt, which was identified thanks to a comment by Clement of Alexandria about the contents of Pherecydes&#x27; book: &#x27;Pherecydes of Syros says: &quot;Zas made a great and beautiful robe, and made the earth and Ogenus on it, and the palace of Ogenus&quot;.&#x27;

==Theogony==
Pherecydes developed a unique, syncretistic theogony with a new beginning stage, in which Zas, Chronos, and Chthoniê were the first gods to exist all along. He was probably the first to do this. There is no creation out of nothing (&quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot;). The cosmogony is justified through etymology, a new understanding of the deity Kronos as Chronos and the insertion of a creator god (demiurge). Also, Pherecydes combined Greek mythology with non-Greek myths and religions. According to Aristotle, he was innovative in his approach, because he broke with the theological tradition and combined mythology with philosophy. Pherecydes&#x27; creation story therefore had to be more rational and concrete than Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;. He wrote that first Chaos came to be (&quot;genetos&quot;) without explanation, while Zas, Chronos and Chthoniê existed eternally (&quot;êsan aeí&quot;). The adoption of an eternal principle (&quot;arche&quot;) for the cosmos was characteristic of Pre-Socratic thinkers.

The sequence of Pherecydes&#x27; creation myth is as follows. First, there are the eternal gods Zas (Zeus), Chthoniê (Gaia) and Chronos (Kronos). Then Chronos creates elements in niches in the earth with his seed, from which other gods arise. This is followed by the three-day wedding of Zas and Chthonie. On the third day Zas makes the robe of the world, which he hangs from a winged oak and then presents as a wedding gift to Chthonie, and wraps around her. The &quot;winged oak&quot; in this cosmology has no precedent in Greek tradition. The stories are different but not mutually exclusive, because much is lacking in the fragments, but it seems clear that creation is hindered by chaotic forces. Before the world is ordered, a cosmic battle takes place, with Cronus as the head of one side and Ophion as the leader of the other. Ophion then attacks Kronos, who defeats him and throws him in Ogenos. Sometime after his battle with Ophion, Kronos is succeeded by Zas. This is implied by the fact that Zas/Zeus is ultimately the one who assigns the gods their domain in the world. For example, the Harpies are assigned to guard Tartarus The fact that Kronos disappears into the background is due to his great magnificence. The argument for this is that Aristotle conceives Pherecydes as a semi-philosopher in that he connects the philosophical Good and Beautiful with the first, prevailing principle (&quot;arche&quot;) of the theologians, and eternity, according to Aristotle, is connected with the good. The three primordial gods are eternal, equal and wholly responsible for the world order.

===Etymology===
Pherecydes was interested in etymology and word associations. Like Thales, he associated chaos with the primordial elemental water, presumably because he associates the word &#x27;chaos&#x27; with the verb &#x27;cheesthai&#x27;, &#x27;to flow out&#x27;, and because chaos is an undefined, disorderly state. By that approach he adapted god names, although Pherecydes probably saw his gods as traditional deities. He mentioned Rhea for example Rhê, presumably by association with &quot;rhein&quot; &#x27;(out)streams&#x27;. The common names were in the 6th century BC. already traditional. In addition, the names are not a Greek dialect. The reason for deviant forms is to make them resemble other words and to construct an original form.

*Zas resembles &quot;Zeus&quot;. One explanation is association with the prefix &quot;za&quot;- &#x27;very&#x27;, as in &quot;zatheos&quot; &#x27;very divine&#x27;. An alternative is that the Sky deity is thus connected with the Earth Goddess &quot;Gê&quot;. Namely, the Cypriot form is &quot;Zã&quot;. A third interpretation is based on the genitive form &quot;Zantos&quot;. Pherecydes&#x27; father Babys came from Cilicia, where the Luwian god Šanta was known as Sandes and Sandon. The Hittites identified it as the sky god, and the Greeks as Zeus or Heracles. Based on Zeus and Sandon with their associations, Pherecydes constructed a basic form with &quot;Zas&quot;-&quot;Zantos&quot;. Zas (Zeus) is comparable with the Orphic Eros in function, as a personification of masculine sexual creativity. According to Proclus, &quot;Pherecydes used to say that Zeus changed into Eros when about to create, for the reason that, having created the world from opposites, he led it into agreement and peace and sowed sameness in all things, and unity that interpenetrates the universe&quot;.

*Chronos as time, the creator god, was unusual and is probably Eastern in origin. Phoenician myths and Zoroastrianism have a deified Time (Zurvan) that also creates without a partner with its seed, but leaves the concrete design of the physical world to another god. The semen (seeds) of Chronos which can probably be considered as a &quot;watery chaos&quot; was placed in the recesses and composed numerous other offspring of gods. This is described in a fragment preserved in Damascius&#x27; &quot;On First Principles&quot;. In later Greek poetry, Chronos (also called Aiōn) appears as personification. Some Pherecydes fragments say &quot;Kronos&quot;, not &quot;Chronos&quot;. The association between the two figures is not traditional but may be correct. According to Hermias and Probus, Pherecydes did connect Chronos with Kronos, perhaps on etymological grounds. After him Pindar and Hellenistic orphism did this too. 

*Chthoniê comes from &quot;chthôn&quot; &#x27;earth&#x27; and &quot;chthonios&quot; &#x27;in/under the earth&#x27;. It concerns the invisible part of the dark, primitive earth mass. &quot;Gê&quot;, on the other hand, refers to the visible, differentiated Earth&#x27;s surface. Chthoniê&#x27;s role is related to myths about Cybele in western Anatolia. Herodotus uses &quot;chthoniai theai&quot; as a name for Demeter (mother earth) and her daughter Persephone. Pherecydes probably regarded Chthoniê as &#x27;mother of the gods&#x27;. Hesiod described Tartaros as being &quot;in a recess (&quot;muchos&quot;) of broad-wayed earth&quot;. Hermann S. Schibli thinks the five &quot;muchoi&quot; were actually harboured within Chthonie, or at least were so initially when Chronos disposed his seed in the five &quot;nooks&quot;. A close relationship is thought to exist between these recesses and Chthonie.

*Ogenos, Okeanos/Oceanus. This non-Greek name is explained by the Akkadian &quot;uginna&quot;(circle) because Oceanus encircles the earth, or with the Aramaic &quot;ôganâ&quot; &#x27;basin&#x27; or &quot;ôgen&quot; &#x27;edge/band/edging&#x27;. This Eastern influence has been suggested by assuming that Pherecydes knew of a world map such as the Babylonian world map. Finally, the non-traditional Greek &quot;abodes of Ogenos&quot; (&quot;Ogenou dómata&quot;) are parts of the earth covering Chthoniê, and resemble the regions beyond the ocean on the Babylonian map.
===Cosmogony===
The sequence of Pherecydes&#x27; cosmogony begins with the eternal gods Zas (Zeus), Chthoniê (Gê) and Chronos (Kronos), who &quot;always existed.&quot; The first creation is an act of ordering in the cosmos through niches and division of the world. That creation coincides with the dichotomy of eternity-temporality and being-becoming. Chronos must step out of eternity to create, and creation means becoming. Later on Plato also used the distinction between eternal being and temporal genesis. This is opposed to the older cosmogony of Hesiod (8th–7th century BCE) where the initial state of the universe is Chaos, a dark void considered as a divine primordial condition and the creation is &quot;ex nihilo&quot; (out of nothing).

The titles &quot;Penta&quot;-/&quot;Heptamychos&quot; and &quot;Theokrasia&quot; of the work indicate that niches (&quot;mychoi&quot;) and mixing are an important part of the creation story. Pherecydes first identified five niches (&quot;mychoi&quot;). If there were five niches in the story, they correspond to the five parts (&quot; moirai&quot;) of the cosmos: the sea, underworld and heaven (the homeric three-part division), plus the earth and Mount Olympus. Therefore Damascius calls the five niches &#x27;five worlds&#x27; and the &quot;Suda&quot; mentions the alternative title &quot;Pentamychos&quot;. Once Chronos fills them to create the worlds, they turn into the five cosmic regions (&quot;moirai&quot;) Uranus (&quot;heaven&quot;), Tartarus, Chaos, Ether/Aer (“sky”) and Nyx (“night”). According to Porphyry, there were all kinds of caves and gates in the world. In classical antiquity caves were associated with sexuality and birth. However, the niches here are not stone caves in mountains, because the world has yet to be shaped. They are cavities in the still primitive, undifferentiated mass of the Earth. At an early stage, Chronos creates with his seed the three elements fire, air (&quot;pneuma&quot;) and water. The Earth element already existed with Chthoniê. Warmth, humidity and &#x27;airiness&#x27; were according to Ancient Greek medicine three properties of seed, and through those principles the embryo developed. The first three concepts are traditional and appear in the Pherecydes fragments (eg fragment DK 7 B4 below). Poets like Probus and Hermias, equated Pherecydes&#x27; Zas with Aether because since Zeus is the Greek sky god, he would have had Aether as his domain. The title &quot;Heptamychos&quot; in the &quot;Suda&quot; is explained by including Gê and Ogenos (hepta = seven). Pherecydes writes that Tartarus lies below the earth (&quot;gê&quot;), so that gê is therefore considered a separate region that could be seen.

Fire, air and water are placed in the niches by Chronos and mixed (&quot;krasis&quot;). Mixing elements in five niches only makes sense if those mixtures are in different proportions. Contrary to later philosophy of Anaxagoras, the world is not created from the mixtures, but a second generation of gods (&quot;theokrasia)&quot;, including Ophion. The formed gods derive their characteristics from the dominant element in each mixture and possibly associate them with the five regions. The elements may also be a later, stoic reinterpretation of the text, as the elements, especially air/pneuma, appear anachronistic and fit within Aristotelian and Stoic physiology. That means Chronos&#x27; seed will go straight into the niches. This representation is possible, because in a scholium at the &quot;Iliad&quot;, for example, it says that Chronos smeared two eggs with his seed and gave it to Hera. She had to keep the eggs underground (&quot;kata gês&quot;) so that Typhon was born, the enemy of Zeus. Typhon is a parallel of Pherecydes&#x27; serpent god Ophion.

===Marriage between Zas and Chthoniê===
It is quite possible that in the course of the theogony the primeval trio changed into the traditional Zeus, Kronos and Hera. Such changes have Orphic parallels: Rhea is Demeter after she becomes Zeus&#x27; mother, and Phanes simultaneously becomes Zeus and Eros. In Pherecydes, Chthoniê becomes Gê through marriage, after which she becomes the protector of the marriage, and that was traditionally the domain of Hera. Hera is also associated with the earth in some sources.

The marriage of the gods is a union (&quot;hieros gamos&quot;) where Zas makes a robe (&quot;pharos&quot;) depicting Gaia and Ogenos. This is an allegory for the acts of creation (&quot;mellonta dêmiourgein&quot;). Zas is a demiurge and creates by turning into Eros. The robe is a covering, namely of Chthoniê, the earth&#x27;s mass, thus taking as its domain the varied surface of the earth and the encircling ocean. Marriage is also etiological, because it explains the origin of the ritual unveiling of the bride (&quot;anakalypteria&quot;). The cloth makes Chthoniê vivid and alive. She is the base matter, but Gê is the form of it. 

The robe hangs on a winged oak. This passage is unique and has several interpretations. The robust oak was traditionally dedicated to Zeus and presumably indicates the solid structure and foundation of the earth. The roots and branches support the earth&#x27;s surface. Below is Tartarus, and above it, according to Hesiod, grow &quot;the &quot;roots&quot; of the earth and the barren sea&quot;. Pherecydes followed this archaic representation. The wings refer to the broad spreading branches of the oak. Over this hangs the cloth, which as the earth&#x27;s surface is thus both smooth and varied in shape. The robe as a mythical image for the earth&#x27;s surface also appears in some Orphic texts. In the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot;, Persephone is weaving a rich robe representing the cosmos when she is carried off by Hades to the underworld.Finally, the proverb &#x27;The face of the earth is the garment of Persephone&#x27; is in the style of early Pythagoreans, who had sayings like &#x27;tears of Zeus&#x27; for rain and &#x27;The sea is the tear of Kronos&#x27;.

The mythical images of the tree as an earthly structure and a robe as a gift at marriage have Greek cultic counterparts. In Plataeae, for example, the Daedala festival was celebrated, in which an oak was cut down to make a statue of a girl dressed as a bride. Zeus gave Persephone Sicily or Thebes, while Cadmus gave a robe to Harmonia. Still, the images may be oriental in origin. There are Mesopotamian parallels of the palace with a complex of spaces reserved for the bride and groom is built. There are also myths such as the one in which Anu takes heaven as his portion, whereupon Enlil takes the earth and gives it as a dowry to Ereshkigal, &#x27;mistress of the great deep&#x27; (&quot;chthoniê&quot;).

=== Theomachy ===
Pherecydes described a battle between Kronos and Ophion similar to that of Zeus and Typhon in Hesiod&#x27;s older &quot;Theogony&quot;. The stake of the battle is cosmic supremacy and is reminiscent of the Titanomachy and Gigantomachy of traditional theogony, in which the successive conflicts between gods are described with the current world order as a result. In Pherecydes&#x27; cosmogony, however, no initial chaos or tyranny is overcome, followed by the establishment of a new order. The creative gods are eternal and co-equal. Their order is temporarily threatened by Ophion, but that threat becomes a (re)affirmation of the divine order, with Kronos as the first king. The battle is also etiological, for it explained the myths about ancient sea monsters in both Greece and Asia Minor and the Middle East. The battle is described by Celsus:
&#x27;Pherecydes told the myth that an army was lined up against army, and he mentioned Kronos as leader of one, Ophion of the other, and he related their challenges and struggles, and that they agreed that the one who fell into Ogenos was the loser, while those who cast them out and conquered should possess the sky&#x27;. 
Chronos has become Kronos here. Presumably, as a prominent second creator, Zas also participates in the battle, after which he becomes Zeus. Ophion did not exist from the beginning but was born and had progeny of his own ( &quot;Ophionidai&quot;). He is serpentine, because his name is derived from &quot;ophis&quot; &#x27;snake&#x27;. Traditionally, Gaia (Gê) was regarded as the mother of Typhon, and Chthoniê/Gê may be the mother of Ophion here. Ophion may also have been produced on her own in Tartarus, the cave under the earth. Typhon also originated in a cave. Otherwise the father may be Chronos, because his seed is the niches of the earth.

Ophion and its brood are often depicted as ruling the birthing cosmos for some time before falling from power. The chaotic forces are eternal and cannot be destroyed; instead they are thrown out from the ordered world and locked away in Tartaros in a kind of &quot;appointment of the spheres&quot;, in which the victor (Zeus-Cronus) takes possession of the sky and of space and time. Cronus (or Zeus in the more popularly known version) orders the offspring out from the cosmos to Tartaros. There they are kept behind locked gates, fashioned in iron and bronze. We are told about chaotic beings put into the pentemychos, and we are told that the Darkness has an offspring that is cast into the recesses of Tartaros. No surviving fragment makes the connection, but it is possible that the prison-house in Tartaros and the pentemychos are ways of referring to the essentially same thing. According to Celsus, Pherecydes said that: &quot;Below that portion is the portion of Tartaros; the daughters of Boreas (the north wind), the Harpies and Thuella (Storm), guard it; there Zeus banished any of the gods whenever one behaves with insolence.&quot; Thus the identity between Zeus&#x27; prison-house and the pentemychos seems likely. Judging from some ancient fragments Ophion is thrown into Oceanus, not into Tartaros. Exactly what entities or forces that were locked away in Pherecydes’ story cannot be known for sure. There may have been five principal figures. Ophion and Typhon are one and the same, and Eurynome fought on the side of Ophion against Cronus. Chthonie is a principal &quot;thing&quot; of the underworld, but whether she is to be counted as one of the five or the five &quot;sum-total&quot; is an open question. Apart from these it is known that Ophion-Typhon mated with Echidna, and that Echidna herself was somehow mysteriously &quot;produced&quot; by Callirhoe. If Pherecydes counted five principal entities in association the pentemychos doctrine, then Ophion, Eurynome, Echidna, Calirrhoe and Chthonie are the main contenders.

== Legacy ==

Pherycydes is seen as a transitional figure between the mythological cosmogonies of Hesiod and the first pre-Socratic philosophers. Aristotle wrote in his &quot;Metaphysics&quot; that Pherecydes was partially a mythological writer and Plutarch, in his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, instead wrote of him being a theologian. Pherecydes contributed to pre-Socratic philosophy of nature by denying that nothing comes from nothing and describing the mixture of three elements. Mixture (&quot;krasis&quot;) plays a role in later cosmologies, such as that of Anaxagoras, Plato (&quot;Timaeus&quot;) and in the Orphic poem &quot;Krater&quot; attributed to the Pythagorean philosopher Zopyrus of Tarentum.

===Pythagoreanism===
Out of all of the philosophers who were historical predecessors of Pythagoras, Pherycydes was the philosopher most often linked with him as one of his teachers. Not many prose treatises existed in the 6th century, Pythagoras may have learned of Pherecydes&#x27; work and adopted the idea of reincarnation. In Pythagoras&#x27; youth, when he still lived on Samos, he is said to have visited Pherecydes on Delos and later buried him. An early variant of this story places this event later in Pythagoras&#x27; life when he lived in Croton. His visit to the sick Pherecydes was used to explain his absence during Cylon&#x27;s rebellion in that city. These stories may have evolved from the story that Pythagoras was a student of Pherecydes. According to Apollonius, Pythagoras imitated Pherecydes in his &#x27;miracles&#x27;. The historicity of the connection between the two has been debated, however, because their philosophies are otherwise unrelated, and because Pythagoras has been attributed all kinds of teachers over time. The confusion among later authors about the attribution of the miracles can perhaps be traced back to the poem of Ion of Chios. Aristotle nevertheless stated in the 4th century BC that both were friends, and the story already about their friendship certainly dates back to the 5th century BC. It is believed that both philosophers once met. 

Pherecydes&#x27; book was thought to have contained a mystical esoteric teaching, treated allegorically. A comparatively large number of sources say Pherecydes was the first to teach the Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis, the transmigration of human souls. Both Cicero and Augustine thought of him having given the first teaching of the &quot;immortality of the soul&quot;. The Christian Apponius mentioned Pherecydes&#x27; belief in metempsychosis in his argument against murder and executions because a good life is rewarded and a bad life is punished in the afterlife. The Middle Platonist Numenius, like Apponius, referred to the idea that the soul enters the body through the seed, and mentions a river in Pherecydes&#x27; representation of the underworld. The Neoplatonist Porphyry added &#x27;corners, pits, caves, doors and gates&#x27; through which souls travel. Finally, the orator Themistius reported that Pherecydes, like Pythagoras, considered killing a great sin. This suggests that impure deeds in a next life or after death must be expiated. Pherecydes may have regarded the soul as at least an immortal part of the sky or aether. That he was the first to teach such a thing is doubtful, but Schibli concludes that Pherecydes like &quot;included in his book [&quot;Pentemychos&quot;] at least a rudimentary treatment of the immortality of the soul, its wanderings in the underworld, and the reasons for the soul’s incarnations&quot;. 
=== Similarities with other cosmogonies ===
The theogony of Pherecydes also shows similarities with Orphic theogonies such as the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot;. Both feature primordial serpents, the weaving of a cosmic robe and eternal Time as god who creates with his own seed by masturbation. Such Orphic aspects also appear in Epimenides&#x27; &quot;Theogony&quot;. Pherecydes probably influenced the early Orphics, or possibly an earlier sect of Orphic practitioners influenced him. The battle between Kronos and Ophion also influenced the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; of pseudo-Apollodorus, who drew on several previous theogonies, such as those of Hesiod and the Orphic religion. The story was also a source for the &quot;Argonautica&quot; by Apollonius of Rhodes, in which Orpheus sings about Ophion and Eurynome who were overthrown by Kronos and Rhea. The association of Kronos with Chronos by the Greeks can probably also be traced back to Pherecydes. There are also many significant parallels between Pherecydes&#x27;s cosmogony, Orphic theogonies, and the preserved accounts of Zoroastrian, Phoenician and Vedic cosmogonies. According to West, these myths have a common source that originates in the Levant. The basic form is as follows. In the beginning there is no heaven and no earth, but a limitless abyss of water, shrouded in deep darkness. This condition has existed for centuries. Then the hermaphrodite and eternal Time makes love to itself. Thus he produces an egg. From that egg appears a radiant creator god, who made it heaven and earth.

<doc id="841455" wikidata="Q878733" url="?curid=841455" title="Samuel B. Moore">
<text>Samuel B. Moore (1789 – November 7, 1846) was the sixth Governor of the U.S. state of Alabama from March 3 to November 26, 1831. He was president of the Alabama Senate when Governor Gabriel Moore was elected to the United States Senate, and so became governor when Gabriel Moore resigned to take the seat.

==Biography==
Samuel Moore was born in Franklin County, Tennessee, in 1789 but moved to Jackson County, Alabama, when he was still young.

His political career began in 1823 when he was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives and then elected to the Alabama Senate in 1828. He served as president of the Senate in 1831 when he succeeded Gabriel Moore.

Like his predecessor, Samuel Moore continued to survey the Coosa River through The Board of Internal Improvement, build infrastructure, and oppose nullification. Moore strongly supported the Bank of the State of Alabama.

Later, in the 1831 election, Moore was entrenched in a heated election battle against John Gayle, who eventually defeated him. After his defeat, he served as the judge of the Pickens County Court from 1835 to 1841.

He was re-elected to his State Senate post in 1834 and again served as the Senate&#x27;s president in 1835. He later returned home to Pickens County, Alabama, and served on its county court from 1835 until 1841.

Moore died in 1846 at age 57 and is interred at the city cemetery in Carrollton in Pickens County.

<text>The Basin Reserve, also known as the Cello Basin Reserve for sponsorship reasons, and commonly referred to as the Basin, is a cricket ground in Wellington, New Zealand. It is used for Test matches, and is the main home ground of the Wellington Firebirds first-class team. The Basin Reserve is the only cricket ground to have listed status with Heritage New Zealand, in recognition of being the oldest first-class cricket ground in the country. Historically, the ground has also been used for events other than cricket, such as association football matches, concerts and cultural events.

The New Zealand Cricket Museum is located in the Old Grandstand. It houses cricket memorabilia and a reference library. It opened in 1987, and was relaunched in 2021.

==Location==

The Basin Reserve is two kilometres south of the Wellington CBD at the foot of Mount Victoria. Government House, St Marks Church School, and the Wellington College boys&#x27; school are to the south of the Basin, across the street. At the eastern end of the basin is the Mount Victoria Tunnel, which increased the traffic flow around the Basin Reserve when it was built in 1931.

The Basin Reserve is also surrounded by numerous other Wellington landmarks, including Mount Cook Barracks, the National War Memorial, several colleges and high schools, the Caledonian Hotel and the former Dominion Museum. A fire station is located across the street from the ground: traditionally its occupants would watch ongoing matches during their down-time, and would set off the station&#x27;s siren to mark New Zealand wickets taken or when a batsman reached a milestone like a 50 or century. The Basin Reserve is the intersection point for the Wellington suburbs of Mount Cook, Newtown and Mount Victoria.

==Construction history==
The area that is now Basin Reserve was originally a lake (known as the Basin Lake), and there were plans to connect it to the sea by a canal to make it an alternative inner city harbour, with major warehouses and factories alongside it. However, the massive 1855 Wairarapa earthquake uplifted the area nearly and turned the lake into a swamp. Due to the colonists&#x27; English roots, sport, particularly cricket, was a vital part of the community&#x27;s way to relax. However, no land had been allocated by the city planners for recreational reserves. Although natural grounds, such as the Te Aro flat, provided a small area for matches, the colonists wanted more recreational land than they had. The matter became dire as buildings began to be erected on these plains, as flat land was hard to find in the mountainous Wellington. So, after the 1855 earthquake, which historians estimate measured magnitude 8, influential citizens seized the chance in 1857 to suggest that the new land be drained and made into a recreational reserve. The Wellington council accepted the proposal and on 3 February 1863 prisoners from the Mount Cook Gaol began to level and drain the new land. The swamp was drained by September and a fence and hedges were placed around the entire area. However, massive population influxes from 1863 to 1866 (caused mostly by the Parliament being situated in Wellington) hampered construction on the Basin Reserve as workers were pulled to other areas.

After a council meeting on 11 December 1866 the Basin Reserve became Wellington&#x27;s official cricket ground. No cattle or horses were allowed in the ground and only small hedges and shrubs were allowed to be planted so as not to hamper cricket games. Soon after, on 11 January 1868, the first game of cricket was played, although the ground had numerous stones and thistles on it, which the umpire later apologised for as some players got injured from them. Although it was the opening day, no ceremony or music was played, nor was the opening advertised with banners.

Soon after that first event, the Highland Games began to be held at the Basin Reserve. The games were organised by the Wellingtonian Caledonian Society, of which their headquarters, The Caledonian Hotel, still stands towards the south of the Basin Reserve. The society offered up prize money which brought many competitors to the region. Due to their success, the society petitioned to have new grandstands built at the western end of the Basin Reserve. They would measure and would cost approximately £250–£300. The stands would also hold food stalls and ground keepers. However, for the following years, even up until reportedly 1872, the Basin Reserve grounds were still extremely swampy, with small pools of swamp water and various weeds and shrubs sprouting over the fields. In late 1872, horses were used to level the playing field and this greatly improved the conditions.
In 1882, the William Wakefield Memorial was erected at the Basin Reserve. The monument had been in storage for many years, and it was finally erected to commemorate a controversial early Wellingtonian, William Wakefield, at the main sports ground.

The pavilion has been a Category II registered Historic Place since 1982, and the entire Basin Reserve has been a registered Historic Area since 1998. The William Wakefield Memorial has a Category I registration.

In 2012 the Museum Stand of the Basin was declared an earthquake risk and closed; a new players&#x27; pavilion was opened in December 2018 and renamed in 2020 in honour of the former Test cricketer Ewen Chatfield.

=== Scoreboard ===
During England&#x27;s 2002 tour the scoreboard was famously described by commentator Mike Selvey as the &quot;ransom-note scoreboard&quot; because of the eccentric collection of fonts that it used.

==Event history==

The first event held at the Basin Reserve was a one-day cricket match on 11 January 1868 between the Wellington Volunteers and the crew of HMS &quot;Falcon&quot;, which was docked in Wellington. However, the match was hampered by injuries due to the numerous stones and thistles in the grass, which led to the injury of some players. The umpire apologised to the players after the match for the poor condition of the playing surface.

After that first event, local clubs and societies began organising athletic and social meetings at the Basin Reserve. These meetings eventually coalesced into a meeting known locally as the &quot;Highland Games&quot;, and it was their success which led to the construction of the ground&#x27;s first grandstand. The events included athletics, racing, dancing and later wood-chopping and cycling. However, the ground was still swampy in some areas. This was finally remedied in late 1872, which allowed the ground&#x27;s inaugural first-class cricket match, between Wellington and Auckland, to be played on 30 November 1873. Wellington won the match easily. The Basin Reserve reputedly held the first rugby football match in the North Island, between a Wellington team and the crew of HMS Rosario, which the sailors won by a single goal.

The Australasian Athletic Championships were held at the Basin Reserve on 26–27 December 1911. This was a combined Australian and New Zealand championship, at which New Zealanders won all the track events and Australians won all the field events.

Before embarking on the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, the Australian rugby league team stopped in Wellington for an exhibition match at the Basin Reserve.

 The first Test match played at the ground was between New Zealand and England, the first day of which was 24 January 1930. One-day international cricket was played at the Basin Reserve until 1999, after which it has mostly been played at the larger Wellington Regional Stadium on the other side of the Wellington CBD.

On 13 March 2011 the Basin Reserve was host to &quot;Fill the Basin&quot;, a cricket event intended to raise money for victims of the 2011 Canterbury earthquake. The event attracted a crowd of more than 10,000 people, with some spectators sitting between the boundary rope and the fence. Players involved in the match included Shane Warne, Stephen Fleming, Tana Umaga, Richard Hadlee, Martin Crowe, other famous former New Zealand cricketers, rugby union players Richie McCaw and Conrad Smith and actors Russell Crowe and Ian McKellen. More than $500,000 was raised towards the relief efforts.

On 17 March 2019 the Basin Reserve hosted an estimated 11,000 people at a vigil mourning the victims of the Christchurch mosque shootings, after indications the original venue would be too small.

In addition to cricket, other sports have also used the Basin Reserve, including rugby union, rugby league, association football and Australian football matches. During the 1950s and 1960s the ground was the main association football (soccer) venue in the Wellington area, and was used for a number of international matches and Chatham Cup finals.

==Statistics==

===Test matches===

There have been 68 Test matches played at the Basin Reserve as of June 2024. The average runs per wicket is 31.42 while the average runs per wicket through New Zealand is 31.27. The average runs per over is 2.85. The ground is more noted as suiting fast bowlers as opposed to spin bowlers. Nine of the top ten wicket takers at the ground are fast bowlers with top wicket taker being Chris Martin with 58 although he only has the 13th best bowling average on the ground.

Brendon McCullum has the highest innings, 302, and is the first Black Cap to pass 300 runs in a test. The previous highest score at the ground and for any NZ test cricketer was the 299 runs by Martin Crowe in 1991 Almost a year later in 2015, Kumar Sangakkara scored his 12000th test runs and his 11th double century there while McCullum dropped three catches and scored a two-ball duck in the first innings. It is also a ground where Trent Boult made the most of his one-handed catches. One of which was the one that removed Sangakkara in 2015. In the same test, Kane Williamson scored his first test double century, with his 6th wicket partner BJ Watling scoring a century in the second innings. Williamson also contributed on the field to help NZ win the test match. His catch also made the top play on Sportscenter in the US. In 2017, this was also the ground where Henry Nicholls scored his maiden Test century. Late in that year, Tom Blundell scored his maiden Test century on debut, then walked home while still in uniform as he lives near the ground.

The highest total set by a team here in Test cricket was by the New Zealand national cricket team when they scored 680/8 dec on 14 Feb 2014 against the Indian national cricket team. The most runs scored at this ground have been by Ross Taylor (1279 runs), Kane Williamson (1137 runs) and Martin Crowe (1123 runs). The most wickets have been taken by Chris Martin (60 wickets), followed by Daniel Vettori (57 wickets) and Richard Hadlee (53 wickets).

=== ODI matches ===
In ODI cricket, the highest total has been set by New Zealand against Pakistan when they scored 315/7 on 6 January 2018. The most runs scored at this ground have been by Martin Crowe (345 runs), Andrew Jones (311 runs) and Nathan Astle (285 runs). The most wickets have been taken by Danny Morrison (16 wickets), Chris Harris (13 wickets) and Gavin Larsen (12 wickets). Despite the propensity to score Test centuries, Basin Reserve is not a ground for scoring ODI centuries. Only 4 had ever been scored. The most recent was by Martin Guptill on 19 January 2018 against Pakistan, 43 years since Bevan Congdon did so. The only away batsman to score an ODI century here was Shoaib Mohammad of Pakistan in 1989.

==International rugby league matches==
Between 1919 and 1953, Basin Reserve played host to 5 rugby league Test matches, all involving the New Zealand national rugby league team who would end up with a 3–2 W/L record at the ground.

<text>John Murphy (1786 – September 21, 1841) was the fourth Governor of the U.S. state of Alabama, serving two terms from 1825 to 1829.

==Biography==

===Early life===
John Murphy was born in 1786 in Robeson County, North Carolina. He attended South Carolina College, now the University of South Carolina, where he was a member of the Clariosophic Society. Among his classmates at South Carolina College were John Gayle and James Dellet. Gayle also became Governor of Alabama while Dellet became a U.S. Congressman from Alabama. Murphy graduated in 1808.

===Career===
He became a clerk at the South Carolina Senate. He was a trustee for the University of South Carolina from 1808 to 1818.

In 1818, he moved to Alabama and was elected to the Alabama House in 1820 and the Alabama Senate in 1822. He was elected Governor of Alabama in 1824, and in 1827 he was elected for a second term. He represented Alabama in the United States House of Representatives from 1833 to 1835.

===Personal life===
Under the date of April 2, 1834, John Quincy Adams records in his diary that Congressman James Blair &quot;shot himself last evening at his lodgings ... after reading part of an affectionate letter from his wife, to Governor Murphy, of Alabama, who was alone in the chamber with him, and a fellow-lodger at the same house.&quot; &quot;Diary&quot; (New York: Longmans, Green, 1929) p. 434.

<text>Israel Pickens (January 30, 1780 – April 24, 1827) was an American politician and lawyer, third Governor of the U.S. state of Alabama (1821–1825), member of the North Carolina Senate (1808–1810), and United States Congressman from North Carolina in the United States House of Representatives (1811–1817).

==Biography==
Born in Concord, North Carolina, Pickens graduated from Jefferson College (now Washington &amp; Jefferson College) in 1802, studied law, and was admitted to the bar. Pickens was a native of North Carolina and represented the &quot;North Carolina Faction&quot; in early Alabama politics, like fellow North Carolina Representative William R. King, with whom he served Congress during the early 1810s. The main opposition to the &quot;North Carolina Faction&quot; was the &quot;Georgia Faction&quot;, which many new settlers to the state viewed as too aristocratic and elitist. At the same time, Pickens was seen as the &quot;spokesman for the have-nots.&quot; Pickens married Martha Lenoir in 1814, the daughter of North Carolina statesman William Lenoir (general). In both 1821 and 1823, Pickens beat Dr. Henry Chambers by a vote of 9,114 to 7,129 and 6,942 to 4,604, respectively.

After serving as governor and being succeeded by his handpicked man John Murphy, Pickens was appointed to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy left by the death of Henry H. Chambers, whom he beat twice for the governorship. He only served from February 17 to November 27, 1826, when the elected successor, John McKinley, took office.

In addition to politics, Pickens participated in the American Colonization Society and was interested in scientific research. He invented a lunar dial.

Pickens died in Matanzas, Cuba, in 1827. He was originally buried in a family graveyard, but his remains were later moved to City Cemetery, Greensboro, Alabama.

<text>Thomas Bibb (May 8, 1783 – September 20, 1839) was the second governor of the US state of Alabama and served from 1820 to 1821. He was the president of the Alabama Senate when his brother, Governor William Wyatt Bibb, died in office on July 10, 1820, as a result of a fall from a horse. By his senatorial office and under the state constitution, Thomas Bibb took over as governor for the remainder of his brother&#x27;s term. He did not seek election as governor but later served in the Alabama House of Representatives.

He was born in Amelia County, Virginia, in 1783. He grew up in Georgia before he moved to what later became Alabama. He was married to Parmelia Thompson from 1809 to his death on September 20, 1839.

<text>, better known as Harold Sakata, was an American Olympic weightlifter, professional wrestler, and film actor of Japanese descent. He won a silver medal for the United States at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London in weightlifting, and later became a popular professional wrestler under the ring name Tosh Togo, wrestling primarily for various National Wrestling Alliance territories as a tag team with Great Togo. He also wrestled in Japan for the Japanese Wrestling Association between 1955 and 1957. On the basis of his wrestling work, he was cast in the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964) as the villain Oddjob, a role he would be closely associated with for the rest of his life.

== Early life ==
Toshiyuki Sakata was born on July 1, 1920, in Holualoa, Hawaii, to Japanese-American parents who worked at a Kona coffee farm. His father Risaburo was &quot;issei&quot; (first-generation), and his mother Matsue was &quot;nisei&quot; (second generation). He had ten siblings, six brothers and four sisters. He adopted the more Western name &quot;Harold&quot; as a teenager.

In 1936, Sakata dropped out of school to help work the family&#x27;s coffee farm. The following year, he started paid employment at a sugar plantation located about 75 miles away from his home, after which he went to the island of Lanai to work on a pineapple plantation. He then moved to Maui to do more agricultural work, and in 1938 he ended up in Honolulu, where he lived for much of his adult life.

During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army with the 1399th Engineer Construction Battalion, and was briefly deployed to Hawaii.

== Weightlifting career ==
At the age of eighteen, Sakata weighed only 113 lb (8 st 1 lb) (51 kg) at a height of 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m). Wishing to &quot;look as good as the other guys&quot;, he started lifting weights. Because all YMCA facilities were racially segregated at the time, he trained primarily at the all-Asian Nu&#x27;uanu YMCA. Among his lifting partners was future Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) champion Emerick Ishikawa.

After about a year of serious training Sakata had gained about twenty pounds. Inspired by this success he started entering local lifting contests and in 1941 he won the Territorial light-heavyweight championship. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor stopped travel to the mainland but over the next two years Sakata won several more Oahu championships; in June 1943, at 165 pounds, he was pressing 250, snatching 240, and clean and jerking 310, for a total of 800 pounds.

Following his military discharge, Sakata remained in Honolulu, and became &quot;de facto&quot; leader of a group of local lifters including Richard Tomita.

During a tournament held at the Nuuanu YMCA in November 1946, Sakata set a Hawaiian record in both the snatch and the clean-and-jerk, plus an unofficial world record in the press. The same year he also won the Mr. Hawaii physique title. Henry Koizumi, athletic director of the tournament, suggested that Sakata and his partner Richard Tom organize a weightlifting team. The goal was to place well in the USA Weightlifting National Championships, which were held in Dallas, Texas, in June 1947. Sakata placed first in the 181-pound class with a total lift of 800 pounds. Tom meanwhile placed first in the 123-pound division with a total lift of 610 pounds.

Sakata subsequently qualified for United States&#x27; 1948 London Summer Olympic team, lifting a total of 380 kg in the light-heavyweight division and winning a silver medal behind Stanley Stanczyk, against whom he later competed in the US Senior National Championships.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early years ===
In 1949, Sakata retired from weightlifting and began training in professional wrestling. His instructors were Tetsuro Higami and Ben Sherman. He initially wrestled as &quot;the Human Tank, Mr. Sakata&quot;, drawing on his World War II service and Olympic accolades to play a face, though he later adopted his more well-known heel gimmick of Tosh Togo.

Under the Togo gimmick, Sakata wrestled across Hawaii and later toured mainland America and Canada, mostly on the West Coast and in the Pacific Northwest, which had a large Japanese immigrant population he proved popular with. He briefly formed a tag-team with Frank Stojack during a tour of Washington state, and also tagged with Tor Yamato during a Midwestern tour.

=== Japan ===
In July 1951, NWA Hawaii promoter Al Karasick invited Sakata to join a special overseas tour to Japan, sponsored by a Tokyo Shriners chapter as a charity venture for a children&#x27;s hospital. Sakata and several other wrestlers flew to Tokyo, where they held a series of shows at the Metropolitan Memorial Hall and Ryōgoku Kokugikan. One such show was historically significant for being the professional wrestling debut of Rikidōzan, a Korean-born sumotori who became one of the most popular and influential figures in Japanese professional wrestling history, nicknamed &quot;the Father of Puroresu&quot;.

According to the official website of the city of Minato, Rikidōzan was introduced to professional wrestling while visiting a gym in Shiba where Sakata and his colleague Bobby Bruns were training for an upcoming match. Bruns became Rikidōzan&#x27;s first ever opponent. He joined Sakata and Bruns in their tour of Japan, wrestling a series of matches across the country in which Rikidōzan soundly beat his foreign opponents, among them retired heavyweight boxer Joe Louis, helping to establish his popular reputation.

The tour lasted until January 1952, at which point most of the wrestlers returned to America. Sakata remained for another few months, during which time he met and married his wife. He was granted permanent residency in Japan and lived there with his family for some time, but eventually moved back to America due to the constant back-and-forth travel.

=== Tag-team success ===
Sakata returned to America in 1952, and had his first televised match on May 26 on a card that included former judoka Masahiko Kimura and Kinji Shibuya. It was during this period that Sakata adopted the ring name Tosh Togo – Tosh was a shortened form of his given name &quot;Toshiyuki&quot; and Togo was derived from early 20th-century Japanese admiral Tōgō Heihachirō.

Sakata was billed as the kayfabe brother of Great Togo, as well as Masutatsu Oyama as &quot;Mas Togo&quot; and judoka Kokichi Endo as &quot;Ko Togo&quot;. As a tag team, Sakata and Great Togo held the NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship. Sakata also tagged with Rikidōzan (with whom he unsuccessfully challenged for the inaugural All Asia Tag Team Championship against King Kong Czaja and Tiger Joginder Singh) and King Curtis Iaukea (with whom he won the NWA Hawaii Tag Team Championship). He also held the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship, the WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship, and the NWA World Tag Team Championship (with Red Berry).

==Acting career==
Bond producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli took notice of Sakata because of his heavy build—he stood 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and weighed 284 lb (129 kg)—which, when coupled with his intimidating gaze, made him the perfect choice for the part of Oddjob. Another story, told by director Guy Hamilton, stated that he&#x27;d first seen Sakata wrestling in Australia.

Sakata had never acted before, besides pro wrestling, but the film character was to be mute (other than a few uttered grunts) and would require little theatrical skill. Before Sakata had secured the role of Oddjob, another former wrestler, British actor Milton Reid, had auditioned for the role. Reid allegedly challenged Sakata to a shoot wrestling contest and suggested that the winner ought to get the role. However, given that Reid had been in &quot;Dr. No&quot; (playing one of the titular villain&#x27;s guards) and that his character had been killed off, the producers decided to go with Sakata and the wrestling match did not take place.

As Oddjob, he was a bodyguard to Bond villain Auric Goldfinger, and his sharpened, steel-brimmed bowler hat became a famous and much-parodied trademark of the Bond series. While filming Oddjob&#x27;s death scene, in which the character is electrocuted, Sakata&#x27;s hand was badly burnt by the effect, but he held on until he heard director Guy Hamilton call &quot;Cut&quot;.

Sakata appeared in several other movies in similar roles and took on &quot;Oddjob&quot; as an informal middle name (in the films &quot;&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington&quot; (1977), he was credited as Harold &quot;Oddjob&quot; Sakata).

With time, Sakata&#x27;s acting skills developed. He co-starred opposite William Shatner in the movie &quot;Impulse&quot; (1974), in which he played the character Karate Pete. He also guest starred on a &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; episode as Rory Calhoun&#x27;s henchman, and an episode of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. In 1971, Sakata was a regular on the short-lived TV series, &quot;Sarge&quot;, starring George Kennedy and made a guest appearance on Laugh In, Season 5, Episode 7. In 1979 he was a regular on &quot;Highcliffe Manor&quot;.

Sakata appeared as Oddjob in a series of TV commercials for Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup in the 1970s. The advertisement commonly showed Oddjob with a nasty cough, which results in him demolishing everything around him as his spasms make him inadvertently lash out, frightening his wife as his condition deteriorates. She grabs a bottle of Vicks Formula 44 and gives Oddjob a spoonful of the cough syrup, which cures his cough; the two bow to each other, and then the wife looks past Oddjob to take in the destruction he has caused. This was occasionally followed by an add-on for a cough drop version of the syrup, which Oddjob ingests before he is claimed by a coughing fit in an extremely crowded space. At least one domestic and one outdoor version of this commercial are known. Sakata made an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on which he parodied the commercial by destroying Carson&#x27;s set.

==Personal life==
Sakata had two children, born in 1954 and 1957. He only married once, and divorced his wife due to the strain placed on their relationship by his constant travel.

==Death==
Sakata died of liver cancer four weeks after his 62nd birthday, on July 29, 1982, in St Francis Hospital, Honolulu, Hawaii. Five months beforehand, Sakata had made one final public appearance at the 54th Academy Awards. Sakata briefly appeared on stage in his Oddjob attire during Sheena Easton&#x27;s musical performance of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;.

<doc id="841478" wikidata="Q1926913" url="?curid=841478" title="Manfred Mann's Earth Band">
<text>Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band are an English rock band formed by South African musician Manfred Mann. Their hits include covers of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;For You&quot;, &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; and &quot;Spirit in the Night&quot;. After forming in 1971 and with a short hiatus in the late 1980s/early 1990s, the Earth Band continues to perform and tour, as of 2024.

==History==
===Formation===

Keyboardist Manfred Mann started in the 1960s with the self-titled band that had such hits as &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot; and then moved on to jazz fusion-inspired Manfred Mann Chapter Three before forming the Earth Band in 1971. 
Feeling that Chapter Three had suffered from too many self-imposed rules, being frustrated with mostly only playing Mike Hugg&#x27;s compositions and not being an economically feasible venture (due to the number of musicians involved) were all reasons for forming the new group, which was open to songs from outside the band (like Mann&#x27;s earlier groups) and developed due to the different musical backgrounds of its members as opposed to adhering to a strict musical concept.

The original line-up consisted of Mick Rogers (guitar and vocals), Manfred Mann (keyboards, Minimoog synthesizer and vocals), Colin Pattenden (bass guitar) and Chris Slade (drums and vocals). In its very earliest stages, the band was sometimes billed as &quot;Manfred Mann&quot; and thus a continuation of the 1960s group, sometimes as &quot;Manfred Mann Chapter Three&quot; due to that being the most recent incarnation of Mann&#x27;s career. The quartet released their first single, Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Please, Mrs. Henry&quot;, in 1971, simply credited to &quot;Manfred Mann&quot;. A debut album &quot;Stepping Sideways&quot; was recorded but not released because the band&#x27;s style was rapidly maturing, and the group felt it was not representative of their live act anymore. In September 1971, a new name was chosen. Manfred Mann suggested a title containing &quot;band&quot; (which almost rhymes with &quot;Mann&quot;) and after considering the likes of &quot;Arm Band&quot;, &quot;Head Band&quot; and &quot;Elastic Band&quot;, Chris Slade suggested &quot;Earth Band&quot;, a name both related to the band&#x27;s originally straightforward musical style and the ecological movement ongoing at the time.

Their second single, Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;Living Without You&quot;, was still credited to &#x27;Manfred Mann&#x27; in Europe, but by &#x27;Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band&#x27; in the US, where the track became a minor chart hit. On two non-charting single releases in the UK in 1972/73, the group was billed simply as &#x27;Earth Band&#x27;, but otherwise, from 1972 forward, &#x27;Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band&#x27; was the band name used on all releases. The membership of the Earth Band was stable between 1971 and 1976, during which time they released their first six albums. The iconic logo, which appeared on the band&#x27;s most future album covers, debuted on the second released LP, &quot;Glorified Magnified&quot;.

=== Themes ===
The Earth Band combines the stylistic approach of progressive rock with Mann&#x27;s jazz-influenced Moog synthesizer playing and emphasis on melody. Beside producing their own material, a staple of the band&#x27;s music and live performances from the beginning has been also relying on covers of songs by other modern pop/rock artists, notably Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, in their progressive rock style.

Mann&#x27;s interest in English 20th century classical music saw him adapt Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;Planets Suite&quot; and turn a version of the &quot;Jupiter&quot; movement into a UK hit entitled &quot;Joybringer&quot; (perhaps surprisingly excluded from the 1973 album &quot;Solar Fire&quot;). Other classical music adaptations include &quot;Questions&quot; from the 1976 album &quot;The Roaring Silence&quot; (which is based on the main theme of Franz Schubert&#x27;s Impromptu in G flat Major), &quot;Earth, the Circle, Pt. 1&quot; from &quot;Solar Fire&quot; (which uses the melody from Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Jimbo&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;) and &quot;Starbird&quot; also from 1976&#x27;s &quot;The Roaring Silence&quot; (which is based upon Igor Stravinski&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Firebird&quot;).

The title song to 1973&#x27;s &quot;Messin&#x27;&quot; (written by Mike Hugg and originally recorded by Chapter Three on their unissued third album), as well as most of the 1974 album &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, tapped into ecological concerns, a recurring theme in Mann&#x27;s music in later years, with &quot;The Good Earth&quot; giving away a free gift of a piece of land in Wales with each album sold.

Like other prog-rock acts, the band also issued concept albums on space and sci-fi themes (particularly the 1973 album &quot;Solar Fire&quot; and the singles &quot;Launching Place&quot; off the 1974 &quot;The Good Earth&quot; and &quot;Starbird&quot; off the 1976 &quot;The Roaring Silence&quot;) and religious or biblical imagery (&quot;Prayer&quot; on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Buddah&quot; on &quot;Messin&quot;&#x27;, Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Father of Day, Father of Night&quot; and &quot;In the Beginning, Darkness&quot; on &quot;Solar Fire&quot;, &quot;The Road to Babylon&quot; and &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; on &quot;The Roaring Silence&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot; on the 1979 &quot;Angel Station&quot;).

Social criticism was also addressed (&quot;Black and Blue&quot; on &quot;Messin&quot;&#x27; dealt particularly with slavery and &quot;Chicago Institute&quot; on &quot;Watch&quot; with mental institutions and science as a means of social control); a trend which grew throughout the 1980s, with songs such as &quot;Lies (Through the 1980s)&quot; on technological progress vs. social setbacks on &quot;Chance&quot; (1980), and with Mann&#x27;s growing involvement with the anti-apartheid movement which was featured on the 1982 album &quot;Somewhere in Afrika&quot;. Mann&#x27;s intention for acknowledgement of oppressed ethnic groups also influenced the 1992 album &quot;Plains Music&quot;, which featured traditional Native American music.

===1970s===
The group&#x27;s sixth album, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Nightingales &amp; Bombers&quot;, took its title from a World War II naturalist&#x27;s recording of a nightingale singing in a garden as warplanes flew overhead; the recording appears in a track on the album (the US version included an extra track, a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s; &quot;Quit Your Low Down Ways&quot; sung by Mick Rogers). After this album, Mick Rogers left the band (temporarily, and he still contributed backing vocals to the next album). He was replaced by two musicians, Chris Thompson (lead vocals, guitar) and Dave Flett (lead guitar, backing vocals).

The US breakthrough for the band came in the third week of February 1977, when they charted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with a cover of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; from &quot;The Roaring Silence&quot;.

&quot;The Roaring Silence&quot; also featured a guest appearance by jazz saxophonist Barbara Thompson. Taking advantage of the publicity of their hit song, the band re-released another Springsteen song, &quot;Spirit in the Night&quot;, re-titled &quot;Spirits in the Night&quot;, which the band had released the previous year on &quot;Nightingales &amp; Bombers&quot;, in a vocally re-cut version with Chris Thompson taking a new lead vocal in place of Mick Rogers&#x27; vocal on the original album version.

Following these popular successes, the Earth Band released the album &quot;Watch&quot; (1978), which produced another UK hit single in &quot;Davy&#x27;s on the Road Again&quot;. This song, as well as the re-recording of &quot;Mighty Quinn&quot; (also released as a single to celebrate the original 1968 hit&#x27;s tenth anniversary), was recorded live with studio overdubs. Before the recording of the album, original bassist Colin Pattenden had departed and was replaced by Pat King.

===1980s===
Drummer Chris Slade and lead guitarist Dave Flett left before 1979&#x27;s &quot;Angel Station&quot;. It was announced that Chris Thompson would also be leaving at this same time to pursue his own group, Night, but Night quickly faded after scoring two hits and Thompson was back in time for the Earth Band&#x27;s next album and tour. Flett was replaced by guitarist Steve Waller, who shared lead vocals with Thompson. Geoff Britton played drums on the album but was soon replaced by John Lingwood, due to illness.

1980&#x27;s &quot;Chance&quot;, featuring several guest vocalists alongside Thompson, Mann and Waller, showed a move towards a more electronic approach and produced several cuts that were hits in the UK and/or saw significant airplay in both the US and UK, with the songs &quot;Lies (All Through the 80&#x27;s)&quot; sung by Thompson, &quot;Stranded&quot; and &quot;For You&quot; (another Springsteen song sung by Thompson). Trevor Rabin, a fellow South African and London session musician, and lead guitarist of the 1980s version of Yes, guested on the album, as did original Earth Band guitarist Mick Rogers. Bassist Pat King left the group in 1982 to be replaced by bassist/guitarist Matt Irving.

By this time, Mann had become personally active in the international anti-apartheid movement and was banned from entering his home country of South Africa. Undeterred, members of the band made journeys to South Africa to record African musicians for the 1983 album &quot;Somewhere in Afrika&quot;. The album included a cover of The Police&#x27;s &quot;Demolition Man&quot; (sung by Steve Waller) and a version of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Redemption Song&quot;.

The accompanying tour (incorporating visual effects such as cartoons, robots and exploding amplifiers) was a big success and led to the Budapest live album, which was later followed by a DVD of the TV broadcast. After this tour, Steve Waller left the band. Mick Rogers returned, taking Waller&#x27;s place.

In 1984 the band issued the single &quot;Runner&quot;, a cover of the song by Ian Thomas, which had been written in response to cancer sufferer Terry Fox and his run across Canada for cancer awareness. Fox had succumbed to the cancer before finishing. The Manfred Mann version featured Chris Thompson on lead vocals and Mick Rogers on backing vocals. The song was a non-LP single in the UK but was included on the US release of &quot;Somewhere in Afrika&quot;. It was a top 40 hit in both Canada and the US and was used during ABC&#x27;s broadcasting of the 1984 Summer Olympics and in the film &quot;The Philadelphia Experiment&quot;. At 22 on the Hot 100 it was their biggest hit since &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; and was the band&#x27;s second highest-charting song, as well as their final US/UK chart single.

Irving exited the group shortly after the single. Steve Kinch played bass on this album &quot;Criminal Tango&quot; (1986), which featured both Mick Rogers and Chris Thompson on vocals. For 1987&#x27;s &quot;Masque&quot; album, the band consisted solely of Manfred Mann, Mick Rogers and drummer John Lingwood. Shortly thereafter, the Earth Band name was retired for four years.

===Recent years===
Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band was revived in 1991 with a lineup of Manfred Mann, Mick Rogers, Steve Kinch, singer Noel McCalla and former Jethro Tull drummer Clive Bunker and resumed recording, covering tracks by artists as varied as Paul Weller, Robert Cray, Del Amitri and The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful. Mann has also released solo projects, including &quot;Plains Music&quot;, which was based on Native American music, and &quot;2006&quot;, which includes collaborations with the German rapper Thomas D and tracks featuring the music of, amongst others, the Super Furry Animals.

The Earth Band has had a fluctuating line-up, with Mann being the only continuous member. After drummer Clive Bunker left in 1996, he was succeeded by John Trotter (1996–2000), Richard Marcangelo (2000–2002), Pete May (2002), Geoff Dunn (2002–2007), Jimmy Copley (2007–2015) and then a returning John Lingwood in 2016. Vocalist/guitarist Chris Thompson returned in 1996 to sing alongside Mick Rogers and Noel McCalla until 1999 (then again in 2004, briefly). McCalla was replaced by Peter Cox in 2009, but returned in 2010 for a short time filling in for Cox. Since Cox departed in early 2011, Robert Hart (ex-Bad Company) has been the singer, along with Mick Rogers.

Most of the band&#x27;s original albums have been re-released in recent years and a 4-CD set (&quot;Odds &amp; Sods - Mis-takes &amp; Out-takes&quot;) featuring many previously unissued versions of tracks was released in August 2005. This includes material from the unreleased (and thought to be lost) Manfred Mann &quot;Chapter III Volume 3&quot; album and the first Earth Band album, &quot;Stepping Sideways&quot;. The fourth CD in the package includes both unreleased studio material and live performances.

December 2006 saw the release of the DVD &quot;Unearthed 1973–2005 The Best of Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band&quot;. This features twenty tracks ranging from three recorded in Sweden in 1973 (&quot;Father of Day&quot;, &quot;Captain Bobby Stout&quot; and &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot;) to a 2005 performance of &quot;Mighty Quinn&quot;. Also included are animations used during the band&#x27;s live performances of the late 1970s and early 1980s and promo films (including two tracks from the &quot;Plains Music&quot; album).

In 2007 two separate dance remixes of Bruce Springsteen songs as performed by Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band entered the Austrian Charts. The first was a remix of &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot;, which was credited to &quot;Michael Mind featuring Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band&quot;. The second was a remix of &quot;For You&quot;, credited to &quot;The Disco Boys featuring Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band&quot;. Also in 2007, the 1983 Budapest concert was released in DVD format and included tracks not previously available.

In 2008 the band released the &quot;Watch&quot; DVD which includes footage from a 1979 Austrian concert.

In 2010 the song &quot;You Are - I Am&quot; from &quot;Angel Station&quot; was sampled by Kanye West on his critically acclaimed album: &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.&quot;

In 2023, the band celebrated their 2000th live performance with the release of the compilation &quot;2000 Concerts... And Counting&quot;. The Earth Band continues to perform and tour, as of 2024.

==Personnel==
===John Lingwood===

Drummer John Lingwood was born on 18 February 1951 in Wembley, London, England. He began playing drums in the 1960s, being heavily influenced by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, turning pro in 1968. During this time he played with a few bands, mainly in Europe.

In 1972 he joined Steamhammer, staying with them for two and a half years. For the next couple of years Lingwood tried several unsuccessful attempts at forming bands and also started working more as a studio musician. 1974, he joined Stomu Yamashta&#x27;s East Wind and later that year went on to join Leo Sayer.

Lingwood has played with many musicians over the years, including Roger Chapman (still doing occasional gigs), Maddy Prior and Elkie Brooks. He featured on the albums &quot;Chance&quot;, &quot;Somewhere in Afrika&quot;, &quot;Budapest Live&quot;, &quot;Criminal Tango&quot; and &quot;Masque&quot;.

Since leaving the band he has performed with the Company Of Snakes between 1998 and 2002, featuring on the live album &quot;Here They Go Again&quot; and the studio album &quot;Burst the Bubble&quot;.

He rejoined Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band in 2016 as a substitute for Jimmy Copley, who had been diagnosed with leukemia and later died in 2017.

===Steve Kinch===

Bassist Steve Kinch was born on May 17, 1955. Kinch first started playing guitar when his parents bought him his first instrument for Christmas at the age of 12. At 14, he began playing in local cover bands. At 16 he left school and became a glass blower while continuing to play music in local bands.

When he was 18, his friend Steve Demetri asked him if he was willing to switch from guitar to bass. The reason for this was that his band &quot;Stallion&quot; needed a bass player. Kinch agreed to try this and actually stayed with the bass as his instrument.

In 1974 he was poached by Andy Qunta (who later became successful with the band Icehouse, among others), Tony Qunta and Lol Cooksey, with whom he formed the band &quot;Factory&quot;. Kinch accepted the band&#x27;s offer partly because it could offer him far more gigs than &quot;Stallion&quot;. In the following period, &quot;Factory&quot; played in all parts of the United Kingdom. At some point in 1977/78, &quot;Factory&quot; broke up. However, Andy and Tony Qunta subsequently continued to play with Kinch in the formation &quot;Head On&quot;, which attempted to implement more sophisticated music. In the emerging punk era, however, this was not very hip and &quot;Head On&quot; turned out to be a short-lived project.

In 1980 Kinch got the opportunity to audition for and subsequently join the band of singer and actress Hazel O&#x27;Connor through Andy Qunta as well as saxophonist Wesley Magoogan, both of whom, like Kinch, were from his birthplace of Hastings. This engagement ended after several tours and television appearances, an album and several hit singles. After trying to realize different projects, in 1984 he was hired by Jim Capaldi for his band. However, Kinch completed only a few performances with the band, a planned three-month U.S. tour was canceled at short notice. Kinch however did work with Capaldi later again for his final album &quot;Poor Boy Blue&quot;.

Then in 1985, again through Andy Qunta, Kinch got the chance to audition for the open position of bassist with Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band. Qunta, who had written the song &quot;Tribal Statistics&quot; for the 1982 Earth Band album &quot;Somewhere in Afrika,&quot; took over Manfred Mann&#x27;s keyboards for this audition, apparently so that Mann could better concentrate on the auditioning bassists. But this also put Qunta in a position to give Kinch valuable hints and details about the songs being played. Kinch successfully survived the audition and joined the Earth Band as a permanent member in summer of 1985. At that time, part of the following album &quot;Criminal Tango&quot; had already been recorded. Kinch therefore shared the bass parts on this album with bassists Durban Betancourt-Laverde and John Giblin. The launch of the &quot;Criminal Tango&quot; tour on March 24, 1986, in Woking, Surrey was Kinch&#x27;s first live performance with the Earth Band. Between 1987 and 1991, Kinch toured with The Rubettes. Kinch was not involved in the Earth Band&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Masque&quot;, and due to its commercial failure, Manfred Mann disbanded the Earth Band. In the spring of 1991, however, Mann decided to bring the band back to life. The reformed lineup included Kinch again. Regular performances and studio recordings with the Earth Band, however, still allowed Kinch to work for other musicians in the studio. In 1992, recording began for a new Earth Band album with Kinch on bass, but it would take some time to complete. It was not until 1996 that it was released under the title &quot;Soft Vengeance&quot;. From the live recordings of the following tour, in which Kinch participated, the live album &quot;Mann Alive&quot; was also released. Subsequently, Kinch toured with the Earth Band very regularly, was involved in the recording of some of Manfred Mann&#x27;s releases, some of which were released under &quot;Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band&quot; such as the 2004 live DVD &quot;Angel Station in Moscow&quot;, but also other names such as &quot;Manfred Mann &#x27;06&quot; or simply &quot;Manfred Mann&quot;. He continues to be an integral part of the band and their live performances to this day.

<text>J. Lee Richmond (May 5, 1857 – October 1, 1929) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball. He played for the Boston Red Stockings, Worcester Worcesters, Providence Grays, and Cincinnati Red Stockings, and is best known for pitching the first perfect game in Major League history. After retiring from baseball, he became a teacher.

==Early life==
Richmond was born in Sheffield, Ohio, in 1857. He was the son and grandson of Baptist ministers and he had eight siblings, all of them older. He went to the college preparatory academy affiliated with Oberlin College. He started attending Brown University in 1876 and was an outfielder and pitcher on the school&#x27;s baseball team. He was also class president and he played on the football team.

==Professional baseball career==
On June 2, 1879, Richmond was paid $10 ($ in current dollar terms) to pitch for Worcester of the National Baseball Association in an exhibition game against the Chicago White Stockings. He pitched a seven-inning no-hitter and signed with Worcester after the game. On July 28, he pitched a no-hitter against Springfield.

Worcester joined the National League in 1880, and Richmond signed with the team for $2,400 ($ in current dollar terms) that season. Before a game against Cleveland on June 12, Richmond was up all night taking part in college graduation events, and he went to bed at 6:30 AM. He caught the 11:30 AM train for Worcester so he could pitch in the afternoon contest and then pitched a perfect game to beat Cleveland, 1–0. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Clevelands were utterly helpless before Richmond&#x27;s puzzling curves, retiring in every inning in one, two, three order, without a base hit. The Worcesters played a perfect fielding game.&quot; Cleveland pitcher Jim McCormick allowed three hits, and the only run was scored on a double error by second baseman Fred Dunlap.

Richmond graduated from Brown University four days after the perfect game, and he finished the year with a win–loss record of 32–32, a 2.15 earned run average, and 243 strikeouts in 590.2 innings pitched. He was the first left-handed pitcher to win 30 games in a season.

Richmond found success throwing an offspeed pitch that he termed a &quot;half-stride ball&quot; and that other players referred to as a &quot;drop ball&quot;. He also had a rising fastball that he called a &quot;jump ball&quot;. He also learned to throw a curveball in college, even though a Brown physics professor tried to convince him that nothing could make a ball curve in midair.

In both 1881 and 1882, Richmond pitched over 400 innings. After the 1882 season, the Worcester franchise disbanded, and Richmond played for the National League&#x27;s Providence Grays in 1883. He experienced arm problems and was primarily an outfielder that year. He finished his MLB career with a record of 75–100, a 3.06 ERA, and 552 strikeouts.

==Later life==
In the winter of 1880, Richmond had begun to pursue a career in medicine, studying under a Providence physician, C. T. Gardner. He enrolled at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York a few months later, then at the University of the City of New York. After the 1883 baseball season, Richmond practiced medicine at Bellevue Hospital and with Gardner in Providence.

Richmond then changed careers, and from 1890 to 1921, he was a high school chemistry teacher at Scott High School in Toledo, Ohio. Richmond married Mary Naomi Chapin, his former student, in 1892, and had three children: Ruth, Dorothy, and Jane. He died in Toledo in 1929.

<doc id="841484" wikidata="Q720222" url="?curid=841484" title="Asada Goryu">
<text>was a Japanese physician and astronomer who helped integrate western and Japanese astronomy in the Edo period. He introduced several western astronomical instruments and methods into Japan and independently confirmed Kepler&#x27;s third law. 

Asada was the pseudonym based on the name of his village. Born (birthday given as 6 February 1734, Japanese year Kyoho) as Yasuakira Ayabe, his father, Keisai Ayabe came from a landed Kitsuki clan from Bungo, Kyushu. Asada spent much of his career in the flourishing commercial city of Osaka, where he practiced medicine for a living. He, then, took over his father&#x27;s practice as an official physician in 1767. Because of the Japanese government&#x27;s policy of seclusion, Western scientific theory was generally available only through obsolete Chinese works edited by Jesuit missionaries in China. Yet Asada managed to construct sophisticated mathematical models of celestial movements and is sometimes credited with the independent discovery of Kepler&#x27;s third law. Asada also studied anatomy in western texts and his learnings were incorporated into a compilation by his friend Riken Nakai (1732-1817) in &quot;Esso-rohitsu&quot; (1773).

The crater Asada on the Moon is named after him.

<doc id="841487" wikidata="Q729018" url="?curid=841487" title="William W. Bibb">
<text>William Wyatt Bibb (October 2, 1781 – July 10, 1820) was a United States Senator from Georgia, the first governor of the Alabama Territory, and the first Governor of the U.S. state of Alabama. Bibb was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party and served as governor of Alabama until his death on July 10, 1820, from a horse riding accident. He is the first of only three people in U.S. history to be elected a U.S. Senator from one state and the governor of another. Bibb County, Alabama, and Bibb County, Georgia, are named for him.

==Early life==
William Wyatt Bibb was born on October 2, 1781, in Amelia County, Virginia, to Captain William Bibb, an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and a member of the state legislature, the General Assembly of the newly independent Commonwealth of Virginia, and his wife, Sally (Wyatt) Bibb.

Around 1784, Bibb Sr. moved with his family south to Georgia with a large number of Virginians who accompanied General George Mathews, hero of the Battle of Brandywine in Pennsylvania. Most of the general&#x27;s followers were also veterans and, with their families, took advantage of the new nation&#x27;s offer of land bounties in lieu of pay for former soldiers. They established tobacco farms on the rich lands around the confluence of the Broad and Savannah Rivers in newly developing northeastern Georgia. The Bibbs are recorded as one of the earliest pioneer families in Elbert County.

Bibb was probably privately educated before he went to the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia. He was awarded a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree in 1801, returned to Georgia, and began to practice medicine in Petersburg. In 1803, he married Mary Freeman.

==Early political career==
Bibb was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1802 as a member at the age of 21. He took office in 1803 and served one two-year term. In 1806 he was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Ninth session of the United States Congress to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of Thomas Spalding, and was re-elected four times, serving until November 6, 1813.

As was then the practice, he was elected at that time by the state legislature to the US Senate to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of William H. Crawford, a nationally known presidential candidate. Bibb served until November 9, 1816.

As a Senator in 1816, Bibb opposed the first attempt to abolish the Electoral College and elect the president by popular vote, speaking very forthrightly about the advantages slave states derived from the Electoral College. He stated on the Senate floor that with Popular Vote, these states &quot;would lose the privilege the Constitution now allows them, of votes upon three-fifths of their population other than freemen. It would be deeply injurious to them.&quot;

== Governor of Alabama ==
US President James Monroe appointed Bibb as the first governor of the newly formed Alabama Territory (from the larger previous Mississippi Territory) in 1817. Alabama became the 22nd state on December 14, 1819.

Bibb&#x27;s primary duties were establishing the state government. Huntsville was designated to be the site of the constitutional convention. Bibb was elected governor by defeating Marmaduke Williams and receiving 8,342 votes to Williams&#x27;s 7,140 votes. The capital was chosen to be the newly created town of Cahawba in 1820 on the Alabama frontier but moved to Tuscaloosa in 1826 and finally to the central city of Montgomery in 1846.

During Bibb&#x27;s tenure, the Alabama state militia was established, and the beginnings of the state judicial system, along with the organization of and appointments to the Supreme Court of Alabama, were accomplished.

Henry Hitchcock was elected the first Attorney General of Alabama and initially held the position of Secretary of State of Alabama as well. However, shortly afterward, Thomas A. Rodgers was elected as the second Secretary of State of Alabama. The first session of the Alabama state legislature was held from October 25, 1819, to December 17, 1819. William R. King and John W. Walker were chosen as the state&#x27;s first US Senators.

To date, Bibb is one of only three individuals to have served as governor of a state and as a US senator from a different state. The others are Sam Houston, who (among his other political offices) served as the sixth governor of Tennessee and a US senator from Texas (a state, like Alabama, which also had not existed when he held his governorship), and Mitt Romney, who served as the seventieth governor of Massachusetts and a US senator from Utah.

==Death==
At the age of 38, Bibb was thrown from his horse during a violent thunderstorm, and died from internal injuries on July 10, 1820. His brother, Thomas Bibb, was president of the State Senate and filled out his term as governor.

William Bibb is buried in Coosada, Alabama. Because he was the state&#x27;s first governor, his likeness appears on the Alabama Centennial half dollar minted in 1921.

<doc id="841492" wikidata="Q1265190" url="?curid=841492" title="Worcester Worcesters">
<text>The Worcester Worcesters were a 19th-century Major League Baseball team from 1880 to 1882 in the National League. The team is referred to, at times, as the Brown Stockings or the Ruby Legs; however, no contemporary sources from the time exist that support the use of either name. The team played their home games at the Worcester Driving Park Grounds in the Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds, located south of Highland Street between Sever Street and Russell Street in Worcester, Massachusetts.

==History==
In 1879, Worcester played in the National Association, a league consisting of teams in the Northeast. The National League was interested in Worcester as a potential replacement for the failed Syracuse Stars franchise primarily based on the performance of their ace pitcher, Lee Richmond, who pitched several exhibition games against National League opponents and went 6–2. He also pitched and won one game for the Boston Red Stockings. To admit Worcester to the National League, the league&#x27;s board of directors waived the requirement that league cities have a population of at least 75,000 (Worcester&#x27;s population was 58,000). To raise the capital to support their entry into the major leagues, the team sold shares for $35 (with the price including a season ticket), sponsored a walking race that attracted 3,000 people, arranged for discount packages of train fare and baseball tickets for fans from outside the city, and held benefit concerts and dramatic performances.

In December 1879, Worcester became the first professional baseball team to visit Cuba. The trip was a financial failure, as they were only able to play two games against Cuban teams.

On June 12, 1880, pitcher Lee Richmond threw the first perfect game in Major League history, against the Cleveland Blues. The team made history again on August 20 of the same year by becoming the first team to be no-hit at home, when Pud Galvin of the Buffalo Bisons defeated them 1–0.

According to Lee Allen, Cincinnati writer and eventual director of the Baseball Hall of Fame, the Worcester club impacted the National League in another way in 1880; it was instrumental in having the Cincinnati Reds expelled from the league after the season, due to violations of the league rules against selling beer at the ballpark. In his 1948 book, &quot;The Cincinnati Reds&quot; (published by Putnam), Allen took some satisfaction in pointing out that the Reds re-formed in 1882, initially as a member of the American Association, the same year that Worcester&#x27;s days as a major league franchise, as well as their influence, came to an end.

The Worcester team was dropped from the league shortly before the end of the 1882 season, as Worcester was seen as too small to support major league sport; the team was encouraged to finish out its schedule as a lame duck team. Their last two games of the season against the Troy Trojans (also expelled from the NL for the same reasons) drew only 6 and 25 fans respectively; the attendance of six is a record low attendance for all league games open to spectators.

Needing an eighth team to balance the schedule, the National League granted an expansion franchise to Philadelphia, known as the Philadelphia Quakers. This team would evolve into the Philadelphia Phillies (a name used interchangeably with Quakers until 1890). Many sources, including the Phillies themselves, suggest that the Worcester club was moved to Philadelphia; however, only Worcester&#x27;s former NL spot was moved. All available evidence suggests there is no direct link between the two teams. Most significantly, no players from the 1882 Worcester club ended up with the 1883 Phillies.

<text>was a Japanese astronomer, best known for his discovery that many asteroid orbits were more similar to one another than chance would allow, leading to the concept of asteroid families, now called &quot;Hirayama families&quot; in his honour.

== Biography ==
Hirayama studied astronomy at Imperial University of Tokyo and graduated in 1897. He taught astronomy in the engineering school of the General Staff Office of the Japanese Army between 1897 and 1901. In 1906 he became Assistant Professor of Astronomy at Tokyo Imperial University; in 1919 he became a Professor. From 1906 to 1907 Hirayama was a member of the Committee that determined the latitude border at Sakhalin after the Russo–Japanese War. In 1911 he received a doctoral degree &quot;with several papers about latitude variation&quot;. Hirayama started working on asteroids in 1905; in 1918 he published papers &quot;Researches on the distribution of the mean motions of the asteroids&quot; and &quot;Groups of asteroids probably of common origin&quot;, and, later &quot;Families of asteroids&quot; (1922) and &quot;Note on an explanation of the gaps of the asteroidal orbits&quot; (1928). In 1935 he published his main work, &quot;Asteroid&quot;.

The crater Hirayama on the Moon is jointly named after him and Shin Hirayama. The asteroid 1999 Hirayama is named in his honour.

<text>, also read as Makoto Hirayama, was the first Japanese astronomer to discover an asteroid. In 1900, he discovered 498 Tokio and 727 Nipponia. The crater Hirayama on the Moon is jointly named after him and Kiyotsugu Hirayama.

== Biography ==
Shin Hirayama was born in Edo (now Tokyo) and the second son of a former guard of the Shogun. He was a disciple of astronomer and mathematician Hisashi Terao, and finished the course of astronomy at the Tokyo Imperial University in 1890. After graduating, he was sent to England by the Japanese government to help further his studies in astronomy. He worked on astronomical spectroscopy at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Several months later, he went to Potsdam, Germany, where he stayed for about three years. He also attended lectures in Berlin and Leipzig during his stay in the country. During this time, he also published a paper on various diffraction patterns.

When he came back to Japan in 1895, he started work as a professor of astronomy at the Tokyo Imperial University where he taught practical astronomy, stellar astronomy, orbit determination and geodesy. He later became director of the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory in 1919.

In March of 1900, Shin Hirayama discovered 498 Tokio and 727 Nipponia. However, as he was not able to determine their orbits, he is not recognized as having discovered them. He was still granted naming rights over the Tokio asteroid. He also suggested &quot;Nippon&quot;, as a name for 727 Nipponia, and its discoverer Adam Massinger named the minor planet &quot;Nipponia&quot; — a Latin feminized form of the word &quot;Nippon&quot; — in his honor.

<text>Barbara Jean McDougall (born November 12, 1937) is a former Canadian politician. She served as a Member of Parliament from 1984 to 1993, and as Secretary of State for External Affairs from 1991 to 1993. She did not run again in the 1993 Canadian federal election which saw the incumbent Progressive Conservative government reduced to two seats in the House of Commons.

In 2000 she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

== Government and political experience ==
McDougall served as a member of parliament from St. Paul&#x27;s (Toronto) for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada from 1984 to 1993. At the Cabinet table she was a vocal proponent of free choice for women in the abortion debate. She based her opposition to Senate reform partly on the fact that this institution is responsible for the state of abortion law in Canada at present.

She held the following government posts:
McDougall has remained active in conservative political circles. She was a member of the Red Tory Council and supported auto-parts magnate Belinda Stronach&#x27;s campaign to become leader of the new Conservative Party of Canada in winter 2004.

On January 14, 2005, McDougall participated in the Atlantic Storm pandemic preparedness exercise at the Center for Biosecurity of UPMC, playing the fictional role of Prime Minister of Canada. On December 18, 2006, it was announced that she would be appointed as a panelist on the Internal Trade Implementation Act for a period of five years.

==Education==
McDougall received a B.A. from the University of Toronto in political science and economics in 1963.

== Other careers ==
McDougall has previously been an advisor for Toronto law firm Aird &amp; Berlis LLP where she counsels clients on matters of international business development, corporate governance and government relations.

She is the chair of Global Panel America and a member of the Global Panel Foundation&#x27;s worldwide supervisory board based in Berlin, Prague and Sydney. She has served as a Canadian representative to the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, D.C., and The International Crisis Group in Brussels, Belgium.

A Scotiabank director from 1999 to 2008, she sat on the Audit and Conduct Review Committee and the Human Resources Committee. She had previously served as Chair of the Conduct Review/Pension Committee.

McDougall was on the board of Stelco Inc. and the Independent Order of Foresters. She is a director of Unique Solutions Design Ltd.

She has worked as a business reporter for the Vancouver Sun, an analyst for Odlum Brown and at brokerage firm A.E. Ames, where she became the company&#x27;s first female vice president.

From October 2004 to March 2010 McDougall served on the Board of Directors of &quot;Imperial Tobacco Canada&quot;, the Canadian subsidiary of British American Tobacco. In that capacity she chaired the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of Imperial Tobacco Canada.

=== Controversial position at IDRC ===

In December 2007 McDougall was appointed chair of the board of Canada&#x27;s International Development Research Centre (IDRC). Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett criticized her appointment as Chair of IDRC because of the conflict of interest it created between her role as director of a tobacco company and chair of an agency funding tobacco control efforts. The press release announcing her appointment did not mention her ongoing directorship of Imperial Tobacco. It is also omitted from her bio on the IDRC website.
As a result of this serious conflict of interest, a major tobacco control coordination meeting in Africa funded by IDRC was boycotted by its participants and the Gates Foundation pulled US$5 million of tobacco control funding from IDRC in April 2010.

There is a Barbara McDougall fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

<doc id="841498" wikidata="Q3245514" url="?curid=841498" title="List of TNA X Division Champions">
<text>The TNA X Division Championship is a professional wrestling championship owned by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) professional wrestling promotion. The title was created and debuted on June 19, 2002, at the taping of TNA&#x27;s second weekly pay-per-view (PPV) event.

Title reigns are determined either by professional wrestling matches between wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines, or by scripted circumstances. Wrestlers are portrayed as either villains or heroes as they follow a series of tension-building events, which culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches for the championship. Title changes that happen on episodes of TNA&#x27;s primary television program, &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, air on television two to nine days from the date the match was taped. Changes that happened on weekly PPV events aired either during a live broadcast or aired on taped delay up to seven days apart. The inaugural champion was A.J. Styles, who defeated Low Ki, Jerry Lynn, and Psicosis in a Four Way Double Elimination match on June 19, 2002, at the taping of TNA&#x27;s second weekly PPV event, which aired on June 26, 2002. Chris Sabin currently holds the record for the most reigns, with ten. At 301 days, Austin Aries&#x27; first reign is the longest in the title&#x27;s history. At less than one day, Eric Young&#x27;s only reign, Rockstar Spud&#x27;s second reign, and Sabin&#x27;s sixth reign are the shortest in the title&#x27;s history. Overall, there have been 109 reigns shared among 54 wrestlers, with 13 vacancies.

Moose is the current champion in his first reign. He defeated Mike Bailey on October 27, 2024, during the &quot;Impact!&quot; tapings to win the title (aired November 7).

<doc id="841502" wikidata="Q1529258" url="?curid=841502" title="Glanzmann's thrombasthenia">
<text>Glanzmann&#x27;s thrombasthenia is an abnormality of the platelets. It is an extremely rare coagulopathy (bleeding disorder due to a blood abnormality), in which the platelets contain defective or low levels of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GpIIb/IIIa), which is a receptor for fibrinogen. As a result, no fibrinogen bridging of platelets to other platelets can occur, and the bleeding time is significantly prolonged.

==Signs and symptoms==
Characteristically, there is increased mucosal bleeding:
* heavy menstrual bleeding
* easy bruising
* nosebleeds
* Bleeding from the gums
* gastrointestinal bleeding
* postpartum bleeding
* increased postoperative bleeding.

The bleeding tendency is variable but may be severe. Bleeding into the joints, particularly spontaneous bleeds, are very rare, in contrast to the hemophilias. Platelet numbers and morphology are normal. Platelet aggregation is normal with ristocetin, but impaired with other agonists such as ADP, thrombin, collagen, or epinephrine.

==Cause==
Glanzmann&#x27;s thrombasthenia can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner or acquired as an autoimmune disorder.

The bleeding tendency in Glanzmann&#x27;s thrombasthenia is variable, some individuals having minimal bruising, while others have frequent, severe, potentially fatal hemorrhages. Moreover, platelet αIIbβ3 levels correlate poorly with hemorrhagic severity, as virtually undetectable αIIbβ3 levels can correlate with negligible bleeding symptoms, and 10%–15% levels can correlate with severe bleeding. Unidentified factors other than the platelet defect itself may have important roles.

==Pathophysiology==
Glanzmann&#x27;s thrombasthenia is associated with abnormal integrin αIIbβ3, formerly known as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GpIIb/IIIa), which is an integrin aggregation receptor on platelets. This receptor is activated when the platelet is stimulated by ADP, epinephrine, collagen, or thrombin. GpIIb/IIIa is essential to blood coagulation since the activated receptor has the ability to bind fibrinogen (as well as von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and vitronectin), which is required for fibrinogen-dependent platelet-platelet interaction (aggregation). Understanding of the role of GpIIb/IIIa in Glanzmann&#x27;s thrombasthenia led to the development of GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors, a class of powerful antiplatelet agents.

==Diagnosis==
Light transmission aggregometry is widely accepted as the gold standard diagnostic tool for assessing platelet function, and a result of absent aggregation with any agonist except ristocetin is highly specific for Glanzmann&#x27;s thrombasthenia. Following is a table comparing its result with other platelet aggregation disorders:
==Treatment==
Therapy involves both preventive measures and treatment of specific bleeding episodes.
* Dental hygiene lessens gingival bleeding
* Avoidance of antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen, and anticoagulants
* Iron or folate supplementation may be necessary if excessive or prolonged bleeding has caused anemia
* Hepatitis B vaccine
* Antifibrinolytic drugs such as tranexamic acid or ε-aminocaproic acid (Amicar)
* Desmopressin (DDAVP) does not normalize the bleeding time in Glanzmann&#x27;s thrombasthenia but anecdotally improves hemostasis
* Hormonal contraceptives to control excessive menstrual bleeding
* Topical agents such as gelfoam, fibrin sealants, polyethylene glycol polymers, custom dental splints
* Platelet transfusions (only if bleeding is severe; risk of platelet alloimmunization)
* Recombinant factor VIIa, AryoSeven or NovoSeven FDA approved this drug for the treatment of the disease in July 2014.
* Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for severe recurrent hemorrhages

==Eponym==
It is named after Eduard Glanzmann (1887–1959), the Swiss pediatrician who originally described it.

==History==
The subsequent studies, following Eduard Glanzmann&#x27;s description of hemorrhagic symptoms and &quot;weak platelets&quot;, demonstrated that these patients have prolonged bleeding times and their platelets failed to aggregate in response to activation. In the mid-1970s, Nurden and Caen and Phillips and colleagues discovered that thrombasthenic platelets are deficient in integrins αIIbβ3.

<doc id="841504" wikidata="Q8034144" url="?curid=841504" title="Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds">
<text>Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds was a site in Worcester, Massachusetts, in the 19th century. The grounds are mainly known for having hosted the Worcester Worcesters, a professional baseball team of the National League from 1880 to 1882. As a major-league ballpark, the site is usually referred to as Agricultural County Fair Grounds or Worcester Driving Park.

==Location==
The site was bounded by Highland Street (north), Sever Street (east), Cedar Street (south), and Agricultural (later Russell) Street (west). The grounds were just east of the large public park called Elm Park. Today, the former fairgrounds property contains a grid of streets, and many homes and businesses, including the now closed Becker College.

==History==
The Fairgrounds were home to an agricultural fair and to a horse trotting track, usually called the Driving Park. &quot;Driving&quot; was a commonly used synonym for trotting, long before the term came to be associated primarily with the not-yet-invented automobile. The Driving Park opened in May 1872, and hosted baseball by August of that year. Horse racing at the grounds took place as late as July 1894, but appears to have ceased after that time due to local officials disallowing &quot;pool-selling&quot; (gambling) on races.

===Professional baseball===
Driving Park hosted some professional baseball games prior to Worcester acquiring its own franchise. These included an exhibition between the National Association (NA) pennant winner Boston Red Stockings and runner-up Philadelphia Whites, played on October 30, 1873, after the end of the season—Boston prevailed, 15–9, before a crowd of 2,000. A regular-season NA contest was held at Driving Park on October 30, 1874, between Boston and the Hartford Dark Blues. Hartford won, 17–11, in front of a crowd of 500.

The Worcester Worcesters competed in 1879 in a later National Association (unrelated to the earlier NA), then for three seasons, 1880 to 1882, in the major-league National League (NL). On June 12, 1880, Worcester pitcher Lee Richmond threw the first perfect game in major-league history. There is a granite post commemorating the perfect game on the former Becker College campus. The park was also the site of the first, true major league doubleheader. For the price of a single game, Worcester fans saw two games against the Providence Grays on September 25, 1882.

The last game for the local major-league club was played on September 29, 1882, with Troy defeating Worcester, 10–7. But it was not the last major-league game in Worcester; five years later, on August 17, 1887, the fairgrounds hosted an NL game between Washington and Boston. The contest—to make up a previously postponed game in the District of Columbia—was played in Worcester at the recommendation of Washington manager John Gaffney, who had grown up in Worcester. Boston won, 6–5.

<text>Ambazonia, alternatively the Federal Republic of Ambazonia or State of Ambazonia, is a political entity proclaimed by Anglophone separatists who are seeking independence from Cameroon. The separatists claim that Ambazonia should consist of the Northwest Region and Southwest Region of Cameroon. Since 2017, Ambazonian rebels have engaged in armed conflict with the Cameroonian military, in what is known as the Anglophone Crisis, and have attempted to set up governments-in-exile, and supportive militias have exerted control over parts of the claimed territory. No country has recognized Ambazonia&#x27;s existence as of 2025.

Until 1961, the territory of these regions was the southern part of a British trust territory, British Cameroon while the rest of Cameroon was a French trust territory, French Cameroon. At independence, a plebiscite was held, and voters in Southern Cameroons opted to join Cameroon as a constituent state of a federal republic. Over time, the power of the central government, dominated by Francophones, expanded at the expense of the region&#x27;s autonomy. Many inhabitants identify as Anglophones and resent what they perceive as discrimination and efforts to eliminate Anglophone legal, administrative, educational, and cultural institutions by the Cameroonian government.

In 2016 and 2017, a widespread protest movement was met with a violent government crackdown, which led to rioting and violence against security forces and, in 2017, a unilateral declaration of independence by Ambazonian leaders. The violence developed into a guerrilla war, and , clashes continue, with population centers and strategic locations largely controlled by the government engaged in counterinsurgency actions, with swathes of more remote, rural areas controlled by separatist militias and used to launch guerrilla attacks. Ambazonian forces have struggled to form a united front, and internecine conflicts have hampered efforts to negotiate with Cameroon or establish control over the various militia groups engaged in the fighting. Ongoing violence has led to widely reported human rights abuses by both sides, including indiscriminate killing of civilians, torture, rape and other gender-based crimes, unjustified detentions, and kidnappings.

== Etymology and terminology ==

The term &quot;Ambazonia&quot; is derived from the word &quot;Ambozes&quot;, the local name for the bay at the mouth of the Wouri river, known in English as Ambas Bay. The name was coined by Fon Gorji Dinka in 1984 as part of a campaign for the restoration of autonomy and preservation of Anglophone institutions in the region.

The term &quot;Ambazonia&quot; is more usually associated with the separatist or independence-seeking faction, while the Cameroonian government and other official sources, such as the UN, continue to refer to the &quot;Northwest Region&quot; and &quot;Southwest Region&quot; (or sometimes the &quot;NoSo&quot; regions), the official names of the two administrative provinces since 1972. As an alternative to &quot;Ambazonia&quot;, separatists have also used &quot;Ambaland&quot;. Other sources may also refer to &quot;Southern Cameroons&quot;, &quot;Anglophone Cameroon&quot; or &quot;Cameroon&#x27;s Anglophone regions&quot;.

To refer to the French-speaking parts of Cameroon, Ambazonian separatists have used the term &quot;la République&quot; and more derogatory descriptors like &quot;banana republic&quot; or &quot;colonial Cameroun&quot;. &quot;Banana republic&quot; is used as a criticism of the Cameroonian institutions, whereas &quot;colonial Cameroun&quot; is used to criticize the Francophone dominance. The Ambazonian activists call the war zone of the Anglophone Crisis &quot;Ground Zero&quot;, a reference to the destruction caused by the civil war.

== Origins ==
=== Colonial contest in the region ===

The area around the mouth of the Wouri River is where the English language was permanently established for the first time in Southern Cameroons, when missionary Alfred Saker founded a settlement of freed slaves by Ambas Bay in 1858, which was later renamed Victoria (present-day Limbe). In 1884, the area became the British Ambas Bay Protectorate, with Victoria as its capital. Britain ceded the area to the German territory of Kamerun in 1887. Germany had some trouble establishing control over the hinterlands of Victoria, and fought the Bafut Wars against local fondoms until 1907.

Following World War I and the Treaty of Versailles, Kamerun was divided between a French and a British League of Nations Mandate. The French mandate was known as Cameroun, and comprised most of the former German territory. The British mandate was an elongated strip of land along the border of Colonial Nigeria, consisting of Northern Cameroons and Southern Cameroons, including the historical Ambas Bay Protectorate. This territory was organized as British Cameroons.

The British administered the territories through indirect rule, allowing native authorities to administer the population according to their own traditions. In 1953, the Southern Cameroons delegation at a conference in London asked for a separate region. The British agreed, and Southern Cameroons became an autonomous region with its capital still at Buea. Elections were held in 1954 and the parliament met on 1 October 1954, with E. M. L. Endeley as Premier.

=== 1961 referendum ===

The United Nations organised a plebiscite in the region on 11 February 1961 which put two alternatives to the people: union with Nigeria or union with Cameroon. The third option, independence, was opposed by the British representative to the UN Trusteeship Council, Sir Andrew Cohen, and as a result was not listed. In the plebiscite, 60% of voters in the Northern Cameroons voted for union with Nigeria, while 70% of voters in the Southern Cameroons opted for union with Cameroon. The results owed partly to a fear of domination by much larger Nigeria. Endeley was defeated in elections on 1 February 1959 by John Ngu Foncha.

Southern Cameroons federated with Cameroon on 1 October 1961 as &quot;West Cameroon&quot;, with its own prime minister. However, the English-speaking peoples of the Southern Cameroons did not believe that they were fairly treated by the 80% majority French-speaking government of the country. Then-president Ahmadou Ahidjo feared that Southern Cameroons would secede from the union, taking its natural resources with it. Following a French Cameroon unilateral referendum on 20 May 1972, a new constitution was adopted in Cameroon which replaced the federal state with a unitary state, and also gave more power to the president. Southern Cameroons lost its autonomous status and became the Northwest Region and the Southwest Region of the Republic of Cameroon. Pro-independence groups claimed that this violated the constitution, as the majority of deputies from West Cameroon had not consented to legitimize the constitutional changes. They argued that Southern Cameroons had effectively been annexed by Cameroon. Shortly afterwards, French Cameroun&#x27;s political leadership changed the constitution again, appointed French-speaking Paul Biya as Prime Minister and successor to Ahmadou Ahidjo.

In a memorandum dated 20 March 1985, Anglophone lawyer and President of the Cameroon Bar Association Fongum Gorji Dinka wrote that the Cameroonian government led by Paul Biya was unconstitutional and announced the former Southern Cameroons should become independent as the Republic of Ambazonia. Dinka was incarcerated the following January without trial. Three years later, he escaped to Nigeria.

=== Southern Cameroons National Council ===

In 1993, representatives of Anglophone groups convened the first All Anglophone Conference (AAC1) in Buea. The conference issued the &quot;Buea Declaration&quot;, which called for constitutional amendments to restore the 1961 federation. This was followed by the second All Anglophone Conference (AAC2) in Bamenda in 1994. This conference issued the &quot;Bamenda Declaration&quot;, which stated that if the federal state was not restored within a reasonable time, Southern Cameroons would declare its independence. The AAC was renamed the Southern Cameroons Peoples Conference (SCPC), and later the Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation (SCAPO), with the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC) as the executive governing body. Younger activists formed the Southern Cameroons Youth League (SCYL) in Buea on 28 May 1995. The SCNC sent a delegation, led by John Foncha, to the United Nations, which was received on 1 June 1995 and presented a petition against the &#x27;annexation&#x27; of the Southern Cameroons by French Cameroon. This was followed by a signature referendum the same year, which the organisers claim produced a 99% vote in favour of independence with 315,000 people voting.

SCNC activities were routinely disrupted by police. On 23 March 1997, about ten people were killed in a raid on a gendarme camp in Bamenda. The police arrested between 200 and 300 people, mostly SCNC supporters, but also members of the Social Democratic Front, an opposition party with significant support in the Anglophone regions. In the subsequent trials, Amnesty International and the SCNC found substantive evidence of admissions through torture and force. The raid and trial resulted in a shutdown of SCNC activities. In response to this, in April 1998 a small faction elected Esoka Ndoki Mukete, a high-ranking member of the Social Democratic Front, as the new chair of the SCNC. In October 1999, when many of the accused were found guilty in the 1997 trial, the faction led by Mukete became more assertive. On 1 October 1999, militants took over Radio Buea to proclaim the independence of Southern Cameroons, but failed to do so before security forces intervened. The leadership and many members of the SCNC were subsequently arrested. After clashes with the police, the SCNC was officially declared illegal by the Cameroonian authorities in 2001. In 2006, a faction of SCNC once again declared the independence of Ambazonia.

=== Protests and Anglophone Crisis ===
In November 2016, a number of large protests and strikes were organized, initially by Anglophone lawyers, students, and teachers focused on the growing marginalization of English and Anglophone institutions in the law and education. Several demonstrations were violently dispersed by security forces, leading to clashes between demonstrators and police in which several people were killed. Violence by both sides undermined negotiations in early 2017, which fell apart without an agreement. The violence led to additional demonstrations, general strikes (called &quot;lockdowns&quot;), and further crackdowns by the government into early 2017, including the banning of civil society organizations, cutting off phone and internet connections from January to April, and arrests of demonstrators. Although the government established a Commission to focus on Anglophone grievances and took steps to address issues of language equity in courts and schools, continued distrust and harsh responses to protests prevented significant deescalation.

By late 2017, with dialogue efforts moribund and violence continuing on both sides, the leading Ambazonian nationalist movements organized the umbrella organization Southern Cameroons Ambazonia Consortium United Front (SCACUF). SCACUF unilaterally declared the region&#x27;s independence as Ambazonia on 1 October, the anniversary of Southern Cameroons&#x27; independence from the United Kingdom. SCACUF sought to transition itself into an interim government with its leader, Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius, as interim president. At least 17 people were killed in protests following the declaration of independence, while fourteen Cameroonian troops were killed in attacks claimed by the Ambazonia Defence Forces. The Cameroonian government stated that the declaration had no legal weight and on 30 November 2017, the President of Cameroon signaled a harder line on separatist attacks on police and soldiers. A massive military deployment accompanied by curfews and forced evacuations of entire villages. This temporarily ended hopes for continued dialogue and kicked off full-fledged guerilla war in Southern Cameroons. Several different armed factions have emerged such as the Red Dragons, Tigers, ARA, Seven Kata, ABL, with varying levels of coordination with and loyalty to Ambazonian political leaders. In practice, pro-independence militias operate largely autonomously from political leaders, who are mostly in exile.
On 5 January 2018, members of the Ambazonia Interim Government in exile in Abuja, Nigeria, including President Sisiku Julius Ayuk Tabe, were arrested and deported to Cameroon into the custody of government forces to face criminal charges. On 4 February 2018, it was announced that US-based preacher Dr. Samuel Ikome Sako would become the Interim President of the Federal Republic of Ambazonia, temporarily succeeding Ayuk Tabe. However, despite receiving a life sentence on terrorism charges from a Cameroon court, on 2 May 2019, Ayuk Tabe declared from prison the dissolution of Sako&#x27;s caretaker cabinet and the restoration of his own cabinet. Sako resisted, leading to the 2019 Ambazonian leadership crisis.
As the violence intensified, international efforts to resolve the crisis picked up. On 13 May 2019, the United Nations Security Council had an informal meeting to discuss the Anglophone Crisis. Peace talks mediated by the Swiss government have fallen apart multiple times, primarily due to factional divisions and lack of actual control over militias by separatist leaders making even preliminary steps difficult.

The war has been characterized by guerilla attacks by separatist militias against both security forces and against civilians suspected of collaboration or simply failing to abide militia&#x27;s declared school and election boycotts or &quot;lockdowns&quot; which prevent all travel and activity. Many militias have sought to enforce a total school strike since 2017 due to concerns over the lack of Anglophone teachers and curriculum. Teachers and students have been kidnapped and killed and many schools and school materials burned while many children have had no schooling since the crisis began. Others have alleged that some militias have engaged in ransom attacks against civilians to fund their continued activities. Meanwhile, government forces have torched entire villages suspected of harboring separatists, disappeared and executed civilians without due process, and tortured detainees. Reports of indiscriminate killings, torture, rape and other gender-based violence by both sides have been widely reported. The governments of the United States and Germany have expressed concern over the human rights violations and scaled back or cancelled military cooperation with Cameroon over reported abuses. France, the UK as well as the European Parliament have also expressed concern and pushed for negotiations between the parties to resolve the crisis.

== Separatist forces ==
=== Interim government and exile groups ===
The separatists assert that Ambazonia is legally governed by the &quot;Interim Government of Ambazonia&quot;, as a provisional government in exile. In course of the insurgency, however, this government-in-exile splintered several times, resulting in infighting and several factions claiming to be the legitimate leadership of Ambazonia. This infighting hampered the coordination among the rebels as well as negotiations between separatists and the Cameroonian government.

Despite the Interim Government&#x27;s internal disputes, its members and other exile activists have maintained some influence over the separatist militias operating in Cameroon itself. For instance, separatist exiles have organized fundraising campaigns which included the introduction of their own cryptocurrency, the AmbaCoin; the resulting money is then used to buy weaponry for the militias on the ground. The commanders of some militias also operate from exile.

In order to provide the separatist movement with some cohesion and strengthen the idea of an Ambazonian nation state, exile activists have also set up a variety of other organizations to support the Interim Government. These include the &quot;Southern Cameroons Ambazonia Consortium United Front&quot; (SCACUF), the &quot;Southern Cameroon Broadcasting Corporation&quot; (SCBC) to spread propaganda, and a &quot;Southern Cameroon Ambazonia Education Board&quot; (SCAEB) to enforce a new curriculum in schools in the rebel areas. Currently, a proposal by members of the Ambazonia Interim Government in exile states that the Federal Republic of Ambazonia would be a federation made up of three autonomous states (however, within the proposed constitution in &#x27;Article 1, Section 1.a&#x27; this number may be subject to change).

=== Media ===
Ambazonian separatists have a major presence in the Internet, and effectively use social media to spread their ideas. In the early phase of the Anglophone Crisis, the &quot;Southern Cameroons Broadcasting Corporation&quot; (formed by exiles in South Africa) was a major channel to distribute propaganda in Cameroon to incite Anglophones into siding with the rebels. Cameroon attempted to then ban the channel, but failed as people could still view it on the internet. On the same day the BBC reported that, Voice of America reported that a cable TV distributor got arrested for four days for airing images of the SCBC. On social media platforms such as Facebook, hate speech, propaganda and disinformation have been shown by both sides. The Ambazonians have been accused of using fake news headlines and photo manipulation. Over the course of the insurgency, Ambazonian insurgents have also framed their struggle in religious terms to gain support.

=== Rebel groups ===

The separatist insurgents involved in the Anglophone Crisis consider themselves loyal to Ambazonia and use the Ambazonian national symbols, but they are split into dozens of often competing militias of changing political allegiances. The militia commanders have been described as &quot;warlords&quot; by researchers. The armed separatists are locally called &quot;Amba Boys&quot;. The militias generally vary in size, ranging from small groups to alliances with hundreds of members. The rebel militias are mainly recruited from Anglophone youths who have either lost family members to Cameroonian security forces or believe that they have no future on the labour market of a Francophone Cameroon. Militias are also known to conscript people, including children, into their ranks. Some rebels have also kidnapped girls to serve as sex slaves.

Many guerilla groups have joined the Ambazonia Self-Defence Council (ASC) under the Interim Government. Major non-ASC groups include the Ambazonia Defence Forces (ADF) and the Southern Cameroons Defence Forces (SOCADEF), which both cooperate with the ASC on some level. There are also dozens of smaller militias. The insurgent groups differ considerably in their aims and methods, though they generally enjoy some level of grassroots support among the rural population. However, civilian support suffered over the rebellion&#x27;s course, as a growing number of locals became dissatisfied with the separatists&#x27; conduct, rebel infighting, and the conflict&#x27;s extended duration. Most rebel groups engage to some level in criminal activities such as kidnapping for ransom and illegally taxing the local cocoa industry to sustain themselves.

A significant number of rebels also use religion to justify their operations. Protective magic and charms (&quot;odeshi&quot;) are important to many insurgents, but &quot;de-contextualised Biblical and Koranic verses&quot; are also used in propaganda videos. Rebel leaders such as General No Pity have publicly suggested that they enjoy mythical and religious protection to enhance their reputation.

== Language ==
Ambazonians generally use the Cameroonian English dialect. However, separatist forces have also developed a unique slang in the context of the insurgency. For instance, rebels call their camps &quot;churches&quot;, conveying deeper spiritual meaning to these important places where insurgents can organize and hide. Researcher Roderick Lando also speculated that the term &quot;church&quot; was connected to the rebels conducting rituals invoking protective magic at their camps. Similarly, some rebels refer to their guns as &quot;bibles&quot; and their attacks as &quot;crusades&quot;, whereas others use the terms &quot;sugarcane&quot; or &quot;stick&quot; for weapons and &quot;groundnuts&quot; for cartridges. Lando argued that the usage of more sacrosanct terms by only some rebel factions may had resulted from the internal disagreements within the separatist movement. In contrast, the term &quot;frying popcorn&quot; for combat situations is very common among rebels. When rebels state that they &quot;wasted&quot; an individual, they describe an assassination. Traitors are termed &quot;blacklegs&quot;. Those who had suffered amputations, often as a result of torture by rebel militias, are described as &quot;short-sleeved&quot;, while the act of cutting off someone&#x27;s fingers is termed &quot;garri&quot;.

<doc id="841517" wikidata="Q412791" url="?curid=841517" title="Ajima Naonobu">
<text>, also known as Ajima Manzō Chokuyen, was a Japanese mathematician of the Edo period.

His Dharma name was (祖眞院智算量空居士).

==Work==
Ajima is credited with introducing calculus into Japanese mathematics. The significance of this innovation is diminished by a likelihood that he had access to European writings on the subject. Ajima also posed the question of inscribing three mutually tangent circles in a triangle; these circles are now known as Malfatti circles after the later work of Gian Francesco Malfatti, but two triangle centers derived from them, the Ajima–Malfatti points, are named after Ajima.

Ajima was an astronomer at the Shogun&#x27;s Observatory (&quot;Bakufu Temmongaki&quot;).

==Legacy==
In 1976, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) honored Ajima by identifying a crater on the Moon with his name. Naonobu is a small lunar impact crater located on the eastern Mare Fecunditatis, to the northwest of the prominent crater Langrenus.

<text>Sergei Iosifovich Parajanov (January 9, 1924 – July 20, 1990) was a Soviet film director and screenwriter. He is regarded by film critics, film historians and filmmakers to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.

Parajanov was born to ethnic Armenians in Georgia. He studied in Russia at Moscow&#x27;s Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography under the tutelage of Ukrainian filmmakers Igor Savchenko and Oleksandr Dovzhenko, and began his career as professional film director in 1954. Parajanov became increasingly disenchanted of his films as well as the state sanctioned art style of socialist realism, prominent throughout the Soviet Union. His film &quot;Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors&quot;, his first major work which diverged from socialist realism, and gave him international acclaim. He would later disown and proclaim his films made before 1965 as &quot;garbage.&quot; Parajanov subsequently directed &quot;The Color of Pomegranates,&quot; which was met with widespread acclaim among filmmakers, and is often considered one of the greatest films ever made.

Parajanov was a closeted bisexual, which exposed him to increased legal scrutiny from Soviet authorities over his personal life, his films, and political involvement surrounding Ukrainian nationalism. Nearly all of his film projects from 1965 to 1973 were banned by the Soviet film administrations, many without discussion.

==Biography==

Sergei Iosifovich Parajanov was born to artistically inclined ethnic Armenians Iosif Parajanov and Siranush Bejanova on January 9, 1924, in Tiflis, Georgia, then part of the Soviet Union. Iosif was a merchant who owned an antique shop, trading jewelry and valuables. Due to the Soviet Union&#x27;s ban on financial speculation, Iosif&#x27;s business was frequently subjected to arbitrary searches by authorities, who often raided his business and seized many of his valuables. Because it was impossible for his father to get his trading business legalised, a young Parajanov was often forced to swallow small jewelry pieces and defecate them once authorities withdrew from their search. Parajanov attended a local railway college before running away to attend the Tbilisi State Conservatoire. He was later transferred to the Moscow Conservatory in 1945, where he studied alongside soprano Nina Dorliak. Parajanov left the conservatory to enrol at the directing department at the S. A. Gerasimov All-Russian University of Cinematography; he studied under the tutelage of directors Igor Savchenko and Alexander Dovzhenko.

Parajanov was a closeted bisexual In 1948, he was arrested and charged with illegal homosexual acts with MGB officer Nikolai Mikava in Tbilisi. He was sentenced to five years in prison and released under an amnesty after three months. In video interviews, friends and relatives contest the truthfulness of anything Parajanov was charged with; they believe his sentencing was procured through a kangaroo court due to his tendency for political retaliation and rebellious views. 

In 1950, Parajanov married Nigyar Kerimova, who came from a Muslim Tatar family, in Moscow. After Nigyar converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, she was murdered by her relatives, who disapproved of the marriage. Parajanov subsequently moved to Kiev, Ukraine, where he produced a few Russian and Ukrainian language documentaries (&quot;Dumka, Golden Hands, Natalia Uzhvy)&quot; and a handful of narrative films: &quot;Andriesh,&quot; &quot;The Top Guy, Ukrainian Rhapsody, and&quot; &quot;Flower on the Stone&quot;. He became fluent in Ukrainian and married Svitlana Ivanivna Shcherbatiuk (1938–2020) in 1956. She gave birth to his son Suran (d. 2021) in 1958

In a 1988 interview, he stated, &quot;Everyone knows that I have three motherlands. I was born in Georgia, worked in Ukraine and I&#x27;m going to die in Armenia.&quot;

=== Break from Socialist Realism ===
Andrey Tarkovsky&#x27;s first film, &quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot;, had an enormous impact on Parajanov&#x27;s self-discovery as a filmmaker. Later the influence became mutual, and he and Tarkovsky became close friends. Another influence was Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini, whom Parajanov would later describe as &quot;like a God&quot; to him and a director of &quot;majestic style&quot;. In 1965 Parajanov abandoned socialist realism and directed the poetic &quot;Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors&quot;, his first film over which he had complete creative control. It won numerous international awards well received by the Soviet authorities, who praised the film for &quot;conveying the poetic quality and philosophical depth of Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky’s tale through the language of cinema,&quot; and called it &quot;a brilliant creative success of the Dovzhenko film studio.&quot; Authorities allowed the release the film with its original Ukrainian soundtrack intact, rather than redub the dialogue into Russian for Soviet-wide release, in order to preserve its Ukrainian integrity. (Russian dubbing was standard practice at that time for non-Russian Soviet films when they were distributed outside the republic of origin.)

In 1969, Parajanov moved to Armenia to work on his next film; this was the first time he had visited the country and instilled in him the influence to direct &quot;Sayat Nova&quot;. It was shot under relatively poor conditions and had a very small budget. Unlike &quot;Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors, Sayat Nova&quot; was not well received by Soviet authorities, who were quick to intervene and ban the film for its allegedly inflammatory content and lack of socialist realism. Parajanov re-edited the film and renamed it &quot;The Color of Pomegranates.&quot;

=== Imprisonment, career hiatus, and other artistic ambitions ===

Since the early 1960&#x27;s, Parajanov increasingly became the subject of attention by the KGB, for a variety of political activities related to his affinity towards Ukrainian nationalism. He was an active protester following the 1965–1966 Ukrainian purge. In 1969 a report by the Committee for State Security to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist party indicated their belief that Parajanov is a negative influence on his younger colleagues, as well as a key purveyor of ideologically harmful opinion. He was also deemed as someone with a desire to defect if he were to travel abroad. 

In December 1973, he was arrested in Kyiv, and was accused of homosexuality, sodomy, and propagation of pornography. He was sentenced to five years in a hard labour camp. Three days before Parajanov was due to be sentenced, his friend Andrei Tarkovsky wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, asserting that &quot;In the last ten years Sergei Parajanov has made only two films: &quot;Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors&quot; and &quot;The Colour of Pomegranates&quot;. They have influenced cinema first in Ukraine, second in this country as a whole, and third in the world at large. Artistically, there are few people in the entire world who could replace Paradanov. He is guilty – guilty of his solitude. We are guilty of not thinking of him daily and of failing to discover the significance of a master.&quot; An eclectic group of artists, actors, filmmakers and activists protested on behalf of Parajanov, calling for his immediate release. Among them were Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Leonid Gaidai, Eldar Ryazanov, Yves Saint Laurent, Marcello Mastroianni, Françoise Sagan, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Luis Buñuel, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Mikhail Vartanov, and Andrei Tarkovsky.

Parajanov served four years out of his five-year sentence, and later credited his early release to the efforts made by the French Surrealist poet and novelist Louis Aragon, Aragon&#x27;s wife Elsa Triolet, and the American writer John Updike. His early release was authorized by Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, presumably as a result of Brezhnev&#x27;s meeting with Aragon and Triolet at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. When asked by Brezhnev if he could be of any assistance, Aragon requested the release of Parajanov, which was finalized by December 1977.

While he was incarcerated, Parajanov produced a large number of miniature doll-like sculptures (some of which were lost) and some 800 drawings and collages, many of which were later displayed in Yerevan at the Sergei Parajanov Museum, where they are now permanently located. His efforts in the camp were repeatedly compromised by prison guards, who deprived him of materials and called him mad, their cruelty only subsiding after a statement from Moscow admitting that &quot;the director is very talented.&quot; After his return from prison to Tbilisi, the close watch of the Soviet authorities prevented Parajanov from continuing his cinematic pursuits and compelled him towards other artistic outlets he had nurtured during his time in prison. He crafted extraordinarily intricate collages, created a large collection of abstract drawings and pursued numerous other avenues of non-cinematic art, sewing more dolls and some whimsical suits.

In February 1982 Parajanov was once again arrested on charges of bribery, which happened to coincide with his return to Moscow for the premiere of a play commemorating Vladimir Vysotsky at the Taganka Theatre, he was released in less than a year, with his health seriously weakened.

=== Short return to cinema ===
In 1985, the slow thaw within the Soviet Union spurred Parajanov to resume his passion for cinema. With the encouragement of various Georgian intellectuals, he directed the multi-award-winning film &quot;The Legend of Suram Fortress&quot;, along with Dodo Abashidze, based on a novella by Daniel Chonkadze. This was his first return to cinema since &quot;Sayat-Nova&quot; fifteen years earlier. 

In 1988, Parajanov and Abashidze directed &quot;Ashik Kerib&quot;, based on a story by Mikhail Lermontov. It is the story of a wandering minstrel, set in the Azerbaijani culture. Parajanov dedicated the film to his close friend Andrei Tarkovsky and &quot;to all the children of the world&quot;.

=== Death ===
Parajanov died of lung cancer in Yerevan, Armenia on July 20, 1990, aged 66. His final work, &quot;The Confession&quot;, was left unfinished. It survives in its original negative as &quot;&quot;, created by his close friend Mikhail Vartanov in 1992. Federico Fellini, Tonino Guerra, Francesco Rosi, Alberto Moravia, Giulietta Masina, Marcello Mastroianni and Bernardo Bertolucci were among those who publicly mourned his death. They sent a telegram to Russia with the following statement: &quot;The world of cinema has lost a magician. Parajanov’s fantasy will forever fascinate and bring joy to the people of the world…”.

== Legacy ==

Parajanov&#x27;s films are ranked among the greatest films of all time by &quot;Sight &amp; Sound.&quot; He won prizes at Mar del Plata Film Festival, Istanbul International Film Festival, Nika Awards, Rotterdam International Film Festival, Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival, São Paulo International Film Festival and others. A comprehensive retrospective in the UK took place in 2010 at BFI Southbank. The retrospective was curated by Layla Alexander-Garrett and the Parajanov specialist Elisabetta Fabrizi who commissioned a Parajanov inspired new commission in the BFI Gallery by the contemporary artist Matt Collishaw (&#x27;Retrospectre&#x27;). A symposium was dedicated to Parajanov&#x27;s work, bringing together experts to discuss and celebrate the director&#x27;s contribution to cinema and art.

Parajanov was highly appreciated by Andrei Tarkovsky himself in the biographical film &quot;Voyage in Time&quot; (&quot;Always with huge gratitude and pleasure I remember the films of Sergei Parajanov, which I love very much. His way of thinking, his paradoxical, poetical... ability to love beauty and the ability to be absolutely free within his own vision&quot;). In the same film Tarkovsky stated that Parajanov is one of his favorite filmmakers.

Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni stated that “The Color of Pomegranates by Parajanov, in my opinion one of the best contemporary film directors, strikes with its perfection of beauty.” Parajanov was also admired by the American filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. The French film director Jean-Luc Godard also stated that &quot;In the temple of cinema, there are images, light, and reality. Sergei Parajanov was the master of that temple&quot;.

Despite having many admirers of his art, his vision did not attract many followers. &quot;Whoever tries to imitate me is lost&quot;, he reportedly said. However, directors such as Theo Angelopoulos, Béla Tarr and Mohsen Makhmalbaf share Parajanov&#x27;s approach to film as a primarily visual medium rather than as a narrative tool.

The Parajanov-Vartanov Institute was established in Hollywood in 2010 to study, preserve and promote the artistic legacies of Sergei Parajanov and Mikhail Vartanov.

In 2024, marking the 100th anniversary of Parajanov&#x27;s birth, Ukrainian film maker Taras Tomenko made the documentary &quot;A Sentimental Journey to the Parajanov Planet&quot;. The film premiered internationally at the 40th Warsaw Film Festival where it won the 3rd place in the Audience Award for documentary films.

<text>was a Japanese physicist who was called &quot;the founding father of modern physics research in Japan&quot;. He led the efforts of Japan to develop an atomic bomb during World War II.

==Early life and career==
Nishina was born in Satoshō, Okayama. He received a silver watch from the emperor as he graduated at the top of his class at Tokyo Imperial University as an electrical engineer in 1918. He became a staff member at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (now RIKEN) where he began studying physics under Hantaro Nagaoka.

In 1921, he was sent to Europe for research. He visited some European universities and institutions, including Cavendish Laboratory, Georg August University of Göttingen, and University of Copenhagen. In Copenhagen, he did research with Niels Bohr, and they became good friends. In 1928, he wrote a paper on incoherent or Compton scattering with Oskar Klein in Copenhagen, from which the Klein–Nishina formula derives.

In 1929, he returned to Japan, where he endeavored to foster an environment for the study of quantum mechanics. He established Nishina Laboratory at RIKEN in 1931, and invited some Western scholars to Japan including Heisenberg, Dirac and Bohr to stimulate Japanese physicists. It was also in 1931 that he lectured about the Dirac theory in Kyoto, which was where he met and was attended by Hideki Yukawa and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga.

==Atomic bomb==
On 7 August 1945, Nishina led a team of scientists sent by the Japanese high command to confirm whether or not Hiroshima was attacked with an atomic bomb. After making the physical measurements necessary to confirm the bomb&#x27;s nature, he wired his confirmation of an atomic bomb back to Tokyo on August 8.

His laboratory was severely damaged during World War II, and most of its equipment had to be discarded and rebuilt after the war.

==Postwar==
The US Army occupation forces dismantled his cyclotrons on 22 November 1945, and parts were dumped into Tokyo Bay. The aftermath of the incident caused a huge furor in the US. Nishina later published an article on his reaction to the cyclotron&#x27;s destruction.

The American physicists Harry C. Kelly and Gerald Fox were recruited to the occupation forces. Fox stayed a few months in Japan, but Kelly stayed until 1950 and became friends with Nishina, who spoke English. At one point, the US Army formulated a list of Japanese scientists to purge, which included Nishina&#x27;s name. Asked to vet Nishina by US intelligence officers, Kelly took the file home and made his assessment: “He was an international scholar, respected all over the world. And he had spoken out against the war. I said it was against everyone&#x27;s interests to purge that man.&quot; Nishina sought to restart Japanese science after the war and found an ally in Kelly. Two issues were most important for Nishina: acquiring radio isotopes for research for a variety of nonmilitary purposes and attempting to preserve Riken as an institution for scientific research, which occupation forces were seeking to dismantle on the basis of anti-monopoly concerns. Riken owned stocks of some large companies. When an interim agreement was worked out, Nishina became head of the reorganized Riken.

Nishina died from liver cancer in 1951. Since Nishina&#x27;s widow was ailing herself, help with care of Nishina&#x27;s children (Yuichiro and Kojiro) came from Nishina&#x27;s assistant at Riken, Sumi Yokoyama. Harry Kelly, his friend and colleague, remained close to the family after Nishina&#x27;s death.

Kelly&#x27;s ashes were buried in a grave besides Nishina&#x27;s in Tama Cemetery in Tokyo in a ceremony attended by Nishina&#x27;s and Kelly&#x27;s families.

==Work==
Nishina co-authored the Klein–Nishina formula. His research was concerned with cosmic rays and particle accelerator development for which he constructed a few cyclotrons at RIKEN. In particular, he detected what turned out to be the muon in cosmic rays, independently of Anderson &quot;et al&quot;. He also discovered the uranium-237 isotope and pioneered the studies of symmetric fission phenomena occurring upon fast neutron irradiation of uranium (1939–1940), and narrowly missed out on the discovery of the first transuranic element, neptunium.

He was a principal investigator of RIKEN and mentored generations of physicists, including two Nobel Laureates: Hideki Yukawa and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. During World War II, he was the head of the Japanese nuclear weapon program.

<text>The Blohm &amp; Voss BV 222 &quot;Wiking&quot; (pronounced &quot;Veeking&quot;) was a large six-engined German flying boat designed and built by the German aircraft manufacturer Blohm &amp; Voss. It was the largest Axis flying boat to enter production and operation during the Second World War.

The BV 222 was originally developed during the late 1930s as a commercial venture to serve the transatlantic and other long distance routes of the German flag carrier Luft Hansa. It featured a relatively uninterrupted interior, free of bulkheads, and retractable floats; its use of diesel-powered engines made it easier to be refuelled at sea. By the time of its maiden flight on 7 September 1940, Nazi Germany was almost one year into the Second World War and the operation of long distance civil services was not realistic, thus development was reorientated towards military roles. On 10 July 1941, V1 undertook its first cargo transport mission with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;; further logistics use proceeded thereafter. Later that year, the first armed BV 222s were delivered. Production standard aircraft, designated BV 222C, did not emerge until 1943.

The BV 222 was operated by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, typically for logistical purposes, across numerous theatres, including the Norway, France, North Africa and even the Arctic. At one point, Nazi officials were considering establishing a long distance air route between Germany and Japan using modified BV 222s flying from Kirkenes in north Norway to Tokyo via Sakhalin Island, a distance of . After the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944, all of the remaining BV 222s were transferred to KG 200. At the end of the conflict, several BV 222s were reportedly captured and subsequently operated by both the United States and Britain. No BV 222s have been preserved.

==Development==
During the interwar period, the German flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa had built up a lucrative network of long range airmail routes, the longest of which included transatlantic ones. During the mid 1930s, the airline continued to hold a strong interest in the further development of its long distance routes; accordingly, Luft Hansa formulated a requirement for a new large flying boat to serve on its transatlantic routes. Specifics of this requirement included sufficient space to accommodate a minimum of 24 passengers. In response, the German aircraft manufacturer Hamburger Flugzeugbau decided to design a new larger flying boat, which was initially designated the Ha 222; the company&#x27;s design team was headed by Dr. Richard Vogt.

During September 1939, the company, which had changed its name to that of its parent company, Blohm &amp; Voss, received an initial order from Luft Hansa for three aircraft under the new designation of BV 222. Blohm &amp; Voss had been so confident that it would receive such an order that it had already elected to commence production of the first aircraft in January 1938, as well as to start work on two more aircraft later that same year.

On 7 September 1940, the first aircraft, designated V1, performed its maiden flight, carrying the civil registration D-ANTE. By this point, the Second World War had been waged for almost a whole year and Luft Hansa saw no prospect of operating a transatlantic route at a time of open hostilities, thus the airline had no immediate role for the BV 222 to perform. Accordingly, the flight test programme was adjusted to investigate the type&#x27;s potential for military applications; various minor modification, such as the addition of larger loading doors, were promptly made.

Initial trials found that the BV 222 had relatively stiff flight controls and that its hydrodynamic qualities could be improved; the former issue was largely attributed to friction and thus was readily addressed. Those same trials also demonstrated that the aircraft was capable of carrying up to 92 passengers, or 72 stretcher-bound patients, over a short distance at a maximum speed of . The flight characteristics were determined to be satisfactory, although some improvements were required. Further trials of the aircraft lasted until December 1940, at which point the V1 was transferred to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. It received a military paint scheme and the &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; individual alphabetic military aircraft registration code of &quot;CC+EQ&quot;, which was later changed to the alphanumeric &quot;Geschwaderkennung&quot; &quot;wing code&quot; designation of &quot;X4+AH&quot;, when in service with Lufttransportgruppe (See) 222.

Early aircraft were identified as V1 to V8. Production examples were designated C-09 to C-13. Up to two BV 222s could be assembled at a time at the company&#x27;s Steinwerder works outside Hamburg; each complete airframe took an average of 350,000 man hours to construct. At the height of production, personnel worked night and day, permitting a hull to be completed within as little as six weeks.

==Design==
The Blohm &amp; Voss BV 222 was a sizable six-engined flying boat. The interior volume of the hull was particularly spacious due to there being no partitioning bulkheads present above the floor level; the area between the keel and the cabin floor had close-pitched bulkheads instead. There were no heavy structural elements needed to carry stresses between the base of the hull and the wings. Access to the bilge was achieved via manholes. The planing bottom of the hull featured an unfaired and transverse main step. A further five smaller steps were present on the planing bottom, while the rear of the keel terminated in a deep knife-edge. To prevent the corrosion issues experienced with the first prototype, a specially-developed paint was applied to most BV 222s; unlike most flying boats, a high-quality surface finish was deemed to be unnecessary.

Typical amongst flying boats of the era, the BV 222 incorporated balance floats; unusually, these consisted of a matching pair of retracting float units per side, which extended from beneath the wing&#x27;s outer panels in a &quot;clamshell&quot; fashion when fully extended, and retracted into recesses within the underside of the wing. While not originally present, flutes were added to sides of the floats to improve their hydrodynamic properties. The structure of the wing comprised a welded tubular steel wing spar; the engines were also supported by this same spar. This spar was of a constant section up to the outermost engine, after which it tapered towards the wingtips. Both fuel and oil were housed in separate compartments within the wing spar. In response to feedback from formal evaluations, the outer wing structure was strengthened somewhat over that of the original design.

The majority of the flight control surfaces, save for segments of the elevators that were power-augmented, was manually actuated by the pilot. On production aircraft, an arrangement of torsion tubes, gears and quadrants were used instead of push-pull rods to actuate the control surfaces. The ailerons were divided into two sections, the inner of which being fitted with servo tabs. Under normal operational conditions, the inner and outer aileron sections would move and work together, however, the inner sections would be picked up by stops on the outer sections in situations where they became ineffective, such as during low speed flight or taxiing downwind. The elevator was split into three sections, the outer one being used only for trimming, the inner section was directly controlled by the pilot, while the centre section was operated by an autopilot; the latter function was considered particularly useful for reducing operator fatigue during long distance flights, but was switched off during the landing and takeoff phases of the flight. Instead of the conventional three trimming wheels, a tab box was designed for the aircraft; it was highly praised by pilots.

The BV 222 was originally powered by an arrangement of six Bramo 323 &quot;Fafnir&quot; radial engines. Later built aircraft were powered by six 746 kW (1,000 hp) Jumo 207C inline two-stroke opposed-piston diesel engines instead. The use of diesel fuel permitted refueling at sea by special re-supply U-boats. A single aircraft, C-13, was the only example to be fitted with Jumo 205C and later Jumo 205D engines.

==Operational history==
On 10 July 1941, V1 undertook its first cargo transport mission for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Up to 19 August 1941, V1 performed seven flights between Hamburg (Germany) and Kirkenes (Norway), transporting a total of of supplies and 221 wounded men, covering a distance of in total. After undergoing an overhaul at Hamburg, V1 was sent to Athens (Greece), from where it carried supplies for the Afrika Korps, making 17 flights between 16 October and 6 November 1941. At this time, V1 was unarmed, and thus received an escort by a pair of Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters.

Following these flights, V1 returned to Hamburg to have defensive armament fitted, comprising a 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 81 machine gun in the hull, two turret-mounted 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns, and four 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 81s in waist mounts. The registration was changed to X4+AH at the same time and V1 formed the basis for the new air transport squadron &quot;Lufttransportstaffel&quot; 222 (LTS 222). Between 1942 and 1943, the aircraft flew in the Mediterranean theatre, until it sank following a collision with a submerged wreck while landing at Piraeus harbour in mid-February 1943.

On 7 August 1941, V2 (CC+ER) made its first flight; following a period of extensive testing, it was assigned to LTS 222 on 10 August 1942 as X4+AB. Since the aircraft was intended for long-distance overwater flights, in addition to the armament fitted to V1, it received two rear-facing wing-mounted turrets with dual 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131s, which were accessed via the tubular wing spar. These wing-mounted turrets were not present on the majority of BV 222 after it was determined that they negatively impacted overall aerodynamic performance.

Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, plans were made to connect Germany and Japan by air using &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft modified for very long range flights since commercial flights to the Far East by Deutsche Luft Hansa were no longer possible, and it had become very dangerous for ships or U-boats to make the trip by sea. Field Marshal Erhard Milch authorized a study in to the feasibility of such direct flights and various routes were considered, including departing from German-occupied Russia and Bulgaria, and a sea route using a BV 222 flying from Kirkenes in north Norway to Tokyo via Sakhalin Island, a distance of . The BV 222 was one of three aircraft considered seriously for the program, along with the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 and the Heinkel He 177. The He 177 was ruled out due to it being considered unreliable and in 1943 the Junkers Ju 290 was selected for the flights.

On 28 November 1941, V3 (initially DM+SD) first flew, it was transferred to LTS 222 on 9 December 1941. After V1&#x27;s sinking, V3 returned to Hamburg where it was armed. It was destroyed along with V5 on 20 June 1943 at Biscarrosse by RAF de Havilland Mosquitos of No. 264 Squadron.

V4, which had an altered height tail, was also assigned to LTS 222 for Africa flights. V6 was shot down on 21 August 1942 on the Taranto (Italy) to Tripoli (Libya) route by a Bristol Beaufighter; V8 was shot down on the same route on 10 December 1942.

By late 1942, German officials had become increasingly interested in deploying the BV 222 as a long range maritime patrol aircraft and less as a transport. Accordingly, future refits commonly saw the addition of the FuG 200 Hohentwiel search radar, rear warning systems, and armament changes. Somewhat related to these changes was V7 (TB+QL), which made its first flight on 1 April 1943. In addition to the aforementioned changes, V7 was fitted with six 746 kW (1,000 hp) Jumo 207C inline two-stroke diesel engines. With a takeoff weight of and a range of . it was intended as the prototype BV 222C.

One BV 222, V4, is reported to have shot down a US Navy PB4Y-1 Liberator of VB-105 (BU#63917) on 22 October 1943. On occasion, this event has often been mistakenly construed as a BV 222 shooting down an Avro Lancaster.

A BV 222, believed to have been C-10, reportedly shot down southwest of Biscarrosse on the night of 8 February 1944 by an RAF Mosquito of No. 157 Squadron. During 1944, V2 participated in Operation Schatzgräber (&quot;Treasure Seeker&quot;), the code name of a German weather station at Alexandra Land in the Arctic, whose sick crew needed to be evacuated. The BV 222 dropped a spare wheel for a Fw 200 which had sustained damage during landing near the station.

Following the Invasion of Normandy in June 1944, the remaining BV 222s were transferred to KG 200. Of these, C-09 was probably the BV 222 reported to have been strafed and destroyed by RCAF Hawker Typhoon aircraft of No. 439 Squadron on 24 April 1945 at Seedorf. V7 and V4 were scuttled by their crews at Travemünde and Kiel-Holtenau airport respectively, at the end of the conflict.

===Postwar===
Three BV 222s were captured and subsequently operated by Allied forces: C-011, C-012 and C-013. C-012, which was captured at Sørreisa in Norway after the end of the conflict along with V2, was flown by Captain Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown from Norway to the RAF station at Calshot in 1946, the aircraft being assigned the RAF serial number &quot;VP501&quot;. After it was tested by the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe, it was assigned to No. 201 Squadron, which operated VP501 up to 1947, at which point the aircraft was scrapped.

At the end of the Second World War, both C-011 and C-013 had been captured by US forces at the end of the conflict. On 15 August and again on 20 August 1945, US Navy pilot Richard Schreder performed test flights, accompanied by a German flight crew, of one of these captured BV 222s. Across two flights, covering a total flight time of 38 minutes, no less than four engine fires were recorded. While many spare engines were available, they were of substandard quality due to the lack of quality alloys near the end of the conflict, and thus caught fire easily. Since the aircraft was not airworthy with these engines, the aircraft was taken out to open water and sunk by a US Navy destroyer.

Other reports indicate the US captured aircraft were flown or shipped to the US. Convair allegedly acquired one for evaluation at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, the intensive studies leading to the hull design of their &quot;Model 117&quot;, which in turn led to the R3Y Tradewind. Their subsequent fate is unknown.

The V2 aircraft briefly wore US markings in 1946. The V2 aircraft had identification markings from the original V5 aircraft for &quot;Operation Schatzgräber&quot;. V2 was later scuttled by the British who filled it with surplus waste from the base at Ilsvika to weigh it down. V2 was towed to a position in Trondheimsfjord between Ilsvika and Munkholmen, where it now rests on the seabed at deep, perfectly preserved due to low oxygen levels in the water. There were plans to raise and restore this aircraft. However, the plane was located in October 2023 by the firm Blueye Robotics, and they published video of the wreck. Signs now indicate nature is slowly breaking down the aircraft, and that coral can be seen growing on the plane. Historian Knut Sivertsen, advisor at Justismuseet in Trondheim stated in 2023 that the plane is probably too big to salvage, and there are no plans to do so at the present time.

<text>Kim Ellen Thomson (born 1964) is a British actress who has appeared on stage, television and film since the early 1980s in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Early life==
Thomson was born on 1964, although other sources have said in 1960 and 1964, in Scotland or Bath, Somerset, England to a Scottish father and Irish mother. Her parents split when she was three years old, and she was raised in Surrey by her father&#x27;s parents, who were originally from Alloa. At the age of six, she was sent to a boarding school for five years. Much later she went on record to say boarding schools should be abolished.

She trained as an actress at the Central School of Speech and Drama.

==Career==
Her most memorable role was that of Lesley Bainbridge in the BBC sitcom &quot;Brush Strokes&quot;, which at its peak, was watched by over 15 million people with the British tabloids avidly following the storyline. In the 1987 episode of the TV series &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; Thomson played the role of hotel maid Elly Somerton alongside Topol who starred as the lead character Professor Max Kelada.

Thomson shared her first lead in &quot;Stealing Heaven&quot; (1988) with Derek de Lint and Denholm Elliott. In its review, &quot;Films and filming&quot; said &quot;Kim Thomson&#x27;s Heloïse moves with delicate poise, a heroine worthy of Rossetti or Burne-Jones, with vivacity and intelligence.&quot; The next year, 1989, she played Estella in a film of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; directed by Kevin Connor, with Jean Simmons, who had played Estella in the 1946 film, as Miss Havisham. Also in 1989 she was Cordelia on stage in &quot;King Lear&quot;, directed by Jonathan Miller, with the &quot;British Theatre Yearbook&quot; commenting &quot;Kim Thomson&#x27;s Cordelia can rarely have been equalled; she was exquisite in beauty, tender in care, full of youthful integrity.&quot;
In 1991, she played Kitty Winter opposite Jeremy Brett in &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;: &quot;The Illustrious Client&quot;, and in 1992, Thomson was the leading lady of the TV series &quot;Virtual Murder&quot;, and in 1994, she played another leading role in a costume drama series, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;. Dozens more appearances in film and on television followed, often as a character actress, such as her role as a society reporter in &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; (2004).

In 1997, she took on the part of Lady Chiltern in &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, of which the &quot;Theatre Record&quot; said &quot;Others have played this pure, cool, idealistic, demanding role with more authority and finesse, but she is simply right for it&quot;. In 2001, she was Irina in a new West End theatre production of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; directed by Peter Gill.

During 2008, Thomson had a recurring role in ITV&#x27;s detective show &quot;The Bill&quot;, as barrister Naomi Woods, wife of DC Jacob Banks.

In March 2009, she became a regular cast member of the ITV1 soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, playing the role of Faye Lamb. At the end of 2009, she signed a new contract with the show. In January 2011, it was reported that she was leaving the show and would make her on-screen departure later in the year.

==Personal life==
In 2010, Thomson graduated from the University of London with a degree in politics, philosophy and history.

<text>The Sahelian kingdoms were a series of centralized kingdoms or empires that were centered on the Sahel, the area of grasslands south of the Sahara, from the 8th century to the 19th. The wealth of the states came from controlling the trade routes across the desert. Their power came from having large pack animals like camels and horses that were fast enough to keep a large empire under central control and were also useful in such kind of battle. All of these empires were also quite decentralized with member cities having a great deal of autonomy.

The Sahel states were limited from expanding south into the forest zone of the Bono and Yoruba as mounted warriors were all but useless in the forests and the horses and camels could not survive the diseases of the region.

==Economy==

There were integrated kingdoms and empires, with substantial cities and significant towns; and less organised territories with large scattered populations. People practised agriculture, stock-rearing, hunting, fishing, and crafts (metalworking, textiles, ceramics). They navigated along rivers and across lakes, traded over short and long distances, and used their own currencies.

==History of Sahel kingdoms==

*The first major state to rise in this region was the Ghana Empire. Established in c. the 3rd century, it was centered in what is today Senegal and Mauritania. Ghana grew wealthy through the trans-Saharan trade routes linking Aoudaghost with Tahert and Sijilmasa in north Africa following the introduction of the camel to the western Sahel in the 3rd century AD. Ghana was the first to benefit from the introduction of pack animals by Wolof traders. Ghana dominated the region between the 3rd century and the 13th century. Smaller states in the region at this time included Takrur to the west, the Malinke kingdom of Mali to the south, and the Songhai centred on Gao to the east.
*When Ghana collapsed in the face of invasion from the Almoravids and conquest by the Sosso Empire; after 1235, the Mali Empire rose to dominate the region, which traded with Bono state at the far south. Located on the Niger River to the west of Ghana in what is today Niger and Mali, it reached its peak in the 1350s, but had lost control of a number of vassal states by 1400.
*The most powerful of these states was the Songhai Empire, which expanded rapidly beginning with king Sonni Ali in the 1460s. By 1500, it had risen to stretch from Cameroon to the Maghreb, the largest state in African history. Its territory diminished to cover only the Dendi province in 1591 as a result of the invasion by the Saadi Dynasty of Morocco. The empire collapsed in 1901 when the French deposed the last askia.
*Far to the east, on Lake Chad, the state of Kanem-Bornu, founded as Kanem in the 9th century, now rose to greater preeminence in the central Sahel region. To their west, the loosely united Hausa city-states became dominant. These two states coexisted uneasily, but were quite stable.
*In 1810, the Sokoto Caliphate rose and conquered the Hausa, creating a more centralized state. It and Kanem-Bornu would continue to exist.

<text>Russell McWhortor Cunningham (August 25, 1855 – June 6, 1921) was an American Democratic politician who was the acting Governor of Alabama from April 25, 1904, to March 5, 1905. He was lieutenant governor when Governor William D. Jelks fell ill and left the state for treatment, and since the Alabama Constitution requires that if the governor leave the state for more than 20 days, the lieutenant governor must act as governor until their return.

Although he was de jure only an interim chief of the state administration, because he served as Acting Governor for nearly a year, he is regarded as one of the Alabama Governor by the state government, and his portrait hanging along other Governor&#x27;s portrait, as well as he figured on official state site alongside them. Cunningham is buried in Elmwood Cemetery.

Cunningham served in the Alabama House of Representatives 1880–1881. In 1896–1900, he served in the Alabama State Senate and was president of the senate. He also served in the Alabama Constitutional Convention of 1901.

<doc id="841551" wikidata="Q3819409" url="?curid=841551" title="Invasion of the Bee Girls">
<text>Invasion of the Bee Girls (re-released in 1981 as Graveyard Tramps) is a 1973 American science fiction film. The first film venture for writer Nicholas Meyer, it was directed by Denis Sanders and stars William Smith, Anitra Ford and Victoria Vetri.

The premise of the movie is that a mad scientist (Ford) is using radiation-mutated bee serum to create an army of female beauties who seduce men to death.
One by one, the male victims are killed before the local police catch on to the plans of the infected females. The script was altered while Meyer was visiting his parents. When he saw the new script, he wanted to take his name off of the project, but was convinced by his manager that he needed a credit.

==Plot==
Neil Agar, a special agent with the State Department&#x27;s Office of Security (the predecessor of the Diplomatic Security Service), is dispatched to Peckham, California to investigate the death of John Grubowsky, a bacteriologist working at the government-sponsored Brandt Research. Quickly making the acquaintance of the laboratory&#x27;s head librarian, Julie Zorn, he begins interviewing the firm&#x27;s leading scientists, many of whom have reputations as sexual players. His investigation is soon complicated by a growing number of deaths, all men who died of congestive heart failure caused by sexual exhaustion.

Faced with a rapidly escalating body count, the local sheriff, Captain Peters, holds a town meeting at which the laboratory&#x27;s leading sex researcher, Henry Murger, urges the town populace to practice sexual abstinence – an idea greeted with derision by the locals. Neil and Julie arrange a meeting with Murger afterwards to discuss his theories as to the cause of his deaths, only to see him chased down and run over by a car with an unseen driver. While Agar is telephoning the agency, Julie is attacked and sexually assaulted by a group of local thugs, who are then beaten up by Agar on his return. During his investigation of Murger&#x27;s home in search of clues, Neil discovers a secret room concealing sexual paraphernalia and Murger&#x27;s gay lover, Joe, who informs Neil that he saw Murger driving off with an unknown woman prior to his death.

Despite a curfew and the establishment of a military quarantine, the scientists continue playing their sex games. One of them, Herb Kline, is approached by Susan Harris, a beautiful entomologist working on bees. Though described by the men as an &quot;iceberg&quot;, she flirts with Kline and invites him over for dinner. That night, as they engage in sex, Kline suffers a fatal thrombosis and Harris reveals black compound eyes, suggesting that she is more than she seems to be.

Meanwhile, convinced there is a similar pattern at work, Neil begins studying the sexual patterns of insects. Seeking information about the mating habits of honey bees, he interrogates Dr. Harris at her lab; when he departs, she resumes her project – the transformation of Kline&#x27;s wife Nora into a Bee Girl through a process of controlled mutation. With the aid of other previously mutated women, she cocoons Nora and places her in a chamber where she is swarmed by mutated honey bees; when she emerges, she is bombarded with radiation and awakens with the same black compound eyes and drive to mate that the other transformed women possess. The next morning, Herb Kline&#x27;s body is discovered; when Captain Peters goes to inform Nora, she attempts unsuccessfully to seduce him.

Having worked out much of what has taken place, Neil summons the remaining department chairs and presents his theory. Though the geneticist, Stan Williams, scorns the idea, the head of the diagnostics department, Aldo Ferrara, is more receptive. At Grubowsky&#x27;s funeral, Neil and Julie bring a radiation detector, which picks up the gamma radiation coming from the women in attendance who have been subjected to the treatment. Aware that they have been detected, the transformed women move to eliminate the remaining scientists; Williams is nearly killed by his now-mutated wife and Ferrara dies during a visit by Dr. Harris, who then lures Julie to her lab to be transformed.

When Neil discovers Ferrara&#x27;s body, he realizes what the women are up to. Racing to the lab, he interrupts the women as they begin the process of turning Julie into one of them. With Harris threatening to kill Julie unless he leaves, he moves to depart, but pulls out a revolver instead and shoots the machinery. Neil then rescues Julie and bars the door, leaving the mutated women to die amidst a cascade of exploding machinery.

<doc id="841554" wikidata="Q1055100" url="?curid=841554" title="Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center">
<text>The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, also called the Udvar-Hazy Center, is the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (NASM)&#x27;s annex at Dulles International Airport in the Chantilly area of Fairfax County, Virginia. It holds numerous exhibits, including the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, and the Boeing 367-80, the main prototype for the popular Boeing 707 airliner.

The facility was made possible by a $65 million donation in October 1999 to the Smithsonian Institution by Steven F. Udvar-Házy, an immigrant from Hungary and co-founder of the International Lease Finance Corporation, an aircraft leasing corporation. The main NASM building, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., had always contained more artifacts than could be displayed, and most of the collection had been stored, unavailable to visitors, at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland. A substantial addition to the center encompassing restoration, conservation and collection-storage facilities was completed in 2010. Restoration facilities and museum archives were moved from the museum&#x27;s Garber facility to the new sections of the Udvar-Hazy Center.

==Architecture and facilities==

Designed by Hellmuth, Obata, and Kassabaum, who also designed the National Air and Space Museum building, the Center required 15 years of preparation and was built by Hensel Phelps Construction Co. The exhibition areas comprise two large hangars, the Boeing Aviation Hangar and the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar. The Donald D. Engen Observation Tower provides a view of landing operations at adjacent Washington Dulles International Airport. The museum also contains an IMAX theater. A taxiway connects the museum to the airport.

An expansion of the Udvar-Hazy Center is dedicated to the behind-the-scenes care of the Smithsonian&#x27;s collection of aircraft, spacecraft, related artifacts and archival materials. On December 2, 2008, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center received a gift of $6 million for phase two from Airbus Americas Inc. — the largest corporate gift to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.

The wing includes:

* The Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar — spacious enough to accommodate several aircraft at one time with a second-floor viewing area designed to give visitors a behind-the-scenes look.
* Archives — the foremost collection of documentary records of the history, science and technology of aeronautics and space flight will be housed in a single location for the first time, providing researchers with ample space and equipment.
* The Emil Buehler Conservation Laboratory — provides conservators much-needed space to develop and execute specialized preservation strategies for artifacts.
* Collections processing unit — a dedicated loading dock and specially designed secure area for initial inspection and analysis of artifacts.

A further expansion of the collections center was approved in December 2016. The addition will be made up of three additional storage modules on the south side of the building.

==Collection==

The center was opened on December 15, 2003. The Udvar-Hazy Center displays historic aviation and space artifacts, especially items too large for the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s building on the National Mall, including:
* The &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan

<text>Lieutenant General Henry Gordon Bennett, (15 April 1887 – 1 August 1962) was a senior Australian Army officer who served in both World War I and World War II. Despite highly decorated achievements during World War I, during which he commanded at both battalion and brigade level and became the youngest general in the Australian Army, Bennett is best remembered for his role during the fall of Singapore in February 1942. As commander of the 8th Australian Division, he escaped while his men became prisoners of the Imperial Japanese Army. After this, Bennett&#x27;s military career waned and, although he rose to command a corps, he never again commanded troops in battle. In 1945, his escape caused controversy and resulted in a Royal Commission and military enquiry. Both found that he had been unjustified in relinquishing his command.

A citizen soldier, before World War I Bennett had worked in the insurance industry and at the conclusion of hostilities pursued his commercial interests while continuing to serve in the military in a part-time capacity, commanding at brigade and divisional level. He retired from the Army after World War II and turned to farming in the Hills District northwest of Sydney. He remained active in the world of business and as a military commentator, before dying in 1962 at the age of 75

==Early life==
Bennett (who was always known as Gordon) was born in Balwyn, Melbourne, on 15 April 1887, to George Bennett, a South African-born school teacher, and his Australian-born wife, Harriet. He was the sixth of nine children and attended Balwyn State School, where his father taught, and then Hawthorn College as a teenager having been given a three-year scholarship. While at Hawthorn, he did well at mathematics and in 1903, as a 16-year-old, after completing a competitive examination he was accepted into the AMP Society to train as an actuary. In May 1908, just after he turned 21, Bennett volunteered to serve in the Militia, Australia&#x27;s reserve military force, joining the 5th Australian Infantry Regiment as a &quot;recruit officer&quot;. After completing a six-month part-time course, he was appointed as a provisional second lieutenant, and posted to the regiment&#x27;s &#x27;B&#x27; Company, in Carlton, Victoria. He continued to work at AMP during this time, but devoted most of his spare time to his military duties and rose in rank quickly, reaching major in 1912, at the age of 25, when he became adjutant of his regiment.

At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Bennett volunteered to serve with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and, after securing his release from AMP on full pay, was appointed second-in-command of the 6th Battalion, which was part of the 2nd (Victorian) Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 1st Division. After a short period of training, the 1st Division began to embark for Europe. Just prior to his departure overseas, Bennett became engaged to Bess Agnes Buchanan, whom he had met at a dance in Canterbury. As an engagement gift, Bess bought her betrothed a miniature photo of herself, set in a gold frame. Bennett carried the picture in his jacket pocket while serving overseas and it later saved his life on the Western Front, deflecting a German bullet.

==Gallipoli==
While in transit, as a result of overcrowding in training camps in the United Kingdom, the 1st Division was diverted to Egypt with the intention that it would complete its training there before moving to the Western Front at a later date. The decision by the Allies to force a passage through the Dardanelles interrupted this process, as the 1st Division was allocated to take part in the Gallipoli Campaign. During the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, Bennett fought on the southern flank of the Anzac beachhead. He led 300 men of his battalion to an advanced position on Pine Ridge, south of Lone Pine. While directing the defence of this position, Bennett was wounded in the shoulder and wrist and forced to retire to the beach for treatment. When the Turkish forces counter-attacked in the evening, the 6th Battalion force on Pine Ridge was isolated and killed to the last man, including Bennett&#x27;s younger brother, Godfrey. Instead of accepting evacuation on a hospital ship, after having his wounds treated, Bennett returned to his battalion.

In early May, the 2nd Brigade was selected to move to Cape Helles to reinforce the British forces for the Second Battle of Krithia. After being transferred by boat, on 8 May, Bennett advanced with his battalion in impossible conditions. Bennett was the only officer of the 6th, and one of few in the 2nd Brigade, to survive the advance unscathed, although he was lucky do so; as he led the charge, a Turkish bullet hit the ammunition pouch he wore, exploding the ammunition in it. He was knocked off his feet, but otherwise unharmed. With a handful of men, he achieved the furthest advance of the attack. He became commander of the 6th Battalion the next day. The battalion was then returned to Anzac by a trawler, and shortly afterwards, Bennett&#x27;s command of the battalion was confirmed and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.

Throughout June and July, Bennett&#x27;s battalion occupied the front line during a period of reduced tempo fighting as a stalemate developed. On 7 August, when the Allies launched their August Offensive to break the stalemate, the 6th Battalion was involved in one of the supporting attacks at the start of the Battle of Sari Bair. While the best known attack was made by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at the Nek, the 6th was required to make a similar attack against a neighbouring Turkish position known as German Officers&#x27; Trench from which machine guns enfiladed the Australian positions as far north as the Nek. Two attempts to capture the trench failed. A third attempt was organised and Bennett resolved to lead it himself but the commander of the 1st Division, Major General Harold Walker, after consulting with the corps commander, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, agreed to abandon the attack. The 6th Battalion&#x27;s losses totalled 80 killed and 66 wounded.

Following the attack on the German Officers&#x27; Trench, Bennett&#x27;s battalion was withdrawn from the front line briefly, before relieving the 1st Brigade, which had successfully captured Lone Pine. The August Offensive failed and a further lull in the fighting occurred. The following month, as reinforcements in the shape of the 2nd Division arrived at Anzac, the original Australian units were relieved on a rotational basis, including the 6th Battalion, which was sent back to Lemnos. While there, Bennett was hospitalised with paratyphoid and during his stay in hospital, he received word that he had been appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). When the 6th Battalion was returned to Gallipoli, Bennett sought to return with them, but was ordered to sail to England aboard the transport &quot;Aquitania&quot; for further treatment. As well as his CMG, Bennett was also mentioned in despatches twice for his service at Gallipoli.

==Western Front==

Bennett spent Christmas in Southampton, before returning to Egypt early in January 1916. There, he rejoined his battalion, which was stationed around Gebel Habeita, defending the Suez Canal. He arrived just as the AIF began a period of reorganisation and expansion, which saw the experienced units of the 1st Division being split to provide cadres to the newly formed 5th Division; as a part of this, the 6th Battalion was split to help form the 58th Battalion in late February.

In March 1916, the 1st Division moved to France as part of the transfer of the AIF&#x27;s infantry formations to the Western Front. Bennett subsequently led the 6th Battalion through the Battle of Pozières. After the 1st and 3rd Brigades had captured the town on 24 July 1916, the 6th and 8th Battalions of the 2nd Brigade moved in to occupy the ruins where they had to endure a prolonged artillery bombardment. Bennett&#x27;s battalion headquarters was in a log hut. The hut received six direct hits from shells but survived due to the debris that had accumulated around it. Shortly after Bennett relocated his HQ the hut was finally demolished. On 26 July Bennett protested at the conditions his men had to endure, reporting: &quot;My men are being unmercifully shelled. They cannot hold out if an attack is launched. The firing line and my headquarters are being plastered with heavy guns and the town is being swept by shrapnel. I myself am O.K. but the front line is being buried.&quot; In the capture of Pozières, Bennett&#x27;s 6th Battalion suffered 190 casualties, the least by a considerable margin of the 12 battalions in the 1st Division.

After this, Bennett continued to serve as the commanding officer of the 6th Battalion, as well as acting as the 3rd Brigade commander. In mid-November, Bennett took a brief leave in London, where he was reunited with his fiancée, Bess, who had sailed from Melbourne with her father to meet him. On 16 November, they were married in Chelsea, and after a short honeymoon in Scotland, Bennett returned to the front. On 3 December 1916, he was given command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade and promoted to brigadier general, becoming at 29 the youngest general in the Australian Army. He commanded the brigade for the remainder of the war on the Western Front, leading the brigade through several notable actions, including at Bullecourt, Menin Road, and Passchendaele during 1917, and several actions against the Hindenburg Line in 1918. While Bennett was serving at the front, his wife remained in England; he returned to her briefly in November 1917 and again in July 1918. Just after the war ended, Bess returned to Australia with the couple&#x27;s 10-month-old daughter, while Bennett remained in Europe until June 1919, briefly touring the Rhine and then viewing the London victory parade, where he escorted Lady Birdwood while her husband, Lord Birdwood, the former commander of the Australian Corps, marched.

For his service on the Western Front, Bennett received many awards. He received the Order of Danilo from Montenegro in 1917, was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1918, received a Distinguished Service Order in 1919 and mentioned in despatches a further six times. His attitude towards regular officers and temperament, as well as his tendency to act without clearing his actions with superiors, though, resulted in criticism from senior officers.

==Between the wars==
Upon his return to Australia, Bennett lived at Canterbury with his wife and daughter, while he sought to return to civilian life after his appointment to the AIF was terminated. He was offered his old position at AMP back, having been on full-time leave with pay while serving overseas, but was unhappy with this. He was eventually offered a position in the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney and he moved there with his family. Later, he purchased a textile factory and worked as a clothing manufacturer and public accountant before being appointed chairman of the New South Wales Repatriation Board in 1922, in which role he was able to help returned soldiers. In 1928, he was appointed as an administrator of the City of Sydney, along with two other commissioners. He was president of the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales between 1931 and 1933 and the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia between 1933 and 1934, and was involved in several conservative political groups such as the All for Australia League and the Defence of Australia League.

Bennett remained active in the military, continuing to serve as part of the Militia, which was reorganised in 1921 following the conclusion of the demobilisation process. From then until 1926, he served as commander of the 9th Infantry Brigade, before being appointed to command the 2nd Division. In 1930, he was promoted to the rank of major general and over the ensuing years became increasingly parochial against the small permanent Staff Corps. He was transferred to the unattached list in 1932. In 1937, amidst increasing tensions in Europe, he came into conflict with the Military Board after he wrote a number of newspaper articles expressing his concerns about complacent defence policy and the efficiency of regular officers.

==World War II==
When World War II broke out in September 1939, although only 52, Bennett was passed over for command of the Second Australian Imperial Force, the position going to General Thomas Blamey. The Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Brudenell White, seems to have been opposed to Bennett being given an active command. In the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot; (ADB), A. B. Lodge, Bennett&#x27;s biographer, commented: &quot;Because of his temperament, he was considered unsuitable for a semi-diplomatic command, and one that involved subordination to British generals. Bennett was as scathing of British officers as he was of Australian regulars.&quot;

Instead, Bennett was given a command in the Volunteer Defence Corps, the Australian version of the British Home Guard. In July 1940, he took over command of the Eastern Command Training Depot. After White&#x27;s death in the Canberra air disaster in August 1940, Bennett was appointed commander of the newly formed 8th Division, replacing Vernon Sturdee, who was promoted to White&#x27;s former role.

In February 1941, the 8th Division&#x27;s headquarters, along with one of its brigades – the 22nd – was posted to Malaya after a request from the British for Australia to contribute troops to bolster the garrison there, amid growing concerns of war with the Japanese, and as part of the plans that had been formulated as the pre-war Singapore strategy. The 27th Brigade was also dispatched in August, but the division&#x27;s third brigade, the 23rd Brigade remained in Australia. Relations between Bennett and his superiors, and also his subordinate brigade commander, Brigadier Harold Taylor, were not good. Lodge commented: &quot;Bennett&#x27;s dealings with British senior officers, especially with the general officer commanding, Malaya, Lieutenant General A.E. Percival, were devoid of harmony.&quot;

In December 1941, the Japanese invasion of Malaya began. Bennett found himself in command of an ad hoc force known as &quot;Westforce&quot;, which included the Australian 27th Brigade – but not the 22nd, which had been transferred to III Indian Corps – and several Indian units. Bennett&#x27;s command was not engaged in the early stages of the fighting because the initial Japanese attacks fell on British and Indian units around Kota Bharu and the Thai–Malay border. However, as the Japanese pushed the defenders back and advanced into Johore, the Australians fought several actions throughout January. The most significant of those came around Gemas and Muar, in which the Australians experienced some local success before being forced to withdraw to Singapore at the end of the month, along with the rest of the Allied forces.

On Singapore, Bennett&#x27;s command once again included the two Australian brigades – the 22nd and 27th – which were allocated the task of defending the north-western sector of the island. On 8 February 1942, the Japanese launched an assault across the Johore Strait, concentrating upon the sector held by Bennett&#x27;s troops. The weight fell on the 22nd Brigade&#x27;s area and, trying to fend off two Japanese divisions, they were eventually forced to withdraw towards the centre of the island. The 27th Brigade initially managed to hold its sector, but it was subjected to a follow-up assault on 10 February and, as the 22nd fell back, it was also forced to withdraw. Heavy fighting followed over the next week, but eventually the Allied troops were pushed across the island to Singapore&#x27;s urban areas.

On 15 February, Percival began surrender negotiations with the Japanese. That night, Bennett decided that it was his duty to escape from Singapore rather than surrender. Consequently, he handed over command of the 8th Division to Brigadier Cecil Callaghan and, with a few junior officers and some local Europeans, Bennett commandeered a sampan and crossed the Strait of Malacca to the east coast of Sumatra. There, they transferred to a launch in which they sailed up the Batang Hari River, eventually proceeding by car to Padang, on the west coast of Sumatra. From there, Bennett flew to Java and then to Australia, arriving in Melbourne on 2 March 1942.

The fall of Singapore – the largest capitulation in British military history – shocked Australians, resulting in the capture of almost 15,000 Australians and many more Indian and British soldiers. Nevertheless, Bennett&#x27;s escape was initially regarded as praiseworthy, at least publicly. Prime Minister John Curtin issued a statement that read:

However, within the military, particularly its senior echelons, Bennett was criticised for leaving his troops. In April 1942, he was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of III Corps in Perth. At the time, it was an important post but, by 1943, as the possibility of a Japanese invasion of Australia faded, it became a backwater. Bennett was told by Blamey that he would not be given another active command, and Bennett was transferred to the Reserve of Officers in May 1944. He soon published his account of the Malayan campaign, &quot;Why Singapore Fell&quot;, which was critical of Percival and other British officers, although his opinions were later challenged by several Australian officers, including Callaghan. Blamey unsuccessfully tried to prevent the book&#x27;s publication.

Upon retirement from active service, Bennett began writing for a Sydney newspaper and was a correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He remained concerned about his soldiers, though, and met the first group of recently freed 8th Division prisoners of war when they arrived in Sydney on the transport &quot;Manunda&quot;. For their part, the majority of his former soldiers welcomed him, and some even hung a sign over the side of the ship, which read: &quot;We want Bennett&quot;. They later put it in his car as a gesture of their support.

==Postwar inquiries==
The controversy over Bennett&#x27;s actions became public in mid-1945, when the war ended and Percival and Callaghan were released from Japanese captivity. Percival, who had never got on with Bennett, wrote a letter accusing him of relinquishing his command without permission. Callaghan delivered the letter to Blamey upon his release and Blamey convened a court of enquiry under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, and Major Generals Victor Stantke and George Wootten, which found that Bennett was not justified in handing over his command, or in leaving Singapore. Veterans of the 8th Division, who were generally loyal to Bennett, protested against this finding.

In November 1945, Prime Minister Ben Chifley appointed a Royal Commission under Justice G. C. Ligertwood. The Commission concluded that Bennett had disobeyed Percival&#x27;s order to surrender. Lodge wrote:

In 1948, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Fry, a military lawyer, published the opinion: &quot;The Royal Commissioner based his report on an interpretation of international law, and did not discuss General Bennett&#x27;s action from the standpoint of Australian military law, which placed him under no inflexible obligation to remain on Singapore Island.&quot;

==Post military and retirement==
Bennett later became an orchardist, purchasing a property and living at Glenorie in the Hills district on Sydney&#x27;s North Western fringe, until 1955 when, due to deteriorating health following a coronary occlusion, he sold his orchard and moved to Dural, New South Wales. He travelled to Singapore in 1957 with his wife to attend the opening of the Kranji War Memorial and then in 1960, travelled to Japan to meet with officers who had fought in Malaya. He wrote a number of articles on military topics and served on the board of a number of companies. From 1960 to 1962, he was Chairman of Directors of MMI Insurance. He died on 1 August 1962 at Dural, survived by his wife and daughter. After a state funeral at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, his body was cremated. The diary that Bennett kept while serving in Malaya is held at the State Library of New South Wales.

<text>James Leslie Tuck (9 January 1910 – 15 December 1980) was a British physicist, working on the applications of explosives as part of the British delegation to Manhattan Project.

Tuck was born in Manchester, England, and educated at the Victoria University of Manchester. Because of his involvement with the Manhattan Project, he was unable to submit his thesis on time and never received his doctoral degree.

In 1937 he was offered an appointment as a Salter Research Fellow at Oxford University, where he worked with Leó Szilárd on particle accelerators. In 1937 he married Elsie Harper, with whom he would later adopt two children.

At the outbreak of World War II, he was appointed as the scientific advisor to Frederick Alexander Lindemann, who was on the private staff of Winston Churchill. His research included work on shaped charges, used in anti-tank weapons. For this work in 1944 he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

==Bomb work==
His expertise on shaped charges led to his being sent to Los Alamos, where he was a member of the British delegation to the Manhattan Project and helped in the development of explosive lensing and the Urchin initiator. This work was crucial to the success of the plutonium atomic bomb.

In 1946, Tuck took part in the Operation Crossroads atomic tests on Bikini Atoll. At this time, Tuck was informed that he had missed his extended deadline to complete his PhD with the Victoria University of Manchester.

He then returned to Oxford, where he worked at the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University. However, he found the postwar conditions there difficult and in 1949 returned to the United States, assuming a position at the University of Chicago. A year later, he returned to Los Alamos when he was invited to work on thermonuclear research.

==Fusion power==
At Los Alamos, Tuck took up research on fusion power, which he had learned about in the UK. Tuck suggested that the Los Alamos group pursue a pinch program similar to the one being carried out in the UK. This was only months after Lyman Spitzer had started work on his stellarator design. Both were invited to Washington to present their ideas, where Spitzer won $50,000 in funding from the Atomic Energy Commission. Returning to Los Alamos, he arranged for a similar $50,000 from the lab&#x27;s discretionary budget and started a pinch project under the name Perhapsatron.

Like all pinch systems, Perhapsatron failed due to instabilities in the plasma. Theoretical work by Edward Teller and others suggested ways out of the instability problem, either pinching so quickly that fusion took place before the instabilities formed, or by using &quot;cusped&quot; magnetic fields. The former was developed as the Columbus while the latter became the picket fence reactor design, both led by Tuck&#x27;s teams.

He remained at Los Alamos until his retirement in 1972. Earlier in 1972 he had published a review in the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; of the book &quot;Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Frontiers of Public and Private Science&quot; by Solly Zuckerman.

After his retirement Tuck became a prominent public supporter of research into thermonuclear fusion for power generation.

== Ball lightning ==
From the late 1960s onwards Tuck took a keen interest in the phenomenon of ball lightning, probably because of the connection between plasmas and their role in fusion power schemes. In 1980 he appeared in the Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s Mysterious World episode &#x27;Clarke&#x27;s Cabinet of Curiosities&#x27; where he described his experiments at Los Alamos, carried out during lunch breaks, to create ball lightning using a large storage battery of the type then used in submarines.

== Later life ==
Tuck retired in 1973 and died in Los Alamos, New Mexico on 15 December 1980 following an extended illness.

<doc id="841567" wikidata="Q2861599" url="?curid=841567" title="Arky Vaughan">
<text>Joseph Floyd &quot;Arky&quot; Vaughan (March 9, 1912 – August 30, 1952) was an American professional baseball player. He played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball, between 1932 and 1948, for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Brooklyn Dodgers, primarily as a shortstop. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.

== Minor leagues ==
Born in Clifty, Arkansas, Vaughan got his nickname early in life, despite leaving Arkansas before his first birthday. He grew up in Fullerton, California.

Vaughan made his professional debut in 1931 at age 19 for the minor league Wichita Aviators of the Western League, where he hit .338 with 21 home runs. When the Aviators became affiliated with the Chicago Cubs after the season, Vaughan was acquired by the Tulsa Oilers, who were affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates. On April 7, 1932, Vaughan was acquired from the Oilers by the Pirates.

== Major league career ==
=== Pittsburgh Pirates ===
==== Rookie year ====
Vaughan began the 1932 season as the backup to the Pirates&#x27; starting shortstop, Tommy Thevenow. Through the first 13 games of the season, Vaughan appeared only twice, once as a late-game replacement for Thevenow and once as a pinch-hitter. However, Thevenow was still suffering the effects of a season-ending ankle injury he had suffered in 1931, which opened up the door for Vaughan to take over the job. When Thevenow returned at the end of May after missing a month, he found himself in a reserve role.

Vaughan, who was the youngest player in the National League in 1932, wound up playing 129 games overall that year, all but one at shortstop. He finished with a .318 batting average and 61 runs batted in (RBIs) in his rookie season. His defense was a bit shaky, though, as he led the league in errors with 46. His year was impressive enough to garner a modicum of support for Most Valuable Player, finishing 23rd in the voting.

==== Establishing himself ====
Vaughan solidified his position as the Pirates&#x27; starting shortstop in 1933. Improving on almost all of his offensive statistics, Vaughan played in 152 games, batting .314 with 97 RBI, seventh- and fifth-best in the NL respectively. He also led the league with 19 triples. He finished in the league top five in on-base percentage (.388, 3rd), slugging percentage (.478, 5th) and walks (64, 4th). Although he led the league in errors again with an identical 46 to the previous year, due to his increased playing time his fielding percentage improved a bit from .934 to .945. For the second straight year, he finished 23rd in the MVP voting.

Vaughan took his game up another notch in 1934. While finishing fourth in the race for the batting title at .333, he led the league in OBP at .431, helped by his league-leading walk total of 94. Although he dropped from fifth to sixth in slugging, the raw number improved to .511. His performance earned him a spot on the NL All-Star team, the first of what would be nine straight selections. His defense continued to improve as well, as his error total dropped to 41, no longer the most in the league, and his fielding percentage rose again to .951. For the third straight year, he finished 23rd in the MVP voting.

==== 1935 ====
In 1935, Vaughan had what is universally recognized as his best season. Vaughan not only posted career bests in the three Triple Crown categories, he led all of baseball with a .385 average, a .491 on-base percentage, and a 1.098 OPS. His 190 Adjusted OPS as of 2011 still ranks as one of the top 100 single-season scores of all time. His .607 slugging percentage led the NL, as did his 97 walks. His 19 home runs were eighth in the league, his only time in the top ten, and his 99 RBI were sixth. He also earned the first of his six starts in the All-Star Game. Defensively, he finished in the top half of the league in fielding percentage for the first time while finishing second in both putouts and assists.

Although he was third in National League MVP voting behind Gabby Hartnett and Dizzy Dean, he was named Player of the Year by The Sporting News. The season has been called the best ever by a shortstop other than Honus Wagner.

==== Remaining Pirates career ====
Over the next six seasons, Vaughan continued to be one of the best-hitting shortstops in the game, batting over .300 in every season, and regularly being at or near the top of the league in most offensive categories. By the time Vaughan reached the age of 25, he had accumulated 1,057 hits, the 18th highest total for a 25-year-old in MLB history. He also continued to improve defensively, as he led the league in total chances in 1938–39 while finishing in the top three in fielding percentage four times. He again finished third in the MVP voting in 1938, when the Pirates finished second and had their best record during his tenure with the team.

In 1940, Vaughan was appointed team captain by new manager Frankie Frisch. Although he led the league in runs scored and triples again, he slumped to a career-low .300 batting average. This prompted Frisch to replace Vaughan as starting shortstop with Alf Anderson to start the 1941 season. However, Anderson didn&#x27;t hit, and Vaughan was quickly back in the starting lineup. In the 1941 All-Star Game, Vaughan hit two home runs, but was upstaged by a ninth-inning, three-run homer by American Leaguer Ted Williams. Vaughan finished the year batting .316 in 106 games. That would be his last year with the Pirates who wouldn&#x27;t see a star as bright as Vaughan for almost two decades. The fans were outraged at his trade to Brooklyn and his mysterious death years later helped coin the phrase &quot;The Ghost of Arky&quot; when times got tough.

=== Brooklyn Dodgers ===

==== A new position ====
On December 12, 1941, after a decade as the Pirates&#x27; starting shortstop, Vaughan was traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers for Pete Coscarart, Luke Hamlin, Babe Phelps, and Jimmy Wasdell. It is believed that this trade was in part prompted due to bad feelings between Vaughan and Frisch. Since Pee Wee Reese was already at shortstop for the Dodgers, the plan was to move Vaughan to third base.

Vaughan&#x27;s tenure with the Dodgers got off to a rough start, as he failed to hit .300 for the first time in his career, finishing at .277 with just two home runs. He also established new lows in several other categories, including a career-worst .348 OBP. He still managed to make the All-Star team as the starter at third base, and actually finished third in the league in fielding percentage, but the season was a disappointment overall.

==== Clash of personalities ====
With Reese drafted into World War II, Vaughan was moved back to shortstop in 1943. He rebounded on offense, raising his average over .300 once again at .305 and leading the league in runs scored and, for the first and only time, stolen bases with 20.

However, the season was marred by an incident that would nearly lead to the end of Vaughan&#x27;s career. On July 10, temperamental manager Leo Durocher suspended pitcher Bobo Newsom for insubordination after Newsom complained about catcher Bobby Bragan dropping a third strike. According to teammate Billy Herman, after reading Durocher&#x27;s comments about Newsom in the press, Vaughan went into the manager&#x27;s office, took off his uniform, and &quot;threw it in Durocher&#x27;s face&quot;. After the season, Vaughan left the team, retiring to his ranch. He went on to sit out the next three years.

==== Comeback ====
After Durocher was suspended before the 1947 season, Vaughan decided to try a comeback. Serving as something of a utility player, Vaughan played in 64 games and batted .325. He played in his only World Series that season, which the Dodgers lost to the New York Yankees. Vaughan appeared in three games in the 1947 World Series, all as a pinch hitter, reaching base twice on a walk and a double.

Even with Durocher&#x27;s suspension over, Vaughan returned to the Dodgers in a similar capacity in 1948. However, after batting a career-low .244 in 65 games, he was released at the end of the season. He played the 1949 season with Pacific Coast League&#x27;s San Francisco Seals before retiring for good.

=== Legacy ===
Vaughan retired with 1,173 runs scored, 96 home runs, 926 RBI, 118 steals, a .318 batting average.406 on-base percentage and .453 slugging percentage. As of 2019, his .385 batting average, .491 OBP, and 1.098 OPS in 1935 are all Pittsburgh team records, and the batting average is a 20th-century record for National League shortstops. Vaughan is the 26th greatest non-pitcher in major league history, according to win shares. He hit for the cycle twice in his career as a member of the Pirates. In 14 seasons, he hit .300 or better 12 times, only missing the mark in 1942 and 1948.

Vaughan was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985, following which Vaughan&#x27;s daughter Patricia received this brief, handwritten congratulatory letter:

As early as July 1972, Nixon, then the President of the United States, had named Vaughan the starting shortstop on his &quot;All-Time&quot; National League All-Star Team&#x27;s pre-war (1925–1945) component, citing as his &quot;sentimental reason&quot; their high school connection while stating his belief that &quot;most experts would include Arky on a team if he were rated on hitting ability alone&quot;. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Vaughan in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. In his &quot;New Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, published in 2001, Bill James rated Vaughan as the second-best shortstop in major league history, behind fellow Pirate and mentor Honus Wagner. The connection to Wagner makes Vaughan a below-the-radar name in memorabilia circles. In his 2021 book, &quot;The Baseball 100&quot;, Joe Posnanski places Vaughan at number 61 on a list of the 100 all-time best baseball players of all time.

== Personal life ==
Vaughan married his wife, Margaret, in 1931, and they had four children.

After leaving the Seals, Vaughan bought a ranch in Eagleville, California, where he retired to fish, hunt and tend cattle. On August 30, 1952, Vaughan was fishing in nearby Lost Lake, with his friend Bill Wimer. According to a witness, Wimer stood up in the boat, causing it to capsize, and both men drowned. Their bodies were recovered the next day. Vaughan was 40.

Vaughan&#x27;s nephew Glenn Vaughan had a brief major league career with the Houston Colt .45s in 1963.

<doc id="841578" wikidata="Q1256720" url="?curid=841578" title="Human Rights Protection Party">
<text>The Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP, ) is a Samoan political party. It was founded in 1979 and dominated Samoan party politics for decades thereafter, leading every government until their defeat in 2021. Former Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi has led the party since 1998.

== History ==
Vaʻai Kolone and Tofilau Eti Alesana co-founded the party in May 1979 in opposition to the government of Tupuola Efi. It governed the country from first winning power in 1982 to 2021, except for a brief period in 1986 and 1987 when internal differences forced it into coalition.

The two founders of the early party, Kolone and Alesana, both became Prime Ministers of Samoa.

The U.S. State Department&#x27;s 2010 human rights report (published on 8 April 2011) stated that the Human Rights Protection Party remained the only officially recognized party in the Legislative Assembly of Samoa (the Fono) as of that date.

After the April 2021 Samoan general election the HRPP refused to yield power to the newly elected government, triggering the 2021 Samoan constitutional crisis. The Court of Appeal ruled against the HRPP on 23 July 2021, allowing the opposition to belatedly take power.

In November 2022, MPs Ale Vena Ale and Tuʻuʻu Anasiʻi Leota resigned from the HRPP to become independents, saying they did not want to remain in a party led by a leader guilty of contempt of court.

== Principles and policies ==
In June 2017, the Legislative Assembly passed a bill to increase support for Christianity in the country&#x27;s constitution, including a reference to the Trinity in Article 1. According to &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, &quot;What Samoa has done is shift references to Christianity into the body of the constitution, giving the text far more potential to be used in legal processes.&quot; The preamble to the constitution already described the country as &quot;an independent State based on Christian principles and Samoan custom and traditions.&quot;

<text>Charles Samuel McDowell Jr. (October 17, 1871 – May 22, 1943) was the 10th Lieutenant Governor of Alabama from 1923 to 1927, and was the interim Governor of Alabama between July 10 and July 11, 1924, when Governor William W. Brandon was out-of-state for 21 days. The state constitution requires that, if the governor is out of the state for 20 days, that the lieutenant governor acts as governor until he returns.

McDowell was born in Eufaula, Alabama. He graduated from the University of Alabama and opened a law practice in Eufaula in 1897. He served as Mayor of Eufaula from 1908 to 1912, and was President of the Alabama State Bar in 1915–16. He was elected to the Alabama State Senate in 1918.

<doc id="841585" wikidata="Q291547" url="?curid=841585" title="Phoebe (biblical figure)">
<text>Phoebe (Koine Greek: ) was a first-century Christian woman mentioned by the Apostle Paul in his Epistle to the Romans, verses . A notable woman in the church of Cenchreae, she was trusted by Paul to deliver his letter to the Romans. Paul refers to her both as a &quot;servant&quot; or &quot;deacon&quot; (Greek &quot;diakonos&quot;, which means &quot;servant&quot;) and as a helper or patron of many (Greek &quot;prostatis&quot;). This is the only place in the New Testament where a woman is specifically referred to with these two distinctions. Paul introduces Phoebe as his emissary to the church in Rome and, because they are not acquainted with her, Paul provides them with her credentials.

==Background==

Paul&#x27;s letter to the Romans was written in Corinth sometime between the years 56 and 58 in order to solicit support for an anticipated missionary journey to Spain. Although he had not yet visited Rome, Paul would have been familiar with the community and its circumstances through Priscilla and Aquila, who were in Corinth, having previously lived in Rome. Biblical scholars are divided as to whether Chapter 16, Paul&#x27;s letter of recommendation for Phoebe, was intended for Rome, with whose Christian community he was not acquainted, or with the more familiar community at Ephesus.

The name Phoebe means &quot;pure&quot;, &quot;radiant&quot;, or &quot;bright&quot;; and was the name of a Titan in Greek mythology.

Some scholars believe Phoebe was responsible for delivering Paul&#x27;s epistle to the Roman Christian church.

Phoebe is the only woman named as deacon (which means &quot;servant&quot; in Greek) in the Bible.

==Greek terms for her titles==
===&quot;diakonos&quot;===
Apostle Paul used the Greek &quot;diakonos&quot; (διάκονος) to designate Phoebe as a deacon. &quot;Deacon&quot; is a transliteration of the Greek, and in Paul&#x27;s writings sometimes refers to a Christian designated to serve as a specially-appointed &quot;assistant&quot; to the overseers of a church, and at others refers to &quot;servants&quot; in a general sense. In the letter to the Romans, apart from the debated case of Phoebe, it always refers to &quot;servants&quot; in the generic sense, as opposed to a church office. However, at this inaugural stage in the Church&#x27;s formation, some argue, it is premature to think of offices as being consistent or clearly defined, and activist Rosalba Manes argues that Paul&#x27;s use of the term &quot;deacon&quot; suggests that, like Stephen and Philip, Phoebe&#x27;s ministry may have extended beyond charitable works to include preaching and evangelization.

====&quot;Likewise the women&quot;====
There is some debate over whether the women referred to in are to be considered deacons or not. When describing the qualities that the office-holders called &quot;deacons&quot; must possess, Paul wrote &quot;gunaikas&quot; &quot;hosautos&quot;, which is translated by some as &quot;likewise the women.&quot; The &quot;likewise&quot; could indicate that female deacons are to live according to the same standards as male deacons (see also the Apostle Paul&#x27;s use of the term &quot;likewise&quot; in , , and ). The predominant view holds that this verse refers not to female deacons, but instead to the wives of deacons. See, for example, the KJV rendering: &quot;Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.&quot;

===&quot;prostatis&quot;===
In classical Greek the word &quot;prostates&quot; (προστάτης) (feminine, &quot;prostatis&quot;) was used to mean either a chief or leader, or a guardian or protector, often in a religious context; it was later used also to translate the Roman concept of a patron. The Apostle Paul&#x27;s use indicates that its range of meanings had not changed by New Testament times. This suggests that Phoebe was a woman of means, who, among other things, contributed financial support to Paul&#x27;s apostolate, and probably hosted the house church of Cenchreae in her home, as well as providing shelter and hospitality to Paul when in the town.

==Veneration==
The Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church and Episcopal Church in the United States of America place her feast day as September 3 (the latter designating it a Lesser Feast). 

The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod remembers her later, on October 25. The Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorates Phoebe with Lydia of Thyatira and Dorcas on January 27, the day after the commemoration of the early male missionaries Silas, Timothy and Titus and two days after the feast of the Conversion of St. Paul.

<text>The Titan II was an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) developed by the Glenn L. Martin Company from the earlier Titan I missile. Titan II was originally designed and used as an ICBM, but was later adapted as a medium-lift space launch vehicle (these adaptations were designated Titan II GLV and Titan 23G) to carry payloads to Earth orbit for the United States Air Force (USAF), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Those payloads included the USAF Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), NOAA weather satellites, and NASA&#x27;s Gemini crewed space capsules. The modified Titan II SLVs (Space Launch Vehicles) were launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, up until 2003.

==Titan II missile==
Part of the Titan rocket family, the Titan II ICBM was the successor to the Titan I, with double the payload. Unlike the Titan I, it used hydrazine-based hypergolic propellant which was storable and reliably ignited. This reduced time to launch and permitted it to be launched from its silo. Titan II carried the largest single warhead of any American ICBM.

===LGM-25C Missile===
The missile consists of a two-stage, rocket engine powered vehicle and a re-entry vehicle (RV). Provisions are included for in-flight separation of Stage II from Stage I, and separation of the RV from Stage II. Stage I and Stage II vehicles each contain propellant and pressurization, rocket engine, hydraulic and electrical systems, and explosive components. In addition, Stage II contains the flight control system and missile guidance system. Stage I contained three gyros and the Autopilot. The Autopilot attempted to keep the missile straight during first stage flight and sent commands to the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the 2nd stage. The IMU would compensate and send steering commands to the engine actuators.

===Airframe===
The airframe is a two-stage, aerodynamically stable structure that houses and protects the airborne missile equipment during powered flight. The missile guidance system enables the shutdown and staging enable relay to initiate Stage I separation. Each stage is in diameter and has fuel and oxidizer tanks in tandem, with the walls of the tanks forming the skin of the missile in those areas. External conduits are attached to the outside surface of the tanks to provide passage for the wire bundles and tubing. Access doors are provided on the missile forward, aft and between-tanks structure for inspection and maintenance. A removable cover for tank entry is located on the forward dome of each tank.

===Stage I airframe===
The Stage I airframe consists of an interstage structure, oxidizer tank forward skirt, oxidizer tank, inter-tank structure, and fuel tank. The interstage structure, oxidizer tank forward skirt, and inter-tank structure are all fabricated assemblies using riveted skin, stringers and frame. The oxidizer tank is a welded structure consisting of a forward dome, tank barrel, an aft dome and a feedline. The fuel tank, also a welded structure, consists of a forward dome, tank barrel, aft cone, and internal conduit.

===Stage II airframe===
The Stage II airframe consists of a transition section, oxidizer tank, inter-tank structure, fuel tank and aft skirt. The transition section, inter-tank structure and aft skirt are all fabricated assemblies using riveted skin, stringers and frame. The oxidizer tank and fuel tank are welded structures consisting of forward and aft domes.

The following data is from publication (Dash 1)
===Guidance===

The first Titan II guidance system was built by ACDelco. It used an IMU (inertial measurement unit, a gyroscopic sensor) made by ACDelco derived from original designs from MIT Draper Labs. The missile guidance computer (MGC) was the IBM ASC-15. Stage I contained three gyros and the Autopilot. The Autopilot attempted to keep the missile straight during first stage flight and sent commands to the IMU on the 2nd stage. The IMU would compensate and send steering commands to the engine actuators. When spares for this system became hard to obtain, it was replaced by a more modern guidance system, the Delco Universal Space Guidance System (USGS). The USGS used a Carousel IV IMU and a Magic 352 computer.

===Launching===
Titan II missiles were designed to be launched from underground missile silos that were hardened against nuclear attack. This was intended to allow for the United States to survive a nuclear first strike by an enemy and be able to retaliate with a second strike response.

The authority to order the launch of a Titan II was vested exclusively in the US President. Once an order was given to launch, launch codes were sent to the silos from SAC HQ or its backup in California. The signal was an audio transmission of a thirty-five-letter code.

The two missile operators would record the code in a notebook. The codes were compared to each other and if they matched, both operators proceeded to a red safe containing the missile launch documents. The safe featured a separate lock for each operator, who unlocked it using a combination known only to themself.

The safe contained a number of paper envelopes with two letters on the front. Embedded in the thirty-five letter code sent from HQ was a seven-letter sub-code. The first two letters of the sub-code indicated which envelope to open. Inside was a plastic &quot;cookie&quot;, with five more letters written on it. If the cookie matched the remaining five digits in the sub-code, the launch order was authenticated.

The message also contained a six-letter code that unlocked the missile. This code was entered on a separate system that opened a butterfly valve on one of the oxidizer lines on the missile engines. Once unlocked, the missile was ready to launch. Other portions of the message contained a launch time, which might be immediate or might be any time in the future.

When that time was reached, the two operators inserted keys into their respective control panels and turned them to launch. The keys had to be turned within two seconds of each other, and had to be held for five seconds. The consoles were too far apart for one person to turn them both within the required timing.

Successfully turning the keys would start the missile launch sequence. First, the Titan II&#x27;s batteries would be charged up completely and the missile would disconnect itself from silo power. Then the silo doors would slide open, giving a &quot;SILO SOFT&quot; alarm inside the control room. The guidance system of the Titan II would then configure itself to take control of the missile and ingest data to guide the missile to the target. Subsequently, main engine ignition would occur. Thrust would be allowed to build for a few seconds, then the supports holding the missile in place inside the silo would be released using pyrotechnic bolts, allowing the missile to lift off.

===Development===
The Titan rocket family was established in October 1955, when the Air Force awarded the Glenn L. Martin Company a contract to build an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). It became known as the Titan I, the nation&#x27;s first two-stage ICBM and first underground silo-based ICBM. The Martin Company realized that the Titan I could be further improved and presented a proposal to the U.S. Air Force for an improved version. It would carry a larger warhead over a greater range with better accuracy and could be launched more quickly. The Martin company received a contract for the new missile, designated SM-68B Titan II, in June 1960. The Titan II was 50% heavier than the Titan I, with a longer first stage and a larger diameter second stage. The Titan II also used storable propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel, which is a 1:1 mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), and dinitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. The Titan I, whose liquid oxygen oxidizer had to be loaded immediately before launching, had to be raised from its silo and fueled before launch. The use of storable propellants enabled the Titan II to be launched within 60 seconds directly from within its silo. Their hypergolic nature made them dangerous to handle; a leak could (and did) lead to explosions, and the fuel was highly toxic. However, it allowed for a rapid launch once the order was received, a significant advantage vs earlier cryogenic ICBMs which could not remain fueled indefinitely and had to be fueled before launch.

The first flight of the Titan II was in March 1962 and the missile, now designated LGM-25C, reached initial operating capability in October 1963. The Titan II contained one W-53 nuclear warhead in a Mark 6 re-entry vehicle with a range of . The W-53 had a yield of 9 megatons. This warhead was guided to its target using an inertial guidance unit. The 54 deployed Titan IIs formed the backbone of America&#x27;s strategic deterrent force until the LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM was deployed en masse during the early to mid-1960s. Twelve Titan IIs were flown in NASA&#x27;s Gemini crewed space program in the mid-1960s.

The Department of Defense predicted that a Titan II missile could eventually carry a warhead with a 35 megaton yield, based on projected improvements. However, that warhead was never developed or deployed. This would have made this warhead one of the most powerful ever, with almost double the power-to-weight ratio of the B41 nuclear bomb.

===Launch history and development===

The first Titan II launch, Missile N-2, was carried out on 16 March 1962 from LC-16 at Cape Canaveral and performed extremely well, flying downrange and depositing its reentry vehicle in the Ascension splash net. There was only one problem: a high rate of longitudinal vibrations during first stage burn. While this did not affect missile launches for the Air Force, NASA officials were concerned that this phenomenon would be harmful to astronauts on a crewed Gemini flight. The second launch, Missile N-1, lifted from LC-15 on 7 June. First stage performance was near-nominal, but the second stage developed low thrust due to a restriction in the gas generator feed. The Range Safety officer sent a manual shutdown command to the second stage, causing premature RV separation and impact well short of the intended target point. The third launch, Missile N-6 on 11 July, was completely successful. Aside from pogo oscillation (the nickname NASA engineers invented for the Titan&#x27;s vibration problem since it was thought to resemble the action of a pogo stick), the Titan II was experiencing other teething problems that were expected of a new launch vehicle. The 25 July test (Vehicle N-4) had been scheduled for 27 June, but was delayed by a month when the Titan&#x27;s right engine experienced severe combustion instability at ignition that caused the entire thrust chamber to break off of the booster and fall down the flame deflector pit, landing about 20 feet from the pad (the Titan&#x27;s onboard computer shut the engines down the moment loss of thrust occurred). The problem was traced to a bit of cleaning alcohol carelessly left in the engine. A new set of engines had to be ordered from Aerojet, and the missile lifted off from LC-16 on the morning of 25 July. The flight went entirely according to plan up to first stage burn, but the second stage malfunctioned again when the hydraulic pump failed and thrust dropped nearly 50%. The computer system compensated by running the engine for an additional 111 seconds, when propellant depletion occurred. Because the computer had not sent a manual cutoff command, reentry vehicle separation and vernier solo phase did not occur. Impact occurred downrange, half the planned distance.

The next three launches Missile N-5 (12 September), N-9 (12 October), and N-12 (26 October), were entirely successful, but the nagging pogo problem remained and the booster could not be considered man-rated until this was fixed. Martin–Marietta thus added a surge-suppressor standpipe to the oxidizer feed line in the first stage, but when the system was tested on Titan N-11 on 6 December, the effect was instead to worsen pogo in the first stage, which ended up vibrating so strongly that unstable engine thrust resulted. The result of this was to trip the first stage pressure switch and terminate thrust early. The second stage then separated and began its burn, but due to the improper speed and attitude at separation, the guidance system malfunctioned and caused an unstable flight trajectory. Impact occurred only downrange.

Vehicle N-13 was launched 13 days later and carried no standpipes, but it did have increased pressure in the first stage propellant tanks, which did cut down on vibration. In addition, the oxidizer feedlines were made of aluminum instead of steel. On the other hand, the exact reason for pogo was still unclear and a vexing problem for NASA.

The tenth Titan II flight (Vehicle N-15) took place on 10 January, the only nighttime Titan II test. While it appeared that the pogo problem was largely contained on this flight, the second stage lost thrust again due to a restriction in the gas generator and so only achieved half its intended range. While previous second stage problems were blamed on pogo, this could not be the case for N-15. Meanwhile, combustion instability was still an issue and was confirmed by Aerojet static-firing tests which showed that the LR91 Liquid-propellant engine had difficulty attaining smooth burning after the shock of startup.

Efforts to human-rate the Titan II also ran afoul of the fact that the Air Force and not NASA was in charge of its development. The former&#x27;s primary aim was to develop a missile system, not a launch vehicle for Project Gemini, and they were only interested in technical improvements to the booster insofar as they had relevance to that program. On 29 January, the Air Force Ballistic Systems Division (BSD) declared that pogo in the Titan had been reduced enough for inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) use and that no further improvements needed to be made. While adding more pressure to the propellant tanks had reduced vibration, it could only be done so much before putting unsafe structural loads on the Titan and in any case the results were still unsatisfactory from NASA&#x27;s point of view. While BSD tried to come up with a way to help NASA out, they finally decided that it was not worth the time, resources, and risk of trying to cut down further on pogo and that the ICBM program ultimately came first.

Despite the Air Force&#x27;s lack of interest in human-rating the Titan II, General Bernard Adolph Schriever assured that any problems with the booster would be fixed. BSD decided that 0.6 Gs was good enough despite NASA&#x27;s goal of 0.25 Gs and they stubbornly declared that no more resources were to be expended on it. On 29 March 1963, Schriever invited Space Systems Development (SSD) and BSD officials to his headquarters at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, but the meeting was not encouraging. Brig. Gen John L. McCoy (director of the Titan Systems Program Office) reaffirmed BSD&#x27;s stance that the pogo and combustion instability problems in the Titan were not a serious issue to the ICBM program and it would be too difficult and risky at this point to try to improve them for NASA&#x27;s sake. Meanwhile, Martin–Marietta and Aerojet both argued that most of the major development problems with the booster had been solved and it would only take a little more work to man-rate it. They proposed adding more standpipes to the first stage and using baffled injectors in the second stage.

A closed-door meeting of NASA and Air Force officials led to the former arguing that without any definitive answer to the pogo and combustion instability problems, the Titan could not safely fly human passengers. But by this point, the Air Force was taking a bigger role in the Gemini program due to proposed uses of the spacecraft for military applications (e.g. Blue Gemini). During the first week of April, a joint plan was drafted which would ensure that pogo was to be reduced to fit NASA&#x27;s target and to make design improvements to both Titan stages. The program carried the conditions that the ICBM program retained first priority and was not to be delayed by Gemini, and that General McCoy would have final say on all matters.

Meanwhile, the Titan II development program ran into difficulties during the first half of 1963. On 16 February, Vehicle N-7 was launched from a silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and malfunctioned almost immediately at liftoff. An umbilical cord failed to separate cleanly, ripping out wiring in the second stage which not only cut power to the guidance system, but also prevented the range safety charges from being armed. The missile lifted with a continuous uncontrolled roll, and at about T+15 seconds, when the pitch and roll program would normally begin, it began a sudden sharp downward pitch. Launch crews were in a panic as they had a missile that was not only out of control, but could not be destroyed and might end up crashing into a populated area. Fortunately, the Titan&#x27;s errant flight came to an end after flipping almost completely upside-down which caused the second stage to separate from the stack. The ISDS (Inadvertent Separation Destruct System) then activated and blew up the first stage. Most of the debris from the missile fell offshore or on the beach, and the second stage impacted the water mostly intact, although the oxidizer tank had been ruptured by flying debris from first stage destruction. Navy crews launched a salvage effort to recover the reentry vehicle and the guidance system from the sea floor. The reentry vehicle was found and dredged up along with parts of the second stage, but the guidance system was not recovered.

The mishap was traced to an unforeseen design flaw in the silo&#x27;s construction – there was not enough room for the umbilicals to detach properly which resulted in wiring being ripped out of the Titan. It was solved by adding extra lanyards to the umbilicals so they would have sufficient &quot;play&quot; in them to separate without damaging the missile. The flight was nonetheless considered a &quot;partial&quot; success in that the Titan had cleared the silo successfully. The inadvertent rolling motion of the vehicle may have also prevented a worse disaster as it added stability and prevented it from colliding with the silo walls as it ascended.

While N-18 flew successfully from the Cape on 21 March, N-21 suffered another second stage failure after having been delayed several weeks due to another episode of the first stage thrust chambers breaking off prior to launch. This was followed by a launch from VAFB on 27 April when Missile N-8 flew successfully. N-14 (9 May), flown from LC-16 at the Cape, suffered another early second stage shutdown due to a leaking oxidizer line. Missiles N-19 on 13 May (VAFB) and N-17 on 24 May (CCAS) were successful, but of 18 Titan II launches so far, only 10 had met all of their objectives. On 29 May, Missile N-20 was launched from LC-16 with a new round of pogo-suppressing devices on board. Unfortunately, a fire broke out in the thrust section soon after liftoff, leading to loss of control during ascent. The missile pitched down and the second stage separated from the stack at T+52 seconds, triggering the ISDS, which blew the first stage to pieces. The second stage was manually destroyed by the Range Safety officer shortly thereafter. No useful pogo data was obtained due to the early termination of the flight, and the accident was traced to a stress corrosion of the aluminum fuel valve, which resulted in a propellant leak that caught fire from contacting hot engine parts.
The next flight was Missile N-22, a silo test from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 20 June, but once again the second stage lost thrust due to a gas generator restriction. At this point, BSD suspended further flights. Of the 20 Titan launches, seven would have required the abort of a crewed launch, and General McCoy had to make good 12 of the 13 remaining scheduled tests. Since the ICBM program came first, pogo suppression had to be shelved.

On the other hand, only Missile N-11 suffered a malfunction due to pogo and the combustion instability issue had occurred in static firings, but not any actual flights. All Titan II failures save for N-11 were caused by gas generator restrictions, broken plumbing, or faulty welds. The trouble appeared to be with Aerojet, and a visit of MSC officials to their Sacramento, California, plant in July revealed a number of extremely careless handling and manufacturing processes. A systematic effort to improve the quality control of the LR-87 engines was launched, which included extensive redesigns of components to improve reliability as well as fixes to the gas generator restriction issue.

===Service history===
The Titan II was in service from 1963 to 1987. There were originally 54 Titan II Strategic Air Command missiles.

The 54 Titan II missiles were on 24-hour continuous alert with 18 missiles each surrounding three bases: Davis–Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Arizona, Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas, and McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas.

====Mishaps====
On 9 August 1965, a fire and resultant loss of oxygen when a high-pressure hydraulic line was cut with an oxyacetylene torch in a missile silo (Site 373–4) near Searcy, Arkansas, killed 53 people, mostly civilian repairmen doing The fire occurred while the 750-ton silo lid was closed, which contributed to a reduced oxygen level for the men who survived the initial fire. Two men escaped alive, both with injuries due to the fire and smoke, one by groping in complete darkness for the exit. The missile survived and was undamaged.

On 20 June 1974, one of two start cartridges failed to ignite due to faulty wiring on a Titan II launch from Silo 395C at Vandenberg AFB in California. The launch was part of the Anti Ballistic Missile program and was witnessed by an entourage of general officers and congressmen. The Titan suffered severe structural failure with both the hypergolic fuel tank and the oxidizer tank leaking and accumulating in the bottom of the silo. A large number of civilian contractors were evacuated from the Command and Control Bunker.

On 24 August 1978, SSgt Robert Thomas was killed at a site outside Rock, Kansas when a missile in its silo leaked propellant. Another airman, A1C Erby Hepstall, later died from lung injuries sustained in 
On 19 September 1980, a major explosion occurred after a socket from a large socket wrench rolled off a platform, fell, and punctured the missile&#x27;s lower-stage fuel tank, causing a fuel leak. Because of the hypergolic propellants involved, the entire missile exploded a few hours later, killing an Air Force airman, SrA David Livingston, and destroying the silo (374-7, near Damascus, Arkansas). This was the same missile that had been in the silo during the deadly fire at site 373–4, refurbished and relocated after the incident. Due to the warhead&#x27;s built-in safety features, it did not detonate and was recovered about away. The 1988 television movie &quot;Disaster at Silo 7&quot; is loosely based on the event. Author Eric Schlosser published a book centered on the accident, &quot;Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety&quot;, in September 2013. &quot;Command and Control&quot;, a documentary film based on Schlosser&#x27;s book, aired on PBS on 10 January 2017.

====Retirement====
The Titan II was originally expected to be in service for only 5–7 years, but ended up lasting far longer than anyone expected in part because of its large size and throw weight. Leadership within the USAF and SAC were reluctant to retire the Titan II because while it made up only a small fraction of the total number of missiles on standby, it represented a significant portion of the total megatonnage that was deployed by Air Force ICBMs.

It is a common misconception that the Titan IIs were decommissioned because of a weapons reduction treaty, but in fact, they were simply aging victims of a weapons modernization program. Because of the volatility of the liquid fuel and the problem with aging seals, the Titan II missiles had originally been scheduled to be retired beginning in 1971. By the mid-1970s, the original AC Delco inertial guidance system had become obsolete and spare parts could no longer be obtained for it, so the guidance packages in the stock of Titan missiles were replaced by the Universal Space Guidance System. After the two accidents in 1978 and 1980, respectively, deactivation of the Titan II ICBM system finally began in July 1982. The last Titan II missile, located at Silo 373-8 near Judsonia, Arkansas, was deactivated on 5 May 1987. With their warheads removed, the deactivated missiles were initially placed in storage at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, and the former Norton Air Force Base, California, but were later broken up for salvage by 2009.

A single Titan II complex belonging to the former strategic missile wing at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base escaped destruction after decommissioning and is open to the public as the Titan Missile Museum at Sahuarita, Arizona. The missile resting in the silo is a real Titan II, but was a training missile and never contained fuel, oxidizer, or a warhead.

==Titan II missile disposition==

Thirty-three Titan-II Research Test (N-type) missiles were built and all but one were launched either at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, or Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, in 1962–64. The surviving N-10, AF Ser. No. 61-2738/60-6817 resides in the silo at the Titan Missile Museum (ICBM Site 571–7), operated by the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum at Green Valley, south of Tucson, Arizona, on Interstate-19.

Twelve Titan-II Gemini Launch Vehicles (GLVs) were produced. All were launched from the then-Cape Kennedy Air Force Station in 1964–66. The top half of GLV-5 62-12560 was recovered offshore following its launch and is on display at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center, Alabama.

One hundred and eight Titan-II ICBM (B-Types) were produced. Forty-nine were launched for testing at Vandenberg Air Force Base from 1964 to 1976. Two were lost in accidents within silos. One B-2, AF Ser. No. 61-2756, was given to the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, in the 1970s.

The 56 surviving missiles were pulled from silos and individual base stores and all transferred to the then-Norton Air Force Base, California, during the 1980s. They were stored under plastic coverings and had helium pumped into their engine components to prevent rust. Norton Air Force Base buildings 942 and 945 held the missiles. Building 945 held 30 missiles, while Building 942 held 11 plus a single stage 1. The buildings also held extra stage engines and the interstages. 14 full missiles and one extra second stage had been transferred from Norton Air Force Base to the manufacturer, Martin Marietta, at Martin&#x27;s Denver, Colorado, facility for refurbishment by the end of the decade. 13 of the 14 were launched as 23Gs. One missile, B-108, AF Ser. No. 66-4319 (23G-10 the spare for the 23G program), went to the Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon. Finally, B-34 Stage 2 was delivered from Norton Air Force Base to Martin Marietta on 28 April 1986, but was not modified to a G, nor was it listed as arriving or being destroyed at the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base; it is therefore unaccounted for within the open source public domain.

Forty-two B-series missiles remained, 41 full and one first stage at Norton Air Force Base, and the second stage at Martin. Of these, 38 and one second stage were stored outside at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC), now known as the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309 AMARG), adjacent to Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, to await final destruction between 2004 and 2008. Four of the 42 were saved and sent to museums (below).

==Titan II launch vehicle==

The Titan II space-launch vehicles were purpose-built as space launchers or are decommissioned ICBMs that have been refurbished and equipped with hardware required for use as space launch vehicles. All twelve Gemini capsules, including ten crewed, were launched by Titan II launchers.

The Titan II space launch vehicle is a two-stage liquid fueled booster, designed to provide a small-to-medium weight class capability. It is able to lift approximately into a circular polar low-Earth orbit. The first stage consists of one ground ignited Aerojet LR-87 liquid propellant rocket engine (with two combustion chambers and nozzles but a single turbopump system), while the second stage consists of an Aerojet LR91 Liquid-propellant engine.

By the mid-1980s, with the stock of refurbished Atlas E/F missiles finally starting to run out, the Air Force decided to reuse decommissioned Titan IIs for space launches. The Martin Marietta Astronautics Group was awarded a contract in January 1986 to refurbish, integrate, and launch fourteen Titan II ICBMs for government space launch requirements. These were designated Titan 23G. The Air Force successfully launched the first Titan 23G space launch vehicle from Vandenberg Air Force Base 5 September 1988. NASA&#x27;s Clementine spacecraft was launched aboard a Titan 23G in January 1994. All Titan 23G missions were launched from Space Launch Complex 4 West (SLC-4W) on Vandenberg Air Force Base, under the operational command of the 6595th Aerospace Test Group and its follow-on organizations of the 4th Space Launch Squadron and 2nd Space Launch Squadron. The Titan 23G ended up being less of a cost-saving measure than anticipated as the expense of refurbishing the missiles for space launches turned out to be more than the cost of flying a brand-new Delta booster. Unlike refurbished Atlas missiles, which were completely torn down and rebuilt from the ground up, the Titan 23G had relatively few changes aside from replacing the warhead interface and adding range safety and telemetry packages. The engines were merely given a brief static firing to verify their functionality. Of the 13 launches, there was one failure, when a launch of a Landsat satellite in 1993 ended in a useless orbit due to a malfunction of the satellite kick motor. The last Titan II launch was on 18 October 2003 when a DMSP weather satellite was successfully launched. This flight had been scheduled for launch in early 2001, but persistent problems with the booster and satellite delayed it over two years. A total of 282 Titan IIs were launched between 1962 and 2003, of which 25 were space launches.

<doc id="841596" wikidata="Q286829" url="?curid=841596" title="Koeksister">
<text>A koeksister (; ) is a traditional Afrikaner confectionery made of fried dough infused in syrup or honey. There is also a Cape Malay version of the dish, which is a fried ball of dough that is rolled in desiccated coconut called a koesister. The name derives from the Dutch word &quot;koek&quot;, which generally means a wheat flour confectionery.

Koeksisters are prepared by frying plaited dough strips in oil, then submersing the hot fried dough into ice cold sugar syrup. Koeksisters have a golden crunchy crust and liquid syrup centre, are very sticky and sweet, and taste like honey.

A monument of a koeksister in the Afrikaner community of Orania alludes to the Afrikaner tradition of baking them to raise funds for the building of churches and schools.

<text>Radio K.A.O.S. is the second solo studio album by the English rock musician Roger Waters. Released on 15 June 1987 in the United Kingdom and 16 June in the United States, it was Waters&#x27; first solo studio album after his formal departure from the band Pink Floyd in 1985. Like his previous and future studio albums and many works of his during his time with Pink Floyd, the album is a concept album based on a number of key topical subjects of the late 1980s, including monetarism and its effect on citizens, popular culture of the time, and the events and consequences of the Cold War. It also makes criticisms of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government, much like Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Final Cut&quot; (1983), another album conceived by Waters.

The album follows Billy, a mentally and physically disabled man from Wales, forced to live with his uncle David in Los Angeles after his brother Benny is sent to prison following an act intended to support striking coal miners which results in the death of a taxi driver, and his dismissal from his mining job due to &quot;market forces&quot;. The album explores Billy&#x27;s view of the world through an on-air conversation between him and Jim, a disc jockey (DJ) at a fictitious local radio station named Radio KAOS.

== Background and inspiration ==
In 1979, Waters met American disc jockey Jim Ladd for a radio documentary on &quot;The Wall&quot; album, beginning a friendship which remained until Ladd&#x27;s death in 2023. Ladd was an inspiration as he brought some light into Waters&#x27;s dim view of L.A. life, initially through listening to the bizarre &quot;Fish Report&quot; from KMET. Waters became increasingly interested in Ladd&#x27;s plight with his radio station KMET, and his eventual sacking to change the programming format of the station in search of market-researched profits. In 1985, Waters wrote a song called &quot;Get Back to Radio,&quot; which seemed to be partly based on the experiences of Ladd, and partly from childhood memories – Waters fondly remembers listening to Radio Luxembourg well into the night as a child.

An event from the 1985 miners&#x27; strike in Britain where a striking worker threw a concrete block off a motorway bridge, killing a taxi driver who was taking a strikebreaker to his job, seemed to register in Waters&#x27;s subconscious, emerging in the second song written, &quot;Who Needs Information&quot; and later, &quot;Me or Him.&quot; The album, with a working title of &quot;Home&quot;, took only three months to record, developed from 16 songs throughout 1986 and was worked into a now familiar Waters concept album.

The Ronald Reagan campaign advertisements during &quot;Me or Him&quot; are sampled from an actual 1980 political advertisement of Reagan&#x27;s.

== Concept ==

Billy is a 23-year-old Welshman from the South Wales Valleys. He is mentally and physically disabled as a result of cerebral palsy, uses a wheelchair and is only able to work his upper body. Though he is perceived as mentally challenged, his disability has actually made him not only a genius, but also superhuman, as he also has the ability to literally hear radio waves throughout all frequencies without aid.

Billy was living with his twin brother Benny, who was a coal miner, wife Molly, and their children. Unfortunately, Benny has lost his job in the mines due to the &quot;market forces.&quot; One night, Benny and Billy are out on a pub crawl when they pass a shop full of TV screens broadcasting Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;mocking condescension.&quot; Benny vents his anger on this shop and steals a cordless phone. Next, in theatrical fashion, Benny poses on a footbridge in protest to the closures; the same night, a taxi driver is killed by a concrete block dropped from a similar bridge by Benny (&quot;Who Needs Information&quot; – track 2). The police question Benny, who hides the phone in Billy&#x27;s wheelchair.

Benny is taken to prison, and Molly, unable to cope, sends Billy to live with his uncle David in Los Angeles, California, United States. Since Billy can hear radio waves in his head (&quot;Radio Waves&quot; – track 1), he begins to explore the cordless phone, recognising its similarity to a radio. He experiments with the phone and is able to access computers and speech synthesisers, and learns to speak through them. He calls a radio station in L.A. named Radio K.A.O.S. and tells them of his life story about his brother being in jail (&quot;Me or Him&quot; – track 3), about his sister-in-law not being able to cope and sending him to L.A. to live with his uncle Dave (&quot;Sunset Strip&quot; – track 5), and about the closures of the mines (&quot;Powers That Be&quot; – track 4).

Billy eventually hacks into a military satellite and fools the world into thinking nuclear ICBMs are about to be detonated at major cities all over the world while deactivating the military&#x27;s power to retaliate (&quot;Home&quot; – track 6, and &quot;Four Minutes&quot; – track 7). The album concludes with a song about how everyone, in thinking they were about to die, realises that the fear and competitiveness peddled by the mass media is much less important than their love for family and the larger community. (&quot;The Tide Is Turning&quot; – track 8).

In the sleeve notes, Waters dedicated the album &quot;to all those who find themselves at the violent end of monetarism.&quot;

== Recording ==
The album was recorded at Waters&#x27; own personal studio in London called The Billiard Room and mixed at Odyssey Studios in London.

Recording was done with the aid of Roger Waters&#x27; backing band the Bleeding Heart Band.

== Release ==
=== Packaging ===
Morse code is a central theme in the art and style of the album, visually and audibly. The artwork for the album, designed by Kate Hepburn, are written Morse code sentences in green imprinted on a black background. The translation spans both the front and the back of the sleeve. The front cover reads ROGER/WATERS/RADIO/KAOS/WHONE/EDSINF/ORMA/TIONTH. The back cover reads EPOWE/RSTHAT/BEHO/METHETI/DEISTU/RNING/RADIO/WAVES. When translated as a whole, the artwork spells out the name of the artist, the album, and five tracks from the album. It reads: Roger Waters, &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot;, &quot;Who Needs Information,&quot; &quot;The Powers That Be,&quot; &quot;Home,&quot; &quot;The Tide Is Turning&quot; and &quot;Radio Waves.&quot; The code on the artwork is also heard throughout the album itself, most notably at the beginning and end of the album, book-ending the piece in the same manner as the heartbeat from Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973) and the Bleeding Heart Band from &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979).

=== Singles ===
Aside from eight songs that were used on the released album, additional songs appeared as B-sides.

The lead single from the album, &quot;Radio Waves&quot;, was released on 11 May 1987 as a 7&quot; single, a 12&quot; extended play single, and a CD single. The b-side was a non-album track called &quot;Going to Live in L.A.&quot;. &quot;Radio Waves&quot; briefly went into both the American and British charts in the month of release, reaching No. 74 on the UK singles chart and No. 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart.

&quot;Sunset Strip&quot; was released as the second single in September 1987. The B-side included a demo of the song &quot;Get Back to Radio&quot; and a live version of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot;. Despite &quot;Sunset Strip&quot; not being released as a promo to American and British radio stations, and competing against Waters&#x27;s former band whose single &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; was topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart, it managed to go as high as No. 15.

&quot;The Tide Is Turning&quot; was released as the third single in the United Kingdom and Australia. Without direct competition from Waters&#x27;s former band, Pink Floyd, the single was a small commercial success in Europe. It peaked at No. 54 on the UK singles chart.

&quot;Who Needs Information?&quot; was released in the United States in December 1987 as the fourth and final single, backed with the live exclusive &quot;Molly&#x27;s Song&quot;, another previously unreleased song. The single was in direct competition with Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;On the Turning Away&quot;. While Pink Floyd&#x27;s singles topped the US Mainstream Rock charts back to back, &quot;Who Needs Information?&quot; failed to chart, despite a radio promotional release.

Waters even once said in an interview that he might even release an EP with some unreleased songs from this project for those who might be interested, but this never appeared.

== Promotion ==
The record was first announced via a press release from EMI on 6 April 1987, confirming Waters&#x27;s new album, its details and release date. The press release mentioned that the project was conceived to be a full-out rock opera, complete with a stage show, film and live album, much like Waters&#x27;s original vision for the album.

Waters also made a Video EP for this album featuring the songs &quot;Radio Waves,&quot; &quot;Sunset Strip,&quot; &quot;Fish Report,&quot; &quot;Four Minutes&quot; and &quot;The Tide Is Turning (After Live Aid).&quot;

=== Tour ===

The &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; tour aka K.A.O.S. On the Road ran from mid-August 1987 to the end of November of the same year. It was entirely in North America except for the final two shows from Wembley, England. The tour, the largest of Waters&#x27;s career up to that point, featured extravagant staging, props and video. The entirety of the concert was presented as a K.A.O.S. radio special, &quot;K.A.O.S. on the Road&quot;, and featured disc jockey (DJ) Jim Ladd introducing the songs, conversing with Billy, or simply complimenting Waters and the band on their performance. The screen used for the tour displayed video of Waters, Ladd, and various other actors playing out aspects of the narrative, as well as animations and video illustrating the songs. The concert was &#x27;interrupted&#x27; at one point each night by Billy, who played the video to the début Pink Floyd single &quot;Arnold Layne&quot;, in remembrance of Syd Barrett.

Prior to each show, Jim Ladd took calls from people in a booth and these calls were then answered by Waters. The person in each booth was usually chosen via a competition on local radio stations, in keeping with the theme of the concert. The setlist included the entire &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; album, with popular Waters-composed Pink Floyd songs mixed into the sequence, and typically lasted more than two and a half hours.

The tour went heavily into debt and Waters used his own money at one point to underwrite the expense, as there were massive overruns and delays. The tour was proposed to go worldwide, but due to financial considerations these discussions never went any further, and the tour ended.

== Critical reception ==

Released on 15 June 1987 in the United Kingdom and the United States, the album was met with mixed reviews. It peaked at number 25 in the United Kingdom, 33 in Australia, and 50 in the United States.

J. D. Considine of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine gave a positive review, describing the album as &quot;by no means perfect&quot; but &quot;powerful&quot;. Although the themes and style of the album were criticized, he deemed it an improvement on its predecessor &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; (1984).

Robert Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote: &quot;In which Waters&#x27;s wheelchair-bound version of the deaf, dumb and blind boy learns to control the world&#x27;s computers with his cordless phone, then simulates impending nuclear holocaust just to scare the shit out of the powers that be. I have serious reservations about any record that can&#x27;t be enjoyed unless you sit there reading the inner sleeve, but this is not without its aural rewards – a coverable song or two and some nice comping on shakuhachi, as well as the deep engineering that made Floyd famous. As pretentious goes, not stupid.&quot;

Waters has since expressed dislike for the album and the effort of creating it. &quot;Between Ian Ritchie and myself, we really fucked that record up,&quot; he remarked. &quot;We tried too hard to make it sound modern. Also, the part where Billy pretends that he&#x27;s just started the Third World War I now find faintly embarrassing. And I dislike the backing vocals on &#x27;The Tide Is Turning&#x27;.&quot;

In addition to being dissatisfied with the production, Waters regretted trimming the album from a double to a single one, thus losing much of the concept.

In a retrospective review, Mike DeGagne of AllMusic gave the album three-and-a-half stars, stating that, unlike some of Waters&#x27;s other works, it conveys the music more than the narrative, but &quot;while both &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; and &quot;Amused to Death&quot; convey his talented use of concept, imagination, and lyrical mastery, this album seems to be nothing more than a fictional tale with a blatantly apparent message&quot;.

<text>Christine Chubbuck (August 24, 1944 – July 15, 1974) was an American television news reporter who worked for stations WTOG and WXLT-TV in Sarasota, Florida.

The first person to die by suicide on a live television broadcast, Chubbuck shot herself in the head with a gun on July 15, 1974, during WXLT-TV&#x27;s &quot;Suncoast Digest&quot;, after claiming that the network was about to present &quot;an exclusive coverage of an attempted suicide&quot;; it was confirmed after her death that she had added the quote in her script for the broadcast, making the action likely premeditated.

==Early life==
Christine Chubbuck was born in Hudson, Ohio, the daughter of Margretha D. &quot;Peg&quot; (1921–1994) and George Fairbanks Chubbuck (1918–2015). She had two brothers, Greg and Tim. Chubbuck attended the Laurel School for Girls in Shaker Heights, a suburb of Cleveland. During her years at Laurel, she jokingly formed a &quot;Dateless Wonder Club&quot; with other &quot;rejected&quot; girls who did not have dates on Saturday nights. Chubbuck attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, for one year, majoring in theater arts, then attended Endicott College in Beverly, Massachusetts, before earning a degree in broadcasting at Boston University in 1965.

According to Christine Chubbuck&#x27;s brother, Greg, she began dating a man in his 30s when she was 21, but her father did not approve of the relationship and she had never dated another man since then.

==Career==
===Early work===
Chubbuck worked for WVIZ in Cleveland between 1966 and 1967, and attended a summer workshop in radio and television at New York University in 1967. That same year, she worked in Canton, Ohio, and, for three months, at WQED-TV in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as an assistant producer for two local shows, &quot;Women&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Keys to the City&quot;. In 1968, Chubbuck left WQED to spend four years as a hospital computer operator and two years with a cable television firm in Sarasota, Florida. Immediately before joining ABC affiliate WXLT-TV (now WWSB), she worked in the traffic department of WTOG in St. Petersburg.

Several years before her death, Chubbuck had moved into her family&#x27;s summer cottage on Siesta Key. Sally Quinn of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; later reported that she had painted the bedroom and canopied bed to look like that of a young teenager. After Chubbuck&#x27;s parents were divorced, her mother Peg and younger brother Greg came to live in the Florida home. When Greg left, her elder brother Tim moved in. Chubbuck had a close relationship with her family, describing her mother and Greg as her closest friends.

===WXLT-TV===
WXLT&#x27;s owner, Bob Nelson, hired Chubbuck as a reporter, but later gave her a community affairs talk show, &quot;Suncoast Digest&quot;, which ran at 9:00am. Production Manager Gordon J. Acker described Chubbuck&#x27;s new show to a local paper: &quot;It will feature local people and local activities. It will give attention, for instance, to the storefront organizations that are concerned with alcoholics, drug users, and other &#x27;lost&#x27; segments of the community.&quot; Page five of the article showed a smiling Chubbuck posed with a WXLT camera.

Chubbuck took her position seriously, inviting local officials from Sarasota and Bradenton to discuss matters of interest to the growing beach community. After her death, the &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot; reported that she had been nominated for a Forestry and Conservation Recognition Award by the Bradenton district office of the Florida Division of Forestry. Chubbuck was considered a &quot;strong contender&quot; by district forester Mike Keel. He had been scheduled to appear as a guest on Chubbuck&#x27;s show the morning of her suicide, but canceled because of the birth of his son. On occasion, Chubbuck incorporated homemade puppets she had used to entertain children with intellectual disabilities during her volunteer work at Sarasota Memorial Hospital.

==Death==
===Depression===
Chubbuck spoke to her family at length about her struggles with depression and suicidal tendencies, though she did not inform them of her intent to die by suicide on live television. She had attempted to overdose on drugs in 1970 and frequently made reference to that event. Chubbuck had been seeing a psychiatrist up until several weeks before her death. Her mother chose not to tell WXLT management about her daughter&#x27;s suicidal tendencies because she feared Chubbuck would be fired.

Chubbuck&#x27;s focus on her lack of intimate relationships is generally considered to be the driving force for her depression. Her mother later summarized that &quot;her suicide was simply because her personal life was not enough.&quot; She lamented to co-workers that her 30th birthday was approaching, and she was still a virgin who had never been on more than two dates with a man. Her brother Greg later recalled a man that she had gone out with several times before moving to Sarasota, but agreed that his sister had trouble connecting socially in the beach resort town. He believed her constant self-deprecation for being &quot;dateless&quot; contributed to her ongoing depression.

According to Quinn, Chubbuck had an unrequited crush on co-worker George Peter Ryan. She baked him a cake for his birthday and sought his romantic attention, only to find out he was already involved with sports reporter Andrea Kirby. Kirby had been the co-worker closest to Chubbuck, but she was offered a new job in Baltimore, which had further depressed Chubbuck. Her lack of a romantic partner was considered a tangent of her desperate need to have close friends, though co-workers said she tended to be brusque (abrupt) and defensive whenever they made friendly gestures toward her. She was self-deprecating, criticizing herself constantly and rejecting any compliments others paid her.

Chubbuck had her right ovary removed in an operation the year before her suicide, and had been told that if she did not become pregnant within two to three years, it was unlikely she would ever be able to conceive.

A week before her suicide, she told night news editor Rob Smith that she had bought a gun and joked about killing herself on air. Smith later stated that he did not respond to what he thought was Chubbuck&#x27;s &quot;sick&quot; attempt at humor, and changed the subject. She had also hosted a party just days before the incident. Craig Sager, a WXLT sportscaster who later gained fame as a sideline reporter for Turner Sports, was among those who attended. &quot;She was having a great time. It was like, &#x27;Oh My God&#x27; this is such a different side to her,&quot; Sager recalled. &quot;That was her going away party and it was her chance to say goodbye to everyone, but of course we didn&#x27;t realize it at the time. It was just so shocking.&quot; Sager had been covering spring training for baseball when he learned of Chubbuck&#x27;s suicide.

===Suicide===
On the morning of July 15, 1974, Chubbuck confused co-workers by claiming she had to read a newscast to open &quot;Suncoast Digest&quot;, something she had never done before. That morning&#x27;s guest waited across the studio while Chubbuck sat at the news anchor&#x27;s desk. During the first eight minutes of her program, Chubbuck covered three national news stories and then a shooting from the previous day at a local restaurant, Beef &amp; Bottle, at the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport.

The film reel of the restaurant shooting had jammed and would not run, so Chubbuck shrugged it off and said on-camera, &quot;In keeping with the WXLT practice of presenting the most immediate and complete reports of local blood and guts news, TV 40 presents what is believed to be a television first. In living color, an exclusive coverage of an attempted suicide.&quot; She drew a .38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson Model 36 revolver and shot herself behind her right ear. Chubbuck fell forward violently and the technical director faded the broadcast rapidly to black.

The station quickly ran a standard public service announcement and then a movie. Some television viewers called the police, while others called the station to inquire if the shooting was staged.

After the shooting, news director Mike Simmons found the papers from which Chubbuck had been reading her newscast contained a complete script of her program, including not only the shooting but also a third-person account to be read by whichever staff member took over the broadcast after the incident. He said her script called for her condition to be listed as &quot;critical&quot;.

Chubbuck was taken to Sarasota Memorial Hospital, where she was pronounced dead fourteen hours later. Upon receiving the news, a WXLT staffer released the information to other stations using Chubbuck&#x27;s script. For a time, WXLT aired reruns of the TV series &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; in place of &quot;Suncoast Digest&quot;.

===Aftermath===
Chubbuck&#x27;s body was cremated. The funeral ceremony was held on the beach, where her ashes were scattered into the Gulf of Mexico. Approximately 120 people attended, including local officials who had appeared on her show. Three songs by her favorite singer, Roberta Flack, were played. Presbyterian minister Thomas Beason delivered the eulogy, stating, &quot;We suffer at our sense of loss, we are frightened by her rage, we are guilty in the face of her rejection, we are hurt by her choice of isolation and we are confused by her message.&quot;

&quot;Suncoast Digest&quot; stayed on the air for several years with new hosts. Simmons, the station director, said Chubbuck&#x27;s suicide was unrelated to the station. &quot;The crux of the situation was that she was a 29-year-old girl who wanted to be married and who wasn&#x27;t,&quot; he said in 1977.

The broadcast of Chubbuck&#x27;s death has not been seen since its airing, and numerous theories on what happened to the recording have been advanced. One was that the station owner Robert Nelson kept it, and it was in the possession of his widow, Mollie. It was confirmed in June 2016 that the recording of Chubbuck&#x27;s death exists and had indeed been in Nelson&#x27;s possession, but was handed over to a &quot;very large law firm&quot; for safekeeping by Mollie. She has no plans to make it publicly available.

In 2007, Greg Chubbuck spoke publicly about his sister for the first time since 1974 in an E! television special. In 2008, the suicide hoax blog 90 Day Jane cited Chubbuck&#x27;s death as inspiration.

==In popular culture==
A widespread urban legend claims that Chubbuck&#x27;s suicide inspired Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s script for the 1976 film &quot;Network&quot;, in which news anchor Howard Beale (Peter Finch) announces that he will kill himself live on-air. Dave Itzkoff, author of &quot;Mad as Hell: The Making of Network and the Fateful Vision of the Angriest Man in Movies&quot;, pointed out that Chayefsky was already working on the screenplay before Chubbuck&#x27;s suicide. The only mention of Chubbuck that Itzkoff could find in Chayefsky&#x27;s notes and papers was in one of the later drafts of the screenplay, where a line that was later deleted has Beale saying he will commit suicide &quot;right on the air... like that girl in Florida&quot;. When shooting &quot;Kate Plays Christine&quot;, director Robert Greene stated that &quot;everyone he met in Sarasota believed that there was a connection&quot; between Chubbuck and &quot;Network&quot;. Greene told Itzkoff that &quot;I don’t mind that it&#x27;s wrong... It&#x27;s about how her story reverberates in all these other ways. That being not quite true seems completely appropriate.&quot;

In 2003, Christopher Sorrentino published &quot;Condition&quot;, a short story based on Chubbuck&#x27;s suicide, in the literary magazine &quot;Conjunctions&quot;.

In 2016, two films about Chubbuck played at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. The first, &quot;Christine,&quot; was directed by Antonio Campos, and starred Rebecca Hall as Christine Chubbuck and Michael C. Hall as George Peter Ryan. The second was the documentary &quot;Kate Plays Christine&quot;, which depicts actress Kate Lyn Sheil&#x27;s preparation for the role of Chubbuck in a hypothetical film.

<text>Comte Pierre Louis Roederer (15 February 1754 – 17 December 1835) was a French politician, economist, and historian, politically active in the era of the French Revolution and First French Republic. Roederer&#x27;s son, Baron Antoine Marie Roederer (1782–1865), also became a noted political figure.

==Biography==

===Early activities===
Born in Metz, the son of a magistrate, he studied law at the University of Strasbourg, and, at the age of twenty-five, became councillor at the &quot;parlement&quot; of Metz (in exchange for 32,000 &quot;livres&quot;), and was commissioned in 1787 to draw up a list of remonstrances. During the period, he became an admirer of the economist Adam Smith, and helped make his works known in France. His 1787 work &quot;Suppression des douanes intérieures&quot; advocated the suppression of internal customs houses; the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describes it as &quot;an elaborate treatise on the laws of commerce and on the theory of customs imposts&quot;.

On the proposition of Roederer, in 1787, the Royal Society of Science and Arts of Metz offered a prize for the best essay in answer to the question: &quot;What are the best means to make the Jews happier and more useful in France?&quot;. Abbé Gregoire was one of three laureates with his Essay on the physical, moral and political regeneration of the Jews. It was the first step towards their emancipation, which was always defended by Roederer.

In 1788 he published the boldly liberal pamphlet &quot;Députation aux États généraux&quot; (&quot;Deputation to the Estates-General&quot;). Partly on the strength of this he was elected deputy to the Estates-General by the Third Estate of the bailliage of Metz. Although not present at the event of June 1789, Roederer was sketched by Jacques-Louis David into his drawing of the &quot;Tennis Court Oath&quot;.

In the National Constituent Assembly, Roederer was a member of the committee of taxes (&quot;comité des contributions&quot;), prepared a scheme for a new system of taxation, drew up a law on patents, occupied himself with the laws relating to revenue stamps and &quot;assignats&quot;, and was successful in opposing the introduction of an income tax.

===Paris Directory and hiding===
After the close of the Constituent Assembly, he was elected, on 11 November 1791, &quot;procureur général syndic&quot; of the &quot;département&quot; of Paris. The directory of the &quot;département&quot;, of which the Duc de la Rochefoucauld d&#x27;Enville was president, was at this time in pronounced opposition to the radical views that dominated the Legislative Assembly and the Jacobin Club, and Roederer was not altogether in touch with his colleagues. For example, he took no share in signing their protest against the law against the non-juring clergy as a violation of religious liberty.

But the directory did not long survive: with the growing revolutionary opposition in the capital, many of its members resigned and fled, and their places could not be filled. Roederer himself left in his &quot;Chronique des cinquante jours&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of fifty days&quot;, 1832) an account of the pitiable part played by the directory of the &quot;département&quot; in the critical period between the failed insurrection of 20 June 1792 and the successful insurrection of 10 August.

Seeing the perilous drift of things, he had tried to get into touch with King Louis XVI, and it was on his advice that the latter took refuge in the Assembly on the same 10 August. Roederer himself fell under suspicion and went into hiding during the Reign of Terror, emerging again only after the fall of Maximilien Robespierre and the start of the Thermidorian Reaction.

===Consulate, Empire, and later life===

In 1796, he was made a member of the Académie française, was appointed to a professorship of political economy, and founded the &quot;Journal d&#x27;économie publique, de morale et de legislation&quot;. Having escaped deportation at the time of the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Fructidor, he took part in organizing Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s 18 Brumaire Coup—alongside Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély, and Count Volnay—and wrote the &quot;Adresse aux Parisiens&quot; (Napoleon&#x27;s speech to the people of Paris, given immediately after the coup).

He was appointed by Napoleon member of the council of state and senator. Roederer and Talleyrand contributed to Charles-François Lebrun&#x27;s rise past Sieyès, and the former&#x27;s appointment as Consul. In 1800, Roederer was Minister Plenipotentiary to the Batavian and Helvetic Republics. He received the Legion of Honor in 1803, and was made a &quot;Grand Officier&quot; in December 1807.

Under the Empire, Roederer, whose public influence was very considerable, was Joseph Bonaparte&#x27;s minister of finance in the Kingdom of Naples (1806), assistant of Joseph in Spain (1809), administrator of the Grand Duchy of Berg (1810), and imperial commissary in the south of France. During the Hundred Days he was created a Peer of France.

The Bourbon Restoration government stripped him of his offices and dignities, and he became mayor of La Ferté-sous-Jouarre in April 1816. He recovered the title of Peer in 1832, following the July Revolution of 1830. He died in Bursard, Orne.

<doc id="841643" wikidata="Q3069874" url="?curid=841643" title="Caribana">
<text>The Toronto Caribbean Carnival, formerly and affectionately known as Caribana, is a festival of Caribbean culture and traditions held each summer in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is a pan-Caribbean Carnival event and has been billed as North America&#x27;s largest Festival, frequented by over 1.3 million tourists each year for the festival&#x27;s Grand Parade and an overall attendance of 2.3 million.

Beginning in July, the multi-week festivities lead up to the parade which occurs over the Simcoe Day long weekend, the first weekend in August. The festival also coincides with August 1 Emancipation Day observances that commemorate the emancipation of slaves of African descent. The main stakeholders of the events are the Toronto Mas&#x27; Bands Association, the Organization of Calypso Performing Artistes, and the Ontario Steelpan Association.

==Events==
Several events occur over the course of the festivities celebrating Caribbean culture. While the Parade of Bands is the most-well known festivities, events vary per year and in the past has included exhibits (for example the first Caribana displayed every book published by a Caribbean writer, including Austin Clarke who was the centrepiece of the exhibition); theatre plays (such as Austin Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Children of the Scheme&quot; which dealt with the plight of Caribbean women who came to Canada on the domestic immigrant worker scheme); and fashion shows.

===Grand Parade===
While the Caribbean Festival holds events over several weeks, the culmination of the Caribana event is the final weekend which is punctuated by the street Parade of Bands. This weekend traditionally coincides with the civic holiday in August. The street Parade of Bands consists of costumed dancers (called &quot;Mas players&quot;) along with live Caribbean music being played from large speakers on the flat-bed of 18 wheeler trucks. Much of the music associated with the event, such as steel pan, soca and calypso. Floats can also be found which play chutney, dancehall and reggae music.

The bands are the most important part of the main Carnival parade. Each band displays an artistic theme through costume-making. In competition with one another during the parade, they pass a judging spot which will rate each band section for its costume design, the energy of masqueraders, the creativity of presentation and so on. Work on the costumes begin soon after the previous year&#x27;s celebration and usually takes one full year to complete all of the costumes. As of 2017, Whitfield Belasco has led a band since his brother recruited him from the Trinidad Carnival to help organize the first Caribana in 1967. Louis Saldenah has actively participated in Caribana since 1977 and has been awarded the Band of the Year twenty times. A King and Queen of the Band is also judged, and winning is considered claiming the biggest prize of the festival.

In the 1970s, the parade route originally followed Bloor and Yonge Streets ending at Toronto City Hall concluding with a concert at Nathan Phillips Square. In the 1980s, the parade ran along Bay and University Avenue. Since 1991, when the parade shifted to Lake Shore Boulevard into Exhibition Place, In 1993, the Caribana Marketplace covered market was added at Marilyn Bell Park along the parade route. In 2009, barricades were introduced to separate the spectators from those playing mas.

In May 2010, the festival added a new initiative to involve post-secondary schools. The only college to participate was Centennial College School of Hospitality, Tourism and Culture, where they created a costume theme of the Tropical Amazon.


=== King and Queen Showcase ===
The night before the grande parade, all the kings and queens (leaders) of the bands compete on stage at Lamport Stadium to be named King and Queen of Carnival. Joella Crichton has been awarded Queen of the Carnival nine times and was subject of &quot;Becoming a Queen&quot; a ninety minute documentary which screened at the CaribbeanTales International Film Festival.



=== Calypso Monarch ===
Started in 1980, this judged event crowns a Calypso Monarch for the year.


===J&#x27;ouvert===
In addition to the main parade, the Caribbean community also celebrates a smaller pre-dawn parade known as J&#x27;ouvert (Pronounced &quot;Jou-vay&quot;). This too has been modelled after Trinidad Carnival. In Caribbean French-creole this means &quot;day open&quot; or morning. The J&#x27;ouvert portion of Carnival is the more rhythmic part of the Carnival celebration and is usually featured with steelpan bands, and persons using improvised musical instruments. It is not usually accompanied by any singing but will have a lot of whistles and other music makers. Spectators and or persons &quot;playing Mas&quot; will occasionally get themselves covered from head-to-toe with mud, flour, baby powder, or different water-colored paints in the tradition of the Caribbean-based J&#x27;ouvert celebrations. In many instances, everyone in the band is supposed to resemble evil spirits while parading around at night. There are some common characters that are a part of Afro-Caribbean folklore and include things like Red Devils (people covered in red paints), Blue Devils (people covered in blue paints), Green devils, Black devils ( Jab Jab -traditionally portrayed in the Island of Grenada), Yellow devils, White devils, (usually people throwing baby powder or flour.) or people just covered in other concoctions which are supposed to resemble mud or oil.

=== Other events ===
* Junior Carnival Parade: The junior carnival (commonly known as Kiddie Carnival) has run since, at least, the 1990s and provides an opportunity for young masquerades to dance through the streets. Similar to the grand parade, the junior carnival consists of a series of bands with leaders who display costumes in competition.
* Junior King and Queen Showcase: This was introduced in 2017 to allow the Younger kids to showcase Jr King and Queen&#x27;s at Malvern Town Centre before the Jr Grand Parade &amp; Family Day.
* Fêtes (parties): Leading up to the main parade a number of Caribbean music artists perform in Toronto. These parties are generally called &quot;fêtes&quot;, for a French-Creole Caribbean word meaning &quot;festival&quot;, and usually start in June/July.
* Jump-ups (dances)
* Picnics (Food Fest): Originally taking place on the Toronto Islands, the island picnics now occur at Ontario Place. Picnics are two days of feasting on rotis, jerk chicken and festival, callaloo, goat head soup, potato pudding, pelau, fried fish, cow foot, rum cakes; drinking sorrell, Mauby, and ginger beer; and dancing to music.
* Calypso tents (shows)
* Talk tents: Talk tents contain shows featuring storytellers, comedians and others well versed in oral traditions.
* Gala (Carnival Ball): The gala, debuted in 2008, is an evening of elegance celebrating Carnival music, arts, and the works of the pioneers of the Caribana festival.
* Pan blockos/blockorama (steel band street parties)

==History==
=== Origins ===

Caribana has run annually since 1967, first performed as a gift from Canada&#x27;s Caribbean community, as a tribute to Canada&#x27;s Centennial. Billing itself as a multicultural nation, the Canadian government invited ethno-cultural groups to contribute celebrations with representations of their ethnic diversity. Caribana emerged during a time when many Caribbean residents emigrated to Canada following immigration reform, internationally acclaimed singers were popularizing Caribbean music (for example Harry Belafonte sang to a sold-out crowd at the O&#x27;Keefe Centre in Toronto), Civil Rights Movement activities including the Canadian visits by Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., and Muhammad Ali&#x27;s fight against the Canadian heavyweight champion George Chuvalo.

Introduced by immigrants from the Caribbean, Caribana showcases multiple cultures and traditions from same heritage backgrounds coming together to celebrate their heritage ties (namely, Afro-Caribbeana persons of African descent born or living in a Caribbean nation). Caribana&#x27;s roots has links to slavery and the struggle for emancipation, as well as post-colonial pan-Caribbean influence of the 1960s. Following the carnival format, particularly that of the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival, Caribana&#x27;s Caribbean influences include traditions from many of the islands: John Canoe in Jamaica, Crop Over in Barbados, and other similar festivals in Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

Caribana also taps into the legacy of the pre-Lenten Calypso Carnival celebrations organized by the Canadian Negro Women&#x27;s Organization (CANEWA) and headed by Kay Livingstone. From 1952 to 1964, CANEWA produced, funded, and hosted these annual one-day celebrations of Caribbean culture through food, dance, and music as fundraisers for scholarships to assist Black students to attend recently desegregated schools in southern Ontario.

The centuries-long Black Canadian tradition of Emancipation Day parades are also an influence on Caribana. Emancipation Day Parades began to celebrate the liberation of the enslaved throughout the Americas and were largely observed around the same time as the Calypso Carnivals. The founders of this parade were largely descendants of fugitive slaves and other Black American immigrants. The parades were marked as a Black victory over the British and operated as a military-style event, displaying military regalia, marching bands, and drum corps. Emancipation Day Parades became the most notable displays by and for Black Canadians prior to Caribana.

The founding organizers&#x27; goal of using festival profits to create a Black community centre remain unfulfilled.

===Administrative history===
Plans for the first Caribana began in February 1966, when a group from Toronto’s West Indian community came together in an abandoned firehall on Bathurst Street and formed a celebration for Canada’s centennial. The group, originally named the Caribbean Centennial Committee, transformed into the Caribbean Committee for Cultural Advancement (CCAC) in 1968 when they decided that the event should be an annual celebration. One year later, the CCAC incorporated as the Caribbean Cultural Committee (CCC).
This group consisted of ten individuals with its board members mostly made up of expatriate-Caribbean nationals living in Canada. One of these members was Trinidadian-born librarian Rita Cox. Charles Roach and Julius Alexander Isaac (the first Black judge of the Federal Court of Appeal) were among the community leaders who organized the first Caribana. The CCC changed its name to the Caribbean Committee for Cultural Advancement (CCCA) in 1968 and Caribbean Cultural Committee (CCC) in 1969.

In 1970, the Carnival Development Association (CDA) organized a different festival under the name “Carnival Extravaganza.” The Carnival was created in response to the CCC&#x27;s Caribana, which celebrated a pan-Caribbean culture and the Black Canadian identity. The CDA’s intention was to make a Carnival which was more “authentic” and reflected Trinidadian culture. In 1974 and 1976, the province turned down an application by the CCC and gave a substantial sum to the CDA.

By 1980, the two organizing committees came together and the CCC once again was the sole organizing committee of Caribana. During this decade, the competing interests of the Metro police, city officials, and the corporate sponsors of Caribana threatened to overshadow the CCC&#x27;s leadership. For example, in 1985, the police recommended moving the popular Olympic Island picnic event to the mainland but the picnics continued until 2009.

In 1991, the Caribana parade was moved to Exhibition Place and Lakeshore Boulevard. Previously, participants jumped up and played mas down Yonge Street or University Avenue on their way to the Toronto Islands.

As the festival became a permanent annual event, the festival organization became dependent on borrowing money from the City of Toronto prior to the festival, to be repaid out of festival profits (if any) afterwards. By 1992, the festival had built up a debt to the City. The City of Toronto forgave the entire outstanding debt after the 1992 event. The same year, Caribana developed a new partnership with Toronto-area hotels. In 1993, the organization fired its operating chief. Following Puff Daddy&#x27;s performance in 1997, many observers raised concerns regarding cultural retention and festival organizers&#x27; moral-cultural responsibility. At launch in Nathan Phillips Square, Premier Bob Rae calls the event a &quot;beacon of hope&quot; for all Canadians, as a symbol of racial harmony. &quot;Carry a Can to Caribana&quot; launched, in support of Daily Bread Food Bank. With attendance down, the board chair blamed the federal and provincial tourism ministries for not funding their American advertising campaign.

In 1997, the bandleaders threatened to boycott the parade if they were not paid for the year’s previous festival and provided with the necessary seed-money to fund production for 1997. The bandleaders were organized under the Ontario Mas Producers Association (OMPA) and the Toronto Mas Makers Association (TMMA). The OMPA would become the Toronto Mas Band Association (TMBA) in 2000.

By the early 2000s, several organizations formed which represented different groups involved in Caribana. The TMBA oversaw the making and promotion of mas bands and represented their interests. The Ontario Steelpan Association (OSA), organized in 2002, did the same for the steelpan musicians. These associations, which also included the Ontario Calypso Performing Artistes (OCPA), formed in 1981, became key stakeholders in Caribana.

In 2001, the City of Toronto granted permits for the TMBA to organize the parade. In 2002, the parade and king and queen crowning were also organized by the TMBA. The following year, the CCC was again the sole organizer of Caribana’s events.

In September 2004, after the 37th festival, the consul general of Trinidad and Tobago worked with Caribbean Cultural Committee to increase support from the business community; the committee received around that year from the national, provincial, and city governments, but it cost about twice that to run the festival. In 2006, the City of Toronto government, unsatisfied by the CCC&#x27;s financial audit report, invited the TMBA to apply for funding to operate and manage Caribana for 2006. In the end, a city-appointed committee, the Festival Management Committee (FMC), in arrangement with the CCC board members, agreed to organize Caribana for one year. The proposed structure of the FMC’s board of directors was to include: two representatives from the TMBA, one representative from the OSA, one representative from the CPA, and seven additional members chosen by the festival’s stakeholders, including the CCC. The Caribana Arts Group (CAG), which succeeded the CCC in 2005, applied but was denied funding to resume its organization of Caribana. In 2006, the FMC board included two members of the CAG; however, both representatives withdrew from the board in 2010.

Due to an ongoing dispute about the ownership of the trademark &quot;Caribana,&quot; the 2006 festival was promoted as &quot;the Toronto Caribbean Carnival (Caribana)&quot;. In 2009, the festival was advertised as the &quot;Scotiabank Caribana Festival&quot; which resulted in a trademark lawsuit from CAG, as Caribana was trademarked in 1977, following unsuccessful attempts to reach a licensing agreement. As the successor organization of the CCC, the CAG is the trademark holder to &quot;Caribana.&quot; Following the settlement of the trademark infringement in 2011, the festival’s name was changed to &quot;Scotiabank Caribbean Carnival.&quot; The name changed to &quot;Toronto Caribbean Carnival&quot; in 2015 when Scotiabank discontinued their sponsorship.

In 2019 UNESCO the Canadian Commission officially recognizes the festival and names it a Cultural heritage property.

===Naming dispute===
The name Caribana was invented by the organizers to capture the notions of Canada, the Caribbean, bacchanal and merrymaking. A naming dispute arose over the use of &quot;Caribana.&quot; The Caribbean Cultural Committee claimed that it legally held the trademark for &quot;Caribana&quot;. In April 2010, a panel for the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) ruled that Scotiabank, as the sponsors of the Caribana festival, did not have grounds for being awarded the domain name caribana.com from its current owners the Working Word Co-operative. In 2011, the Ontario Superior Court Of Justice ruled that the Caribana Arts Group (CAG), the successors of Caribbean Cultural Committee (CCC), has legal rights to the name Caribana.

===Sponsorship===
The first named festival sponsor was Scotiabank (&quot;Scotiabank Caribana&quot; from 2007 to 2011 and &quot;Scotiabank Toronto Caribbean Carnival&quot; from 2011 to 2015). In October 2015, Scotiabank announced that it would end its sponsorship with Toronto&#x27;s Caribbean Carnival parade after six years.

The festival continued without a naming sponsor until 2017, when Peeks became the new title sponsor and the festival became the Peeks Toronto Caribbean Carnival. In June 2019, Peeks&#x27; title sponsorship was removed and the festival was called the Toronto Caribbean Carnival for 2019.
=== COVID-19 alternative formats ===
The 2020 and 2021 editions of the event were cancelled because of the global COVID-19 pandemic; consequently, it took place in a &quot;virtual format&quot; on July 3, 2020. In order to accommodate restrictions during the pandemic during the summer of 2021, the festival pivoted to a foodie event with steel pans and masqueraders and replaced the grande parade with a food truck festival.

== Economics and impact ==
The entire event, which is one of the first Caribbean Carnivals along with those in New York City, Notting Hill and Boston to be held outside of the Caribbean region. Economic studies estimate that the festival contributes approximately $400 million into Ontario&#x27;s economy each year with the Federal Government being the largest beneficiary. The participation demographics of over 1.2 million attendees indicates that 58% of attendees are from outside the Greater Toronto Area and over one million individuals from the United States. Approximately 72% of participants have previously attended Caribana.

<text>Harry Sacksioni (born 23 October 1950, in Amsterdam) is a composer and guitar virtuoso of Dutch origin. The peak of his fame was during the 1970s to 1990s. Famous works of this period include &quot;Meta Sequoia&quot;, &quot;Vensters&quot; and &quot;Elixer&quot;, along with re-arrangements of existing pieces, such as &quot;Anji&quot; (Davy Graham), &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; (arr. Paul Simon) and I Wish (Stevie Wonder). Sacksioni&#x27;s work is mainly instrumental, although some tracks during the 1980s provided guitar accompaniments to vocals provided by himself and Raymond van het Groenewoud.

Sacksioni was one of the artists who recorded the song &quot;Shalom from Holland&quot; (written by Simon Hammelburg and Ron Klipstein) as a token of solidarity to the Israeli people, threatened by missiles from Iraq, during the first Gulf War in 1991.

Sacksioni&#x27;s work is not commercially motivated, and as a result, he is not often featured in the mainstream media. His records appear under an independent, privately owned label Katowee (from &quot;cutaway,&quot; a feature of some guitars) as a protest against the high prices of CDs.

Sacksioni uses various guitars during a live concert. When touring, he chooses instruments from his collection of acoustic and electric guitars to suit the venue and programme. He plays both 6 and 12-string guitars, both acoustic and electric. An unusual guitar of his is a hand-built double guitar: one half is electric and the other half is acoustic.

Sacksioni has been living in Lienden, Netherlands, since the 1980s. Before that, he lived in Amsterdam.

Harry Sacksioni was made a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau, decorated by Klaas Tammes, mayor of the municipality of Buren, during a concert in the Agnietenhof in Tiel on 9 May 2009. On his 60th birthday, Harry was given a tribute concert by a number of musical colleagues in the famous Amsterdam venue Carré.

<doc id="841665" wikidata="Q3061885" url="?curid=841665" title="Exec Shield">
<text>Exec Shield is a project started at Red Hat, Inc in late 2002 with the aim of reducing the risk of worm or other automated remote attacks on Linux systems. The first result of the project was a security patch for the Linux kernel that emulates an NX bit on x86 CPUs that lack a native NX implementation in hardware. While the Exec Shield project has had many other components, some people refer to this first patch as Exec Shield.

The first Exec Shield patch attempts to flag data memory as non-executable and program memory as non-writeable. This suppresses many security exploits, such as those stemming from buffer overflows and other techniques relying on overwriting data and inserting code into those structures. Exec Shield also supplies some address space layout randomization for the mmap() and heap base.

The patch additionally increases the difficulty of inserting and executing shellcode, rendering most exploits ineffective. No application recompilation is necessary to fully utilize exec-shield, although some applications (Mono, Wine, XEmacs, Mplayer) are not fully compatible.

Other features that came out of the Exec Shield project were the Position Independent Executables (PIE), the address space randomization patch for Linux kernels, a wide set of glibc internal security checks that make heap and format string exploits near impossible, the GCC Fortify Source feature, and the port and merge of the GCC stack-protector feature.

== Implementation ==
Exec Shield works on all x86 CPUs utilizing the Code Segment limit. Because of the way Exec Shield works, it is very lightweight; however, it won&#x27;t fully protect arbitrary virtual memory layouts. If the CS limit is raised, for example by calling mprotect() to make higher memory executable, then the protections are lost below that limit. Ingo Molnar points this out in an e-mail conversation. Most applications are fairly sane at this; the stack (the important part) at least winds up above any mapped libraries, so does not become executable except by explicit calls by the application.

As of August, 2004, nothing from the Exec Shield projects attempt to enforce memory protections by restricting mprotect() on any architecture; although memory may not initially be executable, it may become executable later, so the kernel will allow an application to mark memory pages as both writable and executable at the same time. However, in cooperation with the Security-Enhanced Linux project (SELinux), the standard policy for the Fedora Core distribution does prohibit this behavior for most executables, with only a few exceptions for compatibility reasons.
== History ==
Exec Shield was developed by various people at Red Hat; the first patch was released by Ingo Molnar of Red Hat and first released in May 2003. It is part of Fedora Core 1 through 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux since version 3. Other people involved include Jakub Jelínek, Ulrich Drepper, Richard Henderson and Arjan van de Ven.

Molnar commented in 2007 on LWN.net that &quot;bits of [exec-shield] went upstream, but a fair chunk didn&#x27;t.&quot;

<doc id="841685" wikidata="Q1365281" url="?curid=841685" title="Tractrix">
<text>In geometry, a tractrix (; plural: tractrices) is the curve along which an object moves, under the influence of friction, when pulled on a horizontal plane by a line segment attached to a pulling point (the &quot;tractor&quot;) that moves at a right angle to the initial line between the object and the puller at an infinitesimal speed. It is therefore a curve of pursuit. It was first introduced by Claude Perrault in 1670, and later studied by Isaac Newton (1676) and Christiaan Huygens (1693).

==Mathematical derivation==

Suppose the object is placed at and the puller at the origin, so that is the length of the pulling thread. (In the example shown to the right, the value of is 4.) Suppose the puller starts to move along the axis in the positive direction. At every moment, the thread will be tangent to the curve described by the object, so that it becomes completely determined by the movement of the puller. Mathematically, if the coordinates of the object are , then by the Pythagorean theorem the of the puller is formula_1 . Writing that the slope of thread equals that of the tangent to the curve leads to the differential equation
:formula_2
with the initial condition . Its solution is
:formula_3
If instead the puller moves downward from the origin, then the sign should be removed from the
differential equation and therefore inserted into the solution. Each of the two solutions defines a branch of the tractrix; they meet at the cusp point .

The first term of this solution can also be written 
:formula_4 
where is the inverse hyperbolic secant function.

==Basis of the tractrix==
The essential property of the tractrix is constancy of the distance between a point on the curve and the intersection of the tangent line at with the asymptote of the curve.
The tractrix might be regarded in a multitude of ways:
# It is the locus of the center of a hyperbolic spiral rolling (without skidding) on a straight line.
# It is the involute of the catenary function, which describes a fully flexible, inelastic, homogeneous string attached to two points that is subjected to a gravitational field. The catenary has the equation .
#The trajectory determined by the middle of the back axle of a car pulled by a rope at a constant speed and with a constant direction (initially perpendicular to the vehicle).
# It is a (non-linear) curve which a circle of radius rolling on a straight line, with its center at the axis, intersects perpendicularly at all times.

The function admits a horizontal asymptote. The curve is symmetrical with respect to the -axis. The curvature radius is .

A great implication that the tractrix had was the study of its surface of revolution about its asymptote: the pseudosphere. Studied by Eugenio Beltrami in 1868, as a surface of constant negative Gaussian curvature, the pseudosphere is a local model of hyperbolic geometry. The idea was carried further by Kasner and Newman in their book &quot;Mathematics and the Imagination&quot;, where they show a toy train dragging a pocket watch to generate the tractrix.

==Properties==
*The curve can be parameterised by the equation formula_5.
* Due to the geometrical way it was defined, the tractrix has the property that the segment of its tangent, between the asymptote and the point of tangency, has constant length .
* The arc length of one branch between and is .
* The area between the tractrix and its asymptote is , which can be found using integration or Mamikon&#x27;s theorem.
* The envelope of the normals of the tractrix (that is, the evolute of the tractrix) is the catenary (or &quot;chain curve&quot;) given by .
* The surface of revolution created by revolving a tractrix about its asymptote is a pseudosphere.
* The tractrix is a transcendental curve; it cannot be defined by a polynomial equation.

==Practical application==
In 1927, P. G. A. H. Voigt patented a horn loudspeaker design based on the assumption that a wave front traveling through the horn is spherical of a constant radius. The idea is to minimize distortion caused by internal reflection of sound within the horn. The resulting shape is the surface of revolution of a tractrix. Voigt&#x27;s design removed the annoying &quot;honk&quot; characteristic from previous horn designs, especially conical horns, and thus revitalized interest in the horn loudspeaker. Klipsch Audio Technologies has used the tractrix design for the great majority of their loudspeakers, and many loudspeaker designers returned to the tractrix in the 21st century, creating an audiophile market segment. The tractrix horn differs from the more common exponential horn in that it provides for a wider spread of high frequency energy, and it supports the lower frequencies more strongly.

An important application is in the forming technology for sheet metal. In particular a tractrix profile is used for the corner of the die on which the sheet metal is bent during deep drawing.

A toothed belt-pulley design provides improved efficiency for mechanical power transmission using a tractrix catenary shape for its teeth. This shape minimizes the friction of the belt teeth engaging the pulley, because the moving teeth engage and disengage with minimal sliding contact. Original timing belt designs used simpler trapezoidal or circular tooth shapes, which cause significant sliding and friction.

==Drawing machines==
* In October–November 1692, Christiaan Huygens described three tractrix-drawing machines.
* In 1693 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz devised a &quot;universal tractional machine&quot; which, in theory, could integrate any first order differential equation. The concept was an analog computing mechanism implementing the tractional principle. The device was impractical to build with the technology of Leibniz&#x27;s time, and was never realized.
* In 1706 John Perks built a tractional machine in order to realise the hyperbolic quadrature.
* In 1729 Giovanni Poleni built a tractional device that enabled logarithmic functions to be drawn.
A history of all these machines can be seen in an article by H. J. M. Bos.

<doc id="841689" wikidata="Q1397439" url="?curid=841689" title="Pullback (category theory)">
<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a pullback (also called a fiber product, fibre product, fibered product or Cartesian square) is the limit of a diagram consisting of two morphisms and with a common codomain. The pullback is written

Usually the morphisms and are omitted from the notation, and then the pullback is written

The pullback comes equipped with two natural morphisms and . The pullback of two morphisms and need not exist, but if it does, it is essentially uniquely defined by the two morphisms. In many situations, may intuitively be thought of as consisting of pairs of elements with in , in , and . For the general definition, a universal property is used, which essentially expresses the fact that the pullback is the &quot;most general&quot; way to complete the two given morphisms to a commutative square.

The dual concept of the pullback is the &quot;pushout&quot;.

==Universal property==
Explicitly, a pullback of the morphisms formula_1 and formula_2 consists of an object formula_3 and two morphisms formula_4 and formula_5 for which the diagram

commutes. Moreover, the pullback must be universal with respect to this diagram. That is, for any other such triple where and are morphisms with , there must exist a unique such that 

:formula_6
This situation is illustrated in the following commutative diagram.

As with all universal constructions, a pullback, if it exists, is unique up to isomorphism. In fact, given two pullbacks and of the same cospan , there is a unique isomorphism between and respecting the pullback structure.

==Pullback and product==
The pullback is similar to the product, but not the same. One may obtain the product by &quot;forgetting&quot; that the morphisms and exist, and forgetting that the object exists. One is then left with a discrete category containing only the two objects and , and no arrows between them. This discrete category may be used as the index set to construct the ordinary binary product. Thus, the pullback can be thought of as the ordinary (Cartesian) product, but with additional structure. Instead of &quot;forgetting&quot; , , and , one can also &quot;trivialize&quot; them by specializing to be the terminal object (assuming it exists). and are then uniquely determined and thus carry no information, and the pullback of this cospan can be seen to be the product of and .

==Examples==
===Commutative rings===

In the category of commutative rings (with identity), the pullback is called the fibered product. Let , , and be commutative rings (with identity) and and (identity preserving) ring homomorphisms. Then the pullback of this diagram exists and is given by the subring of the product ring defined by 

:formula_7

along with the morphisms 

:formula_8 

given by formula_9 and formula_10 for all formula_11. We then have

:formula_12

=== Groups and modules ===
In complete analogy to the example of commutative rings above, one can show that all pullbacks exist in the category of groups and in the category of modules over some fixed ring.

===Sets===
In the category of sets, the pullback of functions and always exists and is given by the set

:formula_13

together with the restrictions of the projection maps and to .

Alternatively one may view the pullback in asymmetrically:

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the disjoint union of sets (the involved sets are not disjoint on their own unless resp. is injective). In the first case, the projection extracts the index while forgets the index, leaving elements of .

This example motivates another way of characterizing the pullback: as the equalizer of the morphisms where is the binary product of and and and are the natural projections. This shows that pullbacks exist in any category with binary products and equalizers. In fact, by the existence theorem for limits, all finite limits exist in a category with binary products and equalizers; equivalently, all finite limits exist in a category with terminal object and pullbacks (by the fact that binary product is equal to pullback on the terminal object, and that an equalizer is a pullback involving binary product).

====Graphs of functions====
A specific example of a pullback is given by the graph of a function. Suppose that formula_16 is a function. The &quot;graph&quot; of is the set
formula_17
The graph can be reformulated as the pullback of and the identity function on . By definition, this pullback is
formula_18
and this equals formula_19.

===Fiber bundles===
Another example of a pullback comes from the theory of fiber bundles: given a bundle map and a continuous map , the pullback (formed in the category of topological spaces with continuous maps) is a fiber bundle over called the pullback bundle. The associated commutative diagram is a morphism of fiber bundles. A special case is the pullback of two fiber bundles . In this case is a fiber bundle over , and pulling back along the diagonal map gives a space homeomorphic (diffeomorphic) to , which is a fiber bundle over . All statements here hold true for differentiable manifolds as well. Differentiable maps and are transverse if and only if their product is transverse to the diagonal of . Thus, the pullback of two transverse differentiable maps into the same differentiable manifold is also a differentiable manifold, and the tangent space of the pullback is the pullback of the tangent spaces along the differential maps. 

===Preimages and intersections===
Preimages of sets under functions can be described as pullbacks as follows: 

Suppose , . Let be the inclusion map . Then a pullback of and (in ) is given by the preimage together with the inclusion of the preimage in 

and the restriction of to 

Because of this example, in a general category the pullback of a morphism and a monomorphism can be thought of as the &quot;preimage&quot; under of the subobject specified by . Similarly, pullbacks of two monomorphisms can be thought of as the &quot;intersection&quot; of the two subobjects.

===Least common multiple===
Consider the multiplicative monoid of positive integers as a category with one object. In this category, the pullback of two positive integers and is just the pair formula_20, where the numerators are both the least common multiple of and . The same pair is also the pushout.

==Properties==
*In any category with a terminal object , the pullback is just the ordinary product .
*Monomorphisms are stable under pullback: if the arrow in the diagram is monic, then so is the arrow . Similarly, if is monic, then so is .
*Isomorphisms are also stable, and hence, for example, for any map (where the implied map is the identity).
* In an abelian category all pullbacks exist, and they preserve kernels, in the following sense: if
::
:is a pullback diagram, then the induced morphism is an isomorphism, and so is the induced morphism . Every pullback diagram thus gives rise to a commutative diagram of the following form, where all rows and columns are exact:
formula_21
:Furthermore, in an abelian category, if is an epimorphism, then so is its pullback , and symmetrically: if is an epimorphism, then so is its pullback . In these situations, the pullback square is also a pushout square.

*There is a natural isomorphism (&quot;A&quot;×&quot;C&quot;&quot;B&quot;)×&quot;B&quot; &quot;D&quot; ≅ &quot;A&quot;×&quot;C&quot;&quot;D&quot;. Explicitly, this means: 
** if maps &quot;f&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;C&quot;, &quot;g&quot; : &quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot; and &quot;h&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;B&quot; are given and 
** the pullback of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is given by &quot;r&quot; : &quot;P&quot; → &quot;A&quot; and &quot;s&quot; : &quot;P&quot; → &quot;B&quot;, and
** the pullback of &quot;s&quot; and &quot;h&quot; is given by &quot;t&quot; : &quot;Q&quot; → &quot;P&quot; and &quot;u&quot; : &quot;Q&quot; → &quot;D&quot; , 
** then the pullback of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;gh&quot; is given by &quot;rt&quot; : &quot;Q&quot; → &quot;A&quot; and &quot;u&quot; : &quot;Q&quot; → &quot;D&quot;. 
:Graphically this means that two pullback squares, placed side by side and sharing one morphism, form a larger pullback square when ignoring the inner shared morphism.
formula_22

* Any category with pullbacks and products has equalizers.

== Weak pullbacks ==
A weak pullback of a cospan is a cone over the cospan that is only weakly universal, that is, the mediating morphism above is not required to be unique.

<doc id="841691" wikidata="Q124375" url="?curid=841691" title="Hódmezővásárhely">
<text>Hódmezővásárhely (; also known by other alternative names) is a city with county rights in southeast Hungary, on the Great Hungarian Plain, at the meeting point of the Békés-Csanádi Ridge and the clay grassland surrounding the river Tisza. In 2017, it had a population of 44,009.

==Etymology and names==
The city&#x27;s name, which literally translates as &quot;Beavers&#x27; Field Marketplace&quot;, was first mentioned after the unification of two Árpád-era villages, Hód and Vásárhely, the former getting its name from Beaver&#x27;s lake, an apocope of &quot;Hód-tó&quot; (now one of the city&#x27;s districts and the canal &quot;Hód-tavi-csatorna)&quot; and the latter coming from the mediaeval legal term marking settlements with the right of hosting markets and literally meaning market town. The middle term &quot;mező&quot;, which also refers to the city&#x27;s state as an &quot;oppidum&quot;, a city with certain rights that are given by its feudal ruler, was later added to the town and to its name.

The city is also known by alternative names in other languages: ; ; and .

==History==

===Prehistory===
There is evidence of human habitation close to the modern town dating back 6,000 years, and archaeological evidence suggests that the area has been continuously inhabited since then by a variety of different cultures. Neolithic dwellings recessed into the ground stored domestic items such as plates, as well as the &quot;Kökénydombi Vénusz&quot; fertility symbol. Remains have also been found from the Copper Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age and the great migrations period. The town&#x27;s archaeological treasures can now be seen at the permanent archaeological exhibition of the Tornyai János Museum.

===Medieval period===
At the end of the 8th century, the Avars found mostly remnants of the nomadic population and of the agrarian and animal-breeding Slavs.
Before the Mongol invasion of Hungary, at least seven villages with churches existed in the area. After the devastation caused by the Mongols, more villages were established, but these later became victims of the Turkish invasion. The territories of these villages were later absorbed by Hódmezővásárhely as the town grew. Evidence of more than twenty villages and churches from the Middle Ages have been found.

The present town of Hódmezővásárhely developed in the 15th century when Hód, Vásárhely, Tarján, and Ábrány, once small villages, became joined and the market town was established. The town is known to have been called Hódvásárhely in 1437. The town&#x27;s location next to the road leading from Csongrád to Csanád was advantageous for the development of trade. In the Middle Ages markets, and particularly the trade in livestock, fuelled its growth.

Hódmezővásárhely was part of Csongrád comitatus. Part of that county was under Turkish control after 1542. The region between the Tisza and the Danube belonged to the Ottoman Empire, while the area to the east of the Tisza, including Hódmezővásárhely, belonged to Transylvania. After the military expedition of 1552, the whole of Csongrád county was taken by the Turks. The entire area was devastated by the Turkish offensive in 1566. The region was occupied by the Turks for the next 150 years.

===Independence===
At the time of the Rákóczi war of independence (1703–1711), the town was under the control of Count Miklós Bercsényi. The royal court confiscated the estate and gave it to imperial general Leopold Schlick. During the war of independence, Miklós Bercsényi seized the town back and gave it to the Kuruts general Sándor Károlyi for leasehold. The royal court in Vienna did not accept Károlyi&#x27;s claim to the territory after the peace of Szatmár and he was only able to retrieve it by buying it back years later. From 1722 to 1818, when landowner jurisdiction was abolished, the Károlyi family possessed the town.

In the 1848–49 fights for freedom, Hódmezővásárhely played a significant part in national events. Lajos Kossuth reached the town on 3 October 1848 on his second recruiting trip. While there, he received the news that the Hungarian Army had been engaged in battle at Pákozd, and patriotic fervour gripped the town. Troops from Hódmezővásárhely took part in beating off the southern Serbian attacks.

After the control of the Theiss in the 1860s, the surrounding lakes and brooks dried up. The inner areas were progressively filled and the town&#x27;s population increased.

Hódmezővásárhely seceded from the county in 1873 and received independent municipal rights. The first signs of industrialisation were apparent from that time. In 1890 Hódmezővásárhely was the fourth largest Hungarian town with 55,475 inhabitants.

===20th century===
The modern picture of the town was established at the turn of the century. These decades were characterised by the construction of wells, dynamic building operations, and the construction of canals. 70 per cent of the population, however, was engaged in farming and animal breeding.

A typical system of settlement was established with a large system of detached farms. Animal breeding still dominated the livelihood of the inhabitants. Rural animal breeding was characterised by economic efficiency. Quality horse breeding, which was partly an export product and partly demanded by the needs of agriculture, was profitable. Poultry and egg production for the markets also flourished. Animal breeding was gradually replaced by extensive growing of corn, which became the basis of the town&#x27;s economy and employed large numbers of workers.

The First World War hindered the development of the town and its people suffered losses. The human costs of the war contributed to the social tension around this time which led to demonstrations in Vásárhely.

In the first decade of the Horthy era, there was a fairly good market for the town&#x27;s agricultural products. Although the war and the occupation debilitated the economy of the town, the possibilities for the sale of the high-quality corn increased. Pork breeding grew, as did the export of poultry. Dozens of medium-scale factories sprung up, but the great world economic crisis demolished this new-found prosperity. Unemployment increased, until a new economic boom in the late 1930s.

The Second World War interrupted the development again. Soviet troops reached the town on 25 September 1944. Most of the powerful and well-off citizens escaped from Vásárhely. The war surged through the town on 8 October. The damage in human lives and buildings was not so huge as the damage to industrial equipment and infrastructure.

At the end of the 1960s giant factories were established. Full employment was realised but the town&#x27;s industry proved inefficient. Political and economic bankruptcy, however, only emerged at the end of the 1980s.

After the transition in 1990, Hódmezővásárhely became a municipal town of county rank. After the municipal elections, its government was established.

The town is now a destination for foreign and domestic tourism. Museums, churches, triumphal wells, statues, parks, and a thermal swimming hall are notable attractions.

== Politics ==
The mayor of Hódmezővásárhely István Almási (Fidesz-KDNP) died on 20 November 2017, leaving the position vacant. The independent candidate Péter Márki-Zay won the mayoral by-election on 25 February 2018. His unexpected victory against the Fidesz candidate received international attention and was seen as a possible indicator for a change in the Hungarian parliamentary election on 8 April 2018. The swing was not replicated in the parliamentary election.

The current mayor of Hódmezővásárhely is Péter Márki-Zay (Mindenki Magyarországa).

The local Municipal Assembly, elected at the 2019 local government elections, is made up of 15 members (1 Mayor, 10 Individual constituencies MEPs and 4 Compensation List MEPs) divided into this political parties and alliances:

<text>The Olentangy River is a tributary of the Scioto River in Ohio, United States.

==History==
It was originally called &quot;keenhongsheconsepung&quot;, a Delaware word literally translated as &quot;sharp tool river&quot;, based on the shale found along its shores. Early settlers to the region translated this into &quot;Whetstone River&quot;. In 1833, the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation intending to restore the original Native American names to some Ohio waterways, but mistakenly gave Whetstone River the name &quot;Olentangy&quot;—Delaware for &quot;river of the red face paint&quot;—which had actually belonged to what is now known as Big Darby Creek.
==Geography==
The Olentangy River rises in Morrow County approximately 2 mi (3.2 km) southeast of Galion, near Blooming Grove, flowing through Galion and northwest towards Bucyrus, where it then turns south and flows through Eastern Marion County, Ohio (where it is still locally known as the Whetstone River) before flowing south into Delaware County. The river continues southward towards the communities of Delaware, Powell, Worthington, and the village of Riverlea, before reaching Columbus, beginning with Clintonville and flowing through Old North Columbus, the campus of The Ohio State University, and the historic complex of neighborhoods to the south before merging with the Scioto River in the Arena District at location known as Confluence Park. The River’s western waterfront forms the right-of-way for the majority of SR 315. The original alignment of that route is known as Olentangy River Road, and some points north of the Columbus Outerbelt, where a freeway alignment was never built, still go by that name.

The Delaware State Park Reservoir, also known as Delaware Lake, was constructed along the Olentangy River in 1951. The reservoir is located 5 miles north of the city of Delaware, and was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood control purposes. On 13 January 2005, Delaware Dam was nearly overtopped. The water level came within less than 1 foot of the top of the dam, requiring the main spill gates to be opened before it began dropping.

The Olentangy River is the primary source of drinking water for much of Delaware County. Both the City of Delaware and Del-Co Water Company, the supplier of drinking water to most of rural Delaware County (and other communities beyond), draw the majority of their water supplies from the Olentangy system.

Twenty-two miles of the Olentangy have been designated a State Scenic River by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Natural Areas &amp; Preserves.

==Variant names==
The Olentangy River has also been known as Keenhongsheconsepung, Oleutangy, Whetstone Creek, Whetstone River, and Whitestone Creek.

== River restoration==

In 2012 the Ohio EPA and the City of Columbus began to remove some of the lowhead dams that cross the river. Work started with removing the 5th Avenue Dam. The river is now about half of its former width. Work continues to restore the banks and clean the area.

==Popular culture==
Broadcaster Keith Jackson would introduce Ohio State football games &quot;from the banks of the mighty Olentangy.&quot;

Beasley was born in 1935 in Tyler, Texas, the son of Browder Locke Beasley and Florence née Camp. He was raised in Clayton, Alabama, where his father ran a small grocery store.

Beasley received a Bachelor of Science degree from Auburn University and in 1958 married Sara Baker. He earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Alabama School of Law in 1962.

== Career ==
He worked for various law firms until he opened his own practice in 1965.

=== Alabama politics ===
In 1970, Beasley won the first round of the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor but he failed to win a majority. He won the runoff.

He was serving as 22nd Lieutenant Governor when Governor George Corley Wallace was shot and severely injured in an assassination attempt in Laurel, Maryland, on May 15, 1972. Since Wallace was out of state for more than 20 days, recovering in a Maryland hospital, the Alabama Constitution required that the lieutenant governor take over temporarily as acting governor.

In 1974, Beasley faced a challenge from Charles Woods, who finished first in the primary. Beasley, like in 1970, won the runoff. He sought the nomination for governor in 1978, placing fifth.

In 2009, Beasley served as the campaign chair for Alabama gubernatorial candidate Artur Davis.

===Private practice===
In 1978, Jere Beasley ran for governor, but his campaign was unsuccessful. He decided to leave politics and return to practicing law. After seeking advice from his friend and mentor, the civil rights leader and Federal Judge, Frank M. Johnson, he decided to start his new firm. Beasley was clear about his calling and the purpose of the firm. His new practice would be a safe harbor for those who need help. He would do what many lawyers refused to do at the time – take on powerful corporate interests for consumers and hard-working employees, or “the little man” as others have described. 

Founded on the principle of “helping those who need it most,” the firm was established to provide legal service to individuals and businesses whom no act of their own has wronged. That principle still serves as the bedrock for the firm&#x27;s work. The firm, known today as Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis &amp; Miles, P.C., has grown to more than 90 attorneys in Atlanta, Georgia; Mobile, Alabama; and Montgomery, Alabama and more than 200 support staff. On Jan. 7, 2024, Beasley Allen celebrated its 45th anniversary.

Beasley is noted as a trial lawyer, and his firm has a national reputation for winning major awards for its clients.

===Notable cases===
Beasley&#x27;s law firm has handed the following major cases:
* September 1993 – Tractor and heavy equipment manufacturer Kubota agreed to pay the family of 67-year-old retired farmer Durwood Spivey $10 million after the B-7100 Kubota tractor he was riding overturned, crushing him under the 2,500-pound weight of the machine. Kubota had not equipped the tractor with a rollover protection structure, despite such protection being available to the tractor industry since the 1950s.
* November 2003 – A Montgomery County jury ordered Exxon Mobil Corporation to pay the State of Alabama a record $11.8 billion in punitive damages as well as an additional $103 million in compensatory damages for intentionally and willfully underpaying royalties on natural gas from the Mobile Bay field. Exxon appealed and gained a reduction in the award to $3.6 billion.
* November 2007 – Pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co announced it would pay $4.85 billion to resolve claims that its anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx caused heart attacks, strokes and sudden cardiac death. The Vioxx settlement remains the largest pharmaceutical settlement in history.
* October 2013 – An Oklahoma City jury ordered Toyota Motor Corp. to pay Jean Bookout and the family of deceased passenger Barbara Schwartz $3 million in compensatory damages and an additional $1.5 million in punitive damages over claims that an electronic defect in Bookout&#x27;s 2005 Camry caused it to accelerate unintentionally and crash, seriously injuring Bookout and killing Schwartz.
* July 2015 - Beasley Allen represented the State of Alabama in a landmark agreement in principle with BP for damages caused by the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The agreement tagged the State of Alabama to receive more than $2 billion in total, including compensation for economic losses resulting from the spill, natural resource damages, and an apportionment of Clean Water Act civil fines and penalties. The agreement is part of a larger agreement that includes the Federal Government, four other Gulf States impacted by the oil spill –Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Florida – and local government entities. The deal is estimated to be worth approximately $18.7 billion, and should smash previous records as the largest environmental settlement in U.S. history.

===Community involvement===

Beasley is actively involved various civic endeavors, including the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, Lions Club and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

He is a member of the Staff Parish Relations for St. James United Methodist Church.

In 2006, Beasley was named “Citizen of the Year” by the March of Dimes.

In May 2018, Beasley was selected as the recipient of the Montgomery Sunrise Rotary Club’s public service achievement and contribution award, recognizing his dedication to helping others and improving the community and the River Region.

In 2018, Beasley Allen Law Firm was awarded the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s Montgomery Impact Maker Award for its revitalization efforts in downtown Montgomery and its overall contribution to the local community. The firm was instrumental in securing the Montgomery Biscuits minor league baseball team and for providing the land for the Montgomery Riverwalk Stadium, which was respectfully constructed by preserving a large section of the original historic building and built on land owned by the firm. When the stadium opened in 2004, it catalyzed downtown revitalization.

In 2018, the firm was also awarded the Landmarks Foundation of Montgomery&#x27;s James L. Loeb Preservation Award for its contribution to preserving Montgomery&#x27;s historic resources and heritage, specifically capitalizing on the distinctive architectural character of lower Commerce Street. The firm has purchased and renovated several buildings along Commerce Street, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 with boundary expansions in 1982 and 1987. 

In January 2020, Beasley received the Montgomery County Bar Association (MCBA) Service &amp; Achievement Award. The award was created to recognize Montgomery lawyers who have distinguished themselves through their exemplary service to the local community and bar. The honor is presented to a lawyer who demonstrates the highest standard of professionalism and is respected for outstanding legal ability.

<doc id="841714" wikidata="Q88961112" url="?curid=841714" title="Keio Flying Squadron 2">
<text>Keio Flying Squadron 2 is a 1996 Japanese video game for the Sega Saturn. Developed by Victor Entertainment, it is a direct sequel to &quot;Keio Flying Squadron&quot;. While the first game is a side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up, the second game is a platformer with shooter sections.

Like the first game, the second game refers to Japanese culture, both ancient and modern simultaneously.

==Plot==
A year has passed since the apocalyptic disaster known as the &quot;Ark Catastrophe&quot;, which left a great crater in the center of Edo. The destruction wrought major economic consequences and while much investment was poured into the public works for the new Edo Castle, the citizens were all feeling the pinch of the recession.

Dr. Pon Eho was no exception. Although a freak of nature with an astronomical IQ of 1400, hard reality forced the genius tanuki to become a laborer in the construction of the new castle. One day, while he was shoveling away some gravel near the center of the crater, he unearthed the Secret Treasure Scroll and one of the Six Magical Orbs (called Jewels in the Japanese version). With the knowledge that the six Orbs together would bring him an enormous amount of treasure, he quickly left his job in search of the remaining five Orbs listed on the Scroll&#x27;s map.

Meanwhile, Himiko Yamatai, &quot;the 13th Queen of Yamatai-koku&quot;, makes a dramatic appearance at the Nanahikari family&#x27;s dinner table and grabs the family&#x27;s Magical Orb. But before she can get away, Dr. Pon ambushes her and steals it. Of course, Rami makes chase and joins the race for the great treasure, starting her on her new adventure.

==Gameplay==
The game mainly consists of side-scrolling platformer stages. Two of the stages retain the shoot-&#x27;em-up style of the first game, but the Homing Spot Jrs. can be obtained as bonuses only. Besides the platformer and shoot-&#x27;em-up stages, there are vertically scrolling bonus stages, a rollercoaster stage and an underwater stage, classifying the game as a multi-genre platformer.

Several bonuses can be collected including three weapons:
*Atami - The Hammer of Dreams - A large mallet, used only for hitting enemies.
*Kinugawa - The Umbrella of Love - An umbrella, used to hit enemies, float and deflect overhead obstacles.
*Kusatsu - The Arrow of Hope - A bow and arrow set, used to shoot arrows at enemies.

Rami can also bounce on the heads of enemies to defeat them, as well as Kappas to reach higher places. Being damaged without holding an item results in the loss of a life. Background objects can be pick up and thrown at enemies to defeat them. Some background objects can also have a utility use. There are three difficulty levels which alter how many enemies there are to defeat and how quickly weapons disappear after being damaged.

Points Orbs can be collected throughout the game. Defeating some enemies also rewards points, but there are some enemies that are considered passive and will instead deduct points when defeated. A reward system accessed from the main menu unlocks helpful hints and behind-the-scenes extras depending on the highest and lowest scores achieved through playing.

==Characters==
Japanese names are given in the Western order, given name first.

*Rami Nanahikari - The grandchild of an ancient family and a descendant of aliens who came to Earth long ago. She wears a bunny suit, the formal attire of a Key Guardian. After her last adventure she was enjoying her life as an ordinary schoolgirl. However, now that she knows about the Secret Treasure, she has decided to join the battle between Dr. Pon and Himiko in search of it. Voiced by Miho Kanno (Japanese); Samantha Paris (English).
*Spot Nanahikari - The Nanahikari family&#x27;s pet dragon, who has become like a younger brother to Rami. Because he worked so hard in the first game, he became soporose and now sleeps and nods out whenever he can. In this game, he has a supporting role assisting Rami. Spot is called Pochi in the Japanese release of the game. Voiced by Mika Kanai (Japanese); Samantha Paris (English; cutscenes); Roger L. Jackson (English; gameplay).
*&quot;Grandma&quot; and &quot;Grandpa&quot; Nanahikari - Rami&#x27;s natural grandparents who have brought her up to be the next Key Guardian and belong to the Key Guardian Clan, who have been guarding the Key to the Secret Treasure and Magical Orb for generations. Two years ago, when they came to the realization that they no longer look very good in their bunny suits, they decided to resign their posts to Rami and enjoy their retirement. Voiced by Keiko Yamamoto (Japanese; Grandma), Jōji Yanami (Japanese; Grandpa); Roger L. Jackson (English; both).
*Dr. Pon Eho - A super intelligent tanuki with an IQ of 1400. He is critical of most humans, but on the other hand loves nature and is an ecologist who belongs to Greenpeace. He loves to buy new products that come on the market, but because he has no economical common sense, he is always broke. He always carries the part-time job section of the magazine. Voiced by Jōji Yanami (Japanese); Roger L. Jackson (English).
*Himiko Yamatai - The 13th Queen of Yamatai-koku (called the Pompous Queen of the Ancients in the English version) and Rami&#x27;s rival, who is in search of the Secret Treasure along with Rami and Dr. Pon. She believes that the Magical Orbs and the treasure, known as Jofuku&#x27;s Gold, righteously belong to her since it was the 1st Queen Himiko that hid the treasure as an emergency measure for the day when there would be a need to re-establish Yamatai-koku. To destroy the magical seal of the door to the Secret Treasure, she controls the mysterious powered karakuri dolls Tōma and Shima (called Psi-Vee 1 and 2 in the English version). Due to her upbringing in poverty, she can be modest in lifestyle, but she is a queen after all, and her pride remains strong. She has her hair wrapped in a headband and neatly pinned up on both sides. Voiced by Mika Kanai (Japanese); Elaine A. Clarke (English).
*Kappa - Turtle-like humanoid creatures and a type of suijin from Shinto mythology, who are seen inhabiting the backdrops of the game. Rami can use these creatures as a spring to reach higher places. She can also pick them up and move them. One of the Kappas, named Kaiyan, narrates the introductory scene in the game&#x27;s promotional video. Voiced by Akiko Hiramatsu (Japanese; Kaiyan).
*Tanuki - Subordinates who work under Dr. Pon&#x27;s direct orders. They appear throughout the game trying to intercept Rami&#x27;s advancement. Voiced by Keiji Fujiwara (Japanese; Fire Tanuki, Fishing Tanuki, Castle Promenade Tanuki); Roger L. Jackson (English; Fire Raccoons, Fishing Raccoons, Castle Promenade Raccoon).
*Armed Tanuki - Rami can snatch the weapons from their hands and add them to her arsenal. Voiced by Nobuo Tobita (Japanese; Umbrella Tanuki); Roger L. Jackson (English; Umbrella Raccoon).
*Crane in Hanging Bag - Because he hates the cold weather, this bird lives in a bag made of leaves that hangs from a tree. He occasionally scares those who pass underneath.
*Nezumi Kozō Tanukichi - A thief who steals money from the rich to give to the poor. By defeating him when he holds a senryō box in his hand, Rami will obtain the box filled with money.
*Mini-Whaling Boat - A high-performance 2-person whaling boat capable of catching the largest type of whale. The harpoon gun which shoots from the head of the boat is extremely powerful.
*Mr. Piggy - Dr. Pon&#x27;s marine reserve, who usually works as a houseboat captain.
*Musashi Sakaimari - The Ryōgoku Kokugikan&#x27;s Daruma doll mascot, possessed by the spirit of the legendary sumo champion Raiden Tameemon. His muscular power has no rival. He always dreamed of setting foot in the wrestling arena, but was never given the chance due to his &quot;lack of human spirit&quot;. Dr. Pon got him to be a subordinate by promising him the chance to become a genuine wrestler one day. Voiced by Dai Sasahara (Japanese; speaking), Tsukasa Tawada (Japanese; burping and vomiting); Roger L. Jackson (English).
*Tekkannon (+150 ml) - An armed chahakobi ningyō machine and an improved version of Tekkannon from the first game, built and operated by Dr. Pon. If it takes too much damage, it will become angry and transform into a super chahakobi ningyō. It can carry 360 liters of tea (for about 2,000 people) at a time, so it receives many inquiries, mainly from the employees of cafeterias owned by large companies. Tekkannon is called the Toxic Waste Disposer in the English version of the game. Voiced by Wataru Takagi (Japanese); Toby Gleason (English).
*Frog Tanuki - Tanuki who swim in the Aquarium at the amusement park Azuchi Jidaimura (&quot;Azuchi Historic Village&quot;), wearing red G-strings with a long tail to protect themselves from sharks.
*Kurobei the Octopus - An octopus in the Aquarium, who waves his tentacles around to attack Rami. Voiced by Keiji Fujiwara (Japanese); Don Robins (English).
*Menreiki - A yōkai composed of three Noh masks (Hannya, Otafuku and Hyottoko), and a type of tsukumogami. He earns money by working part-time at the Haunted House at Azuchi Jidaimura in order to go to Easter Island and see the Moai statues. The masks are named the Three Funny Faces in the English version of the game. Voiced by Dai Sasahara (Japanese; Hannya), Keiko Yamamoto (Japanese; Otafuku), Keiji Fujiwara (Japanese; Hyottoko); Elaine A. Clark (English; Hannya, Otafuku), Roger L. Jackson (English; Hyottoko).

*Karakuri Nobunaga and Hiyo-chan - A karakuri version of Oda Nobunaga and the boss and his pet rooster of Azuchi Castle. The castle was originally the main attraction of Azuchi Jidaimura, which started construction during the bubble era. Construction was assumed to have been stopped due to the Momoyama Company going bankrupt in the aftermath of the &quot;Ark Catastrophe&quot; a year ago, but it was completed before anyone knew it. Karakuri Nobunanga and Hiyo-chan are called Mech-Shogun and Birdie in the English version of the game. Voiced by Nobuo Tobita (Japanese; Nobunanga); Don Robins (English; Mech-Shogun).

In Japan, it is nicknamed the &quot;3-meter alien&quot; and has become so popular that even garage kits based on it are being sold (in some quarters). Voiced by Keiji Fujiwara (Japanese); Elaine A. Clark (English).
*Yoshiko Oroshiya - A news anchor and interviewer and the host of the Martial Arts Tournament. Her gentle smile brings to mind the &quot;personification of an idealized Japanese woman&quot; (Yamato nadeshiko). She was formerly a sheltered girl in Sangenjaya with dreams of becoming a star. Due to this, she is shown to be nervous at times during interviews. Voiced by Kae Araki (Japanese); Elaine A. Clark (English).
*Benkei Musashibō - A campy kabuki fighter and a participant of the Martial Arts Tournament. Voiced by Keiji Fujiwara (Japanese); Toby Gleason (English).
*Missionary Xavier - A God-fearing Christian Hakata missionary and evangelist and a participant of the Martial Arts Tournament. He is called Cardinal Xavier in the English version of the game. Voiced by Keiji Fujiwara (Japanese); Don Robins (English).
*Daidarabotchi - A giant, mechanical demon and mythical beast that resides in Mount Fuji. Its legendary feats include creating Mount Fuji in one night, washing its feet in the Tone River while sitting on Mount Haruna, and making huge lakes with its footprints. Depending on the area, it has various other names such as Daidarahō Ōhito and Yagorō Misogorō. Daidarabotchi eats Rami when she enters Mount Fuji, after which she has to make her way out of the beast&#x27;s stomach (a tower with little elves living in it) and fight its heart, which spits out various Japanese words that Rami can use as platforms. After Daidarabotchi&#x27;s heart is defeated, it turns out to be a transformed cat. Daidarabotchi is called Apocalypse in the English version of the game. Voiced by Keiji Fujiwara (Japanese; Daidarabotchi), Hikiko Takemasa (Japanese; Cat); Toby Gleason (English; Cat).

==Development==
After &quot;Keio Flying Squadron&quot; was released to critical acclaim, the developers at Victor Entertainment started talking about developing a sequel. Production on the game began in 1994 with the title &quot;Keiō Yūgekitai 2&quot;, with director Yasushi Endo, game designer Satoru Honda, programmer Teruhito Yamaki and composer Tsukasa Tawada getting the ideas together. 3D video games were popular at the time, but the developers chose to stick to 2D, initially developing the game for the Sega CD. This was due to them having little experience in 3D game design and considering the idea of turning anime characters into polygon models terrible. Six months later, the developers heard of Sega&#x27;s plans to release the Saturn in November, so they changed course. However, they did not know the console&#x27;s technical specifications, and could not really use the development equipment even when it arrived. They were so focused on learning how to make games on the Saturn that they could barely think about doing 3D polygon graphics. Over time the Saturn and PlayStation began focusing primarily on 3D polygon graphics, which angered them. They decided that they would never use the Saturn&#x27;s capabilities.

The game was going to be a graphically enhanced version of the first game, but was made into its own game with a different story. The developers felt that because the previous game was a shooter, it did not allow time to look closely at the characters onscreen, making it difficult to bring out their charm, with Rami Nanahikari being the only exception. Because of this, the game was changed into an action platformer to allow for larger sprites. The game&#x27;s art and graphics were done by Naomasa Kitatani, Kenji Kawashima, Yoshiyuki Ozaki, Nobuyuki Ikigame, Daisuke Fukuda, Akito Kuroda and Masaru Yokōra, while the character designs were done by Hiromasa Ota. The characters originally had sprites that were more in line with their anime designs, and Rami would have also carried a Frog Hammer. The game was planned to have different features, including video backgrounds, 3D bonus stages, and real photographs for most of the items that the player would pick up. The specifications for the Saturn had changed a lot at the time, so the developers spent time testing the console&#x27;s capabilities. &quot;Keio Flying Squadron 2&quot; was Victor&#x27;s next big project, although they were also developing a couple of other Sega Saturn games: &quot;Metal Fighter Miku&quot; and a port of &quot;4D Sports Boxing&quot; (later &quot;Center Ring Boxing&quot;). The game was considered for release in February 1995. However, development continued past that month. The game was later renamed &quot;Keiō Yūgekitai: Katsugeki-hen&quot;, and the video backgrounds, 3D bonus stages and photographed items were cut. The characters&#x27; sprites had to be redrawn in 2.5D due to limiting the range of movement and making parts of the platformer stages almost unusable. The game would make use of sprite scaling, squashing and rotation, digital photography, transparency, shading and 3D elements.

The Sumida River stage was originally going to be a platformer stage, but was changed to a shooter stage when Endo had issues implementing Kusatsu, the Arrow of Hope. Due to this, the bow and arrow set has stationary locations throughout the stage and cannot be obtained. The Martial Arts Tournament was planned to have seven participants, but five of them ended up being scrapped, with only Benkei Musashibō and Missionary Xavier making the final cut. They include:
* Kojirō Sasaki - A handsome young swordsman who wields his 3-1/2-inch long sword Bizen Nagamitsu, though he usually carries a drying pole on his back instead.
* Kurama-Tengu - An old man whose true identity is the Great Tengu of Mount Kurama, prohibited from television broadcasting. He rides (or rather, wears) a horse named Pakaran-kun.
* Hanzō Hattori - The leader of the Iga Shinobu-gun. He was given his name apparently due to being half-yin and yang. He never takes off his shinobi shōzoku in order to hide his appearance.
* Shishido Baiken - A Kusarigama master. On his head is a perch carved from a plum tree. He puffs his back instead of his cheeks when blowing purple smoke.
* Goemon Ishikawa and Oyabun Gama - A cleanliness-loving outlaw and his fire-breathing toad. Goemon spends 16 hours a day in the bath and the remaining eight hours sleeping. Therefore, all transportation is dependent on Gama.

In contrast to the first game&#x27;s fast-paced score, &quot;Keio Flying Squadron 2&quot;″s soundtrack had a &quot;relaxed&quot;-sounding tone. Tawada wanted each stage to have their own different music, with the platformer stages having patterns that ranged from sounding &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;-esque to Disney-esque. The musical instruments, which included koto, shamisen, percussion instruments and drums, were recorded using the Yamaha SY99.

The game features animated cutscenes produced by Studio Pierrot, who also produced the cutscenes in the first game. The Japanese voices were recorded and directed by Susumu Aketagawa at Magic Capsule and Avaco Creative Studio. Rami was the only character in the first game with spoken dialogue during gameplay, but this time the enemies and bosses also had dialogue. In response to overwhelming requests, Miho Kanno, who was appearing in advertisements for the Victor V-Saturn and releasing singles under Victor&#x27;s music label at the time, reprised her role as Rami, reuniting with Jōji Yanami and Keiko Yamamoto, who reprised their roles as Dr. Pon and Grandma, respectively. Kanno stated that upon hearing about the game, she felt a sense of parental affection because Rami was popular and loved by everyone at the time, considering her a character close to her hometown of Saitama Prefecture. Producer Toshiyuki Nagai took care to create an atmosphere in the recording booth so that she could enjoy her sessions. Yanami also replaced Yusaku Yara as the voice of Grandpa. Mika Kanai provided the voice of Himiko and replaced Akiko Hiramatsu as the voice of Spot. Additional voices were provided by Yamamoto, Kae Araki, Keiji Fujiwara, Nobuo Tobita, Wataru Takagi, Dai Sasahara and Hikiko Takemasa. For the boss characters, Tawada used a sample of his own burp from a sound effects library for Musashi Sakaimari, and created Daidarabotchi&#x27;s (the game&#x27;s final boss) voice and sound effects by recording Fujiwara&#x27;s voice and applying various effects to it, such as pitch-shifting it down. A lot of the voice clips were recorded on Digital Audio Tape, with Tawada using about three-fifths of the samples. At one point he recorded the 3-meter Alien&#x27;s voice at the wrong sampling rate, resulting in it being sped up when imported into the game. Subtitles were added for players to understand the Alien&#x27;s dialogue. Tawada planned to use the Saturn&#x27;s built-in sound engine for everything, including the music, but the voice clips took up a lot of memory space on the disc, so he decided to use Compact Disc Digital Audio instead. The English translation and voice recording was done at Watanabe-Robins &amp; Associates and Music Annex, with the voices provided by Samantha Paris, Roger L. Jackson, Elaine A. Clark, Toby Gleason and Don Robins. Clark performed several different characters in the game, including Himiko, Hannya, Otafuku, the 3-meter Alien and Yoshiko Oroshiya.

As part of a marketing campaign for the game, fans could apply to win goodies (including a colored paper with an autograph signed by Miho Kanno, cels used in the game&#x27;s cutscenes, a 30-minute promotional video, and a telephone card) by answering a questionnaire postcard and entering their gift&#x27;s number before May 31, June 30, July 31, or August 31, 1996. Merchandise such as T-shirts and sweatshirts with Rami&#x27;s face was also being planned by JVC at the time.

==Release==
&quot;Keio Flying Squadron 2&quot; was released on May 17, 1996 for the Sega Saturn in Japan, and in Europe and Australia in September later that year. It was originally set for release in March of that year, and was considered for a North American release.

 was a &quot;not for resale&quot; Sega Saturn disc only available in Japan in 1996. The disc contains higher quality versions of both the opening and ending FMV cutscenes of the first game, two cutscenes related to the second game, demo levels from the second game, a sound test including voice clips for Rami, Spot, Dr. Pon and Himiko, a showcase of the aforementioned scrapped Martial Arts Tournament participants, and an art gallery available both in-game and separately, being accessible on the CD via a personal computer.

==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;Keio Flying Squadron 2&quot; received a mixed reception. While many praised the game&#x27;s graphics and soundtrack, the controls were a common point of criticism. The Saturn was also facing stiff competition from the PlayStation and Nintendo 64, which likely overshadowed the game&#x27;s release.

Sam Hickman wrote in &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; that the game had very generic and overly easy gameplay, but was still somewhat fun to play, largely due to the intriguingly strange graphics. However, she concluded that most people would not find it worth the retail price, and scored it a 78%. &quot;Total Saturn&quot; scored the game 92 out of 100, calling it a &quot;playable, refreshing game after the mayhem of &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot;&quot;. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; gave the game a score of 75%, with Marcus stating, &quot;Quality platform games are difficult to come across these days and, while the difficulty is level here is obviously pitched towards younger players, there&#x27;s enough trickery and Japanese kitsch to keep older ones amused. Fun, while it lasts.&quot; Alex Cox of &quot;GamesMaster&quot; scored it a 79%, calling it &quot;a good, solid, mental platformer that&#x27;ll give you a laugh if nothing else&quot;. Ryan Butt of &quot;Saturn+&quot; scored the game an 84%, admitting that it was mostly a platformer and likening the ability to pick up and throw objects to &quot;Astal&quot;. However, he praised the game for its &quot;cunning puzzles and sick, deranged humour factory that make playing through to the end compulsory&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Saturn Power&quot; rated the game 88th on their Top 100 Sega Saturn Games, summarizing, &quot;A bizarre Japanese platform game that, somehow, manages to impress all that come into contact with it. The graphics are fairly primitive, but the gameplay&#x27;s excellent.&quot; Michael Townsend of &quot;Retro Replay&quot; stated, &quot;While &quot;Keio Flying Squadron 2&quot; dazzles with its graphics and catchy tunes, the clunky controls were a deal-breaker for me. It&#x27;s a shame because the game has so much personality, but when the gameplay doesn&#x27;t match up, it&#x27;s hard to fully enjoy the experience.&quot;

<text>Roderick John &quot;Bobby&quot; Wallace (November 4, 1873 – November 3, 1960) was an American Major League Baseball infielder, pitcher, manager, umpire, and scout. Wallace claimed to have invented the continuous throwing motion as a shortstop.

==Career==
Wallace was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He made his major league debut in as a starting pitcher with the Cleveland Spiders. After a 12–14 record in , Wallace played outfield and pitcher in . In , Wallace was an everyday player as he became the team&#x27;s full-time third baseman, batted .335 and drove in 112 runs.

In , Wallace moved to the St. Louis Perfectos (renamed the Cardinals in ) and changed position to shortstop. He hit .295 with 108 RBI and 12 home runs (second in the league behind Buck Freeman&#x27;s 25). Wallace changed teams again in , when he joined the St. Louis Browns.

His playing time began decreasing a decade later, with his last season as a regular coming in . Wallace played in just 55 games in , and never played that much again for the rest of his career. In July , he returned to the National League and the Cardinals, and played in just eight games that season. After batting .153 in 32 games in , Wallace retired with a .268 career batting average, 1059 runs, 34 home runs, 1121 RBI and 201 stolen bases. He played his last game on September 2, 1918, at the age of 44 years and 312 days, making him the oldest shortstop to play in a regular-season game. The record was broken by Omar Vizquel on May 7, 2012.
Wallace was generally recognized as the AL&#x27;s best shortstop from 1902 to 1911, when he served briefly as Browns player-manager. After moving from third to short, Wallace felt he&#x27;d found his place in the infield earning the nickname &quot;Mr. Shortstop&quot;. He would also claim to have invented the continuous throwing motion, “As more speed afoot was constantly demanded for big league ball, I noticed the many infield bounders which the runner beat to first only by the thinnest fractions of a second.. I also noted that the old-time three-phase movement, fielding a ball, coming erect for a toss and throwing to first wouldn’t do on certain hits with fast men…it was plain that the stop and toss had to be combined into a continuous movement.”

He played for 25 seasons, and holds the record for the longest career by a player who never played in a World Series.

When his playing time diminished, Wallace managed and umpired. He managed the St. Louis Browns in and and the Cincinnati Reds during part of the season. He compiled 62 wins and 154 losses for a .287 winning percentage as a major league manager. He also managed the minor league Wichita Witches in . He umpired in the American League in 1915, working 111 games. Upon retiring, he also became a scout.

==Later life==
Wallace was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in .

Wallace died on November 3, 1960, in Torrance, California, one day shy of his 87th birthday.

<text>Citizens Advice (previously Citizens Advice Bureau and also known as Cyngor ar Bopeth in Welsh) is a British independent organisation specialising in confidential information and advice to assist people with legal, debt, consumer, housing and other problems in the United Kingdom.

The twin aims of the Citizens Advice service are &quot;to provide the advice people need for the problems they face&quot; and secondly &quot;to improve the policies and principles that affect people&#x27;s lives&quot;. This research and campaigns agenda also known as &quot;social policy&quot; is more preventative in nature and designed to stop problems arising in the first place.

Citizens Advice organisations emerged in the 1930s linked to the emergence of a fledgling social welfare service and the outbreak of World War II. Public funding for the organisation was cut following the war but restored during the 1960s and a government grant in 1973 allowed the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (NACAB) to expand the charity. Citizens Advice has grown to be the largest independent advice provider in the United Kingdom. There are also a number of Citizens Advice organisations that base themselves on the United Kingdom advice charity mainly in parts of the Commonwealth including Australia, New Zealand, and Gibraltar.

In 2013 the Citizens Advice Adviceguide website was visited by one third of United Kingdom&#x27;s online population and Citizens Advice&#x27;s own research shows that four in ten of the British population contact Citizens Advice at some point during their lives. In 2014 Citizens Advice celebrated its 75th anniversary and in 2015 the charity was named Charity of the Year at the 2015 Charity Awards. During the ten year leadership of the former Chief Executive Gillian Guy Citizens Advice expanded its remit taking on the contract for the Witness Service and the face-to-face advice element of Pension Wise.

==History==
===Origins===

The origins of the modern Citizens Advice service can be traced back to the Betterton Report on Public Assistance from 1924. This report recommended that advice centres should be set up to offer members of the public advice to help them with their problems. During the 1930s, as preparations and plans were drawn up for the possibility of war, the role that the voluntary sector should have was determined. The National Council for Social Service (NCSS) called a meeting in 1938 in which plans to establish &quot;Citizens Aid Bureaux&quot; were devised in the event of war.
The first 200 bureaux opened on 4 September 1939, four days after World War II started. Many of these initial bureaux were run by &quot;people of standing&quot; in the community. In &quot;The Story of The Citizens&#x27; Advice Bureaux&quot; Brasnett states that the typical bureau would include &quot;a committee chairman the editor of a respected county paper, as treasurer a local bank manager; and among the members the manager of the employment exchange, an estate agent who was able to lend part of a house for offices&quot;. Brasnett also describes a range of groups running provincial bureau including Toc H, Rotary Clubs and Soroptomist Clubs. Brasnett states in &quot;The Story of the Citizens&#x27; Advice Bureau&quot; that these first bureau were mainly offshoots of established organisations in London and other large provincial cities. These organisations included the Charity Organisation Society (now the Family Action) and the London Council of Social Service, the Liverpool Personal Service Society, the City of Glasgow Society of Social Service, the Birmingham Citizens&#x27; Society (now the Birmingham Council of Social Service). By 1942, there were 1,074 bureaux in a wide range of improvised offices such as cafes, church halls, private homes and air-raid shelters. Sheffield set up in the cloisters of Sheffield Cathedral after its premises were bombed during World War II and another bureau worked in Chislehurst Caves. Mobile offices also became important in ensuring that people could access advice. Many of the issues dealt with during that time were directly related to the war. These included the tracing of missing servicemen or prisoners of war, evacuations, pensions and other allowances. &quot;The Independent&quot; describes Citizens Advice at this time as &quot;clearing houses for family and personal problems that abound from war conditions&quot;, with common issues being lost ration books and debt issues as men went off to fight in World War II.

===Post-war history===
Many war time bureaux closed at the end of the war, although it was apparent that there was still a need for the services that had been established. A particular problem was the chronic housing shortage in the years immediately following the end of the war. In the 1950s, the funding was cut and by 1960 there were only 415 bureaux. The Citizens Advice service continued due to charitable support from groups such as the Nuffield Foundation, Carnegie Trust and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. In 1972, The Citizens Advice service became independent. Before then, the national organisation was part of NCSS (National Council of Social Services) and most bureaux were run by the local CVS (Council for Voluntary Service). In 1973, the government funded NACAB, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, to enlarge the network. The 1984 afternoon television drama series &quot;Miracles Take Longer&quot; depicted the type of cases that a 1980s branch would have to deal with. David Harker became CEO in 1997. He led Citizens Advice until 2010 and during that time oversaw a massive IT overhaul.

Since 2003, the operating name of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux changed to Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Cymru or &quot;Cyngor ar Bopeth&quot; in Wales. In the same year Citizens Advice became the first advice sector organisation to begin to audit the quality of their advice. In 2008/9, there were 416 member bureaux offering advice from over 3,300 locations in England and Wales and a further 22 bureaux in Northern Ireland all of which are independent charities. Despite the large number of volunteers working for the organisation, level of demand for the service often far outstrips resources. Citizens Advice has recently begun looking at ways to reach all members of the community through new mediums such as email advice and digital TV. Another initiative has been allowing university students to train as advisers to gain credits toward their degree. This was pioneered by a partnership between the University of Portsmouth and Portsmouth Citizens Advice Bureau and is also now available at Birmingham City University, University of Reading, University of Northampton, Glasgow Caledonian University, and University of Glasgow. Training as a Citizens Advice adviser can earn a person up to six months off a training contract if training as a solicitor.

===Recent history===

Gillian Guy became Chief Executive in 2010 and under her leadership a modernisation process took place which involved a rebrand of the Citizens Advice service and the introduction of new advice methods including webchat. She was succeeded by Clare Moriarty in April 2021.

At the start of Guy&#x27;s tenure Citizens Advice faced a budget cut of 9% however finances have recently improved with the charity increasing its income from £62m to £77m between 2013 and 2015. This is largely a result of Citizens Advice taking over roles that were previously performed by the quangos the Office of Fair Trading and Consumer Futures. During 2012 and 2013 Citizens Advice adopted an Equality Strategy known as &#x27;Stand Up For Equality&#x27; which aims to embed an equality agenda in all work Citizens Advice does. In 2014 Citizens Advice took over the role that Victim Support played in supporting court witnesses. This contract is worth £24m. This service was renamed the Witness Service. Also in 2014 Citizens Advice took over the role of Consumer Futures (previously Consumer Focus) which represents consumers of regulated industries (energy and the postal service). In 2015 Citizens Advice began to deliver Pension Wise guidance. In 2015 Citizens Advice adopted a rebrand dropping the &#x27;Bureau&#x27; from its name. The rebrand cost £1 million which includes £215,000 for research and development, £450,000 in financial support to implement the changes and £300,000 to cover local costs such as posters and materials. The rebrand was criticised by Steve Johnson the Chief Executive Officer of AdviceUK who described it as &quot;facile&quot;. However, evidence from Citizens Advice focus groups found that while the charity was well known the brand was considered somewhat “tired” or “old fashioned”.

In 2019-20, the organisation&#x27;s revenues were £139.1 million.

In 2015 Citizens Advice piloted a webchat service allowing people to contact Citizens Advice advisers online both via online instant messenger service and via e-mail. Data from 2015 showed that 7% of all enquiries to Citizens Advice were through the webchat service and 80,000 webchat enquiries were answered.

In 2016 Citizens Advice was featured in a BBC documentary called &quot;Battling with Benefits&quot;. It explored the work of Bridgend Citizens Advice in Wales and their work on issues such as the bedroom tax, Job Seekers&#x27; Allowance &quot;sanctions&quot; and appeals for Employment Support Allowance and Personal Independence Payment in light of the Conservative Government&#x27;s cuts to the social security system.

==Aims and principles==

The Citizens Advice service in England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland is guided by four principles. These are:

*A free service
*Confidentiality
*Impartiality
*Independence

Although an independent and impartial organisation Citizens Advice has a peculiar relationship with Government in that it is dependent upon Government for funding but also acts as a high-profile critic of government policy. At a Citizens Advice conference in 1957 Lord Denning, then Lord Justice of Appeal described the complex relationship between Citizens Advice and the state describing how Citizens Advice was &quot;supported indeed by the state, but not controlled by it; supported by local authorities but not controlled by them, and, I hope like the law, never to be controlled by any public authority&quot;.

All Citizens Advice Bureaux and workers for the bureaux must adhere to these principles, and bureaux must demonstrate that they adhere to these principles in order to retain membership of the national umbrella bodies. Citizens Advice state that their vision &quot;is that everyone will be able to access free advice to find a way forward&quot;. They also state that their &quot;charitable mission is to provide advice that helps people to overcome their problems and come together to campaign on big issues when their voices need to be heard&quot;.

==Funding==

The trade publication &quot;Third Sector&quot; state that around 60% of Citizens Advice funding comes from government sources. It has been argued that there is a tension in the relationship between Citizens Advice and government as while the charity relies on government funding to survive it is most effective as a high-profile critic of government policy. Local bureaux received funding of £167m in 2014. Although Citizens Advice is a national charity local bureaux are responsible for raising their own funding. Some of this may come from &#x27;The Big Lottery Fund&#x27; which distributes money raised through the National Lottery for &#x27;good causes,&#x27; from local authorities or from other services such as the Legal Services Commission. Citizens Advice suffered cuts during the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession and over 100 Citizens Advice offices closed or were lost as a result of merger since 2009. Others resorted to reduced services. Some Councils have been forced to cut funding for Citizens Advice services and these cuts led to complaints that Citizens Advice was not meeting growing needs for its services during a period of high demand. Newcastle Citizens Advice faced a threat of closure in 2016 after Newcastle Council proposed large cuts to its funding. In February 2016, Derby City Council decided that it would no longer fund the city&#x27;s Citizens Advice, leaving Derby as the only city in the UK not to have a Citizens Advice Service, according to its CEO.

Both Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland are registered charities and are financed partly by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, although both organisations are completely independent of central government. Member bureaux also pay heavily subsidised subscriptions for the services offered. They often receive significant funding by local authorities, and local solicitors may agree to provide limited legal advice pro bono. In 2013 the then Consumer Minister Jo Swinson announced a further £9.5m in order for the charity to champion consumer work and in 2015 Martin Lewis founder of Money Saving Expert donated £1m to Citizens Advice. In 2016 it was announced that the money Martin Lewis donated would be used to create a fund called the &#x27;Martin Lewis Fund&#x27; and this money would be used to improve front line services.

==Advicework==
Citizens Advice service&#x27;s work involves providing advice on issues such as debt management and welfare benefits, housing, immigration, employment, consumer complaints and landlord-tenant disputes. Citizens Advice calculated that in 2016 it helped 2.7 million people with 6.3 million problems. There were also 48 million visits to their digital service.

Advice is available in the bureaux, but also in community venues, in people&#x27;s homes, by phone, by e-mail and online both via a Webchat service and the Citizens Advice public site known as &quot;Advice Guide&quot;. Figures from 2016 show that Citizens Advice has around 600 staff members in GP surgeries.

Telephone advice also known as Adviceline can be accessed in English and a bilingual service in Wales.
One Citizens Advice page shows in real time what individuals are searching for on the website, what searches from the search engine Google caused an individual to reach the Citizens Advice page and what Citizens Advice website content is most popular. Citizens Advice also runs a consumer helpline to help with consumer issues. The most popular areas of enquiry are benefits and debt, with housing the third most popular enquiry area. Each Citizens Advice office operates differently. Some will have specialist staff that deal with certain cases such as debt or housing. Some operate a &#x27;Gateway&#x27; system which means clients are booked for advice at a later appointment and other Citizens Advice offer &#x27;drop in&#x27; Generalist Advice sessions. At some Citizens Advice offices solicitors may offer short appointments on a &quot;pro bono&quot; basis as a way of gaining clients.

Citizens Advice has a number of advice partnerships with organisations in areas including money and partnership with Macmillan to help those affected by cancer. Citizens Advice has a partnership with the housing advice charity Shelter called the National Homelessness Advice Service which is able to offer advisers specialist housing and homelessness advice. The partnership is funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government. From 2015 Citizens Advice offices have been used to deliver Pension Wise guidance. Citizens Advice research shows that 25% of those who visit for a Pension Wise appointment go on to ask Citizens Advice for further advice on debts, benefits or tax.

Citizens Advice also engages in preventative work in order to prevent problems arising in the first place. Citizens Advice is the Government-funded provider of consumer education in Great Britain. There are 11 Consumer Empowerment Partnerships that work closely with Trading Standards. A financial capability agenda helps people to manage their money so as to not develop money problems in the first place. Citizens Advice also produces education resources to improve financial capability and consumer education. A Partnerships Intelligence Team works in order to support the work of regulators. One example of this is research on continuous payment authorities in order to help the Financial Conduct Authority better regulate them.

==Research and campaigns==
The Citizens Advice service, both locally and nationally, also uses clients&#x27; problems as evidence to influence policy makers to review laws or administrative practices which cause undue difficulties to clients, in a process referred to as &quot;Social Policy&quot;. At a national level Citizens Advice engages in policy research in order to recommend policy changes. Current research areas include mental health domestic abuse, problems in the private rented sector, welfare, work, pensions, energy policy and the postal service.

A public affairs team works to influence Government both in Westminster and the devolved institutions. There is also a Citizens Advice All-Party Parliamentary Group that provides a forum for Members of Parliament who are interested in the work of Citizens Advice. Citizens Advice produces constituency data that can be used by Parliamentarians to improve how they complete their own case work. Advice Trends data is published at a national and local level.

==Impact==
Citizens Advice measures the of its advice across a range of areas. Citizens Advice research has calculated that for every £1 spent on the Citizens Advice service the Government saves £1.96 and £8.74 in wider economic and social benefits and £11.98 in benefit to individuals.
Research shows that Citizens Advice affects the most disadvantaged in society with Citizens Advice clients five times more likely to live in poverty than the average member of the United Kingdom population. Citizen Advice&#x27;s own research has also shown that volunteering has positive benefits in terms of helping people gain practical skills and improving mental health. Each year 31% of Citizens Advice&#x27;s volunteers leave the service for paid employment and it has been calculated that the work of Citizens Advice volunteers is worth £111 million. Citizens Advice&#x27;s campaigns work has had a number of successes including the Financial Conduct Authority capping payday loans. A Twitter hashtag #CABlive is used to publicise the work of Citizens Advice on social media.

== Advice and health improvement ==
Research conducted in 2016 found that 4 in 5 of Citizens Advice clients felt stressed, depressed or anxious and 3 in 5 clients felt their physical health had become worse as a result of their practical problem.

There is a growing body of evidence which shows that tackling practical problems through advice improves health and wellbeing. National Citizens Advice Impact research reports that 70% of clients said they felt less stressed and 46% said their physical health improve after advice. Of Citizens Advice clients experiencing long-term conditions, 57% said they were better able to manage their condition.

Citizens Advice has also investigated the impact that practical problems have on health professional&#x27;s time. The research report &quot;A Very General Practice&quot; estimates that 19% of GP appointments are spent dealing with non-clinical problems. 98% of IAPT practitioners that responded to Citizens Advice research reported that they had dealt with a patient&#x27;s non-health problems during an appointment in the past month and 57% reported the proportion of time they spend on non-health issues has increased compared to last year.

In 2016 Citizens Advice was appointed to the National Health and Wellbeing Alliance. Working with the Department of Health, NHS England, Public Health England and the 23 members of the Alliance, Citizens Advice uses its data and evidence to reduce health inequalities, which is one of the key aims of the Alliance.

==Governance==

A Trustee Board provides strategic direction and vision for the organisation. The Chief Executive working with the Executive Team is responsible for delivering the board&#x27;s vision.

Below the Trustee Board a number of committees exist:

*Chair&#x27;s Committee
*Audit Risk Committee
*Equality Committee
*Cymru Committee
*Trustee Recruitment Committee
*Membership and Standards Committee
*Remuneration Committee
*Technology Committee

==Organisation==
The Citizens Advice service is one of the largest volunteer organisations in the United Kingdom with 21,600 volunteers. The majority of these are part-time volunteer advisers, but the figure also includes trustees and administrators. While volunteers have varying levels of training, they are all required to receive basic training to ensure they fully understand the nature of the service including the four basic principles. Typically there will be a paid bureau manager, some paid advice session supervisors and in some cases some paid advisers. Some staff may be qualified to give specialist legal advice or to advise on immigration. Each Citizens Advice is an affiliated to the national organisation but they are managed and run locally. Many bureaux are also limited companies and may have a board of directors, who will also be the organisation&#x27;s trustees. Bureaux throughout the United Kingdom have varying community needs and very different resources, and consequently offer different styles and levels of service. All bureaux in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are members of Citizens Advice, the operating name of The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. Northern Ireland bureaux are also members of the Northern Ireland Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (NIACAB). Bureaux in Scotland are members of Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS), part of the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. Citizens Advice holds an Annual Conference each year. In 2015 this was held at the University of Warwick.

Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland act as umbrella bodies for the bureaux in the UK. They provide access to information, training courses and consultancy services for all bureaux, and regularly audit individual bureaux against the requirements of their respective membership standards. All bureaux try to ensure their services are accessible to all sections of the community, so that provision can be made for the housebound, immigrant communities, rural inhabitants, elderly and disabled as appropriate. Membership of Citizens Advice gives each bureau access to the national information portal, known as AdviserNet and to internet access provided through a Virtual Private Network. Information on clients&#x27; problems and the advice offered to them is entered into the &quot;Casebook&quot; national database. Its predecessor system was &quot;Petra&quot; and before that &quot; CASE&quot;.

Citizens Advice has a number of diversity groups known as Self Organised Network Groups (SONGs). These include:

*National Black Workers&#x27; Group
*National Disabled Workers&#x27; Group
*National Lesbian Gay and Bisexual Group
*National Women&#x27;s Group

===Citizens Advice Scotland===
Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS), formally the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (SACAB), is a registered charity. Based in Edinburgh it comprises 61 member bureaux, including a national helpline (Citizens Advice Direct). Together these free local and national services provide legal advice, practical help and information on consumer and political rights across the country. CAS provides central support to local bureaux with management, research, fundraising, IT support, training and campaigning. CAS launched a national helpline in 2005, called Citizens Advice Direct, staff were based in Glasgow city centre.

In 2012 a study showed that most of CAS&#x27;s activity was the provision of advice across five areas: benefits, debt, employment, housing and relationship. In 2012, there were concerns that five of the bureaux in Glasgow might close, however they remained open after accepting a new funding offer. CAS has been registered as a charity since 3 August 1984, currently registered as a charitable company with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR), Scottish charity number SC 016637. According to 2016 statistics Citizens Advice Scotland helped 300,000 clients and put £120 million into the pockets of people seeking help in 2015/16 and help reduce the amount owed by those seeking debt advice by £27 million.

===Citizens Advice Northern Ireland===
Citizens Advice Northern Ireland are now known as Community Advice. It is Northern Ireland&#x27;s largest advice charity. There are advice services covering each council area. In Northern Ireland Citizens Advice advises over 95,000 people per year.

===Citizens Advice Cymru===
In Wales Citizens Advice Cymru has a network of 20 bureaux giving advice at 375 locations. According to the latest available statistics (2013/14) these bureau advised 134,000 clients and dealt with 337,000 advice issues. The Adviceline telephone service is bilingual and is able to offer advice in both English and Welsh.

==In other nations==

Organisations modelled on Citizens Advice have been created in other nations outside of the United Kingdom. All of these organisations are autonomous and are not in any way controlled by the British organisation although some have adopted the branding of the British Citizens Advice. The Citizens Advice Bureau serving Western Australia has 10 branches of Citizens Advice Bureau and uses the same branding as the British charity. New Zealand has over 80 Citizens Advice Bureau branches throughout the North and South Island. There is also a Spanish Citizens Advice Bureau organisation aimed at helping British expats in Spain and a Gibraltan Citizens Advice Bureau. An unrelated organisation Citizens Advice International was established in 2004 to promote free advice services and to promote Citizens Advice organisations throughout the world.

<doc id="841743" wikidata="Q919602" url="?curid=841743" title="Coat of arms of Toronto">
<text>The coat of arms of Toronto is a heraldic symbol used to represent the city Toronto. Designed by Robert Watt, the Chief Herald of Canada at the time, for the City of Toronto after its amalgamation in 1998. The arms were granted by the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 11 January 1999.

==Description==
The coat of arms can be described as follows: &quot;Or, a pale and a chief Azure. The crest: on a wreath of the colours, issuant from a mural coronet Or, masoned Sable charged with a human heart Gules between two roses Argent, buttoned Or, slipped proper, on a grassy mount Vert, a golden eagle statant, wings elevated and expanded proper. The supporters are: on the dexter, a beaver sejeant proper, collared with a torse Gules, therefrom on a hexagon Or an ash leaf Vert; on the sinister, a brown bear rampant proper, collared with a torse Gules, pendant therefrom a hexagon charged with a columbine flower proper. Both supporters are placed on a grassy mount from which at the base of the shield three wavy streams in pairle reversed Argent each surcharged with another Azure flow into a barry wavy &#x27;lakefront&#x27;, below which is placed a scroll with the motto &quot;Diversity Our Strength&quot; between two maple leaves Gules, veined Or, at the extremities of the scroll.&quot;

The Canadian Heraldic Authority&#x27;s official blazon of the coat of arms is:
* Arms: Or a chief-pale Azure.
* Crest: Issuant from a mural crown Or charged with a heart Gules between two roses Argent barbed Vert seeded Or, a mound Vert thereon a golden eagle wings raised proper.
* Supporters: On a mound Vert rising above barry wavy Azure and Argent and charged with three pales wavy Azure fimbriated Argent, dexter a beaver proper gorged with a cord Gules pendant therefrom a hexagon Or charged with an alder leaf Vert, sinister a bear proper gorged with a cord Gules pendant therefrom a hexagon Or charged with a columbine flower Azure.
* Motto: Diversity Our Strength.

The arms displayed on the shield are designed in a way that represents the two towers of Toronto City Hall and the capital letter T, as shown in the image of the arms. The three wavy streams beneath the shield represent the three rivers of Toronto: the Humber, the Don and the Rouge. The barry wavy &#x27;lakefront&#x27; represents Lake Ontario.

==Former coats of arms==

The chain of office of the Mayor of Toronto includes the coats of arms or heraldic devices of all prior municipalities, including the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.

The coats of arms for the current City of Toronto government, the former City of Scarborough, and the former City of York are registered in the Canadian Heraldic Authority&#x27;s &quot;Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada&quot;. The former City of York was the only former municipality in Metropolitan Toronto to have a motto in Latin, while the mottoes of the other municipalities were in English.

===Toronto===

The former City of Toronto had a coat of arms prior to amalgamation in 1998, designed by William Lyon Mackenzie. The shield consisted of four quarters separated by a white cross charged with a red maple leaf. The first quarter was red and charged with three golden lions as an allusion to the coat of arms of England, the second quarter was blue with a white stylized rose to allude to York, the third quarter was blue with a white cog wheel for industry, and the fourth quarter displayed a steam boat in gold on red to represent the importance of the lake and waterways in and around the city. The crest was a beaver atop a gold mural crown; the mural crown represents Fort York. The supporters were a First Nations warrior (likely representing the local Mississaugas) with a bow (on the viewer&#x27;s left), and the personification of Britannia with trident and shield painted with the Union Jack (on the viewer&#x27;s right). The motto was &quot;Industry, Intelligence, Integrity&quot;.

In an earlier version of the arms, a beaver was shown in place of the white rose, and a sheaf of wheat instead of the cog wheel. In addition, the First Nations supporter in the earlier coat of arms was a Chief holding an axe, and both supporters were facing directly across to one another.

The heraldic badge of HMCS &quot;Toronto&quot; features the crest of the former City of Toronto.

In 1997, the Canadian Heraldic Authority created a prototype for Amalgamated Toronto&#x27;s new coat of arms. It consisted of a golden shield with 3 wavy shapes thereon, with a green disc consisting of a coronet that contained trilliums and a maple leaf; the 3 Golden and 3 Blue shapes represented the 6 municipalities (East York, Etobicoke, North York, Old Toronto, Scarborough, and York) brought together to form the new City of Toronto. The Trilliums upon the coronet represented Toronto&#x27;s place in Ontario as the Provincial capital, and the Maple Leaf represented Toronto&#x27;s place in Canada as Canada&#x27;s largest city. The crest, almost identical to the former city crest, was a beaver atop a mural crown holding an ear of wheat. The supporters were hybrids between a Lion, an Ocelot, a Tiger, and a Dragon, as these were the 4 animals that the City of Toronto polled people on what animals
they would like to see on the city arms. These hybrid supporters ultimately got the arms rejected by the Toronto City Council. The compartment, 3 wavy lines emptying into a watery base, is the same as the current compartment used by the City of Toronto, and represented the Humber, Don, and Rouge Rivers flowing into Lake Ontario. The motto, &quot;STRONGER IN UNITY&quot;, refers to the multicultural dimension of the city and to the six municipalities that formed what is now the City of Toronto.

===East York===

The Borough of East York&#x27;s armorial device was designed by Harry Faulks, a resident of Leaside. It was selected by the Borough in 1967 and consisted of the following elements: 
* Arms: Gules a rose Argent barbed Vert and seeded Or, in a chief of the second and between two maple leaves of the third a beaver proper.
* Crest: A bulldog statant proper.
* Motto: BOROUGH OF EAST YORK.

===Etobicoke===

The City of Etobicoke&#x27;s coat of arms were granted by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office on 16 November 1977. The armorial bearings consisted of the following items:

* Arms: Or on a mount Vert a clump of four speckled alders proper. 
* Crest: On a wreath of the colours Or and Vert, a Canadian Mural Crown, embattled of six maple leaves Or masoned and veined Sable. 
* Supporters : On the dexter side a representation of a native Indian of the era, on bended knee holding in the dexter hand a bow all proper, and on the sinister side a figure on bended knee representing Etienne Brule, holding in the sinister hand a musket, all proper. 
* On a compartment consisting of an escroll Argent the name ETOBICOKE, on the dexter side the word TRADITION, and on the sinister the word PROGRESS, all Sable.

===North York===

North York&#x27;s seal was created by Toronto Architect Murray Brown (1885-1958) who was also commissioned in 1922–1923 to design the then-township&#x27;s first municipal building. Township of North York Bylaw 103, passed 23 December 1923, defined the seal as &quot;&quot;A Shield showing a sheaf of grain and scales, surmounted by a beaver on crown, and border of maple leaves on right and left hand sides, the whole surrounded with the words, &quot;Progress With Economy&quot;.&quot;&quot;. The former municipality&#x27;s armorial device consisted of:

* Arms: Per fess and per pale Gules, a beaver above a coronet, a sheaf of wheat and a scale, all Or.
* Badge: Three maple leaves on either side of the shield, all within a roundel
* Motto: PROGRESS WITH ECONOMY.

===Scarborough===

The City of Scarborough&#x27;s coat of arms was granted in 1996 by the Canadian Heraldic Authority, and the official blazon of the arms was as follows:

*Arms: Or, a columbine flower and a chief embattled Azure, issuant from the upper chief a demi-sun Or.
*Crest: Issuant from a coronet heightened with four ears of corn (one and two-halves visible) alternating with four millstones (two visible) Or, a maple leaf Gules.
*Supporters: Two stags Or attired and unguled Azure, each gorged with a collar of braid Gules, Argent and Azure, standing upon a representation of the Scarborough Bluffs proper rising above the waters of Lake Ontario Azure and Argent.
*Motto: HOME ABOVE THE BLUFFS.

The previous armorial device of the former borough had a shield within a laurel wreath. Upon this shield were the following elements, in quarters:

* The arms of the province of Ontario
* A sheaf of wheat
* Two cog wheels and a factory
* A view of the Scarborough Bluffs

===York===
The City of York&#x27;s coat of arms was granted in 1993 by the Canadian Heraldic Authority, and the official blazon of the arms was as follows:

*Arms: Vert, dexter a pale wavy Argent charged with a pallet wavy Azure, sinister a sprig of rose Or flowered Argent.
*Crest: A rock dove proper rising out of a Mural Crown Or masoned Azure.
*Supporters: On a grassy mound, dexter a beaver sejant erect Or gorged with a ribbon Vert, Argent and Azure, sinister a lion sejant the right forepaw raised Or gorged with a like ribbon.
*Motto: &quot;E SINGULIS COMMUNITAS&quot; (Latin for &quot;From individuals, a community&quot;).
*Badge: A hexagon Vert charged with a sprig of rose Or flowered Argent.

The city&#x27;s motto was in Latin, and it was the only former municipality with a motto in that language, while the others were in English.

<text>Edward Crossley (1841 – 21 January 1905) was an English businessman, Liberal Party politician and astronomer.

==Biography==
Edward Crossley was the eldest son of Joseph Crossley J.P., of Broomfield, Halifax, Yorkshire, of the Crossley carpets dynasty. He inherited his family&#x27;s carpet manufacturing business (John Crossley &amp; Sons) from his father when he was 27. He married Jane Eleanor Baines, third daughter of the Leeds newspaper proprietor and MP Sir Edward Baines.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sowerby from 1885 to 1892. He was also mayor of Halifax from 1874–1876 and 1884–1885.

He became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1867. He built the Bermerside astronomical observatory, operational from 1867 to 1894, and purchased a telescope from Andrew Ainslie Common in 1885, and employed Joseph Gledhill as an observer. With Gledhill and James Wilson (later Canon of Worcester), he wrote &quot;Handbook of Double Stars&quot; in 1879, which became a standard reference work.

By 1895 Crossley had deemed the rainy English weather and the industrial air pollution at his observatory site unsuitable for astronomy, so he donated his telescope to the Lick Observatory in California. Though extensively modified, it was used for research until 2010 and is known as the Crossley reflector. This telescope was used by Charles Dillon Perrine to discover two moons of Jupiter. The 36 in. Crossley reflector was used extensively before the 120 in. Shane Reflecting Telescope (C. Donald Shane Telescope) was built in 1959.

<doc id="841749" wikidata="Q2942495" url="?curid=841749" title="St. Mary's Cathedral (Calgary)">
<text>St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Calgary, Alberta, Canada is a Roman Catholic cathedral and the seat of the Diocese of Calgary. The building&#x27;s full name is &quot;The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;.

== History==
St. Mary&#x27;s began as a sandstone church in 1889, built near the Elbow River on land provided by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The area was called the Mission District, due to the settlement of Father Albert Lacombe in the area in 1884. The original Catholic mission was called Notre-Dame-de-la-Paix. The land was used to establish a French-speaking incorporated village called Rouleauville, which subsequently became overwhelmingly English and was annexed by Calgary in 1907 (making St. Mary&#x27;s part of Calgary). The same land obtained by Lacombe was also used to build St. Mary&#x27;s School nearby.

When Pope Pius X created the Diocese of Calgary November 30, 1912, &quot;St. Mary’s&quot; became the cathedral as the seat of the Bishop.

Demolition of the sandstone cathedral began on July 21, 1955, and on October 30, 1955, the cornerstone for the cathedral was laid. Construction completed in February 1957, and the Most Reverend Francis P. Carroll, Bishop of Calgary, consecrated the sanctuary December 11, 1957.

==Architecture==

The building was designed by architects Maxwell Bates, and Alfred Hodges; with Jan Bobrowski and Partners as the project engineers. Bird Construction Company Ltd. was contracted to building the cathedral. The total cost of which was C$1,000,000.

The cathedral is built of brick with sandstone accents in a modern gothic style. The floor plan is a St. Anthony&#x27;s Cross (T or Tau-shaped) rather than the usual Latin cross that forms most Western Christian churches. A statue of the Virgin Mary with Child in stone, by the Calgary sculptor Luke Lindoe occupies a niche above the main entrance.

Senator Pat Burns donated four bells in to the church in 1904 that were cast by the Paccard Foundry in Annecy, France. These bells are the only parts from the old building used in the construction of the new cathedral.

The tabernacle, chalices, monstrance, candle holders and sanctuary lamp were all designed and cast by &quot;Gunning and Son Bronze Works&quot; of Dublin. The pulpit was designed by the architects and built from hand carved oak by the &quot;Globe Furniture Company&quot; of Waterloo, Ontario. The carvings depict the figures of Christ and the four major prophets: Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezechiel and Daniel.

The stained glass throughout the cathedral was commissioned from Franz Mayer &amp; Co. of Munich.

<text>In electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, existing substituent groups on the aromatic ring influence the overall reaction rate or have a directing effect on positional isomer of the products that are formed. 

An electron donating group (EDG) or electron releasing group (ERG, Z in structural formulas) is an atom or functional group that donates some of its electron density into a conjugated π system via resonance (mesomerism) or inductive effects (or induction)—called +M or +I effects, respectively—thus making the π system more nucleophilic. As a result of these electronic effects, an aromatic ring to which such a group is attached is more likely to participate in electrophilic substitution reaction. EDGs are therefore often known as activating groups, though steric effects can interfere with the reaction. 

An electron withdrawing group (EWG) will have the opposite effect on the nucleophilicity of the ring. The EWG removes electron density from a π system, making it less reactive in this type of reaction, and therefore called deactivating groups.

EDGs and EWGs also determine the positions (relative to themselves) on the aromatic ring where substitution reactions are most likely to take place. Electron donating groups are generally ortho/para directors for electrophilic aromatic substitutions, while electron withdrawing groups (except the halogens) are generally meta directors. The selectivities observed with EDGs and EWGs were first described in 1892 and have been known as the Crum Brown–Gibson rule.

==Categories==

Electron donating groups are typically divided into three levels of activating ability (The &quot;extreme&quot; category can be seen as &quot;strong&quot;.) Electron withdrawing groups are assigned to similar groupings. Activating substituents favour electrophilic substitution about the &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; positions. Weakly deactivating groups direct electrophiles to attack the benzene molecule at the &quot;ortho-&quot; and &quot;para-&quot; positions, while strongly and moderately deactivating groups direct attacks to the &quot;meta-&quot; position. This is not a case of favoring the meta- position like para- and ortho- directing functional groups, but rather disfavouring the &quot;ortho&quot;- and &quot;para&quot;-positions more than they disfavour the &quot;meta&quot;- position.

=== Activating groups ===
The activating groups are mostly resonance donors (+M). Although many of these groups are also inductively withdrawing (–I), which is a deactivating effect, the resonance (or mesomeric) effect is almost always stronger, with the exception of Cl, Br, and I.
In general, the resonance effect of elements in the third period and beyond is relatively weak. This is mainly because of the relatively poor orbital overlap of the substituent&#x27;s 3p (or higher) orbital with the 2p orbital of the carbon.

Due to a stronger resonance effect and inductive effect than the heavier halogens, fluorine is anomalous. The partial rate factor of electrophilic aromatic substitution on fluorobenzene is often larger than one at the &quot;para&quot; position, making it an activating group. Conversely, it is moderately deactivated at the &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;meta&quot; positions, due to the proximity of these positions to the electronegative fluoro substituent.

===Deactivating groups===
While all deactivating groups are inductively withdrawing (–I), most of them are also withdrawing through resonance (–M) as well. Halogen substituents are an exception: they are resonance donors (+M). With the exception of the halides, they are &quot;meta&quot; directing groups.

Halides are &quot;ortho&quot;, &quot;para&quot; directing groups but unlike most &quot;ortho&quot;, &quot;para&quot; directors, halides mildly deactivate the arene. This unusual behavior can be explained by two properties:

# Since the halogens are very electronegative they cause inductive withdrawal (withdrawal of electrons from the carbon atom of benzene).
# Since the halogens have non-bonding electrons they can donate electron density through pi bonding (resonance donation).

The inductive and resonance properties compete with each other but the resonance effect dominates for purposes of directing the sites of reactivity. For nitration, for example, fluorine directs strongly to the &quot;para&quot; position because the &quot;ortho&quot; position is inductively deactivated (86% &quot;para&quot;, 13% &quot;ortho&quot;, 0.6% &quot;meta&quot;). On the other hand, iodine directs to &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; positions comparably (54% &quot;para&quot; and 45% &quot;ortho&quot;, 1.3% &quot;meta&quot;).
== Traditional rationalizations ==
Although the full electronic structure of an arene can only be computed using quantum mechanics, the directing effects of different substituents can often be guessed through analysis of resonance diagrams. Specifically, any formal negative or positive charges in minor resonance contributors (ones in accord with the natural polarization but not necessarily obeying the octet rule) reflect locations having a larger or smaller density of charge in the molecular orbital for a bond most likely to break. A carbon atom with a larger coefficient will be preferentially attacked, due to more favorable orbital overlap with the electrophile. 
The perturbation of a conjugating electron-withdrawing or electron-donating group causes the π electron distribution on a benzene ring to resemble (&quot;very slightly&quot;!) an electron-deficient benzyl cation or electron-excessive benzyl anion, respectively. The latter species admit tractable quantum calculation using Hückel theory: the cation withdraws electron density at the &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; positions, favoring &quot;meta&quot; attack, whereas the anion releases electron density into the same positions, activating them for attack. This is precisely the result that the drawing of resonance structures would predict. 

For example, aniline has resonance structures with negative charges around the ring system:

Attack occurs at &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; positions, because the (partial) formal negative charges at these positions indicate a local electron excess. On the other hand, the nitrobenzene resonance structures have positive charges around the ring system:

Attack occurs at the &quot;meta&quot; position, since the (partial) formal positive charges at the &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; positions indicate electron deficiency at these positions. 

Another common argument, which makes identical predictions, considers the stabilization or destabilization by substituents of the Wheland intermediates resulting from electrophilic attack at the &quot;ortho&quot;/&quot;para&quot; or &quot;meta&quot; positions. The Hammond postulate then dictates that the relative transition state energies will reflect the differences in the ground state energies of the Wheland intermediates. 

=== Carbonyls, sulfonic acids and nitro ===
Because of the full or partial positive charge on the element directly attached to the ring for each of these groups, they all have a moderate to strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (known as the -I effect). They also exhibit electron-withdrawing resonance effects, (known as the -M effect):
Thus, these groups make the aromatic ring very electron-poor (δ+) relative to benzene and, therefore, they strongly deactivate the ring (i.e. reactions proceed much slower in rings bearing these groups compared to those reactions in benzene.)

=== Anilines, phenols, and ethers (such as anisole) ===
Due to the electronegativity difference between carbon and oxygen / nitrogen, there will be a slight electron withdrawing effect through inductive effect (known as the –I effect). However, the other effect called resonance add electron density back to the ring (known as the +M effect) and dominate over that of inductive effect. Hence the result is that they are EDGs and &quot;ortho&quot;/&quot;para&quot; directors.

Phenol is an ortho/para director, but in a presence of base, the reaction is more rapid. It is due to the higher reactivity of phenolate anion. The negative oxygen was &#x27;forced&#x27; to give electron density to the carbons (because it has a negative charge, it has an extra +I effect). Even when cold and with neutral (and relatively weak) electrophiles, the reaction still occurs rapidly. 
=== Alkyl groups ===
Alkyl groups are electron donating groups. The carbon on that is sp3 hybridized and less electronegative than those that are sp2 hybridized. They have overlap on the carbon–hydrogen bonds (or carbon–carbon bonds in compounds like &quot;tert&quot;-butylbenzene) with the ring p orbital. Hence they are more reactive than benzene and are &quot;ortho&quot;/&quot;para&quot; directors.

=== Carboxylate ===
Inductively, the negatively charged carboxylate ion moderately repels the electrons in the bond attaching it to the ring. Thus, there is a weak electron-donating +I effect. There is an almost zero -M effect since the electron-withdrawing resonance capacity of the carbonyl group is effectively removed by the delocalisation of the negative charge of the anion on the oxygen. Thus overall the carboxylate group (unlike the carboxyl group) has an activating influence.
=== Alkylammonium and trifluoromethyl group ===
These groups have a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) either by virtue of their positive charge or because of the powerfully electronegativity of the halogens. There is no resonance effect because there are no orbitals or electron pairs which can overlap with those of the ring. The inductive effect acts like that for the carboxylate anion but in the opposite direction (i.e. it produces small positive charges on the &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; positions but not on the &quot;meta&quot; position and it destabilises the Wheland intermediate.) Hence these groups are deactivating and &quot;meta&quot; directing:
=== Halides&#x27; competing effects ===

==== Induction versus resonance ====
Fluorine is something of an anomaly in this circumstance. Above, it is described as a weak electron withdrawing group but this is only partly true. It is correct that fluorine has a -I effect, which results in electrons being withdrawn inductively. However, another effect that plays a role is the +M effect which adds electron density back into the benzene ring (thus having the opposite effect of the -I effect but by a different mechanism). This is called the mesomeric effect (hence +M) and the result for fluorine is that the +M effect approximately cancels out the -I effect. The effect of this for fluorobenzene at the &quot;para&quot; position is reactivity that is comparable to (or even higher than) that of benzene. Because inductive effects depends strongly on proximity, the &quot;meta&quot; and &quot;ortho&quot; positions of fluorobenzene are considerably less reactive than benzene. Thus, electrophilic aromatic substitution on fluorobenzene is strongly &quot;para&quot; selective.

This -I and +M effect is true for all halides - there is some electron withdrawing and donating character of each. To understand why the reactivity changes occur, we need to consider the orbital overlaps occurring in each. The valence orbitals of fluorine are the 2p orbitals which is the same for carbon - hence they will be very close in energy and orbital overlap will be favourable. Chlorine has 3p valence orbitals, hence the orbital energies will be further apart and the geometry less favourable, leading to less donation the stabilize the carbocationic intermediate, hence chlorobenzene is less reactive than fluorobenzene. However, bromobenzene and iodobenzene are about the same or a little more reactive than chlorobenzene, because although the resonance donation is even worse, the inductive effect is also weakened due to their lower electronegativities. Thus the overall order of reactivity is U-shaped, with a minimum at chlorobenzene/bromobenzene (relative nitration rates compared to benzene = 1 in parentheses): PhF (0.18) &gt; PhCl (0.064) ~ PhBr (0.060) &lt; PhI (0.12). But still, all halobenzenes reacts slower than benzene itself.

Notice that iodobenzene is still less reactive than fluorobenzene because polarizability plays a role as well. This can also explain why phosphorus in phosphanes can&#x27;t donate electron density to carbon through induction (i.e. +I effect) although it is less electronegative than carbon (2.19 vs 2.55, see electronegativity list) and why hydroiodic acid (pKa = -10) being much more acidic than hydrofluoric acid (pKa = 3). (That&#x27;s 1013 times more acidic than hydrofluoric acid)

==== Directing effect ====
Due to the lone pair of electrons, halogen groups are available for donating electrons. Hence they are therefore &quot;ortho&quot; / &quot;para&quot; directors.

=== Nitroso group ===

==== Induction ====
Due to the electronegativity difference between carbon and nitrogen, the nitroso group has a relatively strong -I effect, but not as strong as the nitro group. (Positively charged nitrogen atoms on alkylammonium cations and on nitro groups have a much stronger -I effect)

==== Resonance ====

The nitroso group has both a +M and -M effect, but the -M effect is more favorable.

Nitrogen has a lone pair of electrons. However, the lone pair of its monomer form is unfavourable to donate through resonance. Only the dimer form is available for +M effect. However, the dimer form is less stable in a solution. Therefore, the nitroso group is less available to donate electrons.

Oppositely, withdrawing electron density is more favourable: (see the picture on the right).As a result, the nitroso group is a deactivator. However, it has available to donate electron density to the benzene ring during the Wheland intermediate, making it still being an &quot;ortho&quot; / &quot;para&quot; director.

== Steric effects ==
There are 2 &quot;ortho&quot; positions, 2 &quot;meta&quot; positions and 1 &quot;para&quot; position on benzene when a group is attached to it. When a group is an &quot;ortho / para&quot; director with &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; positions reacting with the same partial rate factor, we would expect twice as much &quot;ortho&quot; product as &quot;para&quot; product due to this statistical effect. However, the partial rate factors at the &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; positions are not generally equal. In the case of a fluorine substituent, for instance, the &quot;ortho&quot; partial rate factor is much smaller than the &quot;para&quot;, due to a stronger inductive withdrawal effect at the &quot;ortho&quot; position. Aside from these effects, there is often also a steric effect, due to increased steric hindrance at the &quot;ortho&quot; position but not the &quot;para&quot; position, leading to a larger amount of the &quot;para&quot; product.

The effect is illustrated for electrophilic aromatic substitutions with alkyl substituents of differing steric demand for electrophilic aromatic nitration.

The methyl group in toluene is small and will lead the &quot;ortho&quot; product being the major product. On the other hand, the &quot;t&quot;-butyl group is very bulky (there are 3 methyl groups attached to a single carbon) and will lead the &quot;para&quot; product as the major one. Even with toluene, the product is not 2:1 but having a slightly less &quot;ortho&quot; product.

== Directing effect on multiple substituents ==
When two substituents are already present on the ring, the third substituent&#x27;s new location is relatively predictable. If the existing substituents reinforce or the molecule is highly symmetric, there may be no ambiguity. Otherwise:
# The most-activating substituent usually controls over the less-activating one. 
# In particular, &quot;ortho&quot;/&quot;para&quot; directors control over &quot;meta&quot; ones. 
# When multiple substituents are comparably activating, steric hindrance dominates regioselectivity. 
# In particular, the position between two substituents, each &quot;meta&quot; to the other, reacts last.

<text>Selective laser sintering (SLS) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique that uses a laser as the power and heat source to sinter powdered material (typically nylon or polyamide), aiming the laser automatically at points in space defined by a 3D model, binding the material together to create a solid structure. It is similar to selective laser melting; the two are instantiations of the same concept but differ in technical details. SLS (as well as the other mentioned AM techniques) is a relatively new technology that so far has mainly been used for rapid prototyping and for low-volume production of component parts. Production roles are expanding as the commercialization of AM technology improves.

==History==
Selective laser sintering (SLS) was developed and patented by Dr. Carl Deckard and academic adviser, Dr. Joe Beaman at the University of Texas at Austin in the mid-1980s, under sponsorship of DARPA. Deckard and Beaman were involved in the resulting start up company Desk Top Manufacturing (DTM) Corp, established to design and build the SLS machines. In 2001, 3D Systems, the biggest competitor to DTM Corp. and SLS technology, acquired DTM Corp.. The most recent patent regarding Deckard&#x27;s SLS technology was issued January 28, 1997 and expired January 28, 2014.

A similar process was patented without being commercialized by R. F. Housholder in 1979.

As SLS requires the use of high-powered lasers it is often too expensive, not to mention possibly too dangerous, to use in the home. The associated expense and potential danger of SLS printing due to lack of commercially available laser systems with Class-1 safety enclosures means that the home market for SLS printing is not as large as the market for other additive manufacturing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM).

==Technology==
An additive manufacturing layer technology, SLS involves the use of a high power laser (for example, a carbon dioxide laser) to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired three-dimensional shape. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part (for example from a CAD file or scan data) on the surface of a powder bed. After each cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the part is completed.
Because finished part density depends on peak laser power, rather than laser duration, a SLS machine typically uses a pulsed laser. The SLS machine preheats the bulk powder material in the powder bed somewhat below its melting point, to make it easier for the laser to raise the temperature of the selected regions the rest of the way to the melting point.

In contrast with SLA and FDM, which most often require special support structures to fabricate overhanging designs, SLS does not need a separate feeder for support material because the part being constructed is surrounded by unsintered powder at all times. This allows for the construction of previously impossible geometries. Also, since the machine&#x27;s chamber is always filled with powder material the fabrication of multiple parts has a far lower impact on the overall difficulty and price of the design because through a technique known as &#x27;Nesting&#x27;, where multiple parts can be positioned to fit within the boundaries of the machine. One design aspect which should be observed however is that with SLS it is &#x27;impossible&#x27; to fabricate a hollow but fully enclosed element. This is because the unsintered powder within the element could not be drained.

Since patents have started to expire, affordable home printers have become possible, but the heating process is still an obstacle, with a power consumption of up to 5 kW and temperatures having to be controlled within 2 °C for the three stages of preheating, melting and storing before removal. 

== Materials ==
The quality of printed structures depends on the various factors include powder properties such as particle size and shape, density, roughness, and porosity. Furthermore, the particle distribution and their thermal properties affect a lot on the flowability of the powder.

Commercially-available materials used in SLS come in powder form and include, but are not limited to, polymers such as polyamides (PA), polystyrenes (PS), thermoplastic elastomers (TPE), and polyaryletherketones (PAEK). Polyamides are the most commonly used SLS materials due to their ideal sintering behavior as a semi-crystalline thermoplastic, resulting in parts with desirable mechanical properties. Polycarbonate (PC) is a material of high interest for SLS due to its high toughness, thermal stability, and flame resistance; however, such amorphous polymers processed by SLS tend to result in parts with diminished mechanical properties, dimensional accuracy and thus are limited to applications where these are of low importance. Metal materials are not commonly used in SLS since the development of selective laser melting.

=== Powder production ===
Powder particles are typically produced by cryogenic grinding in a ball mill at temperatures well below the glass transition temperature of the material, which can be reached by running the grinding process with added cryogenic materials such as dry ice (dry grinding), or mixtures of liquid nitrogen and organic solvents (wet grinding). The process can result in spherical or irregular shaped particles as low as five microns in diameter. Powder particle size distributions are typically gaussian and range from 15 to 100 microns in diameter, although this can be customized to suit different layer thicknesses in the SLS process. Chemical binder coatings can be applied to the powder surfaces post-process; these coatings aid in the sintering process and are especially helpful to form composite material parts such as with alumina particles coated with thermoset epoxy resin.

=== Sintering mechanisms ===

Sintering in SLS primarily occurs in the liquid state when the powder particles forms a micro-melt layer at the surface, resulting in a reduction in viscosity and the formation of a concave radial bridge between particles, known as necking, due to the material&#x27;s response to lower its surface energy. In the case of coated powders, the purpose of the laser is to melt the surface coating which will act as a binder. Solid state sintering is also a contributing factor, albeit with a much reduced influence, and occurs at temperatures below the melting temperature of the material. The principal driving force behind the process is again the material&#x27;s response to lower its free energy state resulting in diffusion of molecules across particles.

== Applications ==
SLS technology is in wide use at many industries around the world due to its ability to easily make complex geometries with little to no added manufacturing effort. Its most common application is in prototype parts early in the design cycle such as for investment casting patterns, automotive hardware, and wind tunnel models. SLS is also increasingly being used in limited-run manufacturing to produce end-use parts for aerospace, military, medical, pharmaceutical, and electronics hardware. On a shop floor, SLS can be used for rapid manufacturing of tooling, jigs, and fixtures.

== Advantages ==

* The sintered powder bed is fully self-supporting, allowing for:
** high overhanging angles (0 to 45 degrees from the horizontal plane) 
** complex geometries embedded deep into parts, such as conformal cooling channels
** batch production of multiple parts produced in 3D arrays, a process called nesting
* Parts possess high strength and stiffness
* Good chemical resistance
* Various finishing possibilities (e.g., metallization, stove enameling, vibratory grinding, tub coloring, bonding, powder, coating, flocking)
* Bio compatible according to EN ISO 10993-1 and USP/level VI/121 °C
* Complex parts with interior components can be built without trapping the material inside and altering the surface from support removal.
* Fastest additive manufacturing process for printing functional, durable, prototypes or end user parts
* Wide variety of materials with characteristics of strength, durability, and functionality
* Due to the reliable mechanical properties, parts can often substitute typical injection molding plastics

== Disadvantages ==

* parts have porous surfaces; these can be sealed by several different post-processing methods such as cyanoacrylate coatings, or by hot isostatic pressing.

<text>Utica School of Commerce was a for-profit business college with three locations in upstate New York. Its main campus was in Utica, New York and it had branch campuses in Canastota, New York and Oneonta, New York. The college was founded in 1896 and closed at the end of 2016.

== History ==
The Utica School of Commerce was founded by Thomas J. Risinger in 1896 in response to an early demand for specialized training in commerce and finance. His son, William S. Risinger, joined him in 1904 and, in 1919, became the head of the school. He retained this position until his retirement on March 1, 1966, at which time a new partnership was formed by Eleanor P., granddaughter of the founder, and Roger L. Williams. On July 1, 1976, they incorporated the school under the laws of New York. Philip M. Williams and John L. Crossley, sole stockholders of the Utica School of Commerce, Inc., were two of the Trustees on the Board of Trustees of the Utica School of Commerce, Inc.

At its founding in 1896, the school was located on the third floor of the Oneida National Bank Building on the corner of Genesee and Bleecker Streets. In 1915, the school expanded its facilities and moved to the Mayro Building in which it had its facilities for 63 years. On September 11, 1978, the Utica School of Commerce moved to its final location at 201 Bleecker Street. In February 1985, the Utica School of Commerce opened its Madison County Branch at the Washington Avenue Community Center in Oneida, and in March 1986, moved to the New York State Jaycees&#x27; Building on Route 5 in Canastota. The college opened its new campus adjacent to its former location in September 1992. USC opened its Oneonta Branch in September 1985 in the Verizon Building at 17 Elm Street, Oneonta.

Enrollment peaked in the 2009-2010 school year and declined afterwards. Before its closing, the school had two-year and certificate programs for business administration, administrative specialist, health service management, non-profit agency management, and information technology. USC closed on December 23, 2016, due to low enrollment numbers. Students were given the option to transfer to Bryant and Stratton College in Syracuse or to make arrangements with local community colleges.

<doc id="841771" wikidata="Q380826" url="?curid=841771" title="Aelius Herodianus">
<text>Aelius Herodianus () or Herodian (fl. 2nd century CE) was a Greek historian and one of the most celebrated grammarians of Greco-Roman antiquity. He is usually known as Herodian except when there is a danger of confusion with the historian also named Herodian.

Herodian was the son of Apollonius Dyscolus and was born in Alexandria. From there he seems to have moved to Rome, where he gained the favour of the emperor Marcus Aurelius, to whom he dedicated a work on prosody.

== Works ==
Herodian was held in very high esteem by subsequent grammarians; Priscian describes him as &quot;maximus auctor artis grammaticae&quot; (&quot;the greatest creator of grammatical art&quot;). He wrote many works, but they are mostly fragmentary and it is very difficult to compile an accurate list of them. In numerous instances it is impossible to tell whether the titles given by writers who quote from his works are distinct treatises, or only portions of larger works. In addition, there are ongoing debates over which works were written by him and which were not. Some works by lesser-known figures are known to have been reattributed to Herodian, presumably in order to increase the prestige of the works.

In total some fifty titles are known in connection with Herodian&#x27;s name. The main works attached to his name (both rightly and wrongly) are as follows (the most usual way of citing each title is highlighted in bold):

* &quot;On peculiar style&quot; (). Probably the only complete work of Herodian&#x27;s to have survived.
* &quot;Categories&quot; (, &quot;Partitiones&quot;). Devoted to explanations of difficult words found in Homer; many important quotations from the &quot;Partitiones&quot; are found in the scholia on Homer.
* &quot;General prosody&quot; (, or , or ; &quot;De prosodia catholica&quot;), in twenty books. Herodian dedicated this work to Marcus Aurelius. It covered prosody and etymology. Two epitomes and an index survive. It is possible that several other titles known to us were in fact parts of the &quot;Prosody&quot;: namely the &quot;Homeric prosody&quot; (); &quot;Attic prosody&quot; (); and &quot;Anomalous prosody&quot; (). A work entitled &quot;On accents&quot; (), attributed to Arcadius of Antioch but compiled by a later grammarian, Theodosius of Byzantium, seems to be an extract from Herodian&#x27;s &quot;Prosody&quot;.
* &quot;On figures&quot; (, &quot;De figuris&quot;). This work is known to be spurious, i.e. it is transmitted under Herodian&#x27;s name but was not written by him. The author is referred to as &quot;pseudo-Herodian&quot;.
* &quot;Philetaerus&quot; (). This work is also known to be spurious; it has been suggested that it was in fact by Cornelianus.

<text>James Maurice Wilson (6 November 1836, Castletown, Isle of Man – 15 April 1931, Steep, Hampshire) was a British priest in the Church of England as well as a theologian, teacher and astronomer.

==Early life==

Wilson and his twin brother, Edward Pears Wilson, attended King William&#x27;s College on the Isle of Man from August 1848 to midsummer 1853 (his twin died in December 1856). Their father Edward, vicar of Nocton in Lincolnshire, had earlier been headmaster there. According to his autobiography, Wilson had a rather unhappy time at King William&#x27;s College. He later studied at Sedbergh School (between 1853-1855).

Wilson entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1855, where he was Senior Wrangler in 1859. He received a Master of Arts degree in 1862 and was a fellow from 1859 to 1868.

==Career==

Wilson was a major figure in the development and reform of Victorian public schools and promoted the teaching of science, which had until then been neglected. He was maths and science master at Rugby School from 1859 to 1879 and headmaster of Clifton College from 1879 to 1890.

He made astronomical observations (particularly of double stars) at Temple Observatory at Rugby with his former student George Mitchell Seabroke. Temple Observatory was named after Frederick Temple, headmaster of Rugby School, who later became Bishop of Exeter and Archbishop of Canterbury.

Wilson was encouraged by Temple to write the textbook &quot;Elementary Geometry&quot;, which was published in 1868. Until that time, Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; had remained the standard textbook used in British schools.

With Joseph Gledhill and Edward Crossley, Wilson co-wrote &quot;Handbook of Double Stars&quot; in 1879, which became a standard reference work in astronomy. His astronomical observations seem to have come to an end after he left Rugby and went to Clifton.

While at Clifton, he successfully pushed for the creation of St Agnes Park in Bristol, as part of a plan to improve the lives of the urban poor.

In April 1890, he addressed girls at St Leonards School, stressing the connection of religion with their possible role as university students and social workers whilst assisting women such as Octavia Hill to alleviate the plight of the &quot;labouring masses, and in particular the (poor) women and girls of England&quot;. 

After his teaching career, he became Vicar of Rochdale, Archdeacon of Manchester from 1890 to 1905, a canon of Worcester Cathedral from 1905 to 1926 and vice-dean of the cathedral. He was Hulsean lecturer at Cambridge in 1898; Lady Margaret Preacher at Cambridge in 1900; and Lecturer in Pastoral Theology at Cambridge in 1902.

He wholeheartedly accepted the theory of evolution and its implications for the literal interpretation of the Bible. He gave two lectures in 1892 in which he accepted Darwinism and argued that it was compatible with a higher view of Christianity; the lectures were published by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, which had a few years earlier strongly opposed Darwinian ideas.

In 1921, he served for one year as president of The Mathematical Association of the UK.

In 1925 he wrote an essay entitled &quot;The Religious Effect of the Idea of Evolution&quot;. He wrote a number of books, including &quot;Life after Death&quot; &quot;with replies by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&quot; in 1920. In addition to spiritual works, he co-wrote an astronomy book on double stars (mentioned above) and mathematical books on geometry and conic sections. He contributed the article &quot;On two fragments of geometrical treatises found in Worcester Cathedral&quot; to the &quot;Mathematical Gazette&quot; (March 1911, p. 19).

==Family==

In 1868 he married his first wife, Annie Elizabeth Moore. She was a cousin once removed of Arthur William Moore, a proponent of the Manx language. Their first child was the leading civil servant Mona Wilson. His first wife died after giving birth to their fourth child in 1878.

In 1883 he married his second wife, Georgina Mary Talbot. Their sons included Sir Arnold Wilson, who became a British colonial administrator in Baghdad and was killed in action in World War II; 2nd Lt. Hugh Stanley Wilson (1885–1915), who died in World War I and is buried in the military cemetery at Hébuterne, Pas de Calais; and the tenor Sir Steuart Wilson. From his notes, Arnold and Steuart published the posthumous &quot;James M. Wilson: An Autobiography&quot; (London, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1932).
