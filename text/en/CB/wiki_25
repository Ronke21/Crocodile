<text>San Margherita is an unincorporated neighborhood directly west of Columbus, Ohio, half falling into Norwich Township and the other half in Franklin Township. The area was settled in the early 20th century by Italian immigrants working for the Marble Cliff Quarry Company. Though once a robust and rural community, San Margherita is in danger of vanishing. Many of the original homes and locally owned businesses in the neighborhood have been demolished.

== History ==
San Margherita is located west of Columbus, across the Scioto River. Between 1880 and 1920, the area was populated by Italian immigrants who worked in the nearby Marble Cliff Quarry. The majority of the immigrants came from the commune of Pettorano sul Gizio in the Province of L&#x27;Aquila in the Abruzzo region of Italy, where the patron Saint Margaret of Cortona became the hamlet&#x27;s namesake. Originally, the quarry provided workers with shack-like homes placed along McKinley Avenue and the railroad tracks. Quarry workers who amounted enough wealth moved on to construct homes along the south side of Trabue Road.

At its founding, the area was not connected to Columbus by train. As such, residents of the neighborhood kept livestock and grew some of their own produce. The community was bound together by mutual language and customs, shared work and problems, and by deep family friendships. The isolation prompted members of the neighborhood to drive for a church of their own in 1921. Thirteen local families each pledged $50 and received a land donation to begin construction. The original Saint Margaret of Cortona Church was constructed at 3388 Trabue Road. In 1936, the parish hall was built, and in 1955 the rectory finished construction. An increase in the size of the congregation prompted a need for a new church. In 1968, the new church by the same name was constructed at 1600 Hague Avenue.

Twenty-eight pre-World War II homes were constructed along Trabue Rd, and post-War homes were constructed a few blocks south on Hague Avenue until the site of the new Saint Margaret of Cortona Church. Since then, the neighborhood has been in decline, with many descendants of the original residents moving to nearby neighborhoods like Grandview Heights or Marble Cliff Village. In 2003, the City of Columbus acquired three homes and three commercial properties, including a Marathon gas station and Spiro&#x27;s Lounge, for demolition to widen the road and ease traffic on Trabue Road between Dublin Road and McKinley Avenue.

In 2008, The Robert Weiler Company acquired a 10-acre tract of land at 3445 Trabue Rd. In an article by &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;, company president, Skip Weiler, stated that the company had been amassing property in San Margherita for commercial development and was looking to develop a supermarket-anchored center along Trabue Rd. to serve both Upper Arlington and the West Side.

In 2017, Wagenbrenner Development purchased a portion of the 607-acre Marble Cliff Quarry, with the intention of remediating the site&#x27;s brownfields to create a mixed-use development and a new Columbus Metro Park. In 2021, the first phase of the park opened to the public.

== Geography ==

Neighborhood boundaries between Penn Central and Conrail train tracks, following Trabue Road and venturing south until 1600 Hague Avenue. The Saint Margaret of Cortona Catholic Church parish boundaries extend north to Roberts Road, east to the Scioto River, south to Fisher Road, and west to Jones Road.

== Landmarks and structures ==

=== Saint Margaret of Cortona Catholic Church ===

Originally located at 3388 Trabue Road. Thirteen local families spearheaded the drive for a local church in the predominantly Roman Catholic community. These families each donated $50 towards construction of the church, while another local family donated the 2.2 acre lot for the church. In 1921, the church was built, within 5 years of the finished construction date, the church was debt free. The frame parish hall was constructed in 1936, and the rectory was finished in 1955. Beginning in 1921, the parish held an annual 3-day festival in late July to honor the patron saints of the residents&#x27; birthplaces in Italy, including a parade down Trabue Rd. carrying statues of St. Margaret, St. Anne, St. Lucy, St. Anthony, and St. Joseph. By the 1950s the parish&#x27;s boundaries were set stretching east until the Scioto River, west to Jones Road, north to Roberts Road, and south to Fisher Road.

A growing congregation created the need for a larger church. The new Saint Margaret of Cortona was built in 1968, located on 1600 Hague Avenue. In 1987, St. Margaret of Cortona Church at 3388 Trabue Rd. was sold and scheduled for demolition due to disrepair and low attendance for daily mass. The Church was sold to Joseph Baljak, a parish member since 1976, under the agreement that Baljak could repurpose the rectory and parish hall, but the church be demolished. Until the old St. Margaret&#x27;s church was destroyed, daily mass was held at 3388 Trabue Rd. church and Sunday mass and religious ceremonies were held at the 1600 Hague Ave. church. The annual festival was moved to the Hague Ave. church, but the parade evolved to include a procession from the old church to the new one.

Saint Margaret of Cortona Catholic Church currently serves 600 families. Father Jeff Rimelspach is the current pastor, with Deacon Andy Naporano serving as the presiding deacon.

=== Johnnie&#x27;s Tavern ===
Located on 3503 Trabue Rd. Johnnie&#x27;s Tavern is a &quot;blink and you&#x27;ll miss it&quot; bar specializing in serving burgers and sandwiches six days a week from 11am to 10pm, Monday through Saturday. The tavern was founded by Dominic &quot;Johnnie&quot; Lombardi, the son of one of the founding members of San Margherita, in 1946. The restaurant features a limited menu and beers on draft.

=== Marble Cliff Quarry ===

Quarrying activity began as early as 1851, but became more extensive in 1892 with the arrival of Sylvio A. Casparis. Casparis Stone Co. merged with three other companies to for Marble Cliff Quarries, which at one point employed as many as 500 men. Sections of the original quarry remain in operation, now by American Aggregates Co. The remainder of the quarry has since been filled in and developed for residential use, including Marble Cliff Commons apartments and Marble Cliff Crossing, a 100 single-family and 60 double-family subdivision built between 1998 and 2003.

In 2017, Thrive Companies, formerally Wagenbrenner, purchased the quarry&#x27;s 600-acre site, of which 220 acres were turned into a Columbus Metro Park, and a development featuring apartments, townhomes, condominiums, and retail. On November 30, 2021, the first phase of the 225-acre Quarry Trails Metro Park opened to the public.

== Residential ==
The homes along Trabue Road sit on the 60Â ft fronts of one acre lots. The large backyards were used to grow vegetables and cultivate grapes in small vineyards. Early residents of the neighborhood would tend to chickens and hogs, providing help to their neighbors during slaughter and harvest times. Two dozen of the original homes still remain on Trabue Road.

<doc id="803982" wikidata="Q1604577" url="?curid=803982" title="Helsinki-86">
<text>The CTAG (, Human Rights Defense Group) Helsinki-86 was founded on 10 July 1986 in the Latvian port town of LiepÄja by three workers: Linards GrantiÅÅ¡, Raimonds Bitenieks, and MÄrtiÅÅ¡ Bariss. Its name refers to the Helsinki Accords and the year of its founding.

Helsinki-86 was the first openly anti-Communist organization, but also the first openly organized opposition to the Soviet regime, in the former Soviet Union, setting an example for other ethnic minorities&#x27; pro-independence movements.

== Role in the &quot;Singing Revolution&quot; ==
Helsinki-86 was an important early actor during the &quot;Singing Revolution&quot; in Latvia, during which the country regained its independence from the USSR.

By the beginning of 1988, there were nearly twenty members of Helsinki-86. The most prominent among them, aside from the founding members were Rolands Silaraups, Konstantins Pupurs, Juris VidiÅÅ¡, Juris Ziemelis, Alfreds ZariÅÅ¡, Heino LÄma, and Edmunds Cirvelis. By mid-1988, some of the most active members had been expelled from the USSR by the Soviet authorities.

On June 14, 1987, the group organised the first peaceful anti-Communist demonstration with a customary placing of flowers at the base of the Freedom Monument () in the Latvian capital, Riga. This event marked a turning point the rebirth of national courage and self-confidence in Latvia.

On August 23, 1987, the group organized a protest demonstration against the MolotovâRibbentrop Pact, which among numerous other historical events resulted in the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, during the administration of Latvian President and Prime Minister KÄrlis Ulmanis. Historically, on November 18, 1987, Latvian Independence Day was celebrated for the first time since 1940.

On March 25, 1988 the group called for the Latvian people to gather by the Freedom Monument in Riga to commemorate the victims of Soviet terror. On that particular day, it became evident that the pro-independence leadership began a gradual transition of influence from Helsinki-86 to moderate Latvian Communists and nationally prominent figures, who openly invited Latvian citizens for the first time to come &quot;en masse&quot; to a different Riga location: the Cemetery of Fallen Soldiers.

On June 14, 1988, for the first time since the Soviet occupation, the group openly carried the Latvian national flag through the streets of Riga.

== Since independence ==

A political party based on the Helsinki-86 organization was officially registered in 1998. It was unsuccessful in the elections for Latvia&#x27;s Saeima (parliament) later that year, as well as in the 2001 municipal elections.

<doc id="803987" wikidata="Q317920" url="?curid=803987" title="Simon Vouet">
<text>Simon Vouet (; 9 January 1590 â 30 June 1649) was a French painter who studied and rose to prominence in Italy before being summoned by Louis XIII to serve as Premier peintre du Roi in France. He and his studio of artists created religious and mythological paintings, portraits, frescoes, tapestries, and massive decorative schemes for the king and for wealthy patrons, including Richelieu. During this time, &quot;Vouet was indisputably the leading artist in Paris,&quot; and was immensely influential in introducing the Italian Baroque style of painting to France. He was also, according to Pierre Rosenberg, &quot;without doubt one of the outstanding seventeenth-century draughtsmen, equal to Annibale Carracci and Lanfranco.&quot;

==Career==
Simon Vouet was born on January 9, 1590, in Paris. His father Laurent was a painter in Paris and taught him the rudiments of art. Simon&#x27;s brother Aubin Vouet was also a painter, as also was Simon&#x27;s wife Virginia da Vezzo, their son Louis-RenÃ© Vouet, their two sons-in-law, Michel Dorigny and FranÃ§ois Tortebat, and their grandson Ludovico Dorigny.
Simon began his career as a portrait painter. At age 14 he travelled to England to paint a commissioned portrait and in 1611 was part of the entourage of the Baron de Sancy, French ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, for the same purpose. From Constantinople he went to Venice in 1612 and was in Rome by 1614.

He remained in Italy until 1627, mostly in Rome where the Baroque style was becoming dominant. He received a pension from the King of France and his patrons included the Barberini family, Cassiano dal Pozzo, Paolo Giordano Orsini and Vincenzo Giustiniani. He also visited other parts of Italy: Venice; Bologna (where the Carracci family had their academy); Genoa (where, from 1620 to 1622, he worked for the Doria princes); and Naples. 

He was a natural academic, who absorbed what he saw and studied, and distilled it in his painting: Caravaggio&#x27;s dramatic lighting; Italian Mannerism; Paolo Veronese&#x27;s color and &quot;di sotto in su&quot; or foreshortened perspective; and the art of Carracci, Guercino, Lanfranco and Guido Reni.

While in Rome he befriended artist Artimesia Gentileschi and painted her portrait in 1623.

Vouet&#x27;s immense success in Rome led to his election as president of the Accademia di San Luca in 1624. His most prominent official commission of the Italian period was an altarpiece for St Peter&#x27;s in Rome (1625â1626), destroyed at some time after 1725 (though fragments remain.)

In response to a royal summons, Vouet returned to France in 1627, where he was made Premier peintre du Roi. Louis XIII commissioned portraits, tapestry cartoons and paintings from him for the Palais du Louvre, the Palais du Luxembourg and the ChÃ¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. In 1632, he worked for Cardinal Richelieu at the Palais-Royal and the ChÃ¢teau de Malmaison. In 1631 he decorated the chÃ¢teau of the prÃ©sident de Fourcy, at Chessy, the hÃ´tel Bullion, the chÃ¢teau of Marshal d&#x27;Effiat at Chilly, the hÃ´tel of the Duc dâAumont, the SÃ©guier chapel, and the gallery of the ChÃ¢teau de Wideville.

Today, a number of Vouet&#x27;s paintings are lost, and &quot;only two major decorative schemes survive, those for the chateaux of Colombes and Chessy,&quot; but the details and imagery of many lost works are known from engravings by Michel Dorigny, FranÃ§ois Tortebat, and Claude Mellan.

==Personal life==
In 1626 he married Virginia da Vezzo, &quot;a painter in her own right... known for her beauty,&quot; who modeled as the Madonna and female saints for Vouet&#x27;s religious commissions. The couple would have five children. Virginia Vouet died in France in 1638. Two years later Vouet married a French widow, Radegonde BÃ©ranger, with whom he had three more children.

==Legacy==

As one art historian writes, &quot;When Vouet returned to Paris in 1627, French art was painfully provincial and, by Italian standards, more than a quarter of a century behind the times. Vouet introduced the latest fashions, educated a group of talented young artistsâand the public as wellâand brought Paris up to date.&quot;

Vouet&#x27;s style became uniquely his own, but was distinctly Italian, importing the Italian Baroque into France. A French contemporary, lacking the term &quot;Baroque,&quot; said, &quot;In his time the art of painting began to be practiced here in a nobler and more beautiful way than ever before.&quot; In his anticipation of the &quot;two-dimensional, curvilinear freedom of rococo compositions a hundred years later...Vouet should perhaps be counted among the more important sources of eighteenth-century painting.&quot; In his works for the French royal court, &quot;Vouet&#x27;s importance as a formulator of official decorations is in some ways comparable to that of Rubens.&quot;
Vouet&#x27;s sizeable &quot;atelier&quot; or workshop produced a whole school of French painters for the following generation. His most influential pupil was Charles le Brun, who organized all the interior decorative painting at Versailles and dictated the official style at the court of Louis XIV of France, but who jealously excluded Vouet from the AcadÃ©mie Royale in 1648.
Vouet&#x27;s other students included Valentin de Boulogne (the main figure of the French &quot;Caravaggisti&quot;), FranÃ§ois Perrier, Nicolas Chaperon, Michel Corneille the Elder, Charles PoÃ«rson, Pierre Daret, Charles Alphonse du Fresnoy, Pierre Mignard, Eustache Le Sueur, Claude Mellan, the Flemish artist Abraham Willaerts, Michel Dorigny, and FranÃ§ois Tortebat. These last two became his sons-in-law. AndrÃ© Le NÃ´tre, the garden designer of Versailles, was a student of Vouet. Also in Vouet&#x27;s circle was a friend from his Italian years, Claude Vignon.

During his lifetime, writes Arnaud Brejon de LavergnÃ©e, &quot;Vouet&#x27;s stature increased continually, his paintings becoming ever more beautiful, particularly in the last decade.&quot; But, &quot;although his career was as brilliant as can be imagined,&quot; Vouet &quot;played no role in the foundation of the AcadÃ©mie Royale&quot; that was to be so dominant after his death, &quot;and was neglected by the biographers and more influential amateurs. Between 1660 and 1690 only Poussin and Rubens were taken seriously...and later generations drew their own conclusions from this.&quot; Further eroding his legacy, &quot;Vouet was undoubtedly at his greatest in these ensembles [his magnificent decorative schemes for chateaux and churches], most of which were destroyed during the Revolution&quot; of the next century.

Though never entirely forgotten by connoisseurs and collectors (such as William Suida), Vouet fell into a relative obscurity that was not remedied until William R. Crelly&#x27;s monograph of 1962, and then by the major retrospective of Vouet&#x27;s work at the Grand Palais in Paris in 1990â1991 with its colloquium and catalogue, which Brejon de LavergnÃ©e says fulfilled &quot;its aim of rehabilitating the artist.&quot; &quot;The Simon Vouet retrospectiveâ¦is still vividly remembered. Since then, studies of the painter, his circle and his students have abounded, defining the image of the artist and his workshop ever more clearly.&quot;

The exhibition&#x27;s organizer, Jacques Thuillier, &quot;is surely justified in claiming the altarpiece of the &quot;Presentation of Jesus in the Temple&quot; as among the greatest masterpieces of seventeenth-century monumental painting,&quot; writes Brejon de LavergnÃ©e, who further asserts that in the artist&#x27;s works of the 1640s, such as &quot;Saint Francis of Paola Resuscitating a Child&quot;, &quot;one can see Vouet concluding his career with pictures of an immense gravity informed by an intense spiritual energy. Images of the greatest force, these paintings constitute the apogee of French seventeenth-century painting.&quot;

<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 15 June 1917 to elect members of the House of Representatives of the Dutch Parliament. The elections were held following the Pacification of 1917, an agreement between the seven parties with seats in parliament to allow a change in the constitution to introduce universal manhood suffrage and proportional representation. The parties cooperated to create a supermajority to pass the reforms. Voting did not take place in 50 constituencies where the incumbent ran unopposed. These seats were filled on 5 June. 

In the other 50 constituencies with opposition candidates, voting was held on 15 June. The majoritarian two-round system was in effect and a second round was required in the Amsterdam II constituency, which was held on 22 June, and saw Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party candidate Adriaan Gerhard re-elected.

1,078,205 citizens were eligible to vote of which 230,310 cast a vote, representing a turnout of 21%.

<text>The NorrisâHulse Professorship of Divinity is one of the senior professorships in divinity at the University of Cambridge.

==History==
The Norrisian chair was founded in 1777 by a bequest from John Norris. Among the original stipulations of the bequest were that the holder should be between 30 and 60 years old, and that he should be fined 21 shillings from his salary if any student at his lectures were not provided with copies of the Old and New Testaments, and a Pearson on the Creed. 

John Hulse (1708â1790) was an English clergyman from Middlewich, Cheshire. On his death, he bequeathed a large proportion of his estate to found a prize essay, two scholarships, and the positions of &#x27;Hulsean Lecturer&#x27; and &#x27;Christian Advocate&#x27;. The Hulsean Lecturer was originally required to deliver 20 sermons each year on the evidence of Christianity or scriptural difficulties, and the position continues to this day, although the number of lectures has been reduced greatly. In 1860 the Christian Advocate became the &#x27;Hulsean Professor of Divinity&#x27;.

In 1934 the Norrisian and Hulsean Professorships were merged to form the NorrisâHulse Professorship. The expertise of the incumbent is generally expected to include philosophical theology, although the post does not formally require this.

In 2005 the NorrisâHulse professorship was frozen by the University of Cambridge. Then on 18 October 2006, the university announced the election of Sarah Coakley to the position. Upon the retirement of Professor Coakley, the university conducted an international search that resulted in the appointment of Catherine Pickstock to the position in March 2018.

<doc id="803997" wikidata="Q4943849" url="?curid=803997" title="Boot worship">
<text>Boot worship is the extreme adulation of boots in BDSM, usually carried out while the footwear is being worn by the dominant partner.

It is related to foot worship in a derivative way, in that the adulation may really be attributable to the proximity of the boots to their master/mistress. The foot is usually considered one of the &quot;lowest&quot; and least appreciated parts of the body, and it is a kind of humiliation to be kissing and licking someone&#x27;s foot.

In âboot worshipâ, the humiliation goes one step further. The submissive willingly worships the dominant partner&#x27;s boots, and often without even being asked to. This reverence for the footwear that encloses the dominant partner&#x27;s foot is sometimes an expression of extreme devotion or loyalty, sometimes a concrete admission of inferiority or defeat, and sometimes both. 

==Definition and variants==
Thus, boot worship may include sniffing or inhaling from worn boots, as well as licking, kissing or cleaning their exteriors by licking. Other activities include polishing of the boot, and chewing and eating of leather shoes or boots. 

Sometimes, the dominant will choke the submissive by forcefully inserting their booted feet in the submissive&#x27;s mouth. The dominant can also kick the submissive while wearing boots. The dominant can make the submissive eat food smashed by their boots, or even the food that sticks to the bottom of boots. Boots are also used by the dominant for ballbusting. 

It may also consist, more passively, of the submissive lying prone and being &quot;trampled&quot; by the dominant partner. Heeled boots may lend themselves to sucking, in an approximation of fellatio, anal and urethra insertion. The dominant partner can also sometimes beat the submissive with the footwear while wearing it. 

They can also have the submissive lying down in front of them, and then place their boots over the submissive&#x27;s mouth, face, or body instead of the floor.

&quot;Bootlicking&quot; also has a political connotation of being a sycophant or having &quot;deference to power undertaken entirely for its own sake, rather than out of fear or even material gain.&quot;

The following can be considered as more extreme situations. 1. The dominant may slap the submissive&#x27;s face using booted feet instead of hands. This practice may be among the harder practices since the pain it causes is rather significant. 2. Full-weight-face-standing is another cruel play. As its name suggests, the dominant may stand completely on the face of the slave, crushing any resistance. 3. Multi-trampling. A group of sadistic doms could trample one slave at the same time. This could be big humiliation for the submissive when the slave is abused by more than one dom. Especially when the slave is naked, while the doms are all fully clothed. 4. Ignore. A group of doms could have a &quot;night out&quot; using a slave as boot/foot rest or carpet. This is a sort of objectification play. Although not much pain is induced in this situation compared to trampling, the slave could be psychologically (and willingly) abused to a large extent.

<doc id="804000" wikidata="Q4580250" url="?curid=804000" title="1981â82 United States network television schedule">
<text>The following is the 1981â82 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1981 through August 1982. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1980â81 season. All times are Eastern and Pacific, with certain exceptions, such as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

New series are highlighted in bold.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.

&quot;Note&quot;: A Writers Guild of America strike hindered the ability to start airing shows in a timely manner. The shows in the schedule were the first to air new episodes in their respective time periods as they premiered between September and early December. The debut month for each new series that had been intended for a fall premiere is noted as to when it actually appeared.

&quot;PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, was in operation but the schedule was set by each local station.&quot;

== Sunday ==

Note : On NBC, &quot;The Powers of Matthew Star&quot; was supposed to have aired 7-8 p.m., starting December 6, but production difficulties forced its delay into the next season.

== Monday ==
== Tuesday ==
Note: On ABC, Joanie Loves Chachi premiered March 23, 1982, at 8:30 pm, in place of &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;. On CBS, Q.E.D. ran for 6 weeks at 8pm, from March 23 to April 27.

== Wednesday ==

NOTE: The only episode of the sitcom Cass Malloy aired on CBS from 8:30 to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on July 21, 1982. Although not picked up as a regular series, it served as the pilot for the 1987â1989 syndicated sitcom &quot;She&#x27;s the Sheriff&quot;.

== Thursday ==
Note: On CBS, &quot;Nurse&quot; aired at 9-10 p.m. and &quot;Knots Landing&quot; at 10-11 p.m., both in September and October. On ABC, &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; aired at 9-9:30Â p.m. in October.

== Friday ==
== Saturday ==
(*) Also known as &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;.

Note: On ABC, &quot;Maggie&quot; was replaced by &quot;Open All Night&quot;, effective November 28; &quot;King&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, which was supposed to have aired 8-9 p.m., was delayed until January, 1982, as an indirect result of the Writers Guild of America strike. On NBC, &quot;The Devlin Connection&quot; was supposed to have aired at 10:00 p.m., but Rock Hudson&#x27;s heart surgery forced the delay into next season.

<text>In sociology and in political science, the term &quot;the establishment&quot; describes the dominant social group, the elite who control a polity, an organization, or an institution. In the praxis of wealth and power, the Establishment usually is a self-selecting, closed elite entrenched within specific institutions â hence, a relatively small social class can exercise all socio-political control.

In 1955, the journalist Henry Fairlie popularized the contemporary usage of the term &quot;The Establishment&quot; to denote the network of socially prominent and politically important people:

Consequently, the term &quot;the Establishment&quot; became common usage in the press of London; The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites Fairlie&#x27;s column originating the British usages of the term &quot;the Establishment&quot;, as in the established church denoting the official Church of England. Moreover, in sociologic jargon, an outsider is the person who is not a member of The Establishment.

== Australia ==
The term &quot;establishment&quot; is often used in Australia to refer both to the main political parties and also to the powers behind those parties. In the book, &quot;Anti-political Establishment Parties: A Comparative Analysis&quot; by Amir Abedi (2004), Amir Abedi refers to the Labor Party and the Coalition Parties (the Liberal Party and the National/Country Party) as the establishment parties.

== Canada ==
The original Canadian Establishment began as a mix between the British and American models, combining political appointments and business acumen. In Francophone Canada, the local leaders of the Catholic Church played a major role. The Family Compact is the first identifiable Canadian Establishment in Anglophone Canada.

The journalist Peter C. Newman defined the modern Canadian Establishment in his 1975 book &quot;The Canadian Establishment&quot;. It catalogued the richest individuals and families living in Canada at the time. All of the specific people he identified were prominent business leaders, especially in the media and in public transit. Newman reports that several of these old families have maintained their importance into the twenty-first century.

== Hong Kong==
The term is also used in politics of Hong Kong, where political parties, community groups, chambers of commerce, trade unions and individuals who are cooperative with and loyal to the Chinese Communist Party and the post-handover Hong Kong Government are labelled (most often self-labelled) &quot;pro-Beijing&quot; or &quot;pro-establishment&quot;. The term first appeared in 2004.

==Ireland==
The term &quot;Official Ireland&quot; is commonly used in the Republic of Ireland to denote the media, cultural and religious establishment.

== Pakistan ==
In Pakistan, the term &quot;The Establishment&quot; refers to the military and their relations with the intelligence community and high-level political officials that allow them to exert dominance over the government.

==United Kingdom==
The United Kingdom has numerous entrenched groups that are regarded as forming the establishment: these include the royal family, the aristocracy, the landed gentry, prestigious public schools like Eton College and Harrow School, the privy council, senior civil servants, lawyers, academics, Church of England clergy, financiers, industrialists, the armed services and other professionals.

==United States==

In the United States, the term &quot;the establishment&quot; typically refers to the two-party political system, in which the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are perceived as alike in their support of neoliberalism, defined by anti-labor and pro-federal policy, as well as vehement defense of corporate interests. This use can also refer to the original coinage of the term &quot;the Establishment&quot; in 1955, referring to the intricate matrix of power and connections among corporations, politicians, government agencies, and some social groups. 

The power of the establishment has significantly increased in the wake of Donald Trump&#x27;s election as president in 2016, as well as political polarization further increasing in the United States. The term has largely fallen out of use in contemporary American politics, except as a pejorative.

The term also refers to White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs), who constitute much of the social elites that have dominated historical American society, culture, and politics, enjoying education, voting rights, and land ownership. In the 1950s, the New Left criticised WASP hegemony of American society. Some prominent American families have held disproportionate wealth and wielded disproportionate political power over the decades. Experts talk about what C. Wright Mills called the &quot;power elite&quot;, and about leadership communities in policy areas such as foreign policy.

Traditionally, WASP and Protestant establishment families have been associated with Episcopal (or Anglican), Presbyterian, United Methodist, Congregationalist, and other mainline Protestant denominations.

==History==

===Pre-Islamic===
According to the city government, the name is derived from &quot;Amardi&quot;, a tribe mentioned by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus.

Amol is one of the most ancient cities of Iran. A number of historians and geographers believe it was established in the 1st millennium BC. Some historians have attributed the birth of the city during the reign of the mythological king Tahmuras.

====Pishdadian and Amard====

Some historians have associated this ancient city with the periods of the Pishdadian dynasty and the Kayanian dynasty. The people inhabiting the area before the arrival of Aryans, were known as Amards (Amui in Pahlavi), who had migrated to and settled on the Iranian Plateau between the late 2nd millennium BC and early 1st millennium BC. According to historical literature, Amol was the capital of Mazandaran, at least in the period starting from Sassanid Empire to the Ilkhanate dynasty of Mongol Empire. Though they are a Median tribe, Herodotus named the tribe Mardians as one of the ten to fifteen Persian tribes in Persis. It is now known that the only distinction between the Median Amardians and the Persian Mardians is the &#x27;a&#x27; at the beginning of &quot;Amardians,&quot; which would mean they are two different tribes. Elsewhere he says, one of the peoples who have trusted Darius I

Igor M. Diakonoff says that Amardians lived on the coasts of the Caspian Sea, in the distance of the Alban and Otia from the north and the Hyrcanian from the east.

Strabo says about the Tapyri that they wore black robes and had long hair, and &quot;he who is adjudged the bravest marries whomever he wishes&quot; (&quot;Geography&quot; 11.8 = T520a). In the history of the Persian Empire, the Mard were handsome, capable and brave persons present in the heart of the army and were responsible for defending the commander.) The Amard helped Achaemenid in several battles including the invasion of Greece, the occupation of Sardis, the attack of Medes and at the Battle of Opis.
Ibn Isfandiyar has another theory about Amol which says, at the request of his wife, Firoz Shah created a large and flourishing city named Amele.

====Achaemenid Empire====
People of Amol were p, the current Caspian Sea. Further evidence of the power of the Amol people is their fighting in the Battle of Thermopylae, Battle of Gaugamela and other Sardis forces in the Achaemenid Empire. Quintus Curtius Rufus said, Immortals (Achaemenid Empire) Archers they were all Amard people.

====Parthian Empire====
During the reign of the Parthian Empire, Amol was one of the centers of Iran. It seems that Amol&#x27;s reputation in the time of Alexander the Great and the Parthian period dominated the political-administrative Satrap was Hyrcanian. During the Parthian period, Amol was also famous and prosperous, which was called &quot;Homo&quot; or &quot;Hamo&quot;. Parthian King Phraates I (171â173 AH) defeated the Mardas in the Amol region. He is said to have moved a group of people to the Parthian lands in northern Khorasan and settled in western Amu Darya, also known as Amol Zam.

====Sassanian====

According to historical literature, Amol was the capital of Mazandaran during the period starting from the 3rd century AD under the Sassanian Empire to the 13/14th century AD under the Ilkhanate dynasty of Mongol Empire. Before Islam, Amol was one of the largest and most important cities in the region and was considered the center of Mazandaran. The city of Amol existed before the Sassanids and during the Alexander period. During the Sassanid period, the importance of this Amol was increased due to the escape of the followers of Mazdak to this city.

During the Sassanid period, the city of Amol enjoyed development and was the center of the important province of Tabarestan. During this period, the city had infrastructures and elements such as government citadels, neighborhoods, fire temples, and bazaars and a fire temple in the area, called &quot;Avam Kuye&quot;.

Dabuyid dynasty and Bavand dynasty Iranian dynasty were the kings of the Sassanid dynasty; they lived in Amol, which was the city capital of these dynasties.

===Islam===
==== Abbasid, Alid, Ziyarid, Marashis ====
Amol, in the era of the Alid dynasties and Marashis dynasty, was the capital of Northern Iran. The inhabitants of Amol embraced Islam during the reign of Mahdi (775â785), the Abbasid Caliph. Amol was also the capital city of the Bavand dynasty and Ziyarid dynasty.
The people of Amol initially resisted the Arabs.
In the Abbasid Caliphate of the ninth century, Amol was one of the largest cities in Iran. Khalid ibn Barmak built a palace in the city and ruled for years. People from the Qarinvand dynasty arrived a couple of years ago and fought with the Abbasid Caliphate to win the kingdom.
During the Umayyad Caliphate period, during the reign of Muawiyah I, Sa&#x27;id ibn al-As undertook the conquest of Tabaristan, and with an army of 4,000 troops rushed there, and the whole war between him and Farrukhan the Great lasted for two whole years, but was postponed. The conflict lasted until Abbasid Caliphate until the attack of the Persian general Wandad Hurmuzd.

In Hudud al-&#x27;Alam, Amol is regarded as a great city with active commerce and trading ventures. However, resentment with the Tahirids rule increased due to the oppressive activities of their officials. People of the provinces pledged alliance to Hasan ibn Zayd. Zayd became the founder of the Zaydid dynasty of Tabaristan Alavids government in Tabaristan established and it&#x27;s with Amol centered and 106-year domination of the Abbasids in the territory ended.

After the Alid dynasty, the Ziyarid dynasty ruled Iran and Tabaristan. At this time Amol was developed in such a way that geographers have written articles about the industry and its silk.
Hasan ibn Zayd, nicknamed al-Dai al-Kabir, appeared in the Tabaristan region in 250 AH, and many dissatisfied people and the captives of the Caliph Tahirid strengthened him. He invited people and published the Shiite religion. After coming to power in Tabaristan, Daei Kabir moved his capital from Sari to Amol, which was Taherian&#x27;s seat.
In 260 A.D., Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar marched on Tabaristan and entered Amol after the departure of Hassan ibn Zayd, but his rule did not last long and the Alavids recaptured the city again. The Alawites ruled the city until Ziyarid and Buyid, who were the handmaidens of the Shiites. The people of Amol were very militant and stood up to the Arabs, but social injustice and class divisions led the people to convert to Islam.

Qabus was in 1012 overthrown by his own army and was succeeded by his son Manuchihr, who quickly recognized the sovereignty of Mahmud of Ghazni and married one of his daughters. Manuchihr died in 1031 and was succeeded by his son Anushirvan Sharaf al-Ma&#x27;ali, whom Mahmud of Ghazni had chosen as the heir of the Ziyarid dynasty. From 1032 to 1040, the real power behind the throne was held by Abu Kalijar ibn Vayhan, a relative of Anushirvan Sharaf al-Ma&#x27;ali. During this period, Amol was chosen as the capital of Iran until 1090. He also had the first seminary by Hasan al-Utrush built in Amol, which was later named Imam Hassan Askari Mosque.

<text>The Paraguay national football team (), nicknamed &quot;La Albirroja,&quot; represents Paraguay in men&#x27;s international football competitions, and are controlled by the Paraguayan Football Association (AsociaciÃ³n Paraguaya de FÃºtbol). Paraguay is a member of CONMEBOL. The Albirroja has qualified for eight FIFA World Cup competitions (1930, 1950, 1958, 1986, 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010), with their best performance coming in 2010 when they reached the quarter-finals. A regular participant at the Copa AmÃ©rica, Paraguay have been crowned champions of the competition on two occasions (in 1953 and 1979). Paraguay&#x27;s highest FIFA World Rankings was 8th (March 2001) and their lowest was 103 (May 1995). Paraguay was awarded second place with Best Move of the Year in 1996 for their rise in the FIFA Rankings.

The national team&#x27;s most successful period was under the coaching of Argentine Gerardo Martino, who was awarded with the South American Coach of the Year in 2007 and took Paraguay to the quarter-finals stage of the FIFA World Cup competition for the first time in history (in 2010) and also to the final of the 2011 Copa AmÃ©rica, where Paraguay finished as runners-up. In Paraguay&#x27;s entire history at the FIFA World Cup, only Carlos Gamarra and JosÃ© Luis Chilavert hold the distinction of being selected as part of the All-Star Team, being for the 1998 edition. Paulo da Silva holds the most appearances for the national team with 148 matches and Roque Santa Cruz is the all-time leading goal scorer with 32 goals. Denis Caniza, who was present with the national team from 1996 to 2010, is the only player to have represented Paraguay in four consecutive FIFA World Cup competitions (1998, 2002, 2006, 2010).

==History==
===The beginning (1900â1930)===

Soon after the introduction of football in Paraguay by Williams Paats, the Liga Paraguaya de Futbol (today AsociaciÃ³n Paraguaya de FÃºtbol) was created in 1906. The first national football team was organized in 1910 when an invitation by the Argentine club HÃ©rcules of Corrientes was received to play a friendly match. Members of that first national team where F. MeliÃ¡n, G. Almeida, A. RodrÃ­guez, M. Barrios, P. Samaniego, J. MorÃ­n, Z. Gadea, D. Andreani, C. Mena Porta, B. Villamayor, M. Rojas and E. Erico. The match ended in a 0â0 draw.

Because of the increasing number of invitations to play matches and international tournaments, the AsociaciÃ³n Paraguaya de FÃºtbol decided to officially create the national team and select the striped red and white jerseys that until this date remain as the official colours (taken from the Paraguayan flag). In late 1919, Paraguay accepted the invitation to play the 1921 Copa AmÃ©rica and in order to prepare for that occasion a number of friendly matches were played between 1919 and the start of the tournament in 1921. The first of those friendly matches was a 5â1 loss against Argentina, and it marked the first international game by the Paraguay national football team. When the 1921 Copa AmÃ©rica finally arrived, Paraguay surprised everybody by beating then three-time South American champions Uruguay by 2â1, being this the first match in an official competition for the Paraguayan football team. Paraguay eventually finished fourth in the tournament and became a regular participant of the tournament for the next editions.

In 1930, Paraguay participated in the first World Cup, organized by Uruguay. In the first round, Paraguay debuted and lost to the United States (0â3), to then defeat Belgium (1â0) with a goal by Luis Vargas PeÃ±a. Only one team was to advance from the group stage, and the U.S. left Paraguay behind.

===First taste of success (1930â1970)===

After strong participations in the Copa AmÃ©rica tournaments of 1929, 1947 and 1949 (where Paraguay finished in second place), Paraguay was ready for their next World Cup competition.

The return to the World Cup was in 1950, where Paraguay faced Sweden and Italy in Group 3. Paraguay failed to advance to the next round after a 2â2 draw against Sweden and a 2â0 loss against Italy.

The first big success came in 1953 when Paraguay won the Copa AmÃ©rica disputed in Peru. In their road to the championship, Paraguay defeated Chile (3â0), Bolivia (2â1) and Brazil (2â1); and tied against Ecuador (0â0), Peru (2â2) and Uruguay (2â2). Since Paraguay and Brazil were tied in points at the end of the tournament, a final playoff match was played between them, with Paraguay winning the final by 3â2. Key players of the campaign included Ãngel Berni, Heriberto Herrera and RubÃ©n FernÃ¡ndez. The coach was Manuel Fleitas Solich.

For the 1958 World Cup, Paraguay surprisingly qualified ahead of Uruguay (beating them 5â0 in the decisive game) with a team that contained a formidable attacking lineup with stars such as Juan Bautista AgÃ¼ero, JosÃ© Parodi, Jorge Lino Romero, Cayetano RÃ© and Florencio Amarilla. In their first game in Sweden, Paraguay were 3â2 up against France in a game they lost 7â3. A 3â2 win over Scotland and a 3â3 draw with Yugoslavia saw Paraguay finish third in their group.

The departure of several of their stars for European football (mainly Spain) resulted in a weakening of Paraguay&#x27;s football fortunes somewhat, but they were only edged out by Mexico in the 1962 qualifiers.

===More continental success (1970â1990)===
Paraguay fell short in subsequent World Cup qualifying campaigns, but Copa AmÃ©rica success (and that of one of its premier clubs Olimpia in the Copa Libertadores) in 1979 shored up Paraguay as a solid player on the continent.

The 1979 Copa AmÃ©rica was won by Paraguay after finishing first in Group C (which had Uruguay and Ecuador as well) with two wins and two draws. In the semi-finals, Paraguay defeated Brazil by an aggregate score of 4â3. In the finals, Paraguay defeated Chile by an aggregate score of 3â1 to claim its second continental crown. Players such as Romerito, Carlos Alberto Kiese, Alicio Solalinde, Roberto Paredes, Hugo Ricardo Talavera and Eugenio Morel where an important part of the team, coached by Ranulfo Miranda.

Paraguay ended a 28-year absence from the World Cup in 1986 with a team starring Roberto FernÃ¡ndez in goal; Cesar Zabala, Rogelio Delgado and Juan Bautista Torales in defence; Jorge Amado Nunes and Vladimiro Schettina in midfield; midfield playmaker Romerito and strikers Roberto CabaÃ±as, RamÃ³n Ãngel MarÃ­a Hicks and Rolando Chilavert (the older brother of JosÃ© Luis Chilavert). In first round matches, Paraguay defeated Iraq (1â0, goal scored by Romerito) and then tied Mexico (1â1, goal scored by Romerito) and Belgium (2â2, both goals scored by Roberto CabaÃ±as). They reached the second round where they were beaten 3â0 by England.

===The golden generation (1998â2011)===
A drought followed once again, as Paraguay failed to reach the 1990 and 1994 World Cups.

In 1992, Paraguay won the South American Pre-Olympic tournament, which guaranteed a spot in the 1992 Summer Olympics football competition. In the Olympics, Paraguay finished second in its group and were eliminated by Ghana in the quarter-finals. The most important aspect of that Paraguay team was the emergence of new young players like Carlos Gamarra, Celso Ayala, JosÃ© Luis Chilavert, Francisco Arce and JosÃ© Cardozo, which became part of the &quot;golden generation&quot; that led Paraguay to three straight World Cups and good performances in continental competitions, establishing Paraguay as one of the top teams in South America alongside Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.

====1998 FIFA World Cup====

Paraguay concluded the qualifiers for the 1998 World Cup in second position, one point below Argentina.

Coached by the Brazilian Paulo CÃ©sar Carpegiani, the &quot;Albirroja&quot; returned to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986. The squad featured experienced players. Paraguay were drawn into Group D, alongside Bulgaria, Nigeria and Spain.

Paraguay drew their first two matches 0â0, against Bulgaria and Spain. They then faced to face Nigeria, who has already qualified for the second round after winning their first two matches. Paraguay won 3â1 and finished in second position in the group.

Paraguay met France in the second round on 28 June. France were without Zinedine Zidane, and were held 0â0 by Paraguay for 90 minutes. In the 114th minute of extra-time, Laurent Blanc scored to eliminate Paraguay on the golden goal rule. Defender Carlos Gamarra and goalkeeper and captain JosÃ© LuÃ­s Chilavert were selected as part of the 1998 All-Star Team.

====1999 and 2001 Copa AmÃ©rica====
Paraguay were hosts of the 1999 Copa AmÃ©rica, played in four cities throughout the country. Head coach Ever Hugo Almeida selected an experienced squad, with the majority of the players having been present at the 1998 World Cup. Grouped with Bolivia, Japan and Peru, the Albirroja played their first match of the competition, drawing 0â0 against Bolivia. On 2 July, Paraguay faced Japan and sealed a 4â0 victory.

In their opening fixture on 12 July, the fixture ended 3â3. On 15 July, Paraguay drew 0â0 with Mexico in their second group stage fixture. Paraguay then faced Brazil on 18 July in their last group stage fixture. Brazil won 3â1 and eliminated Paraguay, who had obtained just two points at the competition.

Paraguay came into the 2002 FIFA World Cup tournament with most of their players from France 98, as JosÃ© LuÃ­s Chilavert would captain the Albirroja at the tournament. Cesare Maldini&#x27;s appointing as coach in January 2002 had caused controversy as domestic managers were overlooked (prompting the managers union to try to unsuccessfully expel him for immigration breaches).

Paraguay were drawn into Group B with Spain, South Africa and Slovenia. The Albirroja would face South Africa in their opening group stage match on 2 June, with a match that tied at 2â2. Paraguay faced Spain in their next fixture on 7 June. Spain defeated Paraguay 3â1. In Paraguay&#x27;s third group stage fixture against Slovenia, Paraguay won the match at 3â1.

Paraguay were then drawn against Germany at the round of 16 stages. Germany, who had been the more dominant side throughout the match, scored in the 88th minute to win the match, ending Paraguay&#x27;s tournament.

====2004 Copa AmÃ©rica====
Coach Carlos Jara Saguier took a relatively young squad to the 2004 Copa AmÃ©rica, with the majority of players tied to clubs of the Primera DivisiÃ³n Paraguaya. Paraguay had been drawn into Group C, with Brazil, Costa Rica and Chile. A penalty sealed Paraguay&#x27;s 1â0 victory in their first group-stage match against Costa Rica.

England managed to hold onto a 1â0 lead to earn a victory. They faced Sweden on 15 June in a match which Sweden eliminated Paraguay after just two group-stage matches without the Albirroja scoring a single goal. Paraguay&#x27;s only compensation came in their third and last group stage fixture on against Trinidad and Tobago on 20 June, Paraguay&#x27;s 2â0 victory. Paraguay finished third in their group.

===Copa AmÃ©rica Centenario===
Prior to the competition, the Paraguayan press had labeled Roque Santa Cruz, Nelson Haedo, Paulo da Silva and Justo Villar as histÃ³rics, being the only four experienced and veteran players in the squad selected for the competition. Santa Cruz suffered an injured and was later replaced by Antonio Sanabria.

Following an unsuccessful campaign, RamÃ³n DÃ­az announced his resignation as coach of the Albirroja in a press conference at the Estadio Defensores del Chaco after returning to the country. He had already received criticism from former Albirroja great JosÃ© LuÃ­s Chilavert, who stated that the team was managed based on &quot;friendship&quot; in the federation due to corruption and opined that DÃ­az is more of an office person. JosÃ© Cardozo, former Albirroja leading goal scorer and current coach of Chiapas in Mexico, also expressed his dissatisfaction with the Albirroja. He stated that: &quot;There are players that do not even know our national anthem&quot; and &quot;We used to play until we would suffer severe injuries, and we performed because we loved the Albirroja. Today, someone has pain in their stomach and does not want to train.&quot; &quot;Carlos Gamarra and Francisco Arce played many times with busted ankles, and I once played with a damaged knee&quot; remembered Cardozo. Former Albirroja World Cup veteran Celso Ayala spoke to HOY.com and mentioned that &quot;Any team beats us. In the Albirroja, we&#x27;ve stopped kicking, blocking and heading. Uruguay, for instance, never forgets about its roots, and we have to be like them.&quot;

<text>The Student Union at the Royal Institute of Technology (&quot;Tekniska HÃ¶gskolans StudentkÃ¥r&quot; or THS) is the students&#x27; union at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. It is affiliated with the Stockholm Federation of Student Unions.

The student union was founded on 26 November 1901. The union building &quot;Nymble&quot; was designed by leading Swedish modernists Uno ÃhrÃ©n and Sven Markelius in 1928 and inaugurated in 1930; it is significant as one of the first examples of modernist architecture in Sweden and has status as a listed building.

The student union has a governing chamber of delegates elected by the students at the Institute and a board and other officials elected by the delegates. The union appoints student representatives to various boards of the Institute.

The members of THS are divided into chapters or &quot;sections&quot; of the union. Each chapter corresponds to a number of programs (bachelor, master or doctoral) at the Royal Institute of Technology. Each chapter has its own management and arranges a reception for new students. The chapters or sections of THS are:

<text>A monster truck is a specialized off-road vehicle with a heavy duty suspension, four-wheel steering, large-displacement V8 engines and oversized tires constructed for competition and entertainment uses. Originally created by modifying stock pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs), they have evolved into purpose-built vehicles with tube-frame chassis and fiberglass bodies rather than metal. A competition monster truck is typically tall, and equipped with off-road tires.

Monster trucks developed in the late 1970s and came into the public eye in the early 1980s as side acts at popular motocross, tractor pulling, and mud bogging events, where they were used in car-crushing demonstrations. Today they are usually the main attraction with motocross, mud bogging, ATV racing, or demolition derbies as supporting events.

==Events==

Monster truck shows typically have two main segments: a race and a freestyle stunt driving competition, with an intermission at the midway point of the event. 

Races are conducted as a single-elimination tournament on short, symmetrical tracks, which may include obstacles such as junk cars or dirt mounds. The length and complexity of the track can vary with the size of the venue, with courses in indoor arenas typically being shorter with fewer obstacles. This has drawn comparisons to professional drag racing, and depending on the promoter or size of the event, may even make use of a christmas tree starting procedure. 

In freestyle events, each driver puts on a performance consisting of stunts such as obstacle jumps, backflips, wheelies, and doughnuts. A panel of judges assign points to each performance and the driver with the most points is declared the winner, though the exact scoring format can change from promoter to promoter. 

Historically, additional vehicles for the drivers to crush, such as motor homes and school buses, were placed on the track specifically for the freestyle event, however incidents of debris flying into the stands and causing serious injuries have influenced most event promoters to turn away from such obstacles. Most freestyle courses now consist mostly of large mounds and ramps erected to allow the trucks to perform large jumps and wheelies upon landing. Freestyle performances have a set time limit and only one truck is allowed on the track at a time as a safety measure. Freestyle events are typically the final competition of a show, as damage to the trucks would make them unable to race.

==History==

In the late 1970s, heavily modified pickup trucks were becoming popular and the sports of mud bogging and truck pulling were gaining in popularity. Several truck owners had created lifted trucks to compete in such events, and soon competition to hold the title of &quot;biggest truck&quot; developed. The trucks which garnered the most national attention were Bob Chandler&#x27;s Bigfoot, Everett Jasmer&#x27;s USA-1, Fred Shafer and Jack Willman Sr.&#x27;s Bear Foot, and Jeff Dane&#x27;s King Kong. At the time, the largest tires the trucks were running were in diameter.

In April 1981, Bob Chandler drove over junked cars in Bigfoot in what is often believed to be the first monster truck to crush cars. Chandler drove Bigfoot over a pair of cars in a field as a test of the truck&#x27;s ability, and filmed it to use as a promotional tool in his four-wheel drive performance shop. An event promoter saw the video of the car crush and asked Chandler to do it in front of a crowd. Initially hesitant because of the &quot;destructive&quot; image that could be associated with Bigfoot, Chandler eventually agreed. After some smaller shows, Chandler performed the feat in the Pontiac Silverdome in 1982. At this show, Chandler also debuted a new version of Bigfoot with tires. At a prior event in the early 1980s, when Bigfoot was still running tires, Bob George, one of the owners of a motorsport promotion company named Truck-a-rama â later known as the United States Hot Rod Association (USHRA) â is said to have coined the phrase &quot;monster truck&quot; when referring to Bigfoot. The term &quot;monster truck&quot; became the generic name for all trucks with oversized tires.

King Kong and Bear Foot each followed Bigfoot to tires, and soon other monster trucks, such as King Krunch, Maddog, and Virginia Giant were being constructed. These early trucks were built on stock chassis which were heavily reinforced, used leaf spring suspension, a stock body, and heavy axles from military-specification vehicles to support the tires.

For most of the early 1980s, monster trucks performed primarily exhibitions as a side show to truck pulling or mud bogging events. In August 1983, Bigfoot and USA-1 competed in the first side-by-side monster truck race, which was filmed for the television show &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible&quot;. By 1985 major promoters, such as the USHRA and TNT Motorsports, were racing monster trucks regularly. In 1988, TNT Motorsports created a series to establish the first national championship of monster truck racing; USA-1 and rookie driver Rod Litzau edged out Bigfoot, driven by Rich Hoosier, for the title.

In 1988, to standardize rules for truck construction and safety, Bob Chandler, Braden, and George Carpenter formed the Monster Truck Racing Association (MTRA). The MTRA created standard safety rules to govern monster trucks. The organization still plays a major role in the sport&#x27;s development in the US and EU.

With racing taking precedence, several teams began to think in new ways as to how the trucks could be built. Towards the end of 1988, Gary Cook and David Morris debuted Equalizer, a truck with a combination of coil springs and shock absorbers as the main source of suspension rather than the standard of leaf springs and shock absorbers. In 1989, Jack Willman Sr., now with his own truck, Taurus, debuted a new truck which used a solid axle suspension system made of parallel four-link suspensions and coilovers that together weighed in at close to . However, the biggest innovation came from Chandler, also in 1989, when the CAD-designed Bigfoot #8 debuted featuring a full tubular chassis and a long-travel suspension system made of triangulated four-link suspensions, bump stops, limit straps, cantilevers, and shock absorbers charged with nitrogen gas. The truck revolutionized how monster trucks were built, and within a few years most top-level teams built similar vehicles.

In 1991, TNT was purchased by the USHRA and their points series were merged. The Special Events championship began to grow in popularity with teams as it had open qualifying spots which the invite-only USHRA championship did not have. The Special Events series lost its Pendaliner sponsorship in 1997. The short-lived ProMT series started in 2000.

Even though racing was dominant as a competition, USHRA events began having freestyle exhibitions as early as 1993. These exhibitions were developed as drivers, notably Dennis Anderson of the extremely popular Grave Digger, began asking for time to come out and perform if they lost in early rounds of racing. Promoters began to notice the popularity of freestyle among fans, and in 2000 the USHRA began holding freestyle as a judged competition at events, and now awards a freestyle championship.

==Promoters==
The USHRA&#x27;s Monster Jam series, now owned by Feld Entertainment, is currently the largest, touring through the United States, Canada and select regions of Europe. Other promoters of monster truck events include the Toughest Monster Truck Tour, the Monster X Tour, and Hot Wheels Monster Trucks Live.

==Truck construction==

The first monster trucks built were pickup trucks and SUVs that were modified with larger suspension and larger tires. Today, trucks now have custom built tubular chassis, with four-link suspension to provide up to of clearance, and they also now have fiberglass bodies that attach to the chassis separately and are designed to be easily removed and easily replaced when damaged. The use of fiberglass panel bodies has allowed monster truck owners to develop a wide variety of thematic concept trucks that scarcely resemble the modified stock trucks that became early monster trucks.

Engines are now typically mounted behind the driver on most trucks and are typically supercharged, run on a methanol-based fuel, and have displacement of up to . Axles are mostly taken from either heavy-duty military trucks or road vehicles such as school buses, and are modified to have a planetary gear reduction at the hub to help turn the tires. All trucks have hydraulic steering in both the front and the rear (four wheel steering), with the front wheels controlled by the steering wheel and the rear wheels by a toggle switch.

The tires are typically &quot;terra&quot; tires used on farm equipment, and are of size in diameter, in width, and fit on diameter rims.

Most trucks use a modified or custom-designed automatic transmission, such as a Turbo 400, Powerglide, Ford C6 transmission, or a TorqueFlite 727. A limited number of trucks utilize a Lenco transmission, which traces its roots to drag racing. Most of the automatic transmissions are heavily modified with transbrakes, manual valve bodies, and heavy duty gear sets. Trucks running a Lenco use a centrifugal clutch as opposed to a torque converter, which are used in automatic transmissions. Lenco transmissions are usually found in two-speed or three speed configurations, and are commonly shifted using compressed carbon dioxide.

The trucks have many safety features, several of which are required just to run in the indoor arenas that the trucks frequent. Trucks are equipped with three shut-off switches: a remote ignition interrupt (RII), which allows event stewards to stop a truck remotely, a switch within the driver&#x27;s reach in the cab, and another at the rear of the truck so that all electrical power may be shut off in the event of a rollover.

Many trucks are constructed with the driver sitting in the center of the cab for visibility. Most cabs are shielded with Lexan or comparable polycarbonate, which not only protects the driver from track debris, but also allows for increased visibility. Drivers are required to wear firesuits, safety harnesses, helmets, and head and neck restraints. Most moving parts on the truck are also shielded, and high pressure components have restraining straps, both in case of an explosion.

== Accidents ==
Below is a list of accidents resulting in fatalities.

On January 16, 2009, at a Monster Jam event in Tacoma, Washington, six-year-old Sebastian Hizey was fatally injured when he was struck by flying debris from the truck Natural High. Hizey succumbed to his injuries the next morning.

On January 25, 2009, the monster truck Samson was involved in an accident in Madison, Wisconsin that caused the death of announcer George Eisenhart, Jr. after he accidentally stepped in front of Samson while it was moving.

On October 6, 2013, the monster truck Big Show plowed into a crowd of spectators in Chihuahua City, Mexico, killing eight people and injuring 79 others in the Chihuahua monster truck accident. This is the deadliest monster truck incident in the history of the sport.

On September 28, 2014, a monster truck plowed into a crowd of spectators in the Haaksbergen monster truck accident, killing three people.

<text>Body worship is the practice of physically revering a part of another person&#x27;s body, and is usually done as a submissive act in the context of BDSM. It is often an expression of erotic fetishism but it can also be used as part of service-oriented submission or sexual roleplay. It typically involves kissing, licking or sucking parts of a dominant&#x27;s body such as the vulva, the penis, the buttocks, the feet, the breasts or the muscles. Body worship was included in the introductory classes on BDSM introduced in 2003 by the Society of Janus, the largest BDSM educational organisation in San Francisco.

Dominatrices sometimes use body worship as part of dominance and submission. This may involve a submissive stroking, massaging or bathing the dominatrix or kissing and licking her buttocks. In addition, the submissive may be required to perform cunnilingus (sometimes called &quot;full-body worship&quot;) or anilingus on her. These activities may take place during facesitting (sometimes called &quot;queening&quot;), in which the dominatrix sits on the submissive&#x27;s face. A muscle worship fetish may be catered for by a dominatrix who is also a bodybuilder.

<text>A caliphate ( ) is an institution or public office under the leadership of an Islamic steward with the title of caliph (; , ), a person considered a politicalâreligious successor to the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a leader of the entire Muslim world (&quot;ummah&quot;). Historically, the caliphates were polities based on Islam which developed into multi-ethnic trans-national empires.

During the medieval period, three major caliphates succeeded each other: the Rashidun Caliphate (632â661), the Umayyad Caliphate (661â750), and the Abbasid Caliphate (750â1517). In the fourth major caliphate, the Ottoman Caliphate, the rulers of the Ottoman Empire claimed caliphal authority from 1517 until the Ottoman caliphate was formally abolished as part of the 1924 secularisation of Turkey. An attempt to preserve the title was tried, with the Sharifian Caliphate, but this caliphate fell quickly after its conquest by the Sultanate of Nejd (present-day Saudi Arabia), leaving the claim in dormancy. Throughout the history of Islam, a few other Muslim states, almost all of which were hereditary monarchies, have claimed to be caliphates.

Not all Muslim states have had caliphates. The Sunni branch of Islam stipulates that, as a head of state, a caliph should be elected by Muslims or their representatives. Shia Muslims, however, believe a caliph should be an imam chosen by God from the Ahl al-Bayt (the &quot;Household of the Prophet&quot;). Some caliphates in history have been led by Shia Muslims, like the Fatimid Caliphate (909â1171). From the late 20th century towards the early 21st century, in the wake of the invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR, the war on terror and the Arab Spring, various Islamist groups have claimed the caliphate, although these claims have usually been widely rejected among Muslims.

== Etymology ==
Before the advent of Islam, Arabian monarchs traditionally used the title &#x27;king&#x27;, or another from the same Semitic root. The term &quot;caliph&quot; () derives from the Arabic word (, ), meaning &#x27;successor&#x27;, &#x27;steward&#x27;, or &#x27;deputy&#x27;âand has traditionally been considered a shortening of &#x27;successor of the messenger of God&#x27;. However, studies of pre-Islamic texts suggest that the original meaning of the phrase was &#x27;successor selected by God&#x27;.

== Rashidun Caliphate (632â661) ==
=== Succession to Muhammad ===
In the immediate aftermath of the death of Muhammad, a gathering of the Ansar (natives of Medina) took place in the &quot;saqifa&quot; (courtyard) of the Banu Sa&#x27;ida clan. The general belief at the time was that the purpose of the meeting was for the Ansar to decide on a new leader of the Muslim community among themselves, with the intentional exclusion of the Muhajirun (migrants from Mecca), though this has later become the subject of debate.

Nevertheless, Abu Bakr and Umar, both prominent companions of Muhammad, upon learning of the meeting became concerned of a potential coup and hastened to the gathering. Upon arriving, Abu Bakr addressed the assembled men with a warning that an attempt to elect a leader outside of Muhammad&#x27;s own tribe, the Quraysh, would likely result in dissension as only they can command the necessary respect among the community. He then took Umar and another companion, Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah, by the hand and offered them to the Ansar as potential choices. He was countered with the suggestion that the Quraysh and the Ansar choose a leader each from among themselves, who would then rule jointly. The group grew heated upon hearing this proposal and began to argue among themselves. Umar hastily took Abu Bakr&#x27;s hand and swore his own allegiance to the latter, an example followed by the gathered men.

Abu Bakr was near-universally accepted as head of the Muslim community (under the title of caliph) as a result of &quot;Saqifah&quot;, though he did face contention as a result of the rushed nature of the event. Several companions, most prominent among them being Ali ibn Abi Talib, initially refused to acknowledge his authority. Ali may have been reasonably expected to assume leadership, being both cousin and son-in-law to Muhammad. The theologian Ibrahim al-Nakha&#x27;i stated that Ali also had support among the Ansar for his succession, explained by the genealogical links he shared with them. Whether his candidacy for the succession was raised during Saqifah is unknown, though it is not unlikely. Abu Bakr later sent Umar to confront Ali to gain his allegiance, resulting in an altercation which may have involved violence. However, after six months, the group made peace with Abu Bakr and Ali offered him his fealty.

=== Rashidun caliphs ===
Abu Bakr nominated Umar as his successor on his deathbed. Umar, the second caliph, was killed by a Persian slave called Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a Firuz. His successor, Uthman, was elected by a council of electors (majlis). Uthman was killed by members of a disaffected group. Ali then took control but was not universally accepted as caliph by the governors of Egypt and later by some of his own guard. He faced two major rebellions and was assassinated by Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam, a Khawarij. Ali&#x27;s tumultuous rule lasted only five years. This period is known as the Fitna, or the first Islamic civil war. The followers of Ali later became the Shi&#x27;a (&quot;shiaat Ali&quot;, partisans of Ali.) minority sect of Islam and reject the legitimacy of the first three caliphs. The followers of all four RÄshidun Caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali) became the majority Sunni sect.
Under the RÄshidun, each region (Sultanate, Wilayah, or Emirate) of the caliphate had its own governor (Sultan, WÄli or Emir). MuÄwiyah, a relative of Uthman and governor (&quot;wali&quot;) of Syria, succeeded Ali as caliph. MuÄwiyah transformed the caliphate into a hereditary office, thus founding the Umayyad dynasty.

In areas which were previously under Sasanian Empire or Byzantine rule, the caliphs lowered taxes, provided greater local autonomy (to their delegated governors), greater religious freedom for Jews and some indigenous Christians, and brought peace to peoples demoralised and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the decades of ByzantineâPersian warfare.

=== Ali&#x27;s caliphate, Hasan and the rise of the Umayyads ===
Ali&#x27;s reign was plagued by turmoil and internal strife. The Persians, taking advantage of this, infiltrated the two armies and attacked the other army causing chaos and internal hatred between the companions at the Battle of Siffin. The battle lasted several months, resulting in a stalemate. To avoid further bloodshed, Ali agreed to negotiate with Mu&#x27;awiyah. This caused a faction of approximately 4,000 people, who would come to be known as the Kharijites, to abandon the fight. After defeating the Kharijites at the Battle of Nahrawan, Ali was later assassinated by the Kharijite Ibn Muljam. Ali&#x27;s son Hasan was elected as the next caliph, but abdicated in favour of Mu&#x27;awiyah a few months later to avoid any conflict within the Muslims. Mu&#x27;awiyah became the sixth caliph, establishing the Umayyad dynasty, named after the great-grandfather of Uthman and Mu&#x27;awiyah, Umayya ibn Abd Shams.

== Umayyad Caliphate (661â750) ==
Beginning with the Umayyads, the title of the caliph became hereditary. Under the Umayyads, the caliphate grew rapidly in territory, incorporating the Caucasus, Transoxiana, Sindh, the Maghreb and most of the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus) into the Muslim world. At its greatest extent, the Umayyad Caliphate covered 5.17Â million square miles (13,400,000Â km2), making it the largest empire the world had yet seen and the seventh largest ever to exist in history.

Geographically, the empire was divided into several provinces, the borders of which changed numerous times during the Umayyad reign. Each province had a governor appointed by the caliph. However, for a variety of reasons, including that they were not elected by Shura and suggestions of impious behaviour, the Umayyad dynasty was not universally supported within the Muslim community. Some supported prominent early Muslims like Zubayr ibn al-Awwam; others felt that only members of Muhammad&#x27;s clan, the Banu Hashim, or his own lineage, the descendants of Ali, should rule.

There were numerous rebellions against the Umayyads, as well as splits within the Umayyad ranks (notably, the rivalry between Yaman and Qays). At the command of Yazid son of Muawiya, an army led by Umar ibn Saad, a commander by the name of Shimr Ibn Thil-Jawshan killed Ali&#x27;s son Hussein and his family at the Battle of Karbala in 680, solidifying the Shia-Sunni split. Eventually, supporters of the Banu Hashim and the supporters of the lineage of Ali united to bring down the Umayyads in 750. However, the &quot;Shiâat âAlÄ«&quot;, &quot;the Party of Ali&quot;, were again disappointed when the Abbasid dynasty took power, as the Abbasids were descended from Muhammad&#x27;s uncle, âAbbas ibn âAbd al-Muttalib and not from Ali.

== Abbasid Caliphate (750â1517) ==
=== Abbasid caliphs at Baghdad ===

In 750, the Umayyad dynasty was overthrown by another family of Meccan origin, the Abbasids. Their time represented a scientific, cultural and religious flowering. Islamic art and music also flourished significantly during their reign. Their major city and capital Baghdad began to flourish as a center of knowledge, culture and trade. This period of cultural fruition ended in 1258 with the sack of Baghdad by the Mongols under Hulagu Khan. The Abbasid Caliphate had, however, lost its effective power outside Iraq already by c. 920. By 945, the loss of power became official when the Buyids conquered Baghdad and all of Iraq. The empire fell apart and its parts were ruled for the next century by local dynasties.

In the ninth century, the Abbasids created an army loyal only to their caliphate, composed predominantly of Turkic Cuman, Circassian and Georgian slave origin known as Mamluks. By 1250 the Mamluks came to power in Egypt. The Mamluk army, though often viewed negatively, both helped and hurt the caliphate. Early on, it provided the government with a stable force to address domestic and foreign problems. However, creation of this foreign army and al-Mu&#x27;tasim&#x27;s transfer of the capital from Baghdad to Samarra created a division between the caliphate and the peoples they claimed to rule. In addition, the power of the Mamluks steadily grew until Ar-Radi (934â941) was constrained to hand over most of the royal functions to Muhammad ibn Ra&#x27;iq.

=== Under the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo (1261â1517) ===

In 1261, following the Mongol conquest of Baghdad, the Mamluk rulers of Egypt tried to gain legitimacy for their rule by declaring the re-establishment of the Abbasid caliphate in Cairo. The Abbasid caliphs in Egypt had no political power; they continued to maintain the symbols of authority, but their sway was confined to religious matters. The first Abbasid caliph of Cairo was Al-Mustansir (r. JuneâNovember 1261). The Abbasid caliphate of Cairo lasted until the time of Al-Mutawakkil III, who ruled as caliph from 1508 to 1516, then he was deposed briefly in 1516 by his predecessor Al-Mustamsik, but was restored again to the caliphate in 1517.

The Ottoman sultan Selim I defeated the Mamluk Sultanate and made Egypt part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Al-Mutawakkil III was captured together with his family and transported to Constantinople as a prisoner where he had a ceremonial role. He died in 1543, following his return to Cairo.

==== Parallel regional caliphates in the later Abbasid era ====
The Abbasid dynasty lost effective power over much of the Muslim realm by the first half of the tenth century.

The Umayyad dynasty, which had survived and come to rule over Al-Andalus, reclaimed the title of caliph in 929, lasting until it was overthrown in 1031.

==== Umayyad Caliphate of CÃ³rdoba (929â1031) ====
During the Umayyad dynasty, the Iberian Peninsula was an integral province of the Umayyad Caliphate ruling from Damascus. The Umayyads lost the position of caliph in Damascus in 750, and Abd al-Rahman I became Emir of CÃ³rdoba in 756 after six years in exile. Intent on regaining power, he defeated the existing Islamic rulers of the area who defied Umayyad rule and united various local fiefdoms into an emirate.

Rulers of the emirate used the title &quot;emir&quot; or &quot;sultan&quot; until the tenth century, when Abd al-Rahman III was faced with the threat of invasion by the Fatimid Caliphate. To aid his fight against the invading Fatimids, who claimed the caliphate in opposition to the generally recognised Abbasid caliph of Baghdad, Al-Mu&#x27;tadid, Abd al-Rahman III claimed the title of caliph himself. This helped Abd al-Rahman III gain prestige with his subjects, and the title was retained after the Fatimids were repulsed. The rule of the caliphate is considered as the heyday of Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula, before it fragmented into various taifas in the eleventh century. This period was characterised by a flourishing in technology, trade and culture; many of the buildings of al-Andalus were constructed in this period.

==== Almohad Caliphate (1147â1269) ====
The Almohad Caliphate (, from &quot;&quot;, &quot;the Monotheists&quot; or &quot;the Unifiers&quot;) was a Moroccan Berber Muslim movement founded in the 12th century.

The Almohad movement was started by Ibn Tumart among the Masmuda tribes of southern Morocco. The Almohads first established a Berber state in Tinmel in the Atlas Mountains in roughly 1120. The Almohads succeeded in overthrowing the Almoravid dynasty in governing Morocco by 1147, when Abd al-Mu&#x27;min (r. 1130â1163) conquered Marrakech and declared himself caliph. They then extended their power over all of the Maghreb by 1159. Al-Andalus followed the fate of Africa, and all Islamic Iberia was under Almohad rule by 1172.

The Almohad dominance of Iberia continued until 1212, when Muhammad al-Nasir (1199â1214) was defeated at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in the Sierra Morena by an alliance of the Christian princes of Castile, Aragon, Navarre and Portugal. Nearly all of the Moorish dominions in Iberia were lost soon after, with the great Moorish cities of CÃ³rdoba and Seville falling to the Christians in 1236 and 1248, respectively.

The Almohads continued to rule in northern Africa until the piecemeal loss of territory through the revolt of tribes and districts enabled the rise of their most effective enemies, the Marinid dynasty, in 1215. The last representative of the line, Idris al-Wathiq, was reduced to the possession of Marrakesh, where he was murdered by a slave in 1269; the Marinids seized Marrakesh, ending the Almohad domination of the Western Maghreb.

== Fatimid Caliphate (909â1171) ==

The Fatimid Caliphate was an Isma&#x27;ili Shi&#x27;i caliphate, originally based in Tunisia, that extended its rule across the Mediterranean coast of Africa and ultimately made Egypt the centre of its caliphate. At its height, in addition to Egypt, the caliphate included varying areas of the Maghreb, Sicily, the Levant and the Hejaz.

The Fatimids established the Tunisian city of Mahdia and made it their capital city, before conquering Egypt and building the city of Cairo there in 969. Thereafter, Cairo became the capital of the caliphate, with Egypt becoming the political, cultural and religious centre of the state. Islam scholar Louis Massignon dubbed the fourth century AH /tenth century CE as the &quot;Ismaili century in the history of Islam&quot;.

The term &quot;Fatimite&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the citizens of this caliphate. The ruling elite of the state belonged to the Ismaili branch of Shi&#x27;ism. The leaders of the dynasty were Ismaili imams and had a religious significance to Ismaili Muslims. They are also part of the chain of holders of the office of the caliphate, as recognised by some Muslims. Therefore, this constitutes a rare period in history in which the descendants of Ali (hence the name Fatimid, referring to Ali&#x27;s wife Fatima) and the caliphate were united to any degree, excepting the final period of the Rashidun Caliphate under Ali himself.

The caliphate was reputed to exercise a degree of religious tolerance towards non-Ismaili sects of Islam as well as towards Jews, Maltese Christians and Copts.

The ShiÊ»a Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah of the Fatimid dynasty, who claimed descent from Muhammad through his daughter, claimed the title of caliph in 909, creating a separate line of caliphs in North Africa. Initially controlling Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, the Fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years, taking Egypt and Palestine, before the Abbasid dynasty was able to turn the tide, limiting Fatimid rule to Egypt. The Fatimid dynasty finally ended in 1171 and was overtaken by Saladin of the Ayyubid dynasty.

== Ottoman Caliphate (1517â1924) ==

The caliphate was claimed by the sultans of the Ottoman Empire beginning with Murad I (reigned 1362 to 1389), while recognising no authority on the part of the Abbasid caliphs of the Mamluk-ruled Cairo. Hence the seat of the caliphate moved to the Ottoman capital of Edirne. In 1453, after Mehmed the Conqueror&#x27;s conquest of Constantinople, the seat of the Ottomans moved to Constantinople, present-day Istanbul. In 1517, the Ottoman sultan Selim I defeated and annexed the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo into his empire. Through conquering and unifying Muslim lands, Selim I became the defender of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, which further strengthened the Ottoman claim to the caliphate in the Muslim world. Ottomans gradually came to be viewed as the &quot;de facto&quot; leaders and representatives of the Islamic world. However, the earlier Ottoman caliphs did not officially bear the title of caliph in their documents of state, inscriptions, or coinage. It was only in the late eighteenth century that the claim to the caliphate was discovered by the sultans to have a practical use, since it allowed them to counter Russian claims to protect Ottoman Christians with their own claim to protect Muslims under Russian rule.

The outcome of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768â1774 was disastrous for the Ottomans. Large territories, including those with large Muslim populations, such as Crimea, were lost to the Russian Empire. However, the Ottomans under Abdul Hamid I claimed a diplomatic victory by being allowed to remain the religious leaders of Muslims in the now-independent Crimea as part of the peace treaty; in return Russia became the official protector of Christians in Ottoman territory. According to Barthold, the first time the title of &quot;caliph&quot; was used as a political instead of symbolic religious title by the Ottomans was the Treaty of KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k Kaynarca with the Russian Empire in 1774, when the Empire retained moral authority on territory whose sovereignty was ceded to the Russian Empire. The British would tactfully affirm the Ottoman claim to the caliphate and proceed to have the Ottoman caliph issue orders to the Muslims living in British India to comply with the British government.

The British supported and propagated the view that the Ottomans were caliphs of Islam among Muslims in British India, and the Ottoman sultans helped the British by issuing pronouncements to the Muslims of India telling them to support British rule from Sultan Selim III and Sultan Abdulmejid I.

Around 1880, Sultan Abdul HamidÂ II reasserted the title as a way of countering Russian expansion into Muslim lands. His claim was most fervently accepted by the Sunni Muslims of British India. By the eve of World WarÂ I, the Ottoman state, despite its weakness relative to Europe, represented the largest and most powerful independent Islamic political entity. The sultan also enjoyed some authority beyond the borders of his shrinking empire as caliph of Muslims in Egypt, India and Central Asia.

In 1899, John Hay, U.S. Secretary of State, asked the American ambassador to Ottoman Turkey, Oscar Straus, to approach Sultan Abdul Hamid II to use his position as caliph to order the TausÅ«g people of the Sultanate of Sulu in the Philippines to submit to American suzerainty and American military rule; the Sultan obliged them and wrote the letter which was sent to Sulu via Mecca. As a result, the &quot;Sulu Mohammedans ... refused to join the insurrectionists and had placed themselves under the control of our army, thereby recognizing American sovereignty.&quot;

=== Abolition of the Caliphate (1924) ===


After the Armistice of Mudros of October 1918 with the military occupation of Constantinople and Treaty of Versailles (1919), the position of the Ottomans was uncertain. The movement to protect or restore the Ottomans gained force after the Treaty of SÃ¨vres (August 1920) which imposed the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire and gave Greece a powerful position in Anatolia, to the distress of the Turks. They called for help and the movement was the result. The movement had collapsed by late 1922.

On 3 March 1924, the first president of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk, as part of his reforms, constitutionally abolished the institution of the caliphate. AtatÃ¼rk offered the caliphate to Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi, on the condition that he reside outside Turkey; Senussi declined the offer and confirmed his support for Abdulmejid. The title was then claimed by Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca and Hejaz, leader of the Arab Revolt, but his kingdom was defeated and annexed by ibn Saud in 1925.

Egyptian scholar Ali Abdel Raziq published his 1925 book &quot;Islam and the Foundations of Governance&quot;. The argument of this book has been summarised as &quot;Islam does not advocate a specific form of government&quot;. He focussed his criticism both at those who use religious law as contemporary political proscription and at the history of rulers claiming legitimacy by the caliphate. Raziq wrote that past rulers spread the notion of religious justification for the caliphate &quot;so that they could use religion as a shield protecting their thrones against the attacks of rebels&quot;.

A summit was convened at Cairo in 1926 to discuss the revival of the caliphate, but most Muslim countries did not participate, and no action was taken to implement the summit&#x27;s resolutions. Though the title &quot;Ameer al-Mumineen&quot; was adopted by the King of Morocco and by Mohammed Omar, former head of the Taliban of Afghanistan, neither claimed any legal standing or authority over Muslims outside the borders of their respective countries.

Since the end of the Ottoman Empire, occasional demonstrations have been held calling for the re-establishment of the caliphate. Organisations which call for the re-establishment of the caliphate include Hizb ut-Tahrir and the Muslim Brotherhood. The AKP government in Turkey, a former Muslim Brotherhood ally who has adopted Neo-Ottomanist policies throughout its rule, has been accused of intending to restore the caliphate.

=== Parallel regional caliphates to the Ottomans ===
==== Indian subcontinent ====
After the Umayyad campaigns in India and the conquest on small territories of the western part of the Indian peninsula, early Indian Muslim dynasties were founded by the Ghurid dynasty and the Ghaznavids, most notably the Delhi Sultanate. The Indian sultanates did not extensively strive for a caliphate since the Ottoman Empire was already observing the caliphate.

The emperors of the Mughal Empire, who were the only Sunni rulers whose territory and wealth could compete with that of the Ottomans, started assuming the title of caliph and calling their capital as the &quot;Dar-ul-khilafat&quot; (&quot;abode of the caliphate&quot;) since the time of the third emperor Akbar like their Timurid ancestors. A gold coin struck under Akbar called him the &quot;great &quot;sultan&quot;, the exalted &quot;khalifah&quot;&quot;. Although the Mughals did not acknowledge the overlordship of Ottomans, they nevertheless used the title of caliph to honour them in diplomatic exchanges. Akbar&#x27;s letter to Suleiman the Magnificent addressed the latter as having attained the rank of the caliphate, while calling Akbar&#x27;s empire as the &quot;Khilafat of realms of Hind and Sind.&quot; The fifth emperor Shah Jahan also laid claim to the Caliphate. Although the Mughal Empire is not recognised as a caliphate, its sixth emperor Aurangzeb has often been regarded as one of the few Islamic caliphs to have ruled the Indian peninsula. He received support from the Ottoman sultans such as Suleiman II and Mehmed IV. As a memoriser of Quran, Aurangzeb fully established sharia in South Asia via his Fatawa &#x27;Alamgiri. He re-introduced jizya and banned Islamically unlawful activities. However, Aurangzeb&#x27;s personal expenses were covered by his own incomes, which included the sewing of caps and trade of his written copies of the Quran. Thus, he has been compared to the second caliph, Umar bin Khattab, and Kurdish conqueror Saladin. The Mughal emperors continued to be addressed as caliphs until the reign of Shah Alam II.

Other notable rulers such as Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, Alauddin Khilji, Firuz Shah Tughlaq, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, Babur, Sher Shah Suri, Nasir I of Kalat, Tipu Sultan, Nawabs of Bengal, and the Khwaja Salimullah were popularly given the term &quot;khalifa&quot;.

==== Bornu Caliphate (1472â1893) ====
The Bornu Caliphate, which was headed by the Bornu emperors, began in 1472. A rump state of the larger Kanem-Bornu Empire, its rulers held the title of caliph until 1893, when it was absorbed into the British Colony of Nigeria and Northern Cameroons Protectorate. The British recognised them as the &#x27;sultans of Bornu&#x27;, one step down in Muslim royal titles. After Nigeria became independent, its rulers became the &#x27;emirs of Bornu&#x27;, another step down.

==== Yogyakarta Caliphate (1755â2015) ====
The Indonesian sultan of Yogyakarta historically used &quot;Khalifatullah&quot; (Caliph of God) as one of his many titles. In 2015 sultan Hamengkubuwono X renounced any claim to the caliphate to facilitate his daughter&#x27;s inheritance of the throne, as the theological opinion of the time was that a woman may hold the secular office of sultan but not the spiritual office of caliph.

==== Sokoto Caliphate (1804â1903) ====

The Sokoto Caliphate was an Islamic state in what is now Nigeria led by Usman dan Fodio. Founded during the Fulani War in the early nineteenth century, it controlled one of the most powerful empires in sub-Saharan Africa prior to European conquest and colonisation culminating in the Adamawa Wars and the Battle of Kano. The caliphate remained extant through the colonial period and afterwards, though with reduced power. The current head of the Sokoto Caliphate is Sa&#x27;adu Abubakar.

==== Toucouleur Empire (1848â1893) ====
The Toucouleur Empire, also known as the Tukular Empire, was one of the Fulani jihad states in sub-saharan Africa. It was eventually pacified and annexed by the French Republic, being incorporated into French West Africa.

==== Khilafat Movement (1919â1924) ====
The Khilafat Movement was launched by Muslims in British India in 1920 to defend the Ottoman Caliphate at the end of the First World War and it spread throughout the British colonial territories. It was strong in British India where it formed a rallying point for some Indian Muslims as one of many anti-British Indian political movements. Its leaders included Mohammad Ali Jouhar, his brother Shawkat Ali and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Hakim Ajmal Khan and Barrister Muhammad Jan Abbasi. For a time it was supported by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was a member of the Central Khilafat Committee. However, the movement lost its momentum after the abolition of the caliphate in 1924. After further arrests and flight of its leaders, and a series of offshoots splintered off from the main organisation, the Movement eventually died down and disbanded.

==== Sharifian Caliphate (1924â1931) ====
The Sharifian Caliphate () was an Arab caliphate proclaimed by the Sharifian rulers of Hejaz in 1924 previously known as Vilayet Hejaz, declaring independence from the Ottoman Caliphate. The idea of the Sharifian Caliphate had been floating around since at least the fifteenth century. In the Arab world, it represented the culmination of a long struggle to reclaim the caliphate from Ottoman hands. The first Arab revolts challenging the validity of the Ottoman caliphate and demanding that an Arab Sayyid be chosen as caliph can be traced back to 1883 when Sheikh Hamat-al-Din seized Sanaa and called for the caliphate as a Sayyid.

However, it was not until the end of the Ottoman caliphate, abolished by the Kemalists, that Hussein bin Ali was proclaimed caliph in March 1924. His stance towards the Ottoman caliphate was ambiguous, and while he was hostile to it, he preferred to wait for its official abolition before assuming the title, so as not to break the Ummah by creating a second caliph alongside the Ottoman caliph. He also supported financially the late Ottoman dynasty in exile, to avoid them being ruined.

His caliphate was opposed by the British Empire, Zionists, and Wahhabis, but he received support from a large part of the Muslim population at the time, as well as from Mehmed VI. Although he lost the Hejaz and was exiled, then imprisoned by the British on Cyprus, Hussein continued to use the title until his death in 1931.

== Non-political caliphates ==
Though non-political, some Sufi orders and the Ahmadiyya movement define themselves as caliphates. Their leaders are thus commonly referred to as &quot;khalifas&quot; (caliphs).

=== Sufi caliphates ===
In Sufism, tariqas (orders) are led by spiritual leaders (&quot;khilafah ruhaniyyah&quot;), the main khalifas, who nominate local khalifas to organise zaouias. Sufi caliphates are not necessarily hereditary. Khalifas are aimed to serve the &quot;silsilah&quot; in relation to spiritual responsibilities and to propagate the teachings of the tariqa.

=== Ahmadiyya Caliphate (1908âpresent) ===
The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a self-proclaimed Islamic revivalist movement founded in 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, India, who claimed to be the promised Messiah and Mahdi, awaited by Muslims. He also claimed to be a follower-prophet subordinate to Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. The group are traditionally shunned by the majority of Muslims.

After Ahmad&#x27;s death in 1908, his first successor, Hakeem Noor-ud-Din, became the caliph of the community and assumed the title of &quot;Khalifatul Masih&quot; (Successor or Caliph of the Messiah). After Hakeem Noor-ud-Din, the first caliph, the title of the Ahmadiyya caliph continued under Mirza Mahmud Ahmad, who led the community for over 50 years. Following him were Mirza Nasir Ahmad and then Mirza Tahir Ahmad who were the third and fourth caliphs respectively. The current caliph is Mirza Masroor Ahmad, who lives in London.

== Period of dormancy ==

Once the subject of intense conflict and rivalry among Muslim rulers, the caliphate lay dormant and largely unclaimed since the 1920s. For the majority of Muslims, the caliph, as leader of the ummah, &quot;is cherished both as memory and ideal&quot; as a time when Muslims &quot;enjoyed scientific and military superiority globally&quot;. Muhammad is reported to have prophesied:

=== Abu Issa caliphate (1993 â c. 2014) ===
A contemporary effort to re-establish the caliphate by supporters of armed jihad that predates Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the Islamic State and was much less successful, was &quot;the forgotten caliphate&quot; of Muhammad bin Ê¿Issa bin Musa al RifaÊ¿i (&quot;known to his followers as Abu Ê¿Issa&quot;). This &quot;microcaliphate&quot; was founded on 3 April 1993 on the PakistanâAfghanistan border, when Abu Issa&#x27;s small number of &quot;Afghan Arabs&quot; followers swore loyalty () to him. Abu Issa, was born in the city of Zarqa, Jordan and like his followers had come to Afghanistan to wage jihad against the Soviets. Unlike them he had ancestors in the tribe of Quraysh, a traditional requirement for a caliph. The caliphate was ostensibly an attempt to unite the many other jihadis who were not his followers and who were quarrelling among each other. It was not successful. Abu Issa&#x27;s efforts to compel them to unite under his command were met &quot;with mockery and then force&quot;. Local Afghans also despised him and his followers. Like the later Islamic State he tried to abolish infidel currency and rejected nationalism. According to scholar Kevin Jackson,

The territory under his control &quot;did not extend beyond a few small towns&quot; in Afghanistan&#x27;s Kunar province. Eventually he did not even control this area after the Taliban took it over in the late 1990s. The caliphate then moved to London, where they &quot;preach[ed] to a mostly skeptical jihadi intelligentsia about the obligation of establishing a caliphate&quot;. They succeeded in attracting some jihadis (Yahya al-Bahrumi, Abu Umar al Kuwaiti) who later joined the Islamic State. Abu Issa died in 2014, &quot;after spending most of his final years in prison in London&quot;. Abu Umar al Kuwaiti became a judge for the Islamic state but was later executed for extremism after he &quot;took takfir to new levelsÂ ... pronouncing death sentences for apostasy on those who were ignorant of scripture â and then pronouncing takfir on those too reluctant to pronounce takfir.&quot;

=== Islamic State (2014âpresent) ===
A network of Islamist militants formed the Al-Qaeda in Iraq affiliate during the Iraq War (2003â2011). The group eventually expanded into Syria and rose to prominence as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) during the Syrian Civil War. In the summer of 2014, the group launched the Northern Iraq offensive, seizing the city of Mosul. The group declared itself a caliphate under Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on 29 June 2014 and renamed itself as the &quot;Islamic State&quot;. ISIL&#x27;s claim to be the highest authority of Muslims has been widely rejected. No prominent Muslim scholar has supported its declaration of caliphate; even Salafi jihadist preachers accused the group of engaging in political showmanship and bringing disrepute to the notion of Islamic state.

ISIL has been at war with armed forces including the Iraqi Army, the Syrian Army, the Free Syrian Army, Al-Nusra Front, Syrian Democratic Forces, and Iraqi Kurdistan&#x27;s Peshmerga and People&#x27;s Protection Units (YPG) along with a 60 nation coalition in its efforts to establish a de facto state on Iraqi and Syrian territory. At its height in 2014, the Islamic State held &quot;about a third of Syria and 40 percent of Iraq&quot;. By December 2017 it had lost 95% of that territory, including Mosul, Iraq&#x27;s second largest city, and the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, its capital. Its caliph, Al-Baghdadi, was killed in a raid by U.S. forces on 26 October 2019, its &quot;last holdout&quot;, the town of Al-Baghuz Fawqani, fell to Syrian Democratic Forces on 23 March 2019.

=== Ahmadiyya view ===

The members of the Ahmadiyya community believe that the Ahmadiyya Caliphate is the continuation of the Islamic caliphate, first being the &quot;RÄshidÅ«n&quot; (rightly guided) Caliphate (of Righteous Caliphs). This is believed to have been suspended with Ali, the son-in-law of Muhammad and re-established with the appearance of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835â1908, the founder of the movement) whom Ahmadis identify as the Promised Messiah and Mahdi.

Ahmadis maintain that in accordance with Quranic verses (such as ) and numerous ahadith on the issue, caliphates can only be established by God himself. and is a divine blessing given to &quot;those who believe and work righteousness&quot; and uphold the unity of God, therefore any movement to establish the caliphates centered on human endeavours alone is bound to fail, particularly when the condition of the people diverges from the &quot;precepts of prophethood&quot; and they are as a result disunited, their inability to establish a caliphate caused fundamentally by the lack of righteousness in them. Although the caliph is elected, it is believed that God himself directs the hearts of believers towards an individual. Thus the caliph is designated neither necessarily by right (i.e. the rightful or competent one in the eyes of the people at that time) nor merely by election but primarily by God.

According to Ahmadiyya thought, a khalifa need not be the head of a state; rather the Ahmadiyya community emphasises the spiritual and organisational significance of the KhilÄfah. It is primarily a religious/spiritual office, with the purpose of upholding, strengthening and spreading Islam and of maintaining the high spiritual and moral standards within the global community established by Muhammadâwho was not merely a political leader but primarily a religious leader. If a khalifa does happen to bear governmental authority as a head of state, it is incidental and subsidiary in relation to his overall function as khalifa which is applicable to believers transnationally and not limited to one particular state.

Ahmadi Muslims believe that God has assured them that this caliphate will endure to the end of time, depending on their righteousness and faith in God. The Khalifa provides unity, security, moral direction and progress for the community. It is required that the Khalifa carry out his duties through consultation and taking into consideration the views of the members of the &quot;Shura&quot; (consultative body). However, it is not incumbent upon him to always accept the views and recommendations of the members. The Khalifatul Masih has overall authority for all religious and organisational matters and is bound to decide and act in accordance with the Qur&#x27;an and sunnah.

==== Islamist call ====
A number of Islamist political parties and mujahideen called for the restoration of the caliphate by uniting Muslim nations, either through political action (e.g. Hizb ut-Tahrir), or through force (e.g. al-Qaeda). Various Islamist movements gained momentum in recent years with the ultimate aim of establishing a caliphate. In 2014, ISIL/ISIS made a claim to re-establishing the caliphate. Those advocating the re-establishment of a caliphate differed in their methodology and approach. Some were locally oriented, mainstream political parties that had no apparent transnational objectives.

Abul A&#x27;la Maududi believed the caliph was not just an individual ruler who had to be restored, but was man&#x27;s representation of God&#x27;s authority on Earth:
The Muslim Brotherhood advocates pan-Islamic unity and the implementation of Islamic law. Founder Hassan al-Banna wrote about the restoration of the caliphate.

One transnational group whose ideology was based specifically on restoring the caliphate as a pan-Islamic state is Hizb ut-Tahrir (literally, &quot;Party of Liberation&quot;). It is particularly strong in Central Asia and Europe and is growing in strength in the Arab world. It is based on the claim that Muslims can prove that God exists and that the Qur&#x27;an is the word of God. Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s stated strategy is a non-violent political and intellectual struggle.

In Southeast Asia, groups such as Jemaah Islamiyah aimed to establish a Caliphate across Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and parts of Thailand, the Philippines and Cambodia.

=== Al-Qaeda&#x27;s caliphate goals ===

Al-Qaeda has as one of its clearly stated goals the re-establishment of a caliphate. Its former leader, Osama bin Laden, called for Muslims to &quot;establish the righteous caliphate of our umma&quot;. Al-Qaeda chiefs released a statement in 2005, under which, in what they call &quot;phase five&quot; there will be &quot;an Islamic state, or caliphate&quot;. Al-Qaeda has named its Internet newscast from Iraq &quot;The Voice of the Caliphate&quot;. According to author and Egyptian native Lawrence Wright, Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden&#x27;s mentor and al-Qaeda&#x27;s second-in-command until 2011, once &quot;sought to restore the caliphate... which had formally ended in 1924 following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire but which had not exercised real power since the thirteenth century.&quot; Zawahiri believes that once the caliphate is re-established, Egypt would become a rallying point for the rest of the Islamic world, leading the &quot;jihad&quot; against the West. &quot;Then history would make a new turn, God willing&quot;, Zawahiri later wrote, &quot;in the opposite direction against the empire of the United States and the world&#x27;s Jewish government&quot;.

=== Opposition ===
Scholar Olivier Roy writes that &quot;early on, Islamists replace the concept of the caliphate ... with that of the emir.&quot; There were a number of reasons including &quot;that according to the classical authors, a caliph must be a member of the tribe of the Prophet (the Quraysh) ... moreover, caliphs ruled societies that the Islamists do not consider to have been Islamic (the Ottoman Empire).&quot; This is not the view of the majority of Islamist groups, as both the Muslim Brotherhood and Hizb ut-Tahrir view the Ottoman state as a caliphate.

== Religious basis ==
=== Quran ===
The Quran uses the term &quot;khalifa&quot; twice. First, in Surah Al-Baqara , it refers to God creating humanity as his &quot;khalifa&quot; on Earth. Second, in Surah Sad , it addresses King David as God&#x27;s &quot;khalifa &quot;and reminds him of his obligation to rule with justice.

In addition, the following excerpt from the Quran, known as the &#x27;Istikhlaf Verse&#x27;, is used by some to argue for a Quranic basis for a caliphate:
Several schools of jurisprudence and thought within Sunni Islam argue that to govern a state by Sharia is, by definition, to rule via the caliphate and use the following verses to sustain their claim.

=== &quot;Hadith&quot; ===
The following &quot;hadith&quot; from Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal can be understood to prophesy two eras of the caliphate (both on the lines/precepts of prophethood).

In the above, the first era of the caliphate is commonly accepted by Muslims to be that of the Rashidun Caliphate.

Nafi&#x27;a reported saying:
Hisham ibn Urwah reported on the authority of Abu Saleh on the authority of Abu Hurairah that Muhammad said:

It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Prophet of Allah said:

Narrated Abu Huraira:
=== Prophesied caliphate of the Mahdi ===

Many Islamic texts, including several ahadith, state that the Mahdi will be elected caliph and rule over a caliphate. A number of Islamic figures titled themselves both &quot;caliph&quot; and &quot;al-Mahdi&quot;, including the first Abbasid caliph As-Saffah.

=== The &quot;Sahaba&quot; of Muhammad ===
Al-Habbab Ibn ul-Munthir said, when the Sahaba met in the wake of the death of Muhammad, (at the thaqifa hall) of Bani Saâida: Upon this Abu Bakr replied: 

Then he got up and addressed the Muslims.

It has additionally been reported that Abu Bakr went on to say on the day of Al-Saqifa: 

The Sahaba agreed to this and selected Abu Bakr as their first Khaleef. Habbab ibn Mundhir who suggested the idea of two Ameers corrected himself and was the first to give Abu Bakr the Bay&#x27;ah. This indicates an Ijma as-Sahaba of all of the Sahaba. Ali ibni abi Talib, who was attending the body of Muhammad at the time, also consented to this.

Imam Ali whom the Shia revere said: 

=== Views of Islamic theologians ===
Scholars like Al-Mawardi, Ibn Hazm, Ahmad al-Qalqashandi, and Al-Sha`rani stated that the global Muslim community can have only one leader at any given time. Al-Nawawi and Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad declared it impermissible to give oaths of loyalty to more than one leader.

Al-Joziri said: 

Shia scholars have expressed similar opinions. However, the Shia school of thought states that the leader must not be appointed by the Islamic ummah, but must be appointed by God.

Al-Qurtubi said that the caliph is the &quot;pillar upon which other pillars rest&quot;, and said of the Quranic verse, &quot;Indeed, man is made upon this earth a Caliph&quot;:
An-Nawawi said:

Al-Ghazali when writing of the potential consequences of losing the caliphate said:

Ibn Taymiyyah said:

== Government ==
=== Electing or appointing a caliph ===
In his book &quot;The Early Islamic Conquests&quot; (1981), Fred Donner argues that the standard Arabian practice during the early caliphates was for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader&#x27;s death and elect a leader from among themselves, although there was no specified procedure for this shura, or consultative assembly. Candidates were usually from the same lineage as the deceased leader, but they were not necessarily his sons. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual direct heir, as there was no basis in the majority Sunni view that the head of state or governor should be chosen based on lineage alone. Since the Umayyads, all caliphates have been dynastic.

Traditionally, Sunni Muslim madhhabs all agreed that a caliph must be a descendant of the Quraysh. Al-Baqillani has said that the leader of the Muslims simply should be from the majority.

=== Sunni belief ===
Following the death of Muhammad, a meeting took place at Saqifah. At that meeting, Abu Bakr was elected caliph by the Muslim community. Sunni Muslims developed the belief that the caliph is a temporal political ruler, appointed to rule within the bounds of Islamic law (Sharia). The job of adjudicating orthodoxy and Islamic law was left to mujtahids, legal specialists collectively called the Ulama. Many Muslims call the first four caliphs the Rashidun, meaning the &quot;Rightly Guided&quot;, because they are believed to have followed the Qur&#x27;an and the sunnah of Muhammad.

=== Shia belief ===
With the exception of Zaidis, Shia Muslims believe in the Imamate, a principle by which rulers are imams who are divinely chosen, infallible and sinless and must come from the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot; regardless of majority opinion, shura or election. They claim that before his death, Muhammad had given many indications, in the hadith of the pond of Khumm in particular, that he considered Ali, his cousin and son-in-law, as his successor. For the Twelvers, Ali and his eleven descendants, the Twelve Imams, are believed to have been considered, even before their birth, as the only valid Islamic rulers appointed and decreed by God. Shia Muslims believe that all the Muslim caliphs following Muhammad&#x27;s death to be illegitimate due to their unjust rule and that Muslims have no obligation to follow them, as the only guidance that was left behind, as ordained in the hadith of the two weighty things, was the Islamic holy book, the Quran and Muhammad&#x27;s family and offspring, who are believed to be infallible, therefore able to lead society and the Muslim community with complete justice and equity. The Prophet&#x27;s own grandson, and third Shia imam, Hussain ibn Ali led an uprising against injustice and the oppressive rule of the Muslim caliph at the time at the Battle of Karbala. Shia Muslims emphasise that values of social justice, and speaking out against oppression and tyranny are not merely moral values, but values essential to a person&#x27;s religiosity.

After these Twelve Imams, the potential caliphs, had passed, and in the absence of the possibility of a government headed by their imams, some Twelvers believe it was necessary that a system of Shi&#x27;i Islamic government based on the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist be developed, due to the need for some form of government, where an Islamic jurist or faqih rules Muslims, suffices. However, this idea, developed by the marja&#x27; Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and established in Iran, is not universally accepted among the Shia.

Ismailis believe in the Imamate principle mentioned above, but they need not be secular rulers as well.
* The Nizari continue to have a living imam; the current imam is the Aga Khan.
* The Taiyabi Ismaili have, since the year 1130, followed the imam&#x27;s chief officer, the Dai al-Mutlaq, as they believe the imams are in a state of hiding.

=== &quot;Majlis al-Shura&quot; ===

The Majlis al-Shura (literally &quot;consultative assembly&quot;) was a representation of the idea of consultative governance. The importance of this is premised by the following verses of the Qur&#x27;an:
* &quot;...who respond to their Lord, establish prayer, conduct their affairs by mutual consultation&quot;()
* &quot;...and consult with them in Ë¹conductingËº matters. Once you make a decision, put your trust in Allah.&quot;()

The majlis is also the means to elect a new caliph. Al-Mawardi has written that members of the majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, have enough knowledge to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one and have sufficient wisdom and judgement to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also said that in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves should create a majlis and select a list of candidates for caliph; then the majlis should select a caliph from the list of candidates.

Some Islamist interpretations of the role of the Majlis al-Shura are the following: In an analysis of the shura chapter of the Qur&#x27;an, Islamist author Sayyid Qutb argues that Islam only requires the ruler to consult with some of the representatives of the ruled and govern within the context of the Sharia. Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, the founder of a transnational political movement devoted to the revival of the caliphate, writes that although the Shura is an important part of &quot;the ruling structure&quot; of the Islamic caliphate, &quot;(it is) not one of its pillars&quot;, meaning that its neglect would not make a caliph&#x27;s rule un-Islamic such as to justify a rebellion. However, the Muslim Brotherhood, the largest Islamic movement in Egypt, has toned down these Islamist views by accepting in principle that in the modern age the Majlis al-Shura is democracy.

=== Accountability of rulers ===
Al-Mawardi said that if the rulers meet their Islamic responsibilities to the public the people must obey their laws, but a caliph or ruler who becomes either unjust or severely ineffective must be impeached via the Majlis al-Shura. Al-Juwayni argued that Islam is the goal of the ummah, so any ruler who deviates from this goal must be impeached. Al-Ghazali believed that oppression by a caliph is sufficient grounds for impeachment. Rather than just relying on impeachment, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani stated that the people have an obligation to rebel if the caliph begins to act with no regard for Islamic law. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said that to ignore such a situation is &quot;haraam&quot; and those who cannot revolt from inside the caliphate should launch a struggle from outside. Al-Asqalani used two ayahs from the Qur&#x27;an to justify this:
Islamic lawyers commented that when the rulers refuse to step down after being impeached through the Majlis, becoming dictators through the support of a corrupt army, if the majority is in agreement they have the option to launch a revolution. Many noted that this option is to be exercised only after factoring in the potential cost of life.

=== Rule of law ===

The following hadith establishes the principle of rule of law in relation to nepotism and accountability

Various Islamic lawyers, however, place multiple conditions and stipulations on the execution of such a law, making it difficult to implement. For example, the poor cannot be penalised for stealing out of poverty, and during a time of drought in the Rashidun caliphate, capital punishment was suspended until the effects of the drought passed.

Islamic jurists later formulated the concept that all classes were subject to the law of the land, and no person is above the law; officials and private citizens alike have a duty to obey the same law. Furthermore, a Qadi (Islamic judge) was not allowed to discriminate on the grounds of religion, race, colour, kinship or prejudice. In a number of cases, caliphs had to appear before judges as they prepared to render their verdict.

According to Noah Feldman, a law professor at Harvard University, the system of legal scholars and jurists responsible for the rule of law was replaced by the codification of Sharia by the Ottoman Empire in the early nineteenth century:

=== Economy ===
During the Muslim Agricultural Revolution, the caliphate understood that real incentives were needed to increase productivity and wealth and thus enhance tax revenues. A social transformation took place as a result of changing land ownership giving individuals of any gender, ethnic or religious background the right to buy, sell, mortgage and inherit land for farming or any other purpose. Signatures were required on contracts for every major financial transaction concerning agriculture, industry, commerce and employment. Copies of the contract were usually kept by both parties involved.

Early forms of proto-capitalism and free markets were present in the caliphate, since an early market economy and early form of merchant capitalism developed between the 8th and 12th centuries, which some refer to as &quot;Islamic capitalism&quot;. A vigorous monetary economy developed based on the circulation of a stable high-value currency (the dinar) and the integration of previously independent monetary areas. Business techniques and forms of business organisation employed during this time included early contracts, bills of exchange, long-distance international trade, early forms of partnership (&quot;mufawada&quot;) such as limited partnerships (&quot;mudaraba&quot;) and early forms of credit, debt, profit, loss, capital (&quot;al-mal&quot;), capital accumulation (&quot;nama al-mal&quot;), circulating capital, capital expenditure, revenue, cheques, promissory notes, trusts (&quot;waqf&quot;), startup companies, savings accounts, transactional accounts, pawning, loaning, exchange rates, bankers, money changers, ledgers, deposits, assignments, the double-entry bookkeeping system, and lawsuits. Organisational enterprises similar to corporations independent from the state also existed in the medieval Islamic world. Many of these concepts were adopted and further advanced in medieval Europe from the thirteenth century onwards.

Early Islamic law included collection of &quot;zakat&quot; (charity), one of the Five Pillars of Islam, since the time of the first Islamic State, established by Muhammad at Medina. The taxes (including &quot;zakat&quot; and &quot;jizya&quot;) collected in the treasury (&quot;Bayt al-mal&quot;) of an Islamic government were used to provide income for the needy, including the poor, elderly, orphans, widows and the disabled. During the caliphate of Abu Bakr, a number of the Arab tribes, who had accepted Islam at the hand of The Prophet Muhammad, rebelled and refused to continue to pay the Zakat, leading to the Ridda Wars. Caliph Umar added to the duties of the state an allowance, paid on behalf of every man woman and child, starting at birth, creating the world&#x27;s first state run social welfare program.

Maya Shatzmiller states that the demographic behaviour of medieval Islamic society varied in some significant respects from other agricultural societies. Nomadic groups within places like the deserts of Egypt and Morocco maintained high birth rates compared to rural and urban populations, though periods of extremely high nomadic birth rates seem to have occurred in occasional &quot;surges&quot; rather than on a continuous basis. Individuals living in large cities had much lower birth rates, possibly due to the use of birth control methods and political or economic instability. This led to population declines in some regions. While several studies have shown that Islamic scholars enjoyed a life expectancy of 59â75 years between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, the overall life expectancy of men in the same societies was lower. Factoring in infant mortality, Lawrence Conrad estimates the average lifespan in the early Islamic caliphate to be above 35 years for the general population, compared to around 40 years for the population of Classical Greece and 31 years for the population of thirteenth-century England.

The early Islamic Empire also had the highest literacy rates among pre-modern societies, alongside the city of classical Athens in the fourth century BC, and later, China after the introduction of printing from the tenth century. One factor for the relatively high literacy rates in the early Islamic Empire was its parent-driven educational marketplace, as the state did not systematically subsidise educational services until the introduction of state funding under Nizam al-Mulk in the eleventh century. Another factor was the diffusion of paper from China, which led to an efflorescence of books and written culture in Islamic society; thus papermaking technology transformed Islamic society from an oral to scribal culture, comparable to the later shifts from scribal to typographic culture, and from typographic culture to the Internet. Other factors include the widespread use of paper books in Islamic society (more so than any other previously existing society), the study and memorisation of the Quran, flourishing commercial activity and the emergence of the Maktab and Madrasah educational institutions.

== Notable caliphs ==

* &quot;Rashidun&quot; (&quot;Righteously Guided&quot;)
** Abu Bakr, first Rashidun caliph. Subdued rebel tribes in the Ridda wars.
** Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), second Rashidun caliph. During his reign, the Islamic empire expanded to include Egypt, Jerusalem and Persia.
** Uthman, (Uthman ibn Affan) third Rashidun caliph, When Caliph Umar died in office aged 59/60 years, Uthman, aged 64/65 years, succeeded him and was the second oldest to rule as caliph. Under Uthman&#x27;s leadership, the Islamic empire expanded into Fars (present-day Iran) in 650, and some areas of Khorasan (present-day Afghanistan) in 651. The conquest of Armenia had begun by the 640s.
** Ali (Ali ibn Abu Talib), fourth Rashidun caliph. Considered by Shi&#x27;a Muslims, however, to be the first imam. His reign was fraught with internal conflict, with Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan (Muawiyah I) and Amr ibn al-As controlling the Levant and Egypt regions independently of Ali.
** Hasan ibn Ali, fifth caliph. Considered as &quot;rightly guided&quot; by several historians. He abdicated his right to the caliphate in favour of Muawiyah I to end the potential for ruinous civil war.
* &quot;Umayyad Caliphate&quot;
**Muawiyah I, the first caliph of the Umayyad dynasty. Muawiyah instituted dynastic rule by appointing his son Yazid I as his successor, a trend that would continue through subsequent caliphates.
** Abd al-Malik was the fifth Umayyad caliph, ruling from April 685 until his death in 705. A member of the first generation of born Muslims, his early life in Medina was occupied with pious pursuits. He held administrative and military posts under Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I (r. 661â680) and his own father, Caliph Marwan I (r. 684â685).
** Al-Walid I was the sixth Umayyad caliph, ruling from October 705 until his death. He was the eldest son of his predecessor Caliph Abd al-Malik.
** Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (Umar II), Umayyad caliph who is considered one of the finest rulers in Muslim history. He is also considered by some (mainly Sunnis) to be among the &quot;rightly guided&quot; caliphs.
** Yazid II was the ninth Umayyad caliph, ruling from February 720 until his death in 724.
** Hisham was the tenth Umayyad caliph who ruled from 724 until his death in 743. Hisham was a great patron of the arts, and he again encouraged arts in the empire. He also encouraged the growth of education by building more schools, and perhaps most importantly, by overseeing the translation of numerous literary and scientific masterpieces into Arabic. He returned to a stricter interpretation of the Sharia as Umar had, and enforced it, even upon his own family.
** Al-Walid II was an Umayyad caliph who ruled from 743 until his death in the year 744.
** Yazid III was the twelfth Umayyad caliph. He reigned for six months, from 15 April to 3 or 4 October 744, and died in that office.

He is also known for founding the &#x27;round city&#x27; of Madinat al-Salam which was to become the core of imperial Baghdad
** Al-Mahdi was the third Abbasid caliph who reigned from 775 to his death in 785.

*&quot;Ottoman Caliphate&quot;
** Selim I, the 9th Sultan, the 1st caliph and maiden title holder of &quot;Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques&quot; of the Ottoman Empire. Under his reign, the Empire grew by seventy per cent.
** Suleiman the Magnificent, the 2nd Ottoman caliph, during whose reign the Ottoman Empire reached its zenith
** Ahmed I, the 8th Ottoman caliph, who is well known for his construction of the Blue Mosque, one of the most famous mosques and tourist attraction in Turkey.
** Abdul Hamid II, the 25th and the last Ottoman caliph to rule with independent, absolute power
** Mehmed V, the 26th Ottoman caliph, who made the Ottoman Empire enter into World War I in 1914, which would ultimately lead to the Empire&#x27;s end.
** Abdulmejid II, the 28th and the last caliph of the Ottoman dynasty. Nominally the 37th Head of the Ottoman dynasty. In 1924, Grand National Assembly of Turkey abolished the Ottoman Caliphate and sent Mejid in exile.
*&quot;Sharifian Caliphate&quot;
**Hussein bin Ali, in an attempt to preserve the title proclaimed himself caliph. He preferred to wait for the official abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate before assuming the title, so as not to break the Ummah by creating a second caliph alongside the Ottoman caliph. However his caliphate fell quickly after its conquest by the Sultanate of Nejd (current Saudi Arabia), leaving the title in dormancy.

<text>Sensible Software was a British software company founded by Jon Hare and Chris Yates which was active from March 1986 to June 1999. It released seven number-one hit games and won numerous industry awards.

The company used exaggeratedly small sprites as the player characters in many of their games, including &quot;Mega Lo Mania&quot;, &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot;, &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; and &quot;Sensible Golf&quot;.

==History==
===8-bit era===
Sensible Software was formed in Chelmsford, Essex in 1986 by two former school friends, Jon Hare and Chris Yates. They worked for nine months at LT Software in Basildon, and started Sensible Software in March 1986.

Sensible initially released games for the ZX Spectrum and later the Commodore 64, clinching market praise with &quot;Parallax&quot;, &quot;Shoot&#x27;Em-Up Construction Kit&quot; and &quot;Wizball&quot; (later voted Game of the Decade by &quot;Zzap!64&quot; magazine). At the time, the pair&#x27;s output was well known among gamers for its high-quality and offbeat sense of humour.

In 1988 Martin Galway joined the team, making it a three-way partnership. In mid-1988, it released &quot;Microprose Soccer&quot;, its first venture into association football games.

By 1993 there were 6 staff members.

===16-bit era===
Galway left in 1990 to join Origin Systems in the US, and over the next few years the company swapped the 8-bit machines for the more powerful 16-bit Amiga and Atari ST systems, where games such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&quot;, the &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; series and the &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; series became classics all over Europe, especially in the UK where various Sensible games were number one for 52 weeks of the three-year period between June 1992 â 1995. With the rise of the 16-bit home console market, Sensible&#x27;s games were ported to a wide range of computing platforms, including MS-DOS, the Mega Drive and Super NES.

===32-bit era===
Though Sensible had a strong presence on the 8-bit and 16-bit machines that dominated the late 1980s and early 1990s, this success was not repeated on the 32-bit machines such as the PlayStation prominent in the mid 1990s. The trademark look of cute 2D characters had slipped out of vogue with the advent of cheap 3D rendering abilities and games such as &quot;Actua Soccer&quot; and &quot;FIFA&quot; turned to 2.5D and 3D gradually shoving the &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; series aside though belatedly converting the game to 3D in 1998.

&quot;Sensible Golf&quot;, a simple golf video game (not a simulation), did not perform well in the market and with most of Sensible&#x27;s staffing resources having been thrown into &quot;Sex &#x27;n&#x27; Drugs &#x27;n&#x27; Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, a game that had initially been signed by Renegade Software (a Time Warner Interactive subsidiary) was dropped by their purchasers, GT Interactive (best known for Doom II, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake and Unreal Tournament), the owners were looking for a smooth exit.

Though never finished, this final project was discussed in certain sections of the media outside of the game press. It was featured in an &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; article in mid-1997. Two years later in 1999, the pre-rendered music videos â created for the game with animation by Khalifa Saber â were showcased within a feature piece on &quot;Ex Machina&quot;, a TV show covering the CG animation scene on .tv.

Another cancelled game that was being developed during this final development period was a PlayStation action game titled &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;, also known as &quot;Office Chair Massacre&quot;. Though screenshots have never been released, it was a first-person shooter, inspired somewhat by the simplicity of &quot;Re-Loaded&quot;, a first generation PlayStation game by Gremlin Interactive. Jon Hare has spoken about the project in various interviews, but has never discussed the game&#x27;s content and gameplay features in depth. Aside from the likelihood that it contained themes as controversial as &quot;Sex &#x27;n&#x27; Drugs &#x27;n&#x27; Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, in an interview with &quot;Total Video Game&quot;â³s Derek dela Fuente, Hare mentioned that the game had &quot;hit some technical barriers&quot; during its development.

Sensible Software was sold in 1999 to veteran UK games publishers Codemasters and since this date Hare has maintained a close working relationship with Codemasters, designing many of its games, including a variety of updates of both &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; and &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2006, the Sensible Software game &quot;Sensible World of Soccer&quot; was entered into a Games Canon of the ten most important video games of all time by Stanford University. It was the only game developed in Europe to make the list, which also included &quot;Spacewar!&quot;, &quot;Star Raiders&quot;, &quot;Zork&quot;, &quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;SimCity&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, &quot;Civilization&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot; and the &quot;Warcraft&quot; series.

In 2013, the book &quot;Sensible Software 1986â1999&quot; was released. This comprehensive retrospective on the history of the company was written by &quot;Zzap!64&quot; games journalist Gary Penn in conversational style. It features 19 different contributors including extensive interviews with Jon Hare, plus luminaries of the era including David Darling, Dominik Diamond and Peter Molyneux. Chris Yates declined to be interviewed for the book. Half art book and half retrospective analysis, the book is the first of its kind to cover the creative, business and technical issues that shaped the whole era of early games development in the UK and Sensible Software in particular.

In 2020, the Royal Mail issued a series of postage stamps celebrating great British computer games with &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; commemorated as a first-class stamp.

<doc id="804039" wikidata="Q1268968" url="?curid=804039" title="Dynamical friction">
<text>In astrophysics, dynamical friction or Chandrasekhar friction, sometimes called gravitational drag, is loss of momentum and kinetic energy of moving bodies through gravitational interactions with surrounding matter in space. It was first discussed in detail by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1943.
==Intuitive account==

An intuition for the effect can be obtained by thinking of a massive object moving through a cloud of smaller lighter bodies. The effect of gravity causes the light bodies to accelerate and gain momentum and kinetic energy (see slingshot effect). By conservation of energy and momentum, we may conclude that the heavier body will be slowed by an amount to compensate. Since there is a loss of momentum and kinetic energy for the body under consideration, the effect is called &quot;dynamical friction&quot;.

Another equivalent way of thinking about this process is that as a large object moves through a cloud of smaller objects, the gravitational effect of the larger object pulls the smaller objects towards it. There then exists a concentration of smaller objects behind the larger body (a &quot;gravitational wake&quot;), as it has already moved past its previous position. This concentration of small objects behind the larger body exerts a collective gravitational force on the large object, slowing it down.

Of course, the mechanism works the same for all masses of interacting bodies and for any relative velocities between them. However, while the most probable outcome for an object moving through a cloud is a loss of momentum and energy, as described intuitively above, in the general case it might be either loss or gain. When the body under consideration is gaining momentum and energy the same physical mechanism is called slingshot effect, or &quot;gravity assist&quot;. This technique is sometimes used by interplanetary probes to obtain a boost in velocity by passing close by a planet.

==Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula==
The full Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula for the change in velocity of the object involves integrating over the phase space density of the field of matter and is far from transparent. The Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula reads as
formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the gravitational constant
* formula_3 is the mass under consideration
* formula_4 is the mass of each star in the star distribution
* formula_5 is the velocity of the object under consideration, in a frame where the center of gravity of the matter field is initially at rest
* formula_6 is the &quot;Coulomb logarithm&quot;
* formula_7 is the number density distribution of the stars

The result of the equation is the gravitational acceleration produced on the object under consideration by the stars or celestial bodies, as acceleration is the ratio of velocity and time.

===Maxwell&#x27;s distribution===

A commonly used special case is where there is a uniform density in the field of matter, with matter particles significantly lighter than the major particle under consideration i.e., formula_8 and with a Maxwellian distribution for the velocity of matter particles i.e.,
formula_9
where formula_10 is the total number of stars and formula_11 is the dispersion. In this case, the dynamical friction formula is as follows:

formula_12
where
* formula_13 is the ratio of the velocity of the object under consideration to the modal velocity of the Maxwellian distribution. 
* formula_14 is the error function.
* formula_15 is the density of the matter field.

In general, a simplified equation for the force from dynamical friction has the form

formula_16

where the dimensionless numerical factor formula_17 depends on how formula_18 compares to the velocity dispersion of the surrounding matter.
But note that this simplified expression diverges when formula_19; caution should therefore be exercised when using it.

==Density of the surrounding medium==
The greater the density of the surrounding medium, the stronger the force from dynamical friction. Similarly, the force is proportional to the square of the mass of the object. One of these terms is from the gravitational force between the object and the wake. The second term is because the more massive the object, the more matter will be pulled into the wake. The force is also proportional to the inverse square of the velocity. This means the fractional rate of energy loss drops rapidly at high velocities. Dynamical friction is, therefore, unimportant for objects that move relativistically, such as photons. This can be rationalized by realizing that the faster the object moves through the media, the less time there is for a wake to build up behind it.

==Applications==
Dynamical friction is particularly important in the formation of planetary systems and interactions between galaxies.

===Protoplanets===
During the formation of planetary systems, dynamical friction between the protoplanet and the protoplanetary disk causes energy to be transferred from the protoplanet to the disk. This results in the inward migration of the protoplanet.

===Galaxies===
When galaxies interact through collisions, dynamical friction between stars causes matter to sink toward the center of the galaxy and for the orbits of stars to be randomized. This process is called violent relaxation and can change two spiral galaxies into one larger elliptical galaxy.

===Galaxy clusters===
The effect of dynamical friction explains why the brightest (more massive) galaxy tends to be found near the center of a galaxy cluster. The effect of the two body collisions slows down the galaxy, and the drag effect is greater the larger the galaxy mass. When the galaxy loses kinetic energy, it moves towards the center of the cluster.
However the observed velocity dispersion of galaxies within a galaxy cluster does not depend on the mass of the galaxies. The explanation is that a galaxy cluster relaxes by violent relaxation, which sets the velocity dispersion to a value independent of the galaxy&#x27;s mass.

===Star clusters===
The effect of dynamical friction explains why the most massive stars of SCs tend to be found near the center of star cluster. This concentration of more massive stars in the cluster&#x27;s cores tend to favor collisions between stars, which may trigger the runaway collision mechanism to form intermediate mass black holes. Globular clusters orbiting through the stellar field of a galaxy experience dynamic friction. This drag force causes the cluster to lose energy and spiral in toward the galactic center.

===Photons===

Fritz Zwicky proposed in 1929 that a gravitational drag effect on photons could be used to explain cosmological redshift as a form of tired light. However, his analysis had a mathematical error, and his approximation to the magnitude of the effect should actually have been zero, as pointed out in the same year by Arthur Stanley Eddington. Zwicky promptly acknowledged the correction, although he continued to hope that a full treatment would be able to show the effect.

It is now known that the effect of dynamical friction on photons or other particles moving at relativistic speeds is negligible, since the magnitude of the drag is inversely proportional to the square of velocity. Cosmological redshift is conventionally understood to be a consequence of the expansion of the universe.

<text>The Downing Professorship of the Laws of England is one of the senior professorships in law at the University of Cambridge.

The chair was founded in 1800 in pursuance of the will of Sir George Downing, the founder of Downing College, Cambridge. The professorship was originally attached solely to Downing College (although the Professor undertook University activities). In the early 20th Century, for financial reasons, this professorship, together with the Downing Professor of Medicine, was severed from the College.

The original electors of the chair were the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York, and the masters of the colleges of Clare, St John&#x27;s and Downing.

In 1788 Edward Christian, brother of Fletcher Christian, was appointed to the post prior to its official creation 12 years later. The chair is currently vacant following the departure of Lionel Smith in 2024.

<doc id="804042" wikidata="Q5001849" url="?curid=804042" title="Business band">
<text>In the United States, the business band is the colloquial name used by radio users who utilize and scanner hobbyists who listen to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Industrial/Business pool frequencies. The regulations listing frequencies in this pool are contained in Subpart C of Part 90, Title 47 of the CFR.

==Overview==
The pool describes a series of frequencies on the VHF and UHF two-way radio bands. They are reserved for use by companies and individuals operating commercial activities; educational, philanthropic, or ecclesiastical institutions; clergy activities; or hospitals, clinics, or medical associations. In the United States, use of these frequencies requires a license issued by the U.S. FCC. The exceptions to this are five specific frequencies that are also part of the Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS), which permits unlicensed operation on these frequencies, provided the output power does not exceed 2Â watts. Other frequency bands, such as Citizens Band Radio (CB radio) and Family Radio Service (FRS), may also be used without a license.

Channels are available in several frequency ranges to suit the users&#x27; requirements for propagation and protection from interference. The electromagnetic spectrum between approximately 450 and 470Â MHz is used largely for UHF business communications, although this spectrum is not exclusively for business use. In some large metropolitan areas, such as New York, the UHF-T band (between 470 and 512Â MHz) is also used due to congestion on the standard VHF or UHF bands. There are also a number of specific frequencies, in both the VHF and UHF spectrums, that are for business use; some of these have color-coded names, such as Red Dot or Blue Star.

In 2004, the FCC required all CFR 47 Part 90 VHF (150â174Â MHz) and UHF (421â470Â MHz) PLMR (Private Land Mobile Radio) licensees operating legacy wideband (25Â kHz bandwidth) voice or data/SCADA systems to migrate to narrowband (12.5Â kHz bandwidth or equivalent) systems by January 1, 2013.

==History==
The Private Land Mobile Radio Service (47CFR90, or Part 90 of the FCC Rules) was established in the US in 1927 to permit commercial and public safety uses of two-way radio by commercial entities and non-Federal government agencies. Similar allocations are available in other countries. The available frequencies in the US have traditionally been separated into two pools. One is for industrial and business users, including some special categories such as petroleum, manufacturing, and forestry; the other is for public safety including medical, police, fire, and others. The industrial and business frequencies, sometimes also known as &quot;business band radio,&quot; and the eligibility requirements are listed in 47CFR90.35. Frequencies are licensed on a non-exclusive basis, although fixed stations and mobiles operating in a defined area are issued licenses only following frequency coordination to assure equitable sharing of bandwidth. Anyone conducting commercial business or a number of other activities is eligible for a license.

Other general-purpose two-way radio services with simplified licensing requirements have also been established over the years in the US, including GMRS and CB, the latter now being licensed by rule so that users don&#x27;t need individual licenses. FRS and MURS are similar pools of frequencies that do not require individual licenses in the US.

==Frequency charts==
Although the term &quot;business band&quot; refers to several discrete frequencies that are not grouped into a single band, examples of some of the frequencies are grouped by band and listed below. These charts also list other frequencies that are not specifically part of the &quot;business band&quot; but are commonly used by businesses. An individual license is still required under GMRS rules. A few manufacturers added these DOT frequencies to Business radios in the 1990s to have more &quot;channels&quot; and aid in selling radios. Part 90 (Business) and Part 95 (GMRS) frequencies are not interchangeable and are not to be used under the same guidelines. Each has different criteria for licensing. Part 95 GMRS frequencies are not &quot;Itinerant&quot;, nor business band frequencies.

===Low-band frequencies===

Note: the 27.555 MHz, 27.615 MHz, 27.635 MHz, 27.655 MHz, 27.765 MHz and 27.860 MHz frequencies have no active licenses for any of them. No expired, canceled or terminated licenses exist in the FCC database, indicating that legal users have abandoned the 27.555 MHz - 27.86 MHz frequencies for at least 30 years. 

27.430 MHz, 27.450 MHz, 27.470 MHz and 27.490 MHz all are actively used by current business radio license holders, however. 

The 25.6 MHz to 28 MHz spectrum is heavily used for unlicensed out of band CB radio communications within the U.S. 

Outside of the U.S., numerous additional CB radio allocations exist, including CB radio services that overlap with the 27.54 MHz to 28 MHz allocation, paging systems, land mobile services (outside the U.S.) and additional CB radio allocations exist in the 26 MHz portion as well.

<doc id="804058" wikidata="Q1768721" url="?curid=804058" title="Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China">
<text>The Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China (or the Gujin Tushu Jicheng) is a vast encyclopedic work written in China during the reigns of the Qing dynasty emperors Kangxi and Yongzheng. It was begun in 1700 and completed in 1725. The work was headed and compiled mainly by scholar Chen Menglei (). Later on the Chinese painter Jiang Tingxi helped work on it as well.

The encyclopaedia contained 10,000 volumes. Sixty-four imprints were made of the first edition, known as the Wu-ying Hall edition. The encyclopaedia consisted of 6 series, 32 divisions, and 6,117 sections. It contained 800,000 pages and over 100 million Chinese characters, making it the largest leishu ever printed. Topics covered included natural phenomena, geography, history, literature and government. The work was printed in 1726 using copper movable type printing. It spanned around 10 thousand rolls (). To illustrate the huge size of the &quot;Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China&quot;, it is estimated to have contained 3 to 4 times the amount of material in the &quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;.

In 1908, the Guangxu Emperor of China presented a set of the encyclopaedia in 5,000 fascicles to the China Society of London, which has deposited it on loan to Cambridge University Library. Another one of the three extant copies of the encyclopedia outside of China is located at the C.V. Starr East Asian Library at Columbia University. A complete copy in Japan was destroyed in the 1923 Great KantÅ earthquake.

One of Yongzheng&#x27;s brothers patronised the project for a while, although Yongzheng contrived to give exclusive credit to his father Kangxi instead.

== Name ==
The &quot;Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China&quot; is known as the &quot;Gujin Tushu Jicheng&quot; () or &quot;Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng&quot; () in Chinese, also translated as the &quot;Imperial Encyclopaedia&quot;, the &quot;Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Illustrations and Texts&quot;, the &quot;Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Writings and Charts&quot;, or the &quot;Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times&quot;.

== Compilation ==

The Kangxi Emperor hired Chen Menglei of Fujian to compile the encyclopedia. From 1700 to 1705, Chen Menglei worked day and night, writing most of the book, including 10,000 volumes and around 160 million words. It was originally titled the &quot;Compendium&quot; or Tushu Huibian (å¾ä¹¦æ±ç¼). By 1706 the book&#x27;s first draft was completed, and the Kangxi emperor changed the title to &quot;Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China&quot; (&quot;Gujin Tushu Jicheng&quot;). When the Yongzheng emperor ascended the throne, he ordered Jiang Tingxi to help Chen Menglei finish the encyclopedia for publication by around 1725.

==Outline==
The 6 series are as follows.

# Heavens/Time/Calendrics (åè±¡): Celestial objects, the seasons, calendar mathematics and astronomy, heavenly portents
# Earth/Geography (æ¹è): Mineralogy, political geography, list of rivers and mountains, other nations (Korea, Japan, India, Kingdom of Khotan, Ryukyu Kingdom)
# Man/Society (æè®º): Imperial attributes and annals, the imperial household, biographies of mandarins, kinship and relations, social intercourse, dictionary of surnames, human relations, biographies of women
# Nature (åç©): Procivilities (crafts, divination, games, medicine), spirits and unearthly beings, fauna, flora (all life forms on Earth)
# Philosophy (çå­¦): Classics of non-fiction, aspects of philosophy (numerology, filial piety, shame, etc.), forms of writing, philology and literary studies
# Economy (ç»æµ): education and imperial examination, maintenance of the civil service, food and commerce, etiquette and ceremony, music, the military system, the judicial system, styles of craft and architecture
The six series in total are subdivided into 32 subdivisions.

Note that a pre-modern sense is intended in both &quot;society&quot; (that is, high society) and &quot;economy&quot; (which could be called &quot;society&quot; today), and the other major divisions do not match precisely to English terms.

<text>Uig ( ), also known as &quot;SgÃ¬r&#x27; Ãig&quot;, is a civil parish and community in the west of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. The Parish of Uig is one of the four civil parishes of the Isle of Lewis. It contains the districts of Carloway, East Uig, Bernera and West Uig (commonly known as Uig district or Uig Lewis). The name derives from the Norse word &quot;Vik&quot; meaning &#x27;a bay&#x27;.

==Geography==
The civil parish of Uig extends over a considerable area (roughly ) from the Harris border in the south to Dalmore in the north, and from Brenish in the west to Lochganvich in the east. The district known locally in Lewis as Uig is also called &quot;West Uig&quot; and is broadly the area west of Little Loch Roag (the narrow inlet extending south from (West) Loch Roag). West Uig contains 20 settlements; Uig parish contains 36 settlements. 

West Uig was a district of 2,000 people around the 1841 census, but the Highland Clearances had set in by then and this parish suffered greatly. The villages of Capadale, Pennydonald, Balnicol, Balgreasich and Erista, around where the modern scattered crofting township of Ardroil now stands, were some of the many cleared to make way for sheep farming and country sports.

Bhaltos (Valtos) is the largest village in Uig and is home to about 35 people. Since 1999 the land on the Bhaltos peninsula, comprising also the smaller villages of Cliobh (Cliff), CnÃ¬p (Kneep), Riof (Reef) and Na h-Ãigean (Uigen), has been owned by the community and managed by the Bhaltos Community Trust.

Uig, otherwise known as West Uig, is the largest and most sparsely populated district of the Isle of Lewis. It contains the highest point on Lewis of Mealasbhal (). Nearby Loch Suaineabhat (or Suaineabhal) at is the deepest freshwater loch and with a mean depth of also the most voluminous in Lewis. Loch Langavat (from the Gaelic/Norse meaning &quot;long lake&quot;) to the west covers an area of and is over in length.

The coast has significant inlets notably Little Loch Roag, Loch Thamnabhagh, Loch Reasort and Camas Uig.

Camas Ãig contains a vast strand of shell beach which produces a fertile &quot;machair&quot; fringe. Other shell sand beaches and machair are found at TrÃ igh na Beirigh, Bhaltos, Cliff, Capadale, Mangurstadh and Mealastadh.

The Atlantic west coast from Gallan Head to Loch Resort is dominated by cliffs and many small chasms known as &quot;geodhs&quot;. Inland the land contains a glaciated profile with thin acidic soil and large rock outcrops of Lewisian gneiss. Of geological note is the discovery of the largest sapphire ever found in the British Isles. The stone discovered in 1995 is on display at the National Museum of Scotland.

===Camas Ãig===
Uig Beach () is best known as the site where the Lewis Chessmen () were found. Before 1831, a local crofter discovered a buried hoard of chess pieces, uncovered by a storm. The chessmen are now in the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh with an overseas exhibit in the British Museum in London, and replicas in the Uig Heritage Centre in Tuimisgearraidh. They are mostly carved from walrus tusks, and probably originated in Norway sometime in the 12th century, although when and how they came to be in Uig is unknown.

Camas Ãig is surrounded by the villages of Cradhlasta (Crowlista), Tuimisgearraidh (Timsgarry), Eadar DhÃ  Fhadhail (Ardroil) and CÃ rnais (Carnish). The beach is one of Scotland&#x27;s leading kite-buggy locations, being large, flat, and frequently subject to suitable winds.

==History==
Evidence of extensive Norse settlement has been uncovered, most notably through interpretation of the place names in the district but also through archaeological discoveries, some of which are on display at the Uig Museum. The name Uig is generally accepted to be derived from the old Norse âVÃ­kâ.
Military service â Uig district was a fruitful recruiting ground for soldiers in the 78th Seaforth Highlanders for the Napoleonic Wars, who were notably recruited in four waves in 1778, 1793, 1794 and 1804. Most notable of battle honours won was the victory at Maida, Italy, in 1806 and Java in 1811. Clearances â Despite military service and the ultimate sacrifice by many, the district was the subject of widespread evictions in the nineteenth century to make way for enlarged sheep farms and sporting estates. Villages around Uig Bay that were cleared were: Capadale, Pennydonald, Baileneacail, Baileghreusaich, Earastadh and Mealastadh, the largest township in the district. Parallel with the Highland clearances arose the birth of organised crofting in the 1840s. This produced the individual land holdings and linear township pattern recognisable today. The crofting system has always proved inadequate to provide an income for the people so other forms of income have always been crucial for the survival of these communities. Notable were the kelp industry and the great line fishing industry. The main sporting estates that were set up were at Uig Lodge, Morsgail and Scaliscro.

==Demographics==
The current population of the district is around 400, which is the lowest recorded. This is compounded by an ageing demographic and a &quot;constrictive pyramid&quot; structure. The district had recorded 1,923 residents in 1841, prior to evictions that occurred over the next decade. The most notable evictions resulted in the passage of hundreds of people on the emigrant ships &quot;Marquis of Stafford&quot; and &quot;Barlow&quot; in 1851. At the turn of the twentieth century there were 1,631 residents in the district, and the population dipped below 1,000 for the first time after the Second World War.

According to the 2011 census, there are 873 Gaelic speakers (56%) in Uig parish.

==Clan MacAulay==
Uig is the ancestral seat of the Clan MacAulay (Mac Amhlaigh). Through advanced Y DNA testing of a wide range of males from this family, it has been proven that the ancestor of this family had an Irish origin from well before the advent of surnames. They are distinct from several other unique Macaulay families on the Isle of Lewis, most of whom show Nordic or Scandinavian ancestry. The most famous chief of the Uig Macaulays was Donald Cam MacAulay, and his descendants have included the anti-slavery campaigner Zachary Macaulay and his son Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay who wrote &quot;A History of England&quot;. A later descendant, T. B. MacAulay, founded the Sun Life of Canada insurance company. According to Lewis tradition, Uig is the birthplace of Coinneach Odhar, the Brahan Seer, a Nostradamus-type figure of the 16th century.

==Archaeology and Historical Sites==
The principal historical site in the parish is the Callanish Stones which are a neolithic site of international importance. They are unusual in being cross-shaped with an avenue leading to the central point. This main Calanais site is connected to seven other stone circles in the locality.

Dun Carloway is the second best preserved example of an Iron Age broch in Scotland after Mousa in Shetland. Other brochs in the parish include: DÃ¹n Borrainis, DÃ¹n Bharabhat (CnÃ¬p), DÃ¹n Bharabhat (Bernera), and DÃ¹n StiÃ¹gh.

A well-preserved wheelhouse at CnÃ¬p, and two nearby brochs, make this area important archaeologically. In 1979 a rich female Viking burial was discovered on CnÃ¬p headland. Furthermore, excavations done by GUARD archaeology in 2009 and 2010 found three different burials in shallow pits and on a kerbed mound. These burials contained the remains of nine people over a period of 150 years, between 1770 and 1620 BC. And the bodies were allowed to decay and become partly or wholly skeletonised before being buried.

Pennydonald by Camas Uig was the place of discovery of the Lewis Chessmen in 1831. 

The remains of inter-connected circular houses are by the beach at BÃ²stadh, Bernera. They date from the Iron Age. A reconstruction of this part sub-terranean habitation is located nearby. Intact remains of further pre-Norse houses with overlapping flagstone roofs known as &quot;beehive dwellings&quot; are to be found on the Morsgail Moor and at Aiscleit.

The remains of many Norse water mills which used horizontal carved millstones are throughout the parish. Only one, at Breaclet, Bernera is roofed but others of note are found at Croir, Geisiadar, Pennydonald, Carnish and virtually every other township in the parish.

The remains of nineteenth century fish curing houses are to be found at Little Bernera, Croir, TÃ²b Bhalasaigh, Dunan Carloway, Bhaltos and Carnish. Other important sites are the Bernera lobster pond at TÃ²b BlÃ r Meadha and lobster ponds on the island of Pabaigh MÃ²r.

The ruins of Teampall Bhaltois are no longer visible but geophysical investigations, in 1992, found the buried remains of a rectangular building.

===Pre-reformation chapels===
The distinct remains of the following chapels exist in the parish:
St. Kiarans, Laimisiadar,
St. Michaels, Kirivick,
St. Macrels, Kirkibost, 
St Dondans and St. Michaels, Little Bernera,
St. Peters, Pabaigh MhÃ²r,
St. Christophers, Uig Bay,
Tigh na Beanaich, Aird Uig, and
Tigh na Cailleachan Dhubha, Mealastadh.

==Abhainn Dearg Distillery==
The Abhainn Dearg Red River Distillery, which began distilling in 2008, is located at Carnish in Uig, and claims to be &quot;the first legal distillery in the Outer Hebrides since 1829&quot;.

<doc id="804065" wikidata="Q4932110" url="?curid=804065" title="Bob Collins (broadcaster)">
<text>Bob Collins (February 28, 1942 â February 8, 2000) was a morning DJ on WGN-720AM radio in Chicago. His show was the top-rated morning show for WGN and kept the station at the top of the ratings. His show featured various conversation as well as some music. He also made occasional appearances on WGN-TV, hosting specials such as the Auto Show.

==Early life and education==

Born Harold Wallace Lee and a native of Lakeland, Florida, Collins got his first job in radio at age 14. Known in his youth as &quot;Buddy&quot; Lee, he legally changed his name when his radio career began in the 1960s.

Collins attended the University of Florida and worked for a radio station in Gainesville, Florida in the early 1960s. Ultimately, Collins earned a degree in journalism from Florida Southern College.

==Professional career==
Collins worked early in his career for a radio station in Tampa, Florida, at WKGN Knoxville, Tennessee and then took a job as a disk jockey in Milwaukee at WOKY and WRIT. In 1974, he joined WGN-AM. In July 1986, he succeeded the station&#x27;s legendary and top-rated morning-drive host Wally Phillips. Collins would become Chicago&#x27;s top-rated morning radio host until his death in 2000.

His folksy style appealed to a great many people, as his ratings numbers indicated. He was affectionately known as &quot;Uncle Bobby&quot;.

He enjoyed flying his Zlin 242 L airplane, riding his Honda Gold Wing and the Chicago Cubs.

==Death and legacy==

Collins died in the afternoon of February 8, 2000, after his and a student pilot&#x27;s plane collided upon approach to the runway at the Waukegan Regional Airport in Waukegan, Illinois. The student pilot, Sharon Hock, was directly below him, and they were unaware of each other&#x27;s presence until the collision. Collins attempted to steer his plane to a safe landing, but it crashed and burned atop a nearby hospital, killing him and a passenger and injuring five people on the ground. The student pilot also crashed three blocks away and died. The official report indicated that the control tower personnel were unable to observe or communicate the situation until it was too late.

Many of Collins&#x27; friends and co-workers worked in his memory to have radar and other safety tools installed at the Waukegan Regional Airport to prevent further tragedies.

<text>The Kennedy Professorship of Latin is the senior professorship of Latin at the University of Cambridge.

In 1865, when Benjamin Hall Kennedy retired as headmaster of Shrewsbury School, his friends and former pupils created a fund with the intention of founding a chair in Latin to be named after him. Kennedy himself added Â£500 to the fund on the condition that the chair &quot;not&quot; be named after him. The professorship was thus created in 1869. In 1911, after Kennedy&#x27;s death, the professorship was in fact renamed after him, with the consent of his family.

<text>Dutch Standards are environmental pollutant reference values (i.e., concentrations in environmental media) used in environmental remediation, investigation and cleanup.

Barring a few exceptions, the target values are underpinned by an environmental risk analysis wherever possible and apply to individual substances. In most cases, target values for the various substances are related to a national background concentration that was determined for the Netherlands.

Groundwater target values provide an indication of the benchmark for environmental quality in the long term, assuming that there are negligible risks for the ecosystem. For metals a distinction is made between deep and shallow groundwater. This is because deep and shallow groundwater contain different background concentrations. An arbitrary limit of 10 metres has been adopted. The target values shown below are for &#x27;shallow&#x27; groundwater, 0 â 10 m depth.

The soil remediation intervention values indicate when the functional properties of the soil for humans, plants and animals is seriously impaired or threatened. They are representative of the
level of contamination above which a serious case of soil contamination is deemed to exist. The target values for soil are adjusted for the organic matter (humus) content and soil fraction &lt;0.2Â Î¼m (&quot;Lutum&quot; - Latin, meaning &quot;mud&quot; or &quot;clay&quot;). The values below are calculated for a &#x27;Standard Soil&#x27; with 10% organic matter and 25% &quot;lutum&quot;.

A case of environmental contamination is defined as &#x27;serious&#x27; if &gt;25 m3 soil or &gt;100 m3 groundwater is contaminated above the intervention value.

The values presented below are from Annex 1, Table 1, &quot;Groundwater target values and soil and groundwater intervention values&quot;. In previous versions of the Dutch Standards, target values for soil were also present. However, in the 2009 version, target values for soils have been deleted for all compounds except metals.

<doc id="804074" wikidata="Q1474418" url="?curid=804074" title="Two-way radio">
<text>A two-way radio is a radio transceiver (a radio that can both transmit and receive radio waves), which is used for bidirectional person-to-person voice communication with other users with similar radios, in contrast to a broadcast receiver, which only receives transmissions.

Two-way radios usually use a half-duplex communication channel, which permits two-way communication, albeit with the limitation that only one user can transmit at a time. (This is in contrast to simplex communication, in which transmission can only be sent in one direction, and full-duplex, which allows transmission in both directions simultaneously.) This requires users in a group to take turns talking. The radio is normally in receive mode so the user can hear all other transmissions on the channel. When the user wants to talk, they press a &quot;push-to-talk&quot; button, which turns off the receiver and turns on the transmitter; when the button is released, the receiver is activated again. Multiple channels are provided so separate user groups can communicate in the same area without interfering with each other and some radios are designed to scan the channels in order to find a valid transmission. Other two-way radio systems operate in full-duplex mode, in which both parties can talk simultaneously. This requires either two separate radio channels or channel sharing methods such as time-division duplex (TDD) to carry the two directions of the conversation simultaneously on a single radio frequency.

The first two-way radio was an AM-only device introduced by the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation in 1940 for use by the police and military during World War II, and followed by the company&#x27;s 1943 introduction of the Walkie-Talkie, the best-known example of a two-way radio.

==History==
The first truly mobile two-way radio equipment was developed in Australia in 1923 by Senior Constable Frederick William Downie of the Victorian Police. The Victoria Police were the first in the world to use wireless communication in cars, putting an end to the inefficient status reports via public telephone boxes which had been used until that time. The first sets occupied about half of the floor in the back seat of the Lancia patrol cars.

In 1933, the Bayonne, New Jersey police department successfully operated a two-way system between a central fixed station and radio transceivers installed in police cars; this allowed rapidly directing police response in emergencies.

==Types==
Two-way radio systems can be classified in several ways depending on their attributes.

===Conventional versus trunked===
====Conventional====
In multi-channel systems, channels are used for separate purposes.

=====Scanning in conventional radios=====
Scan features are either not used or scan lists are intentionally kept short in emergency applications. Part of APCO Project 16 set standards for channel access times and delays caused by system overhead. Scan features can further increase these delays. One study said delays of longer than 0.4 seconds (400 milliseconds) in emergency services are not recommended.

====Duplex====
The term &quot;half duplex&quot; is applied to wired communication systems where the circuit can send information in one direction at a time but not both directions at the same time.

* Advantage: duplex channels usually allow repeater operation which extends range (in most cases due to increased transmit power and improved aerial location / height) â especially where hand-held radios are in use.
* Disadvantage: If a radio cannot reach the repeater, it cannot communicate. This can be mitigated with a &quot;talk around&quot; or &quot;car to car&quot; setting where stations out of range of the base can speak directly to each other, alternating transmitting and receiving roles in simplex fashion on a single frequency.

====Analog====
Analog systems may communicate a single condition, such as water level in a livestock tank. A transmitter at the tank site continually sends a signal with a constant audio tone. The tone would change in pitch to indicate the tank&#x27;s water level. A meter at the remote end would vary, corresponding to the tone pitch, to indicate the amount of water present in the livestock tank. Similar methods can be used to telemeter any analog condition. This type of radio system serves a purpose equivalent to a four-to-twenty milliampere loop. In the US, mid-band 72â76Â MHz or UHF 450â470Â MHz interstitial channels are often used for these systems. Some systems multiplex telemetry of several analog conditions by limiting each to a separate range of tone pitches, for example.

====Digital====
Digital systems may communicate text messages from computer-aided dispatch (CAD). For example, a display in a tow truck may give a textual location for a call and any related details. The tow truck driver may press an &quot;acknowledge&quot; button, sending data in the opposite direction and flagging the call as received by the driver. They can be used for analog telemetry systems, such as the livestock tank levels, as described above. Another possibility is the lubricating oil pressure in a transit bus engine, or the current speed of the bus. Analog conditions are translated into data words. Some systems send radio paging messages which can either 1) beep a paging receiver, 2) send a numeric message, or 3) send a text message.

===Engineered versus not engineered===
&quot;Engineered&quot; systems are designed to perform close to a specification or standard. They are designed as systems with all equipment matched to perform together. For example, a modern, local government two-way radio system in the US may be designed to provide 95% area coverage in an urban area. System designers use radio frequency models, terrain models, and signal propagation modeling software in an attempt to accurately estimate where radios will work within a defined geographic area. The models help designers choose equipment, equipment locations, antennas, and estimate how well signals will penetrate buildings. These models will be backed-up by drive testing and actual field signal level measurements. Designers adjust antenna patterns, add or move equipment sites, and design antenna networks in a way that will accomplish the intended level of performance.

===Options, duty cycle, and configuration===

Many mobile and handhelds have a limited duty cycle. Duty Cycle is the ratio of listening time to transmit time and is generally dependent on how well the transmitter can shed the heat from the heat sink on the rear of the radio. A 10% duty cycle (common on handhelds) translates to 10 seconds of transmit time to 90 seconds of receive time. Some mobile and base equipment is specified at different power levels â for example 100% duty cycle at 25 watts and 15% at 40 watts.

===Life of equipment===
In government systems, equipment may be replaced based on budgeting rather than any plan or expected service life. Funding in government agencies may be cyclical or sporadic. Managers may replace computing systems, vehicles, or budget computer and vehicle support costs while ignoring two-way radio equipment. Equipment may remain in use even though maintenance costs are unreasonable when viewed from an efficiency standpoint.

One document says &quot;seven years&quot; is beyond the expected lifetime of walkie-talkies in police service. Batteries are cited as needing replacement more often. Twelve-year-old dispatch consoles mentioned in the same document were identified as usable. These were compared to problematic 21-year-old consoles used elsewhere in the same system.

Another source says system backbone equipment like consoles and base stations are expected to have a fifteen-year life. Mobile radios are expected to last ten years. Walkie talkies typically last eight. In a State of California document, the Department of General Services reports expected service life for a communications console used in the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection is 10 years.

==Two-way radio frequencies==
Typical two-way radios work on fixed radio frequency channels, though some can scan multiple channels in order to find a valid transmission. In an analog, conventional system, (the simplest type of system) a frequency or channel serves as a physical medium or link carrying communicated information. The performance of a radio system is partly dependent on the characteristics of frequency band used. The selection of a frequency for a two-way radio system is affected, in part, by:

* government licensing and regulations.
* local congestion or availability of frequencies.
* terrain, since radio signals travel differently in forests and urban viewsheds.
* the presence of noise, interference, or intermodulation.
* sky wave interference below 50â60Â MHz and tropospheric bending at VHF.
* in the US, some frequencies require approval of a frequency coordination committee.

==UHF versus VHF==
The most common two-way radio systems operate in the VHF and UHF parts of the radio spectrum. Because this part of the spectrum is heavily used for broadcasting and multiple competing uses, spectrum management has become an important activity of governments to regulate radio users in the interests of both efficient and non-interfering use of radio. Both bands are widely applied for different users.

==Range==
The useful direct range of a two-way radio system depends on radio propagation conditions, which are a function of frequency.

There are other factors that affect the range of a two-way radio such as weather, exact frequency used, and obstructions.

<text>The Angrapa (, , , ) is a river that begins in northeastern Poland and ends in the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia. Originating in Lake Mamry, it joins the 101-km-long Instruch at a point near Chernyakhovsk  â variously assessed as lying 140, 169, or 172 km from its source â to form the Pregolya. Its largest tributaries are the 89-km-long GoÅdapa, which joins just before the border, and the Pissa (98 km).

The name Angrapa is derived from the Old Prussian words &quot;anguris&quot; (eel) and &quot;apis&quot; (river). The towns of WÄgorzewo, Ozyorsk and Chernyakhovsk as well as the village of Mayakovskoye, are situated along the course of the Angrapa.

<text>Carl-Heinrich Rudolf Wilhelm von StÃ¼lpnagel (2 January 1886 â 30 August 1944) was a German general in the Wehrmacht during World War II who was an army level commander. While serving as military commander of German-occupied France and as commander of the 17th Army in the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa, StÃ¼lpnagel participated in German war crimes, including authorising reprisal operations against civilian population and cooperating with the Einsatzgruppen in their mass murder of Jews. He was a member of the 20 July Plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, being in charge of the conspirators&#x27; actions in France. After the failure of the plot, he was recalled to Berlin and attempted to commit suicide en route, but failed. Tried on 30 August 1944, he was convicted of treason and executed on the same day.

==Early life==
Born in Berlin into a noble family, StÃ¼lpnagel joined the Prussian Army straight from school in 1904, and served as a general staff officer in World War I. After the war, he served in the Reichswehr reaching the rank of Colonel in 1933. The same year, he was appointed head of the &#x27;Foreign Armies&#x27; branch of the General Staff of the Army. In 1935, he published a memorandum in which he combined anti-Bolshevism with anti-Semitism. By 1936 he was a Major General and commanded the 30th Infantry Division in LÃ¼beck.

On 27 August 1937, as a Lieutenant General, he was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Army. In 1938, after the Blomberg-Fritsch affair and the Sudeten Crisis, he established contact with the Schwarze Kapelle, revealing the secret plan for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. StÃ¼lpnagel took part in the military opposition&#x27;s first plans to remove Hitler from power, but the plans were largely abandoned after the Munich Agreement.

==World War II==

From 20 December 1940 to 4 October 1941, StÃ¼lpnagel was a General of Infantry (April 1939) and commanded the 17th Army. On 22 June 1941, after the launch of Operation Barbarossa, he successfully led this army across southern Russia on the Eastern Front. Under StÃ¼lpnagel&#x27;s command, the 17th Army achieved victory during the Battle of Uman and the Battle of Kiev.

In February 1942, StÃ¼lpnagel was made German-occupied France&#x27;s military commander, in succession to his cousin, Gen. Otto von StÃ¼lpnagel. In this position, he, along with his personal adviser Lieutenant-Colonel Caesar von Hofacker, continued to maintain contact with other members of the conspiracy against Hitler.

===War crimes===
Substantial archival evidence indicates that during his tenure as commander of the 17th Army and military governor of France, StÃ¼lpnagel was involved in war crimes. According to Richard J. Evans, he ordered that future reprisals for French Resistance activities would be mass arrests and deportations of Jews. Following an attack on German soldiers, StÃ¼lpnagel ordered the arrest of 743 Jews, mostly French and had them interned at a German-run camp at CompiÃ¨gne; another 369 Jewish prisoners were deported to Auschwitz in March 1942. In the Soviet Union, StÃ¼lpnagel signed many orders authorizing reprisals against civilians for partisan attacks and closely collaborated with the Einsatzgruppen in their mass executions of Jews. He admonished his soldiers not for the murder of civilian population but for chaotic means in which it was undertaken, particularly early premature taking hostages and random measures. He ordered his troops to focus on Jews and Communist civilians, remarking that Communists were Jews that needed capture anyways.

===20 July plot===
On the day in question, 20 July 1944, StÃ¼lpnagel put his part of the plot into operation. This mainly involved having Hans Otfried von Linstow, who was only informed of the plot on that same day, round up all SS and Gestapo officers in Paris and imprison them. However, when it became apparent that the assassination attempt in East Prussia had failed, StÃ¼lpnagel was unable to convince Field Marshal GÃ¼nther von Kluge to support the uprising and was forced to release his prisoners. When StÃ¼lpnagel was recalled from Paris, he stopped at Verdun and tried to kill himself by shooting himself in the head with a pistol on the banks of the Meuse River. He only succeeded in blinding himself, and in the aftermath he was heard muttering repeatedly in delirium &quot;Rommel&quot;, making himself the first to implicate the Field Marshal named as a party to the plot, leading ultimately to the latter&#x27;s forced suicide.

StÃ¼lpnagel and his adviser were both arrested by the Gestapo, and StÃ¼lpnagel was brought before the &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot; (People&#x27;s Court) on 30 August 1944 where he was berated by Roland Freisler. He was found guilty of high treason and hanged the same day at PlÃ¶tzensee Prison in Berlin.

<doc id="804098" wikidata="Q6934415" url="?curid=804098" title="Multi-Use Radio Service">
<text>In the United States, the Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS) is a licensed by rule (i.e. under part 95, subpart J, of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations) two-way radio service similar to the Citizens band (CB). Established by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in the fall of 2000, MURS created a radio service allowing for licensed by rule (Part 95) operation in a narrow selection of the VHF band, with a power limit of 2 watts. The FCC formally defines MURS as &quot;a private, two-way, short-distance voice or data communications service for personal or business activities of the general public.&quot; MURS stations may not be connected to the public telephone network, may not be used for store and forward operations, and radio repeaters are not permitted.

In 2009, Industry Canada (IC) established a five-year transition plan, which would have permitted the use of MURS in Canada starting June 2014. In August 2014 IC announced a deferral of MURS introduction, as &quot;the Department does not feel that the introduction of MURS devices in Canada is warranted at this time, and has decided to defer the introduction of MURS devices in Canada until a clearer indication of actual need is provided by Canadian MURS advocates and/or stakeholdersÂ ...&quot;

== Eligibility ==
No licenses are required or issued for MURS within the United States.
:Any person is authorized to use the MURS frequencies given that it:
:* Is not a foreign government or a representative of a foreign government.
:* Uses the transmitter in accordance with 47 CFR. 95.1309.
:* Operates in accordance with the rules contained in Sections 95.1301-95.1309.
:* Operates only legal, type-accepted MURS equipment.

== Frequencies ==
MURS comprises the following five frequencies:

Channels 1â3 must use &quot;narrowband&quot; frequency modulation (2.5Â kHz deviation; 11.25Â kHz bandwidth). Channels 4 and 5 may use either &quot;wideband&quot; FM (5Â kHz deviation; 20Â kHz bandwidth) or &quot;narrowband&quot; FM. All five channels may use amplitude modulation with a bandwidth up to 8Â kHz. MURS falls under part 95 and was not mandated for narrow-banding, such as those of Part 90 in the public service bands by January 2013.

Because previous business band licensees who have maintained their active license remain grandfathered with their existing operating privileges, it is possible to find repeaters or other operations not authorized by Part 95 taking place. These are not necessarily illegal. If legal, such operations may enjoy primary status on their licensed frequency and as such are legally protected from harmful interference by MURS users.
==Range==
MURS range will vary, depending on antenna size and placement. With an external antenna, ranges of or more can be expected. Since MURS radios use frequencies in the VHF business band, they are subject to obstructions in line of sight, which includes the curvature of the Earth. The higher you can place the antennas on both transmit and receive sides (within legal limits), the further you can transmit and receive. Some antenna manufacturers claim an external antenna can increase the effective radiated power of a transmitter by a factor of 4. 

==Authorized modes==
==Permitted areas of operation==
MURS operation is authorized anywhere a CB radio station is authorized and within or over any area of the world where radio services are regulated by the FCC. Those areas are within the territorial limits of:
* The fifty United States
* The District of Columbia
* American Samoa (seven islands)
* Baker Island
* Caribbean Insular areas
* Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands
* Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
* Guam Island
* Howland Island
* Jarvis Island
* Johnston Atoll (Islets East, Johnston, North and Sand)
* Kingman Reef
* Midway Atoll (Islets Eastern and Sand)
* Navassa Island
* Pacific Insular areas
* Palmyra Atoll (more than fifty islets)
* United States Virgin Islands (50 islets and cays)
* Wake Island
* Aboard any vessel of the United States, with the permission of the captain, while the vessel is traveling either domestically or in international waters

==Restrictions==
* Transmitter power output is limited to 2 watts.
* The highest point of any MURS antenna must not be more than above the ground or above the highest point of the structure to which it is mounted, whichever is higher.
* Transmitting on MURS frequencies is not allowed while aboard aircraft in flight.
* Devices that use MURS must be specially labeled and certified.

==Products==
There are a wide variety of radio products that use MURS frequencies. MURS devices include wireless base station intercoms, handheld two-way radios, wireless dog training collars, wireless public address units, customer service callboxes, wireless remote switches, and wireless callboxes with or without gate opening ability.

Since MURS uses standard frequencies, most devices that use MURS are compatible with each other.

Most analog two-way radios utilize a technology called CTCSS or DCS that helps block out unwanted transmissions. To make MURS two-way radios work together, they must have matching CTCSS or DCS tones. This can usually be done via basic programming which almost all MURS two-way radios support.

The goTenna, a digital radio product, operates on the MURS band and pairs with smartphones to enable users to send texts and share locations on a peer-to-peer basis. goTenna is not interoperable with other MURS devices, even though they operate on the same spectrum, employing &quot;listen-before-talk&quot; to reduce interference in the band&#x27;s five channels.

==Notable users==
According to Bill Fawcett&#x27;s Spaniel Journal, Spaniel pro-handler Dan Langhans was given a set of VHF business-band radios on the frequency of 154.57Â MHz which became known by the trade as &quot;blue dot&quot; radios.

Costco Wholesale use Motorola DTR600, DLR1020, and Motorola Curve on Frequency 1 for general use among employees and Frequency 2 for communication with major sales departments. Walmart and Sam&#x27;s Club use a Motorola Solutions model Motorola RDM2070D, which is exclusive to Walmart and Sam&#x27;s Club. The Motorola RDM2070D is preprogrammed on MURS frequencies with most channels using CTCSS tone 21/4Z/136.5Hz.

<text>Anselmo Lorenzo Asperilla (21 April 1841 â 30 November 1914) was a defining figure in the early Spanish Anarchist movement, earning the often quoted sobriquet &quot;the grandfather of Spanish anarchism,&quot; in the words of Murray Bookchin: &quot;his contribution to the spread of Anarchist ideas in Barcelona and Andalusia over the decades was enormous&quot;.

His activity in the movement and adherence to Anarchist ideals can be rooted to his meeting and befriending of Giuseppe Fanelli in 1868, a disciple of Mikhail Bakunin recruiting for the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association. He would later become the subject of Lorenzo&#x27;s works, along with TomÃ¡s GonzÃ¡lez Morago, who an account considered the first Spanish Anarchist.

Paul Lafargue recruited Lorenzo and other Madrilenian printers (such as Pablo Iglesias and Jose Mesa) for the Spanish Regional Federation of the IWA. This association with Lafargue, a son-in-law of Karl Marx, led to the founding of the Madrid Internationalist paper called &quot;La Emancipacion&quot;, which promoted Marxist ideology. Lorenzo was listed as one of the delegates representing the Spanish Marxists in the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (IWMA) London Congress in 1864.

Lorenzo edited the anarchist syndicalist newspaper &quot;La Huelga General&quot; from 1901 to 1902 with Francisco Ferrer. He died on 30 November 1914 and was buried in the Cemetery of MontjuÃ¯c.

<text>Acton Main Line is a railway station on the Great Western Main Line in Acton, west London, England. Located down the line from between Paddington and Ealing Broadway stations. The station is served and managed by the Elizabeth line. The station was rebuilt with step-free access as part of the Crossrail project. It is in fare zone 3.

==History==
The Great Western Main Line opened through Acton in 1838; however, the Great Western Railway (GWR) was initially focused on long distance traffic. The station was opened by the GWR on 1 February 1868. Originally simply named Acton, it was operated by the Western Region of British Railways following nationalisation in 1948. On 26 September 1949 it was renamed Acton Main Line. When sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Railways in 1994.

Together with the underground stations at West Acton and North Acton, Acton Main Line serves the GWR garden estate. This large area of family housing, bordered on three sides by the stations named and on the fourth side by the A40 road, was developed by GWR in the 1920s to accommodate its staff, particularly drivers from the Old Oak Common depot.

By 1947 the station had four platforms, all partially covered along their length by wooden canopies, as well as a siding next to platform 1. Both platform 1 and its siding were removed in the late 1960s, although remaining platforms 2, 3 and 4 retained their numbering. The Victorian station building was demolished and replaced with a small booking office in 1974, and platform canopies were dismantled. Platform 1&#x27;s permanent way is still intact, and is used as a fast through line for non-stopping trains; all non-local trains on the Great Western Main Line pass through the station. The frequency of trains was reduced in the 1960s to a peak hour only service.

In the 1990s, the Great Western Main Line was electrified through Acton Main Line as part of the Heathrow Express project. A new station building was completed in early 1996, during extensive renovation of the adjacent bridge on Horn Lane. In 2004, a cut in the number of services to two trains per hour by First Great Western Link was criticised by local residents, who called for the station to be served by Crossrail services. In 2008, Oyster pay as you go became available for passengers at the station.

=== Acton Yard ===

The Great Western Railway built a large freight marshalling yard adjacent to the station in the late nineteenth century. It was one of a series of such yards on the perimeter of London used for the transfer of freight between railways. The yard continues in use but on a much reduced scale.

=== Crossrail ===
Acton Main Line was first proposed to be part of the Crossrail project in the 1990s. In 2003, initial public consultation proposed that no Crossrail services would stop at the station. In 2004, it was proposed that services would call at the station seven days a week, but no stations improvements were planned. The number of seats available into central London from the station would double, due to longer and more frequent trains. Following criticism, it was announced in 2005 that a new station building and step free access would be built as part of the project.

In May 2011, Network Rail announced that it would deliver improvements and alterations to prepare the station for Crossrail services. In 2016, the station design was completed, and submitted to Ealing Council for approval. The work would include a new station building designed by Bennetts Associates with level access from Horn Lane, platform extensions, new platform canopies and step-free access to all platforms. Outside the station, improvements funded by Transport for London and Ealing Borough Council would include a new roundabout with zebra crossings, widened pavements, street trees and covered cycle parking.

In mid-2013 a gated barrier was built along the entire length of platforms 2 and 3, protecting passengers from the fast lines. In June 2017, it was announced that completion of the station was delayed until 2019. In December 2017, MTR Crossrail took over management of the station from Great Western Railway, with TfL Rail services running from May 2018 in preparation for the full operation of the Elizabeth line. In 2019, contracts for the new station building were awarded, allowing construction of the new station building to proceed.

Following delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the refurbished station opened on 18 March 2021, providing step free access to all platforms.

== Passenger volume ==
==Services==
All services at Acton Main Line are operated by the Elizabeth line using EMUs.

As of the May 2023 timetable, the typical Monday to Friday off-peak service is:
*4 tph (trains per hour) westbound to Heathrow Terminal 4
*4 tph eastbound to Abbey Wood

A Sunday service was introduced at the station in May 2019. Prior to this, the station was closed on Sundays.

In December 2023, two more peak services into Abbey Wood from Reading started stopping at this station.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 260, 266, 440 and night route N266 serve the station.

<doc id="804115" wikidata="Q136702" url="?curid=804115" title="Streptosolen">
<text>Streptosolen is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Solanaceae. It is closely related to the genus Browallia, within which it was originally placed. The single species, Streptosolen jamesonii, the marmalade bush or fire bush, is an evergreen shrub bearing loose clusters of flowers which change gradually from yellow to red as they develop, resulting in an overall appearance resembling orange marmalade (whence the name), found in open woodlands in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru. The plant has become naturalized in certain localities in Hawaii.

The red colouration (at maturity) of the flowers of &quot;Streptosolen jamesonii&quot; is typical of that of bird-pollinated flowers, as also is their lack of a strong scent and secretion of a great deal of nectar. The iridescent green hummingbird species &quot;Chlorostilbon poortmani&quot;, the short-tailed emerald, is a frequent visitor to the flowers of &quot;Streptosolen jamesonii&quot;, pollinating them as it hovers to sip their nectar.
==Names==
In its native Ecuador, the plant has the Spanish common names flor de quinde (&#x27;hummingbird flower&#x27;), flor del sol (&#x27;flower of the sun&#x27;) and jaboncillo (&#x27;little soap&#x27;). Note: the South American Spanish word &quot;quinde&quot; (&quot;hummingbird&quot;) is derived from the Quechua word &quot;quindi&quot;, having the same meaning. The word passed into Spanish because there was no pre-existing Spanish word for a family of birds found only in the New World.

Hunziker (2001) gives the further common names for the plant in Ecuador nacha, agua de oro (&#x27;water of gold&#x27;), and guizcho de bosque.

Two other English vernacular names sometimes applied to the shrub are Orange Browallia and Yellow Heliotrope shrub

==Description==
Straggling, evergreen, shrub, clothed in rough, short hairs, 1.5â2Â m in height, densely branched, bearing abundant glandular trichomes. Stems generally tall and slender. Leaves ovate to elliptic, petiolate, subcoriaceous, green to dark green, with a pattern of fine wrinkles, lower surfaces of blades with prominent nerves, the upper surface lacking stomata. 

Flowers borne in subcorymbose cymes; pedicels 5â16Â mm long; calyx tubular, zygomorphic, netted with nerves, 8â10Â mm long, 4â5-toothed, teeth unequal and shorter than tube; corolla funnel-shaped, zygomorphic, 20â30Â mm long, golden-yellow, maturing to golden-reddish, tube slender, spirally contorted, not ventricose, limb rather narrow, up to 18Â mm, somewhat slanted, 5-lobed, lobes broad and very short, apiculate or emarginate; the four stamens (the anterior one missing) with piliferous filaments, the upper lateral pair with short filaments (circa 3Â mm long) and smaller anthers attached at the upper two thirds or three quarters of the corolla, the lower posterior pair with long filaments (circa 12Â mm long), attached near the basal quarter of the corolla, and with bigger anthers (2.5 x 1.8Â mm); pollen grains oblate-sphaeroidal, medium-sized; nectary annular, thick. Seed capsules globose, ovate, circa 5mm long, bearing 60â80 seeds. Seeds 0.6â0.9âmm long, cuboidal-elongated, testa reticulate.

The blooms can appear nearly all year in mild-winter areas, but the heaviest flowering is from February to July.

The corolla has been described as &#x27;essentially upside-down&#x27; (due to the twisted nature of the corolla tube - that gives the genus its name) by botanists from the Natural History Museum, London.

===Influence of flower colour and nectar secretion on pollination===
&quot;Streptosolen jamesonii&quot; flowers profusely over a period of several weeks and produces nectar in abundance. Nectar secretion commences around the time the flower opens and continues for about three days. Anther dehiscence coincides with the beginning of [ nectar ] secretion. As the flower matures, its colour changes from yellow through orange to scarlet. The age of the flower can be estimated quite accurately from the colour and diameter of the flower [ corolla ]...Nectar accumulates in the corolla tube. - R. W. Shuel
Shuel described a gradual color change from yellow through orange to scarlet as flowers mature, allowing the pollinator to accurately estimate the age and possible nectar content of the flower. - Martin von Arx

==Taxonomy==

The genus name &quot;Streptosolen&quot; is a compound of the Greek ÏÏÏÎµÏÏÏÏ (&quot;streptos&quot;) &#x27;twisted&#x27; and ÏÎ¿Î»ÎµÎ½ (&quot;solen&quot;) &#x27;tube&#x27; - from the somewhat twisted structure of the corolla of the flower - hence &quot;twisted-tube(d flower)&quot;. The specific name &quot;jamesonii&quot; commemorates Scottish-Ecuadorian botanist William Jameson, Professor of Chemistry and Botany at the Universidad Central del Ecuador, Quito, compiler of a pioneering (but, sadly, unfinished - due to his demise) &quot;Flora of Ecuador&quot;.
The binomial &quot;Streptosolen jamesonii&quot; was published by English botanist John Miers in the &quot;Journal of Natural History&quot; (entitled the &quot;Annals and Magazine of Natural History&quot; from 1841 until 1967) in the year 1850.

==Horticultural merit==
In the UK this plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. With a minimum temperature of , this plant must be overwintered indoors in frost-prone areas.
For the opportunity of figuring this very interesting plant we are indebted to Messrs. Veitch and Son, by whom it was lately introduced, and in whose nursery it was blooming profusely in June, 1848.
It is a native of the north of Peru, and was found by their collector, Mr. William Lobb, growing at an elevation of 6,000 feet, in woods near Molitre, in the province of Cuenca, which lies inland from the gulf of Guayaquil; he describes it as a shrubby plant two or three feet in height.

Thus, Sir Joseph Paxton in volume 16 of &quot;Paxton&#x27;s Magazine of Botany...&quot; in which he demonstrates a measure of confusion regarding the locality in which Lobb collected &quot;S. jamesonii&quot; - not least as to the country involved, which was Ecuador, not Peru - a fact which may be established from a) the proximity to the Gulf of Guayaquil b) the reference to Cuenca (there is both a city and a canton of Cuenca in Ecuador, but not in Peru) and c) that there is no place name &quot;Molitre&quot; in South America, but there is a canton named Salitre in the region of southern Ecuador suggested by the other evidence presented by Paxton.

==Folk medicinal==
;Ecuador
The plant is but one of as many as 71 different medicinal plant species, from 33 different plant families, used in the preparation of Ecuadorian Horchata, a tonic drunk to improve physical and spiritual well-being in Ecuadorian folk medicine. The word &quot;horchata&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;hordeum&quot; (= barley) and refers to a very varied array of soft drinks consumed in Spain and Latin America, perhaps the best-known being &quot;horchata de chufas&quot; (tiger nut &#x27;milk&#x27;). The very different, medicinal, Ecuadorian form of horchata is most popular in the south of the country and more especially in the province of Loja. Rios et al. (2017) list &quot;Streptosolen jamesonii&quot; as being included among the herbs used to prepare the tonic drink because of its alleged anti-inflammatory properties.

;Peru

In the district of Ayabaca in the Piura Region in the northern Peruvian Andes, &quot;S. jamesonii&quot; - known locally by the name &quot;San Juan&quot; (=&quot;Saint John&quot;) - is used as a pediatric anthelmintic. A whole-plant decoction is prepared by boiling approximately 20g of plant material in a litre of water for thirty minutes. This must be drunk on an empty stomach to kill or stun the worms, followed by the taking of a purge - usually &quot;Huaminga&quot; - to cause the expulsion of the parasites from the bowels. &quot;Huaminga&quot; is a local vernacular name for a species of club-moss belonging to the genus Huperzia. If about 50 g of the whole plant of this species is ground and boiled in a litre of water, until the volume is reduced to 250ml, a cupful of resulting decoction, consumed after cooling, acts a drastic purgative. &quot;Huaminga&quot; is said also to be an anthelmintic in its own right, when prepared as a less concentrated decoction and consumed over a period of several days.

[Note : by an oversight, De Feo (2003) lists an &#x27;S. jamesonii&#x27; under the heading &quot;Solanum&quot;. While there IS a binomial &quot;Solanum jamesonii&quot;, it is likely that the genus De Feo intends is &quot;Streptosolen&quot; rather than &quot;Solanum&quot;, as the authors of the name &quot;S. jamesonii&quot; are given by De Feo as &quot;(Benth.) Miers&quot; (Ã  la &quot;Streptosolen&quot;) and not &quot;Bitter&quot; (the binomial &quot; Solanum jamesonii&quot; is a synonym of &quot;Solanum oblongifolium&quot; .)]

==Chemistry==
&quot;Streptosolen jamesonii&quot; has been found to contain alkaloids which are also present in various &quot;Nicotiana&quot; species and also in &quot;Salpiglossis sinuata&quot;: nornicotine (principal alkaloid), nicotine and anabasine.

Nornicotine has been found to have effects that are initially depressant and subsequently stimulant. It also increases intestinal motility through overall parasympathetic stimulation of the GI tract, which, in combination with its toxicity to parasitic worms, could account for the use of Streptosolen as an anthelmintic. Furthermore, the observation by Ecuadorian cattle-herders of their cattle&#x27;s possible self-medication by consumption of Streptosolen foliage would have led to the realization that the plant was non-toxic enough to be used as emergency cattle fodder (see above) and could even have the positive benefit of ridding the animals of parasitic worms (re. observation of increased worm-burden in cattle dung).

Anabasine is the active principle responsible for deaths from poisoning caused by the leaves of &quot;Nicotiana glauca&quot;, the Tree Tobacco. The alkaloid anabasine, a close structural relative of nicotine, is named for the plant from which it was first isolated: the toxic Central Asian plant &quot;Anabasis aphylla&quot;. Recently, anabasine-related alkaloids have also been isolated from the venom of an ant belonging to the genus Aphaenogaster and a marine nematode worm. Anabasine sulphate was a widely used botanical insecticide in the former Soviet Union until the 1970s.

&quot;Streptosolen jamesonii&quot; (common name &quot;Guizcho del bosque&quot;) &#x27;Can be used as an emergency food for cattle when the pasture is bad&#x27;.

[Note : the author does not give a translation of Ecuadorian Spanish word &quot;guizcho&quot;, which also forms an element in the vernacular name of another wild plant : &quot;Guizcho alto&quot; i.e. &#x27;Tall guizcho&#x27;, which is listed by Camp et al. (1987) as the name of the species known formerly as &quot;Malvastrum scoparium&quot;, but now as &quot;Malvastrum tomentosum&quot; (family Malvaceae). The name &quot;Guizcho del bosque&quot;, by contrast, means &#x27;Guizcho of the forest&#x27;].

[Note: the use of the plant as cattle fodder, as a pediatric anthelmintic, and as a constituent of a folk-medicinal tonic (as listed above) suggests that the concentrations of toxic alkaloids in the plant are unlikely to be high - otherwise cases of accidental poisoning would be reported more frequently in the literature.]

==Toxicity==
The California Poison Control System assigns a code number &#x27;4&#x27; to the plant, a rating of 4 being assigned to plant species that constitute a major health risk, if consumed - especially in large amounts - with a likely risk of causing serious effects to the heart, liver, kidneys or brain.
Available accounts of the toxicity of &quot;Streptosolen jamesonii&quot; tend to be somewhat vague, hingeing upon its membership of a plant family noted for its many toxic species, rather than upon any well-documented cases of poisoning.

<doc id="804119" wikidata="Q3935743" url="?curid=804119" title="Right Thurr">
<text>&quot;Right Thurr&quot; is the debut single of American rapper Chingy. Written alongside The Trak Starz. It was released on April 14, 2003, by Capitol Records, Priority Records, and Disturbing tha Peace as the lead single from his debut album, &quot;Jackpot&quot; (2003). The song received positive reviews from critics, who praised the production and Chingy&#x27;s addictive delivery.

&quot;Right Thurr&quot; stayed at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, giving Chingy his first of three top-five hits on that chart. It also became a number-one hit on the Hot Rap Songs chart for four weeks and peaked at numbers two and five on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and Mainstream Top 40 charts, respectively. The song reached number one in New Zealand and peaked within the top 20 in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the United Kingdom. It was certified gold in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.

An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Jessy Terrero, takes place in Chingy&#x27;s birthplace of St. Louis. An official remix for the song was made as a bonus track on the album that featured rappers Jermaine Dupri and Trina. A music video for the remix, directed by Jeremy Rall, features all three artists dancing on an all-white backdrop.

==Critical reception==
Matt Cibula of &quot;PopMatters&quot; liked Chingy&#x27;s choice of playing a pimp-like character for the song, saying &quot;thereâs something to his voice, a certain awed respect for the absolutely amazing qualities of southern women, that puts the song over the top.&quot; Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic called it an &quot;instant party rap classic&quot;. John Mulvey of &quot;NME&quot; gave a mixed review of the song, noticing the imitation Neptunes beat from the Trak Starz and Chingy&#x27;s limitation as a rapper, but still found it to be &quot;utterly irresistible&quot; concluding that &quot;It&#x27;s all terribly Dirty South, as you&#x27;d imagine, but Chingy&#x27;s soft and compelling way with the letter &#x27;r&#x27; is weirdly Devonian, too. Which isn&#x27;t something you can say about most potty-mouthed hip-hop prodigies these days. Nice wurrk.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Right Thurr&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 the week of May 17, 2003, at number 97. Six weeks later, it moved ten spots from number 31 to 21 the week of June 28, 2003. It moved six spots to number 15 the week of July 5, 2003. It entered the top 10 on the week of July 12, 2003, by moving six spots to number nine. It reached the top five by moving five spots to number four the week of July 19, 2003. It peaked at number two for five non-consecutive weeks, starting on the week of August 9, 2003. It stayed on the chart for thirty-three weeks.

==Music video==
Directed by Jessy Terrero, the video takes place at Beacon Ave. in Walnut Park East, St. Louis where Chingy is with his friends outside the porch of his house and is attracted by several women walking past his house. It moves to a club run where DJ Quik DJs, where Chingy is performing on stage and partying with his friends while throwing money in the air, and at Courtesy Diner where Chingy is hanging out inside and outside of the diner. It ends with a late-night shot of the Gateway Arch intercut with fade shots of Chingy at the club. Ludacris, Murphy Lee, Kyjuan, The Trak Starz and Tity Boi make cameo appearances in the video.

An uncut version of the video featured extended scenes from the club of various women in bras and thongs doing suggestive dances on the people and/or each other. It was only shown at late-night on &quot;&quot; and on the enhanced CD/DVD version of the album.

==Live performance==
Chingy made his US television debut performing &quot;Right Thurr&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on July 17, 2003.

==Remix==

An official remix for the song was made as a bonus track on the album that featured rappers Jermaine Dupri and Trina. A video (found in the CD/DVD version of the album) was made for the remix that featured all three artists on an all white backdrop dancing together with people around them. The video was directed by Jeremy Rall. This version won the &quot;Remix of the Year&quot; award at the 2004 Source Awards.

<doc id="804123" wikidata="Q1025115" url="?curid=804123" title="Marble Bar, Western Australia">
<text>Marble Bar is a town and rock formation in the Pilbara region of north-western Western Australia. It was the social centre of European settlers in the Pilbara region during the early 1900s, predating the construction of other towns now established.

The town is additionally noted for its extremely hot climate, having a mean maximum temperature second in Australia only to Wyndham.

It has also been noted for some palaeontological findings in its surroundings. Fossilised stromatolites found nearby (one of the earliest forms of life on Earth) have been dated to the Paleoarchean era approximately 3.5 billion years ago.

==History==
Marble Bar has been described as &quot;the centre of the Pilbara back in the early 1900s&quot;. The town predates Port Hedland, Newman, and Karratha.

It was gazetted in 1893 following the discovery of gold in the area in 1890 by a prospector named Francis Jenkins who is remembered by the name of the town&#x27;s main street. The name Marble Bar was derived from a nearby jasper bar mistaken for marble and now known as Marble Bar, which runs across the bed of the Coongan River.

In 1891 the town boasted a population in excess of 5,000 as it experienced a rush on the goldfields. Several large gold nuggets were discovered as a result of the goldrush. The 333 ounce Little Hero nugget, the 413 ounce Bobby Dazzler and the 332 ounce General Gordon nugget were all found in the goldfields around the town.

By 1895 the town had its Government offices built; these are now National Trust buildings. Cut from local stone, the buildings still stand today. The town&#x27;s Ironclad Hotel was built in the 1890s, and has been listed on the Western Australian register of heritage places since 2006. It is constructed of corrugated iron, and was given its name by American miners who were reminded of the Ironclad ships from the United States.

A Telegraph line was proposed during discussion of the Estimates in January 1893 to link Condon to Marble Bar. After approval, many basic administrative errors delayed or interrupted construction of the line to an area in which very significant gold finds were being mined. These mines needed communication with other centres â including to England. Finally the line was completed at the end of July 1894 - to the satisfaction of an increasingly irate community. A Post and Telegraph Office was opened on 25 August 1894.

During World War II, United States Army Air Forces and Royal Australian Air Force heavy bombers were based away as the crow flies at Corunna Downs Airfield. Allied airmen from the base attacked Japanese forces as far away as Borneo.

The Port Hedland to Marble Bar Railway opened on 15 July 1911, costing around Â£300,000 to build. Due to low traffic and high financial losses, the railway closed from 31 May 1951. This railway could be seen as a narrow gauge precursor to the network of standard gauge iron-ore railways that have since been created across the Pilbara.

==Climate ==
Marble Bar has a hot desert climate (KÃ¶ppen &quot;BWh&quot;) with sweltering summers and warm winters. Most of the annual rainfall occurs in the summer. The town set a world record of most consecutive days at or above : 160 days from 31 October 1923 to 7 April 1924. Although annual temperatures indicate Marble Bar should be within the tropics, with a July (winter) mean of , it does not have the high precipitation requirements for hot-weather climates to sustain tropical vegetation.

During December and January, temperatures in excess of are common, and the average maximum temperature exceeds normal human body temperature for six months each year. Marble Bar receives 159.6 clear days annually. Dewpoint in the summers is between . In contrast to most of the year, winters are warm, with days averaging , low humidity and clear skies. Nights from June to August can be chilly, occasionally as low as but frost is unknown. Even in mid winter however, brief bursts of heat can result in the temperature rising as high as for a few days before dropping back to normal.

Rainfall is sparse and erratic, though variability is significantly less extreme than over the coastal Pilbara â the tenth percentile being vis-Ã -vis only in Onslow. It falls largely between December and March, with occasional rain events from autumn northwest cloudbands up to June. As little as can fall in a year; however, during heavy wet seasons when the monsoon reaches well south into the Pilbara, the rainfall can be significantly more â as much as fell between April 1999 and March 2000, and fell in 1980 owing to several tropical cyclones. The most rain recorded in a month is in March 2007, and the most in one day on 2 March 1941.

Fossilised stromatolites, found near Marble Bar, are one of the earliest forms of life on Earth, dating to 3.5 billion years ago during the Paleoarchean era, when at that time oxygen produced aerobic organisms.

A location nearby is known as &quot;North Pole&quot; (21Â° 05&#x27; S. 119Â° 22&#x27; E.). The location&#x27;s rock formations contain stromatolites in particular rock sequences, which some scientists have considered evidence that puts the origin of life on earth back to 3,400â3,500 million years ago.

This has been a subject of long scientific debate. The biologic explanation has been disputed with the argument that stromatolites older than 3,200 mya are not the result of living organisms (the definition of stromatolites includes both living and abiotic causes), the small conical structures in the Strelley Pool formation (Warrawoona Group) being formed by evaporation and a dome structure from the North Pole chert (also Warrawoona Group) being formed by soft-sediment deformation.

Research by Abigail Allwood on the geology of the North Pole stromatolite reef appears to confirm the biologic origins of patterns in the formation. Continuing support for their geologic origin, following the 2006 publication of her team&#x27;s results in &quot;Nature&quot; led to further investigations and Allwood&#x27;s development of the PIXL technology at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, for use in confirming her earlier conclusions. Use of PIXL, together with the insight gained into the organic processes that can build geologic formations, are key components of the Mars 2020 Mission.

<text>Yaesu is a Japanese brand of amateur radio equipment, founded as in 1959 by a Japanese radio amateur Sako Hasegawa (call sign JA1MP) in Yaesu, Japan, a district of Tokyo.

== History ==
Yaesu had initially been formed with the intention to develop and manufacture commercial and amateur radio transceivers for the Japanese market, but only five years after its formation the company had signed foreign sales agreements for export to Australia and Germany.

In Europe, the equipment was sold under the Yaesu brand and the Sommerkamp brand. In 1963 the Swiss firm Sommerkamp imported Yaesu equipment and sold it using their own brand.

Yaesu&#x27;s line of equipment was first imported into the US by Spectronics, Inc. located in Signal Hill, California, in 1965. Yaesu became an important presence in the U.S. amateur radio market with the introduction and improvement of its very popular FT-101 line of equipment in the 1970s. In addition, transceiver manufacture was outsourced to Henry Radio in Los Angeles. 

Sako Hasegawa died in 1993. Following his death, Jun Hasegawa took over as managing director.

Yaesu Musen acquired the STANDARD radio equipment brand from Marantz Japan in 1998 and changed the company name to in 2000. In 2007, Motorola announced its intention to purchase 80% of Vertex Standard and form a joint venture with Tokogiken (a privately held Japanese
company controlled by Jun Hasegawa), which would hold the other 20%. This deal was completed in January 2008. The joint venture was dissolved effective January 1, 2012. The Vertex Standard land mobile division operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The Amateur Radio, Airband and Marine Radio business was transferred to the new company &quot;Yaesu Musen&quot;.

== Digimode &quot;Fusion&quot; ==

In 2013, YAESU launched its own digital mode of operation for amateur radio: &quot;System Fusion&quot;. Like other digital modes, Fusion utilize a narrower radio bandwidth. With System Fusion, special attention was paid to compatibility with analog
FM radio. This was intended to simplify migration of the existing amateur radio repeaters from analog to digital technology.

In the early 2000s, minimum-shift keying (GMSK) technology emerged in the amateur radio market as the dominant digital mode. In 2013 Yaesu introduced âSystem Fusion,â new technology utilizing C4FM 4-level FSK technology for transmitting digital voice data. The System Fusion communication protocol enables devices to analyze an incoming signal and automatically determine if it is using C4FM or conventional FM mode. System Fusion also enables data transfer at full rate with speeds reaching up to 9,600 bits per second.

Yaesu is the only company with System Fusion-enabled devices. ICOM, alongside the Japan Amateur Radio League has developed devices using the D-STAR protocol. Other brands use DMR, among other modes.

==Products==
Yaesu has manufactured a number of devices listed in Yaesu radio transceivers throughout its history. The focus is still on amateur radio transceivers.

<doc id="804126" wikidata="Q1918500" url="?curid=804126" title="Ascended master">
<text>Ascended masters, also known as Mahatmas, are believed in several theosophical and related spiritual traditions to be spiritually enlightened beings who in past incarnations were ordinary humans. Through a series of spiritual transformations, or initiations, they are said to have achieved a higher state of being. 

Although the terms &quot;mahatma&quot; and &quot;ascended master&quot; are often used synonymously, the Ascended Master Teachings define them differently, associating &quot;ascended master&quot; with a higher level of spiritual attainment, specifically the Sixth Initiation or Ascension. This contrasts with &quot;Masters of Light,&quot; &quot;Healers,&quot; or &quot;Spiritual Masters&quot; who are said to have taken the Fifth Initiation and reside in a fifth dimension. 

The term &quot;ascended master&quot; was first used by Baird T. Spalding in 1924 in his series of books, &quot;Life and Teachings of the Masters of the Far East&quot; (DeVorss and Co.). Godfre Ray King (Guy Ballard) further popularized this concept of spiritual masters who had once lived on the earth in his book &quot;Unveiled Mysteries&quot;.

==Definition==
Adherents of the ascended master Teachings hold that the beliefs surrounding ascended masters were partially released by the Theosophical Society beginning in 1875, by C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey, and began to have more detailed public release in the 1930s by the ascended masters through Guy Ballard in the I AM Activity. However, theosophists maintain that the concept of an ascended master is an exaggeration and corruption of the more modest theosophical concept of &quot;Master of the Ancient Wisdom&quot;.

Guy Ballard said his work &quot;Unveiled Mysteries&quot; was dictated to him by the ascended master St. Germain. Other Ascended Master Teachings are contained in &quot;The Bridge to Freedom&quot; (1951), Mark Prophet and Elizabeth Clare Prophet&#x27;s The Summit Lighthouse (1958) (reorganized as the Church Universal and Triumphant in 1975), The Temple of The Presence (1995), The Hearts Center (2005), the I AM University (2004), and various other organizations such as The White Eagle Lodge (1936) and the Aquarian Christine Church Universal (2006).

Peter Mt. Shasta, who claims to be channeling the ascended master Saint Germain, has been releasing the ancient teachings in a more modern and simplified form, emphasizing the teaching that the masters can work with those who have an open heart and the desire to benefit humanity.

==Beliefs about ascended masters==

The term &quot;ascended master&quot; was first introduced in 1934 by Guy Ballard with the publication of &quot;Unveiled Mysteries&quot;, a book which he said was dictated to him by the ascended master St. Germain. Other Ascended Master Teachings are contained in The Bridge to Freedom (1951), The Summit Lighthouse (1958) (known also as The Church Universal and Triumphant), The Aetherius Society (1955), The Temple of The Presence (1995), the I AM University (2004), the White Eagle Lodge (1936) and the Aquarian Christine Church Universal, Inc. (2006).

In Ascended Master Teachings there is also mention of Serapis Bey, a being who was incarnated as a high priest in one of the &quot;Temples of the Sacred Fire&quot; on Atlantis, and who migrated to Egypt at the time of the destruction of Atlantis. It is also believed that he was incarnated as the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III (who constructed the Temple of Luxor to the god Amon) and also as Leonidas, the King of Sparta, who was killed in 480 BC defending the pass of Thermopylae against the invasion of ancient Greece by Emperor Xerxes I of the Persian Empire.

==Other beliefs about ascended masters==
Belief in the brotherhood and the masters is an essential part of the beliefs of various organizations that have continued and expanded the concepts released in the original Saint Germain instruction in the 1930s through the &quot;I AM&quot; Activity. Examples of those believed by the ones proposing these teachings to be ascended masters would be the Master Jesus, Confucius, Gautama Buddha, Mary the mother of Jesus, St. Paul of Tarsus ( Hilarion), Ashtar Sheran, Sanat Kumara, Melchizedek, Archangel Michael, Metatron, Kwan Yin, St. Germain and Kuthumi.

==Jesus==

Jesus is believed to be one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in Theosophy and is one of the ascended masters in the Ascended Master Teachings. The Master Jesus is regarded by Theosophists as the Master of the Sixth Ray.

It is believed by Ascended Master Teachings organizations that the Master Jesus was &quot;Chohan of the Sixth Ray&quot; until December 31, 1959, when, according to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Lady Master Nada fully took on the Office in the Spiritual Hierarchy in his place. According to Prophet, Jesus became World Teacher, along with Kuthumi, on January 1, 1956, succeeding Maitreya, who took the Office of &quot;Planetary Buddha&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Christ&quot;.

According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Prophet of the Church Universal and Triumphant (the largest Ascended Master Teachings religion), the Master Jesus incarnated twice as the Emperor of Atlantis, once in 33,050 BC and again in 15,000 BC.

According to Alice Bailey, the Master Jesus was previously incarnated as Joshua, the Hebrew military leader in the 13th century BC, and Joshua the High Priest in the sixth century BC.

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Jesus was also incarnated as Joseph of the coat of many colors in the 17th century BC/16th century BC (approximately between 1650 BC and 1550 BC), as well as King David (who lived until around 970 BC), and Elisha in the 9th century BC.

==Sanat Kumara==

According to the post-1900 publications of Theosophy (specifically, the writings of Charles W. Leadbeater, Alice Bailey, and Benjamin Creme, as well as the Ascended Master Teachings of Guy Ballard, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Geraldine Innocente, Joshua David Stone, and other Ascended Master Teachings teachers), Sanat Kumara is an &quot;advanced being&quot; of the Ninth Initiation (the highest initiation possible on planet Earth) who is regarded as the Lord or Regent of Earth and of humanity, and the head of the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth who dwells in Shamballah.

It is believed by these authors that he is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, which consists of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Fifth Initiation), ascended masters (Sixth Initiation), Chohans and Bodhisattvas (Seventh Initiation), Buddhas (Eighth Initiation), and highly spiritually-evolved volunteers from other worlds, who have all joined to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.

Sanat Kumara was mentioned briefly by the theosophist Helena Blavatsky. She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the &quot;Lords of the Flame&quot;, whom Christian tradition have misunderstood as Lucifer and the fallen angels.

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when her follower Charles W. Leadbeater wrote that Sanat Kumara was the &quot;King&quot; or Lord of the World, and the head of the Great White Brotherhood of Mahatmas who had revealed the principles of theosophy.

==Maitreya==
==Initiation==
According to C.W. Leadbeater, Initiation is a process by which &quot;we try to develop ourselves not that we may become great and wise, but that we may have the power and knowledge to work for humanity to the best effect.&quot; According to Alice Bailey, Initiation is the &quot;process of undergoing an expansion of consciousness&quot;

== Periodization ==
=== The fall of man ===
It is believed that since the &quot;fall of man&quot; during the time of the incarnation of the fourth root race, imperfection, limitations and discord increasingly entered into the world. The memory body is considered to have become known as a &quot;soul&quot;, and this temporary personality has taken on the sense of a self that is separated and not connected to God. It is believed that a &quot;Dictation&quot; from Maitreya further clarified this matter through the &quot;Messenger&quot;, Geraldine Innocente, on September 27, 1954, when what occurred during the time of the fourth root race was described:

=== Dawning Golden Age ===
Students of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that this world is destined to again have a Golden Age, a &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot;, that will be permanent, unlike previous Golden Ages millions of years ago.

==The Great White Brotherhood==
The Great White Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophy, are said to be supernatural beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or the Ascended masters. Various people have said they have received messages from these beings, including most notably Helena Blavatsky (Theosophy), Aleister Crowley (Thelema), Alice Bailey (New Group of World Servers), Guy Ballard (&quot;I AM&quot; Activity), Geraldine Innocente (The Bridge to Freedom), Mark L. Prophet &amp; Elizabeth Clare Prophet (Church Universal and Triumphant) and Benjamin Creme (Share International).

The Masters are collectively called the &quot;Great White Brotherhood&quot; by various theosophists and esotericists. The use of the term &quot;white&quot; refers to their advanced spirituality (in other words, that they have a white colored 
aura) and has nothing to do with race. Blavatsky described many of the Masters as ethnically Tibetan or Indian (Hindu), not European. She did, however, describe them as being from all cultures and races, such as the &quot;Greek gentleman&quot; known as Hilarion.

Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the syncretistic teachings of various organizations that have taken the Theosophical philosophical concepts and added their own elements. Examples of those believed to be ascended masters by these organizations are: Jesus, Sanat Kumara, Buddha, Maitreya, Confucius, Lord Lanto (Confucius&#x27; historical mentor), Mary the mother of Jesus, Lady Master Nada, Enoch, Kwan Yin, Saint Germain, and Koot Hoomi (Kuthumi), to name but a few. It is believed that all of these put aside any differences they might have had in their Earthly careers, and unite instead to advance the spiritual well-being of humanity.

==Dictations==
Within &quot;The I AM Activity&quot; (founded by Guy Ballard in the early 1930s), claimed contact and cooperation with the ascended masters became a central part of each member&#x27;s life. Through the Ballards as &quot;messengers&quot;, the ascended masters were believed to have regularly communicated with the students of &quot;The I AM Activity&quot;. These supposed addresses (known as &quot;Dictations&quot;) were delivered before gatherings of members in Conclaves held throughout the United States of America, and published in the monthly periodical &quot;The Voice of The &quot;I AM&quot;&quot;, and some were collected and reprinted in the &quot;green books&quot; of &quot;The Saint Germain Series&quot;. In all, 3,834 claimed Dictations from the Masters were received through Guy and Edna Ballard. Other &quot;Ascended Master Activities&quot; believed that the ascended masters, cosmic beings, Elohim, and Archangels continued to present a program for both individual development and spiritual transformation in the world. They believe that further instruction from the ascended masters and the rest of the spiritual hierarchy continued through new Dispensations with new Messengers, such as the Bridge to Freedom, the Summit Lighthouse, and the Temple of The Presence.

==The Aquarian Church==
The Aquarian Christine Church Universal, Inc. (ACCU) is a denomination founded in 2006 based on &quot;The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ&quot;, said to be transcribed from the Akashic records by Levi H. Dowling. The Aquarian Christine Church actively promotes Ascended Master Teachings and shares many beliefs in common with the I AM Movement, White Eagle Lodge and New Thought and Theosophical groups. The book &quot;Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel&quot; by ACCU founder Jacob L. Watson, expounds on the church&#x27;s teachings which draw heavily from the writings of A.D.K. Luk (pen-name of Alice Beulah Schutz) (1905â1994), the Saint Germain Series published by the Saint Germain Press (The Saint Germain Foundation), and especially from &quot;The Lost Years of Jesus&quot; compiled by Elizabeth Clare Prophet and published by The Summit Lighthouse.

==Criticism==
RenÃ© GuÃ©non wrote a detailed critique of Theosophy titled &quot;Theosophy: history of a pseudo-religion&quot; (1921). In the book Guenon speculated that Blavatsky had acquired all her knowledge naturally from other books not from any supernatural masters. Guenon points out that Blavatsky spent a long time visiting a library at New York where she had easy access to the works of Jacob Boehme, Eliphas Levi, the Kabbalah and other Hermetic treatises. Guenon also speculated that Blavatsky had borrowed passages from extracts of the &quot;Kanjur&quot; and &quot;Tanjur&quot;, translated by the eccentric orientalist SÃ¡ndor KÅrÃ¶si Csoma, published in 1836 in the twentieth volume of the &quot;Asiatic Researchers of Calcutta&quot;.

K. Paul Johnson suggests in his book &quot;The Masters Revealed: Madame Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood&quot; that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime.

Robert Todd Carroll in his book &quot;The skeptic&#x27;s dictionary&quot; (2003) speculates that Blavatsky used trickery into deceiving others into thinking she had paranormal powers. Carroll further speculates that Blavatsky had faked a materialization of a tea cup and saucer as well as written the messages from her masters herself. The article &quot;Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements&quot; by Paul Zweig, &quot;New York Times&quot; October 5, 1980, also speculates that Madame Blavatsky&#x27;s revelations were fraudulent.

<text>Tet (formerly Lattelekom and Lattelecom) is a Latvian internet service provider, telecommunications, technology and entertainment company. It has also been an electricity service provider since 2017.

The Tet Group provides IT, telecommunication, and outsourced business process solutions that are provided by the five companies of the group: SIA Tet, Lattelecom BPO, Citrus Solutions, and Lattelecom Technology, along with its subsidiary Baltic Computer Academy (, BDA). Lattelecom Group is a provider of electronic communications services in Latvia and offers electronic communication solutions for home, small and medium-sized businesses, state and municipal institutions, as well as corporate clients.

51% of Tet shares are owned by the Latvian government, but the remaining 49% are owned by the Scandinavian company Telia Company. Tet, in turn, owns 23% of the Latvian mobile operator&#x27;s LMT shares.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
The Latvian state-owned State Company &quot;Tet&quot; () was registered with the Register of Enterprises of the Republic of Latvia on January 9, 1992. Its origins were based on the leftover local infrastructure and services previously operated by the Soviet Ministry of Communications. Nearly two years later, on December 22, 1993, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia approved the commission&#x27;s decision to announce the British and Finnish consortium TILTS Communications as the winner of the tender. On the modernization of Latviaâs telecommunications networkâ, and the company became a strategic investor in Lattelekom. On January 14, 1994, the agreement with TILTS Communications was concluded and SIA Lattelekom was established. As a result of the privatization, 49% of the company&#x27;s shares were procured by two foreign investors, Cable and Wireless and Telecom Finland which later became a part of the Swedish telecommunications company TeliaSonera AB.

Cable and Wireless later sold its shares to TeliaSonera, as a result of which 51% of the company&#x27;s shares are presently owned by the Latvian government but 49% by TeliaSonera. Until January 1, 2003, the company held a monopoly on fixed voice communication services, thereby becoming the leading fixed telephony operator.

==== Monopoly ====
Until relatively recently, Lattelecom had monopoly rights on fixed-line voice communications in Latvia, which ended on January 1, 2003. The Latvian fixed telecommunications market is now open to competition, but Lattelecom still has an overwhelming share of the market, and the company is also one of the leading internet service providers in Latvia and is one of the owners of Latvijas Mobilais Telefons, Latvia&#x27;s largest cell phone operator.

=== First rebrand (2006) ===
On May 18, 2006, Lattelecom implemented a rebranding, replacing the existing corporate brand name with a new brand name. The change aimed to improve the correlation between the Lattelecom brand name, products and services, and attain higher efficiency of communication and costs and position Lattelecom as a market leader, justifying it with sufficient proof. Prior to 2006, the company had already undergone reorganisation, procuring also a new company (SIA Lattelecom Technology), whereby the change of the brand name marked the termination of said conversion process â the new brand name combined into one great whole all Groups companies that were directly engaged in providing customer services, client business process outsourcing and IT&amp;T and content services.

The official company name, SIA Lattelekom was changed to SIA Lattelecom. The name of the IT service provider SIA Micro Link Latvia was changed to Lattelecom Technology, whereas SIA C1 that had been engaged in business process outsourcing business was renamed SIA Lattelecom BPO. Given the business specifics, the name of the network construction and maintenance company SIA Citrus Solutions remained as is. In addition, Citrus Solutions also attained its individual graphical identity that differs from that of the other Groups companies, as the company provides services to external IT&amp;T companies that are believed to be Lattelecom Group competitors.

=== Second rebrand (2019) ===
In October 2018, Lattelecom announced that they will gradually change their name to &quot;Tet&quot;, their electricity service providers&#x27; name used since 2016, with the change officially starting from on April 1, 2019. All divisions except entertainment which will use the recently introduced &quot;Helio&quot; and Shortcut brands.

== Lattelecom Group ==

Lattelecom Group consists of five companies: SIA &quot;Tet&quot;, SIA &quot;Lattelecom&quot; BPO, SIA &quot;Citrus Solutions&quot;, SIA &quot;Lattelecom Technology&quot; and the subsidiary owned by the latter SIA &quot;Baltijas Datoru AkadÄmija&quot;. Tet is specialised in providing Internet, voice and TV services. Lattelecom BPO offers client service solutions, business process outsourcing (BPO), and 1188 directory inquiry services. Lattelecom Technology provides integrated IT solutions and services. Baltijas Datoru AkadÄmija is a training and certification centre providing services to information and communication technology (ICT) professionals and users, whereas Citrus Solutions that is formed through separating the former Network Maintenance Division from the parent company Tet offers integrated network infrastructure construction and security system solutions.

== Products and services ==

=== Tet Internet ===
Tet is the country&#x27;s largest internet service provider. Tet offers various Internet connection types broadband DSL Internet (ADSL2+ and VDSL), Optical Fiber Internet GPON Internet, wireless solutions or Wi-Fi and 4G internet.

==== Optical fiber Internet ====

In 2009 Lattelecom started offering residential fiber optic services with up to 100 megabits per second high Internet bandwidth. In September 2009 an announcement was made that Lattelecom had upgraded its fiber optic bandwidth up to 1 gigabits per second. ZolitÅ«de was the first residential area in Riga where the Lattelecom fiber optic Internet service was made available (in January 2009), followed later by Kengarags, Purvciems, Plavnieki, Ziepniekkalns and other locations. Jelgava was the first city where fiber optic Internet was made available from areas other than Riga, but late in 2009 the Lattelecom fiber optic service was also made accessible in other cities, such as Daugavpils, Salaspils, etc. Initially, fiber optic network expansion work was carried out in the newly built dwelling areas in Riga and other largest cities of the country the rational being that return on the investment in the development of the network is possible to attain only if the newly connected building has at least 30 apartments.

The service is provided using GPON technology that enables 100 megabits per second bandwidth accessible from any connection point (apartment). In the middle of 2012, Lattelecom fiber optic internet was available to 450,000 households throughout Latvia, which is half of all Latvian households. The total infrastructure covers more than 45 towns and residential areas in Latvia.

==== Baltic Highway ====

A significant data transfer route, the Baltic Highway opened in 2012. It ensures the highest quality data transfer through the Baltic States, Poland and Germany, with an extension to the Russian Federation. The project for the construction of a united optical fiber infrastructure was implemented by Lattelecom, in cooperation with Deutsche Telekom and MegaFon. The Baltic Highway will ensure n*10 Gbps data transfer rate (the initial capacity of the system is 40 x 10Â Gbit/s), and it will be the geographically shortest route between Germany and Russia. The total infrastructure covers more than 45 towns and residential areas in Latvia. The Baltic Highway infrastructure will be an alternative transfer route for the earlier Nordic Route (Russia-Sweden-Germany) and South Route (Russia-Ukraine-Germany) networks.

==== Wi-Fi ====
Currently more than 4,500 Wi-Fi access points are available throughout Latvia.

=== Lattelecom TV ===
In 2011 Lattelecom became the largest TV service provider in the Baltic States, reaching a total of 230,000 charge TV customers subscribing to the company&#x27;s three TV services â Terrestrial television, Interactive television and Internet television.

Since March 1, 2011, the company started to offer Internet TV on mobile devices, for instance, smartphones and tablet computers, thus becoming the first television operator in the Baltic States to enable people to watch television on four types of screens â not only traditional TV sets, but also computers, tablet computers and cell phones.

==== Interactive TV/Tet TV ====
Lattelecom Interactive TV, now known as Tet TV, is a high-definition television service that provides diverse functionality, such as virtual rent a video, time shift, recording of programmes and films, etc. The Interactive TV signal is transmitted over a broadband Internet connection that enables access to both the Internet and TV using a single wire (telephone line).

==== Digital Terrestrial TV/Virszemes Tet TV ====

As of the early part of 2009 and after having won the Ministry of Transport of the Republic of Latvia tender, Lattelecom jointly with the Latvian State Radio and Television Centre (LVRTC) made transition from analogue to digital TV broadcasting system.

Lattelecom Terrestrial TV enabled digital over-the-air broadcasting of TV signals that can be received using an indoor or external aerial. Terrestrial TV provides free access to all national and other free channels of the country.

==== Tet TV+ ====

Online television has been available in Latvia since 2010, when it was made public in test mode. Currently Online television is available in Latvia only.

Internet television on mobile devices has been available since March 2012. It is the first television service in Latvia that enables watching television not only at a time and place convenient to the client, but on various devices â PC, tablet computer and smartphone.

In 2016, Lattelecom launched an online streaming service and an entertainment platform Shortcut.

==Privatisation==

Tet is a former state-owned telecommunications company. In 1994, 49% of the company&#x27;s stock was sold to two foreign investors, Cable and Wireless and Telecom Finland, which is now part of TeliaSonera.

<text>Mario Aerts (born 31 December 1974 in Herentals, Belgium) is a former professional road bicycle racer, who competed between 1996 and 2011. He competed for three teams: Vlaanderen 2002, and the Lotto team through various sponsorships, competing with that particular team for twelve seasons during his career. During this time, he raced in the Tours de France, the Giro d&#x27;Italia, and the Vuelta a EspaÃ±a. In the 2007 cycling season, he finished in these three major stage races in cycling. He was only the 25th racer in the history of cycling to achieve this.

Aerts won the Grand Prix d&#x27;Isbergues in 1996, Circuit Franco Belge in 2001, the Giro della Provincia di Lucca in 2001, and most notably La FlÃ¨che Wallonne in 2002; he did not win a professional race after that. In June 2011, he announced his retirement as a professional cyclist at the end of the year, citing heart problems as the major cause. After retiring he would become an assistant for the team he rode for under its present name: Lotto-Soudal.

<doc id="804145" wikidata="Q2641791" url="?curid=804145" title="1989 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1989 Atlantic hurricane season was an average hurricane season with 11Â named storms. The season officially began on JuneÂ 1, and ended on NovemberÂ 30. The first tropical cyclone, Tropical Depression One, developed on JuneÂ 15, and dissipated two days later without any effects on land. Later that month, Tropical Storm Allison caused severe flooding, especially in Texas and Louisiana. Tropical Storm Barry, Tropical Depressions Six, Nine, and Thirteen, and Hurricanes Erin and Felix caused negligible impact. Hurricane Gabrielle and Tropical Storm Iris caused light effects on land, with the former resulting in nine fatalities from rip currents offshore the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada, while the latter produced minor flooding in the United States Virgin Islands.

The most notable storm of the season was Hurricane Hugo, which became the costliest Atlantic hurricane on record at the time (surpassed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992), causing $11Â billion (1989Â USD) in damage and 107Â fatalities as it ravaged some of the Leeward Islands and the United States, especially the state of South Carolina as a CategoryÂ 4 hurricane. Few other storms in 1989 caused significant damage; hurricanes Chantal and Jerry both resulted in flooding and wind impacts in Texas. Hurricane Dean also caused light damage in Bermuda and the Canadian province of Newfoundland. Tropical Storm Karen, the final storm of the season, brought heavy rainfall and a tornado to Cuba, before dissipating on DecemberÂ 4. Overall, the storms of the season collectively caused 143Â fatalities and at least $11.73Â billion in damage.

== Seasonal forecasts ==

=== Pre-season forecasts ===
Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU). A normal season as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has eleven named storms, of which six reach hurricane strength and two of those become major hurricanes. On May 31, 1989, the CSU forecast that there would be seven named storms, four of which would intensify into a hurricane; there was no prediction of the number of major hurricanes. Prior to the season, the Weather Research Center (WRC) in Houston, Texas also issued a forecast, which called for ten named storms and six hurricanes.
== Seasonal summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1989. It was an above average season in which 15 tropical depressions formed. Eleven depressions attained tropical storm status, and seven of these attained hurricane status. Two hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. The season was above average most likely because of relatively small amounts of dust within the Saharan Air Layer. Four hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season and caused 124Â deaths and at least $10.2Â billion in damage. The last storm of the season, Tropical Storm Karen, dissipated on December 4, four days after the official end of the season on November 30.

Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season began with a tropical depression developing on June 16. Later that month, another tropical depression developed, and intensified, eventually becoming Tropical Storm Allison. After June, the month of July was slightly more active with three tropical depressions developing; however, the latter two (Hurricane Chantal and Hurricane Dean) did not form until extremely late in the month. August was the most active month of the season, with a total of seven tropical cyclones either existing or developing in that period. Although September is the climatological peak of hurricane season, only two tropical cyclones developed in that month, which later become Hurricane Hugo and Tropical Storm Iris. Two tropical cyclones also developed in October, and the latter one in that month eventually became Hurricane Jerry. Finally, one tropical cyclone developed in November; it eventually became Tropical Storm Karen and lasted until DecemberÂ 4.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 135, which is classified as &quot;above normal&quot;. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is tropical storm intensity.

== Systems ==

=== Tropical Depression One ===

A frontal system developed into Tropical Depression One at 1800Â UTC on JuneÂ 15, while located about northeast of Veracruz, Veracruz. The depression initially headed northeastward, before curving southward on JuneÂ 16. It peaked with winds of . Early on JuneÂ 17, the depression dissipated about 85Â miles (140Â km) northeast of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz.
=== Tropical Storm Allison ===
The second tropical depression developed on JuneÂ 24 in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, from the interaction of a tropical wave and the remnants of eastern Pacific Hurricane Cosme. Heading northward, it slowly intensified, becoming Tropical Storm Allison early on JuneÂ 26. Allison continued to slowly intensify, and made landfall near Freeport with winds of on the following day. Moving inland, Allison rapidly weakened over eastern Texas, and transitioned into an extratropical storm on JuneÂ 28. Although it rapidly became extratropical over land, the remnants of Allison meandered over the Southern United States and reached as far north as Indiana. The remnants turned south and then west-northwest after reaching Mississippi, before finally dissipating over Arkansas on JulyÂ 7.

Allison caused significant flooding in several states, especially Louisiana and Texas. Precipitation from the storm peaked at in Winnfield, Louisiana. As a result, more than 1,200Â structures in Louisiana were flooded and over 430,000Â acres of crops were ruined, mostly soybeans and cotton. Three drowning fatalities were also reported. Several tornadoes were spawned in the state, the worst occurred in Ouachita Parish. It destroyed 5Â homes, severely damaged 10Â others, and inflicted minor impact on 100Â houses. In Texas, flooding was more severe. More than 6,200Â homes received water damage, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate and stranding thousands of other people. Three deaths occurred in Texas, all of which were teenage boys that drowned. In Mississippi, the storm caused $60Â million in losses and five drowning deaths. Widespread, but mostly minor flooding was reported elsewhere in the Eastern United States. Overall, damage was estimated to have reached $360â560Â million and 11Â people were killed.
=== Tropical Storm Barry ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on JulyÂ 7. The wave quickly developed a low-level circulation by JulyÂ 9 and was designated Tropical Depression Three at 1800Â UTC, while located about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved northwestward in response to an area of high pressure located north of the Azores. The depression strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Barry on JulyÂ 11. It slowly intensified and reached its peak intensity of the next day. By JulyÂ 13, Barry weakened back to a depression and dissipated shortly after while located 545Â miles (880Â km) northeast of the Lesser Antilles.
=== Hurricane Chantal ===
In late July, a tropical disturbance within the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) was first observed near Trinidad and Tobago. The disturbance later reached the Gulf of Mexico and developed into a tropical depression on JulyÂ 30. While heading north-northwestward, the depression intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal on the following day. Thereafter, Chantal quickly strengthened and became a hurricane on AugustÂ 1. After intensifying slightly further, it made landfall near High Island, Texas later that day. The storm quickly weakened upon moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity a few hours after landfall. Early on August 2, Chantal weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over Oklahoma by August 4.

While making landfall in Texas, the storm produced relatively small tides, with most locations reporting waves less than 4Â feet (1.2Â m) in height. However, some locations experienced extensive beach erosion. In addition, there were numerous rescues made by the U.S. Coast Guard. Due to both rainfall and high winds at least 3,000Â homes were damaged, and numerous trees and sign were knocked down. Two tornadoes were reported, with one wrecking a shed in Crystal Beach, Texas, and the other knocking over several trees and mobile homes in Iota, Louisiana. Elsewhere, Chantal and its remnants brought light to moderate rainfall to several other states, although affects were minor in other states. Overall, 13Â fatalities occurred, all of which due to drowning, and at least $100Â million in damage was reported.
=== Hurricane Dean ===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Five on JulyÂ 31, while situated about halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The following day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dean. Heading generally west-northwestward, Dean intensified into a hurricane on AugustÂ 2. The storm remained a CategoryÂ 1 hurricane as it curved northward, bypassing the Lesser Antilles. Tracking northward, Dean accelerated and intensified into a CategoryÂ 2 hurricane while bypassing Bermuda late on AugustÂ 6. Thereafter, Dean turned northeastward and weakened to a tropical storm, before making landfall in southern Newfoundland on AugustÂ 8. The storm continued in the northeast direction and lost tropical characteristics south of Greenland on the following day.

As Dean approached the Lesser Antilles, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported in Antigua and Barbuda. However, no damage was reported. In Bermuda, winds gusted up to and 3â5Â inches (76.2â127Â mm) of precipitation fell. Although Dean caused no fatalities, 16Â people were injured. According to insurance claims, the storm damaged 648Â buildings, 72Â boats, 36Â vehicles, and one pier. Additionally, strong winds downed power lines, leaving 65,000Â people without electricity. Overall, damage on the island was approximately $8.9Â million, with $3.9Â million incurred at the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex. Storm surge up to occurred in India, though no significant erosion was reported. In Atlantic Canada, light to moderate rainfall was reported, and tropical storm force winds were observed in some areas. Furthermore, waves at 26Â ft (7.92Â m) were reported on Sable Island.
=== Tropical Depression Six ===

A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Six on AugustÂ 8, while located about 125Â miles (200Â km) east of easternmost islands of Cape Verde. While approaching the Lesser Antilles, a tropical storm watch was issued. However, an upper-level low increased wind shear on the system. As a result, the depression degenerated into a tropical wave on AugustÂ 17. The wave eventually split in two, with the southern part eventually becoming Hurricane Lorena in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
=== Hurricane Erin ===

An organized tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on AugustÂ 16. Convection diminished due to cooler sea surface temperatures, but a small, well-defined low-level circulation remained. The convection later redeveloped, and the system became a tropical depression early on AugustÂ 18, while located just southeast of Cape Verde. Thereafter, the interaction between the tropical depression, a tropical wave, and a subtropical system caused it to move north-northwestward. The depression strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Erin at 1800Â UTC on AugustÂ 19.

Erin continued to move north-northwestward, until curving northward on AugustÂ 21. The storm intensified into a hurricane on AugustÂ 22, after being in the northeastern quadrant of an upper-level low, which caused the flow aloft to become more divergent. It slowed and began to move northwestward while northeast of the upper-level low. However, shortly thereafter, a wave moving westward forced Erin to move north and eventually north-northeastward. Early on AugustÂ 24, the storm strengthened into a CategoryÂ 2 hurricane. Later that day, Erin peaked with sustained winds of . The storm then began to weaken and degenerated into a tropical storm on AugustÂ 27. Shortly thereafter, Erin transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the far northern Atlantic.
=== Hurricane Felix ===

A tropical wave was observed over northwestern Africa on AugustÂ 24. By the following day, the system moved into the Atlantic Ocean near Dakar, Senegal. It immediately began organizing and became Tropical Depression Eight at 0000Â UTC on AugustÂ 26. The depression initially headed west-northwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Felix later that day. Shortly thereafter, the storm grazed Cape Verde, with some islands reporting sustained winds near . Between AugustÂ 27 and AugustÂ 29, Felix drifted north-northwestward in response to a persistent upper-level trough. Southwesterly winds sheared away much of the deep convection, causing Felix to weaken back to a tropical depression on AugustÂ 29.

The storm then headed northwestward, until a weak frontal trough turned Felix northward on SeptemberÂ 1. Wind shear decreased, allowing Felix to become a tropical storm again on SeptemberÂ 3. The storm continued to strengthen while moving west-northwestward and by early on SeptemberÂ 5, it became a hurricane. Later that day, Felix peaked with winds of . Drifting north-northeastward, the storm eventually began to accelerate, after weakening back to a tropical storm on SeptemberÂ 7, due to colder sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear. At 1200Â UTC on SeptemberÂ 9, Felix became extratropical while located well east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The remnants later curved east-southeastward and then dissipated on SeptemberÂ 10.
=== Tropical Depression Nine ===

Tropical Depression Nine developed from a tropical wave east of Barbados on AugustÂ 27. However, on the following day, a reconnaissance aircraft did not indicate a low-level circulation. Thus, the depression degenerated back into a tropical wave. Tropical Depression Nine did not re-develop in the Atlantic or the Caribbean Sea, although the remnants entered the Pacific and regenerated into Hurricane Octave on SeptemberÂ 8.
=== Hurricane Gabrielle ===
The tenth tropical depression of the season developed from a tropical wave on AugustÂ 30. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Gabrielle on the following day. Gabrielle moved generally westward, but curved slightly west-northwestward after intensifying into a hurricane on SeptemberÂ 1. Further intensification continued, and Gabrielle eventually peaked as a very strong CategoryÂ 4 hurricane on SeptemberÂ 5. After peaking with sustained winds of , Gabrielle slowly curved nearly due north. Gabrielle significantly weakened while heading northward, with sustained winds dropping from a high-end Category 4 hurricane to a strong CategoryÂ 3 hurricane within 12Â hours on SeptemberÂ 7. While weakening as it headed northward, Gabrielle bypassed the island of Bermuda early on SeptemberÂ 8.

Gabrielle further weakened to a CategoryÂ 2 hurricane late on SeptemberÂ 8, and became nearly stationary roughly almost halfway between Bermuda and Cape Race, Newfoundland. Gabrielle then weakened to a tropical storm and headed due westward on SeptemberÂ 10. Thereafter, the storm made a sharp turn to the northeast on SeptemberÂ 11 and weakened to a tropical depression on the following day. By SeptemberÂ 13, the depression merged with a storm developing off Newfoundland. Although it never approached land, Gabrielle was an extremely large and powerful storm that generated swells up to 20Â ft (6Â m) all the way from the Lesser Antilles to Canada. On Dominica, severe erosion occurred on the east and north coasts. Large waves responsible for eight deaths on the East Coast of the United States; almost all of the fatalities occurred in New England. In Nova Scotia, waves reached a height of 30Â ft (9Â m). In addition, one fatality was reported in Canada, when a man drowned near Ketch Harbor, Nova Scotia.
=== Hurricane Hugo ===
A westward moving tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on SeptemberÂ 10, while located southeast of Cape Verde. It headed generally westward and intensified into Tropical Storm Hugo on SeptemberÂ 11. Hugo became a hurricane by SeptemberÂ 13. After becoming a major hurricane early on SeptemberÂ 15, rapid intensification commenced, and less than 24Â hours later, Hugo peaked as a CategoryÂ 5 hurricane as winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Six hours later, Hugo weakened back to a CategoryÂ 4 hurricane. After weakening on SeptemberÂ 17, Hugo entered the Caribbean Sea after passing between Guadeloupe and Montserrat with winds near and later made landfall on St. Croix at the same intensity. Hugo was further downgraded to a CategoryÂ 3 hurricane, before landfall on eastern Puerto Rico. The storm weakened to a CategoryÂ 2 hurricane on SeptemberÂ 18, after re-emerging into the Atlantic. As Hugo accelerated to the northwest, re-intensification occurred, and it eventually reached a secondary peak intensity as a low-end CategoryÂ 4 hurricane. Early on SeptemberÂ 22, Hugo made landfall near Charleston, South Carolina with winds of . After landfall, Hugo rapidly weakened as it turned to the northeast, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone in northwestern Pennsylvania on SeptemberÂ 23. The remnants continued rapidly northeastward, and dissipated on SeptemberÂ 25 near Greenland.

The storm caused significant damage in Guadeloupe due to winds of . Eleven fatalities and 107Â injuries were reported, while 10,000Â homes were destroyed, leaving 35,000Â people homeless. Crop losses were extreme, with the storm wiping out 100% of the banana crop, 50% of the sugar cane crop, and nearly all coconut crops. Ten people were killed on Montserrat, while 89Â others were injured. Damage on the island topped $260Â million. In Antigua, one person was killed and 30% of the homes damaged. Dominica suffered the loss of 80% of its banana crop, and landslides cut off many towns for days. Two people were killed, 80Â were injured, and 90% of the buildings were damaged or destroyed on Saint Croix. About 3,500Â people were left homeless. Damage estimates for Saint Croix exceeded $1Â billion. Damage from erosion and crop losses in St. Kitts reached $43Â million and one fatality was reported. In Puerto Rico, the storm downed thousands of trees in the El Yunque National Forest and caused near complete destruction of coffee and damage crops. Extreme damage also occurred at Ceiba, Culebra, Fajardo, and Luquillo. Additionally, 28,000Â people were left homeless, 12Â deaths were reported, and losses exceeded $1Â billion. In South Carolina alone, the Red Cross estimates that 3,307Â single family homes were destroyed, 18,171Â were inflicted major damage, and 56,580Â sustained minor impact. Additionally, more than 12,600Â mobile homes and 18,000Â multi-family houses were either damaged or destroyed. There were 35Â deaths and about $5.9Â billion in damage in the state. The most significant impact elsewhere in the United States occurred in North Carolina, where 205Â structure were destroyed, 1,149Â suffered major damage, and 2,638Â were inflicted minor impacts. There was one fatality and damages reached $1Â billion. Overall, Hugo caused at least 88Â fatalities and $9.47Â billion in losses, making it the costliest hurricane in the Atlantic basin, at the time.
=== Tropical Storm Iris ===

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean on SeptemberÂ 12. After undergoing tropical cyclogenesis, a tropical depression developed around 18:00Â UTC on SeptemberÂ 16, while located about halfway between the Windward Islands and the Cape Verde islands. It slowly strengthened and intensified into Tropical Storm Iris early on SeptemberÂ 18. Thereafter, the storm turned north-northwestward and paralleled the Leeward Islands.
Initially, there was uncertainty in its path due to potential for a Fujiwhara interaction with Hugo.

While passing east of the Lesser Antilles, Iris produced of rainfall on Saint John in the U.S. Virgin Islands, resulting in flooding. There were few reports of winds or precipitation on other islands, as Hugo destroyed observation stations a few days prior. On SeptemberÂ 19, Iris attained its maximum sustained wind speed of . Thereafter, the storm weakened due to increased wind shear from Hugo. On SeptemberÂ 21, the winds decreased below tropical storm force, after the center became exposed from the convection. The next day, Iris dissipated while approaching the Bahamas, though a remnant circulation persisted and tracked toward southern Florida.
=== Tropical Depression Thirteen ===

A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on OctoberÂ 2, while located a few hundred miles east of the Lesser Antilles. Although the depression was predicted to intensify to near hurricane status by OctoberÂ 5, a mid-latitude trough increased wind shear, inducing weakening. Later on OctoberÂ 3, the National Hurricane Center began to forecast weakening of the depression. The depression continued weakening and dissipated on OctoberÂ 5.
=== Hurricane Jerry ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on SeptemberÂ 23. Only minimal development occurred as the wave crossed the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. However, after crossing the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula and emerging into the Bay of Campeche on OctoberÂ 12, it developed into a tropical depression. The system quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Jerry on the following day. Jerry tracked generally northward while intensifying and reached hurricane status on OctoberÂ 15. After intensifying slightly more, Jerry made landfall near Jamaica Beach, Texas with winds of . Jerry rapidly weakened after moving inland, and dissipated by OctoberÂ 16. The remnants moved through the Tennessee Valley ahead of a frontal zone and eventually offshore the coast of the Mid-Atlantic states.

Storm surge and rough surf along the coast of Texas destroyed a 20-mile (32Â km) section of Texas State Highway 87, which was never repaired. Due to strong winds, about 52,000Â homes and businesses were left without electricity, most of them in the Galveston area. Many homes, businesses, and buildings were inflicted damage because of strong winds and three tornadoes spawned by the storm. Despite the issuance of a hurricane warning just eight hours prior to landfall, Jerry caused only three fatalities in Texas, possibly due to the storm&#x27;s small size; a car fell over the Galveston Seawall, killing its three occupants. Minor wind and coastal flood damage was reported in Louisiana. Jerry and its remnants brought flash flooding to portions of the Upland South, particularly in the states of Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. In eastern Kentucky, hundreds of homes were flooded and many bridges, culverts, and roads were washed out; this left hundreds of residents stranded. Damage in Kentucky reached at least $5Â million. Similar impact occurred in Virginia, with $3.4Â million in damage in Buchanan County. In West Virginia, overflowing rivers in the western portions of the state forced hundreds to evacuate. Throughout the United States, Jerry resulted in about $70Â million in damage.
=== Tropical Storm Karen ===
A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on NovemberÂ 13 and failed to organize until reaching the western Caribbean Sea. Favorable conditions allowed convection to concentrate around a developing low-level circulation. On NovemberÂ 28, satellite imagery and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the development of a tropical depression just north of Honduras. The depression moved northwestward then northeastward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Karen on NovemberÂ 30, while located southwest of Isla de la Juventud, Cuba. Within 12Â hours of reaching tropical storm intensity, Karen peaked with maximum sustained winds of . Around that time, a building ridge in the Gulf of Mexico forced the storm southeastward.

While Karen was threatening landmasses in the northwestern Caribbean Sea, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for Cozumel on the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, Isle de la Juventud, and western Cuba. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Cuba, reaching over on Isle de la Juventud. Wind gusts reached , and there were reports of a tornado, but no damage or fatalities were reported. After affecting Cuba, Karen turned to the southwest while steadily weakening. It briefly threatened Belize, prompting a tropical storm watch, but the storm turned to the southeast and dissipated on DecemberÂ 4; its remnants later moved over Nicaragua.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1989. This was the same list used for the 1983 season, except for &quot;Allison&quot;, which replaced &quot;Alicia&quot;. Storms were named &quot;Allison&quot;, &quot;Erin&quot;, &quot;Felix&quot;, &quot;Gabrielle&quot;, &quot;Hugo&quot;, &quot;Iris&quot;, &quot;Jerry&quot;, and &quot;Karen&quot; for the first (and, in the case of &quot;Hugo&quot;, only) time in 1989.

=== Retirement ===

The World Meteorological Organization retired &quot;Hugo&quot; from the Atlantic hurricane name lists after the 1989 season on account of its devastating impact. It was replaced with &quot;Humberto&quot; for the 1995 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1989 USD.

<doc id="804149" wikidata="Q844252" url="?curid=804149" title="Higashi-Totsuka Station">
<text>is a passenger railway station located in Totsuka-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East). The station was formerly operated by the Japanese National Railways (JNR).

==Lines==
Higashi-Totsuka Station is served by the ShÅnan-Shinjuku Line and the Yokosuka Line. It is located 36.7 km from the terminus of the Yokosuka Line at Tokyo Station. The station is located on the TÅkaidÅ Main Line, but trains operating on the TÅkaidÅ Main Line do not stop at Higashi-Totsuka. Instead, there are a set of tracks on the left of Higashi Totsuka station where the trains on the Tokaido line pass ( not to be confused by the tracks on the right, witch is operated by JR freight; cargo trains pass use the tracks).

==Station layout==
The station consists of a single island platform with two tracks. The station buildings are built above the platforms. The station had a &quot;Midori no Madoguchi&quot; staffed ticket office ,but it is closed since August 2024; the only way to buy tickets is to use the ticket machines.

The Yokosuka line and the ShÅnan-Shinjuku through services share the exact same platforms. 

===Platforms===

==History==
Higashi-Totsuka Station opened as a station on the Japanese National Railways (JNR) on October 1, 1980, after local residents had petitioned the government for a railway station for over a half century. The opening coincided with the separation of the tracks for the TÅkaidÅ Main Line and Yokosuka Line into two separate sets of tracks from Yokohama through Åfuna Station.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2019, the station was used by an average of 44,389 passengers daily (boarding passengers only). Higashi totsuka station is very crowded in the morning and night rush hours. When ever a train arrives at the station, there is a long line for the escalator going toward the station building, which is above the tracks. The escalator that goes down to the platforms of Higashi totsuka station changes to an escalator that goes up to the station building at 5:30 P.M.

The passenger figures (boarding passengers only) for previous years are as shown below.

==Surrounding area==

<doc id="804150" wikidata="Q194614" url="?curid=804150" title="Elisabeth Elliot">
<text>Elisabeth Elliot (nÃ©e Howard; December 21, 1926 â June 15, 2015) was a Christian missionary, author, and speaker. Her first husband, Jim Elliot, was killed in 1956 while attempting to make missionary contact with the Auca people (now known as Huaorani; also rendered as Waorani or Waodani) of eastern Ecuador. She later spent two years as a missionary to the tribe members who killed her husband. After living in South America for many years, she returned to the United States, wrote over twenty books, and became widely known as an author and a speaker. Elliot toured the country well into her seventies, sharing her knowledge and talking about her experience.

==Biography==
Elisabeth Elliot was born &quot;&#x27;Elisabeth howard&quot; in Brussels, Belgium, on December 21, 1926; her family included her missionary parents, four brothers, and one sister. Elisabeth&#x27;s brothers, Thomas Howard and David Howard, are also authors. 

Her family moved to the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the U.S. when she was a few months old. In addition to Philadelphia, she lived in Franconia, New Hampshire, and Moorestown, New Jersey. She studied Classical Greek at Wheaton College, believing that it was the best tool to help her with the calling of ultimately translating the New Testament of the Bible into an unknown language. It was at Wheaton that she met Jim Elliot. Before their marriage, Elisabeth completed a year of specialized post-graduate studies at the Prairie Bible Institute in Alberta, Canada, where a campus prayer chapel was later named in her honor. Jim Elliot and Elisabeth Howard individually went to Ecuador to work with the TsÃ¡chila. After she married, she joined him in his work with the Quichua (or Quechua) Indians; the two eventually married in the city of Quito in 1953. In January 1956, her husband Jim was speared to death along with four of his missionary friends while they were attempting to contact the Huaorani tribe. Their daughter, Valerie (born on February 27, 1955), was 10 months old when her father was killed. Elisabeth continued her work with the Quichua for two more years.

Two Huaorani women living among the Quichua, including one named Dayuma, taught the Huao language to Elisabeth and fellow missionary Rachel Saint. When Dayuma returned to the Huaorani, she created an opening for contact by the missionaries. In October 1958, Elisabeth went to live with the Huaorani with her three-year-old daughter Valerie and with Rachel Saint.

The Auca/Huaorani gave Elisabeth the tribal name , Huao for &#x27;woodpecker&#x27;. She later returned to the Quichua and worked with them until 1963, when she and Valerie returned to the US (Franconia, New Hampshire).

In 1969, Elisabeth married Addison Leitch, a professor of theology at GordonâConwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. She became a member of the Episcopal Church (United States) with her second husband. Leitch died in 1973. In the fall of 1974, she became an adjunct professor on the faculty of GordonâConwell and for several years taught a popular course entitled &quot;Christian Expression&quot;. In 1977, she married Lars Gren, a hospital chaplain. The Grens later worked and traveled together.

In the mid-1970s, she served as one of the stylistic consultants for the committee of the New International Version of the Bible (NIV). She appears on the NIV&#x27;s list of contributors.

In 1981, Elisabeth was appointed writer-in-residence at Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts.

From 1988 to 2001, Elisabeth could be heard on a daily radio program, &quot;Gateway to Joy&quot;, produced by the Good News Broadcasting Association of Lincoln, Nebraska. She almost always opened the program with the phrase &quot;&#x27;You are loved with an everlasting love,&#x27; â that&#x27;s what the Bible says â &#x27;and underneath are the everlasting arms.&#x27; This is your friend, Elisabeth Elliot...&quot; Today re-runs of the program may be heard over the Bible Broadcasting Network.

In her later years, she and her third husband stopped traveling, but they continued to keep in touch with the public through email and their website.

Elisabeth Elliot died in Magnolia, Massachusetts, on June 15, 2015, at the age of 88. Shortly after her death, Steve Saint â the son of Nate Saint, who was killed alongside Elliot&#x27;s first husband â posted on Facebook about her final victory over &quot;the loss of her mind to dementia&quot; and &quot;her ten year battle with the disease which robbed her of her greatest gift.&quot; She was interred at Hamilton Cemetery in Hamilton, Massachusetts. She was survived by her third husband, Lars Gren; a daughter, Valerie Elliot Shepard; Valerie&#x27;s husband Walter; and eight grandchildren.

==Portrayals of Elisabeth Elliot==
*In 1973, a reader&#x27;s theater production of &quot;Bridge of Blood: Jim Elliot Takes Christ to the Aucas&quot; was first performed at Tennessee Temple University.
*In 2003, a musical based on the story of Jim and Elisabeth Elliot, entitled &quot;Love Above All&quot;, was staged at the Victoria Concert Hall in Singapore. This musical was staged a second time, in 2007, at the University Cultural Centre, Singapore.
*In the 2006 film &quot;End of the Spear&quot;, she was portrayed by actress Beth Bailey.
*In &quot;Beyond the Gates of Splendor&quot;, a documentary film released in 2002, she appears as herself. (The other wives of the murdered missionaries, as well as several Indians, and others, also appear.)
*In 2019, Canadian author Joan Thomas won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for her book &quot;Five Wives&quot;, a fictionalized account of the Elisabeth Elliot story.

<text>Rolf Aldag (born 25 August 1968) is a German former professional road bicycle racer who rode for Team Telekom from 1993 to 2005. He raced in 10 Tour de France, 1 Giro d&#x27;Italia and 5 Vuelta a EspaÃ±a. Prior to joining Telekom, he raced with Helvetia. Beginning in 2020, Aldag works as &quot;directeur sportif&quot; for the CanyonâSRAM team. In 2007 Aldag admitted to doping by having used Erythropoietin (EPO) from 1995 to 1999.

== Career ==
His career highlights include third stage place in both the 1994 and 1995 Tour de France, a stage win in the Tour de Limousin in 1996, a stage win in the Tour de Suisse 1997, overall win of the Bayern-Rundfahrt in 1999, a stage win in the Deutschland Tour 1999, being the German road Champion in 2000, a stage win Deutschland Tour 2001, a stage win in the Bayern-Rundfahrt 2002, a 2nd stage place in the, winner of the Sparkassen-Giro Bochum in 2003, and winner of the Sparkassen Cup Unna in 2003.

Aldag featured in the film &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; concerning the 2003 Tour de France.

In &quot;retirement&quot;, Aldag set a goal of competing in Ironman triathlons. He finished the Hamburg marathon in April 2006 with a time of 2 hours 42 minutes. He went on to finish the 2006 Ironman Lanzarote triathlon in the Canary Islands in 50th place of 825 finishers with a total time of 10:22:14 (swim 1:23:18, bike 5:18:05, run 3:27:56).

T-Mobile hired Aldag as sporting director after sacking Rudy Pevenage who was named in the 2006 OperaciÃ³n Puerto doping case.

Aldag managed the team up the end of 2011 when folded due to lack of sponsorship. Following the team&#x27;s demise, Aldag spent a year working for the World Triathlon Corporation before taking up a role as a technical link-man between Specialized Bicycle Components and in 2013. In 2014 he became the Belgian team&#x27;s Sport and Development Manager. In November 2015 announced that Aldag had been appointed as the team&#x27;s Performance Manager with immediate effect, linking up with 2016 signings Mark Cavendish, Mark Renshaw and Bernhard Eisel. On 3 September 2019, the now renamed team announced that Aldag would leave at the end of the season. On 9 December 2019, CanyonâSRAM announced Aldag as their new &quot;directeur sportif&quot; for the 2020 season.

== Doping confession ==

On 24 May 2007 Aldag together with former Team Telekom team mate and personal friend Erik Zabel admitted having used Erythropoietin (EPO) from 1995 to 1999. Aldag also publicly apologized for having lied about his use of EPO in the past.

His confession was triggered by accusations of former Team Telekom masseur Jef d&#x27;Hont from Belgium. In his book, of which excerpts where printed in the German political magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in April 2007, D&#x27;Hont accused members of Team Telekom of systematic and organized doping with EPO in the mid-1990s.

<doc id="804155" wikidata="Q17104952" url="?curid=804155" title="Pairwise independence">
<text>In probability theory, a pairwise independent collection of random variables is a set of random variables any two of which are independent. Any collection of mutually independent random variables is pairwise independent, but some pairwise independent collections are not mutually independent. Pairwise independent random variables with finite variance are uncorrelated.

A pair of random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are independent if and only if the random vector (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) with joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) formula_1 satisfies

:formula_2

or equivalently, their joint density formula_3 satisfies

:formula_4

That is, the joint distribution is equal to the product of the marginal distributions.

Unless it is not clear in context, in practice the modifier &quot;mutual&quot; is usually dropped so that independence means mutual independence. A statement such as &quot; &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; are independent random variables&quot; means that &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; are mutually independent.

==Example==

Pairwise independence does not imply mutual independence, as shown by the following example attributed to S. Bernstein.

Suppose &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are two independent tosses of a fair coin, where we designate 1 for heads and 0 for tails. Let the third random variable &quot;Z&quot; be equal to 1 if exactly one of those coin tosses resulted in &quot;heads&quot;, and 0 otherwise (i.e., formula_5). Then jointly the triple (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;) has the following probability distribution:

:formula_6

Here the marginal probability distributions are identical: formula_7 and
formula_8 The bivariate distributions also agree: formula_9 where formula_10

Since each of the pairwise joint distributions equals the product of their respective marginal distributions, the variables are pairwise independent:

* &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are independent, and
* &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are independent, and
* &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are independent.

However, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; are not mutually independent, since formula_11 the left side equalling for example 1/4 for (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) = (0, 0, 0) while the right side equals 1/8 for (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) = (0, 0, 0). In fact, any of formula_12 is completely determined by the other two (any of &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; is the sum (modulo 2) of the others). That is as far from independence as random variables can get.

==Probability of the union of pairwise independent events ==
Bounds on the probability that the sum of Bernoulli random variables is at least one, commonly known as the union bound, are provided by the BooleâFrÃ©chet inequalities. While these bounds assume only univariate information, several bounds with knowledge of general bivariate probabilities, have been proposed too. Denote by formula_13 &lt;br&gt;
which subtracts the maximum weight of a star spanning tree on a complete graph with formula_14 nodes (where the edge weights are given by formula_15) from the sum of the marginal probabilities formula_16. &lt;br&gt;
Hunter-Worsley tightened this upper bound by optimizing over formula_17 as follows:&lt;br&gt;
::formula_18
where formula_19 is the set of all spanning trees on the graph. These bounds are not the tightest possible with general bivariates formula_15 even when feasibility is guaranteed as shown in Boros et.al. However, when the variables are pairwise independent (formula_21), RamachandraâNatarajan showed that the Kounias-Hunter-Worsley bound is tight by proving that the maximum probability of the union of events admits a closed-form expression given as:&lt;br&gt;

where the probabilities are sorted in increasing order as formula_22. The tight bound in depends only on the sum of the smallest formula_23 probabilities formula_24 and the largest probability formula_25. Thus, while ordering of the probabilities plays a role in the derivation of the bound, the ordering among the smallest formula_23 probabilities formula_27 is inconsequential since only their sum is used.

===Comparison with the BooleâFrÃ©chet union bound===
It is useful to compare the smallest bounds on the probability of the union with arbitrary dependence and pairwise independence respectively. The tightest BooleâFrÃ©chet upper union bound (assuming only univariate information) is given as:&lt;br&gt;

As shown in Ramachandra-Natarajan, it can be easily verified that the ratio of the two tight bounds in and is upper bounded by formula_28 where the maximum value of formula_28 is attained when &lt;br&gt;
::formula_30, formula_31 &lt;br&gt;
where the probabilities are sorted in increasing order as formula_22. In other words, in the best-case scenario, the pairwise independence bound in provides an improvement of formula_33 over the univariate bound in .

==Generalization==

More generally, we can talk about &quot;k&quot;-wise independence, for any &quot;k&quot;Â â¥Â 2. The idea is similar: a set of random variables is &quot;k&quot;-wise independent if every subset of size &quot;k&quot; of those variables is independent. &quot;k&quot;-wise independence has been used in theoretical computer science, where it was used to prove a theorem about the problem MAXEkSAT.

&quot;k&quot;-wise independence is used in the proof that k-independent hashing functions are secure unforgeable message authentication codes.

<text>The 2-meter amateur radio band is a portion of the VHF radio spectrum that comprises frequencies stretching from 144Â MHz to 148Â MHz in International Telecommunication Union region (ITU) Regions 2 (North and South America plus Hawaii) and 3 (Asia and Oceania)
and from 144Â MHz to 146Â MHz in ITU Region 1 (Europe, Africa, and Russia).

 The license privileges of amateur radio operators include the use of frequencies within this band for telecommunication, usually conducted locally with a line-of-sight range of about .

== Operation ==

Because it is local and reliable, and because the licensing requirements to transmit on the 2-meter band are easy to meet in many parts of the world, this band is one of the most popular non-HF ham bands. This popularity, the compact size of needed radios and antennas, and this band&#x27;s ability to provide easy reliable local communications also means that it is also the most used band for local emergency communications efforts, such as providing communications between Red Cross shelters and local authorities. In the US, that role in emergency communications is furthered by the fact that many amateur-radio operators have a 2-meter handheld transceiver (HT), also known as a handie-talkie or walkie-talkie.

== Repeaters and FM ==
Much of 2-meter FM operations use radio repeaters, which consist of a radio receiver and transmitter that instantly retransmits a received signal on a separate frequency. Repeaters are normally located in high locations such as a tall building or a hill top overlooking expanses of territory. On VHF frequencies such as 2-meters, antenna height greatly influences how far one can talk. Typical reliable repeater range is about . Some repeaters in unusually high locations, such as skyscrapers or mountain tops, can be usable as far out as . Reliable range is very dependent on the height of the repeater antenna and also on the height and surroundings of the handheld or mobile unit attempting to access to the repeater. Line of sight would be the ultimate in reliability. The typical hand held two meter FM transceiver produces about 5 watts of transmit power. Stations in a car or home might provide higher power, 25 to 75 watts, and may use a simple vertical antenna mounted on a pole or on the rooftop of a house or a vehicle.

Even without repeaters available, however, the 2-meter band provides reliable crosstown communications throughout smaller towns, making it ideal for emergency communications. Antennas for repeater work are almost always vertically polarized since 2-meter antennas on cars are usually vertically polarized. Matching polarization allows for maximum signal coupling which equates to stronger signals in both directions. Simple radios for FM repeater operation have become plentiful and inexpensive in recent years.

== Communications beyond 50Â miles ==
While the 2Â meter band is best known as a local band using the FM mode, there are many opportunities for long distance (DX) communications using other modes. A well-placed antenna and high-power equipment can achieve distances of up to a few hundred miles, and fortuitous propagation conditions called &quot;signal enhancements&quot; can on occasion reach across oceans.
The typical 2Â meter station using CW (Morse code) or SSB (single side band) modes consists of a radio driving a power amplifier generating about 200â500Â watts of RF power. This extra power is usually fed to a multi-element, compound antenna, usually a Yagi-Uda or &quot;Yagi&quot;, which can beam most of the signal power towards the intended receiving station. &quot;Beam antennas&quot; provide substantial increase in signal directivity over ordinary dipole or vertical antennas. Antennas used for distance work are usually horizontally polarized instead of the vertical polarization customarily used for local contacts.

Stations that have antennas located in relatively high locations with views (from the antenna) clear to the horizon have a big advantage over other stations. Such stations are able to communicate consistently. It is usual for them to be heard at distances far beyond line of sight on a daily basis without help from signal enhancements. &quot;Signal enhancements&quot; are unusual circumstances in the atmosphere and ionosphere that bend the signal path into an arc that better follows the curve of the Earth, instead of the radio waves traveling in the usual straight line off into space. The best known of these are:

* tropospheric ducting 
* sporadicÂ E
* meteor scatter

These and other well-known forms of VHF signal enhancement that allow trans-oceanic and trans-continental contacts on 2Â meters are described in the subsections that follow within this section.

With the exception of sporadicÂ E, directional antennas such as Yagis or log periodic antennas are almost essential to take advantage of signal enhancements. When a well-equipped station with its antenna well-located âhigh and in the clearâ is operating during a signal enhancement, astonishing distances can be bridged, momentarily approaching what is regularly possible on shortwave and mediumwave.

=== Tropospheric ducting ===
Occasionally, signal bending in the atmosphere&#x27;s troposphere known as tropospheric ducting can allow 2Â meter signals to carry hundreds or even thousands of kilometers as evidenced by the occasional 2Â meter contact between the west coast of the United States and the Hawaiian Islands, the northeast region to the Florida coast, and across the Gulf of Mexico. These so-called &quot;Openings&quot; are generally first spotted by amateurs operating SSB (Single Side Band) and CW (Continuous Wave) modes since amateurs using these modes typically are attempting distance contacts (DX) and alert for signal enhancement events.

Completion of contacts using these weak signal modes involves the exchange of signal level reports and location by grid square which is known as the Maidenhead Locator System. Two way ducting contacts can have very strong signals and are often made with moderate power, small antennas, and other types of modes. Long distance ducting contacts do occur using FM modes as well but for the most part go unnoticed by many FM operators.

=== Sporadic E ===
Another form of VHF propagation is called Sporadic E propagation. This is a phenomenon whereby radio signals are reflected back towards Earth by highly ionized segments of the ionosphere which can facilitate contacts in excess of with very strong signals received by both parties.

Unlike some other long distance modes, high power and large antennas are often not required to make contact with distant stations via a sporadicÂ E event. A two-way conversation can take place over a distance of several hundred kilometers or more, often using low levels of RF power. SporadicÂ E is a rare and completely random propagation phenomenon lasting anywhere from a matter of minutes to several hours.

=== Satellite communications ===
Satellites are basically repeater stations in orbit. The 2Â meter band is also used in conjunction with the 70-centimeter band, or the 10-meter band and various microwave bands via orbiting amateur radio satellites. This is known as cross band repeating. On-board software defines what mode or band is in use at any particular time and this is determined by amateurs at so-called earth stations who control or instruct the satellite behavior. Amateurs know what mode is in use via published internet schedules.

For instance, a favorite mode is ModeÂ &quot;B&quot; or &quot;V/U&quot; which simply indicates the uplink and downlink frequencies or bands the satellite is currently using. In this example, V/U means VHF/UHF or VHF uplink with UHF downlink. Most amateur satellites are Low Earth Orbit satellites, or LEO&#x27;s as they are affectionately known, and generally are at about 450Â miles (700Â km) altitude. At that height, amateurs can expect reception distances of up to around .

A few amateur satellites have very high elliptical orbits. These satellites can reach altitudes of 30,000Â miles (50,000Â km) above the earth where an entire hemisphere is visible providing outstanding communications capabilities from any two points on the earth within line of sight of the satellite; distances that are far beyond the reach of the LEOs.

=== Transequatorial propagation ===
Transequatorial propagation, also known as (TEP), is a regular daytime occurrence on the 2Â meter band over the equatorial regions and is common in the temperate latitudes in late spring, early summer and, to a lesser degree, in early winter. For receiving stations located within Â±Â 10Â degrees of the geomagnetic equator, equatorial E-skip can be expected on most days throughout the year, peaking around midday local time.

=== Meteor burst ===
By speeding up Morse code using analog tape or digital modes such as JT6M or FSK441, very short high-speed bursts of digital data can be bounced off the ionized gas trail of meteor showers. The speed required to confirm a two way contact via a short lived ionized meteor trail can only be performed by fast computers on both ends with very little human interaction.

One computer will send a request for contact and if successfully received by a distant station, a reply will be sent by the receiving stations computer usually via the same ionized meteor trail to confirm the contact. If nothing is received after the request, a new request is transmitted. This continues until a reply is received to confirm the contact or until no contact can be made and no new requests are sent. Using this high speed digital mode, a full two way contact can be completed in one second or less and can only be validated using a computer. Depending on the intensity of the ionized meteor trail, multiple contacts from multiple stations can be made off the same trail until it dissipates and can no longer reflect VHF signals with sufficient strength. This mode is often called burst transmission and can yield communication distances similar to sporadicÂ E as described above.

=== Auroral propagation ===
Another phenomenon that produces upper atmosphere ionization suitable for 2-meter DXing are the auroras. Since the ionization persists much longer than meteor trails, voice modulated radio signals may sometimes be used, but the constant movement of the ionized gas leads to heavy distortion of the signals causing the audio to sound &quot;ghostly&quot; and whispered. In most instances using auroral reflections on 2Â meters, audio or voice is totally unintelligible and ham operators wishing to make contacts via aurora, must resort to CW (Morse code).

CW signals returning from an auroral reflection have no distinct sound or tone but simply sound like a swishing or whooshing noise. An exception to this phenomenon would be the 6Â meter band which is significantly lower in frequency than the 2Â meter band by 94Â MHz. In many instances 6Â meter voice modes are readable but with varying degrees of difficulty when reflected off an aurora. Therefore, when using an auroral event as a radio signal reflector, the reflected signal strength and signal intelligibility decreases with increasing transmitting frequency.

=== Moonbounce (EME) ===
To communicate over the longest distances, hams use moon bounce. VHF signals normally escape the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, so using the moon as a target is quite practical. Due to the distance involved and the very high path loss getting a readable signal bounced off the moon involves high power ~1,000Â watts and steerable high gain antennas. Receiving these very weak return signals, again involves the use of high gain antennas (usually the same type used to transmit the signal) and a very low-noise front end RF amplifier and a frequency stable receiver.

However, new and recent technological advances in weak signal detection has allowed the successful reception of signals off the moon using much smaller or less well equipped stations allowing reception of signals that are &quot;in the noise&quot; and not audible to the human ear. One of these modes is JT65 which is a digital mode. Due to the delay of the signal traveling to the moon and back (travel time approx. 2.5Â seconds), a person transmitting may hear the end of their own transmission returning.

=== The Brendan Awards ===
The Irish Radio Transmitters Society has provided a series of awards for the first successful all-natural, non-bounce contacts on 2Â metres between the North American and European continents. Named for Saint Brendan of Clonfert, the three awards differentiate between successful &quot;traditional&quot; phone/CW contact (the Brendan Trophies), successful &quot;non-traditional&quot; digital two-way contact (the Brendan Shields), and an award for the first verified reception in either direction, regardless of method (the Brendan Plates). Attempts at the Brendan awards have established contact, but further examination revealed the signal was bounced off the International Space Station.

== Los Angeles County statute ==
Los Angeles County has a statute (which dates from 1944) concerning mounting a &quot;shortwave receiver&quot; in a motor vehicle. While the statute specifically states one of the forbidden bands as 150â160Â MHz, most two-meter transceivers can tune into this portion of the spectrum at least as receivers, and are therefore unlawful to mount in a motor vehicle in Los Angeles County. While arrest rarely happens, the statute is still on the books. There are also California Penal Code statutes covering similar activities. Recently, however, with new legislation in various states, licensed ham radio operators are exempt from these prohibitions including exemptions from using a radio while driving. Such prohibitions or exemptions vary from state to state.

Note: Federal law preempts many local ordinances and state laws which may prohibit a licensed amateur radio operator from possessing an amateur radio based on its factory ability to receive frequencies outside of ham bands.

<text>TotalEnergies SE is a French multinational integrated energy and petroleum company founded in 1924 and is one of the seven supermajor oil companies. Its businesses cover the entire oil and gas chain, from crude oil and natural gas exploration and production to power generation, transportation, refining, petroleum product marketing, and international crude oil and product trading. TotalEnergies is also a large-scale chemicals manufacturer.

TotalEnergies has its head office in the Tour Total in La DÃ©fense district in Courbevoie, west of Paris. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. In the 2023 Forbes Global 2000, TotalEnergies was ranked as the 21st largest company in the world.

==History==
===1924â1985: Compagnie franÃ§aise des pÃ©troles===
The company was founded after World War I, when petrol was seen as vital in case of a new war with Germany. The then-French President Raymond PoincarÃ© rejected the idea of forming a partnership with Royal Dutch Shell in favour of creating an entirely French oil company. At PoincarÃ©&#x27;s behest, Col. Ernest Mercier, with the support of 90 banks and companies, founded Total in 1924, as the Compagnie franÃ§aise des pÃ©troles (CFP) (in English, the French Petroleum Company).

As per the agreement reached during the San Remo conference of 1920, the French state received the 25% share held by Deutsche Bank in the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) as part of the compensation for war damages caused by Germany during World War I. The French government&#x27;s stake in TPC was transferred to CFP, and the Red Line agreement in 1928 rearranged the shareholding of CFP in TPC (later renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1929) to 23.75%. The company from the start was regarded as a private sector company in view of its listing on the Paris Stock Exchange in 1929.

During the 1930s, the company was engaged in exploration and production, primarily from the Middle East. Its first refinery began operating in Normandy in 1933. After World War II, CFP engaged in oil exploration in Venezuela, Canada, and Africa while pursuing energy sources within France. Exploration in Algeria, then a French colony, began in 1946, with Algeria becoming a leading source of oil in the 1950s.

In 1954, CFP introduced its downstream product â Total brand of gasoline in Africa and Europe.

Total entered the United States in 1971 by acquiring Leonard Petroleum of Alma, Michigan and several Standard Oil of Indiana stations in Metro Detroit.

In 1980, Total Petroleum (North America) Ltd., a company controlled 50% by CFP, bought the American refining and marketing assets of Vickers Petroleum as part of a sell-off by Esmark of its energy holdings. This purchase gave Total refining capacity, transportation, and a network of 350 service stations in 20 states.

===1985â2003: Total CFP and rebranding to Total===
Total&#x27;s leadership had been aware of the deleterious effects of global warming since at least 1971; The company nevertheless openly denied the findings of climate science until the 1990s; Total also pursued a number of strategies to cover up the threat and contribution to climate change.

The company renamed itself Total CFP in 1985, to build on the popularity of its gasoline brand. Later in 1991, the name was changed to Total, when it became a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1991, the French government held more than 30 percent of the company&#x27;s stock but by 1996 had reduced its stake to less than 1 percent. In the period between 1990 and 1994, foreign ownership of the firm increased from 23 percent to 44 percent.

Meanwhile, Total continued to expand its retail presence in North America under several brand names. In 1989, Denver, Coloradoâbased Total Petroleum, Total CFP&#x27;s North American unit, purchased 125 Road Runner retail locations from Texarkana, Texasâbased Truman Arnold Companies. By 1993, Total Petroleum was operating 2,600 retail stores under the Vickers, Apco, Road Runner, and Total brands. That year, the company began remodeling and rebranding all of its North American gasoline and convenience stores to use the Total name. Four years later, Total sold its North American refining and retail operations to Ultramar Diamond Shamrock for $400 million in stock and $414 million in assumed debt.

In 1996, the Girassol oil field was discovered and operated by TotalEnergies SE. After Total&#x27;s takeover of Petrofina of Belgium in 1999, it became known as Total Fina. Afterwards, it also acquired Elf Aquitaine. First named TotalFinaElf after the merger in 2000, its name reverted to Total in 2003. During that rebranding, the globe logo was unveiled.

===2003â2021===
In 2003, Total signed for a 30% stake in the gas exploration venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) â South Rub&#x27; al-Khali joint venture along with Royal Dutch Shell and Saudi Aramco. The stake was later bought out by its partners.

In 2006, Saudi Aramco and Total signed a memorandum of understanding to develop the Jubail Refinery and Petrochemical project in Saudi Arabia which targeted 400,000 barrels per day (bpd). Two years later, the two companies officially established a joint venture called Saudi Aramco Total Refining and Petrochemical Company (SATORP)- in which a 62.5% stake was held by Saudi Aramco and the balance 37.5% held by Total.

Total withdrew in 2006 from all Iranian development work because of United Nations concerns that resulted in sanctions over possible weaponization of the Nuclear program of Iran.

During the 2009â2010 Iraqi oil services contracts tender, a consortium led by CNPC (37.5%), which also included TOTAL (18.75%) and Petronas (18.75%) was awarded a production contract for the &quot;Halfaya field&quot; in the south of Iraq, which contains an estimated of oil.

In 2010 Total and Erg merged their respective subsidiaries Total Italia and Erg Petroli, forming TotalErg, 49% controlled by the French group and 51% by the Italian one.

As of 2010, Total had over 96,000 employees and operated in more than 130 countries. In 2010, Total announced plans to pull out of the forecourt market in the United Kingdom.

In 2012, Total announced it was selling its 20% stake and operating mandate in its Nigerian offshore project to a unit of China Petrochemical Corp for $2.5 billion.

In 2013, Total started the operation at Kashagan with North Caspian Operating Company. It is the biggest discovery of oil reserves since 1968. In 2013, Total increased its stake in Novatek to 16.96%. In 2013, Total and its joint venture partner agreed to buy Chevron Corporation&#x27;s retail distribution business in Pakistan for an undisclosed amount.

In January 2014, Total became the first major oil and gas firm to acquire exploration rights for shale gas in the UK after it bought a 40 percent interest in two licences in the Gainsborough Trough area of northern England for $48 million. In July 2014, the company disclosed it was in talks to sell its LPG distribution business in France to Pennsylvania-based UGI Corporation for â¬450 million ($615 million).

On 20 October 2014, at 23:57 MST, a Dassault Falcon 50 business jet heading to Paris caught fire and exploded during takeoff after colliding with a snow removal vehicle in Vnukovo International Airport, killing four, including three crew members and CEO of Total S.A. Christophe de Margerie on board. Alcohol presence was confirmed in the blood of the driver of the vehicle on the ground. Patrick Pouyanne, who was Total&#x27;s Refining Chief at that time, was appointed as CEO, and also as chairman of Total in 2015.

In 2015, Total unveiled plans to cut 180 jobs in the United Kingdom, reduce refinery capacity and slow spending on North Sea fields after it fell to a $5.7bn final-quarter loss. The company said it would also sell off $5bn worth of assets worldwide and cut exploration costs by 30%.

In 2016, Total signed a $224M deal to buy Lampiris, the third-largest Belgian supplier of gas and renewable energy to expand its gas and power distribution activities.

In 2016, Total bought French battery maker Saft Groupe S.A. in a $1.1bn deal, to boost its development in renewable energy and electricity businesses.

In 2016, Total agreed to acquire $2.2-billion in upstream and downstream assets from Petrobras as part of the firms&#x27; strategic alliance announced earlier that year. For Total, these new partnerships with Petrobras reinforce Total&#x27;s position in Brazil through access to new fields in the Santos Basin while entering the gas value chain.

Between 2013 and 2017, Total organized the ARGOS Challenge, a robotic competition with the aim to develop robots for their oil and gas production sites. It was won by an Austrian-German team using a variant of the taurob tracker robot.

In 2017, Total signed a deal for a total amount of $4.8b with Iran for the development and production of South Pars, the world&#x27;s largest gas field. The deal was the first foreign investment in Iran since in the 2015 sanctions over Iran&#x27;s nuclear weaponisation were lifted by the JCPOA.

In 2017, Total announced the acquisition of Maersk Oil for $7.45 billion in a share and debt transaction. This deal positioned Total as the second operator in the North Sea.

In 2017, Total signed an agreement with EREN Renewable energy to acquire an interest of 23% in EREN RE for an amount of â¬237.5 million.

In November 2017, Total announced the launch on the French residential market of Total Spring, a natural gas and green power offering that is 10% cheaper than regulated tariffs. Total is thus pursuing its strategy of downstream integration in the gas and power value chain in Europe.

On 10 January 2018 TotalErg was acquired by Gruppo API, with the exception of the &quot;Special Fluids&quot; division, acquired by the newly formed Total Italia.

In 2018, Total officially withdrew from the Iranian South Pars gas field because of sanctions pressure from the US.

In 2019, Total announced the sale of a 30% stake in the Trapil pipeline network to crude oil storage operator Pisto SAS for â¬260 million. Later that year, Total signed deals to transfer 30% and 28.33% of its assets in Namibia&#x27;s Block 2913B and Block 2912 respectively to QatarEnergy. The company will also transfer 40% of its existing 25% interests in the Orinduik and Kanuku blocks of Guyana and 25% interest in Blocks L11A, L11B, and L12 of Kenya to QatarEnergy.

In July 2020 the company changed its name from Total SA to Total SE as part of registration as a European company.

In 2020, the company announced its intention to cut 500 voluntary jobs in France.

In 2021, Total left the American Petroleum Institute lobby, due to differences in the common vision of how to tackle the fight against climate change.

In 2021, Total said that it had registered an income of $3 billion for the period of JanuaryâMarch, which is close to the levels registered before the pandemic.

===2021âpresent: Rebranding to TotalEnergies===

In 2021, the company announced a name change to TotalEnergies as an intended illustration of its investments in the production of green electricity. At the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholdersâ Meeting in May of that year, shareholders approved the name change to TotalEnergies.

In 2022, TotalEnergies announced it would end all operations in Myanmar, citing rampant human rights abuses and deteriorating rule of law since the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;Ã©tat and has also called for international sanctions targeting the oil and gas sector in the country, which is one of the main sources of revenue for Myanmar&#x27;s government.

As of 11 March 2022, Total was one of the only Western oil companies to continue operating in Russia after the Russian Invasion of Ukraine.

In June 2022, TotalEnergies signed a partnership with QatarEnergy for the world&#x27;s largest LNG expansion project, the North Field East (NFE). Holding the largest stake, 6.25%, TotalEnergies will hold the equivalent of one of the four trains. In September 2022, an additional agreement was signed to include the North Field South (NFS) which is the second phase of the NFE. This gave TotalEnergies a stake of 9.375% of the 25% stakes available to international companies.

On 30 March 2023, Total sold a shipment of LNG which it sourced from UAE to CNOOC on the Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange. It was reportedly the first trade to be settled in the renminbi (Chinese yuan) currency on the SHPGX.

In July 2023, Iraq signed a $27 billion energy agreement with TotalEnergies to develop the country&#x27;s energy sector and boost output of oil, gas and renewables. Additionally, Indian Oil Corp, has signed liquefied natural gas (LNG) import deals with &quot;ADNOC LNG&quot; and &quot;TotalEnergies&quot; in the same month.

In October 2023, TotalEnergies sold its Canadian operations to Suncor Energy for C$1.47 billion($1.07 billion). TotalEnergies has agreed to buy liquefied natural gas from Qatar for 27 years, cementing the European nation&#x27;s commitment to fossil fuels beyond 2050.

In 2023, Total invested $300 million in a renewable energy joint venture with Adani Green Energy. The joint venture&#x27;s portfolio capacity is 1,050 MW - 300 MW of operating capacity, 500 MW of solar projects under construction and 250 MW of projects under development, as well as solar and wind power projects in India.
At the end of January 2024, TotalEnergies reached an agreement with OMV to purchase a 50% stake in its joint venture in Malaysia (SapuraOMV) for $903 million. The deal includes the repayment of a $350 million loan from OMV to the joint venture.

On 21 February 2024, TotalEnergies and Airbus entered a strategic partnership to meet emission-reduction goals through the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). TotalEnergies will provide more than 50% of Airbusâ European fuel requirements. Compared to fossil fuels, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 90%.

TotalEnergies and QatarEnergy entered an agreement on 6 March 2024 to purchase participating interests in South Africa&#x27;s Orange Basin offshore oil field. Under the agreement, TotalEnergies will have the exclusive right to operate its wells in Block 3B/4B with a 33% interest holding, while QatarEnergy will receive a 24% interest in the same block.

On 22 April 2024, OmanLNG and TotalEnergies signed a deal in which OmanLNG will provide 800,000 metric tons of liquified natural gas.

On 14 November 2024, TotalEnergies announced that it will fill all of its upstream assets with real-time methane leak detection equipment by 2025 to help minimize the emissions. This is expected to help the company in its target of slashing methane emissions to nearly zero percent by 2030.

On 15 November 2024, TotalEnergies, BP, Shell and Equinor promised to invest $500 million to increase the access to affordable energy, focusing primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, south and southeast Asia. This would includeÂ  domestic solar energy systems, micro-electricity grids, energy production, transport, logistics and storage, e-mobility technologies, and modern cooking fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

On 3 December 2024 TotalEnergies announced its plans to build a 0.3 gigawatt (GW) solar park in Saudi Arabia, while another leading company from France EDF has been assigned to build two solar parks with a total of 1.4 GW.

In January 2025, TotalEnergies sold all of its service stations to Coly Energy Mali, a subsidiary managed by the Beninese company BÃ©nin Petro.

On February 18, 2025, TotalEnergies confirmed its departure from Burkina Faso, after 70 years of presence, in Burkina Faso.

== Organization ==
=== Business trends ===
The key trends of TotalEnergies are (as at the financial year ending 31 December):
=== Business segments ===

In 2016, Total set up a new organization to achieve its ambition to become a responsible energy major. It is composed of the following segments: Exploration &amp; Production; Gas, Renewables &amp; Power; Refining &amp; Chemicals; Trading &amp; Shipping; Marketing &amp; Services; and Total Global Services.

In 2016 Total created two new corporate divisions: People &amp; Social Responsibility (Human Resources; Health, Safety &amp; Environment; the Security Division; and a new Civil Society Engagement Division) and Strategy &amp; Innovation (Strategy &amp; Climate Division, responsible for ensuring that strategy incorporates the 2Â Â°C global warming scenario, Public Affairs, Audit, Research &amp; Development, the Chief Digital Officer and the Senior Vice President Technology).

===Head office===
The company&#x27;s headquarters is in the Tour Total in the La DÃ©fense district in Courbevoie, France, near Paris. The building was originally constructed between 1983 and 1985 for Elf Aquitaine; Total SA acquired the building after its merger with Elf in 2000.

== Subsidiaries ==

=== TotalEnergies Italia ===
Total Italia S.p.A. (originally Total Italia S.r.l.) is an Italian company that operates in the distribution of lubricants. It is a subsidiary of TotalEnergies SE.

It was founded in 2018 by the split of the &quot;Special Fluids&quot; branch from TotalErg in view of the acquisition by Gruppo API. It takes its name from the old Total Italia, dissolved in 2018 with the birth of TotalErg.

==Operations==
In May 2014, the company shelved its Joslyn North oil sands project in the Athabasca region of Alberta, Canada, indefinitely, citing concerns about operating costs. An estimated $11 billion has been spent on the project, in which Total is the largest shareholder with 38.5%. Suncor Energy holds 36.75%, Occidental Petroleum owns 15% and Japan&#x27;s Inpex has a 10% interest.

Total is involved in 23 projects of exploration and production in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Russia.

===Investments===
In 1937, Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), 23.75 percent owned by Total, signed an oil concession agreement with the Sultan of Muscat. IPC offered financial support to raise an armed force that would assist the Sultan in occupying the interior region of Oman, an area that geologists believed to be rich in oil. This led to the 1954 outbreak of Jebel Akhdar War in Oman that lasted for more than 5 years.

Total has been a significant investor in the Iranian energy sector since 1990. In 2017, Total and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) signed a contract for the development and production of South Pars, the world&#x27;s largest gas field. The project will have a production capacity of 2 billion cubic feet per day. The produced gas will supply the Iranian domestic market starting in 2021.

During the European Union&#x27;s sanctions against the military dictatorship Myanmar, Total is able to operate the Yadana natural gas pipeline from Burma to Thailand. Total is currently the subject of a lawsuit in French and Belgian courts for the condoning and use of the country&#x27;s civilian slavery to construct the pipeline. The documentary &#x27;Total Denial&#x27; shows the background of this project. The NGO Burma Campaign UK is currently campaigning against this project.

===Acquisitions===
In 2011, Total agreed to buy 60% of photovoltaics company SunPower for US$1.38Â billion. By the 2013 annual reporting date, Total owned 64.65%.

In 2016, Total agreed to purchase French battery maker Saft Groupe S.A. for 1.1 billion euros.

In 2016, Total signed a $224M deal to buy Lampiris, the third-largest Belgian supplier of gas and renewable energy to expand its gas and power distribution activities.

In December 2016, Total acquired about 23% of Tellurian for an amount of 207 million dollars, to develop an integrated gas project.

In 2017, Total announced it would buy Maersk Oil from A.P. Moller-Maersk in a deal expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.

In 2018, Total announced it was buying 74% of the French electricity and gas provider Direct Ãnergie from their main stockholders, for 1.4 billion euros.

In 2022, Total announced it had added 4 GW to its renewable energy portfolio through the acquisition of the Austin-based company, Core Solar. The following month, Total entered an agreement with GIP to acquire a 50% stake in Clearway, one of the largest renewable energy owners in the United States. As part of the transaction, GIP took a 50% minus one share stake in SunPower.

In October 2023, TotalEnergies announced it was purchasing Quadra, a Germany based clean energy aggregator, for an undisclosed amount.

In 2023, TotalEnergies acquired three gas-fired power plants with a total capacity of 1.5 GW in Texas from TexGen for $635 million.

===Western Sahara oil exploration===
In 2001, Total signed a contract for oil-reconnaissance in areas offshore Western Sahara (near Dakhla), with the Moroccan &quot;Office National de Recherches et dâExploitations PetroliÃ¨res&quot; (ONAREP). In 2002, Hans Corell (the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs) stated in a letter to the president of the Security Council that whenever the contracts are only for exploration they&#x27;re not illegal, but if further exploration or exploitation are against the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara, they would be in violation of the principles of international law.
Finally, Total decided to not renew their license off Western Sahara.

===Energy Deal with ADNOC===
In a move to cope with the 2021â2022 global energy crisis, which started with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and aggravated with Russia&#x27;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, France&#x27;s TotalEnergies and UAE&#x27;s ADNOC signed a strategic deal to partner on energy projects âfor cooperation in the area of energy suppliesâ.

The deal was secured on the second day of the UAE leader Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan&#x27;s visit to Paris in 2022. The visit marked the UAE president&#x27;s first overseas state visit since assuming the post earlier that year.

The deal was aimed at identifying and targeting potential joint investment projects in the UAE, France, and elsewhere in the sectors of renewables, hydrogen, and nuclear energy, as told by the French government in one of its statements. According to French President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s aides, France had been eager to secure diesel supply from the UAE.

The deal also received criticism from human rights groups that pressured Macron not to give the then âcrown prince a pass on the UAE&#x27;s atrocious human rights recordâ, per the statement published by Human Rights Watch on its website.

==Controversies==

=== Environmental and safety records ===
In 1999, the Total SA company was fined â¬375,000 for the MV Erika oil spill that stretched 400 kilometers from La Rochelle to the western tip of Brittany. The company was only fined that amount because they were only partially liable because Total SA did not own the ship. The plaintiffs had sought more than $1.5 billion in damages. More than 100 groups and local governments joined in the suit. The Total company was fined just over $298,000. The majority of the money will go to the French government, several environmental groups, and various regional governments. The Total SA company was also fined $550,000 for the amount of marine pollution that came from it. After the oil spill they tried to restore their image and have opened a sea turtle conservation project in Masirah in recent years.

Prior to the verdict in which Total was found guilty one of the counterparts in the incident, Malta Maritime Authority (MMA), was not to be tried for having any hand in the incident. In 2005, Total submitted a report to the Paris courts which stated that Total had gathered a group of experts which stated the tanker was corroded and that Total was responsible for it. The courts sought a second expert reviewing this information, which was turned down.

In 2001, the AZF chemical plant exploded in Toulouse, France, while belonging to the Grande Paroisse branch of Total.

In 2008, Total was required to pay â¬192 million in compensation to victims of the pollution caused by the sinking of the ship Erika. This was in addition to the â¬200 million that Total spent to help clean up the spill. The company appealed twice against the verdict, losing both times.

In 2016, Total was ranked as the second-best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights in the Arctic. According to the CDP Carbon Majors Report 2017, the company was one of the top 100 companies producing carbon emissions globally, responsible for .9% of global emissions from 1998 to 2015. In 2021, Total was ranked as the 2nd most environmentally responsible company out of 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle in the Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI).

According to a 2021 study, Total personnel were aware about the role that their products played in global warming as early as 1971, as well as throughout the 1980s. Despite this awareness, the company promoted doubt regarding the science of global warming by the late 1980s, and ultimately settled on a position in the late 1990s of publicly accepting climate science, while still promoting doubt and trying to delay climate action. In August 2024, South Africa&#x27;s advertising regulator ruled that TotalEnergies&#x27; promotion of sustainability in an advertising campaign in the country was misleading. The campaign was run in collaboration with South Africa&#x27;s nature conservation authority, Sanparks, to encourage people to visit the country&#x27;s national parks.

=== Bribery ===
Total has been accused of bribery on multiple occasions.

Total is being implicated in a bribe commission scandal which is currently emerging in Malta. It has emerged that Total had told Maltese agents that it would not be interested in doing business with them unless their team included George Farrugia, who is under investigation in the procurement scandal. George Farrugia has recently been given a presidential pardon in exchange for information about this scandal. Enemalta, Malta&#x27;s energy supplier, swiftly barred Total and its agents, Trafigura from bidding and tenders. An investigation is currently underway and three people have been arraigned.

On 16 December 2008, the managing director of the Italian division of Total, Lionel Levha, and ten other executives were arrested by the public Prosecutor&#x27;s office of Potenza, Italy, for a corruption charge of â¬15 million to undertake the oilfield in Basilicata on contract. Also arrested was the local deputy of Partito Democratico Salvatore Margiotta and an Italian entrepreneur.

In 2010, Total was accused of bribing Iraqi officials during former president Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime to secure oil supplies. A United Nations report later revealed that Iraqi officials had received bribes from oil companies to secure contracts worth over $10bn. On 26 February 2016, the Paris Court of Appeals considered Total guilty and ordered the company to pay a fine of â¬750,000 for corrupting Iraqi civil servants. The court&#x27;s ruling overturns an earlier acquittal in the case.

In 2013, a case was settled that concerned charges that Total bribed an Iranian official with $60 million, which they documented as a &quot;consulting charge,&quot; and which unfairly gave them access to Iran&#x27;s Sirri A and Sirri E oil and gas fields. The bribery gave them a competitive advantage, earning them an estimated $150 million in profits. The Securities Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice settled the charges, expecting Total to pay $398 million.

=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine which began on 24 February, many international, particularly Western companies pulled out of Russia. On 1 March, TotalEnergies announced it &quot;will no longer provide capital for new projects in Russia&quot; but has retained ownership of its 19.4% stake in privately owned Novatek, 20% stake in the Yamal project and 10% stake in Arctic LNG 2. This has led to criticism as insufficient, particularly given complete divestment of other major Western energy companies, and the European Union announcement of becoming more energy independent from Russia.
Similarly in August 2022, an investigation by Global Witness showed that a Siberian gas field part-owned by TotalEnergies has been supplying a refinery, which is producing jet fuel for Russian warplanes. This contradicts Total&#x27;s claims that this was unrelated to Russian military operations in Ukraine.

=== Africa ===
In December 2022, the NGOs Friends of the Earth, Survie and four Ugandan NGOs sent the oil group Total to court and accused it of violating the law on the duty of vigilance of large French companies in terms of human rights and environment. The Tilenga Project, which TotalEnergies is undertaking in conjunction with China National Offshore Oil Corporation consists of drilling for oil in the Murchison Falls National Park, a habitat for diverse species of birds and animals. The project also involves building a pipeline from the site in land-locked Uganda to Tanga in Tanzania. Critics of the project are concerned that, since the proposed pipeline passes through Lake Victoria and close to a number of wildlife areas in Tanzania and Kenya, oil spills could threaten the lake and could have adverse effects on the wildlife, some of which is endangered, in various national parks.

In 2016, Total secured an eight-year sponsorship package from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to support 10 of its principal competitions. Total will start with the Africa Cup of Nations to be held in Gabon, therefore, renaming it Total Africa Cup of Nations.

Following Total&#x27;s purchase of Direct Ãnergie in the summer of 2018, the cycling team changed its name the following year to Total Direct Ãnergie ahead of that year&#x27;s edition of ParisâRoubaix. In 2021 the team changed its name again to Team TotalEnergies in time for that year&#x27;s Tour de France.

In 2019, the company&#x27;s Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Pouyanne pledged that Total would make a â¬100 million contribution to the reconstruction of the Notre-Dame cathedral after it was extensively damaged in a fire.

<text>The Western Siouan languages, also called Siouan proper or simply Siouan, are a large language family native to North America. They are closely related to the Catawban languages, sometimes called Eastern Siouan, and together with them constitute the Siouan (SiouanâCatawban) language family.

Linguistic and historical records indicate a possible southern origin of the Siouan people, with migrations over a thousand years ago from North Carolina and Virginia to Ohio. Some continued down the Ohio River, to the Mississippi and up to the Missouri. Others went down the Mississippi, settling in what is now Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Others traveled across Ohio to what is now Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, home of the Dakota.

==Family division==

The Siouan family proper consists of some 18 languages and various dialects:
* Siouan
** Mandan 
*** Nuptare
*** Nuetare
** Missouri River Siouan (a.k.a. CrowâHidatsa)
*** Crow (a.k.a. Absaroka, Apsaroka, Apsaalooke, Upsaroka) â 3,500 speakers
*** Hidatsa (a.k.a. Minitari, Minnetaree) â 200 speakers
** Mississippi Valley Siouan (a.k.a. Central Siouan)
***Mitchigamea? 
*** Dakotan (a.k.a. SiouxâAssiniboineâStoney)
**** Nakoda
***** Assiniboine â 150 speakers
***** Stoney â 3,200 speakers
**** Sioux â 25,000 speakers
***** Lakota â 2,100 speakers
***** Dakota (sometimes classified as Western and Eastern Dakota) â 290 speakers
*** Chiwere-Winnebago
**** Chiwere 
**** Winnebago â 250 speakers
*** Dhegihan
**** OmahaâPonca â 85 speakers
**** Kansa-Osage
***** Kansa 
***** Osage , on ongoing revival
**** Quapaw â 1 speaker
** Ohio Valley Siouan
*** Virginia Siouan
**** Tutelo 
**** Moneton 
*** Mississippi Siouan
**** Biloxi 
**** Ofo 

&quot;()&quot; â Extinct language

Another view of both the Dakotan and Mississippi Valley branches is to represent them as dialect continuums.

All the Virginia Siouan dialects listed here are thought to have been closely related to one another; the term Tutelo language is also used in reference to their common tongue.

==Writing systems==
There are two systems used to transcribe within this family:
* Latin alphabet used by a majority of these languages.
* Osage script, developed in 2005 by Herman Mongrain Lookout. There are also considerations for the script to be extensively usable for other languages in the Dhegiha group to the extent of this family.

<doc id="804167" wikidata="Q261205" url="?curid=804167" title="70-centimeter band">
<text>The 70-centimeter or 440Â MHz band is a portion of the UHF radio spectrum internationally allocated to amateur radio and amateur satellite use. The ITU amateur radio allocation is from 430 to 440Â MHz; however, some countries, such as the United States, allocate hams 420 to 450Â MHz. Depending on the country the band is shared with other radio services (in United States with government radar systems such as PAVE PAWS).

70 centimeters is a popular ham band due to the ready availability of equipment in both new and used markets. Most amateurs operating on 70Â cm use either equipment purpose-built for ham radio, or commercial equipment designed for nearby land mobile frequencies. Amateurs usually use the band for FM or digital voice communications through repeaters (useful for emergency communications), as well narrow band modes (analog and digital) for long-distance communications (called &quot;DX&quot;, including Moon bounce). The band is also popular for Amateur Satellite Service. Due to its size, it&#x27;s the lowest frequency ham band which can support amateur television transmissions.

==Band allocation==
The band&#x27;s allocation varies regionally. In the United States and Trinidad and Tobago, the band ranges from 420 to 450 MHz with some geographical limitations. In Canada and Australia, the band is 430â450Â MHz. In the UK, amateurs are allocated 430â440Â MHz. By international treaty between the US and Canada, operation in the portion of the band from 420 to 430Â MHz is prohibited north of Line A, which runs just south of the CanadaâUS border from Washington state to Maine, and east of Line C, which runs from northeast to southeast Alaska.

== Propagation characteristics ==
70-centimeter propagation characteristics lie midway between 2-meter and 33-centimeter (~900Â MHz) bands. Above 200Â MHz, as frequency increases, building penetration is reduced. Smaller obstacles may also block or reflect the signal. However, higher frequencies also present a lower noise floor, making it easier to overcome both natural and artificial interference, especially prevalent in urban environments.

== Comparison of the 2-meter and 70-centimeter bands ==
Propagation considerations often take a back seat to channel availability or economic concerns in system planning. One practical concern when comparing the 70-centimeter band to the 2-meter band is that a quarter-wavelength antenna is much less unwieldy at 70 centimeters than it is at 2 meters. Portable antennas for 2 meters are generally continuously loaded coil spring or &quot;rubber duck&quot; types, while on 70 centimeters they can be a full quarter wavelength. The difference can be as much as 8Â dB. The primary advantage of 70 centimeters is that base station antennas of very significant gain (up to 11Â dB or so) are practical while 6Â dB is about the practical limit on 2m. The extra 5Â dB of receive and transmit gain are often critical for long-range communication, particularly for high-power repeaters which can then concentrate all of their power and receive sensitivity at the horizon.

The 70-centimeter amateur band also provides a wider spectrum than the 2-meter band (in the U.S., this is 30Â MHz of spectrum, compared to only 4Â MHz on the 2-meter band). This allows for many more channels, accommodating fast scan television, wideband digital modes, and point-to-point linking, which may not be permitted on 2-meter and lower frequencies, depending on local regulations.

A problem found with all UHF and higher frequencies is the prevalence of multipath signals. The reflective properties of the 70-centimeter band allow signals to be reflected by dense and solid material such as cement or rock. This creates a slight time delay between the primary and reflected signals, causing cancellations as direct and reflected signals are combined in the receiving antenna. This can cause receiving stations to experience rapid fluctuations in signal strength, or &quot;picket fencing&quot;, when they are in motion. The problem is much less severe with modern FM systems because the receiver&#x27;s limiter circuitry compensates for variations in received signal strength over a very wide amplitude range. In properly engineered systems, multipath can also be reduced by assuring that the transmitter uses only the minimum necessary power, allowing the reflected signals to be lower than the receiver&#x27;s detection threshold.

70 centimeters is very close to the third harmonic of 2 meters, which allows sufficiently broadband 2âmeter antennas to be used for 70 centimeters. Antennas specifically designed to work on both bands are common. Also, 2 meters is far enough away from 70 centimeters to make diplexers small and simple, making it easy to cross-band repeat signals between the two bands with a single dual-band radio.

==Use for the radio control hobbies==

In some countries, particularly Germany (until the end of 2008) and Switzerland, a portion of the 70Â cm band overlaps with a secondary frequency allocation for the operation of Radio control models. In Germany, 33 frequencies were available for RC use, and in Switzerland, ten frequencies are available. These frequencies fall within the LPD433 band used by short range devices in Europe.

In North America, licensed amateurs may conduct RC operations in the 70Â cm band, but unlike similar operations in the 6-meter band, no specific frequencies have been set aside for RC use. American radio amateurs may use a maximum of one watt of radiated RF power, on any ham frequency authorized for data emissions, to control RC models. Canadian radio amateurs may use any amateur frequency above 30Â MHz for the control of RC models.

Plus or minus 5Â MHz is a common repeater frequency offset in the 70Â cm band.

<doc id="804169" wikidata="Q660123" url="?curid=804169" title="Spreadeagle (position)">
<text>The spreadeagle (also spelled spread eagle or spread-eagle) is the position in which a person has their arms outstretched and legs apart, figuratively resembling an eagle with wings spread. It is a style that appears commonly in nature and geometry. In human style, it is represented by the letter &quot;X&quot;.

The spreadeagle position is frequently seen in various fields of human activity, particularly sports. It is commonly used in Olympic weightlifting, cheerleading, freestyle skiing, gymnastics, basketball, swimming and dance such as contemporary ballet. The spread eagle in figure skating is one of the moves in the field which makes the sport particularly associated with the position. It is also practiced in sky diving and appears in rock climbing and freestyle motocross.

==Sex position==
The term &quot;spread eagle&quot; is used for sex positions where one of the partners adopts all or part of a spreadeagle position. One of the simplest versions has the lower partner lying on their back facing upwards (supine) with their arms and legs spread wide apart. It is a variant of the missionary position and it allows for deep sexual penetration. This position is also used for manual stimulation such as erotic massage of the G-spot or clitoral stimulation using the fingers or a sex toy. Clitoral stimulation can be performed by either partner and can be combined with penetrative sex. The position is also popular for oral sex which can be combined with vaginal massage. It is a comfortable position for the receiving partner to maintain, though the person providing the stimulation may experience neck discomfort. This may make it difficult for them to remain in place long enough for the receiving partner to reach orgasm.

There are a number of variations on the position. The reverse spreadeagle position is a less common version in which the lower partner lies facing down (prone). It is a variant of the doggy style position. If one leg is straight while the other is bent, the position is called the &quot;broken eagle&quot;.

The variant known as the &quot;eagle&quot;â or &quot;peace sign&quot; involves the lower partner lying on their back and holding their legs in the air spread wide apart in a &quot;V&quot; shape, though the arms are not usually spread. It is said to be better for stimulating the G-spot due to the angle of penetration. This can be done using a penis or a G-spot vibrator. The position is used for both vaginal and anal sex. The &quot;piledriver&quot; sex position, which is similar except that the lower partner&#x27;s bottom is raised into the air to bring their feet close to the ground, can also be modified into a spread eagle version if the lower partner spreads their legs. This is sometimes called the &quot;soaring eagle&quot;.

The &quot;standing eagle&quot; variation adapts the spreadeagle to a vertical position. Typically the partner whose legs are spread is either pinned against a wall or stands on one leg and spreads the other. A variant exists that is easier for partners of different heights: one partner rests on the edge of a counter or bed with their legs spread while the other stands and penetrates them. Another vertical adaptation making use of furniture is the &quot;sofa spreadeagle&quot;: one partner stands on the edge of a bed or sofa or balances on two chairs and squats to allow for standing penetration.

The legs are also spread during the lesbian sexual practice known as scissoring.

==BDSM==

The spread eagle position is also employed as a bondage position in BDSM play, with the submissive fastened to a bed, specially constructed table, sometimes face down or other equipment. The wrists and ankles are typically either fastened with ropes or with bondage cuffs attached to straps. Alternatively spreader bars are used to keep the wearer&#x27;s legs or arms a set distance apart and produce a spread eagle position lying on the back or front.

An X-cross, a stationary bondage frame in the shape of an X, is often found in BDSM dungeons. It is designed to position and restrain a submissive in a spreadeagle position, restrained at the wrists, ankles and sometimes waist. X-crosses are typically vertical if wall-mounted or lean back at a slight angle if freestanding, and hence they restrain the subject in a standing spread eagle position. Alternatively this can also be achieved using ropes or chains attached to different endpoints.

A spreader bar suspended from the ceiling provides wrist attachment points for a vertical spread eagle position, either standing or hanging. A hanging spread eagle position is also used in suspension bondage, for which wooden or steel bondage rigs are sometimes found in BDSM dungeons. Spreader bars can also be used with subjects who are kneeling on all fours to give access to the buttocks, genitals and anal region.

Bondage in a spread eagle position provides immobility combined with a feeling of helplessness. It typically leaves much of the body available for BDSM play. This may include impact play, particularly if the subject is oriented with the back and buttocks exposed. Alternatively, if the front of the subject is exposed, erotic teasing may be undertaken.

Using the technique known an honor bondage, an unrestrained submissive may be commanded to assume a spreadeagle position, either standing with or without support or laying down, and not move. This produces extreme vulnerability and can be a source of erotic humiliation.

==Military punishment==
During the American Civil War, soldiers convicted of theft, sleeping on duty, or cowardice could be punished by being tied spreadeagled to a large wooden wheel for five to six hours.

<text>The Slade Professorship of Fine Art is the oldest professorship of art and art history at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and University College, London.

==History==
The chairs were founded concurrently in 1869 by a bequest from the art collector and philanthropist Felix Slade, with studentships also created at University College London. The studentships allowed for the creation of the Slade School of Art, now part of University College London, whose Director holds the Slade Professorship. They are normally therefore a practising artist.

The chair at Oxford is a visiting professorship, with duties restricted to a series of eight public lectures per year, on the &quot;History, Theory, and Practice of the Fine Arts&quot;, to which four seminars have been added from 2011. The professorship is associated with All Souls College, Oxford. The bequest was also indirectly responsible for the foundation of the Ruskin School of Drawing in Oxford, which was financed by the first Oxford professor, John Ruskin, who announced his intention in his inaugural lecture &quot;to the general dismay of his listeners&quot;.

The Cambridge Lectures are also a series of eight public lectures by a visiting professor. The Oxford and Cambridge professors are most often art historians or critics, but some artists have held the posts, especially at Oxford. The lectures are often subsequently published in book version.

<text>The San Francisco Botanical Garden at Strybing Arboretum (formerly Strybing Arboretum) is located in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park. Its 55 acres (22.3 ha) represents nearly 9,000 different kinds of plants from around the world, with particular focus on Magnolia species, high elevation palms, conifers, and cloud forest species from Central America, South America and Southeast Asia.

San Francisco&#x27;s County Fair Building is located near the main entrance to the Garden.

The San Francisco Botanical Garden is now one of the three locations of the Gardens of Golden Gate Park, along with the Japanese Tea Garden and the Conservatory of Flowers.

==History==

Plans for the garden were originally laid out in the 1880s by park supervisor John McLaren, but funding was insufficient to begin construction until Helene Strybing left a major bequest in 1927. Planting was begun in 1937 with WPA funds supplemented by local donations, and the Arboretum officially opened in May 1940. As a part of Golden Gate Park, it is officially managed by the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department, but the San Francisco Botanical Garden Society plays an important role in providing educational programs, managing volunteers, curatorial staff, and more. Formed in 1955, the San Francisco Botanical Garden Society (formerly the Strybing Arboretum Society) operates the Helen Crocker Russell Library of Horticulture, Garden Bookstore, and monthly plant sales, and offers a wide range of community education programs for children and adults. The Society also raises money for new projects and Garden renovations.

In 2004, Strybing Arboretum changed its name to San Francisco Botanical Garden at Strybing Arboretum, and the Arboretum Society followed suit, becoming San Francisco Botanical Garden Society at Strybing Arboretum.

==Plant collections==

The gardens are organized into several specialized collections:
* Mediterranean
**California Native
** John Muir Nature Trail
** Redwood Grove
** Chile
** South Africa
** Australia
** Mediterranean Basin Region 
* Mild-temperate climate 
** New Zealand
** Moon-viewing Garden â a Japanese design
** Temperate Asia Garden
* Montane tropic 
** Mesoamerican Cloud Forest
** Southeast Asian Cloud Forest (in development)
** Andean Cloud Forest (in development)
* Specialty collections
** Ancient Plant Garden 
** Succulent garden 
** Dwarf Conifer garden
** Exhibition Garden
** Garden of Fragrance
** Zellerbach Garden of Perennials
** Dry Mexico
** Rhododendron Garden
** Magnolias &amp; Camellias (found in many collections)

The mild Mediterranean climate is ideal for plants from surprisingly many parts of the world; the arboretum does not include greenhouses for species requiring other climate types.

<text>Albert Ramsdell Gurney Jr. (November 1, 1930 â June 13, 2017) (sometimes credited as Pete Gurney) was an American playwright, novelist and academic.

Gurney is known for plays including &quot;The Dining Room&quot; (1982), &quot;Sweet Sue&quot; (1986/7), &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot; (1988), and for his Pulitzer Prize nominated play &quot;Love Letters&quot; (1988). His series of plays about upper-class WASP life in contemporary America have been called &quot;penetratingly witty studies of the WASP ascendancy in retreat.&quot;

==Early life==
Gurney was born on November 1, 1930, in Buffalo, New York, to Albert Ramsdell Gurney Sr. (1896â1977), who was president of Gurney, Becker and Bourne, an insurance and real estate company in Buffalo, and Marion Spaulding (1908-2001). His parents had three children, of which Gurney was the middle: (1) Evelyn Gurney Miller (b. 1929), (2) Albert Ramsdell Gurney Jr. (b. 1930), and (3) Stephen S. Gurney (b. 1933).

His maternal grandparents were Elbridge G. Spaulding (1881â1974) and Marion Caryl Ely (1887â1971). Ely was the daughter of William Caryl Ely (1856â1921), politician and lawyer, Member of the New York State Assembly in 1883. Gurney&#x27;s 2x great-grandfather was Elbridge G. Spaulding (1809â1897), a former Mayor of Buffalo, NY State Treasurer, and member of the U.S. House of Representatives who supported the idea for the first U.S. currency not backed by gold or silver, thus credited with helping to keep the Union economy afloat during the Civil War.

Gurney attended the private school Nichols School in Buffalo and graduating from St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire. He attended Williams College, graduating in 1952, and the Yale School of Drama, graduating in 1958, after which he began teaching Humanities at MIT.

==Career==
In 1959, following graduation from Yale, Gurney taught English and Latin at a day school, Belmont Hill School, in Belmont, Massachusetts, for one year. He then joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a professor of humanities (1960â96) and professor of literature (1970â96).

He began writing plays such as &quot;Children&quot; and &quot;The Middle Ages&quot; while at MIT, but it was his great success with &quot;The Dining Room&quot; that allowed him to write full-time. After &quot;The Dining Room&quot;, Gurney wrote a number of plays, most of them concerning WASPs of the American northeast. While at Yale, Gurney also wrote &quot;Love in Buffalo&quot;, the first musical ever produced at the Yale School of Drama. Since then, he is known to be a prolific writer.

His first play in New York, which ran for just one performance in October 1968, &quot;The David Show&quot;, premiered at the Players&#x27; Theater on MacDougal Street. The play was cut after its first show by sneers from the entire press except for two enthusiasts, Edith Oliver in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and another from the &quot;Village Voice&quot;.

His 2015 play, &quot;Love and Money&quot;, is about a mature woman making plans to dispose of her fortune, and the twists that ensue. The world premiere was at New York&#x27;s Signature Theatre in August 2015. Before that, &quot;The Grand Manner&quot;, a play about his real life encounter with famed actress Katharine Cornell in her production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, was produced and performed by Lincoln Center for the summer of 2010. It was also produced in Buffalo by the Kavinoky Theatre. He appeared in several of his plays including &quot;The Dining Room&quot; and most notably &quot;Love Letters&quot;.

==Personal life==
In June, 1957, Gurney married Molly Goodyear, a granddaughter of Anson Goodyear. They lived in Boston until 1983, when they moved their family to New York to be near the theater, television, and publishers while he was on sabbatical from MIT. Together, they had four children:

* George Goodyear Gurney, who married Constance &quot;Connie&quot; Lyman Warren in 1985.
* Amy Ramsdell Gurney, who married Frederick Snow Nicholas III in 1985.
* Evelyn &quot;Evie&quot; R. Gurney
* Benjamin Gurney

Gurney&#x27;s father, Albert Ramsdell Gurney Sr., died in 1977 and Molly&#x27;s mother, Sarah Norton, died in 1978. After their deaths, his mother, Marion, married Molly&#x27;s father, George, and remained married until Marion&#x27;s death in 2001, followed by George&#x27;s death in 2002.

===Death===
Gurney died at his home in Manhattan, on June 13, 2017, at the age of 86.

==Awards and honors==
In 2006, Gurney was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

In 2007, Gurney received the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award as a master American dramatist.

Gurney was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 Obie Awards presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Village Voice.

==Literary work==
===Themes===
Gurney&#x27;s plays often explore the theme of declining upper-class &quot;WASP&quot; (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) life in contemporary America. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; has called his works &quot;penetratingly witty studies of the WASP ascendancy in retreat.&quot; Several of his works are loosely based on his patrician upbringing, including &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot; and &quot;Indian Blood&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; drama critic Frank Rich, in his review of &quot;The Dining Room&quot;, wrote, &quot;As a chronicler of contemporary America&#x27;s most unfashionable social stratumâupper-middle-class WASPs, this playwright has no current theatrical peer.&quot;

In his 1988 play, &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot;, the lead character tells her playwright son that theater critics &quot;don&#x27;t like us... They resent us. They think we&#x27;re all Republicans, all superficial and all alcoholics. Only the latter [&quot;sic&quot;] is true.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the play as witty observations about a nearly extinct patrician class that regards psychiatry as an affront to good manners, underpaid hired help as a birthright.

In a 1989 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Gurney said, &quot;Just as it&#x27;s mentioned in &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot;,&#x27; my great-grandfather hung up his clothes one day and walked into the Niagara River and no one understood why.&quot; Gurney added that &quot;he was a distinguished man in Buffalo. My father could never mention it, and it affected the family well into the fourth generation as a dark and unexplainable gesture. It made my father and his father desperate to be accepted, to be conventional, and comfortable. It made them commit themselves to an ostensibly easy bourgeois world. They saw it so precariously, but the reason was never mentioned. I first learned about it after my father died.&quot;

Gurney told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1982:
WASPs do have a cultureâtraditions, idiosyncrasies, quirks, particular signals and totems we pass on to one another. But the WASP culture, or at least that aspect of the culture I talk about, is enough in the past so that we can now look at it with some objectivity, smile at it, and even appreciate some of its values. There was a closeness of family, a commitment to duty, to stoic responsibility, which I think we have to say weren&#x27;t entirely bad.&quot;

<doc id="804186" wikidata="Q1047366" url="?curid=804186" title="Cash Money Records">
<text>Cash Money Records is an American record label founded in 1991 by brothers Ronald &quot;Slim&quot; Williams and Bryan &quot;Baby&quot; Williams. The label gained prominence in the late 1990s for having signed and released albums for New Orleansâbased musical acts including Lil Wayne, Juvenile, B.G., and Hot Boys. It became an imprint of Universal Records, a division of Universal Music Group in March 1998, and remained so during its following iterations as Universal Republic, Universal Motown and ultimately Republic Records.

In the late 2000s, Cash Money signed and released projects for a number of prominent hip hop artists, including Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Tyga. Wayne launched Young Money Entertainment in 2005, which operated as an imprint of the label and Republic Records until 2018âa joint venture colloquially branded as Young Money Cash Money Billionaires (abbreviated as YMCMB). The label has been commonly regarded as among the most successful urban contemporary music labels of the 2000s to 2010s.

The label has released a total of 12 number one albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and seven number one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart: Juvenile&#x27;s &quot;Slow Motion&quot;, Lil Wayne&#x27;s &quot;Lollipop&quot;, Jay Sean&#x27;s &quot;Down&quot;, and Drake&#x27;s &quot;One Dance&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s Plan&quot;, &quot;Nice for What&quot;, and &quot;In My Feelings&quot;.

The label&#x27;s name alludes to the Cash Money Brothers, drug kingpin Nino Brown&#x27;s gang from the 1991 crime film &quot;New Jack City&quot;.

== History ==

=== 1991â1997: Beginnings ===
Bryan Williams, also known as Birdman, told some of his close friends the motivation for starting the label:

I was hoping it would get us out of the projects and into a positive way of life. And we wanted to help other people get out of this poverty...
Cash Money&#x27;s first artist, New Orleansâbased rapper Kilo G, issued his debut album, &quot;The Sleepwalker&quot;, in 1992 as the label&#x27;s first release. The label then signed the hip hop group U.N.L.V., composed of rappers Lil Ya, Tec 9 and Yella Boy. They released the projects &quot;6th &amp; Baronne&quot; (1993), &quot;Mac Melph Calio&quot; (1995), and &quot;Uptown 4 Life&quot; (1996) under the label. They were some of the original bounce rappers that help create a sound in New Orleans, along with the label&#x27;s following releases. Kilo G&#x27;s second and final album, &quot;The Bloody City&quot; (1995), was the label&#x27;s first project to be produced entirely by Mannie Fresh, who would do so on most of the label&#x27;s following releases. Kilo G was murdered in 1997. From 1993 to 1995, the label signed several other hip hop artists in the New Orleans area, including B.G., Lil Wayne, and Juvenile, each of whom already had buzz in the streets.

By this time, Turk and another local rapper by the name of Bulletproof (a.k.a. Lil Derrick; born Derrick Williams, Birdman&#x27;s nephew) joined the roster. In May 1997, Birdman organized the rap group Hot Boys, which at the time included Juvenile, Turk, B.G. and Bulletproof. Lil Wayne later joined the group, shortly after the death of his father. Bulletproof was voted out the group before recording any major releases, according to Turk. Bulletproof, who referred to himself as the #2 Stunna, was later killed in 2002. 

Cash Money&#x27;s commercial breakthrough came in 1998 when the Hot BoysâB.G. and Juvenile in particularâcaught the attention of Universal Records executives. Wendy Day effectively negotiated a deal between Cash Money and the Universal Music Group (UMG) subsidiary (known currently as Republic Records), which became a 70%-30% distribution deal. Later, UMG acquired a portion of Cash Money Records, making it a subsidiary of the company.

=== 1998â2000 Universal Records deal ===

Cash Money signed a three-year, $30 million distribution deal with Universal Records in March 1998, under which the Williams brothers were given a $2 million advance each year and a credit of $1.5 million for each of the six artists that they had at the time. After recouping, Universal Records would retain 15% of profits from album sales, while Cash Money retained 85%, as well as 50% of their publishing royalties and ownership of all master recordings. Dino Delvaille, who orchestrated the deal, later told HitQuarters: &quot;I made certain they retained (the rights) of their work. They deserve it.&quot; Cash Money&#x27;s first success under Universal was Juvenile&#x27;s November 1998 release, &quot;400 Degreez&quot;. The album peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 and would ultimately go on to sell over five million copies worldwide. The success of 400 Degreez solidified Cash Money as a powerhouse label in the national hip-hop scene. The album featured guest appearances from Cash Money artists Turk, Lil Wayne, B.G., Baby, and Mannie Fresh (both individually and as their groups the Hot Boys and Big Tymers), as well as a guest appearance from Jay-Z, the first time an East Coast rapper collaborated with Cash Money.
After the deal, Cash Money achieved a new level of success. Later albums in 1999 such as the Hot Boys&#x27; &quot;Guerrilla Warfare&quot;, B.G.&#x27;s &quot;Chopper City in the Ghetto&quot;, and Lil Wayne&#x27;s &quot;Tha Block Is Hot&quot; also saw great chart success, were all certified Platinum by the RIAA, and furthered the label&#x27;s reputation. These albums contained major Billboard hits such as Juvenile&#x27;s &quot;Back That Azz Up&quot; (#19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), B.G.&#x27;s &quot;Bling Bling&quot; (#36), and the Hot Boys&#x27; &quot;I Need a Hot Girl&quot; (#65). All of Cash Money&#x27;s albums and singles in this period were solely produced by the label&#x27;s in-house producer, Mannie Fresh. Their A&amp;R at Universal, Dino Delvaille, said:

When they first came into the business, they were very reluctant to make records with other people. They probably felt that people would steal their style or flavor, and I had to work hard to get them to open up to making records with Cam&#x27;ron, Puffy, and Clipse, among others.

=== 2000â2012: Continued success and various signings ===

The label&#x27;s success continued into the 2000s. Between 2001 and 2003, the label sold 7 million albums. The song &quot;Still Fly&quot; by the Big Tymers was nominated for two Grammy Awards. However, B.G. and Juvenile left the label by 2002, claiming financial mismanagement. In April 2003, Juvenile returned to the label for a reported $4 million deal, and in return, he signed over the rights to &quot;Juve The Great&quot;, an album which sold over a million copies and contained the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 hit &quot;Slow Motion&quot;. In 2007, former Hot Boys member Lil Wayne was named president of Cash Money Records and CEO of Young Money Entertainment. Later that year, Lil Wayne stepped down as president to focus on his career, especially &quot;Tha Carter III&quot;. In 2008, Lil Wayne re-signed with Cash Money, ensuring that his next few albums will be produced by the label.
In September 2008, Cash Money released rocker Kevin Rudolf&#x27;s smash-hit debut single &quot;Let It Rock&quot; featuring label-mate Lil Wayne. On October 15, 2008, at the MOBO Awards, British R&amp;B singer Jay Sean announced that he had signed with Cash Money Records. In February 2009, the Williams brothers were featured in CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Newbos: The Rise of America&#x27;s New Black Overclass&quot;, a documentary show profiling several black multi-millionaires. In early 2009, it was announced that former Roc-A-Fella Records artist Freeway signed with the label, although he was never officially signed to the label. On August 16, 2009, Bow Wow announced that he signed with Cash Money Records.

In 2009, they took part in a major label bidding war for Queens native rapper Nicki Minaj. Eventually, they won the bidding war and Nicki Minaj was signed to them exclusively for Young Money. Cash Money Records popularity grew after signing Minaj and Canadian rapper Drake. On August 5, 2010, production group Cool &amp; Dre signed with Cash Money Records. The production group announced the news via Twitter. They are the first in house producer Cash Money has had since Mannie Fresh.

On August 19, 2010, Birdman signed DJ Khaled to the label, also signing his label We the Best Music Group as a subsidiary of Cash Money. On February 24, 2012, Cash Money Records signed the nu metal band Limp Bizkit. Wayne said the same day they were close to signing Ashanti.

In 2011, Cash Money Records signed a co-publishing venture with the Atria Publishing Group called Cash Money Content.

=== 2013â2017: Rich Gang and dissension ===
In February 2013, Birdman released a compilation mixtape with Cash Money and Young Money, entitled &quot;Rich Gang: All Stars&quot;. Shortly afterwards, he announced a compilation album entitled &quot;Rich Gang: Flashy Lifestyle&quot; that was due to be released on May 21, 2013âit featured members of Cash Money, Young Money, and various collaborators. The first single from the project, &quot;Tapout&quot; was released on March 19, 2013, and features Lil Wayne, Future, Mack Maine, and Nicki Minaj, with production by 808 Mafia&#x27;s Southside and TM88. &quot;Fly Rich&quot; featuring Stevie J, Future, Tyga, Meek Mill and Mystikal was also released as a promotional single.

The album&#x27;s release date was then pushed back to July 23, 2013, while the title was also shortened to just &quot;Rich Gang&quot;. The album garnered a mixed critical reception and debuted at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

On December 4, 2014, just five days before &quot;Tha Carter V&quot; was due to be released, Wayne issued a statement saying the album would not be released on its expected release date due to his displeasure with Birdman refusing to release the album, although it had been completed. Wayne also expressed his feelings by stating he felt he and his creative partner were being held &quot;prisoner&quot;. Lil Wayne filed a lawsuit. On January 20, 2015, Wayne self-released &quot;Sorry 4 the Wait 2&quot;, a sequel to his 2011 mixtape, to compensate for the continued delay of &quot;Tha Carter V&quot;. Upon &quot;Sorry for the Wait 2&quot;â³s release, it was noted that Wayne disses Birdman and Cash Money Records several times throughout. Birdman was reported to be upset with this. In late January 2015, Lil Wayne filed a $51 million lawsuit against Birdman and Cash Money over the delay of &quot;Tha Carter V&quot;.

In January 2015, Wayne stated that when he leaves Cash Money, he would take Drake and Nicki Minaj with him. On June 22, TMZ reported new details on the lawsuit. According to documents filed by Lil Wayne, Birdman and Cash Money have mismanaged Young Money, including Drake and Minaj. The documents allege that Birdman and Cash Money haven&#x27;t paid people. In June 2015, Wayne joined Jay-Z&#x27;s Tidal as an artist owner and exclusively released a single on the service titled &quot;Glory&quot;. On July 4, 2015, Wayne released &quot;Free Weezy Album&quot; exclusively through Tidal under Young Money and Republic Records. On July 15, prosecutors allege Birdman and Young Thug conspired to murder Lil Wayne and were involved in the April 26 shooting. On July 16, Birdman filed a $50 million lawsuit against Jay Z&#x27;s Tidal streaming service over Lil Wayne&#x27;s &quot;Free Weezy Album&quot;. The lawsuit claims that Cash Money Records exclusively owns the rights to Lil Wayne&#x27;s music, although he is now independent and the label no longer owns these rights.

On April 12, 2017, Birdman accepted a plaque in honor of Cash Money Records having sold one billion units. On September 13, 2018, it was announced that Young Money was no longer a joint business venture with Cash Money. Ownership of the imprint was granted entirely to Lil Wayne as part of the legal settlements with Birdman that were finalized.

=== Rich Gang ===

Rich Gang is a hip hop collective and side project introduced by Birdman in 2013, initially composed of members from the Cash Money Records roster. The group&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Tapout&quot; (featuring Future) was released in March 2013. Georgia rappers Young Thug and Rich Homie Quan became the core of the Rich Gang, debuting with guest appearances on the group&#x27;s 2014 single &quot;Lifestyle&quot;. The duo were also the primary artists on &quot;Rich Gang: Tha Tour Pt. 1&quot; (2014). Later &quot;Rich Gang&quot; membersâsuch as Derez De&#x27;Shon, Robb Banks, and Money Manâwere part of the group despite not being signed to Cash Money as solo artists.

=== Production wing ===

From its founding until 2005, Mannie Fresh was the well-known production head of all Cash Money releases, as the label&#x27;s resident producer. The label would be without a proper in-house producer until August 2010, when production duo Cool &amp; Dre signed to the label. Since then, the label has grown its production division by signing more producers.

== Legal issues ==

In October 2009, Cash Money Records, Birdman, Lil Wayne and various music distribution outlets were sued for copyright infringement by Thomas Marasciullo, who claims his voice was used without permission. The rappers asked him to record some &quot;Italian-styled spoken word recordings&quot; in 2006. The lyrics were allegedly used on &quot;Respect&quot; and other tracks from the rappers&#x27; collaboration album &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot; and Birdman&#x27;s &quot;5 * Stunna&quot;.

In 2011, Cash Money Records, Lil Wayne, Universal Music Group, and Young Money Entertainment were sued for by Done Deal Enterprises, who claim Lil Wayne&#x27;s song &quot;BedRock&quot; was stolen from Done Deal.

<text>Total is an American R&amp;B girl group and one of the signature acts of the Bad Boy Records imprint during the mid-1990s. The group consists of founding members Kima Raynor, Keisha Spivey, and Pamela Long. Total is best known for their feature on Mase&#x27;s &quot;What You Want&quot;, as well as their hits &quot;Kissin&#x27; You&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t You See&quot; (featuring The Notorious B.I.G.), and &quot;What About Us?&quot; and &quot;Trippin, both featuring Missy Elliott. Long also sung the chorus of The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s hit song &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, although she was not officially credited. Total made their first appearance singing the hook on The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Juicy&quot;, widely considered one of the greatest hip-hop songs of all time.

In 2019, Pamela Long announced that she is working on her debut solo album. She released a video for her single &quot;Why&quot;.

==Career==
The trio made their first appearance singing the hook on The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Juicy&quot;. Garnering attention for the new group, they were also featured on the original version and &quot;Hip Hop Remix&quot; of his next single &quot;One More Chance&quot;. They then immediately hit the studio with Bad Boy Records CEO Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs and began work on their debut album. The first single &quot;Can&#x27;t You See?&quot; first appeared on the soundtrack to 1995 motion picture, &quot;New Jersey Drive&quot;. The song featured The Notorious B.I.G. and peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as well as #2 on the R&amp;B Chart. Their self-titled debut album was released nearly a year after the single. Total produced two more R&amp;B top ten singles including: &quot;No One Else&quot; (and its remix featuring Lil&#x27; Kim, Foxy Brown, and Da Brat) and &#x27;&quot;Kissing You&quot; (and its remix featuring Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs). The album was certified platinum by the RIAA.
While recording their second album, they appeared on numerous top ten singles, including LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;Loungin (Who Do Ya Luv)&quot;, Foxy Brown&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t&quot;, and Mase&#x27;s &quot;What You Want&quot; featuring Keisha Epps, and Pamela Long sung the chorus on the hit &quot;Hypnotize&quot; by The Notorious B.I.G. The group also released another single, the Missy Elliott and Timbaland track &quot;What About Us?&quot; from the &quot;Soul Food&quot; soundtrack.
Their follow-up album, &quot;Kima, Keisha, and Pam&quot;, debuted to strong reviews, sales, and was certified gold by the RIAA. The first single, another Missy Elliott collaboration, &quot;Trippin, reached the top ten of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Their next release, &quot;Sitting Home&quot;, which made Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Singles did not garner the same attention. While in heavy rotation on video networks like BET, radio chose not to play the song. A remix of the track featured rap artist Shyne.
After the release of &quot;Kima, Keisha, and Pam&quot;, the girls sang the chorus to rap duo Gang Starr&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;Discipline&quot; and, in 2000, they were featured on the Tony Touch single &quot;(I Wonder Why) He&#x27;s the Greatest DJ&quot;. They also contributed to the songs &quot;Crave&quot; to &quot;3 Strikes&quot; and the songs &quot;Quick Rush&quot; to &quot;Bait&quot; movie soundtrack.
In their last official appearance together, they were thanked in the credits for their collaboration with Da Beatminerz and Talib Kweli - &quot;Anti-Love Movement&quot; in 2001 from their album &quot;Brace 4 Impak&quot;.
===Comeback===
In 2014, Long and Dyson reunited and began performing as a duo under the &quot;Total&quot; name. On November 30, 2014, Total joined Lil&#x27; Kim, Da Brat, Missy Elliott, and Left Eye (posthumously via video) to sing &quot;Not Tonight (Ladies Night)&quot; at the 2014 Soul Train Music Awards. Angie Martinez was the only living original performer who did not perform at the event.
In May 2015, Total toured with R. Kelly, on the Funk Fest tour. In 2016, Spivey Epps rejoined the group for the nationwide Bad Boy Family Reunion Tour.

=== Currently ===
Most recently, it is rumored that Kima has rejoined the group and an additional fourth member has been added and that Total are now at work on a new album.

* Keisha Spivey married actor Omar Epps in 2006 and is living in California. They have daughter K&#x27;marie and son Amir together; as well as Omar&#x27;s daughter Aiyanna Yasmine with ex wife Yusra Salama.

* Pamela Long still lives in New Jersey. She is a faithful member at Agape Family Worship Center located in Rahway.

*A track by Kima featuring her sister, rapper Vita, called &quot;What U Want&quot;, also recently leaked. As of 2008, Total have no desire or interest in pursuing to reband.

In 2024 Epps and Dyson came back together without Long and joined the Queens of R&amp;B Tour along Xscape, SWV, 702 and MÃ½a.

== Accidents ==
Since 1997, Keikyu has had five accidents, all of which were on the main line, in the vicinity of Yokosuka and Yokohama.

On 7 April 1997, at about 2:47 pm, the first three cars of a four-car train derailed after colliding with a mudslide, resulting in 22 people injured. The accident occurred between Keikyu-Taura(In Japanese:äº¬æ¥ç°æµ¦) and Anjinzuka (In Japanese:å®éå¡ or æéå¡) stations, with approximately 60 people on board. Heavy rains caused the mudslide, 7 months after a report by the train company to the Transportation Minister that there was little probability of such an occurrence in that area. 500 workers were mobilized as the train service was temporarily suspended between Kanazawa-Hakkei and Horinouchi Stations.

On 24 November 2000, at about 5:20 am, the front car of a four-car train derailed after a truck collided with the first car of the train at a railroad crossing, resulting in 3 passengers being slightly injured. The accident occurred in Yokosuka and the approximately 100 commuters on board later walked about 200 m to the nearest station to continue their commute via bus. The driver of the truck reported his foot became stuck between the accelerator and brake pedals, sending him through the crossing bar and into the crossing. Normal operations continued about 4 hours later that morning.

On 24 September 2012, at about 11:58 pm, the first three cars of an eight-car train derailed after colliding with a mudslide, resulting in injuries to 28 people including the train driver. 7 men and women were seriously injured, including fractures, broken ribs and pelvises. The accident occurred between Oppama and Keikyu Taura stations, between Yokohama and Yokosuka, with approximately 700 passengers on board. Heavy rains caused the mudslide, sweeping away safety nets that had been installed in 1998, the year after a similar mudslide in the area. An area of soil about 12 meters high and 15 meters wide fell onto the tracks, bringing trees and fencing structures with it. The train was travelling 75Â km/h before the driver applied the brakes, 30 to 40 meters before the mudslide. Train services were temporarily suspended between Kanazawa-Hakkei and Hemi stations and temporary bus services were provided by the train company until normal operations resumed approximately hours later after the assessment and clean-up process.

On 18 April 2013, at about 4:30 pm, two window panes shattered in the front car of a local commuter train while passing an express train going the opposite direction, resulting in minor cuts to two high school students sitting with their backs to the windows. One window pane was also cracked on the passing train with no injuries. The accident occurred between Taura and Anjinzuka stations, with approximately 30 people in that car at the time of the accident.

On 5 September 2019 a limited express train crashed into a truck in nearby Kanagawa-Shinmachi Station. There were 33 injuries and 1 death (truck driver).

<text>In the United States, a spin room, also known as spin row or spin alley, is an area in which reporters can speak with debate participants and/or their representatives after a debate. The name refers to the fact that the participants will attempt to &quot;spin&quot; or influence the perception of the debate among the assembled reporters. The benefit for reporters is that they quickly get in-person interviews with debaters or their representatives, complete with audio, video, and photos. For a U.S. presidential debate, the number of reporters in the spin room can number into the thousands.

==History==
The earliest recorded spin room was set up by the Reagan Campaign in 1984. In a hotel banquet room, campaign officials spoke on the record with talking points playing up their own candidate&#x27;s debate performance and minimizing opponent Walter Mondale&#x27;s success, despite many observers believing Mondale had won. This operation was dubbed the &quot;spin patrol.&quot;

A spin room may also be active before a debate. A common form of pre-debate spin is for each side to try to raise expectations for the opposing debater and lower expectations for their own team, a pursuit known as playing the &quot;expectations game&quot;.

During the 2020 U.S. general election debates, in order to reduce person-to-person viral contagion during the COVID-19 pandemic, the physical spin room was entirely supplanted by digital campaign operations and remote interviews with media surrogates while reporters watched the debate from home.

==Criticism==
Some observers have criticized the overt nature of the media manipulation in spin rooms, and the media&#x27;s willing participation in it. Defenders have said reporters know it&#x27;s scripted and aren&#x27;t persuaded by the spin, but rather, they use the talking points to analyze candidates&#x27; strategies. Spin rooms can occasionally include moments of candor, such as when presidential candidate Rick Perry admitted that he had &quot;stepped in it&quot; during a debate response that became known as his &quot;oops&quot; moment.

Spin rooms have also been portrayed as outdated in an era of instant online reaction from all quarters before a debate is even over. Focus groups and instant post-debate &quot;snap polls&quot; attempt to provide a more scientific method than spin rooms in determining who has won a debate.

<doc id="804194" wikidata="Q1785006" url="?curid=804194" title="Blair Waldorf">
<text>Blair Cornelia Waldorf (married name Bass) is one of the main characters of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, introduced in the original series of novels and also appearing as the lead in the television adaptation; she also appears in the comic adaptation. Described as &quot;a girl of extremes&quot; by creator Cecily von Ziegesar, she is a New York City socialite and a comical overachiever who possesses both snobbish and sensitive sides. Due to her position as queen bee of Manhattan&#x27;s social scene, Blair&#x27;s actions and relations are under constant scrutiny from the mysterious Gossip Girl, a popular blogger.

Leighton Meester, who portrayed the character in the television drama, has described Blair as being insecure about her social status. At times, this anxiety creates flaws and complexities which contribute to character development. In Meester&#x27;s view, the true Blair is ultimately a good girl at heart.

Blair has been compared to vintage film and literary figures, including Becky Sharp and Lizzie Eustace. She is commonly likened to Lila Fowler of Francine Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Valley High&quot; series. Meester&#x27;s portrayal has also drawn comparisons to roles played by Joan Collins and Audrey Hepburn. She is the most critically acclaimed character of the franchise, while the television character has drawn real-life attention surrounding fashion and her love life.

==Character in print==
&quot;Gossip Girl&quot; is a series of novels about socially prominent young adults in New York City. The story primarily follows Blair Waldorf and her best friend Serena van der Woodsen during their years in high school and college. Due to her fame on the Upper East Side, Blair is featured on the website of &quot;Gossip Girl,&quot; an anonymous gossip blogger whose posts appear occasionally throughout the story.

===Novel series===
In the first book, Blair is introduced as a privileged, comically vain overachiever. She is described as an alluring brunette, and occasionally models her appearance and demeanor after famous actresses, including Marilyn Monroe and, most often, Audrey Hepburn. In early novels, the character is also written as bulimic.

Blair is largely motivated by matters surrounding family, romance, and ambition. However, her tendency to overachieve can lead to feelings of paranoia, with dramatic or comical results. In a review for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Janet Malcolm remarked that Blair&#x27;s issues made her &quot;both a broader caricature and a more real person&quot; than the other &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; characters. In a 2009 interview, &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; creator Cecily von Ziegesar claimed to identify with Blair the most, stating, &quot;She is so unpredictable and dramatic. Such a bitch, but we understand why she is a bitch and we like her anyway&quot;.

====Story lines====
Throughout most of the series&#x27; run, Blair grapples with a number of changes within her family. One year prior to the opening novel, Blair&#x27;s parents divorced after her father ran off with another man. When her mother remarries, and her father leaves the country, Blair has difficulty accepting her stepfather, Cyrus Rose. In addition, her stress over these matters occasionally affects her other relationships. However, Blair ultimately remains close to her father Harold, who she often turns to for comfort. By contrast, she maintains a somewhat tenser relationship with her mother Eleanor. It is also revealed that Blair has struggled with bulimia.

In the opening novel, Blair learns of an affair between her friend Serena van der Woodsen and her boyfriend Nate. This marks the beginning of the story&#x27;s primary love triangle, which recurs throughout the series. Blair&#x27;s romantic life has various effects on her character development. After Nate repeatedly hurts her, she eventually refuses to take him back until she believes in his ability to commit to her. In pursuing Nate, however, Blair herself cheats on her new boyfriend Pete, which results in her losing both of them. She eventually begins to acknowledge her mistakes, with her father&#x27;s help. She later grows closer to Chuck Bass (which initially occurred in the series&#x27; television adaptation), who she&#x27;d previously known for years, which leads them to briefly date one another.

Blair is noted for an over-achieving nature, which often appears in humorous scenes. In a review for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Emily Nussbaum lauded one of Blair&#x27;s fantasies, which involves &quot;joining the Peace Corps, getting a killer tan, winning the Nobel Peace Prize, and having dinner with the president, &#x27;who would then write her a recommendation to Yale, and then Yale would fall all over themselves to accept her.&#x27; &quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; Janet Malcolm remarked that unlike some of her forerunners in film and literature, &quot;Blair already has all the money and position anyone could want. She is pure naked striving, restlessly seeking an object, any object, and never knowing when enough is enough.&quot;

Blair encounters a setback during her interview at Yale by revealing the recent stress in her life, and then kissing her interviewer on the cheek upon dismissal. Her father then makes a donation to the school, though Blair is still wait-listed. In the twelfth book, &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, it is revealed that she has been admitted to the university.

In addition to her feelings for Nate, Blair is sometimes said to feel competitive with Serena in other areas, including matters of beauty and popularity. This also leads to an occasional envy on Blair&#x27;s part. It is unclear how much of Blair&#x27;s perception of Serena is in line with reality; the narrative describes both characters as &quot;hands down the two hottest girls on the Upper East Side, and maybe all of Manhattan, or even the whole world.&quot;

===Manga series===

In 2010, Yen Press began publishing a manga adaptation titled &quot;Gossip Girl: For Your Eyes Only&quot;, written and illustrated by HyeKyung Baek. This series adapts notable scenarios from the novelâincluding the triangle with Nate and Serenaâbut also features new material.

After losing her position as queen bee, Blair attempts to regain her former status while adjusting to a less privileged lifestyle. In addition to this series, Blair also appears in a manga adaptation of the novel &quot;Gossip Girl: Psycho Killer&quot;, a parody of horror stories.

==Television series==
In 2007, &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; was adapted for television. According to Cecily von Ziegesar, the television character is largely faithful to the original. Among the aspects to be maintained are her admiration for Audrey Hepburn and her interest in Yale University. However, the series is also noted for its deviations from the source material, including the exclusion of Blair&#x27;s brother Tyler. The show also explores romances between Blair and multiple male leads, resulting in occasional love triangles. In the fifth season, Blair is revealed to be pregnant with Prince of Monaco, Louis Grimaldi&#x27;s child. However the child later dies before birth after a car crash Blair and Chuck were in.

Among fans and the media, Blair&#x27;s bond with Chuck Bass was commonly known by the portmanteau &quot;Chair&quot;, while her relationship with Dan Humphrey was referred to as âDairâ. The nicknames and viewer interest in these relationships were recognized by the show&#x27;s producers.
===Casting===

To prepare for the part of Blair, actress Leighton Meester, a natural blonde, dyed her hair brown before auditioning, and also studied the first novel. She has described the character as multi-faceted, labeling her &quot;a little bit of everything which is pretty amazing.&quot; Like von Ziegesar, Meester has also claimed to relate to Blair on certain levels. Prior to the show&#x27;s debut in 2007, the actress stated that, &quot;The only way to play Blair, or any character, and make her human, is to find what she is inside me. And I know I have my insecurities, too.&quot; She went on to say that, &quot;The way Blair and I are &quot;not&quot; alike when it comes to insecurities is: &quot;She&quot; pays &quot;so&quot; much attention to hers!&quot; Meester&#x27;s casting was described by &quot;Yahoo!&quot; as a star-making role which moved her &quot;into the pop culture vanguard,&quot; while Cecily von Ziegesar has called her a perfect choice.

In December 2010, Meester revealed plans to leave the show in 2012. &quot;E! Online&quot; and other outlets speculated that her departure would possibly mark the end of the series.

===Season 1===
In of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, Blair is introduced as the Upper East Side&#x27;s beautiful and popular queen bee. She is the daughter of Eleanor Waldorf, a famous fashion designer. She is dating Nate Archibald, and is best friends with Serena van der Woodsen. She also finds a close companion in Nate&#x27;s best friend and her childhood friend Chuck Bass, who becomes a partner for her schemes. When Serena returns home from boarding school, Blair learns from Nate that he lost his virginity to a drunken Serena over a year ago. Blair retaliates by publicly revealing Serena&#x27;s connection to a rehab hospital. She then learns that the actual patient is Serena&#x27;s younger brother, Eric, who had been committed after a suicide attempt. Afterward, a remorseful Blair reconciles with Serena.

After learning that Nate no longer loves her, Blair sleeps with Chuck, eventually falling for him. This leads to a heated affair and an eventual love triangle. Her inability to choose creates much of the first season&#x27;s story line. There are brief mentions of Blair&#x27;s past struggle with bulimia.

She also begins a brief power struggle with freshman Jenny Humphrey. After she unites with Chuck and Nate in order to save Serena from the scheming Georgina Sparks, Chuck realizes that his feelings for Blair are real and suggests that they spend the summer together in Tuscany. However, he is discouraged by his father at the last minute, and stands Blair up.

===Season 2===
At the launch of the second season, Blair was described by creators as the queen at the center of the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; chess game. A large portion of her story line in revolves around her love-hate relationship with Chuck Bass, which was labeled &quot;the heart of &quot;GG&quot;&quot; by &quot;People&quot; magazine. While competing with Serena, Blair forms an unexpected friendship with Jenny, who states that they each work for everything they achieve, while Serena often glides through life. During their interviews at Yale University, Blair and Serena apologize for their ill feelings and resume their friendship.

In the episode &quot;O Brother, Where Bart Thou?&quot;, Chuck is devastated by news of his father&#x27;s death, prompting Blair to offer her support while telling Chuck that she loves him. He initially shuns her advances, but later turns to her for comfort. However, the two stop seeing each other due to Chuck&#x27;s uncle, Jack Bass, convincing him he has an inability to commit to a relationship. After being rejected by Yale, Blair finds unexpected encouragement from Nate. She is later accepted into New York University, and her competitive relationship with Georgina is eventually renewed.

As the season ends, Blair crowns Jenny the new queen of Constance Billard School. In the season finale, it is discovered that Blair slept with Chuck&#x27;s uncle Jack and that Chuck had slept with Vanessa Abrams. Chuck then departs for Europe. He later returns to New York and reconciles with Blair while declaring his love for her, and the two finally begin a committed relationship.

===Season 3===
In the third season, Blair joins Vanessa, Georgina, and Jenny&#x27;s brother Dan at NYU. Much of her storyline concerns her inability to attain her previous status at her new school. She finds emotional support from her mother, as well as Chuck. However, she and Chuck separate once again when Blair feels that he manipulated her while competing with his uncle (Chuck made a deal with Jack that Blair could sleep with him and in exchange, Chuck gets his hotel back that Jack initially stole to &#x27;destroy Chuck&#x27;).

She later transfers to Columbia University, and learns that an emotionally reformed Chuck was responsible for her enrollment. They later team up as part of a role-playing scheme to help Serena&#x27;s mother and Chuck&#x27;s adopted mother, Lily. In the season finale, Chuck attempts to propose to Blair, but is interrupted by Dan, who reveals that Chuck had slept with Jenny. Two weeks later, Blair and Serena depart for Paris intending to spend the summer together.

===Season 4===
In Blair and Chuck become competitive once again, but eventually resume their sexual relations before recognizing their love for one another. When the relationship interferes with their business interests, she and Chuck break up once more. Chuck promises he&#x27;ll wait for her, and both affirm their belief that their love will reunite them in the end.

Blair then teams up with Dan when the two share common goals. They also end up working together at &quot;W.&quot; magazine, where friction develops between the two. On Valentine&#x27;s Day, she discovers that Chuck has romantic feelings for Raina Thorpe, the daughter of his business rival. Later, she and Dan spend the evening talking on their cell phones while watching &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;. Blair later quits &quot;W.&quot; and is shown asleep with Dan in his Brooklyn flat. Later, upon growing curious of their feelings for one another, Blair and Dan share a kiss before the mid-season hiatus.

Blair eventually decides that she wants to be with Chuck, but shuns him once again after he tries to humiliate Dan. She is later courted by a prince from Monaco named Louis. During a private confrontation, a drunken Chuck punches a window after he finds out Prince Louis has proposed to Blair, which cuts Blair&#x27;s face as it shatters. Afterward, Blair chooses to accept a proposal from Louis. Blair later attempts to warn Chuck about potential trouble in his family. She is then abducted by an enemy of the Basses, Raina&#x27;s father Russell Thorpe. Chuck later rescues Blair and apologizes for his violent actions. Following a night out together, the two have sex before Chuck advises Blair to return to Louis, believing that she will be happier with him. However, the season ends with the revelation that Blair may be pregnant.

====Reaction to triangle====
Amidst the fourth season, the romance between Dan and Blair became a polarizing topic among viewers which also drew significant media interest. Jarett Wieselman of the &quot;New York Post&quot; applauded the development, feeling that Blair had &quot;more chemistry&quot; with Dan than with Chuck. Tierney Bricker of E! ranked all 25 &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; couples placing &#x27;Dair&#x27; as the third best couple after Blair and Serena (#1) and &#x27;Chair&#x27; (#2).

Dawn Fallik of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; was less positive, asserting that &quot;both characters have been so Blandified that there&#x27;s no fun left in the show.&quot; A writer for &quot;E! Online&quot;&#x27;s Team WWK labeled the Dan/Blair relationship &quot;nomance nonsense&quot;.

With regard to Chuck and Blair, Meester stated, &quot;I can really relate to itânot necessarily because it&#x27;s this dramatic, tumultuous relationship, but because the way they love each other is very real, and not for the sake of being dramatic. It&#x27;s actual love. There&#x27;s nobody for each other but them.&quot; Meester also expressed fondness for Dan and Blair, however, stating, &quot;I think they&#x27;re good for each other in a lot of ways, in a way that Chuck and Blair aren&#x27;t.&quot; Badgley claimed that he thought &quot;Blair [was] Dan&#x27;s soul mate&quot; but that Blair&#x27;s soulmate was Chuck âbecause Blair and Chuck belong with each other, obviously.â He further stated that he thought the Blair and Dan storyline was &quot;the most exciting for Dan as a person&quot;.

According to producer Joshua Safran, the outcome wasn&#x27;t necessarily decided ahead of time. &quot;One thing we are very conscious ofâand I know some fans get upset about thisâis we really try to treat the characters as living, breathing, well-rounded individuals. And we&#x27;re often surprised by where their journeys take them; they open new doors for us all the time,&quot; he said.

====Controversy====
Following the of , Safran spoke on Chuck&#x27;s violence around Blair in the episode:

In response to these comments, Carina MacKenzie of Zap2it stated, &quot;We&#x27;re left wondering if Safran missed the part where she went home bleeding because Chuck was using physical intimidation to release his own emotions.&quot; While reviewing the episode, Tierney Bricker of Zap2it felt that there were &quot;really no excuses for Chuck Bass anymore.&quot; MacKenzie also called the show&#x27;s explanation &quot;disturbing, particularly given the young, female target demographic of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; and The CW.&quot;

In a review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Judy Berman addressed Safran&#x27;s description of Blair during the scene. &quot;Considering how terrified Blair looked at the end of their encounter, and how quickly she got out of there, the show is sending a mixed message at best.&quot; She went on to state, &quot;We have no right to expect &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; to be a paragon of morality, or even realism, but the idea that true love requires taking a shard of glass to the face is disturbing even in this alternate, soap-opera dimension.&quot;

===Season 5===
In the fifth-season premiere, Blair continues to plan her wedding, but begins to encounter problems in her relationship with Louis. It is later revealed that she is pregnant. Blair tells Chuck that the child is Louis&#x27;, and states that part of her wanted Chuck to be the father. Dan becomes Blair&#x27;s confidante and is shown to be in love with her, though she remains oblivious to his feelings and states that there is nothing more than friendship between them.

Though she insists that she is in love with Louis, Blair begins to seek Chuck out as the season progresses. The two eventually declare their love for each other prior to a car accident in her limousine while being chased by paparazzi. Though both recover, Blair suffers a miscarriage from the crash. After the crash Blair decides that she must commit herself to Louis, converting to Catholicism and cutting off any connection with Chuck. At the wedding, Gossip Girl releases a recording of Blair confessing her love for Chuck. Nevertheless, Louis and Blair get married, making Blair a Princess of Monaco, though Louis informs her that they will have a loveless marriage of convenience. She then receives support from Dan, leading them to share a kiss on Valentine&#x27;s Day. Amidst these developments, Blair grows conflicted between her feelings for Dan and Chuck. After taking steps to end her marriage, she chooses to pursue a relationship with Dan. By the end of the season, however, after a debate about which love is the best, Blair declares that she is still in love with Chuck, and chooses to pursue him.

===Season 6===
In the final season, Blair resumes her romantic relationship with Chuck, while Chuck and his father Bartâwho is revealed to be alive in the previous seasonâbecome bitter rivals. Blair pursues her career as head of Waldorf Designs, with several mishaps, before staging a successful line. In the penultimate episode, Bart falls to his death while trying to attack Chuck atop a building. Afterward, Blair and Chuck depart together. In the series finale, Blair marries Chuck which results in her not having to testify against him in his father&#x27;s homicide case. Five years later, Blair is shown to be running her mother&#x27;s successful fashion line and she works with Jenny in a line called &quot;J for Waldorf&quot;, and she and Chuck are shown to have a son named Henry.

==Reception==

===In print===
While covering the book series, Janet Malcolm of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; labeled the character &quot;an antiheroine of the first rank,&quot; and asserted that &quot;the series belongs to awful Blair, who inspires von Ziegesar&#x27;s highest flights of comic fancy.&quot; She also compared Blair to vintage film and literary figures such as Becky Sharp of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and Lizzie Eustace of &quot;The Eustace Diamonds&quot;. In addition, several critics have likened Blair to the character Lila Fowler of the earlier &quot;Sweet Valley High&quot; series.

In the 2007 book &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature and Culture&quot;, writer Harry Edwin Eiss chastised the depiction of Blair&#x27;s bulimia. &quot;If handled properly, the inclusion of her illness could have provided a powerful lesson for young adult readers who worry about their weight and food consumption. Unfortunately, Cecily von Ziegesar, the author of the series, presents a seriously flawed treatment of the problem. In a failed attempt at humor, the writer regards Blair&#x27;s sickness as just another source of gossip,&quot; he said. Emily Nussbaum of &quot;New York&quot; magazine had similar comments, calling the bulimia &quot;more of an icky weakness than a full-fledged pathology.&quot; However, she went on to commend Blair as &quot;hilariously self-centered&quot;.

Julie Opipari of &quot;Manga Maniac Cafe&quot; gave the initial &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; manga a negative review, citing displeasure with the characters and plot. However, she acknowledged that this gave her a greater appreciation for Blair in the second volume, noting that Blair &quot;really had to learn how to rough it&quot; after losing her privileged lifestyle. She went on to state that &quot;Blair is one character that is fun to hate on. So imagine my surprise when I actually started to like her by the end of the book&quot;.

===On screen===

The show&#x27;s breakout character, Blair Waldorf has garnered much media recognition. &quot;Yahoo!&quot; proclaims Blair a member of &quot;television&#x27;s pantheon of razor-witted, solipsistic high school Alpha females.&quot; While commenting on Meester, &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 cover story of the series states, &quot;Her villain-you-want-to-root-for is the most sophisticated performance on the show.&quot; In another 2008 article, &quot;People&quot; magazine commented that &quot;Meester has burst out of this ensemble to stardom.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; described her performance as similar to that of &quot;a predatory junior Joan Collins who practically breathes fire out of her pinched, perfectly WASP-ish nostrils.&quot; &quot;FHM Online&quot; ranked the actress the &quot;Hottest TV Star&quot; of autumn 2008, stating that as Blair Waldorf, &quot;Leighton Meester has stolen the spotlight with her mind-blowing good looks and amazing performance.&quot; &quot;OK!&quot; magazine likened her character to Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s portrayal of Holly Golightly. The physical similarity was also noted by &quot;USA Today&quot;.

In its 2009 &quot;Hot List&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cited Blair as &quot;the reason we love the back-stabby soap most.&quot; Regarding the fictional fame of Blair&#x27;s friend Serena, Tim Stack of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; asserted that &quot;Serena may be the star of the media but Blair is quickly becoming the star of this show.&quot; While citing Serena&#x27;s long-revered allure, &quot;Glamour&quot; and its readers compared the two characters in 2008, with Blair being recognized as more beautiful than Serena. In a review from &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Blair and Serena&#x27;s friendship was praised as &quot;it offered a relationship whose depth and complexity approached Rory and Paris&#x27; [from &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;].&quot;

In May 2009, Blair received attention from &quot;Forbes&quot;, which interviewed her via the series&#x27; writers. &quot;Television Without Pity&quot; listed Meester in their &quot;Golden Globes 2009: Overlooked TV Shows and Performances&quot; article, labeling Blair &quot;so multi-faceted, well-dressed and beautifully played that she elevates this teen soap to something we don&#x27;t even feel guilty about admitting we love.&quot; Meester won the Teen Choice Award for &quot;Choice TV Actress Drama&quot; in 2009, and again in 2010. In 2009, she was voted the &quot;Best Mean Girl&quot; in Zap2it first poll of the best television characters in the 2000s. In February 2012, Zap2it held another poll to determine TV&#x27;s Most Crushworthy. Blair was elected TV&#x27;s Most Crushworthy 1% Female over Temperance &quot;Bones&quot; Brennan. The 1 percenters are people that &quot;have everything going for them with their fantastic good looks and their opulent lifestyle&quot;. Her relationship with Chuck Bass was included in &quot;TV Guide&quot; list of &quot;The Best TV Couples of All Time&quot; as well as &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;30 Best &#x27;Will They/Won&#x27;t They?&#x27; TV Couples&quot;.

The character&#x27;s wardrobeâcredited to designers Abigail Lorick and Eric Damanâwas popular, earning mentions from periodicals such as &quot;InStyle&quot; and &quot;New York&quot;, along with recognition from websites. &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed Blair among its &quot;Best Dressed TV Characters of 2007&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Blair Waldorf and Chuck Bass the &quot;Most Stylish&quot; characters of 2008. Lifetime television ranks Blair first in its listing of &quot;The Top 10 Best-Dressed TV Characters&quot;, while &quot;Glamour&quot; has named her among its best-dressed TV characters of all time. In a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; interview, costume designers Eric Daman and Meredith Markworth-Pollack named Audrey Hepburn and &quot;Vogue&quot; editor-in-chief Anna Wintour as their inspirations when dressing Meester as Blair. The designers also cited New York socialites Tinsley Mortimer and Arden Wohl as influences. &quot;TV Guide&quot; named her the sixth most fashionable TV character.
