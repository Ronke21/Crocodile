<text>The mayor of Cincinnati is recognized as the official head and representative of the city for all purposes. There have been seventy-six mayors of Cincinnati. The first mayor was David Ziegler, who took office in 1802. The current mayor is Aftab Pureval, who was elected on November 2, 2021, and took office at noon on January 4, 2022.

==Executive powers==
The mayor shall preside over all meetings of the Cincinnati City Council. The mayor may call a special meeting of the council, but may not have a vote in the council. The mayor has the power to propose legislation for debate among the council. The mayor shall appoint and may remove the vice-mayor and the chair of all committees of the council without the advice and consent of the council.

The mayor of Cincinnati shall be recognized as the official head and representative of the city for all purposes, except as provided otherwise in the city charter of Cincinnati. The mayor may appoint a city manager upon an affirmative vote of five members of the city council following the mayor&#x27;s recommendation.

The mayor delivers an annual address to the council and citizens of the city reporting on the state of the city and making recommendations for the establishment and achievement of future city goals.

In time of public danger or emergency, the mayor, with the consent of the council, may take command of the police, maintain order and enforce the law.

==Succession==
In the event of the death, removal or resignation of the mayor, the Vice Mayor of Cincinnati shall succeed to the office of mayor in accordance with the city charter. The current vice mayor of Cincinnati is Jan Michelle Kearney.

==History==
Until the charter of 1815, the president of the council served as equivalent of mayor. Two sources agree on the list of presidents:

Prior to 1925 (and since 1999) the mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio was elected in a separate, partisan election.

In 1924, the Charter Party, a local third-party, was founded. It has elected members of the city council and mayors. Until 1961, many Democrats ran as Charterites. The party focuses exclusively on local government; thus, many Charterites switch to a major party when seeking office outside Cincinnati.

From 1925 through 1998, the mayor was chosen by the city council from among its nine members.

In 1971, a coalition of two parties, the Democrats and the Charterites, worked out a power-sharing plan, which, starting in 1973, resulted in a rotating mayorship. After a few years of rotation, they decided that the city council member who received the most votes in the election would automatically become mayor.

In 1999, Charlie Luken became the first mayor to take office under a restored system of direct mayoral election.

==Mayor firsts==
In 1900, Julius Fleischmann became the youngest mayor of Cincinnati at the age of 28 years.

In 1954, Dorothy N. Dolbey became the first female mayor of the City of Cincinnati.

In 2006, Mark Mallory was the first directly elected African-American Mayor of Cincinnati.

On November 2, 2021, Aftab Pureval was elected the first Asian American mayor of Cincinnati. Mayor Pureval is the 70th and current mayor of Cincinnati.

<doc id="800152" wikidata="Q1164876" url="?curid=800152" title="Dansgaard–Oeschger event">
<text>A Dansgaard–Oeschger event (often abbreviated D–O event), is a rapid climate fluctuation; such events occurred 25 times during the last glacial period. Some scientists say that the events occur quasi-periodically with a recurrence time being a multiple of 1,470 years, but this is debated. The comparable climate cyclicity during the Holocene is referred to as Bond events. &quot;Dansgaard–Oeschger&quot; refers to palaeoclimatologists Willi Dansgaard and Hans Oeschger.

==Evidence==
The best evidence for Dansgaard–Oeschger events remains in the Greenland ice cores, which only go back to the end of the last interglacial, the Eemian interglacial (about 115,000 years ago). Ice core evidence from Antarctic cores suggests that the Dansgaard–Oeschger events are related to the so-called Antarctic Isotope Maxima by means of a coupling of the climate of the two hemispheres, the Polar see-saw. If this relationship holds also for the previous glacials, Antarctic data suggest that D-O events were present in previous glacial periods as well. Unfortunately, current ice core records from Greenland extend only through the last most recent glacial period so direct evidence of D-O events in earlier glacial periods from Greenland ice is unavailable. However, work by Stephen Barker and colleagues has shown that the existing Greenland record can be reconstructed by deriving the Antarctic ice core record. This allows for the reconstruction of an older Greenland record through the derivation of the nearly million-year-long Antarctic ice core record.

==Effect==

In the Northern Hemisphere, they take the form of rapid warming episodes, typically in a matter of decades, each followed by gradual cooling over a longer period. For example, about 11,500 years ago, averaged annual temperatures on the Greenland ice sheet increased by around 8 °C over 40 years, in three steps of five years, where a 5 °C change over 30–40 years is more common. Warming resulting from D-O events extended farther south into central North America as well, as indicated by speleothem oxygen isotope excursions chronologically corresponding to D-O events recorded in Greenland ice cores. The impact of D-O events in Europe is also recorded by fluctuations in discharge and sedimentation patterns in fluvial systems like the Tisza River.

Heinrich events only occur in the cold spells immediately preceding D-O warmings, leading some to suggest that D-O cycles may cause the events, or at least constrain their timing.

The course of a D-O event sees a rapid warming, followed by a cool period lasting a few hundred years. This cold period sees an expansion of the polar front, with ice floating further south across the North Atlantic Ocean.

D-O events are also believed to cause minor increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on the order of around 5 ppm.

During D-O events, positive δ18O excursions occur in Floresian speleothem records, indicating a weakening of the Indonesian-Australian Monsoon during such events.

==Causes==
The processes behind the timing and amplitude of these events (as recorded in ice cores) are still unclear. The pattern in the Southern Hemisphere is different, with slow warming and much smaller temperature fluctuations. Indeed, the Vostok ice core was drilled before the Greenland cores, and the existence of Dansgaard–Oeschger events was not widely recognised until the Greenland (GRIP/GISP2) cores were done; after which there was some reexamination of the Vostok core to see if these events had somehow been &quot;missed&quot;.
The events appear to reflect changes in the North Atlantic Ocean circulation, perhaps triggered by an influx of fresh water or rain.

The events may be caused by an amplification of solar forcings, or by a cause internal to the earth system – either a &quot;binge-purge&quot; cycle of ice sheets accumulating so much mass they become unstable, as postulated for Heinrich events, or an oscillation in deep ocean currents (Maslin &quot;et al.&quot;. 2001, p25).

These events have been attributed to changes in the size of the ice sheets and atmospheric carbon dioxide. The former determines the strength of the Atlantic Ocean circulation via altering the northern hemisphere westerly winds, gulf stream, and sea-ice systems. The latter modulates atmospheric inter-basin freshwater transport across Central America, which changes the freshwater budget in the North Atlantic and thus the circulation. These studies corroborate the previously suggested existence of a &quot;D-O window&quot; of AMOC bistability (&#x27;sweet spot&#x27; for abrupt climate changes) associated with ice volume and atmospheric , accounting for the occurrences of D-O type events under intermediate glacial conditions in the late Pleistocene.

==Timing==
Although the effects of the Dansgaard–Oeschger events are largely constrained to ice cores taken from Greenland, there is evidence to suggest that D-O events have been globally synchronous. A spectral analysis of the American GISP2 isotope record showed a peak of [18O:16O] abundance around 1500 years. This was proposed by Schulz (2002) to be a regular periodicity of 1470 years. This finding was supported by Rahmstorf (2003); if only the most recent 50,000 years from the GISP2 core are examined, the variation of the trigger is ±12% (±2% in the 5 most recent events, whose dates are probably most precise).

However, the older parts of the GISP2 core do not show this regularity, nor do the same events in the GRIP core. This may be because the first 50 kyr of the GISP2 core are most accurately dated, by layer counting. The climate system response to the trigger is varying within 8% of the period. Oscillations within the Earth system can be expected to be far more irregular in period. Rahmstorf suggests that the highly regular pattern would point more to an orbital cycle. Such a source has not been identified. The closest orbital cycle, a Lunar cycle of 1,800 years, cannot be reconciled with this pattern. The dating between the European GRIP ice core, and the American GISP2 ice core differs by about 5000 years at 50,000 years BP. It was noted by Ditlevsen et al. (2005) that the spectral peak found in the GISP2 ice core was not present in the GRIP core, and thus depended critically on the accuracy of the dating. The dating issue was largely solved by the accurate dating of the NGRIP core. Using this dating the recurrence of Dansgaard–Oeschger events is random consistent with a noise-induced Poisson process.

D-O cycles may set their own timescale. Maslin &quot;et al.&quot;. (2001) suggested that each ice sheet had its own conditions of stability, but that on melting, the influx of freshwater was enough to reconfigure ocean currents, causing melting elsewhere. More specifically, D-O cold events, and their associated influx of meltwater, reduce the strength of the North Atlantic Deep Water current (NADW), weakening the northern hemisphere circulation and therefore resulting in an increased transfer of heat polewards in the southern hemisphere. This warmer water results in melting of Antarctic ice, thereby reducing density stratification and the strength of the Antarctic Bottom Water current (AABW). This allows the NADW to return to its previous strength, driving Northern Hemisphere melting – and another D-O cold event.

The theory may also explain Heinrich events&#x27; apparent connection to the D-O cycle; when the accumulation of meltwater in the oceans reaches a threshold, it may have raised sea level enough to undercut the Laurentide ice sheet – causing a Heinrich event and resetting the cycle.

The little ice age around 400 to 200 years ago has been interpreted by some as the cold part of a D-O cycle.

== History ==
The ice core&#x27;s signals now recognised as Dansgaard–Oeschger events are, in retrospect, visible in the original GISP core, as well as the Camp Century Greenland core. But at the time the ice cores were made, their significance was noted but not widely appreciated. Dansgaard &quot;et al&quot;. (AGU geophysical monograph 33, 1985) note their existence in the GRIP core as &quot;violent oscillations&quot; in the δ18O signal, and that they appear to correlate to events in the previous Camp Century core 1,400 km away, thus providing evidence for their corresponding to widespread climatic anomalies (with only the Camp Century core, they could have been local fluctuations). Dansgaard &quot;et al&quot;. speculate that these may be related to quasi-stationary modes of the atmosphere-ocean system. D-O events tend to be what drives the &quot;Sahara pump&quot; which has had an effect upon human evolution and dispersal.

The cyclicity is also found during the Holocene, where the events are referred to as Bond events.

<doc id="800153" wikidata="Q591171" url="?curid=800153" title="Elevator Action">
<text>is a platform shooter game released in arcades by Taito in 1983. The player assumes the role of a secret agent infiltrating a 30-story building from the roof, then descending to ground level via elevators and stairways. Enemy agents emerge from closed doors and shoot at the player. The goal is to collect secret documents from specially marked rooms, then exit to a waiting getaway car. It runs on the Taito SJ System arcade system.

The game was a critical success and was the top-grossing game on the Japanese arcade charts for three months in late 1983. It has been ported to a variety of home systems and appeared on Taito compilations. An arcade sequel, &quot;Elevator Action Returns&quot; was released in 1994

==Gameplay==
&quot;Elevator Action&quot; is a platform shooter. The player assumes the role of Agent 17, codename: &quot;Otto&quot;, a secret agent. Otto enters a 30-story building at roof level with a goal of exiting at the ground floor, collecting secret documents whose locations are marked by red doors. Along the way, he must use the building&#x27;s elevator and escalator systems to move from floor to floor and avoid or kill the enemy agents trying to stop him. After picking up all the documents, Otto can escape to the basement and drive away in a waiting car to end the level. Otto can move left and right, jump, duck, and fire up to three shots at a time from his pistol. While Otto is in an elevator, the player can push up or down to send him to a higher or lower floor. He can run or jump across an empty shaft as long as the elevator is above him, and can ride on its roof but not control its motion or cross to the other side.

If Otto tries to leave the building without collecting all the documents, he will be transported to the highest floor that still has an unopened red door and must work his way back down. In addition, if he takes too long to clear a level, an alarm will sound; the enemy agents then become more aggressive, and the elevators will be slower to respond to the player&#x27;s joystick movements.

Each building contains a section in which the lights are out, making it harder to see approaching enemies. On other floors, Otto can temporarily disable the lights by shooting one of the overhead fixtures. Otto is trained in shooting as well as karate. Otto can kill enemy agents by shooting them, jump-kicking them at close range, dropping a light fixture on their heads, or crushing them with an elevator. If he is shot or crushed, or if he falls down an open shaft, the player loses one life.

== Release ==
During the game&#x27;s test phase in North America, Mike Von Kennel, marketing manager of Taito America, called the game a &quot;top test piece&quot; and held high expectations. It was released in Japan on May 23, 1983, and in North America during July of the same year. In North America, while also sold as a dedicated cabinet, it was Taito&#x27;s first game to be sold as a conversion kit in that territory. It was available in Europe by January 1984.

=== Ports ===
&quot;Elevator Action&quot; was first ported to the Family Computer by Micronics, and this version was published by Taito in Japan on June 28, 1985. The Famicom version was later released in North America on the Nintendo Entertainment System around 1987. Taito later made and published their own port of the game for the MSX around 1985. Around that same time, under license from Taito, Sega made and published a version of the game for the SG-1000. It was later ported to the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64. A port was in development for the Atari 2600, but was cancelled.

The Famicom/NES version of &quot;Elevator Action&quot; was re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on April 3, 2007, and in North America on March 5 earlier that year. It was later re-released exclusively in Japan for the Wii U Virtual Console on February 19, 2014, and for the 3DS Virtual Console on March 12 of the same year. The arcade version was later re-released on the PlayStation 4 on October 26, 2017, and later on the Nintendo Switch on March 14, 2019, by Hamster Corporation as part of their Arcade Archives series. &quot;Elevator Action&quot; is included in the compilations &quot;Taito Legends&quot;, &quot;Taito Memories Gekan&quot;, &quot;Taito Memories Pocket&quot;, and &quot;Taito Legends Power Up&quot;. The game is also included in &quot;Elevator Action Returns S-Tribute&quot; as a hidden game, which players can unlock by clearing every stage.

== Reception ==
&quot;Elevator Action&quot; quickly became a commercial success for Taito. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Elevator Action&quot; in their August 1983 issues as the most-successful new table arcade unit of the month. It then topped the &quot;Game Machine&quot; table arcade cabinet charts for three months in late 1983, from September through October to November 1983, and persisted on their charts up until the April 1, 1984 issue.

In the first month of the North American release, the game was said to have &quot;surpassed all expectations&quot; in terms of popularity and sales by Keith Egging, the vice president of product development at Taito America. The game was reportedly popular with patrons at the 1983 Amusement Expo. Conversion kits for the game were also popular, and the number of kits sold set an &quot;enviable record&quot; for the company. It was among the top five highest-grossing arcade games of 1984 in American street/route locations.

It received a positive review from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine in January 1984, with the reviewer stating it &quot;has a really original theme&quot; and considered it a &quot;pleasant&quot; change from the &quot;normal spaceage&quot; shoot-em-ups. In a 1984 issue of &quot;Video Games&quot;, Steve Harris wrote, &quot;it was a good action game which allows for a great deal of player input&quot;, and while he feared that it might have been overshadowed by the laserdisc games of the time, thought the game was as competent as those. It received a Certificate of Merit as part of the 1985 Arkie Awards.

===Retrospective===
&quot;Eurogamer&quot; wrote that it was &quot;astonishing just how playable it remains&quot;. In &quot;The Video Games Guide: 1,000+ Arcade, Console and Computer Games&quot;, Matt Fox wrote that the game was an &quot;enjoyable arcade game&quot;, giving it three out of five stars according to the book&#x27;s own rating system.

Reviewing the Taito Egret II mini-arcade version in March 2022, &quot;Metro&quot; said it is &quot;simple stuff but enjoyable&quot; and not as &quot;ridiculously&quot; hard. They also praised the &quot;unusually deliberate action&quot; and said it has elements found in the later games &quot;Impossible Mission&quot;, &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; and &quot;Shinobi&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1991, a version of &quot;Elevator Action&quot; was made for the Game Boy, developed and published by Taito. While it retains the gameplay of the original arcade version otherwise, it includes new gameplay elements like power-ups and new weapons. A port of the game for EZweb mobile phones was released on April 15, 2004. This mobile version was later published in North America by Sony Pictures Digital around 2006.

A sequel, &quot;Elevator Action Returns&quot;, was released in arcades in 1994. &quot;Elevator Action EX&quot; is an updated version of the game released for the Game Boy Color in 2000. &quot;Elevator Action Old &amp; New&quot; is a further update for the Game Boy Advance, published in 2002. A later remake of the game, titled &quot;Elevator Action Deluxe&quot;, was released on PlayStation Network on August 31, 2011. The game contains single player and multiplayer modes, as well as the original arcade game.

Revealed at AOU 2009, &quot;Elevator Action: Death Parade&quot; is an arcade light gun shooter that uses physical elevator doors in front of the LCD screen when changing scenarios. In June 2021, UNIS then released &quot;Elevator Action Invasion&quot;, another arcade lightgun game.

<doc id="800155" wikidata="Q1057392" url="?curid=800155" title="Lambertian reflectance">
<text>Lambertian reflectance is the property that defines an ideal &quot;matte&quot; or diffusely reflecting surface. The apparent brightness of a Lambertian surface to an observer is the same regardless of the observer&#x27;s angle of view. More precisely, the reflected radiant intensity obeys Lambert&#x27;s cosine law, which makes the reflected radiance the same in all directions. Lambertian reflectance is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert, who introduced the concept of perfect diffusion in his 1760 book &quot;Photometria&quot;.

==Examples==
Unfinished wood exhibits roughly Lambertian reflectance, but wood finished with a glossy coat of polyurethane does not, since the glossy coating creates specular highlights. Though not all rough surfaces are Lambertian, this is often a good approximation, and is frequently used when the characteristics of the surface are unknown.

Spectralon is a material which is designed to exhibit an almost perfect Lambertian reflectance.

==Use in computer graphics==

In computer graphics, Lambertian reflection is often used as a model for diffuse reflection. This technique causes all closed polygons (such as a triangle within a 3D mesh) to reflect light equally in all directions when rendered. The reflection decreases when the surface is tilted away from being perpendicular to the light source, however, because the area is illuminated by a smaller fraction of the incident radiation.

The reflection is calculated by taking the dot product of the surface&#x27;s unit normal vector, formula_1, and a normalized light-direction vector, formula_2, pointing from the surface to the light source. This number is then multiplied by the color of the surface and the intensity of the light hitting the surface:

:formula_3,

where formula_4 is the brightness of the diffusely reflected light, formula_5 is the color and formula_6 is the intensity of the incoming light. Because

:formula_7,

where formula_8 is the angle between the directions of the two vectors, the brightness will be highest if the surface is perpendicular to the light vector, and lowest if the light vector intersects the surface at a grazing angle.

Lambertian reflection from polished surfaces is typically accompanied by specular reflection (gloss), where the surface luminance is highest when the observer is situated at the perfect reflection direction (i.e. where the direction of the reflected light is a reflection of the direction of the incident light in the surface), and falls off sharply.

==Other waves==

While Lambertian reflectance usually refers to the reflection of light by an object, it can be used to refer to the reflection of any wave. For example, in ultrasound imaging, &quot;rough&quot; tissues are said to exhibit Lambertian reflectance.

<doc id="800162" wikidata="Q1300465" url="?curid=800162" title="Trigger Happy TV">
<text>Trigger Happy TV is a hidden camera/practical joke comedy television series. The original British edition of the show, produced by Absolutely Productions, starred Dom Joly and ran for three series on the British television channel Channel 4 from 2000 to 2003. Joly made a name for himself as the sole star of the show, which he produced and directed with cameraman Sam Cadman. &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot; and &quot;World Shut Your Mouth&quot;, his other major show, would both be categorised as deadpan or &quot;dry humour&quot;.

The show returned again featuring Joly, produced by Spirit Media, as a series of shorts on All 4 and for a one-off Christmas special on Channel 4 after 13 years, airing Christmas Eve 2016. A second series of shorts on All 4 followed and a one-off special on E4 in 2017.

==Format==
The show consists of Joly deliberately entering into ludicrous or embarrassing situations in public places, which were filmed surreptitiously by Cadman. Sketches took place in a variety of locations, though most appeared to be filmed on the streets of Central London and Cheltenham.

Unlike most hidden camera shows, many of the scenes in &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot; do not revolve around trapping normal people into embarrassing and impossible situations. Instead, he often makes fun of himself rather than others, and many scenes made people stop and either laugh or simply wonder what was going on; the passers-by are never made aware of the fact that they are on television. Such scenes include Joly answering a gigantic novelty mobile phone and shouting at the top of his voice into it (normally in quiet locations like golf courses, cinemas, libraries and parks), a chef chasing an actor in a large rat costume out of a restaurant, and two actors dressed as masked Mexican wrestlers getting into spontaneous fights in grocery stores. Other scenes included people dressed as animals breaking into a fight and the progress of various costumed pedestrians (such as a snail and an old man) across a zebra crossing in London. Joly also often dressed as a Cub Scout, a foreign person with bad English, or a park attendant.

The show does not include a laugh track, instead playing instrumental and sometimes sad music during sketches. Bands such as Eels and The Crocketts have been used several times in the series.

Two series and two Christmas specials of the show were produced in the UK, from 2000 to 2003. Three DVDs were released, containing the &quot;best of&quot; both series and the Christmas specials. Despite the show&#x27;s popularity over two continents, Joly says he will not make any more in Britain, as his face and voice are now too well known. The comedy was also known for its contrastingly sombre musical soundtrack, which was released commercially. He notes in the booklet of the soundtrack CD for Series 2 &quot;Also Johnny Vaughan ask me why all the music is so sad and not plinky-plonk, happy-clappy cartoon type stuff, &#x27;cos I don&#x27;t want to be the Big Breakfast, &#x27;nuff said.&quot;

A series of 8 short episodes became available on All 4 on 26 September 2016, as well as a Christmas special which aired on Channel 4 on 24 December 2016.

==Recurring sketches==

* The signature sketch of the series sees Joly innocuously present in a public location, often a place of relative quiet such as an art gallery, a library or an Internet café, when a loud Nokia ring tone sounds. After a moment&#x27;s pause, he lifts an oversized model of a mobile phone into view and shouts &quot;Hello?!&quot; into it. He then proceeds to yell conversational dialogue about where he is and what he&#x27;s doing. Apart from an occasion where he was &quot;On a boat in Holland!&quot;, this was usually while he slowly exits the area. It almost always concluded with him saying some variation of &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s rubbish...ciao!&quot;
::The status of this sketch premise as synonymous with the series was reflected in the final episode, where it served as the final sketch. It began with him sitting alone on a bench at a train station, smoking, beneath a sign reading &quot;The End&quot;. He looks somewhat downbeat, with the phone resting beside him. In time the familiar ring tone sounds and he lifts the phone only to speak in a low and measured voice &quot;Hello? No... No... I can&#x27;t talk now, bye.&quot; and soon a fade to black. 
* A random customer about to enter a grocery store is told by Joly (dressed up in a flamboyant suit, flanked by glamorous women and beneath a celebratory banner) that they are the millionth customer and anything they can get in their shopping trolley in a one-minute &quot;dash&quot; will be free. The customer proceeds to speed through the store filling up their cart while he and the other actors removed the set and quickly left.
* Joly is seen dressed in a stereotype burglar costume and asks a random passerby to aide him in some apparently criminal endeavour. Invariably after completing his &quot;crime&quot; he&#x27;d start yelling his joy at the success and implicate the passerby as an accomplice, while departing (&quot;escaping&quot;) the scene. One instance saw him shouting from the upstairs window of a house asking a passerby to put a ladder back up for him and hold it while he climbs down (complete with a bag marked &quot;Swag&quot;), upon reaching the bottom he runs away screaming &quot;We burgled the house! Me and him just burgled the house!&quot;, leaving the passerby holding the ladder.
* Joly, dressed in authentic costumes, would walk up to people sitting at a table or bench, often outside a restaurant, and offer (usually in a mock-foreign accent and broken English) to perform some form of entertainment, most commonly play a musical instrument, sing or perform a dance. Whether they accepted or refused the offer, he&#x27;d proceed to give a performance of terrible quality and, however they reacted, hold out a hand in expectation of a tip. On one occasion, Joly, wearing a porkpie hat and white jumpsuit, walks up to a couple sitting on a bench in a park. Despite no encouragement, he proceeded to do a terrible Morris dance. When finished, he calmly places his hand out as if asking for change.
* Joly is seen in a laundrette with boxer shorts and an undershirt on, and wearing a hockey mask on his face, à la Jason Voorhees. He stuffs a bloody jumpsuit into the washer.
* Outside an incongruous location (such as a pornography shop or public toilet), a random customer is seen to enter and quickly Joly sets up outside in flamboyant suit and wig, holding a microphone, flanked by glamorous women holding champagne, a couple of men with brass horn instruments, photographers, and all beneath a large banner, faced by a television crew. When the customer leaves the shop, fanfare erupts, cameras flash and Joly yells congratulations to the person for being the millionth customer.
* Joly, dressed in a stereotypical hooligan-like outfit including piercings, spiked hair and &#x27;anarchy&#x27; facial tattoos, accosts random people in an extremely polite and intellectual manner, often quoting poetry or prose and behaving completely at odds with his rough appearance.
* Joly stands in front of an enormous picture of himself plastered against a wall that says &quot;Don&#x27;t trust this man!&quot;, but still manages to get passersby to talk to him and do things for him. In one memorable sketch, somebody actually comes up to him and asks him for directions.
* In Trafalgar Square, people sit down to have Joly, dressed as a French artist, paint their portrait. Rather than actually painting the portrait, he paints a comical phrase or picture on the canvas and walks away, leaving the customer sitting in their pose. Examples include him painting &quot;I need to sing&quot; before picking up a nearby guitar and strumming away across the square and &quot;Goodbye cruel world&quot; before climbing into the nearby fountain and floating face-down.
* Persons are stopped at random on the street by Joly, accompanied by a cameraman and boom operator, and asked to take a blindfolded taste test of a new foodstuff or drink. Once the person is blindfolded and given a sample in each hand, he and his crew silently but quickly walked away leaving the person standing there. Sometimes, a noticeably different crew replaced the original one.
* Joly is in the process of conducting a streetside interview with a British celebrity, but becomes increasingly distracted before abruptly departing. Distractions took the form of his own dissatisfaction with the job (walked off after expressing it), an ardent fan who kisses him and dares him to chase after her for more (he pauses for a moment then runs off after her), a persistent busker constantly getting in the frame (chases after him having smashed his guitar and threatening to do worse) and his kidnapping right in front of the interviewee by a van of hoodlums.
* Joly, disguised in trench coat, dark glasses and hat plays the role of a KGB spy. He would approach a random member of the public and usually uttered a code word or phrase (&quot;You are red fox?&quot;) in an apparent attempt to confirm they were the contact he was supposed to meet, and tried to hand them a briefcase. After Joly leaves without completing the &#x27;drop&#x27;, his accomplice usually appears, dressed as the person in question (a giant red fox). The most elaborate set up involved an unsuspecting phone-box user becoming the centerpiece of a bizarre money exchange laced with secret codes involving a &quot;nun&quot; and a &quot;doctor&quot;.
* Joly, dressed as a Swiss tourist, holding a phrasebook, asks a passerby a question in comical and especially bad broken English, such as &quot;Where may I go to empty my bottom?&quot; (go to the toilet). Some people laugh; others genuinely try to help him.
* Various sketches involving actors in animal costumes copulating, urinating, or violently assaulting others, in the presence of ordinary people. The sketches with animal costumes, especially the violent ones, are arguably second only to the mobile phone sketches as a &quot;signature sketch.&quot;
* Other examples were the &quot;___-a-gram&quot; services, wherein Joly delivers an actor in costume to an innocuous business location (often a laundromat) and the actor proceeds to stand in the corner, looking completely forlorn and sighing often after he leaves.
* Assuming the role of a park-keeper, Joly attempts to politely vilify elderly park goers, all-but accusing them of behaving like young hooligans. Each sketch starts with the park-keeper saying that he&#x27;s been &quot;tipped off&quot; and that someone &quot;matching your description&quot; was acting improperly (setting off fireworks, doing graffiti, joyriding, etc.) When the elderly victim pleads innocence, the park-keeper will sometimes persist, but usually make a highly qualified acceptance, politely by strongly implying he doesn&#x27;t believe them but as he can&#x27;t prove anything he&#x27;ll let them off this time.
* Joly, dressed as a traffic warden, accuses motorists stopped in traffic or at traffic lights of being illegally parked and proceeds to ticket them. In this character (an over-zealous jobsworth essentially), his oft-repeated mantra is &quot;not on my patch, never&quot;. Other targets included a street cleaner who was forced to move his wheelbarrow of equipment away from double yellow lines, a bus which Joly attempted to ticket for illegal parking when it is at a bus stop and a taxi, which he himself hailed to a stop.
* Joly and other actors wearing &quot;fat suits&quot; and trying to fit into tight places, such as a telephone booth or narrow alleyway. One memorable example included Joly and another actor in fat suits holding up an entire escalator full of people.
* Joly will walk into a crowded public area (train car, bus stop, etc.) wearing a bright red satin jacket with a red beret and loudly announce that his name is Arron and the location is now under control of the &quot;Guardian Angels&quot;. He will usually open his jacket to reveal a matching shirt that reads &quot;Guardian Angels&quot; when making his initial announcement. This is followed by &quot;There will be no violence in this...(trolley, sidewalk)! Now does anybody have a problem with that!&quot;

==&quot;Being Dom Joly&quot;==
A spoof documentary about Joly followed the original three series, called &quot;Being Dom Joly&quot; and produced and written by Joly himself. This aired prior to screenings of &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot; in the USA and earned critical acclaim, with one reviewer Bob Croft, for the &quot;LA Times&quot;, calling Joly &quot;the funniest man in Britain&quot;.

==US version==
A new series of &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot; was made for the US market in 2003, for Comedy Central. It retained the original format but almost all sketches were performed by a cast including Jessica Makinson (13 episodes), Travis Draft (4 episodes), Jerry Minor (4 episodes) and Brett Reylander (3 episodes). A total of 13 episodes were made and broadcast on Comedy Central in the US, comprising the one series. Recurring sketches included a waitress with a large pepper mill appearing in incongruous places such as a park and offering members of the public fresh ground pepper, and a cheerleader whose inappropriate cheers featured topics such as skin cancer. The series was subsequently broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK, under the title &quot;Trigger Happy TV USA.&quot; Though Joly did cameo sporadically on the show (he appeared to a greater or lesser extent in 4 episodes), he was very unhappy with the programme and called it &quot;&quot;Trigger Happy&quot; by numbers&quot;. He had a producer credit on the show, but disassociated himself with the project.

The British series 1 and 2 episodes also aired in the US on Comedy Central, but with different music from that used in the UK, and with a few scenes edited out.

Although appearing in the Christmas Special, Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot; was not released on any soundtrack. Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot; was also used multiple times in the series, in the street-artist segment, but he would not give permission for the song to be included in a compilation. &quot;Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five&quot; by Paul McCartney and Wings was also used for the oversized men segments but was not on the soundtrack.

<text>Naval Air Station Fallon or NAS Fallon is the United States Navy&#x27;s premier air-to-air and air-to-ground training facility. It is located southeast of the city of Fallon, east of Reno in western Nevada. Since 1996, it has been home to the U.S. Navy-Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN) taking over from the former NAS Miramar, California, and the surrounding area contains of bombing and electronic warfare ranges. It is also home to the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC), which includes TOPGUN, the Carrier Airborne Early Warning Weapons School (CAEWWS) and the Navy Rotary Wing Weapons School. Navy SEAL Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) training also takes place there.

The airfield is named Van Voorhis Field in honor of Commander Bruce Van Voorhis (1908–1943) who was awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor.

==History==
The airfield at NAS Fallon was originally built in 1942 as part of a defensive network to repel a feared Japanese invasion of the west coast. It was soon taken over by the Navy for training use and has been used as such ever since with the exception of the period of 1946 to 1951, during which it was used by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. During the years prior to 1972, the base was known as Naval Auxiliary Air Station and was heavily used during the Vietnam War by various squadrons that rotated through the base before deploying to carriers headed for Vietnam. During these same years prior to 1972, many ground troops were temporarily assigned to NAS Fallon for their hot weather training (during the summer months) and cold weather training (during the winter months). On 1 January 1972, the Navy recognized NAS Fallon&#x27;s importance to naval aviation by upgrading the base from auxiliary air station status to a major aviation command as a full-fledged naval air station. While NAS Fallon provides training for visiting carrier air wings, Strike Fighter Squadron 127 (VFA-127), the &quot;Desert Bogeys&quot;, was the air station&#x27;s only permanently based squadron from October 1987 until it was disestablished on 23 March 1996.

The Navy relocated its Navy Fighter Weapons School, or TOPGUN, from NAS Miramar to NAS Fallon in 1996, following the transfer of NAS Miramar to the Marine Corps and its redesignation as MCAS Miramar. This move resulted in the construction of a new ramp, hangars and academic buildings. The new command, the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC), was established on 11 July 1996 and was a unification of TOPGUN, Strike University (Strike U), the Naval Strike Warfare Center, and TOPDOME, the Carrier Airborne Early Warning Weapons School. In addition to transferring the NSAWC squadron, a Navy Reserve adversary squadron, Fighter Squadron Composite THIRTEEN (VFC-13), the &quot;Saints,&quot; was also permanently relocated from its former base at NAS Miramar to NAS Fallon. As a result, VFC-13 replaced the disestablished VFA-127 in the fighter adversary role.

Associated bombing ranges checker the surrounding Lahontan Valley and Dixie Valley, which is the next valley to the east. Dixie Valley also contains a simulated air defense network, including approximately 20 operational radar installations. Many demilitarized armored vehicles, including some exotics, have been scattered throughout the area, presumably for ambiance. Most of this area is publicly accessible, with the exception of areas immediately surrounding the radar installations. The entire training area surrounding NAS Fallon is known as the Fallon Range Training Complex (FRTC).
===USAF Radar Station===
Between 1956 and 1975, the United States Air Force Air Defense Command (ADC) operated a General Surveillance Radar station at NAS Fallon. The Air Force area was named Fallon Air Force Station (AFS) and designated ADC site SM-156 (later NORAD site Z-156). The 858th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron moved to Fallon AFS from Hamilton Air Force Base (AFB), California in the south central section of NAS Fallon in 1956. It initially activated AN/MPS-7 search and AN/MPS-14 height-finder radar sets, and initially the station functioned as a Ground Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron&#x27;s role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit&#x27;s radar scopes. An AN/FPS-3 search set briefly saw service in 1959.

During 1962 Fallon AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-16 at Stead AFB, Nevada. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 858th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 December 1962. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Also in this time frame, the radar site was relocated from the original location in the south central part of the Naval Air Station grounds to the far southwest corner. At the new SAGE radar site, the squadron used an AN/FPS-35 search radar that replaced the AN/MPS-7 set in 1963. In 1964 an AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar was added.

In addition to the main facility at NAS Fallon, the squadron also operated a remote AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler site:
* Gabbs, NV (SM-156A): 

Around 1965, Fallon became an FAA/ADC joint-use facility. The AN/MPS-14 radar was retired in 1969. In the early 1970s, the AN/FPS-35 was replaced with an AN/FPS-66A.

Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The 858th Radar Sq was inactivated and replaced by the 858th Air Defense Group in March 1970. The upgrade to group status was done because of Fallon AFS&#x27; status as a Backup Interceptor Control (BUIC) master control center site. BUIC sites were alternate control sites in the event that SAGE Direction Centers became disabled and unable to control interceptor aircraft. The group was inactivated and replaced by the 858th Radar Squadron. as defenses against manned bombers were reduced only to be inactivated in June 1975. The group was disbanded in 1984. The FAA retained the AN/FPS-66A search radar, still in-use today and is networked into the Joint Surveillance System (JSS); the radar tower still is painted with red-and-white checkerboard.

==Museum==
The navy maintains the Naval Air Station Fallon Air Park museum on the base.

==Search and rescue team==
Since 1972 the base has had its own search and rescue team. Originally named Desert Angels and later renamed Longhorns, the team&#x27;s mission is to provide SAR support for visiting Carrier Air Groups and other NAS Fallon tenant commands. The Longhorns flew the Bell UH-1N from 1972 to 2009 and the Sikorsky SH-60F from 2009 to 2011. The team currently flies the Sikorsky MH-60S. The Longhorns frequently support civilian search, rescue and medical evacuation efforts in conjunction with local law enforcement, medical and search and rescue agencies.

<doc id="800199" wikidata="Q4287181" url="?curid=800199" title="Medal of a liberated France">
<text>The Medal of a liberated France () was a decoration of the French Republic created by decree on 12 September 1947 and originally named the &quot;Medal of Gratitude of a Liberated France&quot; (). It was intended as a reward for French and foreign nationals that had made a notable contribution to the liberation of France from the German occupation.

A decree of 7 October 1947 defined the medal&#x27;s design and added it would be awarded under the authority of the Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs and Victims of War () on advice from a board composed of twenty-one members including the President of the National Assembly, the Vice-President of the State Council, a representative of the National Council of the Resistance, a general officer and a representative of the Justice Ministry.

A later decree of 16 June 1948 gave it its present name and added a member from the Interior Ministry to the board charged with selecting recipients from the applications. A further decree of 4 June 1949 followed by ministerial instructions on 1 December 1950 redefined both the composition of the board and award prerequisites.

The board was composed of:
*Grand chancellor of the Legion of Honour;
*Chancellor of the Order of Liberation;
*Representative of the Keeper of the Seals of France;
*Representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs;
*Representative of the Ministry of the Interior;
*General officer designated by the Minister of Defence;
*Four representatives from veterans&#x27; and war victims&#x27; organizations designated by the minister. This number was brought up to five by a decree of 19 January 1950 and to six by a decree of 20 April 1951.

==Award statute==
The Medal of a liberated France could be awarded:
*To soldiers of the allied armies who participated in war operations on the soil of Metropolitan France or soil under French mandate between 3 September 1939 and 20 August 1945; 
*To soldiers of allied armies who served as liaison with the French forces between 18 June 1940 and 20 August 1945; 
*To French nationals who made a notable contribution to the liberation of Metropolitan France or soil under French mandate between 18 June 1940 and 20 August 1945. 
Recipients of the following French awards received in conjunction with the liberation of France could not receive the Medal of a liberated France:
*Legion of Honour for feats with the resistance; 
*Cross of the Order of Liberation; 
*Military Medal for feats with the resistance; 
*Resistance Medal; 
*Medal of French Gratitude for feats with the resistance.

==Award description==
The Medal of a liberated France was a 35mm in diameter circular medal struck from bronze. The obverse bore the relief image of France with the relief date &quot;1944&quot; at its center. A relief chain encircles the image of France with two breaks in its links, one North-east, the other South-west, symbolizing the allied landings. The reverse bore the relief image of a Fasces below a Phrygian cap bisecting the initials &quot;R.F.&quot; and the relief inscription &quot;LA FRANCE A SES LIBERATEURS&quot; () along the upper and lower circumference.

The medal hung from a 36mm wide rainbow coloured silk moiré ribbon, the colours placed opposite those of the ribbon of the 1914–1918 Inter-Allied Victory medal with the purple at center.

<text>The following is the 1973–74 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1973 through August 1974. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1972–73 season. All times are Eastern and Pacific, with certain exceptions, such as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

New fall series are highlighted in bold.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.

PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, was in operation, but the schedule was set by each local station.

<text>Valley of Flowers National Park is an Indian national park which was established in 1982. It is located in Chamoli in the state of Uttarakhand and is known for its meadows of endemic alpine flowers and the variety of flora. This richly diverse area is also home to rare and endangered animals, including the Asiatic black bear, snow leopard, musk deer, brown bear, red fox and blue sheep. Birds found in the park include Himalayan monal pheasant and other high-altitude birds.

At 3,352 to 3,658 meters above sea level, the gentle landscape of the Valley of Flowers National Park complements the rugged mountain wilderness of Nanda Devi National Park to the east. Together, they encompass a unique transition zone between the mountain ranges of the Zanskar and Great Himalayas. The park stretches over 87.50 km2 and is about 8 km long and 2 km wide. It lies completely in the temperate alpine zone. Both parks are encompassed in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (223,674 ha) which is further surrounded by a buffer zone (5,148.57 km2). Nanda Devi National Park Reserve is in the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves.

The park is open only during summer from June to October and is covered by heavy snow for the rest of the year.

==History==

===Documented explorers ===

The place was little known to the outside world due to its inaccessibility. In 1931, Frank S. Smythe, Eric Shipton and R. L. Holdsworth, all British mountaineers, lost their way while returning from a successful expedition to Mt. Kamet and happened upon the valley, which was full of flowers. They were attracted to the beauty of the area and named it the &quot;Valley of Flowers.&quot; Smythe later authored a book of the same name.

In 1939, Lady Joan Margaret Legge, (21 February 1885 – 4 July 1939) a botanist deputed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, arrived at the valley to study flowers and while traversing some rocky slopes to collect flowers, she slipped and died. Her sister later visited the valley and erected a memorial near the spot.

Prof. Chandra Prakash Kala, a botanist deputed by the Wildlife Institute of India, carried out a research study on the floristics and conservation of the valley for a decade, beginning in 1993. He made an inventory of 520 alpine plants exclusively growing in this national park and authored two books – &quot;The Valley of Flowers – Myth and Reality&quot; and &quot;Ecology and Conservation of the Valley of Flowers National Park, Garhwal Himalaya&quot;.

===Timeline===

1962: Border disputes closed the area to traffic, altering the local economy;

1974–82: The sanctuary was opened to mountaineering, but the ensuing degradation led to its closure to all users;

1980: The park was established as Sanjay Gandhi National Park by Notification 3912/ XIV 3-35-80; grazing and mountaineering stopped;

1980: The Valley of Flowers was declared a national park by Government Order 4278/XIV-3-66-80 under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, for the conservation of its flora;

1982: The park was renamed Nanda Devi National Park;

1988: The Nanda Devi National Biosphere Reserve established (223,674 ha) with the national park as core zone (62,462 ha) and a 514,857 ha buffer area surrounding both sites; restrictions were imposed on the rights of nearby villagers. Inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site;

2000: The Biosphere Reserve extended by the government to 586,069 ha and the Valley of Flowers National Park was added as the second core zone (62,462 ha+ 8,750 ha, totalling core areas of 71,212 ha);

2004: The two core zones and buffer zone designated a UNESCO MAB reserve.

==Geoclimatic ==

==Location ==

Getting to the Valley of Flowers requires a trek of about 17 km (10.5 mi). The nearest major town is Joshimath in Garhwal, which has convenient road connections from Haridwar and Dehradun, both about 270 km (168 mi) south of Joshimath. From Delhi, one can take the train to Haridwar and then travel by bus to Govindghat via Rishikesh. Govindghat is approximately 24 km before another important destination of Badrinath. It is also possible to drive from Delhi to Govindghat, a distance of about 500 km.

Govindghat is a small place close to Joshimath (around one hour driving distance), where the trek begins. From Govindghat, shared taxis up to 4 km and then a trek of less than 11 km (8.6 mi) brings trekkers to Ghangaria, a small settlement located about 3 km (about 2 mi) from the valley. One can also hire a porter, mule or helicopter to reach Ghangaria. The trek from Govindghat to Ghangaria is common to the Gurudwara Shri Hemkund Sahib Sikh Temple at Hemkund and a trekker is likely to find many Sikh pilgrims on the route. As one nears Ghangaria, one is greeted by fields of perfumed wild flowers, wild rose bushes and wild strawberries by the sides of the path. Visitors to the Valley of Flowers need to get a permit from the Forest Department, at Ghangaria. The permit is valid for three days. Only visiting and trekking are allowed during the day time.

Visitors are not allowed to stay inside the National park and accommodation can be obtained at Ghangaria. The best time to visit is between July and early September, when the valley is full of flowers, just after the outbreak of monsoon.

===Geography===

The Valley of Flowers is nestled in the Pushpawati river valley which is in the upper expanses of Bhyundar Ganga river near Joshimath in Garhwal region. The lower reaches of Bhyundar Ganga near Gobindghat are known as Bhyundar Valley. The Valley of Flowers, which lies between 30° 41&#x27; to 30° 48&#x27;N and 79° 33&#x27; to 79° 46&#x27;E, in the Pushpawati valley is 20 km northwest of Nanda Devi National Park across the wide valley of the Bhyundar Ganga. It is one of two hanging valleys lying at the head of the Bhyundar valley, the other being the shorter Hemkund valley which runs parallel to Valley of Flowers some 10 km south. Valley of Flowers runs east–west approximately 15 km in length with average width of 6 km. A small tributary of Pushpawati river originates from Tipra glacier from Gauri Parbat in the east and flows through the Valley of Flowers.

The area lies on the Zanskar range of the Himalayas with the highest point in the national park being Gauri parbat at 6,719 m above sea level.

===Climate===
Being an inner Himalayan valley, the Nanda Devi Basin has a distinctive micro-climate. Conditions are generally dry with low annual precipitation, but there is heavy monsoon rainfall from late June to early September. Prevailing mist and low cloud during the monsoon keeps the soil moist, hence the vegetation is lusher than is usual in the drier inner Himalayan valleys. From mid April to June temperatures are moderate to cool (19 °C maximum). The Valley of Flowers also has the micro-climate of an enclosed inner Himalayan valley, and is shielded from the full impact of the southwest summer monsoon by the Greater Himalaya range to its south. There is often dense fog and rain especially during the late summer monsoon. Both Basin and Valley are usually snow-bound for six to seven months between late October and late March, the snow accumulating deeper and at lower altitudes on the shadowed southern than on the northern side of the valleys.

==Ecology ==

===Biodiversity ===

The Valley of Flowers is a high-altitude Himalayan valley that has long been acknowledged by renowned mountaineers, botanists, and in literature. It has been recognized internationally for over a century and is referenced in the Hindu religion. Local people have visited the valley since ancient times. Indian yogis are known to have visited the valley for meditation. The Valley of Flowers has many different colorful flowers, taking on various shades of color&#x27;s as time progressed.

The Valley of Flowers has gained importance as a region containing a diversity of alpine flora, representative of the Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows ecoregion. The rich diversity of species reflects the valley&#x27;s location within a transition zone between the Zanskar and Great Himalayas ranges to the north and south, respectively, and between the Eastern Himalaya and Western Himalaya flora. A number of plant species are considered threatened. Several have not been recorded outside of Uttarakhand. Two have not been recorded in Nanda Devi National Park. The diversity of threatened species of medicinal plants is higher than has been recorded in other Indian Himalayan protected areas. The entire Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve lies within the Western Himalayas Endemic Bird Area (EBA). The Valley of Flowers National Park is the second core zone of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve. Seven restricted-range bird species are endemic to this part of the EBA.
===Flora ===

====Three types of sub-alpine zones ====

The valley has three types of sub-alpine zones as follows: foothills alpine between 3,200 m and 3,500 m which is the upper height limit for trees, lower alpine between 3,500 m and 3,700 m, and higher alpine above 3,700 m. The habitats include valley bottom, river bed, small forests, meadows, eroded, scrubby and stable slopes, moraine, plateau, bogs, stone desert and caves. The lower surrounding hills in the buffer zone are thickly forested. The Forest Research Institute in 1992 recorded 600 species of angiosperms and 30 pteridophytes in the valley and surroundings, discovering 58 new records for the valley of which 4 were new for Himalayan state. Of these plants, 5 out of 6 species globally threatened are not found in Nanda Devi National Park or elsewhere in Uttarakhand: &quot;Aconitum falconeri&quot;, &quot;A. balfouri&quot;, Himalayan maple (&quot;Acer caesium&quot;), the blue Himalayan poppy (&quot;Meconopsis aculeata&quot;) and &quot;Saussurea atkinsoni&quot;. 31 species of rare and endangered categories were observed within the national park in 1998. Further his studies report that the dominant family in Valley of Flowers is Asteraceae with 62 species. 45 medicinal plants are used by local villagers and several species, such as &quot;Saussurea obvallata&quot; (brahmakamal) are collected as religious offerings to goddesses Nanda Devi and Sunanda Devi. The site is designated a Centre of Plant Diversity.

Characteristic of the sub-alpine zone are high altitude forests which help to retain moisture and snow and support a large number of floral and faunal communities. It is dominated by the uncommon Himalayan maple &quot;Acer caesium&quot; (VU), west Himalayan fir &quot;Abies pindrow&quot;, Himalayan white birch &quot;Betula utilis&quot;, and &quot;Rhododendron campanulatum&quot; with Himalayan yew &quot;Taxus wallichiana&quot;, &quot;Syringa emodi&quot; and &quot;Sorbus lanata&quot;. Some of the common herbs are &quot;Arisaema jacquemontii&quot;, &quot;Boschniakia himalaica&quot;, &quot;Corydalis cashmeriana&quot;, &quot;Polemonium caerulium&quot;, &quot;Impatiens sulcata&quot;, &quot;Geranium wallichianum&quot;, &quot;Galium aparine&quot;, &quot;Morina longifolia&quot;, &quot;Inula grandiflora&quot;, &quot;Nomochoris oxypetala&quot;, &quot;nemone rivularis&quot;, &quot;Pedicularis pectinata&quot;, &quot;P. bicornuta&quot;, &quot;Primula denticulate&quot; and &quot;Trillidium govanianum&quot;. In trampled areas where past livestock congregated, Himalayan knotweed &quot;Polygonum polystachium&quot; is a rampant weed.

====Flowers====

The flowers were surveyed and inventoried in 1987 by the Botanical Survey of India, in 1992 by the Forest Research Institute and in 1997 by the Wildlife Institute of India which found five species new to science.

Flowers mostly orchids, poppies, primulas, marigold, daisies and anemones carpet the ground. Sub-alpine forests of birch and rhododendron cover parts of the park&#x27;s area. A decade long study by C.P. Kala from 1993 onward concludes that the Valley of Flowers is endowed with 520 species of higher plants (angiosperms, gymnosperms and pteridophytes), of these 498 are flowering plants. The park has many species of medicinal plants including &quot;Dactylorhiza hatagirea&quot;, &quot;Picrorhiza kurrooa&quot;, &quot;Aconitum violaceum&quot;, &quot;Polygonatum multiflorum&quot;, &quot;Fritillaria roylei&quot; and &quot;Podophyllum hexandrum&quot;.

===Fauna ===

====Species diversity ====

The density of wild animals in the valley is not high, but all the animals found are rare or endangered. Prior to 2004, a total 13 species of mammals are recorded for the park by CP Kala and its vicinity although only he sighted 9 species directly: northern plains gray langur &quot;Semnopithecus entellus&quot;, red giant flying squirrel &quot;Petaurista petaurista&quot;, Himalayan black bear &quot;Ursus thibetanus (VU)&quot;, red fox &quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;, Himalayan weasel &quot;Mustela sibirica&quot;, and Himalayan yellow-throated marten &quot;Martes flavigula&quot;, Himalayan goral &quot;Naemorhedus goral&quot;, Himalayan musk deer &quot;Moschus leucogaster&quot;, Indian spotted chevrotain &quot;Moschiola indica&quot;, Himalayan tahr &quot;Hemitragus jemlahicus (VU)&quot; and serow &quot;Capricornis sumatraensis (VU)&quot;. The tahr is common, the serow, goral, musk deer and bharal, blue sheep are rare. 
====Predators, leopards and bears ====

An October 2004 faunal survey established the presence of snow leopard &quot;Panthera uncia&quot; (EN) in the national park. The common leopard &quot;Panthera pardus&quot; is reported from lower parts of the valley closer to the villages. Local people have also reported evidence of brown bear &quot;Ursus arctos&quot; and bharal or blue sheep &quot;Pseudois nayaur&quot;.

====Reptiles ====

Among the reptiles, most often seen are the high altitude lizard &quot;Agama tuberculata&quot;, Himalayan ground skink &quot;Leiolopisma himalayana&quot; and Himalayan pit viper &quot;Gloydius himalayanus&quot;. Along with the flowers are wild bees and many species of butterfly which need to be more researched. A few of the more evident species are lime butterfly &quot;Papilio demoleus demoleus&quot;, common yellow swallowtail &quot;Papilio machaon&quot;, common Mormon &quot;Papilio polytes romulus&quot;, spangle &quot;Papilio protenor protenor&quot; and common blue apollo &quot;Parnassius hardwickei&quot;.

====Birds ====

The area is within the West Himalayan Endemic Bird Area but there have been no surveys specific to the Valley. 114 species were seen in 1993 in Nanda Devi Park. Species frequently seen in the valley include lammergeier &quot;Gypaetus barbatus&quot;, Himalayan vulture &quot;Gyps himalayensis&quot;, Yellow-billed and Red-billed choughs &quot;Pyrrhocorax graculus&quot; and &quot;P. pyrrhocorax&quot;, koklass pheasant &quot;Pucrasia macrolopha&quot;, the nationally listed Himalayan monal pheasant &quot;Lophophorus impejanus&quot;, found in rhododendron thickets, scaly-bellied and yellownape woodpeckers &quot;Picus squamatus&quot; and &quot;P. flavinucha&quot;, great and blue-throated barbets &quot;Megalaima virens&quot; and &quot;M. asiatica&quot;, snow pigeon &quot;Columba leuconota&quot; and spotted dove &quot;Stigmatopelia chinensis&quot;.

== Conservation==

===Conservation management===

The park is administered by the Uttarakhand State Forestry Department, the national Ministry of Environment and Forests, India. There is no settlement in the national park and grazing in the area has been banned since 1983. The park is open only for 4 to 5 months during summer from June to October.

===Research nursery and seed bank ===

A research nursery and seed/rhizome/tuber bank for propagating rare plants and valuable medicinal herbs has been created at Musadhar near the entrance of the site. Rare and valuable medicinal plants are the subject of special programs. These include &quot;Aconitum heterophyllum&quot;, &quot;A. falconeri&quot;, &quot;Arnebia benthamii&quot;, &quot;Dactylorhiza hatagirea&quot;, &quot;Gymnadenia orchides&quot;, &quot;Megacarpaea polyandra&quot;, &quot;Picrorhiza kurrooa&quot;, &quot;Podophyllum hexandrum&quot; and &quot;Taxus wallichiana&quot;. Research plots have been set up to determine the best way to control the spread of the tall Himalayan knotweed &quot;Polygonum polystachium&quot; without damaging other plants or the surface of the soil. A first annual survey was conducted in 2004 and will be repeated annually.

<text>The School of Informatics is an academic unit of the University of Edinburgh, in Scotland, responsible for research, teaching, outreach and commercialisation in informatics. It was created in 1998 from the former department of artificial intelligence, the Centre for Cognitive Science and the department of computer science, along with the Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (AIAI) and the Human Communication Research Centre.

Research in the School of Informatics draws on multiple disciplines. The school is particularly known for research in the areas of artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, systems biology, mathematical logic and theoretical computer science; but also contributes to many other areas of informatics.

The School of Informatics is ranked 20th in the world by the QS World University Rankings 2023. As of 2022, the school is ranked 1st in the UK according to &quot;CSRankings&quot;, 1st in the UK in the latest 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF) by research power, and 1st in the world for natural language processing (NLP).

== Research ==




The School of Informatics was awarded a 5*A in the UK HEFCE&#x27;s 2001 RAE, the only computer science department in the country to achieve this highest possible rating. In the 2008 RAE, the School&#x27;s &quot;Quality Profile&quot; was 35/50/15/0/0, which means that of the over 100 Full-time equivalent (FTE) staff research outputs evaluated, 35% were found &quot;world-leading (4*)&quot; and 50% &quot;internationally excellent (3*)&quot;. These figures can be interpreted in a number of ways, but place the School first by volume and tied for second (following Cambridge with 45/45/10/0/0) by percentage of research rated 3* or 4*. 

The School has a number of research Institutes:

=== Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation: ANC===
ANC investigates theoretical and empirical study of brain processes and artificial learning systems, drawing on neuroscience, cognitive science, computer science, computational science, mathematics and statistics.

=== Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Institute: AIAI ===
Previously known as CISA (Centre for Intelligent Systems and their Applications), the Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Institute (AIAI) works on the foundations of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, and their application to real-world problems.

===Institute for Language, Cognition, and Computation: ILCC===
ILCC performs research on all aspects of natural language processing, drawing on machine learning, statistical modeling, and computational, psychological, and linguistic theories of communication among humans and between humans and machines using text, speech and other modalities.

===Institute for Computing Systems Architecture: ICSA===
ICSA performs research on architecture and engineering of future computing systems: performance and scalability; innovative algorithms, architectures, compilers, languages and protocols.

===Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour: IPAB===
IPAB links computational action, perception, representation, transformation and generation processes to real or virtual worlds: statistical machine learning, computer vision, mobile and humanoid robotics, motor control, graphics and visualization.

=== Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science: LFCS===

The LFCS Develops and applies foundational understanding of computation and communication: formal models, mathematical theories, and software tools.

<text>STUCCO Housing Co-operative is a student housing co-operative in Sydney, Australia. Officially opened on 21 February 1992, it was the first of its kind in Australia, though there is now also the Canberra Student Housing Cooperative. Its name is a contraction of &quot;Student Co-operative&quot; rather than a reference to the rendered coatings on the external brickwork in the STUCCO building.

==History==
The Co-operative is located on the heritage-listed former F. W. Gissing glass factory at 197-207 Wilson Street Newtown, New South Wales. While adaptively reused as student housing, the building retains its architectural integrity as a recognisable former factory. With its surviving Federation and inter-war features, industrial character, consistent building form of brick bays and parapet walls and three street frontages, the building makes an important contribution to surrounding streetscapes. The building is a distinctive feature of Wilson Street, which is visible from a number of near and distant vantage points.

It is a 40-member Housing Co-operative made up of both undergraduate and postgraduate full-time students of the University of Sydney who hold Australian citizenship. Stucco regularly holds charity events such as art exhibitions, live music performances, discussion groups, and parties. Stucco also allows community groups to utilise the space for their own events and has had the pleasure of hosting groups such as The Beautiful Minds Project, the Solidarity Choir, and Adventure Time. Stucco has been able to support political organisations such as Refugee Action Coalition and the Redfern Tent Embassy, utilising its resources and space to benefit the community.

==Stucco Solar Project==

In 2015, the City of Sydney Council afforded Stucco an &quot;Environmental Performance Innovation Grant&quot; to help Stucco create the first multi-unit residence to achieve a unified solar panel and battery network in Australia.

The solar system is a test case and demonstration of solar–photovoltaic and battery storage installation in the context of multi-unit residences. The system holds 114 panels and 36 batteries, producing 30 kWh with storage capacity for 42.3 kW.

The project was managed by Louis Janse van Rensburg and Bjorn Sturmberg, both former residents of Stucco, with media and publicity handled by Sarah King (2016 President of Stucco).

<text>Francesco Ioele (; January 22, 1893 – July 1, 1928), known as Frankie Yale or Frankie Uale, was an American gangster based in Brooklyn and the second employer of Al Capone.

==Early life==
Yale was born in Longobucco, Italy, on January 22, 1893, to Domenico and Isabella (née DeSimone) Ioele. He had an older brother, John, and two younger siblings, Assunta and Angelo. He and his family arrived in the United States c. 1900. As a teenager, Ioele was befriended by John Torrio, who ushered him into the Five Points Gang and groomed him for a life of crime. Shortly after Torrio left for Chicago, in 1909, Ioele &quot;Americanized&quot; his last name to Yale. Despite his medium height and chubby build, Yale was a fearsome fistfighter and thief. In 1910, at age 17, Yale and a friend, a wrestler named Bobby Nelson, severely beat several men during a fight in the Coney Island pool hall, which involved cracking pool cues and hurling billiard balls. One of his early arrests, in October 1912, was on suspicion of homicide.

==Brooklyn crime boss==
Like his mentor Johnny Torrio, Yale was one of a new breed of gangster who believed in putting business ahead of ego. After getting started with some basic racketeering, Yale took control of Brooklyn&#x27;s ice delivery trade by selling &quot;protection&quot; and creating monopolies. In 1917, with the proceeds from these rackets, Yale opened the Harvard Inn bar on Seaside Walk in Coney Island. Hoping to capitalize on the collegiate name of his bar, he began using the name Yale. It was at the Harvard Inn that a young bouncer named Al Capone got his famous facial scars in a dispute with Frank Galluccio, after Capone flirted with Galluccio&#x27;s sister. After two years in Yale&#x27;s employ, Capone was shipped off west to Chicago by Yale, and joined Torrio&#x27;s organization.

Yale&#x27;s gang engaged in Black Hand extortion activities and ran a string of brothels. Their gang became the first new-style Mafia &quot;family&quot; which included Italians from all regions and could work in partnership with other ethnic groups if it was good for business. Yale&#x27;s &quot;services&quot; to his customers included offering &quot;protection&quot; to local merchants and controlling food services for restaurants, as well as ice deliveries for Brooklyn residents. Yale&#x27;s notorious sideline was his line of cigars, foul-smelling stogies packaged in boxes that bore his smiling face. Yale also owned and operated Uliano &amp; Yale funeral home at 6604 14th Avenue (he and his family lived across the street). When asked about his profession, Yale wryly commented that he was an &quot;undertaker&quot;. At the beginning of Prohibition, Yale became one of Brooklyn&#x27;s biggest bootleggers.

In addition to Capone, other gangsters who worked under Yale at one time or another included Joe Adonis, Anthony &quot;Little Augie&quot; Carfano, and Albert Anastasia. Yale&#x27;s top assassin was Willie &quot;Two-Knife&quot; Altieri, nicknamed as such due to his preferred method of dispatching a victim.

==Personal life==
Soon after the Harvard Inn opened, Yale married Maria Delapia, with whom he had two daughters, Rosa and Isabella. They later separated, he married a younger woman called Lucita in 1927 and they had a daughter, Angelina. Yale was also noted as a stylish dresser, favoring expensive suits and diamond jewelry. One newspaper reporter called him the &quot;Beau Brummell of Brooklyn&quot;. Yale was also known for generosity toward the less fortunate people in his neighborhood, who often approached him and requested financial assistance. After a local delicatessen owner was robbed, Yale replaced his lost cash. When a fish peddler lost his cart, Yale gave him $200 with an admonition: &quot;Get a horse, you&#x27;re too old to walk&quot;. Yale was dubbed the &quot;Prince of Pals&quot;.

Conversely, Yale was a violent man who did not hesitate to inflict pain on others. When angered by his younger brother Angelo, Yale beat him so badly that he wound up in the hospital. When two extortionists attempted to shake down the popular hat-check operator of a neighborhood restaurant, Yale battered the two unconscious. In May 1920, Yale traveled to Chicago and personally killed longtime gang boss Big Jim Colosimo at the behest of Chicago Outfit friends Torrio and Capone. Colosimo was allegedly murdered because he stood in the way of his gang making huge bootlegging profits in Chicago. Although suspected by Chicago police, Yale was never officially charged.

==Rivals==
Tradition has long claimed that Yale fought a desperate gang war for control of the Brooklyn docks with the Irish White Hand Gang. Recent research has called much of that into question and indicated that Yale&#x27;s worst enemies were not the Irish waterfront racketeers but rival Italian crime families who were constantly jockeying for power in Brooklyn during the 1920s.

The first known attempt on Yale&#x27;s life occurred on February 6, 1921, when he and two of his men were ambushed in Lower Manhattan after they stepped from their car in order to attend a banquet. One of Yale&#x27;s bodyguards was killed and the other wounded, with Yale himself sustaining a severe lung wound. Yale pulled through after an extended recovery.

Five months after Yale&#x27;s injury, on July 15, 1921, he, his brother Angelo, and four men were driving on Cropsey Avenue in Bath Beach when another car filled with rival gunmen overtook them and opened fire. Angelo and one of Yale&#x27;s men were wounded. This attack was believed to have been carried out in revenge for the June 5 killing of a Manhattan mobster named Ernesto Melchiorre, who had been murdered after a late-night visit to the Harvard Inn. Melchiorre&#x27;s brother Silvio was believed to have been the driving force behind the unsuccessful attack. Eight days later, Yale&#x27;s men gunned down Silvio Melchiorre in front of his Little Italy cafe.

Yet another attempt on Yale&#x27;s life took place on July 9, 1923. Yale&#x27;s chauffeur, Frank Forte, had taken the Yale family to a christening at a nearby church. While Yale decided to walk back to his 14th Avenue home, Forte drove Maria Yale and her two daughters back. As the women exited the vehicle a carload of four gangsters rolled past, mistook Frank Forte for his boss, and shot him.

==O&#x27;Banion murder==
In November 1924, Yale was asked once again to come to Chicago to assist Capone and Torrio, who needed another rival murdered. On November 10, 1924, Yale, John Scalise, and Albert Anselmi reportedly entered the Schofield Flower Shop and killed North Side Gang leader Dean O&#x27;Banion. Eight days later, the Chicago Police arrested Yale and Sam Pollaccia at Chicago&#x27;s Union Station as they were about to depart for New York. Yale said he had come to town for the funeral of Unione Siciliana president Mike Merlo and stayed to see old friends. Yale further claimed to be having lunch at the time of O&#x27;Banion&#x27;s murder. Police could not shake his alibi and were compelled to release him.

==The Adonis Club incident==
In the early morning hours of December 26, 1925, White Hand gang boss Richard &quot;Pegleg&quot; Lonergan and a few of his men were attacked at Brooklyn&#x27;s Adonis Club by a handful of Yale&#x27;s men and a visiting Al Capone (Capone&#x27;s son Sonny had just had an operation for a mastoid infection in New York). Lonergan planned on leading his men into the club to attack the Yale crew as they gathered for their annual Christmas party. Instead, Yale had Al Capone and his men set up an ambush and open fire on Lonergan, Aaron Harms, James &quot;Ragtime&quot; Howard, Paddy Maloney, Cornelius &quot;Needles&quot; Ferry, and James Hart. Lonergan, Ferry, and Harms were all killed while Hart was severely wounded.

An examination of the original police reports and witness accounts does not support this version. According to author Patrick Downey, the Adonis Club shootings were most probably a spur-of-the-moment reaction to a drunken argument that Needles Ferry had engaged in with Capone and his companions.

==Downfall==
By the mid-1920s, Yale was noted as one of the most powerful gangsters in Brooklyn. In addition to his numerous rackets, Yale made inroads into labor racketeering and dockside extortion as well. In spring of 1927, however, Yale&#x27;s long friendship with Capone began to fray. As a major importer of Canadian whisky, Yale supplied much of Capone&#x27;s whiskey. Yale would oversee the landing of the booze and make sure the Chicago-bound trucks made it safely through New York. Soon, many of the trucks began being hijacked before they left Brooklyn. Suspecting a double cross, Capone asked an old pal James &quot;Filesy&quot; DeAmato to keep an eye on his trucks. DeAmato reported that Yale was indeed hijacking his booze. Soon after this, Capone&#x27;s spy realized that his cover had been blown and tried unsuccessfully to shoot Yale on the night of July 1, 1927. Six nights later, DeAmato was gunned down on a Brooklyn street corner.

In a last-ditch effort to mend the relationship with his longtime friend, Capone invited Yale to Chicago to view the Dempsey-Tunney heavyweight title rematch at Soldier Field on September 22, 1927. While their visit was civil enough, the pair&#x27;s friendship began to rapidly deteriorate after Yale returned to New York. Distracted by a gang war with rival mobster Joe Aiello, a brief exile from Chicago, and the 1928 Republican primary election, Capone had to wait until the spring of 1928 to plan retaliation.
On July 1, 1928, a Sunday afternoon, Yale was in his Sunrise Club, located at 14th Avenue and 65th Street, when he received a cryptic phone call. The caller said something was wrong with Yale&#x27;s new wife Lucy, who was at home looking after their year-old daughter. Refusing Joseph Piraino&#x27;s offer to drive him, Yale dashed out to his brand new, coffee-colored Lincoln coupe and took off up New Utrecht Avenue, where a Buick sedan carrying four armed individuals stopped next to him. While Yale&#x27;s new Lincoln was fashioned with armor plating, the dealer had neglected to bullet-proof the windows. Recognizing his peril, when the light changed, Yale took off. After a chase up New Utrecht, Yale swerved west onto 44th Street, with the Buick close behind. Yale&#x27;s car was soon overtaken by the Buick, whose occupants opened fire at close range. A shotgun blast struck the Brooklyn gang boss on the left side of the head while a submachine gun bullet sliced through his brain. Either wound would have killed Yale instantly. The now out-of-control Lincoln veered to the right, hopped the curb, and crashed into the stoop of a brownstone at No. 923. This was the first time a submachine gun had been used in a gangland killing in New York City. On August 2, 1928, it was reported that two men were being sought for the murder of Yale, but his murderers have never been identified.

==Aftermath==
The abandoned Buick was later discovered a few blocks away from the murder site. Inside the car police found a .38 caliber revolver, a .45 automatic, a sawed-off pump shotgun and a Thompson submachine gun. The handguns were eventually traced to Miami, the car itself was traced to Knoxville, Tennessee, and the submachine gun to a Chicago sporting goods dealer named Peter von Frantzius. Police noted that at the time of murder, Yale was wearing a four-carat diamond ring, as well as a belt buckle engraved with his initials. The letters on the buckle held a total of 75 diamond chips. Capone was said to give such belt buckles to those he admired very much.

Police repeatedly questioned Capone about the Yale murder, but nothing came of the inquiries. Yale&#x27;s murder represented the first time that the Thompson submachine gun was used in New York gangland warfare. Yale&#x27;s killers were theorized to be Capone mob gunmen Tony &quot;Joe Batters&quot; Accardo, Fred &quot;Killer&quot; Burke, Gus Winkler, George &quot;Shotgun&quot; Ziegler, and Louis &quot;Little New York&quot; Campagna. Most of these hitmen are believed to have participated in the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre seven months later. One of the submachine guns used in the Massacre was later ballistically linked to Yale&#x27;s murder.

Yale received one of the most impressive gangland funerals in American history, at which thousands of Brooklynites lined the streets to watch the procession. He was buried wearing evening clothes, holding grey suede gloves and a gold rosary. Thirty-eight cars were required to bear all the floral arrangements while 250 Cadillac limousines carried the mourners. Yale&#x27;s $15,000 silver casket rested on an open hearse with a podium. At Holy Cross Cemetery, there was additional drama when two different women claimed to be Yale&#x27;s wife. As the casket was lowered, 112 mourners simultaneously tossed roses into the grave. Yale&#x27;s funeral set a standard of opulence for American gangsters that has been seldom matched over the years.

==Legacy==
While Yale is somewhat overlooked in crime histories, he was one of New York&#x27;s leading gangsters in the 1920s. In the initial aftermath of Yale&#x27;s murder, leadership of his family was taken over by Anthony Carfano. Four months later Joe Masseria orchestrated the murder of mobster Salvatore D&#x27;Aquila. The December 1928 Hotel Statler meeting in Cleveland was most probably called to head off a potential New York gang war. Roughly half of Yale&#x27;s men and territory were absorbed by the D&#x27;Aquila crime family, which was now led by Al Mineo, while the rest remained under Carfano. Yale&#x27;s murder turned out to be the first in a series of events that facilitated Masseria&#x27;s attempt to consolidate all of New York&#x27;s Mafia families under his control, which eventually resulted in the Castellammarese War.

==In popular culture==
*Yale is mentioned in Arthur Miller&#x27;s play &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;.
*Yale&#x27;s story was given the comic book treatment in &quot;All True Detective Cases&quot; No. 2, Avon Comics April/May 1954.
*Yale is portrayed by John Cassavetes in the 1975 film &quot;Capone&quot;.
*Yale is played by Robert Ellenstein in the TV series &quot;The Lawless Years&quot; and by Al Ruscio in the original &quot;The Untouchables&quot; television series. A much more simplified depiction of his murder was featured in the opening scene of an episode of the remake series.
*He is portrayed by Joseph Riccobene in the HBO Series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;.

<text>23 Skidoo are a British band playing a fusion of industrial, post-punk, funk, and world music.

==History==
Formed in 1979 by Fritz Catlin, Johnny Turnbull and Sam Mills, and later augmented by Alex Turnbull and Tom Heslop, 23 Skidoo had interests in martial arts, Burundi and Kodo drumming, Fela Kuti, The Last Poets, William S. Burroughs, as well as the emerging confluence of industrial, post-punk and funk, heard in artists such as A Certain Ratio, Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, The Pop Group and This Heat.

Their first 7&quot;, &quot;Ethics&quot;, was released in 1980, followed by &quot;The Gospel Comes To New Guinea&quot; &amp; &quot;Last Words&quot; 12&quot; single which was co-produced by Stephen Mallinder, Richard H. Kirk and Chris Watson from Cabaret Voltaire at their studio, The Western Works in Sheffield. A Peel Session was recorded on 16 September 1981. Their début album, &quot;Seven Songs&quot;, was released in 1982 and is said to evoke the claustrophobic humidity of an African forest. The album went straight to number 1 in the Independent charts. &quot;Seven Songs&quot;, which was recorded and mixed in three days, was co-produced by Tony, Terry and David, aka Genesis P-Orridge, and Peter Christopherson of Throbbing Gristle/Psychic TV and engineer Ken Thomas. A hastily executed EP, &quot;Tearing Up The Plans,&quot; was produced in the absence of the Turnbull brothers, who were travelling in Indonesia. The personality clashes that arose from this experiment resulted in guitarist Sam Mills and vocalist Tom Heslop leaving the band soon after. The band performed for the first time as a three piece, joined onstage by David Tibet of Current 93, at the first WOMAD festival. This live performance would go on to become the first side of the band&#x27;s most challenging release, &quot;The Culling Is Coming,&quot; which also features Skidoo&#x27;s exploration into gamelan on side two. The album resulted in the band being criticised for being &#x27;too abstract&#x27;.

1984 saw the arrival of bassist Peter &quot;Sketch&quot; Martin following the break-up of Linx. Skidoo recruited Aswad&#x27;s horn section for the &quot;Coup&quot; 12&quot;, which featured samples from Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and which was interpolated from their track &quot;Fuck You G.I.&quot; from the album &quot;Urban Gamelan&quot; (1984). &quot;Urban Gamelan&quot; features Sketch on side one and, on side two, the original three piece line-up experimenting with metal percussion using patterns inspired by gamelan. After having been evicted from their rehearsal space at Genesis P-Orridge&#x27;s &quot;Death Factory&quot; the band shifted their focus towards hip hop and turned their attention to production and building a studio, Precinct 23. In 1987 they released a compilation album, &quot;Just Like Everybody,&quot; featuring work from this period.

In 1987 the Turnbull brothers formed the Ronin label and released &quot;Jailbreak&quot; by Paradox, widely regarded as one of the first breakbeat records, as well as tracks by British photographer Normski and MC FORCE. In its later incarnation, Ronin released material by Deckwrecka, Roots Manuva, Skitz, Mud Family and Rodney P amongst others. They signed to Virgin Records in 1991 and were able to build a new studio with their advance. In 2000 they released a self-titled LP, which featured contributions from Pharoah Sanders and Roots Manuva. This was followed by a compilation of singles, &quot;The Gospel Comes To New Guinea&quot; in 2002, and for the first time on CD, reissues of &quot;Seven Songs&quot; and &quot;Urban Gamelan&quot;. In 2008 the expanded catalogue CD reissues were issued by LTM, who also issued a double-vinyl edition of &quot;Seven Songs&quot; in 2012. This issue featured the 1981 John Peel session and 12&quot; versions of &quot;Last Words&quot; and &quot;The Gospel Comes To New Guinea&quot;. In November 2013, the band played the final holiday camp edition of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Camber Sands, England.

In 2012 Alex Turnbull co-directed &quot;Beyond Time&quot;, a documentary film about his artist father William Turnbull. The film was narrated by Jude Law and scored by 23 Skidoo with both new and old material. The soundtrack album (packaged with a DVD of the film) was released by Les Disques Du Crépuscule in 2014.

<doc id="800255" wikidata="Q3572587" url="?curid=800255" title="York Centre (federal electoral district)">
<text>York Centre () is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1904 to 1917 and since 1953.

As per the 2016 Census, 17.0% of York Centre residents are of Filipino ethnic origin and 16.0% belong to the Filipino visible minority, which are the highest such figures among all City of Toronto ridings. At the same time, the York Centre riding has the highest percentage of residents of Russian (9.5%) and Jewish (5.6%) ethnic origins (in the 2011 National Household Survey, 13.6% of York Centre residents had entered a Jewish ethnic origin). The riding has a large Jewish population, currently the fourth-largest in Canada at 14 percent behind Thornhill, Mount Royal and Eglinton—Lawrence. 

The riding was previously considered one of the safest Liberal Party seats in Canada; however, this changed as the Conservative Party gained ground in the 2000s, and its candidate Mark Adler won the seat in 2011. However, the Liberal Party regained the seat in 2015 with its candidate Michael Levitt. Levitt was re-elected in 2019, and resigned as of September 1, 2020, to become the CEO of the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies. A by-election to fill the vacancy took place on October 26, 2020, which was won by Liberal Ya&#x27;ara Saks.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;
Ethnic groups: 46.9% White, 19.3% Filipino, 8.0% Black, 5.4% Latin American, 4.1% South Asian, 3.7% Southeast Asian, 3.3% Chinese, 2.5% West Asian, 1.6% Korean
Languages: 42.0% English, 9.5% Tagalog, 6.3% Russian, 5.2% Italian, 5.1% Spanish, 2.1% Vietnamese, 1.6% Portuguese, 1.5% Ilocano, 1.4% Korean, 1.3% Mandarin, 1.1% Cantonese, 1.1% Turkish, 1.1% Persian
Religions: 57.3% Christian (36.0% Catholic, 4.4% Christian Orthodox, 1.7% Pentecostal, 15.2% other), 14.3% Jewish, 5.0% Muslim, 2.5% Buddhist, 2.1% Hindu, 18.3% none
Median income: $36,400 (2020) &lt;br&gt;
Average income: $50,440 (2020)

==Geography==

York Centre consists of the part of the City of Toronto bounded on the north by the northern city limit, and on the east, south and west by a line drawn from the city limit south along Bathurst Street, southeast along the Don River West Branch, southwest and west along Highway 401, north along Jane Street, east along Sheppard Avenue West, northwest along Black Creek, east along Grandravine Drive, and north along Keele Street to the city limit.

It contains the neighbourhoods of Westminster–Branson, Bathurst Manor, Wilson Heights, Downsview, and York University Heights (a small section south of Grandravine Drive, east of Black Creek).

At the approximate centre of the district is Downsview Park, an urban park controlled by the federal government, on former grounds of Canadian Forces Base Toronto.

==History==
York Centre was originally created in 1903 from parts of York East and York West ridings. It was created when the county of York (excluding the city of Toronto) was divided into three ridings: York Centre, York North and York South. The centre riding consisted of the townships of Etobicoke, Markham, Scarborough and Vaughan, and the villages of Markham, Richmond Hill, Weston and Woodbridge. The electoral district was abolished in 1914 when it was redistributed between York East, York South and York West. In 1952, York Centre was re-established with parts of Eglinton—Lawrence, Willowdale, York North and York West ridings.

The new riding consisted initially of the part of the township of North York west of Yonge Street, the part of the township of Vaughan south of Highway Number 7, and the town of Woodbridge.

In 1966, it was redefined to consist of the part of Metropolitan Toronto bounded on the north by the northern limit, and on the west, south and east by a line drawn from that borough limit south along Highway 400, east along Sheppard Avenue West, south along Jane Street, southeast along Exbury Road, east along Calvington Drive, south along Keele Street, east along Highway 401, south along the Canadian National Railway line, east along Lawrence Avenue West, north along the Spadina Expressway, northeast along Highway 401, north along Bathurst Street, east along Sheppard Avenue West, south along Easton Street, east along Cameron Avenue, and north along Yonge Street to the Metro Toronto limit. It is unclear why the name York Centre was retained as the district was now predominantly in the Borough of North York rather than in the Region of York.

In 1976, it was redefined to consist of the part of the Borough of North York bounded on the north by the borough limit, and on the west, south and east by a line drawn from the borough limit south along Highway 400, east along Sheppard Avenue West, south along Keele Street, east along Highway 401, north along Bathurst Street, and northwest along the West Branch of the Don River to the borough limit.

In 1987, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of North York bounded on the north by the city limit, and on the east, south and west by a line drawn from the city limit southeast along the Don River West Branch, west along Highway 401, north along Jane Street, east along Grandravine Drive, and north along Black Creek to the northern city limit.

In 1996, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of North York bounded on the north by the city limit, and on the east, south and west by a line drawn from the city limit south along Dufferin Street, west along Sheppard Avenue West, north along Keele Street, west along Grandravine Drive, south along Jane Street, east along Highway 401, northwest along the Don River West Branch, north along Bathurst Street, east along Drewry Avenue, north along Chelmsford Avenue, west along Greenwin Village Road, and north along Village Gate to the city limit.

In 2003, it was given its current boundaries as described above.

This riding lost territory to Willowdale and a small piece to Thornhill during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

The riding did not undergo any boundary changes following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution.

<text>Janine M. Benyus (born 1958) is an American natural sciences writer, innovation consultant, and author. After writing books on wildlife and animal behavior, she coined the term Biomimicry to describe intentional problem-solving design inspired by nature. Her book &quot;Biomimicry&quot; (1997) attracted widespread attention from businesspeople in design, architecture, and engineering as well as from scientists. Benyus argues that by following biomimetic approaches, designers can develop products that will perform better, be less expansive, use less energy, and leave companies less open to legal risk.

==Life==
Born in New Jersey, Benyus graduated summa cum laude from Rutgers University with degrees in natural resource management and English literature/writing. Benyus has taught interpretive writing and lectured at the University of Montana, and worked towards restoring and protecting wild lands. She serves on a number of land use committees in her rural county, and is president of Living Education, a nonprofit dedicated to place-based living and learning. Benyus lives in Stevensville, Montana.

==Biomimicry==
Benyus has written a number of books on animals and their behavior, but is best known for &quot;Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature&quot; (1997). In this book she develops the basic thesis that human beings should consciously emulate nature&#x27;s genius in their designs. She encourages people to ask &quot;What would Nature do?&quot; and to look at natural forms, processes, and ecosystems in nature to see what works and what lasts. 

Benyus articulates an approach that strongly emphasizes sustainability within biomimicry practice. sometimes referred to as Conditions Conducive to Life (CCL).
Benyus has described the development of sustainable solutions in terms of &quot;Life’s Principles&quot;, emphasizing that organisms in nature have evolved methods of working that are not destructive of themselves and their environment. “Nature runs on sunlight, uses only the energy it needs, fits form to function, recycles everything, rewards cooperation, banks on diversity, demands local expertise, curbs excess from within and taps the power of limits”.

In 1998, Benyus and Dayna Baumeister co-founded the Biomimicry Guild as an innovation consultancy. Their goal was to help innovators learn from and emulate natural models in order to design sustainable products, processes, and policies that create conditions conducive to life.

In 2006, Benyus co-founded The Biomimicry Institute with Dayna Baumeister and Bryony Schwan. Benyus is President of the non-profit organization, whose mission is to naturalize biomimicry in the culture by promoting the transfer of ideas, designs, and strategies from biology to sustainable human systems design.
In 2008 the Biomimicry Institute launched AskNature.org, &quot;an encyclopedia of nature&#x27;s solutions to common design problems&quot;. The Biomimicry Institute has become a key communicator in the field of biomimetics, connecting 12,576 member practitioners and organizations in 36 regional networks and 21 countries through its Biomimicry Global Network as of 2020.

In 2010, Benyus, Dayna Baumeister, Bryony Schwan, and Chris Allen formed Biomimicry 3.8, connecting their for-profit and nonprofit work by creating a benefit corporation. Biomimicry 3.8, which achieved B-corp certification, 
offers consultancy, professional training, development for educators, and &quot;inspirational speaking&quot;. Among its more than 250 clients are Nike, Kohler. Seventh Generation and C40 Cities. By 2013, over 100 universities had joined the Biomimicry Educator’s Network, offering training in biomimetics. In 2014, the profit and non-profit aspects again became separate entities, with Biomimicry 3.8 engaging in for-profit consultancy and the Biomimicry Institute as a non-profit organization.

Benyus has served on various boards, including the Board of Directors for the U.S. Green Building Council and the advisory boards of the Ray C. Anderson Foundation and Project Drawdown. Benyus is an affiliate faculty member in The Biomimicry Center at Arizona State University.

Beynus&#x27; work has been used as the basis for films including the two-part film &quot;Biomimicry: Learning from Nature&quot; (2002), directed by Paul Lang and David Springbett for CBC&#x27;s &quot;The Nature of Things&quot; and presented by David Suzuki.
She was one of the experts in the film &quot;Dirt! The Movie&quot; (2009) which was voiced by Jamie Lee Curtis.

<doc id="800269" wikidata="Q64061702" url="?curid=800269" title="Argentina anserina">
<text>Argentina anserina (synonym Potentilla anserina) is a perennial flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is known by the common names silverweed, common silverweed or silver cinquefoil. It is native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, often on river shores and in grassy habitats such as meadows and road-sides.

==Description==

Silverweed is a perennial low-growing herbaceous plant growing up to tall. It has creeping red stolons that can be up to long. The leaves are long, evenly pinnate into in saw-toothed leaflets 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm broad with 6–14 teeth per side, covered with silky white hairs, particularly on the underside. These hairs are also present on the stem and the stolons. These give the leaves the silvery appearance from which the plant gets its name. Each leaf is borne on a channeled petiole up to 5 cm in length with a long sheathing base.

The flowers are produced singly on 5–15 cm long stems, 1.5–2.5 cm diameter with five (rarely up to seven) yellow petals. The fruit is a cluster of dry achenes.

==Taxonomy==
The plant was originally placed in the genus &quot;Potentilla&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (1753), but was reclassified into the resurrected genus &quot;Argentina&quot; by research conducted in the 1990s. The reclassification remains controversial and is not accepted by some authorities. It is a species aggregate which has frequently been divided into multiple species.

==Distribution and habitat==
Silverweed is native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere.

It is most often found in sandy or gravelly soils, where it may spread rapidly by its prolific rooting stolons. It typically occurs in inland habitats, unlike &quot;A. egedii&quot;, which is a salt-tolerant coastal salt marsh plant.

==Uses==
The plant was put in shoes to absorb sweat. It was formerly believed to be useful for epilepsy, and that it could ward off witches and evil spirits.

The plant&#x27;s roots were eaten by some Native American tribes. It has been cultivated as a food crop for its edible roots, which resemble parsnips. It may also become a problem weed in gardens.

Travelers visiting Tibet reported on the food use of the plant&#x27;s root in the region. According to Pyotr Kozlov, who traveled in the Kham region in 1900–1901, Tibetans, who did not have any vegetables other than turnips, would often dig out roots of &quot;Argentina anserina&quot; (whose local name he gave as &quot;djüma&quot;), which could be easily dried and stored for later use. Kozlov even suggested that it would not be a bad idea for Russian peasants to do likewise, especially in famine years. The mission of Sarat Chandra Das to Tibet in the late 19th century reported that the root of the plant, under a Tibetan name variously transcribed as toma, doma or droma, was served cooked in butter and sugar at the New Year&#x27;s celebrations in the Tibetan capital Lhasa.

==In culture==
The pre-Linnaean name &quot;anserina&quot; means &quot;of the goose&quot; (&quot;Anser&quot;), either because the plant was used to feed them or because the leaves resembled the bird&#x27;s footprints. In Sweden, the flower is called gåsört (goose-wort).

A rich folklore has developed around Silverweed. The plant bears the common name of &quot;richette&quot; in French, being rich through both silver and gold.

There is a legend that the Christ Child grew up and walked the roads of Palestine, and the yellow flowering plant of the dusty wayside with silvery fern-like leaves that lay flat on the ground has been called the Footsteps of Our Lord.

==Fossil record==
Argentina anserina achenes are rather rare in Pliocene fossil floras of the East Europe but common in the Pleistocene.

<text>Stephen Joseph Malkmus ( ; born May 30, 1966) is an American musician best known as the primary songwriter, lead singer and guitarist of the indie rock band Pavement. He currently performs with Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, Pavement, The Hard Quartet, and as a solo artist.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Stephen Malkmus was born in Santa Monica, California, to Mary and Stephen Malkmus Sr. His father was a property and casualty insurance agent. When Stephen Jr. was 8, the family moved north to Stockton, where he attended Carpinteria&#x27;s Cate School and Lodi&#x27;s Tokay High School. As a teenager, Malkmus worked various jobs, including painting house numbers on street curbs and &quot;flipping burgers or whatever&quot; at a country club. At age 16, he spent the night in jail after consuming alcohol, urinating in the bushes, and walking on the roofs of several residential homes. Later, he was placed on probation for underage drinking, and was also expelled from school &quot;for going to a party in the woods where people were taking mushrooms. I didn&#x27;t take them, but some guy narc&#x27;d on me.&quot;

Malkmus learned the guitar by playing along to Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. Around the age of 16, he started playing in several Stockton-based punk bands: Bag O Bones, The Straw Dogs, and Crisis Alert. After graduating from high school, Malkmus followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by attending the University of Virginia, where he majored in history and was a disc jockey for the college radio station WTJU. During this time, Malkmus met fellow WTJU DJs David Berman (who would later front the Silver Jews) and James McNew (of Yo La Tengo) and formed the lo-fi band Ectoslavia. In the late 1980s, he was employed as a security guard at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, along with Berman and Bob Nastanovich.

===Career===
====Pavement====

Malkmus formed Pavement with Scott Kannberg (aka Spiral Stairs) right after finishing college at UVA in the late 80s. Their first album, &quot;Slanted &amp; Enchanted,&quot; was released to critical acclaim, and the band continued to receive attention for subsequent releases. Pavement, and Malkmus in particular, were hailed as spearheading the underground indie movement of the 1990s.

Pavement reunited in 2010 and embarked on a world tour, and reunited again in 2022 and 2023 for another tour.

====Solo work and The Jicks====
In 2001, following the 1999 dissolution of Pavement, Malkmus released his first self-titled album with his new band, The Jicks (although they were uncredited).

Malkmus&#x27;s fourth studio album with The Jicks, &quot;Real Emotional Trash&quot;, was released in March 2008.

In August 2011, he released his fifth studio album with The Jicks, &quot;Mirror Traffic&quot;. He played the album &quot;Ege Bamyasi&quot;, originally by the band Can, in its entirety on December 1, 2012, at WEEK-END Festival in Cologne, Germany. A recording of this performance was released as a limited-edition live album on Record Store Day 2013.

Malkmus&#x27;s sixth studio album with the Jicks, &quot;Wig Out at Jagbags&quot;, was released on January 7, 2014. On February 7, 2018, Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks released &quot;Middle America&quot;, their first material in four years. It was their first single from their seventh studio album, &quot;Sparkle Hard&quot;, which was released on May 18, 2018.

Malkmus released an electronic album titled &quot;Groove Denied&quot; on March 15, 2019, after having worked on the album for 12 to 13 years. After he submitted the album in 2017, Chris Lombardi of Matador Records, which had released all of Malkmus&#x27; records thus far, told Malkmus that it was not the right time to release the album. The album features Malkmus on all instruments and production and engineering. Malkmus released &quot;Traditional Techniques&quot; on March 6, 2020. The album was produced by Chris Funk of The Decemberists and features guitarist Matt Sweeney and musician Qais Essar.

====Side projects====
Malkmus was a member of rock group Silver Jews along with David Berman. In early 1999, Malkmus participated in a Sonic Youth side project called Kim&#x27;s Bedroom that included bassist/vocalist Kim Gordon, guitarist and vocalist Thurston Moore, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, and drummer Ikue Mori; they never released an album, but did play a few live shows. By 2001, Malkmus was performing as frontman of The Jicks.

In 2007, Malkmus provided 3 songs to the Todd Haynes&#x27; film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;, based on the life of Bob Dylan. He contributed on the songs &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Leave Her Behind&quot;, and &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot;. Malkmus has admitted that he was never &quot;a really big fan of Dylan,&quot; but noted that his involvement with the film had made him listen &quot;to him again a little closer.&quot;

In 2016, Malkmus scored the soundtrack to the Netflix series &quot;Flaked&quot;, which stars Will Arnett.

In 2024, Malkmus started the band The Hard Quartet with Emmett Kelly, Matt Sweeney, and Jim White.

==Personal life==
Malkmus moved to Portland, Oregon, where he met his wife, artist Jessica Jackson Hutchins. The couple have two children: daughters Lottie (born 2004) and Sunday (born 2007). In 2011, before the release of &quot;Mirror Traffic&quot;, Malkmus and his family moved to Berlin. By the release of &quot;Wig Out at Jagbags&quot; in 2014, however, the family had moved back to Portland.

Malkmus is a sports fan, supports Hull City Football Club and is known to play tennis and golf. He also played second base for the Portland-based Disjecta softball team. Malkmus also previously played lacrosse in his high school.

==Equipment==

Malkmus currently plays a Fender Stratocaster and a Guild S-100.

<text>The mayor of Cleveland is the head of the executive branch of government of the City of Cleveland, Ohio. As the chief executive in Cleveland&#x27;s mayor–council (strong mayor) system, the mayor oversees all city services and is &quot;responsible for enforcing the city charter, city ordinances, and the laws of the State of Ohio.&quot; The mayor&#x27;s office is located at Cleveland City Hall at 601 Lakeside Avenue in Downtown Cleveland. Since 1836, the city has had a total of 54 mayors, including the city&#x27;s current mayor, Justin Bibb, encompassing 58 mayoral administrations, as four mayors have served in non-consecutive terms.

==History==
Cleveland was established by General Moses Cleaveland and surveyors of the Connecticut Land Company on July 22, 1796. The settlement (then known as &quot;Cleaveland&quot;, after its founder) was incorporated as a village on December 23, 1814. At this time, the position of municipal executive was the village president. Alfred Kelley was the first to be elected to that post in June 1815. When Cleveland became a city in 1836, it adopted a mayor–council form of government. John W. Willey was the city&#x27;s first mayor.

Initially, Cleveland City Council had greater power in Cleveland&#x27;s city government, but this changed with the adoption of the 1892 Federal Plan, which significantly strengthened the office of the mayor. When the plan was ruled unconstitutional in 1902 by the Supreme Court of Ohio, the powers of the mayor were lessened in the city&#x27;s new municipal code. However, after the state granted Cleveland municipal home rule in 1912, the role of the mayor was enhanced in the 1913 municipal charter. When the city adopted a council–manager government in 1924, the city manager, selected by council, assumed the role of the municipal executive. However, the council–manager experiment was brief and, in November 1931, voters approved returning to the mayor–council system.

For much of Cleveland&#x27;s history, mayoral elections were partisan, but in 1971, under the mayoral administration of Ralph Perk, the city amended its charter to make elections nonpartisan. The term of office for the mayor and members of council was traditionally two years, but was extended to four years in 1981 under Mayor George Voinovich. According to the Cleveland City Charter, there are currently no term limits for the mayor.

Prior to its annexation on June 5, 1854, Ohio City was a separate municipality and a fierce rival of Cleveland. It had twelve mayoral administrations from 1836 to 1854.

<doc id="800281" wikidata="Q1316072" url="?curid=800281" title="41st parallel north">
<text>The 41st parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 41 degrees north of the Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane. It crosses Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean.

At this latitude the sun is visible for 15 hours, 8 minutes during the summer solstice and 9 hours, 13 minutes during the winter solstice.

==Around the world==
Starting at the prime meridian and heading eastwards, the parallel 41° north passes through:

==United States==

In the United States, the parallel defines the southernmost border of Wyoming (bordering Utah and Colorado), and part of the border between Nebraska and Colorado.

In 1606, King James I of England created the Colony of Virginia. In the First Virginia Charter, he gave the London Company the right to &quot;begin their Plantation and Habitation in some fit and convenient place between four and thirty and one and forty degrees of the said latitude all alongst the coast of Virginia and coasts of America.&quot; The Jamestown Settlement was established roughly at the midpoint of that territory. The later Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony) settlers were originally bound for the northern portion of the Virginia territory. Instead, they landed north of the 41st parallel on Cape Cod, where they had exclusive rights to the land under the charter for the Plymouth Colony.

As originally set by King Charles II of England in 1664, the point at which the 41st parallel crosses the Hudson River marks the northeastern border between New Jersey and New York. This border then proceeds northwest to the Tri-States Monument at the confluence of the Delaware and Neversink rivers.

The 41st parallel was also one of the principal baselines used for surveying a portion of lands in Ohio. This marked the southern boundary of the Connecticut Western Reserve and the Firelands using the western boundary with Pennsylvania as the principal meridian. It also served as the baseline for a later survey of Ohio land north of the Greenville Treaty line up to the Fulton line which was the original boundary between Michigan and Ohio under the Northwest Ordinance (see the Toledo Strip). The later survey used the boundary with Indiana as the meridian.

The Union Pacific Railroad built along the 41st parallel for much of its length when building the first transcontinental railroad.

<doc id="800301" wikidata="Q3815051" url="?curid=800301" title="Forensic meteorology">
<text>Forensic meteorology is meteorology, the scientific study of weather, applied to the process of reconstructing weather events for a certain time and location. This is done by acquiring and analyzing local weather reports such as surface observations, radar and satellite images, other data, and eyewitness accounts. Forensic meteorology is most often used in court cases, including insurance disputes, personal injury cases, and murder investigations. This is most often the case when weather conditions were a possible factor, as in falldowns after snow and ice, wind, flooding, after aviation and nautical accidents, etc. With increasing losses from severe weather in recent years, the demand for forensic meteorological services has also grown. In the US, many forensic meteorologists are certified by the American Meteorological Society (AMS)&#x27;s rigorous Certified Consulting Meteorologist (CCM) program.

==Origin of the term==
Conrad B. Gosset, MS (Meteor), a consulting meteorologist who worked to settle legal claims before trial and who often testified in courtrooms as an expert witness, felt that meteorologists who were providing these services should have a professional name. He introduced the phrase “Forensic Meteorologist” in the mid-1960s, as he discussed in his unpublished keynote speech at the first Conference on Forensic Meteorology, November 5–6, 1976. The conference was held in New Orleans in conjunction with the annual conference of the American Meteorological Society. The first use of the term by &quot;The New York Times&quot; was in reference to Mr. Gosset&#x27;s work in a 1982 article.

<doc id="800308" wikidata="Q7162784" url="?curid=800308" title="Penguin Modern Poets">
<text>Penguin Modern Poets was a series of 27 poetry books published by Penguin Books in the 1960s and 1970s, each containing work by three contemporary poets (mostly but not exclusively British and American). The series was begun in 1962 and published an average of two volumes per year throughout the 1960s. Each volume was stated to be &quot;an attempt to introduce contemporary poetry to the general reader&quot;. The series added up to a substantial survey of English-language poetry of the time.

&quot;Penguin Modern Poets&quot; was the first venture on the part of Penguin Books to offer contemporary poetry. Although at the time, most poetry was published in expensive hardbound editions, &quot;Penguin Modern Poets&quot; offered the public samplers of modern verse in inexpensive paperbacks. No. 27, the last of the original series, appeared in 1979.

The outstanding success of the series was No. 10, which, unlike the others, had its own title (&quot;The Mersey Sound&quot;) and which, with sales of over 500,000, has become one of the best-selling poetry anthologies ever.

A second &quot;Penguin Modern Poets&quot; series, of at least thirteen volumes on the same pattern, was launched in the 1990s. A third &quot;Penguin Modern Poets&quot; series was launched in 2016.

<text>The 42nd parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 42 degrees north of the Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane. It crosses Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean.

At this latitude the sun is visible for 15 hours, 15 minutes during the summer solstice and 9 hours, 6 minutes during the winter solstice.

The earth&#x27;s rotational speed at this latitude is roughly equal to the speed of sound.

One minute of longitude along the 42nd parallel is approximately .

==Around the world==

Starting at the Prime Meridian and heading eastwards, the parallel 42° north passes through:

==United States==

The parallel 42° north forms most of the New York–Pennsylvania border, although due to imperfect surveying in 1785–1786, this boundary wanders around on both sides of the true parallel. The area around the parallel in this region is known as the Twin Tiers.

The 42nd parallel became agreed upon as the northward limit of the Spanish Empire by the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819 with the United States, which established the parallel as the border between the Viceroyalty of New Spain of the Kingdom of Spain and the western territory of the United States of America from the meridian of the headwaters of the Arkansas River west to the Pacific Ocean. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848 then ceded much of what was then northern Mexico to the United States; as a result, the northernmost U.S. states which were created from Mexican territory (California, Nevada, and Utah) have the parallel 42° north as their northern border, and the adjoining U.S. states of Oregon and Idaho have the parallel as their southern border.

The parallel passes through the states of Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and passes through (or near - within three-tenths degree of latitude) the following cities in the United States:

*Crescent City, California 
*Yreka, California
*Hartford, Connecticut 
*Ames, Iowa
*Chicago, Illinois 
*Kalamazoo, Michigan
*Coldwater, Michigan 
*Erie, Pennsylvania
*Jamestown, New York
*Busti, New York
*Binghamton, New York
*Plymouth, Massachusetts
*Springfield, Massachusetts
*Worcester, Massachusetts
*Foxborough, Massachusetts
*Ashland, Oregon
*Medford, Oregon
*Providence, Rhode Island
*Brookings, Oregon

==Canada==

The parallel 42° north passes through the southern end of Lake Michigan and Lake Erie. Part of the water boundary between Canada and the United States passes south of the 42nd parallel. The southern tip of the Canadian province of Ontario just barely goes south of it at Point Pelee and Pelee Island, while the southernmost portion of the Town of Essex at Colchester is located below the 42nd parallel.

<text>Glebe is an inner-western suburb of Sydney in New South Wales. Glebe is located southwest of the Sydney central business district in the Inner West region.

Glebe is surrounded by Blackwattle Bay and Rozelle Bay, inlets of Sydney Harbour, in the north. The suburb of Ultimo lies to the east and the suburbs of Annandale and Forest Lodge lie to the west. The southern boundary is formed by Parramatta Road and Broadway. Broadway is a locality sited along the road of the same name, which is located on the border of Glebe, Chippendale and Ultimo.

==History==

Glebe&#x27;s name is derived from the fact that the land on which it was developed was a glebe, originally owned by the Anglican Church. &#x27;The Glebe&#x27; was a land grant of given by Governor Arthur Phillip to Reverend Richard Johnson, Chaplain of the First Fleet, in 1790.

In the 19th century, Glebe was home to the architect Edmund Blacket, who had migrated from England. Blacket built his family home, Bidura, on Glebe Point Road in 1858, designing it along conventional Victorian Regency lines. He also designed St John&#x27;s Church, on the corner of Glebe Point Road and St Johns Road. The church was built from 1868 to 1870. The suburb of Glebe was home to a first grade football team in the New South Wales Rugby League. The Glebe Dirty Reds were formed in 1908 and played in the first seasons of rugby league in Australia, with home games at Wentworth Park. The foundation club did not win a premiership and was excluded from the competition in 1930.

In the 1970s, feminist activists took over an abandoned terrace house in Westmoreland Street and set up Australia&#x27;s first women&#x27;s shelter, the Elsie Refuge. This was one of many properties left empty in the area due to government plans to build the North-East Expressway. The demolition of parkland and houses in Glebe was averted after the NSW Builders Labourers Federation placed bans on such work.

===Original vegetation===
The original vegetation was the Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest. A veteran Ironbark still grows at the grounds of St John&#x27;s Anglican Church, at Glebe Point Road.

==Landmarks==


* Glebe Town Hall, a heritage-listed civic building, which was used as the seat of the Glebe Municipal Council from its opening 1880 to 1948. Since merging with the City of Sydney council in that year, the building has been used extensively as a community hall for local concerts, rehearsals, balls, parties, conferences, and society meetings. 
*Rozelle Tram Depot, constructed in stages from 1904, is the largest remaining tram depot in Sydney, and is one of five remaining tram depots in the state of New South Wales. Operations ceased on 22 November 1958. The depot at present contains six historic trams, some of which date back to the 1930s, as well as an old coach that has been heavily vandalised. The trams that were in near mint condition prior to 2000 have now been vandalised, stripped and painted with graffiti. The depot served the inner western suburbs tram routes to Leichhardt, Balmain, Birchgrove, Abbotsford, and Lilyfield. During its peak of operations the depot was a major place of employment, employing up to 650 staff and was one of few workplaces of significant size in the Glebe area during its period. The depot ceased operations on 22 November 1958.
* Sze Yup Temple (Chinese: 四邑廟) is located in Edward Street and was originally built in 1898 by Chinese immigrants from Sze Yup, Guangdong, China. It provided a focal point for the early Chinese market gardeners in the area and is still in use today. The present building, which replaced one destroyed by fire, dates from 1955. Arsonists caused another fire in January 2008, damaging the roof and all its contents. Racism and anti-Chinese sentiments just prior to Chinese New Year in February were suspected as motives, but police refused to confirm or deny this. While refusing to agree to community suspicions that the fire was racially motivated, in January 2009 the local council allowed reconstruction work as a sign of goodwill. The temple is heritage-listed.
* Bellevue, located in Blackwattle Park, was built in 1896 by Ambrose Thornley for prominent Glebe resident William Jarrett. It was later restored and turned into a café. Bellevue is heritage-listed.
* Bidura, situated on Glebe Point Road, was built by architect Edmund Blacket for his family. Built in 1857, the house may have been influenced by the design of the nearby Toxteth Park. It is heritage-listed.
* St Scholastica&#x27;s (Toxteth Park), Glebe, Sydney George Allen, who established a legal firm and became Lord Mayor of Sydney in 1844, constructed the building as his home and called it Toxteth Park. St Scholastica&#x27;s College moved to this site from Pitt Street in central Sydney in 1901. The building is heritage-listed.
* Lyndhurst This mansion was built between 1834 and 1837 for Dr James Bowman, who was the principal surgeon of the nearby Sydney Hospital. It was designed by the noted architect John Verge, in the Regency style. The building was resumed in 1972 with the intention of demolishing it as part of a proposed freeway project. However, it was saved as a result of public protest and the placing of a green ban, then handed over to the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales in 1983. In 2004 it was sold and then returned to use as a private home. Lyndhurst is heritage-listed.
* Johnstons Creek rises in Stanmore and flows in a generally northward direction towards Rozelle Bay. The creek passes beneath the stands of the former Harold Park Paceway prior to emptying into Rozelle Bay at Bicentennial Park, Glebe.
*Glebe Jubilee fountain erected in 1909 on the corner of Glebe Point Road and Broadway commemorates the Jubilee of Glebe as a municipality.
*St John&#x27;s Glebe, also known as St John&#x27;s Bishopthorpe. Opened in 1870 it was designed by John Hunt and Glebe resident Edmund Blacket. The tower was added in 1909 by Blacket&#x27;s son Cyril.
*St John&#x27;s Parish Hall Glebe. Built in 1870 and designed by Edward Halloran. There is a horse trough near Glebe Point Road.

<text>The Ministry of Finance is a cabinet-level ministry of the government of Pakistan that is in charge of government finance, fiscal policy, and financial regulation. A Finance Minister, an executive or cabinet position heads it.
The Minister is responsible each year for presenting the federal government&#x27;s budget to the Parliament of Pakistan.

==History of the Ministry of Finance==

Established as the first administrative ministry of Pakistan&#x27;s executive branch in 1947, the Ministry of Finance is considered among the most powerful portfolio and prestigious executive assignments in Pakistan&#x27;s political spectrum. Ghulam Muhammad, the first finance minister of Pakistan, had neither a watermark nor a security thread. 
In the line of session to the prime minister, the Finance Minister is second-in-line, and many have ascended as Prime Minister after serving first as Finance Minister.

==Divisions==
===Finance===
The &quot;Finance Division&quot; comes under the supervision of the Secretary of Finance. The division&#x27;s bureaucracy is divided into several wings and units, which include

* Human Resource Management Wing: Basic functions include the official business management of the organization through the provision of effective human resources. The wing also provides logistic support to various other units of the organization.
* Budget Wing: Basic functions include the coordination, preparation, printing, and publishing of fiscal budgets and related documents for the federal government. The wing is also responsible for the implementation of the budgetary targets and preparing monthly reports thereon.
* Corporate Finance Wing: Basic functions include looking after the finance, financial, and corporate affairs of all Public Sector Entities (PSEs) that work under the administrative control of various federal ministries and their divisions.
* Economic Adviser&#x27;s Wing: Basic functions include the publication of the &quot;Economic Survey of Pakistan&quot;, both in Urdu and English, before the announcement of the federal budget. The budgetary supplement evaluates the overall economic performance of the country based on various economic factors as evident in the preceding fiscal year&#x27;s data.
* Expenditure Wing: Basic functions include the revision and finalization of the federal budget, enforcement of economic measures, and disbursements of pension funds.
* External Finance Wing: Basic functions include the arrangement of economics from international financial institutions for balance of payments and budgetary support. The EF wing also allocates and utilizes foreign exchange and releases and maintains the funds for both civil departments and the armed forces.
* External Finance Policy Wing: Basic functions include the compilation of the Pakistan government&#x27;s principal policy for macroeconomic governance and poverty reduction. The EFP wing also deals with multilateral and bilateral institutions like the World Bank, Department for International Development (DFID), Citizens Damage Compensation Programme (CDCP), SAARC Development Fund (SDF), ECO Trade and Development Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Strengthening Poverty Reduction Strategy Monitoring Project (SPRSMP), Pakistan One UN Programme and the Joint Ministerial Commissions (JMCs/JECs).
* Economic Reforms Unit: Basic functions include the formulation of development strategies for the private sector and reviewing law, rules and regulations, pertaining to business environment that are obsolete, overlapping and inconsistent or unduly add to the cost of doing business.
* Military Wing: Basic functions include procurement of all defence equipment for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Ministry of Defence Production (MoDP). The wing also prepares, executes and monitors the budget and expenditure of the armed forces, MoD, MoDP, inter-services organisations and defence production establishments.
* Development Wing
* Internal Finance Wing
* Investment Wing
* Provincial Finance Wing
* Regulations Wing

<text>Mosasaurs (from Latin &quot;Mosa&quot; meaning the &#x27;Meuse&#x27;, and Greek &#x27; meaning &#x27;lizard&#x27;) are an extinct group of large aquatic reptiles within the familyMosasauridae that lived during the Late Cretaceous. Their first fossil remains were discovered in a limestone quarry at Maastricht on the Meuse in 1764. They belong to the order Squamata, which includes lizards and snakes.

During the last 20 million years of the Cretaceous period (Turonian–Maastrichtian ages), with the extinction of the ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs, mosasaurids became the dominant marine predators. They themselves became extinct as a result of the K-Pg event at the end of the Cretaceous period, about 66 million years ago.

==Description==

Mosasaurs breathed air, were powerful swimmers, and were well-adapted to living in the warm, shallow inland seas prevalent during the Late Cretaceous period. Mosasaurs were so well adapted to this environment that they most likely gave birth to live young, rather than returning to the shore to lay eggs as sea turtles do.

The smallest-known mosasaur was &quot;Dallasaurus turneri&quot;, which was less than long. Larger mosasaurs were more typical, with many species growing longer than . &quot;Mosasaurus hoffmannii&quot;, the largest known species reached up to , but it has been considered to be probably overestimated by Cleary &quot;et al.&quot; (2018). Currently, the largest publicly exhibited mosasaur skeleton in the world is on display at the Canadian Fossil Discovery Centre in Morden, Manitoba. The specimen, nicknamed &quot;Bruce&quot;, is just over long, but this might be an overestimate as the skeleton was assembled for display prior to a 2010 reassessment of the species that found its original number of vertebrae to be exaggerated, implying that the actual size of the animal was likely smaller.

Mosasaurs had a body shape similar to that of modern-day monitor lizards (varanids), but were more elongated and streamlined for swimming. Their limb bones were reduced in length and their paddles were formed by webbing between their long finger and toe bones. Their tails were broad, and supplied their locomotive power.

Until recently, mosasaurs were assumed to have swum in a method similar to the one used today by conger eels and sea snakes, undulating their entire bodies from side to side. However, new evidence suggests that many advanced mosasaurs had large, crescent-shaped flukes on the ends of their tails, similar to those of sharks and some ichthyosaurs. Rather than use snake-like undulations, their bodies probably remained stiff to reduce drag through the water, while their tails provided strong propulsion. These animals may have lurked and pounced rapidly and powerfully on passing prey, rather than chasing after it. At least some species were also capable of aquaflight, flapping their flippers like sea lions.

Early reconstructions showed mosasaurs with dorsal crests running the length of their bodies, which were based on misidentified remains of tracheal cartilage. By the time this error was discovered, depicting mosasaurs with such crests in artwork had already become a trend.

==Paleobiology==
Mosasaurs had double-hinged jaws and flexible skulls (much like those of snakes), which enabled them to gulp down their prey almost whole. A skeleton of &quot;Tylosaurus proriger&quot; from South Dakota included remains of the diving seabird &quot;Hesperornis&quot;, a marine bony fish, a possible shark, and another, smaller mosasaur (&quot;Clidastes&quot;). Mosasaur bones have also been found with shark teeth embedded in them.

One of the food items of mosasaurs were ammonites, molluscs with shells similar to those of &quot;Nautilus&quot;, which were abundant in the Cretaceous seas. Holes have been found in fossil shells of some ammonites, mainly &quot;Pachydiscus&quot; and &quot;Placenticeras&quot;. These were once interpreted as a result of limpets attaching themselves to the ammonites, but the triangular shape of the holes, their size, and their presence on both sides of the shells, corresponding to upper and lower jaws, is evidence of the bite of medium-sized mosasaurs. Whether this behaviour was common across all size classes of mosasaurs is not clear.

Virtually all forms were active predators of fish and ammonites; a few, such as &quot;Globidens&quot;, had blunt, spherical teeth, specialized for crushing mollusk shells. The smaller genera, such as &quot;Platecarpus&quot; and &quot;Dallasaurus&quot;, which were about long, probably fed on fish and other small prey. The smaller mosasaurs may have spent some time in fresh water, hunting for food. The largest mosasaur &quot;Mosasaurus hoffmannii&quot; was the apex predator of the Late Cretaceous oceans, reaching more than in length and weighing up to in body mass.

===Soft tissue===

Despite the many mosasaur remains collected worldwide, knowledge of the nature of their skin coverings remains in its early stages. Few mosasaurid specimens collected from around the world retain fossilized scale imprints. This lack may be due to the delicate nature of the scales, which nearly eliminates the possibility of preservation, in addition to the preservation sediment types and the marine conditions under which the preservation occurred. Until the discovery of several mosasaur specimens with remarkably well-preserved scale imprints from late Maastrichtian deposits of the Muwaqqar Chalk Marl Formation of Harrana in Jordan, knowledge of the nature of mosasaur integument was mainly based on very few accounts describing early mosasaur fossils dating back to the upper Santonian–lower Campanian, such as the famous &quot;Tylosaurus&quot; specimen (KUVP-1075) from Gove County, Kansas.

Material from Jordan has shown that the bodies of mosasaurs, as well as the membranes between their fingers and toes, were covered with small, overlapping, diamond-shaped scales resembling those of snakes. Much like those of modern reptiles, mosasaur scales varied across the body in type and size. In Harrana specimens, two types of scales were observed on a single specimen: keeled scales covering the upper regions of the body and smooth scales covering the lower. As ambush predators, lurking and quickly capturing prey using stealth tactics, they may have benefited from the nonreflective, keeled scales. Additionally, mosasaurs had large pectoral girdles, and such genera as &quot;Plotosaurus&quot; may have used their front flippers in a breaststroke motion to gain added bursts of speed during an attack on prey. 

More recently, a fossil of &quot;Platecarpus tympaniticus&quot; has been found that preserved not only skin impressions, but also internal organs. Several reddish areas in the fossil may represent the heart, lungs, and kidneys. The trachea is also preserved, along with part of what may be the retina in the eye. The placement of the kidneys is farther forward in the abdomen than it is in monitor lizards, and is more similar to those of cetaceans. As in cetaceans, the bronchi leading to the lungs run parallel to each other instead of splitting apart from one another as in monitors and other terrestrial reptiles. In mosasaurs, these features may be internal adaptations to fully marine lifestyles.
In 2011, collagen protein was recovered from a &quot;Prognathodon&quot; humerus dated to the Cretaceous.

In 2005, a case study by A.S. Schulp, E.W.A Mulder, and K. Schwenk outlined the fact that mosasaurs had paired fenestrae in their palates. In monitor lizards and snakes, paired fenestrae are associated with a forked tongue, which is flicked in and out to detect chemical traces and provide a directional sense of smell. They therefore proposed that mosasaurs probably also had a sensitive forked tongue.

===Metabolism===
A study published in 2016 by T. Lyn Harrell, Alberto Pérez-Huerta and Celina Suarez showed that mosasaurs were endothermic. The study contradicted findings published in 2010 indicating mosasaurs were ectothermic. The 2010 study did not use warm-blooded animals for comparison but analogous groups of common marine animals. Based on comparisons with modern warm-blooded animals and fossils of known cold-blooded animals from the same time period, the 2016 study found mosasaurs likely had body temperatures similar to those of contemporary seabirds and were able to internally regulate their temperatures to remain warmer than the surrounding water.

===Coloration===
The coloration of mosasaurs was unknown until 2014, when the findings of Johan Lindgren of Lund University and colleagues revealed the pigment melanin in the fossilized scales of a mosasaur. Mosasaurs were likely countershaded, with dark backs and light underbellies, much like a great white shark or leatherback sea turtle, the latter of which had fossilized ancestors for which color was also determined. The findings were described in &quot;Nature&quot;.

===Teeth===
Mosasaurs possessed a thecodont dentiton, meaning that the roots were cemented deeply into the jaw bone. Mosasaurs did not use permanent teeth but instead constantly shed them. Replacement teeth developed within a pit inside the roots of the original tooth called the resorption pit. This is done through a distinctively unique eight-stage process. The first stage was characterized by the mineralization of a small tooth crown developed elsewhere that descended into the resorption pit by the second stage. In the third stage, the developing crown firmly cemented itself within the resorption pit and grew in size; by the fourth stage, it would be of the same size as the crown in the original tooth. Stages five and six were characterized by the development of the replacement tooth&#x27;s root: in stage five the root developed vertically, and in stage six the root expanded in all directions to the point that the replacement tooth became exposed and actively pushed on the original tooth. In the seventh stage, the original tooth was shed and the now-independent replacement tooth began to anchor itself into the vacancy. In the eighth and final stage, the replacement tooth has grown to firmly anchor itself.

===Ontogeny and growth===
Mosasaur growth is not well understood, as specimens of juveniles are rare, and many were mistaken for hesperornithine birds when discovered 100 years ago. However, the discovery of several specimens of juvenile and neonate-sized mosasaurs unearthed more than a century ago indicate that mosasaurs gave birth to live young, and that they spent their early years of life out in the open ocean, not in sheltered nurseries or areas such as shallow water as previously believed. Whether mosasaurs provided parental care, like other marine reptiles such as plesiosaurs, is currently unknown. The discovery of young mosasaurs was published in the journal &quot;Palaeontology&quot;.

=== Possible eggs ===
A 2020 study published in &quot;Nature&quot; described a large fossilized hatched egg from Antarctica from the very end of the Cretaceous, about 68 million years ago. The egg is considered one of the largest amniote eggs ever known, rivalling that of the elephant bird, and due to its soft, thin, folded texture, it likely belonged to a marine animal. While the organism that produced it remains unknown, the egg&#x27;s pore structure is very similar to that of extant lepidosaurs such as lizards and snakes, and presence of mosasaur fossils nearby indicates that it may have been a mosasaur egg. It is unknown whether the egg was laid on land or in the water. The egg was assigned to the newly described oospecies &quot;Antarcticoolithus bradyi&quot;. However, it has been proposed that this egg belonged to a dinosaur.

==Environment==
Paleontologists compared the taxonomic diversity and patterns of morphological disparity in mosasaurs with sea level, sea surface temperature, and stable carbon isotope curves for the Upper Cretaceous to explore factors that may have influenced their evolution. No single factor unambiguously accounts for all radiations, diversification, and extinctions; however, the broader patterns of taxonomic diversification and morphological disparity point to niche differentiation in a &quot;fishing up&quot; scenario under the influence of &quot;bottom-up&quot; selective pressures. The most likely driving force in mosasaur evolution was high productivity in the Late Cretaceous, driven by tectonically controlled sea levels and climatically controlled ocean stratification and nutrient delivery. When productivity collapsed at the end of the Cretaceous, coincident with bolide impact, mosasaurs became extinct.
Sea levels were high during the Cretaceous period, causing marine transgressions in many parts of the world, and a great inland seaway in what is now North America. Mosasaur fossils have been found in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden, South Africa, Spain, France, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Italy Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Japan, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Niger, Angola, Morocco, Australia, New Zealand, and on Vega Island off the coast of Antarctica. Tooth taxon &quot;Globidens timorensis&quot; is known from the island of Timor; however, the phylogenetic placement of this species is uncertain and it might not even be a mosasaur.

Mosasaurs have been found in Canada in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and in much of the contiguous United States. Complete or partial specimens have been found in Alabama, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Georgia, as well as in states covered by the Cretaceous seaway: Texas, southwest Arkansas, New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and the Pierre Shale/Fox Hills formations of North Dakota. Lastly, mosasaur bones and teeth are also known from Colombia, Brazil, and Chile.

Many of the so-called &#x27;dinosaur&#x27; remains found on New Zealand are actually mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, both being Mesozoic predatory marine reptiles.

The largest mosasaur currently on public display is Bruce, a 65-70%-complete specimen of &quot;Tylosaurus pembinensis&quot; dating from the late Cretaceous Period, approximately 80 million years ago, and measuring 13.05 m (42.815 ft) from nose tip to tail tip. Bruce was discovered in 1974 north of Thornhill, Manitoba, Canada, and resides at the nearby Canadian Fossil Discovery Centre in Morden, Manitoba. Bruce was awarded the Guinness Record for the largest mosasaur on public display in 2014.

==Discovery==
The first publicized discovery of a partial fossil mosasaur skull in 1764 by quarry workers in a subterranean gallery of a limestone quarry in Mount Saint Peter, near the Dutch city of Maastricht, preceded any major dinosaur fossil discoveries, but remained little known. However, a second find of a partial skull drew the Age of Enlightenment&#x27;s attention to the existence of fossilized animals that were different from any known living creatures. When the specimen was discovered between 1770 and 1774, Johann Leonard Hoffmann, a surgeon and fossil collector, corresponded about it with the most influential scientists of his day, making the fossil famous. The original owner, though, was Godding, a canon of Maastricht cathedral.

When the French revolutionary forces occupied Maastricht in 1794, the carefully hidden fossil was uncovered, after a reward, it is said, of 600 bottles of wine, and transported to Paris. After it had been earlier interpreted as a fish, a crocodile, and a sperm whale, the first to understand its lizard affinities was the Dutch scientist Adriaan Gilles Camper in 1799. In 1808, Georges Cuvier confirmed this conclusion, although &quot;le Grand Animal fossile de Maëstricht&quot; was not actually named &quot;Mosasaurus&quot; (&#x27;Meuse reptile&#x27;) until 1822 and not given its full species name, &quot;Mosasaurus hoffmannii,&quot; until 1829. Several sets of mosasaur remains, which had been discovered earlier at Maastricht but were not identified as mosasaurs until the 19th century, have been on display in the Teylers Museum, Haarlem, procured from 1790.

The Maastricht limestone beds were rendered so famous by the mosasaur discovery, they have given their name to the final six-million-year epoch of the Cretaceous, the Maastrichtian.

===Lower classifications===

The traditional view of mosasaur evolution held that all paddle-limbed (hydropedal) mosasaurs originated from a single common ancestor with functional legs (plesiopedal). However, this was shaken with the discovery of &quot;Dallasaurus&quot;, a plesiopedal mosasauroid more closely related to the Mosasaurinae than other mosasaurs. Bell and Polycn (2005) grouped these outside mosasaurs into two clades: the Russellosaurina, whose basal members include plesiopedal genera (Tethysaurinae) of their own and derived members consisting of the Plioplatecarpinae and Tylosaurinae; and the Halisauromorpha, containing the Halisaurinae. The placement of &quot;Dallasaurus&quot; suggested that the Russellosaurina and Halisauromorpha may have evolved a hydropedal form independently, the former through the tethysaurines, meaning that their placement within the Mosasauridae creates an unnatural polyphyly and thus potentially invalid. Caldwell informally proposed in a 2012 publication that the definition of a mosasaur must thus be redefined into one that does not consider russellosaurines and halisauromorphs as true mosasaurs, but as an independent group of marine lizards.

However, phylogenetic studies of mosasaurs can be fickle, especially when wild card taxa like &quot;Dallasaurus&quot; remain poorly understood. For example, some studies such as a 2009 analysis by Dutchak and Caldwell instead found that &quot;Dallasaurus&quot; was ancestral to both russellosaurines and mosasaurines, although results were inconsistent in later studies. A 2017 study by Simoes &quot;et al.&quot; noted that utilization of different methods of phylogenetic analyses can yield different findings and ultimately found an indication that tethysaurines were a case of hydropedal mosasaurs reversing back to a plesiopedal condition rather than an independent ancestral feature.

The following cladograms illustrate the two views of mosasaur evolution. Topology A follows an ancestral state reconstruction from an implied weighted maximum parsimony tree by Simoes et al. (2017), which contextualizes a single marine origin with tethysaurine reversal. Topologies B and C illustrate the multiple-origins hypothesis of hydropedality; the former follows Makádi et al. (2012), while the latter follows a PhD dissertation by Mekarski (2017) that experimentally includes dolichosaur and poorly-represented aigialosaur taxa. Placement of major group names follow definitions by Madzia and Cau (2017).

===Phylogeny===

The following diagram illustrates simplified phylogenies of the three major mosasaur groups as recovered by Strong et al. (2020), Longrich et al. (2021), and Longrich et al. (2022).


==Distribution==
Though no individual genus or subfamily is found worldwide, the Mosasauridae as a whole achieved global distribution during the Late Cretaceous with many locations typically having complex mosasaur faunas with multiple different genera and species in different ecological niches.

Two African countries are particularly rich in mosasaurs: Morocco and Angola.

It commemorates the birthplace location of George Washington, a Founding Father and the first President of the United States, who was born here on February 22, 1732. Washington lived at the residence until age three and later returned to live there as a teenager.

==History==


===17th–18th centuries===
John Washington, George Washington&#x27;s great-grandfather, settled this plantation in 1657 at the original property on Bridges Creek. The family acquired expanded land to the south toward nearby Popes Creek.

Prior to 1718, the first section of the house was built. His father enlarged it between 1722–1726. He added on to it by the mid-1770s, making a ten-room house known as &quot;Wakefield&quot;. This house, which George Washington in 1792 would describe as &quot;the ancient mansion seat,&quot; was destroyed by fire and flood on Christmas Day 1779, and never rebuilt.

George Washington was born in the house on February 22, 1732. Thirty-two graves of Washington family members have been found at the Bridges Creek cemetery plot, including George&#x27;s half-brother, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.

Washington&#x27;s father held slaves and had them cultivate tobacco on his several plantations, as his ancestors had done.

===19th century===
In 1858, the Commonwealth of Virginia acquired the property to preserve the homesite and cemetery. In 1882, however, Virginia donated the land to the federal government following the Civil War.

===20th century===
The Wakefield National Memorial Association was formed in 1923 to restore the property. In 1930, the grounds were authorized by Congress as a U.S. National Monument. In 1931, the Wakefield Association received a grant from John D. Rockefeller Jr., to acquire and transfer a total of of land to the Federal government.

Since the exact appearance of the original Washington family home is not known, a Memorial House was designed by Edward Donn Jr., representing similar buildings of the era; it was constructed on the approximate site in 1931. The actual location of Washington&#x27;s boyhood home is adjacent to the memorial house and its foundation is outlined in the ground by crushed oyster shells.

The Memorial House represents a typical tobacco plantation of the period of the original&#x27;s construction. The Memorial House is constructed of bricks handmade from local clay. It has a central hallway and four rooms on each floor, furnished in the 1730–1750 period style by the Wakefield National Memorial Association. Furnishings include an 18th-century tea table believed to have been in the original house. Most of the other furnishings are more than 200 years old. At the entrance to the grounds, now maintained and operated by the National Park Service, is a Memorial Shaft obelisk of Vermont marble; it is a one-tenth scale replica of the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C.

The park and Memorial House were opened by the National Park Service in 1932, on the 200th anniversary of George Washington&#x27;s birth.

=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century, the Monument is part of the National Park Service&#x27;s ongoing efforts to interpret historical resources. In addition to the Memorial House, park facilities open to visitors include the historic birthplace home area, Kitchen House, hiking trails, and picnic grounds. In the Kitchen House, costumed re-enactors demonstrate candle- and soap-making.

A colonial herb and flower garden has been planted with herbs and flowers common to Washington&#x27;s time, including thyme, sage, basil, and flowers such as hollyhocks, forget-me-nots, and roses. Typical trees and bushes of Washington&#x27;s time have also been added to the landscaping. The Colonial Living Farm has a barn and pasture and raises livestock, poultry, and crops that were typical in the 18th century and using farming methods that were common at the time.

Visitors may also tour the Washington family Burial Ground, which contains the graves of 32 members of the Washington family, including George Washington&#x27;s father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Replicas of two original gravestones are visible, along with five memorial tablets placed here in the 1930s.

The Visitors&#x27; Center contains artifacts recovered from the burned-down Washington house, including a bowl, clay figurine, wine bottle seal belonging to Augustine Washington, wine bottle, and keyhole plate.

A 15-minute film depicting Washington family life is shown in a theater at the Visitors&#x27; Center.

<text>Hamleys of London Limited, trading as Hamleys, is a British multinational toy retailer, owned by Reliance Retail. Listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s oldest toy store, it was founded by William Hamley as &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; in High Holborn, London, in 1760. It moved to its current site on Regent Street in London&#x27;s West End in 1881. This flagship store is set over seven floors, with more than 50,000 lines of toys on sale. It receives around five million visitors each year. 

The chain has 11 outlets in the United Kingdom and also has more than 90 franchises worldwide. Hamleys became famous in the early Victorian era, with royalty among its customers. The store was granted its first royal warrant from Queen Mary in 1938. It held a royal warrant from Elizabeth II from 1955 to 2022 (her death).

==History==
Hamleys is the oldest and in 1994 was the largest toy shop in the world. It is named after William Hamley, who founded a toy shop called &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; at No. 231 High Holborn, London, in 1760. Ownership of the shop passed through the family, and by the time it was operated by Hamley&#x27;s grandsons in 1837, the store had become famous, counting royalty and nobility among its customers.

A branch at 200 Regent Street in the West End of London was opened in 1881. The original High Holborn store was destroyed by fire in 1901 and subsequently relocated to 86–87 High Holborn.

Hamleys suffered a downturn through the 1920s and closed, entering receivership, in 1931. After ensuring that it would not alienate their suppliers, the Lines Bros toy company, Hamleys&#x27; largest creditor, purchased the company and reopened the Regent Street store by the end of that year, keeping it largely independent. The High Holborn branch, opened in 1901, would not reopen under the new ownership.

In 1938, Queen Mary, consort of King George V, gave Hamleys a royal warrant. During the Second World War, the Regent Street store was bombed five times. In 1955, Queen Elizabeth II gave the company a second royal warrant as a &quot;toys and sports merchant&quot;.
In 1981, Hamleys would move to 188–196 Regent Street. The following year, it was purchased by the department store chain Debenhams. Debenhams itself was the subject of a takeover in August 1985 by the Burton Group. Burton Group divested Hamleys in August 1986 to Harris Queensway, a retail group led by Philip Harris. At the time it was said that a strategic plan had been formulated to build on the strength of the brand to ensure the company lived up to its reputation. The Harris Queensway group, including Hamleys, was taken over in 1988 to become Lowdnes Queensway. Hamleys was sold by Lowndes Queensway in May 1989 to a group led by Duncan Chadwick for £22 million.

Hamleys was bought in June 2003 by the Baugur Group, an Icelandic investment company. When Baugur collapsed, its stake in the toy store was taken over by the Icelandic bank Landsbanki. In September 2012 Groupe Ludendo, a toy retailer based in France with shops also located in Belgium, Spain and Switzerland, bought Hamleys for a reported £60 million.

In October 2015 it was reported that Groupe Ludendo was negotiating the sale of Hamleys, possibly to a Hong Kong company owned by a relative of the owner of department store House of Fraser. It was subsequently purchased by C.Banner, a large Chinese footwear and fashion wear conglomerate based in Nanjing.

In May 2019, Indian retail company, Reliance Retail, part of the Reliance Industries, announced that it has acquired Hamleys for £67.96 million (around ₹620 crore) using international bank receipt.

==United Kingdom stores==

===Regent Street===

Hamleys expanded and moved its flagship store in London from No. 200 Regent Street to its current site at Nos. 188–196, Regent Street, in 1981, which in 1994 was the largest toy shop in the world.

Hamleys&#x27; flagship store has seven floors covering , all devoted to toys, with different categories of toy on each floor. The ground floor is traditionally for stuffed toys (including Steiff), and is decked out with a diverse array of stuffed animals, from regular teddy bears to more exotic plushes such as turtles and dolphins, and enormous life-sized giraffes and elephants.

Then on 15 June 1987, Hamleys opened a new store in Milsom Street, in the city of Bath, Somerset, and just like the other stores, it also closed within 12 months, on 10 June 1988.

In the 1990s Hamleys had two websites, one for the UK which did not sell anything, and a U.S. version with a basic inventory. This changed in 1999 with the launch of hamleys.com. The site offered worldwide shipping and focused on user experience, customer service and the sale of traditional products and collectables. The chief executive of Hamleys told &quot;Marketing&quot; magazine &quot;I do not want to become embroiled with the likes of Toys &#x27;R&#x27; Us, Toyzone and eToys, which are fighting on price alone and will end up making next to no margin&quot;.

In 2006, a glitch on the website allowed customers to claim a 60% discount on any product.

Econsultancy critiqued the site for its basic approach in 2013, and felt that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t do a lot to represent the brand; in fact, it may even detract from it&quot;.

<doc id="800391" wikidata="Q172780" url="?curid=800391" title="Marc Gené">
<text>Marc Gené i Guerrero (born 29 March 1974) is a Spanish professional racing driver. He is best known as a tester for Williams and Ferrari in Formula One, Minardi Formula One driver and factory driver for Peugeot&#x27;s Le Mans team, with which he won the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans. His brother Jordi is also a racing driver, competing in the WTCC for SEAT. He had 36 starts in Formula One, mostly through two seasons with the Minardi team, with which he scored a sixth-place finish at the attrition-filled 1999 European Grand Prix.

Starting from the 2010 season, Gené commented on Formula One races for Spanish television on Antena 3. In 2013 he became an expert analyst for Sky Sport F1 HD in Italy. He also remains with Ferrari as their brand ambassador.

==Early years==
Born in Sabadell, Gené finished runner-up in the 1987 Catalan Kart Championship (National Class) at the age of 13; he would win both this and the National Class Spanish Kart Championship in 1988. In 1989 he competed in both the European and World championships. Gené won the Senior Class of the 1990 Spanish Kart Championship, making him the youngest driver to do so. He competed again in the World Championship in 1991, placing 13th.

For 1992 Gené moved into Formula Ford, placing fifth in the Spanish championship with a and two pole positions. He was runner-up in the 1993 European Championship, with one win and three podiums; also, Gené took second place at the Formula Ford World Cup and Festival. In 1994, Gené was named Rookie of the Year in the British Formula 3 Championship; he placed 10th in 1995. In 1996 Gené won the FISA Superformula championship, and in 1997 he competed in six rounds of the FIA Formula 3000 series, though he failed to score a point. In 1998 he won the Open Fortuna by Nissan Championship with six wins and three poles.

==Formula One==
Gené got his big break in 1999, occupying a race seat with the Minardi team. It was a difficult year; however, after several ninth places and an eighth, he managed to score his first point, and Minardi&#x27;s first since 1995, with a sixth place at the European Grand Prix, while his team-mate Luca Badoer broke down in tears after his car&#x27;s gearbox failed and denied the Italian his first points finish in Formula One, as he was running in fourth place with 13 laps to go. Gené continued with Minardi in 2000, but failed to score a single point, with his best finish being eighth at the Australian and Austrian Grands Prix. His team-mate in 2000 was Argentina&#x27;s Gastón Mazzacane, who also achieved a best finish of eighth, at the European Grand Prix.

===Testing===
Unable to obtain a quality drive for 2001, Gené opted to sign with Williams as test driver. He drove three Grands Prix for the team as temporary substitute. The first of these was the 2003 Italian Grand Prix, where Ralf Schumacher was unable to race because of a concussion. Gené replaced his teammate well, collecting four points for a fifth-place finish, but Schumacher was back in the car for the next race in the USA. Following a back injury to Schumacher at the 2004 USGP, Gené drove in the French and British Grands Prix, but subsequently lost the race seat to Antônio Pizzonia and did not race again in F1.

In November 2004, Gené signed a deal to become a test driver for Scuderia Ferrari alongside former teammate Luca Badoer. His contract was renewed for . A limit on testing in Formula One in 2007 and 2008 had restricted his involvement.

At the end of 2010, Gené along with Badoer and Giancarlo Fisichella was replaced by Jules Bianchi as Ferrari test driver ahead of the 2011 season.

==Sportscar racing==

Gené has also been hired by Peugeot as a factory driver for their 908 HDi FAP Le Mans Series effort, as well as the 24 Hours of Le Mans since 2007. In 2008, Gené crashed his 908 heavily in practice for the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans, but escaped with a broken toe. A year later, however, there were no such problems, and the Peugeot he shared with David Brabham and Alex Wurz completed 382 laps on its way to victory in the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans. He completed the last stint for the team and brought the 908 home to a standing ovation from the avid French crowd, who saw one of their cars stop the recent domination of Audi in the prestigious event.

In both 2008 and 2009 he also took part in the 1000 km Spa endurance race, winning in 2008 and finishing 12th in 2009.

<doc id="800402" wikidata="Q7046262" url="?curid=800402" title="Red Deer Polytechnic">
<text>Red Deer Polytechnic (RDP), formerly Red Deer College, is a public polytechnic institute of approximately 10,000 students in credit, non-credit and apprenticeship programming located in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. In 2021, Red Deer College was converted into a provincially focused polytechnic institute called Red Deer Polytechnic, with the added ability to grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

== History ==
Established in 1964 as Red Deer College, (RDC), the institution was built for a smaller semi-rural community but, in the years since its founding, the city has grown into the third largest in the province.

Red Deer College&#x27;s arms, supporters and flag (all designed by Darren George) were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on February 20, 2004. The college is a member of the Alberta Rural Development Network.

In 2018, Red Deer College applied to begin transitioning to a university. The goal was to become a central hub of research and education for Central Alberta, offering education in the trades, the sciences, and the arts and fine arts. On March 5, 2019, the college announced a three-year transition process, and that it would adopt the name Red Deer University.

However on May 5, 2021, the Government of Alberta announced that Red Deer College would become a polytechnic institution instead of a university. The transition and name change was complete by June 2021.

==Programs==
Red Deer Polytechnic offers certificates, diplomas, advanced certificates, applied degrees, bachelor&#x27;s degrees, academic upgrading and apprenticeship in over 75 different career and academic programs, including the creative and liberal arts, engineering, and trades.

==Scholarships and bursaries==
The Government of Canada sponsors an Aboriginal Bursaries Search Tool that lists over 680 scholarships, bursaries, and other incentives offered by governments, universities, and industry to support Aboriginal post-secondary participation. RDP&#x27;s scholarships for Aboriginal, First Nations and Métis students include: Atoskewan Aboriginal Career Centre Scholarship

The polytechnic awards approximately $390,000(CAD) annually in scholarships and bursaries. 

==Undergraduate student conference==
The Agora Student Conference is held annually at RDP in support of undergraduates in the Social Sciences and Humanities. Having started in 2004, the conference has continued to grow and gain recognition from neighbouring institutions such as the University of Calgary. Those who present their original papers, presentations, or creative works at the conference also have the opportunity to have their work published in the Agora Journal, distributed by RDP.

== Campuses==
Red Deer Polytechnic&#x27;s Main Campus is situated in the city of Red Deer, midway between the larger cities of Edmonton and Calgary. The campus is located near the Queen Elizabeth II Highway, an hour and a half drive from either of the above cities. The main campus features a library, a bar, a restaurant, a Tim Hortons, a Starbucks, and other food-related businesses.

===Donald School of Business/Downtown Campus===

The Donald School of Business (DSB) was situated in downtown Red Deer in the Millennium Centre building. It occupied floors 3, 4, and 5. In 2021, the Donald School of Business returned to the main Red Deer Polytechnic Campus.

===Welikoklad Event Centre===

Red Deer College has a third campus/building directly across from the DSB. It features a stage, a movie theatre, and an art gallery space. It is used for some shows, and for when RDP hosts the Backpacks to Briefcases for students.

===Gary W. Harris Canada Games Centre===

Completed in 2018 for the 2019 Canada Winter Games, the Gary W. Harris Canada Games Centre (popularly known as the GWH) features an ice arena (capable of Olympic sized ice), a performance gymnasium, a fitness centre, running/sprinting tracks, squash courts, and a massive court surface capable of holding four volleyball or two basketball games simultaneously.

==Athletics==
Team and mixed sports Red Deer Polytechnic participate in include: basketball, soccer, volleyball, hockey, badminton, cross country running, curling, rodeo, dance, and (formerly) golf. They are particularly known for volleyball.

==Notable alumni==

<text>Beverly Jean Davenport LaHaye ( Ratcliffe; April 30, 1929 – April 14, 2024) was an American Christian conservative activist and author who founded Concerned Women for America (CWA) in San Diego, California, in 1979. She was the wife of Tim LaHaye, an evangelical Christian minister and author of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, until his death in 2016.

== Personal life ==
Beverly Jean Davenport was born in Oakland County, Michigan, on April 30, 1929, to Lowell Ardo and Nellie Elizabeth (née Pitts) Davenport. Her father was a factory worker in Southfield, Michigan, and died of a ruptured appendix when Beverly was almost two years old. Within two years, Nellie Elizabeth married Daniel Ratcliffe, a tool maker in the auto industry in Oakland County, Michigan. From then on, Beverly Jean and her older sister Blanche Aileen used their stepfather&#x27;s surname as their own.

She graduated from Highland Park Community High School in 1946. She attended Bob Jones University (then named Bob Jones College) and married Air Force veteran and aspiring pastor Tim LaHaye in 1947. After attending college for one year, she dropped out and joined the workforce to support the family finances, as her husband Tim made little money as a pastor. In 1956, the LaHayes moved to San Diego, California, where Tim became the pastor of Scott Memorial Baptist Church. Beverly became the church secretary and helped direct junior Sunday School. Despite having a shy personality and struggling with the monotony of homemaking, LaHaye believed that homemaking would help her learn submission. Along with her husband, LaHaye was a member of Liberty University&#x27;s board of trustees. In 69 years of marriage, the LaHayes had four children, Linda, Larry, Lee, and Lori, and nine grandchildren.

LaHaye died at a hospice facility in El Cajon, California, on April 14, 2024, at the age of 94.

==Concerned Women for America==
LaHaye formed Concerned Women for America (CWA) in 1979. Initially, CWA was a reaction to the National Organization for Women and a 1978 Barbara Walters interview with feminist Betty Friedan. LaHaye stated that she believed Friedan&#x27;s goal was &quot;to dismantle the bedrock of American culture: the family&quot;, and that Christian women were not included in discussions of women&#x27;s rights. LaHaye held a rally in a local San Diego auditorium which marked the beginning of CWA.

While CWA was originally intended to be a local group, the organization was established nationwide within two years. The organization calls itself &quot;the nation&#x27;s largest public policy women&#x27;s organization devoted to biblical principles.&quot; When CWA&#x27;s headquarters moved to Washington, D.C., LaHaye &quot;announced at a press conference: &#x27;This is our message: the feminists do not speak for all women in America, and CWA is here in Washington to end the monopoly of feminists who claim to speak for all women.

The CWA strongly supported Ronald Reagan during his presidency, and Reagan credited LaHaye with &quot;changing the face of American politics&quot;.

CWA is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that is &quot;supported by hundreds of local chapters across the country.&quot; In 2014, &quot;Salon&quot; stated that &quot;CWA [had] become a powerful political force, claiming over half a million members.&quot; LaHaye led the organization until 2006.

==Published works==
LaHaye and her husband co-authored the self-help sex manual &quot;The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love&quot; in 1976.

LaHaye wrote &quot;The Spirit-Controlled Woman&quot; in 1976, a companion to her husband&#x27;s book &quot;The Spirit-Controlled Temperament&quot;. A revised and expanded edition of the book, &quot;The New Spirit-Controlled Woman&quot;, was released in 2005. &quot;The Desires of a Woman&#x27;s Heart&quot; was released in 1993.

<text>The 45th parallel south is a circle of latitude that is 45° south of the Earth&#x27;s equator.
It is the line that marks the theoretical halfway point between the equator and the South Pole. The true halfway point is south of this parallel because Earth is not a perfect sphere, but bulges at the equator and is flattened at the poles.

Unlike its northern counterpart, almost all (97%) of it passes through open ocean. It crosses the South Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, Australasia (New Zealand and just south of Tasmania), the Southern Ocean, and Patagonia.

At this latitude, daytime lasts for 15 hours, 37 minutes during the December solstice and 8 hours, 46 minutes during the June solstice for the dates in 2024. This holds true regardless of longitude. The midday Sun stands 21.17° above the northern horizon at the June solstice, 68.83° at the December solstice, and exactly 45.0° at either equinox.

<text>is a Japanese former gymnast and one of the most successful Olympic athletes of all time. Between 1968 and 1976 he won twelve Olympic medals, including eight gold medals, making him the most successful Japanese Olympian by number of gold medals won.

== Biography ==

Katō was born in Niigata Prefecture on October 11, 1946, and studied at the Tokyo Kyoiku University. He first competed in the Olympics in 1968, alongside his elder brother Takeshi. They won the team competition, with Sawao also taking gold medals in the all-around and on the floor. He placed third in the rings event.

Four years later the Japanese men&#x27;s gymnastics team dominated the 1972 Olympics, taking 15 out of 21 individual medals. Katō won gold medals all-around and in the parallel bars and silvers on the horizontal bar and pommel horse. He aimed for an unprecedented third gold medal in the all-around at the 1976 Summer Olympics, but was defeated by Nikolai Andrianov. The team competition was close this time, but the Japanese defeated the Soviets by four tenths of a point, earning their fifth consecutive title. Katō closed out his Olympic career by retaining his title in the parallel bars.

Katō is one of only ten athletes to have won eight or more Olympic gold medals. He is one of the most successful male gymnasts ever at the Olympics: his eight gold and twelve overall medals are best rivaled by Nikolai Andrianov&#x27;s seven gold and 15 overall, Boris Shakhlin&#x27;s seven gold and 13 overall, and Takashi Ono&#x27;s five gold and 13 overall. He won more Olympic gold medals than any Japanese Olympian, and is second after Ono in the total number of medals. In 2001, Katō was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

As of 2010, Katō was a professor emeritus at the University of Tsukuba. On May 14, 2021, Jovian asteroid 43212 Katosawao, discovered by astronomers with the American LINEAR survey in 2000, was .

<doc id="800440" wikidata="Q17021809" url="?curid=800440" title="Southampton City Council">
<text>Southampton City Council is the local authority of the city of Southampton in the ceremonial county of Hampshire, England. Southampton has had a council since medieval times, which has been reformed on numerous occasions. Since 1997 the council has been a unitary authority, being a district council which also performs the functions of a county council; it is independent from Hampshire County Council.

The council has been under Labour majority control since 2022. It is based at Southampton Civic Centre.

==History==

Southampton was an ancient borough, with the earliest known borough charter dating from 1154. Southampton City Council has records in its archives of council meetings as early as 1199. The borough was led by a mayor from the 13th century. In 1447 the borough was given the right to appoint its own sheriff which made it a county corporate, removing it from the jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Hampshire.

In 1836, Southampton was reformed to become a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. It was then governed by a body formally called the &#x27;mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Southampton&#x27;, generally known as the corporation, town council or borough council.

When elected county councils were established in 1889, Southampton was considered large enough for the existing borough council to also run county-level services, and so it was made a county borough, independent from the new Hampshire County Council. The borough boundaries were enlarged on several occasions.

The borough was granted city status on 11 February 1964, after which the corporation was also known as Southampton City Council.

Southampton was reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It kept the same boundaries (which had last been enlarged in 1967), but the council became a lower-tier district council, with Hampshire County Council providing services to the city for the first time.

In 1997, Southampton City Council regained responsibility for county-level services from Hampshire County Council as part of the 1990s UK local government reforms. The way this change was implemented was to create a new non-metropolitan county of Southampton covering the same area as the existing district, but with no separate county council; instead the existing city council took on county functions, making it a unitary authority. This therefore had the effect of restoring the city council to the powers it had held when Southampton was a county borough prior to 1974. Southampton remains part of the ceremonial county of Hampshire for the purposes of lieutenancy.

In 2022 the city&#x27;s mayor was granted the additional honorific title of lord mayor following the Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours competition. The city council also continues to appoint a sheriff, although the role has lost its judicial functions. It is now a ceremonial position, serving as deputy to the lord mayor. Southampton is one of only fifteen towns and cities across England and Wales which retain the right to appoint their own sheriff.

==Powers and functions==
The local authority derives its powers and functions from the Local Government Act 1972 and subsequent legislation. For the purposes of local government, Southampton is within a non-metropolitan area of England. As a unitary authority, Southampton City Council has the powers and functions of both a non-metropolitan county and district council combined. In its capacity as a district council it is a billing authority collecting Council Tax and business rates, it processes local planning applications, it is responsible for housing, waste collection and environmental health. In its capacity as a county council it is a local education authority, responsible for social services, libraries and waste disposal.

In August 2018 the council launched its own not-for-profit energy company &#x27;CitizEn&#x27;, created with the ambition to offer competitive rates for energy to tackle fuel poverty in the city. The company was set up in cooperation with Nottingham City Council’s company Robin Hood Energy. The scheme has since been sold to British Gas.

===Local Authority Trading Company===
In response to the 2008 financial crash and the Great Recession the then city council, under the administration of the Conservative Party, began a process of privatisation of council services. From 2017 the Labour administration had begun a process taking municipal control of services that were privatised, so that all profits are reinvested into council services. These services were set up and the Southampton &quot;Local Authority Trading Company&quot; (LATCo) was created. Potential areas for the LATCo to cover include: street parking; public transport; adult and children’s transport; fleet services; housing management and operations; street cleansing; waste management; parks and open spaces; and facilities management.

In 2018 the council began the process of incorporating services which Capita had provided for the council for 11 years, including &quot;customer services, HR pay, revenues and benefits, procurement, health and safety, print, post room and IT services&quot;. This also includes the incorporation of 300 jobs under the council&#x27;s LATCo.

===Joint Committees===
Southampton had sent a representative to the South East England Regional Assembly during its existence between 1998 and 2010. Created by the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 and based in Guildford, the voluntary assembly met six times a year and was responsible for the South East England Development Agency, a project which oversaw investment projects in the south east region. The council remains a member of the South East England Councils.

Solent Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) is chaired by several businesses, universities and councils including Southampton City Council and primarily focuses on economic growth in the Hampshire region. The Solent LEP&#x27;s Growth Hub is based in Southampton. There was an ambition to create a combined authority for the South Hampshire area, including Southampton, Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight which would include the potential for a combined authority mayor. This program was controversial, and was finally blocked by Hampshire County Council in 2017. There continues to be interest in partnership between Southampton City Council, Eastleigh Borough Council and neighbouring components of other Hampshire districts (New Forest District Council and Test Valley Borough Council).

Southampton City Council is also a founding member of the &#x27;Key Cities&#x27; group. It is a lobbying group of 24 other cities across Great Britain, formed in 2013, that lobbies the government for greater devolution and funding
==Political control==
The council has been under Labour majority control since 2022.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:

Lower-tier non-metropolitan district
Unitary authority
===Leadership===
The role of Lord Mayor is largely ceremonial in Southampton, with a different councillor usually being appointed to the role each year. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1996 have been:

===Composition===
Following the by-election in Shirley in 2024 the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in May 2026.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2023, the council comprises 51 councillors representing 17 wards, with three councillors being elected for each ward. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four-year term of office. The wards are:
* Banister and Polygon
* Bargate
* Bassett
* Bevois
* Bitterne Park
* Coxford
* Freemantle
* Harefield
* Millbrook
* Peartree
* Portswood
* Redbridge
* Shirley
* Sholing
* Swaythling
* Thornhill
* Woolston
==Premises==
The council is based at the Civic Centre, which was purpose-built for the council in phases between 1928 and 1939.

<doc id="800465" wikidata="Q558416" url="?curid=800465" title="Tim LaHaye">
<text>Timothy Francis LaHaye (April 27, 1926 – July 25, 2016) was an American Baptist evangelical Christian minister who wrote more than 85 books, both fiction and non-fiction, including the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series of apocalyptic fiction, which he co-authored with Jerry B. Jenkins.

He was a founder of the Council for National Policy, a conservative Christian advocacy group. LaHaye opposed homosexuality, believing it to be immoral and unbiblical. He was a critic of Roman Catholicism, and a believer in conspiracy theories regarding the Illuminati.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Timothy Francis LaHaye was born on April 27, 1926, in Detroit, Michigan, to Frank LaHaye, a Ford auto worker who died in 1936 of a heart attack, and Margaret LaHaye (née Palmer). His father&#x27;s death had a significant influence on LaHaye, who was only nine years old at the time. He had been inconsolable until the minister at the funeral said, &quot;This is not the end of Frank LaHaye; because he accepted Jesus Christ, the day will come when the Lord will shout from heaven and descend, and the dead in Christ will rise first and then we&#x27;ll be caught up together to meet him in the air.&quot;

LaHaye later said that, upon hearing those remarks, &quot;all of a sudden, there was hope in my heart I&#x27;d see my father again.&quot;

LaHaye enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in 1944, at the age of 18, after he finished high school. He served in the European Theater of Operations as a machine gunner aboard a bomber. Then he studied at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, and obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1950. LaHaye held the Doctor of Ministry degree from Western Seminary.

===Ministry===
He served as a pastor in Pumpkintown, South Carolina, and after that he pastored a congregation in Minneapolis until 1956. After that, the LaHaye family moved to San Diego, California, where he served as pastor of the Scott Memorial Baptist Church (now called Shadow Mountain Community Church) for nearly 25 years. In 1971, he founded Christian Heritage College, now known as San Diego Christian College.

In 1972, LaHaye helped establish the Institute for Creation Research in El Cajon, California, along with Henry M. Morris.

===Political activism===

LaHaye started numerous groups to promote his views, having become involved in politics at the Christian Voice during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1979, he encouraged Jerry Falwell to found the Moral Majority and sat on its board of directors. LaHaye&#x27;s wife, Beverly, founded Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian women&#x27;s activist group.

Then in 1981, he left the pulpit to concentrate his time on politics and writing. That year, he helped found the Council for National Policy (CNP), a policy making think tank in which membership is only available through invitation. ABC News called it &quot;the most powerful conservative organization in America you&#x27;ve never heard of&quot;.

In the 1980s he was criticized by the evangelical community for accepting money from Bo Hi Pak, a longtime Sun Myung Moon operative. He was additionally criticized for joining Moon&#x27;s Council for Religious Freedom, which was founded to protest Moon&#x27;s 1984 imprisonment. In 1996, LaHaye&#x27;s wife spoke at an event sponsored by Moon.

In the 1980s, LaHaye founded the American Coalition for Traditional Values and the Coalition for Religious Freedom. He founded the Pre-Tribulation Research Center along with Thomas Ice in 1998. The center is dedicated to producing material that supports a dispensationalist, pre-tribulation interpretation of the Bible. He was a member of and speaker for the John Birch Society (JBS), a conservative, anti-communist group; scholar Celestini Carmen argues that LaHaye used the JBS&#x27;s culture war methods and rhetoric of &quot;fear, apocalyptic thought and conspiracy&quot; to forge the Moral Majority, with &quot;fear, anger, and disgust as essential ingredients.&quot; His book &quot;Rapture Under Attack&quot; describes his time in the JBS and relationship to its leader, Robert W. Welch Jr.

LaHaye also took more direct roles in presidential politics. He supported Ronald Reagan&#x27;s elections as United States president. He was a co-chairman of Jack Kemp&#x27;s 1988 presidential bid but was removed from the campaign after four days when his anti-Catholic views became known. LaHaye played a significant role in getting the Religious Right to support George W. Bush for the presidency in 2000. In 2007, he endorsed Mike Huckabee during the primaries and served as his spiritual advisor.

===&quot;Left Behind&quot;===

LaHaye is best known for the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series of apocalyptic fiction that depicts the Earth after the pretribulation rapture which Premillennial Dispensationalists believe the Bible states, multiple times, will occur. The books were LaHaye&#x27;s idea, though Jerry B. Jenkins, a former sportswriter with numerous other works of fiction to his name, wrote the books from LaHaye&#x27;s notes.

The series, which started in 1995 with the first novel, includes 12 titles in the adult series, as well as juvenile novels, audio books, devotionals, and graphic novels. The books have been very popular, with total sales surpassing 65 million copies as of July 2016. Seven titles in the adult series have reached No. 1 on the bestseller lists for &quot;The New York Times, USA Today&quot;, and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. Jerry Falwell said about the first book in the series: &quot;In terms of its impact on Christianity, it&#x27;s probably greater than that of any other book in modern times, outside the Bible.&quot; The best-selling series has been compared to the equally popular works of Tom Clancy and Stephen King: &quot;the plotting is brisk and the characterizations Manichean. People disappear and things blow up.&quot;

LaHaye indicates that the idea for the series came to him one day circa 1994, while he was sitting on an airplane and observed a married pilot flirting with a flight attendant. He wondered what would befall the pilot if the Rapture happened at that moment. The first book in the series opens with a similar scene. He sold the movie rights for the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series and later stated he regretted that decision, because the films turned out to be &quot;church-basement videos&quot;, rather than &quot;a big-budget blockbuster&quot; that he had hoped for.

===Later activities===
In 2001, LaHaye co-hosted with Dave Breese the prophecy television program &quot;The King Is Coming&quot;. In 2001, LaHaye gave $4.5 million to Liberty University to build a new student center, which opened in January 2002 and was named after LaHaye. He, alongside his wife, served as a member of Liberty&#x27;s board of trustees.

He provided funds for the LaHaye Ice Center on the campus of Liberty University, which opened in January 2006.

LaHaye&#x27;s book &quot;The Rapture&quot; was released on June 6, 2006, in order to capitalize on a 6-6-6 connection.

===Personal life and death===
Tim LaHaye married activist and fellow author Beverly Ratcliffe in 1947 while attending Bob Jones University.

In July 2016, the LaHayes celebrated their 69th wedding anniversary. They had four children and nine grandchildren, and lived in the Los Angeles area. The LaHayes owned a condo in Rancho Mirage, California.

LaHaye died on July 25, 2016, in a hospital in San Diego, California, after suffering from a stroke, aged 90. In addition to his wife, Beverly, he was survived by four children, nine grandchildren, 16 great grandchildren, a brother (Richard LaHaye), and a sister. His funeral service took place at Shadow Mountain Community Church on August 12, 2016, with David Jeremiah, who succeeded LaHaye as pastor at what was then Scott Memorial Baptist Church, led the service. LaHaye is interred at Miramar National Cemetery in San Diego, California.

==Social views==
===Homosexuality===

In 1978 LaHaye published &quot;The Unhappy Gays&quot;, which was later retitled &quot;What Everyone Should Know About Homosexuality&quot;. The book called homosexuals &quot;militant, organized&quot; and &quot;vile.&quot; &quot;The Unhappy Gays&quot; also argues that homosexuals share 16 pernicious traits, including &quot;incredible promiscuity&quot;, &quot;deceit&quot;, &quot;selfishness&quot;, &quot;vulnerability to sadism-masochism&quot;, and &quot;poor health and an early death.&quot; He believed that homosexuality can be cured. However, he said that such conversions are rare.

===Global conspiracies===
LaHaye believed that the Illuminati is secretly engineering world affairs. In &quot;Rapture Under Attack&quot; he wrote:I myself have been a forty-five year student of the satanically-inspired, centuries-old conspiracy to use government, education, and media to destroy every vestige of Christianity within our society and establish a new world order. Having read at least fifty books on the Illuminati, I am convinced that it exists and can be blamed for many of man&#x27;s inhumane actions against his fellow man during the past two hundred years.

The Illuminati is just one of many groups that he believed are working to &quot;turn America into an amoral, humanist country, ripe for merger into a one-world socialist state.&quot; Other secret societies and liberal groups working to destroy &quot;every vestige of Christianity&quot;, according to LaHaye, include: the Trilateral Commission, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Organization for Women, Planned Parenthood, &quot;the major TV networks, high-profile newspapers and newsmagazines,&quot; the State Department, major foundations (Rockefeller, Carnegie, Ford), the United Nations, &quot;the left wing of the Democratic Party&quot;, Harvard, Yale &quot;and 2,000 other colleges and universities.&quot;

===Eschatology and &quot;Left Behind&quot;===
LaHaye held apocalyptic beliefs and asserted the end of the world was near. Other believers in dispensational premillennialism, who believe that the return of Jesus is imminent, criticize various aspects of his theology, saying he has &quot;some real problems with his prophetical teachings in the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series.&quot; It is noted that &quot;in books 8 &amp; 9, LaHaye and Jenkins teach that [non-willing] recipients of the mark of the beast can still be saved&quot;. However, in &quot;The Mark&quot;, &quot;the Chang scenario&quot; is developed, whereby a character receives both the mark of the beast and the sealing of the Lord. In &quot;Desecration&quot;, his dual-marking was justified in the storyline. This has led some readers to wonder &quot;how a Christian can have the mark of the beast and still be saved&quot; and has been asked many times by perplexed readers on the &quot;Left Behind&quot; messageboard. Attempts to address this question have appeared on the FAQ page at LeftBehind.com.

Many mainstream Christians and certain other evangelicals had broader disagreements with the series as a whole, pointing out that &quot;most biblical scholars largely reject the eschatological assumptions of this kind of pop end-times literature.&quot; Others say that LaHaye portrays the Book of Revelation with a selective literalism, choosing to take some things literally (such as the violence) and others as metaphor (the Beast) as it suits his point of view. In &quot;The Rapture Exposed&quot; by Barbara Rossing, a number of criticisms are raised regarding the series, particularly its focus on violence.

===Anti-Catholic sentiments===
LaHaye was a harsh critic of Roman Catholicism, which he called &quot;a false religion&quot;. In his 1973 book &quot;Revelation Illustrated and Made Plain&quot;, he stated that the Catholic Church &quot;is more dangerous than no religion because she substitutes religion for truth&quot; and &quot;is also dangerous because some of her doctrines are pseudo-Christian.&quot; Elsewhere the same book compared Catholic ceremonies to pagan rituals. It was these statements that were largely responsible for LaHaye&#x27;s dismissal from Jack Kemp&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign. It was later revealed that Scott Memorial Baptist Church, the San Diego church that LaHaye had pastored throughout the 1970s, had sponsored an anti-Catholic group called Mission to Catholics; one of their pamphlets asserted that Pope Paul VI was the &quot;archpriest of Satan, a deceiver, and an antichrist, who has, like Judas, gone to his own place.&quot;

The issue of anti-Catholicism also comes up in regard to the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. While the fictional Pope John XXIV was raptured, he is described as having &quot;stirred up controversy in the church with a new doctrine that seemed to coincide more with the &#x27;heresy&#x27; of Martin Luther than with the historic orthodoxy they were used to,&quot; and this is implied as the reason he was raptured. His successor, Pope Peter II, becomes Pontifex Maximus of Enigma Babylon One World Faith, an amalgamation of all remaining world faiths and religions.

Other Catholic writers have said that while the books aren&#x27;t &quot;anti-Catholic per se&quot;, they reflect LaHaye&#x27;s other writings on the subject.

Despite his anti-Catholic views, he praised traditionalist Catholic director Mel Gibson&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, saying that &quot;Everyone should see this movie. It could be Hollywood&#x27;s finest achievement to date.&quot; He also endorsed Catholic convert Newt Gingrich for president in 2012.

==Tributes==
&quot;Time Magazine&quot; named LaHaye one of the 25 most influential evangelicals in America, and in the summer of 2001, the &quot;Evangelical Studies Bulletin&quot; named him the most influential Christian leader of the preceding quarter century.

==Awards==
He received an Honorary Doctorate in Literature from Liberty University.

== Works ==

LaHaye authored over 85 books in his lifetime.

<text>Ohio&#x27;s at-large congressional district existed from 1803 to 1813, from 1913 to 1915, from 1933 to 1953 and from 1963 until 1967, when it was banned by the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

From statehood in 1803 until the 1813 redistricting following the 1810 census, Ohio had only one member of the United States House of Representatives: Jeremiah Morrow.

== List of members representing the district ==

After the 1810 census, the at-large seat was eliminated. It was reinstated after the 1910 census.

From the 1930 census to the 1940 census, there were two seats elected at-large, on a general ticket.

In 1953, the seat was eliminated. It was restored in 1963.

In 1967, the at-large district was eliminated, and Ohio&#x27;s 24th congressional district was created to replace it.

<text>James Leighton (born 24 July 1958) is a Scottish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Leighton started his career with Aberdeen, where he won seven domestic trophies and the 1982–83 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup under the management of Alex Ferguson. Ferguson then signed Leighton for Manchester United in 1988, but dropped him after he conceded three goals in the 1990 FA Cup Final. Leighton then had spells with Arsenal, Reading, Dundee and Sheffield United, and rebuilt his career after joining Hibernian in 1993. He returned to Aberdeen in 1997, leading to a career total of over 600 appearances in the league alone.

Leighton played in 91 international matches for Scotland. He was chosen for Scotland&#x27;s FIFA World Cup squads in 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1998, playing in the latter three of those tournaments.

==Playing career==
===Aberdeen===
Leighton joined Aberdeen from Scottish Junior club Dalry Thistle in 1977, after working in the civil service on leaving school. Before breaking into the Aberdeen first team he was loaned out for one season to Highland League club Deveronvale, where he is now an inductee of the club&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Leighton achieved his greatest success under the management of Alex Ferguson in the early to mid-1980s. With Leighton in goal, Ferguson&#x27;s Aberdeen won Premier Division titles in 1984 and 1985, the Scottish Cup four times, the Scottish League Cup once, and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and Super Cup in 1983.

Brian Clough, a notorious critic of other goalkeepers for the national team during the 1970s and 1980s, has been reported as saying &quot;Jim Leighton is a rare bird – a Scottish goalkeeper that can be relied on.&quot;

===Manchester United===
Ferguson, who had left Aberdeen to manage Manchester United in 1986, signed Leighton for £750,000 in 1988. In his first season with United, the club finished 11th. Leighton conceded 35 league goals and kept 14 clean sheets, while he conceded more than two goals only once in all competitions.

In 1989–90 United finished two places lower in the league in 13th. Leighton played when United were defeated 5–1 in the league by newly promoted neighbours Manchester City, and conceded three goals in 1990 FA Cup Final, a 3–3 draw with Crystal Palace. He was then dropped from the United starting lineup for the replay, in which Les Sealey made a number of saves as United won the match 1–0. Leighton&#x27;s disappointment was such that when handed the winner&#x27;s medal by Sealey, he later returned it to his replacement&#x27;s pocket, and when a medal specifically for Leighton was received by the club due to his appearance in the first match, he declined that too. The two players remained close friends, although Leighton&#x27;s relationship with Ferguson deteriorated to the point where the two were no longer on speaking terms.

Sealey retained the position of first-choice goalkeeper for the 1990–91 season after signing a permanent contract. Although Leighton remained contracted to United for nearly two more years, he played only one more game for the club (against Halifax Town in the Football League Cup on 26 September 1990). He was fourth choice keeper in 1990–91 behind Sealey, Gary Walsh and youngster Mark Bosnich, and was loaned to Arsenal between March and May 1991, a period in which they won the league title, although he did not play.

Leighton remained fourth choice United keeper in season 1991–92 behind Peter Schmeichel, Walsh and youngster Ian Wilkinson. He spent a portion of that season on loan with third-tier Reading.

===Return to Scotland===
In March 1992 Iain Munro signed him for Dundee for a £200,000 fee. He played in the last dozen league games of the season winning the title in the Scottish second tier and promotion to the top flight. He was out of favour at Dens Park after Simon Stainrod replaced Munro as manager. Leighton had another non-playing loan spell at Sheffield United. 

His career was revitalised after Alex Miller signed him for Hibernian in summer 1993, Leighton playing over 150 games and missing only one league match in four seasons. He played in the 1993 Scottish League Cup Final defeat to Rangers. He was recalled to the Scotland national team, collecting 23 of his 91 Scotland caps at Hibs. He later said he played the best football of his career in his spell at Easter Road and rated Miller the second-best manager he played under.

In 1997 Leighton returned to Aberdeen, where he featured regularly for another three seasons and reached 500 appearances for the club in 1998. He was captain in the 2000 Scottish League Cup final defeat to Celtic.

He retired from playing after the 2000 Scottish Cup final defeat by Rangers. In that game he was substituted after three minutes, suffering a broken jaw in a challenge from Rod Wallace (requiring the insertion of metal plates into his face). With no substitute goalkeeper available, forward Robbie Winters took over in goal and Aberdeen lost 4–0. Leighton&#x27;s final league appearance that season meant that he set the record for the oldest player in the Scottish Premier League at 41 years and 302 days (since broken by Andy Millen in 2007).

In July 2000 he was given a testimonial against Middlesbrough, the same opponent as in his first appearance for Aberdeen in a 1978 friendly; however he could not actually play in the match due to recovering from his cup final injury. He released his autobiography the same year. In 2004 he was inducted into the club&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

===International career===
Leighton&#x27;s international career lasted for 16 years, from 1982 to 1998. He was an uncapped squad member for the 1982 World Cup, before making his debut against East Germany on 13 October 1982. Within two years he was his country&#x27;s No. 1, and he played in all of his country&#x27;s matches at the 1986 and 1990 World Cups.

After Leighton fell out of favour at club level, Andy Goram became Scotland first choice goalkeeper and played at Euro 92 and Euro 96. Leighton regained the position after a man of the match performance in a 1-0 home win versus Sweden in November 1996 during qualification for the 1998 World Cup. Leighton played all three Scotland matches at the tournament finals and became the last football player born in the 1950s to play in a FIFA World Cup game.

He retired from international football on 10 October 1998. His last match was a European Championship qualifier against Estonia when aged 40 years and 78 days. This set a new record as the oldest player to play for Scotland, since broken by David Weir in September 2010 and later by Craig Gordon in June 2024. Leighton is a member of the Scotland Football Hall of Fame, having won his 50th cap in 1989. Leighton played 91 times for Scotland, second only to Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s 102 appearances.

==Coaching career==
Leighton became Aberdeen&#x27;s goalkeeping coach after retiring as a player. He parted company with the club in August 2009 when manager Mark McGhee (his former teammate, who had also brought him to Reading years earlier) chose to replace him with Colin Meldrum. In February 2010 he was appointed as goalkeeping coach for Huntly in the Highland League. Leighton was reappointed as the goalkeeping coach at Aberdeen on 13 December 2010, the first act of the new management team of Craig Brown and Archie Knox; he left the club again at the request of manager Derek McInnes, at the end of the 2014–15 season. He commented soon afterwards that he would look for work outside football, as he was unwilling to relocate from Aberdeen due to other work and family commitments, and subsequently became a sales manager for companies providing services to the city&#x27;s offshore industry.

<text>The Tradewater River is a tributary of the Ohio River, approximately long, in western Kentucky in the United States. It drains an area of in the limestone hills south of Evansville, Indiana, between the basins of the Cumberland River on the west and the Green River on the east.

==Description==
It rises in northern Christian County, approximately north of Hopkinsville. It flows generally northwest in a tight meandering course, past Pennyrile Forest State Resort Park, where a tributary is impounded to form Lake Beshear just upstream from its mouth on the Tradewater. It flows past Dawson Springs and joins the Ohio from the southeast approximately southwest of Sturgis.

At Providence, the Tradewater has a mean annual discharge of 1,070 cubic feet per second.

The river has a low gradient with a gentle flow along much of its course. It forms a rough boundary between the Shawnee Hills physiographic region to the northeast and the Pennyroyal physiographic region to the southwest. The Shawnee Hills region is underlain by Pennsylvanian limestone, sandstone, and shale which contain deposits of coal. The Pennyroyal region, which is drained by tributaries of the upper Tradewater, is a dissected upland plateau underlain by Mississippian limestone bedrock.

By 1990, heavy mining activity in the region had filled the river with silt.

<doc id="800492" wikidata="Q2447258" url="?curid=800492" title="Paracho de Verduzco">
<text>Paracho de Verduzco (often called Paracho) is a small city located in Michoacán, Mexico. It is located about west of the state capital Morelia. The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of Paracho. It has a population of 37,464.

Paracho is well known throughout both Mexico and elsewhere in the world as a hub of lutherie. This is because the town&#x27;s craftsmen are reputed to make the best sounding guitars and vihuelas in all of Mexico. The town is full of music shops that sell handmade stringed instruments. Some instruments that can be found in Paracho are: ten-string mandolins, armadillo-backed guitars (concheras) and mandolins, and acoustic bass guitars, as well as regular classical guitars and mandolins, bajo sextos, vihuelas, guitarrones and many others. Many of the stores and workshops allow visitors to watch the guitar-making process directly.

A national festival &quot;Feria de La Guitarra&quot; is held in Paracho once a year, usually the second week of August. Lasting nine days having its culture, gastronomic and traditions display. From its traditional &quot;Pan&quot; to its famous guitars, Paracho is rich in culture and traditions.

== History ==

The city remains renowned for its guitars and luthiers, a tradition dating back over 480 years. When Spanish conquistadors arrived in west-central Mexico, a priest named Vasco de Quiroga determined that each indigenous village should learn a craft to foster economic mobility and integration into the Spanish colonial system. Similar systems were established by Quiroga in Santa Clara, where copper was produced, and in Uruapan, where lacquerware was turned out. The choice to have the remote village of Paracho specialize in stringed instruments was a strategic one from Quiroga, as the area was surrounded by forests of pine; allowing raw material to be abundant and allowing many families to perfect their craft throughout the generations.

Despite the Paracho luthiers honing their craft over generations, the models produced there differ drastically from their European counterparts. Yale anthropologist Ron Fernandez, who imports guitars from Spain, noted this difference, attributing it to the methods of construction, particularly in terms of tools used. While European methods typically involve a workbench with forms, the Mexican methods remained carving wood while seated, the practices of their indigenous ancestors. For over a century, Paracho luthiers would sometimes deconstruct foreign guitars that arrived in town to enhance their craftsmanship. Eventually in the 1980s, Paracho began hosting master luthiers from Spain to refine their craft, resulting in improved guitar quality. Today, Paracho remains a place where mariachi bands and other groups can purchase good quality accessibly instruments to play throughout Mexico. It also became a popular tourist destination where tourists can buy a factory-made or handmade guitar at very affordable prices.

<doc id="800509" wikidata="Q4644205" url="?curid=800509" title="7th Toronto Regiment, RCA">
<text>The 7th Toronto Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery is a militia (i.e. part-time reserves) regiment of 4th Canadian Division&#x27;s 32 Canadian Brigade Group,

The regiment was formed in 1965 when all the gunner units within the Toronto garrison (29th Field Regiment, 42nd Medium Regiment and 1st Locating Regiment) were merged. The regiment is proud to be the only Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery in Canada to include the name of its home city in its title. The City of Toronto has recognized this distinction by granting the Freedom of the City to the regiment in May 1966.

As with all regiments with the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery it has two mottos: &quot;Ubique&quot; (&quot;Everywhere&quot;) and &quot;Quo Fas Et Gloria Ducunt&quot; (&quot;Whither Right and Glory Lead&quot;). These mottos replaced individual battle honours carried by artillery units until 1832. &quot;Ubique&quot; denotes the active service of the regiment everywhere in the world and the major part played by the artillery regiment in all battles. It takes the place of all past or future battle honours and distinctions gained in the field.

There are three batteries within the regiment, 9 battery – the howitzer or gun battery, 15 battery – the Light Urban Search and Rescue battery (LUSAR), and 130 battery – the headquarters battery as well as training and recruiting. Currently all three batteries parade at Moss Park Armoury.

The regiment currently operates the 105mm C3 Howitzer along with the 81mm Mortar. As well as 105mm C1 Howitzers for ceremonial salutes such as the one fired in Queen&#x27;s Park on Remembrance Day. Gun crews are also trained in the C6, C7, C9A1, M72 and 84mm Carl Gustav.

The regiment has sent its volunteer citizen soldiers to serve with NATO forces in Germany as part of 1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery and to United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Cyprus and the NATO Stabilization Force in Bosnia. Gunners have deployed on three civil emergency operations: to Manitoba to stem the Red River flooding, to Eastern Ontario to help communities recover from the devastating ice storm of 1998 and on OP LASER a response to the global COVID 19 pandemic. Other members of the regiment have most recently served with the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.

==History==

The history of artillery units in Canada begins with the professional batteries of New France, whose ability to move ordnance great distances through the wilderness impressed Montcalm. Canadian gunners served with the British Army during the American War of Independence and again in the War of 1812.

===Before and after Confederation===

The 7th Toronto Regiment, RCA traces its historical roots to the Volunteer Incorporated Artillery Company formed in 1813 under the command of Captain Alexander Cameron. On December 5, 1837, under the command of Major T. Carfrae the 1st Toronto Artillery Company, as the Volunteer Incorporated Artillery Company had become, put an end to the Mackenzie Rebellion by firing upon Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern. Following the 1855 Militia Act the company was redesignated The Toronto Field battery, which in turn became No. 9 &quot;Toronto&quot; Field battery in 1894 and the 9th &quot;Toronto&quot; Field battery in 1895. On July 1, 1889, the 9th &quot;Toronto&quot; Field battery CA, along with the 4th &quot;St. Catharines&quot; Field battery CA and the 7th &quot;Hamilton&quot; battery CA formed the 2nd Bde Div of Field Artillery, Canadian Artillery.

===World War I===

In World War I, 9th battery equipped with 18 pdrs fought as part of 3rd Fd Bde, 1st Cdn Div until 1917, when it was transferred to the 3rd Fd Bde, 4th Cdn Div for the remainder of the war with 4.5 in. howitzers. 15th, 30th, and 53rd batteries were formed in 1916, all with 18 pdrs. The 15th were assigned to 4th Fd Bde, 2nd Div, the 30th went to 6th Fd Bde, 3rd Div, while the 53rd went to 13th Fd Bde, 5th Div. Thus the Toronto gunners were represented in all World War I Canadian divisions. In addition, the 1st Siege battery equipped with 9.2 in. howitzers fought with 1st Bde, Cdn Garrison Artillery, Cdn Corps Heavy Artillery.

===Interwar period===

A formation was authorized on March 15, 1931, as the &#x27;7th Toronto Regiment, CA&#x27;. It was redesignated: &#x27;7th (Toronto) Regiment, CA&#x27; on October 1, 1933; &#x27;7th (Toronto) Regiment, RCA&#x27; on June 3, 1935; &#x27;7th (Reserve) (Toronto) Regiment, RCA&#x27; on November 7, 1940; and &#x27;7th (Reserve) (Toronto) Group, RCA (CA)&#x27; on October 1, 1942; converted and redesignated &#x27;Royal Canadian Artillery, 2nd Division&#x27; on April 1, 1946; and &#x27;Royal Canadian Artillery, 2nd Armoured Division&#x27; on June 19, 1947. The formation was disbanded on October 1, 1954.

===World War II===

In World War II, 9 battery fired both 25 pdrs and 105mm SP, with 3rd Field Bde, 11th Army Field Regt, 1st Canadian Corps Artillery, both in Italy, where at one time they were part of the 8th Army, the &quot;Desert Rats&quot;, and later in Northwest Europe as part of the 1st Canadian Army Artillery. 15 battery became part of the 7th Anti-Tank Regt and saw action with 2, 6, and 17 pdrs and the M-10 SP 3 in. 23 battery served with both 1st and 5th Med Regts firing 6in. how. And 5.5 gun while 25 battery with similar weapons served with 18th Fd Regt and 2nd Med Regt, 1st AGRA. Both 30 and 53 batteries became LAA batteries with 40mm Bofors, one with 6 LAA Regt, 2nd Corps Artillery and the other with 4th Fd Regt, 3rd LAA Regt, 2 Div and 11th LAA Regt.

Throughout World War II a reserve regiment was maintained in Toronto to recruit and train replacements for the batteries overseas.

===Post World War II-1965===
Following the end of World War II, Headquarters RCA, 2nd Div was set up in Toronto with 29th Fd Regt, 32nd Fd Regt, 42nd Med Regt, 49th HAA Regt, and 69th Survey Regt all located within Toronto. In 1947 reorganization saw the loss of the 49th HAA, the 69th became an Observation Regt while the designation SP was added to the 29th and 32nd Regts. In 1950 the 1st Anti-Aircraft Gun Operations Room was established. The next reorganization in 1954 saw the loss of the 32nd Fd and the 1st AAOR. The 69th became the 1st Locating Regt with 134 Svy &amp; Rad battery and 208 Loc battery.

In May 1951, the 27th Canadian Infantry Brigade Group was raised to become Canada&#x27;s contribution to the NATO forces stationed in Europe. As part of that the 209th Fd battery was formed from members of 9 battery and conducting its initial training in Toronto before joining the 79th Fd Regt, which sailed along with rest of the Bde to Germany in December of that year. Subsequently, the 79th Fd Regt was renamed the 3rd Regt RCHA and 209th battery became G battery. 3 RCHA served in Korea from May to November 1954.

The 7th Toronto Regiment RCA made its reappearance in 1965 when, as a result of the Suttie Commission the 29th Fd, 42nd Med and the 1st Loc Regts were transferred to the supplementary Order of Battle. 9th, 15th and 130th batteries from 29th Field Regiment were transferred to 7th Toronto Regiment, which moved into its present location in Moss Park Armoury following the demise of the University Avenue Armoury.

7th Toronto is currently the only Canadian Forces artillery Reserve regiment to maintain a howitzer battery alongside a dedicated dismounted mortar battery (the latter having the unofficial cognomen of &quot;Lightfighter battery&quot;). The third battery, 130, is a training battery, largely for troops who are as-yet unqualified to take positions related to their trade within the regiment.

The 7th Toronto Regiment is affiliated to the 105 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps based in Streetsville.

===War in Afghanistan and other operational deployments===
Members of the regiment volunteered for service in Afghanistan throughout the entirety of the conflict. Utilized as gun-crew, recce/CP/OP technicians, or command staff, the regiment consistently demonstrated the eagerness of its members to be deployed in operational roles as often as they could alongside their regular-force counterparts.

7th Toronto Regiment was also able to send personnel to assist in humanitarian efforts in both the Philippines and Nepal during recent crises in those area.

In addition to overseas deployments, the regiment has contributed proportionately large numbers of personnel to domestic operations. The most recent of these has been Op CADENCE in 2010 as part of the G8 and G20 Summits in Toronto, and Op PROVISION in accordance with the Canadian government&#x27;s accommodation of Syrian refugees. As well as members sent on Op LASER, a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>The Baltimore Light RailLink network consists of a main north-south line that serves 28 of the system&#x27;s 33 stops; a spur in Baltimore city that connects a single stop (Penn Station) to the main line; and two branches at the south end of the line that serve two stops apiece. Because of the track arrangement, trains can enter the Penn Station spur only from the mainline heading north and leave it heading south; there are still single-track sections north of Fairgrounds, limiting headways in that section to 15 minutes.

<text>Ricardo Andrade Quaresma Bernardo (; born 26 September 1983) is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a winger.

He began his career at Sporting CP and went on to play for Barcelona, Inter Milan, Porto (twice), Chelsea, Beşiktaş (twice), Al-Ahli Dubai, Kasımpaşa and Vitória de Guimarães. Regarded as a mercurial talent, his tricks, including the &quot;rabona&quot; and &quot;trivela&quot; (a bending shot with the outside of his right foot) made him a popular figure among fans around the world.

A Portugal international for 15 years, Quaresma won 80 caps and played at three European Championships, including the victorious Euro 2016, and the 2018 World Cup.

==Club career==
===Sporting CP===
Quaresma was born in Lisbon. A trainee at Sporting CP&#x27;s famed academy, the 17-year-old was promoted to the first team by manager László Bölöni before the start of the 2001–02 season, playing 28 Primeira Liga matches and scoring three goals as the team won the double.

Under the same coach, Quaresma scored five times in the league the following campaign, but the team could only finish in third place.

===Barcelona===
In 2003, Quaresma was sold to Barcelona for a reported €6 million fee and the loan of Fábio Rochemback. In his first year in La Liga he made ten starts and 12 substitute appearances, scoring in the 5–0 home rout of Albacete.

Quaresma injured his right foot in the final weeks of the season, forcing him to miss both the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship and UEFA Euro 2004 tournaments. Shortly after, he announced his refusal to play for the Spanish club as long as manager Frank Rijkaard was in charge.

===Porto===
Quaresma signed for Porto in the summer of 2004 as Deco moved in the opposite direction for a fee of €15 million plus Quaresma, valued at €6 million. He started the campaign on a high note by scoring the only goal in a win against Benfica in the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira, and also scored in the 2–1 loss to Valencia in the UEFA Super Cup.

Quaresma scored five goals in his first year at the Estádio do Dragão, and the club finished as runners-up. In the penalty shootout defeat of Once Caldas in the Intercontinental Cup, he successfully converted his attempt in an 8–7 victory in Yokohama.

===Inter Milan===

On 1 September 2008, Quaresma signed for Italian champions Inter Milan in a cash/player exchange fee of €18.6 million, with youngster Pelé joining Porto. He scored in his first Serie A match against Catania, with one of his trademark &quot;trivelas&quot; in a 2–1 home win. However, he found opportunities in the starting XI limited, as coach José Mourinho stated: &quot;He is a great talent, but the joy I have at seeing the way Ibra works for and with the team I do not yet have with Quaresma. He will have to learn, otherwise he won&#x27;t play, and I am sure he&#x27;ll change and become more tactically disciplined. He likes kicking the ball with the outside of his foot, but if you ask me about him in a few months&#x27; time, we&#x27;ll be talking about a different Quaresma.&quot;

At the end of the season, Quaresma was given the Bidone d&#x27;oro award for the worst footballer in the Italian top division. On 2 February 2009, transfer deadline day, he signed on loan for Premier League club Chelsea until 30 June, making his first appearance five days later in a 0–0 home draw with Hull City. On 7 March, he provided the cross for Alex to score against Coventry City in the sixth round of the FA Cup. After a disappointing start at the San Siro, he said his move had restored his confidence, and he further stated &quot;When I was at Inter, I wasn&#x27;t feeling very confident. I wasn&#x27;t playing well and wasn&#x27;t happy, I already feel more confident here at Chelsea. It has brought the joy back for me, which I didn&#x27;t have at Inter.&quot;

Having returned to Inter despite attempts made by the club to offload him, Quaresma inherited the number 7 shirt following the retirement of his compatriot Luís Figo. However, after the arrival of Goran Pandev he did not feature much in Mourinho&#x27;s plans as the team went on to win the treble, making 11 appearances in the league without scoring.

===Beşiktaş===

On 13 June 2010, Quaresma joined Beşiktaş of the Turkish Süper Lig, who paid €7.3 million for his services and signed him to a three-year contract, which entitled him to €3.5 million in the first season and €3.75 million in the next two. He scored his first goal for them against Viktoria Plzeň in the UEFA Europa League&#x27;s third qualifying round, and was also an integral part of their victorious run in the Turkish Cup, opening the scoring in the 33rd minute of the final against İstanbul Başakşehir and being named player of the match after the 4–3 win on penalties.

On 25 April 2011, Quaresma and teammate Nihat Kahveci had a spat on the pitch – the latter was upset at the former for failing to pass the ball, but the altercation was eventually broken up by teammates. Following the 3–1 defeat to Atlético Madrid in the first leg of the Europa League&#x27;s round of 16 the following 8 March, he had an altercation with Carlos Carvalhal in the dressing room at half-time after the manager replaced him with İsmail Köybaşı, reportedly beginning to throw water bottles before saying, &quot;I brought you here, you just think of yourself. If I was not here, [Carvalhal] would not be here. You can not remove me from the match because you&#x27;re nothing.&quot; He was suspended indefinitely by the club following the incident, and released on 20 December six months before his contract was due to expire, being paid the remaining €1.48 million.

===Al Ahli===
On 8 January 2013, Quaresma signed with Al Ahli in the UAE Pro League. He scored two league goals from ten games in his only season, adding another in his sole appearance in a victorious campaign in the UAE President&#x27;s Cup.

In May 2013, the 29-year-old Quaresma was released.

===Return to Porto===
Quaresma returned to Porto on 1 January 2014, where over 10,000 fans greeted him in training. He scored in his first European match of his second spell against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League&#x27;s round of 32 on 20 February (2–2 home draw), and then set up a goal and scored in a 2–2 draw with Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo. In the quarter-finals of the same competition, he scored a consolation goal in the 4–1 away loss to Sevilla.

On 15 April 2015, Quaresma scored twice in the first ten minutes, starting with a penalty, as Porto defeated Bayern Munich 3–1 in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League&#x27;s quarter-final tie.

===Beşiktaş return===
Quaresma returned to Beşiktaş in July 2015, being greeted by a crowd of thousands at Istanbul Atatürk Airport. He stated his aim was to win the league with the team, which was eventually achieved and retained the following season.

On 26 February 2018, Quaresma scored a trademark &quot;trivela&quot; goal against Fenerbahçe in the Istanbul derby when he bent the ball around Mauricio Isla into the top corner of the net with the outside of his right foot, the first of his two goals in a 3–1 win.

===Later career===
The 35-year-old Quaresma continued to ply his trade in the Turkish top division on 29 August 2019, when the free agent signed with Kasımpaşa for one season. In July 2020, he left.

On 7 September 2020, Quaresma agreed to a two-year deal with Vitória de Guimarães. He scored four times in his first year, adding six assists in a seventh-place finish.

Quaresma was less played by new manager Pepa in the 2021–22 campaign. In May, he confirmed he was leaving the Estádio D. Afonso Henriques.

==International career==
A UEFA European Under-16 Championship winner with Portugal in 2000, Quaresma made his debut for the full side on 10 June 2003, in a friendly against Bolivia. Poor form during his time with Barcelona and an injury prevented him from taking part in the Under-21 Championships, Euro 2004 and the 2004 Summer Olympics. He was selected for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, and he featured in the vital 2–0 victory over Slovakia, but was omitted by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari from the final squad.
In February 2007, Quaresma appeared in a friendly against Brazil at the Emirates Stadium, providing an assist in the 2–0 win and being named man of the match. On 24 March, he scored his first goal for the national team in their 4–0 defeat of Belgium in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers, held in his home town. Picked for the finals in Austria and Switzerland, he replaced Simão Sabrosa for the last ten minutes of the second group match against the Czech Republic, scoring in stoppage time to contribute to a 3–1 win. He started the next match, a 0–2 loss to hosts Switzerland, when nine of the 11 regular starters were rested.

In August 2010, after nearly two years of absence, Quaresma was called up for two Euro 2012 qualifiers against Cyprus and Norway to be held the next month, replacing the injured Cristiano Ronaldo. He played the full 90 minutes in the first match, a 4–4 home draw.
After failing to receive any playing time at the Euro 2012 tournament, and being involved in a training incident with teammate Miguel Lopes, Quaresma was named in Portugal&#x27;s provisional 30-man squad for the 2014 World Cup, but did not make the final cut. Coach Paulo Bento said regarding the matter, &quot;I have to accept that people will question my decisions. Nani has difference [&quot;sic&quot;] characteristics to Quaresma.&quot;

Quaresma scored a penalty, his first international goal in over six years, in a friendly with France on 11 October 2014, but in a 2–1 loss. He was then picked for Euro 2016, where he scored the match&#x27;s only goal – in the 117th minute – in a last-16 win over Croatia. Five days later, in the quarter-final against Poland, he scored the winning spot-kick in a penalty shootout following a 1–1 draw after extra time. In the final against hosts France on 10 July, he came off the bench for Ronaldo, who was forced off in the opening 25 minutes due to injury; the match ended in a 1–0 extra-time victory to Portugal, which saw the country win its first ever international title.
Quaresma was chosen for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. He scored the opening goal of Portugal&#x27;s 2–2 draw with Mexico in the group stage, and helped his team to an eventual third-place finish.

Fifteen years after his first cap, Quaresma was selected for a World Cup squad for the first time, the 2018 tournament which also took place in Russia. In Portugal&#x27;s third group match, against Iran, he scored a goal-of-the-tournament contender, playing a one-two with Adrien Silva on the right side of the field before striking the ball with the outside of his right foot—a trademark &quot;trivela&quot;—into the top left corner of the goal in a 1–1 draw that took his team into the last 16.

==Style of play and temperament==
Once described as &quot;a mercurial, enigmatic talent&quot;, Quaresma was known for his flair and was popular for incorporating a repertoire of tricks into his style of play, including the &quot;rabona&quot; and &quot;trivela&quot;, the latter a bending shot with the outside of his right foot. A winger who could play on either flank, his crossing ability, creativity, dribbling skills, technique and poise on the ball, combined with his qualities of speed and finesse caused a regular problem for opposing defences, and also allowed him to create space for his teammates.

Although he was regarded in the media as a highly promising player in his youth, his career was marked by inconsistency; moreover, his work-rate, mentality, tactical discipline and attitude were often brought into question by his managers and the media. He was also accused by certain pundits of being selfish, due to his individualistic playing style and tendency to hold on to possession excessively.

In 2017, Marco Monteiro of &quot;FIFA.com&quot; described Quaresma as &quot;insanely talented and equally temperamental.&quot; He was able to improve upon this weakness as his career progressed, with the BBC noting ahead of the 2014 World Cup that &quot;his workrate has been exemplary since returning home,&quot; while Jonathan Liew of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commented during Euro 2016: &quot;So it is that a player whose career was widely believed to be over now has the whole country in his hands. The veteran Quaresma is a more mature player these days, creative but reliable, unpredictable but disciplined, a man who will never undo the past but is at least showing signs of learning.&quot;

==Personal life==

Quaresma is of partial Romani descent, earning him the nickname &quot;O Cigano&quot; (&quot;The Gypsy&quot;). Speaking of an alleged racial slur towards him by an opponent in 2014, he said, &quot;When I hear people say there is no racism nowadays it makes me laugh. When something happens in Portugal it&#x27;s always fault of gypsies, blacks, immigrants. It&#x27;s tough to live with this.&quot; In May 2020, he spoke out against the anti-Romani rhetoric of the politician André Ventura.

Quaresma was erroneously quoted by media outlets as being the great-nephew of former Portugal internationals Alfredo Quaresma and Artur Quaresma but later denied this, nonetheless citing them as &quot;an inspiration&quot;. He was a distant cousin of fellow footballer Eduardo Quaresma.

Quaresma is known for his tattoos. In 2016, he had two teardrops inked onto his face. Later that year, he had Psalm 91:4 tattooed on the back of his head.

Quaresma had two sons with his partner, and a daughter from a previous relationship. A convert to Catholicism, he was baptised in July 2016 together with his sons in Pêro Pinheiro, Sintra, with teammates Eliseu and Carlos Martins being present at the event.

==Media==
Quaresma featured in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series. He was one of 39 players to earn a five-star skill rating on &quot;FIFA 18&quot;.

Sponsored by the sportswear and equipment supplier Nike, Quaresma worn Nike Mercurial Superfly VI Elite football boots.

<text>Willi Dansgaard (30 August 1922 – 8 January 2011) was a Danish paleoclimatologist. He was Professor Emeritus of Geophysics at the University of Copenhagen and a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Science and Letters, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Icelandic Academy of Sciences, and the Danish Geophysical Society.

==Early life and career==
Dansgaard grew up in Copenhagen, to parents who owned an engraving shop. In 1947, he graduated from the University of Copenhagen, winning a gold medal for his thesis on X-ray dosimetry.

After several years of research, including some at sites in Greenland, Dansgaard returned to the University of Copenhagen&#x27;s Biophysics Laboratory, where he developed its mass spectrometer to analyse water isotopes. According to his student Jørgen Peder Steffensen:
In June 1952, Dansgaard made a discovery that came to influence the rest of his scientific career. He discovered that it was possible to determine the temperature of the precipitating clouds by analysing the stable isotopic composition of rain water. In the following 12 years, he systematically collected water samples from all over the world in collaboration with the Danish East Asia Company, contacts in Greenland, a French expedition under Paul Emile Victor and later the International Atomic Energy Agency and World Meteorological Organization.

== Overview ==

Dansgaard was the first paleoclimatologist to demonstrate that measurements of the trace isotopes oxygen-18 and deuterium in accumulated glacier ice could be used as an indicator of past climate. Dansgaard was the first to note deuterium excess, or a water sample&#x27;s deviation from the global meteoric water line (GMWL) in ice cores. He found that the kinetic differences between hydrogen-1 and deuterium related to the temperature of source water, and the absolute humidity. 

He was the first scientist to extract palaeoclimatic information from the American Camp Century ice core from Greenland drilled by the US army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL). Dansgaard also took a leading role in the drilling of the first ice core to bedrock for scientific reasons, the DYE-3 core from South Greenland, from the Camp Century. Confirming findings from the analysis of the Camp Century ice core, the DYE-3 climate profile documented the existence of rapid climate change, during and at the end of the last glacial. The repeated events of abrupt climate change during the glacial are named after Willi Dansgaard and his Swiss colleague, Hans Oeschger, and are known as Dansgaard–Oeschger events.

<text>In antenna design theory, the phase center is the point from which the electromagnetic radiation spreads spherically outward, with the phase of the signal being equal at any point on the sphere. Apparent phase center is used to describe the phase center in a limited section of the radiation pattern.
If it is used in the context of an antenna array, one has to define a reference point from which the basevectors of the single elements are referred to. The phase center may vary, depended on the beamforming algorithm. It produces the weight vector, that may vary over time depending on the geometrical setup as well as the receive conditions.

<text>Hans Oeschger (2 April 1927, Ottenbach – 25 December 1998, Bern) was a Swiss climatologist. He founded the Division of Climate and Environmental Physics at the Physics Institute of the University of Bern in 1963 and served as its director until his retirement in 1992.

Oeschger was the first to date the &quot;age&quot; of Pacific deep water. The Oeschger counter, developed by his team, was a leading instrument for measuring the activity of naturally occurring radioisotopes (, , , , , , ).

He was a pioneer in ice core research, and in collaboration with his colleagues, he was the first to measure the glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric . Their 1979 study demonstrated that atmospheric levels during the glacial period were nearly 50% lower than today.

Along with Chester C. Langway and Willi Dansgaard, Oeschger documented a series of abrupt climate changes in the Greenland ice cores, now known as Dansgaard–Oeschger events.

Oeschger expressed concerns about the potential increase in the greenhouse effect due to rising levels. He said: “The worst for me would be, if there were serious changes in the next 5 to 10 years and we scientists are helpless and did not have the courage to point at these dangerous developments early.”

He was a lead author of the First Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The European Geophysical Society established the Hans Oeschger Medal in his honour in 2001.

The centre of excellence for climate research at the University of Bern (&quot;Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research&quot;), which was founded in 2007, is named after Hans Oeschger, as is Oeschger Bluff, a cliff in Antarctica.

<doc id="800723" wikidata="Q5061376" url="?curid=800723" title="Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd">
<text>Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [1947] KB 130, commonly called High Trees, is a leading opinion in the High Court relating to contract law. It reaffirmed and extended the doctrine of promissory estoppel in the contract law of England and Wales. However, the most significant part of the judgment is &quot;obiter dictum&quot; as it relates to hypothetical facts; that is, the landlord did &quot;not&quot; seek repayment of the full wartime rent.

Denning J held estoppel to be applicable if

==Facts==
High Trees House Ltd leased a block of flats in Battersea, London from Central London Property Trust Ltd. The agreement was made in 1937 and specified an annual ground rent of £2,500. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 led to a downturn in the rental market. High Trees struggled to find tenants for the property and approached Central London Property Trust in January 1940 to request that the rent be lowered. A reduction to £1,250 per year was agreed in writing, though the duration was not specified and no consideration was provided.

By 1945, the building was returning to full occupancy. On 21 September 1945, Central London Property wrote to High Trees to request a return to the full rent of £2,500 and claiming arrears of £7,916 for the period since 1940. They then brought a test action to recover part of the debt for the two quarters which had elapsed since June 1945.

==Judgment==
Based on previous judgments as &quot;Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co&quot;, Denning J held that the full rent was payable from the time that the flats became fully occupied in mid-1945. However, he continued in an &quot;obiter&quot; statement that if Central London had tried to claim for the full rent from 1940 onwards, they would not have been able to. This was reasoned on the basis that if a party leads another party to believe that he will not enforce his strict legal rights, then the courts will prevent him from doing so at a later stage. Being &quot;obiter dicta&quot; and in a court of first instance this was doubly not a binding precedent, yet it essentially created the doctrine of promissory estoppel.

==Significance==
Advances have been made in promissory estoppel since its inception in &quot;High Trees&quot; to create a new inroad into the rule in &quot;Pinnel&#x27;s case&quot; that an agreement to accept part payment of a debt in full satisfaction of it is unenforceable for want of consideration. Denning commented that such an agreement should now be enforceable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and indeed the plaintiff did not seek the full debt on the basis of what was fair and, perhaps, thought was the law. However, the courts were at first reluctant to overrule or distinguish cases like &quot;Pinnel&#x27;s case&quot; and &quot;Foakes v Beer&quot; having formed part of the common law for so long. Lady Justice Arden in &quot;Collier v P &amp; MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd&quot; (2007) accepted in principle that &quot;High Trees&quot; could be used to extinguish a creditor&#x27;s right to full payment of a debt in such circumstances.

In &quot;Amalgamated Investment Co v Texas Bank&quot; it was decided that proprietary estoppel can act as a sword and not merely as a shield (that is, it can be used as a cause of action rather than merely providing a defence to an action).

<text>The Unity Party (in French, &quot;Parti unité&quot;) was a political party in Quebec, Canada.

The party was formed as a reaction to then-Premier Robert Bourassa invoking the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian constitution to override a Supreme Court ruling overturning parts of the Charter of the French Language (commonly known as &quot;Bill 101&quot;).

The party platform called for equality of both languages (French and English) in Quebec, opposing Bill 101 which made French the sole official language of Quebec and imposed restrictions on the use of English on public signs. The Unity Party drew virtually all of its support from elements of Quebec&#x27;s anglophone minority, and only ran candidates in electoral districts with very high anglophone populations outside the Montreal Island and Laval, while its twin party, the Equality Party, ran candidates exclusively on the Montreal Island and Laval. The Equality Party won four seats in the National Assembly in the 1989 general election.

The Unity Party merged with the Equality Party in September 1990.

<text>The Commitments (1987) (originally to be called &quot;The Partitions&quot;) is a novel by Irish writer Roddy Doyle. The first episode in &quot;The Barrytown Trilogy&quot;, it is about a group of unemployed young people in the north side of Dublin, Ireland, who start a soul band.

==Background==
Doyle wrote the novel while working as a teacher in Kilbarrack, Dublin. Although it is his publishing debut it was not the first novel he wrote, and he had written for the stage, his play Brownbread being produced by Passion Machine, a theatre company with a special interest in working-class Dublin stories, in 1987. It was directed by Paul Mercier.

Encouraged by positive feedback for the script of &quot;Brownbread&quot; in Dublin and following numerous rejections he self-published &quot;The Commitments&quot;, creating the King Farouk press (King Farouk is Dublin rhyming slang for a book, book being pronounced &quot;buke&quot; in Dublin) with Passion Machine producer John Sutton. Following a successful local run of 2,000 books which sold out in six months, the novel was picked up by William Heinemann to be published in the UK. An endorsement from Elvis Costello brought the book to wider attention.

==Plot summary==
Two friends — Derek Scully and &quot;Outspan&quot; Foster — get together to form a band, but soon realise that they don&#x27;t know enough about the music business to get much further than their small neighbourhood in the Northside of Dublin. To solve this problem, they recruit a friend they&#x27;d had from school, Jimmy Rabbitte, to be their manager. He accepts graciously, but only if he can make fundamental changes to the group, the first being the sacking of the third, and mutually disliked, member — their synth player. After this, Rabbitte gets rid of their name, making them &quot;The Commitments&quot; (stating &quot;All the good 60s bands started with a &#x27;the&#x27;&quot;) and, most importantly, forming them from another synthpop group into the face of what he thinks will be the Dublin-Soul revolution (&quot;Yes, Lads. You&#x27;ll be playing Dublin Soul!&quot;).

He witnesses a young man singing drunkenly into a microphone at a friend&#x27;s wedding and is struck by the fact he is singing &quot;something approximating music&quot;. Jimmy places an ad in the local paper reading &quot;Have you got soul? Then Dublin&#x27;s hardest working band is looking for you&quot;. Eventually, he gets together a mismatched group with seemingly no musical talent, led by mysterious stranger Joey &quot;The Lips&quot; Fagan, who claims to have played trumpet with Joe Tex and the Four Tops. They quickly start learning how to play their instruments and perform a number of local gigs.

With music fanatic Jimmy Rabbite as their manager, the Commitments seek to fulfil their goal of bringing soul to Dublin. In the beginning, Jimmy includes all of the country Ireland, but later realises that the culchies have everything whereas the Dubliners are the working-class and have nothing. Bringing soul music to Ireland is then reduced merely to the city.

Tensions run high between the band members, not helped by the jealousy and animosity Joey receives from other male members due to the attention he receives from the female backing singers. The band slowly becomes more and more musically competent and draws bigger and more enthusiastic audiences. But the band falls apart after a gig when Joey is seen kissing Imelda and a fight ensues — all while Jimmy is negotiating to record the band&#x27;s first single with an independent label.

Fagan soon goes to America after Imelda tells him she is pregnant (it turns out she was actually lying, only saying this for the attention). In the end, Jimmy, along with the band&#x27;s other founding members and Mickah, form The Brassers, an Irish hybrid of punk and country. They plan on inviting James into the band after he&#x27;s finished his medical degree, and they discuss getting the ladies involved as well.

== Themes ==
With &quot;The Commitments&quot;, Doyle intentionally focused on a contemporary Dublin setting as he felt this part of Irish life was not given due attention, especially compared to stories with a rural setting or those involving The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Doyle pointedly makes a comparison between the experience of being a Northside Dubliner and the experience of being African American. The line &quot;the Irish are the blacks of Europe&quot; is one of the most famous in the book, and has been described as &quot;the equivalent for the Celtic Tiger of de Valera&#x27;s homage to comely maidens speech in the 1940s&quot;. Doyle&#x27;s attempt to make a link between black and Irish experiences would be a popular trope in Irish literature in this period in works such as Brian Friel&#x27;s &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; and Seamus Heaney&#x27;s &quot;The Cure at Troy&quot;. While the Dunnes Stores strike (where Dublin workers refused to handle fruit from South Africa in protest at apartheid) is not mentioned directly, it is alluded to as Outspan&#x27;s nickname (a common nickname at the time for redheads) was a reference to the South African orange brand Outspan.

Poverty and the lack of opportunities for working-class Dubliners are addressed in the book, often indirectly. It is alluded to on a number of occasions that most of the band left school after the Inter Cert (at 16) rather than taking the Leaving Cert which would have been necessary to apply for university.

==Personnel==
* Declan &quot;Deco&quot; Cuffe – lead vocals
* Natalie Murphy – vocals
* Imelda Quirke – vocals
* Bernie McGloughin – vocals
* Liam &quot;Outspan&quot; Foster – guitars

* Mickah Wallace – drums (second drummer)

== Reception ==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote: &quot;Brash, human, smoothly executed, and seemingly authentic, full of youth, energy, and good humor, this is a quintessential garage-band romance—and a fine and promising debut&quot;.

The film, book, and soundtrack were all hugely popular in the 90s, and a group containing some of the film&#x27;s actors still tours. There are some differences between the book and film, the most obvious being that the novel was composed mostly of dialogue, with hardly any physical description; the movie concentrated much more on the collapse of Dublin&#x27;s inner city. Unlike the film, which could be categorized as comedy drama, the book was almost entirely comedic.

== Adaptations ==
===Film===
&quot;The Commitments&quot; is a 1991 comedy-drama film directed by Alan Parker with a screenplay adapted by Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais, and Doyle himself. &quot;The Commitments&quot; was an international co-production between companies in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It was filmed on location in Dublin.

===Stage production===
A musical stage production of the novel, also titled &quot;The Commitments&quot;, played in London&#x27;s West End at the Palace Theatre from 2013 to 2015.

Following the 1991 film adaptation, Doyle said he received 20 different offers to turn the novel into a musical. He turned them all down because he had become resentful of the success of &quot;The Commitments&quot;, to the seeming exclusion of his other novels; and because he was not a fan of musical theatre, having never seen a musical. He eventually changed his mind because of his children, who were fans of the 1991 film, and who took him to see musicals, including a production of the film-turned-musical &quot;The Producers&quot;, which he called &quot;a revelation&quot;.

Despite initially looking to hire another writer to write the book for the musical, Doyle ended up writing the show himself. The show was directed by Jamie Lloyd, with choreography by Ann Yee, set design by Soutra Gilmour, sound design by Rory Madden and lighting by Jon Clark.

<text>Craw were an American independent band from Cleveland, Ohio. They belonged to the harder-edged branch of the math rock or post hardcore movement, in the same category as bands such as Colossamite, Keelhaul, Zeni Geva, Dazzling Killmen and Ruins.

== History ==
Craw were an underground band from Cleveland, Ohio, initially active from 1988 through 2002. From 1993 through 2002, Craw released four full-length albums.

Formed at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, the group originally consisted of David McClelland and Rockie Brockway on guitars, and Chris Apanius on bass. Vocalist Joe McTighe and drummer Lori Davis joined soon after, and in 1990, that lineup recorded a self-titled demo. In the fall of 1990, Lori Davis left the group and was replaced by Neil Chastain. The new lineup recorded a second demo, &quot;Celephais&quot;, as well as several singles and the band&#x27;s first, self-titled album. Apanius and Chastain left the group in 1994 and 1995, respectively, and were replaced by Zak Dieringer and Will Scharf.

Craw amassed a local following in the early &#x27;90s, often performing at Cleveland&#x27;s Euclid Tavern, and during the mid-to-late &#x27;90s, they toured North America frequently, sharing bills with bands such as The Jesus Lizard, Melvins, and Neurosis.

The group&#x27;s first three full length recordings—1993&#x27;s &quot;craw&quot;, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Lost Nation Road&quot; and 1997&#x27;s &quot;Map, Monitor, Surge&quot;—were recorded with the help of Steve Albini. The last release, entitled &quot;Bodies for Strontium 90&quot;, was engineered by Bill Korecky at Mars Studios, and is available on the indie label Hydra Head Records.

In late 2015, Northern Spy Records reissued craw&#x27;s first three albums as a limited-edition vinyl box set. The band reunited for two concerts in March 2016. All seven members that appeared on craw&#x27;s four studio albums performed at these shows.

== Musical style ==
Craw&#x27;s music features tight, rhythmically complex riffs; vocals that range from a faint whine to an explosive shriek; a broad dynamic range; atmospheric guitar textures; epic song structures; and esoteric lyrical themes. The band incorporates elements of post-hardcore, metal, math rock, progressive rock and experimental improv that does not fit comfortably into any one genre.

== Comments from other musicians ==
Several artists have expressed their admiration for Craw, including Aaron Turner of Isis, Mike Hill of Tombs, Steve Albini, and Doug Moore of Pyrrhon. Commenting on their eclectic style, Albini said: &quot;They never imitate. Other bands imitate them.&quot;

<text>Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha is a novel by Irish writer Roddy Doyle, first published in 1993 by Secker and Warburg. It won the Booker Prize that year. The story is about a 10-year-old boy living in Barrytown, North Dublin, and the events that happen within his age group, school and home in around 1968.

==Plot synopsis==
&quot;Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha&quot; recounts (approximately) one year in the life of a Dublin ten-year-old, Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Clarke, especially his relationships with Sinbad (Francis), his younger brother, his parents and his schoolmates and teachers. It begins with him being a mischievous boy roaming around local Barrytown and ends with his father departing from the family, forcing the boy to take up adult responsibilities in his single-parent home.

==Structure and language==
The novel, chronicling Paddy&#x27;s internal journey towards maturity, is a &quot;bildungsroman&quot;, as it centres upon the main character&#x27;s development. Paddy&#x27;s growing up is painfully bitter. While the beginning of the book is filled with playful antics, the growing antagonism between his parents and the breaking up of their marriage are evident as the novel moves on. Paddy does not choose his &quot;journey of enlightenment and maturity&quot;; rather, he is robbed of it when his parents become estranged from one another.

The novel is not divided into chapters, but into numerous vignettes that do not follow any chronological order. Despite the absence of a clear-cut plot (introduction, complication, climax, dénouement) the reader is still able to sense the passage of time both in Paddy&#x27;s own life and in the changes that come to Barrytown.

Doyle&#x27;s language employs a register that gives the reader the vivid impression of listening to a ten-year-old Irish boy from the 1960s.

==Critical reaction==
&quot;The Independent&quot; praised it as &quot;one of the truest and funniest presentations of juvenile experience in any recent literature&quot;.

When it won the Booker Prize, the book was mocked by some people as an &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;populist&quot; choice.

<text>Every June the town of Lanark in Scotland celebrates Lanimer Week. The festivities reach a high point on the Thursday of Lanimer Week which is the gala day, when the town&#x27;s schoolchildren parade in fancy dress with decorated vehicles, pipe bands, and a Lanimer Queen and her Court, who have been selected from local schools.

The Lanimer celebrations are based on King David I (r. 1124–1153) granting Lanark the status of Royal Burgh during his reign. A condition of the charter stated that the merchants of the town must inspect their March or boundary stones each year. This duty has been carried out every year since then, and the Land Marches became transformed over time into the annual celebrations.

==Events in Lanimers Week==
Lanimers Week begins on Sunday when the Lord Cornet Elect is led from the town&#x27;s Memorial Hall to Saint Nicholas&#x27; Parish Church for the Kirkin&#x27; of the Lord Cornet Elect Service. On the Monday evening, crowds turn out for the Perambulation of the Marches, when officials and members of the public walk the boundaries. A Scottish country dance display takes place at Lanark Cross, followed by the Sashing of the Lord Cornet and the Shifting of the Burgh Standard. The evening ends with the Lord Cornet&#x27;s Reception. An official ride-out around the town takes place on Tuesday night, followed by the presentation of the New Lanark Loving Cup to the Lanimer Queen Elect at New Lanark. The Lanimer Queen&#x27;s Reception is held on the Friday evening in the Memorial Hall. Saturday sees the Ball at Lanark Market when the Lord Cornet escorts the Lanimer Queen.

This is not to be confused with Landemer which is a similar festivity held in the nearby town of Rutherglen, also in South Lanarkshire. Landemer is normally held the first Saturday in June.

==Lanimer Day==
The Lanark Gala Day is held on the Thursday between 6 and 12 June, barring a June election or a pandemic. Schoolchildren and others parade through the town in costumes accompanied decorated lorries. This is known as the Lanimer Queen&#x27;s Procession. They each receive a Lanimer medal for participating. With the children march brass and pipe bands, Lord Cornet and Ex- Lord Cornet support, and visiting dignitaries. The court ride in cars after the parade, and the Queen has an open-top coach.

Once the procession has gone once around the town centre, the children mount a stand in front of St Nicholas Church (and a statue of William Wallace on the steeple). The court also climb the stand and the Queen is crowned by a local lady, to acclaim from the assembled crowds. &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; and &quot;Scots Wha Hae&quot; are played, and the Lanimer Queen&#x27;s Proclamation read out, followed by &quot;God Save the King&quot;, the British national anthem.

Later in the afternoon, the Lord Cornet has another procession on horseback. Various entertainments for children and adults are laid on at Castlebank Park, and musical entertainment takes place at the cross in the evening. Finally, children perform at the Lanimer Queen&#x27;s Reception on the Friday night.

<text>The Saalach is a river in Austria and Germany, and a left tributary of the Salzach.

== Course ==
The river begins, as the stream, in the Austrian state of Tyrol in the Kitzbühel Alps at the lake below the high Gamshag. From there it flows initially eastwards through the valley, through Hinterglemm, then the ski resort of Saalbach – from that point it is known as the &quot;Saalach&quot; – until it bends north at Maishofen. It follows the broad valley to Saalfelden, and meanders further on through the narrow valley between the Leoganger and Loferer Steinberge and the Steinernes Meer to Lofer in north-western direction. There it enters a narrow gorge, famous for its white water rafting. Crossing the border to Bavaria (Germany) at Melleck (part of Schneizlreuth) it flows along the northern slopes of the Reiter Alpe known for its climbing routes. A short distance before Bad Reichenhall, a dam of a hydro-electrical power plant collects the waters of the . The power plant provides the energy for the railway line Salzburg, Freilassing, Bad Reichenhall to Berchtesgaden. Having passed Staufeneck, the Saalach leaves the mountains and enters the flat forests called Saalachau. From Piding on north-eastwards, the Austria–Germany border follows the river for some to Freilassing, at which it merges with the river Salzach.

The name has its origin from , an old form of (salt), and which denotes a small river.

<doc id="800801" wikidata="Q379672" url="?curid=800801" title="Diego de Landa">
<text>Diego de Landa Calderón, [[Order of Friars Minor|O.F.M.]] (12 November 1524 – 29 April 1579) was a Spanish Franciscan bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatán. He led a campaign against idolatry and human sacrifice. In doing so, he burned Maya manuscripts (codices) which contained knowledge of Maya religion and civilization, and the history of the American continent. Nonetheless, his work in documenting and researching the Maya was indispensable in achieving the current understanding of their culture, to the degree that Mayanist William Gates asserted that &quot;ninety-nine percent of what we today know of the Mayas, we know as the result either of what Landa has told us in the pages that follow, or have learned in the use and study of what he told&quot;. He also described that &quot;it is an equally safe statement that...he burned ninety-nine times as much knowledge of Maya history and sciences as he has given us&quot;.

==Conversion of Maya==
Born in Cifuentes, Guadalajara, Spain, he became a Franciscan friar in 1541, and was sent as one of the first Franciscans to the Yucatán, arriving in 1549. Landa was in charge of bringing the Roman Catholic faith to the Maya peoples after the Spanish conquest of Yucatán. He presided over a spiritual monopoly granted to the Catholic Franciscan order by the Spanish crown, and he worked diligently to buttress the order&#x27;s power and convert the indigenous Maya. His initial appointment was to the mission of San Antonio in Izamal, which served also as his primary residence while in Yucatán.

He is the author of the &quot;Relación de las cosas de Yucatán&quot; in which he catalogues the Maya religion, Maya language, culture and writing system. The manuscript was written around 1566 on his return to Spain; however, the original copies have long since been lost. The account is known only as an abridgement, which in turn had undergone several iterations by various copyists. The extant version was produced around 1660, lost to scholarship for over two centuries and not rediscovered until the 19th century. In 1862, French cleric Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg published the manuscript in a bilingual French-Spanish edition, &quot;Relation des choses de Yucatán de Diego de Landa&quot;.

==Inquisition==

===Suppression of Maya and destruction of Maya texts===
After hearing of Roman Catholic Maya who continued to practice idol worship, Landa ordered an Inquisition in Mani, ending with a ceremony called &quot;auto de fé&quot;. During the ceremony on July 12, 1562, a disputed number of Maya codices (according to Landa, 27 books) and approximately 5,000 alleged Maya cult images were burned. 
Only three pre-Columbian books of Maya hieroglyphics (also known as a codex) and fragments of a fourth are known to have survived. Collectively, the works are known as the Maya codices.

Landa&#x27;s Inquisition involved the use of physical abuse on certain indigenous Maya. Scores of Maya nobles were jailed pending interrogation, and large numbers of Maya nobles and commoners were subjected to examination under &quot;hoisting&quot;. During hoisting, a victim&#x27;s hands were bound and looped over an extended line that was then raised until the victim&#x27;s entire body was suspended in the air. Often, stone weights were added to the ankles or lashes applied to the back during interrogation. During his later trial for his actions, Landa vehemently denied that any deaths or injuries directly resulted from these procedures.

===Justifications===
Scholars have argued that Mexican inquisitions showed little concern to eradicate magic or convict individuals for heterodox beliefs, and that witchcraft was treated more as a religious problem capable of being resolved by confession and absolution. Perhaps inspired by intolerant fellow Franciscan Cardinal Cisneros from the same Toledo convent, Landa was &quot;monomaniacal in his fervor&quot; against it. Landa believed a huge underground network of apostasies, led by displaced indigenous priests, were jealous of the power the Church enjoyed and sought to reclaim it for themselves. The apostates, Landa surmised, had launched a counteroffensive against the Church, and he believed it was his duty to expose the evil before it could revert the population to their old heathen ways. Landa claimed that he had discovered evidence of human sacrifice and other idolatrous practices while rooting out native idolatry. Although one of the alleged victims of said sacrifices, Mani Encomendero Dasbatés, was later found to be alive, and Landa&#x27;s enemies contested his right to run an inquisition, Landa insisted a papal bull, &quot;Exponi nobis&quot;, justified his actions.

However, Lopez de Cogolludo, Landa&#x27;s chief Franciscan biographer, wrote of Landa&#x27;s firsthand experiences with human sacrifices. When Landa first came to the Yucatán, he made it his mission to walk the breadth of the peninsula and preach to the most remote villages. While passing through Cupules, he came upon a group of 300 about to sacrifice a young boy. Enraged, Landa stormed through the crowd, released the boy, smashed the idols and began preaching with such zeal and sincerity that they begged him to remain in the land and teach them more.

Landa was unique in that he was willing to go into recently conquered, where native resentment of Spaniards was still very intense. Over the course of his journeys, Landa formulated an intimate contact with natives. Natives placed him in such an esteemed position they were willing to show him some of their sacred writings that had been transcribed on deerskin books. To Landa and the other Franciscan friars, the very existence of these Maya codices was proof of diabolical practices. In references to the books, Landa said: 
We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they (the Maya) regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction.The original can be found in section XLI of Landa&#x27;s &quot;Relación de las cosas de Yucatán&quot;. 

Landa&#x27;s insistence of widespread cults throughout the Yucatán is backed by ample evidence. Rituals the Spanish conquerors could not understand were labeled as idolatry, superstition, or even devil worship. Landa, like most other Franciscans, subscribed to millenarian ideas, which demanded the mass conversion of as many souls as possible before the turn of the century. Eliminating evil and pagan practices, Landa believed, would usher the Second Coming of Christ much sooner.

Landa&#x27;s &quot;Relación De Las Cosas De Yucatán&quot; is about as complete a treatment of Maya religion as is ever likely. While controversy surrounds his use of force in the conversion process, few scholars would debate the general accuracy of his recordings. Allen Wells calls his work an &quot;ethnographic masterpiece&quot;, and William J. Folan, Laraine A. Fletcher and Ellen R. Kintz have written that the account of Maya social organization and towns before conquest is a &quot;gem&quot;. The writings are the main contemporary source for Maya history, without which the knowledge of Maya ethnology would be devastatingly small. Much more would now be known about Mayan history and culture if de Landa had not burned anywhere from 27 to what Mayan Historian George Stuart speculates as &quot;hundreds, maybe thousands of [Maya] books. We will never know.&quot;

==Consecrated as bishop==
Landa was sent back to Spain by Bishop Toral, to stand trial for conducting an illegal Inquisition. His actions were strongly condemned before the Council of the Indies. That resulted in a &quot;committee of doctors&quot; being commissioned to investigate Landa&#x27;s alleged crimes. In 1569, the committee absolved Landa of his crimes. Bishop Toral died in Mexico in 1571, allowing King Philip II of Spain to appoint Landa as the second bishop of Yucatán.

==Landa and contemporary Mayanist studies==
Landa&#x27;s &quot;Relación de las cosas de Yucatán&quot; also created a valuable record of the Maya writing system, which, despite its inaccuracies, was later to prove instrumental in the decipherment of the writing system. Landa asked his informants (his primary sources were two Maya individuals descended from a ruling Maya dynasty who were literate in the script) to write down the glyphic symbols corresponding to each of the letters of the (Spanish) alphabet, in the belief that there ought to be a one-to-one correspondence between them. The results were faithfully reproduced by Landa in his later account, but he recognised that the set contained apparent inconsistencies and duplicates that he was unable to explain. Later researchers reviewing this material also formed the view that the &quot;de Landa alphabet&quot; was inaccurate or fanciful, and many subsequent attempts to use the transcription remained unconvincing. It was not until much later, in the mid-20th century, when it was realized and then confirmed that it was not a transcription of an &quot;alphabet&quot;, as Landa and others had originally supposed, but was rather a syllabary. That was confirmed only by the work of Soviet linguist Yuri Knorozov in the 1950s and the succeeding generation of Mayanists.

<doc id="800807" wikidata="Q312899" url="?curid=800807" title="Sergius of Radonezh">
<text>Sergius of Radonezh (; 14 May 1314 – 25 September 1392) was a Russian spiritual leader and monastic reformer.

He was the founder of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius near Moscow, what is now the most venerated monastic house in Russia. He exerted the greatest influence of any personage on the Russian Orthodox Church. Together with Seraphim of Sarov, he is one of the most highly venerated saints in Russia.

Historian Serge Aleksandrovich Zenkovsky wrote that Sergius, along with Epiphanius the Wise, Stephen of Perm, and the painter Andrei Rublev, signified &quot;the Russian spiritual and cultural revival of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth century&quot;.

==Early life==
The date of his birth is unclear: it could be 1314, 1319, or 1322. His medieval biography states that he was born to Kiril and Maria, a boyar family, near Rostov, on the spot where now stands.

The narrative of Epiphanius does not specify the exact birthplace of the monk, stating only that before the migration from Rostov principality the monk&#x27;s family lived &quot;in a village in the area, which is within the Rostov principality, not very close to the city of Rostov&quot;. It is considered that it is the village Varnitsa () near Rostov. Sergius received the baptismal name of Bartholomew () in honor of the Apostle Bartholomew.

Although an intelligent boy, Bartholomew had great difficulty learning to read. His biography states that a &quot;starets&quot; (spiritual elder) met him one day and gave him a piece of &quot;prosphora&quot; (holy bread) to eat, and from that day forward he was able to read. Orthodox Christians interpret the incident as being an angelic visitation.

When the Rostov principality fell into the hands of Ivan I of Moscow, his parents Kirill and Maria became impoverished and moved to Radonezh together with their three sons, Stefan, Bartholomew and Peter.

==Monastic life==
Upon his parents&#x27; death, Bartholomew went to Khotkovo near Moscow, where his older brother Stefan was a monk. He persuaded Stefan to find a more secluded place to live the ascetic life. In the deep forest at Makovets Hill they decided to build a small monastic cell and a church dedicated in honor of the Trinity. Thus started the history of the great Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra.

In time, Stefan moved to a monastery in Moscow. Varfolomei (Bartholomew) was tonsured a monk and given the name Sergius, following which he spent more than a year in the forest alone as a hermit. Soon, however, other monks started coming to him and building their own cells. After some time, they persuaded him to become their &quot;hegumen&quot; (abbot) and he was ordained to the priesthood. Following his example, all the monks had to live by their own labor. Over time, more and more monks and donations came to this place. Nearby, there appeared a &quot;posad&quot;, which grew into the town of Sergiev Posad, and other villages.

When the news of Sergius&#x27;s accomplishments reached Patriarch Philotheus of Constantinople, Philotheus sent a monastic charter to Sergius. During the reign of Dmitri Donskoi, his disciples started to spread his teaching across central and northern Russia. They settled intentionally in the most impracticable places and founded numerous monasteries, of which Borisoglebsky, Ferapontov, Kirillo-Belozersky and Vysotsky monasteries could be mentioned. Sergius was also connected with the foundation of two monastic communities in Moscow, Andronikov and Simonov monasteries. All in all, the disciples of Sergius founded about 40 monasteries, thus greatly extending the geographical extent of his influence and authority. Metropolitan Alexius, Metropolitan of Moscow asked Sergius to become his successor but Sergius declined, preferring to remain a simple monk rather than be a bishop.

As an ascetic, Sergius did not take part in the political life of the country. However, he blessed Dmitry Donskoy when he went to fight the Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo, but only after he was certain Dmitry had pursued all peaceful means of resolving the conflict. Sergius is said to have bestowed upon Dmitry the victory with the help of the monks Alexander Peresvet and Rodion Oslyabya. Some historians interpreted his political stance as aspiring to make peace and unite Russian lands under the leadership of Moscow.

==Death and canonization==

Sergius died on 25 September 1392. His incorrupt relics were found in 1422 and placed in the new cathedral of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra which he founded.

The exact year of his canonization by the Russian Orthodox Church is uncertain, either 1452 or 1448
.The church commemorates him on September 25, the date of his death, and on July 5, the day his relics were uncovered. (See ). Among the many affectionate titles given to him, he has been referred to as the &quot;Abbot of Russia&quot; and &quot;valiant voivod&quot; of the Russian land.

The Catholic Church officially recognizes Sergius. In 1940, he was included in the liturgical calendar authorized for the Russian Catholics. Moreover, the most recent edition of the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; commemorates Sergius under the date of 25 September. 

Sergius is honored in the Calendar of Saints of several churches of the Anglican Communion and is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 25 September.

The ecumenical Fellowship of Saint Alban and Saint Sergius is named in part for him.

In December 1937, Pavel Florensky (1882–1937), a Russian theologian, priest, mathematician, inventor, philosopher and engineer died in the Soviet Gulag and it is thought he was condemned by an extrajudicial NKVD troika under NKVD Order No. 00447 to be executed during the 1930s Bolshevik purges after refusing to disclose the hiding place of Sergius&#x27; head which the Bolsheviks wanted destroyed. It is rumored that Florensky and other theologians were involved in a plot to save and hide the relics of St. Sergius. The relics were returned by Pavel Golubtsov, later &quot;Archbishop Sergius&quot;, to the cathedral of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra in 1946 when it was reopened.

==Legacy==
Much information about Sergius and his acts is taken from the writing of his life composed in the 15th century, which has come down to us in many later editions in the 15th to 20th century Russian manuscripts. The memory of Sergius of Radonezh has lived on thanks to the unique manuscript entitled &quot;The Life of St. Sergius of Radonezh&quot; written by famous hagiographer Pachomius the Serb, also known as Pachomius Logothetes. The original manuscript is housed in the National Library of Russia.

Historian Serge Aleksandrovich Zenkovsky wrote that Sergius, along with Epiphanius the Wise, Stephen of Perm, and the painter Andrei Rublev, signified &quot;the Russian spiritual and cultural revival of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth century&quot;.

<doc id="800813" wikidata="Q16010949" url="?curid=800813" title="Killing of Charlie Howard">
<text>Charles O. Howard (January 31, 1961 – July 7, 1984) was an American murder victim in Bangor, Maine in 1984. As Howard and his life partner, Roy Ogden, were walking down the street, three teenagers, Shawn I. Mabry, age 16, James (Jim) Francis Baines, age 15, and Daniel Ness, age 17, harassed, assaulted, and murdered Howard for being gay. The youths chased the couple, yelling homophobic epithets, until they caught Howard and threw him over the State Street Bridge into the Kenduskeag Stream, despite his pleas that he could not swim. He drowned, but his partner escaped and pulled a fire alarm. Charlie Howard&#x27;s body was found by rescue workers several hours later.

This event galvanized the Bangor community in ways similar to the killing of Matthew Shepard, although the case never attained the same level of national notoriety. As an adult, Jim Baines later spoke to various groups in Maine about his involvement in the murder and the damage that intolerance can do to people and their community. His story was published as &quot;Penitence: A True Story&quot; with Edward Armstrong, although Baines received no royalties from the book. The Maine Lesbian/Gay Political Alliance, which later became EqualityMaine, was formed in part as a reaction to Howard&#x27;s death.

The Bangor City Council and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community have erected a monument along the Kenduskeag Stream honoring the memory of Charlie Howard as the victim of a hate crime. The Maine Speakout Project maintains the Charlie Howard Memorial Library in Portland, Maine. The library is open to the public.

==Background==
Charlie Howard was from Portsmouth, New Hampshire. A young, fair-haired man, Charlie was small boned and suffered from asthma. He was often made fun of as a small child, and was bullied in high school due to his sexual orientation. He did not attend his graduation to spare his family from the taunts he often received. With his poor grades, he knew college was not for him.

Charlie left Portsmouth, New Hampshire and eventually landed in Ellsworth, Maine. When the relationship that he was in ended in January 1984, Charlie left Ellsworth for Bangor, Maine.

In Bangor, Paul Noddin and Scott Hamilton befriended Charlie. Charlie was homeless with no prospects and Scott and Paul welcomed Charlie into their home. After a month, Charlie&#x27;s opportunities were nil and Scott and Paul convinced him to return home to Portsmouth to live with his mother and stepfather.

Charlie was not home a week when he knew he could not stay. He had a brief relationship that ended quickly. When he called his two friends in Bangor, they realized Charlie was hurting and invited him to come back to Bangor.

Charlie returned - in high spirits and determined. He joined the local supportive Unitarian Church on Union Street as well as the Bangor support group Interweave. Here he made new friends and was accepted for who he was. In thanks for their support, Charlie prepared an Easter dinner for Paul and Scott and decorated their home. Eventually Charlie took an apartment on First Street, near his church, and adopted a kitten.

Charlie lived at a time when most homosexuals were still closeted, but Charlie was &quot;out&quot; and even flamboyant; he wore jewelry and feminine accessories. He was known for singing the song &quot;I Am What I Am&quot; from the musical &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;.

In 1984, many were not tolerant of homosexuals and victims of gay bashing often did not report incidents. Charlie was often tormented by local high school boys and was asked to leave a local night club when he danced with a man. Charlie was accosted by a woman in a local market one day, who shouted epithets at him such as &quot;&quot;You pervert&quot; and &quot;You queer!&quot;&quot; Frightened, Charlie quickly left, but as he was leaving, he stopped, turned around, and blew a kiss. After this, Charlie was more wary of strangers. Leaving his apartment one day, he found his pet kitten dead on the doorstep. It had been strangled.

== July 7, 1984 ==
On Saturday, July 7, 1984, Charlie attended a potluck supper at Interweave. Leaving the party about 10 pm with his partner Roy Ogden, Charlie decided to walk to the post office to retrieve his mail. As Charlie and Roy walked up State Street and began to cross the Kenduskeag River Bridge, a car full of high school teenagers began to slow down.

In the car were Shawn Mabry, Jim Baines, Daniel Ness, and two girls. They had been at a party and had left to purchase alcohol with a fake ID that one of the girls had in her possession. Seeing Charlie, the boys got out of the car and decided to give chase. The two girls remained in the car.

Charlie began to run when he recognized the vehicle from an earlier incident. Shouting epithets, the boys gave chase. Charlie fell because of his asthma, and could not catch his breath. Roy ran further down State Street, stopped and observed.

Pouncing on Charlie, the boys began beating and kicking him. Baines shouted to throw Charlie over the bridge and grabbed him by the legs. Baines and Ness grabbed Charlie and they began lifting him. Pleading for his life, Charlie grabbed the rail and begged them not to throw him in the river as he could not swim. Prying his hand loose, they began to pitch him over the rail, with Mabry giving the final push. The boys then returned to the car, which the girls were trying to start. Spying Roy, they threatened him not to tell anyone. Roy then ran for help and pulled the first fire alarm he came to on State Street.

Soon, the sirens could be heard. An immediate search for Charlie began among the concrete retaining walls along the Kenduskeag. At 1 am Charlie&#x27;s body was found. An autopsy would show he had suffered from a severe asthma attack and drowned.

Returning to the party, the boys bragged about their encounter, calling the bridge the &quot;Chuckahomo Bridge&quot;. The next day one of the boys turned himself in after he learned that Charlie had died. The other two boys decided to leave town on a freight train and then thought better of it. Returning home, they were arrested.

==The aftermath==
The boys were sent to the Hancock County Jail and later released into their parents&#x27; custody. They were tried as juveniles and sentenced on 1 October 1984 to the Maine Youth Center, for a period not to exceed their 21st birthdays. According to the &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot;, &quot;Baines was released after serving two years, and Mabry was released after 22 months.&quot; Charlie Howard was buried in Orchard Grove Cemetery, Kittery, Maine. His grave, previously unmarked, now has a stone.

==Memorials==
On July 7, 2004, a twentieth anniversary walk was held in memory of Howard.

Twenty-five years later, the &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot; tried to locate Shawn Mabry, Jim Baines, and Daniel Ness, now middle-aged men, for their views on the murder. They were unable to locate Mabry and Ness at that time, but did find Baines, who was living and working in Bangor. Following his release from the detention center, he spoke regularly about tolerance to local students and even addressed the Maine State Legislature in &quot;support of a bill to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation&quot;. In addition, he co-authored the book &quot;Penitence&quot; with Ed Armstrong in 1994. Baines did not receive any of the profits of the book. That same year, Mabry publicly expressed his regrets about his participation. He stated that he thinks about Charlie Howard every day.

A short distance from the site of Howard&#x27;s death, a memorial has been erected; engraved on the stone are the words: “May we, the citizens of Bangor, continue to change the world around us until hatred becomes peacemaking and ignorance becomes understanding.” In May 2011, vandals spray-painted graffiti and an anti-gay slur on Charlie Howard&#x27;s memorial. Family and friends cleaned it up and rededicated it.

July 7, Howard&#x27;s death date, is dedicated as Diversity Day in Bangor. Each year, a floral wreath is placed into the Kenduskeag as a memorial to Howard, which is a &quot;service [that] re-created the one held after Howard was killed four decades ago, where attendees walked to the site of his death and dropped flowers into the stream below.&quot;

In 2021, a stone bench was installed in Portsmouth&#x27;s Commercial Allery with an inscription of Howard&#x27;s favorite song “I Am What I Am,” from the musical “La Cage aux Folles…”

July 7, 2024 was the fortieth anniversary of Charlie Howard&#x27;s death, which was marked by a large memorial gathering involving residents as well as community groups, including the current Unitarian Universalist community in Bangor.

== Legacy in pop culture ==
Charlie Howard&#x27;s murder inspired a similar scene in Bangor-native Stephen King&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;It&quot;, in which three homophobic teenagers throw a young gay man, Adrian Mellon, over a bridge and into the Kenduskeag, where he was set upon and murdered by the novel&#x27;s antagonist Pennywise. In the 2019 film adaption &quot;It Chapter Two&quot;, Canadian actor Xavier Dolan portrayed the character of Adrian Mellon in the opening scene.

The gay poet Mark Doty wrote a poem about the murder called &quot;Charlie Howard&#x27;s Descent&quot;.

The murder is also the inspiration for a novel by Bette Greene titled &quot;The Drowning of Stephan Jones&quot;.

The line &quot;faggot kicked into the icy river&quot; in lesbian-feminist poet Adrienne Rich&#x27;s poem &quot;Yom Kippur 1984&quot; is a reference to Charlie Howard.

<text>Williams International is an American manufacturer of small gas turbine engines based in Pontiac, Michigan, United States. It produces jet engines for cruise missiles and small jet aircraft.

== History ==
Dr. Sam B. Williams worked at Chrysler on their automotive turbine systems, but always imagined a wider set of applications for the small gas turbine engine. He left Chrysler to form Williams Research Corporation in Birmingham, Michigan, in 1954. In 1981, the company became Williams International. It has been building small turbofan engines since the 1950s for use in cruise missiles as well as target and reconnaissance drones.

Using the missile engines, Williams developed a series of personal VTOL flying craft, including a jet-powered belt in 1969, the Williams Aerial Systems Platform (WASP), also known as the &quot;flying pulpit&quot; in the 1970s, and the X-Jet, which was evaluated by the United States Army in the 1980s. The WASP platform was the only competitor to the Garrett STAMP in the United States Marine Corps STAMP (Small Tactical Aerial Mobility Platform) program of the early 1970s.

Also in the 1980s, Williams identified a need in the general aviation market for a small, light jet engine to power cost-effective personal and corporate jet aircraft. The company introduced the FJ44 engine, which in turn made possible the introduction of a number of small jet aircraft.

In 1992, NASA initiated its Advanced General Aviation Transport Experiments (AGATE) program to partner with manufacturers and help develop technologies that would revitalize the sagging general aviation industry. In 1996, Williams joined AGATE&#x27;s General Aviation Propulsion program to develop a fuel-efficient turbofan engine that would be even smaller than the FJ44. The result was the FJX-2 engine. Williams then contracted with Burt Rutan&#x27;s Scaled Composites to design and build the Williams V-Jet II, a Very Light Jet to use as a testbed and technology demonstrator to showcase the new engine. The aircraft and engine were debuted at the 1997 Oshkosh Airshow. The production version of the engine, the EJ22 flew on the prototype Eclipse 500 VLJ (which had evolved from the V-Jet II), but was subsequently replaced by a Pratt &amp; Whitney engine.

<doc id="800826" wikidata="Q257469" url="?curid=800826" title="Another World (video game)">
<text>Another World is a cinematic platform action-adventure game designed by Éric Chahi and published by Delphine Software in November 1991. In North America it was published as Out of This World. The game tells the story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself on a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.

&quot;Another World&quot; was developed by Chahi alone over a period of about two years, with help with the soundtrack from Jean-François Freitas. Chahi developed his own game engine, creating all the game&#x27;s art and animations in vector form to reduce memory use, with some use of rotoscoping to help plan out character movements. Both narratively and gameplay-wise, he wanted the game to be told with little to no language or user-interface elements. The game was originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST but has since been widely ported to other contemporary systems, including home and portable consoles and mobile devices. Chahi has since overseen release of various anniversary releases of the game.

&quot;Another World&quot; was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which earned the game praise among critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers, inspiring such titles as &quot;Ico&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, and Delphine&#x27;s later &quot;Flashback&quot;. It is now considered among the best video games ever made.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Another World&quot; is a platform game, featuring a control scheme where the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation-specific actions, such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, the player&#x27;s character Lester is unarmed. He is able to kick at small creatures, but is otherwise defenseless.

Later in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls. Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.

Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues as to what the player should do next, features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in an unintelligible alien language.

==Plot==
The protagonist of the game is Lester Knight Chaykin, a young physicist. In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his high-tech underground laboratory in his car during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a particle accelerator, attempting to reconstruct what happened when the universe was born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and teleporting Lester to a barren, alien planet.

After evading a number of dangerous indigenous animals, Lester is captured by a race of humanoid aliens and taken to a subterranean prison camp. Lester escapes along with an alien captive known as &quot;Buddy&quot; and the two must evade capture while travelling through a series of dangerous environments, battling alien soldiers and wild creatures while solving numerous puzzles in order to survive. The duo traverse the prison complex, a cave system and a tower structure. In the game&#x27;s climax, Lester is severely wounded by one of the aliens, but with the help of his alien friend, manages to kill his attacker and escape. After reaching the top of the tower, Lester collapses, but is promptly joined by Buddy, who picks Lester up and the two escape on a dragon-like creature, flying off to the horizon.

==Development==
The game&#x27;s French designer Éric Chahi had previously worked as a game programmer and then as a graphic designer for video games since 1983. It was the success of his earlier work with Paul Cuisset as a graphic designer for the adventure game &quot;Future Wars&quot; for Delphine Software and its royalties that gave him the chance to develop &quot;Another World&quot; &quot;without any constraint of any sort or any editorial pressure.&quot; After &quot;Future Wars&quot; was released in 1989, Chahi had the choice either to work on Cuisset&#x27;s next game, &quot;Operation Stealth&quot;, or create his own game. As &quot;there had been many books and tools released to develop easily on the Amiga at that time,&quot; Chahi felt confident that he could go back to programming.

The game was influenced by works that Chahi liked at the time. The art and atmosphere were influenced by science fiction books such as &quot;Dune&quot;, artists such as Michael Whelan, and comic illustrators such as Richard Corben. Manga such as Akira Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; influenced the way it suggests a lot with very little, character blurring effects such as the use of thin lines to suggest fast motion, and charging power attacks influenced by the Kamehameha. The game&#x27;s art style and atmosphere also drew influence from science fiction or fantasy art, including artists such as Frank Frazetta, Bernie Wrightson, and Zdzisław Beksiński, as well as the novel &quot;Hyperion&quot;. The laser blasters were also influenced by &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

In August 1989, Chahi was impressed by the flat-color animations that the Amiga version of &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; had and thought that it would be possible to use vector outlines to create a similar effect using much less computer storage. After first attempting to write the graphical routines in C, he turned to assembly language. He wrote a polygon routine for the Motorola 68000 on an Atari ST to test his theory, with much success. Later, he found that he could run the code on the Amiga platform and achieve a frame rate of about 20 frames per second, later recognizing this as &quot;a major turning point in the creation of the game&quot; and the point where he knew the polygon approach would work. He was able to take advantage of the Amiga&#x27;s genlock capabilities to create rotoscoped animations with the polygons, using video recordings of himself performing various actions. Though he had tried to use smaller polygons (which Chahi called &quot;pixigons&quot;) to construct the backgrounds for the scenes based on Deluxe Paint artwork, the process of creating them was excruciatingly slow, and he returned to using bitmapped images.

While Chahi had a clear idea of how to implement his game engine, he mostly improvised when creating the actual content of the game, allowing the game to develop &quot;layer by layer without knowing where it was going.&quot; He planned on creating a science fiction game that was similar to &quot;Karateka&quot; and &quot;Impossible Mission&quot;. Because he wanted to create a dramatic, cinematic experience, the game features no HUD or dialog, giving the player only a representation of the surrounding game world during both gameplay elements and the cutscenes progressing the story. However, with no idea of the technical limitations he would face while building out the story, he focused more on creating ambiance, rhythmic pacing, and narrative tension to the game. Chahi resorted to developing his own tool with a new programming language through GFA BASIC coupled with the game&#x27;s engine in Devpac assembler, to control and animate the game, interpreted in real-time by the game engine, effectively creating his own animation sequencer.

With the creation of the tools needed for building out the rest of the game by December 1989, Chahi began working on the introductory sequence as a means to validate the full capacities of his engine. The introduction sequence also gave Chahi the chance to explore the types of cinematics he could create through the engine. Chahi later considered this the &quot;first step in the improvisation process&quot; that he used throughout the rest of development. He finished the game&#x27;s introduction sequence in early 1990 and started working on the first level. Chahi worked at the game at a linear pace, developing each section of the game in chronological order and influenced by his own personal feelings and attitude at the time. For example, as Chahi recognized he was trying to create a game on his own, the first portions of the game evoke loneliness and isolation, reflecting Chahi&#x27;s mood at the time. He did not have the original intention of the character meeting an ally, but again described the improvisation approach led him to include the alien friend, and had included specific cinematics that showed a close up of the alien to help the player imagine this world.

Later in the game&#x27;s development, Chahi added laser pistols, including the one that Lester carries for several effects. The idea was influenced by the &quot;Star Wars&quot; blasters, but added depth to the gameplay by giving the player more options. He also found that repeated laser fire by the enemies helped to enunciate the rhythm of the game. Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.

After 17 months of development, Chahi was only about one-third finished with the game, and realized that this rate would have been impractical. He began to take steps to simplify the development, including reusing background graphics and creating building blocks that allowed him to focus more on the game&#x27;s puzzles. At the same time, he began to seek a publisher for the game. He first spoke to his former employer, Delphine Software, but also sought other distributors. One, Virgin, was favourable to Chahi&#x27;s game but had suggested that he change it to a point-and-click style adventure game. Chahi had considered changing the game in line with this request but realized &quot;the effort to do this would have been too huge, and some friends who played the game loved it.&quot; Ultimately, he accepted Delphine&#x27;s offer in June 1991, and set a tentative release date in November. To meet this deadline, Chahi used storyboards to sketch out the rest of the game&#x27;s plot, balancing the overall pacing of the game. One ending captured on these storyboards, but abandoned, was Lester becoming the leader of the alien world. Chahi also argued for his own cover art for the game even with the time crunch for release; he had been disappointed in cover art that was foisted on his games by previous publishers and insisted he be allowed to create it for this game. The game was finished in 1991, which inspired the game&#x27;s tagline: &quot;It took six days to create the Earth. &quot;Another World&quot; took two years&quot;; Chahi noted his own exhaustion at completing this project is mirrored in the near-death of Lester at the end of the game.

Upon publishing, Delphine did not perform a playtest of the full game, only having previously tested the first portion of the game. Delphine&#x27;s U.S. publisher Interplay undertook a full playtest and Chahi fixed a number of bugs that arose from this. Interplay had also requested additional changes in the game, including making the game longer and changing the game&#x27;s introduction music. Chahi was adamant about retaining the game&#x27;s opening music, and had attempted to change Interplay&#x27;s minds by sending them an &quot;infinite fax&quot;, a looped piece of paper, with the message &quot;keep the original intro music&quot; on it. Only when Delphine&#x27;s lawyer got involved and told Interplay they legally could not change the music did Interplay relax this requirement.

==Soundtrack==
The game&#x27;s music was composed by Jean-François Freitas. The music was influenced by film soundtracks such as &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. Black Screen Records released CD and vinyl versions of the 18-song soundtrack in August 2017.

==Release==

The game was originally released for the Amiga and Atari ST in November 1991, running at a display resolution of 320×200 pixels. These versions received less play-testing than other versions, making for a less-fluid game, but the Amiga&#x27;s sound capabilities afford it a high sound quality compared to contemporary ports. The game released on the Atari ST is identical, but with a less refined sound, and its colors are less sharp than on Amiga. These versions had code wheel protection that made it difficult to use unauthorized copies, forcing the player to enter a code (series of figures) looked up from a code wheel that came with the game. The player had to turn the wheel according to the number that was requested in the screen whenever the game is loaded in order to reload the game. Another small change between the Amiga and ST versions and the others was that Lester would yell as he grabs the vine in the first area if he was not being chased by the beast in these versions; this feature was omitted from most other versions.

The game was published in North America under the title &quot;Out of This World&quot; in order to avoid confusion with the popular but unrelated soap opera television series &quot;Another World&quot;. Coincidentally, the science fiction sitcom &quot;Out of This World&quot; aired at the same time as the game&#x27;s USA-Canada release.

=== Ports ===
Many reviewers criticized the short length of the game. Chahi, working for 16 hours a day for two months, responded by creating a new level just before the amphitheatre scene, when the alien friend rescues Lester at the end of a long dead-end corridor. Chahi said: &quot;I like this extra level a lot because it reinforces the close relationship between the hero and the alien by developing their mutual aid.&quot; Also added were more dangers and more save points. This ended up being the 1992 DOS version, which was coded by Daniel Morais, and had the exact code wheel protection of the Amiga and ST versions. The Macintosh features higher resolution than the DOS version, but is otherwise identical.

Through Interplay Entertainment, the game was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and the Apple IIGS in 1992, and then for the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) in 1993. The SNES, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (3DO) and Apple IIGS ports each contain a prologue before the introduction begins, which consists of an entry that comes from Lester&#x27;s diary. The Mega Drive port&#x27;s prologue is different from that of the SNES and 3DO ports. The Sega CD version of &quot;Another World&quot; combines the original game (with CD-quality new music by Freitas) with the sequel, &quot;Heart of the Alien&quot;, and was released exclusively in North America as Heart of the Alien: Out of This World Parts I and II.

All of the console versions include some form of dynamic musical score during gameplay, and in the case of the Mega Drive conversion, use arrangements of the music originating in the SNES and Apple IIGS versions. This differs from other versions which only have music for the opening and ending segments. Interplay wanted to add additional tunes by Charles Deenen. They also wanted to exchange Jean-François Freitas&#x27;s music for a different soundtrack, but Chahi did not agree to the change and Delphine&#x27;s lawyer helped to keep the original intro music. The Apple IIGS and Super NES versions were programmed by Rebecca Heineman, who said: &quot;Since Interplay wouldn&#x27;t pay for a Super FX chip, I found a way to do it with static RAM on the cart and DMA which got me a great frame rate. Interplay wouldn&#x27;t pay for the static RAM either, so I ended up using Fast ROM instruction. Interplay wouldn&#x27;t pay for a 3.6 MHz ROM either. So, frustrated, I shoved my block move code into the DMA registers and use it as RAM running at 3.6 MHz. It worked. I got fast block moves on slow cartridges and made a game using polygons working on a 65816 with pure software rendering.&quot; &quot;Another World&quot; is the only game directly ported from the Super NES to the Apple IIGS, which has the same 65C816 microprocessor.

The 3DO port was developed by Interplay in 1993, and features very detailed raster graphics backgrounds. However, Chahi believes that this actually detracts from the game, because the polygons do not fit in with this, and thus make the backgrounds look flat. The game&#x27;s soundtrack was changed again, albeit without any legal troubles, due to Chahi&#x27;s focus on a new project. Some new tunes were also added, all played from the disc, such as when Lester escapes the big pool in the first level and when he is grabbed by the guard that appears at the end. At the ending, there is a fragment of the introduction of the sequel, &quot;Heart of the Alien&quot;. Also included in some versions of this 3DO release is a separate minigame &quot;Stalactites&quot;, in which the player pushes up stalactite shapes falling from the top of the screen. This version also includes an Easter egg animation of Rebecca Heineman getting her head chopped off.

Chahi acquired the rights to &quot;Another World&quot;″s intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game&#x27;s playability could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming certain parts of the script and made the graphics&#x27; shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones&#x27; low resolutions. In July 2005, almost a decade and a half after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the Symbian operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions. In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered Pocket PC version for Windows Mobile 5.0 OS or later in QVGA (320×240 resolution). Telcogames entered administration in 2008, closing the Magic Productions studio. The administrator&#x27;s letter to stakeholders mentions that its assets will be sold, but does not indicate to whom or mention &quot;Another World&quot; assets by name.

An Atari Jaguar port of &quot;Another World&quot; was originally in development and planned to be published by Interplay in September 1994, but it was never released. In 2012, the Jaguar port of the game was confirmed and approved by Chahi. It was released as a limited collector&#x27;s item in cartridge form, complete with a box and manual published by the association Retro-Gaming Connexion (RGC) in 2013. The game engine was rewritten especially for the Atari Jaguar to make use of the console&#x27;s several processors: the GPU and blitter perform polygon rendering; the GPU performs on-the-fly data decompression; the DSP plays stereo music and sound effects; and the 68000 CPU performs JIT compilation and execution of the scripts. The Jaguar version is playable in the original graphics 16-color mode and &quot;Deluxe 15th Anniversary&quot; graphics 256-color mode. It can be played in normal and speed-run modes. It supports five languages: English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish.

===&quot;15th Anniversary&quot;===
After the release of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version targeted at Windows XP. Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.

The game does not include Interplay&#x27;s extra music, but it includes the extra level, as well as the added enemies and hazards from the console versions. This version is part of the &quot;Another World 15th Anniversary Edition&quot; CD-ROM released in 2007, which also includes a development diary, an exclusive postcard autographed by Chahi and a separate soundtrack CD. The CD-ROM version of &quot;15th Anniversary Edition&quot; contains strict digital rights management technology – upon installation, the game verifies the user&#x27;s serial number through the Internet, allowing only for five installations of the game using any given serial number. Uninstallation does not reset the count, so after five installations, the player must purchase a new copy. This problem does not exist on the digital copy sold by GOG.com.

===&quot;20th Anniversary&quot;===
At the 2011 Game Developers Conference, Chahi announced that an Apple iOS port of the title would be created by DotEmu and distributed by BulkyPix. On September 22, 2011, BulkyPix released a special 20th anniversary edition for the iPhone/iPad, featuring a switch between the original and HD graphics, new intuitive touch controls or a classic D-pad, three difficulty modes and remastered sound effects. The Android version was released in March 2012, the Steam version was released on April 4, 2013 and the GOG version was released April 22, 2013 (15th Anniversary Edition available on GOG in the same package as 20th Anniversary Edition).

The console versions of the &quot;20th Anniversary&quot; port were released by Digital Lounge for Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, and Nintendo 3DS in June 2014. The three PlayStation versions allow cross-platform functionality. According to Digital Lounge, the goal was to &quot;simply to deliver the original experience of &quot;Another World&quot; faithfully, with the benefits of today&#x27;s hardware and a high level of polish&quot;. Chahi said the animations were &quot;refined to remove the rough edges revealed by such a high resolution rendering&quot; of up to 2560×1600 pixels. Digital Lounge and DotEmu also worked on the port for the Nintendo Switch, which was released on July 9, 2018.

&quot;Another World&quot;, along with &quot;Flashback&quot;, shipped as a single retail package by Microids for the PlayStation 4, Switch, and Xbox One on April 16, 2020 in Europe.

==Reception==
&quot;Another World&quot; was commercially successful, selling about one million copies during the 1990s. The game received critical acclaim. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; criticized the brief documentation and short length of gameplay, but praised the game&#x27;s graphics and Amiga sound, and called it &quot;one of Europe&#x27;s most playable and enjoyable arcade efforts.&quot; The Lessers of &quot;Dragon&quot; gave the game 5 out of 5 stars and called it &quot;an adventure that will keep [the player] on the edge of [one&#x27;s] seat for some time to come.&quot; Reviewing the 3DO version, &quot;GamePro&quot; said &quot;&quot;Out of This World&quot; is destined to be a classic&quot;, but that the 3DO version has too little improvement to be worthwhile for those who have already played the game.

Among many other accolades, &quot;Another World&quot; was named as number one top new Amiga game of 1992 by &quot;Amiga World&quot; and received the award for the Most Innovative New Game of the year from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. In 2012, it became one of the first 14 titles added to the video game art exposition at the Museum of Modern Art. It also received the nomination for &quot;Game, Classic Revival&quot; at the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards.

Retrospectively, Kristan Reed of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called &quot;Another World&quot; &quot;one of the most visionary and memorable games of its time.&quot; Reviewing the &quot;15th Anniversary Edition&quot; in 2010, &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s John Walker called it &quot;still utterly beautiful&quot;, adding that the game&#x27;s art style is &quot;just fantastic. Chahi&#x27;s design is exquisitely simple and enormously evocative. Built from spare polygons, its paper-craft-like animation conjures the world, the creatures and the threat wonderfully.&quot; In a 2014 review of the 3DS version, Bob Mackey of &quot;USGamer&quot; opined &quot;&quot;Another World&quot; is definitely an experience every gamer should have — and not just for the sake of checking out a historical curiosity. &quot;Another World&quot; still feels incredibly forward-thinking, almost as if Chahi had developed a game for this decade&#x27;s indie scene without even realizing it.&quot;

In 2008, Tim Rogers named &quot;Another World&quot; &quot;The best videogame of all time&quot;, describing it as &quot;an Actual Genius&#x27;s osmosed omniscience regarding game design.&quot; In 2011, Wirtualna Polska ranked the &quot;visionary&quot; &quot;Another World&quot; as the 15th best game for the Amiga, remembering it for a cinematic feel and &quot;uncommonly&quot; high difficulty (for a first-time player) and calling it &quot;one of the most important titles in the history of electronic entertainment.&quot; In 2012, &quot;1UP&quot; ranked this &quot;short-but-sweet cinematic action game&quot; as the 99th most essential video game of all time, commenting: &quot;Especially in an age of entertainment where fans cry out for pages upon pages lore and glossaries for the tiniest minutiae of their fiction, &quot;Out of this World&quot;″s dimension contains a sense of mystery that makes it all the more lonely, and often, quietly beautiful. The game can be brutal and heartbreaking, but Chahi&#x27;s amazing vision makes [it] a thoroughly gripping experience.&quot; That same year, Lucas Sullivan of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; named it as number one top &quot;cult-classic franchise&quot; that should be rebooted in a way &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; was, commenting that &quot;despite a small cast of characters, minimalist gameplay, and some truly grueling difficulty, &quot;Another World&quot; ... resonated with gamers in ways they weren&#x27;t expecting. The game&#x27;s vivid vector graphics were utterly stunning at the time, and the pacing of the heavy, nicely animated platforming naturally melded with taking in the sights of the sublime alien landscape,&quot; and adding that &quot;slowly adapting to the hostile surroundings offered a hard-earned satisfaction and a surprisingly moving story.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Complex&quot; rated the game 60th on their The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time, writing: &quot;From the very beginning, &quot;Out of This World&quot; sweeps you away on its sci-fi adventure. It’s almost as good as its spiritual successor, &quot;Flashback&quot;. Almost, we said.&quot; In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; ranked the game #46 on its Top 100 SNES Games. They described the game as &quot;A moody but amazingly fluid game which faultlessly takes you between action sections and plot scenes drawing you into the excellent story.&quot; In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; listed the game 73rd in its Top 100 Video Games writing: &quot;Another giant leap in cinematic gameplay, every bit as cool and smooth as the later Flashback, but far weirder. In the same year, &quot;MegaZone&quot; included the game on their Top 50 Games In History, summarizing: &quot;Great depth and strange but functional graphics give it a movie-like feel.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; listed &quot;Out of This World&quot; 69th in their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time.&quot;

The alien &quot;Beast&quot; creature from the game&#x27;s first level was ranked sixth on the &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 1999 top list of best monsters in gaming and &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the game&#x27;s laser gun as the 86th best weapon in gaming history in 2012. The alien &quot;Buddy&quot; was ranked third on &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s list of the ten best sidekicks in 2000, along with a comment that the &quot;groundbreaking&quot; &quot;Another World&quot; &quot;is one of those rare games that everybody seemed to love.&quot; Discussing &quot;Buddy&quot; in 2013, &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot;″s Adam Smith called him still &quot;one of gaming&#x27;s greatest companions&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;More like being in a movie than playing a video game, this leisurely paced, noir-tinted adventure demands that you use your wits to find your way out of an eerie parallel universe.&quot; 

==Legacy==
A sequel titled &quot;Heart of the Alien&quot; was developed by Interplay and released exclusively for the Sega CD in 1994. The game is similar in graphics and gameplay, as the player plays as Lester&#x27;s alien friend Buddy. Chahi had nothing to do with the development of the sequel, beyond suggesting &quot;redesigning the game from the alien point of view,&quot; by which he meant making an alternative version of the original game but was misunderstood. In 2014, Polish filmmaker Bartek Hławka created a live-action fan film titled &quot;Another World: The Movie&quot;, and in 2015, Italian filmmaker Daniele Spadoni did a different fan film mixing live action footage with CG animation. Chahi has stated in several interviews that he has no intention of making a sequel, as he wants the ending of the original to remain ambiguous and fans could make their own conclusion to Lester&#x27;s story.

The company that produced &quot;Another World&quot;, Delphine Software, has since gone into administrative receivership and &quot;Another World&quot; remains their most recognized game. Paul Cuisset&#x27;s best-selling 1992 game &quot;Flashback&quot;, also released by Delphine but created without any involvement from Chahi, features similar gameplay and graphics and makes a few nods to &quot;Another World&quot;, including the use of personal force fields in combat, a nearly identical end text in the ending cutscene, and an almost exact motion recreation of the gun pickup cutscene. A very similar plot premise was used in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Outcast&quot; by Infogrames Entertainment, also from France. The game also had a big influence on several other game designers, especially in Japan. Fumito Ueda cited &quot;Another World&quot; as an inspiration for his creation of &quot;Ico&quot;. Hideo Kojima, creator of the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, said it was one of the five games that influenced him the most. Video game designer Goichi Suda called it his favourite game.

Chahi returned to the concept of cinematic platform games after leaving Delphine. In 1998, he and his company Amazing Studio made &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, which is in many ways a spiritual successor to &quot;Another World&quot;. After that, Chahi disappeared from the game industry for several years, but in 2005 he regained interest in making video games. In 2011, Ubisoft released his next game, &quot;From Dust&quot;.

<text>Roast chicken is chicken prepared as food by roasting whether in a home kitchen, over a fire, or with a rotisserie (rotary spit). Generally, the chicken is roasted with its own fat and juices by circulating the meat during roasting, and therefore, are usually cooked exposed to fire or heat with some type of rotary grill so that the circulation of these fats and juices is as efficient as possible. Roast chicken is a dish that appears in a wide variety of cuisines worldwide.

==Varieties==
===Hendl===
Hendl is the Austro-Bavarian word for chicken, most commonly in its roasted form (&quot;Brathendl&quot;). Another popular form is the fried &quot;Backhendl&quot; () version, a specialty of the Viennese cuisine. The Standard German term is &quot;Hähnchen&quot; (&quot;cockerel&quot;). In the new states of Germany it is often called &quot;Broiler&quot;.

Hendls are traditionally served in Bavarian beer gardens or at festivals such as Oktoberfest, and are generally eaten with potato salad or a &quot;Breze&quot;, possibly accompanied by a &quot;Maß&quot; of beer. They are also widely available from mobile rotisserie trucks that park near well-frequented locations such as supermarkets or large parking lots.

Paprika Hendl (paprika chicken) is mentioned in Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, as a dish enjoyed by J. Harker who wishes to get the recipe for his wife-to-be, Mina. 
===Pollo asado or a la Brasa===

Pollo a la brasa, also known as pollo asado, Peruvian chicken or Blackened chicken in the United States and charcoal chicken in Australia. The original version consisted of a chicken cooked in charcoal but the preparation has evolved and marinated meat is now roasted in the heat of the coals of a special oven called a &quot;rotombo&quot; which rotates the bird on its own axis, consistently receiving heat from the coals. The oven can be operated using coal, gas, or wood, with the more traditional wood being from the &quot;Prosopis pallida&quot; tree.

===Other varieties===
Rotisserie chicken has become a growing trend in the United States since the mid 1990s. American supermarkets commonly roast rotisserie chickens using either horizontal or vertical rotisseries. These chickens are a means of using unsold fresh chickens and are often sold at lower prices than fresh chickens. Wholesale club Costco does not recycle fresh chickens but is noted for selling 60 million of its US$4.99 whole roasted chickens each year. The Boston Market fast casual restaurant chain originally specialized in roast chicken.
Tandoori chicken is a dish popular on the Indian subcontinent consisting of chicken roasted in a cylindrical clay oven, a tandoor, and prepared with yogurt and spices.

The Levantine Arab shawarma, Turkish döner kebap and Greek gyros can be made from a variety of meats, one of which is chicken. The Taiwanese version of shawarma, &quot;shāwēimǎ&quot; (Chinese: 沙威瑪), is nearly always chicken.

Oven roasted chicken is often served in the United States for special family meals including holidays such as Rosh Hashanah, Christmas and sometimes Easter or Thanksgiving. Considered a &quot;comfort food&quot; by many, oven roasted chicken had a resurgence of popularity in the mid to late 1990s as more restaurants and recipe publishers started to refocus on classic American fare. The basic roasting process involves removing the neck and giblets from the cavity, trussing the bird and folding the wings underneath, seasoning the skin and/or cavity, and then placing the bird in a pre-heated oven. The bird should be basted regularly, and is considered done when a meat thermometer registers 170°F for white meat or 185°F for dark meat. It is commonly stuffed with oyster stuffing, chestnut stuffing or potato stuffing, or other varieties of stuffings.

Chicken under a brick is a manner of preparation in which the chicken is weighed down by a brick or other heavy object.

<text>Simon Munnery is an English comedian.

== Early life ==
Born in Middlesex, Munnery grew up in Bedmond and was educated at Watford Grammar School for Boys, where he earned four A Levels. He read natural sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge but soon lost interest in science and joined the Footlights. In 1987, he became vice-president with Peter Bradshaw as president. After graduating with &quot;a very high third&quot;, he did various menial jobs before making his big break into comedy. He has described praise of his work as implying his work occupies a place between &quot;unfunny comedy&quot; and &quot;shit art&quot;.

Munnery had a short-lived career as a video game programmer. His most famous title was a version of &quot;Asteroids&quot; for the Commodore International VIC-20 (a game that Jeff Minter once described as a &quot;pile of wank&quot;). He also authored several games for the ZX81 (&quot;Road Race&quot;, &quot;Breakout&quot; and &quot;Space Invaders&quot;) and the ZX Spectrum. The VIC-20 games he wrote were &quot;Asteroids&quot;, &quot;Cosmiads&quot; and &quot;Scramble&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Stand-up comedy ===
While at university, Munnery took part in a stand-up double-act called &quot;God and Jesus&quot; with Stephen Cheeke. He also worked (along with Steve Coogan, Patrick Marber, Richard Herring and Stewart Lee) at the Edinburgh Festival in a piece called &quot;The Dum Show&quot;.

Munnery was brought to the attention of a comedy community as the compere of a post-alternative comedy cabaret called &quot;Cluub Zarathustra&quot; performed originally in London and later at the Edinburgh Festival. &quot;Cluub Zarathustra&quot; featured Stewart Lee, Kevin Eldon, Sally Phillips, Johnny Vegas, Julian Barratt, Richard Herring, Roger Mann, Jason Freeman and the music of Richard Thomas and Loré Lixenberg. A television pilot was made of Cluub Zarathustra for Channel 4 in 1996, but was never broadcast. It became the subject of a book by Robert Wringham in 2012.

Munnery&#x27;s Edinburgh Fringe shows include &quot;Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Buckethead&quot; and &quot;Simon Munnery&#x27;s Annual General Meeting&quot;.
His reoccurring 2004-09 Edinburgh Fringe show, &quot;AGM&quot;, included the opportunity for the audience to raise questions to discuss as group (such as &quot;is there a God?&quot;). The experience would often continue after the main show, when he takes the audience on tours around town, taking in art galleries, drinks and visits to other shows.

In 2010, Munnery hosted a Bright Club event at the Bloomsbury Theatre.

In 2018, Munnery performed at Bluedot Festival at Jodrell Bank, Cheshire.

=== Television ===

&quot;Futurtv&quot; (&quot;Not &#x27;Future TV&#x27;, oh no. It can&#x27;t be &#x27;Future TV&#x27; – it&#x27;s right now!&quot;) was a BBC production for UK Play from 1999. There were 13 15-minute episodes. As well as Simon Munnery, it included &quot;Kombat Opera Presents&quot; (Loré Lixenberg and Richard Thomas) and a selection of pop videos.

Munnery wrote and hosted the 1999 TV comedy game show, &quot;Either/Or&quot;.

&quot;Attention Scum!&quot; was a television series produced for the BBC and directed by Stewart Lee, which aired from February 2001. It starred Munnery as &#x27;The League Against Tedium&#x27;, a character who drove around the United Kingdom in an adapted transit van, preaching to the masses with the help of an opera singer (Loré Lixenberg), a sedated vampire (Richard Thomas), and a monkey (Munnery&#x27;s wife Janet).

Munnery also appeared in sketches in the first series of &quot;Stewart Lee&#x27;s Comedy Vehicle&quot; in 2009, and in Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Alternative Comedy Experience&quot; for Comedy Central.

=== Radio ===
During the 1990s he made several series for BBC Radio 1, one based around his &quot;League Against Tedium&quot; character. Others were vehicles for his Alan Parker character, including &quot;Alan Parker&quot;, &quot;Alan Parker&#x27;s 29 Minutes of Truth&quot;, and &quot;Alan Parker, Road Warrior&quot; for which he won the Sony Radio Award.

Munnery has returned to radio in the early 2000s, hosting &quot;Simon Munnery&#x27;s Experimental Half Hour&quot; (&quot;experimental in that it lasts an hour&quot;) and &quot;Simon Munnery Weakly Chats&quot; on Resonance FM. He also wrote and performed two four-part Radio 4 series called &quot;Where Did It All Go Wrong?&quot;, which were broadcast in the summer of 2003 and the spring of 2005.

In 1999, together with John Hegley, he made a comedy series for BBC Radio 4 called &quot;The Adventures of John and Tony&quot;.

Munnery featured as a &quot;genius&quot; on Dave Gorman&#x27;s &quot;Genius&quot; show on Radio 4.

== Other works ==

Munnery has several CDs available: &quot;Alan Parker – Blast From The Past&quot; (featuring Stewart Lee on guitar and Al Murray on drums), &quot;Simon Munnery&#x27;s Experimental Half Hour&quot; (2 CDs from the Resonance FM radio show of the same name), &quot;AGM&quot; recorded live at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2003, and &quot;BucketHead: Phenomenon Anon And On&quot; and &quot;Mr Bartlett &amp; Mr Willis&quot; (2011) written and co-performed by Kevin Eldon.

In 2007, Simon appeared as Alan Parker on a music track by The Orb called &quot;Grey Clouds&quot;, a take off of their earlier track &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot;. It features on the Annie Nightingale album &quot;Y4K&quot; on Distinct&#x27;ive Records.

Two DVDs of his work were released in 2007 – the first &quot;IAMTV&quot;, covering his Perrier Award nominated show from the 1999 Edinburgh Fringe, was closely followed by &quot;Hello&quot; produced by Go Faster Stripe, a more recent stand-up performance.

In the 1990s, he regularly contributed a column to &quot;NME&quot; as &quot;Alan Parker: Urban Warrior&quot;.

In 2009, Munnery starred in an award-winning animated rotoscope short, titled &quot;Yellow Belly End&quot;, co-written and directed by Philip Bacon, a student of the National Film and Television School. In the nine-minute film, Munnery appears in a bird costume and contemplates a cliff. He is credited as &quot;Bird&quot;.

In 2017, Munnery was interviewed by fellow comedian Stuart Goldsmith for his podcast the &quot;Comedian&#x27;s Comedian&quot;. They discussed the inspiration for some of Munnery&#x27;s ground breaking characters amongst other topics.

In 2020, artist Andy Holden curated a retrospective of the artwork of Munnery, titled &#x27;What Am I?&#x27; It was first shown at Ex-Baldessarre, Bedford, and then toured to Stroud Valley Art Space.

<text>James H. Korris is an American game designer. His work is known in game-based simulation for military training. He served as Creative Director of the Institute for Creative Technologies (Institute), University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles from its founding in August 1999 until October 2006. 
He is the lifetime member of Writers Guild of America.

== Education ==
Korris earned his undergraduate degree in economics at Yale University and was awarded an MBA with distinction at the Harvard Business School.

== Career ==
At the institute, Korris worked with talents as diverse as John Milius, Randal Kleiser and David Ayer The initial $44.5 million contract grew substantially as basic research in immersive virtual reality and prototype application development was expanded.

Dubbed &quot;The Military Entertainment Complex&quot;, the modern collaboration of Hollywood and the Department of Defense at the institute was first discussed in a National Research Council study published in 1997.

At USC, Korris led projects including Full Spectrum Warrior, the first military application developed for Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox, along with desktop training simulations Full Spectrum Command, Full Spectrum Leader, the Joint Fires and Effects Trainer System and the Department of Defense 2006 Modeling &amp; Simulation Award-winner Every Soldier a Sensor Simulation.

Korris also led USC Institute work in Concept Development and Visualization, a process that brought Hollywood story-telling and production techniques to military informational films. Work included the award-winning video &quot;Nowhere To Hide&quot;, the US Army/Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency vision of America&#x27;s future, transformed land force. His team supported the US Army&#x27;s Future Combat Systems critical Block B review which resulted in approval of the $14.7 billion System Development &amp; Design phase of the program.

Korris&#x27; work at USC was recognized in the 2006 Smithsonian Institution-Cooper Hewitt Design Life Now 2006 National Design Triennial. He was a featured speaker at Richard Saul Wurman&#x27;s 2006 Entertainment Gathering, eg2006. Korris was also designated a Massive Change Visionary in Bruce Mau&#x27;s Massive Change exhibit in October 2004.

In 2007, Korris was appointed to the Naval Research Advisory Committee, the senior scientific advisory group to the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations, Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Chief of Naval Research. In 2008, he was named to lead a US Marine Corps study on virtual simulation training for ground forces.

In October 2006, Korris launched Creative Technologies Incorporated (CTI) as a direct outgrowth of his work at USC. CTI efforts include a large-format, mobile simulation project for the Future Combat Systems program and concept development and content production for The Boeing Company&#x27;s Space Segment Design Review for Transformational SATCOM.

Korris came to USC following work in Hollywood studio production, producing and writing. He began with several creative executive positions at Universal Television, moving on to serve as a staff producer for Ron Howard and Brian Grazer&#x27;s Imagine Films.

Friends Rick Berman and Maurice Hurley (Co-Executive Producer) named character Captain Korris after him in the episode &quot;Heart of Glory&quot;. He executive produced Showtime/Paramount&#x27;s &quot;The Killing Yard&quot; which won the 2003 American Bar Association Silver Gavel. He is a member of the writers&#x27; branch of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, the Writers Guild of America, the Writers Guild of Canada and the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.

<doc id="800911" wikidata="Q4656002" url="?curid=800911" title="A Cold Wind Blows (game)">
<text>A Cold Wind Blows or The Big Wind Blows is a noncompetitive substitute for the game of musical chairs. It was developed in the 1970s as part of the New Games movement, developed by Andrew Fluegelman and colleagues.
==Background==
The game of musical chairs is often played by children at parties. The Big Wind Blows is a fairly similar game, and is explained below.

==Rules==
The game involves the same device of a competitive scramble for chairs, but restructures the play elements to provide a different game experience. 

A set of chairs, one less than the number of players, is arranged in a circle. One player is initially designated as &quot;it.&quot; The person who is &quot;it&quot; stands in the center of the circle; while all other players sit on the chairs. In each round of play, the person who is &quot;it&quot; calls out any sentence, beginning with the words &quot;The Big Wind Blows,&quot; that refers to one or more players. For example:

*&quot;The big wind blows if you have a dog.&quot;
*&quot;The big wind blows if your name begins with a vowel.&quot;
*&quot;The big wind blows if you play a sport.&quot;

All of the players for whom the big wind blows—that is, players that fall into the named category—must vacate the chair that they are in and attempt to find another seat. At the same time, &quot;it&quot; attempts to sit in a chair. When all chairs are occupied, the person who failed to get a chair becomes &quot;it&quot; for the next round.

==Benefits==
In &quot;The Big Wind Blows,&quot; no player is ever eliminated and the game can proceed for as long as players are interested in playing. For the player who loses in the scramble, the negative experience is immediately followed by the positive experience of becoming &quot;it&quot; and thus controlling the next round of the game. Finally, the person who is &quot;it&quot; has the advantage of knowing the time of the scramble, exactly which chairs will be vacated, and a short distance to a vacant chair, so the person who is &quot;it&quot; usually finds a chair. Thus players typically become &quot;it&quot; for only one round at a time. Players rarely experience the frustration of losing many consecutive scrambles. No player remains &quot;it&quot; and dominates the game for long. Finally, the challenge of having to invent new categories—this is not usually stated as a rule but most players feel that they must do so—tends to mean that different people participate in each scramble, and most players participate in frequent scrambles and get turns of becoming &quot;it.&quot;

The game is very stable in the sense that it is not spoiled even if &quot;it&quot; deliberately chooses categories that contain a single selected person. (When this happens, the usual outcome is that &quot;it&quot; successfully grabs the selected person&#x27;s seat while the selected person becomes &quot;it&quot;). Indeed, the balance of frustration and reward is so even that nobody is ever sure whether having &quot;the big wind blow&quot; for a single person is an expression of rivalry or of affection.

The game combines the physical elements of the scramble with the mental requirements of alertness, logic, and reasoning in the construction of the categories.

Groups of children, even children of mixed age and agility, can play this game for long periods of time without becoming frustrated or angry.

<doc id="800920" wikidata="Q4468609" url="?curid=800920" title="Somalia affair">
<text>The Somalia affair was a 1993 Canadian military scandal, prompted by the beating to death of Shidane Arone, a Somali teenager, at the hands of two Canadian peacekeepers participating in humanitarian efforts in Somalia. The act was documented by photos, and brought to light internal problems in the Canadian Airborne Regiment. Military leadership were sharply rebuked after a CBC reporter received altered documents, leading to allegations of a cover-up. The Somalia affair tarnished Canada&#x27;s international reputation in what was heralded as &quot;the darkest era in the history of the Canadian military&quot;.

Eventually a public inquiry was called. Despite being cut short by the government, resulting in a public backlash, the Somalia Inquiry exposed problems in the Canadian Forces. The affair led to the disbanding of Canada&#x27;s elite Canadian Airborne Regiment, greatly damaging the morale of the Canadian Forces. It also led to the immediate reduction of Canadian military spending by nearly 25% from the time of the killing to the inquiry.

==Background==
In 1992, Somalia was in the middle of both famine and a civil war. The country was under domination by warlords, following the collapse of Siad Barre&#x27;s government. Relief supplies were frequently stolen by armed gangs, who would hold the goods hostage for the loyalty of the population. As a result, the United Nations requested armed peacekeepers to assist the relief operations.

In the summer of 1992, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney committed Canada to United Nations Operation in Somalia I (UNOSOM I). Canada was being pressured to make this decision because in the past it had aggressively engaged in Yugoslavia in 1992 and had reached out to Balkan refugees later that year. The heightened media coverage on Somalia had also put more pressure on the Canadian government to mobilize a peacekeeping effort. Thanks to the Mulroney government&#x27;s desire to improve conflict resolution mechanisms and for its natural interest in multilateralism and peacekeeping, Canada found the Somali Civil War to fit its foreign policy priorities. Mulroney was himself a &quot;Pearsonian&quot; and a multilateralist who had a great deal of confidence in the United Nations. Canadian diplomat Geoffrey Pearson argued that &quot;effective multilateral arrangements provide a means to exert influence on major allies and powerful neighbours as well as help maintain peace&quot;. Mulroney&#x27;s notion of new internationalism coupled with this notion of multilateralism would see intervention as a moral imperative in cases of intrastate disorder and large-scale human rights abuse. He commented that it would be ideal for the United Nations to become still more effective and more of an actor in international affairs.

Contributing to the US-led coalition and taking part in the UN force to Somalia seemed to align with Canadian foreign policy and fit Mulroney&#x27;s vision for peacekeeping, as he was the &quot;principal driver behind Canada&#x27;s decision to commit itself to the Somalia mission&quot;.

Canada was one of the nations that agreed to send forces. Canadian forces, under the name Operation Deliverance, were sent to Somalia to participate in the American-led Operation Restore Hope. On 4 May 1993, the operation was to come under UN command and was renamed UNOSOM II.

It was decided that the Canadian Airborne Regiment (CAR) would be the contingent sent overseas. The Airborne had long been seen as the elite of the Canadian Forces, and in 1974 had performed admirably in combat operations in Cyprus as well as later peacekeeping tours there. However, General Beno informed General Lewis MacKenzie that training in the CAR was a &quot;critical&quot; problem due to Lieutenant Colonel Paul Morneault&#x27;s leadership. It was debated whether to substitute another regiment, or cancel the mission entirely, but it was finally decided that to admit that the &quot;elite&quot; Canadian forces were incapable of handling a routine mission would have been a &quot;national disgrace&quot;.

==Canadian Airborne Regiment==

Only recently deemed a light infantry battalion, some leaders expressed concern that the Somalia mission did not fit the Regiment&#x27;s mandate or abilities. The Airborne consisted of multiple sub-units drawn from each of Canada&#x27;s regular infantry regiments. Later, LCol. Kenward suggested that the line regiments had offloaded some of their &quot;bad apples&quot; into the CAR. LCol. Morneault, the commanding officer of the CAR, declared the &quot;rogue commando&quot; unit unfit for service abroad and sought to have it remain in Canada. Instead, he was relieved of his command and replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Carol Mathieu.

There had been recurring discipline problems, and an ongoing investigation into their base of CFB Petawawa as a hotbed of white supremacist activity in 2 Commando. This included the adoption of the confederate flag as the commando&#x27;s barracks-room decoration. The flag had initially been presented as a gift from American soldiers, and gradually became an unofficial symbol, although successive commanding officers had tried to ban its usage.

Footage depicting racist actions of Cpl. McKay and Pte. Brocklebank was later brought forward by Scott Taylor, who hoped to expose systematic problems in the military and exonerate his friend Kyle Brown. In the video, McKay utters racial slurs, and pre-deployment photographs showed him wearing a Hitler shirt in front of a swastika. A video taken by CAR soldiers shows Brocklebank making racist and violent remarks.

Mike Abel, the only Canadian to die in the Somali operation, was allegedly a member of the Ku Klux Klan; colleagues disputed the evidence that racist literature had been found in his belongings, and asserted that it just floated around the camp and everybody read it.

==Airborne in Somalia==
The CAR was deployed in December 1992 as part of the Unified Task Force. It was accompanied by a helicopter squadron and a squadron of the Royal Canadian Dragoons. Although they were planning to deploy to the comparatively quiet port city of Bosaso, four days after arriving in Somalia commander Serge Labbé informed them that consultation with the Americans meant they would be moving to the southern town of Belet Huen, considered one of the more difficult areas to patrol.

One of the Dragoons&#x27; first tasks, under command of Sgt. Donald Hobbs, was rebuilding a bridge that had been destroyed on the Chinese Highway linking Belet Huen and Matabaan. The loss of the bridge meant the only way around was through a partially cleared minefield.

On January 2, Canadian forces seized an AK-47 from a local Somali who returned the following day with a machete to threaten the troops to give him back his gun; a warning shot was fired and ricocheted, hitting him in the foot. He left, refusing medical care. Also in January 1993, Lt.-Col. Carol Mathieu gave verbal orders allowing Canadian soldiers to shoot at thieves under certain conditions. On January 29, suspected bandits were found congregating on a roadway and as Canadian forces approached them, they began to flee. Warning shots were fired into the air to halt them, leading to a retaliatory shot from a Somali, and returned fire from the Canadian troops.

On February 10, they fired on a crowd approaching a Red Cross distribution centre.

On February 17, a demonstration of 50–300 Somalis crowded together on the Bailey bridge over the Shebelle River, and when some began throwing rocks at the Canadian Forces, soldiers fired two shotgun blasts, killing one Somali and injuring two others. A later investigation cleared the shooters of any wrongdoing; noting they were justified in their response.

By the end of the mission, no Canadian troops had been killed or wounded by enemy forces, the sole casualties arising when a soldier shot himself in the arm while cleaning his sidearm on January 11, and when MCpl. Tony Smith negligently discharged his rifle, fatally wounding Cpl. Abel on May 3, 1993.

==March 4 killing==
On March 4, two unarmed Somalis were shot in the back, one fatally, after Canadian troops laid an ambush to try to catch petty thieves stealing from the military base in Belet Huen. This followed from a decision by Captain Michel Rainville to re-label petty theft by Somalis as &quot;sabotage&quot;, a distinction that meant deadly force could be used to defend the base. Rainville relied on the argument that a fuel pump used to service American MedEvac helicopters had been stolen deliberately to hinder the military effort, while critics pointed out that any saboteurs likely would have ignited the thousands of gallons of fuel surrounding it.

After Warrant Officer Marsh discovered the missing fuel pump, he suggested installing a large searchlight atop a tower to deter thieves. He was dismissed by Rainville, who suggested that the idea was not to deter thieves, but to catch them in the act using night vision. Rainville ordered that food and water be placed in a trailer at the south end of the compound, visible to Somalis walking past on the nearby road. Some soldiers alleged this constituted &quot;bait&quot;, but Rainville later defended himself saying it had been to distinguish between thieves and saboteurs to prevent shooting thieves.

Rainville enlisted Cpl. Ben Klick of the PPCLI to lie in a truckbed at night, awaiting potential &quot;saboteurs&quot; with a C3A1 rifle. From his position, he watched two Somalis, Ahmed Arush and Abdi Hunde Bei Sabrie, approach the food and water. Fifteen minutes after first noticing the pair, the thieves began to run from the base in fear they had been noticed; Rainville yelled at them to &quot;stop&quot;, and called to Sgt. Plante, Cpl. King and Cpl. Favasoli to &quot;get them&quot;. Plante fired with his shotgun, while King fired with his C7; Plante&#x27;s shot wounded Sabrie, who fell to the ground, while Arush kept running back towards the roadway. Cpl Leclerc and MCpl Countway both shot at him as he ran, while Cpl. Klick refrained, noting that the man presented no risk to Canadian forces. Arush fell to the ground, hit by one of the two men&#x27;s shots. He struggled to stand up, but both men fired again, killing him.

It was noted that Sabrie had been carrying a ceremonial dagger in his clothing. When the unit was ordered to bring the body of Arush to the same position as Sabrie, the soldiers radioed back that they could not move the body without it falling apart. So the body of Arush was loaded into a body bag and placed inside a Bison personnel carrier. There, medical technician MCpl Petersen re-opened the bag and took Polaroid photographs for an unknown reason, some suggest to document the shooting, others suggest as a &quot;trophy&quot;. The photos showed gaping wounds in Arush&#x27;s neck and the side of his face, with his skull twisted out of shape by the force of the gunblast. His intestines protruded from his stomach, and his right eye was missing.

An Air Force flight surgeon, Major Barry Armstrong, examined the body and judged the death &quot;suspicious&quot;, suggesting that Arush had been lying prone on the ground when he was killed. He also noted that the amount of omentum which had passed through the first wounds suggested the 29-year-old Arush had been breathing for at least 2 or 3 minutes before the final gunshots to his head were fired.

After the examination, Arush&#x27;s body was then used for medical practice for soldiers, demonstrating how to stab a tracheotomy into a wounded man&#x27;s throat to allow him to breathe, and then used to demonstrate the proper preparation of a body for transportation. The body was then returned to the body bag, and sent into the local hospital, where Dr. Xelen released it to Arush&#x27;s family the same evening. For the next two weeks, Colonel Allan Wells approached Vice-Admiral Larry Murray to send military police to Somalia to investigate the shooting, but was rebuffed. When the Chief of Defence Staff, Admiral John Rogers Anderson, visited the military base on March 8–9, he visited the wounded Somali recovering in the Canadian hospital.

The event would not have been reported, except that Member of Parliament John Brewin read out an anonymous letter he had received from a soldier about witnessing the &quot;execution&quot; of a Somali civilian on March 4.

At the subsequent inquiry, Klick defended Rainville, heavily criticising his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Carol Mathieu, and testified that American Special Forces Chief Warrant Officer Jackson had interrogated the wounded Somali who confessed to being a saboteur, although this contradicted all other evidence, including the statements of the American soldier who never mentioned any interrogation. In 1994, the Ministry of Defence engaged in an undercover attempt to discredit Armstrong&#x27;s findings, phoning Allan Thompson of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and offering to leak to him the pathology report by James Ferris conducted two months after the killing, which found the decomposing body showed none of the signs Armstrong had suggested. Thompson took his evidence of a preconceived &quot;leak&quot; from the Ministry to the subsequent inquiry, where they added weight to Armstrong&#x27;s findings. While his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Carol Mathieu described Armstrong as bordering on insanity at the inquiry, the only evidence he produced was that he liked to climb onto the roof of the hospital at night in Somalia and watch the stars.

==Torture and death of Shidane Arone==
On March 16, 1993, Captain Michael Sox found 16-year-old Shidane Abukar Arone hiding in a portable toilet in an abandoned American base across from the Canadian base in Belet Huen. Believing he was attempting to sneak into the Canadian base to steal supplies, Sox turned him over to another soldier, who led the teenager to a bunker being used to house munitions. Arone protested, saying he had simply been trying to find a lost child.

At 21:00, Sgt. Mark Boland replaced Master Corporal Clayton Matchee as guard of the prisoner, and ordered his foot bindings be removed and replaced with fetters, as the ropes were too tight. Warrant Officer Murphy took the opportunity to kick Arone &quot;savagely&quot;, which was later taken to be implicit permission to abuse the prisoner. At this time, Matchee began his abuse of Arone by removing the captive&#x27;s clothing and using it to crudely waterboard the youth until Boland objected, and Matchee left the bunker.

At 22:00, Trooper Kyle Brown took over guard duty, and brought Matchee back with him. Brown punched Arone in the jaw, and was told by Boland, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what you do, just don&#x27;t kill the guy&quot;, to which Brown replied that he wanted to &quot;kill this fucker&quot;. Boland then joined Matchee and Matt McKay for beers in the mess hall, where Matchee spoke about what he wanted to do to Arone, and suggested he might put out cigarette butts on his feet. McKay suggested that Matchee might use a ration pack or phone book to beat the youth, as it would not leave any traces.

Matchee and Brown, both members of 2 Commando, then proceeded to beat Arone. Matchee used a ration pack to beat the youth, as well as a broomstick, and raped the teenager with it. Brown participated in the abuse, but was primarily an observer and took sixteen &quot;trophy photos&quot; of the beating, including one of Matchee forcing Arone&#x27;s mouth open with a baton, and one of himself holding Pte. David Brocklebank&#x27;s loaded pistol to Arone&#x27;s head. At about 23:20, Master Cpl. Giasson entered the bunker. Matchee showed him the semi-conscious and bleeding Arone, and boasted that &quot;in Canada we cannot do that, and here they let us do it&quot;.

Estimates have ranged that 15–80 other soldiers could hear or observe the beating, but did not intervene. Corporal MacDonald, acting as duty signaller that night, was asked by Sgt. Major Mills about &quot;a long dragged out howl&quot; heard from the vicinity of the bunker, but MacDonald refused to stop playing with his Game Boy to investigate. Later, Matchee came by to borrow a cigarette from MacDonald and mentioned that &quot;now the black man would fear the Indian as he did the white man&quot; (Matchee was a Saskatchewan Cree), and MacDonald went outside to check on Arone&#x27;s status. He saw Matchee hitting him in the face with the baton, and reported that the prisoner was &quot;getting a good shit-kicking&quot; to Sgt. Perry Gresty, before retiring to bed for the night.

Arone fell unconscious after several hours of beatings, after shouting &quot;Canada! Canada! Canada!&quot; as his last words. When Brown mentioned the event to Sergeant J. K. Hillier, the non-commissioned member noted there &quot;would be trouble&quot; if the prisoner died, and went to check on the youth who he found had no pulse, and base medics confirmed that the boy was dead. It was later discovered that Arone had burn marks on his penis.

==Response==
Jim Day, a reporter with the &quot;Pembroke Observer&quot; local newspaper from the regiment&#x27;s hometown, was on the base at the time and was the first to report that Canadian soldiers were being held pending an investigation into the death of a Somali citizen.

The debate over what led to the events came at a politically sensitive time in Canada, as the Minister of National Defence Kim Campbell was in the midst of a Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leadership campaign to become prime minister. Matters were made worse when Campbell tried to dismiss the allegations of racism in the Canadian military by referring to it as &quot;youthful folly&quot; and suggesting that it was commonplace. Criticism also focused on the fact that it took five weeks to order a high-level investigation into the events in Somalia.

Some, including Member of Parliament John Cummins, quickly pointed out that three of the four men facing the most serious charges had been given experimental injections of &quot;Lariam&quot;, a brand-name of mefloquine, to test its effects on combatting malaria in a controlled study group. The drug was known to cause paranoia, lack of judgment, neurosis and other mental side effects, and some have suggested it bore some responsibility for the soldiers&#x27; actions. Dr. Michele Brill-Edwards had actually resigned in protest from Health Canada over her belief that the drug could produce &quot;dangerous psychiatric reactions&quot; in the soldiers.

==Legal proceedings==

A death in custody automatically triggered an investigation, and two days later Matchee and Brown were arrested and charged and National Defence Headquarters was advised.

Matchee later attempted to hang himself in his cell; the attempt failed but caused massive brain damage, making him unfit to stand trial.&#x27;

==McAuliffe&#x27;s request for documents==
In September 1995, CBC reporter Michael McAuliffe requested access to 68 Response to Query forms to supplement his earlier informal gleanings about the Canadian military operation, but the documents were altered before being released to him to make them agree with the information he had been given earlier. In addition, invented financial charges were tagged onto his request, stating that it had taken 413 man-hours and subsequently would cost McAuliffe $4,080, although the documents were in fact readily available.

While giving McAuliffe misinformation informally was not illegal, it was a crime under s. 67.1 of the &quot;Access to Information Act&quot; for the government to release forged documents in response to an Access to Information request. The question quickly emerged of whether Chief of Defence Staff Jean Boyle had known about the altering, and if he bore responsibility for it even if he were ignorant of his underlings&#x27; doings. On September 5, 1995, a clerk at the NDHQ was discovered collecting Somalia-related documents for a burn bag to be destroyed. Boyle later concurred that there had been documents proving attempts to cover up details of both the March 4 and March 16 killings.

==Somalia Inquiry==

The public outcry against Arone&#x27;s death didn&#x27;t occur until November 1994, when a publication ban was lifted against the 16 photographs Brown had taken of the torture session and they were widely published in Canadian media.

After the 1993 Canadian federal election, the new government of Jean Chrétien&#x27;s Liberal Party initiated a highly visible Somalia Inquiry in 1994 under Federal Court Judge Gilles Létourneau. Officially known as the Somalia Commission of Inquiry, its hearings were broadcast daily in both languages, nationally.

As the inquiry unfolded, home videos of initiation rites in the CAR&#x27;s French-speaking commando found their way into the media. The new Minister of National Defence David Collenette argued that the videos were disgusting, demeaning and racist. With the continued accumulation of such politically damaging visibility, the Minister of National Defence advised Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to disband the Canadian Airborne Regiment in 1995.

The Chief of the Defence Staff General John de Chastelain, who had not supported the minister&#x27;s disbandment order of the Airborne, resigned under a cloud. His successor, Air Force General Jean Boyle was forced to resign only a few months after accepting the role when, in a gesture uncharacteristic of military tradition, he blamed his subordinates for previous wrongdoing under his command.

On April 8, 1996, Boyle called a halt to all normal duties and announced the entire Canadian military would begin searching for documents relating to Somalia.

The inquiry ran until 1997 when it was cut short by the government in the months before the 1997 election. The government was critical of the direction of the inquiry, claiming that it was far exceeding its mandate. Art Eggleton, a member of Cabinet who would go on to become minister of national defence after the 1997 election, suggested that the events had happened four years earlier, and it was time to &quot;move on&quot;.

Indeed, the conduct of the new government after the Somalia affair and the search for documents now absorbed much of the inquiry&#x27;s attention, as reflected in its report. The inquiry had run long over its allotted timeframe and budget. The decision to end the inquiry received visible media attention and may have contributed to the defeat of the new Defence Minister Doug Young in the 1997 election. The inquiry was never able to examine top level governmental decision-making, nor did it actually examine the alleged events in Somalia.

The final report of the inquiry was a striking attack on the procedures, support and leadership of the Canadian Forces and the Ministry of Defence. Many of the top officers in the Canadian Forces were excoriated, including three separate Chiefs of the Defence Staff. The CAR had been rushed into a war zone with inadequate preparation or legal support. Enquiry observer retired Brigadier-General Dan Loomis noted that the operation had changed, in December 1992, &quot;from a peacekeeping operation, where arms are used only in self-defence, to one where arms could be used proactively to achieve politico-military objectives ... In short the Canadian Forces were being put on active service and sent to war (as defined by Chapter 7 of the UN Charter).&quot; Its deployment into &quot;war&quot; had never been debated in parliament and indeed the Canadian public had been led to believe by its government that the CAR was on a &quot;peacekeeping&quot; mission. After the events the leaders of the Canadian Forces had been far more concerned with self-preservation than in trying to find the truth. The inquiry report singled out Major-General Lewis MacKenzie as a major exception, as he took full responsibility for any errors he made.

==Aftermath==
The affair had a number of long-lasting effects. While it is difficult to separate the effects of the affair on Canadian Forces morale from those of the concurrent defence spending cut, it did exacerbate feelings of distrust towards the media and politicians among many CF members.

At the same time, public trust in the Canadian Forces suffered and recruitment became more difficult. Public revulsion provided support for the sharp cuts to military spending introduced by the government. Many of the report&#x27;s comments, along with the sustained media criticism of the military, led to the imposition of policies designed to ensure nothing similar to the Somalia Affair could happen again. Since the events in Somalia, Canada focused on implementing more educational requirements (including ethics, tactical, and strategic planning), oversight processes, and setting new standards and policies for senior officers. Once playing an important role in the majority of UN efforts, in subsequent years Canada simply provided indirect support. Since 2001 though, spending on the Canadian Forces gradually increased and accelerated as Canada played a major role in Afghanistan. Concurrently public perception of the Canadian Forces improved dramatically as well.

In 1999, judge J. Douglas Cunningham dismissed an appeal for financial compensation by Arone&#x27;s parents Abubakar Arone Rage and Dahabo Omar Samow, ruling that their use of a litigation guardian, Abdullahi Godah Barre, was inconsistent with the legal requirement, and they should have traveled to Canada to launch the suit themselves.

Brown later co-operated on a book in which it was suggested he had been made the scapegoat for the incident, unlike the officers who had not intervened.

Soldiers of other countries also faced charges of misconduct; American soldiers were involved in the deaths of three young boys in separate incidents, Pakistani troops were accused of a number of civilian deaths, and Belgian soldiers took photographs of themselves allegedly torturing a Somali to death.

Other long-term effects on the Forces included the adoption of sensitivity training, including SHARP (Standard for Harassment and Racism Prevention) training, which became mandatory for every single member of the Forces, and was accompanied by a declaration of &quot;zero tolerance&quot; on racism and harassment of any kind, including hazing.

Some have suggested that Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Joseph Philip Robert Murray was slated to be replaced, until Boyle was removed – making it difficult for the Prime Minister to simultaneously replace the head of the armed forces and the head of the federal police.

==Peacekeeping and humanitarian intervention in the wake of the Somalia affair==
The notion of peacekeeping seems to be deeply embedded in Canadian culture and a distinguishing feature that Canadians feel sets their foreign policy apart from the likes of the United States. The Somalia commission wrote in 1997 that &quot;Canada&#x27;s foreign policy with respect to peacekeeping has been consistent since Canadians embraced peacekeeping in the late 1950s&quot;. Since the Suez Crisis, Canadian foreign policy has fit a peacekeeping rubric. Americans, however, were seen to fight wars, but Canadians pictured themselves as working for peace. Canada never had a reputation for starting wars but instead was seen to come to the aid of war-torn countries.

The Somalia affair came as such as surprise to the Canadian public as no one would have thought Canada&#x27;s golden reputation for international peacekeeping could be tarnished. The Somalia Affair and the ensuing commission of inquiry has become the subject of intense criticism and has given rise to a great deal of comparative theoretical work on humanitarian intervention and peacekeeping. In her book Sherene Razack asks if it was just a case of &quot;a few bad apples&quot; in the Canadian forces, or if the Somalia affair speaks to a larger issue on the complex nature of peacekeeping and humanitarian intervention. Thomas Weiss comments that the failures in Somalia have led to this concept of &quot;Somalia syndrome&quot;: &quot;multilateral interventions to thwart starvation, genocide, the forced movement of peoples, and massive violations of fundamental rights are no longer politically or operationally feasible”. Peacekeepers are more likely to be involved in peace enforcement in more warlike conditions as unlike traditional peacekeeping; there is not always consent from all the conflicting parties. Such was the case in Somalia as the men were hypervigilant with a sense of fear and frustration as they were trained for combat yet charged with providing humanitarian aid. Faced with this strong Somali opposition and resentment and yet being responsible for providing aid meant that Canadian peacekeepers &quot;increasingly could not find meaning in their activities&quot;. A &quot;Somalia syndrome&quot; sentiment lingered in the international community after the failures in the war-torn country. Weiss, however, reminds us not to take Somalia out of context or draw upon the wrong lessons leading to isolationism or eschewing necessary humanitarian intervention. The debacle in Somalia would be so paralyzing that it would lead to an unwillingness from the international community to respond to future problems, like the Rwandan genocide. The United States under the Clinton administration would need to rethink its foreign policies and the rest of the world just did not want another Somalia affair.

The Somalia affair thus had a direct impact on how the international community made foreign policy with a crippling &quot;Somalia syndrome&quot; that led to the sense of caution in intervening in the Rwanda genocide and in the Balkans.

<text>George Joseph Stigler (; January 17, 1911 – December 1, 1991) was an American economist. He was the 1982 laureate in Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and is considered a key leader of the Chicago school of economics.

== Early life and education ==
Stigler was born in Seattle, Washington, the son of hungarian Elsie Elizabeth (Erzsébet Hungler, born in Bakonypéterd, Veszprém county, Kingdom of Hungary) and bavarian Joseph Stigler. He was of German and Hungarian descent and spoke German in his childhood. He graduated from the University of Washington in 1931 with a B.A. and then spent a year at Northwestern University, from which he obtained his MBA in 1932. It was during his studies at Northwestern that Stigler developed an interest in economics and decided on an academic career.

After he received a tuition scholarship from the University of Chicago, Stigler enrolled there in 1933 to study economics and went on to earn his PhD in economics in 1938.

== Career ==
Stigler taught at Iowa State College from 1936 to 1938. He spent much of World War II at Columbia University, performing mathematical and statistical research for the Manhattan Project. He then spent one year at Brown University. He served on the Columbia faculty from 1947 to 1958.

At Chicago, he was greatly influenced by Frank Knight, his dissertation supervisor. Milton Friedman, a friend for over 50 years, commented that it was remarkable for Stigler to have passed his dissertation under Knight, as only three or four students had ever managed to do so in Knight&#x27;s 28 years at Chicago. Stigler&#x27;s influences included Jacob Viner and Henry Simons as well as students W. Allen Wallis and Friedman.

Stigler is best known for developing the &quot;Economic Theory of Regulation&quot; (1971), also known as regulatory capture, which says that interest groups and other political participants will use the regulatory and coercive powers of government to shape laws and regulations in a way that is beneficial to them. This theory is a component of the public choice field of economics but is also deeply opposed by public choice scholars belonging to the &quot;Virginia School,&quot; such as Charles Rowley. He also carried out extensive research in the history of economic thought.

Stigler&#x27;s most important contribution to economics was published in his landmark 1961 article, &quot;The Economics of Information.&quot; According to Friedman, Stigler &quot;essentially created a new area of study for economists.&quot; Stigler stressed the importance of information: &quot;One should hardly have to tell academicians that information is a valuable resource: knowledge is power. And yet it occupies a slum dwelling in the town of economics.&quot;

His 1962 article &quot;Information in the Labor Market&quot; developed the theory of search unemployment.

In 1963 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.

He was known for his sharp sense of humor, and he wrote a number of spoof essays. In his book &quot;The Intellectual and the Marketplace&quot;, for instance, he proposed &quot;Stigler&#x27;s Law of Demand and Supply Elasticities&quot;: &quot;all demand curves are inelastic and all supply curves are inelastic too.&quot; The essay referenced studies that found many goods and services to be inelastic over the long run and offered a supposed theoretical proof; he ended by announcing that his next essay would demonstrate that the price system does not exist.

Another essay, &quot;A Sketch on the Truth in Teaching,&quot; described the consequences of a (fictional) set of court decisions that held universities legally responsible for the consequences of teaching errors. The Stigler diet is also named after him.

Stigler wrote numerous articles on the history of economics, published in the leading journals and republished 14 of them in 1965. The &quot;American Economic Review&quot; said, &quot;many of these essays have become such well-known landmarks that no scholar in this field should be unfamiliar with them... The lucid prose, penetrating logic, and wry humor... have become the author&#x27;s trademarks.&quot; However, Deirdre McCloskey has criticised his characterisation of Adam Smith as a father of the &#x27;greed is good&#x27; school of economics as a poor reading of the Scottish philosopher&#x27;s views. 

Stigler was a founding member of the Mont Pelerin Society and was its president from 1976 to 1978. He was a libertarian/classical liberal.

Stigler was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1955, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1975. He received the National Medal of Science in 1987.
==Trivia==
His relative Antal Koppány was famous for achieving a draw against chess champion Bobby Fischer who was himself of hungarian ancestry through his biological father Paul Neményi.

<text>The Kitzbühel Alps ( or &quot;Kitzbühler Alpen&quot;) are a mountain range of the Central Eastern Alps surrounding the town of Kitzbühel in Tyrol, Austria. Geologically they are part of the western slate zone (greywacke zone).

==Location==
Two-thirds of the Kitzbühel Alps lie within the Austrian province of Tyrol, the remaining third is in Salzburg province. They are about long from east to west and 25 to 35 km wide. They extend from the Ziller valley and Tux Alps in the west to the Saalach river and Zell am See on Lake Zell (&quot;Zellersee&quot;) in the east. They are bordered to the south by the Zillertal Alps and the High Tauern mountain range on the other side of the Salzach River, on the north by the Inn River and the Northern Limestone Alps.

The boundary of the region runs along the Salzach valley via Zell am See, where the Salzach swings north, to Saalfelden. Its northern boundary runs from east to west from the Saalfelden basin along the valley of the Leoganger Ache to the Grießen Pass and from there through the Pillersee valley, Leukental and Sölllandl to Wörgl and Kufstein. Its northwestern boundary is formed by the valley of the Inn between Wörgl and Jenbach.

The Kitzbühel Alps are divided by the Kitzbüheler Ache into the Glemmtal Alps in the east (Salzburg) and the Kelchsau Alps in the west. The highest summit in the Kitzbühel Alps is the Kreuzjoch in the southwest of the mountain range northwest of Gerlos at 2558 metres above sea level. The general height of the peaks descends gradually from around 2500 m in the west to around 2000 m in the east. Other important summits are the Western Salzachgeier (2,469 m), the Kröndlhorn (2,444 m), the Großer Rettenstein (2,366 m), the Geißstein (2,363 m), the Wildseeloder (2,118 m), the Großer Beil (2,309 m), the Großer Galtenberg (2,425 m), the Kitzbühler Horn (1,996 m), the Hohe Salve (1,828 m), the Hahnenkamm (1,712 m) and the Schmittenhöhe (1,965 m). Popular mountain destinations on the edge of the Inn valley are the Pölven (1,595 m) and the Gratlspitz (1,899 m).

The Kitzbühel Alps are found in the regions of St. Johann in Tirol, Kitzbühel and its environs, Pillerseetal, Brixental, Wildschönau and Alpbach.

The Kitzbühel Alps Tourist Region only covers part of the geographical Kitzbühel Alps.

The Kitzbühel Alps have relatively few rugged mountain tops and are well suited to walking and skiing. There are several large ski resorts in the area both in the Tyrolean and Salzburg regions. The Dienten Mountains are a geologically-related extension of the mountains to the east. The Pinzgau Ridgeway (&quot;Pinzgauer Höhenweg&quot;) runs through both ranges in an east-west direction. Many ski route and the Saalach Valley Ridgeway (&quot;Saalachtaler Höhenweg&quot;) run through the Kitzbühel Alps.

== Neighbouring ranges ==
The mountain ranges that surround the Kitzbühel Alps are:

* Kaiser Mountains
* Lofer Mountains
* Leogang Mountains

* Salzburg Slate Alps
* Glockner Group
* Granatspitze Group

* Venediger Group
* Zillertal Alps

* Tux Alps
* Brandenberg Alps
== Geology ==
The Kitzbühel Alps belong to the greywacke zone and are mainly composed of slate and phyllites. The mountain top profiles and the cirques are relatively smooth; their slopes mostly green with numerous alpine meadows (&quot;Almwiesen&quot;). Nevertheless, rock formations of limestone and dolomite do occur e.g. on the Großer Rettenstein.

n the western part of the Kitzbühel Alps most of the valleys run in a north-south direction; in the east they are predominantly oriented east-west. The Alpine geographical reason for this is the striking longitudinal trench of the river Salzach. This so-called Tauern Northern Edge Fault (&quot;Tauernnordrand-Störung&quot;) played an important role during Alpine folding and even today forms a distinct landscape and geological boundary with the &quot;three-thousanders&quot; of the High Tauern.

The western border of the mountain range is, petrographically, less clear because here its transition to the &quot;Innsbruck&quot; quartz phyllites is not clear-cut. By contrast, in the northwest and north (Inn valley near Schwaz, Brixental and the Steinernes Meer) the difference between the gently folded slate and the limestone and dolomite rock of the Limestone Alps hits the observer in the eye.

The major rocks of the Kitzbühel Alps divide into two groups by age, the older rocks probably dating to the Ordovician period. For example, the deep underground complex of Wildschönau slate is quite uniform and has no fossils at all, just volcanic deposits. Above it lies weakly metamorphosed volcanic rock, up to 600 metres thick, made up of quartz porphyroids and tuff, mainly in the west (Hohe Salve, Hahnenkamm and Wildseeloder).

Over the porphyroids lie various horizontal beds of slate from the Silurian period that are often clayey-sandy on top. In the vicinity of Kitzbühel itself, Silurian limestones may also be found and, to the west, the grey, coarse-grained Schwaz dolomite which transitions towards the east, near Leogang, into Spielberg dolomite. Also represented is the post-Variscan period, with its Rotliegendes (red slates), and thick sandstones from the &quot;Permoskyth&quot;. All these successive layers of the greywacke zone were probably - together with those of the Northern Limestone Alps - overturned to the northern edge of the Alps during the time of Alpine orogeny from a region of deposition far to the south.

==Sports==
Their mainly gently rolling nature makes the Kitzbühel Alps suitable for alpine farming, hiking and skiing.

== Tourism ==
The Kitzbühel Alps are a very popular tourist destination. In addition to innumerable managed Alpine pastures and inns, there is also a large number of mountain huts belonging to the various Alpine clubs.

* Alpenrose Hut

* Brechhornhaus (private)
* Bürgl Hut (private)

* Erich Sulke Hut
* Erla Hut (private)
* Fritz Hintermayr Hut (private)
* Hochhörndler Hut (private)

* Kobinger Hut (private)
* Oberland Hut
* Pinzgau Hut (Friends of Nature)
* Steinberghaus Inn (&quot;Gasthaus Steinberghaus&quot;)

==Highest peaks==
Their highest peaks are concentrated to the south-western corner and reach rather modest 2,500 m, the highest being the Kreuzjoch at 2,558 metres above sea level. Roughly in the centre of the range lies the famous ski resort of Kitzbühel, the venue of the Hahnenkamm race, one of the most spectacular and well-known ski races in the world.

He was professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Arizona, with a joint appointment with the Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology, and was consulting professor of anthropological sciences at Stanford University. He was the longtime director of the Tucson Garbage Project, which studied trends in discards by field research in Tucson, Arizona, and in landfills elsewhere, pioneering the field now known as garbology.

Rathje received his PhD in anthropology from Harvard University in 1971. His academic interests have been archaeology, early civilizations, modern material culture studies, and Mesoamerica. He first became known as director of the National Geographic-sponsored Cozumel Archaeological Project (Harvard/U of Arizona: Feb–June 1973) --which established Cozumel&#x27;s significance as an Olmec and Mayan port of trade.

With his students at the University of Arizona, Rathje began &quot;Le Projet du Garbàge&quot; in 1973, sorting waste at Tucson&#x27;s landfill. Early results showed that Tucson residents discarded 10 per cent of the food they purchased and that middle-income households wasted more food than the poor or wealthy.

He received the 1990 Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology from the American Association for the Advancement of Science for &quot;his innovative contributions to public understanding of science and its societal impacts by demonstrating with his creative &#x27;Garbage Project&#x27; how the scientific method can document problems and identify solutions.&quot;

Except for several years in the early 2000s, during his tenure at Stanford, Rathje lived in Tucson, Arizona.

<text>Hugo Adolf Eugen Victor Stinnes commonly known as Hugo Stinnes (12 February 1870 – 10 April 1924) was a German industrialist and politician who served as a member of Reichstag from 1920 to 1924 (his death). During the late era of the German Empire and early Weimar Republic, he was considered to be one of the most influential entrepreneurs in Europe.

==Life and career==

=== Early life ===
Stinnes was born in Mülheim, in the Ruhr Valley, North German Confederation. His parents Hermann Hugo (1842–1887) and Adeline Stinnes (1844–1925), and his grandfather, Matthias Stinnes, had founded a modest enterprise in Mülheim.

After passing his graduating examination from a secondary school (&quot;Realschule&quot;), young Stinnes was placed in an office at Koblenz where he received business training. In order to get a practical knowledge of mining, he worked for a few months as a miner at the Wiethe colliery. Then, in 1889, he attended a course of instruction at the &quot;Bergakademie Berlin&quot; (in 1916 merged the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin)). In 1890, he inherited his father&#x27;s coal mining and other financial enterprises.

=== Building a conglomerate ===
Gradually, from working in the coal industry, he purchased his own shipyard. He also began to purchase seagoing vessels as well as river steamers and barges, the latter—especially on the Rhine—on a constantly increasing scale. He next organized an extensive international business in coal, and had 13 steamers trading to and from North Sea, Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Sea ports. They carried coal, wood, grain and iron ore. By the age of 23, Stinnes was heavily invested in the steel industry. He also imported great quantities of English coal and had an agency at Newcastle as well as an interest in some English mines. This led to his establishing branches of his business at Hamburg and at Rotterdam. 

Since its founding in 1898, Stinnes had been on the Board of Directors of the Rheinisch-Westfälisches Elektrizitätswerk Aktiengesellschaft (RWE). He envisioned using the steam from his mines to drive turbines for electricity production. As soon as Stinnes recognized RWE&#x27;s potential he and steel magnate Fritz Thyssen bought shares to become the majority shareholder. The reason for RWE&#x27;s rapid growth were the permits provided by the communities. However, since these concessions were time-limited, he chose to make the communities permanent shareholders, and gave each mayor a car.

=== During the First World War ===
Before World War I, he was the possessor of a significant fortune which was vaguely estimated at several million pounds. He was a director of many of the largest industrial and mining companies of Westphalia, the Rhineland and Luxembourg. Business interests of this magnitude were constantly expanding, and he became interested in numerous subsidiary enterprises, such as tramways and the supply of electric power and light. He was always engaged in founding new companies or amalgamating existing ones. Stinnes managed to maintain an extensive and even a detailed knowledge of the working of all the companies in which he was engaged and, in all of them, to exact zealous and conscientious work from his business subordinates. The secret of his success was vertical integration and an essential unity of direction and coordination of aims in all branches of his enterprises.

When World War I broke out, Stinnes secured an enormous share in the war profits which enlarged the fortunes of the great industrialists. In enemy countries, his enterprises were sequestrated, and his firm at Rotterdam placed on the Allies&#x27; &quot;black list&quot;. But, apart from the regular indemnification paid by the German government, he was richly compensated when he was called in by Erich Ludendorff, as the most competent expert to give advice, to organize the coal and the industrial production of occupied Belgium and to help to set in motion the gigantic production of war material which the German general headquarters demanded.

During the war, Stinnes extended his activities in Hamburg, and in 1916 he bought up the Woermann and the East African steamship lines. In these new undertakings, he became associated with the two greatest German shipping companies, the Hamburg-American Line and the North German Lloyd. His Hamburg interests continued to multiply in something like geometrical progression. He purchased half a dozen landed estates in Saxony to supply timber for pit props. At Flensburg in Schleswig, he secured control of the largest Baltic shipping concern, and proceeded to build a new fleet of ships, christening one of them the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;.

=== Investment in right-wing politics ===

Stinnes&#x27; connection with Ludendorff led to his becoming an influence behind the scenes in German politics. In 1918 he became a founding member of the &quot;Deutsche Volkspartei&quot; (German People&#x27;s Party or DVP), the new electioneering name of the former National Liberal Party. On his initiative, on January 10, 1919, Stinnes conducted a meeting of top representatives of the German economy in revolutionary Berlin and funded Antibolschewistenfonds (Anti-Bolshevist Fund) of the Anti-Bolshevist League, which distributed anti-communist propaganda and financed right wing groups such as the Freikorps. Captain Waldemar Pabst, who was responsible for the murder of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, is said to have been financed through one of his confidants. Already at the end of 1918 he had contributed around 4.4 million Reichsmarks to the financing of the Alfred Hugenberg media empire, which was supposed to carry nationalist propaganda to the population and which later became the nation-wide propaganda machine for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s NSDAP.

In June 1920, after the German Revolution, Stinnes was elected to the Reichstag. He acted as spokesman for German industry towards trade unions and laid the foundation of today&#x27;s system of cooperation between the unions and employers in Germany. The introduction of the eight-hour day is a prime example of it.

Stinnes denounced the Kapp Putsch as a senseless adventure, but at the same time made friendly gestures towards Wolfgang Kapp personally. Substantial support was provided by Stinnes to the NSDAP. It is assumed that it was his donations to the Nazi party treasury that created the financial base of the Beer Hall Putsch.

About the time of his election to the Reichstag, Stinnes began to buy up leading German newspapers, one of his main objects being to organize a solid and powerful bloc of opinion in Germany in support of law and order and the promotion of the highest industrial and commercial efficiency. His newspaper purchases included the &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; in Berlin, formerly the organ of Otto von Bismarck and then of all the succeeding German governments, the &quot;Münchener Neueste Nachrichten&quot; and the &quot;München-Augsburger Zeitung&quot;, the latter being one of the oldest newspapers in Germany. Both of the Munich journals were previously exponents of a very much more democratic trend of opinion than that which came to characterize them under his proprietorship. Ancillary to these acquisitions, Stinnes secured large interests in paper mills in order to make his newspapers independent of the paper market.

=== Later life ===
By the early 1920s, Stinnes was also using his influence in the press to attack the Versailles Treaty. Stinnes used his access to hard foreign currency during the period of inflation in the Weimar Republic to borrow vast sums in Reichsmark, repaying the loans with nearly worthless currency later. This earned him the title of &quot;&quot; (Inflation King). In 1923, the American magazine &quot;Time&quot; called him &quot;The New Emperor of Germany&quot; to describe his far-reaching political influence and wealth.

In the 1920s, Stinnes was embroiled in a legal dispute with Mayer Wilderman. Wilderman, who had been born in Bessarabia (then part of Russia), had set up a series of factories in Germany in 1912. However, at the outbreak of World War I, Stinnes seized the factories and deprived Wilderman of his assets, using the excuse that Wilderman was an &quot;enemy alien&quot;. In 1918, Bessarabia became part of Romania, and Wilderman attempted to recover his assets. However, Stinnes delayed the process by disputing the facts surrounding Wilderman&#x27;s birth, such as accusing Wilderman of forging his birth certificate, and used financial sleight of hand to pretend the assets had in fact been dissipated and, therefore, there was nothing that could be restored. 

Stinnes died in Berlin as a result of a gall bladder operation. Although his financial empire held some 4500 companies and 3000 manufacturing plants, it collapsed within a year of his death. Parts of his empire continued as Stinnes AG (now DB Mobility Logistics), Hugo Stinnes Schiffahrt and RWE, the second-largest energy supplier in Germany.

==Family==
In 1895, Hugo Stinnes married Cläre Wagenknecht; the couple had seven children: Edmund Hugo (1896–1980), Hugo Hermann (1897–1982), Clärenore (1901–1990), Otto (1903–1983), Hilde (1904–1975), Ernst (1911–1986), and Else (1913–1997). Their daughter Clärenore was the first European woman to circumnavigate the world with an automobile in 1929.

His son Edmund Stinnes was a financier who left Germany and gave his home for the Secret Surrender negotiations in 1945 which brought WW2 to an end in Italy.
