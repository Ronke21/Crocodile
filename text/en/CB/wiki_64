<text>A papal conclave is a gathering of the College of Cardinals convened to elect a bishop of Rome, also known as the pope. Catholics consider the pope to be the apostolic successor of Saint Peter and the earthly head of the Catholic Church. It is the oldest historical method of electing a particular head of state (that is, for Vatican City) that remains in use to the present day. The regulations governing papal conclaves were established by Pope John Paul II in his 1996 apostolic constitution &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot;. In its introduction, John Paul II noted: &quot;A careful historical examination confirms both the appropriateness of this institution, given the circumstances in which it originated and gradually took definitive shape, and its continued usefulness for the orderly, expeditious and proper functioning of the election itself, especially in times of tension and upheaval.&quot;

Concerns around political interference led to reforms after the interregnum of 1268–1271 and Pope Gregory X&#x27;s decree during the Second Council of Lyons in 1274 that the cardinal electors should be locked in seclusion () and not permitted to leave until a new pope had been elected. Conclaves are now held in the Sistine Chapel of the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City.

Since the Apostolic Age, the bishop of Rome, like other bishops, has been chosen by the consensus of the clergy and laity of the diocese. The body of electors was more precisely defined when, in 1059, the College of Cardinals was designated the sole body of electors. Since then, other details of the process have developed. In 1970, Pope Paul VI limited the electors to cardinals under 80 years of age in &quot;Ingravescentem aetatem&quot;. The procedures established by Pope John Paul II in &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot; were slightly amended in 2007 and 2013 by Pope Benedict XVI. A two-thirds supermajority vote is required to elect the new pope. The most recent papal conclave occurred in 2013, when Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected as Pope Francis, succeeding the retiring Benedict XVI.

== Historical development ==

The procedures for the election of the pope developed over almost two millennia. Until the College of Cardinals was created in 1059, the bishops of Rome, like those in other areas, were elected by acclamation of the local clergy and people. Procedures similar to the present system were introduced in 1274 when Gregory X promulgated &quot;Ubi periculum&quot; following the action of the magistrates of Viterbo during the interregnum of 1268–1271.

The process was further refined by Gregory XV with his 1621 bull &quot;Aeterni Patris Filius&quot;, which established the requirement of a two-thirds majority of cardinal electors to elect a pope. The Third Lateran Council had initially set the requirement that two-thirds of the cardinals were needed to elect a pope in 1179. This requirement had varied since then, depending on whether the winning candidate was allowed to vote for himself, in which cases the required majority was two-thirds plus one vote. &quot;Aeterni Patris Filius&quot; prohibited this practice and established two-thirds as the standard needed for election. &quot;Aeterni Patris Filius&quot; did not eliminate the possibility of election by acclamation, but did require that a secret ballot take place first before a pope could be elected. Prior to 1621, a cardinal could vote for himself, but it was always with the knowledge and consent of enough of the other voting cardinals, so that he did not make the final decision to make himself pope. (Accessus). Ballots were either signed or initialed in the corner of the ballot, or sometimes coded or numbered. (2006 Motion Picture, &quot;Conclave&quot;, based on the 1458 Conclave.)

=== Electorate ===
As early Christian communities emerged, they elected bishops, chosen by the clergy and laity with the assistance of the bishops of neighbouring dioceses. Cyprian (died 258) says that Pope Cornelius (in office 251–253) was chosen as Bishop of Rome &quot;by the decree of God and of His Church, by the testimony of nearly all the clergy, by the college of aged bishops [&quot;sacerdotum&quot;], and of good men&quot;. As in other dioceses, the clergy of the Diocese of Rome was the electoral body for the Bishop of Rome. Instead of casting votes, the bishop was selected by general consensus or by acclamation. The candidate was then submitted to the people for their general approval or disapproval. This lack of precision in the election procedures occasionally gave rise to rival popes or antipopes.

The right of the laity to reject the person elected was abolished by a synod held in the Lateran in 769, but restored to Roman noblemen by Pope Nicholas I during a synod of Rome in 862. The pope was also subjected to oaths of loyalty to the Holy Roman Emperor, who had the duty of providing security and public peace in Rome. A major change came in 1059, when Pope Nicholas II decreed in that the cardinals were to elect a candidate to take office after receiving the assent of the clergy and laity. The cardinal bishops were to meet first and discuss the candidates before summoning the cardinal priests and cardinal deacons for the actual vote. The Second Council of the Lateran in 1139 removed the requirement for obtaining the assent of the lower clergy and the laity, while the Third Council of the Lateran in 1179 gave equal rights to the entire College of Cardinals when electing a new pope.

Through much of the Middle Ages and Renaissance the Catholic Church had only a small number of cardinals at any one time, as few as seven under either Pope Alexander IV (1254–1261) or Pope John XXI (1276–1277). The difficulty of travel further reduced the number arriving at conclaves. The small electorate magnified the significance of each vote and made it all but impossible to displace familial or political allegiances. Conclaves lasted months and even years. In his 1274 decree requiring the electors be locked in seclusion, Gregory X also limited each cardinal elector to two servants and rationed their food progressively when a conclave reached its fourth and ninth days. The cardinals disliked these rules; Pope Adrian V temporarily suspended them in 1276 and John XXI&#x27;s &quot;Licet felicis recordationis&quot; revoked them later that same year. Lengthy elections resumed and continued to be the norm until 1294, when Pope Celestine V reinstated the 1274 rules. Long interregna followed: in 1314–1316 during the Avignon Papacy, where the original conclaves were dispersed by besieging mercenaries and not reconvened for almost two years; and in 1415–1417, as a result of the Western Schism.

Until 1899, it was a regular practice to generally include a few lay members in the Sacred College. These were often prominent nobility, or monks who were not priests, and in all cases, celibacy was required. With the death of Teodolfo Mertel in 1899, this practice was ended. In 1917, the Code of Canon Law promulgated that year, explicitly stated that all cardinals must be priests. Since 1962, all cardinals have been bishops, with the exception of a few priests who were made cardinals after 1975 and being 80 years of age or older, were dispensed from the requirement of episcopal ordination.

In 1587 Pope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70, following the precedent of Moses who was assisted by 70 elders in governing the Children of Israel: 6 cardinal bishops, 50 cardinal priests, and 14 cardinal deacons. Beginning with the attempts of Pope John XXIII (1958–1963) to broaden the representation of nations in the College of Cardinals, that number has increased. In 1970 Paul VI ruled that cardinals who reach the age of eighty before the start of a conclave are ineligible to participate. In 1975 he limited the number of cardinal electors to 120. Though this remains the theoretical limit, all of his successors have exceeded it for short periods of time. John Paul II (in office 1978–2005) also changed the age limit slightly, so that cardinals who turn 80 before a papal vacancy (not before conclave start) can not serve as electors; this eliminated the idea of scheduling the conclave to include or exclude a cardinal who is very close to the age limit (and in 2013, Cardinal Walter Kasper, 79 when the papacy became vacant, participated in the conclave at age 80).

=== Choice of electors and of candidates ===
Originally, lay status did not bar election to the See of Rome. Bishops of dioceses were sometimes elected while still catechumens, such as the case of St. Ambrose, who became Bishop of Milan in 374. In the wake of the violent dispute over the 767 election of Antipope Constantine II, Pope Stephen III held the synod of 769, which decreed that only a cardinal priest or cardinal deacon could be elected, specifically excluding those that are already bishops. Church practice deviated from this rule as early as 817 and fully ignored it from 882 with the election of Pope Marinus I, the Bishop of Caere. Nicholas II, in the synod of 1059, formally codified existing practice by decreeing that preference was to be given to the clergy of Rome, but leaving the cardinal bishops free to select a cleric from elsewhere if they so decided. The Council of 1179 rescinded these restrictions on eligibility. On 15 February 1559, Paul IV issued the papal bull &quot;Cum ex apostolatus officio&quot;, a codification of the ancient Catholic law that only Catholics can be elected popes, to the exclusion of non-Catholics, including former Catholics who have become public and manifest heretics.

Pope Urban VI in 1378 became the last pope elected from outside the College of Cardinals. The last person elected as pope who was not already an ordained priest or deacon was the cardinal-deacon Giovanni di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, elected as Pope Leo X in 1513. His successor, Pope Adrian VI, was the last to be elected (1522) &quot;in absentia&quot;. Archbishop Giovanni Montini of Milan received several votes in the 1958 conclave though not yet a cardinal. As the Catholic Church holds that women cannot be validly ordained, women are not eligible for the papacy. Though the pope is the Bishop of Rome, he need not be of Italian background. , the three most recent conclaves have elected a Pole (1978), a German (2005), and an Argentinian (2013).

During the first millennium, popes were elected unanimously (at least in theory). After a decree by the Synod of Rome in 1059, some factions contended that a simple majority sufficed to elect. In 1179, the Third Council of the Lateran settled the question by calling for unanimity, but permitting the Pope to be elected by two-thirds majority, &quot;if by chance, through some enemy sowing tares, there cannot be full agreement.&quot; As cardinals were not allowed to vote for themselves (after 1621), the ballots were designed to ensure secrecy while at the same time preventing self-voting. In 1945 Pope Pius XII removed the prohibition on a cardinal voting for himself, increasing the requisite majority to two-thirds plus one at all times. He eliminated as well the need for signed ballots. His successor John XXIII immediately reinstated the two-thirds majority if the number of cardinal electors voting is divisible by three, with a rounding up to two-thirds plus one otherwise. Paul VI reinstated Pius XII&#x27;s procedure thirteen years later, but John Paul II overturned it again. In 1996, John Paul II&#x27;s constitution allowed election by absolute majority if deadlock prevailed after thirty-three or thirty-four ballots (thirty-four ballots if a ballot took place on the first afternoon of the conclave). In 2007 Benedict XVI rescinded John Paul II&#x27;s change (which had effectively abolished the two-thirds majority requirement, as any majority suffices to block the election until a simple majority is enough to elect the next pope), reaffirming the requirement of a two-thirds majority.

Electors formerly made choices by accessus, acclamation (&quot;per inspirationem&quot;), adoration, compromise (&quot;per compromissum&quot;) or scrutiny (&quot;per scrutinium&quot;).

* Accessus was a method for cardinals to change their most recent vote to accede to another candidate in an attempt to reach the requisite two-thirds majority and end the conclave. This method was first disallowed by the Cardinal Dean at the 1903 conclave. Pius XII abolished accessus in 1945.
* With acclamation, the cardinals unanimously declared the new pope &quot;quasi afflati Spiritu Sancto&quot; (as if inspired by the Holy Spirit). If this took place before any formal ballot had taken place, the method was called adoration, but Pope Gregory XV excluded this method in 1621. 
* To elect by compromise, a deadlocked college unanimously delegates the election to a committee of cardinals whose choice they all agree to abide by. 
* Scrutiny is election via the casting of secret ballots.

The last election by compromise was that of Pope John XXII in 1316, and the last election by acclamation that of Pope Innocent XI in the 1676 conclave. &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot; formally abolished the long-unused methods of acclamation and compromise in 1996, making scrutiny the only approved method for the election of a new pope.

=== Secular influence ===
For a significant part of the Church&#x27;s history, powerful monarchs and governments influenced the choice of its leaders. For example, the Roman emperors once held considerable sway in the elections of popes. In 418, Emperor Honorius settled a controversial election, upholding Pope Boniface I over the challenger Antipope Eulalius. On the request of Boniface I, Honorius ordered that in future cases, any disputed election would be settled by a fresh election. After the demise of the Western Roman Empire, influence passed to the Ostrogothic Kings of Italy and in 533, Pope John II formally recognised the right of the Ostrogothic monarchs to ratify elections. By 537 the Ostrogothic monarchy had been overthrown, and power passed to the Byzantine emperors. A procedure was adopted whereby officials were required to notify the Exarch of Ravenna upon the death of a pope before proceeding with the election. Once the electors arrived at a choice, they were required to send a delegation to Constantinople requesting the emperor&#x27;s consent, which was necessary before the individual elected could take office. Travel to and from Constantinople caused lengthy delays. When Pope Benedict II (684–685) complained about them, Emperor Constantine IV (in office 654–685) acquiesced, ending the requirement for emperors to confirm elections. Thereafter, the Emperor was only required to be notified. The last pope to notify a Byzantine emperor was Pope Zachary in 741.

In the 9th century, the Holy Roman Empire came to exert control over papal elections. While Charlemagne (emperor from 800 to 814) and Louis the Pious (emperor from 813 to 840) did not interfere with the Church, Lothair I (emperor from 817 to 855) claimed that an election could only take place in the presence of imperial ambassadors. In 898 riots forced Pope John IX to recognise the superintendence of the Holy Roman Emperor. At the same time, the Roman nobility also continued to exert great influence, especially during the tenth-century period known as &quot;saeculum obscurum&quot; (Latin for &quot;the dark age&quot;).

In 1059 the same papal bull that restricted suffrage to the cardinals also recognised the authority of the Holy Roman Emperor (at the time Henry IV), but only as a concession made by the pope, declaring that the Holy Roman Emperor had no authority to intervene in elections except where permitted to do so by papal agreements. Pope Gregory VII (in office 1073–1085) was the last pope to submit to the interference of the Holy Roman Emperors. The breach between him and the Holy Roman Empire caused by the Investiture Controversy led to the abolition of the emperor&#x27;s role. In 1122 the Holy Roman Empire acceded to the Concordat of Worms, accepting the papal decision.

From about 1600, certain Catholic monarchs claimed a &quot;jus exclusivae&quot; (right of exclusion), i.e. a veto over papal elections, exercised through a crown-cardinal. By an informal convention, each state claiming the veto could exercise the right once per conclave. Therefore, a crown-cardinal did not announce his veto until the very last moment when the candidate in question seemed likely to get elected. No vetoes could be employed after an election. After the Holy Roman Empire dissolved in 1806, its veto power devolved upon the Austrian Empire. The last exercise of the veto occurred in 1903, when Prince Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko informed the College of Cardinals that Austria opposed the election of Mariano Rampolla. Consequently, the college elected Giuseppe Sarto as Pope Pius X, who issued the constitution &quot;Commissum nobis&quot; six months later, declaring that any cardinal who communicated his government&#x27;s veto in the future would suffer excommunication &quot;latae sententiae&quot;.

=== Seclusion and resolution ===
To resolve prolonged deadlocks in papal elections in the earlier years, local authorities often resorted to the forced seclusion of the cardinal electors, such as first in the city of Rome in 1241, and possibly before that in Perugia in 1216. In 1269, when the forced seclusion of the cardinals alone failed to produce a pope, the city of Viterbo refused to send in any materials except bread and water. When even this failed to produce a result, the townspeople removed the roof of the Palazzo dei Papi in their attempt to speed up the election.

In an attempt to avoid future lengthy elections, Gregory X introduced stringent rules with the 1274 promulgation of &quot;Ubi periculum&quot;. Cardinals were to be secluded in a closed area and not accorded individual rooms. No cardinal was allowed, unless ill, to be attended by more than two servants. Food was supplied through a window to avoid outside contact. After three days of the conclave, the cardinals were to receive only one dish a day; after another five days, they were to receive just bread and water. During the conclave, no cardinal was to receive any ecclesiastical revenue.

Adrian V abolished Gregory X&#x27;s strict regulations in 1276, but Celestine V, elected in 1294 following a two-year vacancy, restored them. In 1562 Pius IV issued a papal bull that introduced regulations relating to the enclosure of the conclave and other procedures. Gregory XV issued two bulls that covered the most minute of details relating to the election; the first, in 1621, concerned electoral processes, while the other, in 1622, fixed the ceremonies to be observed. In December 1904 Pope Pius X issued an apostolic constitution consolidating almost all the previous rules, making some changes, &quot;Vacante sede apostolica&quot;. John Paul II instituted several reforms in 1996.

The location of the conclaves became fixed in the fourteenth century. Since the end of the Western Schism in 1417, they have taken place in Rome (except in 1799–1800, when French troops occupying Rome forced the election to be held in Venice), and normally in what, since the Lateran Treaties of 1929, has become the independent Vatican City State. Since 1846, when the Quirinal Palace was used, the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican has served as the location of the election. Popes have often fine-tuned the rules for the election of their successors: Pope Pius XII&#x27;s &quot;Vacantis Apostolicae Sedis&quot; (1945) governed the conclave of 1958, Pope John XXIII&#x27;s &quot;Summi Pontificis electio&quot; (1962) that of 1963, Pope Paul VI&#x27;s &quot;Romano Pontifici eligendo&quot; (1975) the two conclaves of 1978, John Paul II&#x27;s &quot;Universi Dominici Gregis&quot; (1996) that of 2005, and two amendments by Benedict XVI (2007, 2013) that of 2013.

With 139 Cardinal electors, the Papal conclave after Pope Francis will be the most numerous conclave in the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s history. However, in 2025, 14 of the Cardinal electors will be 80 years old and, consequently, will lose their right to vote.

== Modern practice ==
In 1996, John Paul II promulgated a new apostolic constitution, &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot;, which with slight modifications by Pope Benedict XVI now governs the election of the pope, abolishing all previous constitutions on the matter, but preserving many procedures that date to much earlier times. Under &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot;, the cardinals are to be lodged in a purpose-built edifice in Vatican City, the Domus Sanctae Marthae, but continue to vote in the Sistine Chapel.

Several duties are performed by the dean of the College of Cardinals, who is always a cardinal bishop. If the dean is not entitled to participate in the conclave owing to age, his place is taken by the vice-dean, who is also always a cardinal bishop. If the vice-dean also cannot participate, the senior cardinal bishop participating performs the functions.

Since the College of Cardinals is a small body, there have been proposals that the electorate should be expanded. Proposed reforms include a plan to replace the College of Cardinals as the electoral body with the Synod of Bishops, which includes many more members. Under present procedure, the synod may only meet when called by the pope. &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot; explicitly provides that even if a synod or an ecumenical council is in session at the time of a pope&#x27;s death, it may not perform the election. Upon the pope&#x27;s death, either body&#x27;s proceedings are suspended, to be resumed only upon the order of the new pope.

It is considered poor form to campaign for the position of pope. There is always much outside speculation about which cardinals have serious prospects of being elected. Speculation tends to mount when a pope is ill or aged and shortlists of potential candidates appear in the media. A cardinal who is considered to be a prospect for the papacy is described informally as a &quot;papabile&quot; (an adjective used substantively: the plural form is &quot;papabili&quot;), a term coined by Italian-speaking Vatican watchers in the mid-20th century, literally meaning &quot;pope-able&quot;.

=== Death of a pope ===
The death of the pope is verified by the cardinal camerlengo, or chamberlain, who traditionally performed the task by calling out his baptismal (not papal) name three times in the presence of the master of papal liturgical celebrations, and of the cleric prelates, secretary and chancellor of the Apostolic Camera. The camerlengo takes possession of the Ring of the Fisherman worn by the pope; the ring, along with the papal seal, is later destroyed before the College of Cardinals. The tradition originated to avoid forgery of documents, but today merely is a symbol of the end of the pope&#x27;s reign.

During the &quot;sede vacante&quot;, as the papal vacancy is known, certain limited powers pass to the College of Cardinals, which is convoked by the dean of the College of Cardinals. All cardinals are obliged to attend the general congregation of cardinals, except those whose health does not permit, or who are over eighty (but those cardinals may choose to attend if they please as non-voting members). The particular congregation that deals with the day-to-day matters of the Church includes the cardinal camerlengo and the three cardinal assistants—one cardinal bishop, one cardinal priest and one cardinal deacon—chosen by lot. Every three days, new cardinal assistants are chosen by lot. The camerlengo and assistants are responsible, among other things, for maintaining the election&#x27;s secrecy.

The congregations must make certain arrangements in respect of the pope&#x27;s burial, which by tradition takes place within four to six days of the pope&#x27;s death, leaving time for pilgrims to see the dead pontiff, and occurs within a nine-day period of mourning known as the . The congregations also fix the date and time of the commencement of the conclave. The conclave normally takes place fifteen days after the death of the pope, but the congregations may extend the period to a maximum of twenty days in order to permit other cardinals to arrive in Vatican City.

=== Resignation of a pope ===

A vacancy in the papal office may also result from a papal resignation. Until the resignation of Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013, no pope had resigned since Gregory XII in 1415. In 1996 Pope John Paul II, in his apostolic constitution &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot;, anticipated the possibility of resignation when he specified that the procedures he set out in that document should be observed &quot;even if the vacancy of the Apostolic See should occur as a result of the resignation of the Supreme Pontiff&quot;.

In the case of a papal resignation, the Ring of the Fisherman is placed in the custody of the cardinal camerlengo; in the presence of the College of Cardinals, the camerlengo marks an &quot;X&quot; (for the cross) with a small silver hammer and chisel into the ring, disfiguring it so it may no longer be used for signing and sealing official papal documents.

In his book &quot;Light of the World: The Pope, the Church and the Signs of the Times&quot;, Benedict XVI espoused the idea of resignation on health grounds, which already had some theological respectability.

=== Before the sealing of the Sistine Chapel ===
The cardinals hear two sermons before the election: one before actually entering the conclave, and one once they are settled in the Sistine Chapel. In both cases, the sermons are meant to lay out the current state of the Church, and to suggest the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in that specific time. The first preacher in the 2005 conclave was Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher of the papal household and a member of the Capuchin Franciscan order, who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the conclave began. Cardinal Tomáš Špidlík, a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non-voting member (due to age) of the College of Cardinals, spoke just before the doors were finally closed for the conclave.

On the morning of the day designated by the congregations of cardinals, the cardinal electors assemble in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica to celebrate Mass. Then they gather in the afternoon in the Pauline Chapel in the Apostolic Palace and process to the Sistine Chapel while singing the Litany of the Saints. The cardinals will also sing the &quot;Veni Creator Spiritus&quot;, invoking the Holy Spirit, then take an oath to observe the procedures set down by the apostolic constitutions; to, if elected, defend the liberty of the Holy See; to maintain secrecy; and to disregard the instructions of secular authorities on voting. The senior cardinal reads the oath aloud in full; in order of precedence (where their rank is the same, their seniority is taken as precedence), the other cardinal electors repeat the oath, while touching the Gospels. The oath is:
=== Expelling the outsiders ===

After all the cardinals present have taken the oath, the master of papal liturgical celebrations orders all individuals other than the cardinal electors and conclave participants to leave the chapel. Traditionally, he stands at the door of the Sistine Chapel and calls out: . He then closes the door. In modern practice, the master of papal liturgical celebrations does not have to stand at the door of the Sistine Chapel—during the 2013 conclave, the master Guido Marini stood in front of the altar and gave the command through a microphone and only went to the chapel doors to close them after the outsiders had left.

The master himself may remain, as may one ecclesiastic designated by the congregations prior to the commencement of the election. The ecclesiastic makes a speech concerning the problems facing the Church and on the qualities the new pope needs to have. After the speech concludes, the ecclesiastic leaves. Following the recitation of prayers, the senior cardinal asks if any doubts relating to procedure remain. After the clarification of the doubts, the election may commence. Cardinals who arrive after the conclave has begun are admitted nevertheless. A sick cardinal or a cardinal who has to use the lavatory may leave the conclave and later be readmitted; a cardinal who leaves for any reason other than illness may not return to the conclave.

Although in the past cardinal electors could be accompanied by attendants (&quot;conclavists&quot;), now only a nurse may accompany a cardinal who for reasons of ill-health, as confirmed by the Congregation of Cardinals, needs such assistance. The secretary of the College of Cardinals, the master of papal liturgical celebrations, two masters of ceremonies, two officers of the Papal Sacristy and an ecclesiastic assisting the dean of the College of Cardinals are also admitted to the conclave. Priests are available to hear confessions in different languages; two doctors are also admitted. Finally, a strictly limited number of servant staff are permitted for housekeeping and the preparing and serving of meals.

Secrecy is maintained during the conclave; the cardinals as well as the conclavists and staff are forbidden to disclose any information relating to the election. Cardinal electors may not correspond or converse with anyone outside the conclave, by post, radio, telephone, internet, social media or otherwise, and eavesdropping is an offense punishable by automatic excommunication (&quot;latae sententiae&quot;). Only three cardinal electors are permitted to communicate with the outside world under grave circumstances, prior to approval of the college, to fulfill their duties: the Major Penitentiary, the cardinal vicar for the Diocese of Rome, and the vicar general for the Vatican City State.

Before the conclave that elected Pope Francis, the Sistine Chapel was &quot;swept&quot; to detect any hidden &quot;bugs&quot; or surveillance devices (there were no reports that any were found, but in previous conclaves press reporters who had disguised themselves as conclave servants were discovered). &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot; specifically prohibits media such as newspapers, the radio, and television. Wi-Fi access is blocked in Vatican City and wireless signal jammers are deployed at the Sistine Chapel to prevent any form of electronic communications to or from the cardinal electors.

=== Voting ===
On the afternoon of the first day, one ballot (referred to as a &quot;scrutiny&quot;) may be held, but is not required. If a ballot takes place on the afternoon of the first day and no-one is elected, or no ballot had taken place, a maximum of four ballots are held on each successive day: two in each morning and two in each afternoon. Before voting in the morning and again before voting in the afternoon, the electors take an oath to obey the rules of the conclave. If no result is obtained after three vote days of balloting, the process is suspended for a maximum of one day for prayer and an address by the senior cardinal deacon. After seven further ballots, the process may again be similarly suspended, with the address now being delivered by the senior cardinal priest. If, after another seven ballots, no result is achieved, voting is suspended once more, the address being delivered by the senior cardinal bishop. After a further seven ballots, there shall be a day of prayer, reflection and dialogue. In the following ballots, only the two names who received the most votes in the last ballot shall be eligible in a runoff election where a two-thirds majority is still required. The two people voted on, even if cardinal electors, shall not themselves have the right to vote.

The process of voting comprises three phases: the &quot;pre-scrutiny&quot;, the &quot;scrutiny&quot;, and the &quot;post-scrutiny&quot;.

==== Pre-scrutiny ====
During the pre-scrutiny, the masters of ceremonies prepare ballot papers bearing the words (&#x27;I elect as Supreme Pontiff&#x27;) and provide at least two to each cardinal elector. As the cardinals begin to write down their votes, the secretary of the College of Cardinals, the master of papal liturgical celebrations and the masters of ceremonies exit; the junior cardinal deacon then closes the door. The junior cardinal deacon then draws by lot nine names; the first three become scrutineers, the second three &quot;infirmarii&quot; and the last three revisers. New scrutineers, &quot;infirmarii&quot; and revisers are not selected again after the first scrutiny; the same nine cardinals perform the same task for the second scrutiny. After lunch, the election resumes with the oath to obey the rules of the conclave taken anew when the cardinals again assemble in the Sistine Chapel. Nine names are chosen for new scrutineers, &quot;infirmarii&quot;, and revisers. The third scrutiny then commences, and if necessary, a fourth immediately follows. No changes in these rules were made by Benedict XVI in 2007. These rules were followed (so far as is known, given the secrecy of a conclave) in electing Pope Francis in March 2013.

==== Scrutiny ====
The scrutiny phase of the election is as follows: The cardinal electors proceed, in order of precedence, to take their completed ballots (which bear only the name of the individual voted for) to the altar, where the scrutineers stand. Before casting the ballot, each cardinal elector takes the following Latin oath:

If any cardinal elector is in the chapel, but cannot proceed to the altar due to infirmity, the last scrutineer may go to him and take his ballot after the oath is recited. If any cardinal elector is by reason of infirmity confined to his room, the &quot;infirmarii&quot; go to their rooms with ballot papers and a box. Any such sick cardinals complete the ballot papers and then take the oath and drop the ballot papers into the box. When the &quot;infirmarii&quot; return to the chapel, the ballots are counted to ensure that their number matches with the number of ill cardinals; thereafter, they are deposited in the appropriate receptacle. This oath is taken by all cardinals as they cast their ballots. If no one is chosen on the first scrutiny, then a second scrutiny immediately follows. A maximum total of four scrutinies can be taken each day, two in the morning and two in the afternoon.

The oath taken when casting one&#x27;s vote, under present rules is only verbal, since the name of the elector is no longer signed on the ballot with that of the candidate. (Previously, the ballot was signed by the elector, who included his motif [unique identification code]. Then he folded it over at two places to cover his signature and motif. After this, it was sealed with wax to result in a semi-secret ballot.) The wax seals were opened only if a candidate received the bare minimum needed for election. This was to ensure that the apparently elected man had not voted for himself. This was the procedure from 1621 to 1945. The example above is a copy of the old three section semi-secret ballot, which was last used in the conclave of 1939. There was no oath taken when actually casting ballots, prior to 1621. Semi-secret ballots with initials or motiff written on the back of the ballot (at the option of the cardinals present and voting) were sometimes used prior to 1621. These secret ballots had no oath taken when the vote was actually cast. At some conclaves prior to 1621, the cardinals verbally voted and sometimes stood in groups to facilitate counting the votes cast. The signature and motif of the elector covered by two folded-over parts of the ballot paper was added by Gregory XV in 1621, to prevent anyone from casting the deciding vote for himself. Cardinal Pole of England refused to cast the deciding vote for himself in 1549, which would then have been followed by the accession to raise his vote total to at least one more than the minimum number needed (and was not elected), but in 1492 Cardinal Borgia (Pope Alexander VI) almost certainly did privately bribe other cardinals to vote for him. It is certain that he would not have been allowed to cast the deciding vote for himself, without the knowledge and consent of the other cardinals. A procedure called accession gave electors who had not voted for the possible new pope the opportunity to change their votes and make the election unanimous (or nearly so), except for the vote of the possible new pope. This is how Cardinal Borgia was elected Pope Alexander VI in 1492. Faced by the mortal challenge to the papacy emanating from Protestantism, and fearing schism due to several stormy conclaves in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Gregory XV established the procedure of signed ballots to prevent any cardinal from casting the deciding vote for himself. The accession was not ended, but seldom used until Pius XII abolished it in 1945. Since 1945, a cardinal can cast the deciding vote for himself without the accession, though the two-thirds majority rule has always been continued, except when John Paul II had modified that rule in 1996 (after 33 ballots, a simple majority was sufficient), with the two-thirds majority rule restored in 2007 by Benedict XVI.

Prior to 1621, the only oath taken was that of obedience to the rules of the conclave in force at that time, when the cardinals entered the conclave and the doors were locked, and each morning and afternoon as they entered the Sistine Chapel to vote. Gregory XV added the additional oath, taken when each cardinal casts his ballot, to prevent cardinals wasting time in casting &quot;courtesy votes&quot; and instead narrowing the number of realistic candidates for the papal throne to perhaps only two or three. Speed in electing a pope was important, and that meant using an oath so as to get the cardinals down to the serious business of electing a new pope and narrowing the number of potentially electable candidates. The reforms of Gregory XV in 1621 and reaffirmed in 1622 created the written detailed step-by-step procedure used in choosing a pope; a procedure that was essentially the same as that which was used in 2013 to elect Pope Francis. The biggest change since 1621 was the elimination of the rule that required the electors to sign their ballots resulting in the detailed voting procedure of scrutiny making use of simple verbal oaths. Beginning in 1945, an elector could vote for himself and then call on God via the oath taken when the vote is dropped into the receptacle, to declare himself to be the best one qualified for the papacy. The use of the accession would prevent this, but is not allowed under the present rules. Beginning with the use of totally secret ballots in the 1958 conclave, it is now possible for a cardinal to cast the deciding vote for himself, without the knowledge and consent of the other cardinals.

Once all votes have been cast, the first scrutineer chosen shakes the container, and the last scrutineer removes and counts the ballots. If the number of ballots does not correspond to the number of cardinal electors present (including sick cardinals in their rooms), the ballots are burnt, unread, and the vote is repeated. If no irregularities are observed, the ballots may be opened and the votes counted. Each ballot is unfolded by the first scrutineer; all three scrutineers separately write down the name indicated on the ballot. The last of the scrutineers reads the name aloud.

Once all of the ballots have been opened, the final post-scrutiny phase begins.

==== Post-scrutiny ====
The scrutineers add up all of the votes, and the revisers check the ballots and the names on the scrutineers&#x27; lists to ensure that no error was made. The ballots are then all burned by the scrutineers with the assistance of the secretary of the College of Cardinals and the masters of ceremonies. If the first scrutiny held in any given morning or afternoon does not result in an election, the cardinals proceed to the next scrutiny immediately. The papers from both scrutinies are then burned together at the end of the second scrutiny.


==== Fumata ====
Beginning in the early 1800s, the ballots used by cardinals were burned after each ballot to indicate a failed election. The lack of smoke instead signalled a successful election. Since 1914, black smoke (&quot;fumata nera&quot;) emerging from a temporary chimney installed on the roof of the Sistine Chapel indicates that the ballot did not result in an election, while white smoke (&quot;fumata bianca&quot;) announces that a new pope has been chosen.

Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII changed the form of ballot to use unsigned ballots, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above had the effect of making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave, there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. The lack of sealing wax on the ballots explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 conclave. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color on the first day of that conclave.

Since 1963, chemicals have been added to the burning process to augment the smoke&#x27;s black or white color. Beginning in 2005, a successful election is also accentuated by bells ringing at the appearance of the white smoke.

During the 2013 conclave, the Vatican disclosed the chemicals used to color the smoke—the black smoke comprises potassium perchlorate, anthracene, and sulfur; the white smoke is composed of potassium chlorate, lactose, and pine rosin.

=== Acceptance and proclamation ===
Once the election concludes, the cardinal dean summons the secretary of the College of Cardinals and the master of papal liturgical celebrations into the hall. The dean then asks the pope-elect if he assents to the election, saying in Latin: (&#x27;Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?&#x27;) There is no requirement that the pope-elect do so, and he is free to respond (&#x27;I do not accept&#x27;).

In practice, any cardinal who intends not to accept will explicitly state this &quot;before&quot; he receives a sufficient number of votes to become pope, as Giovanni Colombo did in October 1978.

If he accepts, and is already a bishop, he immediately takes office. If he is not a bishop, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, the dean of the College of Cardinals consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-dean, and if the sub-dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal bishop in attendance. In 2005, the dean himself—Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger—was elected pope, thus impeding him from the stated duties. In 2013, the dean and sub-dean were not in attendance (being over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.

Since 533, the new pope has also decided on his regnal name. Pope John II was the first to adopt a new papal name; he felt that his original name, Mercurius, was inappropriate, as it was also the name of a Roman god. In most cases, even if such considerations are absent, popes tend to choose papal names different from their baptismal names; the last pope to reign under his baptismal name was Pope Marcellus II (1555). After the newly elected pope accepts his election, the dean asks him about his papal name, saying in Latin: (&#x27;By what name do you wish to be called?&#x27;) After the papal name is chosen, the officials are readmitted to the conclave, and the master of papal liturgical celebrations writes a document recording the acceptance and the new name of the pope.

In the past, when the cardinals voted during a conclave, they sat on canopied thrones symbolizing the cardinals&#x27; collective governance of the church during the period of &quot;sede vacante&quot;. Upon the acceptance by the new pope of his election, all other cardinals in attendance each pulled a cord and lowered the canopies above their respective thrones, signifying an end to the period of collective governance, and only the newly elected pope&#x27;s canopy remained unlowered. The last time canopied thrones were used was during the 1963 conclave. Beginning with the August 1978 conclave, canopied thrones were no longer used due to the lack of space resulting from the large increase in the number of cardinal electors (two rows of seats needed).

At the end of the conclave, the new pope could give his cardinalitial zucchetto or skull cap to the secretary of the conclave, indicating the secretary would be made cardinal at the next consistory to create cardinals. Prior to the 2013 conclave, this tradition was last followed at the 1958 conclave by the newly elected Pope John XXIII, who bestowed his cardinal&#x27;s skull cap on Alberto di Jorio and created him a cardinal at the consistory on 15 December of that year. In 2013, the Portuguese section of Vatican Radio reported that at the conclusion of the 2013 conclave, the newly elected Pope Francis bestowed his cardinalitial zucchetto on Archbishop Lorenzo Baldisseri, the secretary of that conclave, and on 22 February 2014 at Pope Francis&#x27; first consistory, Baldisseri was formally made a cardinal with the title of Cardinal-Deacon of Sant&#x27;Anselmo all&#x27;Aventino.

Then, the new pope goes to the Room of Tears, a small red room next to the Sistine Chapel; the room carries the nickname because of the strong emotions experienced by the new pope. The new pope dresses by himself, choosing a set of pontifical robes—consisting of a white cassock, rochet, and red mozzetta—from three sizes provided. He then dons a gold corded pectoral cross, a red and gold embroidered stole, and then the white papal zucchetto on his head. In 2013, Pope Francis dispensed with the red mozzetta, rochet, and gold pectoral cross, wearing only the white cassock and his own pectoral cross when he appeared on the central balcony. He also did not emerge wearing the stole, vesting in it only to impart the apostolic blessing, and removing it shortly after.

Next, the protodeacon of the College of Cardinals (the senior cardinal deacon) appears at the loggia of the basilica to proclaim the new pope. He usually proceeds with the following traditional Latin formula (assuming that a cardinal has been elected):

 [given name] [surname] [papal name]

I announce to you with great joy;we have a Pope:The most eminent and most reverend Lord,Lord [given name]Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church [surname]who has taken the name [papal name].
During the announcement for Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s election, the protodeacon, Cardinal Jorge Medina, first greeted the crowds with &quot;Dear brothers and sisters&quot; in several different languages before proceeding to the Latin announcement. This was not done when Pope Francis was elected.

In the past, the protodeacon has himself been elected pope. In such an event, the announcement is made by the next senior deacon, who has thus succeeded as protodeacon. The last time the cardinal protodeacon was elected was in 1513, when Giovanni de Medici was elected as Pope Leo X and the next senior cardinal deacon Alessandro Farnese (the future Pope Paul III) made the announcement. After the election of Pope Leo XIII in 1878, Protodeacon Prospero Caterini appeared and started to make the announcement but was physically incapable of completing it, so another made it for him.
Following the announcement, the senior cardinal deacon retreats, and papal aides unfurl a large, maroon banner that out of practicality often bears the late pope&#x27;s arms in the centre, draping it onto the railing of the basilica&#x27;s loggia. During Popes John Paul II&#x27;s and Francis&#x27; announcement, there was no image of his predecessor&#x27;s arms (indicating that the previous pope had just died, or was still alive at the time of the conclave), and during Pope Pius XI&#x27;s first appearance following his election at the 1922 conclave, the banner showed the arms of Pope Pius IX instead of the arms of his immediate predecessor Pope Benedict XV. The new pope then emerges onto the balcony to the adulation of the crowd, while a brass band in the forecourt below plays the Pontifical Anthem. He then imparts the Urbi et Orbi blessing. The pope may on this occasion choose to give the shorter episcopal blessing as his first apostolic blessing instead of the traditional Urbi et Orbi blessing; this happened most recently with Pope Paul VI after his election at the 1963 conclave. Beginning with Pope John Paul II, the last three popes elected (including Pope Francis) have chosen to address the crowds first, before imparting the Urbi et Orbi blessing. Also, at Pope Francis&#x27; first appearance, he first led the faithful in prayers for his predecessor and then asked them to pray for himself, before imparting the Urbi et Orbi blessing.

Formerly, the popes were crowned by the &quot;triregnum&quot;, or triple tiara, at the papal coronation. All popes since John Paul I have refused an elaborate coronation, choosing instead to have a simpler papal inauguration ceremony.

<text>The &#x27;, or Dialogue concerning the Exchequer&quot;&quot;&#x27;, is a mediaeval treatise on the practice of the English Exchequer written in the late 12th century by Richard FitzNeal. The treatise, written in Latin, and known from four manuscripts from the 13th century is set up as a series of questions and answers, covering the jurisdiction, constitution and practice of the Exchequer. One academic said that &quot;The value of this essay for early English history cannot be over-estimated; in every direction it throws light upon the existing state of affairs.&quot; It has been repeatedly republished and translated, most recently in 2007.

==Origin==
The treatise was most likely written by Richard FitzNeal, Lord High Treasurer of the Exchequer under Henry II. The date of the book is disputed; it describes six circuits of itinerant justices; academics argue, therefore, that it must have been written before 1179, when the number of circuits was reduced to four. This requires, however, that the changes to the circuits came into immediate effect, and Richardson argues that there is nothing in the Pipe Rolls to support this assumption. Other academics suggest either 1181 or 1188 as possible years. Divided into two books and written as a series of questions and answers between a learned lawyer and his pupil, the treatise first looks at the constitution of the Exchequer, analysing the Upper and Lower Exchequers individually and giving descriptions of their officers and jurisdiction. The second book describes the Exchequer &quot;in practice&quot;, giving a layout of the proper way to plead cases and the timetable by which a case ran.

==Versions and translations==
As well as its initial publication and additional versions during the 18th and 19th centuries, the book was again published in 1902 by the Clarendon Press; this soon went out of print, and a second edition with a commentary was published in 1950, edited by Charles Johnson. This again went out of print, necessitating a new edition published by Oxford University Press in 1983. The 1952 edition was favourably reviewed, with K.R. Potter writing that it was &quot;a most helpful guide to those unfamiliar with medieval finance&quot;. Ernest Henderson wrote that it was &quot;one of the few actual treatises of the middle ages. It is a most learned essay concerning all that went on at the bi-yearly meetings of the exchequer officials, and branches out into a description of all the sources of revenue of the English crown, and of the methods of collecting them. The value of this essay for early English history cannot be over-estimated; in every direction it throws light upon the existing state of affairs&quot;.

The most recent edition was published in 2007, also by Oxford University Press, and was edited and translated by Emilie Amt and S. D. Church— and described as being a &quot;...valuable new edition and translation which merits considerable use...&quot;. It has, however, also been criticised for doing little &quot;to advance the study of this difficult and important text&quot;.

<doc id="827726" wikidata="Q19340777" url="?curid=827726" title="White Ribbon Campaign">
<text>The White Ribbon Campaign (WRC) is a global movement of men and boys working to end male violence against women and girls. It was established in November 1991 by a group of men in Toronto, Ontario, as a response to the École Polytechnique massacre of female students by Marc Lépine in 1989. The campaign was intended to raise awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women, with the ribbon symbolizing &quot;the idea of men giving up their arms&quot;. The campaign spread to over 60 countries, which each White Ribbon chapter operating as a separate entity with its own governance.

==Background and establishment==
On 6 December 1989, an instance of misogyny which occurred at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, known as the Montreal Massacre. In the incident, 25-old Marc Lépine entered the school, killing 14 women, and injuring another ten women and four men because of his hatred toward women and their presence in the engineering program at École.

In November 1991, a group of pro-feminist men in Toronto, Ontario, formed as a response to this massacre. The campaign was intended to raise awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women, with the ribbon symbolizing &quot;the idea of men giving up their arms&quot;.

==Description==
The White Ribbon Campaign is active in over 60 countries, including Canada, the UK, Pakistan, Italy, and Australia. Each White Ribbon chapter works as a separate entity and with its own governance.

The movement seeks to promote healthy relationships, gender equity, and a compassionate vision of masculinity.

Much of the campaign&#x27;s work is centered around the prevention of intimate partner violence, and includes educating and mentoring young men about issues such as violence and gender equality. Men and boys are encouraged to wear white ribbons as a symbol of their opposition to violence against women.
Wearing the ribbons is particularly encouraged during White Ribbon Week, which starts on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.

==By country==
===White Ribbon Australia===
In Australia in 2018, the day was moved from 25 to 23 November to become a specific campaign day separate to the international day, and expanded to encompass violence against children. Businesses are able to attain a &quot;white ribbon accredited workplace&quot;, valid for three years.

In October 2018, White Ribbon Australia made plans to retract its position statement that women &quot;should have complete control over their reproductive and sexual health&quot;, moving to an &quot;agnostic&quot; stance to consult with community stakeholders. Following criticism of the move, the original position statement was reinstated several hours later. The change in position occurred on the same morning the Parliament of Queensland voted to decriminalise abortion, which came after a lengthy process involving the Queensland Law Reform Commission (QLRC). White Ribbon Australia was referred to in the QLRC&#x27;s Review of Termination of Pregnancy Laws Report, for its submission supporting the need for &quot;nationally consistent access to safe and legal abortion&quot;.

On 3 October 2019, the Australian arm of the movement, White Ribbon Australia, was placed into liquidation after posting a net loss of AU$840,000 in its financial reports. By March 2020 a Western Australia-based community service organisation bought White Ribbon Australia, with the White Ribbon Canada executive director welcoming their commitment to collaborating to &quot;challenge and support men and boys to realise their potential to be part of the solution in ending all forms of gender-based violence&quot;.

In June 2020 Brad Chilcott, a pastor at Activate Church in Adelaide and founder of the refugee advocacy organisation Welcome to Australia, was appointed CEO of White Ribbon Australia. He stated an intent to focus more on domestic violence, to move away from being a specific campaign engaging males in order to involve all Australians, and to move &quot;from awareness to advocacy&quot;.

Some research papers some have looked at the effectiveness of the White Ribbon Australia campaign strategies. Kate Seymour, in her 2017 article &quot;&#x27;Stand up, speak out and act&#x27;: A critical reading of Australia&#x27;s White Ribbon campaign&quot; wrote that White Ribbon Australia&#x27;s &quot;failure to articulate the meaning of both gender equality and respect is a crucial lack&quot;, and that &quot;White Ribbon’s reliance on a binary view of gender, together with its emphasis on the attitudes and acts of individual men, contributes to the obscuration of men&#x27;s collective advantage&quot;. A master&#x27;s thesis by Daniel Pitman of Western Sydney University (2020), titled &quot;Understanding White Ribbon: Its Emergence and Limits in Countering Men&#x27;s Violence in Australia&quot;, notes criticism of the movement by some politicians and media.

==Men&#x27;s rights organisation (2014)==
In 2014, the United States-based men&#x27;s rights activist organisation A Voice for Men launched whiteribbon.org (since discontinued) as a counter to the White Ribbon campaign, adopting graphics and language from White Ribbon. It is owned by Erin Pizzey and has the slogan &quot;Stop Violence Against Everyone&quot;. Accused of &quot;hijacking&quot; White Ribbon, the site was harshly criticized by Todd Minerson, the former executive director of the White Ribbon Campaign, who described it as &quot;a copycat campaign articulating their archaic views and denials about the realities of gender-based violence&quot;. The site presents the claim that domestic violence is a learned behaviour from childhood, perpetrated equally by women and men. The website has faced much criticism, being accused of displaying &quot;anti-feminist propaganda&quot;.

<doc id="827731" wikidata="Q7231262" url="?curid=827731" title="Port of Seattle">
<text>The Port of Seattle is a public agency that is in King County, Washington. It oversees the seaport of Seattle as well as Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. With a portfolio of properties ranging from parks and waterfront real estate, to one of the largest airports and container terminals on the West Coast, the Port of Seattle is one of the Pacific Northwest&#x27;s leading economic engines.

Its creation was approved by the voters of King County on September 5, 1911, and authorized by the Port District Act. The Port of Seattle is managed by a five-member Port Commission who are elected at large by the voters of King County and serve four-year terms. (Both the size of the commission and the length of the terms have varied over time.) The Commissioners govern the Port, lead all inter-governmental functions, and oversee the Executive Director.

==History==

Over the course of more than a century, the Port of Seattle has provided facilities for an expansion of Seattle&#x27;s shipping trade, later including container shipping and the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, and helped to generate increasing economic activity in the area. Although the Second World War halted much of the global shipping trade and negatively impacted the economy, Seattle again became a major port after the war.

===Creation===
At the time of the creation of the Port of Seattle as an institution, Seattle was already a major port. However, its Central Waterfront was somewhat chaotic, due in part to having eight (and in some places nine) more or less parallel railroad tracks along the ill-maintained wooden planking of Railroad Avenue. Although the 1903-1906 construction of the Great Northern Tunnel through downtown had alleviated some of the chaos because trains that were merely passing through no longer needed to use the waterfront route, it did not change the basic fact that this &quot;avenue&quot; along the Central Waterfront was wide, built over water, difficult to traverse, and separated Downtown from the piers. To further complicate matters, tracks were owned by three separate private corporations, the Great Northern Railway, the Northern Pacific Railroad, and the Pacific Coast Company, which operated the Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad.

Furthermore, the railroad companies owned the piers and warehouses where the rails and ships came together, inevitably creating an anti-competitive effect for other businesses wishing to ship through Seattle.

As early as 1890, Virgil Bogue had proposed public ownership not only of the Seattle port, but of all ports in the then newly formed state. As part of gaining statehood, Washington had gained control over its own coastal waters, previously under direct federal control. Initially, it looked like Bogue might prevail, at least with respect to Seattle, but Thomas Burke and others representing the railroad interests managed to stall the initial Harbor Lines Commission plan into oblivion through a series of legal actions. Still, Bogue continued to win allies among populists, progressives, the labor movement, and even some of the railroads (though not the Great Northern). Among the more prominent allies were City Engineer Reginald H. Thomson and his one-time assistant George F. Cotterill. Cotterill went on to serve as a state senator and later as mayor of Seattle. Even before the Port was established, the latter two scored several victories simply by devising plans (a tunnel through Downtown; a uniform alignment of piers) that made enough sense that the railroads and others adopted them more or less voluntarily. Additionally, Cotterill as a state senator led a state-level effort to authorize port districts, though he was out of office by the time it came to fruition.

In 1910, pressure toward public ownership of port facilities increased when Tacoma, Washington began building the state&#x27;s first municipally owned dock. Even &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, normally opposed to municipal ownership, began to advocate for similar measures in Seattle. On March 14, 1911, the Port District Act became state law, allowing the formation of port districts.

The Port of Seattle was created by the state of Washington in 1911. Under the Port District Act, the port&#x27;s construction plan had to be presented and voted upon before construction could start. One of the biggest factors that swayed the votes in favor of creating the port was the prospect of economic growth, especially given the impending 1914 completion of the Panama Canal. The first Commission Report for 1912 records that: &quot;The Port of Seattle came into existence on September 5, 1911, by a vote of the people of the Port District held on that date in accordance with the Port District Act of March 14, 1911. The work of the commission for the first six months was confined almost entirely to the preparation of projects which were duly approved by the people at a special election held on March 5, 1912.&quot;

===Early development===
From the first, the Port of Seattle was faced with the fact that most of the key properties on the Central Waterfront on Elliott Bay were already in the hands of the railroads and other vested interests. This meant that most Port-owned facilities would be in more peripheral areas: to the south, the newly dredged East Waterway of the Duwamish between the newly filled mainland Industrial District and the newly created Harbor Island; to the north, where the Great Northern Railway occupied only part of Smith Cove; and north in Ballard, newly annexed to Seattle, where Salmon Bay would form the outlet of the new Lake Washington Ship Canal connecting Lake Washington and Lake Union to salt water.

The Port commissioned the first automobile ferry in Western Washington, &quot;Leschi&quot;, which launched December 6, 1913. The &quot;Leschi&quot; operated on Lake Washington, providing service from Leschi Park to two locations on the east side of the lake. Earlier that year, Port construction began with the creation of a home port for Puget Sound fishermen; Fishermen&#x27;s Terminal on Salmon Bay was completed in 1914 and has been the U.S. Northern Pacific Fishing Fleet&#x27;s home for operations, provisioning and repairs ever since. Work also began that year on a grain terminal at South Hanford Street on the East Waterway, intended to give Washington growers an alternative to shipping their grain down the Columbia River to Portland, Oregon.

Another project begun in 1913, the Bell Street Terminal, the Port&#x27;s new headquarters near the north end of the Central Waterfront, loaded its first cargo October 28, 1913 while the warehouse facilities were still under construction, and by 1914 served much of the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet and provided easy access for farmers around Puget Sound to bring their produce to Pike Place Market. A viaduct to Pike Place Market and a rooftop park, solarium, and pool were added in 1915. &quot;but by the 1920s, the park had developed an unsavory reputation and was closed.&quot;

Other early Port projects included cold storage facilities at Bell Street Terminal for local fishermen and on the East Waterway at South Spokane Street for Eastern Washington farmers, as well as two massive piers at Smith Cove. Pier A, later Pier 40 and (since 1944) Pier 90 was long and wide. It was the largest pier in the world until the construction of Pier B, later Pier 41 and (since 1944) Pier 91, longer.

===Stagnation in the 1920s and 1930s===
A more conservative Port Commission in the 1920s largely put an end to new initiatives of this sort. Trade continued to grow slowly, with an emphasis on China and (especially) Japan, but other West Coast and Gulf Coast ports increasingly copied Seattle&#x27;s initiatives of the prior decade, and the Port of Tacoma in particular undercut Seattle on prices. A price war through the 1920s resulted in a 1929 agreement through the American Association of Port Authorities to set uniform wharf rates.

Seattle and the state of Washington were not well-positioned coming into the Great Depression that began in 1929. Due to over-fishing and excessive logging, the natural resources that had provided much of the basis for the local economy were being depleted. The salmon catch was down below a tenth of what it had been in the peak year, 1913, and timber production was also significantly down even before the national economy began to tumble. By October 1931, low-rent housing in Seattle was oversaturated, and a Hooverville began to form in the abandoned Skinner &amp; Eddy land along Elliott Bay, site of present-day (2023) Terminal 46. In its first few months it was twice removed by Seattle Police 
&quot;sweeps,&quot; but eventually a compromise was reached that allowed a shantytown to persist for almost a decade.

===World War II and after===
The economic depression and labor troubles of the 1930s (see following section &quot;Politics and the Port&quot;) were followed by the wartime economy of World War II. Even before the U.S. entered the war, export of scrap metal to Japan, of course, went to zero, and export of Eastern Washington apples to Europe fared little better, but with the Soviet Union newly an ally, Seattle became a base for trans-oceanic shipping to Siberia. The Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation (Todd Pacific) on Harbor Island scored contracts to build 45 destroyers, which put it in a tie with Bethlehem Steel San Francisco for largest purely military ship production on the U.S. West Coast. The U.S. Navy took over the massive Smith Cove piers. The state legislature granted the Port of Seattle and other port authorities around the state exceptional powers to pursue defense-related projects without requiring the public to vote on the bond issues, which enabled the port to purchase additional land on the Harbor Island side of the East Waterway and to pursue major projects on the mainland side: Pier 42 (now part of Terminal 46), with its pilings as high as , and a new grain elevator at South Hanford Street.

U.S. entry into the war brought on further changes: effectively, the entire harbor on Elliott Bay became a U.S. military port for the duration. The Pacific Steamship Company piers south of Downtown were reworked into a Port of Embarkation (part of which now constitutes Coast Guard Station Seattle, the rest of which is part of Terminal 46). One of the longest-lasting legacies of the war years was the comprehensive May 1, 1944 renumbering of all of Seattle&#x27;s Elliott Bay piers into a single system encompassing the bay.

While the War years were a boom time for Seattle and its port, the immediate postwar years were not. Wartime production had made Seattle-based Boeing the region&#x27;s largest employer; peace resulted in 70,000 Boeing layoffs. Nor did Seattle&#x27;s port get its expected share of post-war commercial shipping traffic: for the first time ever, it was outdone even by its neighbor to the south, the far smaller city of Tacoma. While the Port of Seattle had launched what was to prove a very successful airport, wartime use of the Elliott Bay and Duwamish River waterfront had not established a particularly good basis for a peacetime port. When the military&#x27;s new piers reverted to civilian use, they took business away from existing older facilities and, consequently, away from the heart of town. Further, it had been over a decade since the Port had run a major national and international publicity campaign. And there were labor troubles (see following section &quot;Politics and the Port&quot;).

The Port was not entirely without a strategy. On the shore of the area around Pioneer Square and immediately south, they purchased and modernized Piers 43 and 45 through 49 from the Pacific Coast Company Piers 43, 45, 46, and 47 were eventually incorporated into present-day Terminal 46. Fishermen&#x27;s Terminal at Salmon Bay was enlarged and upgraded, as was the East Waterway Dock on Harbor Island. Still, they failed to support Eastern Washington farmers with a modern grain terminal, and that trade was lost, for the time, to Portland and Tacoma.

In 1949 the U.S. Department of Commerce designated a foreign-trade zone (FTZ) on Harbor Island. At the urging of the local business community, the Port invested heavily in gaining this designation and in building the facility, but it almost certainly turned out to be a money-loser over the next few decades. FTZ status was vastly expanded in 1989, encompassing virtually all of the Port&#x27;s seaport and airport acreage, a much better proposition than the single small facility.

===The Fifties===
By 1952, it was clear that Seattle&#x27;s maritime sector had not made a post-war recovery commensurate with other U.S. ports. Many companies were wary of doing business in Seattle in the wake of the 1948 strike (see section &quot;Politics and the Port&quot; below); a further strike in 1952 and conflicts within the Port Commission and between the Port Commission and Port management certainly did not alleviate these concerns. Things finally began to turn around, or at least level out, in late summer of 1953, when Howard M. Burke was hired away from his position as Seattle-based district manager at the American Hawaiian Steamship Company to be the new general manager of the Port. He emerged as the effective leader of the Port with projects such as expanding the grain terminal at South Hanford Street, building the massive Shilshole Bay Marina in Ballard, purchasing the Ames Terminal (which became Terminal 5) in West Seattle on the West Waterway of the Duwamish, and purchasing Pier 28 from the Milwaukee Road, which filled in a gap in Port-owned land on the mainland side of the East Waterway and paved the way for modernization of that portion of the waterfront. By 1956, foreign commerce shipping tonnage had recovered to levels not seen since the 1920s. A further proposal to dredge a wide, channel up the Duwamish River failed to come to fruition due to numerous lawsuits and the annexation of some of the relevant area by Tukwila, Washington, a south-side suburb.

Despite Burke&#x27;s best efforts, federal changes that introduced a sliding scale to maritime shipping rates in the early 1950s had taken away much of the historic value of Seattle&#x27;s being the closest major U.S. port to Asia. In 1954, this rate differential had helped San Francisco to outstrip Seattle even in shipping Eastern Washington apples, shipping 78,000 boxes to Seattle&#x27;s 5,480. The decade saw a series of reports highly critical of the Port, including two that the Port itself commissioned, one from the University of Washington&#x27;s Bureau of Business Research in 1956, and another from Booz Allen Hamilton in 1958 A 1959 KIRO-TV documentary &quot;Lost Cargo&quot; put the matter squarely before the public, In a city nearly half of whose GDP came from harbor-related activities, and where the Port controlled 21 of the city&#x27;s 88 piers and terminals, this was no small thing. A pair of 1960 ballot measures passed by broad margins. One expanded the Port Commission from three members to five, with the two new members elected at large rather than on the longstanding three-district basis. The other allocated US$10 million in bonds to fund modernization. The state government followed this up in 1961 by giving the Port expanded taxing authority, while also following a Booz Allen recommendation to get the Commission out of day-to-day operations, instead establishing separate, professionally-run departments for Planning and Research, Data Processing, Real Estate, Trade Development, and Public Relations.

=== Containerization ===


The 1960 Mechanization and Modernization Agreement (M&amp;M) put the ports and labor unions of the West Coast of North America, including Seattle, firmly on the path away from break-bulk cargo toward containerization. Alaska Steamship Company had experimented with containerization as early as 1949, and Sea-Land had begun the move toward international standardization when it shared its patents in 1956, but the unions had initially opposed moving in this direction because of the inevitable loss in jobs from what was, as much as anything, a labor-saving technology. With the benefits offered in the M&amp;M bringing the unions largely on board, the path was clear. Precisely because the Port of Seattle was doing poorly coming into this era, it had more reason than most to make a full-scale embrace of the new technology. In contrast, in particular, to Portland, the Port threw in its lot heavily for the new technology.

In the summer of 1962, with the world&#x27;s eyes on Seattle as host of the Century 21 Exposition (a World&#x27;s Fair), the Port announced a US$30 million plan to build a major new container port on the Duwamish Waterway. They also &quot;undert[ook] a six-year program to develop marginal lands and sell them to private industry&quot; to expand the Seattle economy. Two years later, Sea-Land chose the Port&#x27;s new Terminal 5 (on the site of the former Ames Terminal) as its West Coast headquarters. By the end of the 1960s, Seattle was the West Coast&#x27;s second-busiest port. When Seattle&#x27;s economy was slammed by the Boeing Bust around the turn of the decade, the previously moribund port was one of its few bright lights. The Port ended up buying the Boeing Plant 1 site along the Duwamish, which was developed into another modern container facility, Terminal 115, as was the old grain elevator site at South Hanford Street. That grain elevator was effectively replaced by the new Pier 86 Grain Terminal at the foot of Queen Anne Hill southeast of Smith Cove.

===Continued growth===
Naturally, advantages were not always on Seattle&#x27;s side. For example, Totem Ocean Trailer Express (now TOTE Group), founded in 1975, opted to base its shipments to Alaska out of Tacoma, where land was cheaper and room for expansion less likely to be an issue. 1975 also was the end of many decades of weekly United Brands banana-boat arrivals in Seattle: since then, bananas have arrived in Seattle by rail or truck. And for cargoes coming &quot;into&quot; the U.S. from East Asia, Seattle, in the relatively sparsely populated Pacific Northwest would always have a disadvantage in competing with the Port of Long Beach and of Los Angeles in populous Southern California.

But, in general, the Port continued to expand. The TOTE loss spurred the Port to acquire and stockpile more land along the Duwamish. The Port built a container facility at Terminal 25 for American President Lines (APL), and an assembly facility for foreign cars at Terminal 115. Terminal 28 (later incorporated into Terminal 30) was expanded by for Nissan, and Seattle became a major port of entry for Datsun vehicles. In 1976, the Port reacquired Piers 90 and 91 at Smith Cove from the Navy and focused them, at least initially, on Asian trade. In April 1979, COSCO&#x27;s &quot;Liu Lin Hai&quot; docked at Pier 91, then proceeded to Terminal 86 to take on a cargo of American grain bound for China, thereby becoming the first ship from the People&#x27;s Republic of China ever to visit a U.S. port. Years later, the Port invested in a major cold storage facility and Pier 91, which paid off handsomely when Japan dropped a 1971 ban on fruit imports from Washington. Pier 91 became the chief export point for Washington apples to Japan.

The Port further expanded in the 1980s, with the growth of the China trade and the Port&#x27;s increased capacity for intermodal transport, with containers transferring between ships and trucks, but especially between ships and rail. Although some carriers shifted operations from Seattle to Tacoma, this was more than compensated by acquisition of new business and the growth of shipping by some of the carriers who remained. Among the new arrivals: toy company Hasbro made Seattle&#x27;s expanded Terminal 106 its national distribution center and its sole port of entry for container shipments from Asia, and the Port played a large part in Nintendo of America&#x27;s move from New York City to Redmond, an Eastside suburb of Seattle.

In its early years, the Port had to contend with the fact that the most desirable properties on the Central Waterfront were already occupied by piers, mostly in the hands of the railroads. 70 years later, with the Port&#x27;s container facilities now completely dominating Seattle&#x27;s maritime trade, they were confronted with the opposite problem: much of the Central Waterfront, especially the portion north of Pier 59 (the Seattle Aquarium since 1977) had fallen into dereliction. The Port took a leading role in trying to remedy this, with Pat Davis and Paige Miller, the first two women on the Port Commission, taking a particularly large role.

One of the deteriorating properties in question was the Port&#x27;s own headquarters at the Bell Street Pier (renumbered as Pier 66 in 1944). The Port acquired nearby Pier 69, built in 1900 for the Roslyn Coal &amp; Coke Company and used for many decades by the American Can Company. They refurbished that building and in 1993 moved into it as their new headquarters. (Pier 69 is also the Seattle terminal for Clipper Navigation&#x27;s Victoria Clipper hydrofoil service.) This move freed up Pier 66, which was demolished along with the Lenora Street Docks (Piers 64 and 65) to make way for the present-day Pier 66/Bell Street Pier, completed in 1996. That pier includes extensive public space, including (as had been briefly the case in the 1910s) a rooftop park. Bell Street Pier also includes the Bell Harbor International Conference Center; across the street is Seattle&#x27;s World Trade Center, completed 1998.

=== Into the 21st Century ===
The Bell Street Pier Cruise Terminal opened in 2000, bringing heavy cruise ships to Seattle for the first time in decades, with Seattle as home port for ships from Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International. A second portion of the terminal opened the following year, and by 2003 Holland America Line and Princess Cruises were running cruises to Alaska from a temporary cruise berths at Terminal 30. It was estimated in 2011 that each home port ship call puts US$2 million into the Seattle economy. However, there are significant adverse environmental effects. These have been somewhat, though not entirely, mitigated by a ban on discharge of untreated sewage by cruise ships, and by an arrangement with Seattle City Light to provide shore power to the ships so that they do not need to run their engines while in port. The Smith Cove Cruise Terminal opened at Pier 91 in 2009, providing Holland America Line and Princess Cruises with a more permanent Seattle facility; Terminal 30 reverted to use as a container terminal as a part of an expanded Terminal 28.

In the wake of the September 11 attacks, security became a major priority. Besides the well-known measures at airports, there was also a major increase in seaport security, though it remains the case that the vast majority of containers ship without their contents ever being inspected.

Another round of West Coast maritime labor disputes in September 2022 ultimately worked in Seattle and Tacoma&#x27;s favor, when they cleared their backups from the strike much more rapidly than the Southern California ports. Some of the shipping traffic that was diverted to the Puget Sound ports at that time led to continued business in the years after. In the first decade of the 21st Century, the Port of Seattle had several record-setting years for both container traffic and grain shipments. As of 2008, the grain terminal at Pier 86 handled 6.4 million metric tons of grain, mostly from the American Midwest, although this number decreased in the following recession.

In 2007, Tay Yoshitani joined the organization as CEO. Soon after the start of his tenure, major scandals broke about the Port. It came out that there had been a significant problem with racist and pornographic emails among the Port of Seattle police, and the Port Commissioners declared that a prior investigation had been &quot;poorly conducted on all levels.&quot; After hiring a new chief of the port police, the organization began to regain its footing, only to be thrust in the spotlight again when former CEO Mic Dinsmore claimed that a sizable severance had been authorized by the commission. The organization refused to pay and the claim was dropped, though the situation led to an attempted recall of one commissioner. In December that year, the State Auditor&#x27;s Office issued a report critical of the Port&#x27;s contracting practices (particularly those related to construction of the third runway). The audit report sparked an investigation by the Department of Justice, but the investigation was closed without action.

Newly elected commissioners and CEO Yoshitani implemented a series of reforms, including increased commission oversight of port construction projects and consolidation of the organization&#x27;s procurement activities into one division to afford better control. Yoshitani also increased commitment to environmental practices. The port has many environmental programs, including shore power for cruise ships and a plan to clean up the Lower Duwamish Waterway (in partnership with Boeing, King County, and the City of Seattle). The Ports of Seattle and Tacoma have been able to turn certain environmental concerns to their advantage, as a 2009 study that the Port commissioned from Herbert Engineering showed a significantly lower carbon footprint for shipping from Asia through Puget Sound and then by rail to the Midwest than for shipping to other West Coast ports or through the Panama Canal. However, increased container and cruise traffic has increased community concerns, just as the new runway did.

In 2012, port commissioners began outreach on the Century Agenda, a strategic plan for the port&#x27;s next 25 years. That same year, the Port became one of the most vocal opponents of the proposal to build a new arena in the Stadium District, which they said would cause issues for its operations. The City of Seattle studied the port&#x27;s concerns at length and found them to be lacking in factual data or extensive studies.

===Alliance with Tacoma===
The possibility of merging the Ports of Seattle and Tacoma was seriously entertained as early as the 1980s, when Sea-Land abandoned Seattle for Tacoma, followed by K Line and Evergreen Marine Corporation. While Tacoma was clearly the winner in these particular transactions, both port systems were aware that they were being played off against one another.

On October 7, 2014, the Port of Seattle and Port of Tacoma announced an agreement to &quot;jointly market and operate the marine terminals of both ports as a single entity,&quot; though they were not merging. Joint operations began with the formation of the Northwest Seaport Alliance on August 4, 2015, creating the third-largest cargo gateway in the United States; by the end of the year, it reported more than 3.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units handled by the two ports, an increase of 4 percent.

== Politics and the Port ==
The Port of Seattle has been something of a political football. While it was conceived in no small part as a counterweight to powerful corporations, those very corporations have a strong interest in trying to dominate the Port and make it serve their ends. From the outset, the railroads, the city&#x27;s two leading newspapers (&quot;The Seattle Times&quot; and the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;), and the city&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce, urged that the Port use its powers of taxation, bonding, and condemnation in support of what would now be called public–private partnerships. The initial three-man Port Commission was a compromise team that ran as a slate: former State Lands Commissioner Robert Bridges, a strong Progressive;
Charles Remsberg, a Republican banker; and recently retired Army Corps of Engineers brigadier general Hiram M. Chittenden, who was expected to hold down the center. In the event, Remsberg proved to be less of a friend to the monied interests than expected. While the Port&#x27;s initial plans proposed a mix of straight-out public ownership of some facilities and a major facility on Harbor Island along the lines of New York City&#x27;s Bush Terminal, the latter set a high bar for the Pacific Terminal Company to issue performance bonds. That organization never succeeded in raising the required US$310,000, and voters assented to a proposal that shifted the &quot;Bush Terminal&quot; money to publicly owned facilities on the mainland side of the East Waterway.

Owning and operating facilities themselves allowed the Port to set rates so as to promote trade, rather than to maximize their own profits. It also let them set up a &quot;closed shop&quot;: in this era, and as long as Robert Bridges remained on the commission, all Port facilities were unionized. Naturally, these policies did not sit well with the established interests. Still, the outbreak of World War I brought even more traffic to the Port than the expected opening of the Panama Canal, and the recent investments meant Seattle had the most modern port facilities on the U.S. West Coast, while providing the lowest port costs, which stilled criticism for the moment. In the second quarter of 1915, Seattle alone saw more foreign trade than the entire state of California; its 1918 tonnage set a high-water mark that would not be matched again until 1965. Shipbuilding boomed as well, notably the short-lived but dramatic success of Skinner &amp; Eddy.

Still, this was a period in which American politics were not moving in the direction of Progressivism. As president of the Port Commission once Chittenden stepped down in 1915, Robert Bridges staked out a series of rather radical positions: he defied a Supreme Court order to stop selling low-priced ice to fishermen, stood firm on the &quot;closed shop&quot; policy, and opposed U.S. entry into the War to the extent that he forbade Port employees from participating in a 1916 Preparedness Parade. Up until shortly before U.S. entry into the War, he generally got his way, but in March 1917 several proposals of his were defeated at the polls. Remsberg was defeated for reelection in 1918, and Bridges found himself distinctly in the minority on an increasingly conservative Commission. He resigned his seat in August 1919. His continued activist career (including a run for governor) was cut short by his death on December 21, 1921.

The new commissioners—W.S. Lincoln, George B. Lamping, and now-former mayor Cotterill—took the Port in a very different direction: wharf rates were raised to the same range as the private dock companies, port land was leased to private companies to build terminals, and the &quot;closed shop&quot; era ended; after a series of futile strikes, a company union and hiring hall was established (although, unlike many other facilities, the Port never attempted to prevent individual International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association—ILA—members from hiring on). It would be over a decade later, amidst the Great Depression, before the Port facilities truly unionized again.

The commission&#x27;s conservative politics through the 1920s turned in a more mixed direction in the first years of the Depression. It favored pay cuts over layoffs, increased its advertising in the American Midwest and in Asia, and for a time maintained labor peace by continuing to pay union scale to stevedores and longshoremen. Still, once the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act triggered retaliation by other countries and a general decline in international trade, revenues declined even further, and a series of elections between 1932 and 1934 swept in an entirely new Commission whose campaign pledges of austerity ultimately amounted to smaller changes than might have been imagined: decreasing direct operations and leasing out more Port facilities.

Around this time, the Port was rocked by scandal: it turned out that since 1920, Port Auditor Matt Gormley, Cotterill&#x27;s brother-in-law, had been making small, informal loans of Port funds to Port employees. Gormley, who killed himself as soon as the scandal broke, appears never to have personally profited from these schemes, although some other Port officials almost certainly did, and Gormley had juggled the books to cover for US$70,000 of loans that were never repaid. Cotterill, already voted out of office, and a &quot;lame duck&quot; at the time the scandal broke, had apparently received at least one loan for $190; it is unclear whether he had paid it back.

This scandal coincided with the start of the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike, a particularly complicated situation in Seattle. Not only was the ILA faced off against the Waterfront Employers Association (WEA), but the Port and the Teamsters&#x27; Union both wavered in between, and newly elected Seattle mayor Charles L. Smith outflanked the Employers Association, undercutting a tentative agreement with the ILA by declaring a &quot;state of emergency&quot; and ordering Seattle police to open port operations by force. The result was a violent and deadly confrontation known as the &quot;Battle of Smith Cove&quot;, followed by federal arbitration that gave the longshoremen almost everything they had initially asked for, and made Seattle a &quot;union port&quot;, which it has remained ever since. However, this and further labor confrontations in the following years left Seattle with a &quot;reputation in business circles as the least cooperative port on the coast&quot;; sending the port into decline until the coming of World War II.

The war led to a common cause among management and labor, but the militant International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), which had broken away from the ILA in 1937, still harbored strong memories of 1934. In the context of Seattle&#x27;s and the Port&#x27;s relatively weak post-war economy, the start of the Cold War, a generally conservative Port Commission, and the even more hardline WEA, the Seattle longshoremen walked out on September 1, 1948, as did their co-workers up and down the West Coast. Despite red-baiting and the relatively anti-labor Taft–Hartley Act, the ILWU won their fight. Seattle&#x27;s Griffiths and &amp; Sprague Stevedoring Company was the first to reach an agreement with the union; the soon Port followed their lead; and while the WEA held out for 95 days, once it became clear that Harry Truman and the Democratic Party would remain in control of the federal government, they also came to the table and negotiated. The result was such a blow to the WEA that it soon merged into the American Shipowners Association, forming the Pacific Maritime Association.

As discussed above (see section &quot;The Fifties&quot;), this labor militancy combined with a lack of leadership vision and several other factors to make for lackluster post-war performance by the Port, extending into the early 1960s. At best, despite the greatly expanded U.S. economy, the Port managed a level of shipping comparable to the 1920s. This led to a series of reforms. The early 1960s saw an expanded Port Commission, but in more of a policy-setting role, with day-to-day operations in the hands of an increasingly professionalized bureaucracy.

Like any other government entity, the Port was affected by the realignment of American politics: the rising anti-war movement, the civil rights and women&#x27;s movements, but above all the environmental movement. The Sea-Tac Communities plan, developed over a period of three years and adopted in 1976, established a comprehensive framework to compensate homeowners and other property owners affected by airport noise. The first large-scale plan of its kind in the U.S., the plan bought some property outright, and provided noise insulation for many other houses. Nonetheless, some neighbors remained unsatisfied. Two decades later, an even heftier controversy arose over adding a third runway at Sea-Tac. While the Port ultimately got its way, that happened only after a lengthy legal battle with the governments of nearly all the communities surrounding the airport.

Also controversial was the Pier 86 Grain Terminal (completed 1970), which intruded upon the views of Elliott Bay from Seattle&#x27;s elite Queen Anne neighborhood, while unloading from &quot;loud[ly] clanking&quot; railroad cars left &quot;clouds of wafting grain-dust&quot;. While the economically successful grain terminal is still there , there have been mitigation measures, including landscaping and public pedestrian and bicycle paths in what is now the Port-owned Centennial Park.

Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Davis (elected 1986) and Paige Miller (elected 1988), were the first women ever elected to the Port Commission. Both arrived in their roles as seasoned community activists, and both influenced the Port to take on broader concerns than just commerce. They influenced the Port to engage more with affected communities and to concern itself more with shoreline environmental issues and with the then-decrepit state of some parts of Seattle&#x27;s waterfront, particularly areas that were not owned by the Port. Conversely, Mic Dinsmore, a key figure in the Port bureaucracy beginning in 1985 and its longest-serving executive director (1992–2007) was often criticized as &quot;aggressive&quot; or &quot;domineering&quot;.

In the Dinsmore years, the Port was a strong supporter of NAFTA and was a key player in bringing the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 to Seattle, which met with massive protests. The resulting confrontation led to Norm Stamper&#x27;s resignation as police chief of Seattle, and may have been a factor in mayor and former Port Commissioner Paul Schell&#x27;s defeat in the 2001 mayoral primary election.

===Environmental issues===
Since at least the 1970s, the Port of Seattle has actively engaged with certain environmental issues, while being criticized on others.

In the 1970s, Sea-Tac became the first U.S. airport to hire a full-time wildlife biologist, with the intent to control species that could be dangerous to aviation while promoting conservation of other species. When the Port purchased the heavily polluted Lockheed Yard 2 land north of Terminal 5 in the 1980s, Lockheed took on responsibility to remediate the land portion of the site, and the Port took on responsibility for the underwater portion. That site is now open to the public as Jack Block Park. Various engagements with community groups over recent decades have resulted in a significant number of parks on Port land (&quot;see list below&quot;).

In 2015, an agreement to berth Royal Dutch Shell semi-submersible offshore drilling rigs at the Port&#x27;s Terminal 5 led to protests against Arctic drilling.

==Seattle–Tacoma International Airport==

The same 1941 state law that gave public ports special powers to issue defense-related bonds also empowered them to build and operate airports. King County-operated Boeing Field was already straining its capacity before the war. With the war (and the expansion of Boeing production), the military took over not only that airport but McChord Field to the south in Pierce County (still an Air Force base ) and Paine Field to the north in Snohomish County. In March 1942, the Port Commission voted to build Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (or as it is commonly known, Sea-Tac) south of town, half-way to Tacoma. The runways were completed by October 1944; during remaining months of the war, Sea-Tac was used almost entirely to ship out Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers.

Although a handful of commercial aircraft used Sea-Tac even during the war, and scheduled service began in 1947, the &quot;primitive&quot; facilities were clearly inadequate. A November 1946 bond issue resulted in construction of &quot;America&#x27;s most advanced airport terminal,&quot; which opened July 9, 1949 (at which time &quot;International&quot; was added to the airport&#x27;s official name). The airport was repeatedly expanded over the years, The airport covers only , but serves an amount of air traffic out of proportion to its size. , 31 airlines operate at SEA, serving 91 domestic and 28 international destinations.

==Art collection==
As part of the 1973 expansion of the facilities at Sea-Tac, the Port commissioned US$300,000 of original art. The first such purchase by a U.S. airport, these works were the start of an extensive art collection owned by the Port, on display in both public areas and office spaces of various Port facilities. In recent years () the Port has emphasized acquiring works by women, people of color, LGBTQ+ artists, and (especially) indigenous artists. Of 111 pieces in the airport collection as of 2021, 35 were by artists of color and 54 by female artists. Another recent initiative is to focus a significant portion of the Port&#x27;s art budget on conservation of works already owned by the Port.

In 2012, the Port began a related program of musical performances at the airport by local musicians. At the time the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily shut down this initiative in 2020, 115 different performers and groups had participated. In 2018 alone, there were 1,452 musical performances at Sea-Tac.

==Parks and other public facilities==
In the course of its operations, the Port has ended up owning and operating a number of parks and other similar public facilities. Among these are:
* Bridge Gear Park in the south west corner of Terminal 18 on Harbor Island
* Centennial Park (formerly Elliott Bay Park)
* Duwamish River People&#x27;s Park and Shoreline Habitat
* Fishermen&#x27;s Terminal, which is a working marina for fishing vessels and recreational vessels, but is largely open to the general public; it includes the &quot;Seattle Fishermen&#x27;s Memorial&quot;.
* həʔapus Village Park and Shoreline Habitat (formerly Terminal 107 Park), near the Duwamish Longhouse on the west shore of the Duwamish Waterway.
* Jack Block Park (formerly Terminal 5 Park), north of Terminal 5, includes an observation tower.
* Salmon Cove Park and Shoreline Habitat (formerly Turning Basin #3), on the west shore of the Duwamish Waterway.
* sbəq̓ʷaʔ Park and Shoreline Habitat (formerly Terminal 108/Diagonal Park), on the east shore of the Duwamish Waterway.
* Shilshole Bay Marina, including the Leif Erickson statue, public fishing pier and over a mile of public promenade.
* t̓ałt̓ałucid Park and Shoreline Habitat (formerly 8th Ave. South Park) on the west shore of the Duwamish in the South Park neighborhood.
* Terminal 115 Public Access
* Terminal 18 Park, on Harbor Island along the West Waterway of the Duwamish, slightly north of the West Seattle Bridge.
* Terminal 91 Bike Trail (part of the Elliott Bay Trail)
* t̓uʔəlaltxʷ Village Park and Shoreline Habitat (formerly Terminal 105 Park) on the west shore of the Duwamish Waterway at 4260 W Marginal Way SW.

==Long-term impoundment==
A Porsche 959 imported by Bill Gates and Paul Allen was stored at the Port of Seattle for 13 years from 1987 by the Customs Service, until regulations were changed to allow vehicles of &quot;historical or technological significance&quot; to be imported with severe limitations on their use. Gates and Allen both helped pass the &quot;Show or Display&quot; law.

<doc id="827735" wikidata="Q331357" url="?curid=827735" title="Escutcheon (heraldry)">
<text>In heraldry, an escutcheon (, ) is a shield that forms the main or focal element in an achievement of arms. The word can be used in two related senses. In the first sense, an escutcheon is the shield upon which a coat of arms is displayed. In the second sense, an escutcheon can itself be a charge within a coat of arms.

Escutcheon shapes are derived from actual shields that were used by knights in combat, and thus are varied and developed by region and by era. Since shields have been regarded as military equipment appropriate for men only, British ladies customarily bear their arms upon a lozenge, or diamond-shape, while clergymen and ladies in continental Europe bear their arms upon a cartouche, or oval. Other shapes are also in use, such as the roundel commonly used for arms granted to Aboriginal Canadians by the Canadian Heraldic Authority, or the Nguni shield used in African heraldry (likewise, Christian organisations and Masonic bodies tend to use the same shape, also known as a vesica piscis).

Although an escutcheon can be used as a charge on its own, the most common use of an escutcheon charge is to display another coat of arms as a form of marshalling. Such escutcheon charges are usually given the same shape as the main shield. When there is only one escutcheon charge, it is sometimes called an inescutcheon.

The word &quot;escutcheon&quot; (late 15th century) is based on Old North French &quot;escuchon&quot; (&#x27;shield&#x27;).

==Shapes==
The earliest depictions of proto-heraldic shields in the second half of the 12th century still have the shape of the Norman kite shield used throughout the 11th and 12th centuries. By about the 1230s, shields used by heavy cavalry had become shorter and more triangular, now called heater shields.

Transitional forms intermediate between kite and heater are seen in the late 12th to early 13th centuries. Transition to the heater was essentially complete by 1250. For example, the shield of William II Longespée (d. 1250) shown with his effigy at Salisbury Cathedral is triangular, while the shield shown on the effigy of his father William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury (d. 1226) is still of a more elongated form.

The shield on the enamel monument to Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou (d. 1151) is of almost full-body length. 
The heater was used in warfare during the apogee of the Age of Chivalry, at about the time of the Battle of Crecy (1346) and the founding of the Order of the Garter (1348). The shape is therefore used in armorials from this &quot;classical age&quot; of heraldry.

Beginning in the 15th century, and even more throughout the early modern period, a great variety of escutcheon shapes developed.
In the Tudor era the heraldic escutcheon became more square, taking the shape of an inverted Tudor arch. Continental European designs frequently use the various forms used in jousting, which incorporate &quot;mouths&quot; used as lance rests into the shields; such escutcheons are known as &quot;à bouche&quot;. The mouth is correctly shown on the dexter side only, as jousting pitches were designed for right-handed knights. Heraldic examples of English shields &quot;à bouche&quot; can be seen in the spandrels of the trussed timber roof of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Hall, London.

The shape of the top, the sides and the base may be separately described, and these elements may be freely combined. The highly complex Baroque style shields of the 17th century come in many artistic variations.

===Lozenge===
In English heraldry, the lozenge has been used by women since the 13th century for the display of their coats of arms instead of the escutcheon or shield, which are associated with warfare. In this case the lozenge is shown without crest or helm. For the practical purpose of categorisation the lozenge may be treated as a variety of heraldic escutcheon.

Traditionally, very limited categories of women would have been able to display their own arms, for example a female monarch—who uses an escutcheon as a military commander, not a lozenge—and &quot;suo jure&quot; peeresses, who may display their own arms alone on a lozenge even if married.
In general a woman was represented by her paternal arms impaled by the arms of her husband on an escutcheon as a form of marshalling.

In modern Canadian heraldry, and certain other modern heraldic jurisdictions, women may be granted their own arms and display these on an escutcheon. 
Life peeresses in England display their arms on a lozenge.
An oval or cartouche is occasionally also used instead of the lozenge for armigerous women.

As a result of rulings of the English Kings of Arms dated 7 April 1995 and 6 November 1997, married women in England, Northern Ireland and Wales and in other countries recognising the jurisdiction of the College of Arms in London (such as New Zealand) also have the option of using their husband&#x27;s arms alone, marked with a small lozenge as a difference to show that the arms are displayed for the wife and not the husband; or of using their own personal arms alone, marked with a small shield as a brisure for the same reason.
Divorced women may theoretically until remarriage use their ex-husband&#x27;s arms differenced with a mascle.
Widowed women normally display a lozenge-shaped shield impaled, unless they are heraldic heiresses, in which case they display a lozenge-shaped shield with the unaltered escutcheon of pretence in the centre. Women in same-sex marriages may use a shield or banner to combine arms, but can use only a lozenge or banner when one of the spouses dies.

==Points==
The points of the shield refer to specific positions thereon and are used in blazons to describe where a charge should be placed.


==Inescutcheon==
An inescutcheon is a smaller escutcheon that is placed within or superimposed over the main shield of a coat of arms. In practice, the words &quot;inescutcheon&quot; and &quot;escutcheon&quot; are often used interchangeably.

==Pelta escutcheon==
The current diplomatic emblem of France incorporates the pelta escutcheon, a wide form of shield (or gorget) with a small animal head pointing inward at each end.
This is Roman in origin; although not the shape of their classic shield, many brooches of this shape survive from antiquity.
A form of pelta appears as a decoration above the head of every official on the Austerlitz table, commissioned by Napoleon for propaganda purposes.
==Console==
The term &quot;console&quot; in architecture is generally used for elements which provide support, such as corbels on a console table. A console in heraldry is a decorative frame or support, generally in an architectural or illustrative context, surrounding a heraldic shield or escutcheon, which serves to add interest to and mitigate the harshness of the stark outline of the shield.

<text>A shield is a large area of exposed Precambrian crystalline igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks that form tectonically stable areas. These rocks are older than 570 million years and sometimes date back to around 2 to 3.5 billion years. They have been little affected by tectonic events following the end of the Precambrian, and are relatively flat regions where mountain building, faulting, and other tectonic processes are minor, compared with the activity at their margins and between tectonic plates.
Shields occur on all continents.

==Terminology==

The term shield cannot be used interchangeably with the term craton. However, shield can be used interchangeably with the term basement. The difference is that a craton describes a basement overlain by a sedimentary platform while shield only describes the basement.

The term &quot;shield&quot;, used to describe this type of geographic region, appears in the 1901 English translation of &quot;Eduard Suess&#x27;s Face of Earth&quot; by H. B. C. Sollas, and comes from the shape &quot;not unlike a flat shield&quot; of the Canadian Shield which has an outline that &quot;suggests the shape of the shields carried by soldiers in the days of hand-to-hand combat.&quot;

==Lithology==
A shield is that part of the continental crust in which these usually Precambrian basement rocks crop out extensively at the surface. Shields can be very complex: they consist of vast areas of granitic or granodioritic gneisses, usually of tonalitic composition, and they also contain belts of sedimentary rocks, often surrounded by low-grade volcano-sedimentary sequences, or greenstone belts. These rocks are frequently metamorphosed greenschist, amphibolite, and granulite facies. It is estimated that over 50% of Earth&#x27;s shields surface is made up of gneiss.

==Erosion and landforms==
Being relatively stable regions, the relief of shields is rather old, with elements such as peneplains being shaped in Precambrian times. The oldest peneplain identifiable in a shield is called a &quot;primary peneplain&quot;; in the case of the Fennoscandian Shield, this is the Sub-Cambrian peneplain.

The landforms and shallow deposits of northern shields that have been subject to Quaternary glaciation and periglaciation are distinct from those found closer to the equator. Shield relief, including peneplains, can be protected from erosion by various means. Shield surfaces exposed to sub-tropical and tropical climate for long enough time can end up being silicified, becoming hard and extremely difficult to erode. Erosion of peneplains by glaciers in shield regions is limited. In the Fennoscandian Shield, average glacier erosion during the Quaternary has amounted to tens of meters, though this was not evenly distributed. For glacier erosion to be effective in shields, a long &quot;preparation period&quot; of weathering under non-glacial conditions may be a requirement.

In weathered and eroded shields, inselbergs are common sights.

==List of shields==

* The Canadian Shield forms the nucleus of North America and extends from Lake Superior on the south to the Arctic Islands on the north, and from western Canada eastward across to include most of Greenland.
*The Atlantic Shield
** The Amazonian (Brazilian) Shield on the eastern bulge portion of South America. Bordering this is the Guiana Shield to the north, and the Platian Shield to the south.
** The Uruguayan Shield
* The Baltic (Fennoscandian) Shield is located in eastern Norway, Finland and Sweden.
* The African (Ethiopian) Shield is located in Africa.
* The Tuareg Shield is located in northern Africa, primarily within southern Algeria, northern Mali, and western Niger.
* The Australian Shield occupies most of the western half of Australia.
* The Arabian-Nubian Shield on the western edge of Arabia.
* The Antarctic Shield.
* In Asia, an area in China and North Korea is sometimes referred to as the China-Korean Shield.
* The Angaran Shield, as it is sometimes called, is bounded by the Yenisey River on the west, the Lena River on the east, the Arctic Ocean on the north, and Lake Baikal on the south.
* The Indian Shield occupies two-thirds of the southern Indian peninsula.

<doc id="827743" wikidata="Q2524603" url="?curid=827743" title="Highsider">
<text>A highsider or high-side is a type of motorcycle accident characterized by sudden and violent rotation of the bike around its longitudinal axis. This generally happens when the rear wheel loses traction, skids, and then suddenly regains traction, causing the rider to be thrown head-first from the side of the motorcycle or over the handlebars.

Highsiders differ from lowsiders as follows: during a lowsider, the rear wheel slips laterally and continuously until the bike falls onto its inner, or &quot;low&quot;, side, while during a highsider, the rear wheel slips laterally briefly before suddenly regaining traction and flipping the bike onto its outer, or &quot;high&quot; side. As a result, highsiders happen very quickly and violently with little, if any, warning.

== Technical explanation ==
Forces occurring between the motorcycle and the road (such as those that result in accelerating, decelerating and turning) occur at the contact patch through friction and normal forces. There is a limited amount of force tangential to the road that the contact patch can transmit before the tire begins to lose traction, and therefore slide or skid.

When cornering on a motorcycle, centripetal force (in addition to other lateral forces such as acceleration or deceleration) is transferred from the road to the motorcycle through the contact patch, and is directed at a right angle to the path of travel. If the combined net force is greater than the static friction coefficient of the tire multiplied by the normal force of the motorcycle through the tire, the tire will skid outwards from the direction of the curve.

Once a tire slips in a curve, it will begin to move outwards from under the motorcycle. What happens from there depends on how well the rider is able to restore balance and control. If the tire regains traction after the rider starts to skid while the motorcycle is moving sideways, the tire will stop its sideways movement, causing the motorcycle to suddenly jerk into an upright position (and beyond). This movement can easily cause the rider to be thrown off.

The initial traction loss may be caused by:

* A new tire with wax or a similar compound on the sides of the tire tread, or the sides of the tread not having been broken in
* Locking the rear wheel through excessive braking
* An incorrect downshifting technique that produces excessive engine braking, even if the motorcycle has a slipper clutch
* Applying too much throttle when exiting a corner
* Oversteering into the turn by shifting weight to the front wheel and using balance to drift the rear wheel sideways
* Exceeding lateral grip through too much speed (although this is more likely to result in a lowsider), or too much lean
* An unexpected change in surface friction (water, oil, dust, gravel, etc.)
* Reduced rear tire grip via scraping another part of the motorcycle on the road surface

If the wheels are not aligned in the direction of travel when traction is suddenly restored and the rear tire stops slipping, then a highside is likely, depending on how much the bike is turned across the direction of travel and how fast the bike is traveling when the rear tire regains traction. If the angle is high enough, the bike is moving fast enough, and the rear tire slips and regains traction suddenly enough, the rider has no chance of preventing a highside.

==Injury risks==

The term &quot;highsider&quot; derives from the side of the motorcycle from which the rider is thrown. If forcibly thrown over the bike, the rider is said to have dismounted on the high side.

* The violent motion of the motorbike usually throws the rider several feet into the air, which can result in broken bones on impact with the road surface.
* As the highsider catches the rider unexpectedly, the rider&#x27;s limbs can be thrown into protrusions on the bike (usually the handlebars) and suffer contusions.
* The rider may be thrown ahead of the bike and is at risk of being hit and seriously injured by the bike, particularly if the rider stops quickly.

Because highsider accidents are so much more deadly than lowside accidents, the Motorcycle Safety Foundation recommends that if a rider locks the rear brake at higher speeds and the traction is good, the brake should not be released.

<doc id="827747" wikidata="Q7887698" url="?curid=827747" title="Cayman Democratic Party">
<text>The Cayman Democratic Party, formerly known as the United Democratic Party, was a political party in the Cayman Islands formed in late 2001 and collapsed in February 2021.

==History==
In the elections of 8 November 2000, with a turnout of 80%, only non-partisans were elected. After the election members of parliament formed the United Democratic Party, currently headed by McKeeva Bush.

The Cayman Democratic Party served as the opposition party in the Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands from 2013 to 2017. The party also previously served as opposition from May 2005-May 2009.

After the 2017 election, a coalition government between the Progressives, Democratic Party, and independents was announced where Alden McLaughlin of the Progressives would have remained as premier and Democratic leader Bush would have become speaker. However, a coalition agreement was later reached between the Democratic Party and all independent members apart from one to form a Bush-led “government of national unity;” this Democratic Party-Independent deal later fell through and the initial Progressive-Democratic-Independent deal was re-agreed to.

===Collapse===
Before the 2021 election, in December 2020, Democratic leader McKeeva Bush received a two-month suspended jail sentence for assaulting a woman in February 2020 leading to a no-confidence motion against him. Premier McLaughlin asked Governor Martyn Roper to dissolve Parliament on 14 February, triggering early elections instead of having the vote on the motion. In the lead-up to the election, the Democratic Party was described as &quot;[appearing] to be defunct&quot; as figures previously of the party (including Bush) instead contested as independents.

<text>Enos Edward &quot;Yakima&quot; Canutt (November 29, 1895 – May 24, 1986) was an American champion rodeo rider, actor, stuntman, and action director. He developed many stunts for films and the techniques and technology to protect stuntmen performing them.

== Early years ==
Yakima was born Enos Edward Canutt in the Snake River Hills near Colfax, Washington, one of five children of John Lemuel Canutt, a rancher, and his wife Nettie Ellen Stevens. He grew up in eastern Washington on a ranch near Penawawa Creek, founded by his grandfather. His father operated the ranch and also served a term in the state legislature.

Canutt&#x27;s formal education was limited to elementary school in Green Lake, then a suburb of Seattle. He gained the education for his life&#x27;s work on the family ranch, where he learned to hunt, trap, shoot, and ride.

Canutt first broke a wild bronco when he was 11. As a 16-year-old, he started bronco riding at the Whitman County Fair in Colfax in 1912, and at 17 he won the title of World&#x27;s Best Bronco Buster. Canutt started rodeo riding professionally and gained a reputation as a bronc rider, bulldogger, and all-around cowboy. It was at the 1914 Pendleton Round-Up that he got the nickname &quot;Yakima&quot; when a newspaper caption misidentified him. &quot;Yakima Canutt may be the most famous person NOT from Yakima, Washington&quot; says Elizabeth Gibson, author of &quot;Yakima, Washington&quot;. Winning second place at the 1915 Pendleton Round-Up brought attention from show promoters, who invited Canutt to compete around the country.

&quot;I started in major rodeos in 1914, and went through to 1923. There was quite a crop of us traveling together, and we would have special railroad cars and cars for the horses. We&#x27;d play anywhere from three, six, eight, ten-day shows. Bronc riding and bulldogging were my specialties, but I did some roping,&quot; said Canutt.
During the 1916 season, he became interested in divorcee Kitty Wilks, who had won the Lady&#x27;s Bronc-Riding Championship a couple of times. They married on July 20, 1917, while at a show in Kalispell, Montana; he was 21 and she 18. They divorced in 1922. While bulldogging in Idaho, Canutt suffered tears to his mouth and upper lip by a bull&#x27;s horn; after getting stitches, he returned to the competition. A plastic surgeon corrected the injury a year later.

== Career ==
=== Rodeo ===
Canutt won his first world championship at the Olympics of the West in 1917 and won more championships in the next few years. In between rodeos, he broke horses for the French government in World War I. In 1918, he went to Spokane to enlist in the United States Navy and was stationed in Bremerton. In the fall, he was given a 30-day furlough to defend his rodeo title. He was discharged in spring 1919. At the 1919 Calgary Stampede, he competed in the bucking event and met Pete Knight.

He traveled to Los Angeles for a rodeo, and decided to winter in Hollywood, where he met screen personalities. Tom Mix, who had also started in rodeos, invited him to be in two of his pictures. Mix added to his flashy wardrobe by borrowing two of Canutt&#x27;s two-tone shirts and having his tailor make 40 copies. Canutt got his first taste of stunt work in a fight scene on a serial called &quot;Lightning Bryce&quot;; he left Hollywood to compete in the 1920 rodeo circuit.

Canutt won the saddle-bronc competition at the Pendleton Round-Up in 1917, 1919, and 1923 and came second in 1915 and 1929. He won the steer bulldogging in 1920 and 1921, and won the All-Around Police Gazette belt in 1917, 1919, 1920 and 1923. While in Hollywood in 1923 for an awards ceremony, he was offered eight Western action pictures for producer Ben Wilson at Burwillow Studios; the first was to be &quot;Riding Mad&quot;. He won the first leg of the Roosevelt Trophy as the cowboy who accumulated the most points between Cheyenne Frontier Days and the Pendleton Round-Up. After he won three years in a row at the Fort Worth Rodeo in Fort Worth, Texas, it came to be known as &quot;Yak&#x27;s show.&quot;

=== Acting ===
Canutt had been perfecting tricks such as the Crupper Mount, a leapfrog over the horse&#x27;s rump into the saddle. Douglas Fairbanks used some in his film &quot;The Gaucho&quot;. Fairbanks and Canutt became friends and competed regularly at Fairbanks&#x27;s gym. Canutt took small parts in pictures to get experience. It was in &quot;Branded a Bandit&quot; (1924) that his nose was broken in a 12-foot fall from a cliff. The picture was delayed several weeks, and when it resumed, Canutt&#x27;s close shots were from the side. A plastic surgeon reset the nose, which healed, inspiring Canutt to remark that he thought it looked better.

=== Stuntwork ===

When his contract with Wilson expired in 1927, Canutt made appearances at rodeos across the country. By 1928, the talkies were coming out, and though he had been in 48 silent pictures, Canutt knew his career was in trouble. His voice had been damaged from flu in the Navy. He started taking on bit parts and stunts, and realized more could be done with action in pictures.

In 1930, between pictures and rodeoing, Canutt met Minnie Audrea Yeager Rice at a party at her parents&#x27; home. They kept company during the next year while he picked up work on the serials for Mascot Pictures Corporation. They married on November 12, 1931, and had three children together. Two sons followed their father into stunt work.

When rodeo riders invaded Hollywood, they brought a battery of rodeo techniques that Canutt would expand and improve, including horse falls and wagon wrecks. He also developed the harnesses and cable rigs to make the stunts foolproof and safe. Among the new safety devices was the &#x27;L&#x27; stirrup, which released a rider&#x27;s foot if he was performing falling off a horse, so that he did not get hung in the stirrup. Canutt also developed cabling and equipment to cause spectacular wagon crashes, while releasing the team of horses, all on the same spot every time. Safety methods such as these saved film-makers time and money and prevented accidents and injury to performers and animals.

Canutt developed the &#x27;Running W&#x27; stunt, bringing down a horse at the gallop by attaching a wire, anchored to the ground, to its fetlocks and launching the rider forward spectacularly. This often killed or severely injured the horse, requiring it to be put down. At a minimum it was badly shaken and unusable for the rest of the day. The &#x27;Running W&#x27; is now banned and has been replaced with training for the falling-horse technique.

It is believed that the last time the Running W was used was on the 1983 Iraqi film &quot;Clash of Loyalties&quot;, when British actor and friend Marc Sinden and stuntman Ken Buckle (who had been trained by Canutt) performed the stunt three times during a cavalry charge sequence.

While working on Mascot serials, Canutt practiced and perfected his most famous stunts, including the drop from a stagecoach that he performed in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939). That stunt was filmed on Lucerne Dry Lake, north of Lucerne Valley, California. He first performed it in &quot;Riders of the Dawn&quot; (1937) while doubling for Jack Randall.

In his 1981 film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, Steven Spielberg paid homage to Canutt, recreating the stunt when stuntman Terry Leonard (doubling for Harrison Ford) &#x27;dropped&#x27; from the front of a German transport truck, was dragged underneath (along a prepared trench), and climbed up the back and round to the front again.
==== John Wayne ====
While at Mascot, Canutt met John Wayne while doubling for him in a motorcycle stunt for &quot;The Shadow of the Eagle&quot; (1932). Wayne admired Canutt&#x27;s agility and fearlessness, and Canutt respected Wayne&#x27;s willingness to learn and attempt his own stunts. Canutt taught Wayne how to fall off a horse.

The two worked together to create a technique that made on-screen fight scenes more realistic. Wayne and Canutt found if they stood at a certain angle in front of the camera, they could throw a punch at an actor&#x27;s face and make it look as if actual contact had been made.

Canutt and Wayne pioneered stunt and screen fighting techniques still in use. Wayne copied much of his on-screen persona from Canutt. The characterizations associated with Wayne – the drawling, hesitant speech and the hip-rolling walk – were pure Canutt. Said Wayne, &quot;I spent weeks studying the way Yakima Canutt walked and talked. He was a real cowhand.&quot; In 1934, the two appeared together in the Western &quot;Randy Rides Alone&quot;, in which Wayne starred and Canutt appeared as &quot;henchman Spike&quot;.

In 1932, Canutt&#x27;s first son Edward Clay was born and nicknamed Tap, short for &quot;Tapadero&quot;, a Spanish word for a stirrup covering. That year Canutt broke his shoulder in four places while trying to transfer from horse to wagon team. Though work was scarce during the Depression, he got by combining stunting and rodeo work.

In 1934, Herbert J. Yates of Consolidated Film Industries combined Monogram, Mascot, Liberty, Majestic, Chesterfield, and Invincible Pictures to form Republic Pictures. Canutt became Republic&#x27;s top stuntman. He handled all the action on many pictures, including Gene Autry films; and several series and serials, such as &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; and &quot;Zorro&quot;. For &quot;Zorro Rides Again&quot;, Canutt performed almost all the scenes in which Zorro wore a mask. As a result, he was on the screen as much as the star John Carroll. When the action was indicated in a Republic script, it said &quot;see Yakima Canutt for action sequences.&quot;

William Witney, one of Republic&#x27;s film directors, said:

There will probably never be another stuntman who can compare to Yakima Canutt. He had been a world champion cowboy several times and where horses were concerned he could do it all. He invented all the gadgets that made stunt work easier. One of his clever devices was a step that attached to the saddle so that he had leverage to transfer to another moving object, like a wagon or a train. Another was the &quot;shotgun,&quot; a spring-loaded device used to separate the tongue of a running wagon from the horses, thus cutting the horses loose. It also included a shock cord attached to the wagon bed, which caused wheels to cramp and turn the wagon over on the precise spot that was most advantageous for the camera.

In the 1936 film &quot;San Francisco&quot;, Canutt replaced Clark Gable in a scene in which a wall was to fall on the star. Canutt said: &quot;We had a heavy table situated so that I could dive under it at the last moment. Just as the wall started down, a girl in the scene became hysterical and panicked. I grabbed her, leaped for the table, but didn&#x27;t quite make it.&quot; The girl was unhurt but he broke six ribs.

==== Ramrod ====

Canutt tried to get into directing; he was growing older and knew his stunting days were numbered. Harry Joe, Canutt&#x27;s second son, was born in January 1937. Brothers Joe and Tap later got work as stuntmen with their father.

In 1938, Republic Pictures started expanding into bigger pictures and budgets. Canutt&#x27;s mentor and action director for the 1925 &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, Breezy Eason, was hired as second unit director, and Canutt to coordinate and ramrod the stunts. For Canutt, this meant not only hiring stuntmen and doing some stunts himself, but also laying out the action for the director and writing additional stunts.

John Ford hired Canutt on John Wayne&#x27;s recommendation for &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, where Canutt supervised the river-crossing scene as well as the Indian chase scene, did the stagecoach drop, and doubled for Wayne in the coach stunts. For safety during the stagecoach drop stunt, Canutt devised modified yokes and tongues to give extra handholds and extra room between the teams. Ford told him that whenever Ford made an action picture and Canutt wasn&#x27;t working elsewhere, he was on Ford&#x27;s payroll. Also in 1939, Canutt doubled Clark Gable in the burning of Atlanta in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. He also appeared as a renegade accosting Scarlett O&#x27;Hara (Vivien Leigh) as she crosses a bridge in a carriage driving through a shantytown.

=== Directing ===
In 1940, Canutt sustained serious internal injuries while doubling for Clark Gable in &quot;Boom Town&quot; (1940) when a horse fell on him. Though in discomfort for months after an operation to repair his bifurcated intestines, he continued to work. Republic&#x27;s Sol Siegel offered him the chance to direct the action sequences of &quot;Dark Command&quot;, starring Wayne and directed by Raoul Walsh. For &quot;Dark Command&quot;, Canutt fashioned an elaborate cable system to yank back the plummeting coach before it fell on the stuntman and horses; he also created a breakaway harness from which they were released before hitting the water.

In 1943, while doing a low budget Roy Rogers picture called &quot;Idaho,&quot; Canutt broke both his legs at the ankles in a fall off a wagon. He recovered to write the stunts and supervise the action for another Wayne film, &quot;In Old Oklahoma&quot;. In the next decade, Canutt became one of the best second unit and action directors. MGM brought Canutt to England in 1952 to direct the action and jousting sequences in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; with Robert Taylor. This would set a precedent by filming action abroad instead of on the studio lot. Canutt introduced many British stuntmen to Hollywood-style stunt training. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; was followed by &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot;, again with director Richard Thorpe and starring Robert Taylor. Canutt again was brought in for lavish action scenes in &quot;King Richard and the Crusaders&quot;.

In 1954, Canutt directed the Hollywood Western movie &quot;The Lawless Rider,&quot; starring Johnny Carpenter and Texas Rose Bascom.

Canutt directed the close-action scenes for Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960). He took five days to direct retakes that included the slave army rolling its flaming logs into the Romans, and other fight scenes featuring Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis and John Ireland.

==== &quot;Ben Hur&quot; ====
For &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), Canutt staged the chariot race with nine teams of four horses. He trained Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd to do their own charioteering. He and his crew spent five months on the race sequence. In contrast to the 1925 film, not one horse was hurt, and no humans experienced serious injuries. His son Joe Canutt, while doubling for Charlton Heston, cut his chin because he did not follow his father&#x27;s advice to hook himself to the chariot when Judah Ben-Hur&#x27;s chariot bounced over the wreck of another chariot.

==== Other films ====
Walt Disney brought Canutt in to do second unit work for &quot;Westward Ho, the Wagons!&quot; in 1956. He followed this first live action Western feature film with &quot;Old Yeller&quot; the next year. In 1960, Canutt worked with Disney on &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, which involved transporting many exotic animals to a remote island in the West Indies.

Anthony Mann specifically requested Canutt for the second unit for his &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961), where Canutt directed sons Joe and Tap, doubling for Charlton Heston and Christopher Rhodes, in a stunning tournament joust. &quot;Canutt was surely the most active stager of tournaments since the Middle Ages&quot; – from &quot;Swordsmen of the Screen.&quot; He was determined to make the combat scenes in &quot;El Cid&quot; the best that had been filmed. Mann again requested him for &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1964). Over the next 10 years, Canutt continued to work, bringing his talents to &quot;Cat Ballou&quot;, &quot;Khartoum&quot;, &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; and &quot;A Man Called Horse&quot; (1970).

In 1985, Yakima appeared as himself in &quot;Yak&#x27;s Best Ride&quot;, directed by John Crawford. His final screen credit was as a consultant for the stunts in &quot;Equus&quot;.

== Death ==
On May 24, 1986, Yakima Canutt died of cardiac arrest at the age of 90 at the North Hollywood Medical Center in North Hollywood, California. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Garden of Remembrance at the Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery. Canutt has a memorial plaque in the cemetery&#x27;s Portal of Folded Wings.

<text>Ann Turner Cook (born Ann Leslie Turner; November 20, 1926 – June 3, 2022) was an American educator and mystery novelist who was best known as the model for the familiar Gerber Baby artwork, seen on baby food packages of the Gerber Products Company.

==Early life and Gerber Baby history==

Born in Westport, Connecticut, she was the daughter of Bethel (Burson) and syndicated cartoonist Leslie Turner, who drew the comic strip &quot;Captain Easy&quot; for decades. The family&#x27;s neighbor was the artist Dorothy Hope Smith, who did a charcoal drawing of Ann when she was a baby. In 1928, when Gerber announced it was looking for baby images for its upcoming line of baby food, Smith&#x27;s drawing was submitted and subsequently chosen. It was trademarked in 1931. The drawing of Ann Turner Cook has since been used on virtually all Gerber baby food packaging. Cook&#x27;s identity was a secret until 1978. In 1990, Cook appeared as a guest on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in a one-on-one segment.

Her family moved to Orlando, Florida, later in her childhood. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Southern Methodist University and a master&#x27;s degree in English education from the University of South Florida. She was a sister in the sorority Pi Beta Phi.

==Career==
Cook taught at Oak Hill elementary school in Florida, and then at Madison Junior High School, in Tampa, Florida. In 1966, she joined the English Department of Tampa&#x27;s Hillsborough High School, where she eventually rose to being the school&#x27;s department chairwoman. Students there dedicated the &quot;1972 Hilsborean&quot; school yearbook to Cook, who sponsored the book. In it, students described her as &quot;a teacher who really communicates with the students&quot; and who, &quot;without any complaints ... has stayed late, worked nights, and with quiet efficiency supported her staff in their monumental task&quot;.

After retiring from teaching, Cook became a novelist. A member of the Mystery Writers of America, she was the author of the Brandy O&#x27;Bannon series of mystery novels set on Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast. The adventures of Florida reporter and amateur sleuth O&#x27;Bannon are detailed in &quot;Trace Their Shadows&quot; (2001) and &quot;Shadow over Cedar Key&quot; (2003). The latter title received a negative review from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, which stated the book had “An overly busy plot ... [and] is weighed down with limp prose and repetition.”

==Personal life and death==
She was married to James Cook, a criminologist with the Hillsborough County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, until his death in 2004. They had four children. 

Cook died of natural causes at her home in St. Petersburg, Florida, on June 3, 2022, at the age of 95.

<text>Hans Walter Conrad Veidt ( ; ; 22 January 1893 – 3 April 1943) was a German, later naturalised British actor. He attracted early attention for his roles in the films &quot;Different from the Others&quot; (1919), &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920), and &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; (1928). After a successful career in German silent films, where he was one of the best-paid stars of UFA, Veidt and his new Jewish wife Ilona Prager left Germany in 1933 after the Nazis came to power. The couple settled in Britain, where he took citizenship in 1939. Veidt subsequently appeared in many British films, including &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940). After emigrating to the United States around 1941, he was cast as Major Strasser in &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), his last film role to be released during his lifetime.

==Early life==

Hans Walter Conrad Veidt was born on 22 January 1893 in his parents&#x27; home at Tieckstraße 39 in Berlin to Amalie Marie (née Gohtz) and Philipp Heinrich Veidt, a former military man turned civil servant. Veidt would later recall, &quot;Like many fathers, he was affectionately autocratic in his home life, strict, idealistic. He was almost fanatically conservative.&quot; By contrast, Amalie was sensitive and nurturing. Veidt was nicknamed &quot;Connie&quot;, also spelled &quot;Conny&quot;, by his family and friends. His family was Lutheran, and Veidt was baptized on 26 March 1893. He was later confirmed in a ceremony at the Protestant Evangelical Church in Alt-Schöneberg, Berlin, on 5 March 1908. Veidt&#x27;s only sibling, an older brother named Karl, died in 1900 of scarlet fever at the age of 9. The family spent their summers in Potsdam.

Two years after Karl&#x27;s death, Veidt&#x27;s father fell ill and required heart surgery. Knowing that the family could not afford to pay the lofty fee that accompanied the surgery, the doctor charged only what the family could comfortably pay. Impressed by the surgeon&#x27;s skill and kindness, Veidt vowed to &quot;model my life on the man that saved my father&#x27;s life&quot; and he wished to become a surgeon. His hopes for a medical career were thwarted, though, when, in 1912, he graduated without a diploma and ranked 13th out of 13 pupils and became discouraged over the amount of study necessary for him to qualify for medical school.

A new career path for Veidt opened up in 1911 during a school Christmas play in which he delivered a long prologue before the curtain rose. The play was badly received, and the audience was heard to mutter, &quot;Too bad the others didn&#x27;t do as well as Veidt.&quot; Veidt began to study all of the actors he could and wanted to pursue a career in acting, much to the disappointment of his father, who called actors &#x27;gypsies&#x27; and &#x27;outcasts&#x27;.

With the money he raised from odd jobs and the allowance his mother gave him, Veidt began attending Berlin&#x27;s many theatres. He stood outside of the Deutsches Theater after every performance, waiting for the actors and hoping to be mistaken for one. In the late summer of 1912 he met a theatre porter who introduced him to actor Albert Blumenreich, who agreed to give Veidt acting lessons for six marks. He took 10 lessons before auditioning for Max Reinhardt, reciting Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. During Veidt&#x27;s audition, Reinhardt looked out of the window the entire time. He offered Veidt a contract as an extra for one season&#x27;s work, from September 1913 to August 1914 with a pay of 50 marks a month. During this time, he played bit parts as spear carriers and soldiers. His mother attended almost every performance. His contract with the Deutsches Theater was renewed for a second season, but by this time World War I had begun, and on 28 December 1914, Veidt enlisted in the Imperial German Army.

In 1915, he was sent to the Eastern Front as a non-commissioned officer and took part in the Battle of Warsaw. He contracted jaundice and pneumonia, and had to be evacuated to a hospital on the Baltic Sea. While recuperating, he received a letter from his girlfriend Lucie Mannheim, telling him that she had found work at the Front Theatre in Libau.

Intrigued, Veidt applied for the theatre as well. As his condition had not improved, the army allowed him to join the theatre so that he could entertain the troops. While performing at the theatre, his relationship with Mannheim ended. In late 1916, he was re-examined by the Army and deemed unfit for service; he was given a full discharge on 10 January 1917. Veidt returned to Berlin where he was readmitted to the Deutsches Theater. There, he played a small part as a priest that got him his first rave review, the reviewer hoping that &quot;God would keep Veidt from the films&quot; or &quot;God save him from the cinema!&quot;

==Career==

From 1917 until his death, Veidt appeared in more than 100 films. One of his earliest performances was as the murderous somnambulist Cesare in director Robert Wiene&#x27;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920), a classic of German Expressionist cinema, with Werner Krauss and Lil Dagover. His starring role in &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; (1928), as a disfigured young outcast servant whose face is cut into a permanent grin, provided the (visual) inspiration for the iconic Batman villain the Joker. Veidt starred in other silent horror films such as &quot;The Hands of Orlac&quot; (1924), also directed by Robert Wiene, &quot;The Student of Prague&quot; (1926) and &quot;Waxworks&quot; (1924), in which he played Ivan the Terrible. Veidt also appeared in Magnus Hirschfeld&#x27;s film &quot;Anders als die Andern&quot; (&quot;Different from the Others&quot;, 1919), one of the earliest films to sympathetically portray homosexuality, although the characters in it do not end up happily. He had a leading role in Germany&#x27;s first talking picture, &quot;Das Land ohne Frauen&quot; (&quot;Land Without Women&quot;, 1929).
He moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s and made a few films there, but the advent of talking pictures and his difficulty with speaking English led him to return to Germany. During this period, he lent his expertise to tutoring aspiring performers, one of whom was the later American character actress Lisa Golm.

==Emigration==

Veidt opposed the Nazi regime and later contributed funds for the relief of Britons during the German Blitz bombings. Soon after the Nazi Party took power in Germany, by March 1933, Joseph Goebbels was purging the film industry of political opponents and Jews. In April 1933, a week after Veidt&#x27;s marriage to Ilona Prager, a Jewish woman, also known as &quot;Lilli&quot; or &quot;Lily&quot;, the couple emigrated to Britain before any action could be taken against either of them.

Goebbels had imposed a &quot;racial questionnaire&quot; in which everyone employed in the German film industry had to declare their &quot;race&quot; to continue to work. When Veidt was filling in the questionnaire, he answered the question about his &quot;Rasse&quot; (race) by writing &quot;Jude&quot; (Jew). Veidt was not Jewish, but his wife was, and Veidt would neither renounce the woman he loved nor collaborate with the regime as many others did.

Veidt was opposed to antisemitism and showed solidarity with the German Jewish community, who were being stripped of their rights as German citizens in the spring of 1933. Veidt had been informed that if he divorced and declared support for the new regime, he could continue to act in Germany. Several other leading actors unsympathetic to the Nazis before 1933 switched allegiances. In answering the questionnaire by stating he was a Jew, Veidt rendered himself unemployable in Germany, but stated this sacrifice was worth it as there was nothing in the world that would compel him to break with his wife. Goebbels remarked that he would never act in Germany again. He was put under house arrest on Goebbels&#x27; orders after he voiced his wishes to act in the British film &quot;Jew Süss&quot; only after a diplomatic intervention on behalf of the British government was he allowed to leave. The German newspaper Völkischer Beobachter &quot;wrote on this in 1933 that &quot;It is known that the Jewish film production in England produced two coarse, sensational films for purposes of Jewish propaganda: the film Wandering Jew and a second film - Jud Süss. [...] Conrad Veidt plays leading roles in both. [...] Conrad Veidt was paid for this betrayal of his country – by the praise of the Jewish public. As such, he no longer possesses enough human dignity that even one single person should utter a word of praise for him.&quot;
After arriving in Britain, Veidt improved his English and starred in the original anti-Nazi versions of &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; (1933) and &quot;Jew Süss&quot; (1934). The latter film was directed by the exiled German-born director Lothar Mendes and produced by Michael Balcon for Gaumont-British. He naturalised as a British subject on 25 February 1939. By this point multi-lingual, Veidt made films both in French with expatriate French directors and in English, including three of his best-known roles for British director Michael Powell in &quot;The Spy in Black&quot; (1939), &quot;Contraband&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940).
===Later career in the US===

By 1941, he and Ilona had settled in Hollywood to assist in the British effort in making American films that might persuade the then-neutral and still isolationist United States to join the war against the Nazis, who at that time controlled all of continental Europe and were bombing the United Kingdom. Before leaving the UK, the Veidts gave a large portion of their life savings to the British government to help finance the war effort, and then provided an American home for an English child for the duration of the war. Realizing that Hollywood would most likely typecast him in Nazi roles, he had his contract mandate that they must always be villains.

He starred in a few films, such as George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Face&quot; (1941), where he received billing under Joan Crawford, and &quot;Nazi Agent&quot; (1942), in which he had a dual role as both an aristocratic German Nazi spy and the man&#x27;s twin brother, an anti-Nazi American. His best-known Hollywood role was as the sinister Major Heinrich Strasser in &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), a film which began pre-production before the United States entered World War II. Commenting about this well-received role, Veidt noted that it was an ironical twist of fate that he was praised &quot;for portraying the kind of character who had forced him to leave his homeland&quot;.

Ivan J. Rado, the nephew of Veidt&#x27;s third wife Lily, commented:The fact that he wanted to leave Hollywood had nothing to do with anything but his disgust at the parts offered him, which was mainly Nazis. In Above Suspicion, he is at some rally, and when at the end everyone goes &quot;Heil&quot;, he just very casually half lifts his right hand, more in a wave than a salute, and with an ironic smile on his face, which to me, embodies his feelings. ... The fact that he left Germany ... was his disgust at what was happening that made him move to London with Lily.

==Personal life==
Veidt enjoyed sports, gardening, swimming, golfing, classical music, and reading fiction (including occultism; Veidt once considered himself a powerful medium) and nonfiction.

===Marriages===
====Gussy Holl====
On 10 June 1918, Veidt married Gussy Holl, a cabaret entertainer. They had first met at a party in March 1918, and Conrad described her to friends as &quot;very lovely, tall, dignified and somewhat aloof&quot;. They separated in 1919 but attempted to reconcile multiple times. Holl and Veidt divorced in 1922.

Veidt said of Holl, &quot;She was as perfect as any wife could be. But I had not learnt how to be a proper husband,&quot; and &quot;I was elated by my success in my work, but shattered over my mother&#x27;s death, and miserable about the way my marriage seemed to be foundering. And one day when my wife was away, I walked out of the house, and out of her life, trying to escape from something I could put no name to.&quot; Holl later told Françoise Rosay, &quot;I excused a lot of his failings and whims because I loved him. But one day he did something to me that I couldn&#x27;t forgive. I was singing that evening at the cabaret. I left him home and he told me: &#x27;I invited a few friends; we&#x27;ll dine while we wait for you.&#x27; And it just so happened I had received a new dress from Paris. That evening, after work, I arrived home and what do I see? All these gentlemen dressed as women. And Conrad had put on my Paris dress. At this point, I divorced!&quot;

====Felizitas Radke====
Veidt&#x27;s second wife, Anna Maria &quot;Felizitas&quot; Radke, was from an aristocratic Austrian family. They met at a party in December 1922 or at a Charleston dance competition in 1923. Radke divorced her husband for him, and they married on 18 April 1923. Their daughter, Vera Viola Maria, nicknamed &quot;Kiki&quot; and also known as &quot;Viola&quot;, was born on 10 August 1925. Conrad was not present at her birth due to being in Italy working on &quot;The Fiddler of Florence&quot;, but took the first train to Berlin and wept as he met mother and child at the hospital; he was so hysterical from joy they had to sedate him and keep him in the hospital overnight.

Emil Jannings was Viola&#x27;s godfather and Elisabeth Bergner was her godmother. She was named after one of Bergner&#x27;s signature characters, Shakespeare&#x27;s Viola. The birth of his daughter helped Veidt move on from the death of his mother, who had died of a heart condition in January 1922.

From September 1926 to 1929 Veidt lived with his wife and daughter in a Spanish-style house in Beverly Hills. Veidt enjoyed relaxing and playing with his daughter in their home, and enjoyed the company of the immigrant community, including F. W. Murnau, Carl Laemmle, and Greta Garbo, as well as the American Gary Cooper. The family returned to Germany in 1929, and moved several times afterwards, including a temporary relocation to Vienna, Austria, while Veidt participated in a theatrical tour of the continent.

Radke and Veidt divorced in 1932, with Radke saying the frequent relocations and the separations necessitated by Veidt&#x27;s acting schedule frayed their marriage. Radke at first granted custody of their daughter to Veidt, but after further consideration he decided that their daughter needed the full-time parent. Conrad received generous visitation rights, and Viola called her summer vacations with her father &quot;The Happy Times&quot;. She stayed with him three or four months of the year until the outbreak of World War II.

Viola passed away on 2 February 2004 in New Orleans, Louisiana in the U.S.
====Lilli Greger====
Veidt last married Flora Ilona Barta Greger, a Hungarian Jew also known as &quot;Lilli&quot; or &quot;Lily&quot;, in Berlin 24 March 1933. They remained together until his death. The two had met at a club in Berlin.

Veidt said of Lilli in an October 1934 interview with &quot;The Sunday Dispatch&quot;, Lilli was the woman I had been seeking all my life. For her I was the man. In Lilli I found the miracle of a woman who had all to give that I sought, the perfect crystallisation in one lovely human being, of all my years of searching. Lilli had the mother complex too. But in the reverse ratio to mine. In her, the mother instinct was so powerful that she poured it out, indiscriminately almost, on everyone she knew. She mothers her own mother. Meeting Lilli was like coming home to an enchanted place one had always dreamed of, but never thought to reach. For her it was the same. Our marriage is not only flawless, it is a complete and logical union, as inevitable as daybreak after night, as harmonious and right as the words that exactly fit the music. My search is finished. The picture in my mind of my mother is of a woman great and holy. But it is a picture clear and distinct, a deep and humble memory of a woman no one could replace; but now it is not blurred by the complex which before had harassed my mind.

Veidt and Lilli moved from London to Los Angeles, arriving on 13 June 1940. They resided at 617 North Camden Drive in Beverly Hills.
===Wartime efforts===
Even after leaving England, Veidt was concerned over the plight of children cooped up in London air raid shelters, and he decided to try to cheer up their holiday. Through his lawyers in London, Veidt donated enough money to purchase 2,000 one-pound tins of candy, 2,000 large packets of chocolate, and 1,000 wrapped envelopes containing presents of British currency. The gifts went to children of needy families in various air raid shelters in the London area during Christmas 1940. The air raid shelter marshal wrote back to Veidt thanking him for the gifts. Noting Veidt&#x27;s unusual kindness, he stated in his letter to him, &quot;It is significant to note that, as far as is known to me, you are the only member of the Theatrical Profession who had the thought to send Christmas presents to the London children.&quot;

Veidt smuggled his parents-in-law from Austria to neutral Switzerland, and in 1935 he managed to get the Nazi government to let his ex-wife Radke and their daughter move to Switzerland. He also offered to help Felizitas&#x27; mother, Frau Radke, of whom he was fond, leave Germany. However, she declined. A proud, strong-willed woman who was attached to her home country, she declared that &quot;no damned little Austrian Nazi corporal&quot; was going to make her leave her home. She reportedly survived the war, but none of the Veidts ever saw her again.
===Sexuality===
Veidt was perhaps bisexual. During his youthful career in the decadent Weimar Republic cabaret-era he was part of the avant-garde, experimental artists&#x27; lifestyle, even cross-dressing.

Rado, while having a family interest, commented with insights consistent with the record available: 

... there are a few facts that I would like to share with everyone interested.

Aside from his work, which was also his life, there is little to know about Conny; he was an intensely private man who loved his home and his friends, but did not carouse in public nor was prey to scandalous behavior.

In his work, he was intense and generous, the consummate professional. ...

Early on he saw what was happening in Germany, and moved to London, where he did some important work in movies. He was not a political person, and was certainly not to be caught out on religious themes. The fact that his wife was Jewish meant nothing to him; they loved each other and loved being together. He was always honest, totally straight forward and kind. 

Shirley Conway, in her 1993 tribute, also comments, consistent with other reports of the man being somewhat different from the screen image, that &quot;Veidt surprised and delighted everyone with his modesty and ineffable charm.&quot;

He showed fondness and respect for women. In a 1941 interview he said, There are two different kinds of men. There are the men men, what do you call them, the man&#x27;s man, who likes men around, who prefers to talk with men, who says the female can never be impersonal, who takes the female lightly, as playthings. I do not see a man like that in my mirror. Perhaps, it is because I think the female and the male attract better than two men, that I prefer to talk with females. I do. I find it quite as stimulating and distinctly more comfortable. I have a theory about this – it all goes back to the mother complex. In every woman, the man who looks may find – his mother. The primary source of all his comfort. I think also that females have become too important just to play with. When men say the female cannot discuss impersonally, that is no longer so. When it is said that females cannot be geniuses, that is no longer so, either. The female is different from the male. Because she was born to be a mother. There is no doubt about that. But that does not mean that, in some cases, she is not also born a genius. Not all males are geniuses either. And among females today there are some very fine actresses, very fine; fine doctors, lawyers, even scientists and industrialists. I see no fault in any female when she wears slacks, smokes (unless it is on the street, one thing, the only thing, which I don&#x27;t like), when she drives a car ... when men say things like &quot;I bet it is a woman driving&quot; if something is wrong with the car ahead – no, no. These are old, worn out prejudices, they do not belong in today.

== Death and legacy ==
In the 1930s, Veidt learned that he had a heart condition which had killed his mother; the condition was aggravated by his chain smoking, and Veidt took nitroglycerin tablets.
He died of a heart attack on 3 April 1943 while playing golf at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles with singer Arthur Fields and his personal physician.

The Conrad Veidt Society (CVS) was formed in 1990 to commemorate his 1993 centennial of birth and then to find a final home for the Veidt ashes, which Lily Veidt&#x27;s nephew Ivan Rado had given to the society&#x27;s founder James H. Rathlesberger along with Veidt family papers and memorabilia. An earlier German-based Conrad Veidt Society had become inactive some years before the US-based society began.

The CVS motto &quot;Courage Integrity Humanity&quot; honored qualities the legendary film star exemplified while claiming to be &quot;only an actor.&quot;

CVS supported 1993 retrospectives at the Internationale Filmfestspiele in Berlin, La Cinematheque Francaise in Paris, the Goethe Institute and British Film Institute&#x27;s National Film Theatre in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, as well as the Gay Museum in Berlin. CVS donated most of the Veidt materials to the University of California&#x27;s Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. Among its efforts was a 650 Deutschmark/$450 contribution to the Stiftung Deutsche Kinemathek as seed money for SDK&#x27;s Homage to Conrad Veidt film series held during the 1993 Berlin International Film Festival.

Two Veidt scrapbooks, his monogrammed silver cigarette case and gold Dunhill lighter went to the Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Film, video and audio mix from a short film entitled &quot;Conny&quot; that Rado produced using memorabilia inherited from Lily was donated to the University of Southern California Max Kade Institute and UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive. The PFA in Berkeley has a VHS tape of the film, as does the Max Kade Institute and the Ayn Rand Institute. 

CVS reached out to German film officials who wished to receive the Veidt ashes but hesitated to act following controversies surrounding similar honors for Marlene Dietrich. After efforts stalled to take the Veidt ashes to Berlin, CVS raised funds for interment at Golders Green, close to where the Veidts had lived in London. Londoner Vivienne Phillips was instrumental in arranging this. On 3 April 1998, on the 55th anniversary of his passing, Veidt&#x27;s ashes, mixed in the original urn with those of his wife Lily, were placed in a niche of the columbarium at the Golders Green Crematorium in north London. The ceremony drew attendees from two continents and was broadcast by BBC Radio 4.

<doc id="827779" wikidata="Q3182553" url="?curid=827779" title="John Swan (Bermudian politician)">
<text>Sir John William David Swan (born 3 July 1935) is a former Bermudian politician. A real estate developer, Swan was Premier of Bermuda from 1982 to 1995.

Swan built his reputation through property development.

Elected to Parliament in 1972, the former Premier established the island as a major offshore financial center, and under Swan&#x27;s stewardship the Government completed in excess of 20 major projects.
In 1985 Swan led the negotiations and the completion of the Tax Treaty with the United States. The agreement resulted in the development of the insurance and reinsurance industries. The Bermuda delegation held several meetings with the most senior officials in the U.S. Government including the President, Vice-President, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of State and National Security Advisor in order to successfully implement a tax treaty between Bermuda and the United States. These initiatives created a foundation for the island&#x27;s stable economy, well-developed infrastructure and regulatory framework.
Swan favoured independence of Bermuda from Britain, however following a referendum in 1995 that overwhelmingly rejected the proposal, he resigned as Premier. Swan voted against the Stubbs Bill decriminalising homosexuality in Bermuda. The Bill passed however without Swan&#x27;s support.

In addition to serving as the Premier, Swan was the Minister of Immigration and Labour from 1976 to 1982, the Minister of Marine and Air Services from 1975 to 1976, and Chairman of Bermuda Hospitals Board. He was also a founding member of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, Director of the Bermuda Chamber of Commerce and a Director of the Bermuda Employers Council.
Swan transformed international trade, politics, and property development in Bermuda. In 1990 he was appointed by Her Majesty the Queen a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). In 1986 Swan was awarded the Medal of Distinction in recognition of his humanitarian endeavours from the International Association of Lions Clubs. Swan received the International Medal of Excellence from the Poor Richard Club of Philadelphia, the oldest press and advertising club in Philadelphia. He was admitted as a Senator to the Membership and Fellowship of the Senate of the Junior Chamber of Commerce. In 2002 Swan was awarded the St. Paul&#x27;s A.M.E. Outstanding Service Award.

A legislative bill was drafted to prevent Swan from establishing McDonald&#x27;s restaurants on Bermuda. Ann Cartwright DeCouto, Swan&#x27;s former Deputy Premier, introduced the Prohibited Restaurants Act to Parliament to stop the proposed McDonald&#x27;s. The House voted in favor of the ban in 1996, but the appointed Senate rejected the ban. Swan intended to challenge the legality of the law in Bermuda&#x27;s Supreme Court. Then-Premier David Saul, who approved Swan&#x27;s intentions in December 1995, resigned in March 1997 after a controversy over his decision and Swan&#x27;s plans.

Swan is chairman of the Swan Group of Companies. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from West Virginia Wesleyan College. In addition, he has been awarded a B.A. Honorary Fellowship at Bermuda College, honorary doctorates from West Virginia Wesleyan College, Atlantic Union College, and Morris Brown College.

<doc id="827781" wikidata="Q420473" url="?curid=827781" title="Allyl chloride">
<text>Allyl chloride is the organic compound with the formula CH2=CHCH2Cl. This colorless liquid is insoluble in water but soluble in common organic solvents. It is mainly converted to epichlorohydrin, used in the production of plastics. It is a chlorinated derivative of propylene. It is an alkylating agent, which makes it both useful and hazardous to handle.

==Production==
===Laboratory scale===
Allyl chloride was first produced in 1857 by Auguste Cahours and August Hofmann by reacting allyl alcohol with phosphorus trichloride. Modern preparation protocols economize this approach, replacing relatively expensive phosphorus trichloride with hydrochloric acid and a catalyst such as copper(I) chloride.

===Industrial scale===
Allyl chloride is produced by the chlorination of propylene. At lower temperatures, the main product is 1,2-dichloropropane, but at 500 °C, allyl chloride predominates, being formed via a free radical reaction:
:CH3CH=CH2 + Cl2 → ClCH2CH=CH2 + HCl
An estimated 800,000 tonnes were produced this way in 1997.

==Reactions and uses==
The great majority of allyl chloride is converted to epichlorohydrin. Other commercially significant derivatives include allyl alcohol, allylamine, allyl isothiocyanate (synthetic mustard oil), and 1-bromo-3-chloropropane.

As an alkylating agent, it is useful in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and pesticides, such as mustard oil.

===Illustrative reactions===
Illustrative of its reactivity is its cyanation to allyl cyanide (CH2=CHCH2CN). Being a reactive alkyl halide, it undergoes reductive coupling to give diallyl:
:2 ClCH2CH=CH2 + Mg → (CH2)2(CH=CH2)2 + MgCl2

It undergoes oxidative addition to palladium(0) to give allylpalladium chloride dimer, (C3H5)2Pd2Cl2. Dehydrohalogenation gives cyclopropene.

==Safety==
Allyl chloride is highly toxic and flammable. Eye effects may be delayed and may lead to possible impairment of vision.

<doc id="827782" wikidata="Q441528" url="?curid=827782" title="Lynn Swann">
<text>Lynn Curtis Swann (born March 7, 1952) is an American former professional football player, broadcaster, politician, and athletic director, best known for his association with the University of Southern California and the Pittsburgh Steelers. He served on the President&#x27;s Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition from 2002 to 2005. In 2006, he was the Republican nominee for Governor of Pennsylvania.

Swann was born in Alcoa, Tennessee. He attended USC and played football as a wide receiver of the USC Trojans, where he was a consensus All-American. He is regarded as one of the most popular and one of the greatest wide receivers of his generation. He was selected by the Steelers in the first round of the 1974 NFL draft. With the Steelers, Swann won four Super Bowls, was selected to three Pro Bowls, and was named MVP of Super Bowl X. Swann was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1993.

==Early life==
Swann was born March 7, 1952, in Alcoa, Tennessee, in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains near Knoxville.

The Swann family moved to San Mateo, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area when Lynn was 2. As a youth, Swann was raised in neighboring Foster City and attended Junípero Serra High School, where in addition to playing football, he was a track star, leaping in the long jump. At the 1970 CIF California State championship meet, Swann won the state title, defeating future Olympic gold medalist Randy Williams.

==College career==
Swann attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he was a consensus All-American on the Trojan football team under head coach John McKay, including the undefeated and national champion 1972 team. McKay said of Swann, &quot;He has speed, soft hands, and grace.&quot; He completed a Bachelor of Arts Degree in public relations in 1974.

In 1971, Swann had 27 catches for 305 yards and two touchdowns. He led USC in catches and finished second to WR Edesel Garrison in receiving yards. As a junior in 1972, Swann rushed for 117 yards and had 27 catches for 543 yards and three touchdowns. This time, he led USC in receiving yards and finished second to tight end Charle Young in catches. In 1973, Swann rushed for 99 yards while catching 42 passes for 714 yards and six touchdowns.

==Professional career==
Swann was selected in the first round of the 1974 NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 21st overall pick. The Steelers draft class of &#x27;74 is considered one of the best in NFL history and includes four Hall of Famers: Swann, Jack Lambert (RD2), John Stallworth (RD4), and Mike Webster (RD5). Undrafted 1974 free agent signee Donnie Shell is also a hall of famer.

Swann spent his entire NFL career with the Steelers and wore the jersey number 88. As a rookie in 1974, he led the NFL with 577 punt-return yards, a franchise record and the fourth-most in NFL history at the time. He was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team. He went on to win a championship ring with the Steelers in Super Bowl IX, but did not record any receptions in the tough defensive struggle (Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw completed only nine passes in the game). However, he returned three punts for 34 yards.
The following season became the highlight of Swann&#x27;s career. He caught 49 passes for 781 yards and a league-leading 11 touchdowns. In the AFC title game against the Oakland Raiders, George Atkinson knocked Swann out of the game with a very hard but legal hit. He suffered a severe concussion that forced him to spend two days in a hospital, but surprised many by returning to play for Super Bowl X. Swann recorded four catches for a Super Bowl-record 161 yards and a touchdown in the game, assisting the Steelers to a 21–17 win over the Dallas Cowboys and became the first wide receiver to earn Super Bowl MVP honors.
Three seasons later, in 1978, the Steelers made it to Super Bowl XIII. In the game, Swann caught seven passes for 124 yards and scored the final touchdown for Pittsburgh in their 35–31 win over Dallas.

The Steelers made it back to the Super Bowl again in the 1979 season, and Swann caught five passes for 79 yards and a touchdown at the Rose Bowl in Pittsburgh&#x27;s 31–19 win over the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV. Overall, Swann gained 364 receiving yards and 398 all-purpose yards in his four Super Bowls, which were both Super Bowl records at the time.

Swann retired after the 1982 season with four Super Bowl rings. In his nine-year career, he amassed 336 career receptions for 5,462 yards and 51 touchdowns, 72 rushing yards on 11 attempts and a touchdown, and 739 punt return yards and a touchdown. He was a Pro Bowl selection three times (1975, 1977, 1978), and was selected to the 1970s All-Decade Team.

Swann was unique among football players in that he credited his experiences in dance earlier in life with contributing to his aptitude on the football field. A 1981 interview which aired on &quot;Mr. Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; showed him on the field, and then in the Pittsburgh dance studio where he later underwrote scholarships.

Swann was named to the All-Pro team in 1975, 1977, and 1978, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in , a year before his teammate John Stallworth.

==After football==
Swann went on to serve as a director on the boards of H J Heinz Co., Hershey Entertainment and Resorts, and Wyndham International. He was a football and sports broadcaster for ABC Sports from 1976 to 2006, but left to run for Pennsylvania governor.

Swann briefly hosted the television game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, on which he had previously appeared as a panelist before replacing original host Gordon Elliott, on NBC from 1990 to 1991. His 14-week run as emcee ended, and he was replaced by Alex Trebek. He made guest appearances on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, where he explained his enthusiasm for ballet, and &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;.

During his time at ABC, Lynn Swann began his broadcasting career in 1976 while still active with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Upon retirement in January 1983, Swann began his career full-time with ABC Sports, which ended after the 2006 Sugar Bowl. Swann has broadcast a variety of events as a host, reporter, and analyst. Included in these events are:

* the 1976 Winter Olympics
* the 1976 Summer Olympics
* the 1980 Winter Olympics
* the 1984 Winter Olympics
* the 1984 Summer Olympics
* the 1988 Winter Olympics
* the Iditarod Trail sled dog race
* International Diving Championships
* USFL
* college football
* &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;
* the Kentucky Derby
* Preakness Stakes
* Belmont Stakes
* the Irish Derby
* &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot;
* Curt Gowdy&#x27;s &quot;The American Sportsman&quot;

Swann was the sideline reporter on CBS&#x27; &quot;Clash of Champions&quot; bowling telecast that aired on May 10–11, 2008. He teamed with color analyst Nelson Burton Jr. and play-by-play man Bill Macatee. The broadcast marked bowling&#x27;s return to network television for the first time since 1999 when CBS carried it.

In October 2009, Swann joined the Augusta National Golf Club. He is a dues-paying member of the home of the Masters golf tournament, which is held every April.

On August 19, 2010, the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; reported that Swann would be a part of the ownership team for Pittsburgh&#x27;s AFL expansion franchise, which began playing in the spring of 2011. Named the Pittsburgh Power, the team shared the Consol Energy Center with the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League. Swann has said that, despite his football experience, he does not interfere in the day-to-day coaching, although he would occasionally give some advice. The team folded in 2014.

Swann made an appearance, playing himself, in the role of a sideline reporter at the &quot;Bourbon Bowl&quot;, in the 1998 Adam Sandler comedy feature film &quot;The Waterboy&quot;. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame on December 30, 2013, at the Pasadena Convention Center.

On April 13, 2016, Swann was named as the athletic director of the University of Southern California, succeeding retiring Pat Haden. He assumed the position on July 1, 2016. On September 9, 2019, Swann resigned as the USC AD.

==Political career==

===Physical Fitness and Sports Council chairman===
On June 20, 2002, President George W. Bush appointed Swann as the chairman of the United States President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports during a Fitness Expo at the White House. Swann succeeded Lee Haney, who had been appointed to the post by President Clinton.

In 2003, President Bush and Chairman Lynn Swann launched presidentschallenge.org at the Lakewest Family YMCA in Dallas, Texas. Within the next year, 300,000 individuals registered on the website. Swann spoke at the National Press Club about the council&#x27;s programs to help Americans &quot;Be Physically Active Every Day,&quot; and introduced the Presidential Active Lifestyle Award.

In 2004, Swann and President Bush declared May as an annual &quot;National Physical Fitness and Sports&quot; month, and created the annual HealthierUS Fitness Festival. They also enacted the Healthier Feds Physical Activity Challenge initiative for federal employees. On July 30, 2005, Lynn Swann retired as council chairman to explore a campaign for governor. He was succeeded by John P. Burke.

===2006 candidacy for governor===
In December 2004, Swann, who resides in the Pittsburgh suburb of Sewickley Heights, Pennsylvania, indicated that he was considering seeking the Republican nomination for Governor of Pennsylvania in the 2006 election. On February 23, 2005, Swann filed papers with the state elections board stating his intention to run. On the same day, he formed a fundraising committee called Team 88 after his Steeler jersey number. On January 4, 2006, Swann formally declared his candidacy.

Swann&#x27;s opponents for the Republican primary had initially included Jim Panyard, State Senator Jeff Piccola and former Lieutenant Governor William Scranton, III. After Swann received the endorsement of the Republican state committee on February 11, all three opponents quit the race, leaving Swann as the only Republican to have filed by the deadline of March 7. Swann chose Montgomery County Commissioner Jim Matthews as his running mate.

Polls in early February showed Swann and Ed Rendell in a statistical tie, though Rendell had the advantage of being the popular incumbent. Swann&#x27;s campaign focused on reforming Harrisburg by addressing mass transit, property tax, law enforcement, the environment and the growing concern of obesity. He also supported giving the Pittsburgh Penguins Pittsburgh&#x27;s lone slots license so they could build a new arena, free of taxpayer money.

Swann&#x27;s momentum did not survive a barrage of advertising from Rendell in early spring, and had trouble keeping up with Rendell&#x27;s effective fundraising. In the end, Swann lost the election with 40% of the vote to Rendell&#x27;s 60%. Had Swann won, he would have been the first African American Governor of Pennsylvania and only the third African American elected governor of a state in U.S. history. Of the three Republican African American gubernatorial candidates in 2006, all three of them lost; Kenneth Blackwell lost in Ohio, and Randy Daniels lost in New York.

===2008 to present===

In 2008, Swann confirmed that he was considering running for the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 4th congressional district against Rep. Jason Altmire. However, Swann did not file for the election and former congresswoman Melissa Hart won the Republican nomination unopposed and then lost to Altmire in the 2008 general election.

In the 2008 presidential election, Swann endorsed and campaigned with Arizona Senator John McCain for the presidency, though Swann had remained neutral through the primaries. In 2012, he did the same for former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, once Romney had become the presumptive Republican nominee.

In 2015, before the primary elections, Swann announced his support of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, while also criticizing Donald Trump.

==Personal life==
On June 10, 1979, during the summer after winning Super Bowl XIII, Swann married Bernadette Robi, the daughter of singer Paul Robi of The Platters. The pair divorced in 1983.

On June 23, 1991, Swann married Charena (née Shaffer), a psychologist, and they have two sons who played football collegiately.

<text>Claude Augustus Swanson (March 31, 1862July 7, 1939) was an American lawyer and Democratic politician from Virginia. He served as U.S. Representative (1893–1906), Governor of Virginia (1906–1910), and U.S. Senator from Virginia (1910–1933), before becoming U.S. Secretary of the Navy under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 until his death. Swanson and fellow U.S. Senator Thomas Staples Martin led a Democratic political machine in Virginia for decades in the late 19th and early 20th century, which later became known as the Byrd Organization for Swanson&#x27;s successor as U.S. Senator, Harry Flood Byrd.

==Early and family life==
Claude Swanson was born to the former Catherine Rebecca Pritchett (1834–1873) and her husband John Muse Swanson (1829–1914) in Swansonville, Pittsylvania County, Virginia, on March 31, 1862. His great-grandfather William Swanson had moved to Pittsylvania from Albemarle County, Virginia, had farmed a plantation using slave labor, represented Pittsylvania County in the Virginia General Assembly, and advocating for building a railroad between Richmond and Danville. John M. Swanson, who owned slaves in 1850 and 1860, served in the 5th Virginia Cavalry and 21st Virginia Infantry during the American Civil War. After the war, he worked with his brother as merchants and tobacco manufacturers, J.M. Swanson &amp; Bro. in Swansonville. John and Catherine Swanson had three other sons who survived to adulthood, as well as three daughters: William Graves Swanson (1860–1934), John Pritchett Swanson and Henry Clay Swanson (1870–1952) and sisters Annie Blanche Swanson (1864–1948), Sallie Hill Swanson (1869–1950) and Julia Benson Swanson (1869–1933). Two siblings did not survive to adulthood.

Claude Swanson married Elizabeth Deane Lyons on December 11, 1894, in the District of Columbia. She died on July 13, 1920. He married her widowed sister Lulie Lyons Hall (1867–1953) three years later, and she survived him. Swanson had met them both while studying at Randolph Macon Academy, for their mother ran a boardinghouse to support her family.

==Career==
Most Swanson men were Democrats and merchants in southwestern Virginia after the American Civil War. Commerce was the family business. A Swedish ancestor had moved from Philadelphia to southwestern Virginia in the 17th century to farm, as well as trade tobacco (and supply farmers with goods they needed). His grandfather had appeared as a &quot;Tobacconist&quot; in the 1850 U.S.Census, and the same label was used for his father in the 1860 census. His brother William G. Swanson later ran the wholesale Swanson Brothers Company, and served as chief clerk at the White Rock Indian Reservation in Utah during the administration of Democratic President Grover Cleveland. John Pritchett Swanson operated the Swanson Supply Company, a wholesale grocery and farmers supply business, and the family also had interests in the South Atlantic Lumber Company and Clement Lumber Company in Greensboro, North Carolina.

===Merchant to teacher to lawyer===
Swanson studied under Celestia Parrish then worked for his father in the family business, and taught as a schoolteacher himself for two years (for $30/month when he was 15 and 16 years old) when the bright tobacco market collapsed in 1876.

When Virginia&#x27;s fiscal crisis meant teachers were not paid, and having earned enough to fund his further studies, Swanson entered the new state agricultural college in Blacksburg, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (or Virginia Tech). Another family financial crisis led him and his brother to work in Danville as clerks in John Carter&#x27;s grocery.

Four Danville Methodists lent Swanson funds to attend Randolph Macon College in Ashland. He graduated in 1885 after winning oratorical prizes and editing the college newspaper as well as the &quot;Hanover and Caroline News.&quot; He then went to Charlottesville and received a law degree from the University of Virginia.

After admission to the Virginia Bar, Swanson set up a legal practice in Chatham, the Pittsylvania county seat.

===Congressman and Virginia politician===
The young orator Claude Swanson had drawn the attention of Democratic party politicians in Richmond when he was studying in Ashland just up the railroad line. He won his first public office in 1892, a seat in the U.S. Congress representing Virginia&#x27;s 5th congressional district. Swanson would serve seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1893 until 1906. The district extended from Pittsylvania and Franklin counties into the Republican-leaning mountain counties of Floyd, Carroll and Grayson. Swanson survived two close election contests.

During the 1893 depression, Swanson became Virginia&#x27;s most outspoken congressman endorsing William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s inflationary fiscal reforms, i.e. allowing both silver and gold as legal tender. By 1896, Swanson had allied himself with Henry D. Flood, James Hay, Francis Lassiter and Thomas Staples Martin (whom he helped elect to the Senate in 1893).

Although his family&#x27;s mercantile background had shown Swanson the importance of credit, his views (and those of his allies) outraged the conservative creditor class. Railroad developer Joseph F. Bryan, who owned the &quot;Richmond Times&quot; analogized Swanson to communists, anarchists and repudiators of debt.&quot; Congressman Swanson also endorsed free rural mail delivery, aid to rural banks, graduated federal income taxes (that became the 16th Amendment), reduced federal excise taxes and direct election of U.S. Senators (that became the 17th Amendment). He rose to influence on the House Ways and Means Committee and as proto-party whip. When the Spanish–American War in 1898 stimulated demand for farm products, the family farms again prospered and his brothers opened a wholesale grocery in Danville.

In 1903 Swanson bought Eldon, a plantation in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, built by the Whittle family for whom Chatham&#x27;s Whittle Street is named. He lived there (when not in Washington, D.C.) most of the rest of his life. Swanson also entered into various real estate consortiums with Flood and his nephew, Harry F. Byrd.

===Governor===
Swanson&#x27;s attempt to become Governor of Virginia in 1901 failed. However, after the Virginia Constitution of 1902 disenfranchised many African American and poor white voters, he won the Democratic primary in 1905. In the general election he defeated Republican Lunsford L. Lewis of Rockingham County by a nearly 2 to 1 margin.

Claude Swanson became the 45th Governor of Virginia, serving from 1906 until 1910. He was known as a progressive: A Board of Charities and Corrections and new board of heath were set up, while hospitals and sanitariums were built for mute, deaf and blind Virginians, along with epileptics and tuberculosis victims. Also, as noted by one study, “Requiring that federal sanitary standards be followed, Swanson ordered Saunders to indict reluctant bakery owners who failed to meet them.” In addition, a number of labor laws were introduced. However, this was also an era of increased racial polarization in Virginia, and under Swanson and his lieutenant governor James Taylor Ellyson, African American schools received far fewer funds, and the state&#x27;s eugenics program would flower in the 1920s.

===U.S. Senator===
Senator John W. Daniel died in office in June 1910. In August 1910, his successor as governor William Hodges Mann appointed Swanson to fill the vacancy until the end of Daniel&#x27;s term on March 3, 1911. In February 1911, Governor Mann appointed Swanson to the term Daniel for which Daniel had been reelected before his death, which began on March 4, 1911. Swanson won a non-binding primary for the seat in September 1911, and in January 1912, the Virginia General Assembly ratified the primary results by electing Swanson to the remainder of the term, which ended on March 3, 1917.

Swanson continued to win reelection, and represented Virginia in the U.S. Senate from 1910 until 1933. Fellow Progressive Virginian Woodrow Wilson won the 1912 Presidential election, so Swanson supported successful reforms in child labor and banking laws, reduced tariffs and federal funding of highway construction. He and Virginia&#x27;s other Senator Thomas Staples Martin also supported expansion of the Norfolk Naval Base and the League of Nations. Swanson publicly opposed women&#x27;s suffrage and what became the 19th Amendment, although he advised President Wilson privately concerning its passage.

During the Republican administrations of the 1920s, Swanson&#x27;s gained seniority in the Senate, and served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Swanson continued to advocate for the U.S. Navy, particularly as Japanese aggression in the Pacific threatened American commercial interests. He argued for a &quot;treaty navy&quot;. His familiarity with the 1922 Washington agreements and those of the London Treaty (1930) led President Herbert Hoover (though of the opposing political party) to appoint Swanson as an American delegate to the unsuccessful Geneva Disarmament Conference of 1932. Swanson had been the first prominent Virginia politician to oppose anti-Prohibition Roman Catholic 1928 Democratic nominee Al Smith, and Hoover would become the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Virginia since Reconstruction.

When the Great Depression hit and voters elected Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt President, Swanson became Secretary of the Navy, serving from 1933 until his death in 1939. Harry F. Byrd, who had succeeded to leadership of Martin&#x27;s political organization after Martin&#x27;s death, succeeded Swanson in the Senate, but became a leading critic of the New Deal. As Naval Secretary, Swanson oversaw passage and implementation of the largest U.S. peacetime naval appropriations up to that time.

==Death and legacy==
Ill for several months, Swanson died at Herbert Hoover&#x27;s Rapidan Camp (which was then available for use by the Roosevelt Administration) in Criglersville, Madison County, Virginia, on July 7, 1939. The 77 year old had also visited Shenandoah National Park and reviewed work performed by the Civilian Conservation Corps. His funeral was held in the chamber of the U.S. Senate. Then his corpse was taken to Richmond and buried in Hollywood Cemetery.

The Library of Virginia holds his executive papers. In 1992, Virginia erected a highway marker near Eldon to commemorate his service.

Arlington, Virginia, named Swanson Middle School in his honor. The U.S. Navy also named a destroyer for him.

Short-lived Swanson County, Oklahoma, was also named for him, while he was still alive.

<doc id="827791" wikidata="Q1534874" url="?curid=827791" title="Caster">
<text>A caster (or castor) is an undriven wheel that is designed to be attached to the bottom of a larger object (the &quot;vehicle&quot;) to enable that object to be moved.

Casters are used in numerous applications, including shopping carts, office chairs, toy wagons, hospital beds, and material handling equipment. High capacity, heavy duty casters are used in many industrial applications, such as platform trucks, carts, assemblies, and tow lines in plants.

==Types==

Casters may be fixed to roll along a straight line path, or mounted on a or pintle such that the wheel will automatically align itself to the direction of travel.

===Rigid casters===
A basic, rigid caster consists of a wheel mounted to a stationary fork. The orientation of the fork, which is fixed relative to the vehicle, is determined when the caster is mounted to the vehicle. An example of this is the wheels found at the rear of a shopping cart in North America. Rigid casters tend to restrict vehicle motion so that the vehicle travels along a straight line.

===Swivel casters===

Like the simpler rigid caster, a swivel caster incorporates a wheel mounted to a fork, but an additional swivel joint above the fork allows the fork to freely rotate about 360°, thus enabling the wheel to roll in any direction. This makes it possible to easily move the vehicle in any direction without changing its orientation. Swivel casters are sometimes attached to handles so that an operator can manually set their orientation. The improved swivel caster was invented in 1920 by Seibert Chesnutt, US Patent 1341630, which was easily manufactured by stamping, and incorporated ball bearings for longer life. Basic swivel casters were in evidence in Charles Darwin&#x27;s famous &quot;office chair&quot; as early as the 1840s.

Additionally, a swivel caster typically must include a small amount of offset distance between the center axis of the vertical shaft and the center axis of the caster wheel. When the caster is moved and the wheel is not facing the correct direction, the offset will cause the wheel assembly to rotate around the axis of the vertical shaft to follow behind the direction of movement. If there is no offset, the wheel will not rotate if not facing the correct direction, either preventing motion or dragging across the ground.

When in motion along a straight line, a swivel caster will tend to automatically align to, and rotate parallel to the direction of travel. This can be seen on a shopping cart when the front casters align parallel to the rear casters when traveling down an aisle. A consequence of this is that the vehicle naturally tends to travel in a straight direction. Precise steering is not required because the casters tend to maintain straight motion. This is also true during vehicle turns. The caster rotates perpendicular to the turning radius and provides a smooth turn. This can be seen on a shopping cart as the front wheels rotate at different velocities, with different turning radius depending on how tight a turn is made.

The angle of, and distance between the wheel axles and swivel joint can be adjusted for different types of caster performance.

===Industrial casters===

Industrial casters are heavy duty casters that are designed to carry heavy loads, in some cases up to thirty thousand pounds. An Industrial caster may have either a swivel or rigid caster design. Industrial casters typically have a flat top plate that has four bolt holes to ensure a sturdy connection between the top plate and the load. They are used in a variety of applications including dolly carts, assembly turntables, heavy duty storage racks, holding bins, tow lines, maintenance equipment, and material handling mechanisms.

In early manufacturing, industrial caster bodies were typically fabricated from three separate, stamped metal parts, which were welded to the top plate. Today, many industrial caster bodies are made by laser cutting the body from a single metal blank and then using a press brake to shape the legs to the required ninety degree angle, thus producing a mechanically stronger device.

Various factors affect industrial caster performance. For example, larger wheel diameters and widths provide higher weight capacity by distributing the load&#x27;s weight across a larger wheel surface area. Also, harder wheel materials (e.g., cast iron, high profile polyurethane) are less sensitive to and tend to not track dirt and debris on floors.

=== Braking and locking casters ===

Common inexpensive casters may include a brake feature, which prevents the wheel from turning. This is commonly achieved using a lever that presses a brake cam against the wheel. However a swivel caster is still able to move around slightly, in a small circle rotating around offset distance between the vertical shaft and the center of the locked wheel.

A more complex type of swivel caster, sometimes called a total lock caster, has an additional rotational lock on the vertical shaft so that neither shaft swiveling nor wheel rotation can occur, thus providing very rigid support. It is possible to use these two locks together or separately. If the vertical shaft is locked but the wheel can still turn, the caster becomes a directional caster, but one which may be locked to roll in one direction along any horizontal axis.

In some cases it is useful to be able to brake or lock all casters at the same time, without having to walk around to individually engage a mechanism on each one. This may be accomplished using a central lock mechanism engaged by a rigid ring encircling each swivel caster, slightly above the wheel, that lowers and presses down on the wheel, preventing both wheel and swivel rotation. An alternative method is the central lock caster, which has a rotating cam in the center of each vertical caster shaft, leading down to a braking mechanism in the bottom of each caster.

=== Kingpinless casters ===

A Kingpinless caster has an inner raceway, an outer raceway which is attached to the vehicle, and ball bearings between the raceways. This mechanism has no kingpin, hence the name kingpinless. The absence of a kingpin eliminates most causes of swivel caster failure and reduces or eliminates shimmy . They offer capacity and durability comparable to units having sealed precision ball or tapered bearings, and are a practical alternative to traditional swivel casters in high-impact situations.

== Caster flutter ==
One major disadvantage of casters is flutter. A common example of caster flutter is on a supermarket shopping cart, when one caster rapidly swings side-to-side. This oscillation, which is also known as &quot;shimmy&quot;, occurs naturally at certain speeds, and is similar to speed wobble that occurs in other wheeled vehicles. The speed at which caster flutter occurs is based on the weight borne by the caster and the distance between the wheel axle and steering axis. This distance is known as trailing distance, and increasing this distance can eliminate flutter at moderate speeds. Generally, flutter occurs at high speeds.

What makes flutter dangerous is that it can cause a vehicle to suddenly move in an unwanted direction. Flutter occurs when the caster is not in full contact with the ground and therefore its orientation is uncontrollable. As the caster regains full contact with the ground, it can be in any orientation. This can cause the vehicle to suddenly move in the direction that the caster is pointed. At slower speeds, the caster’s ability to swivel can correct the direction and can continue travel in the desired direction. But at high speeds this can be dangerous as the wheel may not be able to swivel quickly enough and the vehicle may lurch in any direction.

Electric and racing wheelchair designers are very concerned with flutter because the chair must be safe for riders. Increasing trailing distance can increase stability at higher speeds for wheelchair racing, but may create flutter at lower speeds for everyday use. Unfortunately, the more trail the caster has, the more space the caster requires to swivel. Therefore, in order to accommodate this extra swivel space, lengthening of frame or extending the footrests may be required. This tends to make the chair more cumbersome.

Caster flutter can be controlled by adding dampers or increasing the friction of the swivel joints. This can be accomplished by adding washers to the swivel joint. The friction increases as the weight on the front of the chair increases. Anytime the caster begins to flutter, it slows the chair and shifts weight to the front wheels. There are several online anti-flutter kits for retrofitting wheelchair casters in this manner. Other methods of reducing caster flutter include increasing swivel lead, using heavier grease, reducing the mass of the wheel, or increasing friction with the ground by changing materials.

Casters are also stopped completely using caster cups.

==Ergonomic designs==
Ergonomic casters are designed with consideration for the operating environment and the task to be performed so that any injurious effects on the operator are minimized. Long-term repetitive actions involving resisting casters can contribute to strain injuries. Improper specifications can also contribute to reduced service life of casters.

Many parameters play a role in how well the caster performs. Parameters such as tire hardness, tread width and shape, the length of the trailing offset (the &#x27;caster&#x27;) and wheel diameter all affect the effort required to start the platform moving. Harder wheels will make the caster easier to roll by reducing deformation resistance. A less inflated tire offers more deformation resistance and thus more effort is required to move the attached platform. Turning effort is affected by the amount of caster and by the wheel diameter.

Enhancements to traditional caster design include toe guards, track wipers, reinforced legs, steering tubes, swivel locks and brakes, all implemented in an effort to reduce operator injuries in the workplace.

== Wheel diameter, wheel width, and tandem wheels ==
The diameter of a caster wheel affects how easily the caster moves over particulate, rough or irregular surfaces. Large diameter caster wheels are able to bridge gaps like that between the floor and an elevator car.
However, the larger the diameter of a caster wheel, the higher the caster support arm must be. Either the base of a low-hanging object must be lifted higher above the wheels, or the casters must hang out to the sides straddling the low-hanging supported object. While rotating around the vertical shaft, swivel caster wheels sweep out a space. Larger wheels require more of this space.

Load capacity may be increased by using wider wheels with more ground contact area. However, when rotating a wide swivel caster in-place, the center part of the wheel-to-ground contact patch rotates slower than the regions further out to the sides. This difference in rotation speed across the base of the wheel contact patch causes wide wheels to resist rotation around the swivel, and this resistance increases as weight loading increases.

An alternative way to increase load capacity while limiting swivel-rotation resistance is to use multiple narrow wheels in tandem on the same wheel axis. Each wheel has a comparatively narrower ground contact patch than a single wide wheel, so there is less resistance to turning in place on the swivel.

== Other related wheels ==
There are four main classifications of wheels:
* A standard wheel has a center rotating hub (or bearing) and a compliant material on its outer side.
* A caster is a wheel mounted to a fork, with an optional, additional offset steering joint.
* An omnidirectional wheel (Mecanum wheel, Omni wheel, or Swedish wheel) is made of a large central hub with many additional smaller wheels mounted along the perimeter such that their axes are perpendicular to the central wheel. The central wheel can rotate around its axis like traditional wheels, but the smaller wheels can also enable movement perpendicular to the central axis.
* A spherical wheel is omnidirectional and is generally a spherical ball mounted inside a restraining fixture. An example is a ball transfer unit.

<doc id="827792" wikidata="Q865447" url="?curid=827792" title="Rare Earth hypothesis">
<text>In planetary astronomy and astrobiology, the Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the origin of life and the evolution of biological complexity, such as sexually reproducing, multicellular organisms on Earth, and subsequently human intelligence, required an improbable combination of astrophysical and geological events and circumstances. According to the hypothesis, complex extraterrestrial life is an improbable phenomenon and likely to be rare throughout the universe as a whole. The term &quot;Rare Earth&quot; originates from &quot;Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe&quot; (2000), a book by Peter Ward, a geologist and paleontologist, and Donald E. Brownlee, an astronomer and astrobiologist, both faculty members at the University of Washington.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, among others, argued that Earth is a typical rocky planet in a typical planetary system, located in a non-exceptional region of a common barred spiral galaxy. From the principle of mediocrity (extended from the Copernican principle), they argued that the evolution of life on Earth, including human beings, was also typical, and therefore that the universe teems with complex life. Ward and Brownlee argue that planets, planetary systems, and galactic regions that are as accommodating for complex life as are the Earth, the Solar System, and our own galactic region are not typical at all but actually exceedingly rare.

==Fermi paradox==

There is no reliable or reproducible evidence that extraterrestrial organisms of any kind have visited Earth. No transmissions or evidence of intelligent life have been detected or observed anywhere other than Earth in the Universe. This runs counter to the knowledge that the Universe is filled with a very large number of planets, some of which likely hold the conditions hospitable for life. Life typically expands until it fills all available niches. These contradictory facts form the basis for the Fermi paradox, of which the Rare Earth hypothesis is one proposed solution.

==Requirements for complex life==

The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the evolution of biological complexity anywhere in the universe requires the coincidence of a large number of fortuitous circumstances, including, among others, a galactic habitable zone; a central star and planetary system having the requisite character (i.e. a circumstellar habitable zone); a terrestrial planet of the right mass; the advantage of one or more gas giant guardians like Jupiter and possibly a large natural satellite to shield the planet from frequent impact events; conditions needed to ensure the planet has a magnetosphere and plate tectonics; a chemistry similar to that present in the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere, atmosphere, and oceans; the influence of periodic &quot;evolutionary pumps&quot; such as massive glaciations and bolide impacts; and whatever factors may have led to the emergence of eukaryotic cells, sexual reproduction, and the Cambrian explosion of animal, plant, and fungi phyla. The evolution of human beings and of human intelligence may have required yet further specific events and circumstances, all of which are extremely unlikely to have happened were it not for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago removing dinosaurs as the dominant terrestrial vertebrates.

In order for a small rocky planet to support complex life, Ward and Brownlee argue, the values of several variables must fall within narrow ranges. The universe is so vast that it might still contain many Earth-like planets, but if such planets exist, they are likely to be separated from each other by many thousands of light-years. Such distances may preclude communication among any intelligent species that may evolve on such planets, which would solve the Fermi paradox which wonders: if extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren&#x27;t they obvious?

===The right location in the right kind of galaxy===
Rare Earth suggests that much of the known universe, including large parts of our galaxy, are &quot;dead zones&quot; unable to support complex life. Those parts of a galaxy where complex life is possible make up the galactic habitable zone, which is primarily characterized by distance from the Galactic Center.
# As that distance increases, star metallicity declines. Metals (which in astronomy refers to all elements other than hydrogen and helium) are necessary for the formation of terrestrial planets.
# The X-ray and gamma ray radiation from the black hole at the galactic center, and from nearby neutron stars, becomes less intense as distance increases. Thus the early universe, and present-day galactic regions where stellar density is high and supernovae are common, will be dead zones.
# Gravitational perturbation of planets and planetesimals by nearby stars becomes less likely as the density of stars decreases. Hence the further a planet lies from the Galactic Center or a spiral arm, the less likely it is to be struck by a large bolide which could extinguish all complex life on a planet.
Item #1 rules out the outermost reaches of a galaxy; #2 and #3 rule out galactic inner regions. Hence a galaxy&#x27;s habitable zone may be a relatively narrow ring of adequate conditions sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches.

Also, a habitable planetary system must maintain its favorable location long enough for complex life to evolve. A star with an eccentric (elliptical or hyperbolic) galactic orbit will pass through some spiral arms, unfavorable regions of high star density; thus a life-bearing star must have a galactic orbit that is nearly circular, with a close synchronization between the orbital velocity of the star and of the spiral arms. This further restricts the galactic habitable zone within a fairly narrow range of distances from the Galactic Center. Lineweaver et al. calculate this zone to be a ring 7 to 9 kiloparsecs in radius, including no more than 10% of the stars in the Milky Way, about 20 to 40 billion stars. Gonzalez &quot;et al.&quot; would halve these numbers; they estimate that at most 5% of stars in the Milky Way fall within the galactic habitable zone.

Approximately 77% of observed galaxies are spiral, two-thirds of all spiral galaxies are barred, and more than half, like the Milky Way, exhibit multiple arms. According to Rare Earth, our own galaxy is unusually quiet and dim (see below), representing just 7% of its kind. Even so, this would still represent more than 200 billion galaxies in the known universe.

Our galaxy also appears unusually favorable in suffering fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, which can cause more supernovae and other disturbances. Also, the Milky Way&#x27;s central black hole seems to have neither too much nor too little activity.

The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with a period of 226 Ma (million years), closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in gravitationally aligned orbits, so there is little that is unusual about the Sun&#x27;s orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years. Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do indeed correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.

===The right orbital distance from the right type of star===

The terrestrial example suggests that complex life requires liquid water, the maintenance of which requires an orbital distance neither too close nor too far from the central star, another scale of habitable zone or Goldilocks principle. 
The habitable zone varies with the star&#x27;s type and age.

For advanced life, the star must also be highly stable, which is typical of middle star life, about 4.6 billion years old. Proper metallicity and size are also important to stability. The Sun has a low (0.1%) luminosity variation. To date, no solar twin star, with an exact match of the Sun&#x27;s luminosity variation, has been found, though some come close. The star must also have no stellar companions, as in binary systems, which would disrupt the orbits of any planets. Estimates suggest 50% or more of all star systems are binary. Stars gradually brighten over time and it takes hundreds of millions or billions of years for animal life to evolve. The requirement for a planet to remain in the habitable zone even as its boundaries move outwards over time restricts the size of what Ward and Brownlee call the &quot;continuously habitable zone&quot; for animals. They cite a calculation that it is very narrow, within 0.95 and 1.15 astronomical units (one AU is the distance between the Earth and the Sun), and argue that even this may be too large because it is based on the whole zone within which liquid water can exist, and water near boiling point may be much too hot for animal life.

The liquid water and other gases available in the habitable zone bring the benefit of the greenhouse effect. Even though the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere contains a water vapor concentration from 0% (in arid regions) to 4% (in rainforest and ocean regions) and – as of November 2022 – only 417.2 parts per million of , these small amounts suffice to raise the average surface temperature by about 40 °C, with the dominant contribution being due to water vapor.

Rocky planets must orbit within the habitable zone for life to form. Although the habitable zone of such hot stars as Sirius or Vega is wide, hot stars also emit much more ultraviolet radiation that ionizes any planetary atmosphere. Such stars may also become red giants before advanced life evolves on their planets. These considerations rule out the massive and powerful stars of type F6 to O (see stellar classification) as homes to evolved metazoan life.

Conversely, small red dwarf stars have small habitable zones wherein planets are in tidal lock, with one very hot side always facing the star and another very cold side always facing away, and they are also at increased risk of solar flares (see Aurelia). As such, it is disputed whether they can support life. Rare Earth proponents claim that only stars from F7 to K1 types are hospitable. Such stars are rare: G type stars such as the Sun (between the hotter F and cooler K) comprise only 9% of the hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way.

Such aged stars as red giants and white dwarfs are also unlikely to support life. Red giants are common in globular clusters and elliptical galaxies. White dwarfs are mostly dying stars that have already completed their red giant phase. Stars that become red giants expand into or overheat the habitable zones of their youth and middle age (though theoretically planets at much greater distances may then become habitable).

An energy output that varies with the lifetime of the star will likely prevent life (e.g., as Cepheid variables). A sudden decrease, even if brief, may freeze the water of orbiting planets, and a significant increase may evaporate it and cause a greenhouse effect that prevents the oceans from reforming.

All known life requires the complex chemistry of metallic elements. The absorption spectrum of a star reveals the presence of metals within, and studies of stellar spectra reveal that many, perhaps most, stars are poor in metals. Because heavy metals originate in supernova explosions, metallicity increases in the universe over time. Low metallicity characterizes the early universe: globular clusters and other stars that formed when the universe was young, stars in most galaxies other than large spirals, and stars in the outer regions of all galaxies. Metal-rich central stars capable of supporting complex life are therefore believed to be most common in the less dense regions of the larger spiral galaxies—where radiation also happens to be weak.

===The right arrangement of planets around the star===

Rare Earth proponents argue that a planetary system capable of sustaining complex life must be structured more or less like the Solar System, with small, rocky inner planets and massive outer gas giants. Without the protection of such &quot;celestial vacuum cleaner&quot; planets, such as Jupiter, with strong gravitational pulls, other planets would be subject to more frequent catastrophic asteroid collisions. An asteroid only twice the size of the one which cause the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction might have wiped out all complex life.

Observations of exoplanets have shown that arrangements of planets similar to the Solar System are rare. Most planetary systems have super-Earths, several times larger than Earth, close to their star, whereas the Solar System&#x27;s inner region has only a few small rocky planets and none inside Mercury&#x27;s orbit. Only 10% of stars have giant planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn, and those few rarely have stable, nearly circular orbits distant from their star. Konstantin Batygin and colleagues argue that these features can be explained if, early in the history of the Solar System, Jupiter and Saturn drifted towards the Sun, sending showers of planetesimals towards the super-Earths which sent them spiralling into the Sun, and ferrying icy building blocks into the terrestrial region of the Solar System which provided the building blocks for the rocky planets. The two giant planets then drifted out again to their present positions. In the view of Batygin and his colleagues: &quot;The concatenation of chance events required for this delicate choreography suggest that small, Earth-like rocky planets – and perhaps life itself – could be rare throughout the cosmos.&quot;

===A continuously stable orbit===
Rare Earth proponents argue that a gas giant also must not be too close to a body where life is developing. Close placement of one or more gas giants could disrupt the orbit of a potential life-bearing planet, either directly or by drifting into the habitable zone.

Newtonian dynamics can produce chaotic planetary orbits, especially in a system having large planets at high orbital eccentricity.

The need for stable orbits rules out stars with planetary systems that contain large planets with orbits close to the host star (called &quot;hot Jupiters&quot;). It is believed that hot Jupiters have migrated inwards to their current orbits. In the process, they would have catastrophically disrupted the orbits of any planets in the habitable zone. To exacerbate matters, hot Jupiters are much more common orbiting F and G class stars.

===A terrestrial planet of the right size===

The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that life requires terrestrial planets like Earth, and since gas giants lack such a surface, that complex life cannot arise there.

A planet that is too small cannot maintain much atmosphere, rendering its surface temperature low and variable and oceans impossible. A small planet will also tend to have a rough surface, with large mountains and deep canyons. The core will cool faster, and plate tectonics may be brief or entirely absent. A planet that is too large will retain too dense an atmosphere, like Venus. Although Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, its surface atmospheric pressure is 92 times that of Earth, and its surface temperature is 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F). The early Earth once had a similar atmosphere, but may have lost it in the giant impact event which formed the Moon.

===Plate tectonics===
Rare Earth proponents argue that plate tectonics and a strong magnetic field are essential for biodiversity, global temperature regulation, and the carbon cycle. The lack of mountain chains elsewhere in the Solar System is evidence that Earth is the only body which now has plate tectonics, and thus the only one capable of supporting life.

Plate tectonics depend on the right chemical composition and a long-lasting source of heat from radioactive decay. Continents must be made of less dense felsic rocks that &quot;float&quot; on underlying denser mafic rock. Taylor emphasizes that tectonic subduction zones require the lubrication of oceans of water. Plate tectonics also provide a means of biochemical cycling.

Plate tectonics and, as a result, continental drift and the creation of separate landmasses would create diversified ecosystems and biodiversity, one of the strongest defenses against extinction. An example of species diversification and later competition on Earth&#x27;s continents is the Great American Interchange. North and Middle America drifted into South America at around 3.5 to 3 Ma. The fauna of South America had already evolved separately for about 30 million years, since Antarctica separated, but, after the merger, many species were wiped out, mainly in South America, by competing North American animals.

===A large moon===

The Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites (Mercury and Venus), or only relatively tiny satellites which are probably captured asteroids (Mars). After Charon, the Moon is also the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its parent body, being 27% the size of Earth.

The giant-impact theory hypothesizes that the Moon resulted from the impact of a roughly Mars-sized body, dubbed Theia, with the young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its axial tilt (inclination) and velocity of rotation. Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes photosynthesis viable. The &quot;Rare Earth&quot; hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative to the orbital plane). A planet with a large tilt will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides. In this view, the Earth&#x27;s tilt is &quot;just right&quot;. The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet&#x27;s tilt; without this effect, the variation in tilt would be chaotic, probably making complex life forms on land impossible.

If the Earth had no Moon, the ocean tides resulting solely from the Sun&#x27;s gravity would be only half that of the lunar tides. A large satellite gives rise to tidal pools, which may be essential for the formation of complex life, though this is far from certain.

A large satellite also increases the likelihood of plate tectonics through the effect of tidal forces on the planet&#x27;s crust. The impact that formed the Moon may also have initiated plate tectonics, without which the continental crust would cover the entire planet, leaving no room for oceanic crust. It is possible that the large-scale mantle convection needed to drive plate tectonics could not have emerged if the crust had a uniform composition. A further theory indicates that such a large moon may also contribute to maintaining a planet&#x27;s magnetic shield by continually acting upon a metallic planetary core as dynamo, thus protecting the surface of the planet from charged particles and cosmic rays, and helping to ensure the atmosphere is not stripped over time by solar winds.

===An atmosphere===

A terrestrial planet must be the right size, like Earth and Venus, in order to retain an atmosphere. On Earth, once the giant impact of Theia thinned Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, other events were needed to make the atmosphere capable of sustaining life. The Late Heavy Bombardment reseeded Earth with water lost after the impact of Theia. The development of an ozone layer generated a protective shield against ultraviolet (UV) sunlight. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide are needed in a correct ratio for life to form. Lightning is needed for nitrogen fixation. The gaseous carbon dioxide needed for life comes from sources such as volcanoes and geysers. Carbon dioxide is preferably needed at relatively low levels (currently at approximately 400 ppm on Earth) because at high levels it is poisonous. Precipitation is needed to have a stable water cycle. A proper atmosphere must reduce diurnal temperature variation.

===One or more evolutionary triggers for complex life===

Regardless of whether planets with similar physical attributes to the Earth are rare or not, some argue that life tends not to evolve into anything more complex than simple bacteria without being provoked by rare and specific circumstances. Biochemist Nick Lane argues that simple cells (prokaryotes) emerged soon after Earth&#x27;s formation, but since almost half the planet&#x27;s life had passed before they evolved into complex ones (eukaryotes), all of whom share a common ancestor, this event can only have happened once. According to some views, prokaryotes lack the cellular architecture to evolve into eukaryotes because a bacterium expanded up to eukaryotic proportions would have tens of thousands of times less energy available to power its metabolism. Two billion years ago, one simple cell incorporated itself into another, multiplied, and evolved into mitochondria that supplied the vast increase in available energy that enabled the evolution of complex eukaryotic life. If this incorporation occurred only once in four billion years or is otherwise unlikely, then life on most planets remains simple. An alternative view is that the evolution of mitochondria was environmentally triggered, and that mitochondria-containing organisms appeared soon after the first traces of atmospheric oxygen.

The evolution and persistence of sexual reproduction is another mystery in biology. The purpose of sexual reproduction is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (fitness disadvantage) in relation to asexual reproduction. Mating types (types of gametes, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of anisogamy (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female sexes may have evolved before anisogamy. It is also unknown why most sexual organisms use a binary mating system, and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism. Charles Darwin was the first to suggest that sexual selection drives speciation; without it, complex life would probably not have evolved.

===The right time in evolutionary history===
While life on Earth is regarded to have spawned relatively early in the planet&#x27;s history, the evolution from multicellular to intelligent organisms took around 800 million years. Civilizations on Earth have existed for about 12,000 years, and radio communication reaching space has existed for little more than 100 years. Relative to the age of the Solar System (~4.57 Ga) this is a short time, in which extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes, and large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as life in general. For example, the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in an area the size of Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 Ma ago. About 65 million years ago, the Chicxulub impact at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (~65.5 Ma) on the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico led to a mass extinction.

==Rare Earth equation==
The following discussion is adapted from Cramer. The Rare Earth equation is Ward and Brownlee&#x27;s riposte to the Drake equation. It calculates formula_1, the number of Earth-like planets in the Milky Way having complex life forms, as:

:formula_2

where:
* &quot;N*&quot; is the number of stars in the Milky Way. This number is not well-estimated, because the Milky Way&#x27;s mass is not well estimated, with little information about the number of small stars. &quot;N*&quot; is at least 100 billion, and may be as high as 500 billion, if there are many low visibility stars.
* formula_3 is the average number of planets in a star&#x27;s habitable zone. This zone is fairly narrow, being constrained by the requirement that the average planetary temperature be consistent with water remaining liquid throughout the time required for complex life to evolve. Thus, formula_3=1 is a likely upper bound.
We assume formula_5. The Rare Earth hypothesis can then be viewed as asserting that the product of the other nine Rare Earth equation factors listed below, which are all fractions, is no greater than 10−10 and could plausibly be as small as 10−12. In the latter case, formula_1 could be as small as 0 or 1. Ward and Brownlee do not actually calculate the value of formula_1, because the numerical values of quite a few of the factors below can only be conjectured. They cannot be estimated simply because we have but one data point: the Earth, a rocky planet orbiting a G2 star in a quiet suburb of a large barred spiral galaxy, and the home of the only intelligent species we know; namely, ourselves.
* formula_8 is the fraction of stars in the galactic habitable zone (Ward, Brownlee, and Gonzalez estimate this factor as 0.1).
* formula_9 is the fraction of stars in the Milky Way with planets.
* formula_10 is the fraction of planets that are rocky (&quot;metallic&quot;) rather than gaseous.
* formula_11 is the fraction of habitable planets where microbial life arises. Ward and Brownlee believe this fraction is unlikely to be small.
* formula_12 is the fraction of planets where complex life evolves. For 80% of the time since microbial life first appeared on the Earth, there was only bacterial life. Hence Ward and Brownlee argue that this fraction may be small.
* formula_13 is the fraction of the total lifespan of a planet during which complex life is present. Complex life cannot endure indefinitely, because the energy put out by the sort of star that allows complex life to emerge gradually rises, and the central star eventually becomes a red giant, engulfing all planets in the planetary habitable zone. Also, given enough time, a catastrophic extinction of all complex life becomes ever more likely.
* formula_14 is the fraction of habitable planets with a large moon. If the giant impact theory of the Moon&#x27;s origin is correct, this fraction is small.
* formula_15 is the fraction of planetary systems with large Jovian planets. This fraction could be large.
* formula_16 is the fraction of planets with a sufficiently low number of extinction events. Ward and Brownlee argue that the low number of such events the Earth has experienced since the Cambrian explosion may be unusual, in which case this fraction would be small.

Lammer, Scherf et al. define Earth-like habitats (EHs) as rocky exoplanets within the habitable zone of
complex life (HZCL) on which Earth-like N2-O2-dominated atmospheres with minor amounts of CO2 can exist.
They estimate the maximum number of EHs in the Milky Way as formula_17, with the actual number of EHs being possibly much less than that.
This would reduce the Rare Earth equation to:
:formula_18

The Rare Earth equation, unlike the Drake equation, does not factor the probability that complex life evolves into intelligent life that discovers technology. Barrow and Tipler review the consensus among such biologists that the evolutionary path from primitive Cambrian chordates, e.g., &quot;Pikaia&quot; to &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, was a highly improbable event. For example, the large brains of humans have marked adaptive disadvantages, requiring as they do an expensive metabolism, a long gestation period, and a childhood lasting more than 25% of the average total life span. Other improbable features of humans include:
*Being one of a handful of extant bipedal land (non-avian) vertebrate. Combined with an unusual eye–hand coordination, this permits dextrous manipulations of the physical environment with the hands;
*A vocal apparatus far more expressive than that of any other mammal, enabling speech. Speech makes it possible for humans to interact cooperatively, to share knowledge, and to acquire a culture;
*The capability of formulating abstractions to a degree permitting the invention of mathematics, and the discovery of science and technology. Only recently did humans acquire anything like their current scientific and technological sophistication.

==Advocates==
Writers who support the Rare Earth hypothesis:
* Stuart Ross Taylor, a specialist on the Solar System, firmly believed in the hypothesis. Taylor concluded that the Solar System is probably unusual, because it resulted from so many chance factors and events.
* Stephen Webb, a physicist, mainly presents and rejects candidate solutions for the Fermi paradox. The Rare Earth hypothesis emerges as one of the few solutions left standing by the end of the book
* Simon Conway Morris, a paleontologist, endorses the Rare Earth hypothesis in chapter 5 of his &quot;Life&#x27;s Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe&quot;, and cites Ward and Brownlee&#x27;s book with approval.
* John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler, cosmologists, vigorously defend the hypothesis that humans are likely to be the only intelligent life in the Milky Way, and perhaps the entire universe. But this hypothesis is not central to their book &quot;The Anthropic Cosmological Principle&quot;, a thorough study of the anthropic principle and of how the laws of physics are peculiarly suited to enable the emergence of complexity in nature.
* Ray Kurzweil, a computer pioneer and self-proclaimed Singularitarian, argues in his 2005 book &quot;The Singularity Is Near&quot; that the coming Singularity requires that Earth be the first planet on which sapient, technology-using life evolved. Although other Earth-like planets could exist, Earth must be the most evolutionarily advanced, because otherwise we would have seen evidence that another culture had experienced the Singularity and expanded to harness the full computational capacity of the physical universe.
* John Gribbin, a prolific science writer, defends the hypothesis in &quot;Alone in the Universe: Why our planet is unique&quot; (2011).
* Michael H. Hart, an astrophysicist who proposed a narrow habitable zone based on climate studies, edited the influential 1982 book &quot;Extraterrestrials: Where are They&quot; and authored one of its chapters &quot;Atmospheric Evolution, the Drake Equation and DNA: Sparse Life in an Infinite Universe&quot;.
*Marc J. Defant, professor of geochemistry and volcanology, elaborated on several aspects of the rare Earth hypothesis in his TEDx talk entitled: Why We are Alone in the Galaxy. He also wrote in his book in 1998: &quot;I do not believe that we were the destined outcome of evolution. In fact, we are probably the result of an incredible number of chance circumstances (one example is the meteorite impact at the end of the Cretaceous which probably destroyed the dinosaurs and led to mammal domination). The coincidental nature of our evolution should be clear from this book. I might even contend that so many &quot;coincidences&quot; had to take place during the history of the universe, that intelligent life on this planet may be the only life in our universe. I do not mean to suggest that we must have been &quot;created.&quot; I mean to say that maybe there is not as much chance of finding life in our galaxy or universe as some would have us believe. We may be it.&quot;
* Brian Cox, physicist and popular science celebrity confesses his support for the hypothesis in his 2014 BBC production of the &quot;Human Universe&quot;.
* Richard Dawkins, evolutionary biologist, notes the Fermi paradox in his book, &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, while discussing how life first evolved on Earth. Although we do not yet know the precise process for how life first began on Earth, Dawkins&#x27;s view is that it is an implausible theory (i.e., improbable) given we have not encountered any evidence for life existing elsewhere in the universe. He concludes that life is probably very rare throughout the universe.

==Criticism==
Cases against the Rare Earth hypothesis take various forms.

=== The hypothesis appears anthropocentric ===
The hypothesis concludes, more or less, that complex life is rare because it can evolve only on the surface of an Earth-like planet or on a suitable satellite of a planet. Some biologists, such as Jack Cohen, believe this assumption too restrictive and unimaginative; they see it as a form of circular reasoning.

According to David Darling, the Rare Earth hypothesis is neither hypothesis nor prediction, but merely a description of how life arose on Earth. In his view, Ward and Brownlee have done nothing more than select the factors that best suit their case.
Critics also argue that there is a link between the Rare Earth hypothesis and the unscientific idea of intelligent design.

===Exoplanets around main sequence stars are being discovered in large numbers===

An increasing number of extrasolar planet discoveries are being made, with planets in planetary systems known as of . Rare Earth proponents argue life cannot arise outside Sun-like systems, due to tidal locking and ionizing radiation outside the F7–K1 range. However, some exobiologists have suggested that stars outside this range may give rise to life under the right circumstances; this possibility is a central point of contention to the theory because these late-K and M category stars make up about 82% of all hydrogen-burning stars.

Current technology limits the testing of important Rare Earth criteria: surface water, tectonic plates, a large moon and biosignatures are currently undetectable. Though planets the size of Earth are difficult to detect and classify, scientists now think that rocky planets are common around Sun-like stars. The Earth Similarity Index (ESI) of mass, radius and temperature provides a means of measurement, but falls short of the full Rare Earth criteria.

===Rocky planets orbiting within habitable zones may not be rare===
Some argue that Rare Earth&#x27;s estimates of rocky planets in habitable zones (formula_3 in the Rare Earth equation) are too restrictive. James Kasting cites the Titius–Bode law to contend that it is a misnomer to describe habitable zones as narrow when there is a 50% chance of at least one planet orbiting within one. In 2013, astronomers using the Kepler space telescope&#x27;s data estimated that about one-fifth of G-type and K-type stars (sun-like stars and orange dwarfs) are expected to have an Earth-sized or super-Earth-sized planet ( Earths wide) close to an Earth-like orbit (), yielding about 8.8 billion of them for the entire Milky Way Galaxy.

===Uncertainty over Jupiter&#x27;s role===
The requirement for a system to have a Jovian planet as protector (Rare Earth equation factor formula_15) has been challenged, affecting the number of proposed extinction events (Rare Earth equation factor formula_16). Kasting&#x27;s 2001 review of Rare Earth questions whether a Jupiter protector has any bearing on the incidence of complex life. Computer modelling including the 2005 Nice model and 2007 Nice 2 model yield inconclusive results in relation to Jupiter&#x27;s gravitational influence and impacts on the inner planets. A study by Horner and Jones (2008) using computer simulation found that while the total effect on all orbital bodies within the Solar System is unclear, Jupiter has caused more impacts on Earth than it has prevented. Lexell&#x27;s Comet, a 1770 near miss that passed closer to Earth than any other comet in recorded history, was known to be caused by the gravitational influence of Jupiter. 

===Plate tectonics may not be unique to Earth or a requirement for complex life===

Ward and Brownlee argue that for complex life to evolve (Rare Earth equation factor formula_12), tectonics must be present to generate biogeochemical cycles, and predicted that such geological features would not be found outside of Earth, pointing to a lack of observable mountain ranges and subduction. There is, however, no scientific consensus on the evolution of plate tectonics on Earth. Though it is believed that tectonic motion first began around three billion years ago, by this time photosynthesis and oxygenation had already begun. Furthermore, recent studies point to plate tectonics as an episodic planetary phenomenon, and that life may evolve during periods of &quot;stagnant-lid&quot; rather than plate tectonic states.

Recent evidence also points to similar activity either having occurred or continuing to occur elsewhere. The geology of Pluto, for example, described by Ward and Brownlee as &quot;without mountains or volcanoes ... devoid of volcanic activity&quot;, has since been found to be quite the contrary, with a geologically active surface possessing organic molecules and mountain ranges like Tenzing Montes and Hillary Montes comparable in relative size to those of Earth, and observations suggest the involvement of endogenic processes. Plate tectonics has been suggested as a hypothesis for the Martian dichotomy, and in 2012 geologist An Yin put forward evidence for active plate tectonics on Mars. Europa has long been suspected to have plate tectonics and in 2014 NASA announced evidence of active subduction. Like Europa, analysis of the surface of Jupiter&#x27;s largest moon Ganymede strike-strip faulting and surface materials of possible endogenic origin suggests that plate tectonics has also taken place there.

In 2017, scientists studying the geology of Charon confirmed that icy plate tectonics also operated on Pluto&#x27;s largest moon. Since 2017 several studies of the geodynamics of Venus have also found that, contrary to the view that the lithosphere of Venus is static, it is actually being deformed via active processes similar to plate tectonics, though with less subduction, implying that geodynamics are not a rare occurrence in Earth sized bodies.

Kasting suggests that there is nothing unusual about the occurrence of plate tectonics in large rocky planets and liquid water on the surface as most should generate internal heat even without the assistance of radioactive elements. Studies by Valencia and Cowan suggest that plate tectonics may be inevitable for terrestrial planets Earth-sized or larger, that is, Super-Earths, which are now known to be more common in planetary systems.

===Free oxygen may be neither rare nor a prerequisite for multicellular life===

The hypothesis that molecular oxygen, necessary for animal life, is rare and that a Great Oxygenation Event (Rare Earth equation factor formula_12) could only have been triggered and sustained by tectonics, appears to have been invalidated by more recent discoveries.

Ward and Brownlee ask &quot;whether oxygenation, and hence the rise of animals, would ever have occurred on a world where there were no continents to erode&quot;. Extraterrestrial free oxygen has recently been detected around other solid objects, including Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter&#x27;s four Galilean moons, Saturn&#x27;s moons Enceladus, Dione and Rhea and even the atmosphere of a comet. This has led scientists to speculate whether processes other than photosynthesis could be capable of generating an environment rich in free oxygen. Wordsworth (2014) concludes that oxygen generated other than through photodissociation may be likely on Earth-like exoplanets, and could actually lead to false positive detections of life. Narita (2015) suggests photocatalysis by titanium dioxide as a geochemical mechanism for producing oxygen atmospheres.

Since Ward &amp; Brownlee&#x27;s assertion that &quot;there is irrefutable evidence that oxygen is a necessary ingredient for animal life&quot;, anaerobic metazoa have been found that indeed do metabolise without oxygen. &quot;Spinoloricus cinziae&quot;, for example, a species discovered in the hypersaline anoxic L&#x27;Atalante basin at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea in 2010, appears to metabolise with hydrogen, lacking mitochondria and instead using hydrogenosomes. Studies since 2015 of the eukaryotic genus &quot;Monocercomonoides&quot; that lack mitochondrial organelles are also significant as there are no detectable signs that mitochondria are part of the organism. Since then further eukaryotes, particularly parasites, have been identified to be completely absent of mitochondrial genome, such as the 2020 discovery in &quot;Henneguya zschokkei&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1073/pnas.1909907117&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigation into alternative metabolic pathways used by these organisms appear to present further problems for the premise.

Stevenson (2015) has proposed other membrane alternatives for complex life in worlds without oxygen. In 2017, scientists from the NASA Astrobiology Institute discovered the necessary chemical preconditions for the formation of azotosomes on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, a world that lacks atmospheric oxygen. Independent studies by Schirrmeister and by Mills concluded that Earth&#x27;s multicellular life existed prior to the Great Oxygenation Event, not as a consequence of it.

NASA scientists Hartman and McKay argue that plate tectonics may in fact slow the rise of oxygenation (and thus stymie complex life rather than promote it). Computer modelling by Tilman Spohn in 2014 found that plate tectonics on Earth may have arisen from the effects of complex life&#x27;s emergence, rather than the other way around as the Rare Earth might suggest. The action of lichens on rock may have contributed to the formation of subduction zones in the presence of water. Kasting argues that if oxygenation caused the Cambrian explosion then any planet with oxygen producing photosynthesis should have complex life.

===A magnetosphere may not be rare or a requirement===
The importance of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field to the development of complex life has been disputed. The origin of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field remains a mystery though the presence of a magnetosphere appears to be relatively common for larger planetary mass objects as all Solar System planets larger than Earth possess one. There is increasing evidence of present or past magnetic activity in terrestrial bodies such as the Moon, Ganymede, Mercury and Mars. Without sufficient measurement present studies rely heavily on modelling methods developed in 2006 by Olson &amp; Christensen to predict field strength. Using a sample of 496 planets such models predict Kepler-186f to be one of few of Earth size that would support a magnetosphere (though such a field around this planet has not currently been confirmed). However current recent empirical evidence points to the occurrence of much larger and more powerful fields than those found in our Solar System, some of which cannot be explained by these models.

Kasting argues that the atmosphere provides sufficient protection against cosmic rays even during times of magnetic pole reversal and atmosphere loss by sputtering. Kasting also dismisses the role of the magnetic field in the evolution of eukaryotes, citing the age of the oldest known magnetofossils.

===A large moon may be neither rare nor necessary===
The requirement of a large moon (Rare Earth equation factor formula_14) has also been challenged. Even if it were required, such an occurrence may not be as unique as predicted by the Rare Earth Hypothesis. Work by Edward Belbruno and J. Richard Gott of Princeton University suggests that giant impactors such as those that may have formed the Moon can indeed form in planetary trojan points ( or Lagrangian point) which means that similar circumstances may occur in other planetary systems.

The assertion that the Moon&#x27;s stabilization of Earth&#x27;s obliquity and spin is a requirement for complex life has been questioned. Kasting argues that a moonless Earth would still possess habitats with climates suitable for complex life and questions whether the spin rate of a moonless Earth can be predicted. Although the giant impact theory posits that the impact forming the Moon increased Earth&#x27;s rotational speed to make a day about 5 hours long, the Moon has slowly &quot;stolen&quot; much of this speed to reduce Earth&#x27;s solar day since then to about 24 hours and continues to do so: in 100 million years Earth&#x27;s solar day will be roughly 24 hours 38 minutes (the same as Mars&#x27;s solar day); in 1 billion years, 30 hours 23 minutes. Larger secondary bodies would exert proportionally larger tidal forces that would in turn decelerate their primaries faster and potentially increase the solar day of a planet in all other respects like Earth to over 120 hours within a few billion years. This long solar day would make effective heat dissipation for organisms in the tropics and subtropics extremely difficult in a similar manner to tidal locking to a red dwarf star. Short days (high rotation speed) cause high wind speeds at ground level. Long days (slow rotation speed) cause the day and night temperatures to be too extreme.

Many Rare Earth proponents argue that the Earth&#x27;s plate tectonics would probably not exist if not for the tidal forces of the Moon or the impact of Theia (prolonging mantle effects). The hypothesis that the Moon&#x27;s tidal influence initiated or sustained Earth&#x27;s plate tectonics remains unproven, though at least one study implies a temporal correlation to the formation of the Moon. Evidence for the past existence of plate tectonics on planets like Mars which may never have had a large moon would counter this argument, although plate tectonics may fade anyway before a moon is relevant to life. Kasting argues that a large moon is not required to initiate plate tectonics.

===Complex life may arise in alternative habitats===
Rare Earth proponents argue that simple life may be common, though complex life requires specific environmental conditions to arise. Critics consider life could arise on a moon of a gas giant, though this is less likely if life requires volcanicity. The moon must have stresses to induce tidal heating, but not so dramatic as seen on Jupiter&#x27;s Io. However, the moon is within the gas giant&#x27;s intense radiation belts, sterilizing any biodiversity before it can get established. Dirk Schulze-Makuch disputes this, hypothesizing alternative biochemistries for alien life. While Rare Earth proponents argue that only microbial extremophiles could exist in subsurface habitats beyond Earth, some argue that complex life can also arise in these environments. Examples of extremophile animals such as the &quot;Hesiocaeca methanicola&quot;, an animal that inhabits ocean floor methane clathrates substances more commonly found in the outer Solar System, the tardigrades which can survive in the vacuum of space or &quot;Halicephalobus mephisto&quot; which exists in crushing pressure, scorching temperatures and extremely low oxygen levels 3.6 kilometres ( 2.2 miles) deep in the Earth&#x27;s crust, are sometimes cited by critics as complex life capable of thriving in &quot;alien&quot; environments. Jill Tarter counters the classic counterargument that these species adapted to these environments rather than arose in them, by suggesting that we cannot assume conditions for life to emerge which are not actually known. There are suggestions that complex life could arise in sub-surface conditions which may be similar to those where life may have arisen on Earth, such as the tidally heated subsurfaces of Europa or Enceladus. Ancient circumvental ecosystems such as these support complex life on Earth such as &quot;Riftia pachyptila&quot; that exist completely independent of the surface biosphere.

<text>&quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; is a song written by Mars Bonfire and first released as a single by Steppenwolf. Although the lyrics do not specifically mention motorcycles, the song is often invoked in both popular and counterculture to denote a biker appearance or attitude since being featured in the 1969 film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. Sometimes, &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; is described as the first heavy metal song, and the second-verse lyric &quot;heavy metal thunder&quot; marks the first use of this term in rock music (although not as a description of a musical style, but rather a motorcycle).

==Composition==
Mars Bonfire wrote &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; as a ballad. Bonfire was previously a member of the Sparrows, the predecessor band to Steppenwolf, and his brother was Steppenwolf&#x27;s drummer. Although he initially offered the song to other bands — The Human Expression, for one — &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; was first recorded by Steppenwolf in a sped-up and rearranged version that AllMusic&#x27;s Hal Horowitz described as &quot;a roaring anthem of turbo-charged riff rock&quot; and &quot;a timeless radio classic as well as a slice of &#x27;60s revolt that at once defines Steppenwolf&#x27;s sound and provided them with their shot at AM immortality&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; was Steppenwolf&#x27;s third single off their self-titled debut album, and became their signature song, reaching number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot100 singles charts. It was kept from the number-one spot by &quot;People Got to Be Free&quot; by the Rascals. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; at number129 on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. Also in 2004, it finished at number29 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. In 2009, it was named the 53rd-best hard rock song of all time by VH1 (It had ranked 40th in the 100 Greatest Songs of Rock and Roll by VH1 nine years earlier.). In 2018, the song was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in a new category for singles.

Other artists who covered this song include Hinder, Etta James, Link Wray, Slade, The Cult, INXS, Ozzy Osbourne with Miss Piggy, Bruce Springsteen, Slayer, Blue Öyster Cult, Status Quo, Fanfare Ciocărlia, Krokus, Wilson Pickett, and La Renga.

<text>The gray bat (Myotis grisescens) is a species of microbat endemic to North America. It once flourished in caves all over the southeastern United States, but due to human disturbance, gray bat populations declined severely during the early and mid portion of the 20th century. 95% of gray bats now hibernate in only 15 caves. &quot;M. grisescens&quot; has been listed as federally endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service since 1976, and is protected under the Endangered Species Act. Gray bat populations were estimated at approximately 2 million bats around the time they were placed on the Endangered Species list. By the early 1980s populations of gray bats dropped to 1.6 million. With conservation efforts in place, in 2004, gray bat populations were estimated to have reached 3.4 million.

==Description==

&quot;M. grisescens&quot; are the largest members of their genus in the eastern United States. Of all U.S. mammals, gray bats are, perhaps, the most cave-dependent. Gray bats have uni-colored dark gray fur on their backs that may bleach to a russet or chestnut brown after the molting season (July or August). Unlike in other species of &quot;Myotis&quot;, where the wing membrane connects to the toe, in &quot;M. grisescens&quot;, the wing membrane connects to the ankle. Gray bats typically weigh between 7 and 16 grams. Gray bats can live up to 17 years, but only about 50% of gray bats survive to maturity. Sexual maturity occurs at about age two. Although an adult gray bat&#x27;s forearm measures only about 40–46 mm, Gray bats with forearm lengths of 39.5 mm (approx. 1.55 in) or less cannot fly. The flight speed of the gray bat, &quot;M. grisescens&quot;, has been calculated at 20.3 km/h (12.61 mph) during migration. While foraging, gray bats have been clocked at a flying rate of anywhere between 17 km/h and 39 km/h.

Annual molting occurs between early June and early August, during which gray bats eat larger amounts of hair than at other times during the activity season. During grooming, gray bats also ingest ectoparasites such as chiggers that live in their fur. Gray bats are believed to groom extensively before beginning their nightly hunt. They then spend the nighttime hours hunting and digesting.

Gray bats in the wild may reach ages of at least 13–14 years (based on recapture of banded individuals), although this is considered exceptional.

==Distribution==
Gray bats live in limestone karst areas in the southeastern United States. Summer and winter (hibernation) ranges overlap but are not identical. Hibernation occurs in caves in northern Alabama, northern Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee. During summer, the species ranges further and can be found in eastern Oklahoma and Kansas, southern Illinois and Indiana, southwestern Virginia, western North Carolina, northwestern South Carolina, and northern Georgia. A very small number of records from West Virginia and Mississippi are considered to represent vagrants. Historically attested populations in Florida appear to be absent as of 2020. Gray bats are cave obligate (or cave dependent) bats, meaning that with very few exceptions (in which cave-like conditions are created in man-made structures like sewers and culverts) gray bats only live in caves, not in abandoned barns or other structures as other species of bats are known to do. Less than 5% of all available caves are inhabited by gray bats. Thus, any disturbance to these cave habitats can be extremely detrimental to gray bat populations.

===Cave characteristics===
Although the habitat range of the gray bat incorporates much of the southeastern United States, the largest summer colonies of gray bats are located within the Guntersville Reservoir. This reservoir, found in northeastern Alabama, contains the Sauta (formerly Blowing Wind) and Hambrick caves which can accommodate over 200,000 gray bats combined. Gray bats use caves differently at different times of the year. For example, populations of gray bats tend to cluster in caves known as hibernacula to prepare for winter hibernation. In contrast, their populations disperse during the spring to establish sexually segregated colonies. Females form maternity colonies (also known as summer maternity roosts) while males aggregate in non-maternity, or bachelor colonies. These bachelor colonies also house yearlings of both sexes. Gray bats also utilize a third type of cave, the dispersal cave, which they inhabit only during migration.

For their hibernacula, gray bats prefer deep, cool caves with average temperatures ranging from 5 to 11 °C. Multiple entrances and good airflow comprise the other characteristics that gray bats find desirable. Winter hibernacula are already cold when gray bats begin arriving in September. Summer caves are usually located along rivers and have temperatures that range from 14 to 25 °C. Summer caves typically contain structural heat traps (including domed ceilings, small chambers, and porous rock surfaces) that capture the metabolic heat from the clustered gray bats, allowing the nursery populations to succeed. Preferred summer colony caves are within 1 km of a body of water and are rarely further than 4 km away from a lake or major river. The average roosting density of gray bats is 1828 bats/m2.

==Biology and behavior==
===Foraging===
Gray bats forage over water, including streams and reservoirs, where they consume night-flying insects most of which have aquatic larval stages, and in the riparian forests nearby these water sources. &quot;M. grisescens&quot; activity tends to be concentrated over slower-moving water or quiet pools than areas of fast-moving water. Foraging usually occurs below treetop height but above 2m. Gray bats tend to fly downstream more often than upstream, suggesting a potential preference for wider sections typical of downstream sections as opposed to upstream portions (with a tendency to be narrower). &quot;M. grisescens&quot; tend to forage over extensive ranges, averaging 12.5 km but ranging from 2.5 km to 35.4 km. 
While gray bats have been shown to forage in small groups when prey is abundant, especially during the early hours of the night, when prey is scarce, gray bats can become territorial. Territories tend to be controlled by reproductive females. These females seem to claim the same territory year after year.

===Diet===
Gray bats consume a variety of insects including Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (flies), Ephemeroptera (mayflies, of which gray bats consume at least six species), Lepidoptera (moths), Neuroptera (net-winged insects), Trichoptera (caddis flies), and Plecoptera (stoneflies). Juveniles have a tendency to forage more in woodlands and eat more beetles than adults, perhaps they provide a greater energy reward per unit of capture effort. For example, beetles provide 1900–2800 calories/g wet weight versus 800–1400 calories/g wet weight for mayflies. &quot;M. grisescens&quot; juveniles also eat a less diverse diet than adults, possibly because juveniles are more dependent on high concentrations of prey or swarming prey. Gray bats are believed to be part opportunists, and part selective eaters. (Outside of captivity, gray bats are limited by the sporadic emergences of potential prey. When prey emerges, there is only an abundance of a few taxa at any given time. The available taxa change based on the time of night, the month, and the time during the activity season.) In their natural habitats, gray bats appear to attack any moving target that is of appropriate size, consistent with optimal foraging theory that predicts palatable insects of an appropriate size should be eaten when encountered. In captivity, under controlled laboratory conditions, however, insectivorous bats used echolocation to discriminate heavily among potential prey based on shape and texture of a target. This lack of discrimination may be because of the rapid flight of bats and the short range at which prey can be detected using echolocation, allowing bats only a fraction of a second after detection to capture prey. However, gray bats are believed to discriminate somewhat between insects when foraging in their natural habitat, consuming higher numbers of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, and in some populations Trichoptera, than their proportional prevalence would have otherwise indicated without selective foraging. Because of this tendency to select prey while being largely opportunistic, gray bats have been dubbed &#x27;selective opportunists&#x27;. Scientists believe that food moves quickly through the digestive tract of &quot;M. grisescens&quot;, with feces being purged from the body within 1–2 hours after ingestion.

===Migration, hibernation, and reproduction===
Fall migration occurs in approximately the same order as spring emergence, with females departing first (early September for fall migration) and juveniles leaving last (mid-October). Gray bats may migrate as far as from summer caves to reach hibernation caves, although based on band recovery data and the spatial distribution of summer and winter roosts, a migration range below appears to be the norm. The annual activity period of gray bats is April to October, though female gray bats enter hibernation in September.

After arriving at winter caves, copulation occurs. Females immediately enter hibernation, while males may remain active for a few more weeks. Males use this extra time before entering hibernation to replenish fat reserves used during breeding. Males begin hibernation by early November. During hibernation, the body temperature of gray bats drops close to the ambient temperature, allowing the body to conserve fat. These fat reserves must last the approximately six months of hibernation and spring migration. Adult mortality is especially high during spring migration, as bats that do not have sufficient fat reserves have difficulties surviving the stress and energy-intensive migration period. After copulation, females store sperm in their uteri, ovulating only after they have emerged from hibernation. Gestation in gray bats lasts 60 to 70 days, with birth occurring in late May and early June. Gray bat females give birth to one offspring per clutch (bout of reproduction), thus giving birth to one offspring per year. Therefore, gray bats demonstrate an iteroparous life-history strategy. The young clings to the mother for about a week, after which they remain in the maternity colony until they are able to fly. Most young take flight by four weeks of age (late June to mid-July).

===Energy expenditure and growth===
Gray bats, as is the case in other organisms, acquire and use energy for growth and maintenance of their bodies before reaching sexual maturity, at which point much of their energy expenditure is devoted to reproductive processes. Gray bats prefer caves located near appropriate foraging sites to reduce the energy costs of flying long distances to find food. Gray bats roost in large colonies to reduce the cost of temperature regulation on the individual. Female bats must maintain relatively high body temperatures in comparison to the cooler temperatures of the cave during lactation, requiring large amounts of energy. During the peak lactation period, when young are roughly 20–30 days old, females may spend as many as 7 hours a night feeding. Because of the high energy demands on the females, larger roosts are more beneficial so that all may share the burden of maintaining body temperature. The formation of large colonies does at some point, however, have a negative trade-off. As the size of the colony increases, intraspecific competition for food resources increase, forcing an individual to forage over a larger range. This increased foraging range will lead to greater energy expenditure, potentially reducing growth in gray bat juveniles. The distance a gray bat travels from the roosting area to foraging area has been shown to be negatively correlated to the average weight of gray bats (the longer the distance the bat must fly to forage, the less the bat will weigh), lending support to the idea that long flights are energetically costly.

==Threats==
The tendency of gray bats to form large colonies made the gray bat especially vulnerable to population decline due to both intentional and unintentional human disturbance. While gray bat habitat locations were always &#x27;patchy,&#x27; gray bat habitats have become increasingly more isolated and fragmented with human perturbation. Suspected factors contributing to species decline include impoundment of waterways (the creation of dams, which causes flooding in former bat caves), cave commercialization, natural flooding, pesticides, water pollution and siltation, and local deforestation. All North American bat species classified as endangered or threatened by the US. Fish and Wildlife service are cave dwelling species. Of these species, the gray bat congregates in larger numbers at fewer winter hibernacula than any other North American bat. Approximately 95% of gray bats hibernate in 15 winter hibernacula, with 31% hibernating in a single cave located in northern Alabama. Because of their high population densities in appropriate habitats, gray bats serve as an important indicator species for conservation efforts.

===Pesticide use===
Pesticide use and manufacturing have been one of the most prevalently studied contributions to population decline of &quot;M. grisescens&quot;. One such study focused on gray bat populations of the Tennessee River area of northern Alabama where scientists and conservators noted a higher than normal gray bat mortality. In this area, since 1947, large amounts of DDTR (DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), DDD, and DDE) flowed through waterways from the DDT manufacturing site located on the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Alabama down to the habitat area of &quot;M. grisescens&quot;, where heavy contamination of the local biota has occurred. Lethal chemical concentrations of DDT in the brains of adult bats are about 1.5 times higher than in juveniles. Because &quot;M. grisescens&quot; feed on many types of insects with aquatic larval stages, it is believed that this food source may be the root of the chemical concentrations. Many of the bats tested in different studies were juveniles not able to fly, and thus were likely to have only consumed milk. After concentration through lactation, a few parts per million in prey of the adult gray bat would cause mortality in these juveniles. Under conditions of rapid fat utilization, such as migratory stress or initiation of flight by juveniles, residue mobilization of harmful chemicals may occur, causing mortality. Other pesticides linked with gray bat population decline include dieldrin and dieldrin&#x27;s parent compound aldrin, which have also increased mortality in other bat species. Even though the manufacture of DDT ceased in 1970 and the manufacture of dieldrin and aldrin in October 1974, heavy contamination of the biota persisted. Recently, however, guano samples from various habitats indicate a decline in certain detrimental chemicals. For example, guano from Cave Springs cave shows a decline of 41% in DDE (a compound related to DDT) between 1976 and 1985 and guano from Key Cave shows a decline of 67% for the same time period. However, it is unknown how long these chemicals will remain in concentrations that will cause harm to wildlife.

===Human disturbance===
Direct human disturbance and vandalism is the major factor leading to population decline in gray bats. During the 1960s, bats were killed for entertainment purposes as they emerged from caves or were caught to be used for pranks. Many property-owners attempted to exterminate entire colonies due to unsubstantiated fears that the bats may be carrying rabies. Bats that roost within inside the cave and only above the cave floor are especially prone to vandalism and high-intensity disturbance. Bats that roost in higher ceilings or further inside the cave are less prone to direct destruction. One study showed that caves with ceiling heights greater than above the floor were virtually protected from spelunkers. Even without direct destruction, human visitation to caves can cause adverse effects on gray bat populations. Each human entry into a cave causes all bats within range of light or sound to at least partially arouse from hibernation. Arousal of gray bats while they are hibernating can cause them to use up energy, lowering their energy reserves. Because these reserves must sustain the bats through hibernation and spring migration, if the bat runs out of reserves, it may leave the cave too soon, decreasing its chances of survival. Each disturbance during hibernation is estimated to use energy that otherwise could sustain a gray bat through 10–30 days of undisturbed hibernation. When flightless young are present in June and July, females escaping a predator or other disturbance may drop their young in the panic, leading to increased juvenile mortality.

===White-nose syndrome===
In contrast to most other species in the genus &quot;Myotis&quot;, gray bats appear to be largely unaffected by white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that since the mid-2000s has decimated bat populations in the United States. Continuous surveys since 2009 have indicated that gray bats may be largely resistant to the disease even when sharing roosts with infected individuals of other species.

==Conservation==
===Cave gating===
Many factors play an important role in determining a viable habitat for &quot;M. grisescens&quot;. Among these are the natural characteristics of the cave entrance, physical features of the cave, and surface climate. These contributing factors play an especially important role in determining the internal conditions that foster cave fauna. Because the gray bat is a cave dwelling species, its range is limited to caves whose internal conditions are favorable. Human intervention has caused a precipitous decline in the number of suitable caves for the gray bat. Thus, to maximize the gray bat&#x27;s range, the United States government is funding cave gating programs. Cave gating is an accepted method in protecting cave dwelling species as it limits the impact of human disturbance upon internal cave conditions. In constructing internal cave gates, several key parameters were implemented to minimize changes in the airflow through the cave and the ability of the bats to either access or leave the cave. With these limitations in mind, the internal cave gating was placed 5 to 15 meters in advance of historically critical roost areas. In addition, a 15 cm clearance between bars of the gating was allowed to ensure unobstructed flight into and out of the cave. Early cave gating methods that did not account for these factors frequently led to cave abandonment. In assessing the proficiency of cave gating, two metrics were established: population dynamics before and after the construction of cave gate and initiation of emergence from the cave. Population estimates were derived from the accumulation of bat guano. More guano indicated the presence of a larger population. In manipulating the emergence of gray bats from the caves under study, infrared light sources were used. Observations of the frequency of emergence of the bats from open caves and gated caves confirm that gating is not an impediment. Gated entrances, however, have provided new opportunities for natural predators of gray bats. Because gates sometimes require the bats to fly slower, as well as providing hunting perches to predators within reach of emerging bats, natural predation may be increased by cave gating.

===Protecting populations===
In their 1982 Gray Bat Recovery Plan, the US Fish and Wildlife Service laid out steps to stop decline of gray bat populations and preserve gray bat habitats. In this plan, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed purchasing the caves where gray bats are known to live, and at these locations reducing human access to prevent human disturbance. To reduce human impact on gray bat populations, gating, fencing, signposting, and surveillance by law enforcement may be utilized. Because gray bats use different caves depending on the season, efforts should be focused seasonally. Rivers, reservoir shorelines, and forests should be left intact near gray bat caves to allow for adequate foraging. Any activity occurring within a 25 km radius of a major gray bat cave, such as pesticide use, herbicide use, clearing, or any activity that may result in siltation should be carefully considered and revised if necessary. Government officials and landowners of property with gray bat caves should be educated about gray bats and potentially harmful activities. Finally, the US Fish and Wildlife Service recognized the need for continuing research from the scientific community to further understand human impact on this vulnerable species.

As of 2022, 70% of significant summer roosting sites and 14 of the 15 major hibernacula are considered permanently protected by a variety of means, affording year-round protection for the majority of the known population.

===Legal status===
In the western portion of the range of &quot;M. grisescens&quot;, from 1978 to 2002, &quot;M. grisescens&quot; populations at 21 of 48 (44%) maternity caves showed a significantly increasing trend, 17 (35%) had no trend, and 10 (21%) were decreasing. A study in 2003 attempted a species-wide assessment in gray bat summer cave populations. This study found that of 76 maternity colonies, 3 (4%) were increasing, 66 (87%) had no discernible trends, and 7 (9%) had decreasing trends. The Endangered Species Act requires that 90% of the most important hibernacula be protected and that populations at 75% of the most important maternity colonies be stable or increasing over a period of 5 years for the gray bat to be down-listed from endangered to threatened status. Because the range of the gray bat is so vast, and sampling techniques so varied and incomplete (thus data is somewhat unreliable when attempting to do species-wide census), gray bats are unlikely to be downgraded in the near future, but total population size has rebounded by ~104% between the 1980s and 2004 (from 1.6 to 3.4 million).

After 37 years without a single documented gray bat within the state boundaries of Mississippi, on September 20, 2004, a male gray bat was discovered in Tishomingo County in northeastern Mississippi, 42 km south of the last known location of &quot;M. grisescens&quot; before their decline and disappearance within the state of Mississippi. (Before this 2004 discovery, the only known gray bats lived at a site known as Chalk Mine, located in the northeastern portion of the county. Gray bats had last been documented at Chalk Mine in 1967.) Extensive human disturbance, including the presence of trash, smoke, and graffiti, is believed to have affected the use of the Chalk Mine by bats. While the discovery of this bat is deemed as a positive sign by conservationists, it is possible that the bat was not from a Mississippi &quot;M. grisescens&quot; population. The closest known gray bat maternal colony, located at Blowing Springs Cave, Alabama, is northeast of where the 2004 gray bat was found, but because gray bats are known to forage over extensive areas, it is possible that this bat belonged to the Blowing Springs Cave colony.

<text>The Royal Winnipeg Ballet is Canada&#x27;s oldest ballet company and the longest continuously operating ballet company in North America.

==History==

It was founded in 1939 as the &quot;Winnipeg Ballet Club&quot; by Gweneth Lloyd and Betty Farrally (who also founded the ballet school The Canadian School of Ballet in British Columbia). The name was changed to the &quot;Winnipeg Ballet&quot; in 1941 and the company began touring Canada in 1945. In 1948, with the initiative of the Winnipeg Ballet, the Canadian Ballet Festival was formed.

The Royal Winnipeg Ballet was granted its royal title in 1953, the first granted under the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. It completed its first American tour in 1954. In June that year the RWB&#x27;s rented premises were devastated by fire; the company&#x27;s entire stock of costumes, original music, choreographic scores and sets were destroyed. Conductor Eric Wild served as the company&#x27;s music director from 1955 to 1962.

The company solidified its reputation under the artistic directorship of Saskatchewan-born Arnold Spohr from 1958 to 1988. Spohr, who first joined the company as a dancer in 1945, during his tenure maintained a strong focus on developing Canadian talent, and, at the same time, he developed the RWB as an international touring company, and actively engaged with choreographers and dancers from around the world to expand the ballet.

Spohr was succeeded by RWB principal dancer Henny Jurriëns who was formerly assistant to Dutch National Ballet director Rudi van Dantzig. Jurriëns, however, died in a car accident in April 1989. In 1990 John Meehan from American Ballet Theatre became artistic director but left in 1993 following the company&#x27;s persistent financial difficulties. William Whitener, formerly the artistic director of Les Ballets Jazz de Montréal, was chosen to succeed Meehan. Continuing financial problems and dancer &quot;unrest&quot;, Whitener was released in less than two years later.

André Lewis was appointed in 1996 as artistic director. Lewis&#x27; decades-long association with the RWB began in 1975 when he was accepted into the Professional Division at the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School. In 1979, he was joined the Royal Winnipeg Ballet Company and performed as a dancer with the RWB until 1990. Lewis&#x27; roles include: Gunther in &quot;Nutcracker&quot;; Mercutio in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;; and Jamie Paul in &quot;The Ecstasy of Rita Joe&quot;. Company Music Director and Conductor is Tad Biernacki and Senior Ballet Master is Johnny W. Chang.

In 1981 the company participated alongside the National Ballet of Canada, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, le Groupe de la Place Royale, the Danny Grossman Dance Company, the Toronto Dance Theatre, Winnipeg&#x27;s Contemporary Dancers and the Anna Wyman Dance Theatre in the Canadian Dance Spectacular, a dance show at Ottawa&#x27;s National Arts Centre which was filmed by the National Film Board of Canada for the 1982 documentary film &quot;Gala&quot;.

The dancer most associated with the RWB has been Evelyn Hart; it also included many other notable dancers including Mikhail Baryshnikov. Born in Toronto, Ontario, in 1956, Hart made her professional debut with the RWB in 1976. In 1980, she was awarded the bronze medal at the World Ballet Concours in Japan, and the gold medal at the Varna International Ballet Competition where she also received the Exceptional Artistic Achievement Award. Both medals were awarded for her performance of Belong pas de deux, created by internationally acclaimed choreographer Norbert Vesak as part of his work &quot;What To Do Till the Messiah Comes&quot;. Hart was awarded the Order of Canada in 1983. She left the RWB in 2005. David Peregrine, Hart&#x27;s long-time partner, joined the Royal Winnipeg Ballet as a member of the corps in 1975 and became a soloist three years later and principal dancer in 1980; that year the pair both performed in Varna. Peregrine was made an officer of the Order of Canada in 1986.

Other Honorable mentions for dancers include principal Laura Graham, who was awarded a Silver medal at the 14th Varna International Ballet Competition in 1990. Her team included principal Steven Hyde, receiving a best non-competing partner honor, and soloist Mark Godden receiving best new choreography for &#x27;Myth&#x27;. Principal dancer Suzanne Rubio followed in 1991 winning a Bronze medal at the 2nd Helsinki International Ballet Competition.

In 1992, Gweneth Lloyd, co-founder of the company, became the first recipient of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement.

The company spends 20 or more weeks a year on the road, presenting more than 100 performances every year in both large and small centres. The company also mounts four productions a year in Winnipeg&#x27;s performing arts venue, the Centennial Concert Hall.

==Royal Winnipeg Ballet School==

The Royal Winnipeg Ballet School is composed of two divisions, Recreational and Professional, and is home to the more than 1,500 students annually. The current building opened in January 1988, and features 12 spacious, sprung-floor studios, and a 224-seat performance space.

The Royal Winnipeg Ballet School, Recreational Division provides training and instruction to students age 3+ in various disciplines including Ballet, Tap, Jazz, Lyrical/Contemporary, Pointe, Musical Theatre, Modern, Creative Movement and Hip Hop. The Recreational Division features an audition-only competitive Dance Ensemble program for high level Junior to Senior students. The school also offers an Intensive Training Program for students who have shown ability and dedication for more intense, specialized training in classical ballet. In this program, numerous ballet classes are supported with additional classes such as pointe, RWB School Dance Ensemble performance groups, conditioning and modern. Students are prepared using the Cecchetti method for classical ballet exams.

Alumni have gone onto careers on Broadway, Rainbow Stage and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre and have continued their education with Arts Umbrella, Goh Ballet, Alberta Ballet, Boston Conservatory and the School of Contemporary Dancers. Students work closely with RWB School Artistic faculty, including award-winning choreographers, and perform new works in festivals and competitions.

The Royal Winnipeg Ballet School, Professional Division is an exclusive, full-time classical ballet training program for students in grades 6 through 12. The school includes approximately 72 young dancers, selected from around the world, and graduates have international careers in top companies in Canada and abroad. The Professional Division instructs students using the Vaganova method of ballet.

David Lee Moroni, a former principal dancer with the RWB, headed the company&#x27;s professional training program from 1970 to 2003. Moroni&#x27;s notable students included: Evelyn Hart, David Peregrine, André Lewis, Tara Birtwhistle, and Jennifer Welsman. In 1990 Moroni received the Order of Canada.

From 2003 until 2016, Arlene Minkhorst was Director of the school; in 2016, Stéphane Léonard assumed the role. Since 2015, Suzanne André has been the Principal of the Professional Division, and since 2016, Nicole Kepp has been the Principal of the Recreational Division.

==Choreography==
In 2002, The Royal Winnipeg Ballet&#x27;s interpretation of the story of Dracula, choreographed by Mark Godden, was filmed in a made for television titled &quot;&quot; directed by Guy Maddin. The film was later released theatrically. Godden, who became the RWB&#x27;s first choreographer in residence in 1991, has created several other major works for the company, including: &quot;Angels in the Architecture&quot;; &quot;Dame Aux Fruits&quot;; &quot;A Darkness Between Us&quot;; &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Wake&quot;; and &quot;Svengali&quot;

Canada&#x27;s Royal Winnipeg Ballet is the first organization to present a theatrical or dance production of the works of Leonard Cohen. During the RWB tenure of Artistic Director Arnold Spohr (1958–1988), in Summer 1970, Brian Macdonald choreographed &quot;The Shining People of Leonard Cohen&quot; which debuted in Paris. That July, it was staged at Canada&#x27;s National Arts Centre in Ottawa – with eclectic band Lighthouse opening the show.

In 2002, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet commissioned American choreographer Val Caniparoli for the first full-length ballet, entitled &quot;Val Caniparoli&#x27;s A Cinderella Story&quot; using the music of composer Richard Rodgers. &quot;The story was familiar, yet original; the choreography sleek, yet classical; the music, a fresh-sounding amalgam of jazz riffs and swirls, based on the themes of one vintage composer. And it is the belle of the ball&quot;.

In May 2012, the company presented the World Premiere of &quot;The Doorway - Scenes from Leonard Cohen&quot;, a contemporary dance piece based on the words and music of Cohen, choreographed by Jorden Morris. Morris&#x27; previous works for the RWB include the highly successful full-length classical ballet &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (2006) and &quot;Moulin Rouge - The Ballet&quot; (2009 premiere). In this newest ballet, consisting of five vignettes, Cohen&#x27;s recorded songs and interviews blend with live music. &quot;Hallelujah&quot; is performed by musician Allison Crowe (voice and piano) and dancers Sophia Lee and Jo-Ann Sundermeier alternating dates. In November 2012 the RWB toured &quot;The Doorway&quot; to great acclaim with three live song performances by Crowe.

<text>Qarabağ Futbol Klubu () is an Azerbaijani professional football club that competes in the Azerbaijan Premier League, the top flight of Azerbaijani football. The club originates from Aghdam in the Karabakh (Azerbaijani: &quot;Qarabağ&quot;) region, but has not played in its hometown since 1993 due to the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. The club now plays in Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan. Qarabağ plays its matches at the Azersun Arena and Tofiq Bahramov Stadium in Baku, which also serves as the venue for Azerbaijan national team matches.

Formed in 1987, Qarabağ were founding members of the Azerbaijan Premier League in 1992. One season later, they won their first league championship, becoming the first non-Baku-based club to win the Premier League title. Qarabağ is one of the two teams in Azerbaijan, along with Neftçi PFK which has participated in all Premier League championships so far.

In 2014, the club won the Premier League, their first league title in 21 years. Qarabağ have won the Premier League eleven times and Azerbaijan Cup eight times. Qarabağ became the second Azerbaijani team after Neftçi PFK to advance to the group stage of a European competition, making its in the UEFA Europa League group stage in 2014–15 season. Qarabağ is the first Azerbaijani team to advance to the group stage of the higher UEFA Champions League, competing in the 2017–18 season. The club has played more UEFA matches than any other Azerbaijani team.

==History==

===Soviet era (1951–1991)===
The club was founded in 1951 as &quot;Mehsul&quot; after the Aghdam city stadium was built; there then began a serious effort towards the creation of a professional football team. Consequently, Qarabağ FK, playing under the name of &quot;Mehsul&quot;, took part in the 1966 Azerbaijani SSR championship. That year, the club reached fourth place in the local championship.

Qarabağ participated in the local championship for four consecutive years during which second place was their best result (achieved in 1969). After 1969, however, owing to carelessness and a lack of financial support, the team withdrew from the championships for almost ten years. In 1977, the team was reborn under name &quot;Shafaq&quot;. In 1982 Shafaq was the only representative of Aghdam in football. Between 1982 and 1987, the squad used the name &quot;Cooperative society&quot;. In 1988, Qarabağ won the champions title in the Azerbaijan SSR local championship under its current name. In addition to championship medals, the club won the right to play in the Soviet Second League.

===Effects of war and financial struggles (1991–2008)===
On 23 July 1993, during the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, the city of Agdam was seized by Armenian armed forces, and the team was forced to move from Imarat Stadium to Baku, while the former head coach and player of the team, Allahverdi Baghirov, died in the war. Despite all these difficulties, in 1993, Qarabağ won the Top League as well as the Azerbaijan Cup. Financial problems plagued the club during the period from 1998 to 2001, and the club went through hard times although it became the first Azerbaijani team to win away from home in a European competition by defeating the Israeli side Maccabi Haifa in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup thanks to a double strike from club legend Mushfig Huseynov. Qarabağ has also represented Azerbaijan in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and UEFA Cup many times.

These problems were alleviated in 2001, when one of the largest holding companies of Azerbaijan, Azersun Holding, starting sponsoring the team. The squad used the name of &quot;Qarabag-Azersun&quot; for two seasons, but then returned its original name in 2004.

===Gurban Gurbanov era (2008–present)===

In 2008, former Azerbaijani football star Gurban Gurbanov was appointed as head coach after the unexpected departure of Rasim Kara to Khazar Lankaran one week before the start of the 2008–09 season. Led by Gurban Gurbanov, Qarabağ have ignored a common strategy in Azerbaijani football: eschewing foreign signings in favour of nurturing local talent. Gurbanov brought with him a &quot;tiki-taka&quot; style of play, characterised by short passes, long periods of build-up and players interchanging positions.

Under Gurbanov, Qarabağ has become one of the most successful Azerbaijani football clubs in Europe (with three consecutive wins) and one which reached the UEFA Europa League play-off-round by beating Rosenborg in the UEFA Europa League, and also eliminated Honka of Finland. The achievements in European competitions marked Gurban Gurbanov as among the most successful Azerbaijani managers ever.

In 2010, the club set an Azerbaijani record for the most significant win in a European competition by beating Metalurg Skopje 4–1 in Baku and eliminating Wisła Kraków to reach the play-offs for the second year in succession. In 2011, the club duplicated the same record by beating Banga Gargždai 4–0 in Gargždai. The 2011–12 season ended in disappointing style for Qarabağ, however, as they finished in fourth place, leaving the club without European competition. In 2013, Qarabağ reached Europa League play-off-round for third time in their history. 

In May 2014, Qarabağ earned its second league title after 21 years. A month later, by beating Red Bull Salzburg, the club became first Azerbaijani side to win in the third round of UEFA Champions League. In August 2014, the club reached Europa League play-off round for the fourth time in last five seasons. In 2014, Qarabağ qualified for the 2014–15 Europa League group stage, becoming the second Azerbaijani team to advance to this stage in a European competition. On 23 October 2014, after defeating Ukrainian club Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk 1–0, the team became the first Azerbaijani club to win a Europa League group stage match.

In 2017, after victory over the Sheriff Tiraspol, Qarabağ qualified for the UEFA Champions League play-off rounds for the first time. In the first leg they recorded a 1–0 victory over Danish side F.C. Copenhagen in Baku. Despite losing 2–1 in the second leg, Qarabağ won on away goals and became the first Azerbaijani team to reach the group stages of the UEFA Champions League. They were drawn in Group C alongside Chelsea, Atlético Madrid and Roma, where they managed to obtain two points in six games after two draws and four losses.

In July and August 2021, Qarabağ secured their first participation in the group stage of UEFA Europa Conference League. Qarabağ knocked-out Ashdod (0–0 and 1–0), AEL Limassol (1–1 and 1–0) and Aberdeen (1–0 and 3–1) in the qualifiers. On 27 August, Qarabağ was drawn on Group H of the 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League alongside Basel, Kairat and Omonia. They eventually placed 2nd in the group, making it to the Knockout Play-off Round. 

In the 2023–24 season Qarabağ made it to the Europa League group stage where they finished 2nd behind Bayer Leverkusen. Qarabağ were subsequently drawn against Braga in the knockout round play-off. The first leg ended as a 4–2 victory for Qarabağ. The second leg would finish 2–0 to Braga after normal time, but ultimately ended 3–2 to the Portuguese side after extra time, which meant Qarabağ won 6–5 on aggregate, and thus became the first ever team from Azerbaijan to reach the round of 16 in any UEFA club competition. The round of 16 draw pitted them against Bayer Leverkusen, whom they had already played earlier in the group stages. The club tied with Bayer Leverkusen 2–2 in the first leg at home but were knocked out in the second leg following two stoppage times goals from Patrik Schick, ending the game 3–2.

== Stadium ==
The club have previously used Guzanli Olympic Stadium, which is situated in Quzanlı, the most populous municipality in the Agdam Rayon of Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan. The Imarat Stadium which was club&#x27;s original home stadium was destroyed as a result of artillery attacks from Armenian military forces during the First Nagorno-Karabakh War.

In 2012, the construction of a new football stadium Azersun Arena was announced, which was opened in June 2015. Azersun Arena is a multi-use football stadium in Surakhani settlement of Baku, Azerbaijan. It is currently used as the club&#x27;s Azerbaijan Premier League home stadium and holds 5,800 people.

The Baku Olympic Stadium and Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium is used for UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League games, where the record attendance for Qarabağ occurred on 27 September 2017, in a UEFA Champions League group stage match attended by 67,200 fans against Roma.

On 21 December 2023, Qarabağ played the 2023–24 Azerbaijan Cup match against MOIK Baku at Khankendi Stadium, Khankendi, making it the first match played in Karabakh Economic Region after the end of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War.

==Supporters==
Although a large part of Qarabağ&#x27;s support is drawn from the local Aghdam population, they remain immensely well supported in the rest of Azerbaijan. This is mainly due to their being the only team to represent the war-torn Nagorno-Karabakh region in the league. The club is a sole remnant of the past and a living symbol of hope and pride for over half a million Azerbaijani internally displaced people. In recent years, thanks to achievements on the pitch, the club has been able to inspire and initiate special youth projects enforcing stability and development in the IDP-settlements near the border of Nagorno-Karabakh.

The club have few supporting groups such as Imarat, Qarabağ Ordusu, Boys Qarabağ, and Ladies of Qarabağ. These groups often receive free tickets to Qarabağ&#x27;s games, which helps Karabakh to have more support from fans.

==Crest and colours==

The crest on the club emblem is the symbol of the Karabakh. It is produced by English designers and based on the Karabakh horse. The horse stems from the club&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Horsemen&quot;; although it was included on club programmes and scarves earlier, the crest was not displayed on the shirt until 2004. After Gurban Gurbanov&#x27;s appointment, Qarabağ&#x27;s attractive style of play led fans to call the team &quot;Qafqazın Barselonası&quot; (&quot;Barcelona of The Caucasus&quot;), which plays upon Barcelona&#x27;s success in Europe. The club is sometimes called &quot;Qaçqın Klub&quot; (&quot;The Refugee Club&quot;) after its conservative position on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and refugee problem in Azerbaijan.

===Shirt sponsors and kit manufacturers===
Qarabağ&#x27;s traditional kit alludes to the club&#x27;s location in Nagorno-Karabakh with the black and white representing light and darkness respectively. The club&#x27;s kits are manufactured by Adidas and sponsored by Azersun, a Baku-based food producing company.

In October 2020, amid the Nagorno-Karabakh war, the Armenian Football Federation called for sanctions against Qarabağ after the club&#x27;s PR and media manager Nurlan Ibrahimov posted a hate message on a social media network calling to &quot;kill all the Armenians, old and young, without distinction&quot;. UEFA announced a temporary suspension of the club&#x27;s official from any football-related activity for &quot;racist and other discriminatory conduct” targeting Armenians. Qarabag issued a statement saying Ibrahimov had been traumatised by watching the news of the Ganja and Barda missile attacks, while also urging its employees to &quot;refrain from such sharing in this sensitive period, adhere to the principles of humanism and fully comply with the laws of our state&quot;. Ibrahimov was punished in an administrative manner for the calls he made expressing cruelty against another nation and inciting national, racial or religious hatred while behaving emotionally on social network. On November 26, UEFA officially banned the Qarabag official for life and fined the club €100,000. Shortly after the UEFA sanction, Ibrahimov was declared wanted in Armenia.

<text>Noah Haynes Swayne (December 7, 1804 – June 8, 1884) was an American jurist and politician. He was the first Republican appointed as a justice to the United States Supreme Court.

==Early life==
Swayne was born in Frederick County, Virginia in the uppermost reaches of the Shenandoah Valley, approximately northwest of Washington D.C. He was the youngest of nine children of Joshua Swayne and Rebecca (Smith) Swayne. He was a descendant of Francis Swayne, who emigrated from England in 1710 and settled near Philadelphia. After his father died in 1809, Noah was educated locally until enrolling in Jacob Mendendhall&#x27;s Academy in Waterford, Virginia, a respected Quaker school 1817–18. He began to study medicine in Alexandria, Virginia, but abandoned this pursuit after his teacher Dr. George Thornton died in 1819. Despite his family having no money to support his continued education, he read law under John Scott and Francis Brooks in Warrenton, Virginia, and was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1823. A devout Quaker (and to date the only Quaker to serve on the Supreme Court), Swayne was deeply opposed to slavery, and in 1824 his abolitionist sentiments caused him to leave Virginia for the free state of Ohio.

He began a private practice in Coshocton and, in 1825, was elected Coshocton County Attorney. Four years later he was elected to the Ohio state legislature. In 1830 he was appointed U.S. Attorney for Ohio by Andrew Jackson, and moved to Columbus to take up the new position.

While serving as U.S. Attorney, Swayne was elected in 1834 to the Columbus City Council, and in 1836 to the Ohio House of Representatives. As U.S. Attorney, Swayne became close friends with Supreme Court justice John McLean. McLean, by the end of his career, was a strong Republican, and when the party was formed in 1855 Swayne had become an early member and political organizer.

In 1835, as escalating tensions in the boundary dispute between Ohio and Michigan Territory (the Toledo War) threatened to erupt into violent conflict, Ohio Governor Robert Lucas dispatched Swayne, along with former Congressman William Allen and David T. Disney, to Washington D.C. to confer with President Andrew Jackson. The delegation presented Ohio&#x27;s case and urged the President to act swiftly to address the situation.

==Supreme Court service==
John McLean was one of two dissenters in the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; case. He sought the Republican nomination for President in 1860, losing to Abraham Lincoln. However, he recommended to Lincoln on a number of occasions that Swayne be nominated to replace him on the court. This proved timely; McLean died in April 1861, shortly after Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration. As the American Civil War began, Swayne campaigned for the vacant seat, lobbying several Ohio members of Congress for their support. As the Oyez Project notes: &quot;Swayne satisfied Lincoln&#x27;s criteria for appointment: commitment to the Union, slavery opponent, geographically correct.&quot;

It is also believed that Swayne had represented fugitive slaves in court. So nine months after McLean&#x27;s death, Swayne was nominated, on January 21, 1862. The nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 24, 1862, with Swayne receiving his commission the same day. Three days later, on January 27, he took the judicial oath, thereby becoming the 35th justice of the Supreme Court.

In &quot;United States v. Rhodes&quot;, 1 Abb. U.S. 28 (C.C.D.Ky. 1867), Justice Swayne, riding on circuit, upheld the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 under the authority of the Thirteenth Amendment. He wrote,

In the &quot;Slaughterhouse Cases&quot;, 83 U.S. 36 (1873) – a pivotal decision on the meaning of Section 1 of the relatively new Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution—Swayne dissented with justices Stephen Johnson Field and Joseph Bradley. Field&#x27;s dissent was important, and presaged later decisions broadening the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, four years later Swayne joined the majority in &quot;Munn v. Illinois&quot;, with Field still dissenting.

Swayne&#x27;s potential judicial greatness failed to materialize. He was the first of President Lincoln&#x27;s five appointments to the Supreme Court; the other four were: Samuel Freeman Miller and David Davis, both in 1862; Stephen Johnson Field, in 1863; and Salmon P. Chase, as chief justice, in 1864. He is also said to have been &quot;the weakest&quot; of the five. His main distinction was his staunch judicial support of the president&#x27;s war measures: the Union blockade (&quot;Prize Cases&quot;, 67 U.S. 635 (1862)); issuance of paper money (&quot;i.e.&quot;, greenbacks in the &quot;Legal Tender Cases&quot;); and support for the presidential prerogative to declare martial law (&quot;Ex Parte Milligan&quot;, 71 U.S. 2 (1866)).

He is most famous for his majority opinion in &quot;Springer v. United States&quot;, 102 U.S. 586 (1881), which upheld the Federal income tax imposed under the Revenue Act of 1864.

In &quot;Gelpcke v. City of Dubuque&quot;, 68 U.S. 175 (1864), Swayne wrote the majority opinion, repudiating a claim that the Iowa constitution could impair legal obligations to bondholders. When contracts are made on the basis of trust in past judicial decisions those contracts could not be impaired by any subsequent construction of the law. &quot;We shall never immolate truth, justice, and the law, because a state tribunal has erected the altar and decreed the sacrifice.&quot; According to Lurie, he strongly supported &quot;the contractual rights of railroad bond holders, even in the face of repudiation sanctioned both by the Iowa state legislature and state supreme court. Obligations sacred to law are not to be destroyed simply because &#x27;a state tribunal has erected the altar and decreed the sacrifice.&#x27;&quot; For a later decision on impairment of contracts, &quot;compare&quot; &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;, 198 U.S. 45 (1905).

Swayne remained on the court until 1881, twice lobbying unsuccessfully to be elevated to the position of chief justice (after the death of Roger Taney in 1864 and Salmon Chase in 1873).

After his retirement, Swayne returned to Ohio.

==Retirement, death and legacy==

Swayne is not regarded as a particularly distinguished justice. He wrote few opinions, usually signing on to opinions written by others, and remained on the court well past his physical prime, being quite infirm at his retirement. Under pressure from President Rutherford B. Hayes, he finally agreed to retire on the condition that his friend and fellow Ohio attorney Stanley Matthews replace him.

His son, Wager Swayne, served in the American Civil War, rose to the rank of Major General, served as the military governor of Alabama after the Civil War, and subsequently founded law firms in Toledo, Ohio and New York City. Wager&#x27;s son, named Noah Hayes Swayne after his grandfather, was president of Burns Brothers, the largest coal distributor in the U.S. when he retired in September 1932. Another of Wager&#x27;s sons, Alfred Harris Swayne, was vice president of General Motors Corporation.

Another of Justice Swayne&#x27;s sons, Noah Swayne, was a lawyer in Toledo and donated the land for Swayne Field, the former field for the Toledo Mud Hens baseball team.

After his death in 1884, Justice Swayne is buried at the Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Chief Justice Edward Douglass White and justice-designate Edwin M. Stanton (President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s nomination of Stanton was confirmed by the Senate, but Stanton died before he could be sworn in) are also buried there.

A collection of Swayne&#x27;s legal papers, pre-dating his service as a Justice, is housed at the Ohio Historical Society, and correspondence with him is also located at other repositories.

<doc id="827827" wikidata="Q221752" url="?curid=827827" title="F91 Dudelange">
<text>F91 Dudelange (; , ) is a Luxembourgish professional football club based in Dudelange which plays in the Luxembourg National Division.

It was formed in 1991 as a merger between three teams in the town: Alliance Dudelange, Stade Dudelange and US Dudelange. Domestically, it has since won the National Division on 15 occasions and the Luxembourg Cup eight times.

F91 Dudelange qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League, becoming the first club from the country to reach the group stage of a European competition. Dudelange also made the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League group stage where they became the first team from Luxembourg to win a game in the group stage after a shock 4–3 victory over APOEL of Cyprus.

==History==

It was formed in 1991 from the clubs Alliance Dudelange, Stade Dudelange, and US Dudelange. All three clubs had won the National Division or the Luxembourg Cup before, but each had fallen upon hard times, and the amalgamated club was expected to be more stable, in both a sporting and financial sense.

Turning the club into a title-challenging team took a while. Stade Dudelange and US Dudelange had been in Luxembourg&#x27;s third tier (the 1. Division), whilst Alliance Dudelange was struggling to remain in the second league (the Division of Honour). The new club would take Alliance&#x27;s place in the Division of Honour in the 1991–92 season.

F91 was promoted in its first season, and soon established itself as a competent top-flight team, not finishing outside the top half of the table until 1996–97. Towards the end of the 1990s, Dudelange gradually improved, and brought to an end Jeunesse Esch&#x27;s era of dominance by storming to the 1999–00 league title by eleven points.

In 2004–05, Dudelange won the title and competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 2005–06 season. In the competition Dudelange became the first club in Luxembourg&#x27;s history to reach the second qualifying round, after a remarkable victory over NK Zrinjski (they lost 0–1 at home in the first leg, in the second leg they scored a goal in the 3rd minute of stoppage time to equalize on aggregate, and then scored 3 more goals in extra time). However, Dudelange were easily beaten by Rapid Wien in the second qualifying round.

In the 2005–06 season, Dudelange completed the league and cup Double for the first time since the merger. They replicated this feat in the 2006–07 season, and won a fourth consecutive National Division title in 2007–08.

In the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, F91 Dudelange defeated Tre Penne 11–0 on aggregate, earning them an appointment with Austrian champion Red Bull Salzburg in the second round. They defeated Salzburg 1–0 in Luxemburg, and lost 3–4 in Salzburg, to win the tie on the away goal rule. For the first time in club history, Dudelange qualified for the third round of the competition, in which they were beaten 5–1 on aggregate by Maribor.

In 2013–14, Dudelange reclaimed the title with a 3–0 victory over Fola Esch on the final day of the season. This earned the club a spot in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League.

In 2018, F91 Dudelange became the first Luxembourgish team to reach the group stage of a major European competition, after defeating CFR Cluj 5–2 on aggregate in the UEFA Europa League play-off round. Due to Dudelange&#x27;s apparent underdog status, daily newspaper &quot;Gazeta Sporturilor&quot; regarded CFR&#x27;s elimination as &quot;the biggest shame in the history of Romanian football&quot;. Dudelange had also previously defeated Polish side Legia Warsaw in the third qualifying round. The men from the Grand Duchy were drawn into a &#x27;Group of Death&#x27;, containing European powerhouses Milan, Olympiakos and Spanish side Real Betis. The Luxembourgers did, however, managed to pick up a famous and hard-fought point, on the last matchday, when they drew 0–0 against Real Betis at the Stade Josy Barthel.

In 2019, Dudelange qualified for the Europa League group stages for the second successive season after defeating FC Ararat-Armenia in the play-off round in a penalty shootout.

Dudelange fared much better in their second European group stage adventure, being drawn into a group with Europa League stalwarts Sevilla, Cypriot champions APOEL and Qarabağ of Azerbaijan.

On the first group stage matchday, on 19 September 2019, Dudelange became the first ever team from Luxembourg to win a game in a European group stage after beating APOEL 4–3 in Nicosia. Dudelange, whose coach Emilio Ferrera had resigned only two days prior, came back from a 3–2 deficit to defeat the Cypriots.

After losing their next four group matches, Dudelange faced Qarabag on the last matchday in Baku where they came within two minutes of recording another famous win, before the Azeri side equalised in injury time, thus the men from Luxembourg finished bottom of the group with a respectable 4 points.

<text>Panevėžio Ekranas is a Lithuanian football club, from the city of Panevėžys. It won 7 top-tier champion and 5 national cup titles throughout its existence.

==History==
The club was founded in 1964 and for 24 years competed in the top tier of Lithuanian football. However, at the end of 2014 season the club ran into financial difficulties, failed to meet admission criteria to A Lyga for the 2015 season and was subsequently declared bankrupt. A new club FK Panevėžys was formed to represent the city of Panevėžys, which managed to pass licensing criteria for the 2015 I Lyga season. FK Ekranas was declared bankrupt in 2016. In 2020 FK Ekranas was restored. They&#x27;re currently at the 2nd tier of Lithuanian football.

FK Ekranas won Lithuanian championships in 1985 (Soviet Lithuania), 1993, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Lithuanian Cup in 1985 (Soviet Lithuania), 1998, 2000, 2010 and 2011 and the Lithuanian Super Cup in 1998, 2006, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

On 5 November 2004, before the A Lyga champion-deciding match against FBK Kaunas, the club was controversially expelled from the top division by the National Football Club Association (NFKA) for alleged match fixing, but reinstated a day later.

In August 2006 FK Ekranas won the first Baltic Champion&#x27;s Cup tournament in Liepāja after beating Estonian champions TVMK Tallinn 6–4 and drawing with the home side Liepājas Metalurgs 1–1.

In 2015, the club filed for bankruptcy and was dissolved following the unsuccessful attempts to save the team.

<text>Llangrannog (; sometimes spelt as Llangranog) is a village and community in Ceredigion, Wales, southwest of New Quay. It lies in the narrow valley of the River Hawen, which falls as a waterfall near the middle of the village. Llangrannog is on the Wales Coast Path.

==Demographics==

=== Population ===
According to the 2011 census, Llangrannog&#x27;s population was 775. This was a 2.6% decrease since the 796 people noted in 2001. It is estimated that Llangrannog&#x27;s population decreased further to 759 in 2019.

=== Welsh language ===
The 2011 census showed 46.5% of the town&#x27;s population could speak Welsh, a fall from 51.8% in 2001.

==Geography==
The large rock between Llangrannog and Cilborth Beaches is Carreg Bica, a stack of Ordovician rock weathered by the sea, one of many along the coastline. A large piece of Carreg Bica fell away some years ago.
Llangrannog&#x27;s beach has received Blue Flag beach status. An RNLI lifeguard service is provided. Two streams flow down the beach to the sea - the Hawen and the smaller Nant Eisteddfa. There is a waterfall on the Hawen, known as Y Gerwn. Located within the community is the tiny island of Ynys Lochtyn.

==Legend==

According to legend, &quot;Carreg Bica&quot; (trans: Bica&#x27;s rock)the large sea-weathered stack of Ordovician rock on the beachis the tooth of the giant &quot;Bica&quot;. He lived in Ceredigion and was forced to spit his tooth onto the beach when suffering a bad toothache.

==Notable people==
* Sarah Jane Rees (1839–1916), was born in Llangrannog and is buried in the church yard. A precocious child, by the age of 15 she had learned navigation from her sea captain father and went on to obtain her Masters Certificate. She taught navigation in a school she founded to help local seamen better themselves. In 1865 she won the crown in the Aberystwyth National Eisteddfod under the bardic name of Cranogwen. She became a popular lay-preacher and eventually gave up school teaching to concentrate on preaching and on establishing the South Wales Women&#x27;s Temperance Union in 1901 to counter the harm done by alcohol among the working classes.
* Edward Elgar (1857–1934), once spent a holiday in Llangrannog. 
* Christopher Williams RBA (1873–1934), a Welsh artist, visited and painted here. His painting &quot;Holidays - Village Girls at Llangrannog&quot; is in the collection of the National Library of Wales.
* Dylan Thomas (1914–1953), visited Llangrannog whilst he was living in New Quay in 1944–45. He came to the Ship Inn with Tommy Herbert, the Aberaeron vet, and with Ira Jones, the World War One fighter ace.
* T. Llew Jones (1915 in Pentrecwrt – 2009), a Welsh language author.
* J. Geraint Jenkins (1929–2009), a Welsh maritime historian and historian of rural crafts.

<text>An ecosystem engineer is any species that creates, significantly modifies, maintains or destroys a habitat. These organisms can have a large impact on species richness and landscape-level heterogeneity of an area. As a result, ecosystem engineers are important for maintaining the health and stability of the environment they are living in. Since all organisms impact the environment they live in one way or another, it has been proposed that the term &quot;ecosystem engineers&quot; be used only for keystone species whose behavior very strongly affects other organisms.

==Types==
Jones et al. identified two different types of ecosystem engineers:

===Allogenic engineers===

Allogenic engineers modify the biophysical environment by mechanically changing living or nonliving materials from one form to another. Beavers are the original model for ecosystem engineers; in the process of clearcutting and damming, beavers alter their ecosystem extensively. The addition of a dam will change both the distribution and the abundance of many organisms in the area. Caterpillars are another example in that by creating shelters from leaves, they are also creating shelters for other organisms which may occupy them either simultaneously or subsequently. An additional example may be that of woodpeckers or other birds who create holes in trees for them to nest in. Once these birds are through with them, the holes are used by other species of birds or mammals for housing.

===Autogenic engineers===

Autogenic engineers modify the environment by modifying themselves. Trees are an example of this; as they grow, their trunks and branches create habitats for other living things, which may include squirrels, birds or insects. In the tropics, lianas connect trees, which allow many animals to travel exclusively through the forest canopy.

==Importance==
Being able to identify ecosystem engineers in an environment can be important when looking at the influence these individuals may have over other organisms living in the same environment – especially in terms of resource availability. It&#x27;s also vital to recognize that ecosystem engineers are not organisms that directly provide others with living or dead tissue. In other words, they are identified as engineers because of their ability to modify resources, not because of their trophic effect. While the impact of ecosystem engineers can be as great as keystone species, they differ in their types of impact. Keystone species are typically essential because of their trophic effect, while ecosystem engineers are not.

As with keystone species, ecosystem engineers are not necessarily abundant. Species with greater density and large per capita effect have a more easily-noticeable effect, but less abundant species can still have a large impact. A prime example is the mud shrimp &quot;Filhollianassa filholi&quot;, an ecosystem engineer with a small population density that nevertheless affects the temporal and spatial growth of macrofauna with its burrow structures.

The presence of some ecosystem engineers has been linked to higher species richness at the landscape level. By modifying the habitat, organisms like the beaver create more habitat heterogeneity and so can support species not found elsewhere. Thoughts may be that similar to other umbrella species by conserving an ecosystem engineer you may be able to protect the overall diversity of a landscape. Beavers have also been shown to maintain habitats in such a way as to protect the rare Saint Francis&#x27; satyr butterfly and increase plant diversity.

Biodiversity may also be affected by ecosystem engineer&#x27;s ability to increase the complexity of processes within an ecosystem, potentially allowing greater species richness and diversity in the local environments. As an example, beavers have the capacity to modify riparian forest and expand wetland habitats, which results in an increase of the diversity of the habitats by allowing a greater number of species to inhabit the landscape. Coral-reef habitats, created by the ecosystem engineer coral species, hold some of the highest abundances of aquatic species in the world.

== Controversy ==
There is controversy around the usage of the term &quot;ecosystem engineer&quot; to classify a species, as it can be perceived as a &quot;buzzword&quot; to the ecological science community. The use of the term &quot;ecosystem engineering&quot; might suggest that the species was intentionally and consciously modifying its environment. Another argument postulates that the ubiquity of ecosystem engineers translates to all species being ecosystem engineers. This would invite more ecological research to be done to delve into the classification of an ecosystem engineer. The generality and the specifications of identifying an ecosystem engineer has been the root of the controversy, and now more research is being conducted to definitively classify and categorize species based on their impact as an ecosystem engineer.

== Classification ==
Ecosystem engineers do have their general types, allogenic and autogenic, but further research has suggested that all organisms can fall under specific cases. It was proposed that there were six specific cases. These cases were differentiated by the species&#x27; ability to transform their resources to different states, as well as their ability to combat abiotic forces. A state refers to the physical condition of a material and a change in state refers to a physical abiotic or biotic material change

==Introduced species as ecosystem engineers==
Species are able to be transported across all parts of the world by humans or human-made vessels at boundless rates resulting in foreign ecosystem engineers changing the dynamics of species interactions and the possibility for engineering to occur in locations that would not have been accessible by engineers without the mediation by humans.

Introduced species, which may be invasive species, are often ecosystem engineers. Kudzu, a leguminous plant introduced to the southeast U.S., changes the distribution and number of animal and bird species in the areas it invades. It also crowds out native plant species. The zebra mussel is an ecosystem engineer in North America. By providing refuge from predators, it encourages the growth of freshwater invertebrates through increasing microhabitats. Light penetration into infected lakes also improves the ecosystem, resulting in an increase in algae. In contrast to the benefits some ecosystem engineers can cause, invasive species often have the reverse effect.

==Humans as ecosystem engineers==
Humans are thought to be the most dramatic ecosystem engineers. Niche construction has been prevalent since the earliest days of human activity. Through urban development, agricultural practices, logging, damming and mining, humans have changed the way they interact with the environment. 
This interaction is more studied in the field of human ecology. Considered both as an allogenic and autogenic engineers, humans do not necessarily fit into either category of ecosystem engineers. Humans are able to mimic autogenic effects as well as implement their own allogenic effects. Air-conditioning is one prime example of the way humans mimic autogenic effects

Due to the complexity of many communities and ecosystems, restoration projects are often difficult. Ecosystem engineers have been proposed as a means to restore a given area to its previous state. While ideally these would all be natural agents, with today&#x27;s level of development some form of human intervention may be necessary as well. In addition to being able to assist in restoration ecology, ecosystem engineers may be a helpful agent in invasive species management. New fields are developing which focus on restoring those ecosystems which have been disrupted or destroyed by human activities as well as developing ecosystems that are sustainable with both human and ecological values.

==Examples==

===Terrestrial environments===

Besides the previously mentioned beaver acting as an ecosystem engineer, other terrestrial animals do the same. This may be through feeding habits, migration patterns or other behaviors that result in more permanent changes.

Research has suggested primates as ecosystem engineers as a result of their feeding strategies – frugivory and folivory – making them act as seed dispersers. As a whole primates are very abundant and feed on a large quantity of fruit that is then distributed around their territory. Elephants have also been designated ecosystem engineers as they cause very large changes to their environment whether it be through feeding, digging or migratory behavior.

Prairie dogs are another terrestrial form of allogenic ecosystem engineers due to the fact that the species has the ability to perform substantial modifications by burrowing and turning soil. They are able to influence soils and vegetation of the landscape while providing underground corridors for arthropods, avians, other small mammals, and reptiles. This has a positive effect on species richness and diversity of their habitats which results in the prairie dogs being labelled as keystone species.

Arthropods can also be ecosystem engineers, such as spiders, ants, and many types of larvae that create shelters out of leaves, as well as gall-inducing insects that change the shapes of plants. Bark beetles are an ecosystem engineer of forest ecosystems and can affect fire spread and severity when attacking their host pine species.

Not only animals are ecosystem engineers. Fungi are able to connect regions that are distant from one another and translocate nutrients between them. Doing so they create nutritional niches for xylophagous invertebrates, supply trees with nitrogen translocated from previously predated animals or even form an &quot;underground pipeline&quot; that redistributes carbon between trees. Thus fungi are engineers controlling nutrient cycles in ecosystems.
===Marine environments===

In marine environments, filter feeders and plankton are ecosystem engineers because they alter turbidity and light penetration, controlling the depth at which photosynthesis can occur. This in turn limits the primary productivity of benthic and pelagic habitats and influences consumption patterns between trophic groups.

Another example of ecosystem engineers in marine environments would be scleractinian corals as they create the framework for the habitat most coral-reef organisms depend on. Some ecosystem engineers such as coral have help maintaining their environment. Parrotfish often help maintain coral reefs as they feed on macroalgae that competes with the coral. As this relationship is mutually beneficial, a positive feedback cycle is formed between the two organisms, making them both responsible for creating and maintaining coral reef ecosystems.

Whales are also being increasingly recognised for their role as ecosystem engineers despite the loss of up to 90% of their numbers during the commercial whaling era. Whales defecate at the surface and release nutrients that boost the growth of phytoplankton. As whales migrate across the oceans, and move up and down the water column, they help to spread these nutrients in a process that is known as the &quot;Whale Pump&quot;.

<text>Sanza is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Salerno in the Campania region of southern Italy.

==History==
It is a small town placed on a hill surrounded by mountains.
In ancient times it was protected by walls and there were few gates to access the village.

==Geography==
The town is bordered by Buonabitacolo, Casalbuono, Casaletto Spartano, Caselle in Pittari, Monte San Giacomo, Montesano sulla Marcellana, Piaggine, Rofrano, Sassano and Valle dell&#x27;Angelo.

Sanza counts the hamlets (&quot;frazioni&quot;) of San Donato and Varivertola. In the north-western area of its territory is located the mount Cervati.

==Feast Day==
Sanza&#x27;s biggest day of the year is August 5; a day in which all of its patrons pay homage to their other beloved saint, La Madonna Della Neve (Mary of the Snows.) In late July, a group of men carrying the heavy statue of La Madonna on their shoulders are followed by the people of Sanza as they ascend Monte Cervati (a nearby mountain in the Cilento region). The statue is then left in the small chapel at the very top. Then several days later, Sanza&#x27;s devoted people, ranging from young children, to old men and women with walking sticks, once again follow La Madonna&#x27;s descent back down the mountain. After a 26 kilometer journey ranging from around 2 or 3 am, up until when the people return, all those who had come down the mountain create a procession through the tight cobblestoned streets of Sanza, singing loudly and continuing to carry La Madonna.

<doc id="827842" wikidata="Q845772" url="?curid=827842" title="FK Partizani Tirana">
<text>Futboll Klub Partizani is an Albanian professional football club based in Tirana, that competes in the Kategoria Superiore. Founded in 1946, the club was historically affiliated to the Albanian army. Partizani&#x27;s home ground is the newly built stadium at Partizani Complex. The club also uses Arena Kombëtare also known as Air Albania stadium for matches in European competitions and major domestic football derbies in Albania.

The club first competed in an official competition in 1947 where they won the Albania National Championship, thus being crowned the champions of Albania in their debut season as well as the following two seasons. In total the club have been national champions on 17 occasions between 1947 and 2023, which is the last time the club won the Kategoria Superiore. They have won 18 other officially recognised domestic honours, including 15 Albanian Cups as well as Second Division. They are also the only Albanian club side to have won an international football competition through their 1970 Balkans Cup campaign in which they beat Bulgarian side Beroe Stara Zagora in the final.

==History==
===Foundation (1945–1946)===
FK Partizani Tirana was officially founded on 4 February 1946 soon after the end of World War II and the liberation of Albania. However, one year earlier in 1945, there had been two military division teams competing in the first National Championship following the end of World War II. The teams were called Ylli Shkodër and Liria Korçë, and they were both dissolved as clubs at the end of the season, with their best players moving to Tirana to join Ushtria, which literally translates to The Army. Ushtria played their first friendly game on 13 January 1946 against the reigning champions of Albania Vllaznia Shkodër, in a game that ended in a goalless draw in Tirana that was played during heavy rainfall. The team played their first ever match in distinctive red shirts with each player&#x27;s initials on their chests. The club&#x27;s first ever lineup was Alfred Bonati, Luga, Tepelia, Xhavit Shyqyri Demneri, Besim Fagu, Rexhepi, Lutfi Hoxha, Qamil Teliti, Kavaja, Hamdi Bakalli and Bylyku. The following month, on 4 February, Ushtria was developed into an organised sports club which was to be named in honour of the Albanian Partisans who had fought for the liberation of the country. In the early history of the club they recruited players from the Scanderbeg Military High School and Albanian Military Academy, as well as players from other clubs who were ordered by the ruling Communists to play for Partizani.

On 7 April the club played their first official match under the name Partizani, which was against another team from the same city 17 Nëntori Tirana. Partizani won the match 2–0 through the goals of Osman Pengili and Qamil Teliti, with a lineup consisting of Çobani, Tepeli, Muhamet Dibra, Besim Fagu, Kavaja, Osman Pengili, Lutfi Hoxha, Hivzi Sakiqi, Bylyku and Xhavit Shyqyri Demneri. As the club did not participate in the 1946 National Championship, they instead took a tour of Albania playing friendly games against some of the biggest clubs in the country at the time, and ended their 9 match tour with 26 goals scored and 9 against, and Qamil Teliti scoring 11 goals to make him the tour&#x27;s top goalscorer.

===Early dominance (1947–1964)===

Partizani first competed in a national competition in 1947, where they were enrolled into the top flight of Albanian football in their debut season and played 16 games, winning 14, drawing 1 and losing 1 as they went on to win the National Championship in their first competitive campaign. They finished on 29 points, just 1 ahead of Vllaznia Shkodër, who had won the previous 2 National Championships, and they had a goal difference of 41, after scoring 56 goals and conceding 16. The championship winning team was managed by Sllave Llambi, and was made up of Abdulla Stërmasi, Kamberi, Ramazan Njala, Besim Fagu, Medo Cuciqi, Sulejman Vathi, Xhavit Shyqyri Demneri, Hivzi Sakiqi, Isuf Pelingu, Tafil Baci, Lutfi Hoxha, Osman Pengili, Hamdi Tafmizi, Zihni Gjinali, Zef Gavoci, Eqrem Dauti, Zyber Lisi, Alush Merhori and Hamdi Bakalli, who was also the league&#x27;s top goalscorer with 7 goals. The following season the Albanian Football Association decided to change the format of the championship and divided teams into two groups based on geographical location, with Group A being a northern conference and Group B being a southern conference. Partizani were placed in Group A where they finished top of the group level on points with Vllaznia Shkodër, and due to possessing a better goal difference Partizani were the group winners and reached the championship final on 25 August 1947 against Flamurtari Vlorë. The final was played in Tirana and Partizani won with an emphatic 6–2 scoreline, following goals from Vasif Biçaku, Xhevdet Shaqiri and four goals from Zihni Gjinali to give Partizani their second consecutive title. Gjinali was also the league&#x27;s top goalscorer for the campaign, after finishing level on 11 goals with Flamurtari Vlorë forward Tish Daija, who also scored in the championship final. The Republic Cup also returned in 1948 and Partizani competed in the competition for the first time, and they also went on to win it following a 5–2 victory over local rivals 17 Nentori Tirana in the final which secured the first double in Albanian football. They retained the league title the following season following an undefeated campaign, and they also retained the cup as they defeated 17 Nentori Tirana 1–0 in the final.

Partizani finished the 1950 National Championship level on points with newly formed Interior Ministry team Dinamo Tirana, and despite having a superior goal difference the Albanian Football Association decided to award the title to Dinamo after using a strange mathematical calculation using goal statistics, which were 77:10 = 7.7 for Partizani and 60:6 = 10.0 for Dinamo. After losing out on the title to new local rivals Dinamo, Partizani also came runners up to them in the Republic Cup, which began a long period of football in Albania dominated by the two sides. The following season, the club finished as runners up to Dinamo in both the league and the cup, but 19 year old striker Refik Resmja managed to score 59 goals in 23 games for Partizani which gave him a 2.57 goalscoring average, a record that is considered to be the best ever in top flight football. 
Despite finishing level on points and with a greater goal difference than Dinamo during the 1952 campaign, the same strange mathematical calculation as in 1950 was used and the title was once again awarded to Dinamo. The following season they finished runners up in both the league and the cup to Dinamo, before winning the league title in 1954 which was their first trophy since 1949. The club also finished as runners up in the cup to Dinamo in the 1954 Republic Cup, before going off to compete in the third unofficial Championship of Communist Countries&#x27; Army Clubs held in Bulgaria, where they only managed to win 1 game and lose 3. They then finished as runners up again to Dinamo Tirana for the next 2 seasons, meaning Partizani won just 1 league title in the previous 7 years.

1957 marked the return of Partizani as the most dominant club in Albania, as they won the league and cup double, a feat they repeated once again in 1958 before competing in the first official Spartakiada, the Championship of Communist Countries&#x27; Army Clubs in East Germany. They defeated The Cong Hanoi of Vietnam, CCA București of Romania, Dukla Prague of Czechoslovakia and Vorwärts Berlin of East Germany to reach the final against CDNA Sofia of Bulgaria, who narrowly defeated Partizani 1–0 at the Leipzig Zentralstadion in front of 100,000 spectators. They returned to Albania with silver medals and used the experience to retain both the league and cup to complete consecutive doubles, and in 1959 they won just the league as the cup was not held that year. However, Dinamo won the double in 1960 as Partizani finished runners up in the league, but they completed the double themselves the following season and they became the first Albanian club to participate in a European competition in 1962, which occurred due to Albania&#x27;s Communist leader Enver Hoxha falling out with the Soviet Union in 1960, meaning the domestic league formats were changed in line with Europe&#x27;s and Albania no longer excluded themselves from competing in European competitions. Partizani faced Swedish champions IFK Norrköping in the first round of the UEFA European Cup and they lost the first leg 2–0 in Norrköping before earning a 1–1 draw in Tirana, where rocks were thrown onto the pitch at the end of the match which ended in a 3–1 aggregate loss for Partizani. During the 1962–63 campaign Partizani once again won the league title and they were then drawn against Bulgarian Spartak Plovdiv side in the European Cup, and they won their first European game in the first leg as they defeated Spartak Plovdiv 1–0 in Tirana, but they were eliminated after losing 3–1 in Plovdiv. The following season they completed the double, which would be their last of the communist era, and in December 1963, halfway through the season, Partizani competed in the third official Spartakiada, the second of which included football, held in Vietnam, and they defeated CDNA Sofia in a rematch of the previous final, as well as Budapest Honvéd of Hungary, and Vorwärts Berlin to reach the semi-finals where they defeated Budapest Honvéd once again to reach the final against a team from the Soviet Union consisting of players from CSKA Moscow and SKA Rostov-on-Don, where they lost 2–0 after extra time to finish as runners up in consecutive Spartakiads. They faced German side 1. FC Köln in the European Cup at the start of the following season, and they drew 0–0 in the first leg in Tirana, but lost 2–0 away in Cologne to lose the tie on aggregate. As Albania was a Stalinist state at the time, during the first leg the 1. FC Köln team was involved in a minor diplomatic incident arose when it was evident that the West Germans had brought their own food and a chef to cook it. 1. Köln&#x27;s administrator Julius Ukrainczyk eventually negotiated a compromise that saw the food allowed in but the chef sent home.

===Rise in opposition (1965–1993)===
After winning their 10th league title in 17 years, Partizani struggled to maintain their dominance at the top of Albanian football, as they finished as runners up in 4 of the next 5 seasons, but they did win 3 consecutive Republic Cups between 1965 and 1970, as the cup was not held for 2 years during this period. They competed in the 1968–69 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup where they were drawn against Italian side Torino, whom they defeated 1–0 in Tirana before losing 3–1 in Turin to lose 3–2 on aggregate. In 1970 they became the first ad only Albanian club to win an international competition, as they defeated Beroe Stara Zagora to win the regional 1970 Balkans Cup, following a 1–1 draw in Tirana and a 3–0 awarded win for the second leg, as Beroe withdrew. Partizani participated in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1970, and they faced Swedish side Åtvidabergs FF in the preliminary round where the drew 1–1 in Åtvidaberg before winning 2–0 in Tirana to earn the club its first European tie victory as they moved into the last 16 where they faced Austrian side Wacker Innsbruck. Partizani lost 3–2 in the first leg in Innsbruck despite being ahead 2–1 at half time, and they lost 2–1 in the return leg at home, which was their first European home loss in 6 games. They won the 1970–71 National Championship which was their first title since 1964, and they qualified for the first round of the European Cup where they lost 4–0 on aggregate to Bulgarian side CSKA Sofia. They once again failed to retain their title and struggled the following season, finishing 4th in the league and being knocked out of the cup in the semi-finals, before going on to win the cup during the 1972–73 season as well as finishing as runners up in the league. They finished as runners up the following season in both the league and cup, before failing to reach the final of the cup or finish in the top 2 of the league until 1979 which is when they managed to win their 11th league title ahead of local rivals KF Tirana. They then faced Scottish champions Celtic in the European Cup whom they defeated 1–0 in Tirana. Once again Albania&#x27;s communist regime made it difficult for foreign clubs to enter and play in Albania, and it took Celtic over 2 months to acquire visas for their players and staff and they were unable to acquire visas for press and a small number of supporters. The return leg ended in disappointment for Partizani as despite opening the scoring they lost 4–1, meaning they lost the tie 4–2 on aggregate.

Partizani once again failed to challenge for the title the following season, as they could only manage a 4th-place finish, but they won the cup after beating Labinoti Elbasan 2–1 on aggregate in the final. They qualified for the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and faced Swedish side Malmö FF whom they narrowly lost 1–0 on aggregate following a 1–0 loss in Malmö and a goalless draw in Tirana. The club won the 1980–81 National Championship ahead of Dinamo and KF Tirana, meaning they qualified for the European Cup where they faced Austrian side Austria Wien whom they lost 3–2 on aggregate to following a disappointing 3–1 first leg away loss and a 1–0 home win. The club had to wait until 1987 for their next trophy, which came in the shape of the National Championship which they won ahead of Flamurtari Vlorë. They faced Portuguese champions Benfica in an infamous first leg in Lisbon that saw Partizani lose 4–0 and end the game with 7 men as 4 players were sent off including goalkeeper and captain Perlat Musta. Partizani were punished by UEFA for the incidents, and they were knocked out of the competition following a walkover victory for Benfica in what would have been the second leg, and they were also banned from Europe for 4 years. Partizani finished 9th in the 1987–88 campaign, which was their lowest ever finish in the league and they also missed out on the cup as they lost in the final to Flamurtari Vlorë. They somewhat bounced back the following season as they finished as runners up in the league, a feat that was repeated for 4 seasons in a row. They competed in the UEFA Cup in 1990, where they lost to Romanian side Universitatea Craiova, and they also won the cup in 1991 after beating Flamurtari in the final. In the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup the following season, they narrowly lost 1–0 to Dutch side Feyenoord, whom they held to a 0–0 draw in Tirana before losing the tie to a late goal in Rotterdam.

The 1992–93 campaign proved to be last truly successful one for the club, as they managed to win their 7th double in their history. They won the Kategoria Superiore in a season where Edmond Dosti became Partizani&#x27;s first league top goalscorer since Agim Murati in 1979, and they won the Albanian Cup after defeating Albpetrol Patos in the final. After winning the double Partizani faced Icelandic side ÍA Akranes in the preliminary round of the European Cup. They earned a goalless draw in the first leg in Tirana before losing 3–0 in Akranes, where all 3 goals came in the second half. Following the fall of communism in Albania clubs struggled to support themselves financially and Partizani was also heavily reliant on the Albanian Army&#x27;s support along with the communist regime. The fall of communism made it difficult for Partizani to be sustainable as a club, which in turn caused the club problems for the next 20 years.

===Post-communist era (1993–2008)===
After winning the double in 1993 Partizani began to decline in terms of power, and the club was taken over by businessman Albert Xhani in 1994. Because Teuta Durrës had finished 2nd in the league and won the cup, Partizani were given a place in the UEFA Cup as the third-placed team, and they faced Turkish side Fenerbahçe in 1995, whom they lost 6–0 to on aggregate as they struggled against far superior opposition. Partizani continued to struggle to compete domestically with their only success coming in 1997 as they won the Albanian Cup. The club&#x27;s fortunes continued to worsen and they found themselves in bottom spot in the league and the club eventually experienced relegation for the first time in its history at the end of the 1999–00 season. The spent one season in the Albanian First Division, as they won the division title and earned promotion at the first attempt. During their first season back in the top flight they managed a respectable third-place finish which qualified them for the UEFA Cup, where they were drawn against Israeli side Hapoel Tel Aviv, whom they lost 5–1 to on aggregate as they failed to progress to the next round.
The following season they once again finished third and they also reached the quarter-finals of the Albanian Cup, as they qualified for the Intertoto Cup where they were once again drawn against Israeli opposition in Maccabi Netanya, to whom they lost 3–1 to in Netanya before winning the return leg in Tirana 2–0 against the odds to qualify for the next round of a European competition for only the second time. In the next round they faced Moldovan side Dacia Chișinău to whom they lost 5–0 on aggregate to, putting an end to their Intertoto Cup run. Domestically they managed a fourth-place finish, just one point behind Vllaznia Shkodër in third place, and they also won the Albanian Cup, which was the first major trophy by the club in 11 years, aside from the Albanian First Division. In the UEFA Cup the following season Partizani was drawn against Maltese side Birkirkara, whom they beat 4–2 in the first leg in Tirana, and despite losing 2–1 in the away leg they managed to qualify for the next round where they faced Israeli side Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin who defeated Partizani 6–1 on aggregate to eliminate them, following 3–0 and 3–1 away and home losses, respectively. During the 2004–05 campaign Partizani struggled in the league and they finished third from bottom, although they were not in real danger of being relegated as they finished 22 points away from the relegation zone. In the cup they narrowly lost out to eventual winners Teuta Durrës in the semi-finals, as they lost out on the away goal rule following a 2–2 aggregate draw. The following season performances improved and they finished fourth, just 2 points behind local rivals KF Tirana in second place, as they also reached the quarter-finals of the cup. They qualified for the Intertoto Cup once again, where they faced Cypriot side Ethnikos Achna who Partizani defeated 2–1 in Tirana but lost 4–2 to in Achnas to lose 5–4 on aggregate. The 2006–07 campaign saw the club finish fourth once again, and they also missed out on reaching the final of the Albanian Cup on the away goal rule after a 1–1 aggregate draw with Teuta Durrës. The following season Partizani challenged for the title with local rivals Dinamo Tirana, but they were unable to win the league and they eventually finished 5 points away from Dinamo as they finished as runners up for the 19th time.

===Downfall and revival (2008–present)===
After a strong season, Partizani qualified the UEFA Cup and faced Bosnian side Široki Brijeg in the first qualifying round, but they eventually lost 3–1 on aggregate which was the start to what would prove to be a very difficult season, as they struggled in the league and avoided the automatic relegation zone by a single goal on goal difference. They did however face Kastrioti Krujë in a relegation play-out that led to Partizani&#x27;s relegation once again, in a game that was marred by poor refereeing decisions as well as violence. Partizani began the 2009–10 campaign in the Albanian First Division and the club&#x27;s president Albert Xhani began to withdraw from backing the club financially, which meant that the majority of wages were not paid for the season and during the winter break Paro Laci and Lulëzim Sallaku bought out 40% and 10% of the club&#x27;s shares, respectively, with Xhani retaining the remaining 50%. Laci took control of the majority of the club&#x27;s finances, and wages were paid to the staff and the players, but despite push for promotion they were unable to reach the play off places and finished the league in 4th place. The 2010–11 season would prove to be the worst in the club&#x27;s history as they experienced relegation to the Albanian Second Division, the third tier, for the first time, as they were relegated for the 2nd time in 2 years. The club finished bottom of the First Division table, with a record of 4 wins, 5 draws and 21 losses, scoring a total of just 16 goals in 30 games. During the first and only season in the Second Division, Partizani managed to finish top of Group B by a single point, which guaranteed their promotion and their qualification to the championship final against Tërbuni Pukë on 17 May 2012, which ended in a 3–1 loss for Partizani. The club&#x27;s return to the First Division would prove to be a successful one as they finished as runners up behind KF Lushnja to achieve back to back promotion, in a season that saw the club change ownership as Gazment Demi bought out 50% of the club&#x27;s shares in January 2013, making him and Lulëzim Sallaku co-owners and co-financiers of the club. The club achieved promotion back into the Kategoria Superiore following a four-year absence and Demi took over as president following the departure of Sallaku from the post.

After 5 seasons of winning nothing in the Kategoria Superiore, Partizani won its first title in 26 years, under coach Skënder Gega, and return to UEFA Champions League after 3 years of absence.

==Stadium==
During the club&#x27;s early history they played their home games at Albania&#x27;s main stadium, the Qemal Stafa Stadium which was shared with local rivals KF Tirana and then also Dinamo Tirana. A second stadium was built in Tirana in 1956, which was the Selman Stërmasi Stadium, and this stadium was also shared by the three main Tirana clubs. The club stopped sharing the Selman Stërmasi Stadium in 2014 when they were promoted back to the Kategoria Superiore, and in the summer of 2016 the process of demolishing the Qemal Stafa Stadium will begin, in order to facilitate the proposed 22,500-seater Arena Kombëtare.

 On 9 March 2016, the Albanian government agreed to a 99-year, €1 lease of the Military Base 4030, located on Myslym Keta Road on the outskirts of Tirana, which is where Partizani will build their new training complex as well as their proposed 4,500 seater stadium.

Tirana&#x27;s mayor, in a meeting with FK Partizani and FK Tirana, granted Partizani the right to play in Tirana&#x27;s stadium until &quot;Qemal Stafa Stadium&quot; is finished building.

In 2019, Partizani moved to the newly built Arena Kombëtare. On 13 December 2019, they played first match at the new stadium against rivals KF Tirana, which also plays some matches at the stadium. They lost the match 2–1 with a Winful Cobbinah goal at the last minute of the match, which was the first loss for the club in the derbies after 5 years and 8 months and after 18 games.

==Supporters==
===Ultras Guerrils===
Partizani Tirana&#x27;s current supporters group and hooligans firm is called Ultras Guerrils 08–09, who were founded following the merger of two other supports groups, Brigada e Kuqe 08 and Komandos Ultras. They are one of the most numerous and consistent supporters in Albania, attending the team&#x27;s Albanian Second Division matches. Despite their history, name and colours they aren&#x27;t affiliated with any political party. Partizani has a lot of supporter abroad Albania, such as Kosovo-Albanians and also a lot of Macedonian Albanians

===Rivalries===

The club&#x27;s biggest rivalry is with KF Tirana. The Tirana derby is the name given to any football match contested between Partizani Tirana and KF Tirana football clubs, the two biggest rivals in Tirana in Albania. Partizani Tirana have a historical advantage of 25 wins ahead of KF Tirana in the League with 67 wins. Also the team recorded the best ever result in the match which still remains as 8-0 from 1947. The other main rivalry in the city is with Dinamo Tirana.

<doc id="827848" wikidata="Q2613366" url="?curid=827848" title="Ulster Bank">
<text>Ulster Bank () is a large retail bank, and one of the traditional Big Four Irish clearing banks. The Ulster Bank Group was subdivided into two separate legal entities: National Westminster Bank Plc, trading as Ulster Bank (registered in England and Wales and operating in Northern Ireland); and, until April 2023, Ulster Bank Ireland DAC (registered in the Republic of Ireland). Prior to the closure of Ulster Bank in the Republic of Ireland in April 2023, the headquarters of Ulster Bank in the Republic of Ireland were located on George&#x27;s Quay, Dublin, whilst the headquarters of Ulster Bank Northern Ireland are in Donegall Square East, Belfast, and it maintains a large sector of the financial services in both the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

Established in 1836, Ulster Bank was acquired by the London County and Westminster Bank in 1917. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of National Westminster Bank (NatWest), it became part of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group in 2000. RBS Group was renamed NatWest Group in 2020. However, the Ulster Bank brand is used on the island of Ireland. The bank has 146 branches in the Republic of Ireland and 90 in Northern Ireland, with over 1,200 non-charging ATMs. It has over 3,000 employees and over 1.9 million clients.

On 19 February 2021, NatWest Group announced a phased withdrawal of all banking activity and associated services within the Republic of Ireland. On 3 May 2021, the business of Ulster Bank Limited in Northern Ireland was transferred to the parent National Westminster Bank as part of a court-approved Banking Business Transfer Scheme. Ulster Bank ceased its operations in the Republic of Ireland on 21 April 2023. From 2014 to 2023, it had been designated as a Significant Institution under European Banking Supervision and thus directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

==History==
===19th century===

Ulster Bank was founded as The Ulster Banking Company in Belfast, Ulster, in 1836, by a breakaway faction of shareholders in the newly formed National Bank of Ireland, which had been founded in 1835, who objected to the latter bank&#x27;s plan to invest profits from the bank in London rather than in Belfast. The founding directors of the bank were John Heron, Robert Grimshaw, John Currell, who was a linen bleacher from Ballymena, and James Steen, a Belfast pork curer.

Ulster bank opened for business on 1 July 1836 on Waring Street, Belfast. It issued its own banknotes from the outset. Within a year, it opened branches at Antrim, Armagh, Ballymoney, Comber, Downpatrick, Enniskillen, Lurgan, Portadown and Tandragee. In the following two decades, it opened eleven more branches throughout the nine counties of Ulster.

In 1860, Ulster bank opened a new head office on Waring Street, Belfast, together with branches in Sligo and in Ardee, Co. Louth. In 1862, it opened an office at College Green, Dublin. Over the following twelve years, it opened another 24 branches. It established a limited liability company in 1883, named Ulster Bank Ltd. It opened further branches in Dublin, on Baggot Street and Camden Street, and moved to a new premises on College Green in 1891.

===20th century===

In the early 1900s, Ulster Bank opened branches in Wexford, Dún Laoghaire, Cork, Waterford and Limerick. It was acquired by the London County and Westminster Bank in 1917, but retained its separate identity.

In the 1960s, Ulster Bank opened branches in the suburbs of Belfast and Dublin, together with branches in airports. It introduced ATMs.

On 16 May 1968, Ulster Bank announced that the administration of its lending activities in the Republic of Ireland would be moved from Belfast to Dublin. In 1968, Ulster Bank&#x27;s parent bank (by then named Westminster Bank) amalgamated with National Provincial Bank to form National Westminster Bank.

In the 1970s, Ulster Bank introduced mobile banks in some rural areas. It moved to a new head office on Donegall Place, Belfast. In 1975, Ulster Bank acquired the Irish interests of Lombard Bank and North Central Finance. It adopted the slogan &quot;the friendly bank&quot;.

In 1980, Ulster Bank introduced the &quot;Henri Hippo&quot; money box and savings plan for schoolchildren. In 1989, it launched the Ulster Bank Visa card.

During the 1990s, Ulster Bank installed ATMs at non-branch locations and had the largest network of ATMs in Ireland by 1995. It introduced the Switch debit card and continued to expand its branch network throughout the 1990s. In 1997, it opened its new head offices at George&#x27;s Quay, Dublin.

===21st century===

In 2000, Ulster Bank opened a new office at Donegall Square East, Belfast. Its parent, National Westminster Bank, was acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland group in 2000. In 2001, Ulster Bank&#x27;s banking business in the Republic of Ireland was transferred to Ulster Bank Ireland Ltd in accordance with Irish law.

In 2002, three Ulster Bank employees were arrested on charges of theft and money laundering. The three were responsible for the destruction of old banknotes at the bank&#x27;s former Waring Street cash centre. Between November 2001 and February 2002, they were accused of stealing approximately UK£900,000 of used banknotes designated for disposal. The money was then placed in various bank and building society accounts. On 23 January 2004, the men were jailed for two and a half years for the theft of £770,000. Lord Chief Justice Sir Brian Kerr criticised the bank&#x27;s security measures during the trial.

In 2003, Ulster Bank Group purchased First Active, Ireland&#x27;s oldest building society, for €887 million, with First Active retaining its separate identity. In 2005, Ulster Bank&#x27;s logo was changed to the &quot;daisy wheel&quot; of Royal Bank of Scotland. In 2009, the First Active branch network and business of several hundred thousand savers and borrowers was merged with Ulster Bank, and the brand name was retired in 2010.

In 2011, Ulster Bank brought the struggling County Down development The Outlet, Ulster Bank later sold the shopping outlet to Lotus Property in 2016.

In June 2012, a computer system failure prevented customers from accessing accounts. Initial estimates that the problem would be sorted out within a week were wildly optimistic, with thousands of customers still unable to access their accounts into late July 2012, with ongoing issues still not resolved by mid-August 2012. This RBS / NatWest / Ulster Bank issue has proved to be one of the largest IT failures the world has ever known. Ulster Bank (the smallest part of the RBS group) was to initially set aside £28 million for compensation to customers.

In 2015, the Central Bank of Ireland opened an investigation into the lenders which sold tracker mortgages, finding Ulster Bank, KBC Bank Ireland, Permanent TSB, Bank of Ireland and AIB had denied their customers the correct rates. It transpired that in the Republic of Ireland from 2008, Ulster Bank Ireland dac had encouraged customers on tracker mortgages to switch to the more-profitable fixed rate mortgages as interest rates on tracker mortgages, which is set to the European Central Bank borrowing rate plus 1%, reduced significantly due to the 2008 financial crisis. As part of this, mortgage customers were not told about the risks of moving to a fixed rate, and were instead encouraged with the offer of constant mortgage repayments and interest. Other customers were offered a temporary switch to a fixed rate mortgage, with the promise of being moved back to a tracker rate after a time period, which did not occur until customers complained as per a company policy introduced in 2011. The Central Bank of Ireland ultimately fined Ulster Bank Ireland DAC €37.774 million on 25 March 2021, after discovering 5,940 customers had been directly affected by the scandal, along with 49 separate regulatory breaches.

In September 2020, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported that NatWest was considering closing all Ulster Bank operations in the Republic of Ireland, a process that would take around six years. The bank would continue to operate in Northern Ireland. It had previously been reported in March 2014 that the then RBS Group was considering merging the bank in the Republic of Ireland with some of its rivals in order to reduce its holding, with RBS Group&#x27;s annual results for 2013 having revealed that Ulster Bank had operating losses of £1.5 billion and accounted for a fifth of the parent group&#x27;s total bad debt charges, although in October 2014, RBS had confirmed it would retain Ulster Bank following improved market conditions in Ireland. However, Ulster Bank&#x27;s operations in Ireland had been formally split into two separate entities in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in 2015.

In February 2021, following an extensive review, NatWest Group confirmed plans to withdraw Ulster Bank from the Republic of Ireland, with a &quot;phased withdrawal&quot; over the &quot;coming years&quot;.

In May 2022, Ulster Bank announced it would close nine branches across Northern Ireland in the following three months.

Ulster Bank began freezing certain current and deposit accounts in the Republic of Ireland on 11 November 2022, which were to be closed 30 days later, as part of its staggered process of eventually closing all such accounts. Twenty-five of their branches closed on 6 and 13 January 2023 and were taken over by Permanent TSB. The remaining 63 branches closed on 21 April 2023.

On 21 November 2023, Ulster Bank announced it would close a further 10 branches in Northern Ireland in 2024, thereby reducing its total number of branches to 25.

==Services==

Ulster Bank provide a full range of banking and insurance services to personal, business and commercial customers.

In Northern Ireland, as a trading name of National Westminster Bank, the bank is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority. National Westminster Bank is a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and UK Finance. In the Republic of Ireland, the bank is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.

The bank provides a Debit Mastercard to customers with their current accounts, in addition to other financial services. It launched 15 new commitments to its retail customers in September 2010.

==Corporate identity==
Until 1963/1964, Ulster Bank did not use a logo in the modern sense, and for branding purposes it used either its name alone or its name together with its coat of arms. From 1964–1965, it began to develop a logo for branding purposes, beginning with a large, bold &quot;UB&quot; featuring its coat of arms, followed by a large &quot;UB&quot; in outline, and finally an entwined U and B.

During 1969–1970, Ulster Bank gradually transitioned to the logo of the newly-formed National Westminster Bank, featuring three arrowheads.

In 2005, Ulster Bank&#x27;s logo was changed to the &quot;daisy wheel&quot; of Royal Bank of Scotland, together with its typeface design.

Ulster Bank is one of the four banks that issue pound sterling banknotes in Northern Ireland.

==Banknotes==

In common with the other Big Four banks of Northern Ireland, Ulster Bank retains the right to issue its own banknotes. These are pound sterling notes and equal in value to Bank of England notes, and should not be confused with banknotes of the former Irish pound, which was the official currency of the Republic of Ireland until it was replaced by the euro in 2002.

Ulster Bank&#x27;s current notes all share the same design of a view of Belfast Harbour flanked by landscape views; the design of the reverse is dominated by the bank&#x27;s coat of arms. The principal difference between the denominations is their colour and size. Notes incorporate a foil patch security feature depicting the bank&#x27;s logo.

* 5 pound note, grey
* 10 pound note, blue-green
* 20 pound note, purple
* 50 pound note, blue

In November 2006, Ulster Bank issued its first commemorative banknote – an issue of one million £5 notes commemorating the first anniversary of the death of former Northern Irish and Manchester United footballer, George Best. This was the first Ulster Bank banknote to incorporate the RBS &quot;daisy wheel&quot;, and the entire issue was taken by collectors within hours of becoming available in bank branches.

In 2019, Ulster Bank issued a new series of banknotes printed in polymer, which replaced its paper equivalents that were previously in circulation.

==Sponsorship==
On 8 February 2008, Ulster Bank Group Chief Executive, Cormac McCarthy, announced a three-year sponsorship deal worth over £1 million for the Belfast Festival at Queen&#x27;s. It was hailed as a &quot;new dawn&quot; for the festival which had been suffering underfunding.

Ulster Bank was the first overall sponsor of The Balmoral Show in 2009, Northern Ireland&#x27;s largest agricultural show.

Ulster Bank announced official sponsorship of the GAA All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in April 2008.

<doc id="827851" wikidata="Q4719717" url="?curid=827851" title="Alexander Murray (1755–1821)">
<text>Commodore Alexander Murray (July 12, 1755 – October 6, 1821) was an officer who served in the Continental Navy, the Continental Army, and later the United States Navy, during the American Revolutionary War, the Quasi-War with France and the First Barbary War in North Africa.

==Biography==

===Family background and early career===
Murray&#x27;s grandfather had been exiled to Barbados from his home in Elginshire, Scotland, following the Jacobite Rising of 1715, and his father was born there, before moving to Chestertown, Maryland, to practice as a physician, marry, and have several children, of whom Alexander was the youngest. As a young man Murray went to sea, and such was his skill that by the age of 18 he was the master of a merchant ship plying its trade between America and Europe.

===American Revolution===
Soon after the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, in 1776 the 21-year-old Murray was appointed a lieutenant in the Continental Navy. There being no posts available, Murray declined the offer of a letter of marque, and instead gained a commission as a lieutenant in the 1st Maryland Regiment under the command of Colonel William Smallwood.

Murray found himself in the thick of the New York and New Jersey campaign. He saw action at the Battle of White Plains in October 1776, after which he was promoted to captain, as was his friend, and fellow lieutenant of the Maryland Line, James Monroe. While serving at New York he suffered severe hearing loss from a bursting cannon while firing at a British fleet making its way up the North River (the lower Hudson along the west side of Manhattan). Murray served in the Army until the end of 1777, when he returned home on sick leave.

Murray applied to the Marine Committee for sea-service and was again offered the command of a privateer, which this time he accepted. Murray operated in the Atlantic Ocean with some success. Eventually, while commanding the &quot;Revenge&quot;, he captured a British ship near Newfoundland, but over-burdened with prisoners bore away for a port in France. Unfortunately, his ship and prize were captured by a British fleet, and were returned to New York City, then in possession of Sir William Howe&#x27;s army.

Murray gave his parole, and was soon exchanged. He was then appointed to the frigate . The ship set sail in August 1781, but after surviving a violent storm with some damage to her spars and rigging, on August 28 she found herself confronted by the British frigate &quot;Iris&quot; and sloop of war HMS &quot;General Monk&quot;. After a fierce action in heavy seas with &quot;Iris&quot;, the &quot;Trumbull&quot; was repeatedly raked by &quot;Monk&quot;. Now unmanageable, and more than a third of the crew wounded or dead, the &quot;Trumbull&quot; surrendered. &quot;Trumbull&quot; was towed into New York, where Murray recovered from his wounds and was once more exchanged.

Murray commanded a letter-of-marque on a successful voyage to St. Thomas with a cargo of tobacco, fighting off a British privateer, and capturing another, before taking part in an expedition against the Bahamas, and capturing New Providence.

He was then appointed First Lieutenant of the frigate under the command of John Barry, sailing on her final cruise across the Atlantic, to France, and then to the West Indies, before the war&#x27;s end in early 1783. The Continental Navy was disbanded at the end of the war and Murray returned to private life.

Murray was one of the few naval officers to be an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati.

===Quasi-War with France===
In 1794 the government, in response to attacks on American merchant shipping, passed the Naval Act, which authorised the building of six new frigates, and established the United States Navy.

Murray received a commission as one of the first thirteen post-captains in the new Navy, and in August 1798 was assigned to command the corvette , with orders to protect American shipping in the Caribbean from French privateers. Such was his success that he was voted the Thanks of Congress, and was given command of the frigate , formerly a French ship which had been captured by Thomas Truxtun. &quot;Insurgent&quot; sailed from Hampton Roads on 14 August 1799, and cruised in European waters during the winter of 1799–1800. She captured the French ship &quot;Vendemaire&quot;, and recaptured the American ships &quot;Margaret&quot;, &quot;Angora&quot;, &quot;Commerce&quot;, and &quot;William and Mary&quot;. &quot;Insurgent&quot; returned to the United States in March 1800 via the West Indies. Murray was then appointed to the command of the frigate by 3 May, 1800, and patrolled in the West Indies until early 1802,

===First Barbary War===
In early 1802 he was appointed the commodore of a small squadron sent to blockade Tripoli. In &quot;Constellation&quot;, he relieved Commodore Richard Dale (with whom he has served aboard the &quot;Trumbull&quot;). Murray distributed his small force, so as not to allow a single Tripolitan ship to escape to prey upon American merchantmen. At one time he was entirely alone and becalmed in his ship off the bay of Tripoli. The Algerians sent out a force of small armed vessels propelled by sweeps to attack him. Eventually a favourable breeze sprang up, and Murray was able to counter-attack with such effect, that the Tripolitan vessels fled back to the safety of the harbour under the protection of shore batteries. Unfortunately, after only four months Murray was superseded by Captain Richard V. Morris, and ordered to return to the United States. He complained about his treatment to the naval authorities without effect, and remained unemployed for the next few years.

===Later career===
From July 1805 until late 1806, Murray commanded the frigate , cruising along the eastern coast of the United States from New York to Florida protecting American commerce. In mid-1807, following the &quot;Chesapeake–Leopard&quot; affair, Murray applied for another sea-command, but was refused. Murray applied once more on the outbreak of the War of 1812, but was again rejected. Finally, in 1815, Murray was appointed Commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he worked closely with chief shipwright Samuel Humphreys, and remained there until his death on October 6, 1821. He is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Personal life==
Murray was married to Mary Miller, and had two sons, Magnus Miller Murray (twice Mayor of Pittsburgh) and Alexander M. Murray. Magnus&#x27;s son, also Alexander, became a naval officer, achieving the rank of Rear Admiral.

==Legacy==
* Two destroyers, (1918-1936) and (1943-1966) were named for him and his grandson Alexander Murray.

<text>Sundance Resort, also known as Sundance Mountain Resort, is a ski resort located northeast of Provo, Utah. It includes more than on the slopes of Mount Timpanogos in Utah&#x27;s Wasatch Range. Alpine skiing began on the site in 1944. Actor Robert Redford acquired the area in 1968, and established a year-round resort that would later spawn the independent Sundance Film Festival, in 1978, and the non-profit Sundance Institute, in 1980. The resort was first listed as a census-designated place (CDP) before the 2020 census.

The area known today as the Sundance Resort in the North Fork canyon was surveyed in the mid-1800s by Andrew Jackson Stewart Jr. and his sons, Andrew, Scott, and John Stewart. While working for the U.S. government, they discovered the view of Mt. Timpanogos. They each received 160 acres of land under the Homestead Act, and nearby lots were given to family members. Soon, members of the Stewart family erected log cabins. By 1911, they owned 2,200 acres and were raising sheep and cattle. They formed a company, North Folk Investment Co., to share income and protect the land. The area was known as &quot;Stewart Flats&quot; after the large number of Stewart family members living in the area.

Until 1920, &quot;Stewart Flats&quot; was connected to the wider world by a single unpaved road with a grade of 18 to 20 degrees on the last half mile. It was referred to as the &quot;big dugway&quot; due to the trench formed from dragging large trees down the road. In the early 1920s, the Utah County Commission built an automobile road that passed through &quot;Stewart Falls&quot; as it connected the towns of Aspen Grove and Wildwood.

===Hiking trails===
Mount Timpanogos became a popular mountain to hike after 1912, when Eugene L. Roberts, a professor at Brigham Young University opened a hiking trail and began taking students. The Timpanogos Hike began after mid-July when there was a full moon. The night before the hike, participants would gather for a celebration that usually had a bonfire. A favorite part of the celebration was the enactment of the &quot;Legend of Timpanogos&quot; that tells the story of an Indian princess who falls in love with a soldier who goes off to war; the soldier did not return, but she watched and waited for him atop Mount Timpanogos until she died. Roberts&#x27; event spawned an annual Timpanogos Hike.

In 1922, the Forest Service over the Wasatch National Forest, part of the United States Department of Agriculture, requested to put in a trail that crossed part of the property owned by the North Folk Investment Co, The Stewart family appreciated the hikes since they brought more popularity to the area. Today, the trails around the Sundance Mountain Resort offer views of North Fork and Stewart Falls. Many trails also feature plaques to mark flora and fauna in the area and are lined with benches. There are also three major biking trails at Sundance that even have ski-lift service after Memorial Day weekend.

===Timp Haven===
Ski races began on the Mount Timpanogos Glacier during the annual Timp hike in July 1941. The race was a slalom race. This race was held again in 1947, 1948, and 1949. A ski area later opened as Timp Haven in 1944. The name was chosen by a contest in which anyone could submit their suggestion. Ruth Biddulph submitted the winning name of Timp Haven and was given a season pass. Timp Haven was owned by S. Paul Stewart and run with the help of his brother Ray Stewart for over twenty years. Paul managed the slopes, built the ski lodge, and installed the water system. Ray Stewart was responsible for clearing and developing the Timp Haven Ski Resort and contributed to the original rope tow used. Hilda Stewart, Paul&#x27;s wife, had a cafe on the resort property and served hamburgers and other meals to ski guests. Paul later purchased the interests of other members of the Stewart family, which altogether owned between 3,000 and 4,000 acres of the property. The investment in the land in North Fork never paid dividends for the North Fork Investment Company owners.

The resort had a rope tow that was built by J.W. Daniel, who had tried to make a tow in Hobble Creek Canyon near Springville, Utah. The tow was powered by a Chevrolet truck, but was unsuccessful in that area. The Timpanogos Mountain Club persuaded Daniel to bring the tow to North Fork Canton. The tow was not ready for winter of 1944, and so it was abandoned by the club. Ray Stewart bought the truck and equipment and overhauled it to create a working tow to run on Saturdays and Sundays. The tow was difficult to use, however, because some of the roads leading to the resort were not plowed regularly making it difficult to drive the truck, and cold mornings caused the vehicle to freeze over. The tow pulled skiers 500 feet up the mountain. In addition, When Timp Haven opened, the creek was closer to the hill than it is today, so skiers had to make a quick turn at the bottom to avoid falling into the water. Ski season at Timp Haven started around Christmas and lasted until early March. A day pass to ski was only $1, and due to lighting installed by Provo City, Timp Haven allowed night skiing on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. While owned by the Stewart family, the ski area was closed on Sundays. 
Timp Haven also held ski races that were sponsored by various local organizations like the Timpanogos Ski Club or the Hoover Cup. The Timponogos Mountain Club cleared an area on the east hill and built a 45-foot ski jump.

Ski classes at the resort were started by Jessie Scofield, the supervisor of Provo City Recreation, in the winter of 1946. Professors at Brigham Young University also started ski classes, bringing buses of students in the afternoons. By that time, Timp Haven also had a tubing and toboggan hill. The Stewart family began expansion in 1947, and a T-bar lift was added at the base in 1948 (the same year as the ski jump was rebuilt) which was about in length, The lower terminal was seated on a platform that was 14 feet in the air. A 1938 Ford truck provided the power for the lift. This lift ran until 1953 when a single chairlift was added in the fall. It had a length of about . The first double chairlift was installed in the fall of 1965 and replaced the lower single chair and an upper T-bar, vertically climbing . It had an accident the following July which resulted in two fatalities. The resort continued expanding, however, and a lodge was built in 1957 (whose foundation is under the General Store and Grill Room today). A poma lift was added in 1958. A modern ski lift, the Mandan, was installed in 1964 and the two T-bar lifts were removed. The Navajo lift was installed in 1969, and the Arrowhead lift in 1985.

===Ownership under Robert Redford===
The Stewart family built a subdivision on &quot;Stewart Flats&quot; in the 1960s called Timp Haven Homes. Robert Redford purchased a 2-acre lot. Later, in August 1968, Redford purchased the entirety of Timp Haven, the land that is now known as Sundance, The resort was renamed from Timp Haven to Sundance, after the role Redford played in the 1969 film &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;. The resort of Sundance is not to be confused with the town of Sundance, Wyoming, the location from which the Sundance Kid received his name. Redford&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; was filmed near the resort.

Because of its lower elevation, the resort had a shorter ski season than its competitors. In order to increase revenue, Redford wanted to create an Aspen-like atmosphere and use the resort to promote the arts and draw in Hollywood stars. The Sundance Film Festival was held at the resort to help it achieve this purpose.

====Sundance Institute and Film Festival====
In November 1979, Redford held a 3-day conference for filmmakers and professional artists at the Sundance Mountain Resort. The goal of the event was to promote indie filmmakers. These efforts laid the foundation for what would become the Sundance Institute. In 1981, the Sundance Institute was founded to foster and celebrate the diversity of American filmmaking.

The U.S. Film Festival, first held in 1978, was organized by the Sundance Institute from 1985 onward. In 1991, the name was officially changed to the Sundance Film Festival. Redford hosted the 1985 festival, the first under the auspices of Sundance. He was reluctant to take control of the festival, and in its early years, it was &quot;regarded by many [film] distributors as toxic&quot;. However, the 1989 festival gained wider recognition after its showing of Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot;. Although it has increased in popularity, the film festival has maintained its support of the making and distribution of indie films.

Today, the Sundance Film Festival is held each year in January and primarily north in Park City, and is a popular and well-known competition for independent film makers. It is the largest independent film festival in the United States, and also one of the largest in the world. It features documentaries, large films and small films. The festival receives over 9,000 submissions, and around 200 are featured. More than 50,000 people attend the festival each year.

The small town that surrounds the resort is home to 28 full-time residents, with many residents living in the area more than 50 years. Several notable people have owned residencies in the Sundance Resort properties, including Sydney Pollack, William Devane, and Daniel Melnick.

===New ownership===

Robert Redford reached an agreement to sell the 2,600-acre resort to Broadreach Capital Partners and Cedar Capital Partners. He announced the sale to employees on December 11, 2020.

Though the resort has been Redford&#x27;s Utah home for more than a half-century, it also &quot;created a lot of weight for me to be carrying around&quot;, Redford told the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; in December 2020, ahead of the announcement of the sale. &quot;I had been searching for years for the right people to take it to the next level, so that I could take that weight off my shoulders and enjoy my life&quot;.

As part of the sale, Broadreach and Cedar have committed to continue Redford&#x27;s policies of responsible development and land preservation. The resort&#x27;s 2,600 acres include 1,845 acres that are preserved through a conservation easement and protective covenants.

===Skiing trails===
Today, Sundance Mountain Resort has skiing for every ability, with 20% beginner trails, 40% intermediate trails and 40% advanced trails. The resort terrain climbs 2,150 vertical feet () up the northeast slope of Mount Timpanogos, reaching the crest of the ridge at Bearclaw Cabin. This restaurant at the resort&#x27;s apex of provides spectacular 360° views of the surrounding landscape, and of Mount Timpanogos as it rises to a height just short of .

===Chairlifts===
In 1994, CTEC constructed a fixed-grip quad named Ray&#x27;s, to honor Ray Stewart and his work in developing Timp Haven. The lift offered direct access to the back of the mountain and covered over 5,400 feet with a vertical rise of 1,400 feet, with an uphill capacity of 1,800 people per hour.

The mountain is serviced by four chairlifts and a handle tow for beginners at the mountain&#x27;s base. Sundance now offers the 6th longest zip line in the United States, which features the most vertical drop of any zip line on the North American Continent.

In 2016, the Arrowhead triple was retired and replaced with a fixed-grip quad, constructed by Doppelmayr USA. The new lift was named Red&#x27;s, after Redford and his family, and carried 500 more people uphill per hour over its predecessor.

For the 2021-2022 season, Doppelmayr USA constructed two chairlifts to replace the aging Ray&#x27;s lift. The front side portion was replaced by a high speed quad, known as the Outlaw Express, running on an alignment previously used by the Mandan double chairlift that Ray&#x27;s replaced, with a mid-unload station below Marmot Gulch to service beginner terrain that had been accessible from the winter mid-station on Ray&#x27;s. The backside portion was replaced with a new fixed grip quad called Stairway, running from the bottom of Red&#x27;s to the Mandan summit.

<doc id="827860" wikidata="Q2715402" url="?curid=827860" title="Kentucky cave shrimp">
<text>The Kentucky cave shrimp (&quot;Palaemonias ganteri&quot;) is an eyeless, troglobite shrimp. It lives in caves in Barren County, Edmonson County, Hart County and Warren County, Kentucky. The shrimp&#x27;s shell has no pigment; the species is nearly transparent and closely resembles its nearest relative, the Alabama cave shrimp.

The habitat of the Kentucky cave shrimp is exclusively in underground streams of caves. It is endemic to the Mammoth Cave National Park region of central Kentucky. The shrimp feeds mainly on sediments that are washed into the cave by the movement of groundwater.

==Conservation==

The Kentucky cave shrimp was registered as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act in 1983, and was included on the IUCN Red List as Endangered in 1994. There are currently only several thousand remaining. It is mostly threatened by contaminated groundwater running into its habitat. Several nearby communities either have inadequate sewage treatment facilities or lack such facilities altogether. An additional potential threat is the entry of contaminants from traffic accidents and roadside businesses. One incident in 1979 caused the death of aquatic cave organisms in a part of the Mammoth Cave system, and in a 1980 incident, a truck carrying toxic cyanide salts overturned on Interstate 65, just south of Mammoth Cave National Park.

A recovery plan is underway which includes:
# Surveying the location and extent of all areas supporting shrimp
# Conducting life history and other research required to determine what constitutes a viable population
# Monitoring population status
# Maintaining adequate water quality; 
# Protecting the shrimp from introduced predators
# Producing and conducting public education programs.

<text>Östers Idrottsförening, commonly known as Östers IF or simply Öster, is a Swedish sports club located in Växjö, specializing in football. For the 2025 season the club is back in the top tier, Allsvenskan, after achieving promotion from Superettan in 2024. It will be the club&#x27;s first season in Allsvenskan since 2013.

The club has previously also competed in ice hockey (see separate article), bandy, and bowling. Öster was formed on 20 April 1930 as Östers Fotbollförening, before adopting the name &quot;Östers IF&quot; in 1932. The club is affiliated to the Smålands Fotbollförbund.

In 1968, their first season in Allsvenskan, Öster became the first team ever to win the national title at their first attempt (newly promoted IF Elfsborg won the league in 1961 but had played in, and been winners of, the championship in the past). This win ignited the team&#x27;s &#x27;golden age&#x27; which lasted until the early 1980s and saw them win a total of four Swedish championships.

On 31 March 2011, Öster broke ground on their new arena, Myresjöhus Arena, which was inaugurated in August 2012. The arena hosted four games of the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2013 tournament.

==History==

Öster (English: &quot;East&quot;) was named after a district in the city of Växjö. They were not part of the upper divisions in the early days of swedish football and only made their first appearance in the third tier in 1947. During the 1950s and early-1960s the club made a push to raise the level of football by inviting and playing against foreign teams such as Flamengo, Juventus and Fluminense. This coupled with an increase in the amount of training helped the team establish themselves in the second tier.

In 1961 Öster had their first chance ever to qualify for Allsvenskan but ended up in last place in the four team promotion playoffs. Success in the promotion playoffs would instead come six years later in 1967 when they beat IK Brage in the deciding game in front of a home crowd of 26,404 people. Öster defied the odds during their first season in the top division and won the league on goal difference after a total of four teams had ended the season on exactly the same number of points. Following their championship title the club had ten years of solid Allsvenskan finishes before becoming dominant in the late-1970s and early-1980s where they won the league three times in four years.

After that successful era followed a slow decline over the next couple of decades which culminated in their relegation to the second tier in 1998. After that the club has found it hard to reestablish itself in Allsvenskan and has only made short one year appearances.

==Footnotes==
:A Current youth players who at least have sat on the bench in a competitive match.

:B. The title of &quot;Swedish Champions&quot; has been awarded to the winner of four different competitions over the years. Between 1896 and 1925 the title was awarded to the winner of Svenska Mästerskapet, a stand-alone cup tournament. No clubs were given the title between 1926 and 1930 even though the first-tier league Allsvenskan was played. In 1931 the title was reinstated and awarded to the winner of Allsvenskan. Between 1982 and 1990 a play-off in cup format was held at the end of the league season to decide the champions. After the play-off format in 1991 and 1992 the title was decided by the winner of Mästerskapsserien, an additional league after the end of Allsvenskan. Since the 1993 season the title has once again been awarded to the winner of Allsvenskan.

<doc id="827863" wikidata="Q910274" url="?curid=827863" title="Transfer case">
<text>A transfer case is an intermediate gearbox that transfers power from the transmission of a motor vehicle to the driven axles of four-wheel-drive, all-wheel-drive, and other multi-axled on- and off-road machines. A part of the vehicle&#x27;s drivetrain, it employs drive shafts to mechanically deliver motive power. The transfer case also synchronizes the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels (only high-speed 4wd-Awd systems), and may contain one or more sets of low range gears for off-road use. 

==Functions==
The transfer gearbox (a secondary transmission system) receives power from the transmission and sends it to both the front and rear axles, or just one (usually the rear.) This can be done with gears, hydraulics, or chain drive. On some vehicles, such as four-wheel-drive trucks or vehicles intended for off-road use, this feature is controlled by the driver. The driver can put the transfer case into either &quot;two-wheel-drive&quot; or &quot;four-wheel-drive&quot; mode. This was traditionally accomplished by means of a shifter, similar to that in a manual transmission. Increasingly it is electronically operated by a dashboard, center console, or shift lever switch. 

A transfer case that allows alternating between 2-wheel drive and 4-wheel drive modes but lacks a center differential for coordinating axle speeds is known as &quot;part-time&quot;. Some vehicles, such as all-wheel-drive (AWD) sports cars, have transfer cases that are not selectable, known as &quot;full-time&quot;. Such a transfer case is permanently &quot;locked&quot; into AWD mode. In recent decades hybrids have been developed that share properties of each.

Transfer cases also perform other functions. Some are common to all types, others vary by type:

* The transfer case may contain one or more sets of low range gears for off-road use. Low range gears are engaged with a shifter or electronic switch. In many transfer cases, this shifter is the same as the one that selects 2WD or 4WD operation. Low range gears allow the vehicle to drive at much slower speeds while still operating within the usable power band / RPM range of the engine. This also increases the torque available at the axles. Low-range gears are used for very inclement road conditions, towing a heavy load slowly, driving on rough, unimproved roads slowly, and extreme off-road maneuvers such as rockcrawling. This feature is often absent on all-wheel-drive cars. Some very large vehicles, such as heavy equipment or military trucks, may have more than one set of low-range gears.
* The transfer case may require stopping entirely to engage four-wheel drive (or just low-range 4WD), slowing to a designated speed to engage or disengage an extra axle, or may permit full &quot;shift-on-the-fly&quot; engagement of high-range 4WD at any speed.
* Transfer cases that are designed to allow for normal road use synchronize the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels, in much the same way the differential acts on a given axle. This is necessary because the front and rear tires never turn at the same speed. Different rates of tire rotation are generally due to different tire diameters (since the front and rear tires inevitably wear at different rates) and different gear ratios in the front and rear differentials since manufacturers will often have a slightly lower ratio in the front vs. the rear to help with control (such as a 3.55:1 in the rear differential and a 3.54:1 in the front differential). If the transfer case did not make up the difference between the two different rates of rotation, binding would occur and the transfer case could become damaged. This is also why a transfer case that is not designed for on-road use will cause problems with driveline windup if driven on dry pavement.
* Most traditional transfer cases designed for off-road include the ability to mechanically lock the front and rear drive shafts to evenly distribute engine torque between them. This is similar to the differential lock&#x27;s ability to force both wheels of an axle to turn simultaneously by locking them together, only between axles instead of wheels.
* A part-/full-time hybrid transfer case enables a vehicle to operate in two-wheel drive, full-time four-wheel drive (with the center differential open) and part-time four-wheel drive (with the center diff locked) in both high- and low-ranges. 

==Types==
Transfer cases used on &quot;part-time&quot; four-wheel-drive off-road vehicles such as trucks and some specialty military vehicles generally allow the driver to select 2WD or 4WD, as well as high or low gear ranges. Automated versions used in sports cars and performance sedans are usually &quot;transparent&quot; to the driver; there is no shifter or select lever.

===Drive types===

====Gear-driven====
There are two different types of internal power-transfer mechanisms found in most transfer cases. Gear-driven transfer cases use sets of gears to drive either the front or both the front and rear driveshafts. These are generally strong, heavy units that are used in large trucks, but there are currently several gear drive cases in production for passenger cars.

====Chain-driven====
Chain-driven transfer cases use a chain to drive most often only one axle but can drive both axles. Chain-driven transfer cases are quieter and lighter than gear-driven ones. They are used in vehicles such as compact trucks, full-size trucks, Jeeps, and SUVs. Some off-road driving enthusiasts modify their vehicles to use gear-driven transfer cases, accepting the additional weight and noise to gain the extra strength they generally provide.

===Housing type===

====Married====
Transfer cases are also classified as either &quot;divorced&quot;/independent or &quot;married&quot;. Married transfer cases are bolted directly to the transmission, usually between the transmission&#x27;s output shaft and the rear or main driveshaft. Sometimes a married transfer case is an integral part of the transmission and the two components share the same housing or &quot;case&quot;, as is commonly found on recent Subaru products and some other all-wheel-drive cars.

====Divorced/independent====
A divorced or independent transfer case is completely separate from the transmission. It is located further down the driveline than a married transfer case and connected to the transmission output shaft by a short driveshaft. Independent transfer cases are used on very long wheelbase vehicles, such as commercial trucks or military trucks. This setup is also optimal for modified 4x4 because it&#x27;s easier to change engine and transmissions, preserving the original 4WD system.

===Transfer case shift type===

====M.S.O.F.====
Manual Shift On-the-Fly transfer cases have a selector lever on the driver&#x27;s side floor transmission hump and may also have either two sealed automatic front axle locking hubs or two manual front axle hub selectors of &quot;LOCK&quot; and &quot;UNLOCK&quot; or &quot;FREE&quot;. To engage the four-wheel-drive system the vehicle must be moving at a low speed. The speed at which 4x4 can be engaged depends on the vehicle. This is only for the four-wheel-drive high setting. To engage the four-wheel-drive low setting, the vehicle must be stopped and the transmission must be shifted to neutral, then the four-wheel-drive low can be selected.

====E.S.O.F.====
Electronic Shift On-the-Fly (ESOF) transfer cases have a dash-mounted selector switch or buttons with front sealed automatic locking axle hubs or drive flanges. Unlike the manual transfer case, this system has a transfer case motor. To engage the four-wheel-drive system the vehicle must be moving at a lower speed. The speed at which 4x4 can be engaged depends on the vehicle. This is only for the four-wheel-drive high setting. To engage the four-wheel-drive low setting, the vehicle must be stopped and the transmission must be shifted to neutral, then the four-wheel-drive low can be selected.

<text>Rear Admiral Alexander Murray (2 January 1816 – 10 November 1884) was a flag officer in the United States Navy, who served during the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Murray was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and was entered the Navy as a midshipman on August 22, 1835. He served aboard the schooner in the West Indies Squadron in 1836–38, and on the steamer off the Atlantic coast in 1839–41, receiving promotion to passed midshipman on June 22, 1841.

He then served on the sloop in the Home Squadron in 1841–43, and the schooner in the Pacific Squadron in 1844–45. He returned to the Home Squadron in 1846, to participate in the capture of Alvarado, Tabasco, Tuxpan, Veracruz, and Tampico during the Mexican War. 

Murray then served in the United States Coast Survey from 1846 to 1849, and was promoted to 
master on March 23, 1847, and received his commission as lieutenant on August 12, 1847.

Murray served aboard the razee in the Mediterranean Squadron in 1849–51, and was stationed on the receiving ship at Norfolk in 1852–53. He was placed on the Reserved List on September 13, 1855, not returning to Active status until August 12, 1857. Murray then served on the Coast Survey in 1858–60.

===Civil war===
At the start of the Civil War Murray was given command of the screw steamer and assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. &quot;Louisiana&quot; operated along the coast of Virginia, blocking the passage of Confederate blockade runners, and attacking their bases. On 13 September 1861, &quot;Louisiana&quot; and the frigate engaged the Confederate steamer off Newport News, but shot from both sides fell short.

In early 1862 &quot;Louisiana&quot; was part of the naval forces supporting Ambrose Burnside&#x27;s North Carolina Expedition, and Murray saw action at a series of battles; at Roanoke Island on February 8, Elizabeth City on February 10, and New Bern on February 14.

In May 1862 Murray commanded a combined Army-Navy operation on Virginia&#x27;s York and Pamunkey Rivers, destroying twenty-seven enemy vessels, including two large steamers, and approaching to within of Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy. He was promoted to commander on July 16, 1862, and was assigned to duty in the Sounds of North Carolina in 1863. He was then stationed at Portsmouth Navy Yard, New Hampshire, until the end of the war.

===Post-war career===
Murray was appointed to command of the steamer on April 2, 1866, and was promoted to captain on July 25. In May 1866, &quot;Augusta&quot; embarked Gustavus Fox, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and sailed on a cruise, accompanied by the monitor and the gunboat . The purpose of the cruise was threefold; firstly to convey Fox to Russia as President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s personal representative to Tsar Alexander II, secondly to demonstrate the monitor&#x27;s ability to operate in the open sea, and thirdly to cultivate friendly international relations. After the three ships arrived at Queenstown, Ireland, &quot;Ashuelot&quot; sailed independently to the Far East, and &quot;Augusta&quot; and &quot;Miantonomoh&quot; then visited England, before finally arriving at Kronstadt in August. After a month&#x27;s stay in Russia, during which the Tsar and members of the royal family visited the ships, they called at Stockholm, Sweden, Kiel, Germany, and ports in France, Portugal, and Spain. After transiting the Strait of Gibraltar, the ships spent Christmas at Málaga, Spain, before spending the next four and a half months visiting ports in the Mediterranean Sea. They returned home via the Canary Islands, the Cape Verdes, Barbados, and the Bahamas, finally arriving at Philadelphia on 22 July 1867.

Murray then served as commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1869. He was promoted to commodore on June 19, 1871, and to rear admiral, on April 26, 1876, and served on the Lighthouse Board, and commanded the Pacific Station. Murray was placed on the Retired List on April 30, 1878.

Murray was a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Murray died on November 10, 1884, in Washington, D.C.

<text>The first USS &quot;Norfolk&quot; was a brig in the United States Navy during the Quasi-War with France.

&quot;Norfolk&quot; was built by the city of Norfolk, Virginia for the public service at the beginning of the Quasi-War with France in 1798. Captain Thomas Williams was appointed to the command and she was reported ready for sea, except for her other officers, on 9 September 1798.

==Service history==
Captain Alexander Murray, commanding 
, was advised that &quot;Norfolk&quot; was to be included in the little squadron under his command. Ordered to sail for the West Indies for the purpose of destroying French armed vessels and protecting American commerce, &quot;Montezuma&quot;, &quot;Norfolk&quot;, and (Lt. William Bainbridge in command), sailed from Norfolk 25 October.

On the cruise south &quot;Retaliation&quot; was captured by two French frigates. &quot;Montezuma&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot;, after recapturing a large schooner off Guadalupe, which had been captured by the French, put in at Antigua. Thereafter &quot;Norfolk&quot; cruised near St. Kitts.

&quot;Norfolk&quot; joined Commodore Truxtun&#x27;s squadron and 20 January 1799 the Commodore ordered Captain Williams to join him at Basseterre, St. Kitts. &quot;Norfolk&quot; sailed northward with a convoy of merchant ships 6 March, and proceeded to Philadelphia.

Master Commandant William Bainbridge was ordered to relieve Captain Williams 29 March and to refit the ship for sea as soon as possible. &quot;Norfolk&quot; then sailed to St. Kitts to join Truxtun&#x27;s squadron; she arrived Basse-terre Roads 17 May and was subsequently ordered to Commodore Thomas Tingey&#x27;s Squadron. In company with 16 June &quot;Norfolk&quot; captured the French privateer &quot;Vainqueur&quot; off Guadeloupe.

&quot;Norfolk&quot; arrived New York 14 August with French prisoners. After extensive repairs, she was ordered to the West Indies again 16 September, cruising on the San Domingo Station and later in the vicinity of Havana, actively protecting American commerce and opening island ports to American trade. On 7 November she captured a French sloop/cutter &quot;Le Garda Le Pelican&quot; that had just been captured by a French flagged barge, of piratical nature, the barge was captured by . About 22 February, 1800 she forced ashore the French privateer schooner &quot;Beauty&quot; at Point Jaco, Cuba with her side shelled to pieces. She sailed from Havana 3 April 1800 with a number of merchant ships under convoy, arriving Philadelphia 12 April.

Lt. Thomas Calvert took command of &quot;Norfolk&quot; 29 April, and on 20 May she was ordered to convoy vessels to Cartagena and then to take up station with the squadron at San Domingo. &quot;Norfolk&quot; sailed in June and en route encountered two French privateers, but both escaped, one after a half hour&#x27;s fight in which Lt. Calvert was seriously wounded. On 19 July she fought a battle with one of the privateers, a schooner, 8 Leagues south east of St Maartens. Later, in company with , &quot;Norfolk&quot; captured a small cutter sloop. Lt. Calvert was ordered by Commodore Murray 2 August to take under convoy vessels from Cartagena and Cape St. Nicole Mole and proceed with them to the coast of North America, after which, due to &quot;Norfolk&quot;″s poor condition, he sailed to Baltimore.

Benjamin Stoddert, the Secretary of the Navy, ordered Lt. Calvert to pay off the crew of &quot;Norfolk&quot; 21 October, to remove her stores and furnishings, and to prepare her for sale. &quot;Norfolk&quot; was subsequently sold, probably in November 1800.

<doc id="827869" wikidata="Q3115233" url="?curid=827869" title="Les Grands Ballets Canadiens">
<text>Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montréal (GBCM) is a ballet company based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. A creative and repertory company, it performs works that reflect the diverse trends of contemporary ballet.

==History==
Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montréal was founded in 1957 by Ludmilla Chiriaeff. Conductor and composer Michel Perrault served as the organization&#x27;s first music director.

Since its creation, Les Grands Ballets has performed a broad range of dance, ranging from classics to major contemporary work. Under the direction of Chiriaeff and Fernand Nault (1965–1973), Brian Macdonald (1974–1977) and Lawrence Rhodes (1990–1999), the institution fostered the development of such notable artists as James Kudelka, Édouard Lock and Ginette Laurin.

In 1981 the company participated alongside the National Ballet of Canada, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, le Groupe de la Place Royale, the Danny Grossman Dance Company, the Toronto Dance Theatre, Winnipeg Contemporary Dancers and the Anna Wyman Dance Theatre in the Canadian Dance Spectacular, a dance show at Ottawa&#x27;s National Arts Centre which was filmed by the National Film Board of Canada for the 1982 documentary film &quot;Gala&quot;.

In 2000, Gradimir Pankov became artistic director. A native of Macedonia, Pankov previously served as artistic director of Nederlands Dans Theater II (Netherlands), the National Ballet of Finland (Helsinki), the Cullberg Ballet (Sweden), and Ballet du Grand Théâtre de Genève (Switzerland).

In 2017, Ivan Cavallari became the artistic director of les Grands Ballets. Born in Italy, he trained at Teatro alla Scala Ballet School in Milan. Before becoming artistic director of les Grands Ballets, he was artistic director of the West Australian Ballet and then the Ballet de l&#x27;Opéra national du Rhin. The ballet masters are Hervé Courtain, appointed in 2017, and Marina Villanueva Arias, appointed in 2020.

The company has commissioned work from some of the world&#x27;s most prominent choreographers: &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; by Kim Brandstrup; &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; by Shawn Hounsell; &quot;Between Ashes and Angels&quot; by Adam Hougland; Noces, Cinderella and The Rite of Spring by Stijn Celis; The Little Prince, Possibly Six and TooT by Didy Veldman; The Beast and the Beauty by Kader Belarbi; Four Seasons by Mauro Bigonzetti; Minus One and Danz by Ohad Naharin; Rodin/Claudel by Peter Quanz; and Re–II by Shen Wei.

Its repertoire also includes major acquisitions by such artists as Mats Ek, Jiří Kylián, Jean-Christophe Maillot and Christopher Wheeldon, along with works by young creators like Stephan Thoss, Didy Veldman and Peter Quanz. In 2008 Gradimir Pankov established the national choreographic contest, won by Jean-Sébastien Couture, which has allowed Les Grands Ballets to showcase work by emerging Canadian choreographers. Each season, Les Grands Ballets invited international companies to perform as part of its program; the list includes Houston Ballet, Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Alvin Ailey® American Dance Theater, Cullberg Ballet (Sweden), Compañía Nacional de Danza (Spain), Warsaw Ballet (Poland), Cloud Gate Dance Theatre (Taiwan), Shen Wei Dance Arts (New York City), Ballet de l’Opéra de Lyon (France), Dutch National Ballet and Eifman Ballet Theatre of St-Petersburg (Russia).

Since Ivan Cavallari took artistic leadership, the company focuses on extending its repertoire to both showcase the great ballet classics and acquire new works by emerging contemporary creators.

<text>Ignác Šechtl (26 May 1840 – 6 July 1911), also known as Ignace Schächtl or Hynek Šechtl, was a pioneer of Czech photography (especially photojournalism) and cinematography. He moved from Prague, to Kladno, Plzeň, Bucharest, Prachatice and Nepomuk, and finally to Tábor, where he established the photographic firm Šechtl and Voseček, which survived for three generations.

==Biography==

Ignác Šechtl was born in Prague, on 26 May 1840, into the family of a miller. His father intended him to become a trader, and his first job was administrator for the business of Alexander Klier, in Prague. In 1863 he moved to Kladno, to learn the art of photography, and in 1865 he was granted tradesman&#x27;s rights. Only a few of his cartes de visite remain from that time, and these are now stored in the family archive.

In 1864, he moved to Plzeň, and opened his studio, the fourth in the town. Contemporary newspapers mention his photographing of the unveiling of the memorial to sculptor Wiltd, and describe it as being successful in spite of the inclement weather on the day. This is the first mention of Ignác Šechtl&#x27;s outdoor work.

In 1868, he went into partnership with photographer Franz Bergman. The two men later had a falling out, after which Šechtl and his wife Antonia left Plzeň and he became an itinerant photographer. He tried his luck in Bucharest in 1871, and in Nepomuk and Prachatice. Several significant photographs remain from this period. One unique work that has survived is a photomontage, achieved by double exposure, depicting Ignác Šechtl both as laboratory worker and retouching a photo, in one picture. Also interesting are photos of towns, for example, shots of Prachatice, Jistebnice, Tábor, Žirovnice and a panoramic photograph of Blatná.

In 1870, Ignác&#x27;s daughter Antonia was born. Four years later, his wife Antonia died. Later, on trips to Tábor, he met Catherine Štastná, housekeeper of Josef Němec, the husband of famous writer, Božena Němcová. Catherine later became his second wife. At 36, Šechtl finally settled in Tábor, and officially opened his studio in 1876, at house number 333 on Maria Square.

His son, Josef Jindřich, was born in 1877. Family tradition says that the same day, in a pub, Šechtl met the commercial traveller Jan Voseček, who very soon became a partner in the firm. The 1880 census reveals Voseček as Šechtl&#x27;s assistant.

Ignác documented with passion the evolution of the town of Tábor, even though he lost money on this work. From the years 1876–77, several photos remain of Tábor Square shortly after the renovation of the Town Hall, and a photo-essay documenting the unveiling of the Jan Žižka Memorial by sculptor Josef Václav Myslbek.

In 1878, the weekly newspaper &quot;Český Jih&quot; announced the founding of the partnership of Alexander Seik and Ignác Šechtl. Some of the photos from this time bear the logo of both photographers, while others show individual logos. However, Seik was losing interest in photography and was turning his attention to politics, so around 1886 the partnership came to an end. However, the separation of the two studios does not appear to have damaged Šechtl&#x27;s business.

Ignác Šechtl was a founding member of the Fishermen&#x27;s Club, and he was also a popular amateur actor. It is said that the audience laughed as soon as Ignác appeared on stage. His experience as an actor, his wit, and his sense of theatre, are apparent in many of his photos.

Jan Voseček started his work with Šechtl in the former Seik studio in 1888. We have photos signed by Voseček from this time. He became a partner in the firm &quot;Schächtl and Voseček&quot;, later changed to the Czech spelling of &quot;Šechtl and Voseček&quot;.

In 1896, Ignác Šechtl discovered a new passion – cinematography. He held the first licence in Bohemia for showing moving pictures. What would have been the first showing in Bohemia was scheduled for Plzeň, in 1896. However, due to technical difficulties at Plzeň, it appears the first-ever showing was in fact, by Ignác Šechtl, in the Shooting Gallery in Tábor, in 1897. However, Ignác Šechtl was dissatisfied with the technical quality, and he travelled to Vienna to try to solve these problems. He became an itinerant cinematographer, but the business kept losing money, and finally, he sold it to the magician, Viktor Ponrepo.

In 1902, the firm Šechtl and Voseček exhibited at the great Regional Exhibition in Tábor. Ignác, with his son Josef Jindřich, created a large photo-essay of the Exhibition, which survives to this day. He also documented the building of the Bechyně Railway in 1903, and many Sokol meets. In 1904, his son Josef became a full partner in the firm. In 1906, the firm opened a branch in Pelhřimov, and also exhibited at the Austrian Exhibition in London. In 1907 they started building a new studio, in the place of the former Seik studio, which became the largest in southern Bohemia.

Ignác Šechtl died on 6 July 1911. The firm Šechtl and Voseček survived, until nationalisation by the Communist government in 1953.

<text>The doucs or douc langurs make up the genus Pygathrix. They are colobine Old World monkeys, native to Southeast Asia, which consists of these 3 species: red-shanked douc, black-shanked douc, and gray-shanked douc.

== Description ==
The doucs are colobine Old World monkeys, which make up the genus Pygathrix. They are native to Southeast Asia.

== Classification ==
Even though they are known as &quot;douc langurs&quot;, they are in fact more closely related to the proboscis monkey and snub-nosed monkeys than to any of the langurs. They are part of the subfamily Colobinae of the family Cercopithecidae.



== Appearance ==
Doucs have a distinct appearance. The red-shanked douc characteristically has bright maroon legs and reddish patches around the eyes. In contrast, the grey-shanked douc is less vibrant, with speckled grey legs and orange markings on the face. Both have dappled grey bodies, black hands and feet and white cheeks, although the cheek hairs of the red-shanked douc are much longer. The black-shanked douc has black legs. Their long hind limbs and tail allow these monkeys to be very agile in their treetop habitat.

== Behavior ==
They live in small family groups headed by one adult male. A single group may have several adult females, and many children. Young males unaffiliated with a family group often make their own troops. Females usually bear a single offspring at a time, which is suckled for about a year.

<text>John Rees (born 1957) is a British political activist, academic, journalist and writer who is a national officer of the Stop the War Coalition, and founding member of &quot;Counterfire&quot;. He is currently a visiting research fellow at Goldsmiths, University of London.

He was formerly a leading member of the Socialist Workers Party and, as an SWP member, was heavily involved in Respect – The Unity Coalition. His books include &quot;Timelines, a political history of the modern world&quot; and &quot;A People&#x27;s History of London&quot;, co-authored with his partner Lindsey German. He also produces documentaries and presents current affairs programmes for the Islam Channel.

==Early life and education==

Rees was born in Wiltshire, in South-West England, and was brought up and educated in Chippenham. His father, William Rees was from Aberdare, South Wales, and was a lifelong trade union activist and Labour Party member. His mother, Margaret Rees (Shipley) Rees was from Darlington.

Rees&#x27; first degree was in Politics from Portsmouth Polytechnic and he subsequently undertook research on Hegel and Marx at Hull University under Dr (now Lord) Bhikhu Parekh. The result of that research, &quot;The Algebra of Revolution&quot;, was published by Routledge in 1998. When Georg Lukacs&#x27; unknown manuscript &quot;Tailism and the Dialectic&quot; was discovered and published by Verso Books in 2000, Rees provided the introduction to the volume. He holds a doctorate on &#x27;Leveller organisation and the dynamic of the English Revolution&#x27; from Goldsmiths, University of London.

==Politics==
Elected a member of the National Executive of the National Union of Students in the early 1980s, Rees is a former member of the Socialist Workers Party, and was for many years on its Central Committee. He was editor of the quarterly journal &quot;International Socialism&quot; for ten years and the organiser of the SWP&#x27;s annual Marxism festival in 1982–1983 and again from 1992 to 2002.

A co-founder and a current national officer for the Stop the War Coalition, he has been a central organiser of all its marches including that of 15 February 2003. According to Rees, &quot;Socialists should unconditionally stand with the oppressed against the oppressor, even if the people who run the oppressed country are undemocratic and persecute minorities, like Saddam Hussein.&quot; At the same time Rees has always advocated an unrelenting struggle against pro-Western dictators by the people of oppressed countries and to that end Rees became vice president (Europe) of the Cairo Anti-war Conference which rallied opposition forces against the Mubarak dictatorship in Egypt.
He was at the top of Respect – The Unity Coalition&#x27;s list in the West Midlands region for the 2004 European election and the Respect candidate for the Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election. He also stood for Respect in the 2006 local election in the Bethnal Green South ward of Tower Hamlets in East London, where he came second to Labour. Rees was not selected by the SWP Central Committee to be on the slate for re-election and did not stand independently at the January 2009 conference. Shortly after his partner Lindsey German resigned from the SWP in 2010, Rees and 41 other members followed disenchanted with the party&#x27;s direction, internal regime and approach to united fronts (18 others who had resigned in weeks prior also supported the resignations).

In 2012, &quot;A People&#x27;s History of London&quot;, which Rees co-authored with Lindsey German, was published. The book is a history of London radicalism which documents working (or lower) class struggles in London from the Romans to the present day. Jerry White in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;Those who continue to uphold London&#x27;s living traditions of protest will be able to take heart from this fresh and welcome look at the city&#x27;s history.&quot; White described the book as &quot;a very selective people&#x27;s history&quot; which does not cover the bombings committed by the IRA and by Islamists on 7 July 2005. Jo Lo Dicio in &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; wrote: &quot;Had these two been political pamphleteers through the ages, one doubts many revolutionary sparks would ever have been lit.&quot;

A book on the Levellers and the English Revolution based on his doctoral research was published by Verso in 2016. Rees is currently active in the organisation Counterfire for which he has written two short books, &quot;Strategy and Tactics&quot; and alongside Joseph Daher &quot;The People Demand: A short history of the Arab revolutions&quot;. He participated in and reported on the Egyptian revolution in 2011 about which he made two TV documentaries, &quot;Inside the Egyptian Revolution&quot; and &quot;Egypt in Revolution&quot;. For the Islam Channel, he is the writer and presenter of the political history documentary series &quot;Timeline&quot; and a presenter of &quot;The Report&quot; and &quot;Politics and Media&quot; current affairs programmes. He has appeared as a political commentator in Ken Loach&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;45&quot; and in Amir Amarani&#x27;s &quot;We Are Many&quot;.

In September 2013, Iain Dale and a panel for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; placed him at 85 in a list of the 100 most influential British left-wingers. Around this time, Rees was the founder and organising committee member of The People&#x27;s Assembly.

In 2016, Rees toured the UK to support Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s bid to become prime minister.

<doc id="827881" wikidata="Q5766618" url="?curid=827881" title="Hinduism in Java">
<text>Hinduism has historically been a major religious and cultural influence in Java, Indonesia. Hinduism was the dominant religion in the region before the arrival of Islam. In recent years, it has also been enjoying something of a resurgence, particularly in the eastern part of the island.

==History==
Both Java and Sumatra were subject to considerable cultural influence from India during the first and second millennia of the Common Era. Both Hinduism and Buddhism, which are both Indian religions and share a common historical background and whose membership may even overlap at times, were widely propagated in the Maritime Southeast Asia.

Hinduism and the Sanskrit language through which it was transmitted, became highly prestigious and the dominant religion in Java. Many Hindu temples were built, including Prambanan near Yogyakarta, which has been designated a World Heritage Site; and Hindu kingdoms flourished, of which the most important was Majapahit.

In the sixth and seventh centuries many maritime kingdoms arose in Sumatra and Java which controlled the waters in the Straits of Malacca and flourished with the increasing sea trade between China and India and beyond. During this time, scholars from India and China visited these kingdoms to translate literary and religious texts.

Majapahit was based in Central Java, from where it ruled a large part of what is now western Indonesia. The remnants of the Majapahit kingdom shifted to Bali during the sixteenth century as Muslim kingdoms in the western part of the island gained influence. Mentions of Hinduism in Java end around the early 16th century.

Although Java was gradually converted to Islam during the 15th century and afterwards, substantial elements of Hindu (and pre-Hindu) customs and beliefs persist among ordinary Javanese. Particularly in central and eastern Java, &quot;Abangan&quot; or &#x27;nominal&#x27; Muslims are predominant. Javanists, who uphold this folk tradition, coexist along with more orthodox Islamicizing elements.

==Survivals==
Hinduism or Hindu-animist fusion have been preserved by a number of Javanese communities, many of which claim descent from Majapahit warriors and princes. The Osings in the Banyuwangi Regency of East Java are a community whose religion shows many similarities to that of Bali.
The Tenggerese communities at the foot of Mount Bromo are officially Hindu, but their religion includes many elements of Buddhism including the worship of Lord Buddha along with Hindu trinity Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. The Badui in Banten have a religion of their own which incorporates Hindu traits. Many Javanese communities still practice Kejawèn, consisting of an amalgam of animistic, Buddhist, and Hindu aspects. Yogyakarta is stronghold of Kejawen.

==Modern Day==
Conversions to Hinduism varies, an example being in two close and culturally similar regions, the Yogyakarta region, where only sporadic conversions to Hinduism had taken place, and the Klaten region, which has witnessed the highest percentage of Hindu converts in Java. It has been argued that this dissimilarity was related to the difference in the perception of Islam among the Javanese population in each region. Since the mass killings of 1965–1966 in Klaten had been far worsel than those in Yogyakarta, in Klaten the political landscape had been more politicized than in Yogyakarta. Because the killers in Klaten were to a large extent identified with Islam, the people in this region did not convert to Islam, but preferred Hinduism (and Christianity). 

Also there is fear for those who are adherent of Javanism of the purge, in order to hide their practices they converted into Hinduism, though they may not entirely practice the religion. Many of the new &quot;Hindus&quot; in Gunung Lawu and Kediri are an example of this.

<doc id="827884" wikidata="Q216773" url="?curid=827884" title="FC Vaduz">
<text>Fussball Club Vaduz (&quot;Football Club Vaduz&quot;) is a professional football club from Vaduz, Liechtenstein that plays in the Swiss Challenge League. The club plays at the national Rheinpark Stadion, which has a capacity of 5,873 when all are seated but has additional standing places in the North and South ends of the ground, giving a total stadium capacity of 7,838.

They currently play in the Swiss Challenge League following relegation from the Swiss Super League after the 2020–21 season. Vaduz is unique in that it represents its own national association in the UEFA Europa Conference League when winning the domestic cup, whilst playing in another country&#x27;s league. This is due to Liechtenstein not organising its own league.

Vaduz has historically had many players from Liechtenstein, many of whom have played for the Liechtenstein national team, but nearly all these players have moved abroad, and now the majority of the first team squad are foreign players from different areas of the world.

On 25 August 2022, after beating Rapid Wien away in Austria, Vaduz made history by qualifying for the Europa Conference League group stage, becoming the first ever club from Liechtenstein to reach the group stages of a UEFA club competition.

==History==
Fussball Club Vaduz was founded on 14 February 1932 in Vaduz, and the club&#x27;s first chairman was Johann Walser. FC Vaduz is the only professional football club in Liechtenstein. In its first training match, which Vaduz played in Balzers on 24 April of that year, the newly born team emerged as 2–1 winners. The club played in Vorarlberger Football Association in Austria for the 1932–33 season. In 1933, Vaduz began playing in Switzerland. Over the years, Vaduz struggled through various tiers of Swiss football and won its first Liechtensteiner Cup in 1949. Vaduz enjoyed a lengthy stay in the Swiss 1. Liga from 1960 to 1973, then the third tier of the Swiss football league system.

Vaduz has been required to pay a fee to the Swiss Football Association in order to participate as a foreign club, around £150,000 a year. There have been calls for this agreement to be revoked, but discussions have meant that a permanent arrangement has now taken place for a Liechtenstein representative to be allowed to participate in the Challenge League or Super League in the future.

From the 2001–02 season, Vaduz played in the Swiss Challenge League (formerly called Nationalliga B), the second tier of the Swiss league system. Since then, Vaduz has remained one of the best-performing teams in the Challenge League and gave serious challenges towards promotion to the Super League, especially in 2004 and 2005, playing two-leg play-offs in both cases. In the 2007–08 season, Vaduz secured promotion to the Swiss Super League on 12 May 2008 by winning the Challenge League on the season&#x27;s final day, giving Liechtenstein a representative at the highest level of Swiss football for the first time. Vaduz, however, was relegated back to the Challenge League after one season in the top flight. Vaduz finally returned to the top level after five years in the Challenge League.

In May 2010, the two Liechtenstein teams, FC Vaduz and USV Eschen/Mauren, decided on better cooperation, especially on the exchange and the development possibilities of the players of both teams. In principle, the agreement should replace the missing substructure at FC Vaduz and promote cooperation in the sense of Liechtenstein football. FC Vaduz is the first address for professional footballers.

In 1992, Vaduz qualified for European football for the first time, entering the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup as Liechtenstein Cup winners, but lost 12–1 on aggregate to Chornomorets Odesa of Ukraine in the qualifying round. In 1996, Vaduz qualified for the first round proper with their first European victory, winning 5–3 on penalties against Universitate Riga of Latvia, after a 2–2 aggregate scoreline, although Vaduz lost their first round tie to Paris Saint-Germain of France 7–0 on aggregate.

After the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup was abolished, Vaduz has annually entered the UEFA Cup (now the UEFA Europa League) as a result of winning the Liechtenstein Cup every year since 1998, except in 2012.

Vaduz came within one second of reaching the first round proper of the UEFA Cup in 2002. With the aggregate scores level and opponents Livingston scheduled to go through on away goals, Vaduz won a late corner. The ball was sent into the box, and Marius Zarn hit a goal-bound shot. However, the referee blew the whistle for full-time just before the ball crossed over the line, and Livingston progressed through under controversial circumstances.

For the 2005–06 season, Mats Gren was the coach. In the first round of the 2005–06 UEFA Cup qualifying, Vaduz defeated Moldovan opponent FC Dacia Chişinău. In the second round they faced Turkish club Beşiktaş J.K., who they were eliminated by.

FC Vaduz started their European campaign in 2009–10 by beating Scottish side Falkirk in the second qualifying round of the Europa League. However, they lost 3–0 on aggregate to Czech side Slovan Liberec in the third qualifying round.

In the 2014–15 Swiss Super League season, Vaduz survived in the Swiss Super League for the first time in their history. They finished in 9th place with 31 points won. They also won their 43rd Liechtenstein cup, becoming world record holders of a domestic cup in the process.

In season 2015–16 FC Vaduz started their European campaign in the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League by beating S.P. La Fiorita from San Marino in the first qualifying round of the Europa League. In the second round, Vaduz progressed against Nõmme Kalju FC to progress into the third qualifying round of the Europa League where they were drawn against fellow Swiss Super League club FC Thun. FC Thun won 2–2 on the away goals rule.

Vaduz won their domestic cup for the forty-fourth time and were eighth in the Swiss Super League. They won a team record thirty-six points. Vaduz player Armando Sadiku represented Albania at Euro 2016.

The team appeared for the first time in a popular sports video game, &quot;FIFA 17&quot;. This was the first time in history that a team from Liechtenstein appeared in the sports video game series.

After three years in the highest tier of Swiss football the 2016–17 season led to Vaduz&#x27;s relegation, replacing Giorgio Contini with German coach Roland Vrabec after almost 5 years at the helm; Vaduz has not reached the Swiss Super League again.

On 5 September 2018, they terminated their contract with Roland Vrabec. On September 17, they presented Mario Frick as their coach. He is the first coach from Liechtenstein in the club&#x27;s history.

In season 2019–20 FC Vaduz started their European campaign in the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League by beating Breiðablik from Iceland in the first qualifying round of the Europa League. In the second round, Vaduz caused a shock by knocking out Hungarian side MOL Fehérvár. In the third qualifying round of the Europa League they played against German club Eintracht Frankfurt- the Bundesliga side easily won both matches. However, these matches were historic for Vaduz, as at the first match in Vaduz there were 5,908 spectators present, while the city as a whole has a population of only 5,521.

On 25 August 2022, after an away victory against Rapid Wien, Vaduz secured qualification for the group stages of the Europa Conference League, becoming the first ever team from Liechtenstein to reach the group stages of a European club competition. They were subsequently drawn into Group E where they played against Dutch side AZ, Cypriot champions Apollon Limassol and Ukrainian side Dnipro-1. After a solid start to the group, with a goalless draw at home to Apollon, Vaduz would only go on and collect one more point, away against Dnipro-1, thus finishing bottom of the group with two points from their six games.

On 20 June 2023, Vaduz drew Belarusian side Neman Grodno in the 2023-24 UEFA Europa Conference League first qualifying round.

==Legal status==
Vaduz is one of several expatriate European football clubs, playing in the Swiss Football League, like AS Monaco playing in France, Victor San Marino playing in Italy and some other minor clubs doing likewise in different leagues. The difference between Vaduz and the aforementioned clubs is that its status in Switzerland is a &quot;guest club&quot;, and as such it does not participate in the Swiss Cup and cannot represent Switzerland internationally, which makes Champions League qualification from league football impossible under current rules other than by winning the Europa League or the Champions League itself. Since Vaduz has never finished higher than 8th in the Super League and therefore could not be argued to have qualified, such a situation has not occurred.

==Stadium==

===Rheinpark Stadion===


The Rheinpark Stadion in Vaduz is the national stadium of Liechtenstein. It plays host to the home matches of the Liechtenstein national football team, and is also the home of Liechtenstein&#x27;s top football club, FC Vaduz. It lies on the banks of the River Rhine, just metres from the border with Switzerland. The stadium has a fully seated capacity of 5,873, plus additional standing places, giving it a total capacity of 7,584. The building of the stadium cost roughly 19 million CHF.

The stadium was officially opened on 31 July 1998 with a match between FC Vaduz, the Liechtenstein Cup holders at the time, and 1. FC Kaiserslautern, the then Bundesliga champions. Kaiserslautern won the match 8–0. Liverpool F.C. played here against Olympiacos F.C. in a friendly in 2005. Rheinpark Stadion hosted the likes of FC Chornomorets Odesa and Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in this tournament but failed to progress past the qualification rounds.

The construction of the stadium became necessary because the world governing body FIFA and the European association UEFA threatened not to allow more European and international matches in Liechtenstein if the country did not provide a modern venue in accordance with international standards. In Liechtenstein, no domestic football league is played, but a cup competition is organized. Its series winner FC Vaduz is therefore represented in the Europa League almost every year. The national team has only been represented in the qualifying rounds of a major competition.

Rheinpark Stadion sits less than 1 km west of Vaduz city centre on the eastern bank of the Rhein River. Vaduz holds the distinction of being one of the few capitals in the world to lack its own airport and railway station, although there is a train station called Schaan-Vaduz in the nearby town of Schaan.

Rheinpark Stadion consists of four stands: North, East, South and West.

There are a limited number of free parking spaces located at Rheinpark Stadion on matchdays which are allocated on a first-come first-served basis.

<doc id="827885" wikidata="Q2378066" url="?curid=827885" title="Danske Bank (Ireland)">
<text>Danske Bank, formerly known as the National Irish Bank, is a bank operating in the Republic of Ireland. The bank is a subsidiary of the Danske Bank Group which is headquartered in Copenhagen.

Danske Bank is organised in three business units – Personal Banking, Business Banking and Corporates &amp; Institutions – that span all of the Group&#x27;s geographical markets. Since November 2012, all of the Group&#x27;s banking activities have been gathered under the Danske Bank brand name. The group&#x27;s websites were brought fully into alignment with the new organisation at the same time.

==History==
National Irish Bank was originally the Republic of Ireland branch network of Northern Bank, one of the oldest banks in Ireland, having been founded as a private partnership in 1809, converting to a joint stock entity in 1824. National Irish Bank was created as a separate entity in 1986, at first under the name Northern Bank (Ireland) Limited, when its owners, UK-based Midland Bank, separated Northern Bank&#x27;s operations in the Republic of Ireland from its Northern Ireland business.

In 1987, both banks were acquired by National Australia Bank (along with Midland Bank&#x27;s Scottish subsidiary, Clydesdale Bank). In 1988 the Republic of Ireland operation was renamed National Irish Bank Limited whilst Northern Bank Limited remained the name of the Northern Ireland operation. Nonetheless, a single management team continued to run both banks, which shared many services and back office functions. During this era, the logo of the National Irish Bank was that of the National Australia Bank (at the time), except that the red star had been recoloured green, and &quot;Irish Bank&quot; was added alongside the word &quot;National&quot;. The original Northern Bank (Ireland) logo had been the Midland Bank griffin device.

===Lacey era: 1988–1994===
In 1988, Jim Lacey had been appointed CEO of NIB. He was briefed to spearhead a campaign to raise the bank’s profile, which included innovations such as lower interest rates. Lacey commissioned a high-profile advertising campaign, featuring fictitious NIB manager Martin, who would repeatedly call his cousin Niall about the great deals the bank was offering.

In 1993, Irish crime lord Martin Cahill planned a raid on NIB, using then CEO Jim Lacey and his family as hostages to extract up to €10 million in cash. In early 1993 John &quot;The Coach&quot; Traynor met with his boss Cahill to provide him with inside information about the inner-workings of NIB at College Green, Dublin. Traynor told Cahill that the bank regularly held more than €10 million in cash in the building. The plan was to abduct Lacey, his wife and four children and take them to an isolated hiding place. There they would be held with fellow gang member, but acting as a &quot;hostage&quot; Jo Jo Kavanagh, who would frighten Lacey into handing over every penny stored in the bank&#x27;s vaults.

On 1 November 1993, Cahill&#x27;s gang that included Brian Meehan seized Lacey and his wife outside his home in Blackrock. Holding them at Lacey&#x27;s home, Kavanagh was brought in and tied up, telling the family that he had been abducted two weeks before. On 2 November, Kavanagh drove Lacey to College Green to collect the ransom money, with Lacey eventually withdrawing IR£300,000 from an accessible cash machine. Kavanagh then drove the pair and the money to the local Garda station, where he told them the pair had been kidnapped and forced to take part in a robbery.

With a ransom note requesting payment of €10 million in cash, the Gardaí began investigating. They quickly found that Kavanagh had claimed child allowance during his two-week &quot;capture,&quot; and so arrested him. Cahill then planned with Kavanagh to &quot;raid&quot; Kavanagh&#x27;s home, and show intent to kill the Lacey family by shooting Kavanagh in the leg. Kavanagh was then to call the Irish newspapers from his hospital bed, and claim he was a victim of the Lacey kidnapping gang.

However, the plan failed, and the gang were arrested. Released on bail, in 1994, Cahill was murdered by a claimed Irish Republican Army hitman close to his home in Rathmines, who had been paid for by rival drug gang crime lord and former Cahill gang member John Gilligan. In 1997, Kavanagh was jailed for 12 years for offences connected with the Lacey kidnapping.

===1998 Inspection===
Dismissed by National Australia Bank in 1994, Lacey was subsequently appointed CEO of publishers Lafferty, and also appointed chairman of the Irish Aviation Authority and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. However, he resigned these positions in 1998 after a report on RTÉ was further investigated by High Court of the Republic of Ireland. After subsequently appointing inspectors in Dublin, Their report conclusions were:

* Bogus non-resident accounts in some branches enabled customers to evade tax
* Investment policies were promoted for funds undisclosed to the Revenue Commissioners
* Special Savings Accounts had Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) deducted at a reduced rate. Note: this point may be incorrect as the legal SSA product was designed to have DIRT deducted at a lower rate. Budget legislation over the past number of years has brought the reduced DIRT rate up and the standard DIRT down to a point where they both currently meet i.e.: 20%.
* There was improper charging of interest or fees to some customers. (The bank has refunded all customers who the Inspectors alleged had been mischarged.)

Following the Inspectors&#x27; report, the Director of Corporate Enforcement took disqualification proceedings against nine former NIB personnel, none of whom has been employed by NIB since the 1990s.

==Changes under Danske==
On 1 March 2005, Danske formally took control of National Irish Bank. It announced as its first act that the Northern Bank and National Irish Bank would be fully separated from each other, with a new management team appointed to National Irish Bank. The bank changed over to the Danske Bank technology platform.

The bank adopted the logo of Danske Bank, albeit with the word &quot;Danske&quot; replaced by &quot;National Irish&quot;. The bank was formally relaunched on 18 April, with a new product offering, and a revamped internet banking system. Among the innovations is the use of text messages to communicate with customers.

In June 2005, Andrew Healy was appointed chief executive officer of National Irish Bank.

In January 2007, Danske Bank announced that the banking business of National Irish Bank Limited would be transferred to Danske Bank A/S, Irish Branch. The practical effect of this was that from 1 April 2007 National Irish Bank was no longer regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland but by the Danish Financial Services Authority, as NIB was now to be a division of Danske Bank rather than a separate subsidiary.

In December 2009, National Irish Bank announced that it was launching a restructuring programme, this would involve closing 25 of its branches and also changing is banking model.

Beginning in early 2010, National Irish Bank began moving away from a &#x27;Cash Bank&#x27; to &#x27;Cashless&#x27;. The first of these branches to go cashless were Malahide and Dun Laoghaire branches.
By the middle of 2011 National Irish Bank became a completely cashless bank and no longer accepts cash for lodgments. The bank announced that they would be looking at possible third parties to accept cash lodgments.

Further on from the announcement that National Irish Bank would be moving towards a cash-free operation, An Post was announced as the third party who will accept lodgments on behalf of NIB. This came into effect from 1 November. It meant that all National Irish Bank customers will be able to lodge cash they may have in any An Post office around the country, currently there are over 1,200 An Post branches in ROI.

===Reintegration with Northern Bank and rebrand===

On 10 May 2012, Danske Bank announced that Northern Bank and National Irish Bank would be reintegrated on 1 June 2012, under the Northern Bank management team and the Danske Bank name, effectively reversing the separation between the two. The rebrand was completed on 18 November 2012. At the time the bank closed its 27 branches to focus on corporate and private clients, subsequently pulling out of the personal/retail banking market completely.

==Tiger robbery, August 2006==
The Killester, Dublin branch (known as Howth Road branch) of National Irish Bank was the scene of a &#x27;tiger robbery&#x27; on 29 August 2006 when a 23-year-old employee was kidnapped by an armed gang. The bank handed over a ransom of €270,000 without informing or involving the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána heavily criticised this action, stating that it leaves the bank exposed in the future to replica attacks.

==Closure of personal banking==
On 31 October 2013 Danske Bank announced it would be withdrawing all personal banking services in the Republic of Ireland on a phased basis in the first half of 2014.

<doc id="827887" wikidata="Q192648" url="?curid=827887" title="Raymond Domenech">
<text>Raymond Manuel Albert Domenech (born 24 January 1952) is a French football manager and former player. He managed the France national team from 2004 to 2010, reaching the 2006 FIFA World Cup final. He was dismissed after their elimination from the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for serious misconduct.

==Managerial career==
===France U-21 national team===
Domenech replaced Marc Bourrier as coach of the France national under-21 football team in 1993.

His first major tournament was the 1994 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, which France hosted. France had qualified after topping their group in qualification, nine points above second-placed Sweden. At the tournament, France defeated Russia in the quarter-finals but lost to Italy in a penalty shootout at the semifinal stage. Italy went on to win the final against Portugal.

France qualified for the 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Championship after finishing first in their qualifying group. France defeated Germany in the quarter-finals. Italy again knocked out the French side at the semi-final stage, the lone goal coming from Francesco Totti. Italy retained their title, defeating Spain in the final.

After finishing third at the 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, France qualified for the 1996 Olympics as one of the top five European nations. France finished top of their group with victories over Australia and Saudi Arabia, and a draw with Spain. At the quarter-finals, France were eliminated 2–1 by Portugal after a golden goal was scored from the penalty spot by José Calado.

France failed to qualify for the 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Championship after finishing second in their qualifying group behind Norway. France&#x27;s final game of qualifying was at home against Norway, with France having needed at least a draw to top their group. Norway produced a 3–2 upset win to qualify above France. Norway went on to finish third at the tournament after being eliminated by champions Spain in the semi-finals.

Domenech was again unsuccessful in qualifying for the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. This time France topped their qualifying group and progressed to the playoffs, where they were drawn against Italy. The first leg in France ended 1–1, and the second leg in Italy ended 1–1 after 90 minutes. The game went into extra time where Andrea Pirlo produced the winning goal for Italy in the 110th minute. Italy would go on to be champions at the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

Domenech briefly coached the France national under-20 football team at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship. During the group stage, France defeated Iran, and had draws with Paraguay and Ghana. France progressed from the group stage after finishing second behind Ghana. France defeated Germany 3–2 in the Round of 16 thanks to a goal from Djibril Cissé in the 90+3rd minute. France were eliminated in the quarter-finals after a 3–1 loss to hosts and eventual champions Argentina.

France qualified for the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship after finishing first in their qualifying group and defeating Romania in the play-offs. France were undefeated during qualifying. France won all their group matches at the tournament against Czech Republic, Belgium and Greece. France progressed to the final after defeating Switzerland in their semifinal. France met Czech Republic again, but this time the Czech side were victorious in a penalty shootout after the game ended at 0–0 after extra time.

France were dominant in the group stage of qualifying for the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. They finished first in their group with seven wins, one draw, no losses and no goals conceded. They were drawn against Portugal in the play-offs and won the first leg in Portugal 2–1. However, Portugal won 2–1 away from home in the second leg, sending the game to extra time. Djibril Cissé had been sent off just before halftime. There were no goals in extra time, so the match was decided by a penalty shootout. Portugal won the shootout, with their final penalty kick being scored by Cristiano Ronaldo. Portugal would go on to finish third at the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

===France senior national team===
====2006 World Cup====
On 12 July 2004, Domenech was a surprise choice to succeed Jacques Santini after the country&#x27;s disappointing exit from UEFA Euro 2004 by losing in the quarter-final match to the eventual tournament-upset winners Greece. He beat the two other shortlisted candidates, Jean Tigana and Laurent Blanc.

France struggled in the qualifiers, even though the team was seeded in a group that included the relatively unheralded teams of Israel and Switzerland. Domenech persuaded Claude Makélélé, Lilian Thuram and Zidane, members of France&#x27;s &quot;golden generation&quot;, out of international retirement to aid the national team. It paid off and they qualified for the finals. On the final day of fixtures, France qualified automatically with a 4–0 home win over Cyprus.

Domenech fell out with Vikash Dhorasoo after he made a behind the scenes film called &quot;Substitute&quot;. His decision to leave out Barcelona star Ludovic Giuly in favour of Franck Ribéry, and subsequent refusal to explain that decision, left many French players and fans mystified. Domenech&#x27;s selection for France&#x27;s World Cup squad was further criticised when he publicly announced that Fabien Barthez would start ahead of Lyon goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. This decision was met with derision in the French press and also led to Coupet walking out of the national squad before the tournament, although he later returned. Domenech also excluded Roma centre-back Philippe Mexès from his 2006 and 2008 squads, taking along the likes of Jean-Alain Boumsong in his place.

France had a slow start in the World Cup, recording draws against Switzerland and South Korea before finally defeating Togo. France then knocked out Spain, Brazil, and Portugal. France lost the final to Italy in a penalty shoot-out following a 1–1 draw after extra time. Recalled golden generation veterans Zidane and Thuram earned spots on the All-Star Team, with Zidane being awarded the Golden Ball for the best player of the tournament despite receiving a red card in the final (the voting was done before Zidane received the red card).

====Euro 2008====
On 27 August 2007, Claude Makélélé&#x27;s club manager, José Mourinho, stated that Domenech was treating Makélélé &quot;like a slave,&quot; since Domenech had called him up for Euro 2008 qualifiers even though Makélélé had announced his retirement after the 2006 World Cup. Domenech responded: &quot;As long as he can walk, he will play. I have the right to pick him.&quot; France ended up last in their UEFA Euro 2008 Group C and failed to advance in the tournament after losing to Italy 2–0.

Domenech proposed on live television to his girlfriend Estelle Denis after France&#x27;s elimination. He later admitted that this was unprofessional.

====2010 World Cup====
France qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup only after defeating the Republic of Ireland in a play-off. The game was controversial, as Thierry Henry handled the ball before setting up William Gallas to score the winning goal.

In the first game of the finals, France drew with Uruguay 0–0. Following their draw with Uruguay, Zidane described Domenech as having lost control of the team. The draw was then followed by a 2–0 defeat to Mexico, during which striker Nicolas Anelka reportedly directed an expletive-laden tirade at Domenech. Anelka was dismissed from the team the next day. The day after Anelka&#x27;s dismissal, team captain Patrice Evra and team trainer Robert Duverne had a heated confrontation that caused Domenech to physically restrain Duverne; the players responded by returning to the team bus and refusing to continue with practice. After the French Football Federation condemned the player boycott, the team returned to practice without further incident. France&#x27;s World Cup campaign ended with a 2–1 defeat to hosts South Africa, meaning &quot;Les Bleus&quot; finished at the bottom of Group A without winning a single game. Domenech bowed out by refusing to shake the hand of South Africa&#x27;s coach Carlos Alberto Parreira.

Domenech was dismissed for serious misconduct following the World Cup. He sought €2.9 million compensation, eventually receiving €975,000.

===Later career===
In November 2010, Domenech began coaching the under-11 team at Boulogne-Billancourt. In December 2011, Domenech donated €70,000 of his €150,000 World Cup bonus to the club, with the remaining €80,000 being donated to charity and an inner-city football club from Paris.

In April 2018, he was one of 77 applicants for the vacant Cameroon national team job. In December 2020, he expressed a wish to succeed Ljubiša Tumbaković as the Serbia national team coach.

On 26 December 2020, ten years after last managing a team, Domenech signed with Ligue 1 side Nantes. On 10 February 2021, Domenech was released of his duties as head coach after not winning a single game in his eight matches in charge.

==Personal life==

Domenech was previously in a civil relationship with French TV presenter Estelle Denis, whom he met at the studios of channel Infosport+. Domenech proposed to Denis on live television on 17 June 2008, after France&#x27;s elimination from UEFA Euro 2008. The couple have two children, a daughter born in 2004 and a son born in 2007. The couple separated in 2020.

Domenech is of Catalan descent. He is fascinated by astrology, and believes that people&#x27;s personalities are shaped by star signs. He has denied rumours that he picked squads based on astrology, or that he dropped Robert Pires for being a Scorpio, instead saying that the 30-year-old Arsenal winger was declining and a bad influence on the squad.

<doc id="827889" wikidata="Q2072279" url="?curid=827889" title="White pride">
<text>White pride and white power are expressions primarily used by white separatist, white nationalist, fascist, neo-Nazi, and white supremacist organizations in order to signal racist or racialist viewpoints. It is also a slogan used by the prominent post–Ku Klux Klan group Stormfront and a term used to make racist/racialist viewpoints more palatable to the general public who may associate historical abuses with the terms &quot;white nationalist&quot;, &quot;neo-Nazi&quot;, and &quot;white supremacist&quot;.

Some advocates of white power have been committed to overthrowing the United States government and establishing a white ethnostate using paramilitary tactics.

== Provenance ==
Sociologists Betty A. Dobratz and Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile identified &quot;White Power! White Pride!&quot; as &quot;a much-used chant of white separatist movement supporters&quot;, and sociologist Mitch Berbrier has identified the use of this phrase as part of a &quot;new racist ... frame-transformation and frame-alignment by (a) consciously packaging a &#x27;hate-free&#x27; racism, (b) developing strategies of equivalence and reversal–presenting whites as equivalent to ethnic and racial minorities, and (c) deploying ideas about &#x27;love,&#x27; &#x27;pride,&#x27; and &#x27;heritage-preservation&#x27; to evidence both their putative lack of animosity toward others as well as their ethnic credentials.&quot; In a social psychology experiment that tested how white participants could be influenced to identify with white pride ideology, social psychologists framed white pride as follows:

Sociologists Monica McDermott and Frank L. Samson documented the rhetorical evolution of white pride movements thus, &quot;Because white pride has historically been predicated upon a denigration of nonwhites, the articulation of the duties and requirements of whiteness reflects a desire to correlate a conscious white identity with positive attributes.&quot;

== Use as an identity marker ==
Political and social scientists commonly argue that the idea of &quot;white pride&quot; is an attempt to provide a clean or more palatable public face for white supremacy or white separatism and that it is an appeal to a larger audience in hopes of inciting more widespread racial violence. According to Joseph T. Roy of the Southern Poverty Law Center, white supremacists often circulate material on the internet and elsewhere that &quot;portrays the groups not as haters, but as simple white pride civic groups concerned with social ills&quot;. 

Philosopher David Ingram argues that &quot;affirming &#x27;black pride&#x27; is not equivalent to affirming &#x27;white pride,&#x27; since the former—unlike the latter—is a defensive strategy aimed at rectifying a negative stereotype&quot;. By contrast, then, &quot;affirmations of white pride—however thinly cloaked as affirmations of ethnic pride—serve to mask and perpetuate white privilege&quot;. In the same vein, Professor of Education at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Cris Mayo, characterizes white pride as &quot;a politically distasteful goal, given that whiteness is not a personal or community identity, but has been a strategy to maintain inequities of privilege and power.&quot;


Political scientists Carol M. Swain and Russell Nieli, in their text on white nationalism, identify the idea of &quot;white pride&quot; as a relatively new phenomenon in the United States. They argue that over the course of the 1990s, &quot;a new white pride, white protest, and white consciousness movement has developed in America&quot;. They identify three contributing factors: an immigrant influx during the 1980s and 1990s, resentment over affirmative action policies, and the growth of the Internet as a tool for the expression and mobilization of grievances. According to Janet E. Helms, founding director of Boston College&#x27;s Institute for the Study and Promotion of Race and Culture, a white person &quot;must become aware of his or her Whiteness, accept it as personally and socially significant ... Not in the sense of Klan members&#x27; &#x27;white pride&#x27; but in the context of a commitment to a just society.&quot; Among people who strongly identify as white, research differentiates between a power cognizant group and a prideful group. The prideful group is more likely to devalue diversity and to show prejudice, while the power cognizant group is more likely to value diversity.

Sociologist Luigi Esposito of Barry University writes that &quot;the emphasis on white pride or white identity resonates with supporters of the alt-right because racial tribalism is regarded as an antidote to the neoliberal emphasis on competitive individualism and self-serving behavior that presumably threatens the interests of whites.&quot;

== Racist context ==

The slogan &quot;White Pride Worldwide&quot; appears on the logo of Stormfront, a website owned and operated by Don Black, who was formerly a Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The North Georgia White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan describe themselves as &quot;a patriotic, White Christian revival movement dedicated to preserving the maintenance of White Pride and the rights of the White Race&quot;. A 2002 study identified white pride as a motivation for racial hate crimes on a US college campus, while in a different study on internet racism, the slogan was identified as being part of an emerging transnationalist trend in white supremacist movements. The slogan was also documented to have been used in hate speech incidents at New York University, Vassar College, Temple University, the University of Oregon, and the University of Tennessee, and it was a slogan used in posters put up by a white supremacist organization at dozens of US colleges.

Certain Denver Nuggets jerseys were named &quot;white pride&quot; by Adidas and were listed as such on the team&#x27;s website in 2016, after which internet outcry prompted the team to rename the jerseys. Similarly, a fitness room in River Falls, Wisconsin was renamed to avoid the racist connotations of it being referred to as the &quot;White Pride Fitness Room&quot;. The slogan was chanted along with &quot;White Power&quot; by up to 100 neo-Nazis rallying in Manchester, United Kingdom in March 2015 and was the theme of a March 2016 event in Swansea and a March 2017 event in Edinburgh, all of which were organized by the National Front. In an exposé from &quot;The Week&quot;, James Poulos warned that &quot;Europe is on track to rediscover what looks to us like a highly unsettling form of white pride.&quot;

<text>Longford Town Football Club is an Irish professional football club based in Longford, County Longford. The club, which was founded in 1924 and elected to the league in 1984, plays in the League of Ireland First Division as of 2025. 

The club plays its home matches at Strokestown Road, which for sponsorship reasons is also known as Bishopsgate. The club colours are red and black, and it sometimes goes by the nickname &#x27;De Town&#x27;. Its crest contains a silhouette of St Mel&#x27;s Cathedral in Longford.

Longford Town has won several domestic competitions, including the League of Ireland First Division (in 2014), FAI Cup (in 2003 and 2004) and League of Ireland Cup (in 2004).

==History==
Following a number of meetings held earlier in the year, Longford Town Football Club was formally founded in October 1924 at a meeting held at the pavilion in Longford Park. It was decided that the club colours were to be similar to those of the Dublin club, Bohemians, &#x27;Red and Black&#x27;.

Longford Town had £24 in the kitty to start off and their first big success was winning the Leinster Junior Cup in the 1930–31 season when they beat St. Malachy&#x27;s of Dundalk at Longford Park. After the game, the Foresters Brass and Reed Band and Longford Pipe and Drum Band led the victory parade through the streets of the town. The Longford team included Tom O’Beirne, Packy Shine, Mel Deane, Jimmy Malynn, John Dennigan, Jimmy and Billy Clarke, Freddy Dykes and Jimmy Breslin. In the 1935–36 season, the Town were promoted to Division 1 of the Leinster Senior League. The following season saw the Town clinch the FAI Intermediate Cup which was a considerable achievement coming so soon after promotion from the Junior ranks. Further Intermediate Cup successes, as well as Metropolitan Cup wins, followed in the 1950s and 1960s.

Then a non-league side, Longford Town reached the final of the Leinster Senior Cup in 1954. They lost the final, played at Dalymount Park on St. Stephen&#x27;s Day (26 December 1954), 2–1 to Shamrock Rovers. Rovers, then at their peak, got the winning goal with less than three minutes to go.

A number of Longford players received International or inter-league honours over the years. Mel Deane was the first, when he was capped against Scotland in a Junior International. Then followed Junior International honours versus England for Jimmy and Paddy Clarke, as well as Youth International caps for Ignatius Branigan (against Holland) and Teffia Park&#x27;s Mark Devlin.

The club was 60 years in existence before its election to the League of Ireland in 1984. In their first season in the league they finished last in the Premier Division and were one of the four sides to be relegated to the newly created First Division for the following season. In their second season, they finished bottom of the First Division with only 7 points. Town finished in the bottom six of the ten-team First Division in each of the next eleven seasons.
The appointment of the then 26-year-old rookie manager Stephen Kenny in the summer of 1998 proved the catalyst for a major upturn in the club&#x27;s fortunes on the pitch. In the 1998/99 season, they missed out a place in the promotion/relegation play-off by just four points. The following season saw further improvement when the club finished in second place and, as a result, won promotion to the Premier Division. This was secured on the final day of the season, 22 April 2000, with a 2–0 victory away to Cobh Ramblers. The starting XI was: Stephen O&#x27;Brien, Enda Kenny, Wes Byrne (captain), Paul McNally, Stephen Kelly, Paul Perth, Vinny Perth, Stephen Gavin, Shay Zellor, Keith O&#x27;Connor and Richie Parsons.

Longford performed admirably in their first season back in the Premier Division finishing in mid-table. That season also saw the club reach the FAI Cup Final for the first time, where they lost 1–0 to Bohemians. As Bohemians had also won the league title that season, Longford qualified to play in the UEFA Cup in July 2001. A meeting over two games with Bulgarian club side PFC Litex Lovech ended in a 3–1 aggregate victory for the Bulgarians.

Things were less comfortable in the league during the 2001/02 season after that, as they ended up in the relegation/promotion play-off, where they played Finn Harps in a two-legged affair. Longford won in a penalty shootout after the tie ended 3–3 on aggregate. After the 2002/03 season, the club became an established top division side, led by manager Alan Mathews, with four successive top-six finishes.

In October 2003, the Town clinched their first title in senior football when winning the FAI Cup following a 2–0 victory over St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic at Lansdowne Road. The winning Longford side Stephen O&#x27;Brien, Alan Murphy, Barry Ferguson (captain), Brian McGovern, Seán Dillon, Alan Kirby, Vinny Perth, Philip Keogh, Sean Prunty, Shane Barrett and Sean Francis – with Barrett and Francis as goal-scorers. The victory &quot;[made] up for their eircom League Cup final defeat&quot;, against the same opposition, earlier in the 2003 season.

2004 would prove to be the most successful year in the club&#x27;s history. The Town produced a cup double by first winning the League Cup with a 2–1 victory over Bohemians, in a final held in Longford, with the crucial second goal scored by local player Seán Prunty. The FAI Cup was retained following a dramatic 2–1 win over Waterford United at Lansdowne Road on 24 October 2004. Trailing with five minutes to go, late goals by Waterford-born Alan Kirby and sub Paul Keegan meant a &quot;sensational finish&quot; for Longford Town. The starting XI was: Stephen O&#x27;Brien (captain), Alan Murphy, Graham Gartland, Seán Dillon, Sean Prunty, Dean Fitzgerald, John Martin, Alan Kirby, Shane Barrett, Dessie Baker and Eric Lavine.

The FAI Cup successes saw the club enter the UEFA Cup in both 2004 and 2005. On both occasions, however, they lost in the first qualifying round on aggregate.

The 2007 season was a disappointing one for the club as, along with losing the FAI Cup final to Cork City, the team were relegated after finishing bottom of the Premier Division. That does not tell the whole story however, as Longford were deducted six league points during the season for failing to comply with club licensing procedures. These six points proved crucial in the end as, without this deduction, they would have finished safe from relegation and the relegation play-off.
This cost the club dearly, as there followed six years in the First Division, before being promoted as champions at the end of the 2014 season. The title was clinched, under the management of Tony Cousins, following a resounding 5–0 victory at home to Shamrock Rovers B on 3 October 2014. This league title triumph was the club&#x27;s first-ever in senior football with the trophy presented to club captain Mark Salmon. The goals of David O&#x27;Sullivan and Gary Shaw, along with the contribution of the experienced quartet of Pat Sullivan, Pat Flynn, Stephen Rice and Kevin O&#x27;Connor, were pivotal in the season&#x27;s success.

In their first season back in the Premier Division, the club finished off the 2015 season in 6th position. However, Longford finished bottom of the 2016 Premier Division table and were relegated back to the First Division.

The 2020 League of Ireland First Division season was suspended after a few weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Longford had played, and won, their two opening league matches before the suspension in March. It wasn&#x27;t until 31 July, after a break of almost five months, that matches resumed. Finishing the league season in fourth place saw the side enter the promotion play-off series. Victories over UCD and Galway United set up a final appearance against Shelbourne on 15 November 2020. A Rob Manley goal earned a 1–0 win for the Town to secure promotion back to the Premier Division for 2021. The 2021 season was a difficult one for the club, with the side bottom of the table for most of the year and relegated with several matches remaining.

In 2024, the club celebrated its 100th year in existence. To mark the milestone, a Longford Town legends game against Manchester United legends took place on 15 June 2024; it finished 3-3.

<doc id="827891" wikidata="Q753025" url="?curid=827891" title="Car tuning">
<text>Car tuning is the modification of a car to optimise it for a different set of performance requirements from those it was originally designed to meet. Most commonly this is higher engine performance and dynamic handling characteristics but cars may also be altered to provide better fuel economy, or smoother response. The goal when tuning is the improvement of a vehicle&#x27;s overall performance in response to the user&#x27;s needs. Often, tuning is done at the expense of emissions performance, component reliability and occupant comfort.

As a culture has grown around modified cars the term tuning has grown to encompass the cosmetic and stylistic changes owners make to personalize their vehicles. These changes can range from functional modifications designed to improve the performance or functionality of the car, to visual modifications which alter the aesthetics of the car and, in the case of certain mods, sometimes be detrimental to the performance or functionality of the car.

==Origin==

Since their invention, cars have always been subject to modification. Most of the earliest cars were made individually by hand and not by a factory, and as such there was little meaningful distinction yet between factory, custom and aftermarket changes to a car. However, as mass production of cars began to rise, this distinction emerged. Some of the earliest examples of cars modified from their original specifications for improved performance were cars modified for racing or off-roading. In the early 1900s, some of the most popular cars to modify for racing were Ford Model Ts and Model As, often modified to race on dirt tracks and dry lake beds. Some of the earliest dedicated offroad vehicles were made using the Kégresse track system, starting in the late 1910s, which affixed tracks to an ordinary car in place of the rear wheels for improved off-road traction.

The term &quot;tuning&quot; has been in use throughout most of the 20th century to refer to the maintenance and modification of various mechanical systems on a car&#x27;s engine, with &quot;tune-ups&quot; being a common service offered by mechanics. The terms &quot;tuning&quot; and &quot;tuner car&quot; began to rise in popularity in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to the rise of people modifying foreign cars, typically Japanese cars. This was contrasted against the previously predominant culture of car customization that grew primarily around customizing domestically produced American cars.

==Areas of modification==
The essence of modification of a tuner car is an attempt at a significant performance increase—or the appearance of high performance—from a stock motor vehicle through the addition, alteration or outright replacement of parts. Although this largely involves modifying the engine and management systems of the vehicle to increase power output, additional changes are often required to allow the vehicle to handle such power, including stiffened suspension, widened tires, better brakes, and improved steering and transmission modifications. Although largely insignificant in terms of appearance, certain modifications such as low-profile tires, altered suspension, and the addition of spoilers can change the overall appearance of the car, as well as adding downforce to increase traction.

===Audio===
A stock audio system is one specified by the manufacturer when the vehicle was built in the factory. A custom audio installation can involve anything from the upgrade of the radio to a full customization based around specific audio equipment. Events are held where entrants compete for the loudest, highest-quality audio reception or most innovative sound systems. Some common modifications include higher quality speakers and subwoofers, amplifiers, and better wiring.

===Interior===

Race cars competing in various classes must adhere to a strict set of regulations. As in some well-known racing events, like NASCAR and NHRA, sanctioned events often require a minimum vehicle weight. In such cases, the interior is stripped, and the required weight is achieved by adding ballast, allowing precise control over weight distribution. Along with weight requirements, safety requirements are present. Requirements differ for different classes. Roll cages, fire extinguishers, reinforced bucket seats, seat harnesses, and the like are some of the required safety modifications. Roll cages may be difficult to install when the stock interior is present.

Some tuners will have &quot;gutted&quot; interiors, or omit features that many ordinary drivers would find desirable or necessary, such as audio systems, air conditioning and soundproofing, in order to reduce vehicle weight.

===Engine tuning===
Engine tuning is the process of modifying the operating characteristics of an engine. In a typical engine set-up, there are various mechanical and electronic elements such as the intake manifold, spark plugs, and mass air flow sensor. Modern engines employ the use of an engine control unit to provide the best balance between performance and emissions. Via the OBD communications protocol, electronically controlled aspects of the engine can be modified in a process known as mapping. Mapping can either be performed by changing the software within the ECU (chip tuning via firmware modification), or by providing false data via plug-in hardware. Other standalone engine management systems are available; these systems replace the factory computer with one that is user-programmable. Engine tuning often involves the use of a dynamometer in order to provide, base-line performance and post tuning metrics.

Mechanical components of the engine can also be added or replaced, such as forced induction systems like turbochargers or superchargers.

Improper, incorrect and poorly executed engine modifications can have a detrimental effect on performance and reliability. Mechanical and electrical components can suffer or simply fail as a result. An example would be the use of an air compressor such as a turbocharger to increase the volume of air used in the power stroke of the Otto cycle. In a typical chemical reaction, the air–fuel ratio must be a minimum of 14:1. If higher ratios are used, higher pressures and temperatures are observed in the cylinders, which can quickly push an engine beyond its intended design limits.

Neglecting such operating parameters can lead to premature failures, such as warped cylinder heads and walls, disintegrated piston rings, cracked or bent connecting rods and crankshafts, total cooling system failure, engine fire, engine knocking, engine seizing, and even blowouts. This can all lead to very expensive repairs, as well as being very dangerous.

===Suspension tuning===
Suspension tuning involves modifying the springs, shock absorbers, anti-roll bars, and other related components. Shorter springs offer greater stiffness and a lower center of gravity at the possible cost of unwanted changes of suspension geometry. Stiffer shock absorbers improve dynamic weight shifting during cornering and normally have shorter internals to stop them from bottoming out when shorter springs are used. Stiffer sway bars reduce body roll during cornering, thus improving the grip that the tires have on the surface by reducing suspension geometry changes caused by roll; this also improves handling response due to faster weight shifting—similar to stiffer springs.

The danger with overly stiff anti-roll bars is the lifting of the inner wheel, causing a loss of traction. By increasing the roll resistance of one end of the car, weight transfer is concentrated at that end, causing it to slip more than the other. This effect is used to control the over/understeer characteristic as well as to reduce roll. Other components that are sometimes added are strut bars, which improve body stiffness and help better maintain proper suspension geometry during cornering. On some cars, certain braces or anti-roll bars can be retrofitted to base model cars from sports models.

For offroad vehicles, the emphasis is on lengthening the suspension travel and installing larger tires. Larger tires—with or without larger wheels—increase ground clearance, travel over rough terrain more smoothly, provide additional cushioning, and decrease ground pressure (which is important on soft surfaces).

These suspension modifications are in contrast to lowriders, which use hydraulic or pneumatic suspensions. Lowriders use another type of suspension tuning in which the height of each individual wheel can be rapidly adjusted by a system of rams which, in some cases, makes it possible to &quot;bounce&quot; the wheels completely off of the ground.

===Body tuning===

Body tuning involves making modifications to the body of the car in order to alter the aesthetics of the car, improve performance, or both. Body tuning can also involve changing or replacing parts for better aerodynamic performance. Through downforce, cornering speeds and tire adhesion can be improved, often at the expense of increased drag. To lighten the vehicle, bodywork components such as hoods and rearview mirrors may be replaced with lighter-weight components.

Often, body modifications are done mainly to improve a vehicle&#x27;s appearance, as in the case of non-functioning scoops, wide arches or other aesthetic modifications. Aftermarket spoilers or body kits rarely improve a car&#x27;s performance. The majority, in fact, add weight and increase the drag coefficient of the vehicle, thus reducing its overall performance.

Dating back to the 1940s, techniques such as chopping and channeling were a popular method of modifying a car&#x27;s aerodynamics and styling.

Increasing the wheel track width through spacers and wide body kits, or lowering the center of gravity via suspension modifications, can enhance the car&#x27;s cornering ability. Often, suspension tuners unfamiliar with spring dynamics will cut stock springs, producing a harder, bouncy ride. It is also common to stance a car, lowering it beyond its optimal ride height purely for appearance.

Competition cars may have lightweight windows, or the windows may be completely removed, as auto glass adds significant weight and detrimentally alters weight distribution. Plastic windows are much more vulnerable to scratches, which reduce service life.
===Tires===
Tires have large effects on a car&#x27;s behavior and are replaced periodically; therefore, tire selection is a cost-effective way to personalize an automobile. Choices include tires for various weather and road conditions, different sizes and various compromises between cost, grip, service life, rolling resistance, handling and ride comfort. Drivers also sometimes personalize tires for aesthetic reasons, for example, by adding tire lettering.

===Detuning===
Detuning is the process returning a modified car to its original factory status, or reducing its performance in a particular area of tuning. For example, a car may be &quot;detuned&quot; to allow increased traction when the track grip is not sufficient to handle the increased power of the tuned engine.

==Styles of modification==
Modified cars can be significantly different from their stock counterparts, as a result a common factor among owners/modifiers is to emulate the visual and/or performance characteristics of established styles and design principles; though the similarities may not be intentional. As a result, there are now many different styles and visual influences to car modification, some of which are:

* Rat style: The characteristics of the rat rod style of hot rod and custom cars. Usually imitating the appearance of being &quot;unfinished&quot; known of some hot rods in the 40s, 50s and 60s.
* Hot rod style: The characteristics of early hot rods from the 1930s and 1940s. Largely consists of period specific vehicles, components and finishes. May also include the associated styles of Street rods and Custom cars.
* Modern styles: The recently established modification styles such as the Import scene, Lowriders, European (Euro-style), DUB, Cal Look; most of which are largely visually oriented.
* Cultural/media styles: The characteristics specific to cultures, stereotypes and media such Boy racers and film specific cars; however these characteristics are often largely based on other modification styles.
* Production car styles: The characteristics of production vehicles, such as current-model and luxury cars, Sports cars, Supercars and Muscle cars; largely with the intent of improving or updating a vehicles appearance and/or technology to current market preferences.
* Purpose built/racing car styles: The characteristics of racing cars or other purpose built vehicles such as those of touring car racing, Rallying, Drifting (motorsport) and Drag racing.

==Legal requirements==
Many countries or municipalities have legal requirements which govern vehicle modifications. For example, all vehicles in Victoria, Australia, must conform to construction standards to ensure vehicle safety. There are also restrictions for P Plate drivers which can prevent young drivers from driving modified vehicles.

Many developed countries have smog regulations, which generally forbid any modifications to engines or related components unless the modifications themselves are certified, like production car models. Such modifications, even if they do not actually result in increased emissions, prevent legal use on public roads.

==Sanctioning organizations==
Various organizations involved in competitive motorsports such as the FIA, SFI, NHRA, and IHRA, amongst others, act as sanctioning bodies to establish safety guidelines for racing events, series, tracks, vehicles, and parts. The FIA is the largest international motorsports governing body, with FIA certification being required for a number of parts, particularly safety equipment, in FIA sanctioned events, as well as in many non FIA events.

<text>Hinduism in Sulawesi has been a relatively recent phenomenon, compared to the other islands of Indonesia where it has been a part of the culture for millennia. Indonesian Hinduism was brought to the islands in 1963, by Balinese migrants.

==Growth==
After Hindu Dharma was brought to the island, it took hold in many areas, especially after Hinduism became a recognized religion in 1964. In 1977 the Torajas of the island converted to Hinduism &quot;en masse&quot;. In Southeast Sulawesi, only 1.1% of the inhabitants identify as Hindus.

==Practices==
The Torajas have continued many practices of animist nature, but their conversion to Hinduism has allowed them to keep on their traditions within the framework of an organized religion. Their conversion was hastened by the sudden proliferation of Christian missionaries in the area, trying to woo people away from their native beliefs. The practices are more traditionalist in nature, as opposed to Balinese Hinduism and Indian Hinduism.

<doc id="827905" wikidata="Q2821332" url="?curid=827905" title="Abdollah Nouri">
<text>Abdollah Noori ( ) is an Iranian cleric and reformist politician. Despite his &quot;long history of service to the Islamic Republic,&quot; he became the most senior Islamic politician to be sentenced to prison since the Iranian Revolution, when he was sentenced to five years in prison for political and religious dissent in 1999. He has been called the &quot;bête noire&quot; of Islamic conservatives in Iran.

Noori is a senior member of Association of Combatant Clerics, and also close ally of the Executives of Construction Party.

==Career==
Abdollah Nouri was called a &quot;trusted lieutenant&quot; of Ayatollah Khomeini who was &quot;the religious guide to the Revolutionary Guards early in the revolution.&quot; Khomeini appointed him as his representative to many other important organizations as well. Khomeini&#x27;s successor, supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also appointed him a member &quot;of a powerful council which advises him on major policies&quot;. However, Abdollah Nouri also supported dissident cleric, Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri, who was placed under house arrest in 1997 for questioning the authority of Ayatollah Khamenei.

Nouri served as minister of interior for four years in then-President Hashemi Rafsanjani&#x27;s first term cabinet. He also served as the minister of interior in Mohammad Khatami&#x27;s first term cabinet until his impeachment by the conservative-controlled 5th Majlis for his &quot;defence of political and social freedoms.&quot; Following his impeachment, Khatami brought Abdullah Nouri back to his cabinet as a vice president. He was &quot;generally seen as the most outspoken reformist&quot; in Khatami&#x27;s cabinet.

In February 1999, he stood down from this post to take part in the municipal elections in February and was elected as the chief of the City Council of Tehran.

He resigned from the Council in order to participate in the sixth parliamentary election. He founded a newspaper and named it &quot;Khordad&quot;, named after the victory of President Khatami on the &quot;2nd of Khordad, 1376&quot; by the Iranian calendar, equivalent to 23 May 1997. His newspaper advocated &quot;freedom of expression, human rights and a modern and democratic Islam.&quot;

==Trial==
Based on the contents of this newspaper, Nouri was accused of insulting Islamic values by pushing for democratic reforms, dishonoring Imam Ruhollah Khomeini&#x27;s memory by questioning the authority of the Supreme Leader. According to a Western journalist, another explanation for his prosecution was that Nouri was very popular in Tehran and &quot;the odds on favorite to become Speaker of Parliament in the February 2000 Parliamentary election,&quot; something imprisonment would prevent.

He was tried by the Special Clerical Court in Iran and made an &quot;outspoken and aggressive defense during his trial&quot;, refusing to accept the authority of this court, which he saw as unconstitutional.

On 27 November 1999, he was convicted of insulting Ayatollah Khomeini, publishing anti-religious materials, disturbing public opinion, insulting officials, advocating links with the United States and was sentenced to five years in jail.

Readers of the &quot;Iranian&quot; voted him the most significant Iranian personality of 1999.

==Release==
Nouri was released from prison on 5 November 2002. He was released because his brother Alireza Noori, a member of parliament at the time, was killed in an accident. Noori was freed from Evin Prison when Mehdi Karroubi, speaker of the Majlis at the time, wrote a letter to the Supreme Leader and asked him to free Noori as his father was suffering from the loss of his other son.

Abdollah Nouri was mentioned as a possible candidate in the 2009 presidential election, but did not run.

==Analysis==
He is considered as one of the leading pragmatists among reformers, though his policies were aligned with Khomeini&#x27;s doctrines.

<doc id="827910" wikidata="Q304146" url="?curid=827910" title="FK Liepājas Metalurgs">
<text>FK Liepājas Metalurgs () was a Latvian football club in the city of Liepāja and playing in the Virslīga. They played at the Daugava Stadium (capacity 5,083). In 2005 Liepājas Metalurgs became the first team other than Skonto Riga to win the Virslīga since the league restarted in 1991. After the 2013 league season the club was dissolved due to the bankruptcy of its sole sponsor metallurgical plant &quot;Liepājas Metalurgs&quot;. The club was replaced by FK Liepāja, founded in 2014.

== History ==
Based in Liepāja, FK Liepājas Metalurgs, got their name from the city&#x27;s metallurgical factory, founded in 1882, the only one of its kind in the Baltic states.

The history of the club can be traced back to 1945 when two football clubs were founded in Liepāja – Daugava Liepāja and Dinamo Liepāja.

=== Daugava Liepāja and Dinamo Liepāja: 1945–1947 ===
In its debut season Daugava Liepāja were runners-up in the Latvian league behind the champions FK Dinamo Rīga. In 1946 Daugava were coached by former Olimpija Liepāja defender Kārlis Tīls and with one of the best former Olimpija players Ernests Ziņģis in attack the team won its first Latvian title. Both Valdis Pultraks and Voldemārs Sudmalis were in the squad. Daugava again won the title again in 1947 and the squad included Miervaldis Drāznieks who went on to score 160 goals in the Latvian league. Daugava Liepāja also won the Latvian Cup in 1946 and 1947.

Dinamo Liepāja did not play in the Latvian top league. However, in 1948 Dinamo won the Latvian Cup with future Liepāja player Žanis Zviedris in the team.

=== Sarkanais Metalurgs: 1949–1961 ===
In 1949 Daugava Liepāja and Dinamo Liepāja merged to form Sarkanais Metalurgs which, for the next decade, was the strongest club in the Latvian league. In 1949, Sarkanais Metalurgs won both the league and the Latvian Cup. More titles followed in 1951, 1953, 1954, and from 1956 to 1958. They also won the Latvian Cup three times in a row from 1953 to 1955. In 1954 after beating Daugava Rīga in a match for the chance to play in the Soviet League a united Daugava-Metalurgs club was formed which included six Metalurgs players. In 1954, they competed in the &quot;USSR Class B 1954, 2nd zone&quot; of the Soviet First League the second tier in Soviet football. In the Latvian league the Metalurgs team was made up of mostly the reserve squad. In 1956 Daugava did not include the Metalurgs name in the Soviet League. In 1960 Sarkanais Metalurgs were given a place in the Soviet league and continued playing in the league under various names until 1990. In 1961, the club played as LMR Liepāja.

=== Zvejnieks Liepāja: 1962–1989 ===
In 1962, the club changed owners and was renamed Zvejnieks Liepāja. It was considered to be the second team for Daugava Rīga and the club&#x27;s best players usually had to leave for Daugava. Also if Daugava players needed to have match practice they were sent to Liepāja. In the Soviet league Zvejnieks were usually a mid-table club. With the club playing in the Soviet and not the local league, players from other Republics of the Soviet Union came to play for Zvejnieks. In the 1960s, defender Mārtiņš Lube was the club&#x27;s captain. Jurijs Romaņenkovs who went on to become the club&#x27;s coach in 1989–90 played for Zvejnieks in the 1970s.

In the 1980s Vladimirs Žuks coached Zvejnieks and several bright players emerged with the club including Jānis Intenbergs, Ilmārs Verpakovskis, Alekseja Šarando, Vladimirs Babičevs and Ainārs Linards. A number of Daugava Rīga players also played for Zvejnieks including Raimonds Laizāns and Dainis Deglis.

=== Olimpija Liepāja: 1990–1993 ===
In 1990, the club was renamed and given the name of a former Latvian club that played in the 1920s–1930s – Olimpija Liepāja.
As Olimpija the club played in the Soviet league in 1990, but in 1991, after Latvia regaining its independence, they played only in the Latvian league and finished in the third place. The Olimpija period saw the emergence of Viktors Dobrecovs at the club. After the breakup of the Soviet Union the first seasons in the newly independent Latvia were difficult for Olimpija as they got financially weaker from year to year.

=== FK Liepāja: 1994 ===
In 1994, the club was renamed FK Liepāja but played only one season with that name.

=== DAG Liepāja: 1995–1996 ===
In 1995 FK Liepāja was merged with FC Dag Rīga to form DAG Liepāja. The club reached the 1995 Latvian Cup final where they lost 3–0 to Skonto FC. Ainārs Linards returned to the club in 1995. In the Latvian league the club finished 8th out of ten clubs in 1996.

=== Baltika Liepāja: 1996–1997 ===
In 1996, the club changed owners again and became Baltika Liepāja. In 1996 Māris Verpakovskis, the son of Ilmārs Verpakovskis and future Latvia national football team international made his debut for the club. For some time the club was on the brink of bankruptcy and struggled to stop the best players from leaving the club. However, the club got new funding from the local Metallurgy factory and for the 1997 season at last had a stable budget and ambitious plans again.

=== FK Liepājas Metalurgs: 1997–2013 ===
In 1998 Metalurgs with Jurijs Popkovs as their head coach finished second behind Skonto in the Latvian Virslīga and each season up to 2004 Metalurgs finished second in the championship. In the Latvian Cup they also lost three cup finals. In 2005 Metalurgs finally became Virslīga champions and won the first title for Liepāja in an independent Latvia since the 1930s. In 2006 Metalurgs also finally won the Latvian Cup. The next league title came in 2009.

=== 2013 ===
After the 2013 league season the club was dissolved due to the bankruptcy of its sole sponsor metallurgical plant &quot;Liepājas Metalurgs&quot;. There were talks held with potential investors about salvation of the club, but due to lack of suitable options a decision was made to end its existence. The club was replaced by FK Liepāja, founded in 2014.

His wife, Fatemeh, later recalled that she took their second son, Taghi, to meet his father at Qasr Prison for the first time when he was six months old.

In 1978, Karroubi retired from law in order to commit to politics. In 1979, he joined the Iranian Revolution. Karroubi was the head of the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee. From 1980 to 1992 he was also the director of the Martyr&#x27;s Foundation, and from 1989 to 1992 whe as a Parliament Speaker.

In 1988, Karroubi re-entered business after 10 years of emphasis on politics. With eighteen years of experience as a solicitor beforehand, Karroubi began trading and investing himself.

==Political positions==
===Domestic policies===
During his first term as speaker of Parliament, Karroubi was among the &quot;maktabi&quot; or &quot;radical&quot; faction of the majlis who contested the policies of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. While Rafsanjani favored foreign investment and market reforms, Karroubi and others &quot;sought to promote mass political participation and maintain state control of the economy&quot;. In fall of 1989 several radical clerics founded the Association of Combatant Clerics of Tehran, which Karroubi headed. Karroubi eventually left this association in 2005 and founded his own party, &quot;Etemad-e-Melli&quot;.

His wife, Fatemeh, served as his social affairs advisors when he served as the chairman of the Majlis of Iran from 2000 until 2004.

Mehdi Karroubi, an ethnic Lur, supports an approach where all people regardless of their gender, religion, or ethnicity can feel that they are part of Iranian government. He was outspoken in supporting the rights of religious and ethnic minorities. He visited churches, synagogues and Zoroastrian temples during his time as speaker of Parliament.

Karroubi is a critic of the Guardian Council and on numerous occasions wrote letters to the council expressing his concerns. He criticized the nature of the Guardian Council&#x27;s supervision over the elections.

===Foreign policies===
Karroubi and the National Trust Party support the idea of dialogue with the United States aiming at resolving long standing conflicts. Early after the election of Barack Obama as US president, Karroubi stated that the changes from the United States have been positive.

Karroubi has been a critic of President Ahmadinejad&#x27;s foreign policy and his infamous remarks about the Holocaust. Karroubi said: &quot;The Holocaust is an event which did take place.&quot; He believes that the president&#x27;s remarks cost Iran a great deal.

==Presidential campaigns==
===2005 presidential campaign===
Karroubi was among the reformist candidates in the presidential election of 2005, where he finished third in the vote count, closely following the front runners, ex-president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Tehran mayor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As neither gathered a majority of the vote, a run-off election was held on 24 June 2005, and won by Ahmadinejad.

After the announcement of the election results, Karroubi alleged that a network of mosques, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Basij militia forces had been illegally used to generate and mobilize support for Ahmadinejad. He then explicitly alleged that Mojtaba Khamenei, a son of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, was among the conspirators. Ayatollah Khamenei wrote to Karroubi, characterizing these allegations as &quot;below his dignity&quot; and warning that they would &quot;result in a crisis&quot; in Iran, which he would not allow. Karroubi responded in an open letter, resigning from all his political posts, including that as adviser to the Supreme Leader and as a member of Expediency Discernment Council, both of which he had been appointed to by Khamenei. The day after, on 20 June, distribution of the reformist morning newspapers &quot;Eqbal&quot;, &quot;Hayat-e No&quot;, &quot;Aftab-e Yazd&quot;, and &quot;Etemad&quot; were stopped by the prosecutor-general of Tehran, Saeed Mortazavi, for publishing Karroubi&#x27;s letter, with &quot;Eqbal&quot; being completely banned from publication. It was claimed that Karroubi was subject to house arrest because of his letter.

Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who ranked first in the first round, also pointed to organized and unjust interventions, alleged manipulation of the vote, and supported Karroubi&#x27;s complaint.

===2009 presidential election===
Immediately after the 2005 presidential election Karroubi founded Etemad-e Melli Party, and along with it &quot;Etemad-e Melli&quot; newspaper. In the 2009 election, he ran as the head of his party. However, many non-party figures also endorsed him.

Karroubi was described as &quot;the best-organized&quot; among the main candidates. He has his own party, his own newspaper and has always followed a clear political stance.

He claimed to be the first candidate to announce his candidacy for the presidency. During the last months before the election, he refused a call for him to withdraw in the support of Mohammad Khatami or later Mir-Hossein Mousavi. Later, both Mousavi and Karroubi stated that a union among reformists would only help Ahamadinejad&#x27;s reelection, claiming that reformists needed a massive turn out in order to win and that more candidates would advance their interests.

Karroubi publicized his policies by publishing four electoral declarations. According to a paper handed to his supporters during the campaign his main policies are:

# Returning to the planned-based system of governing and using the elite and experts in decision making process
# Organizing financial policies and increasing the effect of national budget
# Protecting human rights and people&#x27;s privacy
# Improving women&#x27;s social status
# Nationalizing oil profits
# Supporting NGOs
# Supporting the right of religious or tribal minorities
# Supporting the domination of law and opposing and criticizing illegal behavior
# Supporting the press and free access to the information and internet

In a 2009 interview with the AFP, Karroubi also promised to expand women&#x27;s rights if elected president of Iran. Among the reforms which he planned to introduce were elimination of Iran&#x27;s morality police street patrols, which force an Islamic dress code on Iranian women. He questioned mandatory Islamic dress code and proposed that Hijab needs to be optional.

His foremost economic program is for broad public ownership of the national oil and gas companies. According to this plan, adopted from the pro-market economist Massoud Nilli, company stock and profits would be shared among Iranians above 18 years of age, without the right to sell. He has predicted that this will add 70000 Tomans a month to every Iranian&#x27;s income.

His campaign slogan was &quot;Change for Iran&quot;, a word visible on his banners and other advertisements.

Former Tehran mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi was among the first to endorse him, and was Karroubi&#x27;s campaign manager. Karroubi has promised to appoint him vice president if elected.

Karroubi also gained endorsements from journalist Abbas Abdi, now his political advisor, and Jamileh Kadivar, former member of the parliament and his advisor on women&#x27;s issues. Other notable supporters include: Ata&#x27;ollah Mohajerani, historian, politician, journalist, and author and former culture minister during Khatami&#x27;s presidency; Mohammad-Ali Abtahi, President Khatami&#x27;s chief of staff, then his vice president for Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, and finally his advisor; Mohammad-Ali Najafi, Iranian politician and university professor and former minister of education; Emadeddin Baghi, the founder and head of the Committee for the Defense of Prisoners&#x27; Rights and the Society of Right to Life Guardians, and winner of the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders; Abdolkarim Soroush, philosopher and professor.

Mehdi Karroubi widely campaigned with his wife, Fatemeh Karroubi, during the campaign, which had previously been an unusual for a politician and his wife in Iran. Fatemeh Karroubi additionally served as the head of her husband&#x27;s campaign in Tehran province and made separate speeches in support of her husband&#x27;s candidacy. Karroubi&#x27;s son, Taghi Karroubi, worked as one of his campaign managers.

==Post-election activity==

On 9 August 2009, in a letter to the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran, Karroubi demanded investigation of Iranian prisons for possible tortures and in particular sexual harassment of men and women. On 19 August, he wrote to parliament speaker Ali Larijani, asking to meet with him, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the state prosecutor to &quot;personally present my documents and evidence over the cases of sexual abuse in some prisons specially Kahrizak detention center.&quot;

Ali Larijani and Sadeq Larijani both officially rejected his claims and Ali Khamenei&#x27;s representatives and vice chairman of National Security Commission of the parliament demanded Karroubi&#x27;s arrest. Karroubi also raised concerns about the 2009 Iranian presidential election, saying the results had been rigged.

===Attacks===
On 8 January 2010, Karroubi&#x27;s son, Hussein Karroubi reported on Karroubi&#x27;s website, Saham News, that shots had been fired at his armored car by pro-government demonstrators in Qazvin. Demonstrators also threw &quot;bricks and rocks&quot; at the flat where he was staying. The &quot;New York Times&quot; newspaper reported that he &quot;has been pushed and shoved&quot; and had a shoe thrown &quot;at him—a grave insult in Iran&quot;—since the election. &quot;But this was the first time someone shot at him.&quot;

On 2 September 2010, 20 members of the Basij militia broke into Karroubi&#x27;s apartment building. They shot at the building, set small fires in the courtyard, the lobby, vandalized parts of the building, cut water pipes to the apartment and tried to cut power on the street. This was the fourth consecutive night that Karroubi&#x27;s apartment has come under attack. Karroubi&#x27;s son, Mohammad Taghi Karroubi, said he heard several of the men say they were there to kill his father. Several of Karroubi&#x27;s security team were injured when pleading with the gathering to stay outside the building to no avail. The head of a security team protecting Karroubi was in a coma after being beaten, as he tried to talk with a group of attackers.

===House arrest===
In the wake of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, Green movement leaders in Iran called for demonstrations on 14 February 2011. The government responded by placing leaders of the movement under house arrest and on 14 February Iranian state TV broadcast images of &quot;some 50 conservative MPs marching through parliament&#x27;s main hall&quot; chanting &quot;Death to Mousavi, death to Karroubi&quot;. A statement issued by conservative Iranian parliamentarians carried by the official Islamic Republic News Agency said: &quot;Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi are corrupts on earth and should be tried.&quot; &quot;Corrupt on earth&quot; (Mofsed-e-filarz) is a capital crime sometimes levied against political dissidents in the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to reports, Karroubi, fellow Iranian opposition leader Mir-Hossein Mousavi, and their wives Fatemeh Karroubi and Zahra Rahnavard, were taken from their homes by security forces to Heshmatiyeh Prison in Tehran in February 2011.

=== Hunger strike ===
On 16 August 2017, Karroubi started a hunger strike in protest to his house arrest situation, calling for an public trial and demanding security agents to leave his house. He was 79 at the time and had undergone heart surgery only days earlier; he was taken to hospital after less than 24 hours and resumed eating after the government agreed to remove intelligence agents from his home. His demand for trial has not been granted.

==Personal life==
Karroubi has been married to Fatemeh Karroubi, the daughter of an Aligoudarz mercantile family, since she was 14.
