<text>The title of Earl of Lancaster was created in the Peerage of England in 1267. It was succeeded by the title Duke of Lancaster in 1351, which expired in 1361. (The most recent creation of the ducal title merged with the Crown in 1413.)

King Henry III of England created the Earldom of Lancasterfrom which the royal house of Henry IV was namedfor his second son, Edmund Crouchback, in 1267. Edmund had already been created Earl of Leicester in 1265 and following the Second Barons&#x27; War and the death and attainder of the king&#x27;s rebellious brother-in-law Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester in 1265, the latter&#x27;s lands, including most notably Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire, had been awarded to him.

When Edmund&#x27;s son Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, inherited the estates and title of his father-in-law Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln, he became at a stroke the most powerful nobleman in England, with lands throughout the kingdom and the ability to raise vast private armies to wield power at national and local levels. This brought himand his younger brother Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancasterinto conflict with their first cousin King Edward II, leading to Thomas&#x27;s execution. Henry inherited Thomas&#x27;s titles and he and his son Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, gave loyal service to Edward&#x27;s son King Edward III.

==History==
===Creation===
After the supporters of Henry III of England suppressed opposition from the English nobility in the Second Barons&#x27; War, Henry granted to his second son Edmund Crouchback the titles and possessions forfeited by attainder of the barons&#x27; leader, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, including the Earldom of Leicester, on 26 October 1265. Later grants included the first Earldom of Lancaster on 30 June 1267 and that of Earl Ferrers in 1301. Edmund was also Count of Champagne and Brie from 1276 by right of his wife. Henry IV of England would later use his descent from Edmund to legitimise his claim to the throne, even making the spurious claim that Edmund was the elder son of Henry but had been passed over as king because of his deformity.

 Edmund&#x27;s second marriage to Blanche of Artois, the widow of the King of Navarre, placed him at the centre of the European aristocracy. Blanche&#x27;s daughter Joan I of Navarre was queen regnant of Navarre and through her marriage to Philip IV of France was queen consort of France. Edmund&#x27;s son Thomas became the most powerful nobleman in England, gaining the Earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury through marriage to the heiress of Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. His income was £11,000 per annumdouble that of the next wealthiest earl.

Thomas and his younger brother Henry served in the coronation of their cousin King Edward II of England on 25 February 1308; Thomas carried Curtana, the Sword of Mercy, and Henry carried the royal sceptre. After initially supporting Edward, Thomas became one of the Lords Ordainers, who demanded the banishment of Piers Gaveston and the governance of the realm by a baronial council. After Gaveston was captured, Thomas took the lead in his trial and execution at Warwick in 1312. Edward&#x27;s authority was weakened by poor governance and defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Bannockburn. This allowed Thomas to restrain Edward&#x27;s power by republishing the Ordinances of 1311. Following this achievement Thomas took little part in the governance of the realm and instead retreated to Pontefract Castle. This allowed Edward to regroup and re-arm, leading to a fragile peace in August 1318 with the Treaty of Leake. In 1321 Edward&#x27;s rule again collapsed into civil war. Thomas raised a northern army but was defeated and captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered but because he was Edward&#x27;s cousin he was given a quicker death by beheading.

Henry joined the revolt of Edward&#x27;s wife Isabella of France and her lover Mortimer in 1326, pursuing and capturing Edward at Neath in South Wales. Following Edward&#x27;s deposition at the Parliament of Kenilworth in 1326 and reputed murder at Berkeley Castle, Thomas&#x27;s conviction was posthumously reversed and Henry regained possession of the Earldoms of Lancaster, Derby, Salisbury and Lincoln that had been forfeit for Thomas&#x27;s treason. His restored prestige led to him knighting the young King Edward III of England before his coronation. Mortimer lost support over the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton that formalised Scotland&#x27;s independence, and his developing power in the Welsh Marches provoked jealousy from the barons. When Mortimer called a parliament to make his new powers and estates permanent with the title of Earl of March in 1328, Henry led the opposition and held a counter-meeting. In response, Mortimer ravaged the lands of Lancaster and checked the revolt. Edward III was able to assume control in 1330 but Henry&#x27;s further influence was restricted by poor health and blindness for the last fifteen years of his life.

===Succession===

Henry&#x27;s son, also called Henry, was born at the castle of Grosmont in Monmouthshire between 1299 and 1314. According to the younger Henry&#x27;s memoirs, he was better at martial arts than academic subjects and did not learn to read until later in life. Henry was coeval with Edward III and was pivotal to his reign, becoming his best friend and most trusted commander. Henry was knighted in 1330, represented his father in parliament and fought in Edward&#x27;s Scottish campaign. After the outbreak of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Henry took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the great English victory in the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340. Later, he was required to commit himself as hostage in the Low Countries for Edward&#x27;s considerable debts. He remained hostage for a year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release.

In 1345, Edward III launched a major, three-pronged attack on France. The Earl of Northampton attacked from Brittany, Edward from Flanders, and Henry from Aquitaine in the south. Moving rapidly through the country, Henry confronted the Comte d&#x27;Isle at the Battle of Auberoche and achieved a victory described as &quot;the greatest single achievement of Lancaster&#x27;s entire military career&quot;. The ransom from the prisoners has been estimated at £50,000. Edward rewarded Henry by including him as a founding knight of the Order of the Garter. An even greater honour was bestowed on Lancaster when Edward created him Duke of Lancaster. The title of duke was relatively new in England, with only Cornwall being a previous ducal title. Lancaster was also given palatinate status for the county of Lancashire, which entailed a separate administration independent of the crown. There were two other counties palatine; Durham was an ancient ecclesiastical palatinate and Chester was crown property.

The medal is awarded to recognize service during the Vietnam War by all members of the U.S. Armed Forces provided they meet the award requirements.

The distinctive design has been attributed to both sculptor Thomas Hudson Jones, a former employee of the Army Institute of Heraldry and Mercedes Lee who created the design.

==Award criteria==
The Vietnam Service Medal (VSM) was awarded to all members of the U.S. Armed Forces who served in Vietnam and its contiguous waters or airspace, after 3 July 1965 through 28 March 1973. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, or airspace thereover, during the same period and serving in direct support of operations in Vietnam are also eligible for the award.

; Requirements
Individuals must meet one of the following requirements:
* Be attached to or regularly serve for 1 or more days with an organization participating in or directly supporting military operations.
* Be attached to or regularly serve for 1 or more days aboard a U.S. naval vessel directly supporting military operations.
* Actually participating as a crewmember in one or more aerial flights into airspace above Vietnam and contiguous waters directly supporting military operations.
* Serve on temporary duty for 30 consecutive days or 60 non-consecutive days in Vietnam or contiguous waters, except that time limit may be waived for personnel participating in actual combat operations.
* No person will be entitled to more than one award of the VSM.
* Individuals qualified for the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (AFEM) for reason of service in Vietnam between 1 July 1958 and 3 July 1965 (inclusive) will remain qualified for that medal. Upon request (unit personnel officer) any such individual may be awarded the VSM instead of the AFEM. In such instances, the AFEM will be deleted from the list of authorized medals in personnel records. No person will be entitled to both awards for Vietnam service.
* Service members who earned the AFEM for Operation Frequent Wind between 29 and 30 April 1975, may elect to receive the VSM instead of the AFEM. No service member may be issued both medals for service in Vietnam.
* Vietnam and contiguous waters, as used herein, is defined as an area which includes Vietnam and the water adjacent thereto with the following specified limits: from a point on the East Coast of Vietnam at the juncture of Vietnam with China southeastward to 21 degrees north latitude, 108 degrees, 15 minutes longitude; then southward to 18 degrees, north latitude, 108 degrees, 15 minutes east longitude; then southward to 17 degrees, 30 minutes north longitude, 111 degrees east longitude; then southward to 11 degrees north latitude, 111 degrees east latitude; then southward to 7 degrees north latitude, 105 degrees east latitude; then westward to 7 degrees north latitude, 103 degrees east latitude; then northward to 9 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude, 103 degrees east latitude; then northeastward to 10 degrees, 15 minutes north latitude, 104 degrees, 27 minutes east latitude; then northward to a point on the West Coast of Vietnam at the juncture of Vietnam and Cambodia.
* The VSM may be awarded posthumously.

The Vietnam Service Medal is retroactive to 1 July 1958 and supersedes and replaces the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal which was issued for initial operations in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from that date through 3 July 1965. Defense Department regulations do not permit the simultaneous presentation of both the Vietnam Service Medal and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, for the same period of service in Vietnam, however the AFEM may be exchanged for the VSM upon request from a service member. Veterans of the Vietnam War may exchange the AFEM for the VSM and have military records updated to reflect the difference by contacting the National Personnel Records Center, which is the current agency that provides record corrections reflecting an AFEM conversion to the Vietnam Service Medal.

Though the &quot;Mayaguez&quot; incident is often referred to as the last battle of the Vietnam War, U.S. military personnel who participated in it are not eligible for the Vietnam Service Medal by virtue of participating that battle alone, as the eligibility period for the medal ended in April 1975, a few weeks before the battle took place. Instead of the VSM, the AFEM is authorized for military members who participated in that battle. A congressional bill was introduced in 2016 to award veterans of the &quot;Mayaguez&quot; battle the VSM, but the bill was never voted out of committee, effectively ending it.

South Vietnam also issued its own service medal for the Vietnam War, known as the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. This is a separate military award which was accepted by the U.S. Congress and the U.S. military in accordance with DoD 1348 C7. Six months of service in support of South Vietnamese military operations was the general U.S. requirement for the award.

==Appearance==

The Vietnam Service Medal is a rounded bronze shaped medal, 1 inches in diameter with a green, yellow, and red suspension ribbon. The obverse side of the medal consists of a figure of an oriental dragon (representing the subversive nature of the conflict) behind a grove of bamboo trees located above the inscription &quot;REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM SERVICE&quot;. On the reverse, a crossbow (representing the ancient weapon of Vietnam) facing upwards with a ready to be fired lighted torch of the Statue of Liberty, above an arched inscription &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot;.

The service ribbon of the medal is 1 inches wide and consists of the following vertical stripes: three narrow ( inch) strips of red with wider ( inch) stripes of yellow in the center, flanked by even wider ( inch) stripes of yellow on each side and narrow -inch stripes of primitive green on the ends. The yellow (yellow is traditionally the imperial color of Vietnam) with red stripes (the red represents the three ancient Vietnamese empires of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin China) resembles the former flag of South Vietnam. The green border on each side alludes to the jungle of that country.

;Ribbon devices
The Vietnam Service Medal is authorized three devices for wear on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal:
* Arrowhead device: assigned or attached member of a U.S. Army or Air Force unit with direct combat assault credit for a parachute jump, helicopter assault landing, combat glider landing, or amphibious assault landing.
* FMF combat operation insignia: for Naval personnel assigned to a Marine Corps unit during Marine Corps combat operations.
* Service star (campaign star): for participation in or support of operations in the seventeen designated campaigns of the Vietnam War, a inch bronze service star is authorized for wear on the Vietnam Service Medal suspension and service ribbon for each of the campaigns from 15 March 1962 to 28 January 1973; a inch bronze star is also authorized for Operation Frequent Wind, 29–30 April 1975, for Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force personnel. A inch silver star is authorized in lieu of five bronze stars.

One inch bronze service star is authorized for each campaign under the following conditions:

1. Assigned or attached to and present for duty with a unit during the period in which it participated in combat.
2. Under orders in a combat zone and in addition meets any of the following requirements:
a. Awarded a combat decoration.
b. Furnished a certificate by a Commanding General of a corps, higher unit, or independent force that soldier actually participated in combat.
c. Served at a normal post of duty (as contrasted to occupying the status of an inspector, observer, or visitor).
d. Aboard a vessel other than in a passenger status and furnished a certificate by the home port commander of the vessel that he or she served in the combat zone.
e. Was an evadee or escapee in the combat zone or recovered from a POW status in the combat zone during the time limitations of the campaign. POWs will not be accorded credit for the time spent in confinement or while otherwise in restraint under enemy control.

==Vietnam War campaigns==
The U.S. Department of Defense established thirty military campaigns during the Vietnam War which covered all U.S. service branches. In 2010, the Department of Defense consolidated the original list of campaigns from the original thirty to a list of eighteen by combining the U.S. Air Force campaign list with the other armed services. The U.S. Army, and U.S. Coast Guard recognize seventeen &quot; bronze service stars (also known as campaign stars; 3 silver stars and 2 bronze stars) on the Vietnam Service campaign streamer. Additionally, the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force recognize Operation Frequent Wind (29–30 April 1975).

<text>The Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) is a nonprofit organization that operates an annual 15-day summer fair, 12-day winter fair, a seasonal amusement park, and indoor arenas in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The PNE fair is held at Hastings Park, beginning in mid-to-late August and ending in early September, usually Labour Day, and in mid-December until Christmas. 

The organization was established in 1907 as the Vancouver Exhibition Association, and organized its first fair at Hastings Park in 1910. The organization was renamed to the Pacific National Exhibition in 1946. During the mid-20th century, a number of facilities were built on the PNE grounds, including Pacific Coliseum and PNE Agrodome. In 1993, the amusement park adjacent to the PNE, Playland, became a division of the PNE.

==History==
The Vancouver Exhibition Association (VEA), the predecessor to the Pacific National Exhibition organization was first formed in 1907; although the association was not incorporated until 18 June 1908. The VEA had petitioned Vancouver City Council to host a fair at Hastings Park; although faced early opposition from the city council and the local jockey club that used the park for horse races. However, the city council eventually conceded to the VEA&#x27;s request and granted the association a 5-year lease to host a fair at Hastings Park in 1909.

The VEA held its first fair at Hastings Park in August 1910. It was opened by then Canadian Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier as the &quot;Vancouver Exhibition&quot;. The biggest attractions of the two-week fair are its numerous shops, stalls, performances, a nightly fireworks show, and the exhibition&#x27;s Prize Home. From its beginnings, the exhibition was used as a showcase for the region&#x27;s agriculture and economy.

In the initial years of the Second World War, the fairgrounds saw an increased military presence. However, the exhibition itself was not cancelled until 1942, after the Canadian declaration of war against Japan was issued. From 1942 to 1946 the exhibition and fair was closed, and like the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, served as a military training facility for the duration of World War II. During this time, the exhibition barns that were used to house livestock, were used as processing centres for interned Japanese Canadians from all over British Columbia. The interned Japanese Canadians were later shipped away to other internment camps throughout British Columbia, and Alberta. The Momiji (Japanese word for Maple) Gardens on the PNE&#x27;s grounds serves as a memorial for the event. The barns used for the internment of Japanese Canadians are still used to house livestock during the annual fair, and serve as storage area to house some of the PNE&#x27;s property the rest of the year. 
On 7 February 1946, the Vancouver Exhibition Association changed its name to its current moniker, the &quot;Pacific National Exhibition&quot;; and later reopened the fair to the public under that name in 1947. The organization was formally reincorporated as the Pacific National Exhibition in 1955.

The highest attendance at the fair was recorded in 1986, with 1.1 million guests visiting the PNE, most likely due to Expo 86 that was occurring at the time. In 1993, the amusement park adjacent to the PNE, Playland, became a division of the PNE organization.

During 1997-1998, the PNE grounds was transformed with the demolition of a number of buildings including the Food Building, Showmart and the Poultry Building. This gave way to the Sanctuary, a parkland setting with a pond. The pond restored part of a stream that once flowed in the park out to the Burrard Inlet. The city restored a large portion of the park. Many old fair buildings have been demolished and replaced by those of a more natural character. Although land was purchased in Surrey that was to become the fair&#x27;s new home, the PNE has since transferred ownership from the province to the City of Vancouver and will remain at Hastings Park. The PNE is a registered charity.

Two attractions at the PNE were named as heritage sites by the City of Vancouver in August 2013. The Pacific Coliseum and the Wooden Roller Coaster were added to the list.

In 2020, the fair went on hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside other agricultural and county fairs across Canada, including the Calgary Stampede, the Canadian National Exhibition, and K-Days.

It returned in 2021 with a smaller version of the fair with limited capacity 

In the early hours of February 20, 2022, a major fire broke out on PNE grounds, where multiple vehicles, tools and equipment, and buildings were destroyed as a result.

===Breakout Festival riot===

In September of 2022 the PNE Amphitheatre hosted the two day rap and hip-hop festival known as Breakout Festival. On the second day of the festival fights broke out inside and outside the venue, and vandalism occurred when concert-goers became hostile following an announcement that the headliner, American rapper Lil-Baby, would not be taking the stage.

After a major police response was launched and the riot was stopped, seven people were arrested and the venue suffered millions of dollars of property damages, although no major injuries were reported. In September 19, 2023, a year after the riot, the Vancouver Police Department charged an additional 15 people with crimes related to the riot following an extensive investigation which included reviewing and analyzing video posted to social media by attendees.

==Grounds==
The Pacific National Exhibition occupies approximately at Hastings Park, a municipal park in the Hastings–Sunrise neighbourhood. This includes the of land used by Playland, a PNE-operated amusement park. 

The PNE grounds maintains several gardens and natural preserves on the grounds including &quot;The Sanctuary&quot;; a small pond that serves as a resting place and breeding ground for approximately 130 species of birds. Gardens at the PNE grounds include an Italian garden and Momiji Commemorative Garden; the latter serving as a memorial for the internment of Japanese Canadians during World War II. Another memorial located on the park grounds is dedicated to the 29th Battalion, (Vancouver), CEF, an infantry battalion whose lineage is perpetuated by the British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own).

Approximately of Hastings Park is not managed by the Pacific National Exhibition. This includes Hastings Racecourse, a facility operated by Great Canadian Entertainment; and several facilities maintained by the municipal government, including Empire Field, an emergency dispatch centre, and local community centre.

===Structures===

The PNE grounds contains several buildings and exhibition halls. The PNE Forum is a exhibition facility that is used for large displays and trade shows. Rollerland is a exhibition, banquet hall and venue for the Terminal City Roller Derby. 

Two buildings on the PNE grounds are indoor arenas. The Pacific Coliseum is multi-purpose arena that holds 15,713 permanent seats, with provisions for 2,000 temporary seats for concerts and certain sports. The PNE Agrodome is a smaller indoor arena with 3,000 permanent seats, with provisions to expand up to 5,000 seats. Entertainment facilities includes the Garden Auditorium, a building that features a built-in stage and dance hall. The PNE grounds also features an amphitheatre with bench-style seating for 4,500 visitors, and an outdoor event venue named the Freedom Mobile Arch, to be opened in 2026. It is the largest free-span timber frame in the world.

Other buildings on the PNE grounds includes the Livestock Barns, a large multi-use facility, and the organization&#x27;s administrative offices.

<text>Wilhelm Zaisser (20 June 1893 – 3 March 1958) was a German communist politician and statesman who served as the founder and first Minister for State Security of the German Democratic Republic (1950–1953).

== Early life ==
Born in Gelsenkirchen, Westphalia, Zaisser studied to become a teacher from 1910 to 1913 in Essen. When World War I began a year later, Zaisser joined the Imperial German Army. Upon leaving the service in 1918, Zaisser joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) and in 1919 returned to Essen, where he became a school teacher. During this period, Zaisser became an active communist. During the Kapp Putsch in 1920, he was a military leader of the fledgling Red Ruhr Army, which led to his arrest and dismissal as a teacher in 1921. After his release, Zaisser worked for the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) as a propagandist. From 1921 to 1922, Zaisser edited the &quot;Ruhr Echo&quot; and the &quot;Bergischen Voice of the People&quot;. In 1923, Zaisser was recruited into the KPD&#x27;s intelligence wing and worked to covertly subvert the Third French Republic&#x27;s occupation of the Ruhr. 

Zaisser&#x27;s efficient work caused him to be summoned to Moscow a year later, where he received both political and military intelligence training by the GRU.

== Career in Soviet Intelligence ==
After returning to the Weimar Republic in 1924, Zaisser became one of the leaders of the KPD intelligence wing, reporting directly to the Central Committee. Throughout the 1920s, Zaisser was also a paramilitary instructor and political leader for the KPD in such the areas of Rhine, Westphalia and Berlin. He also worked covertly in other nations for the [GRU from 1925 to 1926 as a military advisor to Syria. Starting in 1927, Zaisser worked almost exclusively for the Executive Committee of the Comintern, serving as a military advisor to China (1927–1930) and the Czechoslovak Army (1930–1932). His covert activities were ultimately rewarded by full membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1932 and full Soviet citizenship in 1940. In 1936, Zaisser traveled to the Second Spanish Republic under the covert identity of &quot;Gomez.&quot; 

On behalf of the Soviets, Zaisser became a military advisor to the Spanish Republican Army, while secretly remaining a, GRU agent, and as the Chief of the Servicio de Investigación Militar, the political police of the Second Spanish Republic. Wilhelm Zaisser&#x27;s deputy was a career NKVD operative and future Stasi Minister Erich Mielke, who used the cover name &quot;Fritz Leissner.&quot; 

In addition to Zaisser and Mielke, the S.I.M. was filled with countless other agents of the GRU and NKVD, whose Spanish rezident was General Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov. According to author Donald Rayfield, &quot;Stalin, Yezhov, and Beria distrusted Soviet participants in the Spanish war. Military advisors like Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, journalists like Koltsov were open to infection by the heresies, especially Trotsky&#x27;s, prevalent among the Republic&#x27;s supporters. NKVD agents sent to Spain were therefore keener on abducting and murdering anti-Stalinists among Republican leaders and International Brigade commanders than on fighting Franco. The defeat of the Republic, in Stalin&#x27;s eyes, was caused not by the NKVD&#x27;s diversionary efforts, but by the treachery of the heretics.&quot;

Zaisser quickly achieved the rank of brigadier general (initially commanding XIII International Brigade), and in 1937, he became leader of all the pro-Republican International Brigades operating in Spain. Following the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939, Zaisser returned to Moscow to resume working for the Comintern, but was thrown into jail, apparently because of the failure of the Soviet intervention in Spain. During and after World War II, Zaisser taught Stalinist re-education courses to German prisoners of war.

==Government==
In 1947, Zaisser returned to Germany and joined the Socialist Unity Party (SED). Zaisser&#x27;s career took off rapidly soon afterwards, and by 1948 he was Minister of the Interior and Deputy Minister-President of Saxony-Anhalt. From 1949 to 1954, Zaisser served as a representative in the Volkskammer and in 1950 worked on military and tactical issues at the Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin Institute, a facility to which very few non-Soviets had access.

In 1950, Zaisser gained membership in East Germany&#x27;s Politburo and the Central Committee of the SED, thus becoming one of the most powerful men in the country. In the same year, Zaisser was awarded the Karl Marx Medal and appointed Director of the Ministry of State Security. Using his vast knowledge of intelligence work, Zaisser built the Stasi into a powerful organization.

After the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin on 5 March 1953, Moscow favored replacing East Germany&#x27;s Stalinist party leader Walter Ulbricht and considered Zaisser a potential candidate. However, the workers&#x27; uprising, which was suppressed by the Red Army on 17 June, led to a backlash. 

Alarmed by the uprising, Lavrenty Beria, the First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union and head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, personally travelled from Moscow to East Berlin. He conferred with Wilhelm Zaisser and with Erich Mielke, his deputy, both of whom he had known since the early 1930s. During both conversations, Beria demanded to know why the Stasi had failed to recognize the extreme discontent of the population and inform the Party leadership, which could then have prevented the uprising by taking extremely repressive measures in advance. Both Zaisser and Mielke answered Beria&#x27;s questions circumspectly, and were accordingly left in their posts.

Beria accordingly returned to Moscow intending to remove Ulbricht from power as Premier. However, he was arrested on 26 June 1953, as part of a coup d&#x27;état led by Nikita Khrushchev and Marshal Georgy Zhukov. Beria was tried on charges of 357 counts of rape and high treason. He was sentenced to death and shot by Red Army Colonel-General Pavel Batitsky on 23 December 1953.

Meanwhile, when the East German Politburo met on 8 July, it still seemed that Ulbricht would be deposed as Party General Secretary. While Zaisser conceded that the SED&#x27;s whole Politburo was responsible for the &quot;accelerated construction of socialism&quot; and for the subsequent fallout. But he also added that to leave Ulbricht as Premier, &quot;would be opposed catastrophic for the New Course&quot;.

By the end of the meeting, only two Politburo members still supported Ulbricht&#x27;s leadership: Free German Youth League chief Erich Honecker and Party Control Commission Chairman Hermann Matern. Ulbricht only managed to forestall a decision then and there with a promise to make a statement at the forthcoming 15th SED CC Plenum, scheduled for later that month.

Meanwhile, Mielke informed a Party commission looking for scapegoats that Zaisser, was calling for secret negotiations with West Germany and that, &quot;he believed the Soviet Union would abandon the DDR.&quot;

Once he knew he had the complete support of new Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, Ulbricht removed Zaisser and all other critics of his leadership from the SED&#x27;s ruling Politburo. Zaisser was also forced to resign as Minister for State Security in July 1953. However, in 1953 Zaisser was decorated with the Order of Karl Marx.

Ultimately, Zaisser and all other anti-Ulbricht members of the Politburo and the Central Committee were dismissed from all their other positions. Ulbricht particularly accused Zaisser of not using more of the repressive power of the Stasi during the uprising of June 1953. Zaisser was stripped of all his posts, expelled from the SED, and classified as an enemy of the people. 

==Death and legacy==
Wilhelm Zaisser spent his final years working as a translator and at the Institute of Marxism and Leninism. He died in obscurity in East Berlin in 1958.

Only after the 1989 Peaceful Revolution and German Reunification in 1990, was Zaisser formally rehabilitated. His Party membership posthumously was also restored by the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the successor party to the SED, in 1993.

<doc id="797776" wikidata="Q5691144" url="?curid=797776" title="Health savings account">
<text>A health savings account (HSA) is a tax-advantaged medical savings account available to taxpayers in the United States who are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). The funds contributed to an account are not subject to federal income tax at the time of deposit. Unlike a flexible spending account (FSA), HSA funds roll over and accumulate year to year if they are not spent. HSAs are owned by the individual, which differentiates them from company-owned Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRA) that are an alternate tax-deductible source of funds paired with either high-deductible health plans or standard health plans.

HSA funds may be used to pay for qualified medical expenses at any time without federal tax liability or penalty. Beginning in early 2011 over-the-counter medications could not be paid with an HSA without a doctor&#x27;s prescription, although that requirement was lifted as of January 1, 2020. Withdrawals for non-medical expenses are treated very similarly to those in an individual retirement account (IRA) in that they may provide tax advantages if taken after retirement age, and they incur penalties if taken earlier. The accounts are a component of consumer-driven health care.

Proponents of HSAs believe that they are an important reform that will help reduce the growth of health care costs and increase the efficiency of the health care system. According to proponents, HSAs encourage saving for future health care expenses, allow the patient to receive needed care without a gatekeeper to determine what benefits are allowed, and make consumers more responsible for their own health care choices through the required high-deductible health plan. Opponents observe that the structure of HSAs complicates the decision of whether to obtain medical treatment, by setting it against tax liability and retirement-saving goals. There is also debate about consumer satisfaction with these plans.
==History==
HSAs were established as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which included the enactment of Internal Revenue Code section 223, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2003, signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 8, 2003. They were developed to replace the medical savings account system.

A survey of employers published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in September 2008 found that 8% of covered workers were enrolled in a consumer-driven health plan (including both HSAs and Health Reimbursement Accounts), up from 4% in 2006. The study found that roughly 10% of firms offered such plans to their workers. Large firms were more likely to offer a high-deductible plan (18%), but enrollment was higher in small firms (8% of covered workers, versus 4% in larger firms). As of 2012, these numbers had increased. Approximately 31% of firms offering health insurance offered an HSA (26%) or an HRA (5%) option. Large firms (38%) were somewhat more likely than small (31%) firms to offer such options. 11% of covered workers were in HSAs, while 8% were in HRAs. In small companies, 24% were in high-deductible health plans vs 17% in larger firms.

A survey of health insurers performed by America&#x27;s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) found that 4.5 million Americans were covered by HSA-qualified health plans as of January 2007. Of those, 3.4 million were covered through employer-sponsored plans, and 1.1 million were covered by individually purchased HSA-qualified plans. This represented an increase of 1.3 million since January 2006. In the individual market, 25% of new purchasers bought HSA-qualified plans. HSA-qualified plans represented 17% of new policies sold in the small group market and 8% of new policies sold in the large group market. A follow-up survey by AHIP reported that the number of Americans covered by HSA-qualified plans had grown to 6.1 million as of January 2008 (4.6 million through employer-sponsored plans and 1.5 million covered by individually purchased HSA-qualified plans). HSA-qualified plans represented 27% of new purchases in the individual market, 31% of new enrollment in the small group market and 6% of new enrollment in the large group market.

In January 2008, market research firm Celent moderated its earlier projections, citing the HSA market&#x27;s &quot;disappointing early showing,&quot; and projected 12.5 million accounts by 2012. A survey published by AHIP in May 2009 found that 8 million people were covered by HSA/High-Deductible health plans in January 2009. Of them, 1.8 million were covered by individual policies and approximately 6.2 million were covered by a group plan.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in April 2008 that many individuals enrolled in HSA-qualified health plans did not open tax-qualified health savings accounts, and individuals that had health savings accounts had higher incomes than others. According to the report, nationally representative surveys conducted by Blue Cross Blue Shield Association in 2005 to 2007 found that 42–49% of HSA-eligible plan enrollees did not open health savings accounts in those years. Based on an examination of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data, GAO found that tax filers who reported health savings accounts activity had higher average incomes than other tax filers. Contributions into health savings accounts ($754 million in 2005) were roughly double withdrawals from the accounts ($366 million). Average contributions were also roughly twice average withdrawals ($2,100 versus $1,000). 41% of tax filers who made a contribution into a health savings account did not make any withdrawals; 22% withdrew more than they contributed during the year.

Data released in 2012 indicate that the use of health savings accounts is increasing. AHIP reported in May 2012 that the number of people covered by an HSA-eligible high-deductible health plan more than doubled between January 2008 to January 2012 (going from 6.1 million to 13.5 million). The split between group and individual plans was 11 million as opposed to 2.5 million, and the gender distribution of health savings accounts between male and female enrollees was an even 50%. Among individual plan holders, 51% were under age 40, and 49% were age 40 or over. The top five states with health savings account/high-deductible health plan enrollment were California (1 million), Texas (0.76 million), Illinois (0.72 million), Ohio (0.66 million), and Florida (0.54 million). Also, a survey released in February 2012 by J. P. Morgan Chase of the 900,000 health savings accounts that it manages indicates that contributions to health savings accounts have been steadily increasing. Between 2009 and 2011, the average Chase health savings account balance rose by 11% annually, and the average employee contributions increased by 7% in 2011. Also, in 2011, 42% more dollars were transferred from health savings account cash into health savings account investment accounts than were transferred out. It is believed that the Affordable Care Act, which requires all employers with 50 or more employees to offer health insurance, may be fueling some of this growth. High-deductible health plan premiums tend to be lower, and make an attractive option for both employers and employees. Since health savings account holders are required to be covered by a high-deductible health plan, this creates an opportunity for more growth in the health savings account space.

, according to research conducted by Devenir, an estimated $137 billion is held in almost 38 million Health Savings Accounts.

===Deposits===
Qualifying for an HSA (quotes from IRS Publication 969)

To be an eligible individual and qualify for an HSA, you must meet the following requirements.
* You are covered under a high deductible health plan (HDHP), described later, on the first day of the month.
* You have no other health coverage except what is permitted under Other health coverage, later.
* You aren&#x27;t enrolled in Medicare.
* You can&#x27;t be claimed as a dependent on someone else&#x27;s tax return.
For exceptions and details see IRS Publication 969.

Deposits to a health savings accounts may be made by any policyholder of an HSA-eligible high-deductible health plan, by the employer, or any other person. If an employer makes deposits to such a plan on behalf of its employees, all employees must be treated equally, which is known as the non-discrimination rules. If contributions are made by a Section 125 plan, nondiscrimination rules do not apply. Employers may treat full-time and part-time employees differently, and employers may treat individual and family participants differently; the treatment of employees who are not enrolled in a HSA-eligible high-deductible plan is not considered for non-discrimination purposes. As of 2007, employers may contribute more for non-highly compensated employees than highly compensated employees.

Contributions from an employer or employee may be made on a pretax basis by an employer. If that option is not available through the employer, contributions may be made on a post-tax basis and then used to decrease gross taxable income on the following year&#x27;s Form 1040. Employer pre-tax contributions are not subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax or Medicare taxes, but employee pre-tax contributions not made under cafeteria plans are subject to FICA and Medicare taxes. Regardless of the method or tax savings associated with the deposit, the deposits may only be made for persons covered under an HSA-eligible high-deductible plan, with no other coverage beyond certain qualified additional coverage.

Initially, the annual maximum deposit to a health savings account was the lesser of the actual deductible or specified Internal Revenue Service limits. Congress later abolished the limit based on the deductible and set statutory limits for maximum contributions. All contributions to a health savings account, regardless of source, count toward the annual maximum.

A catch-up provision also applies for plan participants who are age 55 or over, allowing the IRS limit to be increased. This &quot;catch up&quot; contribution limit was set to $500 for 2004, increasing $100 each year until it reached a maximum of $1,000 in 2009. For 2019, the contribution limit was $3,500 for single or $7,000 for married couples and families. For 2020, the contribution limit is $3,550 for single or $7,100 for married couples and families. For 2021, the contribution limit will be $3,600 for single or $7,200 for married couples and families.

All deposits to a health savings account become the property of the policyholder, regardless of the source of the deposit. Funds deposited but not withdrawn each year will carry over into the next year. Policyholders who end their HSA-eligible insurance coverage lose eligibility to deposit further funds, but funds already in the health savings account remain available for use.

The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, signed into law on December 20, 2006, added a provision allowing a taxpayer, once in their life, to rollover IRA assets into a health savings account, to fund up to one year&#x27;s maximum contribution to a health savings account.

State income tax treatment of health savings accounts varies. California and New Jersey impose state income taxes on contributions, interest earned, and capital gains from health savings accounts. New Hampshire and Tennessee don&#x27;t have state income taxes but they do impose a tax on dividends and interest, including health savings accounts.

====Contribution limits====
A taxpayer can generally make contributions to a health savings account for a given tax year until the deadline for filing the individual&#x27;s income tax returns for that year, which is typically April 15. All contributions to a health savings account from both the employer and the employee count toward the annual maximum.

===Investments===
Funds in a health savings account can be invested in a manner similar to investments in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Investment earnings are sheltered from taxation until the money is withdrawn and can be sheltered even then, as discussed in the section below.

Investments in a health savings account can be directed by the individual. While a typical health savings account custodian may offer investments such as certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, certain financial institutions provide accounts offering alternative investments which can be made inside the health savings account. Internal Revenue Code Section 408 prohibits a health savings account to invest in collectibles and life insurance policies, but health savings accounts can have investments in real estate, precious metals, public and private stock, notes, and more.

While health savings accounts can be rolled over from fund to fund, a health savings account cannot be rolled into an Individual Retirement Account or a 401(k) retirement plan, and funds from such investment vehicles cannot be rolled into health savings account, except for the one-time Individual Retirement Account transfer mentioned earlier. Unlike some employer contributions to a 401(k) retirement plan, all health savings account contributions belong to the participant immediately, regardless of the deposit source. A person contributing to a health savings account is under no obligation to contribute to an employer-sponsored health savings account, but an employer may require that payroll contributions be made only to the employer-sponsored health savings account plan.

===Withdrawals===
Health savings account participants do not have to obtain advance approval from their health savings account trustee or their medical insurer to withdraw funds, and their funds are not subject to income tax if they are made for qualified medical expenses. They include costs for services and items covered by the health plan but subject to cost-sharing such as a deductible and coinsurance, or co-payments as well as many other expenses not covered under medical plans, such as dental, vision and chiropractic care; durable medical equipment such as eyeglasses and hearing aids; and transportation expenses related to medical care. Over-the-counter medications were also eligible until December 31, 2010, when the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act stipulated HSA funds could no longer be used to buy over-the-counter drugs without a doctor&#x27;s prescription. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the passage of the CARES Act once again made over-the-counter drugs reimbursable without a prescription for amounts paid after Dec. 31, 2019. The CARES Act also recognized menstrual care products as medical expenses, allowing for those products to be purchased or reimbursed with HSA funds.

Health insurance premiums are generally not HSA eligible, except for some specific cases such as COBRA premiums, premiums while on unemployment, certain Medicare expenses, and long-term care insurance premiums. According to the IRS, insurance premiums are not considered qualified medical expenses, with some exceptions like long-term care insurance.

There are several ways that funds in a health savings account can be withdrawn. Some health savings accounts include a debit card, some supply checks for account holder use, and some allow for a reimbursement process similar to medical insurance. Most health savings accounts have more than one possible method for withdrawal, and the methods available vary. Checks and debits do not have to be made payable to the provider. Funds can be withdrawn for any reason, but withdrawals that are not for documented qualified medical expenses are subject to income taxes and a 20% penalty. The 20% penalty is waived for persons who have reached the age of 65 or have become disabled at the time of the withdrawal. Then, only income tax is paid on the withdrawal and in effect, the account has grown tax-deferred. Medical expenses continue to be tax free. Prior to January 1, 2011, when new rules governing health savings accounts in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act went into effect, the penalty for non-qualified withdrawals was 10%.

Account holders are required to retain documentation for their qualified medical expenses. Failure to retain and provide documentation could cause the IRS to rule that withdrawals were not for qualified medical expenses and subject the taxpayer to additional penalties.

There is no deadline for self-reimbursements of qualified medical expenses incurred after the health savings accounts was established. Health savings account participants can take advantage by paying for medical costs out of pocket and retaining receipts but allowing their accounts to grow tax-free. Money can then be withdrawn years later for any reason up to the value of the receipts.

When a person dies, the funds in their health savings account are transferred to the beneficiary named for the account. If the beneficiary is a surviving spouse, the transfer is tax-free. If the beneficiary is not a spouse, the account stops being a health savings account, and the fair market value of the health savings account (less any unreimbursed qualified medical expenses of the decedent paid within the 1 year anniversary of his death) becomes taxable to the beneficiary in the year in which the health savings account owner dies.

==Compared to medical savings accounts==
Health savings accounts are similar to medical savings account (MSA) plans that were authorized by the federal government before health savings account plans. Health savings accounts can be used with some high-deductible health plans. Health savings accounts came into being after legislation was signed by President George W. Bush on December 8, 2003. The law went into effect on January 1, 2004.

Health savings accounts differ in several ways from medical savings accounts. Perhaps the most significant difference is that employers of all sizes can offer a health savings account and insurance plan to employees. Medical savings accounts were limited to the self-employed and employers with 50 or fewer employees.

==Benefits==
The premium for a high-deductible health plan is generally less than the premium for traditional health insurance. A higher deductible lowers the premium because the insurance company no longer pays for routine healthcare, and insurance underwriters believe that Americans who see a relationship between medical cost and their bank accounts will consume less medical care, shop for lower-cost options, and be more vigilant against excess and fraud in the health care industry. Introducing consumer-driven supply and demand and controlling inflation in health care and health insurance were among the government&#x27;s goals in establishing these plans.

With health savings accounts, in catastrophic situations, the maximum out-of-pocket expense legal liability can be less than that of a traditional health plan. That is because a qualified high-deductible health plan can cover 100% after the deductible, involving no coinsurance.

Health savings accounts also give the flexibility not available in some traditional health plans to pay on a pretax basis for qualified medical expenses not covered in standard or HSA-eligible insurance plans, which may include dental, orthodontic, vision, and other approved expenses.

Health savings accounts also have an advantage over flexible spending accounts since deposits are not necessarily tied to expenses in a particular plan or calendar year. They are automatically rolled over for future medical expenses or may be used to reimburse qualified expenses from prior years as long as the expense was qualified under a health savings account plan at the time that the expense was incurred.

Over time, if medical expenses are low and contributions are made regularly to the health savings account, the account can accumulate significant assets that can be used for health care tax-free or used for retirement on a tax-deferred basis.

The high-deductible health plan, when combined with a health savings account, is the only health insurance plan option available that can possibly have a net gain of value during the year if the funds are invested in the health savings account.

A recent industry survey found that in July 2007 over 80% of health savings account plans provided first-dollar coverage for preventive care. It was true of virtually all health savings account plans offered by large employers and over 95% of the plans offered by small employers. It was also true of 59% of the plans that were purchased by individuals. In terms of Medicare, Plan F is considered a first-dollar coverage plan, as it has no out-of-pocket expenses on covered services.

All of the plans offered first-dollar preventive care benefits included annual physicals, immunizations, well-baby and well-child care, mammograms, and Pap tests; 90% included prostate cancer screenings, and 80% included colon cancer screenings.

They in fact encourage customers of all backgrounds to constrain costly spending and obtain more preventive health care. In Indiana, those with health savings accounts are 98% satisfied.

==Criticism==
Some consumer organizations, such as Consumers Union, and many medical organizations, such as the American Public Health Association, oppose health savings accounts because, in their opinion, they benefit only healthy, younger people and make the health care system more expensive for everyone else. According to Stanford economist Victor Fuchs, &quot;The main effect of putting more of it on the consumer is to reduce the social redistributive element of insurance.&quot;

Critics contend that low-income people, who are more likely to be uninsured, do not earn enough to benefit from the tax breaks offered by health savings accounts. These tax breaks are too modest, when compared to the actual cost of insurance, to persuade significant numbers to buy this coverage.

One industry study matched health savings account holders to the neighborhood income (&quot;neighborhood&quot; was defined as their census tract from the 2000 Census) and found that 3% of account holders lived in &quot;low-income&quot; neighborhoods (median incomes below $25,000 in 1999 dollars), 46% lived in lower-middle-income neighborhoods (median incomes between $25,000 and $50,000), 34% lived in middle-income neighborhoods (median incomes between $50,000 and $75,000), 12% lived in upper-income neighborhoods (median incomes between $75,000 and $100,000) and 5% lived in higher income neighborhoods (median incomes above $100,000).

In testimony before the US Senate Finance Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Health in 2006, advocacy group Commonwealth Fund said that all evidence to date shows that health savings accounts and high-deductible health plans worsen, rather than improve, the US health system&#x27;s problems.

Funds in a health savings account that are not held in savings accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are subject to market risk, as is any other investment. While the potential upside from investment gains can be viewed as a benefit, the subsequent downside, as well as the possibility of capital loss, may make the health savings account a poor option for some. And information about the maintenance fees, interest rates and investment lineups of health savings accounts is not easy to find.

==Consumer satisfaction==
Consumer satisfaction results have been mixed. While a 2005 survey by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association found widespread satisfaction among health savings account customers, a survey published in 2007 by employee benefits consultants Towers Perrin came to the opposite conclusion; it found that employees currently enrolled in such plans were significantly less satisfied with many elements of the health benefit plan compared to those enrolled in traditional health benefit plans.

In 2006, a Government Accountability Office report concluded: &quot;HSA-eligible plan enrollees who participated in GAO&#x27;s focus groups generally reported positive experiences, but most would not recommend the plans to all consumers. Few participants reported researching cost before obtaining health care services, although many researched the cost of prescription drugs. Most participants were satisfied with their HSA-eligible plans and would recommend them to healthy consumers, but not to those who use maintenance medication, have a chronic condition, have children, or may not have the funds to meet the high deductible.&quot;

According to the Commonwealth Fund, early experience with HSA-eligible high-deductible health plans reveals low satisfaction, high out-of-pocket costs, and cost-related access problems. A survey conducted with the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that people enrolled in HSA-eligible high-deductible health plans were much less satisfied with many aspects of their health care than adults in more comprehensive plans.

* People in these plans allocate substantial amounts of income to their health care, especially those who have poorer health or lower incomes.
* Adults in high-deductible health plans are far more likely to delay or avoid getting needed care, or to skip medications, because of the cost. Problems are particularly pronounced among those with poorer health or lower incomes.
* Few Americans in any health plan have the information they need to make decisions. Just 12 to 16 percent of insured adults have information from their health plan about the quality or cost of care provided by their doctors and hospitals.

Some policy analysts say that consumer satisfaction doesn&#x27;t reflect quality of health care. Researchers at RAND Corporation and Department of Veterans Affairs asked 236 vulnerable elderly patients at two managed care plans to rate their care, then examined care in medical records, as reported in &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot;. There was no correlation. &quot;Patient ratings of health care are easy to obtain and report, but do not accurately measure the technical quality of medical care,&quot; said John T. Chan, UCLA, lead author.

==Health policy==
According to a 2006 Zogby poll, seven in ten voters back Congressional action to allow HSA participants to pay for their insurance premiums using money in their savings plans.

<doc id="797778" wikidata="Q2890919" url="?curid=797778" title="Amnon Rubinstein">
<text>Amnon Rubinstein (, 5 September 1931 – 18 January 2024) was an Israeli legal scholar, politician
and recipient of the Israel Prize. A member of the Knesset between 1977 and 2002, he served in several ministerial positions. He is referred to as the “founding father of Israeli Constitutional Law” In later life he was dean of the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) in Herzliya and a patron of Liberal International.

==Biography==
Rubinstein was born in Tel Aviv to Aharon, a building contractor and founder of the &quot;Rubinstein Group&quot;, and Rachel, who immigrated from Poland to Israel in the early 1920s. His family opposed Labor Zionism and in his youth, he supported the Irgun. Rubinstein was active in public life from a young age. In the early 1950s, he was a member of the Volunteers&#x27; Row, a public organization aimed at fighting corruption and helping new immigrants. He attended the Geula Commercial High School in Tel Aviv and later at a high school in Baltimore, United States. During his mandatory service in the Israel Defense Forces, he served as an officer in the Artillery Corps. He later retrained and served in the anti-aircraft unit, continuing his service there in the reserves.

After his military service, Rubinstein studied in law, economics, and international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He did his legal internship at the State Attorney&#x27;s Office and also with attorney Haim Yosef Zadok, who later became the Minister of Justice. Rubinstein was licensed as a lawyer in 1961. He received his Ph.D. in law from the London School of Economics in 1960. His doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;Void and Voidable Actions in Administrative Law&quot;, was published as a book by Oxford University Press.

At the age of 25, during his studies, Rubinstein married Roni a fellow student and granddaughter of Jacob and Perla Shlush, founders of Tel Aviv. They met at Kibbutz Afikim during fortification work prior to the Suez Crisis. Roni later became a lawyer, and the couple had a son and a daughter.

===Political career===
Rubinstein returned to public activism after the Yom Kippur War. In March 1974, he co-founded the Shinui Party. Shinui merged with other liberal groups to form Democratic Movement for Change (Dash) in November 1976. Dash won 15 seats in the 1977 elections, but did not achieve its aim of being a decisive political force as Menachem Begin formed a government without its support. When Dash joined Begin’s government in November of that year, Rubinstein refused to join the coalition, arguing that its platform was insufficiently represented in the agreement. 

Dash split into three parties on September 14, 1978. Rubinstein led a faction called the Movement for Change and Initiative, later renamed Shinui – Center Party. The new Shinui was elected to the 10th Knesset, the 11th Knesset, and the 12th Knesset. In 1992, Shinui merged with the Ratz and Mapam parties to form Meretz.

Rubinstein significantly advanced the Israeli Constitution Project. During the 12th Knesset, he initiated the proposal for the Basic Law on Human Rights and suggested splitting it into four separate proposals, including the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and the Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation. This strategy led to the successful passage of both laws.

Elected to the 9th Knesset in the 1977 elections, Rubinstein and served continuously until 2002. He held various leadership roles, including chairing the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee (in the 15th Knesset), the Economic Affairs Committee (in the 14th Knesset), and the State Control Committee (in the 15th Knesset). He was also a member of the Judicial Selection Committee.

In 1999, Avraham Burg, the Speaker of the Knesset, received a false message from Zalman Shoshi claiming that Rubinstein had died. In response, the Knesset members held a moment of silence in Rubinstein&#x27;s memory, despite the fact that he was still alive. During the session, Burg delivered a eulogy and recited the El Malei Rachamim.

Rubinstein announced his resignation from the Knesset in July 2002, which took effect in October of that year. 

Rubinstein was a Liberal International patron and previously as a vice president of the organization.

==== In the Government ====
In 1984, Rubinstein was appointed Minister of Communications in the National Unity Government led by Shimon Peres. He held this position until 1987, serving in the 21st and 22nd Israeli governments. During his tenure, he introduced several reforms, including the establishment of commercial television, cable television, and regional radio stations. 

Following the 1992 elections and the formation of Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s government, Rubinstein was appointed Minister of Science and Technology and Minister of Energy and Infrastructure. During this period, he initiated the Electricity Sector Law, 1996, which led to the creation of the Public Utilities Authority – Electricity. He also worked to introduce competition in the fuel industry by breaking the monopoly of fuel companies on imports.
In 1994, Rubinstein was appointed Minister of Education, Culture, and Sport after Shulamit Aloni&#x27;s resignation. He held the position until 1996. As Minister of Education, Rubinstein gained popularity for his liberal views, particularly on high school matriculation exams and his criticism of the Psychometric Entrance Test, remarking that he might not have been able to study law had such a test existed during his time.

Rubinstein introduced two major reforms during his tenure. The first focused on restructuring matriculation exams. Under his leadership, the Ministry of Education increased the matriculation pass rate by implementing measures such as eliminating external exams for some core subjects. Between 1994 and 1996, the matriculation eligibility rate rose by over 5%, reaching approximately 45% of each student cohort.

The second reform involved the establishment of academic colleges. This initiative included both state-funded institutions, such as the Tel Aviv–Yafo Academic College, and privately funded ones, like the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya. 

After retiring from politics, Rubinstein became a vocal critic of the Israeli left. He accused the left of becoming increasingly radical in efforts to accommodate Palestinian rights. Following the signing of the Geneva Initiative by then-Meretz leader Yossi Beilin, Rubinstein left Meretz, opposing its compromise on the Law of Return.

In 2007, during a legal debate over proposed judicial reforms by Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann, Rubinstein supported several of Friedmann&#x27;s initiatives. He co-initiated a petition endorsing these reforms, stating: 

===Academic career===
In 1963, Rubinstein became the first dean of the Faculty of Law at Tel Aviv University, a position he held until 1970. His research focused on the constitutional law of Israel, exploring topics such as the state&#x27;s nature, Zionism, the status of the Law of Return, and the civil rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel. In 2006, Rubinstein was awarded the Israel Prize for legal research. The judging panel described him as: 

After retiring from the Knesset in 2002, Rubinstein served as the dean of the Radzyner School of Law at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya from 2002 to 2004 and briefly as the president of the Interdisciplinary Center.

He also held positions as a visiting professor at international academic institutions, including Stanford University and Columbia University.

===Journalism and literature===
Rubinstein had a media career as a columnist and commentator. In the 1960s, he wrote articles criticizing religious coercion and concessions made to religious political parties. He gained fame as a popular columnist and interviewee. Between 1969 and 1972, he hosted a debate program on Israel Educational Television titled &quot;Boomerang&quot;. From 1964 until 2004, he was a member of the editorial board of &quot;Haaretz&quot; and a regular contributor, focusing on issues of religion and state and addressing antisemitism, particularly that which he attributed to the political left in Europe. He also wrote regularly for the &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot; weekend supplement and international publications, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 2005, Rubinstein published his first novel, &quot;The Blanket&quot;, which explored interconnected stories of Israeli characters from pre-state days to the present, addressing central themes in Israeli society. He followed this with &quot;Highway No. 5&quot; (2006), &quot;The Sea Above Us&quot; (2007), &quot;Separate Entrance&quot; (2009), and &quot;Forbidden Loves&quot; (2010). In 2022, he published the futuristic novel &quot;Methuselah&quot;.

Rubinstein hosted a radio program on Kol HaMusika, &quot;A Musical Morning for Truck and Bus Drivers&quot;, from 2014 to 2015.

Rubinstein wrote extensively on the investigation and prosecution of public figures in Israel, arguing that enforcement bodies wield excessive and unchecked power over elected officials. He highlighted cases where such power appeared to have been misused.

=== Later years and death ===
In 2020, Rubinstein participated in &quot;The Future Archive&quot;, a documentation project highlighting the generation of intellectuals who significantly influenced early Israeli culture.

Rubinstein lived in Tel Aviv and died on January 18, 2024. He was survived by a son and a daughter.

In 2006, Rubinstein won the Israel Prize, for law. The Israel Prize award committee provided the following endorsement for its decision:

In 2003, Rubinstein was named a Knight of Quality Government in the Lifetime Achievement category by the Movement for Quality Government.

He received the Hashin Prize for Academic Excellence in Law in 2010, the Gorney Prize for Public Law (2016) for his contribution to public law, the ISEF Award for social contribution in 2013, the Herzog Prize for unique contributions to Israel (2018), and the Ramat Gan Literary Award (2015). In 2022, he was awarded the EMET Prize for Law.

<doc id="797780" wikidata="Q894613" url="?curid=797780" title="Lake Bosumtwi">
<text>Lake Bosumtwi is the only natural lake in Ghana. It is situated within an ancient impact crater that is about in diameter. It is about south-east of Kumasi, the capital of Ashanti, and is a popular recreational area. There are about 30 villages near the crater lake of Lake Bosumtwi, with a combined population of about 70,000. The most popular amongst the villages where tourists usually settle is Abono.

The Ashanti consider Bosumtwi a sacred lake. According to traditional belief, the souls of the dead come here to bid farewell to the goddess Asase Ya. Because of this, it is considered permissible to fish in the lake only from wooden planks. Among the fish species in the lake is the endemic cichlid &quot;Hemichromis frempongi&quot;, and the near-endemic cichlids &quot;Tilapia busumana&quot; and &quot;T. discolor&quot;.

== Impact crater ==
The Lake Bosumtwi impact crater is in diameter, slightly larger than the present lake which is approximately across, and is estimated to be 1.07 million years old (Pleistocene period).

The depth of crater is approximately , but, if counted together with the depth of lake sediments - .

The crater has been partly eroded, and is situated in dense rainforest, making it difficult to study and confirm its origin by meteorite impact. Shock features such as shatter cones are largely overgrown by vegetation or covered by the lake. However, drilling of the crater&#x27;s central uplift beneath the lake floor has recently provided an abundance of shocked materials for scientific study. Tektites, believed to be from this impact, are found in the neighbouring country of Ivory Coast, and related microtektites have been found in deep sea sediments west of the African continent.

A work based on a statistical study of past numerical orbital simulations of the impact event asserts that the possible origin of the impactor is an asteroid coming from the middle main-belt at a high inclination (&gt;17 degrees).

== Climate history ==
Before the asteroid impact, the area was a lush rainforest filled with animals. Following the impact, the resulting crater filled with water forming Lake Bosumtwi.

Periods of heavy rainfall filled the crater with water, causing the lake level to rise above the lowest points of the rim. Such periods are evidenced from fossils of fish found on hilltops. Water even flowed from the basin through an overflow channel. However, there were also times when the water level was so low that the rainforest entered the basin rendering the lake only a small pond. Such a period, according to legend and now proved by paleoclimate records, lasted until about 300 years ago.

== Human history ==

The legends say that in 1648 an Ashanti hunter named Akora Bompe from the city of Asaman was chasing an injured antelope through the rainforest. Suddenly, the animal disappeared in a small pond. It was as if this body of water wanted to save the animal&#x27;s life. The hunter never got the antelope, though he settled close to the water and started catching fish. This place he named &quot;Bosomtwe&quot;, meaning &quot;antelope god&quot;. This story suggests that at that time the lake level was very low. The large dead trees standing offshore in the lake also evidence this, for they are over 300 years old.

The following centuries saw several wars about the lake as both the Ashanti and the Akim clashed, each claiming the area. The Ashanti prevailed. Each village in the lake area has its own shrine or fetish grove. With the arrival of Christianity, some of people gave up former beliefs, though many continue to seek traditional help in bad times or against diseases.

The Abrodwum Stone is held to be the spiritual centre of the lake. Here, when there is such poor fishing it is considered a bad omen, the lake people sacrifice a cow. This act is celebrated in the presence of the Ashanti king, the Asantehene. In the ceremony, the cow&#x27;s innards are given to the stone and the rest is thrown into the lake. The crowd rushes into the water with cutlasses and axes to take their share of the meat.

There is a traditional taboo against touching the water with iron and modern boats are not considered appropriate. The padua, a wooden plank requiring considerable skill to maneuver, is the legitimate method. Other taboos such as not washing, bathing or throwing effluents into the Lake that were formerly strictly observed, aided in maintaining the purity and health of the Lake. However, these taboos are not observed by residents or visitors due to their weak implementation by the Abono Traditional Council.

There are current environmental concerns, including overfishing and inadequate farming methods.
The growing population increased demand for fish. Excessive fishing led to steadily decreasing catches, forcing increased reliance on agriculture. As more and more of the hills are converted into farmland, exposing the surface to the heavy rainfalls, soil erosion becomes an ever-greater problem.
In addition there is the changing lake level. Many villages have been submerged several times forcing the people to move up the slopes or outside the basin. That is the origin of such double names as Pipie No.1 and Pipie No.2.

The lake is a popular resort area with local people for swimming, fishing and boat trips. The lakeside village of Amakom has a small hospital with a doctor residing on premise, called Lake Bosumtwi Methodist Clinic, providing emergency services by boat and 4x4 ambulance.

<text>Proceedings of the Royal Society is the main research journal of the Royal Society. The journal began in 1831 and was split into two series in 1905:
* Series A: for papers in physical sciences and mathematics. 
* Series B: for papers in life sciences.

Many landmark scientific discoveries are published in the Proceedings, making it one of the most important science journals in history. The journal contains several articles written by prominent scientists such as Paul Dirac, Werner Heisenberg, Ernest Rutherford, Erwin Schrödinger, William Lawrence Bragg, Lord Kelvin, J.J. Thomson, James Clerk Maxwell, Dorothy Hodgkin and Stephen Hawking. 
In 2004, the Royal Society began &quot;The Journal of the Royal Society Interface&quot; for papers at the interface of physical sciences and life sciences. 

==History==
The journal began in 1831 as a compilation of abstracts of papers in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;, the older Royal Society publication, that began in 1665. 

The journal has changed names several times. Initially it was called &quot;Abstracts of the Papers Communicated to the Royal Society of London&quot;. In 1854, the name became &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society of London&quot;. In 1905, the journal rebranded and was split into 
*&quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Containing Papers of a Mathematical and Physical Character&quot; 
* &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character&quot;.

, the two series are called
* &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences&quot; 
* &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences&quot;.

Proceedings of the Royal Society is now the Royal Society&#x27;s main research journal, while &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; publishes articles from invited authors in themed issues.

==&quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences &quot;==
&quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society A&quot; publishes peer-reviewed research articles in the mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences. Since 2022, the Editor-in-Chief is Professor Jane Hillston FRS – the journal&#x27;s first ever female Editor-in-Chief. According to &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal has an impact factor of 3.5

== &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences&quot; ==

&quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society B&quot; publishes research related to biological sciences. the editor-in-chief is Professor Spencer Barrett. Topics covered in particular include ecology, behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology, as well as epidemiology, human biology, neuroscience, palaeontology, psychology, and biomechanics. The journal publishes predominantly research articles and reviews, as well as comments, replies, and commentaries. In 2005, &quot;Biology Letters&quot; (originally a supplement to &quot;Proceedings B&quot;), was launched as an independent journal publishing short articles from across biology. According to &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal has an impact factor of 4.7.

==Access policy==

All articles are available free at the journals&#x27; websites after one year for &quot;Proceedings B&quot; and two years for &quot;Proceedings A&quot;. Eleven years after publication they return to being behind a paywall, then enter the free digital archive seventy years after publication. Authors may have their articles made immediately open access (under Creative Commons license) on payment of an article processing charge. Since January 2023 &quot;Proceedings A&quot; and &quot;Proceedings B&quot; are online only.

<doc id="797784" wikidata="Q3351804" url="?curid=797784" title="Omagh (film)">
<text>Omagh is a 2004 Irish film dramatising the events surrounding the Omagh bombing and its aftermath, co-produced by Irish state broadcaster RTÉ and UK network Channel 4, and directed by Pete Travis. It was first shown on television in both countries in May, 2004.

Michael Gallagher, whose son Aiden (Paul Kelly) was killed in the bombing, is played by Gerard McSorley, originally from Omagh. Out of respect for the residents of the town, it was filmed on location in Navan, County Meath, Republic of Ireland. The film ends with the Julie Miller song &quot;Broken Things&quot;, which was performed by local singer Juliet Turner at the memorial for the victims of the Omagh bombing.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes reported that 88% of critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average score of 7.2/10, however this is based upon a sample of only 8 reviews.

Critics particularly noted the gritty realism and powerful acting in the film. In his review, Scott Foundas of &quot;Variety&quot; said that it &quot;serves as a companion piece to writer producer Paul Greengrass&#x27; superb 2001 pic &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, but emerges as a startlingly powerful achievement in its own right&quot;.

== Awards ==
The film won a number of awards. Most notably, it won the 2005 BAFTA TV Award for Best Single Drama. It also won a &#x27;Discovery Award&#x27; at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. At the Irish Film and Television Awards, the film won the awards for &#x27;Best Irish Film&#x27; and &#x27;Best Actor (Gerard McSorley)&#x27;, and was nominated for a further five awards, including &#x27;Best Film Director&#x27;, &#x27;Best Script&#x27; and &#x27;Best Actress&#x27; for Michele Forbes.

<doc id="797785" wikidata="Q5287397" url="?curid=797785" title="Doctor Syn Returns">
<text>Doctor Syn Returns is the third in the series of Doctor Syn novels by Russell Thorndike. Published in 1935, it follows &quot;Doctor Syn on the High Seas&quot; and is followed by &quot;Further Adventures of Doctor Syn&quot;. It tells the story of Syn, who has tired of piracy, trying to settle down as the vicar of the little town of Dymchurch in Kent, England. 

==Plot==
In 1775, Syn&#x27;s attempt to live an obscure life fails when he is drawn into the local smuggling trade. To protect his parishioners from the agents of the King&#x27;s Revenue, Syn becomes the masked Scarecrow of Romney Marsh and becomes leader of the smugglers.

==Critical reception==
&quot;A triumph in its own particular class,&quot; said &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;. It received favorable reviews. The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; entreated Thorndike to write more novels. The Sunday Times noted that it had stylistic elements that were more graceful than most thrillers. &quot;The Observer&quot; singled out the gruesome cockroach death as particularly memorable.

Reviewing the US version of the novel for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, humorist Will Cuppy described it as old-fashioned and out of step with current trends in adventure novels, but nonetheless enjoyable. The &quot;New York Times&quot; likewise reviewed it favorably as very entertaining, with an improbable plot made less so by comparing it to the antics of contemporary Prohibition smugglers.

==Publication==
Originally published by Rich and Cowan in early 1935, it was also serialized in &quot;The Daily Herald&quot; that November.

An expanded version of the novel was published in the United States in 1935 by The Dial Press. It was retiled &quot;The Scarecrow Rides&quot;.

It has been reprinted many times in both hardcover and paperback editions, including by Cherry Tree Books (1938), Arrow Books (1959), Panther (1964), Jarrolds (1966), Ballantine Books (1974) and other more recent small presses.

==Adaptations==
In 1944 a &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; adaptation of Thorndike&#x27;s novel was announced with the title &quot;Originally Syn&quot;, written by Thorndike and Emma Treckman, though it did not tour as planned.

Three years later, &quot;The Return of Doctor Syn&quot; by Russell Thorndike and Emma Treckman premiered at the Theatre Royal in Windsor on 17 November, 1947 for a short run. The cast included Thorndike as Christopher Syn, with Diana Calderwood, Ruth Goddard as Lady Caroline, Desmond Keith as Sir Anthony Cobtree. It was directed by John Counsell. Set in 1775, the plot follows the novel of &quot;Doctor Syn Returns&quot;. &quot;The Stage&quot; praised the production&#x27;s acting and design, with appreciation for the dramatic spectacle, though noted that &quot;pruning is needed.&quot;

In 2006, an abridged version of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Comprising half of a ten-part series titled &quot;Doctor Syn&quot;, it was read by Rufus Sewell.

<text>&quot;Funkytown&quot; is a song by American disco-funk group Lipps Inc., written and produced by Steven Greenberg and released by Casablanca Records in March 1980 as the second single from the group&#x27;s 1979 debut studio album &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot;.

The track was met with immediate commercial success, reaching number one on various record charts in different countries including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, West Germany and on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It quickly became the group&#x27;s signature song, selling over eight million copies worldwide and becoming their most successful song.

==Composition and lyrics==
Sung by Lipps Inc.&#x27;s lead vocalist Cynthia Johnson, the tune features the narrator pining for a metaphorical place that will &quot;keep me movin&#x27;, keep me groovin&#x27; with some energy&quot;, while Lipps Inc. members were dreaming of relocating from Minneapolis to New York City. The song is in time with a key of C major.

==Chart performance==
In the United States, &quot;Funkytown&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on March 29, 1980 and spent four weeks at number one, from May 31 to June 21, 1980. It also topped the Disco Top 60 chart for four non-consecutive weeks and peaked at number two on the Hot Soul Singles chart for four weeks also, from May 24 to June 21, 1980. &quot;Funkytown&quot; was first certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on May 23, 1980 and later Platinum on July 17, 1980. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked the song as the eighth most popular single of 1980. It is Lipps Inc.&#x27;s only US Top 40 hit single.

Elsewhere, &quot;Funkytown&quot; was a number-one hit in countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and West Germany, and peaked at number two in Finland, Sweden and on the UK Singles Chart.

==Music videos==
&quot;Funkytown&quot; has at least two music videos. In one, an unidentified black woman lip synching Johnson&#x27;s vocals dances with some women in a pub. In another video, Doris D, who fronted Lipps Inc. in the Netherlands and West Germany, dances while lip synching the vocals. Johnson&#x27;s website claims that the singer &quot;was never asked to perform a video of &#x27;Funkytown″&quot;.

==Legacy and impact==
In 1997, DJ John Acquaviva listed &quot;Funkytown&quot; with his top ten tracks, saying &quot;It&#x27;s always been one of my favorite songs. It&#x27;s got an amazing bassline that sounds great on a good system and people love it. Some people in Germany I know are reissuing it.&quot; In 2009, VH1 ranked the song at number 37 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 1980s&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Time Out&quot; ranked it at number 44 on its list of &quot;The 100 best party songs&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;ThoughtCo.&quot; ranked the song at number seven on its list of the &quot;25 Best Dance Pop Songs of All Time&quot;.

<text>Bree Williamson Roberts (born December 28, 1979) is a Canadian actress.

==Career==
After graduating from Bayview Glen School, she completed her education at the University of Toronto. She played the role of Jessica Buchanan on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from February 5, 2003 until the series cancelation in 2012. The character is the daughter of original character Viki Lord Buchanan (played by Daytime Emmy Award-winner Erika Slezak since 1971), and gave Williamson the opportunity to portray Jessica&#x27;s alternate personalities &quot;Tess&quot;, from 2005 to 2006 and again starting in 2008 and 2011.

Williamson had previously auditioned for the role of Jen Rappaport on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, but was rejected because of her resemblance to actress Erin Torpey (the two looked nearly identical), who was playing Jessica Buchanan on the show at the time. When Torpey resigned in January 2003, Williamson was remembered by the casting department and offered the role of Jessica. She so closely resembled Torpey that many viewers did not notice the change.

In 2009, 2010 and 2011 Williamson was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress for the role of Jessica. In 2009, Williamson appeared as Brandeis on &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; in the episode &quot;The Grandfather: Part II&quot;; she reprised the role in the 2010 episode &quot;The Empire Strikes Jack&quot;. In 2012, Williamson joined the cast of &quot;Haven&quot; as Dr. Claire Callahan for Season 3, which began airing in September 2012. In 2013, Williamson appeared in flashbacks as Vivian Bowers, the murder victim in the NBC TV series &quot;Deception&quot;.

In 2015, Williamson appeared as April Littleton, a photographer going back to her hometown, in &quot;Portrait of Love&quot;, which premiered on Hallmark Channel on March 7. On May 26, 2016, it was announced that Williamson would originate the role of Claudette Beaulieu on July 5, 2016, on &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Personal life==
On December 29, 2005 Williamson married Josh Evans. In the July 3, 2007 edition of &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;, she announced that she and Evans had separated in June 2007; they later divorced. In the September 2006 issue of &quot;ABC Soaps in Depth&quot;, Williamson revealed she had just received her green card and proudly proclaimed, &quot;Now you can&#x27;t kick me out!&quot;

In 2006 Williamson was a co-host for the Planned Parenthood Awards, which honor individuals and organizations for &quot;their contributions to protecting women&#x27;s rights.&quot; She also appeared in a public service announcement for breast cancer awareness. In 2008, Williamson married Michael Roberts. On September 21, 2010, Williamson and Roberts welcomed their first child, McGreggor Edward Roberts.

<doc id="797796" wikidata="Q1346595" url="?curid=797796" title="Hymie Weiss">
<text>Earl J. &quot;Hymie&quot; Weiss (born Henryk Wojciechowski; January 25, 1898 – October 11, 1926), was a Polish-American mob boss who became a leader of the Prohibition-era North Side Gang and a bitter rival of Al Capone. He was known as &quot;the only man Al Capone feared&quot;.

==Early years==
Henryk Wojciechowski was born in present-day Sieradz, Congress Poland, to Walenty S. Wojciechowski and Maria Bruszkiewicz. His parents emigrated to the United States in 1901 when Henryk was 3 years old and, upon their arrival in the new country, took the names of William and Mary Weiss. They settled in Buffalo, New York and later moved to an Irish district in the north of Chicago. He had four siblings who survived infancy: Bernard (Bruno), Frederick, Violet and Joseph. Two others died during infancy.

As a teenager, Weiss became a petty criminal. After he upset a fragrance shelf during a botched burglary as a youth, police dubbed him &quot;The Perfume Burglar&quot;. He befriended the Irish-American Dean O&#x27;Banion. With Weiss and George &quot;Bugs&quot; Moran, O&#x27;Banion established the North Side Gang. Around that time Henryk started to use the name Earl, a name bestowing the prestige of British earldom onto its holder. The criminal organization they founded eventually controlled bootlegging and other illicit activities in the northern part of Chicago. He was nicknamed &quot;Hymie&quot; and &quot;Hymie the Pole&quot;, later in his career. Despite the &quot;Jewish-sounding&quot; surname he was Polish-Roman Catholic. Besides his gun he always carried a rosary. Weiss was known to be against prostitution, fueling his scorn of the city&#x27;s south side vice cartels.

Weiss is credited with the first known use of the organized crime practice of the &quot;one way ride&quot;, referring to a planned murder where the victim is lured or coerced into driving with their killers and is killed either en route to or upon arrival at a destination. Weiss was seen driving off with Steve Wisniewski, a local criminal who had recently hijacked a Northside beer shipment, in July 1921.

==Personality==
When Weiss&#x27; brother Fred was questioned about him in 1926, he replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen him once in twenty years... that was when he shot me, six years ago&quot;. When photographers tried to snap his picture, Weiss would glare at them and say in a low voice, &quot;You take a picture of me and I&#x27;ll kill you&quot;.

On one occasion, Weiss chased away at gunpoint a deputy U.S. Marshal who came to arrest a friend for violation of the Mann Act at a party he was attending. The marshal returned with reinforcements, arrested the friend, and confiscated a cache of alcohol and weapons. After the raid, Weiss filed a lawsuit to recover silk shirts and socks that he claimed the marshals had stolen; neither the government&#x27;s charges nor the lawsuit came to anything.

Chicago journalist James O&#x27;Donnell Bennett is reputed to have called Weiss &quot;the brainiest leader that North Side boozedom ever had&quot;.

==North Side Gang leader==
Dean O&#x27;Banion was killed at his headquarters flower shop on November 10, 1924. Weiss succeeded his friend as North Side gang leader and embarked on a campaign of revenge against the Torrio-Capone Gang and the Genna Brothers. Weiss was terminally ill with cancer, which made him heedless of his own safety when conducting bold attacks on Torrio&#x27;s gang.

In January 1925, the North Siders shot up Al Capone&#x27;s car on 55th and State St., missing Capone but wounding members of his entourage. Later that month, Weiss, Moran, and Drucci ambushed Torrio outside his southside home. Torrio was shot several times and left for dead. Torrio survived and recovered in a local hospital. Shortly after this incident, Torrio relinquished control of his gang to Al Capone. After Torrio&#x27;s flight to New York City, Chicago broke out into a city-wide gang war. Weiss allied his North Side Gang with the Westside O&#x27;Donnells, the Saltis-McErlane mob, and the GKW gang.

In August 1926, Weiss and Drucci (with their entourage) were attacked by a contingent of Capone gunmen, including Paul Ricca, who was arrested at the scene. The gun battle took place on South Michigan Avenue, near the Standard Oil Building. The North Side Gang leaders survived the attack, reportedly due in large part to Drucci&#x27;s personal efforts in driving off the assailants.

Weiss retaliated against Capone on September 20, 1926. A procession of ten vehicles unloaded gunfire into Capone&#x27;s Hawthorne Hotel, on 22nd St. in Cicero. Over 1000 rounds were fired. Police at the time believed Weiss, Drucci, Moran, the Gusenburg brothers, and other North Siders were the gunmen in the attack. Capone was on the premises at the time of the shooting, but was able to flee out of the back of the building during the ambush. Paul Ricca, who was wounded in this attack, reportedly warned Capone and others as the North Side convoy came down the street.

==Death==

Jury selection for a murder trial of Joe Saltis, with whom Weiss sought an alliance, began on October 11, 1926, and Weiss and four of his men were sighted there. With him that day were his bodyguard Sam Pellar, gangster Paddy Murray, attorney William W. O&#x27;Brien, and Benjamin Jacobs (an investigator for O&#x27;Brien). At four o&#x27;clock that afternoon, Weiss and his men left for their State Street headquarters, Schofield&#x27;s Flowers. The quintet parked their cars on Superior Street and rounded the corner to cross State. As they did, two gunmen hidden in a nearby rooming house opened fire with a submachine gun and shotgun. Weiss and Murray were fatally wounded by this first burst. William O&#x27;Brien was hit four times and staggered into a nearby stairwell. At the initial sound of gunfire, a panicked Sam Pellar drew his .38 and fired instinctively towards the shots, unintentionally hitting Weiss as he collapsed onto the sidewalk. Pellar and Jacobs, both wounded, staggered back the way they had come. Bullets followed them the whole way and some chipped the cornerstone of the Holy Name Cathedral directly across the street.

According to the Chicago Police, Jack McGurn was behind the tommy gun that day. Sam &quot;Golf Bag&quot; Hunt, was supporting McGurn from a nearby building, where police found his signature golf bag with a shotgun inside it after the murder. Frank Nitti is credited with masterminding the use of the machine-gun nest in Weiss&#x27; assassination. However, a witness, Charles E. McKibben, accused Pellar and Jacobs, the injured men, of having shot Weiss.

Weiss is buried at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois, the same place as Al Capone and Dean O&#x27;Banion. He was succeeded as leader of the North Side gang by Vincent Drucci.

==In popular culture==
Weiss and other Prohibition-era mobsters served as the basis for many gangster films of the 1930s. James Cagney, for example, based his character on both Weiss and Chicago gangland figure Dean O&#x27;Banion in &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; (1931).

In 2013 and 2014, Weiss is portrayed by Will Janowitz on the third and fourth seasons of &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;.

<text>Righteous Among the Nations ( ) is a title used by Yad Vashem to describe people who, for various reasons, made an effort to assist victims, including Jews, who were being exterminated by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. The term originates from the concept of , a legal term used to refer to non-Jewish observers of the Seven Laws of Noah.

== Endowment ==

=== Criteria of the Knesset ===
When Yad Vashem, the Shoah Martyrs&#x27; and Heroes&#x27; Remembrance Authority, was established in 1953 by the Knesset, one of its tasks was to commemorate the &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;. The Righteous were defined as non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust.

Since 1963, a commission headed by a justice of the Supreme Court of Israel has been charged with the duty of awarding the honorary title &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;. Guided in its work by certain criteria, the commission meticulously studies all documentation including evidence by survivors and other eyewitnesses, evaluates the historical circumstances and the element of risk to the rescuer, and then decides if the case meets the criteria. Those criteria are:

* Only a Jewish party can put forward a nomination.
* Helping a family member or helping a Jew who converted to Christianity is not ground for recognition.
* Assistance has to be repeated or substantial.
* Assistance has to be given without any financial gain expected in return (although covering expenses such as food is acceptable).

The award has been given without regard to the social rank of the helper. It has been given to royalty such as Princess Alice of Battenberg, Queen Mother Helen of Romania and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium but also to others like the philosopher Jacques Ellul, Salvadoran diplomat José Castellanos Contreras and to Amsterdam department store employee Hendrika Gerritsen.

=== Reception in Jerusalem ===
A person who is recognized as Righteous for having taken risks to help Jews during the Holocaust is awarded a medal in their name, a certificate of honor, and the privilege of having the name added to those on the Wall of Honor in the Garden of the Righteous at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem (the last is in lieu of a tree planting, which was discontinued for lack of space). The awards are distributed to the rescuers or their next of kin during ceremonies in Israel, or in their countries of residence through the offices of Israel&#x27;s diplomatic representatives. These ceremonies are attended by local government representatives and are given wide media coverage.

==== Israeli citizenship and legal benefits ====
The Yad Vashem Law authorizes Yad Vashem &quot;to confer honorary citizenship upon the Righteous Among the Nations, and if they have died, the commemorative citizenship of the State of Israel, in recognition of their actions&quot;. Anyone who has been recognized as &quot;Righteous&quot; is entitled to apply to Yad Vashem for the certificate. If the person is no longer alive, their next of kin is entitled to request that commemorative citizenship be conferred on the Righteous who has died.
In total, men and women from 51 countries have been recognized, amounting to more than 10,000 authenticated rescue stories. Yad Vashem&#x27;s policy is to pursue the program for as long as petitions for this title are received and are supported by evidence that meets the criteria.

Recipients who choose to live in the State of Israel are entitled to a pension equal to the average national wage and free health care, as well as assistance with housing and nursing care.

==Recipients settled in Israel==
At least 130 Righteous non-Jews have settled in Israel. They were welcomed by Israeli authorities, and were granted citizenship. In the mid-1980s, they became entitled to special pensions. Some of them had settled in British Mandatory Palestine before Israel&#x27;s establishment shortly after World War II, or in the early years of Israel, while others came later. Those who came earlier often spoke fluent Hebrew and have integrated into Israeli society. Children and grandchildren of Righteous Gentiles are entitled to a temporary residence visa in Israel, but not Israeli citizenship.

==Non-Jewish initiatives for the Righteous==
=== Christian honours ===
One Righteous Among the Nations, Saint Elizabeth Hesselblad of Sweden, has been canonized a saint in the Catholic Church. Seven others have been beatified: Giuseppe Girotti and Odoardo Focherini of Italy, Klymentiy Sheptytsky of Ukraine, Bernhard Lichtenberg of Germany, Sára Salkaházi of Hungary, and Józef and Wiktoria Ulma of Poland (together with their children).

Maria Skobtsova of Paris and her companions are recognised as martyrs in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Her feast day is 20 July.

Giuseppina De Muro, an Italian Catholic nun who saved over 500 people from deportation to concentration camps, was announced in 2024.

=== Secular honours ===

In 2015, Lithuania&#x27;s first street sign honoring a Righteous Among the Nations was unveiled in Vilnius. The street is named &quot;Onos Šimaitės gatvė&quot;, after Ona Šimaitė, a Vilnius University librarian who helped and rescued Jewish people in the Vilna Ghetto.

In Zvolen, Slovakia, the Park of Generous Souls commemorates the Righteous Among the Nations from Slovakia.

Beginning in 2018, China&#x27;s most significant World War II museum, the War of Resistance Museum, features China&#x27;s Righteous Among the Nations and other Chinese figures who helped Jews escape Europe.

==Number of awards by country==
, the award has been made to 28,217 people. Yad Vashem emphasises that the table is not representative of the effort or proportion of Jews saved per country, and notes that these numbers &quot;are not necessarily an indication of the actual number of rescuers in each country, but reflect the cases that were made available to Yad Vashem.&quot;

<text>Earl of Southampton was a title that was created three times in the Peerage of England.

Its first creation came in 1537 in favour of the courtier William FitzWilliam. He was childless and the title became extinct on his death in 1542.

Its second creation came in 1547 in favour of the politician Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Baron Wriothesley, Lord Chancellor between 1544 and 1547. He had already been created Baron Wriothesley (pronounced &quot;rose ley&quot; /ˈroʊzli/) in 1544, also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his third but only surviving son, the second Earl. On his death the titles passed to his second but only surviving son, the third Earl. He is best remembered as a patron of William Shakespeare. He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, the fourth Earl, who was a prominent statesman and served as Lord High Treasurer under Charles II between 1660 and 1667. In 1653 he had succeeded his father-in-law Francis Leigh, 1st Earl of Chichester as second Earl of Chichester according to a special remainder in the letters patent. However, Lord Southampton had no sons and the titles became extinct on his death in 1667.

The third creation came in 1670 for Barbara Palmer, mistress of Charles II. She was made Baroness Nonsuch and Duchess of Cleveland at the same time.

<doc id="797811" wikidata="Q2264301" url="?curid=797811" title="Donkey Kong Jr.">
<text>is a 1982 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for arcades. It is the sequel to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, but with the roles reversed compared to its predecessor: Mario is now the villain and Donkey Kong Jr. is trying to save his kidnapped father. It first released in arcades and, over the course of the decade, was released for a variety of home platforms. The game&#x27;s title is written out as Donkey Kong Junior in the North American arcade version and various conversions to non-Nintendo systems.

The game was principally designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and his coworker and the company&#x27;s chief engineer Gunpei Yokoi. Miyamoto also created the graphics for the title along with Yoshio Sakamoto. As with its predecessor, the music for the game was composed by Yukio Kaneoka.

==Gameplay==

Like its predecessor, &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; is a platform game. There are a total of four stages, each with a unique theme. DK Jr. can run left and right, jump, and grab vines/chains/ropes to climb higher on the screen. He can slide down faster by holding only one vine, or climb faster by holding two. Enemies include &quot;Snapjaws&quot;, which resemble bear traps with eyes; bird-like creatures called &quot;Nitpickers&quot;, some of which can attack by dropping eggs; and &quot;Sparks&quot; which roam across the wiring in one of Mario&#x27;s hideouts. DK Jr. can jump over these enemies while on platforms, switch from one vine/chain/rope to another to dodge them, or knock down pieces of fruit that will destroy every enemy they touch before falling off the bottom of the screen.

To pass the first three stages, DK Jr. must reach the key hanging next to his father&#x27;s cage, whereupon Mario flees while pushing the cage off the screen. In the fourth stage, DK Jr. must push six keys into locks on the topmost platform to free Donkey Kong. After a brief cutscene, the player is taken back to the first stage at an increased difficulty. A bonus timer runs throughout each stage, and any points remaining on it are added to the player&#x27;s score upon completion.

DK Jr. loses a life when he touches any enemy or projectile, falls too great a distance, touches the water and falls off the bottom of the screen or if the bonus timer counts down to zero. The game ends when the player loses all of their lives.

==Plot==
Donkey Kong has been defeated by Mario, who has put him in a cage in a forest. Donkey Kong&#x27;s son, Donkey Kong Jr., follows Mario in an attempt to free his father. Mario transports Donkey Kong to his Hideout via helicopter, before Mario takes the keys to Donkey Kong&#x27;s chains and places them around the building. Several enemies attack Donkey Kong Jr., but he escapes them and makes it to his father, releasing him from the chains as Mario falls to the ground. Donkey Kong Jr. saves Donkey Kong and the two set off together. Mario pursues the kongs, but flees after Donkey Kong knocks him back.

==Development==
During &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;’s development in 1981, Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s team had come up with several ideas and complete levels that would not fit into the game. They eventually began fleshing out these concepts, and these designs evolved into something all their own. The process was so far along, with even entire stages conceived, that one of the team members suggested they start working on another video game. The conversation happened around the same time that Nintendo wanted another Donkey Kong coin-op to capitalize on the original&#x27;s popularity, giving Miyamoto the opportunity to explore his newly established franchise. Originally, Miyamoto wanted the new game to star Donkey Kong himself, but there were problems with the character&#x27;s large size. They came up with the idea to make a smaller Donkey Kong who would be the son of Donkey Kong. Since they still wanted a big Donkey Kong on top of the screen, they came up with the plot of Mario capturing him after the events of the first game.

===Versions===
The order of the levels is different in different territories. In the Japanese version, the four levels appear in 1-2-3-4 sequence and then repeat, just as with the Japanese release of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. In the US version, the order is 1–4. 1–2–4, 1–3–4, 1-2-3-4 and then 1-2-3-4 from then on.

===Kill screen===
&quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; has a kill screen at level 22. Due to the level counter only having one digit, the counter shows numbers 1 to 9 in levels 1 to 9, seven blanks in levels 10 to 16, and the letters A to F in the levels 17–22. The kill screen occurs the same way as in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, where an integer overflow occurs after too big a result is given after a multiplication problem in the computing. The timer counts as if there are 700 points, then kills Donkey Kong Jr. until all lives are gone.

==Ports==
&quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; was made on the NES (for which it was one of three Japanese launch games), Family Computer Disk System, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Atari 8-bit computers, ColecoVision, Coleco Adam, and Intellivision. A BBC Micro conversion was made but unreleased. Three Game &amp; Watch versions of the game were also made. Two black-and-white versions for the New Wide Screen and Multi Screen handheld series (later under the model name &quot;Donkey Kong II&quot;), and a color version for the Tabletop and Panorama series. In 2002 the NES version was rereleased on the GBA add-on, the e-Reader.

==Reception==
In Japan, the original arcade version was the eighth-highest-grossing arcade game of 1982.

Raymond Dimetrosky of &quot;Video Games Player&quot; gave the ColecoVision version a positive review. He compared it favorably with another ColecoVision arcade conversion released at the same time, Sega&#x27;s &quot;Space Fury&quot;, writing that &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; has better graphics and gameplay. &quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine in 1984 reviewed the Coleco Adam version, calling it a &quot;supergame adaptation&quot; and the best conversion of the game.

&quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; received an award in the category of &quot;1984 Best Videogame Audio-Visual Effects (16K or more ROM)&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards, where the judges described it as &quot;great fun&quot;, and noted that the game was successful as a sequel–&quot;extend[ing] the theme and present[ing] a radically different play-action&quot; than its predecessor, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.

&quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; is regarded as one of the &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot; by the Killer List of Videogames. It was selected to be among five arcade games chosen for history&#x27;s first official video game world championship, which was filmed at Twin Galaxies in Ottumwa, Iowa by ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot; over the weekend of January 8–9, 1983.

&quot;Allgame&quot; gave a review score of 4 out of 5 stars praising the graphics and sound being &quot;exceptionally arcade-like&quot; and the controls and play mechanics being faithful to the arcade version.

==Legacy==
===Rereleases===
The NES version–along with its predecessor &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;–was re–released in 1988 in an NES compilation titled &quot;Donkey Kong Classics&quot;. This version was later released on the e-Reader and is available on the Virtual Console for the Wii. The NES version is also a playable game on &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, though a special password is needed from an official website which is now no longer available. &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; was made available for the Nintendo 3DS from the Nintendo eShop, released in Japan on April 18, 2012, in North America on June 14, and in Europe on August 23 and was given away free to the Ambassadors users before the full release. It was again released for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014. The arcade version of Donkey Kong Jr., featuring both the Japanese and American versions, was released by Hamster Corporation for the Nintendo Switch as part of the company&#x27;s Arcade Archives series in December 2018.

In 2004, Namco released an arcade cabinet which contained &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; and &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;

===Competitive play===
On August 10, 2008, Icarus Hall of Port Angeles, Washington, scored 1,033,000 points playing &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot;

On April 24, 2009, Steve Wiebe eclipsed Hall&#x27;s score, finishing with 1,139,800 points. On September 3, at 1984 Arcade in Springfield, Missouri, Mark L. Kiehl of Enid, Oklahoma surpassed Wiebe&#x27;s record with a score of 1,147,800. Steve Wiebe regained the record with a score of 1,190,400 on his home machine set on Tuesday, February 16, 2010. Mark Kiehl has since eclipsed the previous world record with a score of 1,307,500. In November 2016, Kiehl improved the record with a score of 1,412,200.

On July 3, 2023, Justin Elliott performed a score of 1,584,400 live on his Twitch channel to secure the World Record. The score was independently verified by the Donkey Kong Forum as well as Twin Galaxies.

===In popular culture===
The game spawned a cereal with fruit-flavored cereal pieces shaped like bananas and cherries.

The game was featured on numerous episodes of &quot;Starcade&quot;. Host Geoff Edwards noted that he had the arcade machine in his dressing room and found the game to be highly difficult.

Donkey Kong Jr. was a cartoon on &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot; (a series that aired on Saturday mornings from 1983 to 1985) with the title character voiced by Frank Welker.

Donkey Kong Jr. is one of the 8 playable characters in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; for the SNES. He is also a playable character in &quot;Mario&#x27;s Tennis&quot; on Virtual Boy and &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; on the Nintendo 64.

In the version of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; seen in &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot;, as well as the Game Boy Advance version, the king of World 4 was transformed into a young gorilla identical to Donkey Kong Jr.

Donkey Kong Jr. is among the characters in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; that players can transform into by use of Mystery Mushrooms.

<text>AirLand Battle was the overall conceptual framework that formed the basis of the US Army&#x27;s European warfighting doctrine from 1982 into the late 1990s. AirLand Battle emphasized close coordination between land forces acting as an aggressively maneuvering defense, and air forces attacking rear-echelon forces feeding those front line enemy forces. AirLand Battle replaced 1976&#x27;s &quot;Active Defense&quot; doctrine, and was itself replaced by &quot;Full Spectrum Operations&quot; in 2001.

==Background==
===DePuy reforms and Active Defense===

The basic concept of the Blitzkrieg and similar doctrines was for the attacker to secretly concentrate his forces across a limited frontage to gain a local superiority over the defenders, culminating in an attack with at least tactical surprise leading to a breakthrough, which is then rapidly exploited to threaten the rear areas and destabilize the entire defensive position.

====Conventional war====
As the Vietnam War wound down, the US Army started studying their organization and structure, looking for ways to better align it with real-world conflicts. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), under the direction of General William E. DePuy, was formed in 1973 to study these issues and produce updated doctrine for Army forces.

TRADOC concluded that there were two main possibilities for future conflicts, a major armored conflict in Europe, or a primarily infantry fight in other locations around the world. The latter possibility led to the Rapid Deployment Force, and in time, the formation of United States Central Command. The former was more problematic given the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s massive numerical superiority, especially given the ending of the draft.

====Rapid wars, forward defense====
When the Yom Kippur War broke out in 1973, it demonstrated a new lethality of conventional weapons, especially the anti-tank guided missile (ATGM). The new vulnerability of tanks, combined with the improved defensive power of the infantry, led to a revolution of thought within the US Army—that a war in Europe was winnable with conventional weapons. Impressed by the new weapons, DePuy started the process of re-arming the heavy divisions with weapons that would dramatically improve their firepower.

In DePuy&#x27;s view, firepower had increased so much that war would be won or lost almost immediately, in the first few massive battles. As Field Manual 100-5 noted, &quot;The US Army must above all else, prepare to win the first battle of the next war.&quot;

Since forces from the rear could not move forward quickly enough to take part in the titanic battles being envisioned, everyone had to be placed as close to the front lines as possible. The result was a new battlefield organization that moved the vast majority of US and allied forces much closer to the border between East and West Germany, in what became known as &quot;Forward Defense&quot;. As reinforcements from the US could play only a minor role, the war was a &quot;come as you are&quot; affair. Air power was key; as the battle increased in tempo and the Soviet forces attempted to break through the defenders, channels would naturally form that would be attacked by air.

A 1975 study showed that:
*The main battle tank and attack helicopter are highly compatible weapons systems that are best employed using offensive principles where their mobility, firepower, and survivability can be optimized.
*The bi-dimensional mobility capabilities and overlapping firepower characteristics of the main battle tank and attack helicopter are desirable and enhance the ability to achieve a favorable exchange ratio on the battlefield.
*The main battle tank, complemented by the attack helicopter, will remain a decisive antiarmor weapons system for the foreseeable future.

One problem that was noted soon after the introduction of the 1976 version of FM 100-5 was how to deal with the enemy&#x27;s reserve forces in the rear. There was the possibility that the US could win the first battle, only to meet a second unattrited reserve force soon after. A solution to this problem was not immediately forthcoming.

The results of war gaming the Active Defense doctrine was that by using this doctrine &quot;you would lose every time.&quot;

Military historian Gwynne Dyer also criticized the defence strategy as militarily senseless, used only because an effective defense in depth doctrine was considered politically unacceptable to West Germany since that would mean much of the country would have been overrun by Warsaw Pact forces in an invasion before they could be stopped. As a result of the political compromise, a concerted Warsaw Pact invasion would likely have been able to break through the thin defensive zone with their numerically superior conventional forces easily, which would have soon forced NATO to resort to tactical nuclear weapons to counter it, which would have likely escalated the war to a full-scale global nuclear war. Furthermore, the doctrine was considered by the Warsaw Pact to be a threatening policy, which they feared would have meant an inverted in-depth defence by NATO in an aggressive fashion which could have entailed invading the Warsaw Pact as a pre-emptive move to create the defensive buffer zone in Soviet territory necessary to prevent a Soviet incursion, thus increasing the possibility that Warsaw Pact forces could have decided to make the first aggressive move themselves to forgo that attack, thus increasing the risk of war.

===&quot;Patterns of Conflict&quot;===

In 1976 Colonel John Boyd presented &quot;Patterns of Conflict&quot;, a study outlining a number of historical matchups in which the victor was able to disrupt the &quot;observation-orientation-decision-action time cycle or loop&quot; of their enemy. This, he stated, made them &quot;appear ambiguous (unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder&quot;. His primary example of such action was the Blitzkrieg, where highly mobile forces were quickly concentrated at small points and then used to force a number of simultaneous thrusts through the front. Blitzkrieg aimed at forcing the enemy into a continuous battle of maneuver instead of an outright fight, bypassing any strongly defended areas and extending into their rear. To guarantee supply movement and avoid being encircled, the enemy is forced to retreat in an attempt to reform continuous defensive lines.

The traditional method of dealing with an armored breakthrough was to pick away at its sides, forcing it to maneuver away to find less-defended areas of advance. If these spoiling attacks can be set up on both sides of the route of attack, the armored spearhead is forced into an ever-decreasing frontage, eventually being pinched off and losing the ability to maneuver. The classic example of a successful anti-Blitzkrieg was during the Battle of the Bulge, where US units repeatedly forced the German spearhead inward, eventually pinching it off just short of the Meuse River. However, this approach required the forces to be deployed in depth, and the massive numerical superiority of the Warsaw Pact was the reverse of the numbers during the Bulge. Additionally, the concentration of low-mobility forces that formed the channelizing groups would invite nuclear strikes.

Instead of meeting the Blitzkrieg head-on, Boyd suggested what he called the &quot;counter-blitz&quot;, where small groups of equally mobile forces would pick away at the lines of thrust and then move on to the next in a series of hit-and-run attacks. There was no necessity to retain any sort of front line, and the attacks deliberately moved from point to point to avoid being bogged down or getting trapped. The idea was not to force the blitz to lose its ability to maneuver, but instead upset its ability to understand where it should be maneuvering to—the attacker would have no idea which of these counteroffensives represented a real threat, and would have to respond to all of them. The key idea was to &quot;Smash blitz offensive by inconspicuously using fast-tempo/fluidity-of-action and cohesion of counter-blitz combat teams as basis for shifting of forces and quick focus of air and ground effort to throttle momentum, shatter cohesion, and envelop blitz in order to destroy adversary&#x27;s capacity to resist.&quot; The battle was less about the weapons than it was about the ability to command them; it was believed that the U.S.&#x27; devolved command structure would be able to react to changes on the battlefield more quickly than their Soviet counterparts, overwhelming the Soviets ability to maintain cohesion as their higher-echelon commanders became overwhelmed with reports from so many small actions.

Whereas Active Defense envisioned the Army units moving from one blocking position to another in a series of largely static defenses, in the counter-blitz they would be far more mobile, conducting a series of limited offensives instead. Another difference was the role of the reserves; under Active Defense their role was very limited and even battlefield reserves were expected to be placed directly in the front, but under Patterns the reserves could be introduced where and when they became available, and be just as effective as the troops that had been there from the start. Boyd felt that the continual pattern of harassment and shifting positions could continue throughout a conflict, as opposed to attempting to win the entire war at the front in a single battle.

When Boyd introduced the concept, the Pentagon was being led by power groups that new inductees considered hidebound and moribund. As illustrated in &quot;The Pentagon Wars&quot;, Boyd and like-minded up-and-comers formed the &quot;Reform Movement&quot; and sought to overturn existing chains of command and introduce new weapons and tactics across the entire armed forces.

===Extended battlefield===
The major driving force in the evolution of AirLand Battle was General Donn A. Starry, who had taken over TRADOC from DePuy in 1977 and had been the primary force in implementing Active Defense. Since its introduction Starry had been attempting to find solutions to the problems of the enemy&#x27;s reserves, and had been developing the concept of the &quot;extended battlefield&quot;. This was a far more aggressive strategy, and required of the Army to fly its own CAS attack aircraft like the A-10 and the AH-64, as well as to better integrate USAF high-boy capabilities. It also gave birth to HIMARS, Bradley IFV, M109 Paladin, Patriot missile, M1 Abrams, and the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk. President Carter approved the novel weapons programs.

The extended battlefield noted that different commanders had different views of the battlefield in geographical terms. The brigade commander had to consider actions beyond the immediate front lines, up to 15 km into the enemy&#x27;s rear where his artillery was operating. The division commander considered the battlefield as far as 70 km out, while the corps commander had a field of view out to 150 km. Starry introduced the idea that there was not only a geographical dimension to the battlefield organization, but a time dimension as well; the brigade had perhaps 12 hours to respond to actions, while the division had 24 and the corps 72. It was this coordination both in space and time that defined the extended battlefield.

The reason that the time dimension was important was the result of studies in nuclear weapon employment at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in December 1979. These studies demonstrated that interdiction in the enemy&#x27;s rear could seriously delay the movements of the rear echelon forces and create &quot;time windows&quot; during which the US would have the tactical advantage. By ensuring that the command structure was aware of the time dimension of the battlefield, they would be better prepared to take advantage of these windows when they occurred.

===FM 100-5 draft===

When Active Defense had been introduced in 1976 it faced a wave of criticism, both from within the Army, and from highly influential civilian advisers outside. Having witnessed this first-hand, Starry took measures to ensure this would not happen a second time. Foremost in these efforts was the early dissemination of the concept through briefings and wide circulation of Fort Leavenworth&#x27;s draft of the new FM 100–5 in 1981. These were well received, especially its newly offensive orientation, which it summed up neatly with this statement:

... once political authorities commit military forces in pursuit of political aims, military forces must win something—else there will be no basis from which political authorities can bargain to win politically. Therefore, the purpose of military operations can not be simply to avert defeat—but rather it must be to win.

AirLand Battle became the primary battleplan of US forces in 1982, and NATO forces in 1984, with the help of SACEUR General Bernard W. Rogers. Its roll-out required upgrades to the C3I equipment of all branches of the military, along with similar changes in the command and control structures to take advantage of the massive amounts of information the new C3I assets would be generating.

==AirLand Battle==
Prior to the 1970s the air forces had been seen primarily as for strategic bombing, delivery of tactical nuclear weapons, or for attacks on enemy air forces. Their counterpart to FM 100-5 listed only eight missions, only one of which required direct interaction with the Army forces in the field.

During the Vietnam War much of the US air power had been directed against supply buildup and movement points; roads, bridges, supply depots and the like. Attacking these targets with conventional weapons was an expensive process, requiring considerable amounts of ordnance to be expended to guarantee a &quot;hit&quot;. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the introduction of smart weapons allowed conventional forces to directly attack point targets like bridges and roads, dramatically improving the ability to interdict the enemy, while at the same time allowing the aircraft to operate from safer, higher altitudes. These had little real impact during Vietnam when they were still very new, but their potential was obvious.

Starting in the early 1970s the Air Force took its first steps at looking at a conventional war in Europe. In late 1975, RAND Corporation completed a study that examined the merits of additional crewed aircraft, remotely piloted vehicles, and stand-off munitions for improving air-ground capability in NATO. A follow-up two-day workshop at RAND studied what vulnerabilities the Warsaw Pact might have to NATO airpower, which was followed by a series of additional studies that clearly demonstrated their reliance on the continued movement of supplies. Air planners were beginning to look for ways to best employ these new weapons at the same time Starry was working on the extended battlefield concepts. Simultaneously, the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Bill Perry was interested in &quot;stealth, precision and speed&quot;; and one of their developments was the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, an airplane designed to evade detection by the Soviets and strike ground targets such as tanks, anti-aircraft radar systems and missile complexes. 

Starry emphasized the close coordination between the Army and Air Force to produce an integrated attack plan that would use the land forces in a counter-blitz while air power, artillery and special operation forces stopped the movement of the reserves toward the front line. To achieve this, both the Army and Air Force embarked on equipment modernization programs. The Army&#x27;s effort was collectively called the &quot;Big Five&quot;: the M1 Abrams, the Bradley Fighting/Cavalry Vehicle, the AH-64 Apache, the UH-60 Black Hawk, and the MIM-104 PATRIOT missile system. In addition to the aforementioned F-117, the Air Force&#x27;s requirements for air interdiction against enemy rear-echelon forces would lead to the development of systems such as the Enhanced Tactical Fighter (or Dual-Role Fighter which would result in the F-15E) with LANTIRN for deep strike and Advanced Tactical Fighter (which would result in the F-22) to ensure air superiority for enabling those strikes. The result would stretch out the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s advance in time, allowing the smaller NATO forces to continually attrit the enemy all along the battlefield while the reinforcements arrived piecemeal. The result was a single AirLand Battle.

Although the focus of AirLand Battle was on conventional warfare, it did not ignore the threat of nuclear or chemical warfare. It suggested planning for nuclear strikes or chemical weapons use from the beginning of combat, using them as a threat from the start that would force the enemy to disperse his forces or run the risk of a nuclear strike as they concentrated. The plans did, however, suggest they only be used if first attacked in kind.

The overall message conveyed by the AirLand Battle concept of 1981 was that the Army must leave behind the restricted notion of winning the fight only in the traditional &quot;main battle area.&quot; AirLand Battle was first promulgated in the 1982 version of FM 100-5, and revised for the FM 100-5 version of 1986, which added the Follow-on Forces Attack concept.

The doctrine, unbeknownst at the time, turned out to be a success psychologically on the Warsaw Pact. In 1992, after the USSR had collapsed, at a friendly dinner of old adversaries an East German general said to an American diplomat that &quot;We had no options left&quot; after the doctrine had been understood across the Iron Curtain. Marshal Gorkov knew that the Soviets were in trouble.

DTRA chief Jim Tegnelia opines that AirLand Battle was the child of &quot;the marriage of a policy problem, a good strategy and technology. When they are put together in resonance can create very synergistic and revolutionary effects with regard to military operations.&quot;

From 1993 onward, the Pentagon embraced a new doctrine: network-centric warfare, made possible by the Digital Revolution.

==In popular culture==
&quot;AirLand Battle&quot; stands as part of the title of the sequel to &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;. The game is set in the Cold War when AirLand Battle was a major strategy of NATO, and pits the player playing as either a NATO commander or Warsaw Pact general leading military engagements against the other alliance. The sequel introduces fixed-wing aircraft units to the game that was previously limited to land units and helicopters.

<text>Glasgow Cathedral () is a parish church of the Church of Scotland in Glasgow, Scotland. It is the oldest cathedral in mainland Scotland and the oldest building in Glasgow. The cathedral was the seat of the Archbishop of Glasgow, and the mother church of the Archdiocese of Glasgow and the province of Glasgow, until the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century. Glasgow Cathedral and St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney are the only medieval cathedrals in Scotland to have survived the Reformation virtually intact. The medieval Bishop&#x27;s Castle stood to the west of the cathedral until 1789. Although notionally it lies within the Townhead area of the city, the Cathedral grounds and the neighboring Necropolis are considered to be their own district within the city.

The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Mungo, the patron saint of Glasgow, whose tomb lies at the centre of the building&#x27;s Lower Church. The first stone cathedral was dedicated in 1136, in the presence of David I. Fragments of this building have been found beneath the structure of the present cathedral, which was dedicated in 1197, although much of the present cathedral dates from a major rebuilding in the 13th century. Following its foundation in 1451, the University of Glasgow held its first classes within the cathedral&#x27;s chapter house. After the Reformation, Glasgow Cathedral was internally partitioned to serve three separate congregations (Inner High, Outer High and Barony). The early 19th century saw a growing appreciation of the cathedral&#x27;s medieval architecture, and by 1835 both the Outer High and Barony congregations had moved elsewhere in the city, allowing the restoration of the cathedral to something approaching its former glory.

Glasgow Cathedral has been Crown property since 1587. The entire cathedral building passed into the care of the state in 1857, and today it is the responsibility of Historic Environment Scotland. The congregation is today part of the Church of Scotland&#x27;s Presbytery of Glasgow.

==History==


===Early history===
The history of Glasgow Cathedral is closely linked with that of the city. In the 6th century Saint Mungo is said to have brought the body of a holy man, Fergus, for burial at a site named Cathures (which came to be known as Glasgow). Saint Ninian is reputed to have dedicated the burial ground there on the western bank of the Molendinar Burn in the 5th century (the cathedral&#x27;s Blacader Aisle may mark this site).

Mungo built a monastic cell in the burial ground, and was buried in his church there in 614. His shrine in the Lower Church of Glasgow Cathedral was an important place of pilgrimage in the medieval period. Little is known about the early church buildings, except that they would have been of timber and wattle construction.

The first stone cathedral was built on high ground above the steep western bank of the Molendinar Burn. Initiated by the decision of David I to establish (or re-establish) a bishopric at Glasgow, the new cathedral was consecrated in 1136 in the presence of David and his court during the episcopate of John Capellanus. Constructed over St Mungo&#x27;s burial place – a sacred location which may explain the otherwise unusual hillside site – the cathedral rose slowly, not without interruption and recasting, over a period of some 150 years. Excavations at Glasgow Cathedral between 1988 and 1997 uncovered architectural fragments of this first stone cathedral beneath the floor of the present cathedral. The west front of the 1136 cathedral lay at the third pier of the existing nave and its east end included the area of St Mungo&#x27;s tomb. Following the defeat of Somerled in 1164 at the Battle of Renfrew, Somerled&#x27;s head was brought to the cathedral. In 1175 Pope Alexander III recognised Glasgow as &#x27;a special daughter&#x27; of Rome, freeing the diocese from the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of York. Around the same time Bishop Jocelin was granted a charter by William I to establish Glasgow as a burgh of barony, but with the privileges of a royal burgh. The king attributed the birth of his only son, Alexander, to the intercession of St Mungo.

===Medieval period===

Destroyed or severely damaged by fire, the first cathedral was succeeded by the present cathedral, which was consecrated in 1197. Between 1207 and 1232, Bishop Walter Capellanus embarked upon a building programme which saw the completion of the choir and the Lower Church, and provided the basis for the layout of the transepts and nave as eventually built. From 1233 to 1258, Walter&#x27;s successor, Bishop William de Bondington continued the rebuilding, which included a new, longer, eastern arm to provide a shrine to St Mungo at the main level, and adding three projections (the chapter house, the sacristy/treasury, and what later became the Blacader Aisle). Construction work continued for much of the 13th century, including the central tower and spire, a bell-tower at the north-west corner of the nave (a south-west tower was added in the 14th century). Edward I of England visited the cathedral in August 1301 during the First War of Scottish Independence, making offerings over four days at the high altar and the tomb of Saint Mungo. Following the killing of John Comyn at Greyfriars, Dumfries in February 1306, Robert the Bruce hurried to Glasgow where he met with Robert Wishart, the &quot;warrior&quot; Bishop of Glasgow, in whose diocese the murder had been committed. Wishart granted Bruce absolution and urged the clergy throughout the land to rally to him, before accompanying Robert to Scone where he was crowned as Robert I. Wishart used timber which had given to him by the English to repair the bell tower of Glasgow Cathedral to make siege engines, and laid siege to the English-held Kirkintilloch Castle, before crossing into Fife where he took charge of the assault on Cupar Castle. After his death in 1316, Wishart&#x27;s body was entombed between the chapels of Saints Peter and Paul and Saint Andrew at the east end of the cathedral&#x27;s Lower Church. The tomb is uninscribed and the head of the effigy has been defaced at some point, probably during the Reformation.

In 1406 a lightning strike caused significant damage, including to the wooden steeple. Bishops William de Lauder (1408–25), John Cameron (1426–46) and William Turnbull (1447–54) rebuilt the central tower, spire and chapter house. Bishop Turnbull was primarily responsible for the foundation of the University of Glasgow. Turnbull prompted James II (who was a canon of the cathedral) to write to Pope Nicholas V to request the establishment of a university in Glasgow. The Pope responded with a papal bull issued on 7 January 1451, which erected a new &quot;Studium generale&quot; in Glasgow for the teaching of &quot;theology, canon and civil law, as well as the arts and any other lawful faculty&quot;. The Bishops of Glasgow were to serve as the Chancellors of the new University of Glasgow, which held its first classes within the chapter house of Glasgow Cathedral, before moving to the Pedagogium or &quot;Auld Pedagogy&quot; on the Rottenrow.

By the 15th century the cathedral stood within an extensive walled precinct known as the chanonry, containing the Bishop&#x27;s Castle, the manses of the cathedral prebendaries, the houses of the vicars choral, St Nicholas&#x27; Hospital (founded in 1450), and the burial ground. Much was cleared away in the aftermath of the Scottish Reformation in 1560, and the only upstanding structure surviving today is the late 15th-century Provand&#x27;s Lordship, on the west side of Castle Street. In 1492 Pope Innocent VIII raised the see of Glasgow to the rank of archbishopric. James IV (who was a canon of the cathedral) ratified the treaty of Perpetual Peace with England at the high altar on 10 December 1502. The cathedral and the nearby castle played a part in the battles of Glasgow in 1544 and 1560.

===Reformation===
The Scottish Reformation saw Archbishop James Beaton flee to France, taking the diocesan records with him, and Glasgow Cathedral was &#x27;cleansed&#x27; of its Catholic furnishings such as altars and sculpture, and the roof was apparently stripped of lead. It was decided to retain the building for Protestant worship, and in 1562 David Wemyss, who had been minister of Ratho, became the first Protestant minister of Glasgow Cathedral. The fabric of the cathedral suffered from vandalism and plunder, and by 1574 it was in sufficiently bad condition to attract the attention of the Glasgow town council: &quot;the greit dekaye and ruyne that the hie kirk of Glasgow is cum to, throuch taking awaye of the leid, sciait and wther grayth thairof in this trublus tyme bygane sua that sick arte greit monument will alluterlie fall doun and dekey without it be remidit&quot;. The condition was serious enough to encourage the town council to raise a tax of £200 for repairs to the cathedral in that same year, but the process of repairing the cathedral and modifying it for presbyterian worship dragged on for years. Many of the windows were bricked up, in 1578 the lead of the cathedral roof was repaired, and in 1579 the members of the Glasgow Trades House defended the cathedral from further depredation, enabling it to survive the Reformation relatively unscathed. On 22 April 1581 James VI granted the income from a number of lands to Glasgow town for the cathedral&#x27;s upkeep. In July 1584 the Reverend Wemyss was pulled from the pulpit of the cathedral by members of the town council and other supporters of episcopalianism, to make way for Robert Montgomery, who had been appointed as &quot;tulchan&quot; Archbishop of Glasgow by the Duke of Lennox.

The cathedral eventually came to house three congregations. In 1587 the congregation of the Outer High Church, which served the eastern part of the city, began worshipping in the nave, eventually securing a distinct architectural space in 1647 when a stone wall was erected at the east end of the nave. In 1595 the Barony Church congregation was created. Its parish covered the area surrounding the city and it worshipped in the cathedral&#x27;s Lower Church. In 1635 the choir was transformed through the erection of a partition on the pulpitum into the High Church or, as it came to be called, the Inner High Church.

Following the signing of the National Covenant, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met in the cathedral in November 1638. Dominated by the Covenanters, the Assembly nullified all acts and pronouncements of General Assemblies held between 1606 and 1618 because they had been dominated by the King and bishops, abolished episcopacy in the Church of Scotland and affirmed the Assembly&#x27;s right to meet annually.

===18th-19th centuries===

In 1798, the Barony Church ceased using the Lower Church for worship, and the entire crypt was transformed into a burial place. This involved introducing about one metre of earth over the floor and the erection of railings to mark out the lairs. During the 18th and 19th centuries, several memorial to Glasgow&#x27;s Tobacco Lords, who made their fortune in slave-produced tobacco, were erected in the cathedral. The included Alexander Spiers of Elderslie, Sir James Stirling of Keir and Cecilia Douglas, all of whom owned slaves in the West Indies. Douglas also commissioned a glass-stained window in the cathedral to preserve her own and her family&#x27;s legacy, which has since been removed. In the 1830s there was a growing appreciation of the architectural significance of the building which led to the execution of detailed architectural drawings and the publication of proposals for restoration work. By 1835, both the Outer High Kirk and the Barony Kirk had left the premises, leaving the Inner High Kirk congregation in sole possession of the cathedral. In 1843 the graves and earth were removed from the Lower Church and, as part of restorations to the crypt and the chapter house, the original levels of the floors were restored and the windows were opened up.

The 1840s also saw the demolition of the two towers which flanked the west front. The 144 feet (43 metres) tall north-west tower served as the cathedral&#x27;s bell tower until the central tower was completed in the 15th century, while the 70 feet (21 metres) tall south-west tower, or consistory house, housed the diocesan records and ecclesiastical courts of the archbishops of Glasgow. In the 1840s, it was mistakenly thought that the two towers were not of great antiquity and they were thought to obscure the west door and window. The south-western tower was demolished in 1846 and the north-western tower was demolished in 1848. A lack of funds prevented their &#x27;balanced&#x27; replacements from being built, and the present nave aisles were formed instead, under the direction of Edward Blore. In 1852 the galleries in the Inner High Kirk were removed, and in 1857 the entire cathedral building passed into the care of the state. The 1860s saw the windows of the nave and choir replaced with stained glass by the Royal Bavarian Stained Glass Establishment in Munich. This scheme was one of the largest public art commissions of the Victorian age. In 1879 the organ, built by Henry Willis, was installed in the triforium of the choir, the first in the cathedral since the Reformation. In 1849 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert paid an official visit to the cathedral.

, edited by George Eyre-Todd, is a significant collection of writings from a number of different authors on the history and other aspects of the cathedral which was printed in 1898 by Morison Brothers of 52 Renfield Street in Glasgow.

===20th century to the present===
Between 1909 and 1912 the medieval timber roofs over the choir and nave (which were found to be unsafe) were replaced with new oak roofs, under the direction of William Thomas Oldrieve, Architect for Scotland within the Office of Works. The weight of the roof was reduced by the substitution of copper sheeting for lead and slate, and the distinctive green copper roofing on the exterior of the nave and choir dates from that time.

By 1938 the colours of the &#x27;Munich Glass&#x27; had faded and the leading of the windows had deteriorated and needed to be replaced. The Society of Friends of Glasgow Cathedral decided that it should be replaced by works of the best contemporary artists.

Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother unveiled a window in 1954 in memory of the dead of the four Scottish divisions in World War I and World War II.

In 1971 a memorial service was held in Glasgow Cathedral following the Ibrox Stadium disaster which claimed the lives of 66 football supporters.

The funeral of First Minister Donald Dewar was held in the cathedral in October 2000.

Elizabeth II attended services of thanksgiving at Glasgow Cathedral to mark her Silver Jubilee in 1977 and her Diamond Jubilee in 2012.

<text>The Courageous Exploits of Doctor Syn is the sixth in the series of Doctor Syn novels by Russell Thorndike. Published in 1939, it follows the events of &quot;Amazing Quest of Doctor Syn&quot; and is followed by &quot;Shadow of Doctor Syn&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1781, Doctor Syn continues his adventures as the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh, foiling all attempts to catch him and to break up the Dymchurch smugglers.

==Critical reception==
&quot;A splendid addition to the world-famed Dr. Syn series,&quot; according to &quot;The Observer&quot;. It received positive reviews for its exciting plot and swift narrative pace, as well as some humorous moments like Syn&#x27;s pulpit denunciation of himself. &quot;Full of violent action, with all subsidiary figures in good form,&quot; wrote Maurice Richardson.

==Publication==
Originally published by Rich and Cowan in 1939, it has been reprinted many times in both hardcover and paperback editions, including by Arrow Books (1959), Panther (1964) Jarrolds (1966) and other more recent small presses.

<text>The Cathedral Church of St Mary the Virgin, commonly called St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, is a cathedral of the Scottish Episcopal Church. It is located on the Great Western Road, in the west end of Glasgow, Scotland. The current building was opened on 9 November 1871 as St Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church and was completed in 1893 when the spire was completed. The architect was Sir Gilbert Scott. It was raised to cathedral status in 1908. The total height of the cathedral is 63 metres. The church structure is protected as a category A listed building.

The other cathedrals in Glasgow are St Andrew&#x27;s (Roman Catholic), St Luke&#x27;s (Eastern Orthodox) and St Mungo&#x27;s, the city&#x27;s mediaeval cathedral, now used by the Church of Scotland, which has a presbyterian polity and does not use the term ‘cathedral’ to describe its churches.

== Rector and provost ==
The twin roles of rector of the congregation and provost of the cathedral are carried out by one person. The candidate for the post of rector and provost is nominated as rector by the vestry on behalf of the congregation and elected as provost by the bishop meeting in chapter. Frederic Llewellyn Deane was the first provost in 1908, four years after becoming rector. His successor, Ambrose Lethbridge, became provost in 1918, a year after being installed as rector. Following the sudden death of Bishop Goldie in October 1980, the installation of Malcolm Grant as rector and provost was delayed until after the enthronement of Bishop Rawcliffe in spring 1981. Kelvin Holdsworth was installed as rector and provost on 31 May 2006, the Feast of the Visitation.

== Congregation ==
St Mary&#x27;s combines two roles, as the cathedral for the diocese and as a large urban congregation. Members are drawn from a wide area in and around the city of Glasgow. There is active lay-participation in worship and in administrative and outreach activities. The turnover of the congregation is high.

== Music and the arts ==
St Mary&#x27;s enjoys a strategic position at the heart of Glasgow&#x27;s inner west end, and has sought over a number of years to broaden its outreach by making the cathedral a centre of artistic activity, concerts, art exhibitions and a variety of other events are hosted from time to time.

The musical tradition within worship is particularly strong, in keeping with the identity of the congregation as the cathedral church for the diocese. An adult voluntary mixed choir sings to a professional standard under the Director of Music, Friðrik (Frikki) Walker. In October 2007, the choir was augmented by the addition of a treble section.

The organ is a three manual William Hill instrument which was rebuilt in 1967 and completely restored in 1990. 

The cathedral has a peal of ten bells. The tenor bell weighs .

== Restoration ==
From the mid-1980s to 2002 St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral underwent an extensive restoration.

===Phase 1 – Remedial works at the crossing===
As a result of water ingress to the organ serious damage was discovered to the beams supporting the crossing. Repair work was put in hand, and a survey of the building condition carried out. Following the survey, an extensive fundraising project was commenced in early 1986.

===Phase 2 – Chancel and organ===
The chancel, tower and crossing were restored. The building re-roofed and the clerestory windows renovated. To carry out this work, the opportunity was taken to completely overhaul and rebuild the organ.

The &quot;topping out&quot; ceremony took place at the top of the spire on 19 December 1989. The dedication was carried out by Bishop Derek Rawcliffe with Provost Malcolm Grant, with the cathedral choir singing &quot;Ding Dong Merrily on High&quot;. In June 1990, the cathedral choir undertook a one-day tour of all seven mainland Scottish Anglican cathedrals as part of the fundraising effort to overhaul and rebuild the organ.

===Phase 3 – Synod Hall===
The roof of the Synod Hall was replaced, new lighting, provision of new toilets, the Sacristy Corridor was levelled, a choir room provided, the bishop&#x27;s vestry was replaced by a disabled toilet with level access to the cathedral to the crossing and a wheelchair lift between the disabled toilet and the Synod Hall. The cramped kitchen was dispensed with and replaced with a catering area in the north end of the hall.

===Phase 4 – The nave===
The largest works to date that required the congregation to worship at the nearby Lansdowne Parish Church from October 2000 to March 2002. Work included the provision a new glazed porch, new tiled flooring to replace the temporary flooring from previous phase, completion of the Gywneth Leech decorations and a new lighting scheme.

==Prehistory==
By tradition, the congregation was founded by Alexander Duncan in 1715. However, a list of principal members of the congregation from 1713 shows that its origins extend back to 1689 when the Episcopalian structure of the Church of Scotland was removed by Act of the Scottish Parliament, and the Scottish Episcopal Church as a separate entity emerged. In 1689, Episcopalianism was not widely supported in the West of Scotland, but there were families in Glasgow with Episcopalian and Jacobite sentiments, some with links to the church authorities prior to disestablishment. During the reign of William III they kept a low profile, becoming more assertive after the accession of Queen Anne in 1702.

The earliest contemporary report of the congregation, from Robert Wodrow, describes a service which took place in 1703 to mark the anniversary of the execution of Charles I. The service was held in the lodgings in Saltmarket of Sir John Bell, a former Provost of Glasgow, and resulted in a riot. At this period several clergy were involved, including two local men, John Fullarton (formerly incumbent at Paisley Abbey) and John Hay (formerly at New Monklands); Alexander Burgess (formerly at Temple near Rosslyn) also makes an appearance. The earliest reference to Alexander Duncan dates from 1710 when, with John Fullarton, he attends the deathbed of Lady Dundonald in the Place of Paisley.

Glasgow&#x27;s Episcopal clergy had been operating outside the law (non-juror), but in 1712 a clergyman arrived prepared to take the oath to make him &#x27;qualified&#x27;. William Cockburn set up a meeting-house (he calls it a chapel); the location is not recorded. In 1713 he also marked the death of Charles I. His sermon on that occasion survives, with a list of the congregation, which includes established Glasgow families such as the Bells, Barns, Crawfurds, Grahames, and Walkinshaws, and Alexander Duncan. Sir Donald MacDonald of Sleat played an important part, and his Highland retainers, Gaelic-speaking and in kilts, acted as guards. This chapel was attacked by a rabble a few days after Queen Anne&#x27;s death and Cockburn fled, an event commemorated in an anonymous ballad, &quot;The Downfall of Cockburn&#x27;s Meeting House&quot;, found amongst Wodrow&#x27;s papers.

Members of the congregation played an active part in the Battle of Sheriffmuir in 1715, fighting for the Old Pretender, whilst the rest of Glasgow supported the Hanoverian side. Some of the Jacobites fled; some had their estates confiscated. John Walkinshaw escaped from Stirling Castle by changing clothes with his wife, and made for the Old Pretender in Avignon; later he acted as the Prince&#x27;s envoy in discussions for his marriage to Princess Clementina Sobieska. The congregation survived, depleted and impoverished, and subject to increasingly restrictive laws. In 1728 a meeting house was opened in Broad Close opposite the university, with Duncan (a college bishop since 1724) assisted by a Mr Wingate. This was soon closed by the magistrates and Wingate sent packing. Duncan, now an old man, held services in his own home until his death in 1733.

Evidence is sketchy as to the nature of the Christian observance by the Episcopal congregation in Glasgow in the first half of the eighteenth century, and mostly comes from Wodrow. He mentions a Bible and prayer-book, presumably the Book of Common Prayer, and also a canonical gown. Cockburn uses the term Liturgy. Sermons were preached. There is Holy Communion at Christmas (which Wodrow calls Yule) and Easter with, in 1713, an altar being set up in anticipation (perhaps an indication that Communion was infrequent). (Wodrow&#x27;s own preference was to attend a sermon against holy days). Of the other Sacraments, Baptisms and Marriages by &#x27;unqualified&#x27; Episcopal ministers had been outlawed in 1695, although Baptisms certainly took place. Wodrow noted wrily that the congregation only started to mark the fast for the martyrdom of Charles I after disestablishment. Episcopal ministers attended the sick and the dying, and took funerals. The Litany, used by Episcopalians elsewhere is Scotland at this period, was probably used in Glasgow. The congregation collected money for the poor. Some English practices (e.g. their way of distributing Communion) were replacing the Scottish traditions, and this caused complaints.

Seven years passed before the arrival of the next incumbent, George Graham from Perthshire, who had a meeting house in Candleriggs. The Jacobite rising of 1745 had brought Bonnie Prince Charlie to Glasgow. Clementina Walkinshaw, daughter of John Walkinshaw, would later become his mistress, and mother of his only child. The penal laws restricting Scottish Episcopalians now became draconian. Graham left the following year. His replacement, in 1750, was David Lyon, with a meeting-house in Stockwell Street. From 1751, Episcopalians prepared to acknowledge the Hanoverian king could attend the qualified chapel, St Andrew&#x27;s-by-the-Green. David Lyon, by now the only Scottish Episcopal priest ministering to a flock scattered across the West of Scotland, took part in the secret meeting held in Moffat in 1769 to discuss a Protestant bride for Bonnie Prince Charlie.

David Lyon was followed by Andrew Wood, then Andrew Macdonald. Macdonald wrote novels, poetry, and plays, and is the only member of this lineage to appear in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. He eventually left Glasgow for London where he died young. A book of &quot;Twenty-eight Miscellaneous Sermons&quot; by Andrew Macdonald was published posthumously in 1790. The next incumbent from 1788 was Alexander Jamieson from Marykirk, Kincardineshire. The penal laws were repealed in 1792. The congregation grew, for many years meeting in a class room in the Grammar School. In 1825 they moved to St Mary&#x27;s Chapel in Renfield Street, moving to the present building in 1871. The incumbents of the Renfield Street chapel were George Almond (1825–1848), Bishop Walter Trower (1848–1853) and Richard Oldham. (A summary of – Roger Edwards: &quot;Glasgow&#x27;s Episcopalians – Rebel Romantics&quot; (2008)).

See Old Saint Paul&#x27;s, Edinburgh for the rather different experience of Edinburgh&#x27;s Episcopalians.

<text>Marc Birkigt (8 March 1878, Geneva – 15 March 1953, Versoix) was a Swiss engineer, automotive and aviation pioneer, and co-founder of Hispano-Suiza in 1904.

He lived in Barcelona, Spain when he was hired by Emilio de la Cuadra in 1898 to work as an automobile engineer in Cuadra&#x27;s firm La Cuadra. After several bankruptcies and changes in ownership, the firm was reborn in 1904 as the luxury automobile company Hispano-Suiza with Birkigt as chief engineer. Later he co-founded the Dewoitine company along with Émile Dewoitine. Birkigt was nominated for the Car Engineer of the Century prize for the luxurious Hispano-Suiza H6 car in the 1920s. He also won fame for the aircraft engines and guns he designed as chief engineer at Hispano-Suiza, the former including the liquid-cooled V8 engine that powered the famous French SPAD VII and SPAD XIII World War I fighters, and the British Sopwith Dolphin and S.E. 5a, whilst in the field of ordnance he created the Hispano-Suiza HS.404 20mm autocannon, which was of great importance in WW II as the main fighter gun of the RAF from 1941 onwards.

==Biography==
=== Childhood ===
Marc was born on March 8, 1878, in Geneva, Switzerland. Son of a tailor in rue Rousseau, his mother died when he was 2 and his father when he was 12. He was raised by his grandmother.

=== Education and early working years ===
Marc entered the Geneva Mechanical School at the age of 17 from where he graduated as an engineer at the age of 20 and then worked in a company manufacturing machines and tools for watchmaking. During his military service in Switzerland, he served as gunsmith.

Aged 21, he joined Carlos Vellino (engineering school friend) in 1899 in Barcelona (industrial capital of Catalonia) and worked unsuccessfully on a prototype electric omnibus for Barcelona for the company “La Cuadra”. He then designed and manufactured two models of gasoline powered carts: a 4.5 hp single-cylinder and the 7.5-horsepower twin-cylinder La Cuadra Centauro, which in 1901 traveled 1,000 km without incident. He filed his first mechanical patents but the company went bankrupt.

=== Hispano-Suiza ===

==== Early years in Spain and international development ====
Marc Birkigt founded with the financier José Castro de La Cuadra in November 1902 the José Castro s.en.c Fábrica Hispano-Suiza de Automóviles in Barcelona. They manufactured automobiles with internal combustion engines, the 10 hp, 1,873 cc twin-cylinder and the 14 hp, 2,535 cc 4-cylinder chassis. At the beginning of 1904, production was again suspended for lack of money. The Spanish businessmen Damian Mateù and Francisco Seix then finance on June 14, 1904, the new company Hispano-Suiza Fabrica de Automóviles SA in Barcelona.

King Alfonso XIII of Spain ordered a 20/24 hp Hispano-Suiza chassis and assured the company of his full support. He awarded Birkigt the title of Knight of Isabella the Catholic in 1908.

A new factory was built in Sagrera and sales offices were created in Geneva and Paris, then in the rest of Europe.

A sales license was granted to the Swiss company SAG (Société d&#x27;automobiles à Genève) of Lucien Pictet and Paul Piccard. The latter marketed the Hispano-Suiza models under this name until 1908.

Marc Birkigt presented two new chassis at the 1907 show: a 4-cylinder 40/45 hp and an imposing 6-cylinder 60/75 hp with 11 litres of displacement decorated with the brand&#x27;s emblem: two wings (symbol of speed), in the center a white cross (Swiss symbol) on the Spanish colors.

In January 1911, Marc Birkigt moved to Paris with a new factory in Levallois and then in Bois-Colombes in 1914 with agencies all over the world. King Alfonso XIII was then one of the main shareholders of the brand.

==== Success of aircraft engines in France ====
In 1914 when the First World War broke out, the factories were placed under the control of the company Gnome et Rhône. Marc Birkigt then developed a light aircraft engine in Barcelona for the Spanish government. The 150 hp Hispano-Suiza 8 a 90° V8 engine introduced the innovative concept of light alloy cylinder blocks. From 1915 the French air force successfully equipped itself with 40,000 of these engines, which enabled them to fight on equal terms with their German counterparts. This machine powered the SPAD S.VII plane of the Stork Squadron ace Georges Guynemer; and so the stork is now associated with Hispano-Suiza.

At the end of the war Marc Birkigt returned to Paris. He devoted himself to luxury automobiles such as the Hispano-Suiza H6, to take advantage of the new fortunes made during the war.

==== In between two wars until the 1950s ====

In 1923, the French subsidiary acquired its independence and was baptized Hispano-Suiza. Birkigt joined forces with Michelin in the 1930s to create a railcar: the famous Micheline.

After having built more than 2,500 chassis, Hispano Suiza was nationalized by the French state in 1936. Marc Birkigt stopped manufacturing automobiles and devoted himself to aircraft engines and automatic weapons for French national defense. The result is the Hispano-Suiza 12X engine derived from the V8; one of the first engines of the 1000 hp (750 kW) class in the Hispano-Suiza 12Y version, produced under license and developed in Czechoslovakia, Spain, Switzerland and the USSR. The Hispano-Suiza HS-404 aircraft gun was also designed and widely adopted by the British and American armed forces during World War II.

At the end of World War II, the factories of Bois-Colombes and Tarbes were in ruins and looted. It then relaunched in the manufacture of aircraft reactors (Rolls-Royce), aviation accessories (thrust reversers, gas turbines, landing gear, diesel engines ...)

=== Private life ===

Marc Birkigt married Eugénie Brachet in Geneva on November 23, 1901. From their union were born Louis in 1903 and Yvonne in 1905.

He lived in Versoix Geneva, Switzerland, since 1930 in his sumptuous “Rive-bleu” residence on the shores of Lake Geneva facing the Mont-Blanc massif.

He died on March 15, 1953, at the age of 75, after having filed more than 150 patents.

He is buried together with his wife Eugénie in Versoix Geneva, Switzerland.

<text>Irina Mutsuovna Khakamada (; born 13 April 1955) is a Russian economist, political activist, journalist, teacher, publicist, and politician who ran in the 2004 Russian presidential election.

Khakamada was a former member (deputy) of the lower house (the State Duma) of the Russian parliament for three convocations (electoral terms, 1993–2003) and vice-chair of the house; co-chair of a political party Union of Right Forces (1999–2003), presidential candidate of the Russian Federation (2004), member of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights (2012–2018).

In 1995, &quot;Time&quot; named Khakamada a 21st-century politician among 100 well-known women in the world.

In 2002, Khakamada served as a rapporteur from Russia at the 57th session of the UN General Assembly. 2005 she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

==Biography==
Khakamada was born to a Japanese father, Mutsuo Hakamada, a Japanese communist who defected to the Soviet Union in 1939. Her mother, Nina Sinelnikova, with Russian, Lezgian and Armenian roots, was an English schoolteacher who lost her father to the Stalinist purges and her mother to suicide following the family&#x27;s forced relocation to Khabarovsk.

Khakamada&#x27;s paternal uncle is , a member of the Japanese Communist Party leadership. The Russia expert and political science professor Shigeki Hakamada is her half-brother.

In kanji, Khakamada&#x27;s family name is ; in katakana, her name is イリーナ・ハカマダ.

Khakamada graduated from the Department of Economy of the Patrice Lumumba Peoples&#x27; Friendship University in Moscow in 1978. She obtained her PhD degree from the Faculty of Economics of Lomonosov Moscow State University. In 1983, she received the academic title of associate professor in the specialty &quot;political economy&quot;. She was a member of the CPSU from 1984 to 1989.

===Duma career===
Khakamada was an elected Duma representative from 1993 to 2003. She is regarded as a democratic politician who is in a moderate opposition to the Russian government. She is known for criticizing the governmental actions during Moscow theater hostage crisis where she was involved as one of the negotiators. Khakamada stated that the hostage takers were not going to use their bombs to kill the people and destroy the building.

Khakamada was a member of the coordinating council of the Union of Right Forces. She opted to abstain from the council&#x27;s vote on their endorsement in the 2000 presidential election, in which the party ultimately voted to support Vladimir Putin&#x27;s campaign over that of council member Konstantin Titov.

===2004 presidential campaign===

Khakamada was one of the leaders of the Union of Rightist Forces when she decided to run in the 2004 Russian presidential election. She was not supported by her party, which had decided that they would not nominate a candidate. She announced her candidacy in December 2003.

Khakamada kicked off her campaign by delivering a speech which placed the blame for the Moscow theater hostage crisis at Putin&#x27;s feet. She entered the election with better name recognition than most of the other candidates challenging Putin. Her candidacy was officially registered on 8 February. Khakamada was only the second woman to be a registered candidate in a Russian presidential election, after only Ella Pamfilova in 2000.

Khakamada claimed her motivation for running was her desire to see a liberal opposition candidate. She would ultimately be the only liberal opposition candidate to run.

In an article published in &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot;, Yulia Latynina alleged that Khakamada only entered the election to feign a role of a democratic opponent to provide more legitimacy to the election of Vladimir Putin. Khakamada denied such allegations.

Khakamada&#x27;s campaign slogan was “Irina Khakamada: Our Voice”. Her campaign received funding from Boris Nevzlin, a former Yukos chief who was being targeted for international investigation by Russian authorities and was residing in Israel during the campaign. She was outspoken about unfair conditions of the election, particularly about its media coverage. Early into the campaign, analysts predicted that she might be able to receive more than 10% of the vote. Khakamada received 3.9% of votes. While she declared that she found her performance in the election to have been, &quot;satisfactory&quot;, she alleged that there had been many irregularities with the vote.

===Subsequent political activities (2004– present)===

After the election Khakamada founded a new political party named Our Choice. Since 2004, the chairman of the Party reorganized into the &quot;Our Choice Interregional Public Fund for Social Solidarity&quot;, which in 2006 became part of the Russian People&#x27;s Democratic Union (RNDS) political party, led by Mikhail Kasyanov and her.

Khakamada published the book &quot;Gender in big-time politics&quot; describing her personal experience of work in Kremlin.

On 11 June 2006 Boris Berezovsky, a fugitive from the Russian justice system, said Boris Nemtsov received word from Khakamada that Putin threatened her and like-minded colleagues in person. According to Berezovsky, Putin had issued threats that Khakamada and her colleagues &quot;will take in the head immediately, literally, not figuratively&quot; if they &quot;open the mouth&quot; about the Russian apartment bombings.

Former FSS officer Alexander Litvinenko said he had learned from Anna Politkovskaya that Putin asked Khakamada to pass a threat to Politkovskaya. Khakamada denied her involvement in passing any specific threats, and said that she warned Politkovskaya only in general terms more than a year earlier, and that Politkovskaya blamed her and Mikhail Kasyanov for becoming Kremlin&#x27;s puppets. Politkovskaya and Litvinenko were murdered in October and November 2006.

2008, Khakamada left the party of her own accord, explaining the cessation of her political activities.

2016, she became a member of the Council of the Political Growth Party. She took part in the elections to the State Duma of the 7th convocation as a candidate from the “Party of Growth”, in the first part of the regional list of Moscow. The party won 1.28% of the vote and was unable to sit in parliament.

<text>Roscoe Conklin Born (November 24, 1950 – March 3, 2020) was an American actor and songwriter. He is best known for his roles on various television soap operas, most notably as archvillain Mitch Laurence on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in six stints between 1985 and 2012.

==Early life and education==
Born was born in Topeka, Kansas. Roscoe went to Albert Einstein High School in Kensington, Maryland then attended both Tulane University and Boston University.

==Career==
Born appeared most often in daytime television, first appearing on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; as troubled mob heir Joe Novak from 1981 to 1983 and again in 1988. He next portrayed villain Mitch Laurence on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1985 to 1987 then again from 2002 to 2003, reprising the role once again starting in November 2009. Born appeared on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; in his best known roles Robert Barr (1989–1991) and his twin Quinn Armitage (1990–1991), a role that earned him an Emmy Award-nomination. He was also a regular on the primetime soap &quot;Paper Dolls&quot; as Mark Bailey in 1984. From April 2005 to January 2006 and again in March 2009, Born was on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in the critically acclaimed role of the evil Tom Fisher. Many of his daytime roles showcased him in evil roles, with the exception of Nick Rivers on the 1995-1997 ABC series &quot;The City&quot;. Nick was a grizzled musician, allowing Born the opportunity to perform his own material. He can be seen performing some of his more recent songs on YouTube.com: &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Pepsi Blues&quot;; &quot;Blue State Mind, Red State Soul&quot;; &quot;Soldier On&quot;, a salute to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; and &quot;If It Don&#x27;t Stink, Don&#x27;t Stir the Pot&quot;, a response to the Boy Scouts of America sex abuse scandal. In February 2017, Born released two singles on iTunes via Chowderhead Records, &quot;Let the Road Lead&quot; and &quot;Crazy is as Crazy Does&quot;.

In the 1980s, he also guest starred in such prime time shows as &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;Midnight Caller&quot; and starred in the TV movies &quot;The Haunting of Sarah Hardy&quot; and &quot;Lady Mobster&quot;. In 1989, he had a featured role in the film &quot;Pow Wow Highway&quot;. 1970s TV appearances include &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, two episodes of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; and the TV movie &quot;Fast Friends&quot;.

Around this time, Born played the dastardly Jim Thomasen on &quot;All My Children&quot;. In late 1997, he abruptly left the role and did not appear on daytime for the next several years (save bit parts on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot;). Born was working outside of the industry when &quot;One Life to Live&quot; rehired him from 2002 to 2003 to reprise the role of Mitch. Born portrayed an evil prison warden on &quot;Passions&quot; in 2007, and played the contract role of Dean Trent Robbins on the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from May 29, 2008, to September 26, 2008.

Born studied acting at the Arena Stage workshop and made his professional acting debut for them on November 13, 1969, in the play &quot;Edith Stein&quot;. In 1979, he won a Drama-Logue Award for the play &quot;Life in the Theater&quot;.

In 1990, Born earned nominations for a Daytime Emmy and &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; award.

==Personal life and death==
From 1982 to 1990, Born was married to &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; actress Randall Edwards. He was married to fellow &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; co-star Roberta Weiss from 1994 to 2000, and they had a daughter, Alberta.

Born died on March 3, 2020, at the age of 69. He died by suicide; his family issued a statement that attributed his death to his &quot;long struggle[d] with bipolar disorder&quot;.

<text>Amazing Quest of Doctor Syn is the fifth in the series of Doctor Syn novels by Russell Thorndike. Published in 1938, it follows the events of &quot;Further Adventures of Doctor Syn&quot; and is followed by &quot;Courageous Exploits of Doctor Syn&quot;. It was dedicated to actor George Arliss, who had starred in a feature film adaptation of the first novel a year prior. 

==Plot==
In 1780, Doctor Syn travels to Wales to compete with another smuggler.

==Critical reception==
Critics noted that its plot covered a wider range of territory, including North Wales. Audiences were more familiar with the character than ever, thanks to the recent film, and the novel fulfilled the heightened expectations.

==Publication==
Originally published by Rich and Cowan in 1938, it has been reprinted many times in both hardcover and paperback editions, including by Arrow Books (1959), Panther (1964) Jarrolds (1966) and other more recent small presses.

<text>The Metropolitan Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew or Glasgow Metropolitan Cathedral is a Latin Catholic cathedral in the city centre of Glasgow, Scotland. It is the mother church of the Archdiocese of Glasgow. The cathedral, which was designed in 1814 by James Gillespie Graham in the Neo-Gothic style, lies on the north bank of the River Clyde in Clyde Street. St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Glasgow, currently William Nolan. It is dedicated to the patron saint of Scotland, Saint Andrew.

==History==

From the Scottish Reformation of 1560 until the beginning of the Catholic Emancipation process in 1791, with the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 (31 Geo. 3. c. 32) – which restored certain civil rights and freedom of worship – Catholics in Glasgow had to worship covertly. By the end of the 18th century, particularly with the influx of Irish Catholic immigrants to Glasgow during the nascent stages of the Industrial Revolution, there emerged an increasing demand for a Catholic church in the city. In 1805 there were approximately 450 Catholics in the city, but by 1814 the number of recorded communicants in the city had increased to 3,000, and in that year the decision was taken by the Rev. Andrew Scott to build a new church in Clyde Street.

The lands upon which the church was built had been purchased from the owners of the firm of Bogle and Scott which had previously traded from that site as part of Glasgow&#x27;s tobacco and sugar trade with America and the West Indies. The families of Bogle and Scott, mostly Presbyterian and Episcopalian, were prominent names in Glasgow who owned numerous estates around the city and often held leading municipal offices, such as George Bogle of Daldowie, Lord Rector of the university.

Completed in 1816, and designed by James Gillespie Graham (1776–1855), the church of St. Andrew formally re-introduced the Catholic presence to Glasgow.

The continuing hostility against the Catholic Church in Scotland was evident during the construction of the church: work completed during the day was torn down by saboteurs at night, delaying completion and eventually guards had to be placed on the building site to protect the construction works. However, congregations of other Christian denominations in the city donated money for the completion of the project in a gesture of ecumenism in light of the difficulties faced in construction. The church building is relatively modest in scale, without a steeple or bell tower. This was due primarily to continuing restrictions on the prominence of Catholic places of worship under the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 (31 Geo. 3. c. 32), that were not ultimately repealed until the later Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829.

In the wake of the Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy, undertaken by Pope Leo XIII in 1878, the church of St Andrew was eventually raised to the status of pro-cathedral in 1884, and was also extensively renovated at that time by the architects Pugin and Pugin.

In 1947, with the establishment of the new Dioceses of Motherwell and Paisley, the Archdiocese of Glasgow recovered the status of metropolitan diocese which it had had before the Reformation and St Andrew&#x27;s became a metropolitan cathedral.

==Organ==
The cathedral&#x27;s pipe organ was originally built in 1903 by Henry Willis &amp; Sons for the former Elgin Place Congregational Church at the corner of Pitt Street and Bath Street, and was reinstalled at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral in 1981, when the church closed for worship.

As part of the cathedral renovation in 2009/2010 the organ was dismantled and placed in storage by David Wells (Organ Builders Ltd) Liverpool. There is currently an Allen Protégé AP-6 electronic organ in use. There is an organ restoration fund to reinstall the Willis.

==St Andrew&#x27;s Parish==
St Andrew&#x27;s Parish traces its origins to the reappointment of a parish priest for Glasgow in 1792. That year, two hundred people came to the opening Mass in a rented hall in Mitchell Street. Five years later, new premises in the Calton area of the East End provided for 600 people each Sunday until the celebration of the first Mass in the new Church of St Andrew at Clyde Street on 22 December 1816.

Since then, the opening of new parishes and the redevelopment of the city centre have depleted the population of the cathedral parish, but the remaining small community of parishioners is augmented by numbers from elsewhere, some of whom travel considerable distances to assist with the celebration of the liturgy and the care of the fabric. Shoppers, workers, students, tourists and passers-by also regularly visit the cathedral – for quiet prayer, for Mass, or for the Sacrament of Reconciliation. There are also major liturgies celebrated frequently by the archbishop, which attract worshippers from parishes throughout the archdiocese.

==Renovation==
A major restoration project began on 14 August 2009 as the cathedral had long been in need of major refurbishment and expansion. The programme of renovation included the completion of new heating and lighting systems as well as redecoration and gold leaf restoration, installation of newly commissioned bronze doors, the repair and reinstatement of the pipe organ and the installation of a new canvas by Peter Howson depicting the martyrdom of St John Ogilvie. The work was completed in April 2011, and saw the return of the cathedra to St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral from the temporary pro-cathedral of the Archdiocese of Glasgow at Saint Mary&#x27;s, Calton. The cathedral re-opened officially on 11 April 2011.

<text>Fortezza is an information security system that uses the Fortezza Crypto Card, a PC Card-based security token. It was developed for the U.S. government&#x27;s Clipper chip project and has been used by the U.S. Government in various applications.

Each individual who is authorized to see protected information is issued a &quot;Fortezza card&quot; that stores private keys and other data needed to gain access. It contains an NSA approved security microprocessor called &quot;Capstone&quot; (MYK-80) that implements the Skipjack encryption algorithm.

The original Fortezza card (KOV-8) is a Type 2 product which means it cannot be used for classified information. The most widely used Type 1 encryption card is the KOV-12 Fortezza card which is used extensively for the Defense Message System (DMS). The KOV-12 is cleared up to TOP SECRET/SCI. A later version, called KOV-14 or Fortezza Plus, uses a Krypton microprocessor that implements stronger, Type 1 encryption and may be used for information classified up to TOP SECRET/SCI. It, in turn, is being replaced by the newer KSV-21 PC card with more modern algorithms and additional capabilities.
The cards are interchangeable within the many types of equipment that support Fortezza and can be rekeyed and reprogrammed by the owners, making them easy to issue and reuse. This simplifies the process of rekeying equipment for crypto changes: instead of requiring an expensive fill device, a technician is able to put a new Fortezza card in the device&#x27;s PCMCIA slot.

The Fortezza Plus card and its successors are used with NSA&#x27;s Secure Terminal Equipment voice and data encryption systems that are replacing the STU-III. It is manufactured by the Mykotronx Corporation and by Spyrus. Each card costs about $240 and they are commonly used with card readers sold by Litronic Corporation.

The Fortezza card has been used in government, military, and banking applications to protect sensitive data.

<text>The Laymen&#x27;s Home Missionary Movement, founded by Paul S. L. Johnson in 1920, is a non-sectarian, interdenominational religious organisation that arose as an independent offshoot of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society after the death of its founder, Charles Taze Russell. It is active in many countries, including the United States, Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Germany, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom, India, Africa (Nigeria, Kenya) and the Caribbean (Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad).

==Early history==

In early 1917, a disagreement arose between the members of the Editorial Committee of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society (the Bible Student movement founded by Charles Taze Russell) over Russell&#x27;s arrangements for the Editorial Committee outlined in his Last Will and Testament and the Society&#x27;s official charter.

This caused the Society to splinter into many factions with over 75% of the original Bible students leaving the WTBTS by 1928 with many forming other independent groups and fellowships which included the Elijah Voice Society, The Pastoral Bible Institute (PBI) and others. The Laymen&#x27;s Home Missionary Movement (LHMM) was formed by three former members of the Pastoral Bible Institute Committee which was formed by a large group of dissenting brethren in 1917 at the Fort Pitt Convention (Paul S L Johnson, Raymond G Jolly and Robert Hirsch). The name had been used by Pastor Russell to describe the association he led as well as the more frequent designation: International Bible Students Association. Following its 1918 founding, the Laymen&#x27;s Home Missionary Movement is active in 13 countries. The Laymen’s Home Missionary Movement today represents a small community of about 15,000 members worldwide.

==Schisms==
After the death of Pastor Johnson in 1950, Raymond G. Jolly led the movement, but soon there were disagreements with other members:
* John Krewson of Fort Myers, Florida was disfellowshipped in 1955 and formed the &quot;Laodicean Home Missionary Movement&quot; in Philadelphia.
* John Hoefle of Mount Dora, Florida left the Watchtower Society to join Johnson in 1928, and was disfellowshipped in 1956. He formed his own group, the &quot;Epiphany Bible Students Association&quot;, and published a newsletter under the same name. He died in 1980 and his wife Emily continued the work until her death in January 2010. The work continues under a board of directors.

==Leadership==

Paul S. L. Johnson (1920–1950) graduated from Capital University of Columbus Ohio with high honors, and also from the Theological Seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio. Pastor Johnson was a Greek and Hebrew scholar, which gave him the skills necessary to understand the Bible from the original languages. He came to believe that a God of perfect wisdom, justice, power and love, would not punish his enemies forever. He adopted the view that Bible teaches that the punishment for sin is death, not eternal torment.

Raymond G. Jolly (1950–1979) graduated from Bloomsburg State College with high honors. He studied theology and the classics at Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania. He served in the Presbyterian Church, but later left to promote the Gospel from a non-sectarian standpoint, serving as a pilgrim under both Pastors Russell and Johnson. He assumed the office of Executive after the demise of the latter until his own death, Feb. 14, 1979.

August Gohlke (1979–1985), a special helper under Raymond Jolly was appointed as Executive Trustee in 1979, and served until his death in 1985, greatly expanding the public work, including a radio broadcast ministry that covered large parts of the United States.

Bernard W. Hedman (1986–2004) was Editor of &quot;The Bible Standard&quot; magazine from 1985 until his death in 2004; he also served as Executive Trustee and Director of the Laymen’s Home Missionary Movement, further expanding the work and republishing some of their existing publications.

Ralph M. Herzig (2004–2014) was elected as Executive Trustee and Director of the Laymen’s Home Missionary Movement in 2004, and assumed the office of General Editor of &quot;The Bible Standard&quot; and &quot;Present Truth&quot; magazines as well as overseeing the pilgrim service, which functions as a speakers bureau.

Leon J. Snyder (2014–Present) was elected as Executive Trustee and Director of the Laymen’s Home Missionary Movement in 2014, and assumed the office of General Editor of &quot;The Bible Standard&quot; and &quot;Present Truth&quot; magazines as well as overseeing the pilgrim service, which functions as a speakers bureau.

==Publications==

Currently, the LHMM publishes the six-volume series &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot;, written by Charles Taze Russell in the 1880s (&quot;see External links section&quot;).

It also publishes and makes available to the public the 17-volume set written by Professor Paul S.L. Johnson, &quot;Epiphany Studies in the Scriptures&quot;, as well as two magazines, the bi-monthly &quot;The Bible Standard&quot; and the quarterly &quot;The Present Truth&quot;, which are produced in about ten different languages. Their website &quot;www.biblestandard.com&quot; offers a look into their understanding of the Bible with various magazine articles, links to foreign LHMM sites, and an interactive button where Bible questions can be asked and answered. The Movement in 2005 has adopted the name Bible Standard Ministries as its working name for its public ministry, yet still functions as the L.H.M.M.

<text>A medical savings account (MSA) is an account into which tax-deferred amounts from income can be deposited. The amounts are often called contributions and may be made by a worker, an employer, or both, depending on a country&#x27;s laws.

The money in such accounts is to be used to pay for medical expenses. Withdrawals from the account often called distributions, if made for that reason, may or may not be subject to income tax. Withdrawals without adequate documentation of use for medical expenses are subject to penalties.

==In China==
In December 1994, the People&#x27;s Republic of China began a pilot study of medical savings accounts in the cities of Zhenjiang and Jiujiang. China has planned to expand the program.

==In Singapore==

Medisave was introduced in April 1984 as a national medical savings system in Singapore. It allows Singaporeans to put aside part of their income into a Medisave account to meet future personal or immediate family&#x27;s hospitalization, day surgery and for certain outpatient expenses.

Under this system, Singaporean employees contribute 6–8% (depending on age group) of their monthly salaries to a personal Medisave account. The savings can be withdrawn to pay the hospital bills of the account holder and immediate family members.

Medical savings was first introduced to the world as an alternative method of national health care financing in Singapore’s Medisave scheme as early as the 1980s. (References: WHO 1986 “Singapore’s Family Savings Scheme”; “Saving for health”, World Health Forum, vol. 8, 1987). This was predicated upon the concerns over the rising population ageing rates and current methods of public payment for health either through taxes or insurance since such pay-as-you-go financing systems result in higher annual taxes or premiums. Such systems are unsustainable against rapid population ageing and a future shrinking bases of the young.

Recently, these medical savings are used to pay for health care financing due to the exigencies of emergency spending due to the pandemic, and thus to avoid deficit funding by the government (Reference: COVID-19 poses challenges in healthcare financing, Straits Times, May 27, 2020).

==United States==

The United States has two medical savings account programs:
* Medical savings account (started 1993, still prevalent in California)
* Health savings account (created 2003, supersedes MSAs, more widely available)

*Health care system

<text>Shadow of Doctor Syn is the seventh and last in the series of Doctor Syn novels by Russell Thorndike. Published in 1944, it follows the events of &quot;Amazing Quest of Doctor Syn&quot;. Though it is the last book written in the series it acts as a prequel for the first novel. Thorndike dedicated it to Emma Treckman, with whom he co-wrote the stage play &quot;The Return of Doctor Syn&quot;.

==Plot==
Set in 1793 during the events of the French Revolution, Syn travels to France amidst the Reign of Terror. He has fallen in love with young Cicily Cobtree and hopes his actions against Robespierre will earn him a pardon from the King. When Cicily dies, Syn gives up his ideas of pardon and nearly loses his sanity. This sets the stage for the fiendish character he becomes in &quot;Doctor Syn: A Tale of the Romney Marsh&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Critics praised the exciting story but the sudden romantic subplot was less favorably received.

==Publication==
Originally published by Rich &amp; Cowan in 1944, it has been reprinted many times, including by Arrow Books (1959), Jarrolds (1966) and other recent small presses.

==Adaptations==
In 1989, the novel was adapted into a stage play by Philip Dart. Produced by the Channel Theatre Company, the traveling production performed in numerous locations in England.

In 2007, an abridged version of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Comprising half of a ten-part series titled &quot;The Further Adventures of Doctor Syn&quot;, it was read by Rufus Sewell.

<text>Frederik Kaiser (Amsterdam, 10 June 1808 – Leiden, 28 July 1872) was a Dutch astronomer.
He was director of the Leiden Observatory from 1838 until his death.

He is credited with the advancement of Dutch astronomy through his scientific contributions of positional measurements, his popularization of astronomy in the Netherlands, and by helping to build a state-of-the-art observatory in 1861. Today it is known as the &quot;Old Observatory&quot;).
Among his students were Jean Abraham Chrétien Oudemans, Johannes van der Waals, Hendricus Gerardus van de Sande Bakhuyzen and Hendrik Antoon Lorentz. 

Kaiser made a series of drawings of Mars at its opposition in 1862 and made a fairly precise determination of its rotational period by comparing his drawings with those of Christiaan Huygens.

Craters on Mars and on the Moon are named in his honour, as well as asteroid 1694 Kaiser.

In Richard Proctor&#x27;s now-abandoned Martian nomenclature, Syrtis Major Planum was called the &quot;Kaiser Sea&quot;. This nomenclature was later dropped in favor of the one introduced by Giovanni Schiaparelli.

Kaiser&#x27;s parents were Johann Wilhelm Keyser and Anna Sibella Liernur but he was raised by his uncle Johan Frederik Keyser from the age of eight.

<text>Polyneuropathy () is damage or disease affecting peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathy) in roughly the same areas on both sides of the body, featuring weakness, numbness, and burning pain. It usually begins in the hands and feet and may progress to the arms and legs and sometimes to other parts of the body where it may affect the autonomic nervous system. It may be acute or chronic. A number of different disorders may cause polyneuropathy, including diabetes and some types of Guillain–Barré syndrome.

==Classification==
Polyneuropathies may be classified in different ways, such as by &quot;cause&quot;, by &quot;presentation&quot;, or by &quot;classes&quot; of polyneuropathy, in terms of which part of the nerve cell is affected mainly: the axon, the myelin sheath, or the cell body.

* Distal axonopathy, is the result of interrupted function of the peripheral nerves. It is the most common response of neurons to metabolic or toxic disturbances, and may be caused by metabolic diseases such as diabetes, kidney failure, connective tissue disease, deficiency syndromes such as malnutrition and alcoholism, or the effects of toxins or drugs such as chemotherapy. They may be divided according to the type of axon affected (large-fiber, small-fiber, or both). The most distal portions of axons are usually the first to degenerate, and axonal atrophy advances slowly toward the nerve&#x27;s cell body. However, if the cause is removed, then regeneration is possible, although the prognosis depends on the duration and severity of the original stimulus. People with distal axonopathies usually present with sensorimotor disturbances such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
* Myelinopathy, is due to a loss of myelin or of the Schwann cells. This demyelination slows down or completely blocks the conduction of action potentials through the axon of the nerve cell (neurapraxia). The most common cause is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy AIDP, the most common form of Guillain–Barré syndrome (although other causes include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy )
* Neuronopathy is the result of issues in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons. They may be caused by motor neurone diseases, sensory neuronopathies, toxins, or autonomic dysfunction. Neurotoxins such as chemotherapy agents may cause neuronopathies.

==Signs and symptoms==
Among the signs and symptoms of polyneuropathy, which can be divided (into sensory and hereditary) and are consistent with the following, are:
* &quot;Sensory polyneuropathy&quot; – ataxia, numbness, muscle wasting and paraesthesiae.
* &quot;Hereditary polyneuropathy&quot; – scoliosis and hammer toes

==Causes==
The causes of polyneuropathy can be divided into hereditary and acquired and are therefore as follows:
* &quot;Inherited&quot; – hereditary motor neuropathies, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy
* &quot;Acquired&quot; – diabetes mellitus, vascular neuropathy, alcohol use disorder, vitamin E deficiency, and vitamin B12 deficiency

==Pathophysiology==

The pathophysiology of polyneuropathy depends on the &quot;type&quot;. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, for instance, is an autoimmune disease: T cells involvement has been demonstrated, antibodies alone are not capable of demyelination.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of polyneuropathy begins with a history (anamnesis) and physical examination to ascertain the pattern of the disease process (such as arms, legs, distal, proximal), if they fluctuate, and what deficits and pain are involved. If pain is a factor, determining where and how long it has been present is important; one also needs to know what disorders are present within the family and what diseases the person may have. Although diseases often are suggested by the physical examination and history alone, tests that may be employed include electrodiagnostic testing, serum protein electrophoresis, nerve conduction studies, urinalysis, serum creatine kinase (CK) and antibody testing; nerve biopsy is done sometimes.

Other tests may be used, especially tests for specific disorders associated with polyneuropathies; quality measures have been developed to diagnose patients with distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP).

===Differential diagnosis===

In terms of the differential diagnosis for polyneuropathy, the following must be considered:
==Treatment==

In the treatment of polyneuropathies one must ascertain and manage the cause, among management activities are: weight decrease, use of a walking aid, and occupational therapist assistance. Additionally, BP control in those with diabetes is helpful, while intravenous immunoglobulin is used for multifocal motor neuropathy.

According to Lopate, et al., methylprednisolone is a viable treatment for chronic inflammatory demyelinative polyneuropathy (which can also be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin). The authors also indicate that prednisone has greater adverse effects in such treatment, as opposed to intermittent (high-doses) of the aforementioned medication.

According to Wu, et al., in critical illness polyneuropathy supportive and preventive therapy are important for the affected individual, as well as, avoiding (or limiting) corticosteroids.

<doc id="797863" wikidata="Q313804" url="?curid=797863" title="Casper Van Dien">
<text>Casper Robert Van Dien Jr. (born December 18, 1968) is an American actor, best known for his lead role as Johnny Rico in the 1997 science-fiction action film &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. He has also appeared in a large number of television and film roles, often in daytime and primetime soap operas, and a large number of TV movies and direct-to-video films, including &quot;Starship Troopers 3: Marauder&quot;, a 2008 sequel to the original film.

==Early life==
Van Dien was born in Milton, Florida, the son of Diane (&quot;née&quot; Morrow), a nursery school teacher, and Casper Robert Van Dien Sr., a U.S. Navy Commander and fighter pilot.

There is a long military tradition in Van Dien&#x27;s family. Aside from his father, his grandfather was a Marine during World War II. Van Dien is descended from an old Dutch family long settled in the New York area; his other heritage includes Swedish, French, and English.

The street on which Van Dien grew up in Ridgewood, New Jersey, Van Dien Avenue, was named after his great-great-great-grandfather. When Van Dien was older, his family returned to Florida, where he enrolled at the St. Petersburg campus of the Admiral Farragut Academy, graduating 3rd in command. After high school, Van Dien attended Florida State University in Tallahassee, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

==Career==
After moving to Los Angeles, Van Dien landed a number of small parts in various television series and movies. Two early breaks were recurring roles as Ty Moody on the daytime soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and the prime time drama &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Keen to expand his acting talents, Van Dien took a bit part in the video game, &quot;Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom&quot;.

In 1996, Van Dien played King Tal in &quot;Beastmaster III: The Eye of Braxus&quot;, the second sequel to the 1982 cult classic, &quot;The Beastmaster&quot;. Van Dien also starred in the 1997 James Dean biopic &quot;James Dean: Race with Destiny&quot;. Soon after, he got the breakthrough role of Johnny Rico in Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s 1997 science fiction action film &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. His success in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; subsequently resulted in his casting as Tarzan in &quot;Tarzan and the Lost City&quot; (1998). Van Dien next played Brom von Brunt in Tim Burton&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, a reworking of the classic Washington Irving tale.

In 2000, Van Dien appeared in &quot;Cutaway&quot; as well as Aaron Spelling&#x27;s short-lived NBC prime time soap &quot;Titans&quot; with Yasmine Bleeth, John Barrowman, Perry King and Victoria Principal. He filmed several scenes as Patrick Bateman, in 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;. However, the scenes were unused in the final film.

In 2008, Van Dien returned to the role of Rico in &quot;Starship Troopers 3: Marauder&quot;, a direct-to-video sequel to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;.

Van Dien replaced Matt Mullins as Johnny Cage for the second season of the YouTube webseries &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot;.

In 2020, he joined the cast of the independent film &quot;Daughter&quot;. In 2022, Van Dien played the role of Samual Hyst in the series &quot;Salvage Marines&quot;, where he was also credited as a producer, an adaptation of the &quot;Necrospace&quot; book series; in an interview, he favorably compared this role to that of Johnny Rico.

==Personal life==
From 1993 to 1997, Van Dien was married to Carrie Mitchum (daughter of Christopher Mitchum and granddaughter of Robert Mitchum). Van Dien had co-starred with Robert Mitchum in &quot;James Dean: Race with Destiny&quot;. They have two children, including actress Grace Van Dien (b. 1996).

In 1999, Van Dien met actress Catherine Oxenberg during the filming of the TV movie &quot;The Collectors&quot;, and they soon worked together again in the 1999 thriller &quot;The Omega Code&quot;. On May 8, 1999, they married at Graceland Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2005, the couple appeared in their own reality series, &quot;I Married a Princess&quot;, which aired on the Lifetime Television channel in the United States, LIVINGtv in the United Kingdom and Lifestyle You in Australia; Oxenberg&#x27;s mother is Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia. During the 2006–2007 TV season, Van Dien and Oxenberg co-starred in the American drama series &quot;Watch Over Me&quot; on MyNetworkTV. Oxenberg had a daughter from a previous relationship, India Riven Oxenberg (b. 1991). Van Dien and Oxenberg have two daughters, born 2001 and 2003. In 2015, Van Dien filed for divorce from Oxenberg. Van Dien and Oxenberg were celebrity ambassadors for the non-profit organization Childhelp.

Van Dien married Jennifer Wenger in June 2018.

<doc id="797867" wikidata="Q5326290" url="?curid=797867" title="Earl of Holderness">
<text>The title Earl of Holderness also known as Holdernesse existed in the late 11th and early 12th centuries as a feudal lordship and was officially created three times in the Peerage of England namely in 1621, in 1644 as a subsidiary title to that of the then-Duke of Cumberland and in 1682. The official creations lasted 5, 38 and 96 years respectively.

The title was first held by Odo, Count of Champagne created Earl of Holderness (an area of land occupying the far east of East Yorkshire along the North Sea and Humber Estuary) by his brother-in-law William the Conqueror after the Norman Conquest. Odo was stripped of his English lands after being implicated in a plot to put his own son Stephen of Aumale upon the throne of England in place of his first cousin, William II. However, the title was restored to Stephen in 1089.

The first official creation, in 1621, along with the subsidiary title Baron Kingston upon Thames, of Kingston upon Thames in the County of Surrey, was in favour of John Ramsay, 1st Viscount of Haddington. As well as the Barony created with the Earldom, this Earl held the subsidiary titles Viscount of Haddington (1606), Lord Ramsay of Barns (1606) and Lord Ramsay of Melrose (1615), all in the Peerage of Scotland.

The second creation, in 1644, was as a subsidiary title of the Dukedom of Cumberland conferred on Prince Rupert of the Rhine, a nephew of King Charles I.

The third creation, in 1682, was in favour of Conyers Darcy, 2nd Baron Darcy and Conyers. In 1641, his father, Sir Conyers Darcy, had successfully petitioned King Charles I to be restored to the abeyant baronies of Darcy de Knayth (created 1332) and Conyers (created 1509), with remainder to his heirs male. These were considered new creations that became extinct upon the death of the 4th Earl of Holderness, at which time the earldom also became extinct. (The 1641 decision was reversed in 1903, however, and both baronies were restored to the original remainders, which could be inherited by daughters.)

<doc id="797868" wikidata="Q2074563" url="?curid=797868" title="Cammy">
<text>, also known by the codename , is a fictional character in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; fighting game series created by Capcom. She debuted in &quot;Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers&quot; (1993). She has also been featured in the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; games, first as a secret character and then as a playable character. The games explore her backstory as one of M. Bison&#x27;s &quot;dolls&quot; turned into an amnesiac operative for MI6.

Cammy has also appeared in other &quot;Street Fighter&quot; media, such as the 1994 live-action &quot;Street Fighter&quot; film and its animated spin-off, as well as &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, where she first received her full name prior to being integrated into the later mainline games. She has also been featured in various official comics and merchandise, as well as in the crossover series &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; and &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot;. Cammy has garnered positive critical reception from critics and fans, with praise towards her backstory, gameplay, and character design. She is a frequent subject of cosplay and is particularly noted for her sex appeal. Cammy is one of the most popular characters in the series, often receiving higher position in fan polls.

==Character design==
Capcom&#x27;s research and development head Noritaka Funamizu stated that Cammy&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; stemmed from his feeling that the game needed another female character besides Chun-Li. She was originally designed by the same person who had previously made &quot;Street Fighter&quot;&#x27;s Sagat and later also Morrigan Aensland for &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;. Compensating for the difference in sheer strength, Chun-Li and Cammy are faster than the other characters in the game.

Cammy is a fighter with a slender yet muscular body. She has long blonde hair which she usually wears in two braided pigtails, blue eyes and a scar on her left cheek. In &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;, she is shown wearing a green sleeveless thong leotard, a military red beret, red gloves and black boots, with green camouflage stains on her legs. This iconic incarnation is known as Delta Red Cammy and appears in the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; series of games, in some other games, in the American film and television productions, in several manga and comic book adaptations, in the home versions of &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; and its updates. &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; retains largely the same look, with the addition of a black harness on her torso and a gun holster around her right thigh, but she no longer wears the camouflage paint on her legs.

A different look was introduced in &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, where her style and moves are similar to those of both Spider-Man and Psylocke. This time, Cammy was depicted wearing a light blue, long sleeve thong leotard, a matching garrison cap, red gloves, brown leather boots, and a yellow necktie. The camouflage of her legs was replaced with blue stains in the shape of lightning bolts. This incarnation is known as Shadaloo Cammy or &quot;Killer Bee&quot; and appears in the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; and &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; series of games, as well as in &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot; and in several manga and comic adaptations. Shadaloo Cammy is approximately 16 years old.

In &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, in addition to the Delta Red attire, her default, Cammy has an alternate appearance which is reminiscent of the Shadaloo version. This consists of her wearing a blue zipped-up fleece thong leotard with matching knee-high boots with woolen trim, a Delta Red garrison cap, midnight-blue gloves and arm braces, and blue camouflage on her legs. In the consecutive &quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot;, she gains an additional alternate costume based on M. Bison&#x27;s, mostly by its red color and the similarly shaped hat and accessories. However, she still wears a thong leotard and camouflage paint on her legs. Her fourth alternative costume in the game has her in a catgirl-like costume, with metal gauntlets and leg coverings. In &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;, Cammy gains an additional two alternate costumes: one is based on King from &quot;Tekken&quot;, and the second is an all-original design inspired by a punk rock type of look, with her sporting a huge red bow, a black vest with a pink top, a red skirt with leather straps and black leather knee-high boots; she also got a leopard motif costume in an update. In &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, Cammy has various different alternate outfits, from a combat swimsuit to a schoolgirl uniform, along with another catgirl outfit, One of her poses in that game has been globally censored due to the West&#x27;s new sensibilities, disappointing and upsetting fans. In &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, in addition to being older, Cammy now has an entirely new outfit, consisting of a bob haircut with her classic front hair bangs, a turquoise blue leather jacket with belt straps, a black crop top with white trim, black leggings with a white linear design, red combat boots with black socks, and her classic arm gauntlets with slight modifications to them.

Cammy has a strong personality. She has a tough attitude, where one wrong word to her could mean a snapped neck, and is fearless in battle. She refuses to go down without a fight, using her extensive skills and abilities to her advantage. She is a driven and determined young woman; with a strong sense to help others in need. She wants to see herself as a protector of others as noted in her &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; story where she is seen taking care of Juni and looking out for her as she recovers from being a brainwashed Doll. Cammy is gentle, respectful, and kindhearted, but she can also be very irritable and dismissive, and can be very harsh on herself when she makes mistakes. One of Cammy&#x27;s most notable characteristics is her love for cats.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Street Fighter&quot; games===
Cammy was introduced in the fourth &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; revision, &quot;Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers&quot;, as one of four new characters joining the previous games&#x27;s roster. In this game, Cammy is a teen-aged agent of the fictional Delta Red commando task force within Britain&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) formed to investigate and eradicate global crime syndicates. In the Japanese version of her ending, she is revealed to have been an agent working for the villain M. Bison in the past, but lost her memories during a past operation. The American version instead reported her as a previous lover of M. Bison&#x27;s, but still having challenges related to amnesia. Other members of Delta Red include Commander Watson, Colonel Wolfman, Lt. Col. Hannah Ackerson (a relatively new addition), 1st Lieutenant Lita Luwanda (who treats Cammy as a little sister), Matthew McCoy, and George Ginzu.

A younger version of Cammy appears as an assassin working for Bison&#x27;s Shadaloo organization, with the codename &quot;Killer Bee&quot; (and in later games described as one of the &quot;Shadaloo Dolls&quot;), first in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold&quot;, where she appears as a hidden character available exclusively in the second player and training modes (however, this would be rectified in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha Anthology&quot; where she would be fully playable in Arcade mode with a complete storyline and ending), and then in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;, where she is a full-fledged playable character. In &quot;Alpha 3&quot;, Cammy is revealed to be a clone created from M. Bison&#x27;s DNA. The Game Boy Advance version of &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo: Revival&quot; and the Xbox Live and PSN remake &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix&quot; take into account this revelation in their versions of Cammy&#x27;s ending.

Cammy is again featured in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;. Set after the events of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (but before &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;), it depicts Cammy as having come to terms with her past as a brainwashed super soldier from Shadaloo and is now embarking a new mission with her Delta Red comrades (which include Commander Watson, Matthew McCoy, Colonel Wolfman, 1st Lieutenant Luwanda, and George Ginzu). This is the first time since the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; era that Cammy has appeared in her Delta Red depiction as opposed to her Shadaloo depiction, and also the very first time in which she actually speaks with an English accent as per Cammy&#x27;s birthplace being officially listed as Britain. However, due to her nature as a clone of Bison, this might not be her true place of origin. In her ending in this game, she destroys the BLECE data, believing the project to be what Bison had used to brainwash her in the first place. In the update &quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot;, Cammy still remembers her time as a &quot;doll&quot; and affectionately refers to the &quot;Dolls&quot; as her sisters, vowing to rescue them from Shadaloo. Her penultimate, &quot;rival&quot; fight is against newcomer Juri, on whom Cammy swears revenge for her ill actions towards the &quot;dolls&quot;, only for Juri to counter the accusation by bringing up Cammy&#x27;s dark past. In her new ending, Cammy consoles a recovering former &quot;doll&quot; (Juni from &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;); this new ending establishes the fact that she is recovering her memories, or at least trying to atone for the things she did in the past. In &quot;Ultra Street Fighter IV&quot;, Decapre, an early result of the Shadaloo cloning experiments that created Cammy, appears as a playable character. Cammy returned in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, where Cammy is able to rescue Decapre, who then join her after being freed from the brainwashing, and the other remaining Dolls during a final war against Shadaloo. However, as confirmed in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, where Cammy returns to investigate the connection between Amnesia’s first attack at Nayshall and the remnants of Shadaloo’s whereabouts, the death of her fellow former &quot;doll&quot;, Marz saddens her and the other surviving &quot;dolls&quot;.

===Other video games===
Cammy appears in her &quot;Alpha&quot; incarnation as a playable character in crossover fighting games &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot;, &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot;, &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot;, and &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;. She also appears as a playable character in the shoot &#x27;em up &quot;Cannon Spike&quot;, where she appears in her &quot;SSFII&quot; costume for her default form and in her &quot;Alpha&quot; outfit as an alternate appearance (additionally wearing roller skates in both cases), in the browser-based social games &quot;Onimusha Soul&quot;, where she is re-designed to fit the feudal Japan theme, and &quot;Street Fighter Battle Combination&quot;, as well as in the mobile puzzle game &quot;Street Fighter: Puzzle Spirits&quot;, where she is a super-deformed character.

In the crossover tactical role-playing game &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, Cammy appears as a brainwashed enemy character who later joins the player&#x27;s side as a partner to Chun-Li. Cammy has also made guest appearances in other non-Capcom games, such as &quot;Destiny Child&quot;, &quot;Gunslinger Stratos 2&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers: Legacy Wars&quot;, and &quot;Valkyrie Connect&quot;.

A redesigned Cammy appears in the beat&#x27;em up &quot;Final Fight: Streetwise&quot; as one of the underground pit fighters who challenges the player (she also has her own brand of lager, with advertising posters in the pool hall level). In the action role-playing game &quot;Monster Hunter Frontier Online&quot;, players can dress up their hunters in Cammy&#x27;s Shadoloo outfit, while &quot;Breath of Fire 6&quot; and &quot;Monster Hunter Explore&quot; have her Delta Red costume. Frank West in &quot;Dead Rising 4&quot; can also be dressed up as Cammy. Cammy was also added to &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;, alongs with Guile on August 7, 2021.

===Film and animation===
Cammy appears as one of the main heroes in the 1994 film &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. The film&#x27;s Cammy is a British intelligence agent who serves as Colonel Guile&#x27;s intelligence officer and aide-de-camp in the Allied Nations Army. She was portrayed by Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue, who also played Cammy in both &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot; video games. Prior to her casting, the film&#x27;s director, Steven E. de Souza, said they were &quot;having trouble finding Cammy. We&#x27;re seeing a lot of English girls, but they&#x27;re not very thin or they&#x27;re wimpy – they couldn&#x27;t beat up Pee Wee Herman.&quot; After looking at hundreds of actresses in the UK, US and Australia, de Soza came upon &quot;Who&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s 30 Most Beautiful People&quot; edition: &quot;Kylie was on the cover. Right away I said, &#x27;There&#x27;s our Cammy.

Cammy appears in two &quot;Street Fighter&quot; anime productions by Group TAC. In &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, Cammy appears in a scene early in the movie, where she assassinates British minister Albert Sellers after being brainwashed by Shadaloo. She is later seen being interrogated by Chun-Li. Her status after that is unclear, with Bison&#x27;s last orders to Sagat being the elimination of Vega and Cammy. In the English dub of the film, Cammy is portrayed with an American accent, rather than a British one.

In the &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot; series, Cammy is a former special forces operative-turned-assassin who is hired by Balrog to assassinate Chun-Li&#x27;s father, but is stopped by Fei Long. After her fight, she realizes that Balrog had tricked her and nearly kills him. Cammy has a completely different look in the series, wearing black leather pants a black body fit shirt, red gloves, red boots, and a black necklace with a silver cross. This incarnation of the character does not have a scar on her cheek and wears her hair in a single ponytail. As in the animated movie, the series&#x27; English dub depicts Cammy as American instead of British.

In the American &quot;Street Fighter&quot; animated series, Cammy appears in several episodes during the first season and is the central focus of a subplot in the second season. During the first season, she is an ally of Guile who has a flirtatious relationship with him, and is eventually made part of his team. However, she is brainwashed by Bison and becomes one of his underlings, fighting both Street Fighters and Delta Red during the remainder of the series. She turns on Bison when she learns that he had killed her parents, and switches sides back to her original allies.

Cammy was mentioned in &quot;Street Fighter: Resurrection&quot; episodes &quot;Fight &amp; Flight&quot; and &quot;Mission Critical&quot;. She appears in a cameo appearance in the 2012 animated film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, alongside other &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters.

===Other appearances===
In addition to appearing in the manga adaptations of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; games and anime, Cammy was the central character in Masahiko Nakahira&#x27;s 1994 manga &quot;Super Street Fighter II: Cammy&quot;, which was released in English by Viz Communications. It explores the 19-year-old Cammy&#x27;s background: her commando training in the UK, the years she lost to amnesia, and the encounters with M. Bison and his minions that changed her life. The plotline is not directly tied to the World Warriors tournament, instead introducing many new characters. Cammy would appear in Nakahira&#x27;s subsequent 1996 manga adaptation of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; (predating her appearance in &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold&quot;), where she appears as a brainwashed test subject named &quot;Killer Bee&quot;, a codename that was later adopted for the video game storyline. The &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; depiction of Cammy also appeared in the 1997 manga &quot;Street Fighter: Sakura Ganbaru!&quot;, too by Nakahira. In &quot;Sakura Ganbaru!&quot; she is first named &quot;Cammy&quot; by Sakura by chance, the name coming from a cat in her neighborhood Cammy reminds her of.

In addition to publishing English-language adaptations of the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; and &quot;Sakura Ganbaru!&quot; manga, UDON released an original comic book series retelling the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; story. In it Cammy, working as Bison&#x27;s &quot;Killer Bee&quot; assassin, is the one directly responsible for the death of Chun-Li&#x27;s father. Elsewhere, she is tracking Ryu in San Francisco under orders from Shadaloo, when she is confronted and captured by Rose, who undoes Shadaloo&#x27;s brainwashing then leaves her in front of the British embassy in Italy. Cammy has no memory of anything leading up to that moment, but a terrorist attack on the embassy suddenly triggers her latent fighting ability and she foils the threat, after which Delta Red promptly sign her on as a member. While she completes missions with Delta Red, Cammy pieces together remnants of her memory and does her best to make up for any sins she might have committed in Shadaloo&#x27;s name. During the second series, Cammy takes a leave from Delta Red to find out more about her past. She travels to Mexico with Chun-Li to meet T. Hawk for a joint investigation, but they are intercepted by M. Bison, who recaptures her and demands she represent Shadaloo in the upcoming tournament he is hosting. Cammy is brought back to Shadaloo where her brainwashing is resumed during the third series (&quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;), but Vega frees her from the brainwashing before the tournament finishes. Cammy acts as though she is still under Bison&#x27;s command but enlists the help of Chun-Li and Guile. In the aftermath she has rejoined Delta Red.

&quot;Cammy History&quot;, a two-volume light novel by Yuka Minakawa featuring Cammy as the main character, was published by Wani Books in 1995. Cammy artwork was featured on a lenticular print NubyTech/UDON wireless joypad prototype for the PlayStation 2, which was announced on May 11, 2005, but was never released; and a Mad Catz wireless joypad for the PlayStation 3. She was also a subject of numerous figures from various manufacturers, including Funko, Kotobukiya, S.H. Figuarts, and many others. Assorted merchandise included a line of women&#x27;s lingerie and a figurine that came with a DyDo drink.

==Reception==
Cammy has become and remained one of the most popular characters in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise, starting as the most successful of the new characters from &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;. She won Capcom&#x27;s official poll &quot;Which character do fans most want in &quot;SFIV&quot;?&quot; in 2008, gathering almost as many votes as all the other seven characters in the list combined. She also came second in Capcom&#x27;s previous poll of 85 characters for the 15th anniversary of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; in 2005 and won a 2008 poll put forth by Capcom asking the fans to choose which character they would like to see to return for &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, motivating Yoshinori Ono to implement her as fast as possible to meet the demand. In an official poll by Namco, Cammy has been the fourth-most-requested &quot;Street Fighter&quot; side character to be added to the roster of &quot;Tekken X Street Fighter&quot;, taking 15% of all votes. In 2014, users of the Japanese internet board 2channel voted her second most &quot;kawaii&quot; female &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character. In a 2018 worldwide poll by Capcom, Cammy was voted 11th-most-popular &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character. Official &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; (UK) described themselves as &quot;big fans of Cammy&quot; and her other fans included Jamie Lee Curtis. At ResetEra, Cammy was voted as the second-most popular &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character, behind only Chun-Li.

Cammy has been rated highly among the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters by many media outlets. &quot;Tips &amp; Tricks&quot; stated about &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;: &quot;If anything &quot;XSF&quot; is a great game simply because it marks the return of Cammy.&quot; IGN placed her as number nine in their 2008 list, noting her sex appeal and unique gameplay and adding &quot;of the four new fighters in &quot;Super Turbo&quot;, she&#x27;s the only one who made a return appearance in future games&quot;, while GameDaily ranked her at seventh place in their list of top &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters for her &quot;incredible&quot; assassin skills and &quot;her military motif that showcases some of the best legs in video games.&quot; In 2010, UGO Networks similarly placed her at seventh spot on their list of top &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters, stating that while she does not have any projectile attacks, she &quot;makes up for the lack of distance fighting with quick and close kicks.&quot; IGN Japan ranked her seventh in 2018. She was ranked as the third-best female character in &quot;Street Fighter&quot; by The Gamer&#x27;s Christopher Sanfilippo, whom observed &quot;Cammy&#x27;s precise close-range combat makes her an enjoyable fighter to play. Flying into the air with her Hooligan Combination and taking a character down is such a satisfying feeling.&quot; At &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, Gavin Jasper ranked her as the eighth-best &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character, whom added &quot;I mean, the exposed cheeks have helped keep people interested, but even then, she&#x27;s able to stand alone based purely on her twisty, flippy offense and determined coldness.&quot;

&quot;Destructoid&quot; writer CJ Andriessen considers her the best character in the entire series, citing her moveset and also reasoning &quot;...her awesome back story, great costume and the fact she was played by Kylie Minogue in the movie, Cammy is easily the best Street Fighter character...&quot; SNK artist Falcoon stated Leona Heidern is the company&#x27;s response to Cammy; both of whom are implosion assassins.

As with R. Mika, Cammy also received some censorship in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, which alters the angle of her entrance pose, removing her &quot;crotch shot;&quot; this has led to some backlash. In addition to the censorship, during a 2017 &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; tournament, ESPN did not allow players to choose her default costume, due to her thong leotard.

===Sex appeal===

Since her debut, Cammy has been acclaimed for her sex appeal, placing in many &quot;hottest girls in gaming&quot; lists. &quot;GamePro&quot; described Cammy as &quot;one of the most risque characters ever seen in a video game!&quot; Brazilian &quot;Ação Games&quot; opined she &quot;comes to finish the hegemony of Chun Li&quot; and &quot;Hyper&quot; similarly commented she &quot;replaces Chun Li as the resident &quot;SF2&quot; sex symbol&quot;. &quot;GamesMaster&quot; gave &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; the new subtitle &quot;SSF2: Cammy Forever&quot;. Cammy was given the &quot;Hottest Game Babe of 1993&quot; award by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly.&quot; She was ranked as the fifth-sexiest character in games by &quot;Ação Games&quot; in 1997 and included among the &quot;Miss Consoles&quot; by German &quot;Video Games&quot; in 2000, described as superior to Chun-Li.

NBC News included Cammy on their 2012 list of the top five most preposterous video game outfits: &quot;[W]e have one simple piece of advice: Put on some pants.&quot;

<doc id="797880" wikidata="Q5326235" url="?curid=797880" title="Earl of Clare">
<text>Earl of Clare was a title of British nobility created three times: once each in the peerages of England, Great Britain and Ireland.
The title derives from Clare, Suffolk, where a prominent Anglo-Norman family was seated since the Norman Conquest, and from which their English surname sprang from possession of the Honour of Clare. The Norman family who took the name &#x27;de Clare&#x27; became associated with the peerage as they held, at differing times, three earldoms (Gloucester, Pembroke and Hertford).

== Honour of Clare ==
The death of the young Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, at the Battle of Bannockburn (1314) entailed the break-up of the Honour of Clare, as he and his young wife were childless and the lands were distributed among three co-heiresses. His death marked the end of the great de Clare family. The family lands were worth as much as £6,000, second only to those of the Earl of Lancaster among the nobility of the realm.

The lands went into royal wardship while the matter of inheritance was settled. By the entail of 1290, the lands could only be inherited by direct descendants of the late earl&#x27;s father. The late earl&#x27;s sisters, Eleanor, Margaret (now widowed after the death of Piers Gaveston) and Elizabeth were by 1317 all married to favourites of Edward II: Hugh Despenser the Younger, Hugh de Audley and Roger d&#x27;Amory, respectively. The three were granted equal parts of the English possessions, but Despenser received the entire lordship of Glamorgan in Wales, politically the most important of the de Clare lands.

== Possible medieval earls ==
The &quot;Earl of Clare&quot; was probably not a medieval title. Some contemporary sources called them &quot;Earls of Clare&quot;, but many modern historians treat this as if it were a &quot;styled&quot; (self-assumed) title. There was no standardised method of reference to earls in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the Clares were one of a handful referred to as earls in this period without a county mentioned. For example, Gerald of Wales recounts an incident relating to the Earl of Clare, possibly referring to William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester. Such references led some older historians to assume the Earls of Gloucester and Hertford also carried the title Earls of Clare. The title, for instance, is given in the original &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. The confusion probably stems from misinterpretation of references, such as that of &quot;Earl Gilbert de Clare&quot;, in which Clare was taken as a title rather than a surname. One view is there was no such title in existence, and that the first creation of the title Earl of Clare dates to 1624. However, John Burke in 1831 states that prior to the 1624 creation, Robert Rich, Earl of Warwick, was to be created Earl of Clare, but that it was refused by the crown lawyers, &quot;on a solemn declaration, that it was a title peculiar to the royal blood and not to be conferred upon a subject.&quot;

==Earl of Clare, first creation (1624)==

The title of Earl of Clare was formally created by letters patent in the peerage of England on 2 November 1624 for John Holles. He was first elevated to the peerage as Baron Houghton of Houghton by King James I on 9 July 1616. According to Burke, he was ennobled thanks to the influence of the George Villiers, Viscount Villiers, future Duke of Buckingham, to whom Holles paid £10,000 (). He was created Earl of Clare following an additional payment of £5,000.

The fourth earl married Lady Margaret Cavendish, third daughter and co-heir of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle, and he inherited the majority of the Duke&#x27;s estates upon his death in 1691. On 14 May 1694, he was created Marquess of Clare and Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

The fourth earl&#x27;s only child, Lady Henrietta Cavendish Holles, married Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. Their daughter, Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley, who married William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland.

The title became extinct upon the death the fourth earl in 1711.

*John Holles, 1st Earl of Clare (1564–1637)
*John Holles, 2nd Earl of Clare (1595–1666)
*Gilbert Holles, 3rd Earl of Clare (1633–1689)
*John Holles, 4th Earl of Clare (1662–1711), created Marquess of Clare and Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1694

==Earl of Clare, second creation (1714)==

The next creation of the Earl of Clare was in the Peerage of Great Britain for Thomas Pelham, nephew and heir of the last earl of the first creation. He had been adopted by his uncle and assumed the arms and surname of Holles. He was a significant statesman during the early Georgian era, and he served as the First Lord of the Treasury, among other roles.

He was created Viscount Pelham of Houghton and Earl of Clare on 26 October 1714.

=== Marquess of Clare (1715) ===
The following year, on 2 August 1715, he was further created Marquess of Clare and Duke of Newcastle, with remainder to his brother the Rt. Hon. Henry Pelham. In 1756, he was created Duke of Newcastle Under Lyne with remainder to his nephew, Henry Fiennes-Clinton, 9th Earl of Lincoln. His brother predeceased him, leaving no male heirs, and at his death in 1768, the titles of Earl of Clare and Marquess of Clare again became extinct, but he was succeeded by his nephew as Duke of Newcastle Under Lyne.

*Thomas Pelham-Holles, Earl of Clare (1693–1768), created Marquess of Clare and Duke of Newcastle in 1715

==Earls of Clare, third creation (1795)==

The title was again created, in the peerage of Ireland, in 1795 for John FitzGibbon, 1st Viscount FitzGibbon, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He had already been created Baron FitzGibbon, of Lower Connello in the County of Limerick, in 1789, and Viscount FitzGibbon, of Limerick in the County of Limerick, in 1793. These titles were also in the peerage of Ireland. In 1799 he was made Baron FitzGibbon, of Sidbury in the County of Devon, in the peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He served as Governor of Bombay from 1830 to 1834. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third earl. He represented County Limerick in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of County Limerick. Lord Clare&#x27;s only son, John Charles Henry FitzGibbon, styled Viscount FitzGibbon, was killed in action during the Battle of Balaclava where he charged with the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars. On Lord Clare&#x27;s death in 1864 the peerages became extinct.

*John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare (1748–1802)
*John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare (1792–1851)
*Richard Hobart FitzGibbon, 3rd Earl of Clare (1793–1864)

<text>Paul Jason Robb is an American synthesizer player, producer, songwriter and one of the founding members of the band Information Society.

== Biography ==
Robb was a member of Information Society from its inception in the early 1980s until 1992 (after its third release &quot;Peace and Love, Inc.&quot;).

When Information Society&#x27;s contract with Tommy Boy/Reprise/Warner Bros. Records ended, Paul (who at the time had a new infant) chose to work in films and commercials, winning two Clio Awards for BMW ads in the process. In 1996, he started a record company called Hakatak International. Hakatak featured his one-man industrial-tinged band Think Tank, as well as a trip hop- and world music-flavored collaboration with Minneapolis folk singer Barbara Cohen named Brother Sun Sister Moon.

When trip hop briefly gained mainstream popularity following the release of Portishead&#x27;s &quot;Dummy&quot;, Brother Sun Sister Moon recorded for Virgin Records, causing the temporary dissolution of Hakatak in June 1997. No album ever resulted from that deal, however, and to this day neither Robb nor Virgin will say what happened.

Robb continued to do TV, film, and commercial work but had no further commercially recorded output until January 2002, when he reappeared with a new record company named Bleep! Records and an album under the name of Luminous, which turned out to be a renamed Brother Sun Sister Moon. The Bleep! Web site promised a new Robb solo album under the name Bitcrusher, but that album was not released before Robb&#x27;s investors pulled the plug and killed Bleep! in late 2002.

Robb owns a recording studio in Los Angeles called Digitalis (a pun on the heart drug) and continues to produce music for advertisements and television shows. His credits include MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Real World&quot; and &quot;Road Rules&quot; and the score for Trey Parker and Matt Stone&#x27;s first movie &quot;Orgazmo&quot;. He later remixed the theme for Parker and Stone&#x27;s long-running &quot;South Park&quot; series and was involved in the &quot;Chef Aid&quot; album as well.

It was announced in 2006 that Robb and James Cassidy would reform Information Society with a new vocalist, Chris Anton. Original vocalist Kurt Harland opted out, citing work and family obligations for a time, but resumed his role as lead singer in 2008. In 2007, the band released an EP, &quot;Oscillator&quot;, and a new album, &quot;Synthesizer&quot;, under the resurrected Hakatak label. In 2014 Kurt rejoined the band full time and the album &quot;Hello World&quot; was released being the first studio album featuring the lineup of Harland, Robb and Cassidy since 1992.

<doc id="797882" wikidata="Q5012766" url="?curid=797882" title="CLIVAR">
<text>CLIVAR (climate and ocean: variability, predictability and change) is one of six projects of the World Climate Research Programme. Its purpose is to describe and understand climate variability and predictability on seasonal to centennial time-scales, identify the physical processes responsible for climate change and develop modeling and predictive capabilities for climate modelling.

==History==
The following is an approximate timeline of CLIVAR and its precedents:

* 1985: The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) initiated the TOGA (Tropical-Ocean Global Atmosphere Project) (1985-1995) to study interannual variability driven by the ocean-atmosphere system in the tropics.
* 1990: The WCRP began the first observational phase of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (1990-1997)
* 1991: The Joint Scientific Committee (JSC) of the WCRP called on a group of experts to come together and consider the possible future directions for climate research, building on the foundation laid by TOGA and WOCE.
* 1992: The deliberations of the Joint Scientific Committee were published in 1992 in a brochure entitled ‘CLIVAR – a study of Climate Variability and Predictability’.
* 1993: The WCRP JSC decided to undertake CLIVAR as a major activity.
* 1995: CLIVAR was officially launched, initially as a 15-year project. The launch coincided with the end of TOGA.
* 1997: The first CLIVAR implementation plan was published.

==Panels and working groups==
CLIVAR has a number of panels and working groups based on the study of climate variability and predictability of different components of the global climate system.

===Global panels===

CLIVAR has four global panels:

* Global Synthesis and Observation Panel
* Climate Dynamics Panel
* Ocean Model Development Panel
* CLIVAR/GEWEX Monsoons Panel

===Regional panels===
Regional panels focus on specific aspects of the climate system. Since the different regions of the ocean are qualitatively different, and given the important role of the oceans in controlling climate over the interannual, decadal, and centennial scales considered by CLIVAR, the subdivision into panels is largely based on regions of the ocean system:

* Atlantic Region Panel
* CLIVAR /CliC Northern Oceans Region Panel
* CLIVAR/CliC/SCAR Southern Ocean Region Panel
* CLIVAR/IOC-GOOS Indian Ocean Region Panel
* Pacific Region Panel

===Research foci===
CLIVAR RFs are temporary 3-5 years groups that drive priority climate research through bottom-up efforts, foster cross-panel and WCRP-wide collaboration, and engage new scientists. The current RFs are:

* Tropical Basin Interaction
* Marine Heatwaves in the Global Ocean

<doc id="797883" wikidata="Q225965" url="?curid=797883" title="Mealworm">
<text>Mealworms are the larval form of the yellow mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, a species of darkling beetle.

The yellow mealworm beetle prefers a warmer climate and higher humidity. Male mealworms release a sex pheromone to attract females to mate.

&quot;Tenebrio molitor&quot; has been used in biomedical research. Mealworms can be a dietary source for animals and humans. They are also considered pests, especially to food storage.

== Description ==
Like all holometabolic insects, &quot;T. molitor&quot; goes through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Larvae typically measure about or more. Adults are generally in length.

&quot;T. molitor&quot; is dark brown or black as an adult, with larvae up to long and adults up to long.

The yellow mealworm beetle can be differentiated from other beetles, due to the linear grooves that are evenly divided and run along the abdomen. The beetle has only four tarsal segments on its hind legs. Most ground beetles, which are similar in size to &quot;Tenebrio molitor&quot;, have five tarsal segments.

Commonly mistaken with the black mealworm beetle (&quot;T. obscurus&quot;), key variations in regard to size and shape distinguish these two. The abdomen of the adult black mealworm beetle is more rounded and ends in a pointed tip, as opposed to the more rectangular and blunt-ended abdomen of the yellow mealworm beetle. The larvae of &quot;T. molitor&quot; are lighter colored than those of &quot;T. obscurus&quot;.

== Distribution ==
Mealworms most-likely originated in the Mediterranean region, but are now present in many areas of the world as a result of human trade and colonization. The oldest archaeological records of mealworms can be traced to Bronze Age Turkey. Records from the British Isles and northern Europe are from a later date, and mealworms are conspicuously absent from archaeological finds from ancient Egypt.

== Life cycle ==
The eggs hatch 4 to 19 days after the female oviposits.

During the larval stage, the mealworms feed on vegetation and dead insects, and molt between each larval stage, or instar (9 to 20 instars). After the final molt, they pupate. The new pupa is whitish and turns brown over time. After 3 to 30 days, depending on environmental conditions such as temperature, it emerges as an adult beetle.

=== As larvae ===
In studies, &quot;T. molitor&quot; larvae show an incubation period of seven to eight days and a period of three to four days for the first instar. After the first instar, there is significant variation for the number of days in each instar period, though variation may be due to malnutrition or pathogens. Before emergence, most larvae typically go through 15 to 17 instars, with very few larvae going through the 19 to 20 instars.

The body length of the larvae gradually increases with each successive instar, reaching maximum length at the 17th instar. The body length decreases beyond the 17th instar. Pupation occurs after the 14th instar, with most larvae showing total pupation between the 15th and 17th instars. Larvae are white in the first instar and gradually turn brown after the second instar.

=== Effect of parental age and temperature ===
Offspring produced by older beetles have shorter larval stages than those produced by younger beetles. Larvae from the older beetles also show a rapid weight increase at an earlier age than those from young parents. At 25 °C, the larval stage was shortened, the number of larval molts decreased, and the durations of adult life decreased when parental age increased, compared to the beetles at 30 °C. Another study found that at 20°, 25°, and 30 °C, parental age does not have any effect on the duration of the egg stage, or the weights of the eggs.

However, the amount of hatched eggs decreased when parental age increased. When eggs were laid during the first two months after emergence, approximately 90% of the eggs hatched. When they were laid after four months, only about 50% hatched. It was found that larvae from young parents grow at a slower rate, compared to larvae produced by the same parents, nine weeks earlier. At 30 °C, there were no other effects of parental age on the larvae. At 20° and 25 °C, the larvae from young parents required significantly more time to complete development, and had more molts compared to the larvae from the same parents after they had aged one more or longer. The duration of adult life decreased when parental age increased.

== Reproduction ==

A sex pheromone released by male mealworms has been identified. Inbreeding reduces the attractiveness of sexual pheromone signaling by male mealworms. Females are more attracted to the odors produced by outbred males than the odors produced by inbred males. The reduction of male signaling capability may be due to increased expression of homozygous deleterious recessive alleles, caused by inbreeding.

The mealworm beetle breeds prolifically. Males insert sperm packets with their aedeagus. Within a few days, the female burrows into soft ground and lays eggs. Over her adult lifespan of about 6–12 months, a female will, on average, lay about 500 eggs.

== Mating ==
Researchers examined whether female beetles preferred males infected by the tapeworm &quot;Hymenolepis diminuta&quot; as mates, or noninfected males. Virgin females were found to spend more time near and copulated more often, with noninfected males in the experiment. Mating behavior was also found to be influenced by the mass of the male beetle. A larger male was preferred and mated with first compared to a smaller male mate. Overall, female beetles showed mating preferences for noninfected males who were larger in size. One explanation provided by researchers for this findings is that noninfected males who are larger may allow females to gain genetic or material benefits.

=== Immunocompetence ===
Evidence suggests that in many animal species, secondary sexual traits reflect male immunocompetence, the ability of an individual’s immune system to resist and control pathogens or parasites. A study found that a single parasite-like immunological challenge, created via a nylon monofilament implant in the beetle, significantly reduced the sexual attractiveness and locomotor activity of males, it did not negatively affect their survival. When the inserts were removed, the majority of the males showed greater encapsulation responses of the implant, though some of the males seemed to have already chosen a terminal reproductive investment strategy. And thus, the majority of males invest in their immune system after the first challenge.

A second immune challenge increased their attractiveness, but was found to significantly reduce locomotor activity of the males and increase their mortality. This represents a trade-off between pheromone production and energy required for activities such as immune system recovery and locomotor activity.

When there was a third challenge, implantation, in the same males, there was a lower encapsulation rate of the nylon implants in more attractive males than the less attractive, showing how the males made no attempts to boost their immune system. The results suggest that the males who become sexually attractive after the second immune challenge have a trade-off, where they sacrifice locomotor activity and do not energetically invest in immune system recovery. This shows how the female mealworm beetles consistently preferred males who invested significantly less in immune system recovery, and that males are not able to allocate resources simultaneously to both improving their health, or in this case, recovery of their immune system, and to increasing their sexual attractiveness.

=== Nutritional condition ===
Pheromones are chemical signals that function as mate attractors and relay important information to prospective mates. For a reliable signal, it must be costly to produce, which means it is likely to have condition dependent expression. A study found that female preference of the pheromones was dependent on the nutritional condition of the males. They spent significantly more time with males who received constant food, than males who received no food. Phenoloxidase activity was dependent on the nutritional condition of the males, with phenoloxidase activity being two to six times higher in males with constant food, than in males who received no food. However, nutritional conditions had no effect on the encapsulation rate of the males.

When receiving constant food, male initial body mass had no correlations with phenoloxidase activity or encapsulation rate. This shows that pheromone mediated attractiveness and the immunocompetence in terms of phenoloxidase activity of males were condition-dependent, as both decreased with nutritional stress. This suggests that there is a trade-off between allocation of resources and energy into the production of pheromones and immunocompetence, and that the production of pheromones are condition dependent sexual traits.

== Immune defense ==
The mealworm beetle is currently considered a pest when infesting and degrading the quality of stored grains or grain products. However, they are now being promoted as a beneficial insect, as their high nutrient content makes them a viable food source for pet food, protein-rich animal feed, or even human nutrition, and they are capable of degrading plastic waste and polystyrene. These benefits make mealworms attractive for mass rearing, a technique that promotes disease transmission within the colonies.&quot;T. molitor&quot; can be the host of many different pathogens and parasites, including entomopathogenic microbes, protozoa, and tapeworms, which can decrease the mealworm beetle’s survival or reproductive success.

=== Behavioral immunity ===
When the mealworms feed on infected rodent feces, they may consume the eggs of the tapeworm parasite &quot;Hymenolepis diminuta&quot;. Infected male beetles pay a higher reproductive cost than the female beetles. &quot;T. molitor&quot; displays behavioral immunity when exposed to &quot;H. diminuta&quot;, shown by how the infected males develop an avoidance behavior for feces that harbor the tapeworm, which decreases their probability of coming into contact with the tapeworm in the future. The female mealworm beetles develop a qualitative resistance through mate choice, as they are able to evaluate male immunocompetence through pheromone signaling, allowing them to choose the more immunologically fit males as mates. This also reduces the probability of the females being infected by their mates, and may cause them to pass on an enhanced level of immunocompetence to their offspring.

Another way mealworms may display behavioral immunity is how they may tolerate infections by limiting negative effects on their reproductive success. For example, mealworm beetles tolerate a high number of cysticercoids of &quot;H. diminuta&quot; at the expense of their own fitness and longevity. But the males produce improved spermatophores that contain superior nuptial gifts that will be passed to their mating females, increasing female fecundity and causing a greater number of eggs to be fertilized.

=== Cuticular color ===

Cuticular color (pigmentation of the cuticle) is a heritable component and varies from tan to black. In the mealworm beetle, evidence suggests that population level variation in cuticular color is linked to pathogen resistance in that darker individuals are more resistant to pathogens. A study found that two immune parameters related to resistance, haemocyte density and pre-immune challenge activity of phenoloxidase, were significantly higher in selection lines of black beetles compared to tan lines. Higher haemocyte density is likely indicative of a heightened immune response.

There were no effects of gender on the immune traits. Cuticular color is dependent on melanin production, which requires phenoloxidase, an enzyme that is present in its inactive form inside haemocytes. This shows why darker insects have a heightened immune response and are more resistant to pathogens that invade the hemocoel via the cuticle. However, there was no significant difference in haemolymph antibacterial activity between black and tan lines, explained by how antimicrobial peptides are produced by haemocytes but are not involved in cuticular darkening.

In &quot;T. molitor,&quot; the degree of cuticular melanization is a strong indicator of resistance to the entomopathogenic fungus &quot;Metarhizium anisopliae&quot;, which could be explained by the thicker and less porous cuticle displayed by darker insects compared to lighter ones. However, there seems to be underlying trade-offs that prevent the fixation of the darker phenotype, shown by how the plasticity of melanization phenotypes in response to population density may contribute to the absence of predominance of darker individuals among &quot;T. molitor&quot; populations.

=== Food restriction ===
Because immune defenses against parasites and pathogens require metabolic resources, food restriction can impair immune function of &quot;T. molitor.&quot; For adult &quot;T. molitor&quot; beetles, phenoloxidase activity can be reduced by half during short-term food deprivation, but returns rapidly to original levels when the beetles are given access to food again. &quot;T. molitor&quot; larvae can eat five times more food per day than usual following an immune challenge, to compensate for the caloric loss from the immune response. These immune challenged larvae show significant weight loss when fed with either protein or carbohydrate rich diets, but show stable weights when given both protein and carbohydrate-rich diets.

Healthy &quot;T. molitor&quot; larvae usually prefer diets with a lower protein to carbohydrate ratio, but shift toward food with higher protein contents after an immune challenge with bacteria. This causes enhanced hemocyte circulation and antibacterial activity in the hemolymph, which likely maximizes resistance against bacterial infection. However, phenoloxidase activity is not affected by this shift in diet choice.

A study found that the effects of nutritional imbalance on body composition were buffered by the subsequent selection of complementary foods. This demonstrates that the mealworm beetles are capable of compensating for nutritional imbalances and that the way nutritional balance is restored depends on the nutrient that is initially deficient in their food. For example, if the beetles were previously fed a protein-rich, carbohydrate-deficient diet, they would prefer carbohydrates to protein, whereas beetles fed a carbohydrate-rich, protein-deficient diet, they would strongly prefer a protein-rich diet. They found that self-selecting &quot;T. molitor&quot; beetles recovered from carbohydrate or protein deficiency within six days by selecting the complementary diet.

== Gut microbiota ==
The gut microbiota of &quot;T. molitor&quot; consists of many different bacterial species present at low abundance. A study found a predominance of genus &quot;Spiroplasma&quot; species in the phylum Tenericutes in the gut samples of &quot;T. molitor&quot;, but there was variation found in the community composition between individuals. Although some &quot;Spiroplasma&quot; species are known insect pathogens, the &quot;T. molitor&quot; larvae did not experience any harmful effects from the presence of the &quot;Spiroplasma&quot; in the gut, indicating that they are not pathogens to the host.

By comparing this to the bacterial communities found in other insects, it was found that the &quot;Spiroplasma&quot; species found were specific to &quot;T. molitor.&quot; The gut bacteria community structure was not significantly affected by the presence of antibiotics or by the exposure of the beetle larvae to a more highly diverse soil bacteria community. There is a negative relationship between bacterial diversity and ampicillin concentration, meaning ampicillin treatment caused a reduction in the bacterial community size, which was determined with pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and no negative relationship when kanamycin was added.

Polystyrene foam decreases &quot;T. molitor&quot; fecundity, but the beetle can fully develop using the plastic as its primary source of food, which makes it an interesting alternative to recycle polystyrene. However, when the mealworm’s microbiota is disrupted by an antibiotic treatment, it loses its ability to digest polystyrene, suggesting that its associated gut microbes are essential in the digestion process. Specifically, the bacterium &quot;Exiguobacterium&quot; species, which was isolated from the midgut of mealworms, was demonstrated to degrade polystyrene in vitro.

== Relationship with humans ==
=== As feed and pet food===

Mealworms are typically used as a pet food for captive reptiles, fish, birds, and some small mammals. They are also provided to wild birds in bird feeders, particularly during the nesting season. Mealworms are useful for their high protein content. They are also used as fishing bait.

They are commercially available in bulk and are typically available in containers with bran or oatmeal for food. Commercial growers incorporate a juvenile hormone into the feeding process to keep the mealworm in the larval stage and achieve an abnormal length of 2 cm or greater.

=== As food ===
Mealworms are edible for humans, and processed into several insect food items available in food retail such as insect burgers.

Due to their high protein and fat content, as well as consuming large amounts of fiber, they represent a good food source for humans. They are high in oleic acid, which may decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in the blood.

Mealworms have historically been consumed in many Asian countries, particularly in Southeast Asia. There, they are commonly found in food markets and sold as street food alongside other edible insects. Baked or fried mealworms have been marketed as a healthy snack food in recent history, though the consumption of mealworms goes back centuries.

In May 2017, mealworms were approved as food in Switzerland. In June 2021, dried mealworms were authorized as novel food in the European Union, after the European Food Safety Authority assessed the larvae as safe for human consumption.

Mealworm larvae contain significant nutrient content. For every 100 grams of raw mealworm larvae, 206 kilocalories and anywhere from 14 to 25 grams of protein are contained. Mealworm larvae contain levels of potassium, copper, sodium, selenium, iron and zinc that rival those of beef. Mealworms contain essential linoleic acids. They have a greater vitamin content by weight compared to beef, B12 not included.

Mealworms may be easily reared on fresh oats, wheat bran or grain, with sliced potato, carrots, or apple as a moisture source. The small amount of space required to raise mealworms has made them relevant for scalable industrialized mass production.

=== Possible health risks ===
Some evidence suggests that &quot;T. molitor&quot; may pose a health risk, as humans and animals can consume the eggs and larvae of the beetle with grain-based food. Although they are usually either digested or are excreted with feces, sometimes, they are able to survive and live in the alimentary tract. The first cases of &quot;T. molitor&quot; larvae in human organs date back to the 19th century, where their presence was observed in the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach and intestines. There were other cases, such as a reported ulcer infestation of &quot;T. molitor&quot; in an AIDS patient and a concerned urinary canthariasis in a ten year old boy in Iran in 2019, which was the last reported human case of canthariasis caused by &quot;T. molitor&quot;. However, there are very few reported cases of live larvae in animals, and there are no reports of gastrointestinal canthariasis in farm animals.

===In waste disposal===
In 2015, it was discovered that 100 mealworms can degrade polystyrene into usable organic matter at a rate of about 34–39 milligrams per day. No difference was found between mealworms fed only Styrofoam and the mealworms fed conventional foods, during the one-month duration of the experiment. Microorganisms inside the mealworm&#x27;s gut are responsible for degrading the polystyrene, proven by reducing the property of degradation when mealworms were given gentamicin. Isolated colonies of the mealworm&#x27;s gut microbes, however, have proven less efficient at degradation than the bacteria within the gut.

<doc id="797884" wikidata="Q1523402" url="?curid=797884" title="Maquoketa River">
<text>The Maquoketa River is a tributary of the Mississippi River, approximately long, in northeastern Iowa in the United States. Its watershed covers within a rural region of rolling hills and farmland southwest of Dubuque. It is not to be confused with the Little Maquoketa River, another distinct direct tributary of the Upper Mississippi River meeting the Big River north of Dubuque. The river and its tributaries mark the border of the Driftless Area of Iowa, with the areas east of it not having been covered by ice during the last ice age. Its name derives from &quot;Maquaw-Autaw&quot;, which means &quot;Bear River&quot; in Meskwaki.

==Course==
The Maquoketa rises in southeastern Fayette County just southwest of Arlington in Fairfield Township, and approximately east of Oelwein. It flows briefly northeastward, then generally southeastward through Clayton, Delaware, Jones and Jackson Counties, through Backbone State Park and the towns of Dundee, Manchester and Monticello.

At Maquoketa, it receives the North Fork Maquoketa River from the north; the North Fork rises in northern Dubuque County and flows generally southward past Dyersville and Cascade. The Maquoketa then flows generally eastward in a meandering course as it approaches the Mississippi. It enters Pool 13 of the Mississippi from the southwest in eastern Jackson County a few miles upstream from Sabula approximately 30 mi (48 km) southeast of Dubuque.

The river is considered one of the best smallmouth bass and trout fisheries in Iowa.

==Dams==
There are four small dams on the river:
* Delhi Dam (the USGS terms it, Hartwick Dam) impounds Lake Delhi downriver from Manchester in Delaware County. On Saturday July 24, 2010, the dam at Lake Delhi failed due to heavy rains and the rapid rise of the Maquoketa River. The dam has since been reconstructed.
* The Mon-Maq dam in Jones County just east of Monticello was once used to generate power for the town and is now a candidate for dam removal
* The Backbone Lake dam in Backbone State Park.
* The Lakehurst dam at Maquoketa.

==Recreation==
The stretch of river from just below the Mon-Maq dam to Iowa Highway 136 is one of Iowa&#x27;s most popular canoe trips. Along much of this stretch, the river flows through a canyon bounded by steep cliffs of Silurian dolomite. Large tracts of surrounding land are open to the public, including the Pictured Rocks Wildlife Management Area (1,138 acres, cooperatively managed by Jones County and the Iowa DNR, and the Indian Bluffs Primitive Area State Preserve (845 acres, privately owned, managed by the Iowa DNR). The canyon walls in Pictured Rocks make it one of the most popular rock climbing areas in Eastern Iowa, with numerous routs and pre-set anchors for climbing ropes; the highest rock face is 75 feet (23m).

Maquoketa Caves State Park, a few miles upstream from Maquoketa protects a segment of the Driftless Area&#x27;s karst topography, characterized by caves, ice caves and sinkholes.

<doc id="797885" wikidata="Q489187" url="?curid=797885" title="Anchor Brewing Company">
<text>Anchor Brewing Company was a brewery on Potrero Hill in San Francisco, California. Founded in 1896, the brewery underwent several changes in location and ownership throughout its history. After years of declining sales due to competition with larger breweries, Anchor was purchased by Frederick Louis “Fritz” Maytag III in 1965, preventing its closure. The brewery operated at its Potrero Hill location from 1979 and was one of the last remaining producers of steam beer, a variety of beer trademarked by the company.

In 2010, the company was purchased by The Griffin Group, an investment and consulting company focused on alcohol brands, and became part of Anchor Brewers &amp; Distillers, LLC.

In 2017, the company was acquired by Sapporo Breweries for US$85 million. Sapporo&#x27;s ownership oversaw significant declines in revenue for the brewery, and in 2023, Anchor Brewing ceased operations, with plans to liquidate the business. In July 2023, Anchor Brewing closed, and its workers attempted to buy out the firm as a worker-owned cooperative. Instead, on May 31, 2024, Chobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya announced that he was buying the company and its associated assets. He said that he planned to restart the company and keep its operations in San Francisco.

==History==
===Early brewing===

The brewery that would become Anchor was built during the California Gold Rush when Gottlieb Brekle arrived from Germany and began brewing steam beer in San Francisco. In 1896, Ernst F. Baruth and his son-in-law, Otto Schinkel, Jr., bought the old brewery, creating Anchor Brewing. This original location was completely destroyed in the fires that engulfed San Francisco following the 1906 earthquake. It was rebuilt at a different location in 1907. After the deaths of Baruth and Schinkel, the brewery was run by Joseph Kraus and August Meyer until Prohibition forced the brewery to shut down. There is no record of what Anchor did during Prohibition, but it resumed operations at a new location once Prohibition in California came to an end in 1933. However, the new location burned down in 1944, with Kraus reopening Anchor at another location the same year.

The brewery continued operations through the 1950s, but suffered heavily from the country&#x27;s increasingly strong preference for beers produced by mega-breweries. While there had been more than 4,000 breweries at the turn of the twentieth century, shifts in the industry due to Prohibition and the consolidation of brewing companies meant that only 70 remained by the 1960s. As a result of declining sales, Anchor shut down in 1959, but was bought and reopened the following year at a new location by Lawrence Steese.

===Purchase by Maytag===
By 1965, the brewery was once again suffering from poor sales. The quality of Anchor&#x27;s beer had deteriorated under Steese due to a lack of expertise, proper equipment, and poor sanitation standards, which prevented the consistent production of a commercially viable product. The brewery gained a reputation for producing sour beer, and convincing existing distributors to continue to sell the beer became a challenge.

In 1965, Frederick Louis &quot;Fritz&quot; Maytag III bought the brewery, saving it from closure. Maytag purchased 51% of the brewery for a few thousand dollars, and purchased the brewery outright in 1969. By 1971, the brewery began to bottle steam beer (along with other varieties of beer, most notably a Christmas ale) under the direction of Fritz. Fritz purchased an old coffee roastery on Potrero Hill to serve as Anchor&#x27;s new location in 1979. This building serves as the current location of the brewery.

Turning the failing brewery around required more money than Maytag had from his inherited fortune from the Maytag Company. Between the initial purchase of Anchor and producing the first batches of bottled beer in 1971, Maytag had to learn the brewing process from scratch, invest in new equipment, and improve sanitation in the brewing process. The result was a new beer that was a definitive representative of California common beer, but a derivative to the historic steam beer manufactured by Anchor through the previous century.
Before offering in bottles, sales were only as draft beer to thirty local establishments that had long carried the brand. Total production was only 800 barrels in 1969, 1,200 in 1970, and 2,100 in 1971. The bottles were initially sold in four-packs, to keep the price close to mainstream six-packs.

===Growth and development===
Due to its sale at many local establishments, Anchor&#x27;s steam beer was well-known in the San Francisco area, having a reputation of local importance that grew under Maytag&#x27;s ownership. In 1977, Arnold Schwarzenegger portrayed an Anchor Brewing employee in an episode of Streets of San Francisco, with Fritz Maytag making a cameo as another employee.
During the 1980s, Anchor&#x27;s Steam Beer began to gain national attention and demand increased. Anchor ultimately served as an early example of a microbrewery, being among the first American breweries to produce porters, barley wine, and India pale ales with regularity. Its success both regionally and nationally inspired others to enter the brewing business, notably New Albion.

In 1989, the company produced a limited beer named Ninkasi, based on a 4000-year-old Sumerian recipe found in a ode to the Sumerian goddess of beer known as the “Hymn to Ninkasi.” The recipe started with a twice-baked bread known as bappir as well as malt and was sweetened with honey and dates. It did not include hops or other bittering ingredients, making it considerably sweeter than modern beers. The recipe is described by Charlie Papazian. Also in 1989, the brewing process for a batch of beer was interrupted during the Loma Prieta earthquake. The resulting (altered) brew was released as normal Anchor Steam, but with an inverted label; this beer has come to be referred to as &quot;Earthquake Beer&quot;.

In 1993, the company opened Anchor Distillery, a microdistillery in the same location as the brewery, and began making a single malt rye whiskey, named &quot;Old Potrero,&quot; after the hill on which the brewery stands. In 1997, the microdistillery began producing a gin, called &quot;Junípero&quot;—Spanish for juniper, and a reference to Fr. Junípero Serra, an important figure in San Francisco&#x27;s and California&#x27;s history. The distillery also produces a Jenever style gin called Genevieve, using wheat, barley, rye, and the same herbal ingredients as their Junípero gin.

In 2010, Maytag sold the company to former Skyy vodka executives Keith Greggor and Tony Foglio, from Novato, California, who planned to expand Anchor&#x27;s business while keeping its commitment to artisan brewing. In 2013, the brewery launched Anchor California Lager, a re-creation of a historic Boca Brewing lager from the 1870s. The brewery also announced a major expansion plan at Pier 48 in the Mission Rock neighborhood near Oracle Park, which would expand Anchor&#x27;s maximum annual production capacity from 180,000 barrels to 680,000 barrels.

In 2014, Anchor officially announced Anchor IPA, the first India Pale Ale in the brewery&#x27;s history. Anchor ended production of its winter seasonal Bock in 2014 and replaced it a year later with Anchor Winter Wheat.

===Purchase by Sapporo and unionization===
In 2017, Anchor was purchased by Sapporo for $85 million. Working conditions and pay at Anchor had been in a state of decline since Maytag had sold the company, and this trend continued under Sapporo&#x27;s ownership despite the company&#x27;s larger holdings. This led to further dissatisfaction among the brewery&#x27;s workers. In 2018, several workers at Anchor, among them Brace Belden, formed an organizing committee and coordinated with the DSA chapter in San Francisco to develop a plan for unionization with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. The unionization efforts were overwhelmingly supported by local bars which served Anchor Steam Beer in the city.

In 2019, Anchor Brewing workers voted by an almost 2-to-1 margin to join the International Longshore and Warehouse Union making Anchor Brewing – including Anchor Public Taps, the brewery&#x27;s on-site brew pub – the first unionized craft brewery in the United States. The three-year union contract was officially ratified in 2020, providing workers with increased wages, health insurance, and other benefits.

In 2021, Anchor Brewing announced a major makeover of their logo and beer labels. On the eve of their 125th birthday, the brewery replaced their vintage-looking labels with a large Anchor logo in a two-tone color schemes per beer. Most labels were not changed in decades or at all. The design change was met with criticism by consumers.

===Announced closure===
In 2023, union efforts to renew the existing contract were stalled, with Sapporo delaying negotiations. Soon after, Anchor announced it would no longer distribute nationally and would cease production of its signature Christmas Ale.

On July 12, 2023, Sapporo announced it was ceasing operations at Anchor and liquidating the business. Sapporo blamed the closure on decreased sales at restaurants and bars caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, competition from other local brewers, and a shift in consumer preferences to alcoholic beverages other than beer. Employees were given a 60-day WARN notice on July 12. The announcement led to significant outrage from brewery workers, San Francisco bartenders, and locals, with passing drivers chanting &quot;keep brewing&quot; outside the building.

A spokesman for Sapporo quoted by the &quot;New York Times&quot; said that the firm sought a buyer for Anchor before announcing that the brewery would close, and that it was still possible one might emerge. To liquidate Anchor, Sapporo has elected to enter into an alternative to the traditional bankruptcy process known as &quot;Assignments for the Benefit of Creditors&quot;. Through the process, an &quot;assignee&quot; other than Sapporo will assume stewardship of Anchor and consider bids for the company&#x27;s assets. Through this process, a new owner might emerge.

In July 2023, Anchor Brewing closed, and its workers attempted to buy out the firm as a worker-owned cooperative. Instead, the founder and CEO of Chobani bought out the company in 2024, with the intention of restarting its operations.

===Purchase by Chobani founder===
On May 31, 2024, it was announced that the brewery would be purchased by the founder of Chobani and re-opened.

==Former products==
Anchor had a year-round range of seven beers, as well as several seasonal beers. In 2012, Anchor introduced the Zymaster series, which placed an emphasis on brewing tradition. These beers were generally of an extremely limited nature.

<text>Michael Cretu (, ; born 18 May 1957) is a Romanian-German musician, singer, songwriter, composer, and record producer. He gained worldwide fame as the founder and musician behind the musical project Enigma, which he formed in 1990.

Cretu began a music career in 1976 as a solo artist and released numerous studio albums as well as writing and producing albums for his then-wife, German pop singer Sandra. He also worked with artists through the 1980s, including Peter Cornelius, Hubert Kah, and Mike Oldfield. Cretu was sometimes identified as &quot;Curly&quot; or &quot;Curly M.C.&quot;, in reference to his curly hair and &quot;creț&quot; meaning &quot;curly&quot; in Romanian.

Cretu scored an unexpected worldwide commercial hit with the debut Enigma album &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot; (1990), helped by its lead single, &quot;Sadeness (Part I)&quot;. Cretu continues to produce Enigma albums and singles; the most recent is &quot;The Fall of a Rebel Angel&quot; (2016), its eighth overall. Enigma has sold an estimated 70 million albums worldwide, Cretu&#x27;s management company Crocodile-Music stated that Cretu&#x27;s produced recordings have sold 100 million copies worldwide.

==Early life==
Cretu was born on 18 May 1957 in Bucharest, Romanian People&#x27;s Republic, to a Romanian father and Austrian mother. In 1965, he studied the piano and classical music at Colegiul Tehnic Nr. 2 in Bucharest, followed by further study in Paris for five months in 1968. Around this time, Cretu wished to pursue a career in pop music after listening to &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; on &quot;Abbey Road&quot; (1969) by The Beatles, calling the song &quot;beautiful&quot;. After he informed his mother, Cretu recalled: &quot;She goes, &#x27;Aaargh! Disaster! Do you want to end up starving?&#x27;&quot; In 1975, Cretu relocated to Bad Homburg, West Germany and studied at the Academy of Music in Frankfurt, where he graduated with a degree in musical composition in 1978. Cretu went on to speak four languages.

==Career==

===1976–1988: Solo career, producer, and early bands===
After graduating from the Academy of Music, Cretu remained in West Germany and took up work as a session musician. Among Cretu&#x27;s first jobs was being taken on as keyboardist and producer for West-German recording artist Frank Farian, and playing keyboards on &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; by Boney M. In 1981, Cretu co-formed the West-German new wave band Moti Special with other session players. Their debut album &quot;Motivation&quot; (1985) contained the single &quot;Cold Days, Hot Nights&quot; which became a hit around Europe. Cretu left the group before they released their second album in 1990.

Cretu&#x27;s first solo album was released in 1979, titled &quot;Moon, Light &amp; Flowers&quot;. It contains the singles &quot;Shadows Over My Head&quot; and &quot;Wild River&quot; released in 1978, and &quot;Moonlight Flower&quot; and &quot;Love Me&quot; (the latter two singles became popular hits in the Philippines) from 1979. His second album, &quot;Legionäre&quot;, was released in 1983 and features German lyrics sung by him. Cretu&#x27;s third solo album was titled &quot;Die Chinesische Mauer&quot; and was released in 1985. The literal English translation is &quot;The Chinese Wall&quot;. As with the second album, it features German lyrics sung by Cretu and is co-produced by Armand Volker. This album was also released as a separate album with English-language lyrics and a different track listing under the name &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;. Several of the tracks on &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; were edited slightly and, therefore, had different lengths than the German-language versions on &quot;Die Chinesische Mauer&quot;. This featured the song &quot;Samurai&quot;, which became a hit.

In 1985, Cretu produced, arranged and played the keyboards, drums, and programming on &quot;The Long Play&quot; (1985), the first studio album from West-German pop singer Sandra. The two began a relationship, and were married in 1988.

In the 1980s, Cretu took over production for the pop quartet Hubert Kah and started writing songs with the band leader Hubert Kemmler, achieving a number of hits. Among his other work, Cretu was also one of the producers of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Islands&quot; and the producer of Peter Schilling&#x27;s 1989 &quot;The Different Story (World of Lust and Crime)&quot; album.

In 1992, Cretu worked with Peter Cornelius on &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;, to provide the guitar riffs.

For the third album, Cretu teamed up with Jens Gad to work together on &quot;Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!&quot; and launched in 1998 a new trance project Trance Atlantic Air Waves and the album &quot;The Energy of Sound&quot;.

He owned the A.R.T. Studios in Ibiza before moving to a new mansion in the Ibiza hills. His former house, near Sant Antoni de Portmany on the western coast of Ibiza, was a Moroccan-style mansion that was designed and built by Bernd Steber and Gunter Wagner in more than nine years. It also featured a new recording studio. The Spanish High Court deemed the house to have been built illegally and in infringement of Spanish environmental regulations which led to the €18 million villa being razed in May 2009.

===1988–present: Enigma===
Cretu was encouraged to pursue a solo project by Oldfield, who was impressed by his studio production skills and musical ideas. This led to the creation of his musical project Enigma, which Cretu said was born from the idea of making music that he himself liked, while bringing in a sense of mysticism. The formation of Enigma involved Fabrice Cuitad, under the alias of David Fairstein, and Frank Peterson. The trio worked together to create their groundbreaking debut single &quot;Sadeness (Part I)&quot;, which became a surprise international hit. &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot;, the album, which was released in 1990, was hugely successful.

Cretu was not surprised by the album&#x27;s unexpected success, as he recalled telling his wife before its release, &quot;This will be a huge hit or nothing at all&quot;. Cretu&#x27;s style of mixing a variety of musical genres, samples and sounds was very unusual to the ears of the listening public at the time, and led to him being described as an &quot;alchemist in sound&quot;.

The second album, &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot;, was released in 1993. Peterson had disagreements with Cretu by the time of recording and left the project in 1991. Cretu changed Enigma&#x27;s direction from Gregorian chants to tribal chants for its second album, culminating in its second international hit single &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;.

Cretu purposefully reduced the use of Gregorian chants as numerous artists had started to use them in their music, causing &quot;an avalanche of bad copies&quot;, but later regarded it as a compliment.

Cretu was approached by Paramount Pictures to write the soundtrack of the film &quot;Sliver&quot; and he came up with another 1993 single &quot;Carly&#x27;s Song&quot; after the main female character&#x27;s name.

In 1996 Enigma&#x27;s third album &quot;Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi!&quot; was released. Stylistically, it sounded like a combination of the first and second albums. It did not achieve the same level of success as them, but sold over 1 million copies in the United States and received a Gold certificate in the United Kingdom nonetheless.

In 1999 Cretu steered the project in another direction by using samples of Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; for the fourth album &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot;, released in 2000. Andru Donalds and Ruth-Ann Boyle first appeared as features on this Enigma project. Although Jens Gad had been working with Cretu on the earlier albums, this was the first time that he had been given actual credits.

In 2001, Cretu released two Enigma compilation albums: &quot;Love Sensuality Devotion: The Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Love Sensuality Devotion: The Remix Collection&quot; that include credits to ATB. By this time, Enigma has clocked close to an estimated 30 million sales worldwide.

Cretu continued to record Enigma albums, releasing &quot;Voyageur&quot; in 2003. Familiar sounds of the Shakuhachi flute, tribal or Gregorian chants were replaced with more commercially-friendly tunes and beat. In March 2006, a new single called &quot;Hello and Welcome&quot; was released in anticipation of another album, &quot;A Posteriori&quot;.

&quot;A Posteriori&quot; is the sixth Enigma studio album. It was released on 22 September 2006.

&quot;Seven Lives Many Faces&quot; is the seventh Enigma studio album. It was released on 19 September 2008.

&quot;The Fall of a Rebel Angel&quot; was released on 11 November 2016.

==Personal life==
Cretu married Sandra on 7 January 1988; together they have twin sons who were born in July 1995. They lived in Ibiza, Spain in a home that also housed A.R.T. Studios, where the Enigma albums were recorded. In November 2007, the couple divorced. The Ibiza home was bulldozed after Cretu lost a legal battle in which he did not obtain planning permission to renovate and build on the site. After the divorce, Cretu remarried. He now lives in Munich.

Cretu became known as an artist who kept a low profile, giving few interviews and avoiding concert tours.

<text>Darkling beetle is the common name for members of the beetle family Tenebrionidae, comprising over 20,000 species in a cosmopolitan distribution.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Tenebrio&quot; is the Latin generic name that Carl Linnaeus assigned to some flour beetles in his &quot;10th edition of Systema Naturae&quot; 1758–59. The name means &quot;lover of darkness&quot;; the English language term &#x27;darkling&#x27; means &quot;characterised by darkness or obscurity&quot;; see also English &#x27;tenebrous&#x27;, figuratively &quot;obscure, gloomy.&quot;

Many Tenebrionidae species inhabit dark places; in genera such as &quot;Stenocara&quot; and &quot;Onymacris&quot;, they are active by day and inactive at night.

The family covers a varied range of forms, such that classification presents great difficulties. These eleven subfamilies were listed in the 2021 review by Bouchard, Bousquet, &quot;et al.&quot;, updating a similar catalog from 2005.
* Alleculinae 
* Blaptinae 
* Diaperinae 
* Kuhitangiinae 
* Lagriinae 
* Nilioninae 
* Phrenapatinae 
* Pimeliinae 
* Stenochiinae 
* Tenebrioninae 
* Zolodininae 

Ongoing phylogenetic studies are showing that some taxonomic changes are needed. For instance the tribal classification of tribe Pedinini has recently been altered.

The misspelling &quot;Terebrionidae&quot; occurs frequently enough to be easily overlooked. The error appears to have no particular significance, but to be the product of misreadings, mis-scans and mis-typings.
The oldest known member of the family is &quot;Jurallecula&quot; from the Late Jurassic Karabastau Formation of Kazakhstan, assigned to the subfamily Alleculinae.

==Characteristics==
The Tenebrionidae may be identified by a combination of features, including:
* Their eleven-segmented antennae that may be , moniliform or weakly clubbed
* First abdominal sternite is entire and not divided by the hind coxae
* Eyes notched by a frontal ridge
* Four segments in the hind pair of tarsi and five in the fore and mid-legs (5-5-4), with simple claws

==Biology and ecology==
Tenebrionid beetles occupy ecological niches in mainly deserts and forests as plant scavengers. Most species are generalistic omnivores, and feed on decaying leaves, rotting wood, fresh plant matter, dead insects, and fungi as larvae and adults. Several genera, including &quot;Bolitotherus&quot;, are specialized fungivores which feed on polypores. Many of the larger species are flightless, and those that are capable, such as &quot;T. molitor&quot;, often rarely do so.

The larvae, known as mealworms or false wireworms, are usually fossorial, heavily sclerotized and nocturnal. They may possibly be an important resource for certain invertebrates and small mammals. Adults of many species have chemical defenses and are relatively protected against predators. Adults of most species, except grain pests, have slow metabolisms, and live long lives compared to other insects, ranging from approximately six months to two years.

Some species live in intensely dry deserts such as the Namib, and have evolved adaptions by which they collect droplets of fog that deposit on their elytra. As the droplets accumulate the water drains down the beetles&#x27; backs to their mouthparts, where they swallow it.

Humans spread some species such that they have become cosmopolitan, such as &quot;Tribolium castaneum&quot;, the red flour beetle, which was spread through grain products.

==Notable types==
The larval stages of several species are cultured as feeder insects for captive insectivores or as laboratory subjects:
* &quot;Tenebrio molitor&quot;, or mealworm, is commonly used to feed terrestrial amniotes kept in terraria.
* &quot;Tribolium castaneum&quot; is a laboratory animal useful as a model organism, especially in studies of intragenomic conflict and population ecology.
* &quot;Zophobas morio&quot;, or superworm, is valued as a feed for captive reptiles; it contains less chitin than &quot;Tenebrio molitor&quot;.
* &quot;Alphitobius diaperinus&quot;, lesser mealworm
* Many tenebrionids are pests of cereal and flour silos and other storage facilities, including &quot;T. castaneum&quot;, other &quot;Tribolium&quot; species such as &quot;Tribolium confusum&quot; and &quot;Tribolium destructor&quot;, and &quot;Gnatocerus cornutus&quot;
* In southwestern North America, species of the genus &quot;Eleodes&quot; (particularly &quot;E. obscurus&quot;) are well known as &quot;pinacate beetles&quot; or &quot;desert stink beetles&quot;.
* Several genera, such as &quot;Stenocara&quot; and &quot;Onymacris&quot;, are of interest in ecological studies of arid conditions and their associated adaptations.
* &quot;Ulomoides dermestoides&quot;, known as &quot;chinese weevil&quot;, &quot;peanut beetle&quot;, &quot;cancer beetle&quot;, or &quot;asthma beetle&quot;, is eaten in Argentina where it is thought to be a treatment for cancer, asthma, and other illnesses.
* &quot;Luprops tristis&quot; is found in India, where it is known as the Mupli beetle. It is notorious for a defensive secretion that causes skin burns. Since they congregate in large numbers, they can easily become a pest.

<text>Eefsele is a hamlet in the Dutch municipality of Oost Gelre, a part of the province of Gelderland, Netherlands.

It was first mentioned in 1315 or 1316 as Everslo, and means &quot;forest of Evert (person)&quot;. It is not a statistical entity, and the postal authorities have placed it under Lievelde. The hamlet was accidentally bombed on 8 February 1945, because the target was a German stronghold in the forest. Eefsele consists of about 80 houses.

<text>Aleksander Mikhailovich Rodchenko (; – 3 December 1956) was a Russian and Soviet artist, sculptor, photographer, and graphic designer. He was one of the founders of constructivism and Russian design; he was married to the artist Varvara Stepanova.

Rodchenko was one of the most versatile constructivist and productivist artists to emerge after the Russian Revolution. He worked as a painter and graphic designer before turning to photomontage and photography. His photography was socially engaged, formally innovative, and opposed to a painterly aesthetic. Concerned with the need for analytical-documentary photo series, he often shot his subjects from odd angles—usually high above or down below—to shock the viewer and to postpone recognition. He wrote: &quot;One has to take several different shots of a subject, from different points of view and in different situations, as if one examined it in the round rather than looked through the same key-hole again and again.&quot;

He is also known for developing the early corporate identity of the airline Dobrolyot, later Aeroflot, and designed its world-famous &quot;Winged Hammer and Sickle&quot; logo.

== Life and career ==

Rodchenko was born in St. Petersburg to a working-class family who moved to Kazan after the death of his father, in 1909. He became an artist without having had any exposure to the art world, drawing much inspiration from art magazines. In 1910, Rodchenko began studies under Nicolai Fechin and Georgii Medvedev at the Kazan Art School, where he met Varvara Stepanova, whom he later married.

After 1914, he continued his artistic training at the Stroganov Institute in Moscow, where he created his first abstract drawings, influenced by the Suprematism of Kazimir Malevich, in 1915. The following year, he participated in &quot;The Store&quot; exhibition organized by Vladimir Tatlin, who was another formative influence.

Rodchenko&#x27;s work was heavily influenced by Cubism and Futurism, as well as by Malevich&#x27;s Suprematist compositions, which featured geometric forms deployed against a white background. While Rodchenko was a student of Tatlin&#x27;s he was also his assistant, and the interest in figuration that characterized Rodchenko&#x27;s early work disappeared as he experimented with the elements of design. He used a compass and ruler in creating his paintings, with the goal of eliminating expressive brushwork.

Rodchenko worked in Narkompros and he was one of the organizers of RABIS. RABIS was formed in 1919–1920.

Rodchenko was appointed Director of the Museum Bureau and Purchasing Fund by the Bolshevik Government in 1920, responsible for the reorganization of art schools and museums. He became secretary of the Moscow Artists&#x27; Union and set up the Fine Arts Division of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Education, and helped found the Institute for Artistic Culture.

He taught from 1920 to 1930 at the Higher Technical-Artistic Studios (VKhUTEMAS/VKhUTEIN), a Bauhaus organization with a &quot;checkered career&quot;. It was disbanded in 1930.

In 1921 he became a member of the Productivist group, with Stepanova and Aleksei Gan, which advocated the incorporation of art into everyday life. He gave up painting to concentrate on graphic design for posters, books, and films. He was deeply influenced by the ideas and practice of the filmmaker Dziga Vertov, with whom he worked intensively in 1922.

Impressed by the photomontage of the German Dadaists, Rodchenko began his own experiments in the medium, first employing found images in 1923, and from 1924 on, shooting his own photographs as well. His first published photomontage illustrated Mayakovsky&#x27;s poem, &quot;About This&quot;, in 1923. In 1924, Rodchenko produced what is likely his most famous poster, an advertisement for the Lengiz Publishing House sometimes titled &quot;Books&quot;, which features a young woman with a cupped hand shouting &quot;книги по всем отраслям знания&quot; (Books in all branches of knowledge), printed in modernist typography.

From 1923 to 1928 Rodchenko collaborated closely with Mayakovsky (of whom he took several portraits) on the design and layout of LEF and &quot;Novy LEF&quot;, the publications of Constructivist artists. Many of his photographs appeared in or were used as covers for these and other journals. His images eliminated unnecessary detail, emphasized dynamic diagonal composition, and were concerned with the placement and movement of objects in space. During this period, he and Stepanova painted the well-known panels of the Mosselprom building in Moscow. Their daughter, , was born in 1925.

Throughout the 1920s, Rodchenko&#x27;s work was very abstract. Rodchenko joined the October Group of artists in 1928 but was expelled three years later, charged with &quot;formalism&quot;, an accusation first raised in the pages of Sovetskoe Foto in 1928. 

As changes developed in the Soviet Union in the late 1920&#x27;s (particularly the exiles of Leon Trotsky in 1928 and from the Soviet Union entirely in 1929, along with the rise of Joseph Stalin), so did the form by which Soviet art was expected to conform to. In the 1930s, with the changing Party guidelines governing artistic practice in favor of Socialist realism, the artist and photographer saw mounting criticism from state-sponsored art critics and the Party. Osip Brik, a well-established author and art critic who was similarly entrenched in the politics and evolving art-culture, offered what was scathing criticism at the time for the photographer’s series on &quot;The Building on Miasnitskaia Street&quot; and &quot;Pine Trees in Pushkino&quot;, saying, “one should not depict an isolated building or tree, which may be beautiful but which will be a painting, will be aesthetic.”  Similarly to Brik, Sergei Tretyakov attacked Aleksandr Rodchenko’s stylized work, saying, “Instead of exploring the whole range of utilitarian goals confronting photography, Rodchenko is only interested in its aesthetic function. He reduces its activity to simply a reeducation of taste based on certain new principles. We are seeking ‘a new aesthetics’: the capacity to see the world in a new way.” 

In 1935, the Masters of Soviet Art exhibition was held, but Rodchenko was only allowed to produce work for the exhibit under the command that he publicly denounce his previous &quot;formalist&quot; works. The self-denouncement was published in &quot;Sovetskoe Foto&quot;, adding insult to injury. &quot;Henceforth I want to decisively reject putting formal solutions to a theme in the first place and ideological ones in second place; and at the same time I want to search inquisitively for new riches in the language of photography, in order, with its help, to create works that will stand on a high political and artistic level, works in which the photographic language will fully serve Socialist Realism.”

Despite denouncement and censorship, Rodchenko oscillated between conformity and rebellion in his work, producing one of his most famous photos in 1934, &quot;Girl with Leica&quot;, which followed similar stylistic choices to the artist and photographer&#x27;s prior work. 

== Retirement and death ==
He returned to painting in the late 1930s, stopped photographing in 1942, and produced abstract expressionist works in the 1940s. He continued to organize photography exhibitions for the government during these years. He died in Moscow in 1956.

== Influence ==
Much of the work of 20th century graphic designers is a direct result of Rodchenko&#x27;s earlier work in the field. His influence has been pervasive. American conceptual artist Barbara Kruger owes a debt to Rodchenko&#x27;s work.

His portrait of Lilya Brik has inspired a number of subsequent works, including the cover art for a number of music albums. Among them are the influential Dutch punk band The Ex, which published a series of 7&quot; vinyl albums, each with a variation on the Lilya Brik portrait theme, the cover of Mike + the Mechanics album &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;, and the cover of the Franz Ferdinand album &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better&quot;. The poster for &quot;One-Sixth Part of the World&quot; was the basis for the cover of &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, also by Franz Ferdinand.

== The end of painting ==
In 1921, Rodchenko executed the first true monochrome paintings, first displayed in the 5x5=25 exhibition in Moscow. For artists of the Russian Revolution, Rodchenko&#x27;s radical action was full of utopian possibility. It marked the end of easel painting – perhaps even the end of art – along with the end of bourgeois norms and practices. It cleared the way for the beginning of a new Russian life, a new mode of production, a new culture. Rodchenko later proclaimed, &quot;I reduced painting to its logical conclusion and exhibited three canvases: red, blue, and yellow. I affirmed: it&#x27;s all over.&quot;

<doc id="797901" wikidata="Q978424" url="?curid=797901" title="Prince Hall">
<text>Prince Hall (December 7, 1807) was an American abolitionist and leader in the free black community in Boston. He founded Prince Hall Freemasonry and lobbied for education rights for African American children. He was also active in the back-to-Africa movement.

Hall tried to gain a place for New York&#x27;s enslaved and free blacks in Freemasonry, education, and the military, some of the most crucial spheres of society in his time. Hall is considered the founder of &quot;Black Freemasonry&quot; in the United States, known today as Prince Hall Freemasonry. He formed the African Grand Lodge of North America, and was unanimously elected its Grand Master and served until he died in 1807. Steve Gladstone, author of &quot;Freedom Trail Boston&quot;, states that Hall was &quot;one of the most influential free black leaders in the late 1700s&quot;.

There is confusion about his birth year, place of birth, parents, and marriages, partly because there were numerous &quot;Prince Halls&quot; during this period.

== Early life ==
Hall was born between 1735 and 1738. His place of birth and parents are also unclear. Hall mentioned in his writings that New England was his homeland. The Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, in its &quot;Proceedings of 1906&quot;, opted for 1738, relying on a letter from Reverend Jeremy Belknap, a founder of the Massachusetts Historical Society. Hall&#x27;s birthday is traditionally celebrated on September 14.

Hall&#x27;s early years are unclear. Historian Charles H. Wesley theorized that by age 11, Hall was enslaved (or in service) to Boston tanner William Hall, and by 1770 was a free, literate man and had been always accounted as a free man. It was through William Hall that Prince learned how to process and dress leather. &quot;Inside Prince Hall&quot; author and historian David L. Gray states that he was unable to find an official historical record of the manumission. Hall was able to read and write, and may have been self-taught, or may have had assistance.

== Revolutionary War ==
Hall encouraged enslaved and freed blacks to serve in the American colonial military. He believed that if blacks were involved in founding the new nation, it would aid in attaining freedom for all blacks. Hall proposed that the Massachusetts Committee of Safety allow blacks to join the military. He and fellow supporters petition compared the Intolerable Acts with the enslavement of blacks. Their proposal was declined.

England issued a proclamation that guaranteed freedom to blacks who enlisted in the British Army. Once the British Army filled its ranks with black troops, the Continental Army reversed its decision and allowed blacks into the military. It is believed, but not certain, that Hall was one of the six &quot;Prince Halls&quot; from Massachusetts to serve during the war.

Having served during the Revolutionary War, many African Americans expected, but did not receive, racial equality when the war ended. Intending to improve the lives of fellow African Americans, Hall collaborated with others to propose legislation for equal rights. He also hosted community events, such as educational forums and theatre events, to improve the lives of black people.

== Freemasonry ==
Hall was interested in the Masonic fraternity because Freemasonry was founded on liberty, equality, and peaceful ideals. Before the American Revolutionary War, Hall and fourteen other free black men petitioned for admittance to the all-white Boston St. John&#x27;s Lodge. They were turned down. Having been rejected by colonial Freemasonry, Hall and 15 others sought and were initiated into Masonry by members of Lodge No. 441 of the Grand Lodge of Ireland on March 6, 1775. The Lodge was attached to the British forces stationed in Boston. Hall and other freedmen founded African Lodge No. 1, and he was named Grand Master.

The black Masons had limited power; they could meet as a lodge, participate in the Masonic procession on St. John&#x27;s Day, and bury their dead with Masonic rites but could not confer Masonic degrees or perform any other essential functions of a fully operating Lodge. Unable to create a charter, they applied to the Grand Lodge of England. The grand master of the Mother Grand Lodge of England, H. R. H. The Duke of Cumberland, issued a charter for the African Lodge No. 1, later renamed African Lodge No. 459 September 29, 1784. The lodge was the country&#x27;s first African Masonic lodge. On March 22, 1797, Hall organized a lodge in Philadelphia, called African Lodge #459, under what was known as Prince Hall&#x27;s Charter. They later received their own charter. On June 25, 1797, he organized the African Lodge (later known as Hiram Lodge #3) at Providence, Rhode Island.

Author and historian James Sidbury wrote: 

After Hall died on December 4, 1807, the brethren organized the African Grand Lodge on June 24, 1808, including the Philadelphia, Providence, and Boston lodges. African Grand Lodge declared independence from the United Grand Lodge of England and all other lodges in 1827. In 1847, they renamed Prince Hall Grand Lodge to honor their founder.

Hall was considered the &quot;father of African Freemasonry.&quot; Hall said of civic activities: 

== Community activism ==

Hall worked within the state political arena to advance the rights of blacks, end slavery, and protect free blacks from being kidnapped by slave traders. He proposed a back-to-Africa movement, pressed for equal educational opportunities, and operated a school for African Americans in his home. He engaged in public speaking and debate, citing Christian scripture against slavery to a predominantly Christian legislative body.

=== Education ===
Hall requested that the Massachusetts Congress create a school program for black children. He cited the same platform for fighting the American Revolution of &quot;Taxation without Representation.&quot; Hall and other Black Bostonians wanted a separate school to distance themselves from white supremacy and create well-educated Black citizens. Although Hall&#x27;s arguments were logical, his two attempts at passing legislation through the Massachusetts Congress both failed. Hall then started a school program for free black children out of his own home with a focus on Liberal Arts and classical education.

=== Speech and petition writing ===
Hall is known for giving speeches and writing petitions. In a speech given to the Boston African Masonic Lodge, Hall stated, &quot;My brethren, let us not be cast down under these and many other abuses we at present labour under: for the darkest is before the break of day... Let us remember what a dark day it was with our African brethren, six years ago, in the French West Indies. Nothing but the snap of the whip was heard, from morning to evening&quot;.

His 1788 petition to the Massachusetts legislature protested the abuse and kidnapping of fellow Black Boston residents and called out many atrocities faced by the community.

Hall&#x27;s notable written works include the &quot;1792 Charge&quot; and &quot;1797 Charge&quot;. Hall&#x27;s &quot;1792 Charge&quot; focused on the abolition of slavery in his home state of Massachusetts. He addressed the importance of black leaders in shaping the country and creating unity. In his &quot;1797 Charge&quot;, Hall wrote about the treatment and hostility that blacks received in the United States. He recognized black revolutionaries in the Haitian Revolution. Hall was one of several free blacks in Massachusetts who presented a petition to the legislature in 1788 protesting African-American seamen being sold into slavery.

In a speech he presented in June 1797, Hall said:
=== Back to Africa movement ===
Hall was involved in the Back-to-Africa movement and approached the legislature to request funds for voluntary emigration to Africa. In January 1773, Hall and 73 other African-American delegates presented an emigration plea to the Massachusetts Senate. This plea, which included the contentions that African Americans are better suited to Africa&#x27;s climate and lifestyle, failed. When a group of freed black men had begun a trip to Africa, they were captured and held, which reignited Hall&#x27;s interest in the movement. He found that there was not sufficient momentum and support for the Back-to-Africa movement to make it a reality at the time.

== Personal life ==
Hall joined the Congregational Church in 1762. He married an enslaved woman named Sarah Ritchie or Ritchery who died in 1769. Hall married Flora Gibbs of Gloucester, Massachusetts in 1770. David Gray states he was married for a second time to Sylvia (Zilpha) Ward Hall. An article about Hall for &quot;Africans in America&quot; by PBS states that he married a woman named Delia, a servant outside William Hall&#x27;s household, and had a son named Primus in 1756. However, in his research, Gray found no record of the marriage or son, suggesting Primus Hall was from a different family.

In Boston, Hall worked as a peddler, caterer, and leatherworker, owning a leather shop. In April 1777, he created five leather drumheads for an artillery regiment of Boston. Hall was a homeowner who voted and paid taxes.

Hall died on December 4, 1807, and is buried in Copp&#x27;s Hill Burying Ground in Boston along with other notable Bostonians from the colonial era. Thousands of other African Americans who lived in the &quot;New Guinea&quot; community at the base of Copp&#x27;s Hill are buried alongside Snowhill Street in unmarked graves.

His wife, Sylvia (Zilpha), was the executrix of his estate, which amounted to $47.22, and there was no realty.

== Monuments ==
A tribute monument to Hall was erected on Copp&#x27;s Hill on June 24, 1835, next to his grave marker. The inscription reads: &quot;Here lies ye body of Prince Hall, first Grand Master of the colored Grand Lodge in Mass. Died Dec. 7, 1807&quot;.

The Prince Hall Monument, by Ted Clausen, was erected in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

<text>In bus advertising, buses and their related infrastructure is a medium commonly used by advertisers to reach the public with their message. Usually, this takes the form of promoting commercial brands, but can also be used for public campaign messages. Buses may also be used as part of a political or promotional campaign, or as a tool in a commercial enterprise.

==History==

Bus advertising descends from similar methods used on streetcars in the early 20th century.

==Infrastructure==
Adverts are placed in bus shelters. These can be static posters, or back illuminated displays, or rolling displays allowing many messages on one shelter. Technology has also been used to create interactive adverts.

Adverts may also be installed on associated street furniture such as the backs of benches at stops. Sized at approximately 2.5 by 6.5 feet, bus bench ads tend to be cheaper per unit than other forms of outdoor mass advertising.

==Tickets==
Often, the paper bus ticket is used as an advertising space. The ticket rolls for the ticket machines are pre-printed on the rear with a particular company&#x27;s advert.

==Bus interiors==
A common location for adverts is inside the bus. Adverts are attached to the corners between the walls and ceiling overhead to catch the eye of passengers, in the same manner as used in rapid transit systems.

Increasingly, companies are using interior television systems to advertise. The most common technology is the LCD-TFT systems in different resolutions: 18.5&quot; (also side-by-side panels 18.5&quot; + 18.5&quot;), 21.5&quot; and stretched monitors in 29.4&quot;.

The LCD-TFT were originally installed to show route information to passengers (next-stop, path, maps, intersection with other routes etc.), then additional public information (messages from bus company, the Public Administration, etc.) and entertainment, which is known with the neologism infotainment. It common to use this space for both public information and advertising, providing both a public service but also a regular income for the different players involved in the public transport.

==Bus exteriors==


===Panels===
Adverts are often placed as basic rectangular motifs on the side or front of a bus. These may be applied directly to the bus. Additionally, adverts may be printed on placards known as boards, which are slotted into special guide fittings attached to the side of the bus.

===Partial and full adverts===
Occasionally, the entire surface of a bus is turned into an advertisement. This can be a whole side or rear of a bus, or a scheme applied to the entire exterior, known as an &#x27;all-over advert&#x27; bus.

A variety of formats are available to marketeers, although the most commonly used media formats are:

* T-sides
* Supersides
* Streetliners
* Rears and Mega Rears (Bus backs)
* Full Wraps

There are different options available to these formats in London because of the city&#x27;s iconic double-decker buses.

Advertisers looking to promote a message can also make use of these formats which include:

* London Gold Frame
* Route Master

Depending on the size of the bus and its location, further creative can consist of:

* Coving Panels and Bulk Heads
* Super Squares
* Upper Bus Rears

In some jurisdictions, such as Singapore, advertising agencies offer advertisements on 2D billboards which extend upwards from the bus, as well as 3D concept advertising on the roof of buses.

==Technologies==

Some panel and full side and all-over adverts were traditionally painted on if the length of application warranted it. This would require a reasonable longevity and cost implication for advertisers, due to the requirement to take buses out of service to apply and remove paint schemes. Frequently changed panel adverts would use replaceable boards.

With the advent of adhesive vinyl technologies, this allowed adverts to be rapidly applied and removed over the top of the buses exterior paint as decals, reducing the cost and time.

The invention of see-through graphics, most commonly applied as a self-adhesive perforated window film, allowed the creation of more elaborate designs that could be applied over windows (although for safety reasons not the front window), moving away from the traditional square box design approach to adverts.

With the advent of partially transparent window coverage techniques, all over adverts have been applied as a full vehicle advertising wrap windows and all. The transition from screen printing to digital printing has seen an increase in the color range and complexity of advert designs.

The latest bus advertising campaign by Adidas for the Brazil World Cup 2014 made use of full wrap and window coverage techniques. Transport for London launched the new formats as part of its ‘year of the bus’ celebrations, which commemorates the 60th anniversary of the Routemaster bus and the 100th anniversary of the first mass-produced motorbus.

==Campaign and promotion buses==
In addition to public transport buses, all-over advert buses are often privately hired specifically for a special promotional use, such as a political campaign or specific product promotions. These will often make use of open top buses to allow the interaction of the campaigners/promoters with the public.

==Legal issues==
In Norway, the use of wrap advertising on buses was prohibited by the road authorities. The reason behind the ban was that in an emergency the windows might need to serve as an emergency exit, and that the advertising would make the window harder to break with the emergency hammer. Gaia Trafikk argued against the ban, pointing out that their tests showed that the thin wrap had no impact on the breakability of the window, but did remove the advertising which covered the windows.

<doc id="797909" wikidata="Q1410469" url="?curid=797909" title="United States Indo-Pacific Command">
<text>The United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) is the unified combatant command of the United States Armed Forces responsible for the Indo-Pacific region.

It is the oldest and largest of the unified combatant commands. Its commander, the senior U.S. military officer in the Pacific, is responsible for more than 375,000 service members as well as an area that encompasses more than , or roughly 52 percent of the Earth&#x27;s surface, stretching from the waters of the West Coast of the United States to the east coast maritime borderline waters of India at the meridian 66° longitude east of Greenwich and from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Formerly known as United States Pacific Command (USPACOM), in 2018 the command was renamed to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in recognition of the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific oceans.

The Indo-Pacific Command consists of a headquarters organization, five subordinate service component commands (U.S. Army Pacific, U.S. Marine Forces Pacific, U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Pacific Air Forces, and U.S. Space Forces Indo-Pacific), three subordinate unified commands (U.S. Forces Japan, U.S. Forces Korea—which includes Special Operations Command Korea—and Special Operations Command Pacific), two direct reporting units (U.S. Pacific Command Joint Intelligence Operations Center and the Center for Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance), and two standing joint task forces (Joint Interagency Task Force West) and Joint Task Force Red Hill. The INDOPACOM headquarters is the Nimitz-MacArthur Pacific Command Center, located on Camp H. M. Smith in Hawaii.

==Mission==

United States Indo-Pacific Command protects and defends, in concert with other U.S. Government agencies, the territory of the United States, its people, and its interests. With allies and partners, we will enhance stability in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region by promoting security cooperation, encouraging peaceful development, responding to contingencies, deterring aggression, and, when necessary, fighting to win. This approach is based on partnership, presence, and military readiness.

We recognize the global significance of the Indo-Asia-Pacific region and understand that challenges are best met together. Consequently, we will remain an engaged and trusted partner committed to preserving the security, stability, and freedom upon which enduring prosperity in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region depends. We will collaborate with the Services and other Combatant Commands to defend America&#x27;s interests.

== Geographic scope ==

USINDOPACOM&#x27;s Area of Responsibility (AOR) encompasses the Pacific Ocean from Antarctica at 92°W, north to 8°N, west to 112°W, northwest to 50°N/142°W, west to 170°E, north to 53°N, northeast to 62°30&#x27;N/175°W, north to 64°45&#x27;N/175°W, south along the Russian territorial waters to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Mongolia, the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, and Japan; the countries of Southeast Asia and the southern Asian landmass to the western border of India; the Indian Ocean east and south of the line from the India coastal border west to 68°E, south along 68°E to Antarctica; Australia; New Zealand; Antarctica, and Hawaii.

In all, it encompasses:
* 36 nations
* More than half the world&#x27;s population
* 3,200 different languages
* 5 of 7 collective defense treaties

==Force structure==
===Component commands===
===Subordinate unified commands===
===Direct reporting units===
===Standing joint task force===
== Ballistic missile warning for the United States outside of NORAD: Hawaii, Guam, &amp; the Pacific region ==

In the Pacific Region, instead of NORAD, the United States Indo-Pacific Command must make the decision that an incoming ballistic missile is a threat to the United States. Hawaii is the only state in the United States with a pre-programmed Wireless Emergency Alert that can be sent quickly to wireless devices if a ballistic missile is heading toward Hawaii. If the missile is fired from North Korea, the missile would take approximately 20 minutes to reach Hawaii. The United States Indo-Pacific Command would take less than 5 minutes to make a determination that the missile could impact Hawaii and would then notify the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA). HI-EMA would issue the Civil Defense Warning (CDW) that an inbound missile could impact Hawaii and that people should Shelter-in-Place: &quot;Get Inside, Stay Inside, and Stay Tuned&quot;. People in Hawaii would have 12 to 15 minutes before impact. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is not required to be notified for approval to cancel an alert. Signal carriers allow people to block alerts from state and law enforcement agencies, but not those issued by the President. FEMA can send alerts to targeted audiences but has not implemented this as of January 2018. Other states can take as long as 30 minutes to create, enter and distribute a missile alert.
 The Wireless Emergency Alert system was tested nationally for the first time in October 2018. And as part of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, the role of issuing warnings of a missile threat would lie with the Federal Government, as opposed to individual states.

==History==
===Establishment of unified commands in the Pacific===
USINDOPACOM has evolved through the gradual consolidation of various commands in the Pacific and Far East. Its origins can be traced to the command structure established early in World War II to wage the war in the Pacific.

In April 1942, U.S. military forces in the Pacific Theatre were divided into two commands: the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) under Army General Douglas MacArthur; and the Pacific Ocean Areas (POA) under Navy Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Each had command of all U.S. military forces assigned to his area. The authority of the POA Commander-in-Chief (CINCPOA) was technically separate from that of the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC), but Admiral Nimitz was assigned to both positions and bore the title CINCPAC/CINCPOA.

Efforts to establish a unified command for the entire Pacific AOR proved impossible during the war. The divergent interests of the Army and the Navy precluded the subordination of either of the two principal commanders in the Pacific Theatre. When the war ended in September 1945, the command arrangement carried forward with Fleet Admiral Nimitz as CINCPAC/CINCPOA and General of the Army MacArthur as Commander in Chief, U.S. Army Forces Pacific (CINCAFPAC).

Command arrangements after World War II were defined by the &quot;Outline Command Plan&quot;– in a sense, the first Unified Command Plan (UCP)– approved by President Harry S. Truman on 14 December 1946 and authorized by the National Security Act of 1947. The plan called for the establishment of seven unified combatant commands as &quot;an interim measure for the immediate postwar period.&quot;

The first three unified commands were established in the Pacific. The Joint Chiefs of Staff implementing directive of 16 December 1946 established the Far East Command (FECOM), Pacific Command (PACOM), and Alaskan Command (ALCOM) effective 1 January 1947. The commands, their areas of responsibility, and their missions were as follows:

* Far East Command: U.S. forces in Japan, Korea, the Ryukyus, the Philippines, and the Mariana and Bonin Islands. The Commander-in-Chief, Far East (CINCFE) would carry out occupation duties, maintain the security of the command, plan and prepare for a general emergency in the area, support the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific (CINCPAC), and command U.S. forces in China in an emergency.
* Pacific Command: U.S. forces allocated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff within the Pacific Area. CINCPAC would defend the United States against attack through the Pacific, conduct operations in the Pacific, maintain the security of U.S. island positions and of sea and air communications, support U.S. military commitments in China, plan and prepare for a general emergency, and support CINCFE and Commander-in-Chief, Alaskan Command (CINCAL).
* Alaskan Command: U.S. forces in Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands. CINCAL would protect Alaska and its sea and air communications, defend the United States from attack through Alaska and the Arctic, plan and prepare for a general emergency, and support CINCFE, CINCPAC, and the Commanding General of the Strategic Air Command (CG SAC).

General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was appointed CINCFE; Army Major General Howard A. Craig was assigned as CINCAL. U.S. Navy Admiral John Henry Towers was designated CINCPAC. At the time of appointment, he was serving as Admiral Nimitz&#x27;s direct successor as CINCPAC/CINCPOA. Admiral Towers retained his position as Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet; his title was abbreviated CINCPACFLT to avoid confusion with the newly established Pacific Command. Headquarters for both CINCPAC and CINCPACFLT were located at Makalapa, Pearl Harbor, in the Territory of Hawaiʻi.

Then-PACOM&#x27;s original AOR ranged from Burma and the eastern Indian Ocean to the west coast of the Americas. Following a 1949 review of missions and deployments of U.S. forces, the Joint Chiefs of Staff revised the Unified Command Plan on 16 February 1950. The Volcano Islands were transferred to FECOM&#x27;s AOR; likewise, responsibility for South Korea was transferred from FECOM to PACOM. The duty of protecting the Panama Canal remained assigned to Commander in Chief, Atlantic Command (CINCLANT); one year later, however, the Western approaches to the Canal would be reassigned to CINCPAC.

===The Korean War===
The outbreak of the Korean War and subsequent developments in the Far East tested the U.S. unified command structure in the Pacific. Although General MacArthur, as CINCFE, had been relieved of responsibility for South Korea, early U.S. reaction to North Korea&#x27;s invasion of the South on 25 June 1950 came through his command. On 10 July, at the request of the United Nations, President Truman directed General MacArthur to establish the United Nations Command (UNC) for the purpose of directing operations against North Korean forces. U.S. forces assigned to FECOM were assigned to UNC with General MacArthur designated Commander-in-Chief, UNC (CINCUNC). The primary responsibility of CINCFE, however, remained the defense of Japan. During the war, CINCPAC was ordered to support CINCUNC/CINCFE.

With CINCFE focused on combat operations during the Korean War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, over strong objection from FECOM, transferred the Mariana, Bonin and Volcano Islands to PACOM. In late 1951, PACOM was also assigned responsibility for the Philippines, the Pescadores, and Formosa (Taiwan).

===Reorganization of 1956===
The new Unified Command Plan approved by Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson on 21 June 1956 produced significant changes to the command structure in the Pacific. ALCOM would remain as a unified command because of its strategic location, retaining its mission for the ground defense of the Alaskan region. Its other responsibilities, however, were reduced: the duty for the protection of sea communications in Alaskan waters was assumed by PACOM. The responsibilities of the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD) would be likewise expanded to include the air defense of Alaska and the Northeast.

UCP 1956 also disestablished FECOM as a separate unified command. U.S. military deployments to Japan and Korea were decreasing after the end of Japanese reconstruction and the Korean War. The JCS, therefore, believed that the divided command structure in the Pacific should be abolished and FECOM&#x27;s responsibility reassigned to PACOM. A subsequent outline plan to disestablish FECOM and transfer its responsibilities was approved by SECDEF and the JCS effective 1 July 1957. Under the plan, two subordinate unified commands under CINCPAC were established: Commander, U.S. Forces Japan (COMUSJAPAN) and Commander, U.S. Forces Korea (COMUSKOREA). The latter was dual-hatted as CINCUNC.

The UCP further specified that no unified commander would exercise direct command of any of its Service components or subordinate commands. As such, Admiral Felix Stump gave up direct command of the Pacific Fleet, delegating the responsibility of CINCPACFLT to his Deputy, Admiral Maurice E. Curts. CINCPAC&#x27;s staff was thereafter separated from CINCPACFLT&#x27;s staff and moved from Pearl Harbor to a new headquarters building (the former Aiea Naval Hospital) at Camp H.M. Smith. Service components for the Army and Air Force– U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC) and U.S. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF)– were also assigned to PACOM.

===The Vietnam War===
Command over U.S. forces engaged in the Vietnam War was designated by CINCPAC to three subordinate commands. U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (USMACV), activated 8 February 1962 to direct U.S. support to South Vietnam&#x27;s military forces, largely controlled all U.S. forces and operations within South Vietnam. Naval gunfire support and air strikes on targets in Vietnam, however, were delegated to PACFLT and the U.S. 7th Fleet. PACAF and PACFLT were responsible for conducting air and naval operations against North Vietnam and Laos. Control of B-52s employed to conduct airstrikes against targets in South Vietnam remained under the Strategic Air Command.

===Command adjustments, 1971–1979===
A new Unified Command Plan was approved in 1971. Effective 1 January 1972, the Pacific Command assumed responsibility for the Indian Ocean and the countries of southern Asia extending westward to the eastern border of Iran (which then fell under EUCOM&#x27;s responsibility). The Alaskan Command transferred responsibility for the Aleutian Islands and parts of the Arctic Ocean to PACOM, as well. ALCOM would remain a distinct unified command until it was disestablished by another Unified Command Plan on 1 July 1975. An amendment to this plan on 1 May 1976 adjusted PACOM&#x27;s boundaries yet again. The amendment gave CINCPAC responsibility for the entire Indian Ocean to the east coast of Africa, including the Gulfs of Aden and Oman and all of the Indian Ocean Islands excepting the Malagasy Republic. This decision expanded PACOM&#x27;s AOR across more than 50% of the Earth&#x27;s surface an area of over 100 million square miles.

U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC) was disestablished 31 December 1974 as part of a bid by the Army to reduce its headquarters. The much smaller U.S. Army CINCPAC Support Group (CSG) took over USARPAC&#x27;s duty to assist and coordinate with CINCPAC Headquarters and PACOM service components on Army matters. In 1979, U.S. Army Western Command (WESTCOM) was activated as the new Army component for PACOM. WESTCOM was redesignated USARPAC effective 30 August 1990.

===Unified Command Plan of 1983===
UCP 1983 dramatically increased the size of PACOM&#x27;s AOR. While the establishment of U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) for the Middle East on 1 January 1983 meant PACOM delegated responsibility for Afghanistan and Pakistan to the new command, it took on responsibility for China, North Korea and Madagascar as military officials reasoned that issues arising from those countries could be best handled at the unified command level.

At the request of then-CINCPAC Admiral William Crowe, his title and that of his command were changed to USCINCPAC and USPACOM, respectively.

===Boundary adjustment and Alaskan Command, 1989===
On 26 June 1989, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney endorsed the recommendation from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to reassign the Gulfs of Aden and Oman from USPACOM to USCENTCOM&#x27;s AOR. Though a modest shift, the change meant that the new boundary between the commands would no longer cut through the Strait of Hormuz. On 1 October 1989, the defense of Alaska and all units stationed there passed to USPACOM, which subsequently raised Alaskan Command (ALCOM) as a subordinate command.

===Transfers of responsibility, 2002–2006===
Under UCP 2002, effective 21 January, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld assigned Antarctica to USPACOM. Secretary Rumsfeld also approved the assignment of responsibility for Russia to EUCOM with USPACOM in a supporting role for the Siberia and Russian Far East. Later reassignments under the 2004 and 2006 plans placed the entire Seychelles Archipelago in the USCENTCOM&#x27;s AOR and extended U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM)&#x27;s boundary westward to encompass all of the Aleutian Islands, respectively.

On 24 October 2002, the Secretary issued a memorandum declaring that the title &quot;Commander in Chief&quot; should only refer to the President of the United States. Effective that date, all combatant commanders deleted &quot;in Chief&quot; from their titles. USCINCPAC was redesignated Commander, U.S. Pacific Command (CDRUSPACOM).

===Transfer of Alaskan Command, 2014===
In a move to streamline command and control of forces in Alaska and integrate forces in defense of North America, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel approved the transfer of ALCOM to USNORTHCOM on 1 October 2014.

===Renaming of Pacific Command, 2018===
On 30 May 2018, at the change-of-command ceremony between Admirals Harry B. Harris Jr. and Philip S. Davidson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced that Pacific Command has been renamed Indo-Pacific Command &quot;in recognition of the increasing connectivity of the Indian and Pacific Oceans.&quot; U.S. officials stated that the change was instituted to &quot;better reflect the command&#x27;s areas of responsibility, which includes 36 nations as well as both the Pacific and Indian Oceans.&quot;

== List of commanders ==
While any qualified officer in the U.S. Armed Forces can be appointed as commander of INDOPACOM, only a Navy officer has ever held this office.

<text>Volsinii or Vulsinii (Etruscan: Velzna or Velusna; Greek: Ouolsinioi, ; ), is the name of two ancient cities of Etruria, one situated on the shore of Lacus Volsiniensis (modern Lago di Bolsena), and the other on the Via Clodia, between Clusium (Chiusi) and Forum Cassii (Vetralla). The latter was Etruscan and was destroyed by the Romans in 264 BC following an attempted revolt by its slaves, while the former was founded by the Romans using the remainder of the Etruscan population rescued from the razed city.

Modern Bolsena, Italy, in the region of Lazio, descends from the Roman city. The location of the Etruscan city is debated. Umbrian Orvieto, about from Bolsena, is a strong candidate.

==Situation==

The Byzantine historian Joannes Zonaras states that the Etruscan Volsinii (Velzna or Velusna) lay on a steep height; while Bolsena, the representative of the Roman Volsinii, is situated in the plain. Scholars of the 19th century debated the location of this elevated site. Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken looked for it at Montefiascone, at the southern extremity of the lake; while Karl Otfried Müller believed it was at Orvieto, and adduced the name of that place in Latin, &quot;Urbs Vetus&quot;, the old city, as an argument in favour of his view; but British explorer and writer George Dennis was of the opinion that there was no reason to believe that it was so far from the Roman city, and that it lay on the summit of the hill, above the amphitheater at Bolsena, at a spot called &quot;Il Piazzano&quot;. He adduced in support of this hypothesis the existence of a good deal of broken pottery there, and of a few caves in the cliffs below. Bolsena is from Montefiascone, and from Orvieto.

===Fanum Voltumnae===
Fanum Voltumnae was the chief sanctuary of the Etruscans. Numerous sources refer to a league of the &quot;Twelve Peoples&quot; of Etruria, which met annually at the Fanum, possibly for the purpose of electing priests.
The exact location of this shrine is still unknown, though it may have been in an area near modern Orvieto, believed by many to be the ancient Volsinii. Professor Simonetta Stopponi of the University of Macerata, an Etruscologist, has been excavating at Orvieto since 2000. She believes that Fanum was located at this site.

An Etruscan substructure, datable to the 6th-4th centuries BC, has been uncovered.
&quot;Most impressive was the excavation of a round fountain area, on a slight rise above and overlooking the temples, whose decorations included the head of a lion. According to Stopponi, ‘This would have been the sacred spring.’&quot;
==History==

===Volsinii veteres===
Etruscan Volsinii (Velzna or Velusna; or sometimes in Latin &quot;Volsinii Veteres&quot; – Old Volsinii) appears to have been one of the most powerful cities of Etruria, the cult centre of the god Voltumna, and was doubtless one of the 12 which formed the Etruscan confederation, as Volsinii is designated by Livy and Valerius Maximus as one of the &quot;capita Etruriae&quot; (&quot;heads of Etruria&quot;). It is described by Juvenal as seated among well-wooded hills.

Volsinii first appears in history after the fall of Veii (396 BC). The Volsinienses, in conjunction with the Salpinates, taking advantage of a famine and pestilence which had desolated Rome, made incursions into the Roman territory in 391 BC. They were defeated, and 8,000 of them were taken prisoner. However, they purchased a twenty-year truce in exchange for returning the booty they had taken, and furnishing the pay of the Roman army for a year.

They appear next in 310 BC, when, in common with the rest of the Etruscan cities, except Arretium (modern Arezzo), they took part in the siege of Sutrium (modern Sutri), a city in alliance with Rome. This war was terminated by the defeat of the Etruscans at the First Battle of Lake Vadimo (310 BC), a major blow to their power. Three years afterwards the consul Publius Decius Mus captured several of the Volsinian fortresses. In 295 BC, Lucius Postumius Megellus ravaged their territory and defeated them under the walls of their own city, slaying 2,800 of them. Consequently they, together with Perusia (modern Perugia) and Arretium, purchased a forty-year peace by paying a heavy fine.

Not more than fourteen years, however, had elapsed, when, with their allies the Vulcientes, they again took up arms against Rome. But this attempt ended in their final subjugation in 280 BC. Pliny tells an absurd story, taken from the Greek writer Metrodorus of Scepsis, that the object of the Romans in capturing Volsinii was to make themselves masters of 2,000 statues which it contained. The story, however, suffices to show that the Volsinians had attained great wealth, luxury, and art. This is confirmed by Valerius Maximus, who also adds that this luxury was the cause of their ruin, by making them so indolent that they at length allowed the administration of their commonwealth to be usurped by slaves.

The attempted revolution apparently began with the admission of freedmen into the army, which must have been in 280 BC. They became a powerful plebeian class, who were subsequently allowed to become members of the Senate and to hold public office. They seem to have acquired majorities, using them to shape the law. Other slaves were set free; they gave themselves all the privileges formerly reserved for the Etruscans, such as rights of intermarriage and inheritance, and aggressively insisted on them against the will of the Etruscan patrician class. There were complaints of rape and robbery.

In 265 BC, when the revolutionary party began to pass laws limiting patrician political activity, the lucumones sent a clandestine embassy to Rome asking for military assistance. On their return they were executed for treason, but shortly afterwards a Roman army arrived to lay siege to the town. The subsequent conflict was intense; the consul and commanding general, Quintus Fabius Gurges, was a casualty. A year later his successor, Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, receiving the surrender of the town through its starvation, razed it and executed the leaders of the plebeian party. The first display of gladiators at Rome in 264 is believed to have featured now captive freedmen from Volsinii. The Romans rescued and restored to power the remaining Etruscans of Volsinii, but decided it was necessary to remove them from that location to a new city on the shores of Lake Bolsena. The new city had none of the natural defenses of the old one and was not in any way sovereign. The portable wealth from the old city was carried off to Rome.

===Volsinii novi===
The Romans, when they took Volsinii, razed the town, and compelled the inhabitants to migrate to another spot. (Zonaras, &quot;l. c.&quot;) This second, or Roman, Volsinii (sometimes called &quot;Volsinii Novi&quot; – New Volsinii) continued to exist under the Empire. It was the birthplace of Sejanus, the minister and favorite of Tiberius. Juvenal (x. 74) alludes to this circumstance when he considers the fortunes of Sejanus as dependent on the favor of Nursia, or Norsia, an Etruscan goddess much worshipped at Volsinii, into whose temple there, as in that of Jupiter Capitolinus at Rome, a nail was annually driven to mark the years. According to Pliny, Volsinii was the scene of some supernatural occurrences. He records that lightning was drawn down from heaven by king Porsenna to destroy a monster called Volta that was ravaging its territory. Even the commonplace invention of hand-mills, ascribed to this city, is embellished with the traditional prodigy that some of them turned by themselves.

==Remains==

No definite traces of the Etruscan Volsinii have been identified. Of the Roman city, some remains are still extant at Bolsena. The most remarkable are those of a temple near the Florence gate, commonly called the &quot;Tempio di Norsia&quot;. But the remains are of Roman work; and the real temple of that goddess most probably stood in the Etruscan city. The amphitheater is small and a complete ruin. Besides these there are the remains of some baths, sepulchral tablets, and a sarcophagus with reliefs representing the triumph of Bacchus. The Monti Volsini mountain range in northern Lazio takes its name from the ancient city.

==Coinage==
Volsinii minted coins in antiquity. A full discussion of the coins of Volsinii may be found in Müller, &quot;Etrusker&quot;, vol. i. pp. 324, 333.

<text>Joseph Schlitz (May 15, 1831 – May 7, 1875) was a German-American entrepreneur who made his fortune in the brewing industry.

==Biography==

Joseph Schlitz was born on May 15, 1831, in Mainz, Hesse-Darmstadt. He immigrated to the U.S. in 1850.

In 1856, he assumed management of the Krug Brewery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1858, when he married George August Krug&#x27;s widow, Anna Maria Krug, he changed the name of the company to the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company. He became more successful after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Many of Chicago&#x27;s breweries that had burned never reopened. Schlitz established a distribution point there and acquired a large part of the Chicago market.

Schlitz was a Freemason and was affiliated with Aurora Lodge No. 30.

Schlitz perished with 334 others in the wreck of the SS &quot;Schiller&quot; in thick fog off the Isles of Scilly on May 7, 1875. The islands lie west of Cornwall, England. He was returning via New York City and Hamburg, visiting Germany. Aged 43, his body was never recovered. A cenotaph at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee honors him.

<text>The Noric language, or Eastern Celtic, was an unclassified Continental Celtic language. It is attested in only two fragmentary inscriptions from the Roman province of Noricum (one in Grafenstein, Carinthia, Austria, the other in Ptuj, Slovenia). These do not provide enough information to draw conclusions about the language. However, it was probably similar to other Celtic languages near to it, such as Gaulish. No evidence yet shows when it became extinct.

== Ptuj inscription ==

The Ptuj inscription, discovered in 1894, is written right to left in a northern Italic alphabet and reads:

This is interpreted as two personal names: [son] of . The name may mean &quot;bear penis&quot; (compare Welsh &quot;bear&quot; and Irish &quot;penis&quot;), while may contain the element &quot;brog-, mrog-&quot; &quot;country&quot; (compare Welsh &quot;region, country&quot;). Alternatively, the inscription may be interpreted as [made this] for , with the second name in the dative case.

== Grafenstein inscription ==

The Grafenstein inscription, on a tile from the 2nd century AD that was discovered in a gravel pit in 1977, is incomplete, but the extant part has been transcribed as follows:
Here, seems to be a personal name or an abbreviation of one, a Latin abbreviation indicating a weight, a verbal form possibly meaning &quot;you (singular) do not set&quot;, perhaps &quot;this amount&quot;, and another personal name. The text may therefore be a record of some sort of financial transaction.

Other readings of the inscription have also been proposed, including:

<doc id="797951" wikidata="Q3224836" url="?curid=797951" title="The Black Sheep (1992 film)">
<text>The Black Sheep () is a Quebec documentary produced in 1992 by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). Jacques Godbout directed and starred in the film. Its style belongs to the Quebec cinéma vérité school of filmmaking.

==Synopsis==

It chronicles the immediate of the fall, in 1990, of the Meech Lake Accord, and its effects on the Quebec society and Quebec nationalism. It is set during the Bélanger-Campeau commission (a public hearing to determine the way to choose for Quebec regarding its autonomy), before the Parti Libéral du Québec (in power, traditionally in favor of autonomy within Canada and co-initiator of the Accord with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada) formally closed the door to independence in the light of the death of &quot;Meech Lake&quot; and the departure of some Liberal nationalists to create the ADQ. The title means &quot;The Black Sheep&quot;, referring to Quebec and its difference coupled with a perceived ostracism by Canada, notably through its rejection of the Accord that would have recognized this difference.

==Protagonists==

The film is focused not only on the reaction of the Quebec people as a whole but also on individuals and their experiences right in the middle of the Meech Lake aftermath. The main protagonists are five young politicians later to leave their mark on Quebec society: Michel Bissonnette, Denis Coderre, Mario Dumont, Joseph Facal, and Jean-François Simard. Their destinies are all altered and shaped by the historical event (for example: Simard becomes a sovereigntist and will leave the Liberal Party for the Parti Québécois; Dumont will also slam the Liberal door to later help create and finally become leader of the Action démocratique du Québec, or ADQ, and support the Yes side of the 1995 referendum on independence).

It also features many other Quebec public figures, notably political scientist Daniel Latouche (a past senior adviser to René Lévesque), then Premier Robert Bourassa, sovereigntist and aspirant to Bourassa&#x27;s &quot;throne&quot; Jacques Parizeau, and fellow filmmaker Denys Arcand. Bourassa speaks of the Accord, his related famous speech in the National Assembly of Quebec and the cancer that would soon bring him to his demise. Arcand gives his point of view on the similarities between the moment in question and another important event in Quebec nationalism and independentism, the 1980 referendum. The fall of the Accord indeed led to the second referendum on independence. He is himself the director of &quot;Le confort et l&#x27;indifférence&quot;, a similar analytic film about the 1980 plebiscite, and is brought into &quot;Le Mouton Noir&quot; especially for that reason.

==Production==
Like other documentaries of his (&quot;Traître ou Patriote&quot;, for example), &quot;Le Mouton noir&quot; showcases Godbout&#x27;s own style of putting himself into the narrative thread by setting up scenes where he researches his subject and interacts with others, to help push the documentary forward. Godbout provides his own voice for the voice-overs of the English version.

==Sequel==
In 2003, a sequel was brought to theaters called &quot;Les héritiers du mouton noir&quot;. It catches up with the five young politicians the first part centred on.

<text>Charlotte &quot;Lotte&quot; Pauline Sophie Lehmann (February 27, 1888 – August 26, 1976) was a German-American dramatic soprano noted for her successful performances with international opera houses, on the recital stage and in teaching.She gave memorable appearances in the operas of Richard Strauss, Richard Wagner, Ludwig van Beethoven, Puccini, Mozart, and Massenet. The Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, Sieglinde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; and the title-role in &quot;Fidelio&quot; are considered her greatest roles. During her long career, Lehmann also made almost five hundred recordings in both opera and art song.

==Life and career==

Lehmann was born in Perleberg, a middle-sized town about halfway between Hamburg and Berlin, in the Province of Brandenburg, Germany.
She studied, unsuccessfully, at two music schools in Berlin, (where her family had moved), before finding Mathilde Mallinger (Wagner’s first Eva in &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;) who within a year and a half developed Lehmann’s voice to the level at which she could audition for and achieve a beginner’s contract with the Hamburg Opera in 1910. At that time she sang roles of pages and other minor roles. By her third year in Hamburg Lehmann was singing important roles such as Agathe in &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; and Micaëla in &quot;Carmen&quot;. Her big break came when the absence of the soprano scheduled to sing Elsa in &quot;Lohengrin&quot; allowed Lehmann her first acknowledged success. She was coached in the role by the young assistant conductor at the Hamburg Opera, Otto Klemperer. Thereafter she further sang larger roles such as Irene in &quot;Rienzi&quot;, Antonia in &quot;Les contes d’Hoffmann&quot;, Dorabella in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; and Gutrune in &quot;Götterdämmerung.&quot; In 1913, Hans Gregor, the director of the Vienna Court Opera, came to Hamburg to hear a tenor, but noticed Lehmann as Micäela and offered her a contract. 

Lehmann began her Vienna career with a trial appearance in 1914 as Eva in &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; at the Vienna Court Opera – the later Vienna State Opera – which she joined in 1916. She quickly established herself as one of the company&#x27;s brightest stars in roles such as Elisabeth in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and Elsa in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;.

She created roles in the world premieres of a number of operas by Richard Strauss, including the Composer in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; in 1916 (later she sang the title-role in this opera), the Dyer&#x27;s Wife in &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot; in 1919 and Christine in &quot;Intermezzo&quot; in 1924. Her other Strauss roles were the title-roles in &quot;Arabella&quot; (she sang in the Viennese premiere on 21 October 1933, even though her mother had died earlier that day) and in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; (earlier in her career, she had also sung the role of Sophie and Octavian; when she finally added the Marschallin to her repertoire, she became the first soprano in history to have sung all three female lead roles in that opera). 

Her Puccini roles at the Vienna State Opera included the title-roles in &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Suor Angelica&quot;, &quot;Turandot&quot;, Mimi in &quot;La bohème&quot; and Giorgetta in &quot;Il tabarro&quot;. In her 21 years with the company, Lehmann sang more than fifty different roles, including Marie/Marietta in Korngold&#x27;s &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot;, the title-roles in &quot;La Juive&quot; by Fromental Halévy, &quot;Mignon&quot; by Ambroise Thomas, and &quot;Manon&quot; by Jules Massenet, Charlotte in &quot;Werther&quot;, Marguerite in &quot;Faust&quot;, Tatiana in &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; and Lisa in &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;. 

In the meantime she had made her debut in London in 1914, sung on tour in South America in 1922, and from 1924 to 1935 performed regularly at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden where aside from her famous Wagner roles and the Marschallin she also sang Desdemona in &quot;Otello&quot; and Donna Elvira in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. She appeared regularly at the Salzburg Festival from 1926 to 1937, performing with Arturo Toscanini, among other conductors. She also gave recitals there accompanied at the piano by the conductor Bruno Walter. 

In August 1936, while in Salzburg, she discovered the Trapp Family Singers, later made more famous in the musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Lehmann had heard of a villa available for let and as she approached the villa she overheard the family singing in their garden. Insisting the children had a precious gift, she exclaimed that the family had &quot;gold in their throats&quot; and that they should enter the Salzburg Festival contest for group singing the following night. Having regard to the family&#x27;s aristocratic background the Baron insisted performing in public was out of the question; however Lehmann&#x27;s fame and genuine enthusiasm persuaded the Baron to relent, leading to their first public performance.
In 1930, Lehmann made her American debut in Chicago as Sieglinde in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. She returned to the United States every season thereafter making her Metropolitan Opera debut as Sieglinde in 1934. Before Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Lehmann emigrated to the United States. There, she continued to sing at the Metropolitan Opera until 1945 and the San Francisco Opera until 1946.

In addition to her operatic work, Lehmann was a renowned singer of lieder, giving frequent recitals throughout her career. She recorded and toured with pianist Ernő Balogh in the 1930s. Beginning with her first recital tour to Australia in 1937, she worked closely with the accompanist Paul Ulanowsky. He remained her primary accompanist for concerts and master classes until her retirement fourteen years later.

She also made a foray into film acting, playing the mother of Danny Thomas in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Big City&quot; (1948), which also starred Robert Preston, George Murphy, Margaret O&#x27;Brien and Betty Garrett.

After her retirement from the recital stage in 1951, Lehmann taught master classes at the Music Academy of the West in Montecito, California, which she helped found in 1947. She also gave master classes in New York City&#x27;s Town Hall (for the Manhattan School of Music), Chicago, London, Vienna, and other cities. Some of her most successful students included: Jeannine Altmeyer, Judith Beckmann, Grace Bumbry, William Cochran, Marilyn Horne, Mildred Miller, Norman Mittelman, Carol Neblett, William Olvis, and Benita Valente. For her contribution to the recording industry, Lehmann has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1735 Vine St. However, her first name is misspelled there as &quot;Lottie.&quot;

She was a prolific author, publishing a book of poems &quot;Verse in Prosa&quot; in 1923, a novel, &quot;Orplid, mein Land&quot; in 1937, which appeared in English as &quot;Eternal Flight&quot;, and a book of memoirs, &quot;Anfang und Aufstieg&quot; (1937), which later appeared as &quot;On Wings of Song&quot; in the U.K. in 1938 and as &quot;Midway in My Song&quot; in the U.S. She also published &quot;More than Singing&quot; (1945), on the interpretation of song, and &quot;My Many Lives&quot; (1948), on the interpretation of opera roles. Later books included &quot;Five Operas and Richard Strauss&quot;, known as &quot;Singing with Richard Strauss&quot; in the U.K., a second book of poems in 1969, and &quot;Eighteen Song Cycles&quot; in 1971, consisting of material drawn largely from earlier works.

Lehmann was an active painter, especially in her retirement. Her painting included a series of twenty-four illustrations in tempera for each song of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot;.

Lehmann died in 1976 at the age of 88 in Santa Barbara, California. She is interred in the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna. Her headstone is inscribed with a quote from Richard Strauss: &quot;&quot; (&quot;She sang such that it moved the stars.&quot;)

==Personal life==
In 1926 Lehmann married Otto Krause, a former officer in the Austrian army. They had no children. Krause, who died of tuberculosis in 1939, had four children from a previous marriage. Lehmann never remarried. 

After Krause&#x27;s death until her own death in 1976 Lehmann shared a home with Frances Holden (1899–1996), a psychologist who specialised in the study of genius, particularly that of classical musicians. The two women named their Santa Barbara house &quot;Orplid&quot; after the dream island described in Hugo Wolf&#x27;s art song &quot;Gesang Weylas&quot;.

She held a long correspondence with numismatist Dorothy B. Waage.

<doc id="797963" wikidata="Q4569896" url="?curid=797963" title="Rolling Rock">
<text>Rolling Rock is a 4.4% abv American lager launched in 1939 by the Latrobe Brewing Company. Although founded as a local beer in Western Pennsylvania, it was marketed aggressively and eventually became a national product. The brand was sold to Anheuser-Busch of St. Louis, in mid-2006, which transferred brewing operations to New Jersey while continuing to label the new beer prominently with the name of Latrobe.

==History==
From 1939 until July 26, 2006, Rolling Rock was brewed at the Latrobe Brewing Company in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, a small city 34 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As stated on the bottle, it was brewed with a distinctive soft local water in large glass-lined tanks, which were considered state-of-the-art at the time of its introduction (in part due to sanitation concerns).

On May 19, 2006, Anheuser-Busch purchased the Rolling Rock and Rolling Rock Green Light brands from InBev for $82 million and began brewing Rolling Rock at its Newark facility in mid July, 2006. The final batch of Rolling Rock was shipped from Latrobe on July 31, 2006. Union leaders in Westmoreland County organized a nationwide boycott of Anheuser-Busch and InBev brands because of the move. Anheuser-Busch has said that Rolling Rock&#x27;s original pledge on the label will be preceded by these words: &quot;To honor the tradition of this great brand, we quote from the original pledge of quality.&quot; In July 2008, InBev reached a deal to acquire Anheuser-Busch, thereby returning ownership of Rolling Rock to InBev, now known as Anheuser–Busch InBev and based in Belgium.

In 2009, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced that it was exploring the sale of the Rolling Rock brand. In 2015, Anheuser-Busch stopped brewing bottled Rolling Rock in glass-lined tanks. Only the canned beer was now being brewed using the traditional process.

==Pony bottle==
Rolling Rock&#x27;s pony bottle had been very popular until its discontinuation, so much so that this had given rise to the folk etymology that &quot;pony&quot; is from the Rolling Rock horse logo. This is incorrect: the term &quot;&quot; in &quot;pony of beer&quot; has been used in the United States of America since the 19th century, predating Rolling Rock by over 50 years, and is due to the diminutive size; similar words include pony glass and pony keg. Indeed, advertising for Rolling Rock since the 1950s uses the term &quot;pony bottle&quot; generically, stating &quot;... Rolling Rock is the Largest Selling 7 oz. Pony Bottle of premium beer in Pennsylvania&quot;.

Though it did not originate the term, the popularity of Rolling Rock doubtless reinforced it: one could refer to a regular (12 oz.) or small (7 oz.) of the beer as a &quot;horse&quot; or &quot;pony&quot; respectively. It also likely led to the standardization on a 7 oz. size: major national brands introduced 7 oz. pony bottles in the early 1970s, of which the most prominent is Miller High Life (pony introduced 1972).

==Number 33==
The number 33 is printed prominently on all bottles of Rolling Rock. Many have speculated on the significance of the number 33: that the &quot;33&quot; refers to 1933, the founding year of the Pittsburgh Steelers (who hold their annual training camp at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, PA); that 33 degrees Fahrenheit is the proper temperature to keep beer; the 33 degrees of Scottish Rite Freemasonry; that Latrobe test-brewed 33 batches of beer before coming up with the final formula for Rolling Rock. Other theories concerning the number 33 are that there were exactly 33 stairsteps from the brewmaster&#x27;s office to the brewing floor in the original Latrobe brewery. Also that the Pennsylvania fish and game commission at the turn of the century numbered the streams within the commonwealth and the water that was used to brew this beer was taken from the stream numbered 33.

The words &quot;Rolling Rock&quot; appear three times on the bottle for a total of 33 letters.

One widely held belief is that it marks the repeal of prohibition in 1933.

James L. Tito, former CEO of Latrobe Brewing, opined that the &quot;33&quot; signifies the 33 words in the beer&#x27;s original pledge of quality, which is still printed on every bottle:

While the original wording on the label was somewhat different, it also contained the 33 following words:

This was followed by the &quot;33&quot;. The current pledge is on the 12 oz. bottles, while the &quot;little nip&quot; pledge is from the 7 oz. bottle version. The 7 oz. bottles were referred in some parts of Pennsylvania as “nippers”, and a popular mode of packaging was in cases of 24, with a perforation so the case could be split in two, or a dozen each. 

A founding executive is said to have written &quot;33&quot; at the end of the slogan to indicate the number of words it comprised as a guide for the bottle printers. They assumed it was part of the text and incorporated it into the label graphics. Hence, the first batch of bottles carried the number &quot;33&quot; and they remained that way since they were continually collected and reused.

Tito admitted, however, that there is no hard proof for this theory, and that at this point no one really knows what the true origin of the &quot;33&quot; may have been. Nonetheless, the tradition of the printing explanation has been sustained by the company as the wording on the labels has changed over the years, and the verbiage is carefully structured to retain a length of 33 words. The Rolling Rock nomenclature on the bottles was painted on, not paper or plastic.

==Rolling Rock Red==

Anheuser-Busch introduced a red lager version of Rolling Rock called Rolling Rock Red. While the number 33 has been a traditional part of Rolling Rock iconography, Rolling Rock Red&#x27;s label has a &quot;3&quot;, presumably signifying the name of the beverage (&quot;Rolling Rock Red&quot;) or the words in the tagline &quot;Finely Crafted Lager&quot;, which appears only on the Rolling Rock Red bottles. 

==In media==
Rolling Rock is a significant symbol in internet celebrity James Rolfe&#x27;s series &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd&quot;, where his character, the Nerd, takes a sip from a bottle of the drink to calm himself down when getting angry at bad games.

Rolling Rock also appeared occasionally on episodes of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, which was based in New Jersey.

In the 1978 film &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, Robert De Niro’s character (Michael) offers Meryl Streep&#x27;s character (Linda) a Rolling Rock.

Rolling Rock is prominently featured in the 1986 film &quot;At Close Range&quot;, which takes place in rural Pennsylvania.

Red Forman is occasionally shown drinking Rolling Rock during dinner scenes in &quot;That 70&#x27;s Show&quot;.

Rolling Rock is also featured in the movie &quot;That’s My Boy&quot;, which has the father of the main character double fisting bottles of the ‘rock.

Rolling Rock is featured as the beer that the main character, Jonathan Banks, drinks in the movie &quot;Side Effects&quot;.

Rolling Rock is shown as the beer of choice for Kate Winslet’s character and others in the series Mare of Easttown which is set in suburban Philadelphia.

Rolling Rock is shown as the beer of choice for the technicians Stan and Patrick in the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, while performing the memory erasing of Joel.

<doc id="797966" wikidata="Q126285699" url="?curid=797966" title="Life zone">
<text>The life zone concept was developed by C. Hart Merriam in 1889 as a means of describing areas with similar plant and animal communities. Merriam observed that the changes in these communities with an increase in latitude at a constant elevation are similar to the changes seen with an increase in elevation at a constant latitude.

== Merriam ==
The life zones Merriam identified are most applicable to western North America, being developed on the San Francisco Peaks, Arizona and Cascade Range of the northwestern USA. He tried to develop a system that is applicable across the North American continent, but that system is rarely referred to.

=== List ===
The life zones that Merriam identified, along with characteristic plants, are as follows:
* Lower Sonoran (low, hot desert): creosote bush, Joshua tree
* Upper Sonoran (desert steppe or chaparral): sagebrush, scrub oak, Colorado pinyon, Utah juniper
* Transition (open woodlands): ponderosa pine
* Canadian (fir forest): Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, quaking aspen
* Hudsonian (spruce forest): Engelmann spruce, Rocky Mountains bristlecone pine
* Arctic-Alpine (alpine meadows or tundra): lichen, grass

The Canadian and Hudsonian life zones are commonly combined into a Boreal life zone.

=== Criticism ===
This system has been criticized as being too imprecise. For example, the scrub oak chaparral in Arizona shares relatively few plant and animal species with the Great Basin sagebrush desert, yet both are classified as Upper Sonoran. However it is still sometimes referred to by biologists (and anthropologists) working in the western United States. Much more detailed and empirically based classifications of vegetation and life zones now exist for most areas of the world, such as the list of world ecoregions defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature, or the list of North American ecoregions defined by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation.

== Holdridge ==
In 1947, Leslie Holdridge published a life zone classification using indicators of:
* mean annual biotemperature (logarithmic)
* annual precipitation (logarithmic)
* ratio of annual potential evapotranspiration to mean total annual precipitation.

Biotemperature refers to all temperatures above freezing, with all temperatures below freezing adjusted to 0 °C, as plants are dormant at these temperatures. Holdridge&#x27;s system uses biotemperature first, rather than the temperate latitude bias of Merriam&#x27;s life zones, and does not primarily use elevation. The system is considered more appropriate to the complexities of tropical vegetation than Merriam&#x27;s system.

<text>The Scotland Men&#x27;s International Roll of Honour is a list established by the Scottish Football Association recognising players who have gained 50 or more international caps for Scotland. The roll of honour was launched in February 1988, when 11 players had already achieved the distinction. Each player inducted receives a commemorative gold medal, an invitation to every Scotland home match and has their portrait hung in the Scottish Football Museum.

, there are 39 players on the roll of honour. Ryan Christie and Scott McTominay are the most recent additions, having both won their 50th cap on 14 June 2024 against Germany.

In July 2017, the SFA launched the Women&#x27;s International Roll of Honour, which recognises players who have won 100 or more caps for Scotland women&#x27;s national football team. The women&#x27;s roll of honour initially included 12 players.

<text>Money belts are belts with secret compartments, often worn by tourists. One form of money belt is a belt with a pouch attached to the front which is worn under a shirt to protect valuables from thieves and pickpockets. 

Another form appears to be an ordinary belt when worn, but contains one or more hidden pockets on the inside, typically closed with a zipper. 
Items typically placed in a money belt generally include such things as a passport, travel tickets, driver&#x27;s license, credit cards, cash, and jewellery. A significant problem is that scammers, pickpockets, beggars, and the like, know that the presence of a money belt brings a high likelihood of the bearer being a tourist, and therefore a high-value target, bringing more attention upon the wearer than desirable.

<text>Rolemaster: Magestorm (since 2001, Magestorm Millennium) was an online-only first-person shooter using magical spells as weapons. It was developed in 1996 by Interworld Productions (later known as Mythic Entertainment).

==Gameplay==
It centered on team-based gameplay and included some role-playing video game elements, notably the character class and level-based systems. The four character classes were the Wizard, Psionic, and Healer; but prior to &quot;Magestorm Millennium&quot;, the character classes were named as Magician, Mentalist, Arcanist and Cleric, respectively. A character could gain experience points by hitting other players and raise up to level 30. Each gained level gave spell picks which allowed to unlock new spells.

==Development==
&quot;Rolemaster&quot; returned to computer games in the 1990s when Mythic Entertainment released three games that used the &quot;Rolemaster&quot; system: &quot;Rolemaster: Magestorm&quot; (1996), &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; (1997), and &quot;&quot; (1997). They also published a &quot;Silent Death&quot; computer game (1999).

==Availability==
The game was a feature of various gaming services over the years. Firstly as part of the Engage Games Online service, before moving to AOL. For a time, there was choice between the hourly billing method of AOL&#x27;s game service versus the flat monthly charge offered by rival service Gamestorm. The game was also briefly available via the Gamezone network in Europe.
Magestorm is currently available to play at https://gamemodi.net/#magestorm.

When Electronic Arts purchased both the AOL Games Channel and Gamestorm, the game was shut down almost immediately in 2000. As compensation, players of the game were given free copies of Ultima Online. The game however was relaunched as Magestorm Millennium in 2001, on the Mythic-Realms game service, operated by Mythic Entertainment itself. It brought together the former two communities of AOL and Gamestorm and was one of the most popular games on the service, surpassing its spiritual successor, , developed in 1999.

The official server run by Mythic Entertainment is no longer available and was retired in January 2006, along with all other games offered on the Mythic-Realms gaming center excluding &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Gate&quot;.

An unofficial server emulator, Magestorm Revival, began development in 2009. It has been dropped.

Another unofficial server emulator, Magestorm on Gamemodi, has been open and available for play since 2017.

<doc id="797990" wikidata="Q3276729" url="?curid=797990" title="Traitor or Patriot">
<text>Traitor or Patriot () is a Quebec documentary produced by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in 2000. It is directed by and starring Jacques Godbout. Its style belongs to the Quebec cinéma direct school of filmmaking.

==Synopsis==

It analyzes the place of Quebec Premier Adélard Godbout in history. Godbout is not well-considered by Quebec historians and citizens. Adérald Godbout was the Second World War–era Quebec head of government, and the great-uncle of the director. Godbout advances some theories to explain why his great-uncle was forgotten in the collective memory of the Quebecers. One theory is that Adélard Godbout was more favourable than other political leaders to conscription. Quebec nationalists, at the time, opposed conscription, which they saw as a British imperialist manoeuvre of English Canada to defend the Empire.

==Production==
Like other documentaries of his (&quot;The Black Sheep&quot;, for example), &quot;Traître ou Patriote&quot; showcases Jacques Godbout&#x27;s own style of putting himself into the narrative thread: he sets up scenes where he researches his subject and interacts with others, to help push the documentary forward. One example of this is when he is filmed asking historians at a reception if they can recognize the picture of Godbout, the politician, which they cannot. Jacques Godbout provides his own voice for the voice-overs of the English version.

<text>is a Japanese &quot;shōjo&quot; manga written by Yuu Watase. It appeared as a serial in the manga magazine &quot;Shōjo Comic&quot;.

The heroine&#x27;s name (Alice), and her encounter with a white rabbit (Nyozeka) starts the storyline. Watase has written that she thought of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, by Lewis Carroll, in drafting the characters of Alice Seno and Nyozeka. From there she drafted her own story.

From 2007 Viz Media released &quot;Alice 19th&quot; in English. The series, which is published in the traditional right-to-left format with foot-noted sound effects, spans a total of seven volumes.

==Plot==
The story follows Alice Seno, a fifteen-year-old girl forever in the shadow of her older sister Mayura, who excels in everything she undertakes. At her school Alice becomes known as &quot;Mayura&#x27;s little sister.&quot; Older girls, judging Alice too meek to retaliate, torment her relentlessly.

Alice harbors a deep affection for Kyou Wakamiya, a handsome senpai and member – with Mayura – of the school archery team. On the way to school one day, Alice rescues a white rabbit from the road despite the danger to herself, but she is rescued by Kyô and receives from the rabbit a bracelet with a single red stone. The rabbit she saves, however, is no ordinary rabbit. The rabbit reveals her true form to Alice and introduces herself as Nyozeka. Alice is told that she is destined to become a Lotis Master. The Lotis Masters use the power of words and communication to enter the Inner Heart of others. It is a powerful ability to be used carefully as Alice soon finds out.

Using the power of the Lotis Words, which reveal themselves to be in the form of runes, Alice accidentally makes her older sister disappear during a dispute over Kyô, whom Mayura had begun dating. Alice then must use the Lotis Words to try to bring her sister back from the dark. She is joined by Kyô who proves to have the Lotis powers as well, and by Frey, another Lotis master who has trained with the masters and arrives with the intention to marry Alice. Unfortunately, Mayura has been taken by the power of the Maram Words, the dark reflection of the Lotus Words. Their only hope lies in Alice and Kyô becoming the legendary Neo-Masters to discover the lost word binding both Maram and Lotis.

Following the conclusion of the story in volume 7 Ms. Watase appended an extra chapter, &#x27;Bunny Heart&#x27;, set in China about 900 AD. A young Chinese girl, Rakuen, retrieving water during a time of drought, met Nyozeka, and learned the Lotis word &quot;Dana&quot;, water. Ms. Watase concludes the chapter by writing that this girl was an ancestor of Pai Mei-Lin.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
:Fifteen-year-old Alice becomes a Lotis Master when she saves Nyozeka from the middle of the road, using the Lotis Word for courage. Like other Lotis Masters, she begins her incantations with &quot;Na Sadaru Lotis Raan&quot;. She and Kyo find the lost word which is &quot;Naamasu Sadarumaara Lootisu Sotiraan&quot;. She likes Kyô but cannot muster the courage to tell that to him. She is very quiet and does not have a lot friends.

:Despite the fact her sister Mayura is out to kill her, Alice still loves Mayura and feels guilty about hurting her, and she is convinced Mayura will become the sister she was once before. Alice has no trust in herself which causes her to be too afraid to say what is on her mind.
:Alice&#x27;s older sister Mayura has beauty and skill at everything. She is on the archery team with Kyô and excels in school. Perhaps her only flaw is her allergy towards animals. She loves Kyô, but, unlike Alice, was able to tell him and worked hard to get him to date her. When Mayura realizes Alice loves Kyô as well, she tries to set Alice up with another boy. She vanishes when Alice accidentally wishes her away and the hatred in her heart makes her an easy target for the Maram Words. She becomes a Maram Master and tries to kill Alice and separate her from Kyô once he ended their romantic relationship due to his feelings for Alice.

:Eventually it is revealed that the darkness is Mayura&#x27;s heart stems not just from Kyô rejecting her for Alice, but also because she felt hurt that Alice would not confide to her about her feelings for Kyô as well.
:Kyô, a junior, attends the same school as Alice and Mayura. An orphan, he lives with his aunt and uncle and helps in their cafe making desserts. His father was an abusive drunk and Kyô fears that someday he will be like that too. He dated Mayura and later must deal with his feelings for Alice. Mayura puts a curse into him that feeds itself from his hatred he feels towards his father, and because of this Alice cannot say anything loving to him or the flames of hate will burn Kyô. The curse can be lifted if he overcomes his own hatred.
:The rabbit that Alice saves at the beginning of the series emerges as the rabbit destined to find the neo-masters. She then becomes Alice&#x27;s guide to the Lotis power. She has three forms: a white rabbit, a more anthropomorphic form dressed in ritual robes, and a plushie form for when Alice must go out in public with her.
:Frey has studied with the great Lotis Masters and becomes a mentor to both Alice and Kyô. At first he hides from Kyô and Alice the truth of his training and the legend of the Neo-Masters. He is a persistent playboy who is likely to flirt with any girl who catches his eye. Yet under all this hides a more serious person who knows a lot more about the Lotis Words than he lets on. He is also obsessed with jam. Although he may seem happy and energetic, he has a hidden sorrow. He, like Kyô, has feelings for Alice. He first appears near the end of the first volume.
: The Lotis Master Chris, aged 13, comes from Great Britain. He joins Alice and Kyô and helps them train with the intention of defeating the Maram Masters. He is quite serious, stern, and mature – except whenever desserts are concerned (then he would act like a five-year-old.) Like the other characters, he has a dark secret.
:The stylish Mei-Lin comes from Shanghai in China. A Lotis Master like Chris, she intends to help Alice and Kyô to defeat the Maram. While she lived alone in Shanghai, she had plenty of female friends to keep her company and, with her great figure and flawless skin, worked as a model. Because of her strong personality, her only lament is being unable to find a boyfriend. Possessing a strong sense of justice, she is an expert in tai chi.
:Hailing from the United States of America, Billy, like Chris, is a Lotis Master intending to help Alice and Kyô beat the Maram. Despite his tough exterior, Alice is surprised to learn he works as a postman in a small quiet town. He loves a good fight and is also very kind and generous, and adores children. He has admitted he is sometimes shy, and has a fiancée back in the United States.

;Family
:In &quot;Alice 19th&quot;, some of the characters&#x27; families, such as Alice&#x27;s parents and Kyô&#x27;s uncle Yuki Rengedô and aunt Maki Rengedô, have important roles in the story. Alice and Kyô must repair their relations with their parents as part of their effort to redeem Mayura from the darkness, and Kyô&#x27;s aunt and uncle must also deal with the darkness in their own hearts so that they may better understand Kyô.

===Supporting characters===
;Tatsuya Matsujo
:A male classmate of Alice&#x27;s. Mayura notices that Alice was falling in love with Kyô, so she tries to bring Tatsuya and Alice together. Tatsuya notices that Alice is more interested in Kyô and becomes jealous, but when Alice uses the Lotis Words to purify his inner heart, he accepts that Alice has no interest in dating him.

;Oishi
:A classmate of Alice who bullies her, Oishi has a crush on Kyô. She almost blackmails Kyô to be her boyfriend by threatening to tell his &quot;dark secret;&quot; however, Kyô refuses. Oishi then tells the entire school that Kyô once tried to kill a classmate from another school. It is revealed Oishi suffers from a Maram monster in her that has been in her heart for a very long time. When Alice defeats the Maram monster, Oishi becomes a much nicer person who even begins to support Alice. She is once mentioned in the first chapter of &quot;Ceres, Celestial Legend&quot;.

;Kazuki
:A friend of Kyô, Kazuki has a secret crush on Mayura, and she tricks him into separating Alice and Kyô. He gets a Maram into his heart because of his anger towards Alice and Kyô; however, he is able to fight against the Maram and sacrifice himself for Kyô.

;Eric
:A Lotis Master and the chief at Frey Weilhausen&#x27;s northern European Lotsuan chapter. He treats a Frey like a son, but he is sickly and becomes disillusioned with the Lotis Words, eventually revealing himself to be a powerful Maram Master.

;Samuel
:A blond, disturbed teenage boy who is a Maram Master. He lets Mayura use his body so she can wander the outside world without allowing Alice and Kyô to enter her &quot;inner heart&quot;. He tries to get Kyô on his side and uses his powers to exploit the darkness in the hearts of Kyô&#x27;s aunt and uncle. It is revealed he was once part of a church choir and people admired his beautiful voice, but other members from the choir became jealous and put pieces of glass into his food: this caused him to lose his singing voice.

;Kayna
:A female Maram Master who appears later on the manga. Kayna is 94 years old. She shows a strong hatred towards youth and children. Eventually it becomes clear that her darkness was born due to her lover leaving her for a much younger woman, who called her an &quot;old hag&quot;. Her fear is to become old. She has a love of plants, but she laments that she cannot keep them from wilting. She, along with Samuel, is purified by Kyô and Alice.

<text>Ribitol, or adonitol, is a crystalline pentose alcohol (C5H12O5) formed by the reduction of ribose. It occurs naturally in the plant &quot;Adonis vernalis&quot; as well as in the cell walls of some Gram-positive bacteria, in the form of ribitol phosphate, in teichoic acids. It also forms part of the chemical structure of riboflavin and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which is a nucleotide coenzyme used by many enzymes, the so-called flavoproteins.

<text>Payne Harry Ratner (October 3, 1896 – December 27, 1974) was an American lawyer serving as the 28th governor of Kansas from 1939 to 1943.

==Biography==
Born in Casey, Illinois, Ratner graduated from Blackwell High School in Oklahoma. During World War I he served as an ensign in the U.S. Navy. He earned a law degree at Washington University in St. Louis in 1920. He married Cliffe Dodd on August 21, 1920 and they had three children, Jurie, Teno, and Darb.

==Career==
Ratner practiced law in Sibley, Iowa, and then in Parsons, Kansas. In Parsons, he was the Labette County Attorney from 1923 to 1927. He was elected as a Republican to the Kansas Senate in 1929 and also served as state senator from 1937 to 1939.

Winning the 1938 Republican gubernatorial nomination and the election, Ratner was sworn in as Governor of Kansas on January 9, 1939. He was reelected in 1940. During his tenure, a department of labor was established, a department of revenue and taxation was organized, the highway commission was given authority over the vehicle department, a teacher&#x27;s pension plan was implemented, a small permanent building fund for schools was authorized, and the state fire marshal&#x27;s office, the hotel commission, and the inspector of restaurants were re-established. He left office on January 11, 1943, and retired from politics. In 1962 Ratner was indicted on unethical legal activities; the case was dismissed; and he was cleared of all charges.

==Antisemitic campaign ==
Although he was a deacon in the Disciples of Christ church, because his father was Jewish Ratner was subjected to a vicious antisemitic campaign during the 1938 gubernatorial election. The Marysville Advocate-Democrat called him &quot;a tricky little Jew with just enough Aryan blood in his veins to camouflage his racial background and make him a welcome visitor in most any kind of respectable company. His father is a full-blooded Israelite who talks equally well with either hand.&quot; His opponent and leading Democratic officials condemned the slurs. 

==Death==
Ratner died in 1974 in Wichita, Kansas.

<text>Andrew Frank Schoeppel (November 23, 1894 – January 21, 1962) was an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He was the 29th governor of Kansas from 1943 to 1947 and a U.S. Senator from 1949 until his death. He was born in 1894 in Claflin, Kansas, and died in 1962 of abdominal cancer at the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda, Maryland.

== Early life and political career ==

Schoeppel was born near Claflin, Kansas, to immigrant parents from Bohemia. He attended public school and the University of Kansas, but left college to join the Naval Air Service during World War I. After returning home, he graduated from the University of Nebraska Law School in 1922 and was admitted to the Kansas bar the next year.

His early political life began as county attorney in Ness County, Kansas, and was one of the early local officials for Ness City. Later he was elected mayor of Ness City and also served as chairman of the Kansas Corporation Commission.

In 1952 Schoeppel supported Senator Robert A. Taft for president over fellow Kansan Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Schoeppel voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, but did not vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1960.

== College football ==
Schoeppel played college football from 1920 to 1922 while attending the University of Nebraska and made &quot;honorable mention&quot; on one of Walter Camp&#x27;s first All-America football teams. He served as the head football coach at Fort Hays State University for one season, in 1929, compiling a record of 2–5. Schoeppel filled in as head coach while his predecessor, William D. Weidein, was on sabbatical. Weidein did not return after his one-year sabbatical. After Schoeppel completed his one year as head coach, the school&#x27;s program was taken over by W. C. &quot;Jack&quot; Riley.

<doc id="798022" wikidata="Q5458993" url="?curid=798022" title="Flexible spending account">
<text>In the United States, a flexible spending account (FSA), also known as a flexible spending arrangement, is one of a number of tax-advantaged financial accounts, resulting in payroll tax savings. One significant disadvantage to using an FSA is that funds not used by the end of the plan year are forfeited to the employer, known as the &quot;use it or lose it&quot; rule. Under the terms of the Affordable Care Act however a plan may permit an employee to carry over up to $550 into the following year without losing the funds but this does not apply to all plans and some plans may have lower limits.

The most common type of flexible spending account, the medical expense FSA (also medical FSA or health FSA), is similar to a health savings account (HSA) or a health reimbursement account (HRA). However, while HSAs and HRAs are almost exclusively used as components of a consumer-driven health care plan, medical FSAs are commonly offered with more traditional health plans as well. Paper forms or an FSA debit card may be used to access the account funds.

==Types==
Most cafeteria plans offer flexible spending accounts focused on medical and dependent care expenses, although some plans may offer accounts for other qualified expenses such as adoption assistance.

===Health FSA===
The most common type of FSA is used to pay for medical and dental expenses not paid for by insurance, usually deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance for the employee&#x27;s health plan.
As of January 1, 2011, over-the-counter medications are allowed only when purchased with a doctor&#x27;s prescription, except for insulin. Over-the-counter medical devices, such as bandages, crutches, and eyeglass repair kits, are allowable. Generally, allowable items are the same as those allowable for the medical tax deduction, as outlined in IRS publication 502.

Prior to the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Internal Revenue Service permitted employers to enact any maximum annual election for their employees. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended Section 125 such that FSAs may not allow employees to choose an annual election in excess of a limit determined by the Internal Revenue Service. The annual limit was $2,500 for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 2012. The Internal Revenue Service will index subsequent plan years&#x27; limits for cost-of-living adjustments. For 2018, this adjustment increases the contribution limit to $2650. Employers have the option to limit their employees&#x27; annual elections further. This change starts in plan years that begin after December 31, 2012. The limit is applied to each employee, without regard to whether the employee has a spouse or children. Non-elective contributions made by the employer that are not deducted from the employee&#x27;s wages are not counted against the limit. An employee employed by multiple unrelated employers may elect an amount up to the limit under each employer&#x27;s plan. The limit does not apply to health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements, or the employee&#x27;s share of the cost of employer-sponsored health insurance coverage.

Some employers choose to issue a debit card to their employees who participate in the FSA. Participants may use the debit card to pay for their FSA-eligible expenses at the point of sale. Pharmacies and grocery stores who choose to accept the debit card as payment must disallow transactions at point of sale if the participant attempts to pay for items that are not eligible under an FSA. In addition, employers still must require employees to provide itemized receipts for all expenses charged to the debit card. The IRS allows employers to waive this requirement when an individual uses the debit card at a pharmacy or grocery store that complies with the above procedure. The IRS also allows employers to waive this requirement when the amount charged to the debit card is a multiple of a co-pay of the employee&#x27;s group health insurance plan. In most cases, the FSA administering firm will prefer actual insurance Explanations of Benefits (EOBs) clearly representing the patient portion of any medical expense, over other, more vague documentation. This requirement is becoming less cumbersome as more insurances allow patients to search for past EOBs on their websites.

===Dependent care FSA===
FSAs can also be established to pay for certain expenses to care for dependents while the legal guardian is at work. This includes child care for children under the age of 13 and day care for an individual of any age who is incapable of self-care, lives with the taxpayer for more than one-half of the tax year, and is either the taxpayer&#x27;s spouse or dependent. The FSA can be used to pay for day camps for an eligible individual but not overnight camps. The FSA cannot be used for long-term care for individuals who live in an outside facility, such as in a nursing home.

Federal law limits the dependent care FSA to $5,000 per year, per household. Married spouses can each elect an FSA, but their total combined election cannot exceed $5,000 per year. If a household were to have withdrawals in excess of the limit, the household would be required to pay income tax on the excess.

Unlike medical FSAs, dependent care FSAs are not &quot;pre-funded&quot;; employees cannot receive reimbursement for the full amount of the annual contribution on day one. Employees can only be reimbursed up to the amount they have had deducted during that plan year.

If married, both spouses must earn income in order for either of them to be eligible for a Dependent Care FSA. The only exceptions are if the non-earning spouse is disabled or a full-time student. If one spouse earns less than $5,000 then the benefit is limited to whatever that spouse earned. See IRS Form 2441 Part III for details.

===Other FSAs===
There are FSA plans for non-employer sponsored premium reimbursement and parking and transit expense reimbursement. The individual premium account allows an employee to pay for his or her spouse&#x27;s insurance with pre-tax dollars as long as the other coverage is a non-employer-sponsored, is considered an individual plan, and is directly billed to the member or the member&#x27;s spouse. A parking and transit account allows employees to pay parking or public transit expenses with pre-tax dollars up to certain limits. Though not as common as the FSAs listed above, some employers have offered adoption assistance through an FSA.
Also, one cannot have a health care FSA if he or she has a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) with a Health Savings Account (HSA). In cases where an employee has a HDHP with a HSA, they are eligible for a Limited Expense FSA (LEX) (also called Limited Purpose FSA). These FSAs may be used to reimburse dental and vision expenses, regardless of any plan deductible; at the employer&#x27;s discretion, eligible medical expenses incurred after the deductible is met may also be reimbursable.

==Coverage period==

An FSA&#x27;s coverage period ends either at the time the plan year ends for one&#x27;s plan or at the time when one&#x27;s coverage under that plan ends. An example of such an event is the loss of coverage due to a separation from the employer.

This means that if, for example, a person is employed by a company from January through June and covered on their cafeteria benefits plan (including FSA) during that time, but does not elect and pay for continued coverage under that plan (i.e., COBRA), the person&#x27;s coverage period is defined only as January through June, not January through December as one might think. In this example, all covered expenses must be incurred between January and June of that year.

===Plan year grace period===
In 2005, the Internal Revenue Service authorized an optional grace period of up to 2½ months that employers can use in their plans, allowing use of the funds for up to 2½ months after the end of the plan year.

In 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 contained provisions to allow employees to roll over the remainder of their accounts from 2020 into 2021 and from 2021 into 2022.

==Methods of withdrawal==
The FSA debit card was developed to eliminate &quot;double-dipping&quot;, by allowing employees to access the FSA directly. It also simplified the substantiation requirement, which required labor-intensive claims processing. The debit card also enhances the effect of &quot;pre-funding&quot; medical FSAs. However, the substantiation requirement itself did not go away, and has even been expanded on by the IRS for the debit-card environment; therefore, withdrawal issues still remain for FSAs. These withdrawal issues have led to creative solutions by ecommerce companies who created an entire website dedicated to FSA-eligible items and accepting all FSA debit cards, and other websites which created a small portion of their website dedicated to FSAs.

According to Celent, as of May 2006, there were approximately 6 million debit cards in the market tied to FSA accounts, representing 25% of the FSA participating community. Celent projects that FSA cards will increase FSA adoption rates. The average card participation rate was around 20% as of May 2006. By 2010, it is projected this rate will increase to 85%.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Pre-funding and risks incurred by the employee and employer===
One consideration regarding medical FSAs is that the participating employee&#x27;s entire annual contribution is available at the start of the plan year, commonly January 1, or after the first contribution to the FSA is received by the FSA vendor, depending on the plan. Therefore, if the employee experiences a qualifying event during the first period, the entire amount of the annual contribution can be claimed against the FSA benefits. If the employee is terminated, quits, or is unable to return to work, he or she does not have to repay the money to the employer.

The employee contributes to the FSA in small increments throughout the year (for example, 1/26 of the annual amount if one is paid every two weeks), but taken together, all employees of a company contribute the full average amount during any given period, and no real risk is incurred by the employer. In addition, instead of paying payroll taxes to the government, the employer typically pays only a small administrative fee to the plan of $4–10 per month per participating employee. This is much less than the employer would have paid for its share of payroll taxes. In addition, any money that is not used by the end of the plan year (or grace period) is returned to the employer. This is estimated to be up to 14% of the total employee contributions, which can be a substantial boon to the employer&#x27;s bottom line.

If a company plans to lay off some employees, and announces such plans, then if multiple employees use their entire flexible benefit before they are terminated, that may cause the company to have to reimburse the plan. Typically, however, employers do not announce layoffs for specific employees with enough notice for employees to use the available benefits, and employees may actually lose their contributions in addition to being laid off.

An employee does not continue to contribute to the plan upon termination of employment. Thus, one could use the entire amount on day one of the plan year, terminate employment on day two of the plan year, and contributions would have been none or negligible (e.g., perhaps 1/26 in the case of biweekly contributions). The &quot;free&quot; money is not taxable because the IRS views these plans as health insurance plans for tax purposes. According to IRS section 125, benefits received from a health insurance plan are not considered taxable income.

The same reasons that make pre-funding a possible benefit to an employee participating in a plan make them a potential risk to employers setting up a plan. The employer has to make up the difference that the employee has spent from the flexible spending account but not yet contributed if other employees&#x27; contributions do not account for the money spent. The amount the employer loses due to pre-funding may eventually be partially, totally, or more than made up by employees that do not spend all of the money in their FSA account by the end of the plan year and grace period (see above).

===Over-the-counter drugs and medical items===
Another FSA feature that was introduced in 2003, is the ability to pay for over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and medical items. In addition to substantially expanding the range of &quot;FSA-eligible&quot; purchases, adding OTC items made it easier to &quot;spend down&quot; medical FSAs at year-end to avoid the &quot;use it or lose it&quot; rule.

However, substantiation has again become an issue; generally, OTC purchases require either manual claims or, for FSA debit cards, submission of receipts after the fact. Most FSA providers require that receipts show the complete name of the item; the abbreviations on many store receipts are incomprehensible to many claims offices. Also, some of the IRS rules on what is and isn&#x27;t eligible have proven rather arcane in practice. The recently developed inventory information approval system (IIAS), separates eligible and ineligible items at the point-of-sale and provides for automatic debit-card substantiation.

Effective January 1, 2020, over-the-counter medicines are allowable without a prescription or a note from a physician. In addition, menstrual care products are also allowable. The change was made as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).

===Eligible Medical Item List===
The IIAS system references a master eligibility list of FSA eligible products at the point of sale. The Special Interest Group for IIAS Standards (SIG-IS) maintains this eligibility list and updates it on a monthly basis.

The FSA Eligibility List includes items within eligible healthcare product categories determined by the IRS. Health Savings Accounts share the same medical item eligibility list as FSAs.

According to section 9003(c) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as of January 1, 2011, drugs needed to be prescribed to be reimbursable. That requirement was lifted, effective January 1, 2020.

===Use it or lose it===

A potential drawback is that the money must be spent &quot;within the coverage period&quot; as defined by the benefits cafeteria plan coverage definition. This coverage period is usually defined as the &quot;period that you are covered&quot; under the cafeteria plan during the &quot;plan year.&quot; The &quot;plan year&quot; is commonly defined as the calendar year, but could also include the grace period of Jan 1 – March 15 of the following year. For example, the &quot;plan year&quot; (or &quot;benefit year&quot;) of 2016 would run from Jan 1, 2016, until March 15, 2017, if the employer offered the grace period.

Any money left unspent at the end of the coverage period is forfeited and can be applied to future plan administrative costs or can be equally allocated as taxable income among all plan participants; this is commonly known as the &quot;use it or lose it&quot; rule. Under most plans, the &quot;coverage period&quot; generally ceases upon termination of employment whether initiated by the employee or the employer, unless the employee continues coverage with the company under COBRA or other arrangement. Should an employee have unused contributions in an FSA and no additional qualifying claims during the coverage period the employee it is possible that the employee will forfeit (lose) the funds. If the payroll taxes saved on the employee&#x27;s contributions exceeds the amount the employee forfeited, may nonetheless have saved money.

A second requirement is that all applications for refunds must be made by a date defined by the plan. If funds are forfeited, this does not eliminate the requirement to pay taxes on these funds if such taxes are required. For example, if a single person elects to withhold $5,000 for child care expenses and marries a non-working spouse, the $5,000 would become taxable. If this person did not submit claims by the required date, the $5,000 would be forfeited but taxes would still be owed on the amount.

Also, the annual contribution amount must remain the same throughout the year unless certain qualifying events occur, such as the birth of a child or death of a spouse.

Effective 2013 plan years, employers may amend their plan documents to allow participants to carry over up to $500 of unused amounts to the following plan year. (The limit was increased to $550 as of January 1, 2020.) Doing so allows participants to spend the carryover amounts on qualifying medical expenses incurred during the following plan year. A carryover of unused amounts does not affect the indexed $2,500 annual limit. A plan year may allow either a rollover or a grace period for unused amounts for the same plan year but not both. Carryovers only apply for qualifying medical expenses; plans may not allow participants to carry over unused amounts for dependent care or other expenses. The carryover amount does not reduce the participant&#x27;s maximum FSA contribution for the next plan year. Accordingly, a person who carries over $550 to the next plan year and who also contributes $2,500 to their FSA for that plan year may be able to receive reimbursements from his or her FSA for up to $3,050 of eligible medical expense during that plan year. In order for an individual to be able to carry over unused amounts, the plan must be amended to permit this type of a carryover.

==California notice==
Employers in California that sponsor flexible spending accounts must notify participants of any &quot;deadline to withdraw funds before the end of the plan year.&quot; The notice must be sent to all participants who work in California. Employers must provide the required notice in at least two methods (email, telephone, text message, postal mail, and in-person), only one of which may be electronic. The law is effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2020. 

==History==
Section 134 of the Revenue Act of 1978 gave tax-favorable treatment to flexible spending accounts for medical expenses. 

In 1984, the Internal Revenue Service issued a ruling that, while flexible spending accounts were allowable, employees must elect a certain amount for the plan each year and that any unused amounts would be forfeited at the end of the year. Until that point, some employers had set up flexible spending account plans that allowed employees to simply request reimbursement of any qualifying medical expense with no preset annual limit and no risk of forfeiture by employees.

In 1997 and 1998, the Internal Revenue Service detailed circumstances when an employee could make changes to an annual election in a flexible spending account. Eligible events that would allow a change in annual election include a change in marital status, a change in the number of dependents, a change in a spouse&#x27;s or dependent&#x27;s employment status, a strike or a lockout, a leave of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act, a change employment status (same as above), a change in a dependent&#x27;s eligibility status, a significant change in the costs for or coverage by an employer-sponsored health plan, a change in the residence or work site of the employee or employee&#x27;s spouse or dependent, the participant&#x27;s failure to pay premiums, a change based on special enrollment rights under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a court-ordered change, and entitlement to either Medicare or Medicaid. 

In 2000, employers began to issue debit cards to participating employees to make it easier to access flexible spending account funds. 

In September 2003, the Internal Revenue Service issued a ruling saying that certain over-the-counter medical expenses could be covered under flexible spending account plans. 

Effective January 1, 2013, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ((PPACA) essentially required flexible spending accounts to limit employees&#x27; annual elections to no more than $2,500, with small increases each year based on inflation. Over-the-counter medications became ineligible expenses as well. 

In 2013, the Internal Revenue Service issued a ruling that permitted flexible spending plans for health care expenses to allow employees to roll over up to $500 in unused funds from one plan year to the following plan year.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, between January 1 and December 31, 2020, the Internal Revenue Service allows a health flexible spending account plan and a dependent care flexible spending account plan to allow employees to enroll mid-year, revoke an existing election on a prospective basis, or replace an existing election on a prospective basis. In response to Executive Order 13877, the Internal Revenue Service said that a health flexible spending account plan may increase the unused carryover amounts from $500 to a maximum of $550.

<text>Skeletor () is a fictional supervillain and the main antagonist of the &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; franchise created by Mattel, serving as the archenemy of He-Man and usually depicted as a skull-faced, blue-skinned sorcerer. In the franchise&#x27;s storyline, Skeletor seeks to discover the secrets of Castle Grayskull, which he believes will allow him to conquer the planet of Eternia and the universe, and become the titular Master of the Universe.

==Appearances==
===Pre-Filmation minicomics (&quot;savage Eternia&quot;)===
The first minicomics that accompanied the 1981–1983 line of &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; toys presented the earliest version of continuity, which had several differences from the continuity of the Filmation cartoon and the minicomics that complemented it. He-Man was depicted as the champion of a tribe of stone-age jungle-dwellers, and there was no royal court of Eternia, King Randor, Queen Marlena, or Prince Adam.

Skeletor was originally an inhabitant of another dimension until he was transported to Eternia during &quot;The Great Wars&quot; when a hole opened in the dimensional wall, and seeks to reopen the rift so that his race can invade and conquer Eternia.

===Filmation &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; (1983)===

In the 1980s series, Skeletor is a former pupil of Hordak, high-ranking commander of the Evil Horde. When Hordak invaded Eternia and kidnapped the baby Princess Adora from the palace, Man-At-Arms and the Royal Guard captured his apprentice, Skeletor, and forced him to divulge the whereabouts of his master, who had retreated to his base of operations, Snake Mountain. After being cornered, Hordak escaped to Eternia with Adora through a dimensional portal. Skeletor, left behind by Hordak, set about raising an army of minions of his own, becoming ruler of Snake Mountain. He seeks to conquer the fortress of Castle Grayskull, from which He-Man draws his powers, and conquer Eternia and the universe. His other goal is to take revenge on Hordak and overthrow Horde Prime in his bid to conquer the universe. Despite this, his plans are often foiled by He-Man or She-Ra, as well as the incompetence of him and his minions.

In addition to the main series, he appeared in the spin-off series &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power,&quot; the theatrical film &quot;He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword&quot;, and the primetime Christmas special &quot;He-Man and She-Ra: A Christmas Special&quot;. In these appearances, he is voiced by Alan Oppenheimer.

===Post-Filmation series minicomics===
In the 1986 minicomic &quot;The Search for Keldor&quot;, Skeletor is implied to be Keldor, King Randor&#x27;s long-lost brother, as he attempts to stop Prince Adam and Randor from searching for Keldor. According to King Randor, Keldor disappeared years ago after, in his pursuit to master magic, an experiment went wrong and transported him to another dimension. In order to uncover what happened to Keldor, Randor and the Sorceress attempt to look through a space-time rift that opens once a year. 

However, because the original toyline ended before the story could be resolved, this has not been confirmed. Steven Grant, the writer-for-hire of the minicomic, stated in a he-man.org interview that &quot;As far as I remember, Keldor was Skeletor... But, I don&#x27;t think that was ever going to be revealed... I seem to remember it as one of those things Mattel came up with out of the blue... Slur Keldor and you end up with Skeletor... His back-story wasn&#x27;t really worked out. Some sort of evil cosmic energies altered him. I think they were going for a Darth Vader thing, but it was a tack-on... The main idea was that if they found out Skeletor was Keldor, they&#x27;d be able to find out what had changed him and might find some way to reverse it.&quot;

In the Masters of the Universe Classics toyline, he is Randor&#x27;s half-brother, whose mother was a member of the Gar race, and was ousted from the royal castle due to his Gar heritage. While roaming Eternia in search of knowledge, he learned the Dark Arts from Hordak and sought to unite Eternia by ruling it himself. After battling Randor and losing, he turned to his mentor, Hordak, to survive and was merged with an entity known as the Demo-Man, becoming Skeletor. 

===&quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (1987 film)===

In the 1987 live-action film, Skeletor is portrayed by Frank Langella, with his portrayal of the character being darker than his animated counterpart and serving as a competent and threatening antagonist. In the film, Skeletor captures Castle Grayskull and imprisons the Sorceress after Evil-Lyn tricks an Earth girl named Julie into giving her the Cosmic Key. He later absorbs the power of the Great Eye and transforms into a golden demonic god, but He-Man throws him off a cliff into a vat. In a post-credits scene, Skeletor emerges from the vat and proclaims that he will return. To prepare for the role, Langella asked his kids questions about Skeletor and watched the original series. His performance is highly regarded by fans and critics as being a high point in the film, and Langella has regarded Skeletor as one of his favorite roles.

===&quot;The New Adventures of He-Man&quot; (1990)===

In the series, Skeletor (voiced by Campbell Lane) tricks the Galactic Guardians, Hydron and Flipshot, into believing that he is the force of good they need to save their home planet, Primus, when they come looking for He-Man. Unable to decide who is good and who is evil, Skeletor and He-Man are transported to the futuristic planet Primus, where Skeletor reveals his true nature to the Primans as the Mutants attack. Skeletor and the leader of the mutants, Flogg, come to an agreement: Skeletor will help Flogg conquer Primus in exchange for Flogg&#x27;s help in destroying He-Man. One of Flogg&#x27;s conditions is that he remain in charge of the mutants. Skeletor agrees, and is able to manipulate and control Flogg from behind the scenes, while making himself a force to be reckoned with among Primans and Mutants alike.

In the episode &quot;Sword and Staff&quot;, Skeletor absorbs the power of a crystal he finds on Moon Nordor, which grants him power and changes changing his appearance to one based on the &quot;Disks of Doom Skeletor&quot; toy. Throughout the series, Skeletor concocts various schemes to destroy He-Man and conquer Primus.

Skeletor&#x27;s portrayal in the series differs from the Filmation cartoon, as he possesses a sarcastic sense of humor and takes his failures better. He also has genuine relationships with others, including Crita and the mutants and his pet, Gur, and is more competent and threatening.

The first toys for the &quot;New Adventures&quot; line gave a different explanation for how He-Man and Skeletor ended up in the future and how he gained his cybernetics through a mini-comic included with various figures. In the mini-comic, Skeletor learned that He-Man and Prince Adam were the same, only for Adam to become He-Man permanently. The energy output caused by this transformation led him to use cybernetics to heal his wounds.

===&quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; (2002)===

In the series, Skeletor (voiced by Brian Dobson) serves as the main antagonist of the first season and, along with Kobra Khan and Rattlor, one of three secondary antagonists of the second season. Skeletor was formerly the warlord Keldor, who trained in the dark arts and was taught the ways of black magic after summoning Hordak, who was trapped in the dark dimension of Despondos. When he and his forces attacked the Hall of Wisdom, he fought Randor, but was mortally injured after being splashed in the face with acid. As Kronis retreated, Evil-Lyn took Keldor to Hordak&#x27;s sanctuary, where Keldor summoned Hordak to save his life. Keldor agreed to pay the price Hordak wished for his own life, and Hordak transformed him into his current form as Skeletor.

Due to being trapped in the Dark Hemisphere by the Mystic Wall, Skeletor designed a machine to destroy it. However, it needed the Corodite Crystal as a power source; after Mer-Man retrieved it, Skeletor destroyed the Mystic Wall and returned to menacing Eternia.

Unlike previous portrayals, Skeletor is initially not concerned with Castle Grayskull until a giant fish-monster swallowes the remnants of the Corodite Crystal and he begins to seek power. In the first season finale, Skeletor directly attacks with his Council of Evil until King Hiss and the Snake Men are freed from the Void. Kinh Hiss imprisons him in the Void and has him devoured by a giant snake, but Skeletor escapes after the Masters defeat Hiss.

Despite owing his life to Hordak, Skeletor destroys Hordak&#x27;s sanctuary to prevent him from returning, as he did not want to hold up his end of the bargain and free Hordak from Despondos due to wanting Eternia for himself. At the end of the second season, King Hiss revives Serpos, the Serpent God, who had been transformed into Snake Mountain by the Elders, but it is defeated and returned to its Snake Mountain form. 

In the series, Skeletor is portrayed as being cruel to his followers and ruling them through fear, blaming them for their defeats at the hands of the Masters. He is also shown power-hungry and harbors hatred towards King Randor for his part in destroying his face and making him what he is now, also blaming Evil-Lyn for saving him. This gradually shifts towards hatred against He-Man for opposing him.

As with all Mike Young Productions series&#x27; characters, Skeletor&#x27;s appearance is based on his figure from the Four Horsemen-designed toyline. Skeletor is the character that received perhaps the least-extensive redesign from his original toy/cartoon version. However, when this new design was then translated into animated form, MYP&#x27;s artists usually gave him a voluminous cape, which neither the new toy or the original incarnation of the character wore. When a convention-exclusive figure of Keldor was made using the existing Skeletor body, a removable cloth cape was included. As the figure came with three swappable heads, including his Keldor face; his burning, acid-splashed visage, and his final Skeletor head, this figure could be configured into a &quot;show-accurate&quot; caped Skeletor.

According to a he-man.org interview with one of the series producers, Keldor is Randor&#x27;s half-brother. If a third season had been produced, it would have seen Skeletor and He-Man dealing with the Horde invasion and Hordak, who Skeletor would have defeated. It also would have shown Skeletor&#x27;s part in kidnapping of She-Ra and sending her to Hordak to be raised. 

===&quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; (2012)===

In the comics published by DC Comics, Skeletor works to prevent Adam from remembering his true identity.

Following Beast Man&#x27;s failure, he learns that their attempt to wipe his memory did not erase his instinctive understanding of battle. Though he shows Beast Man mercy, he reminds them of their goal; Trap Jaw and his riders later ambush Adam in the desert.

While reflecting on how he had worked so hard to capture Adam&#x27;s sword, which he thought was the source of He-Man&#x27;s power but now knows is a conduit to the powers of Castle Grayskull, he has a catatonic Sorceress over for dinner and attempts to learn from her how to access Castle Grayskull;s powers. When Adam and Teela are on a ship at sea, Skeletor sends word to Mer-Man to dispose of &quot;Prince&quot; Adam.

Annoyed at the fact that his allies have not killed Adam, he considers taking action, but is unable to leave Castle Grayskull. He then worries that the Sorceress is the key to unlocking the castle&#x27;s power.

After Evil-Lyn reports to him about the misplacement of her prisoners Adam and Teela and points out that the bird Zoar allowed Adam to escape, Skeletor realizes that the Sorceress of Grayskull has been undermining him. He confronts her in her cell and demands to know where in his mind she was hiding. After she reveals that she hid in plain sight within a pleasant memory that he rarely visits, he kills her and resolves to get Grayskull&#x27;s power himself.

At Castle Grayskull, after Beast Man informs him that He-Man has regained his memories and will soon attack the castle, they prepare for his arrival. During the battle, Skeletor is revealed to have survived the fall into the chasm and is faced with the head that he threw out of the castle, who is revealed to be a minion that encourages him to not accept defeat. The ending reveals that an unknown enemy that wishes Skeletor dead, but is not yet prepared to see it happen, has been manipulating him.

===&quot;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&quot;===
After discovering that Castle Grayskull is a shell that serves to guard the Orb of Power, Skeletor uses the Shaping Staff to disguise himself as Spikor and Evil-Lyn as Clawful, who pretends to have been captured by He-Man, but is in reality the robot Faker. This deception dupes the Sorceress long enough for the Evil Warriors to enter and attack Grayskull.

After gaining access to the heart of Grayskull, Skeletor defeats Moss Man and manipulates He-Man into stabbing him with his sword to strike and open the Orb of Power, releasing the magic power that created Eternia and the universe. The Sorceress freezes time to meet with He-Man and Teela and Skeletor attempts to grab the two halves of the sword. However, he and Adam are destroyed in the ensuing explosion, leaving behind his Havoc Staff.

Part of Skeletor&#x27;s essence survives and comes to dwell in Evil-Lyn&#x27;s wand staff. Teela, accompanied by Evil-Lyn and Beast Man, goes on a quest to recover the halves of the Sword of Power and reforge them into one . In the Eternian afterlife, Preternia, they reunite with Adam, who gave up his everlasting reward to return to the land of the living and restore magic to the universe with the power of Grayskull. When magic returns, Skeletor reforms and stabs Adam in the back before taking the Sword of Power and the power of Grayskull, becoming Skelegod.

===&quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; (2021)===
Skeletor appears in &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; (2021), voiced by Benjamin Diskin. This version is a full-blooded human and the younger brother of King Randor. Ten years prior to the events of the series, Keldor kidnapped Adam and attempted to gain the power of the Havoc Staff before being cursed by its energy and transformed into a skeleton.

After reuniting with Adam in the present, Skeletor battles him and attempts to remake the universe in his image before Adam cleanses him of Havoc and reverts him to his human form. Despite this, Beast-Man retrieves the Havoc Staff from the severed arm of Skeletor&#x27;s former giant form.

===&quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (2026 film)===
Skeletor will appear in the upcoming 2026 movie portrayed by Jared Leto.

==Powers and abilities==
As a sorcerer, Skeletor possesses various dark magical powers and can perform remote viewing through a crystal ball; as a master of the occult arts, he is privy to secret knowledge about the universe. He is also intelligent and possesses considerable skill in science and machinery. Though he usually wields a sceptre called the Havoc Staff, he has also been shown to wield swords, such as in early mini-comics, where he possesses one half of the Power Sword. 

==Animals==

Despite being evil, Skeletor has an affinity for animals. He has had various animal companions, including Panthor as well as Grr in &quot;The New Adventures of He-Man&quot;.

In &quot;He-Man and She-Ra: A Christmas Special&quot;, Skeletor befriends Relay, a partly-robotic dog and member of the Manchines. After Relay is shot down by Hordak, Skeletor initially abandons Relay before deciding to bring him with him.

==In other media==
* Skeletor appeared in various commercials, including a 1985 Australian Streets commercial for He-Man branded ice cream, where he is voiced by Keith Scott, a series of commercials for Honda, where he is voiced by Jeff Bennett, a March 2017 commercial for Moneysupermarket.com. and a September 2017 GEICO commercial, where he is voiced by Bill Lobley.
* Skeletor appears in DC Comics, where he became Skeletor after being cursed by his father.

<text>Frank Carlson (January 23, 1893May 30, 1987) was an American politician who served as the 30th governor of Kansas, Kansas State representative, United States representative, and United States senator from Kansas. Carlson is the only Kansan to have held all four offices. His political career spanned 40 years, beginning in November 1928 and ending in January 1969.
==Early life and education==
Carlson was born in 1893 near Concordia, Kansas, the son of Anna (Johannesson) and Charles Eric Carlson, both Swedish immigrants. He attended public schools and Kansas State University before serving in World War I as a Private.

== Career ==

After the war, he returned to Concordia to farm. He was elected as a Republican to first the Kansas House of Representatives in 1928 and then to the United States House of Representatives, where he served from 1935 to 1947.

In 1946 he was elected governor of Kansas. As governor, he pushed mental health programs as well as a long-term highway project. In 1949, Kansas U.S. Senator Clyde M. Reed died, and Carlson appointed Harry Darby to fill the seat. Darby continued his service in the Senate until Carlson himself was elected to fill the seat in 1950. Instead of waiting until January to be sworn in, he took his seat on November 28, 1950, leaving the office of governor to Frank L. Hagaman who served less than two months.

In 1952, he campaigned for Dwight D. Eisenhower, and then brokered a deal through Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft and became Senate majority leader. According to Billy Graham&#x27;s biography &quot;Just As I Am&quot;, Carlson invited Eisenhower to the Senate Prayer Breakfast, which thus became the first Presidential Prayer Breakfast, thereafter an annual assembly of all three branches of government, continuing to this day. Carlson was re-elected twice, in 1956 and 1962, before returning to Concordia for retirement.

Carlson served a term as president of the United States Senate Prayer Breakfast Group. He was therein featured by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; on July 1, 1968, by editor, David Lawrence, for his strong moral and spiritual influence in the nation&#x27;s capital. He was also a member of the board of directors of World Vision.

Carlson voted in favor of the Senate amendment to Civil Rights Act of 1957 on August 7, 1957, but did not vote on the House amendment to the bill on August 29, 1957 or the Civil Rights Act of 1960. Carlson voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court.

==Death==
Carlson died in 1987 in Concordia and was buried there in Pleasant Hill Cemetery. The federal court building in Topeka is named in his honor, US 81 from the Nebraska state line north of Belleville to Salina is named the Frank Carlson Memorial Highway, the Frank Carlson Library in Concordia is named in his honor, and Wichita State University hosts the Frank Carlson Lecture Series.

==Frank Carlson Library==
In April 2011, the Frank Carlson Library in Concordia, Kansas, received a mini grant from the Kansas Humanities Council to renovate the library&#x27;s Frank Carlson Room. The grant funded the development of a new exhibit dedicated to telling new generations of Kansans about Carlson&#x27;s life and political career. Coinciding with the yearlong Kansas 150 Commemoration, the renovation was part of a statewide initiative to preserve the memory of important people and events in the state&#x27;s past. Senator Frank Carlson is the only Kansan to have held four major public offices and is known as &quot;Kansas&#x27; Favorite Son&quot;.

The renovation project replaced the original Frank Carlson display, created in 1976 and shown until the summer of 2011. The new exhibit, &quot;Frank Carlson: Prairie Politician&quot;, tells and preserves Senator Carlson&#x27;s story through an updated exhibit and modern archival techniques. The exhibit showcases Carlson memorabilia, photographs, and items from the Senator&#x27;s personal collection, which is housed in the Frank Carlson Library. Senator Carlson&#x27;s story is told in three parts, beginning with his childhood and church leadership in Concordia, Kansas, following him through his forty-year political career, and celebrating his legacy as a political figure and an important local figure.

Among the items on display are a check from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, written to Carlson in settlement of a friendly bet, several pens used by President Lyndon B. Johnson to sign important legislation that Carlson supported, and Carlson&#x27;s elephant figurine collection. The exhibit also includes artifacts that tie Carlson to his hometown and home state. On display are the school bell from the schoolhouse Carlson attended in Cloud County, Kansas, caricatures and political cartoons drawn by fellow Concordian Don Musik, and keepsakes on loan from Carlson&#x27;s friends and family.

<doc id="798037" wikidata="Q7512393" url="?curid=798037" title="Sigma Tau Gamma">
<text>Sigma Tau Gamma (), commonly known as Sig Tau, is a United States college social fraternity founded on June 28, 1920, at the University of Central Missouri (then known as Central Missouri State Teachers College). The fraternity was founded as a result of friendships made while some of the founders fought in World War I in France.

The fraternity went on to create new chapters on the campuses surrounding teachers&#x27; colleges (at the time also called &quot;normal schools&quot;). Since the Fraternity&#x27;s beginnings in 1920, they have since spread to more than 193 university campuses across the United States. The fraternity is an active member of the North American Interfraternity Conference.

==History==
Four of the founders (Emmett Ellis, Leland Thornton Hoback, Edward George Grannert, and William Glenn Parsons) had enlisted and served their country together during the First World War in France. Parsons commented that in founding the Fraternity they wanted to sustain a &quot;sense of service, responsibility, and affection for their companions.&quot; These four, together with Allen Ross Nieman, Edward Henry McCune, Carl Nelson Chapman, Buell Wright McDaniel, George Eugene Hartrick, A. Barney Cott, Chiles Edward Hoffman, Rodney Edward Herndon, William Edward Billings, Clarence Willard Salter, Frank H. Gorman, Alpheus Oliphant Fisher, and Daniel Frank Fisher, were the 17 founders of the fraternity.

Several of the founders were members of the Irving Literary Society, but they wanted to create a new fraternity including members of other literary societies. On the morning of June 28, 1920, &quot;at an unusually early hour&quot; according to the original minutes, a list containing the names of about thirty men was posted on the college bulletin board by Emmett Ellis with a request to meet that afternoon.

According to the minutes, &quot;the notice had the proper effect and, as requested, there appeared a goodly number of men to learn what was in store for them.&quot; Founder Nieman, who had become familiar with fraternities while attending William Jewell College, was the principal organizer of the meeting. He explained the purpose of the meeting and told them what such an organization could mean to the men of the college. The men elected Leland Hoback temporary Chairman and Emmett Ellis temporary Secretary. They agreed to begin crafting the organization and adjourned until July 7, 1920.

The founders were accompanied by Dr. Wilson C. Morris to present their petition to the faculty, who had been part of Sigma Nu in his college days. Dr. Morris became the Fraternity&#x27;s first honorary member and served the alpha chapter at Central Missouri as patron, counselor, and advisor until he died in 1947.

A further fourteen members were added in the first year of the fraternity&#x27;s existence. Founder Edward H. McCune recalled later that, &quot;from the very beginning, Sigma Tau Gamma prospered, both in membership and service. Its challenge to students to live well and promote the spirit of brotherhood was continually being met by those who were seeking membership.&quot;

== Symbols and traditions ==
There are several public and private ceremonies and rituals in the fraternity, from initiation to memorials for deceased fraternity members. Sigma Tau Gamma also has a development program known as the &quot;Path of Principles&quot;. The first eight weeks of the program challenge associate members to &quot;promote the highest ideals of brotherhood and demonstrate an abiding spirit in which all things in life are done and possible&quot;. Content is covered during weekly associate meetings held separate from the chapter meeting.

The fraternity&#x27;s colors are azure blue, white, red, and yellow. Its mascot is the knight and its flower is the white rose.

Its coat of arms was adopted in 1927 and modified in 1954. The badge, which all members may purchase and wear, is the principal symbol of membership. The badge was adopted in 1927 and modified in 2016. The standard gold badge is provided to each new member at initiation. The associate pin is worn by associate members of the fraternity until initiation. The associate pin is the chapter&#x27;s property and is returned to the chapter at the time of initiation by the new member.

== Activities ==
The fraternity hosts multiple annual events, including:

*The Noble Man Institute: a retreat-based leadership program for newly initiated members of Sigma Tau Gamma
*The Earl A. Webb Academy: a three-day training and networking program for chapter presidents and vice presidents
*The Endeavor conference
*The Grand Conclave.

== Philanthropy ==
On June 30, 2011, the Board of Directors announced its partnership with the Special Olympics in 2011, making it the fraternity’s official philanthropy. Each chapter is expected to provide service or funds directly to the Special Olympics.

The fraternity offers scholarships and awards to undergraduates and alumni during the summer convention. The individual awards include the Michael J. Steinbeck Fellowship, which offers assistance in the pursuit of graduate and professional degrees. Chapter awards include the Earl A. Webb Most Improved Chapter Award and the Emmett Ellis Chapter Scholarship Award

<text>Adonis is a genus of about 20–30 species of flowering plants of the crowfoot family, Ranunculaceae, native to Europe and Asia.

The species grow to in height, with feathery, finely divided leaves. Their flowers are red, yellow or orange and have 5–30 petals. The Autumn Adonis, pheasant&#x27;s-eye (&quot;A. annua&quot;), has flowers with bright red petals.

The generic name &quot;Adonis&quot; refers to the mythical character Adonis, a lover of the goddess Aphrodite or Venus, and of Persephone, goddess of the underworld. Red flowers of the Adonis genus are said to have grown from the grave of Adonis, after he was slain by a wild boar possessed with unusual viciousness through instigation by the jealous Ares. According to the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Ovid the anemone, also of the family &quot;Ranunculaceae&quot;, was created when Venus sprinkled nectar on his blood.

==Systematics==
Initial characterization by Wang Wen-Tsai

=== Subgen. 1. Adonanthe (Spach) ===
Perennial herbs, with robust rhizomes. Some or all of the basal leaves are reduced to vaginiform scales at the lower stem ridges. The last lobe of the leaves is ovate, triangular, lanceolate or linear. Petals (7-8-)9 or more, yellow, white, or blue, not dark-spotted at the base. The anthers are muddy. Carpel not dorso-ventrally compressed, dorsally not longitudinally ribbed, more or less distinct into ovary and style, ovaries usually pubescent rarely glabrous. Aggregate fruit broadly ovoid or globose, with an oblong or lanceolate receptacle. Type: A. vernalia L.

==== Sect. 1 Leiocarpa ====
Basal leaves 3-5 normally developed, 3-pinnate-sectate, long petiolate, base broadly and thinly sheathed, oblong plates, circ. 4 reduced to thinly membranous dark-brown narrowly ovate or oblong scales 7-10mm wide. The stem leaves all developed normally. Achenium glabrous, smooth, arched-convex on the back, lacking a transverse crest, longitudinally 2-ribbed on both sides, persistent style short circ. 0.8mm long straight. Type: A. nepalensis Simon

==== Sect. 2 Ancistrocarpium ====
Basal leaves 1-3 normally developed. 3-4-ternate-pinnate-secta, long petiolate, triangular plates, 3-5 membranous dark-brown oblong or ovate-oblong circ. 1.5 cm wide reduced, rarely reduced to vaginiform scales. The leaves of the stem are all normally developed, the lowest one long petiolate. Achenium glabrous or pubescent, dorsum arched-convex, rarely truncate at very convex apex, provided with a narrow transverse crest or lacking it, inconspicuously or distinctly longitudinally veined on both sides, persistent style more or less elongate 1.2-4mm long with hooked-curved apex. Type: A. chrysosyatha Hook. f. and Thomas

==== Sect. 3 Adonanthe ====
Basal leaves all with lower stems reduced to brown papery scales narrowly oblong or oblong-lanceolate rarely oblong 3-8(-10)mm wide.

<text>The Hawaii House of Representatives () is the lower house of the Hawaii State Legislature. Pursuant to Article III, Section 3 of the Constitution of Hawaii, amended during the 1978 constitutional convention, the House of Representatives consists of 51 members representing an equal number of districts across the islands. It is led by the Speaker of the House elected from the membership of the House, with majority and minority leaders elected from their party&#x27;s respective caucuses. The current Speaker of the House is Nadine Nakamura.

Legislators are elected to two-year terms and are not subject to term limits. As in many state legislatures in the United States, the Hawaiʻi House of Representatives is a part-time body and legislators often have active careers outside government. The upper house of the legislature is the Hawaii State Senate.
According to Article III, section 4 of the Hawaii State Constitution, a legislator&#x27;s term begins on the day of the general election and ends the day of the general election if a new member is elected.

The last election took place on November 5, 2024. The next election will take place on November 8, 2026.

<doc id="798044" wikidata="Q1392427" url="?curid=798044" title="Hawaii Senate">
<text>The Hawaii State Senate (Hawaiian: Ka ‘Aha Kenekoa) is the upper house of the Hawaii State Legislature. It consists of twenty-five members elected from an equal number of constituent districts across the islands and is led by the President of the Senate, elected from the membership of the body, currently Ron Kouchi. The forerunner of the Hawaii Senate during the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii was the House of Nobles originated in 1840. In 1894, the Constitution of the Republic of Hawaii renamed the upper house the present senate. Senators are elected to four-year terms and are not subject to term limits.

Like most state legislatures in the United States, the Hawaii State Senate is a part-time body and senators often have active careers outside government. The lower house of the legislature is the Hawaii House of Representatives. The membership of the Senate also elects additional officers to include the Senate Vice President, Senate Chief Clerk, Assistant Chief Clerk, Senate Sergeant at Arms, and Assistant Sergeant at Arms. The Hawaii Senate convenes in the Hawaii State Capitol in Honolulu.

According to Article III, section 4 of the Hawaii State Constitution, a legislator&#x27;s term begins on the day of the general election and ends the day of the general election if a new member is elected.

==Composition==
The Democrats have controlled the chamber since 1963, and have held a supermajority since 1984.

From 2016 (when Sen. Sam Slom, Hawaii&#x27;s sole Republican state Senator, was defeated in his bid for reelection) to 2018, the Democratic Party held all 25 seats in the Hawaii Senate. This made the Hawaii Senate the only state legislative chamber with no opposition members (this excludes the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature). It was the first time since 1980 (when both the Alabama Senate and Louisiana Senate were all-Democratic) that any state legislative chamber had been completely dominated by a single party.

==Capitol==
The Hawaiʻi State Senate has been meeting at the Hawaiʻi State Capitol in downtown Honolulu since March 15, 1969. Previous to the decision of Governor John A. Burns to build the new Capitol building, the Hawaiʻi State Senate met in ʻIolani Palace.

<text>Dammbach () is a municipality in the Aschaffenburg district in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Lower Franconia (&quot;Unterfranken&quot;) in Bavaria, Germany, and a member of the &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; (municipal association) of Mespelbrunn, whose seat is in Heimbuchenthal.

==Geography==

===Location===
The municipality lies in the centre of the Spessart (range), in the so-called High Spessart (&quot;Hochspessart&quot;). The namesake brook, the Dammbach, rises near Rohrbrunn and has many small tributaries.

As for elevation extremes, the municipality&#x27;s lowest point lies in the constituent municipality of Neuhammer at 200 m above sea level, and the highest on the Geishöhe at 525 m.

===Subdivision===
The municipality of Dammbach contains several small hamlets such as Schnorrhof, Hundsrück, Heppe and Oberwintersbach.

==History==
In 1991, the municipality celebrated the festival “750 years of villages in the Dammbach valley”.

===Amalgamations===
The municipality came into being in 1976 in the course of municipal restructuring in Bavaria out of the formerly self-administering communities of Wintersbach and Krausenbach. Since both constituent communities were in the Dammbach valley (&quot;Dammbachtal&quot; in German), Dammbach was chosen as the new name.

==Economy==

In the last few years, the municipality of Dammbach has opened up a weekend neighbourhood near the constituent municipality of Wintersbach in which more than 100 weekend and holiday homes have been built.

Since 1 December 2006, the municipality of Dammbach has been levying a tax on second homes.

==Governance==
===municipality council===

The council is made up of 14 council members, not counting the mayor.

(as at municipal election held on 3 March 2008)

===Coat of arms===
The municipality&#x27;s arms might be described thus: In chief above a bar wavy argent enhanced, gules an acorn in pale surmounted by two oakleaves in saltire of the first, the base party per pale, dexter barry of eight gules and Or, sinister azure a bend sinister argent surmounted by three rings azure.

Dammbach is a very new municipality, having arisen only in 1976 out of the formerly self-administering communities of Wintersbach and Krausenbach through voluntary merger. Geographically it lies on the Dammbach, whence its name comes. This brook has as a reference to it the wavy bar in the municipality&#x27;s arms. The oakleaves and acorn in the chief symbolize the municipality&#x27;s location in the High Spessart. Below the wavy bar on the dexter (armsbearer&#x27;s right, viewer&#x27;s left) side, the red and gold bars are taken from the arms formerly borne by the Counts of Rieneck. Krausenbach was for a long time one of their holdings. The bend sinister on the sinister (armsbearer&#x27;s left, viewer&#x27;s right) side with the rings is taken from the arms formerly borne by the family Echter von Mespelbrunn. They held the lordship over Wintersbach, building a church there in 1415 and a hospital in 1584.

The arms were conferred on 22 July 1988.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===
In Dammbach is found the air navigation beacon “PSA” of an international airway.

<text>Mount Eisenhower, formerly Mount Pleasant, is a mountain in the Presidential Range in the White Mountains of New Hampshire approximately high. Named after President Dwight D. Eisenhower, its summit offers a 360° view. It is inaccessible by road.

The Crawford Path, carrying the Appalachian Trail, crosses the mountain near its summit. It separates from the summit loop trail at , south of the summit, and rejoins it northeast of the summit, having made a net elevation gain of about and reached a maximum on Eisenhower of about .

The mountain was known as Mount Pleasant until the New Hampshire Legislature voted in 1969 to name it after President Eisenhower, and the U.S. Board on Geographic Names agreed in 1970.

The shortest trail route to the summit of Eisenhower is from a parking lot on Mount Clinton Road, to its west-northwest, via primarily the Edmands Path. Several routes are available from points more or less southwest of it on Route 302; the most used of these (probably roughly equal in popularity to the Edmands route) is via the Crawford Path, starting from a parking lot on Mount Clinton Road, very near 302 and just north of the Highland Center in the Crawford Notch area. Mount Monroe lies on the ridge northeast of Mt. Eisenhower, and Mount Pierce to the southwest. All three of these peaks are included on the peak-bagging list of four-thousand footers in New Hampshire. Mount Franklin, an &quot;unofficial&quot; peak (not prominent enough to be included in the list), lies between Mount Eisenhower and Mount Monroe.

<doc id="798068" wikidata="Q215423" url="?curid=798068" title="Saint Isaac's Cathedral">
<text>Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral () is a large architectural landmark cathedral that currently functions as a museum with occasional church services in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It is dedicated to Saint Isaac of Dalmatia, a patron saint of Peter the Great, who had been born on the feast day of that saint. It was originally built as a cathedral but was turned into a museum by the Soviet government in 1931 and has remained a museum ever since, with church services held in a side chapel since the 1990s. In 2017, the Governor of Saint Petersburg offered to transfer the cathedral back to the Russian Orthodox Church, but this was not accomplished due to the protests of St Petersburg citizens opposing the offer.

== History ==

The church on St Isaac&#x27;s Square was ordered by Tsar Alexander I, to replace an earlier structure by Vincenzo Brenna, and was the fourth consecutive church standing at this place. A specially appointed commission examined several designs, including that of the French-born architect Auguste de Montferrand (1786–1858), who had studied in the atelier of Napoleon&#x27;s designer, Charles Percier. Montferrand&#x27;s design was criticised by some members of the commission for the dry and allegedly boring rhythm of its four identical pedimented octastyle porticos. It was also suggested that despite gigantic dimensions, the edifice would look squat and not very impressive. The members of the commission, which consisted of well-known Russian architects, were also particularly concerned by necessity to build a new huge building on the old unsecure foundation. The emperor, who favoured the ponderous Empire style of architecture, had to step in and solve the dispute in Montferrand&#x27;s favour.

The cathedral took 40 years to construct, under Montferrand&#x27;s direction, from 1818 to 1858. To secure the construction, the cathedral&#x27;s foundation was strengthened by driving 25,000 piles into the fenland of Saint Petersburg. Innovative methods were created to erect the giant columns of the portico. The construction costs of the cathedral totalled an incredible sum of 1 000 000 gold rubles. Under the Soviet government, the building was stripped of religious trappings. In 1931, it was turned into the Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism, the dove sculpture was removed, and replaced by a Foucault pendulum. On 12 April 1931, the first public demonstration of the Foucault pendulum was held to visualize Copernicus&#x27;s theory. In 1937, the museum was transformed into the museum of the cathedral, and former collections were transferred to the Museum of the History of Religion (located in the Kazan Cathedral).

During World War II, the dome was painted over in gray to avoid attracting attention from enemy aircraft. On its top, in the skylight, a geodesical intersection point was placed, to determine the positions of German artillery batteries.

With the fall of communism, the museum was removed and regular worship activity has resumed in the cathedral, but only in the left-hand side chapel. The main body of the cathedral is used for services on feast days only.

On 10 January 2017 Georgy Poltavchenko, the governor of St. Petersburg, announced that the cathedral would be transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church . The key protocols of the transfer were defined by the order issued by St. Petersburg&#x27;s Committee on Property Relations on 30 December 2016. The document expired on 30 December 2018. The new order can be issued upon request from the Russian Orthodox Church, but no such request has yet been submitted..

The transfer of Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral in use the ROC agreed in January 2017, but the decision has caused discontent of the townspeople, who defended the status of the museum. The decision of the city authorities was disputed in the courts. Currently, the status of the building is museum. Today, church services are held here only on ecclesiastical occasions.

On 1 October 2021, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia and Victoria Romanovna Bettarini married at the cathedral in the first royal wedding to take place in Russia since 1917.

== Exterior ==
The neoclassical exterior expresses the traditional Russian-Byzantine formula of a Greek-cross ground plan with a large central dome and four subsidiary domes. It is similar to Andrea Palladio&#x27;s Villa Capra &quot;La Rotonda&quot;, with a full dome on a high drum substituted for the Villa&#x27;s low central saucer dome. The design of the cathedral in general and the dome in particular later influenced the design of the United States Capitol dome, Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin, and the Lutheran Cathedral in Helsinki.

The exterior is faced with gray and pink stone, and features a total of 112 red granite columns with Corinthian capitals, each hewn and erected as a single block: 48 at ground level, 24 on the rotunda of the uppermost dome, 8 on each of four side domes, and 2 framing each of four windows. The rotunda is encircled by a walkway accessible to tourists. 24 statues stand on the roof, and another 24 on top of the rotunda. The columns were made in &lt;bdi&gt;Pyterlahti quarry in Virolahti, Finland&lt;/bdi&gt;

== Dome ==

The cathedral&#x27;s main dome rises ; its exterior is gilded. The dome is decorated with twelve statues of angels by Josef Hermann. These angels were likely the first large sculptures produced by the then novel process of electrotyping, which was an alternative to traditional bronze casting of sculptures. Montferrand&#x27;s design of the dome is based on a supporting cast iron structure. It was the third historical instance of cast iron cupola after the Leaning Tower of Nevyansk (1732) and Mainz Cathedral (1826).

With an internal height of 69 m (from the floor to the level of the oculus), it ranks among the tallest domes in the world.

== Interior ==

The cathedral&#x27;s bronze doors, covered in reliefs by Ivan Vitali, are patterned after the celebrated doors of the Battistero di San Giovanni in Florence, designed by Lorenzo Ghiberti. Suspended underneath the peak of the dome is a sculpted white dove representing the Holy Spirit. Internal features such as columns, pilasters, floor, and statue of Montferrand are composed of multicolored granites and marbles gathered from all parts of Russia. The iconostasis is framed by eight columns of semiprecious stone: six of malachite and two smaller ones of lazurite. The four pediments are also richly sculpted.

The interior was originally decorated with scores of paintings by Karl Bryullov and other great Russian masters of the day. When these paintings began to deteriorate due to the cold, damp conditions inside the cathedral, Montferrand ordered them to be painstakingly reproduced as mosaics, a technique introduced in Russia by Mikhail Lomonosov. This work was never completed.

== Technologies ==

William Handyside and other engineers used a number of technological innovations in the construction of the building. The portico columns were raised with the use of large wooden frameworks before the walls were erected. The building rests on 10,000 tree trunks that were sunk by a large number of workers into the marshy banks upon which the cathedral is situated. The dome was gilded by a technique similar to spraypainting; the solution used included toxic mercury, the vapors of which caused the deaths of sixty workers. The dozen gilded statues of angels, each six metres tall, facing each other across the interior of the rotunda, were constructed using galvanoplastic technology, making them only millimeters thick and very lightweight. St. Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral represents the first use of this technique in architecture.

The meticulous and painstakingly detailed work on constructing the St. Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral took 40 years to complete. This extended construction left an expression in the Finnish language, &quot;&quot; (&quot;to build like St. Isaac&#x27;s Church&quot;), for lengthy and never-ending megaprojects.

===Official coat of arms===
According to a grant of 1590, the office of Regius Professor of &quot;Devinity&quot; at Cambridge has a coat of arms with the following blazon:

==Professors at Dublin==
The Regius Professor of Divinity at Trinity College Dublin was established in 1607 as the &quot;Professor of Theological Controversies&quot;. The endowment was increased in 1674 by letters patent of Charles II. The title &quot;Regius Professor&quot; was specified in 1761 by letters patent of George III. The School of Divinity was founded in the late 18th century with the Regius Professor as its head. The School&#x27;s link to the Church of Ireland was controversial after the Irish Church Act 1869 disestablished the church and the University of Dublin Tests Act 1873 allowed non-Anglican fellows. The debate became dormant after 1911 letters patent altered the School&#x27;s governance. It reignited in the 1960s, after which vacancies in the School of Divinity went unfilled, including the Regius Professorship in 1982. The School of Divinity was replaced in 1978–81 by a non-denominational School of Hebrew, Biblical and Theological Studies (renamed the Department of Religions and Theology in 2004) although the statutes mandating a School and Regius Professor of Divinity remain unrepealed.

<doc id="798084" wikidata="Q17115852" url="?curid=798084" title="Fault (breeding)">
<text>In animal breed standards, a fault is an aspect of appearance or temperament that is considered detrimental to the breed type of the animal&#x27;s breed. In dogs, faults have to do with the externally observable qualities of the dog such as appearance, movement, and temperament. Qualities separately tested such as tests for ability in specific work or sports, tests for genetic health, tests for general health or specific inherited disease, or any other specific tests for characteristics that cannot be directly observed are not referred to as &quot;faults&quot;. Minor faults may or may not have anything to do with the individual dog&#x27;s ability to work or suitability as a pet.

==Defining specific faults==
Faults are formally defined in reference to the breed standard of the specific dog breed, and, due to the extreme variability of the dog (&quot;Phenotypic variation among dog breeds, whether it be in size, shape, or behavior, is greater than for any other animal&quot;), a single set of faults cannot be generically described for all dog breeds. Wikipedia articles for individual breeds should describe what are considered faults in that particular breed.

==Purpose and use==
&quot;Faults&quot; are evaluated as part of the judging process in conformation shows. As the purpose of conformation shows is to assist breeders in the selection of breeding stock by rewarding with championships the dogs which, through &quot;external observation only&quot;, are the best representatives of the breed, major faults or an excess of minor faults would prevent a dog from completing a championship and being bred. Faults may or may not interfere with the individual dog&#x27;s working ability, or its qualities as a pet. Current advances in genetic testing are also used by responsible breeders in selecting breeding stock, in addition to visual evaluations by a judge in the conformation ring, although genetic testing and other tests are outside the scope of the written breed standard.

==Major and minor faults==
Faults may be either &quot;major faults&quot; (preventing the dog from being shown in the conformation ring or being bred by responsible breeders) or &quot;minor faults&quot;, such as coat texture, that can easily be corrected by careful breeding of the next generation. A major fault would be a breed type fault &quot;which diminishes the overall look of the breed.&quot; Another major fault would be visible structural problems of the dog that prevent the animal from doing the type of work for which it was bred. Dogs that run with great speed use the flexibility of their back; a back that is too arched or too flat will restrict the dog&#x27;s speed, and would be seen as a fault. Other major faults may involve temperament; &quot;Aggressive behaviour is a serious temperament fault in a Lab.&quot;

== Interpretation of the standards ==
Since dogs have enormous variation in their appearance, what is or is not considered desirable or undesirable depends on the individual breed&#x27;s appearance and historical background (what kind of work it was bred to do). Individual breed clubs, whose members write the breed standard for their breed, decide which aspects of appearance and temperament that breeders should work towards eliminating in the breed. Those undesirable aspects of appearance and temperament are called &quot;faults&quot;. What constitutes a fault may differ from breed to breed. For example, an aloof and somewhat aggressive temperament might be suitable for a livestock guardian dog, but would be a completely unacceptable fault in a lap dog. Faults may be serious enough to require disqualification in a conformation show, eliminating the dog from winning a championship in conformation, or they may be minor, to be measured by the judge against the dog&#x27;s good qualities.

Some breed standards are punctilious in the extreme, spelling out exactly what constitutes a fault in every part of the animal, and the degree to which each fault must be penalized. Some are more loosely written, leaving more open to interpretation by the judge, or not describing an attribute at all, which leaves the matter up to the individual judge&#x27;s opinion. Some breed standards states that a particular fault is to be penalized to the degree of the severity of the fault, leaving the exact determination up to the judge. Definitions which are open to human interpretation cause much ill-will at conformation shows when exhibitors disagree with the decision of the judge, despite the fact that the fanciers hire the judges and pay entry fees for the judge&#x27;s opinion of their breeding stock.

For example, most breed standards list a ‘scissor bite’ as the correct one. A level bite, an under-bite or an overbite may be considered &quot;faults&quot;, depending on the breed standard description. In a conformation show, the judge must decide the degree of severity of the faulty bite, and therefore how much the dog must be marked down in relation to other dogs. However, some breed standards describe only a level bite as acceptable; other breed standards accept the scissor bite. The all-breed judge must know which bite is or is not a fault for each breed that he or she judges.

A given coat colour may be acceptable, it may be preferred, it may be the only acceptable colour, or it may be a &quot;fault&quot;. Sometimes these colours change over time, often after much in-fighting and bitterness.For many years, the only acceptable coat pattern in a Dalmatian was white with black spots, very recently liver spots have been accepted as a variant, but black still appears to be the preference of most. However, other colors like with lemon, blue, brindle and tricolor spots are disqualified. A black German Shepherd Dog is penalized; a white GSD is disqualified, as the color is believed to be linked to deafness and other serious health problems. Many GSD fanciers like the white colour and continue to breed for the white coat; some lobby for its acceptance into the breed standard, others argue for the creation of a new breed. In the future, genetic testing may show which of these variants in color are actually linked to health problems and which are not, which may lead to modification of the breed standards. Other breeds such as the Flat-coated Retriever only black and liver are acceptable, but yellow is a disqualification.

== Working dogs ==

The breed standards for working dogs usually specify that scars, broken teeth or other damage that evidence injuries sustained during a working career (often termed ‘honourable scars and injuries&#x27;) are not to be penalized in conformation showing. The Australian Cattle Dog is an example of this as are some terriers, where the breed standards specifically state that scars are not to be penalized as faults in conformation.

Details of breed standards and precise definition of faults are decided upon by breed clubs and are often hotly debated. Sometimes even minute details are argued over by fanciers and breeders to a degree that would astound the average pet owner who never plans on breeding his or her pet. Fanciers note that such irrelevant seeming qualities have the capacity to change the breed over time.

Often it is the breeders of working dogs who are the most vehement, pointing out that changes in fashion and fancy have led to what they see as a loss in working dog qualities of many breed that have show lines, through rewarding of external appearance without requirements for work. In some breed clubs, such as the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, working ability and health are valued over conformation to the breed standard. However, even in the JRTCA breed standard only externally observed aspects of the dog are described, as working tests and genetic tests are beyond the scope of a breed standard, which exists as a description of the dog, not its DNA.

<doc id="798085" wikidata="Q1423613" url="?curid=798085" title="Medjay">
<text>Medjay (also &quot;Medjai&quot;, &quot;Mazoi&quot;, &quot;Madjai&quot;, &quot;Mejay&quot;, Egyptian &quot;mḏꜣ.j&quot;, a nisba of &quot;mḏꜣ&quot;) was a demonym used in various ways throughout ancient Egyptian history to refer initially to a nomadic group from Nubia and later as a generic term for desert-ranger police.
They were sometimes confused with the Pan-Grave culture.

==Origins==
The first mention of the Medjay in written records dates back to the Old Kingdom of Egypt, when they were listed among other Nubian peoples in the &quot;Autobiography of Weni&quot;, who was at the time a general serving under Pepi I Meryre (reigned 2332–2287 BCE). During this time the term &quot;Medjay&quot; referred to people from the land of Medja, a district thought to be located just east of the Second Nile Cataract in Nubia. Nubia was referred to as Ta-Seti, meaning &quot;Land of the bow&quot;, by the Egyptians and the people there (including the Medjay) were renowned for their military skills, particularly as archers. A decree from Pepi I Meryre&#x27;s reign, which lists different officials (including an Overseer of the Medja, Irtjet, and Satju, i.e. of the various Nubian groups), illustrates that Medja was at least to some extent subjugated by the Egyptian government. Since the time of Alan Gardiner, a common account has been that the Medjay constituted an ethnic group. More recent work suggests that the term was initially an Egyptian exonym. Those identified as Medjay may not have considered themselves a shared ethnicity and certainly were not a unified polity.

Written accounts from the Middle Kingdom, such as the &quot;Semna Despatches&quot;, describe the Medjay as nomadic desert people. Egyptian sources are inconsistent in distinguishing between Nubian people generally and Medjay until the latter portion of the Middle Kingdom. Senusret III (r. 1878-1839 BCE) enacted a prohibition on Nubian movement north of Semna, which is recorded in missives from the border guard at Elephantine.
At the same time, the administration began making a distinction between these two categories of people. Kate Liszka hypothesizes this may have motivated people to take on Medjay as an ethnic identity.

They also were sometimes employed as soldiers (as we know from the stele of Res and Ptahwer). During the Second Intermediate Period, they were even used during Kamose&#x27;s campaign against the Hyksos and became instrumental in making the Egyptian state into a military power. The Medjay were also hired as soldiers and guards in the Kushite military as well as the Roman Egypt army.

== Pan-graves ==
In the archaeological record, a culture known as the Pan-Grave culture is generally considered by experts to represent the Medjay. This culture is named for its distinctive circular graves, found throughout Lower Nubia and Upper Egypt, which date to the late Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period (1800-1550 BC). The sudden appearance of these graves in the Nile Valley suggests that they represent an immigrant population, while the presence of &quot;Nerita&quot; shells in many of them suggests their occupants came from the Eastern Desert between the Nile and the Red Sea. Other objects commonly found in these graves include the painted skulls of various horned animals, which are found either arranged in a circle around the burial pit or placed in separate offering pits.

==Police force==
By the Eighteenth Dynasty during the New Kingdom, the Medjay were an elite paramilitary police force. No longer did the term refer to an ethnic group, and over time the new meaning became synonymous with policing in general. As an elite force, the Medjay were often used to protect valuable areas, especially areas of pharaonic interest like capital cities, royal cemeteries, and the borders of Egypt. Though they are best known for their protection of the royal palaces and tombs in Thebes and the surrounding areas, the Medjay were used throughout Upper and Lower Egypt. Each regional unit had its own captains. Chiefs of the Medjay are also known from the New Kingdom, but that title is more likely to refer to a person in charge of building and building material procurement.

At first, the group just consisted of ethnic Medjay and those descended from that ancient tribal group. This changed over time as more and more Egyptians took up their occupation. Records show that various Medjay chiefs and captains had Egyptian names and were depicted as such. Why this change occurred is not known, but it is assumed that, because of the Medjay&#x27;s elite status, Egyptians joined them.

==Demise==
After the 20th Dynasty, the term Medjay is no longer found in Egyptian records. It is unknown whether the Medjay as an occupation had been abolished or the name of the force had changed. However, there is speculation that a group of people called the Meded who fought against the Kush during the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. might have been related to the Medjay.

==Language==
Linguistic evidence indicates that the Medjay spoke an ancient Cushitic language related to the Cushitic Beja language and that the Blemmyes were a subdivision of the Medjay. Rilly (2019) mentions historical records of a powerful Cushitic speaking group which controlled Lower Nubia and some cities in Upper Egypt. He claims a linguistic relationship between the modern Beja language and the ancient Cushitic Blemmyan language, which dominated Lower Nubia, and that the Blemmyes could be regarded as a particular tribe of the Medjay.

==Cultural depictions==
In the 1999 remake &quot;The Mummy&quot;, and the sequel &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001). the Medjay are mentioned as Pharaoh Seti I&#x27;s personal bodyguards in ancient Egypt. 

In the 2017 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins&quot;, the protagonist, Bayek of Siwa, is considered &quot;the last Medjay&quot;.
In the game, the Medjay are depicted as a police force whose job is to protect the pharaoh. However, Bayek abandons his duty when he learns that the pharaoh Ptolemy XIII is an ally to a dark and mysterious organization called &quot;The Order of the Ancients&quot; 
which is responsible for the death of his son.

In the 2020 graphic novel &quot;20s A Difficult Age: The Blue Madjai&quot;, by Marcus Orelias, the protagonist of the series goes by the moniker &quot;the Blue Madjai&quot;.

In the 2017 video game &quot;For Honor&quot;, in the July 2022 &quot;Curse of the Scarab: Title Update 2&quot; software update, a playable character named for and inspired by the Medjay was released.

In the 2021 video game &quot;Forewarned&quot;, 1-4 players explore ancient Egyptian tombs and gather evidence to identify the evil &quot;Medjai&quot; haunting the area, and can perform elaborate hidden rituals to banish them to the Egyptian afterlife. In this game, &quot;Medjay&quot;, or &quot;Medjai&quot; are depicted as malevolent undead spirits.
