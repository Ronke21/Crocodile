<text>Nick at Nite (stylized as nick@nite since 2009) is an American nighttime programming block on Nickelodeon. The block&#x27;s programming broadcasts from prime time to late night, with the airtime varying depending on the night. The block initially consisted of syndicated sitcoms and films from the 1950s to the 1970s. Nick at Nite gradually shifted its programming to primarily airing sitcoms as recent as the mid-1990s to the 2010s. The block was launched on July 1, 1985, and it replaced A&amp;E on Nickelodeon&#x27;s channel space after it spun off into its own 24-hour channel. The block launched present-day TV Land in 1996. The Nickelodeon Group, a division of Paramount Global&#x27;s networks unit, generally regards Nick at Nite as a separate channel that shares space with Nickelodeon on the channel due to the block targeting adult audiences. Nielsen has reported Nick at Nite ratings separately from Nickelodeon since 2004. 

== History ==
=== Early years ===
In 1984, A&amp;E Networks (a joint venture between Hearst, NBC, and ABC) announced their plans to spin off A&amp;E into a separate 24-hour cable channel. Nickelodeon&#x27;s general manager, Geraldine Laybourne, was asked by MTV Networks President Bob Pittman to develop programming for the vacated time slot. This was to take advantage of valuable satellite time as A&amp;E was moving to its own channel. Laybourne sought the help of programming and branding consultants Alan Goodman and Fred Seibert of Fred/Alan Inc. – who were previously successful in MTV and Nickelodeon&#x27;s extensive 1984 rebranding – to come up with new programming ideas. The transition to a 24-hour broadcast for Nickelodeon took place in June, with some cable providers substituting the primetime schedule of other niche-interest networks onto the channel space. 

After being presented with over 200 episodes of &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; (a 1950s sitcom which Laybourne despised), Goodman and Seibert conceived the idea of the &quot;first oldies TV network.&quot; They modeled the new evening and overnight programming block on the successful oldies radio format &quot;The Greatest Hits of All Time&quot; and branded the block with their next evolution of MTV- and Nickelodeon-style imagery and bumpers. Head programmer Debby Beece led the team to the name &quot;Nick at Nite&quot; for the new block; a logo originally conceived for the block was based on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;pinball&quot; logo introduced in 1981, which was discontinued with that network&#x27;s rebrand. Fred/Alan developed the original logo with Tom Corey and Scott Nash of Boston advertising agency Corey McPherson Nash, creators of the well-recognized Nickelodeon orange splat logo (Nick at Nite&#x27;s logo design would maintain a separate, yet similar visual appearance and design from its parent network).
Nick at Nite debuted at 8 p.m. Eastern Time on July 1, 1985 as a block on Nickelodeon. Its initial programming (running from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., seven nights a week) was a mixture of sitcoms, movies, and one drama series. The block was led by &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, and accompanied by &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, the offbeat comedy &quot;Turkey Television&quot; (which, like &quot;Dennis&quot;, also aired on Nickelodeon), and &quot;Route 66&quot;. A nightly film presentation, branded as the &quot;Nick at Nite Movie&quot;, aired at 9 p.m. ET through the end of the decade, and included such classic films as the 1947 film &quot;The Red House&quot; and the 1937 film &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. The same five-hour block of programs originally repeated from 1 a.m. and ran until Nickelodeon began its broadcast day at 6 a.m. ET. As Nick at Nite grew, it would add to its library of shows expanding out to rerun sketch comedy, such as episodes from the early seasons of &quot;SNL&quot; as well as the Canadian series &quot;SCTV&quot;. It also briefly reran the 1970s mock local talk show &quot;Fernwood 2 Night&quot;. As the years went by, the channel&#x27;s sitcom library expanded to over a hundred shows.

By the early 1990s, Nick at Nite began running a full schedule of programming, with overnight hours filled with a mixture of secondary runs of shows airing on its evening schedule and series that were no longer shown on the evening lineup. In 1995, Nick at Nite celebrated its tenth anniversary with a week-long event, in which the channel aired &quot;hand-picked episodes&quot; of almost every series that had aired on Nick at Nite since its July 1985 debut. Each episode was introduced with its milestone history, episode number, and pop culture references to the individual program&#x27;s original run on Nick at Nite. A special tenth Anniversary on-screen bug was shown at the bottom left corner of the screen for 10 seconds once per half-hour show, and was used for the entire 1995 year, much in the same vein as the 20th Anniversary logo in 2005 (in contrast, Nick at Nite did not make any acknowledgment of its 25th anniversary in 2010). The block launched a network in 1996 known as Nick at Nite&#x27;s TV Land, which in 1997 rebranded to just TV Land.

=== 2004–present ===

In March 2004, Nielsen began splitting up Nick at Nite and Nickelodeon in its primetime and total daytime ratings reports, due to the different programming, advertisers and target audiences between the two services; this caused controversy among executives of some cable channels who believed that this move manipulated the ratings, given that Nick at Nite&#x27;s broadcast day takes up only a fraction of Nickelodeon&#x27;s programming schedule. Nickelodeon&#x27;s and Nick at Nite&#x27;s respective ratings periods encompass only the hours they each operate under the total day rankings, though Nick at Nite is rated only for the primetime ratings; this is due to a ruling by Nielsen in July 2004 that networks have to program for 51% or more of a particular daypart to qualify for ratings for that daypart. For the channel&#x27;s 20th anniversary celebration in June 2005, TV Land aired an episode from almost every series that had appeared on Nick at Nite.
On January 1, 2007, the coloring of Nick at Nite&#x27;s logo was changed from blue to orange, in order to match the coloring of Nickelodeon&#x27;s logo. On September 3, 2007, the network introduced a new logo based on Nickelodeon&#x27;s longtime &quot;splat&quot; logo, with the orange &quot;splat&quot; formed in the shape of a waning gibbous moon – this effectively integrated the Nickelodeon branding onto Nick at Nite for the first time, as the varied logos that were used from its 1985 launch utilized variants of the Futura Condensed font (the 1984 to 2009 Nickelodeon logo designed by Seibert and Goodman used the Balloon typeface) with various shape backgrounds and a small circle with the word &quot;at&quot; (replaced by an &quot;@&quot; symbol overlaid on a circle background on July 1, 2002 for visual symmetry, owing to the character&#x27;s building ubiquity from the Internet and eventually into general pop culture) lodged between and staggering the &quot;I&quot;″s. The updated logo debuted in promos on July 1, 2002. However, the Up Next bumpers, station idents, and on-screen bug did not begin using the updated logo until August 2002.

On July 5, 2009, Nick at Nite’s programming hours expanded to begin at 8 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time on Sunday through Thursday nights, while the Friday lineup continued to start at 10 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time (sometimes on Friday nights, it actually began at 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, or still at 8 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, but outside of that, the Friday lineup still had a 10 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time start time, until October 2009, when the Friday start time became 9 p.m.) (the Saturday lineup also continues to have a 10 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time start time due to the presence of the long-running Saturday primetime comedy lineup on Nickelodeon). Nick at Nite&#x27;s times of operation have changed several times over the years, to at one point (between 1998 and 2000) beginning as late as 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time on Sunday through Thursdays and ending as early as 5:30 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time.
Nick at Nite overhauled its on-air appearance on September 28, 2009, as part of Nickelodeon&#x27;s rebranding effort – the new logo, also based on Nickelodeon&#x27;s logo, stylized the network&#x27;s name as &quot;nick@nite&quot; (rendered as one word in lower case letters within the new network logo). The network also ceased airing the production closing credits for most of its programs (except for those that have tag scenes during the end credits, and originally some series that aired on the network prior to the rebrand that rejoined the network afterward, such as &quot;Full House&quot;) and began employing network-even closing credits – which Nickelodeon had been utilizing since at least 2000 (both Nick at Nite and Nickelodeon often remove end tag scenes or blooper reels of some shows using this format).

== Programming ==

Nick at Nite&#x27;s lineup presently includes reruns of syndicated comedy series from the early 1990s to mid-2010s and movie broadcasts. The block previously had its own exclusively-produced original programs (such as &quot;See Dad Run&quot; and &quot;Instant Mom&quot;).

Due to its dependence on sitcom reruns whose cable syndication rights are limited to a daypart (a certain part of the day) owing to contracts with studios and/or distributors (for instance, Paramount holds the exclusive cable nighttime rights to run &quot;Friends&quot;, airing it on both Nick at Nite and Comedy Central, while TBS holds exclusive daytime rights to said series), Nick at Nite has no video on demand service or Paramount+ presence (formerly its past original series were usually combined within Nickelodeon&#x27;s video-on-demand section) and its website features no video content.

=== Programming history ===
Nick at Nite was known as the &quot;first classic TV network,&quot; having originally aired older classic television programs from the 1950s through the early 1970s throughout its nighttime schedule. The time range of Nick at Nite&#x27;s programming has shifted over the years, to the point whereby the early 2000s, its classic series consisted primarily of shows from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, and also included series from the early and mid-2000s by the end of that decade and into the early 2010s. The early success with classic television series, as well as the eventual shift away from series made prior to 1985, eventually led to the creation of digital broadcast networks similar to Nick at Nite&#x27;s original format such as the Retro Television Network, Antenna TV and MeTV (which have featured many shows formerly seen on Nick at Nite).

Nick at Nite airs approximately all of its programming in hour-long (and sometimes two-hour) blocks, which were branded under the &quot;Double Takes&quot; banner from 2002 to 2007; typically series that air back-to-back are scheduled in two blocks, one in primetime and one in late night. Also typically, series that have been airing on Nick at Nite for at least three years are often moved exclusively to the overnight schedule in order to make room for newly acquired series (though in the past, entire broadcast runs of a few series such as &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; and &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; have aired in an overnight graveyard slot for a short period of time following their debut on the network). For about a year-and-a-half prior to the September 28, 2009 rebrand, Nick at Nite aired marathons of programming from midnight to 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Nick at Nite was previously one of the few basic cable channels in the United States that continued to sign off for scheduled satellite maintenance, occurring on a Wednesday morning from 5:30 to 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a bi-monthly basis, with color bars being displayed during the sign-off period (Paramount Global-owned sister channels Nick Jr., Nicktoons, MTV and its spin-off channels, VH1, and VH1 Classic also sign off for a half-hour on a bi-monthly basis at the same time as Nick at Nite for the same reason); it is also one of only a handful of cable channels to have discontinued airing infomercials. Nickelodeon (through Nick at Nite) ran infomercials in some overnight time slots from 1987 to 1998 (making Nickelodeon one of the few currently operating kids-targeted channels to discontinue airing paid programming, others include Universal Kids, and it is also only one of two Paramount-owned networks to have removed paid programming from its schedule; sister channel BET had discontinued infomercials in 1997, replacing them with religious programming in overnight/early morning time slots).

On May 16, 2011, Nick at Nite began scheduling programs airing from 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time in an &quot;off-the-clock&quot; format, in which the network runs extended commercial breaks of as much as seven minutes in length to allow additional advertising spots (a method that has tense viewer criticism due to the length between the start of each commercial break and the start of the next segment of a program), allowing the programs to be broadcast in a longer time slot each half-hour until 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time, when start times return to a half-hourly format. This format was originated by sister network TV Land beginning in 2010, and has since been taken by other Paramount Global networks including MTV, BET and Paramount Network around the same time as Nick at Nite. The side effect that results from this scheduling and expanded advertising is that one full half-hour of programming is lost, therefore the overnight schedule features only a single episode of one series whereas most other Nick at Nite programs air in double episode blocks.

On June 25, 2012, Nick at Nite began airing Nickelodeon programs for the first time, airing reruns of &quot;All That&quot; and &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; from 9:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time weeknights. Two weeks later, the two series were replaced with reruns of &quot;Victorious&quot;, before being replaced by the teen drama/telenovela series &quot;Hollywood Heights&quot;, which would move to TeenNick halfway through its first (and only) season due to low ratings. Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite currently share the 9:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time time slot on weeknights.

=== Movies ===
In addition to running sitcom reruns, Nick at Nite has also broadcast movies in early primetime; after the 1985 to 1989 run of the &quot;Nick at Nite Movie&quot; showcase, the channel did not air movies on its schedule again until the summer of 2007, when it aired films each week on Tuesday nights. The channel has aired films occasionally since then, and have begun to air them periodically since February 2010 on Sunday nights, beginning that month with telecasts of the Nickelodeon Movies-produced &quot;Good Burger&quot;, &quot;Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging&quot;, &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, and &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;. Additionally, many family-oriented films from other distributors air on the block.

Some movies and special presentations that Nick at Nite aired during 2010 and 2011 had occasionally aired over what is normally Nickelodeon&#x27;s broadcast time (for example, the February 21, 2010 premiere broadcast of the special &quot;School Gyrls&quot; aired at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, though Nickelodeon typically does not turn over its channel space to Nick at Nite until 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday nights), which is unusual as some of these special presentations are aimed at Nickelodeon&#x27;s preteen target audience; however until May 2010, when the network began promoting its film broadcasts as airing on Nick at Nite, promos for these films did not acknowledge whether they were to be broadcast on Nick at Nite or Nickelodeon (an issue as promos for scheduled primetime films were cross-promoted with Nickelodeon), with the only reference as to the film&#x27;s airing on Nick at Nite coming from the screen bug that is shown during the film.

Some of the movies Nick at Nite has broadcast in recent years have included the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy, &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, &quot;Baby&#x27;s Day Out&quot;, &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (and its sequel &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;), &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;, &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, and &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;. Film broadcasts have become more common on Nick at Nite since fall 2012, often airing on a near-weekly basis, typically on Sunday evenings.

=== Original programming ===
Nick at Nite has also occasionally broadcast its own programs, sometimes with bizarre and surrealistic results. On December 5, 1987, the channel ran a contest called the &quot;Do It Yourself Sitcom Special&quot;, which was billed as the first time that real people ever had their own television shows. Viewers submitted their own sitcom ideas and the winner would supposedly get their own show. In 1988, the channel aired a half-hour animated Christmas special from Ralph Bakshi, which served as the pilot for a proposed animated series titled &quot;Tattertown&quot;. The program was never picked up to series, but the special, later renamed &quot;Christmas in Tattertown&quot;, aired on Nick at Nite every Christmas for several years. In 1990, the channel briefly aired a satirical comedy series called &quot;On the Television&quot;, a mock critic show hosted by Siskel and Ebert-type characters that featured bizarre, sometimes disturbing clips from spoofed television shows supposedly beginning that week.

In the early 1990s, the channel ran a one-time special featuring old television commercials; this idea would be rehashed by the network on several other shows and eventually become a project of a spin-off channel, TV Land, as part of the &quot;Retromercials&quot; segment that aired during commercial breaks until the mid-2000s. Another special aired by Nick at Nite was promoted as a TV dad quiz, in which the host walked through a &quot;typical TV Home,&quot; and quizzed viewers at home with trivia about classic TV dad clichés. At one point, the host told viewers to connect pictures of TV dads with their appropriate TV wives displayed on the screen with a magic marker. At the end of this segment, he mentions that he forgot to tell the viewers to place a piece of plastic over their screen while doing this and made jokes about the viewers
uselessly trying to clean the magic marker off their screens for the rest of the show.

In 1991, Nick at Nite debuted its own sitcom based around the rerun genre it had developed. The short-lived &quot;Hi Honey, I&#x27;m Home!&quot; (titled after the catchphrase that male lead characters in some classic sitcoms said to their wives when returning home from work) focused on a 1950s sitcom family called the Nielsens, whose show has been removed from syndication, forcing the family to leave TV Land and move into a real 1990s suburban neighborhood, repeatedly confronting the family with a culture shock. The series aired on Fridays as part of ABC&#x27;s &quot;TGIF&quot; lineup, with the episode being &quot;rerun&quot; on Nick at Nite in primetime on the following Sunday.
In 2008, the channel announced that it was developing a family-oriented revival of the 1990s game show &quot;GUTS&quot; titled &quot;My Family&#x27;s Got GUTS&quot;, as well as a dog competition show. &quot;My Family&#x27;s Got GUTS&quot; eventually premiered on Nickelodeon in September 2008. On August 17, 2009, Nick at Nite debuted a new animated stop-motion series called &quot;Glenn Martin DDS&quot;, which ran for two seasons. Scripted programming returned to Nick at Nite in 2012, with the June 11 debut of the telenovela-based teen drama &quot;Hollywood Heights&quot;, followed on October 6 with the premiere of &quot;See Dad Run&quot;, though the former relocated to TeenNick midway through its run due to low ratings and branding confusion.

In 2017, the network also began to carry episodes of &quot;Nashville&quot; on an hour delay from CMT on nights when new episodes aired in order to further augment that series&#x27; ratings.

=== Marathons and blocks ===
Programming marathons were an innovation that began with Nick at Nite in 1985, eventually leading to the phenomenon of &quot;binge-watching&quot;. Working together at college radio station WKCR-FM while attending New York City&#x27;s prestigious Columbia University, Fred/Alan, Inc. founders Alan Goodman and Fred Seibert saw the ratings success of radio marathons featuring music from Ludwig van Beethoven, John Coltrane and Charles Mingus. As the Nick at Nite &quot;oldies&quot; format was adapted from radio, they suggested the multi-hour (sometimes multi-day) marathon might also work with television programming. The marathon format proved successful and became a ratings boosting in demand with cable television networks for over two decades.

During the week of Halloween in late October 1990, the network held a special contest, hosted by game show host Wink Martindale, during a marathon of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. Viewers at home were supposed to keep a running total of total number of deaths on the show. At the end of the marathon, the persons who had gotten the correct total were entered into a drawing to win a prize. As Martindale said, &quot;it&#x27;s kind of like guessing the number of jelly beans in a jelly bean jar, but instead of jelly beans, you&#x27;re using cadavers!&quot;

When new shows are added to the lineup, they are usually accompanied by some kind of marathon that is sometimes hosted by a star from the show. For instance, when &quot;Newhart&quot; joined Nick at Nite in the early 1990s, the channel also acquired Bob Newhart&#x27;s short-lived third sitcom &quot;Bob&quot;, and ran a block branded &quot;Bob&#x27;s Bob, Bob Newhart, Newhart Marathon&quot;, featuring the two shows along with &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; (which it already had the rights to broadcast), in an event hosted by Bob Newhart. Nick at Nite&#x27;s debut of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; was called the &quot;Marython&quot;. When &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; joined Nick at Nite in 1994, a week-long marathon called &quot;Nick at Nite Loves Lucy&quot; aired, showcasing every one of Lucille Ball&#x27;s sitcoms that aired between 1951 and 1986 (&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, and &quot;Life with Lucy&quot;). When some older shows were retired, Nick at Nite would also frequently have a marathon send-off. For instance, when &quot;Mister Ed&quot; was finally retired from the network in January 1993 after a seven-year run, Nick at Nite ran a weekend-long marathon of the show called &quot;Au Revoir Mister Ed!&quot;; a similar send-off for &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, which ran on the channel for nine years beginning with Nick at Nite&#x27;s July 1985 debut, also ran that year. &quot;My Three Sons&quot; was sent off the night Daylight Saving Time ended in October 1991 with a marathon called &quot;Nite of the Setting Sons,&quot; permitting two extra episodes in the marathon due to the one-hour time shift.

During the summer months from the mid-to-late 1990s, the channel for a while ran a program block called &quot;Vertivision&quot; (later known as &quot;Block Party Summer&quot;), during which a different series was shown in a three-hour block each night of the week. In its first year, network promos referred to the nights featured in the special lineup as &quot;Mary Mondays&quot; (for &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;), &quot;Lucy Tuesdays&quot; (for &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;), &quot;&quot;Bewitched&quot; Be-Wednesdays&quot; (for &quot;Bewitched&quot;), &quot;Jeannie Thursdays&quot; (for &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;), and &quot;Sgt. Joe Fridays&quot; (for &quot;Dragnet&quot;). With the passing years, the summer blocks shifted to include series recently added to Nick at Nite&#x27;s program library.

Other seasonal scheduling blocks were also not uncommon such as Christmas-themed blocks during late December, Thanksgiving-themed blocks in November, and Valentine&#x27;s Day-themed episodes in February. Each New Year&#x27;s Eve from 1989 to 1998, the channel would host &quot;Nick at Nite&#x27;s (year) Rerun/Classic TV/TV Hits Countdown&quot; hosted by longtime countdown radio DJ, Casey Kasem. Kasem would spend the period from noon (11:30 a.m. in 1990) until New Year&#x27;s Day at 12:30 a.m. Eastern Time counting down the 25 &quot;most classic&quot; episodes of the series airing on Nick at Nite at that time as determined by viewers at home, with the #1 episode being aired at midnight.

Another well-known lineup was &quot;A Whole Lotta Lucy&quot; block which ran on Saturday nights from June 4, 1994, to May 3, 1996, which consisted of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;, which were all airing on the network at that time (a similar block aired on Saturday nights from 1996 to 2001, featuring only &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;). In the mid-1990s, another Saturday night programming block titled &quot;Very, Very Nick at Nite&quot; centered around a different theme each week, such as &quot;Very Very Mary&quot; with four classic &quot;Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; episodes. In summer of 2008, Nick at Nite aired a marathon called &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot;, which featured episodes of their regular programs that engaged conflict between men and women.

Nick at Nite generally broadcasts a marathon of their programming on holidays (such as the &quot;Luck of the Lopez&quot; marathon of &quot;George Lopez&quot; that aired on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in March 2008). For two years in a row, in October 2007 and 2008, Nick at Nite broadcast the &quot;Shocktober&quot; marathon (branded as &quot;Shocktober 2&quot; for the 2008 event), featuring Halloween-themed episodes of the regularly scheduled program. Other holidays that the network often features themed marathons include Mother&#x27;s Day, Father&#x27;s Day, and Christmas.

On June 17, 2019, Nick at Nite aired a simulcast of the 2019 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards for the first time, along with many of its sister networks. On August 26, it also aired a simulcast of the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards for the first time. In December 2019, Nick at Nite began airing a marathon of &quot;Friends&quot; to celebrate the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary since its finale throughout half of Nick at Nite&#x27;s regular programming time.

On April 18, 2020, Nick at Nite aired a simulcast of &quot;One World: Together at Home&quot;, which was simulcast on multiple networks and platforms.

===Television specials===
Occasionally, episodes of &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; have aired regularly or as marathons during Nick at Nite special events in the 1990s and 2000s. This has also occurred during crossovers with Nickelodeon special programming where the Nickelodeon programming runs into the regular Nick at Nite timeslot. A 30-year reunion special of &quot;Double Dare&quot; aired on November 23, 2016. Regular marathons occur on Nick at Nite. Usually when a show debuts, it receives an all-night or a week-long marathon. Seasonal marathons also occur for holidays such as Valentine&#x27;s Day, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, Mother&#x27;s Day, Father&#x27;s Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

On June 17, 2019, Nick at Nite aired a simulcast of the 2019 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards for the first time, along with many of its sister networks. On August 26, it also aired a simulcast of the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards for the first time. In December 2019, Nick at Nite began airing a marathon of &quot;Friends&quot; to celebrate the show&#x27;s 25 year anniversary since its finale throughout half of Nick at Nite&#x27;s regular programming time. Nick at Nite aired a simulcast of the widely distributed, One World: Together at Home on April 18, 2020.

== Branding and commercials ==
Nick at Nite has used numerous unusual and offbeat commercials, logos and promotions. Alan Goodman and Fred Seibert assembled a team of highly imaginative writers/producers, modeled on their original 1981 creative team that had launched sister channel MTV. The group – which included Scott Webb, Jim Levi, Dave Potorti, Jay Newell, Will McRobb, and Tom Hill – was guided towards creating a series of internal campaigns to emphasize the seeming paradox of a contemporary network setting that programmed reruns from the 1960s and earlier. A series of five &quot;promises&quot; were organized into four 30-second spots each hour, each emphasizing an attribute of the innovative programming format.

In 1986, the channel began running a few different animated 10-second channel identifications (produced by Noyes and Laybourne and the Fred/Alan agency) that were repetitive in creation, but all had vastly different endings (similar to the &quot;watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat&quot; gag from &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;). In one such ID, the first chord of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; would be heard strummed, as a man began to hang up a Nick at Nite logo and common living room objects such as a chair and a television set. Once the man sat down in front of the TV set and clicked the remote control, a bizarre incident would happen, such as a gorilla coming out of the set. Later IDs started with either a woman setting up her backyard behind a &quot;city&quot; background, which was made of cardboard, or a couple setting up their living room. In May 1991, Nick at Nite started running a wide variety of IDs created in association with Pomposello Productions. These were made with almost every imaginable technique from cel animation to stop motion, to original live-action and stock footage. Almost every commercial had a different jingle professing Nick at Nite as being &quot;A TV Viewer&#x27;s Dream&quot; for &quot;the TV generation&quot; and as coming from a place called &quot;TV Land&quot; (&quot;Hello out there, from TV Land!&quot;) and promoting &quot;Better Living Through Television&quot;, although these claims were always somewhat tongue in cheek.

There were also sarcastic promotions created for shows airing on the network: an announcer&#x27;s voiceover would discuss the series, accompanied by clips and music, and sometimes the show&#x27;s theme song. The commercials would use an actor&#x27;s line or expression and take it out of context to create a new subversive meaning. The channel still uses this technique today, although often in a more partial way. A popular take-off of the Michelob Light commercial, &quot;The Nite Belongs to Nick&quot; ran for a short period of time before being discontinued due to copyright issues. One series of promos had Dick Van Dyke (whose eponymous 1960s sitcom was a mainstay of the channel in the 1990s) depicted as &quot;Chairman of Nick at Nite&quot; (this idea was later recycled by one of Nick at Nite&#x27;s sister networks, TeenNick, which depicted actor and television personality Nick Cannon as the &quot;Chairman of TeenNick&quot; in a series of promos that began airing on September 28, 2009). In 1995, in honor of the network&#x27;s tenth anniversary, Nick at Nite aired a tribute to the commercials throughout the network&#x27;s existence and hosted by former network president Rich Cronin.

The channel also had a unique way of informing viewers about the show that was about to air next. Beginning as only some of the night&#x27;s shows and their airtimes being listed as music played over an on-screen graphic, this simple concept would be revised and re-revised many times over. At one point, a television with objects and people from the show scrolling by (for instance, for &quot;Get Smart,&quot; a shoe phone, gun, and Max and 99) would appear on the screen while the announcer describes the program title and time; the time that the show was scheduled to air would be popped up in another box. Some shows were preceded by a bumper showing the following episode&#x27;s number and title. Nick at Nite&#x27;s original continuity announcer was Nickelodeon announcer Wendell Craig; Bill St. James alternated with Wendell before replacing him as the channel&#x27;s primary continuity announcer in 1992 and serving in that capacity until 2007 (except for a short period from March 2001 until September 2002, in which he was replaced with a different Soul Train-esque announcer). Bill has also served as an announcer for the premium channels Showtime, The Movie Channel (both former Viacom sister channels to Nick at Nite), and HBO, among other television clients, as well as serving as the host of the radio shows &quot;Flashback&quot; and &quot;Time Warp&quot; (which focus on classic rock and oldies music).

A few of Nick at Nite&#x27;s promos in the early 1990s involved Dixie the TV Land Pixie promoting Nick at Nite &quot;Brand Reruns&quot;. During this time, the network would also play an interstitial series called &quot;Milkman,&quot; about a milkman who would distribute good advice to customers on his milk delivery route. By 1995, Nick at Nite introduced a new mascot named &quot;Phil&quot;. Phil was seen doing several stunts, such as dressing up as a crab during Block Party Summer bumpers. In an ID usually seen when Nick at Nite signed on, Phil was seen working as technician to &quot;try to get Nick at Nite up and running.&quot; In December 1996, Nick at Nite introduced twelve network IDs directed by Mo Willems which introduced the block&#x27;s CGI mascot &quot;Logobelly&quot;. Logobelly was seen doing various activities and appeared on colorful backgrounds on TV sets interacting with past TV stars watching television sets. Curious Pictures created six more IDs for Nick at Nite featuring &quot;Logobelly&quot; in April 1998 with Toonz and 3D Studio Max software.

Nick at Nite received a rebrand in January 1999 (which was used until March 2001) produced by Scott Stowell and Chip Wass (who previously designed a set of CGI IDs for the network in 1996). The rebrand prominently used the color yellow and shades of blue (which became darker overnight). Nick at Nite&#x27;s IDs at the time typically featured a moving illustration by Chip Wass and either a female voiceover singing a jingle about the network which ended with &quot;Nick at Nite, the place for TV hits&quot; or narration by Bill St. James for overnight IDs.

In March 2001, in an effort to cash-in on the reality-TV boom, Nick at Nite underwent an extensive rebrand with the new theme of &quot;Unreality&quot;, with IDs and bumpers featuring clips from actual events then going to clips from TV shows inspiring the events and then ending with the Nick at Nite logo and slogan &quot;100% Sitcoms, 100% Unreality&quot;. One bumper used during this era had the slogan &quot;All Sitcoms, All Night Long&quot;.

== TV Land ==

On April 29, 1996, Viacom spun off a separate network from Nick at Nite, TV Land (originally branded as &quot;Nick at Nite&#x27;s TV Land&quot; until 1999), which features a variety of rerun programming; the channel is usually carried on the basic tiers of cable, IPTV and satellite providers. On December 17, 2006, TV Land ceased operating under the control of Nick at Nite as Nickelodeon began overseeing that service under the MTV Networks Kids &amp; Family Group, though TV Land continued to be operated as part of Viacom&#x27;s MTV Networks division. During its early years, the channel ran classic television series from the early 1950s to the 1970s. In 2004, TV Land began to incorporate sitcoms from the 1980s and 1990s; reality shows and weekly movie presentations were added as the decade progressed. However, much of TV Land&#x27;s programming continues to include series from the 1960s and 1970s. While in 2017 its original programming efforts were made up of multi-camera sitcoms such as &quot;Younger&quot; and &quot;Teachers&quot; targeted towards a female Generation X audience, in late 2018, the former moved to Paramount Network and the latter was canceled. That decision was eventually reversed, with season 6 premiering in June 2019, and season 7 rolling out in 2021 after being released in bulk on Paramount+ several weeks earlier.

== International ==

Compared to Nickelodeon, the international versions of Nick at Nite are limited, despite the block&#x27;s success in the United States. Most international versions of Nickelodeon either run as a 24-hour channel (such as Asia) or share space with a non-Nick at Nite channel (such as Germany, which had a version of Nick at Nite called &quot;Nicknight,&quot; but replaced it with MTV Plus in 2018, later a timeshift of Comedy Central in 2021). As of 2023, Australia is the only country outside the United States to have a Nick at Nite block.

<doc id="798090" wikidata="Q7980680" url="?curid=798090" title="Welcome to Eltingville">
<text>Welcome to Eltingville is an American adult animated comedy pilot created by Evan Dorkin, as an adaptation of his comic book series &quot;Eltingville&quot;. It premiered in the United States on March 3, 2002, on Cartoon Network&#x27;s late night programming block, Adult Swim, but was not picked up for a full series.

&quot;Welcome to Eltingville&quot; takes place in Eltingville, Staten Island, and focuses on the lives of four teenage boys: Bill Dickey, Josh Levy, Pete DiNunzio and Jerry Stokes, all members of &quot;The Eltingville Club&quot;, who have shared interests in comic books and science fiction, among other things. The pilot is an adaptation of the 1995 &quot;Eltingville&quot; story &quot;&#x27;Bring Me the Head of Boba Fett&quot; in which Bill and Josh get into a fight over a collectible Boba Fett action figure.

==Pilot==
The Eltingville Club&#x27;s members, Bill Dickey, Josh Levy, Pete DiNunzio and Jerry Stokes, get into a fight while playing &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, their commotion wakes up Bill&#x27;s mom who warns them to be quiet. Another fight breaks out shortly when Josh&#x27;s VHS tape which was said to contain bootleg scenes of actresses, really has &quot;The Hair Bear Bunch!&quot; on it. Bill&#x27;s Mom kicks out his friends and Bill kicks Josh out of the club. The next day, Bill awakes from a nightmare which he calls a &quot;freaky premonition,&quot; and decides to let Josh back into the club. After a day on the town, the boys end their day at a comic book shop, where Bill and Josh compete in a trivia contest to win a Kenner 12-inch action figure of Boba Fett. Despite Bill winning, they continue their dispute, wreaking havoc in the process. They both race home to steal their parents&#x27; money, and race back to the store. Bill and Josh present their payments to the clerk, Joe, with a check and credit cards, respectively, but rejects both of them. They resume fighting and end up breaking the action figure. Outraged, Joe kicks all four of them out of the store. Bill angrily walks away with Fett&#x27;s head and leaves Josh with the body as he weeps on the ground, Jerry tells Pete, &quot;Well, if Boba Fett wasn&#x27;t dead before, he sure as hell is now.&quot; Willoughby, a boy from the store, ends the episode by breaking the fourth wall, asking &quot;Is this the end of the Eltingville Club?&quot;

==Production and broadcast==
The pilot episode, &quot;Bring Me the Head of Boba Fett&quot;, was written by Evan Dorkin, storyboarded by Stephen DeStefano, and directed by Chuck Sheetz. It was rated as TV-14 in the United States for comic violence, crude sexual references (including sexualized depictions of women), and moderate offensive language. It was produced by Cartoon Network Studios. Production on the episode was officially completed in October 2001 with animation handled by Tama Production in Tokyo, Japan. The pilot was based on Dorkin&#x27;s time as a comic book store employee at Jim Hanley&#x27;s Universe in Eltingville, Staten Island. The pilot&#x27;s story line was partially based upon the comic story of the same name and the pilot&#x27;s theme opening and closing themes were written and performed by The Aquabats.

Dorkin took a large role in the pilot&#x27;s creation and has since stated that if he could have re-done the episode, he would have chosen to delegate more work and to choose an &quot;Eltingville&quot; story that would show off more of the series&#x27; potential and characters. If the series had been picked up for further episodes or a miniseries, potential plot lines for episodes would have included a &quot;Klingon vs. Elf war&quot; between a local Klingon camp and a Renaissance fair, as well as the club members digging through the Staten Island landfill for a collectible item that was mistakenly thrown out.

The pilot episode was originally aired in the United States on Cartoon Network&#x27;s late night programming block Adult Swim on March 3, 2002, and was originally promoted as a &quot;special&quot; by Adult Swim. It has since been re-aired periodically on Adult Swim since its original premiere, including twice on Halloween night, October 31, 2008, as part of an advertised &quot;Halloween Stunt&quot; night.

<doc id="798097" wikidata="Q1093941" url="?curid=798097" title="Toronto City Hall">
<text>The Toronto City Hall, or New City Hall, is the seat of the municipal government of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and one of the city&#x27;s most distinctive landmarks. Designed by Viljo Revell and engineered by Hannskarl Bandel, the building opened in 1965. The building is located adjacent to Nathan Phillips Square, a public square at the northwest intersection of Bay Street and Queen Street, that was designed and officially opened alongside Toronto City Hall.

Toronto City Hall replaced the neighbouring Old City Hall, which was occupied by the municipal government since 1899 and continues to house municipal offices and courts. The building also served as the seat for the Metropolitan Toronto regional government from 1965 to 1992.

==History==
City leaders had been looking to build a more modern city hall to house its growing municipal government since at least 1943, when a report to city council recommended a new city hall and square in the block bounded by Queen Street West, Bay Street, and Chestnut Street. The recommendation was rejected by the electorate in a referendum on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1947. However, in October 1952, a panel of citizens appointed by city council made the same recommendation. In 1954, leaders selected a partnership of three of Toronto&#x27;s largest architectural firms: Marani and Morris, Mathers and Haldenby, and Shore and Moffat, to create a design. Presented in November 1955, their design proposed a conservative, symmetrical limestone-clad building in the Modernist style facing a landscaped square. Unlike the design that would ultimately be built, it retained the stone Beaux-Arts Registry Office on the western part of the site and also included a landscaped public space in front of it. The podium of the new city hall was to house the council chambers, and was given columns to complement the eight columns of the Registry Building, with which it was aligned across the new public space in front of it.

The scheme was panned by leading architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright (who called it a &quot;sterilization&quot; and &quot;a cliché already dated&quot;) and Walter Gropius (who deemed it a &quot;very poor pseudo-modern design unworthy of the city of Toronto&quot;), and all classes of the University of Toronto Faculty of Architecture co-authored a letter condemning the proposal and calling for an international competition. The whole $18 million proposal was scrapped when voters rejected it in a December 1955 referendum. The parti was adapted by the architects and built as the Imperial Oil Building on St. Clair Avenue West.

===Design competition===
Led by Mayor Nathan Phillips, the Toronto city council decided in 1956 to hold an international competition to choose the new design under terms created by the International Union of Architects. This caused some controversy as some felt the work should be done by a Canadian. Phillips assembled a five-person panel of judges from some of the world&#x27;s greatest architecture experts with Eric Arthur serving as advisor.

By the deadline of April 18, 1958, the committee received over 500 designs from 42 countries from which it selected eight semi-finalists. In September 1958, three judges selected Viljo Revell&#x27;s design, though it almost missed the short list. Eero Saarinen, as member of the panel of five judges, arrived a day and half late and chose Revell&#x27;s design from the other judges&#x27; list of entrants that could summarily be rejected. He convinced two other judges on the panel that Revell&#x27;s unique design should be the winner. One of the two dissenting judges was William Graham Holford, who was skeptical that the design could be built within the $18 million budget set by the city. Revell received a $25,000 prize plus an estimated $1 million in fees to supervise construction. He complained that not enough credit was given to his design collaborators, Heikki Castren, Bengt Lundsten, and Seppo Valjus, and asked that all names be listed as the architects. Revell died in 1964 before the project was finished.

===Construction===

Construction began in 1961, and the building was completed four years later. The time capsule for City Hall was placed in a large ceremony on November 7, 1962 and Governor General Georges Vanier officially opened the new structure September 13, 1965.

The area of Toronto City Hall and the civic square was formerly the location of Toronto&#x27;s first Chinatown, which was expropriated and bulldozed during the mid-1950s in preparation for a new civic building. The location of City Hall itself was also the site of the 1917 Land Registry Office. It was designed in the Roman Classical style and was itself intended as part of a prior urban renewal plan for the area. It was demolished in 1964.

The south side of Queen Street opposite City Hall was considered a &#x27;commercial slum&#x27; and in August 1964, Toronto City Council voted to expropriate the south side for development appropriate to the new civic square. The businesses on that side of the street included two burlesque theatres, pawn shops and a cinema. The south side was vacant at the time of the City Hall opening but was eventually occupied by a new hotel, connected by a bridge over Queen Street to the square.

To the west of the new City Hall, the University Avenue Armouries at University Avenue just north of Osgoode Hall was bought from the Government of Canada for million to make way for a new court building, also as part of the new civic square project.

===Opening and post-completion changes===

The building was officially opened to the public on September 13, 1965, by Georges Vanier, the governor general of Canada. The opening ceremony was attended by 14,000 dignitaries, including Lester B. Pearson, the prime minister of Canada, and John Robarts, the premier of Ontario.

In 1990, Hester How Daycare Centre was opened in the building, and named after a Toronto teacher Hester How, who helped turn around delinquent boys in the second half of the 19th Century. 

City Hall was designated as a property of historical and architectural significance under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; in 1991.

Minor upgrades by Toronto architect Bruce Kuwabara to connect the two towers and upgrade council chambers from 1997 to 1998. A green roof was added late 2009 and opened to over 10,000 visitors on Doors Open Toronto weekend in May 2010. The site now contains largest publicly accessible green roof in the city.

==Design and features==

===Exterior===
While the building&#x27;s base is rectangular, its two towers are curved in cross-section and rise to differing heights.
The east tower is 27 storeys () tall and the west tower is 20 storeys (). Between the towers is the saucer-like council chamber, and the overall arrangement is somewhat like two hands cradling the chamber. The outer surfaces of the curve are covered with concrete bearing a rib pattern that provides strength and prevents collapse of the fabric as a result of the expansion of the exterior surfaces, and the tearing apart of the fabric as a result of differences in air pressure on the two sides of each wing-like tower during the high winds characteristic of the Great Lakes. The north, west, and east elevations are more abstract and sculptural in contrast with the extensive glazing of south elevation facing the square; each presents a view of concave panels of concrete textured with split-faced strips of Botticino marble. To the east of the square is Old City Hall which currently serves as a courthouse. 

From the air, the building is seen as a giant unblinking eye, thus the building&#x27;s original nickname of &quot;The Eye of Government&quot;. When finished, the building generated widespread controversy among many who felt that it was &quot;too futuristic&quot; for the city. In Arthur&#x27;s 1964 book, &quot;Toronto, No Mean City&quot;, he praised the new City Hall, writing: &quot;Taller buildings will be built before the end of the century here and elsewhere in North America, but there will be no comparable or no more renowned city hall.&quot;

===Interior===

The building also includes observation decks. The East Tower Observation on the 27th floor is closed to the public, although access to the observation deck, and other areas in the building complex, have been provided during the annual Doors Open Toronto event. Access to the floor is via two sets of stairs as elevators end at 25th floor. 

The building also includes a branch of the Toronto Public Library, although it has been reduced in size since its opening.

====Council Chambers====

The city council chambers is a semi-circular room located on the second floor supported on a single massive column below. On the main level of the chambers are the seats for the 25 members of council, arranged in a semi-circle.

In front of the councillors is the podium and seat for the Speaker of Toronto City Council (or Deputy Speaker when Speaker is not present). Flanking the Speaker are two long tables for Commissioners (i.e., department heads); City Manager, Deputy City Manager, City Solicitor and Chief Financial Officer are seated to the right and City Staff on the left. In front of the Speaker is the horseshoe shaped desk for the City Clerk and Clerk staff. The mayor, is seated amongst councillors in the first row to the Speaker&#x27;s right. A removable podium is located to the right of the Speaker for guest speakers. The room is covered by a shallow dome resting on 23 pairs of v-shaped supports that rise from the base. The space behind the supports is filled with glass.

Behind the councillors is the public seating gallery which accommodates 250 in tiered rows. Adjacent to City Council chambers are two committee rooms, as well as the offices of the mayor and city councillors. Two sets of elevators provide access to the floors below (ground floor and to the parking garage below).

===Public square===
The design for the public space in front of the new city hall, Nathan Phillips Square, was part of the competition. The square&#x27;s reflecting pool and concrete arches, fountain, and overhead walkways were thus also part of Revell&#x27;s submission. It has since seen several monuments, sculptures, and other works of public art added, and was renovated, but it continues to complement the city hall with its original Modernist design elements. 

The public square is one of the main hosts of different festivals and events in Toronto. New Year&#x27;s celebrations are held there every year which include fireworks and musical performances. The annual Cavalcade of Lights Festival decorates the square from the end of November until the end of December.

==In popular culture==
Even as early as 1969, the building appeared as a futuristic alien building in a Star Trek comic; it was later seen in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Contagion&quot; (Season 2, episode 11, March 20, 1989) as one of the possible destinations of an alien portal.

The 2010 film &quot;Red&quot; featured Toronto City Hall and various other city locations.

<text>Iestyn ap Gwrgant (or Jestyn ap Gwrgant) () (1014–1093) was the last ruler of the Welsh kingdom of Morgannwg, which encompassed the counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire.

== Lineage ==
Iestyn ap Gwrgant was the last ruler of the royal house of Morgannwg, which had a lineage stretching back over five centuries to Tewdrig (c. 500–520). The members of this royal house had links to the other royal houses of Wales through marriage, and were descendants of the celebrated Rhodri Mawr. Iestyn ap Gwrgant&#x27;s base is believed to have been at Dinas Powys, south west of Cardiff.

== Norman invasion ==
Iestyn probably ruled Morgannwg for a little less than a decade (c. 1081–1090) and is believed to have built castles in the regions of Cardiff and Kenfig. The popular version of historical events is that Iestyn, following a dispute with his rival Einion ap Collwyn, invited Robert Fitzhamon and his twelve knights into the region to settle the matter. Once invited in, they refused to leave. He was deposed c. 1090 by Norman ruler Robert Fitzhamon, lord of Gloucester, who established a lordship based in Cardiff and subsequently conquered the lowlands of Glamorgan (the Vale of Glamorgan), which was parcelled out to his followers. The mountainous parts of Glamorgan were left in Welsh control. Caradog ap Iestyn, the eldest son of Iestyn ap Gwrgant, was the only Welsh lord to retain lands in the Glamorgan lowlands after Fitzhamon had conquered them. He retained the land between the River Neath and the River Afan, and he and his descendants were known as the &quot;lords of Afan.&quot; His descendants are thought to include the Williams family of Aberpergwm and the Powell Wilkins family of Carreg Cennen, Carmarthenshire.

== Modern interpretation ==
Iestyn ap Gwrgant&#x27;s arms can be seen today in a modern context as a banner of the arms forms the Flag of Glamorgan which itself forms a charge on the flag of Cardiff. Additionally the arms are found within the crest of Pontypridd Rugby Football Club, a Rugby Union team from Pontypridd within the ancient boundaries of Morgannwg. Richard Williams Morgan claimed that a reference to a son of Caratacus called Saint Cyllin was found in the family records of Iestyn ab Gwrgant and used this as evidence of early entry of Christianity to Britain &quot;Cyllin ab Caradog, a wise and just king. In his days many of the Cymry embraced the faith in Christ through the teaching of the saints of Cor-Eurgain, and many godly men from the countries of Greece and Rome were in Cambria. He first of the Cymry gave infants names; for before, names were not given except to adults, and then from something characteristic in their bodies, minds, or manners.&quot;

<text>The University of Evansville (UE) is a private university in Evansville, Indiana. It was founded in 1854 as Moores Hill College. The university operates a satellite center, Harlaxton College, in Grantham, England. UE offers more than 80 different majors and areas of study, each housed within three colleges and one school within the university: the Schroeder School of Business, the College of Education and Health Sciences, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, and the William L. Ridgway College of Arts and Sciences. The school is affiliated with the United Methodist Church.

Total enrollment (including full and part-time, undergraduate, adult, graduate, and UE students at Harlaxton) is 2,443 students, although full-time undergraduate and Doctor of Physical Therapy enrollment is 1,976 students. The student body represents 55 countries and 44 states with international students comprising 16% of the undergraduate student population. The university also hosts more than 155 student organizations and an active Greek community. UE athletic teams participate in Division I of the NCAA and are known as the Purple Aces. Evansville is a member of the Missouri Valley Conference.

Notable alumni include prominent entertainers, writers, and sports stars such as actors Rami Malek and Kelli Giddish, producer/writer Matt Williams, and basketball coach Jerry Sloan, as well as scientists, business people, and others.

==History==
The University of Evansville began in 1854 when Moores Hill Male and Female Collegiate Institute was founded by John Moore in the small town of Moores Hill in southeastern Indiana. The first college building at Moores Hill, Moore Hall, was completed on December 1, 1856, although the opening day of classes for the new college was held in the unfinished building on September 9. The institution struggled financially during its time in Moores Hill, and a fire destroyed Moore Hall in 1915. The institution continued to operate in a second building, Carnegie Hall, until the move to Evansville. The former campus in Moores Hill continued operation as an elementary and high school. Carnegie Hall is now maintained as a museum.

On March 21, 1917, George S. Clifford made a presentation at a special session of the Indiana Conference of the Methodist Church, suggesting that the college be moved to Evansville, Indiana. Clifford produced a map that highlighted a lack of colleges in the Evansville area. After some deliberation and the city of Evansville raising $514,000 for the college, it was relocated to Evansville in 1919 and renamed Evansville College. It operated in temporary quarters in downtown Evansville until Administration Hall (now Olmsted Hall) was completed in 1922. This is the only building remaining on campus from before World War II.

In the period from World War II to 1960, Evansville College grew significantly. Enrollment grew from about 400 during the Great Depression to 1,500 in 1946. Also following the war, the Science and Engineering Building and Alumni Memorial Union were commissioned. The Clifford Memorial Library was completed in 1957. Five residence halls were built between 1958 and 1967, along with a fitness center, dining hall, and an art building. In 1967, due to the institution&#x27;s growth and organizational changes, the name was changed to the University of Evansville with the approval of the Indiana State General Assembly. Also in 1967, a new theater building, Hyde Hall, housing Shanklin Theater was finished.

In 2010, the University of Evansville completed early its Endowment Campaign to raise $80 million after having raised an additional $60 million five years previous to the new campaign. On July 1, 2018, Christopher M. Pietruszkiewicz became the University of Evansville&#x27;s 24th president.

The University of Evansville faced significant criticism from the Evansville community over its handling of the sale of approximately 42 acres of land near Wesselman Woods. In January 2019, UE announced plans to sell this off-campus property to fund the construction of a new campus health and wellness center. This proposal alarmed supporters of Wesselman Woods Nature Preserve, who feared that selling the land for commercial development would remove a valuable buffer zone between urban development and the preserve&#x27;s old-growth forest, potentially harming its delicate ecosystem. Critics accused the administration of prioritizing financial gain over environmental and community concerns, which further damaged the university’s reputation. UE sold the property to Wesselman Woods in 2023 for $2 million.

==Academics==

The University of Evansville is academically organized into three colleges and three schools:
* William L. Ridgway College of Arts &amp; Sciences
* College of Education &amp; Health Sciences
**School of Education
**School of Public Health
* College of Engineering &amp; Computer Science
* Schroeder Family School of Business Administration

===Rankings===
In 2022, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the University of Evansville against other regional Midwest universities, awarding it #7 overall, #3 for veterans, and #12 for value. It called the school&#x27;s admissions policy &quot;more selective.&quot;

===Harlaxton College===
In addition to studying in the city of Evansville, the university&#x27;s students can choose to study abroad in England at Harlaxton College, &quot;The British Campus of the University of Evansville&quot;. The college was formed and controlled by Stanford University prior to its passing to The University of Evansville. The college is located at Harlaxton Manor, about 115 miles north of London in Lincolnshire, a few miles away from the town of Grantham, England (home of Sir Isaac Newton and Margaret Thatcher and Thomas Paine). The study abroad program at the University of Evansville has consistently been rated as one of the best study abroad programs in the nation, ranked #1 in Europe and #7 globally.

====Harlaxton Bureau at Harlaxton College====
On July 30, 1997, the now-closed student radio station 91.5 FM WUEV opened the former Harlaxton Bureau at Harlaxton College, Lincolnshire, England. Shortly thereafter, Harlaxton Bureau correspondents covered the death of Princess Diana and were subsequently recognized by the Indiana Society of Professional Journalists. This made the University of Evansville the first American to have a student-run news bureau on a foreign campus.

===Theatre department===
The UE theatre department features four mainstage and two studio productions a year, many taking place at Shanklin Theatre, which features a 482-seat thrust stage design extending into the audience on three sides. It also leads the nation in the top awards for its students as awarded by The Broadway Theatre Wing and other governing bodies of serious theatre. UE&#x27;s alumni include Ron Glass, Jack McBrayer, Kwame James, Rutina Wesley, Crista Flanagan, Kelli Giddish, Carrie Preston, Rami Malek (winner of the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and British Academy Film Award for Best Actor), and Deirdre Lovejoy.

==Campus==
The university campus is characterized by its grassy open spaces and tree cover. The university landscape is well maintained, and many students take advantage of the spacious lawns and large shade trees. The campus is bounded on the north by the Lloyd Expressway, the south by Lincoln Avenue, west by Rotherwood Avenue, and on the east by Weinbach Avenue. Walnut Street bisects the campus. Sesquicentennial Oval, the ceremonial entrance to campus, opens off of Lincoln Avenue. The oval was named in 2004 in commemoration of the university&#x27;s 150th anniversary. The Schroeder Family School of Business, McCurdy Alumni Memorial Union, Sampson Hall / Mann Health Center, Hyde Hall, Olmsted Administration Hall, Clifford Memorial Library, and Koch (pronounced Cook) Center for Science and Engineering (all sectors of the original and later additional science/engineering buildings) surround Sesquicentennial Oval. Most of the buildings follow an old limestone motif, and renovations generally emulate the rest of the building.
The Administration Hall and the President&#x27;s House and Circle were named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Koch Center was originally named the Engineering and Science Building when it was built in 1947. The motivation for the new building stemmed from WWII, after which UE expected a greater number of students to enroll with the intent of getting industrial degrees. After renovations in the late 1970s, the building was renamed in November 1984 in honor of Robert Louis Koch who had been a member of the UE Board of Trustees since 1968; Koch had recently given a donation to the university&#x27;s New Century Capital Campaign that was being used to build a new library. (Not to be confused with the Kochs, Robert L. Koch was the chairman of the board of George Koch Sons, Inc.—an industrial company in Evansville—and son of Louis J. Koch, founder of the Holiday World amusement park.) Koch Center experienced another renovation, including a large new addition on its south side, in 2001.

In 2016, the Peters-Margedant House museum was moved to campus and then opened for tours in 2017.

==Athletics==

The University of Evansville athletic teams have the nickname the Purple Aces (originally the &quot;Pioneers&quot;). Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s varsity sports play at the NCAA Division I level and compete in the Missouri Valley Conference, except for the men&#x27;s swimming and diving teams which compete in the Mid-American Conference

==Media==
&quot;WUEV&quot; started in 1951, was a noncommercial, 6100-watt FM Radio station located at 91.5 MHz, owned and operated by the University of Evansville. WUEV also streamed online and became the first internet radio station in Indiana in 1996. The station was operated entirely by a student staff.

On May 17, 2019, the University of Evansville made what members of the Evansville community claimed to be a controversial decision to sell the students&#x27; station to WAY-FM, a non-profit nationwide network that plays contemporary Christian music.

While the story garnered national media attention from major media outlets and public scrutiny in support of the students and WUEV, the issue was brought to light in September 2018 when a group of University of Evansville alumni, community, and students began to uncover information that the University of Evansville previously had kept from the public as reported by WEHT News 25. The university later admitted in 2019 the decision was made over a two-year study since 2016 which they previously never mentioned.

The FCC finalized the transfer of WUEV&#x27;s license to WAY-FM on November 25, 2019. The terrestrial signal went silent at 11 p.m. CST. The final song played on WUEV was &quot;Closing Time&quot; by Semisonic. The station began broadcasting WAY-FM programming on November 26, 2019, and changed its call sign to WJWA on December 4, 2019.

<doc id="798121" wikidata="Q13582547" url="?curid=798121" title="Anointed One (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>The Anointed One is a fictional character in the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The character is played by Andrew J. Ferchland. His epithet could refer to his position as the &quot;messiah&quot; (another word meaning anointed) of the vampire The Master.

==Character history==
Introduced in season 1 to help The Master escape his confinement, he is killed by Spike in the season 2 episode &quot;School Hard&quot;.

A prophecy foretold the coming of the Anointed One:

&quot;And there will be a time of crisis, of worlds hanging in the balance. And in this time shall come the Anointed, The Master&#x27;s great warrior... The Five will die, and from their ashes the Anointed shall rise. The Brethren of Aurelius shall meet him and usher him to his immortal destiny. ...the Slayer will not know him, will not stop him, and he will lead her into Hell.&quot;
In the episode &quot;Never Kill a Boy on the First Date&quot; a bus passing through Sunnydale was attacked by a group of The Master&#x27;s vampires. The driver and four passengers were killed, and two of them were made vampires. One of these, a little boy named Collin, became the Anointed, a bloodthirsty companion to The Master. (Buffy killed the other new vampire, psychotic Andrew Borba, and mistakenly assumed that he was the Anointed One.)

As foretold by Aurelius, the Anointed One later led Buffy to the lair of The Master. Though it wasn&#x27;t the literal Hell, it was underground, as the Christian Hell is said to be. Buffy would be defeated and killed by The Master there. (The prophecy was silent concerning the Slayer&#x27;s resurrection at the hands of a friend — Xander Harris.) Buffy states that she recognized the Anointed One for what he was as Giles and Ms. Calendar realized he was a child, defying the prophecy (although it is possible the prophecy referred to Buffy mistaking Borba for the Anointed One).

Following The Master&#x27;s demise at Buffy&#x27;s hands, the Anointed One rallied the remaining members of the Order of Aurelius under his command, employing the vampire Absalom as his leading acolyte. The Anointed One and his lackeys attempted to resurrect the Master via a magic ritual, but were foiled when Buffy destroyed The Master&#x27;s bones with a sledgehammer. Weeks later, he was killed by a newcomer to Sunnydale, Spike. Spike placed him in a cage and hoisted it into the sunlight, incinerating the Anointed One as he declared, &quot;From now on, we&#x27;re gonna have a little less ritual, and a little more &quot;fun&quot; around here!&quot;

Joss Whedon said that early on the plan was to use the Anointed One as the principal Big Bad for season 2. However, these plans were changed because actor Andrew J. Ferchland was still growing and would not be believable as a perpetual child for very long.

<doc id="798122" wikidata="Q5870389" url="?curid=798122" title="History of the Scots Guards (1914–1945)">
<text>This article details the history of the Scots Guards from 1914 to 1945. The Scots Guards (SG) is a regiment of the Guards Division of the British Army. The Scots Guards trace their origins back to 1642 when, by order of King Charles I, the regiment was raised by Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll for service in Ireland, and was known as the Marquis of Argyll&#x27;s Royal Regiment.

==Pre–World War I==
See Scots Guards (1805).

==World War I==
On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife the Countess Sophie were assassinated by a Serbian nationalist. This event triggered the First World War that would eventually lead every major power on the continent and the United Kingdom into war by August, a war that would affect much of the world.

The 3rd (Reserve) Battalion was re-formed in August, though would not see service abroad, and would remain in the UK for the duration of the war, and was disbanded in 1919. Also in August, the 1st Battalion, part of the 1st Guards Brigade of the 1st Division, departed for foreign shores, arriving in France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The first engagement of the war came at Mons where British forces successfully defended against the Germans, inflicting very heavy casualties on them, so much so that they believed the British Army had used far more machine-guns than they had actually used. Despite the victory, due to overwhelming German numbers, as well as the retreat of the French, the British had to withdraw from Mons. The retreat effectively saved the BEF and the French and kept the British in France to continue the fight against the Germans.

In September the 1st Battalion took part in its second major engagement, at the First Battle of the Marne, which saw the Germans advance halted after much bitter fighting, with the Germans eventually going into retreat. The sides soon dug-in, the trenches that would be made would become one of the defining symbols of the First World War. The battalion subsequently took part in the Battle of the Aisne where the battalion saw heavy fighting, including at the Aisne Heights and Chivy. In November, the 2nd Battalion landed in France as part of the 20th Guards Brigade of the 7th Division. Both battalions as part of their respective divisions, took part in the First Battle of Ypres which took place between September and November. Both battalions saw very heavy fighting at Ypres and in the surrounding area, which eventually saw over 50,000 British soldiers of the Regular army become casualties, though the British Army held the line against seemingly overwhelming German attacks, stopping the final German attempt to break the Allied line in 1914.

The regiment saw further involvement in the bitter cold month of December, and in that month, on 19 December, Private James Mackenzie of the 2nd Battalion won the regiment its first Victoria Cross (VC) of the war, and the first VC won by the Scots Guards, rather than its predecessor name, the Scots Fusilier Guards. He was awarded the VC after he, under very heavy enemy fire and after a stretcher party had been forced to abandon its rescue attempt, came to the assistance of a British soldier severely wounded in front of the German trenches, and successfully brought him back to British lines. Private Mackenzie was killed later that day while performing a similar act of bravery.

In March 1915, the 2nd Battalion took part in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, which was a relatively successful engagement, though it did fall short of its expected gains of advancing all the way to Lille. In May, both battalions took part in the Battle of Aubers, and later that month, the 2nd Battalion took part in the Battle of Festubert. On 3 August, Second Lieutenant George Arthur Boyd-Rochfort of the 1st Battalion was standing near a working party when a trench mortar bomb landed on the side of the parapet of the communications trench where he was standing. With no regard for his safety, Lieutenant Boyd-Rochfort shouted to the men to look out, and subsequently rushed to the bomb, grabbed it and duly threw it over the parapet where it instantly exploded. For his courageous actions, Lieutenant Boyd-Rochfort was awarded the Victoria Cross. Also in August, both battalions of the regiment were transferred from their respective divisions to the Guards Division. The 1st Battalion joined the 2nd Guards Brigade on 25 August, while the 2nd Battalion joined the 3rd Guards Brigade on 9 September.

In September, both battalions took part in the Battle of Loos. On 27 September, when the 3rd Guards Brigade (2nd Battalion) were moving in preparation to attack a German-held position known as Hill 70, via Loos, an artillery barrage caught them, causing many casualties among the Guards. The following day, the 2nd Guards Brigade (1st Battalion) attacked a position known as Puits 14 bis, and in the process, suffered very heavy casualties, forcing the brigade to halt the attack. Both battalions continued to experience heavy fighting throughout September, and into October, and by the end of the Battle of Loos, the regiment had suffered over 500 casualties.

On 1 July 1916, the first Battle of the Somme began, and on the very first day of the offensive, over 57,000 British soldiers became casualties. In September, the Scots Guards got involved in the Somme Offensive for the first, taking part in the subsidiary Battle of Flers–Courcelette, which saw the first introduction of the tank, and at another subsidiary battle, at Morval, where the Guards captured Lesboeufs. On 15 July, Lance-Sergeant Frederick McNess of the 1st Battalion, led a bombing party under very heavy shell and machine-gun fire. The party successfully reached the first enemy trench but found the left flank to be exposed, and the enemy were lobbing bombs. Sergeant McNess duly led a counter-attack, being badly wounded in the jaw and neck in the process. Despite the severe wounds the Sergeant subsequently made a &#x27;block&#x27;, encouraged his men and continued to throw grenades until eventually succumbing to the loss of blood.
In July 1917, the regiment began its involvement in the Third Battle of Ypres, which lasted into November. The regiment took part in the subsidiary engagements at Pilckem, Menin Road, Poelcapelle, Passchendaele, experiencing very severe fighting which saw the British suffer very heavy casualties against stiff German defenders in terrible fighting conditions. In November, the regiment took part in the Battle of Cambrai (1917), most famous for the first large-scale use of British tanks, eventually 476 tanks in total, in battle.

On 27 November, Sergeant John McAulay, of the 1st Battalion, assumed command of his company after all its officers had become casualties, and under heavy shell and machine-gun fire, the company held and consolidated the company&#x27;s gained objectives. The Sergeant subsequently reorganised the company and upon noticing a counter-attack developing, he successfully repulsed it by skillfully exploiting machine-guns to his advantage to inflict very heavy casualties on the German attackers. Sergeant McAulay also carried a considerable distance to a safer location, while under heavy fire, the mortally wounded company commander. He performed valiantly in doing this duty, and did not waver, despite being knocked off his feet twice by shell blasts. For his heroic and professional actions, Sergeant McAulay was awarded the Victoria Cross.

In March 1918, the second Battle of the Somme began, and would last until April, though further Somme region would last until September. The regiment took part in the subsidiary battles at St. Quentin, Bapaume, Arras and Albert. In September, the regiment took part in the Battle of Havrincourt during the operations against the Hindenburg Line, as well as the Canal du Nord and, in October, took part in the Battle of Cambrai (1918).

On 13 October, Lance Corporal Harry Blanshard Wood of the 2nd Battalion, at St. Python, took command of his platoon, the leading platoon of the company, after the platoon sergeant was killed, under very heavy fire, during the advance on the village of St. Python. The company that Corporal Wood was part of, was tasked with taking the western half of the village and to secure the crossing of the River Selle, as well as secure the ruined bridge. However, the space in front of it was covered by snipers, but this did not deter Corporal Wood. The Corporal took a large brick into the open space, lay behind it, and continuously shot at the snipers, ordering his men to get across the open space while he covered them, remaining in the open space until all his men had got across. Later that day, Corporal Wood drove off a number of German counter-attacks on his position, proving his professional and gallant leadership throughout the day. For his actions Corporal Wood was awarded the Victoria Cross, the last VC won by the regiment during the First World War.

The regiment took part in the final battles of the war on the Western Front, on 17 October, the Battle of the Selle began which eventually saw the town of Valenciennes captured by the Allies, and on 4 November took part in the Battle of the Sambre. At 11 AM of 11 November, the Armistice was signed between the victorious Allies and the Germans. The Guards Division soon after the end of the war was ordered to the Rhine, eventually crossing the frontier on 11 December. The Scots Guards subsequently joined the British Army of Occupation in Cologne and returned home in 1919. For its part during the First World War, the regiment gained thirty-three battle honours though lost just under 3,000 men during the war.

==Inter-war==

In 1918, the rank of Private was replaced in the Foot Guards by the title Guardsman. The Scots Guards, while in Germany, joined the British Army of Occupation in Cologne before returning home in 1919, where it marched in London as part of the Guards Division. Both battalions would remain in the United Kingdom for the majority of the inter-war years where it carried out the usual public duties, though would, at times, be deployed abroad. In 1927, the 2nd Battalion departed for Shanghai in the Far East during the conflict between the Communists and Nationalists, with the dangers that this posed to the British populace living in Shanghai. The battalion was also stationed in Hong Kong before returning home in 1929.

In 1933, the regiment formed an alliance with the Winnipeg Grenadiers of Canada. In 1935, it was the 1st Battalion&#x27;s turn to be deployed abroad when it was stationed in Egypt during the tense times between the British Empire and Italy, after the latter had invaded the East African nation of Abyssinia. In 1936, the 2nd Battalion deployed to Palestine, which was experiencing violent troubles during the Arab Revolt. That same year the alliance with the 13th Scottish Light Dragoons, of Canada, ended with the disbandment of that regiment. The regiment also gained two new Colonel-in-Chiefs with the accession of HM King Edward VIII and His Majesty King George VI, the latter ascended the throne after King Edward had abdicated. In 1938, the 2nd Battalion deployed to Egypt where it would be stationed at the outbreak of the Second World War.

==World War II==
On 1 September 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Two days later war was declared between the British Empire, France and Germany. In April 1940, the 1st Battalion, as part of the 24th Guards Brigade, took part in its first campaign of the war, during the expedition to Norway, and began to land in Harstad on 16 April. The 24th Guards Brigade was then used to protect a number of Norwegian ports from German attack, though all fell by the end of May, and, due to the troubling situation in France, the British Army began evacuating from Norway, which was completed by 8 June. Later that year, the 3rd Battalion was re-formed for the second time and joined the 30th Infantry Brigade, while the 4th Battalion and Holding Battalion was also raised.

===North Africa===
In the North African Campaign, as part of the 22nd Guards Brigade, the 2nd Battalion took part in fighting against the Italians in Egypt before the following year when it saw tough fighting in Libya, then controlled by Italy. Engagements that the regiment took part in were many, and it fought valiantly against tough opposition. In May, the regiment saw action at the Battle of Halfaya Pass, which saw British and Commonwealth forces experiencing tough fighting against Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps. In June, the battalion was involved in Operation Battleaxe, a British/Commonwealth offensive push to relieve the besieged city of Tobruk, though the offensive saw stiff resistance from the enemy forces, and the Allies eventually had to withdraw in the face of numerically superior, and better armed Afrika Korps. The next British offensive did not come until November when Operation Crusader began, which was another attempt to break the siege of the Allied-held Tobruk, and unlike previous attempts, this operation succeeded, though it was a close-run thing which saw bitter heavy fighting and heavy losses, especially in tanks, with the operation ending in December. The Siege of Tobruk was finally lifted, with its defenders, mostly Australians, having held out since April. Back in the United Kingdom, the 3rd Battalion re-roled to an armoured battalion, being renamed 3rd (Tank) Battalion and joined the 6th Guards Armoured Brigade. Renamed 6th Guards Armoured Brigade when Artillery, Engineer &amp; other units joined the brigade prior to crossing the Rhine on 24 March 1944.

In early 1942, Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps started a new offensive which caught the Allies by surprise, forcing them into retreat, though the German offensive came to a halt in early February at Gazala. Later that year, the battalion joined the 201st Guards Brigade and in May the Germans launched another offensive against the Allies. The 201st Guards Brigade were located at a position known as Knightsbridge Box, with other &#x27;Boxes&#x27; being manned by other British, Commonwealth and Free French brigades which formed the &#x27;Gazala Line&#x27;. The Guards at Knightbridge saw heavy fighting against the attacking German forces, and by 13 June, the Guards were cut off from Allied forces, and eventually a German attack, during terrible weather, overran the 2nd Battalion and at night, after an Allied counter-attack by armoured units, the Guards eventually managed to withdraw in a professional manner. Soon after, most of the Allies were in retreat to the &quot;El Alamein Line&quot; and Tobruk eventually fell on 20 June, with many thousands of Allied troops being captured, including men of the 2nd Battalion, though some managed to escape to Egypt. The battalion was subsequently reformed back in Egypt.

Between October and November the Second Battle of El Alamein took place, which saw General Montgomery&#x27;s British Eighth Army achieve a decisive victory over the German, which saw them go into full-retreat. By January 1943, the Allied armies had pushed the enemy back significantly, going as far as capturing Tripoli. Back in the UK, the 3rd Battalion was renamed the 3rd (Tank) Battalion and joined the 6th Guards Tank Brigade. In North Africa, on 6 March, the 2nd Battalion took part in the defensive Battle of Medenine, after the Germans had counter-attacked the Allies, an attack that, if it had succeeded, would have caused the British many problems. The &quot;Scots Guards&quot; performed valiantly, using their anti-tank guns to great effect against the German armour, with many German tanks being knocked out by the Guards and other regiments, and the German offensive was soon called off. That same month the 1st Battalion arrived in North Africa from the UK as part of the 24th Guards Brigade. Both battalions saw further engagements in North Africa, with the 1st Battalion seeing heavy fighting in April at Medjez Plain and Djebel Bou Aoukaz.

During that month, Captain The Lord Lyell of the 1st Battalion, commanded a company with great dash and valour during engagements between 23 and 27 April, taking part in tremendously heavy fighting against German forces and kept the morale of his troops high. On 27 April, Captain The Lord Lyell&#x27;s company took part in the attack on Djebel Bou Aoukaz and were coming under fire from an enemy post, consisting of an 88 mm gun and heavy machine-gun in two separate pits, which was holding the company&#x27;s advance up. Lord Lyell thus led an attack, consisting of a sergeant, a lance-corporal and two guardsmen on the post. Lord Lyell was ahead of the others by quite a bit and destroyed the machine-gun gun crew by grenade, and three of Lord Lyell&#x27;s party became casualties, while the lance-corporal gave covering fire for Lord Lyell. Lord Lyell, with this covering fire, then attacked the pit containing the 88 mm gun with bayonet and pistol, killing several of the gun crew before being overwhelmed by the surviving gun crew and killed. The remaining crew then left and both guns were silenced, allowing the advance to continue. Lord Lyell was awarded the posthumous Victoria Cross for his courageous actions and leadership.

===Italy and France===
By May 1943, the battle for North Africa was over, Tunis had fallen, the Allies were victorious and 130,000 German and 120,000 Italian soldiers had surrendered. In September, the 2nd Battalion, as part of the 201st Guards Brigade, temporarily attached to the 56th (London) Infantry Division, took part in the landings at Salerno and subsequently saw heavy fighting during that month and in October took part in the crossing of the Volturno. At the Battle of Monte Cassino, the 2nd Battalion suffered heavy casualties in tough fighting though it was eventually captured in May 1944. In December, the 1st Battalion, as part of the 24th Guards Brigade of the British 1st Division, arrived in the Italian Theatre. In January 1944, the Scots Guards took part in the landings at Anzio and saw heavy fighting there, including at Campoleone and Carroceto, with the Allies not breaking out of the Anzio beachhead for a number of months. The 1st Battalion, as part of its brigade, joined the 6th South African Armoured Division in May. The regiment took part in many fierce engagements throughout 1944, including at Monte San Michele and against the Gothic Line, a formidable defensive line. In 1945, the regiment continued to take part in some bitter engagements, including in April when it took part in an amphibious landing of the Bonifica area, east of the Argenta Gap, where the 1st Battalion saw heavy fighting, receiving heavy casualties in the process. In May, the battalion found itself in Trieste which had been captured by Yugoslavian and Croatian forces. The battalion would remain in Trieste until 1946.

Back in July 1944, the 3rd (Tank) Battalion landed in France, with heavy fighting still raging in the Normandy area. The battalion saw action at Mont Pincon, where at Quarry Hill, a squadron of the battalion was ambushed by three 8.8 cm armed Jagdpanther tank destroyers, who duly accounted for eleven Churchill tanks of the battalion who eventually forced the Germans to withdraw. The battalion saw further service taking part in the steady Allied advance, including at the Venlo Pocket in the Low Countries and in 1945, the Rhineland, where the battalion was involved in a variety of engagements. In March, the 2nd Battalion arrived in North-West Europe and joined the Guards Armoured Division. The regiment saw further engagements deeper inside Germany, including at Lingen and Uelzen. On 8 May, after six long years of war, the war in the European theatre was officially over, with the declaration of Victory in Europe Day and on 14 May, the regiment took control of the small German island of Heligoland. In June, the 3rd (Tank) Battalion re-roled to an infantry battalion, reverting to its original 3rd Battalion name, as part of the renamed 6th Guards Brigade. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions were stationed in Germany, and in early 1946, the 3rd Battalion was disbanded in Cologne-Weiden, while the 2nd Battalion returned home to the United Kingdom in December.

The regiment, as in the First World War, proved its professionalism once more, seeing service in North Africa, Italy and across North-West Europe, taking part in some of the British Army&#x27;s most famous moments. During the war, just over 1,000 men of the Scots Guards lost their lives and many gallantry awards were won, including a single Victoria Cross.

<text>Ronald Lou-Poy, (September 25, 1934February 9, 2022) was a Canadian lawyer and community leader. He served as chancellor of the University of Victoria from 2003 to 2008.

==Early life==
Lou-Poy was born in Victoria, British Columbia, on September 25, 1934. His father worked as a grocer, and Lou-Poy was the third generation of his family to reside in Victoria. He studied at Victoria College (which later became the University of Victoria) and the University of British Columbia, graduating with a Bachelor of Commerce in 1957. He was then accepted into the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law, obtaining a Bachelor of Laws in 1960.

==Career==
After graduating, Lou-Poy articled with Crease Harman &amp; Company, and was subsequently called to the bar of British Columbia in 1961. He specialized in trusts, wills and estates, corporate and commercial law, as well as real estate and mortgages. He eventually became a senior partner of that law firm.

Lou-Poy first served on the University of Victoria board of governors from 1972 to 1974, and again from 1992 to 1995. He was also a founding director of the university&#x27;s Innovation and Development Corporation, a commercialization enterprise that introduced ground-breaking technologies to market. He was eventually elected as the ninth chancellor of the University of Victoria, assuming the post in 2003. Two years later, he was elected to a second term by acclamation. During his tenure as chancellor, he officiated over more than 70 convocation ceremonies, during which he handed out over 16,000 degrees, certificates, and diplomas (a total of 25,600 when including those graduating &quot;in absentia&quot;). He also presented university degrees in Iqaluit to Inuit students enrolled in a special University of Victoria Faculty of Law program, as well as honorary degrees at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. His family financed the construction of a child care centre at the university and established a scholarship for law students.

==Awards and honours==
Lou-Poy was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in December 1989. He was granted an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Victoria (his alma mater) in 2000. Three years later, he was appointed a member of the Order of Canada and invested a year later in October 2004. Lou-Poy was conferred the Leadership Victoria Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007, in recognition of his long-standing service to the local community. He was also presented with a community service award by the Canadian Bar Association. He was part of the inaugural class inducted into the Greater Victoria Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s Business Hall of Fame in September 2021.

==Personal life==
Lou-Poy was married to May until his death. Together, they had two children: Anne-Marie and Patrick. He played tennis into his seventies and golf until a few years before his death, having been a member of the Uplands Golf Club.

Lou-Poy died on February 9, 2022, at the age of 87.

<text>The following is the 1970–71 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1970 through August 1971. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1969–70 season. All times are Eastern and Pacific, with certain exceptions, such as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. 

This was the first time that the top rated show of the season aired on ABC.

New fall series are highlighted in bold.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.

PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, was in operation by October 1970; however, schedules were set by each affiliated station.

In April 1970, Congress passed a law banning the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio, effective January 2, 1971.

This season would be the last one for the traditional 3½-hour prime time schedule.

<doc id="798161" wikidata="Q3758381" url="?curid=798161" title="Garlands (album)">
<text>Garlands is the debut studio album by the Scottish alternative rock band Cocteau Twins. It was released on 10July1982 through the record label 4AD. It peaked in the Top 5 of the UK Independent Albums Chart and received support from BBC Radio 1 radio host John Peel.

== Background==
&quot;Garlands&quot; is the only album that the band recorded with original bassist Will Heggie. Prior to the album, the band recorded a four-track session for John Peel in June 1982 including &quot;Wax and Wane&quot;, &quot;Garlands&quot; and two songs that would appear on their subsequent &quot;Lullabies&quot; EP. A second John Peel Session in January 1983, including a version of &quot;Blind Dumb Deaf&quot;, was included as bonus tracks on the cassette and CD releases of &quot;Garlands&quot;. Cindy Sharp of Cindytalk provided backing vocals on &quot;Dear Heart&quot;, &quot;Hearsay Please&quot; and &quot;Hazel&quot;.

The photograph on the front cover was conceived by Nigel Grierson while at college as part of a graphic design course.

== Music ==
Martin C. Strong noted that the album was &quot;hastily recorded&quot; but featured an &quot;interesting fusion of monochromatic rhythms, textured guitar distortion, and early sampling technology.&quot; Guitarist Robin Guthrie was unhappy about the recording of the album, stating in an interview for &quot;Penny Black Music&quot; in 2006:There was a lot about &quot;Garlands&quot; that we were really, really unhappy with. One of the things we had done on the demo—and used to do playing live—was put our drum box through fuzz pedals and guitar amps, so that it came out sounding really mashed up, which was what the hip-hop guys came up with a couple of years later. When we got to the studio there were all these technicians who were like ‘Oh no, you can’t do this stuff.’ We felt really intimidated. They wouldn’t let us touch any of their stuff. It was like we were wee boys and they were grown-ups. We were like ‘You set up the drum machine like that’ and they were like, ‘Oh no! You can’t do that. It’s going into the red.’ The drums as a result came out sounding clean and drum-machine pristine. It was disappointing.

The album&#x27;s sound was described in &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; as &quot;a blend of ominous pulsating bass, stark TR808 drums, cyclical guitar and great screeching arcs of reverberating feedback, over which Liz alternated dry, brittle utterings with full-power vocal gymnastics.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; described the album as &quot;dark post-punk.&quot; &quot;The Arts Desk&quot; noted that &quot;though they had their own voice, the debut’s debt to Siouxsie and the Banshees was apparent.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Garlands&quot; was released as a vinyl LP by 4AD on 10 July 1982 with artwork by 23 Envelope. Lyrics from &quot;But I&#x27;m Not&quot;, &quot;Shallow then Halo&quot;, &quot;Garlands&quot; and &quot;Grail Overfloweth&quot; appear on the inner sleeve.

The original British cassette release includes four additional tracks from a John Peel Session. The original British, Brazilian and Canadian cassette and CD releases feature the album, the Peel Session, and two other tracks that were recorded for an unreleased single, which was to have been the band&#x27;s first release. The four Peel Session recordings were later released on &quot;BBC Sessions&quot; in 1999.

A remastered version of &quot;Blind Dumb Deaf&quot; is included on the 2000 compilation &quot;Stars and Topsoil&quot;, a version of &quot;Hazel&quot; appears on the band&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Peppermint Pig&quot; EP and a remixed version of &quot;Wax and Wane&quot; is included on the 1985 compilation &quot;The Pink Opaque&quot;.

&quot;Garlands&quot; was remastered and rereleased by 4AD in 2003. It was rereleased on vinyl as part of a box set in 2010 and as an LP with the original sleeve artwork in 2020.

== Reception and legacy==
Although it was Cocteau Twins&#x27; first record, by 2 August 1982 &quot;Garlands&quot; had reached number 14 on the UK Indie Albums chart. &quot;Sounds&quot; critic Helen Fitzgerald called the album &quot;bloody good. A fluid frieze of wispy images made all the more haunting by Elizabeth&#x27;s distilled vocal maturity, fluctuating from a brittle fragility to a voluble dexterity with full range and power.&quot;

However, the band&#x27;s roadie Collin Wallace recalled that &quot;&quot;Garlands&quot; was written off in the UK as another Siouxsie copy band, and Elisabeth [Fraser] was a huge Siouxsie fan.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that the album &quot;[sounds] like Siouxsie and the Banshees with echo and smeared mascara.&quot; In its review of the album, AllMusic was generally critical, writing that &quot;&quot;Garlands&quot; falters due to something the band generally avoided in the future – overt repetition. [...] As a debut effort, though, &quot;Garlands&quot; makes its own curious mark, preparing the band for greater heights&quot;.

In a positive 2020 review, Dom Gourley of &quot;Under the Radar&quot; stated that the album &quot;represented a year zero for alternative guitar music,&quot; adding that &quot;songs like &#x27;Wax and Wane&#x27; and &#x27;But I’m Not&#x27; undoubtedly influenced a generation of effects pedalled guitar slingers decades on.&quot; In 2021, Mark Clifford of Seefeel praised the album&#x27;s production and use of drum-machine backing: &quot;I don’t think they get credited enough for that. &quot;Garlands&quot;, it’s basically electronic beats with noise on top.&quot;

<doc id="798163" wikidata="Q2733407" url="?curid=798163" title="John Rodgers (naval officer, born 1772)">
<text>Commodore John Rodgers (July 11, 1772 – August 1, 1838) was a United States Navy officer who served during the Navy&#x27;s formative years from the 1790s through to the late 1830s. He served under six presidents and for nearly four decades. His service took him through numerous military engagements of the Quasi-War, both Barbary Wars, and the War of 1812.

As a senior officer in the young American navy, Rodgers played a major role in the development of the standards, customs and traditions that emerged during this time. Rodgers was, among other things, noted for commanding the largest American squadron in his day to sail the Mediterranean Sea. After serving with distinction as a lieutenant, he was soon promoted directly to the rank of captain (the rank of Master Commandant did not exist at that time). During his naval career he commanded a number of warships, including , the flagship of the fleet that defeated the Barbary states of North Africa.

During the War of 1812, Rodgers fired the first shot of the war aboard his next flagship, , and also played a leading role in the reoccupation of Washington D.C. after it was occupied by British forces. His own hometown of Havre de Grace, Maryland was raided and burnt during the war. Later in his career he headed the Board of Navy Commissioners, and he served briefly as Secretary of the Navy. Following in his footsteps, Rodgers&#x27; son, and several grandsons and great-grandsons, also became commodores and admirals in the United States Navy.

==Early life==

Rodgers&#x27;s parents were part of a large wave of Scottish immigrants to the Thirteen Colonies in the years prior to the American Revolution. His father, John Rodgers, was born in Scotland in 1726. He emigrated to America and in 1760 married Elizabeth Reynolds (born 1742) from Delaware, who was also of Scots ancestry. They had eight children, four sons and four daughters; the younger John Rodgers was named for his father. Like many other Scots immigrants, his father became a proponent of the patriot cause and served as a colonel in the militia.

Rodgers was born in 1772 on a farm in a village near the &quot;Susquehanna Ferry&quot;, on the north shore of the Susquehanna River (near today&#x27;s Perryville) in Cecil County. This was near its mouth at the Chesapeake Bay. He was raised here for the first thirteen years of his life. While Rodgers was still a youth, the village on the south shore (in Harford County) was named &quot;Havre de Grace&quot; by Marquis de Lafayette after a famous French port of the same name. The young Rodgers was known to fish in the Susquehanna and Chesapeake Bay near his home. He attended local school, and read books about the seafaring life. He had often seen schooner-rigged ships in Havre de Grace but longed to see the large square-rigged vessels he had always read about.

Realizing Rodgers was determined to go to sea, his father helped arrange his apprenticeship with Captain Benjamin Folger, a master ship builder of Baltimore, and Revolutionary War veteran. He had served aboard merchant ships and as commander of &quot;Felicity&quot;, used in the capture of a notorious privateer. By this time, Folger was captain and owner of &quot;Maryland&quot;. Rodgers served a five-year apprenticeship on this ship.
In 1806 Rodgers married Minerva Denison; they had three sons, Robert, Frederick and John, and two daughters together. Their son John Rodgers Jr. was born in Maryland in 1812. He entered the U.S. Navy as a midshipman, serving aboard the Baltimore-built and in the Mediterranean Sea. Later he was commissioned as a rear admiral during the Civil War. Rodgers also had several grandsons and great-grandsons who became officers in the U.S. Navy.

===First command===
When Rodgers was seventeen, Captain Folger promoted him to first mate of the merchant ship &quot;Harmony&quot;. By the time Rodgers completed his five years of apprenticeship in 1793, Folger highly recommended him for command of &quot;Jane&quot;, a merchant ship regularly used in the European trade and owned by Baltimore merchants Samuel and John Smith. Rodgers served as the captain of this ship between four and five years, sailing out of Baltimore for various ports in Europe. His first voyage took him to the Spanish port of Cadiz in the early months of 1793, returning home with a load of salt. Rodgers&#x27; next voyage sent him to Hamburg, Germany, but due to severe conditions on the North Sea, he was forced to put up in England for the winter and did not reach his destination until spring of the next year. In September 1795 he departed for Baltimore from Liverpool, arriving after a passage of three months. Logbooks of the &quot;Jane&quot; during Rodgers&#x27;s command cover the period of July–August 1796 in detail, a time when France and Great Britain were still at war. During this period, Rodgers mastered the art of ship&#x27;s command.

Rodgers and his crew were tested under severe conditions on the North Sea. Winds had carried the ship off course, provisions were almost exhausted, and three of his crewmen had frozen to death in one night. Most of the rest despaired of survival. When Rodgers ordered some of the crew to go aloft to secure ice-encrusted rigging, they refused. Outraged, Rodgers stripped off his jacket and shirt and, before going aloft, told the crew to watch what a man could do. While he climbed the frozen rigging bare-chested, the crew immediately rose to his aid. They soon secured the faltering rigging. Given the grim conditions, Rodgers put the matter behind him and days later, they safely reached port.

==Naval career==

Rodgers&#x27; service in the United States Navy extended through the Quasi War with France, the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War in North Africa and through the War of 1812. In 1815 he was appointed to the Board of Naval Commissioners, serving through the Second Barbary War until he retired in 1837.

===Quasi War===
On March 8, 1798, President John Adams appointed junior officers for the first three ships constructed for the young American Navy; Rodgers was appointed second lieutenant of the frigate USS &quot;Constellation&quot;, under the command of Thomas Truxtun. All of these officers were expeditiously confirmed by the Senate the next day. Rodgers participated in the capture of the French Navy frigate &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; during &quot;Constellation&quot;″s engagement, and he immediately was made prize master of the surrendered French vessel. Rodgers, along with Midshipman Porter and eleven seamen, boarded the badly-damaged &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; with the challenge of sailing her to a friendly port while also guarding more than 160 prisoners. That evening, gale-force winds separated the two ships, leaving Rodgers, Porter, and the few American seamen aboard the now-renamed &quot;Insurgent&quot; to save the ship and to control the prisoners without support from the crew of &quot;Constellation&quot; nearby. To make matters worse, just before surrendering their ship, the crew of &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; had thrown overboard the gratings to the hold along with handcuffs and other items used to secure prisoners. Greatly outnumbered, Rodgers had seized all weapons and ordered their prisoners to the lower hold, giving orders to open fire with blunderbusses should they try to breach the passageway from their hold. After guarding the prisoners and navigating the captured vessel for two days and three nights through stormy winter weather, Rodgers arrived at Bassettere, the capital of the British colony of Saint Kitts, on February 13, 1799. Great Britain and France were still at war, so the inhabitants of Bassettere were pleased to see a captured French vessel arriving in American hands. For the Americans&#x27; effort, a British commander in St. Kitts sent Truxtun a letter of congratulations and offered him every service within his command. The two ships were then refitted and supplied while &quot;Insurgent&quot; received a new crew. On March 5, 1799, Rodgers was promoted to captain and received written orders to take command of the captured ship.

In June 1799, Rodgers relinquished command of &quot;Insurgent&quot;, then at Norfolk, Virginia, receiving a letter from Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert ordering him to Baltimore to supervise the outfitting of , a sloop-of-war bearing 20 guns, and then to take command of that ship. Three months later &quot;Maryland&quot; was commissioned under Rodgers&#x27; command. In March 1801, he delivered to France the ratified Convention of 1800 (Treaty of Mortefontaine), which ended the Quasi-War.

===First Barbary War===

Placed in command of on May 3 of the following year, Rodgers was ordered to sail for Tripoli to patrol its surrounding waters for three weeks, joining and , along with a number of other vessels. Upon his arrival he immediately approached the harbor fortifications of Tripoli and engaged the gunboats and batteries defending the city. During this time he also pursued and boarded several neutral ships that were attempting to bring grain and other supplies to Tripoli, the inhabitants of which were facing starvation and other difficulties because of the blockade. After twelve days &quot;John Adams&quot; encountered the Tripolian vessel Meshboha, bearing 20 guns, which Rodgers engaged and captured. The Tripolian vessel previously had been blockaded at Gibraltar and was carrying a load of military supplies to Tripoli. His brilliant record fighting the corsairs won Rodgers appointment as commodore of the Mediterranean Squadron in May 1805. Since Commodore James Barron&#x27;s health at this time had deteriorated, it was practically impossible for Barron to maintain command of the squadron. Receiving a letter dispatched to him by on May 22, Rodgers assumed command of the squadron consisting of the ships &quot;Constitution&quot;, &quot;President&quot;, &quot;Constellation&quot;, , &quot;Essex&quot;, , , , , , and , together with a number of gunboats (including &quot;No. 5&quot;) and bomb vessels. Rodgers was thus in command of the largest American squadron to assemble in the Mediterranean until the twentieth century. The blockading force was so overwhelming that, after much deliberation and appeals from the Dey, a peace treaty with Tripoli was negotiated by the end of July.

When news of the treaty reached Washington D.C. in the fall of 1805, President Thomas Jefferson ordered all of the ships home with the exception of a frigate and two smaller supporting vessels. Before returning home, Rodgers sailed to Malta and Syracuse to close down military hospitals and settle accounts. He stopped to pay a visit to the Dey of Algiers, who had learned of the US treaty with Tripoli, and extended every courtesy to Rodgers, allowing him to be armed in his presence. In a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin Stoddert, Rodgers later wrote &quot;I am the first Christian that has ever been permitted to visit the Dey of Algiers with sidearms...&quot;

===Other service===
A year later, Rodgers returned to the United States to take command of the New York Flotilla. After the Embargo Act of 1807 against trade with the British Empire was passed by Congress at the close of 1807, Rodgers commanded operations along the Atlantic coast enforcing its provisions.

===Torpedo test===
In 1810 Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton instructed Commodore Rodgers to oversee a series of tests or trials of inventor Robert Fulton&#x27;s new naval torpedo. Fulton had recently published &quot;Torpedo War, and Submarine Explosions&quot;, in which he argued that his newly developed torpedo was practical, and cost efficient, and would soon make most naval vessels obsolete. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were intrigued by Fulton&#x27;s idea and the US Congress authorized $5,000 to test the new weapon. Rodgers thought Fulton&#x27;s torpedo was a folly. Secretary Hamilton directed Rodgers to prepare &quot;a plan of opposition.&quot; In reply, Rodgers promised Hamilton he &quot;would not only prevent the application of any torpedoes which he has yet invented, but any which he will ever be able to invent…&quot;

On September 24, 1810, several thousand residents of New York City gathered on the banks of Corlear&#x27;s Hook overlooking the East River to watch the widely publicized demonstration of a mock torpedo attack against the brig USS &quot;Argus&quot;, commanded by Lieutenant James Lawrence. Fulton, the successful inventor of the first commercially viable steamboat, &quot;Clermont&quot;, and the first practical submarine, , was confident that his torpedo could sink a large naval vessel. Rodgers and Lt. Lawrence quickly demonstrated that Fulton&#x27;s torpedo was unable to penetrate the ship&#x27;s defense. Fulton in a final report to Hamilton reluctantly conceded he could not penetrate Rodgers&#x27; defense. While Rodgers was vindicated, the two men held no rancor toward each other. During the War of 1812 Fulton wrote Rodgers on September 14, 1814, to offer his service in defense of the port of Baltimore; before the letter arrived, the battle was over.

At the outbreak of the War of 1812, the American navy was not prepared to deal with Britain&#x27;s large and formidable navy, which consisted of hundreds of ships and seasoned commanders and crews, many of whom were already battle hardened by the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. In 1811, Rodgers was commodore of USS &quot;President&quot; off Annapolis when he heard that an American sailor had been impressed by off Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Rodgers was ordered to sea to &quot;protect American commerce&quot;, but he may have had verbal instructions to retaliate for the Royal Navy&#x27;s impressment of alleged British deserters from American vessels, which was causing much ill-feeling.

Early in 1811, Secretary of the Navy Hamilton had ordered USS &quot;President&quot; and USS &quot;Argus&quot; on patrol duty along the Atlantic coast from the Carolinas to New York. Rodgers was in command of the frigate &quot;President&quot; off the coast of North Carolina. On May 16, 1811, he sighted and followed the British sloop , commanded by Arthur Bingham, thinking it to be HMS &quot;Guerriere&quot;. Very different versions of events were given on either side. A gun was fired, with each side accusing the other of the first shot. Rodgers continued to engage the much smaller vessel and the &quot;President&quot;, bearing 44 guns, cut to pieces &quot;Little Belt&quot;, with only 20 guns. &quot;Little Belt&quot; lost 13 men killed, including a midshipman and a lieutenant, and 19 wounded, while &quot;President&quot; incurred only one wounded. The incident came to be known as the &quot;Little Belt&quot; affair. It was one among many incidents between the United States and Britain that led to the War of 1812.

===War of 1812===
When the United States declared war against the United Kingdom on June 18, 1812, many American ships lacked crews and were in need of repairs, while others were still away at sea. The only ships available for service at this time were berthed at New York, under the command of Commodore John Rodgers. These were Rodgers&#x27; own flagship, &quot;President&quot;, along with , commanded by Commodore Stephen Decatur, , commanded by Captain Smith, , commanded by Captain Lawrence, and &quot;Argus&quot;, commanded by Lieutenant Sinclair. However, British warships in American waters at this time were relatively few in number and not themselves very representative of the overall might of the Royal Navy.

Fearing that Congress might consider confining all American ships to port, as soon as Rodgers received news of the June declaration of war, he departed New York Harbor with his squadron within the hour. In anticipation of the war, Rodgers had already had his squadron fitted and ready to embark on the high seas. Their first objective was a British fleet reported to have recently departed from the West Indies, and Rodgers set a course south-east in search of these ships. &quot;President&quot; passed Sandy Hook on June 21. In the early morning of June 23, a ship was spotted on the horizon to the north-east, which turned out to be the frigate , commanded by Captain Richard Byron. Rodgers immediately gave chase, with &quot;Congress&quot; following close behind. &quot;Belvidera&quot; had already been informed of the inevitability of war by a passing New York pilot boat and immediately turned about, crowded on all sails and began flight to the north-east with a fresh wind behind all ships coming from the west.

USS &quot;President&quot; was an unusually fast frigate and by noon had gained on &quot;Belvidera&quot;, now some two and a half miles distant, approximately 75 miles south-west of Nantucket island. While &quot;President&quot; was closing with &quot;Belvidera&quot;, Captain Byron began clearing the decks and made ready his stern guns. By 4:30 the wind had relaxed some but &quot;Belvidera&quot; was now close enough to be engaged. Seizing this first possibility, &quot;President&quot;″s forecastle bow chasers fired the first shot of the war, by Rodgers himself, with two more almost immediately following. All three shots struck &quot;Belvidera&quot; at her stern, striking the rudder assembly and captain&#x27;s quarters, killing or wounding nine men. With only a few more shots needed to disable the British vessel, &quot;President&quot; fired again. But the tide of battle turned when one of its guns burst, killing 16 men, and wounding others, including Rodgers, whose leg was broken. There was a pause of panic about the entire ship, as now every gun was suspected. Byron fired his stern chasers, killing another six men. &quot;Belvidera&quot; continued to fire, damaging the rigging and foresails. &quot;President&quot; continued chase, but without adequate foresails, began yawing and losing ground. &quot;Belvidera&quot; escaped and returned to Halifax, Nova Scotia, carrying the news of the declaration of war.

Rodgers&#x27; squadron patrolled the waters off the American upper East Coast until the end of August, 1812. He commanded &quot;President&quot; for most of the war, capturing 23 prizes, one of the most successful records in the conflict. On land, Rodgers rendered valuable service by transferring his command briefly to Baltimore in September 1814. During the Battle of Baltimore, he defended the city&#x27;s east side extensive dug-in fortifications, devised by the Maryland Militia&#x27;s state commander, Major General Samuel Smith on Loudenschlager&#x27;s Hill (today&#x27;s Hampstead Hill in western Patterson Park). This was known as &quot;Rodgers&#x27; Bastion&quot;, one of several that held some of the nearly 100 pieces of artillery with 20,000 American troops that Smith had amassed to face the British. He had already sent down the southeastern &quot;Patapsco Neck&quot; peninsula, Brigadier General John Stricker&#x27;s regiments of the City Brigade at the Battle of North Point. Rodgers helped defend against the simultaneous British naval attack on Fort McHenry protecting the harbor, and when Washington was invaded and occupied, the month before after the Battle of Bladensburg.

Rodgers&#x27; home town of Havre de Grace was raided by British forces led by George Cockburn in 1813. Cockburn&#x27;s men sacked and burned Rodgers&#x27;s home, while Rodgers&#x27;s mother, wife, and two sisters fled to a friend&#x27;s house near Havre de Grace. British forces eventually reached this house, too and were under orders to burn it and others in the area. Rodgers&#x27; sister, Mrs. Goldsborough, pleaded with the officer in charge of the detail, begging him to prevent the burning of their house for the sake of their aging mother. The officer maintained that he was under strict orders and would have to obtain the consent of his commanding officer, whereupon Mrs. Goldsborough returned with the officer to again plead her case. The commanding officer agreed to spare the house, but by the time they had returned, it had already been set ablaze. However, the fire had not yet taken hold and upon hearing the news that the house was to be spared, the British saved the house from complete ruin.

In April 1814, Rodgers returned to Havre de Grace, where he received orders to take command of at Philadelphia, bearing 53 guns. Early in May of that year, he had replaced Commodore Alexander Murray, as commander of the Delaware squadron. Rodgers ordered Lieutenant Charles Morgan to take charge of the squadron to reorganize it, instructing him about outfitting the ships with armament and drilling the crew. On June 20, 1814, &quot;Guerriere&quot; was launched with a crew of 200 men, while more than 50,000 spectators gathered on the shores of the Delaware River and in small boats to witness this. During that summer Rodgers spent most of his time at Philadelphia&#x27;s naval yard outfitting this ship. The Delaware squadron comprised some 20 gunboats, sloops and galleys, and was one among several fleets assigned to patrol the chief ports along the upper Atlantic coastline.

===Burning of Washington===

Commodore John Rodgers played a major role in the reoccupation of Washington after it had been captured by British in 1814. As a naval officer he was generally unfamiliar with the tactics and deployments of land battle, yet he restored order after the occupation of Washington and he coordinated orders from Secretary of the Navy William Jones for the employment of marines and sailors as naval infantry. Along with ground forces under his two principal subordinates, Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry and Commodore David Porter, Rodgers&#x27; flotilla of ships on the Potomac River forced the British to retreat.

In the summer of 1814, American naval forces in the Chesapeake Bay consisted mainly of a fleet of gunboats under the command of Commodore Joshua Barney, a veteran of the American Revolution. On August 20, a British fleet commanded by Cockburn sailed up the Patuxent River searching for Barney&#x27;s flotilla while British troops marched in the same direction along its shore. Secretary of the Navy Jones responded by ordering Commodore Rodgers in Philadelphia and Commodore Porter in New York to proceed towards Washington with several detachments of sailors and marines. The orders were dispatched by mail but did not reach Philadelphia until ten o&#x27;clock the morning of the 22nd. As Rodgers was at Reedy Island on the Delaware River inspecting his flotilla he did not receive the Secretary&#x27;s orders until he returned at eleven o&#x27;clock that evening—-thirteen hours later. Upon receiving the dispatch Rodgers immediately made preparations to march towards Baltimore. Secretary Jones, not knowing that his initial orders had reached Rodgers later than he had anticipated, expected Rodgers to be at his designated station by the evening of the 23rd, and had sent him follow up orders that morning directing Rodgers to Bladensburg, Maryland, north-east of Washington. Consequently, Rodgers did not receive his orders until it was too late to execute them.

By August 24, Admiral Cockburn&#x27;s forces had already moved up the Patuxent, forcing Barney to abandon and burn his flotilla. With the area secured, Cockburn&#x27;s forces advanced on Washington. That afternoon they defeated American troops under General William Winder and Commodore Barney at Bladensburg; by 8 o&#x27;clock that evening British troops entered Washington. Within twenty four hours, under the direct supervision of Admiral Cockburn, the British force set fire to the Capitol building, the White House, and other government structures. With American forces defeated and in retreat, President James Madison and Secretary Jones had fled the capital and made their way up the Potomac River to remain in hiding in the countryside. Rodgers proceeded to Baltimore, arriving on the 25th. The citizens there were in a panic fearing their city would suffer the same fate as had just befallen Washington. In the panic the Americans burned &quot;Columbia&quot; and &quot;Argus&quot; which were nearby, ready for service. Upon Rodgers&#x27; arrival he immediately took up preparing defensive measures about the area, the actions of which restored order among the citizenry; with the inhabitants&#x27; courage somewhat restored, Rodgers combined his command with that of Porter&#x27;s and secured a small flotilla on the Patapsco River, which flows south-east into Chesapeake Bay at Baltimore. With a force of some thousand sailors and marines Rodgers set up defenses about Baltimore, dividing this force into two regiments, one under the command of Porter, the other under the command of Oliver Hazard Perry, who already had been stationed in Baltimore.

In the meantime, President Madison and Secretary Jones returned to Washington, but by August 27 British naval forces under the command of Captain James Gordon advanced on the capital a second time, making their approach by way of the Potomac River with two frigates and a number of smaller vessels reaching Fort Washington, twelve miles down river from the capital. The fort was abandoned when fired upon; the American forces retreated to Alexandria, five miles up river, just outside of Washington. On August 29, Gordon advanced on and captured this town and port, seizing supplies which were then loaded aboard the invading vessels. Upon receiving orders to join Admiral Cockburn&#x27;s squadron to the south, Gordon&#x27;s flotilla sailed down river but was delayed due to adverse winds near Fort Washington. Fearing the British had further designs on the capital, Secretary Jones again began preparing defensive forces. On August 29, he sent Rodgers orders to proceed to Bladensburg from Baltimore with 650 seamen and marines. The day before, Rodgers had ordered Porter to Washington; Porter&#x27;s 100 sailors and a handful of officers arrived on August 30 with the purpose of guarding the capital. The next day Rodgers and Porter together arrived at Bladensburg where Rodgers met with Secretary Jones. As the American forces were regrouped and in strong defensive positions, the British decided to withdraw. The American forces commanded by Porter and Perry began harassing the retreating British while Rodgers was attacking the British fleet with fire ships. Rodgers had previously improvised his fireships at the Washington Navy Yard. On September 3, he proceeded down the Potomac in a Gig closely followed by his fireships and barges, the latter being manned with 60 marines armed with muskets and swords. When they reached Alexandria, Rodgers entered the abandoned town and ordered the American flag hoisted.

Other battles followed with the British attempting to mount counteroffensives on the Potomac and at Baltimore, but these were ultimately frustrated largely through the efforts of forces commanded by Rodgers and Porter. The burning of Washington shocked the American public and was criticized by most European governments. According to &quot;The Annual Register&quot;, it &quot;brought a heavy censure on the British character&quot;, with some members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom joining in the criticism. However, most Britons felt it was justified retaliation for similar acts of destruction by American troops in Canada and because the United States had started the war.
===President of the Board of Navy Commissioners, 1815–1824===
In 1815, after the War of 1812 had ended, Congress established the Board of Navy Commissioners (BNC). Rodgers was a prolific political writer whose thoughts appealed to President Madison, leading him, with the consent of the Senate, to appoint Rodgers to the Board of Navy Commissioners, along with Isaac Hull and David Porter. Rodgers headed the Board from 1815 through 1824 and again from 1827 until he retired in May 1837. Rodgers also served briefly as Secretary of the Navy in 1823.
In February 1815, Commodore John Rodgers was appointed the President of the Board of Navy Commissioners. The law creating the Board gave it authority over procurement of naval stores, supplies and material as these related to the construction of naval vessels, outfitting of ships, armament and equipment plus oversight authority over naval shipyards, stations and dry-docks. The BNC also regulated civilian employment and pay. Serving with Rodgers on the Board were Commodores David Porter and Isaac Hull. The BNC found all current yards to have shortcomings. One of the most important recommendations the BNC made during Rodgers tenure was that only Portsmouth and Boston Navy Yard were suitable for the building of large ships in all seasons. Though the BNC recommended Washington Navy Yard be retained its report noted, &quot;The Yard at Washington, when viewed as building yard only, would be less objectionable [than Baltimore] were the navigation deeper and the obstructions fewer. But it is the decided opinion of the Board, that the obstructions and its distance from the sea render it unsuitable for every other purpose.&quot; The Board recommended Baltimore, Norfolk and Charleston navy yards be closed. These recommendations were controversial and became the subject of considerable partisanship, with only Baltimore and Charleston eventually phased out of existence. The BNC final report was in fact, highly critical of the Washington Navy Yard and its business practices. Writing on 11 May 1815 to Commodore Thomas Tingey the BNC stated, &quot;The Board are about contracting for the repairs of the Black Smith shop in the Navy Yard under your command for the purpose of employing workmen to put in order for service &amp; a state of preservation ... It is the intention of the Board of the Navy Commissioners, to reestablish the Navy Yard at this place, as a building Yard only, &amp; while stating to you this intention, it may not be improper for them to make you acquainted with their views generally with respect to the establishment. They have witnessed in many of our Navy Yards &amp; this particularly pressure in the employment of characters unsuited for the public service – maimed &amp; unmanageable slaves for the accommodation of distressed widows &amp; orphans &amp; indigent families - apprentices for the accommodation of their masters – &amp; old men &amp; children for the benefit of their families &amp; parents . These practices must cease – none must be employed but for the advantage of the public, &amp; this Yard instead of rendering the navy odious to the nation from the scenes of want &amp; extravagance which it has too long exhibited must serve as a model on which to prefect a general system of economy. In making to you,- Sir, these remarks the Navy Commissioners are aware that you have with themselves long witnessed the evils of which they complain, &amp; which every countenance will be given to assist you in remedying them, they calculate with confidence on a disposition on your part to forward the public interests.&quot; From November 1824 through May 1827, he commanded the Mediterranean Squadron. After his final naval command, returned to New York where he became the Navy agent at the port there.

==Societies==
During the 1820s, Rodgers was a member of the prestigious Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions.

==Final years==

Several years before Rodgers retired from the Board of Naval Commissioners his health began to decline, it is believed from a case of cholera. On advice that his condition would benefit from a leave of absence he was persuaded to take a trip across the Atlantic to England. Rodgers subsequently resigned his commission with the blessing of President Andrew Jackson and Secretary Mahlon Dickerson of the Navy. On May 10 he sailed for London, embarking from New York on the packet ship &quot;Montreal&quot; and spent several weeks in London. He also visited the towns of Plymouth and Portsmouth and was escorted and given much attention by the Admiralty and many notable people. He was the guest of two close friends, Admiral Sir James Stirling and Lady Hillyarm who were with the Mediterranean Fleet while Rodgers was serving there, dealing with the piracy of the Barbary states.

Late in August 1837 Rodgers returned to the United States with little improvement in his health. He remained at his home at Lafayette Square in Washington for several weeks, but with his health now steadily declining again he was placed in the care of the naval asylum at Philadelphia under the care of a naval doctor and friend, Dr. Thomas Harris. His wife took up residence in a boarding house nearby. Soon his already frail condition began to rapidly worsen and when it was certain his death was imminent his wife was sent for, but Rodgers had already lapsed into unconsciousness by the time she arrived at his bedside. Rodgers&#x27; last words were spoken to his butler and close friend, asking, &quot;...do you know the Lord&#x27;s Prayer?&quot; His butler replied &quot;yes, master.&quot; Rodgers responded, &quot;Then repeat it for me&quot;. Rodgers died in the arms of his butler on August 1, 1838, at the age of 66.

Rodgers&#x27; funeral took place at the home of Commodore Biddle. In attendance was Brigadier General Prevost, who had called upon the uniformed men in the city to honor Rodgers with a parade through Washington.

Rodgers was buried in the family burial site in the Congressional Cemetery at Washington, his grave marked by a pyramidal shaped sandstone monument which also bears the names of his wife, Minerva Denison, his son Frederick, and two daughters who were also laid to rest there in later years.

==Influence and legacy==

Commodore Rodgers established a naval &quot;dynasty&quot; that produced several other notable officers. His son John Rodgers (1812–1882) served in the American Civil War, and his great-grandson John Rodgers (1881–1926) served in World War I.

Six ships have been named in their honor, three as and three as .

Louisa, daughter of Commodore Rodgers, was married to Union General Montgomery C. Meigs; their son John Rodgers Meigs was killed in the Civil War in 1864. (General Meigs was a great grandson of Continental Army Colonel Return J. Meigs, Sr.).

His home, Sion Hill, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992.

<text>Stratford High School is a secondary school in Houston, Texas, United States. The school is one of four high schools in the Spring Branch Independent School District (SBISD), the district&#x27;s westernmost secondary school (serving grades 9 through 12). 
Stratford High School serves several neighborhoods, including Westchester, Sherwood Oaks, Nottingham Forest, Nottingham West, Wilchester, Gaywood, Wilchester West, Yorkshire, Memorial Townhomes, Village on Memorial Townhomes, Memorial Way, Rustling Pines, Memorial Plaza, and the SBISD portions of Thornwood and Ashford Forest.

Stratford provides courses in the traditional academic subjects, as well as several foreign languages, technology, vocational education, athletics, and fine arts. Several different Advanced Placement (AP) courses are offered at Stratford.

In keeping with the theme of its mascot, Stratford&#x27;s student newspaper is &quot;The Oracle&quot;, and its yearbook is &quot;Mnemosyne&quot;.

==Feeder patterns==
Elementary schools that feed into Stratford include:
*Meadow Wood
*Nottingham
*Thornwood
*Wilchester
*Rummel Creek (partial)
*Sherwood (partial)
*Spring Woods

Middle schools that feed into Stratford include:
*Spring Forest Middle School
*Memorial Middle School (partial)

===Feeding from private schools===
Students of some private schools, such as First Baptist Academy, Grace School, and John Paul II School, continue to Stratford.

==History==
Stratford first opened in the 1973–1974 school year. It was built to relieve the overflow of students at the nearby Westchester High School. The overflow had been caused by of the rapid development of subdivisions like Yorkshire, Wilchester, and Nottingham. The school district quickly decided to open a new school when the student population at Westchester nearly tripled to 4,000. Prior to the opening of the Stratford facility, Stratford&#x27;s students were housed in temporary buildings on the Westchester campus. The opening of Stratford was not completed on schedule due to construction delays, causing students to continue to languish in cramped quarters. The 1974 Freshman Class graduated in 1977 as the first four class of the school. The first class to graduate from Stratford was the 1975 Class.

In the 1980s, the population of Spring Branch Independent School District fell drastically. This was attributed to jobs lost to the oil crisis that affected the Houston area. Many Houston families left or moved out of the upper, middle-class area, causing an underutilization of campus space. The school district voted to close four schools: Spring Branch High School, Westchester High School and two junior highs. Students from both high schools were sent to Memorial High School with most Westchester students going to Stratford. (Westchester students who attended Memorial Junior High were given the choice of attending either Memorial or Stratford.) Students in the first mixed Stratford/Westchester graduating class of 1986 were given the choice of wearing their former Westchester High School color orange gown at graduation. Stratford, for many years, had a permanent display case dedicated to memorabilia from Westchester High School. In recent history, Stratford has maintained its enrollment at around 2000 students.

Stratford was named a 1983–84 National Blue Ribbon School.

Around 1999–2000 the Japanese Language Supplementary School of Houston, the Japanese supplementary school of Houston, moved its classes from Westchester Education Center to Stratford, but around 2000-2001 the school moved its classes back to Westchester.

In 2004, the building which housed Stratford was found to have massive structural problems, including bricks falling out of the building exterior, which required immediate attention. The Stratford campus was closed, and the students were moved to the Westchester Academy for International Studies while repairs went on at the Stratford campus. This move posed a challenge because the Westchester facility could no longer handle a student body as large as Stratford&#x27;s. Many noted the irony of the temporary move, noting that when Westchester was closed, many Westchester students were sent to Stratford, and now the situation had reversed itself. Stratford moved back into its regular facility in 2005.

In the 2006–2007 football season, the Spartans won the district title.

In February 2008 the UIL announced that Stratford would be realigned to Class 4A, District 23 effective in the 2008–2009 school year. The new alignment affected not only football, but all UIL activities. The schools in the new district stretched from Richmond to Bay City and El Campo. Spring Branch ISD appealed the realignment, citing outrage at the loss of a 34-year-long rivalry with Memorial High School, as well as concern that Stratford would have the most travel of any Houston-area school. In the appeal hearing, the UIL ruled that Stratford would be allowed to remain in Class 5A, and the Spartans were assigned to District 18, where they faced the three other SBISD schools (including Memorial), three high schools from Alief ISD, and private school Strake Jesuit. Stratford was later reclassified as a 4A school, but still played Memorial in the annual &quot;Green Out&quot; football game. With the 2014 UIL reclassification and realignment, Stratford became 5A.

==Athletics==

Stratford competes athletically with other schools in the sports of baseball, basketball, cross country, diving, football, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball. Stratford has a long-standing rivalry with fellow SBISD high school Memorial High School.

The Spartans Baseball program has placed numerous players into top college programs and 13 into the professional level, with 3 MLB players in history: Dean Crow, Chris James and Chance Sanford.

===Realignment===
The University Interscholastic League&#x27;s biennial reclassification and realignment was unveiled on Monday February 1, 2010. As part of the realignment, Stratford moved to a 4A classification along with two other SBISD schools, Northbrook and Spring Woods.

Northbrook, Spring Woods and Stratford joined 17-4A with Brenham, Magnolia, Magnolia West, Montgomery and Waller in 2011. As of the 2013 school year, the Spartans moved, yet again, to 18-4A in another realignment released in early February 2012.

In the 2014 UIL realignment, Stratford was moved yet again to 5A.

<doc id="798186" wikidata="Q432842" url="?curid=798186" title="GE Genesis">
<text>The GE Genesis (officially trademarked GENESIS) is a series of passenger diesel locomotives built by GE Transportation for Amtrak, Metro-North, and Via Rail between 1992 and 2001. A total of 321 units were produced.

Designed to meet Amtrak&#x27;s specifications, the Genesis series is tall. This allows for easier travel through low-clearance tunnels in the Northeast Corridor, especially compared to the earlier EMD F40PH which was taller.

==Technical design==
The GE Genesis series stands out for its unique, lightweight monocoque carbody design, styled by industrial designer Cesar Vergara. This innovative approach translates to improved aerodynamics and fuel efficiency compared to its predecessors. However, the complexity of the monocoque design results in slightly higher maintenance and repair costs. Notably, Amtrak equips its Genesis locomotives with bolt-on nose cones to facilitate rapid repairs in the event of a grade crossing collision.

The Genesis represents a significant leap forward in performance. It boasts a 22% improvement in fuel efficiency and delivers 25% more power compared to the F40PH. Furthermore, all Genesis locomotives utilize modern, four-stroke engines, surpassing the two-stroke technology employed in earlier EMD counterparts.

Further enhancing reliability, the Genesis is a fully computerized locomotive. Its onboard computer systems automatically manage various functions, including real-time adjustments to engine output in response to overheating, low oil pressure, or reduced airflow intake. This ensures continued operation during minor operational deviations, streamlining maintenance requirements.

All Genesis locomotives provide head-end power (HEP) to the train via an alternator or inverter powered by the main engine. This system delivers a maximum output of , capable of powering up to 16 Superliner railcars. The P40DC and P42DC models offer two HEP configurations: normal mode with the engine speed locked at 900 rpm for providing both HEP and traction power, and standby mode with the engine speed locked at 720 rpm for HEP only (no traction power). The P32AC-DM offers greater operational flexibility with its HEP inverter. The engine can run at 1,047 rpm while delivering both traction power and HEP. Additionally, it can idle at 620 rpm (notch three) while still providing HEP for lighting and air conditioning when not in use for traction.

The Genesis utilizes trucks manufactured by Krupp Verkehrstechnik [de], which has since been acquired by Siemens Mobility. Newer Genesis locomotives reflect this change and carry the Siemens name.

==Models==
Three models of Genesis were built by General Electric, the P40DC, P42DC, and P32AC-DM.

The P40DC (&quot;GENESIS Series I&quot;) or Dash 8-40BP (originally known as the AMD-103 or Amtrak Monocoque Diesel - 103MPH) is the first model in the Genesis series, built in 1993. The locomotive operates in a diesel-electric configuration that uses DC to power the traction motors, producing at 1047 rpm. Power output to the traction motors is when running in HEP mode (900 rpm) with a 0 kW HEP load. Traction power in HEP mode decreases to when providing the maximum HEP load to the train. The P40DC is geared for a maximum speed of . The P40DC was succeeded in 1996 by the P42DC.

A feature unique to the P40DC and P32AC-DM is a hostler stand at the rear of the locomotive providing increased visibility and reversing capabilities to the engineer while conducting reverse operations. When a unit is in operation from this stand it is limited to and a dead man&#x27;s switch protects against movement without an operator being present. Another unique feature to the original P40DC were the two strobes above the cab and an emergency flasher between the strobes. When they were overhauled, those features were removed.

Both the P40DC and P42DC allowed Amtrak to operate heavy long-distance trains with fewer locomotives compared to the older EMD F40PH locomotives; two P40DCs could do the same work as three F40PHs.

Additional deliveries of the P42DC ended up replacing the P40DCs. Three units were prematurely wrecked (819 in the 1993 Big Bayou Canot train wreck, 807 and 829 in the 1999 Bourbonnais, Illinois, train crash) and scrapped. Eight were leased and later sold to the Connecticut DOT for Shore Line East in 2005, and four were rebuilt and sold to New Jersey Transit in 2007; NJ Transit sold its units to ConnDOT in 2015. The remaining 28 units were placed out-of-service for many years. 15 of these units were rebuilt using 2009 ARRA stimulus funds and returned to service, now in the Phase V livery, except for 822, which is painted in Phase III Heritage livery for Amtrak&#x27;s 40th Anniversary. The units that were not rebuilt or sold have since been scrapped.

In January 2018, ConnDOT awarded a contract to Amtrak to overhaul their twelve P40DC locomotives at the Beech Grove Shops. The first unit was completed in early 2021. With the introduction of M8 EMU trains for Shore Line East service, the rebuilt P40DCs will be exclusively used on the Hartford Line.

====Upgraded and &quot;Stimulus&quot; P40DCs====
By 2007, New Jersey Transit had upgraded their P40DC units with updated prime movers to match the of the successor P42DC. This was done by readjusting the position of the lay shafts within the prime mover.

Amtrak returned 15 of their P40DC units to service as part of a project funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The first of the units were returned to service in March 2010 after being overhauled at the Beech Grove Shops. They were upgraded like NJT&#x27;s units had been a few years before to have and match the P42DC&#x27;s maximum speed of . They also received updated cab signaling systems. The upgraded locomotives still have mechanical air brakes, which makes them most suitable for trains that only require a single locomotive. This differs from the electronic air brakes on the P42DC and P32AC-DM. They also feature a builder&#x27;s plate indicating that they were rebuilt under the auspices of the TIGER stimulus program.

===P42DC===
The P42DC (&quot;GENESIS Series I&quot;) is the successor model to the P40DC. It has an engine output of at 1,047 rpm, or when running in HEP mode (900 rpm) with a 0 kW HEP load. As with the P40DC, traction horsepower in HEP mode decreases to when providing the full 800 kW HEP load to the train.

The P42DC has a maximum speed of compared to the 103 mph (166 km/h) maximum speed of the P40DC. Tractive effort is rated at of starting effort and of continuous effort at given wheel power of .

P42DCs are used primarily on most of Amtrak&#x27;s long-haul and higher-speed rail service outside the Northeast and lower Empire Corridors. They will be replaced on long-distance service by 125 Siemens ALC-42 Charger locomotives between 2021 and 2024, but will remain in service on shorter corridor trains.

Via Rail Canada has utilized P42DC locomotives since 2001, when they replaced the LRC locomotives that year. They are currently on services with speeds up to , mainly on the Quebec City-Windsor rail corridor. 

===P32AC-DM===

The P32AC-DM (&quot;GENESIS Series II&quot;, short for &quot;Passenger, , Alternating Current, Dual Mode&quot;) was developed for both Amtrak and Metro-North. They can operate on power generated either by the on-board diesel prime mover or power collected from a third rail electrification system at 750 volts direct current; the third-rail shoes are used on the over-running third-rail into Penn Station for Amtrak units and the under-running third-rail into Grand Central Terminal for Metro-North. The P32AC-DM is rated at , when supplying HEP, and is geared for a maximum speed of . Tractive effort is rated at of starting effort from zero to and of continuous effort at given wheel power of .

The P32AC-DM is unique as it is equipped with GE&#x27;s GEB15 AC (alternating current) traction motors, rather than DC (direct current) motors as used in the other subtypes. It is also only one of two modern American electro-diesel locomotives with third-rail capability, along with the EMD DM30AC operated by the Long Island Rail Road. This excludes the NJ Transit and Exo&#x27;s Bombardier ALP-45DP electro-diesel locomotives, as they can only operate from overhead catenary electrification.

The P32AC-DM is only used on services operating north from New York City, where diesel emissions through its two fully enclosed main terminal stations are prohibited. Amtrak rosters 18 P32AC-DM locomotives and uses them for its &quot;Empire Service&quot;, &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot;, &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; (New York section), &quot;Adirondack&quot;, and &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; services, all of which travel to New York Penn Station. Metro-North rosters 31 P32AC-DM locomotives on push-pull trains to Grand Central Terminal; four are owned by the Connecticut Department of Transportation. The Metro-North and ConnDOT fleet of P32AC-DM locomotives will be replaced in 2025–2027 by new Siemens SC-42DM Charger locomotives.

===P42C===

The P42C is a Non-Powered Control Unit (cab car) converted by Amtrak from retired P42DC locomotives, with the first one converted in 2024. These retain their internal components for weight purposes. Amtrak plans to eventually convert 20 Genesis locomotives into P42Cs.

<text>Ward&#x27;s Point is the southernmost point in the U.S. state of New York and lies within Tottenville, Staten Island, New York City. It is located at the mouth of Arthur Kill, across from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, at the head of Raritan Bay. The site is part of modern-day Conference House Park.

==Ward&#x27;s Point Conservation Area==
Ward&#x27;s Point Conservation Area is a historic archaeological site and national historic district. The district encompasses nine contributing sites. It includes the property on which the Conference House sits. The Conference House was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1966. The conservation area was specifically identified for preservation based on &quot;the information it may provide on prehistoric and historic Indian subsistence and settlement on Staten Island.&quot; A number of prehistoric remains have been located on the site. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

==Ward&#x27;s Point Archeological Site==
Near Ward&#x27;s Point is the Ward&#x27;s Point Archeological Site, an archaeological site within Conference House Park. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. The site has been known since 1858, when human remains were first unearthed in the area. It is one of the largest and best preserved sites for studying Native American people in the New York area.

It overlaps with the Aakawaxung Munahanung (Island Protected from the Wind) Archaeological Site in Conference House Park, which was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2021.

==Burial Ridge==
Burial Ridge is a Native American archaeological site and burial ground located at Ward&#x27;s Point.

===History===
The first documented evidence of Paleo-Indians using the site is from the end of the Early Archaic Period 8,000 years ago. The burial ground—used by the Lenape dating from the Woodland period until relinquishing Staten Island to the Dutch—is the largest pre-European burial ground in New York City and today remains unmarked and lies within Conference House Park.

Evidence of prior Native American habitation is still visible along the beach at the bluff&#x27;s lowest elevations, where erosion exposes the remains of large shell middens dominated by shells of the Eastern oyster.

Bodies were reported unearthed at Burial Ridge during various periods in the 19th century beginning in 1858. After conducting independent research, which included unearthing bodies interred at the site, ethnologist and archaeologist George H. Pepper was contracted in 1895 to conduct paid archaeological research at Burial Ridge by the American Museum of Natural History.

Many of the skeletons unearthed were buried in flexed positions, with the knees drawn up to the chest; fewer were found in a laid-out position. Most of the graves were fairly shallow, ranging from in depth below grade. Many of the graves contained assorted grave goods, among them arrowheads and various stone implements such as ax heads and hammerstones.

One of the burials contained the skeletons of three males, with the bones pierced by 23 arrowheads made of bone, antler, argillite and flint.

Close to the three males, the body of a child was unearthed with a variety of grave goods, including pendants made of yellow jasper and various utensils. The body also showed evidence of copper salts about the lower portion of the skull, mandible and sternum, which indicated that copper ornaments were buried with the body. An additional skeleton unearthed in a prone position was completely charred above the knees, suggesting he may have been burned alive while tied to a stake.

<doc id="798278" wikidata="Q186244" url="?curid=798278" title="Leiden Observatory">
<text>Leiden Observatory () is an astronomical institute of Leiden University, in the Netherlands. Established in 1633 to house the quadrant of Willebrord Snellius, it is the oldest operating university observatory in the world, with the only older still existing observatory being the Vatican Observatory.

The observatory was initially located on the university building in the centre of Leiden before a new observatory building and dome were constructed in the university&#x27;s botanical garden in 1860. It remained there until 1974 when the department moved to the science campus north-west of the city. Notable astronomers that have worked or directed the observatory include Willem de Sitter, Ejnar Hertzsprung and Jan Oort.

==History==

===1633–1860===

Leiden University established the observatory in 1633; astronomy had been on the curriculum for a long time, and due to possession of a large quadrant built by Rudolph Snellius, Jacobus Golius requested an observatory in which to use it. The observatory was one of the first purpose-built observatories in Europe. Though Golius used the observatory regularly, no publications came from its use by him. It is not known whether Golius had any instrumentation other than Snellius&#x27; quadrant at the observatory.

In 1682 Burchardus de Volder became professor of mathematics at the university and thus took over responsibility for the observatory. During his tenure, the observatory was enlarged, including a second turret to house a brass sextant which he purchased, and the rebuilding of the old turret. Both turrets had rotating roofs. Upon retiring in 1705, de Volder handed over a catalogue of instruments which showed that the observatory owned two other quadrants, a 12-inch telescope, two objectives, and several smaller telescopes. For the next two years, Lotharius Zumbach de Coesfeld ran the observatory until his appointment as professor of mathematics in Kassel in 1708. Between then and 1717 the observatory went without a director until Willem &#x27;s Gravesande was appointed director. During his time at the observatory, Gravesande purchased a number of new instruments including new telescopes and tools, before his death in 1742.

Gravesande&#x27;s successor was Johan Lulofs who used the observatory to observe Halley&#x27;s comet in 1759 and solar transits of Mercury (in 1743 and 1753) and Venus (in 1761). In November 1768 when Lulofs died, Dionysius van de Wijnpersse took over responsibility for the observatory until Pieter Nieuwland became its director in 1793 for a year until he died in 1794. For a number of years the curators attempted to find a suitable astronomer to look after the observatory, eventually employing Jan Frederik van Beeck Calkoen in 1799, who left in 1805.

In 1817 the observatory towers were pulled down and rebuilt. Frederik Kaiser was appointed lecturer of astronomy and director of the observatory in 1837, and again renovated the observatory, providing the towers with rotatable roofs with full shutters, and reinforcing the north-western tower. Kaiser also acquired a number of new instruments and telescopes with which he made observations including that of comets, planets, and binary stars.

As a result of the increased interest in astronomy brought about due to Kaiser&#x27;s popular writings and teachings, a commission was founded in 1853 to fund a new observatory. From 1859 to 1909 the Netherlands civil time was set according to the local civil time at the observatory; communicated using the telegraphic network.

===1860–1974===
By 1860 the new observatory building was completed. The new building was constructed in a quiet side of the city inside the university&#x27;s botanical gardens. It consisted of a number of offices, living quarters for astronomers, and a number of observing domes containing telescopes. In 1873 two new rooms were added to the building in order to house the tools required to verify nautical instruments; tools used to test compasses, sextants and other instruments. Two of the domes were rebuilt, one in 1875 and the other in 1889.

More new buildings were constructed before the end of the 19th century including the Western tower in 1878, one to the East in 1898, and another small building to house a gas engine in the same year (used for electricity until the observatory was connected to the city grid). In 1896 the observatory purchased their first photographic telescope, with a dome being built to house it between then and 1898.

In 1923 the observatory formed a research agreement with Union Observatory to allow researchers use of both facilities. The first visitor from Leiden was Ejnar Hertzsprung. In 1954 the telescopes were moved to Hartbeespoort. The collaboration lasted until 1972.

The old Observatory building of this period was restored from 2008 to 2012, and in the 2010s houses a visitor center and also has tours.

===1974- Present===
The astronomy department moved to the science campus north-west of the city centre in 1974. Although professional astronomical observations are no longer carried out from Leiden itself, the department still calls itself Leiden Observatory. In much of astronomy, the data came from elsewhere and could be analyzed and studied on the campus; for example in modern times the instruments may even be located in space, with data transmitted back to Earth and then studied on a computer display. (An example of this was the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite, launched in 1974.)

The archive of the Leiden Observatory is available at Leiden University Library and digitally accessible through Digital Collections

=== Einstein&#x27;s Chair in the Ten-inch dome ===
Einstein&#x27;s Chair is an astronomical observing chair at the Leiden Observatory. This chair, made in 1861, is the only piece of furniture in the observatory that dates from that time. The chair gets its name from the fact that it was used by Albert Einstein on several occasions during his visits to the observatory. Einstein was a frequent visitor of the building during his professorship at Leiden university due to his good friendship with the director, Willem de Sitter. The chair can be found in the largest dome of the observatory, the so-called 10-inch dome (named after the 10-inch telescope that is placed inside). The chair is still used by observers and a popular attraction at the observatory.

On 21 October 2015, Einstein&#x27;s Chair got a short segment on the Dutch astronomy program &quot;Heel Nederland Kijkt Sterren&quot;. During this segment the science populariser Govert Schilling and the science historian David Baneke talked about its origins.

Einstein is noted for his visits to Leiden Observatory during World War I.

===Restoration===
The old Observatory building facilities (from 1860s) was restored in the 2010s. While not longer the base for the modern Leiden Observatory academically, it does have the astronomical historical items at the facility. Also, a solar telescope was crowd funded to provide live optically transmitted images of the Sun to the Visitor center, which is also known to have offered tours.

<doc id="798294" wikidata="Q1224765" url="?curid=798294" title="Digital Linear Tape">
<text>Digital Linear Tape (DLT; previously called CompacTape) is a magnetic-tape data storage technology developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) from 1984 onwards. In 1994, the technology was purchased by Quantum Corporation, who manufactured drives and licensed the technology and trademark. A variant with higher capacity is called Super DLT (SDLT). The lower cost &quot;value line&quot; was initially manufactured by Benchmark Storage Innovations under license from Quantum. Quantum acquired Benchmark in 2002.

In 2007, Quantum stopped developing DLT drives, shifting its strategy to LTO.

==History==

DEC launched the TK50 tape drive for the MicroVAX II and PDP-11 minicomputers in 1984. This used 22-track CompacTape I cartridges, storing 94 MB per cartridge. The TK50 was superseded in 1987 by the TK70 drive and the 48-track CompacTape II cartridge, capable of storing 294 MB. In 1989, the CompacTape III (later DLTtape III) format was introduced, increasing the number of tracks to 128 and capacity to 2.6 GB. Later drives into the early 1990s improved the data density of the DLTtape III cartridge, up to 10 GB. The DLTtape IV cartridge was introduced by Quantum in 1994, with increased tape length and data density, initially offering 20 GB per tape. Super DLTtape, originally capable of up to 110 GB, was launched in 2001.

==Technology==
DLT uses linear serpentine recording with multiple tracks on half-inch (12.7 mm) wide tape. The cartridges contain a single reel and the tape is pulled out of the cartridge by means of a leader tape attached to the take-up reel inside the drive. The drive leader tape is buckled to the cartridge leader during the load process. Tape speed and tension are controlled electronically via the reel motors; there is no capstan. The tape is guided by 4 to 6 rollers that touch only the back side of the tape. Tape material is metal particle tape (MP/AMP).

SDLT adds an optical servo system that reads servo patterns on the back of the tape to keep the data tracks on the front of the tape correctly aligned with the read/write heads. This is important for newer tape media, which have very thin, dense data tracks; 256, 384 and 768 data tracks on a tape are available. 

DLT7000 and 8000 tilt the head forward and backward to reduce crosstalk between adjacent tracks through azimuth; this is called Symmetric Phase Recording.

All (S)DLT drives support hardware data compression. The often-used compression factor of 2:1 is optimistic and generally only achievable for text data; a more realistic factor for a file system is 1.3:1 to 1.5:1, although drive compression applied to pre-compressed data can actually make the written data larger than having compression turned off in the tape drive.

Media are guaranteed for 30 years of data retention under specified environmental conditions; they are easily damaged by mishandling (dropping or improper packaging during shipment.)

Manufacturers of cartridges for the DLT/SDLT market are Fujifilm, Hitachi/Maxell and Imation. VStape is made by Sony. All other companies/brands (even Quantum) are contractors and/or resellers of these companies.

A new naming convention took effect in 2005, calling the performance line DLT-S and the value line DLT-V.

DLT includes Write Once Read Many (WORM) capability.

In February 2007, Quantum stopped developing the next generations of DLT drives (S5 and V5) after insufficient market acceptance of the S4 and V4 drives, shifting its drive strategy to LTO.

==Generations==

===Drives===
===Media===
 DLTtape IV can support both DLT4000/7000/8000 and DLT1/DLT-VS80 for full functions; once DLTtape IV media has been written to or formatted in a DLT7000/8000 drive, this media cannot be read, written to, or formatted in a DLT1/DLT-VS80 drive unless it is degaussed. Once the media has been written to or formatted in a DLT4000 drive, the media cannot be written to or formatted in a DLT1/DLT-VS80 drive unless it is degaussed but it can be read. This is because the DLT1/VS series use a different recording format that is not fully supported by the other family.

Tapes written in value series drives can typically be read in (and often written to) higher end drives of a similar vintage, so long as the drive&#x27;s technical specifications contain interoperability options.

<doc id="798300" wikidata="Q6255366" url="?curid=798300" title="John Rodgers (naval officer, born 1881)">
<text>John Augustus Rodgers Jr. (January 15, 1881 – August 27, 1926) was an officer in the United States Navy and a pioneering aviator.

==Biography==
Rodgers was the great-grandson of Commodores Rodgers and Perry. He was born in Washington, D.C. and graduated from the Naval Academy in 1903 where he played football and rowed crew. His early naval career included service on ships of various types before studying flying in 1911 and becoming the second American naval officer to fly for the United States Navy, designated as U.S. Naval aviator No. 2. 
===Early aviation career===
Rodgers learned to fly in San Diego under the instruction of Glenn Curtiss. On February 1, 1911, Rodgers, now a lieutenant, participated in an experiment under the direction of Captain Washington Irving Chambers, the first Navy officer assigned to development of the nascent U.S. Naval aviation program, that involved a man-lifting kite. A train of 11 man-raising kites lifted Rodgers to a record 400 feet off the deck of USS Pennsylvania (ACR-4). This was the same ship on which Eugene Ely performed the first shipboard landing of an airplane days earlier. As the ship steamed along at a 12 kt clip, Rodgers worked against an 8-kt breeze while suspended from a kite cable 100 yards astern. He made observations and took photographs for 15 minutes, signaling his observations back to the ship. Reportedly, he had a clear view for over 40 miles. 

On March 17, 1911, Rodgers reported to the Wright Company in Dayton, Ohio, to receive flight training. This was in response to the Wright Brothers offering to train one pilot for the Navy. He was only the second Navy officer to receive such instruction, and the first to receive it from the Wrights. 

On July 1, 1911, Rodgers was on a leave of absence from the Navy while the aviation facilities at Greenbury Point on the grounds of the United States Naval Academy were being prepared. He filled this time performing aerial demonstrations in Ohio with his cousin, Calbraith Perry Rodgers. On their way back to Dayton from Springfield, having just finalized a contract to perform at the Fourth of July celebration there, they reportedly borrowed the Wright flyer kept at the Wright brothers&#x27; field at Simms, Ohio, without permission. The two made a few successful flights and things were going well, until they damaged a wing on one of the landings. Once informed, the Wright brothers insisted upon the use of the Rodgers plane until theirs was repaired, costing them some business engagements.

The Wright biplane arrived at Greenbury Point on the grounds of the United States Naval Academy on September 6, 1911. Rodgers completed the acceptance flight for it the next day then embarked on a flight from the Naval Academy to Washington, D.C. This was the first time it had ever been attempted. After circling the academy grounds for several turns, he set out on the 45-mile trip to D.C., following the tracks of the Washington, Baltimore, and Annapolis electric line, flanked by his friends following in automobiles. After flying around a thunderstorm near Odenton, Maryland, he overflew the Army aviation camp at College Park, Maryland. He then overflew the Bennings neighborhood in D.C. and commenced down the eastern branch of the Potomac. After passing over the United States Army War College, he turned toward the city at an altitude of 2000 feet. He reached the city at about 4:45 pm then circled the Washington Monument for 15 minutes where he executed several maneuvers before landing near the White House at 5:04 pm in front of a small crowd. At the time, it was one of the longest, most successful flights in Naval Aviation. After exchanging greetings with CAPT Chambers, he flew back to Annapolis.

On September 16, Rodgers became the first man in America to visit his parents by airplane. He departed College Park, Maryland, at 1:15 in the afternoon; passing over the northwestern section of Baltimore, he landed at the Pimlico racetrack, where he refueled. Afterwards, he circled Pimlico for half an hour at various altitudes and was then off to Havre de Grace, arriving at the Rodgers home at Sion Hill at 5:35. His father, Rear Admiral John Augustus Rodgers Sr., his mother, and brother Robert greeted him upon landing in a field 200 yards from their house. Following the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad from Baltimore into the city, he landed with less than a quart of fuel. Crowds gathered in along his route of flight to cheer him on. His intention was to leave the next day for New York, where his cousin Calbraith Perry Rodgers was to depart Sheepshead Bay for San Francisco that afternoon to compete for the $50,000 Hearst Prize.

In late November 1911, Rodgers was at the Navy aviation camp at Annapolis developing a life preserver for use in hydroplane flights. The life preserver was described as being &quot;very similar to a baseball catcher&#x27;s breast protector&quot; and was worn in a similar fashion. Designed to keep a man afloat until help arrived, the waist and neck straps were rubber tubes that were inflated along with the rest of the vest when in use over water. 

===Return to sea===
He commanded Division 1, Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet in 1916; and, after the United States entered World War I, he commanded the Submarine Base at New London, Connecticut. Following the war, he served in European waters and received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for outstanding work on minesweeping operations in the North Sea. 

===First non-stop flight to Hawaii attempt===

After several important assignments during the next five years, he commanded Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet, in Langley in 1925. That year he led the first attempt at a non-stop flight from California to Hawaii. Given the technology of the time, this tested the limits of both aircraft range
and the accuracy of aerial navigation. The expedition was to include three planes. Rodgers commanded the flying boat PN-9 No. 1. The PN-9 No. 3 was commanded by Lt. Allen P. Snody. The third plane was to have been a new design, which was not completed in time to join the expedition. Due to the risks, the Navy positioned 10 guard ships spaced 200 miles apart between California and Hawaii to refuel or recover the aircraft if necessary. The two PN-9s departed San Pablo Bay, California (near San Francisco) on August 31. Lt. Snody&#x27;s plane had an engine failure about five hours into its flight, was forced to land in the ocean, and was safely recovered.

Rodgers&#x27;s flight proceeded with few difficulties for more than 1200 miles. However, higher than expected fuel consumption and a weaker than predicted tailwind made it necessary for the plane to land in the ocean and refuel. The plane headed for a refueling ship, but limitations of the navigation technology and erroneous navigation information provided by the ship&#x27;s crew caused Rodgers and his crew to miss the ship. The flying boat was forced to land in the ocean when it ran out of fuel on September 1. Since the position of the plane was not known while it was in the air and the plane&#x27;s radio could not transmit when the plane was floating on the water, Rodgers and his crew were not found by an extensive, multi-day search by planes and a large number of ships. After passing a night without rescue, Rodgers and his crew used fabric from a wing to make a sail and sailed towards Hawaii, several hundred miles away. Later the plane&#x27;s crew used metal flooring to fashion leeboards to improve their ability to steer the flying boat while it was sailing. Finally, nine days later, after sailing the plane 450 miles to within 15 miles of Nawiliwili Bay, Kauai, the plane and its crew were found by submarine under the command of Lt. Donald R. Osborn, Jr, (USNA class of 1920), after a search by the US Navy. They were towed near the reef outside of the port. The harbor master and his daughter rowed out to the plane and helped Rodgers and his crew surf over the reef and into the safety of the harbor. By the time they were found by the submarine, Rodgers and his crew had subsisted a week without food and with limited water. He later shared with a newspaper, &quot;We were taken care of by the good people of the island, who insisted on treating us as invalids, whereas as a matter of fact we were in very good shape and perfectly capable of taking care of ourselves.&quot; After their return, Rodgers and his crew were treated as heroes. Also, despite not reaching Hawaii by air, their flight established a new non-stop air distance record for seaplanes of 1992 miles (3206 km).

After this experience, Rodgers served as assistant chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics until his accidental death in an airplane crash after the plane he was piloting suddenly nose-dived into the Delaware River on August 27, 1926. He is interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

After Rodgers&#x27; untimely death, it would be the first time since 1776 that the United States Navy did not count a serving member of the Rodgers family amongst their ranks.

==Legacy==
Six ships were named in honor of Rodgers, his grandfather, and his great-grandfather, all named either or . 

Two airfields on Oahu were named after Rodgers. In 1927, the territory established John Rodgers Airport on the site of what is now Daniel K. Inouye International Airport; the overseas terminal building (now designated Terminal 2) is known as the John Rodgers Terminal. Independently, the U.S. Navy named the airfield at Naval Air Station Barbers Point as John Rodgers Field. With the closure of the naval base in 1999, the airfield was transferred to civilian control and renamed Kalaeloa Airport, with an FAA identification code of JRF to preserve the historical connection.

He was a cousin of pioneer transcontinental pilot Cal Rodgers.

In 2007, a full-length feature screenplay, &quot;Hawaii Calls&quot;, depicting these historic events was created by Rick Helin, a California screenwriter. As of early 2008, it was in the early pre-production stage.

<doc id="798309" wikidata="Q6615002" url="?curid=798309" title="List of current first ministers of Canada">
<text>Canada is a federation that comprises ten provinces and three territories. Its government is structured as a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy, with a monarch as its sovereign and a Prime Minister as its head of government. Each of the country&#x27;s provinces and territories also has a head of government, called &quot;premier&quot; in English. Collectively, the federal Prime Minister and provincial and territorial premiers are referred to as first ministers. In French, the term is used in both the federal and provincial/territorial contexts.
The longest-serving current first minister is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who assumed office on November 4, 2015; the newest first minister is Rob Lantz of Prince Edward Island, who assumed office on February 21, 2025. The oldest first minister, François Legault of Quebec, is ; the youngest first minister, P.J. Akeeagok of Nunavut, is . Of the current first ministers, two (Danielle Smith of Alberta and Susan Holt of New Brunswick) are women and three (P.J. Akeeagok of Nunavut, Wab Kinew of Manitoba, and R.J. Simpson of the Northwest Territories) are Indigenous.

Of the current first ministers, four are from Liberal parties, three are from Progressive Conservative parties, and two are from New Democratic parties - however, note that federal and provincial/territorial parties that share common names are not necessarily affiliated with or politically analogous to one another. Three other first ministers are from locally branded parties (the Coalition Avenir Québec, the Saskatchewan Party, and the United Conservative Party) and two are non-partisan.

==Current first ministers of Canada==
Premiers are listed in accordance with the provincial order of precedence: provinces before territories, and by order of joining confederation within those categories; where multiple jurisdictions joined confederation in the same year, they are ordered by population at the time of joining. Incumbency is current as of .

<doc id="798323" wikidata="Q4705100" url="?curid=798323" title="Ala Moana Beach Park">
<text>Ala Moana Beach Park is a free public park on the island of Oahu, U.S. state of Hawaii, located between Waikiki and downtown Honolulu. This park has a wide gold-sand beach that is over a half-mile (800 m) long.

Protected by a shallow reef offshore, it is one of the most popular open ocean swimming sites in Hawai’i, with an estimated 4 million visitors annually. However, there are sharp corals, so most people prefer the east end of the beach (the one that&#x27;s closer to Diamond Head) where the ocean bottom is sandy and has no reef or rocks. The middle section and west end of the beach has rocks on the nearshore ocean bottom, which makes entering the ocean trickier. Lifeguards are stationed on the beach daily.

Ala Moana&#x27;s ocean bottom drops quickly, so novice swimmers should use caution. Big grassy areas, banyans and palm trees make the park a good place to picnic, barbecue, play various ball games or go running. There are lifeguards, showers, restrooms, phones, tennis courts, picnic tables, food concessions and a music pavilion. Ala Moana Beach Park is a favorite among Honolulu residents. It is right next to &quot;Magic Island&quot; where many cultural events are held.

The park is closed from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. Police enforce the closure with citations and arrests.

Like almost all of Honolulu&#x27;s city parks, Ala Moana Beach Park had many homeless people during the day and night, until the city started closing the park for the night in 2006. Fodors travel guide rated it a &quot;high crime area&quot; at night after dark partly on this basis.

==History==


Ala Moana Regional Park as we know it today rests on reclaimed land that was once swampy marshland. In the 1920s Ala Moana Beach Park was a wetland with bulrushes, kiawe trees, and coconut palms that the city used as a garbage dump. The land appears to have been included in land transferred to the US government following annexation. The federal government then deeded the land back to the Territory of Hawaii and then the city of Honolulu in 1927, with the condition that the property be used wholly as a public park.

In 1931, the Parks Board designated the land as Moana Park and initiated development. The Hawaiian Dredging Company deposited their dredgings much of which was coral reef to fill in the marsh. The park added a sport pavilion, lawn bowling green, Banyan court, and bridal path bridge. The pavilion includes murals painted by and bas relief sculptures made by Marguerite Louis Blasingame. The bowling green was designed by Henry Sims Bent.

Dredging created two ponds and drainage canals, which allowed runoff of natural water. The bridges and entry portals were also designed by Henry Sims Bent.

The Sports Pavilion, Banyan Garden, tennis courts, and murals by Robert Lee Eskridge were completed in 1937 as part of the New Deal efforts by the Civil Works Administration and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. While the Federal government provided the labor, local resources were required for construction materials. Construction of the walls and terraces used a technique called concrete boulder construction. This allowed use of inexpensive materials and tools and local workers with limited construction experience.
During World War II (1941-1946), the park was used as a staging area and military battery. The military constructed barracks, an armory, and temporary fortification to support a heavier presence of personnel and weapons

Originally named Moana Park, the Parks Board changed the park’s name to Ala Moana, “path [to the] sea” in 1947. The beach was created in 1954. The deep swimming area fronting the beach is a former boat channel that was dredged through the coral reef in the late 1920s to join Kewalo Basin with the Ala Wai Harbor. In 1955, Hawaiian Dredging Company closed the west end of the channel with a landfill, now Kewalo Basin Park. Originally dredged for boat traffic, the channel is 20 to 30 feet deep and 1,000 yards long. From 1957 to 1961, concession stands and bathrooms were added. Henry Kaiser suggested the creation of a “magic island” of hotels, theaters, and swimming pools. The existing park would have been made into a parking lot.

The land was constructed in 1962 through the reclamation of thirty acres of shallow reef. Named Magic Island by the developers, the peninsula was the first phase of a resort hotel complex that called for two more islands to be constructed on the reef off Ala Moana Beach Park. After public outcry, the project stopped after the development of Magic Island, leaving the State with a man-made peninsula, which they converted into a public park. In 1972 the State officially renamed Magic Island ‘Aina Moana, or “land [from the] sea,” to recognize that the park is made from dredged coral fill, but residents still call it Magic Island.

McCoy Pavilion was added to the Diamond Head side of the courtyard in 1975 and is named after Charles Lester McCoy, who presided over the creation of the park in the 1930s. McCoy’s widow donated $1.2 million for construction after her death. McCoy Pavilion is currently used for special events such as the annual Greek Festival and the Hawaiian Scottish Festival and Highland games.

The park was added to the Hawaii State Register of Historic Places in 1988.

==Improvement plans==

The city of Honolulu has proposed an improvement plan for Ala Moana Beach Park and Magic Island. The proposal includes changes to parking, replenishment of the beach sand, renovations to canals, ponds, McCoy Pavilion, the lawn bowling and canoe halau areas, repairs to the canal bridge and park entrances, improved pedestrian access near Piikoi and Queen streets, and the addition of a dog park and playground. The proposed changes to parking and the dog park have been controversial, so the city has amended the proposals and sought additional public comment. 

Of note, changes to parking have been controversial in the past; the 1975 park plan called for cars to be prohibited from the park roadways and three multistory garages for cars to be built.

<text>Shellharbour (also known as Shellharbour Village) is a suburb located in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia. It also gives its name to the local government area, City of Shellharbour, and its central business district, Shellharbour City Centre.

The suburb is centred on the small recreational harbour named Shell Harbour. It has two main beaches: Shellharbour Beach, which runs to Barrack Point and Shellharbour South Beach, which runs toward Bass Point.

Shellharbour hosts Harbourside Markets on the fourth Sunday of the month, in Little Park.

== History and culture ==
The area was inhabited by indigenous Australians for thousands of years. European habitation began from about 1817 onwards.
Shellharbour was originally known as &quot;Yerrowah&quot; and later as &quot;Peterborough&quot;.

Shellharbour&#x27;s coastline is littered with 9 shipwrecks, and other historical sites like Bass Point which is home to various Aboriginal archaeological evidence. The shipwrecks date back to 1851, and are all protected under the State NSW Heritage Act 1977 &amp; Commonwealth Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976.

Shipwrecks include:
* Alexander Berry – Wrecked at Bass Point on 1 July 1901.
* Amphitrite – Ran aground at Shellharbour on 15 May 1851.
* Bertha – Wrecked in a gale on 9 September 1879.
* Cities Service Boston – Went ashore at Bass Point on 16 May 1943.
* Comboyne – Wrecked off Bass Point on 27 November 1920.
* Echo – Wrecked near Long Point on 21 March 1863.
* Franz – Wrecked near Lake Illawarra on 9 September 1879.
* Our Own – Ran aground at Bass Point on 21 August 1880.

==Facilities==
Shellharbour is undergoing extensive development with the construction of many new retail outlets and home-units. The main street is Addison Street, with many footpath cafés and shops and the Roo Theatre Company, running through the town and ending with the Ocean Beach Hotel opposite the harbour. Adjacent to the harbour is the Beverley Whitfield saltwater swimming pool and across from the Shellharbour Beach facilities is the Beverley Whitfield park, containing the Tom &quot;Scout&quot; Willoughby cricket oval.

==Demographics==
According to the of population, there were 3,520 people in Shellharbour.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.8% of the population. 
* 81.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England 4.5%. 
* 88.5% of people only spoke English at home. 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 35.7%, Catholic 27.5% and Anglican 17.2%.

<doc id="798332" wikidata="Q3086110" url="?curid=798332" title="Arabic phonology">
<text>While many languages have numerous dialects that differ in phonology, contemporary spoken Arabic is more properly described as a continuum of varieties. This article deals primarily with Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the standard variety shared by educated speakers throughout Arabic-speaking regions. MSA is used in writing in formal print media and orally in newscasts, speeches and formal declarations of numerous types.

Modern Standard Arabic has 28 consonant phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes. All phonemes contrast between &quot;emphatic&quot; (pharyngealized) consonants and non-emphatic ones. Some of these phonemes have coalesced in the various modern dialects, while new phonemes have been introduced through borrowing or phonemic splits. A &quot;phonemic quality of length&quot; applies to consonants as well as vowels.

== History ==
Of the 29 Proto-Semitic consonants, only one has been lost: , which merged with , while became (see Semitic languages). Various other consonants have changed their sound too, but have remained distinct. An original lenited to , and – consistently attested in pre-Islamic Greek transcription of Arabic languages – became palatalized to or by the time of the Quran and , , or after early Muslim conquests and in MSA (see Arabic phonology#Local variations for more detail). An original voiceless alveolar lateral fricative became . 

Its emphatic counterpart was considered by Arabs to be the most unusual sound in Arabic (Hence the Classical Arabic&#x27;s appellation &#x27; or &quot;language of the &#x27;&quot;). For most modern dialects, it has become an emphatic stop with loss of the laterality or with complete loss of any pharyngealization or velarization, . The classical &quot;&quot; pronunciation of pharyngealization still occurs in the Mehri language, and the similar sound without velarization, , exists in other Modern South Arabian languages.Other changes may also have happened. Classical Arabic pronunciation is not thoroughly recorded and different reconstructions of the sound system of Proto-Semitic propose different phonetic values. One example is the emphatic consonants, which are pharyngealized in modern pronunciations but may have been velarized in the eighth century and glottalized in Proto-Semitic.

Reduction of and between vowels occurs in a number of circumstances and is responsible for much of the complexity of third-weak (&quot;defective&quot;) verbs. Early Akkadian transcriptions of Arabic names show that this reduction had not yet occurred as of the early part of the 1st millennium BC.

The Classical Arabic language as recorded was a poetic koine that reflected a consciously archaizing dialect, chosen based on the tribes of the western part of the Arabian Peninsula, who spoke the most conservative variants of Arabic. Even at the time of Muhammed and before, other dialects existed with many more changes, including the loss of most glottal stops, the loss of case endings, the reduction of the diphthongs and into monophthongs , etc. Most of these changes are present in most or all modern varieties of Arabic.

An interesting feature of the writing system of the Quran (and hence of Classical Arabic) is that it contains certain features of Muhammad&#x27;s native dialect of Mecca, corrected through diacritics into the forms of standard Classical Arabic. Among these features visible under the corrections are the loss of the glottal stop and a differing development of the reduction of certain final sequences containing : Evidently, the final became as in the Classical language, but final became a different sound, possibly (rather than again in the Classical language). This is the apparent source of the &quot;alif maqṣūrah&quot; &#x27;restricted alif&#x27; where a final is reconstructed: a letter that would normally indicate or some similar high-vowel sound, but is taken in this context to be a logical variant of &quot;alif&quot; and represent the sound .

== Literary Arabic ==

The &quot;colloquial&quot; spoken dialects of Arabic are learned at home and constitute the native languages of Arabic speakers. &quot;Formal&quot; Modern Standard Arabic is learned at school; although many speakers have a native-like command of the language, it is technically not the native language of any speakers. Both varieties can be both written and spoken, although the colloquial varieties are rarely written down and the formal variety is spoken mostly in formal circumstances, e.g., in radio and TV broadcasts, formal lectures, parliamentary discussions and to some extent between speakers of different colloquial dialects. 

Even when the literary language is spoken, it is normally only spoken in its pure form when reading a prepared text out loud and communicating between speakers of different colloquial dialects. When speaking extemporaneously (i.e. making up the language on the spot, as in a normal discussion among people), speakers tend to deviate somewhat from the strict literary language in the direction of the colloquial varieties. There is a continuous range of &quot;in-between&quot; spoken varieties: from nearly pure Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), to a form that still uses MSA grammar and vocabulary but with colloquial influence, to a form of the colloquial language that imports a number of words and grammatical constructions in MSA, to a form that is close to pure colloquial but with the &quot;rough edges&quot; (the most noticeably &quot;vulgar&quot; or non-Classical aspects) smoothed out, to pure colloquial. 

The particular variant (or &quot;register&quot;) used depends on the social class and education level of the speakers involved and the level of formality of the speech situation. Often it will vary within a single encounter, e.g., moving from nearly pure MSA to a more mixed language in the process of a radio interview, as the interviewee becomes more comfortable with the interviewer. This type of variation is characteristic of the diglossia that exists throughout the Arabic-speaking world.

Although Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is a unitary language, its pronunciation varies somewhat from country to country and from region to region within a country. The variation in individual &quot;accents&quot; of MSA speakers tends to mirror corresponding variations in the colloquial speech of the speakers in question, but with the distinguishing characteristics moderated somewhat. It is important in descriptions of &quot;Arabic&quot; phonology to distinguish between pronunciation of a given colloquial (spoken) dialect and the pronunciation of MSA by these same speakers. 

Although they are related, they are not the same. For example, the phoneme that derives from Classical Arabic has many different pronunciations in the modern spoken varieties, e.g., including the proposed original . Speakers whose native variety has either or will use the same pronunciation when speaking MSA. Even speakers from Cairo, whose native Egyptian Arabic has , normally use when speaking MSA. The of Persian Gulf speakers is the only variant pronunciation which is not found in MSA; is used instead, but may use [j] in MSA for comfortable pronunciation. 

Another reason of different pronunciations is influence of colloquial dialects. The differentiation of pronunciation of colloquial dialects is the influence from other languages previously spoken and some still presently spoken in the regions, such as Coptic in Egypt, Berber, Punic, or Phoenician in North Africa, Himyaritic, Modern South Arabian, and Old South Arabian in Yemen and Oman, and Aramaic and Canaanite languages (including Phoenician) in the Levant and Mesopotamia.

Another example: Many colloquial varieties are known for a type of vowel harmony in which the presence of an &quot;emphatic consonant&quot; triggers backed allophones of nearby vowels (especially of the low vowels , which are backed to in these circumstances and very often fronted to in all other circumstances). In many spoken varieties, the backed or &quot;emphatic&quot; vowel allophones spread a fair distance in both directions from the triggering consonant. In some varieties, most notably Egyptian Arabic, the &quot;emphatic&quot; allophones spread throughout the entire word, usually including prefixes and suffixes, even at a distance of several syllables from the triggering consonant. 

Speakers of colloquial varieties with this vowel harmony tend to introduce it into their MSA pronunciation as well, but usually with a lesser degree of spreading than in the colloquial varieties. For example, speakers of colloquial varieties with extremely long-distance harmony may allow a moderate, but not extreme, amount of spreading of the harmonic allophones in their MSA speech, while speakers of colloquial varieties with moderate-distance harmony may only harmonize immediately adjacent vowels in MSA.

==Vowels==
Modern Standard Arabic has six vowel phonemes forming three pairs of corresponding short and long vowels (). Many spoken varieties also include and . Modern Standard Arabic has two diphthongs (formed by a combination of short with the semivowels and ). Allophony in different dialects of Arabic can occur and is partially conditioned by neighboring consonants within the same word. The following are some general rules:
** retracted to in the environment of a neighboring , or an emphatic consonant (one that is uvularized, though customarily transcribed as if pharyngealized): , , , , , (in western Asian varieties the , ) and in a few regional standard pronunciations also and ;
** only in Iraq and the Persian Gulf: before a word boundary;
** advanced to in the environment of most consonants:
*** labial consonants (, and ),
*** plain (non-emphatic) coronal consonants with the exception of : namely , , , , , , , , and 
*** glottal consonants ( and )
*** , and ;
** Across North Africa and West Asia, the allophones and may be realized differently, either as , or both as ;
** In northwestern Africa, the open front vowel is raised to or .
** Across North Africa and West Asia, may be realized as before or adjacent to emphatic consonants and , , (exclusively west Asian , ). can also have different realizations, i.e. . Sometimes with one value for each vowel in both short and long lengths or two different values for each short and long lengths. They can be distinct phonemes in loanwords for a number of speakers.
** In Egypt, close vowels have different values; short initial or medial: ,  ← instead of . and completely become and respectively in some other particular dialects. Unstressed final long are most often shortened or reduced:  → ,  → ,  → .

However, the actual rules governing vowel-retraction are a good deal more complex and have relatively little in the way of an agreed-upon standard, as there are often competing notions of what constitutes a &quot;prestige&quot; form. Often, even highly proficient speakers will import the vowel-retraction rules from their native dialects. Thus, for example, in the Arabic of someone from Cairo, emphatic consonants will affect every vowel between word boundaries, whereas certain Saudi speakers exhibit emphasis only on the vowels adjacent to an emphatic consonant. Certain speakers (most notably Levantine speakers) exhibit a degree of asymmetry in leftward vs. rightward spread of vowel-retraction.



The final heavy syllable of a root is stressed.

The short vowels are all possible allophones of across different dialects; e.g., (&#x27;I said&#x27;) is pronounced or or , since the difference between the short mid vowels and is never phonemic, and they are mostly found in complementary distribution, except for a number of speakers where they can be phonemic but only in foreign words.

The short vowels are all possible allophones of across different dialects; e.g., (&#x27;from&#x27;) is pronounced or or since the difference between the short mid vowels and is never phonemic, and they are mostly found in complementary distribution, except for a number of speakers where they can be phonemic but only in foreign words.

The long mid vowels and appear to be phonemic in most varieties of Arabic except in general Maghrebi Arabic, where they merge with and . For example, لون (&#x27;color&#x27;) is generally pronounced in Mashriqi dialects but in most Maghrebi Arabic. The long mid vowels can be used in Modern Standard Arabic in dialectal words or in some stable loanwords or foreign names, as in (&#x27;Rome&#x27;) and (&#x27;cheque&#x27;).

Foreign words often have a liberal sprinkling of long vowels, as vowels tend to be written as long vowels in foreign loans, under the influence of European-language orthographies which write down every vowel with a letter. The long mid vowels and are always rendered with the letters and , respectively, accompanied by a preceding hamzah sitting above (أ) and below (إ) an alif (ا) respectively word-initially. In general, the pronunciation of loanwords is highly dependent on the speaker&#x27;s native variety.

==Consonants==
Even in the most formal contexts, pronunciation of Arabic depends on the speaker&#x27;s background, even if number and phonetic character of most of the 28 consonants has a broad degree of regularity among Arabic-speaking regions. Arabic is particularly rich in uvular, pharyngeal, and pharyngealized (&quot;emphatic&quot;) sounds. The emphatic coronals (, , , and ) cause assimilation of emphasis to adjacent non-emphatic coronal consonants. The standard pronunciation of ⟨ج⟩ varies regionally, most prominently in the Arabian Peninsula; this pronunciation is also found in Iraq, parts of the Levant, north-central Algeria, and parts of Egypt; it is also considered as the predominant pronunciation of Literary Arabic outside the Arab world and the pronunciation mostly used in Arabic loanwords across other languages (e.g. in Georgian, Malay, Persian, Turkish and Urdu). It is, however, pronounced in most of Northwest Africa and the Levant and in some parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Other pronunciations include , essentially in Egypt (, though it also appears as a dialectal pronunciation in parts of coastal Yemen and south coastal Oman), as well as in Sudan.

Note: the table and notes below discuss the phonology of Modern Standard Arabic among Arabic speakers and not regional dialects.

Long (geminate or double) consonants are pronounced exactly like short consonants, but last longer. In Arabic, they are called &quot;mushaddadah&quot; (&quot;strengthened&quot;, marked with a shaddah). Between a long consonant and a pause, an epenthetic occurs, but this is only common across regions in West Asia.

Mergers and mispronunciations 

Regional modern dialects may influence the way Modern Standard Arabic is spoken, which sometimes causes mergers or mispronunciations in consonants:

* Speakers that merge and to in their respective dialects usually mispronounce as when speaking Modern Standard Arabic instead of the standard .
* The voiced emphatic dental fricative is sometimes mispronounced as a voiced emphatic alveolar fricative depending on the speaker in Egypt, Sudan and Lebanon.
* Speakers that lack the interdentals and in their respective dialects, may merge them with and or and , respectively.
* Some speakers especially in Lebanon and Egypt might pronounce the standard uvular as a plain velar .
* A number of speakers in Yemen pronounce the uvular as a velar when speaking Modern Standard Arabic.

==Phonotactics==
Standard Arabic syllables come in only five forms:
* CV (light)
* CVV (heavy)
* CVC (heavy)
* CVVC (super-heavy)
* CVCC (super-heavy)

Standard Arabic syllable structure does not allow syllables to start with a vowel or with a consonant cluster. In cases where a word starts with a consonant cluster it is preceded by an epenthetic utterance initially or when preceded by a word that ends with a consonant; there are however exceptions like and that connect with a following word-initial consonant cluster with and respectively, if the preceding word ends with a long vowel that vowel is then shortened. 

Super-heavy syllables are usually not allowed except word finally, with the exception of CVV- before geminates creating non-final CVVC- syllables, these can be found in the active participles of geminate Form I verbs, like in (&#x27;substance, matter&#x27;), (&#x27;entirely&#x27;). In the pausal form, the final geminates behave as a single consonant, only when preceding another word or with vocalization, the geminates start appearing, belonging to two separate syllables. E.g.: (&#x27;poisonous&#x27;), (&#x27;dry&#x27;), (&#x27;public, general&#x27;), (&#x27;private, special&#x27;), and (&#x27;hot, spicy&#x27;).

Loanwords can break some phonotactic rules like allowing initial consonant clusters (with an initial epenthetic or often another repeated vowel from the word being optional inserted after the first consonant) like in &quot;Pluto&quot; and &quot;Prague&quot; or allowing CVVC syllables non-finally without geminates like in &quot;Russia&quot; and &quot;Syria&quot;, which can be modified to to fit the phonotactics better.

==Word stress==

The placement of word stress in Arabic varies considerably from one dialect to another, and has been the focus of extensive research and debate.

In determining stress, Arabic distinguishes three types of syllables:

* Light:
** An open syllable containing a short vowel (i.e. CV), such as 
* Heavy:
** An open syllable containing a long vowel (i.e. CVV), such as 
** A closed syllable containing a short vowel followed by one consonant (i.e. CVC), such as or 
* Super-heavy:
** A closed syllable containing a long vowel followed by one consonant (i.e. CVVC), such as or 
** A closed syllable containing a short vowel followed by two consonants (i.e. CVCC), such as , or a long vowel followed by a geminate consonant (i.e. CVVCiCi), such as 

The word stress of Classical Arabic has been the subject of debate. However, there is consensus as to the general rule, even though there are some exceptions. A simple rule of thumb is that word-stress falls on the penultimate syllable of a word if that syllable is closed, and otherwise on the antepenultimate.

A more precise description is J. C. E. Watson&#x27;s. Here the stressed syllable follows the marker &#x27; and variant rules are in brackets:
# Stress a pre-pausal superheavy (CVVC, CVVCC, or CVCC) syllable: , , .
# Otherwise, stress the rightmost non-final heavy (CVV or CVC) syllable: , , , , .
# Otherwise, stress the antepenult (or leftmost syllable if there is no antepenult): .

Modern Arabic dialects all maintain rules (1) and (2). But if there is neither a final superheavy syllable nor a heavy penultimate syllable, their behaviour varies. Thus in Palestinian, rule (3) is instead &#x27;otherwise stress the first syllable (up to the antepenult): , , whereas the basic rules of Cairene (to which there are exceptions) are:

# Stress a superheavy ultima.
# Otherwise, stress a heavy penult.
# Otherwise, stress the penult or antepenult, whichever is separated by an even number of syllables from the rightmost non-final heavy syllable, or, if there is no non-final heavy syllable, from the left boundary of the word.

==Local variations of Modern Standard Arabic==

Spoken varieties differ from Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic not only in grammar but also in pronunciation. Outside of the Arabian peninsula, a major linguistic division is between &quot;sedentary&quot;, largely urban, varieties and rural varieties. Inside the Arabian peninsula and in Iraq, the two types are less distinct; but the language of the urbanized Hejaz, at least, strongly looks like a conservative sedentary variety.

Some examples of variation:

; Consonants
The standard pronunciation of ⟨ج⟩ in MSA varies regionally, most prominently in the Arabian Peninsula, parts of the Levant, Iraq, north-central Algeria, and parts of Egypt, it is also considered as the predominant pronunciation of Literary Arabic outside the Arab world and the pronunciation mostly used in Arabic loanwords across other languages (e.g. in Georgian, Malay, Persian, Turkish and Urdu), and in most of Northwest Africa, most of the Levant, some parts of the Arabian Peninsula, other pronunciations include only in Egypt ( appears as a dialectal pronunciation in coastal Yemen, and south coastal Oman but not as a standard pronunciation in MSA), as well as in Sudan.

In Modern Standard Arabic (not in Egypt&#x27;s use), is used as a marginal phoneme to pronounce some dialectal and loan words. On the other hand, it is considered a native phoneme or allophone in most modern Arabic dialects, mostly as a variant of (as in Arabian Peninsula and Northwest African dialects) or as a variant of (as in Egyptian and a number of Yemeni and Omani dialects). It is also considered a separate foreign phoneme that appears only in loanwords, as in most urban Levantine dialects where is and is .

The dental was historically , a value it retains among older speakers in a few isolated dialects.

The foreign phonemes , , , etc. are not necessarily pronounced by all Arabic speakers, but they can be pronounced by some speakers especially in foreign proper nouns and loanwords. and are usually transcribed with their own letters and but as these letters are not part of Standard Arabic, and they are simply written with and , e.g. The use of both sounds may be considered marginal and Arabs may pronounce the words interchangeably; both and , or &quot;November&quot;, both and &quot;caprice&quot; can be used. 

 is another possible loanword phoneme, as in the word or (&quot;sandawitš&quot; or &quot;sāndwitš&quot; &#x27;sandwich&#x27;), though a number of varieties instead break up the and sounds with an epenthetic vowel. Egyptian Arabic treats as two consonants () and inserts , as [C] or [C], when it occurs before or after another consonant. is found as normal in Iraqi Arabic and Gulf Arabic. Normally the combination (&quot;tā’-shīn&quot;) is used to transliterate the , while in rural Levantine dialects /k/ is usually substituted with while speaking and would be written as ك. Otherwise Arabic usually substitutes other letters in the transliteration of names and loanwords like the Persian character which is used for writing .

Other Variations include:
* Split of original into two phonemes, distinguished primarily by how they affect neighboring vowels. This has progressed the farthest in North Africa. See Moroccan Arabic, Algerian Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and Libyan Arabic.
; Vowels

* Development of highly distinctive allophones of and , with highly fronted , or in non-emphatic contexts, and retracted in emphatic contexts. The more extreme distinctions are characteristic of sedentary varieties, while Bedouin and conservative Arabian-peninsula varieties have much closer allophones. In some of the sedentary varieties, the allophones are gradually splitting into new phonemes under the influence of loanwords, where the allophone closest in sound to the source-language vowel often appears regardless of the presence or absence of nearby emphatic consonants.
* Spread of &quot;emphasis&quot;, visible in the backing of phonemic . In conservative varieties of the Arabic peninsula, only adjacent to emphatic consonants is affected, while in Cairo, an emphatic consonant anywhere in a word tends to trigger emphatic allophones throughout the entire word. Dialects of the Levant are somewhere in between. Moroccan Arabic is unusual in that and have clear emphatic allophones as well (typically lowered, e.g. to and ).
* Monophthongization of diphthongs such as and to and , respectively ( and in parts of the Maghrib, such as in Moroccan Arabic). Mid vowels may also be present in loanwords such as ( Melbourne), ( &#x27;(male) secretary&#x27;) and ( &#x27;doctor&#x27;).
* Raising of word final to . In some parts of Levant, also word-medial to . See Lebanese Arabic.
* Loss of final short vowels (with sometimes remaining), and shortening of final long vowels. This triggered the loss of most Classical Arabic case and mood distinctions.
* Change of nisba suffix &#x27; &gt; &#x27;, the nisba suffix &#x27; as ( &#x27;(male) Arabic&#x27;) is usually mispronounced &#x27; by many speakers.
* Shorten of final long &#x27; &gt; &#x27; ( &#x27;my love&#x27;) is usually pronounced with a short final &quot;&quot; by many speakers.
* Collapse and deletion of short vowels. In many varieties, such as North Mesopotamian, many Levantine dialects, many Bedouin dialects of the Maghrib, and Mauritanian, short and have collapsed to schwa and exhibit very little distinction so that such dialects have two short vowels, and . Many Levantine dialects show partial collapse of and , which appear as such only in the next-to-last phoneme of a word (i.e. followed by a single word-final consonant), and merge to elsewhere. A number of dialects that still allow three short vowels in all positions, such as Egyptian Arabic, nevertheless show little functional contrast between and as a result of past sound changes converting one sound into the other. Arabic varieties everywhere have a tendency to delete short vowels (especially other than ) in many phonological contexts. When combined with the operation of inflectional morphology, disallowed consonant clusters often result, which are broken up by epenthetic short vowels, automatically inserted by phonological rules. In these respects (as in many others), Moroccan Arabic has the most extreme changes, with all three short vowels , , collapsing to a schwa , which is then deleted in nearly all contexts. This variety, in fact, has essentially lost the quantitative distinction between short and long vowels in favor of a new qualitative distinction between unstable &quot;reduced&quot; vowels (especially ) and stable, half-long &quot;full&quot; vowels , , (the reflexes of original long vowels). Classical Arabic words borrowed into Moroccan Arabic are pronounced entirely with &quot;full&quot; vowels regardless of the length of the original vowel.

==Phonologies of different Arabic dialects==
The main dialectal variations in Arabic consonants revolve around the six consonants; , , , , and :

* The grayed pronunciations are considered standard in some countries.

===Cairene===

The Arabic of Cairo (often called &quot;Egyptian Arabic&quot; or more correctly &quot;Cairene Arabic&quot;) is a typical sedentary variety and a de facto standard variety among certain segments of the Arabic-speaking population, due to the dominance of Egyptian media. Watson adds emphatic labials and and emphatic to Cairene Arabic with marginal phonemic status. Cairene has also merged the interdental consonants with the dental plosives (e.g., → ) except in loanwords from Classical Arabic where they are nativized as sibilant fricatives (e.g., → , ). Cairene speakers pronounce as and debuccalized to (again, loanwords from Classical Arabic have reintroduced the earlier sound or approximated to with the front vowel around it changed to the back vowel ). Classical Arabic diphthongs and became realized as and respectively. Still, Egyptian Arabic sometimes has minimal pairs like vs. . + → collapsing with which means ( or ), because Cairene phonology cannot have long vowels before two consonants. Cairene also has as a marginal phoneme from loanwords from languages other than Classical Arabic.

===Sanaa===

Varieties such as that of Sanaa, Yemen, are more conservative and retain most phonemic contrasts of Classical Arabic. Sanaani possesses as a reflex of Classical (which still functions as an emphatic consonant). In unstressed syllables, Sanaani short vowels may be reduced to . is voiced to in initial and intervocalic positions.

==Distribution==
The most frequent consonant phoneme is , the rarest is . The frequency distribution of the 28 consonant phonemes, based on the 2,967 triliteral roots listed by Wehr is (with the percentage of roots in which each phoneme occurs):

This distribution does not necessarily reflect the actual frequency of occurrence of the phonemes in speech, since pronouns, prepositions and suffixes are not taken into account, and the roots themselves will occur with varying frequency. In particular, occurs in several extremely common affixes (occurring in the marker for second-person or feminine third-person as a prefix, the marker for first-person or feminine third-person as a suffix, and as the second element of Forms VIII and X as an infix) despite being fifth from last on Wehr&#x27;s list. The list does give, however, an idea of which phonemes are more marginal than others. Note that the five least frequent letters are among the six letters added to those inherited from the Phoenician alphabet, namely, , , , , and .

==Sample==
The Literary Arabic sample text is a reading of The North Wind and the Sun by a speaker who was born in Safed, lived and was educated in Beirut from age 8 to 15, subsequently studied and taught in Damascus, studied phonetics in Scotland and since then has resided in Scotland and Kuwait.

===English Translation===
The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.

<text>The United States Department of the Army (DA) is one of the three military departments within the Department of Defense of the U.S. The Department of the Army is the federal government agency within which the United States Army (U.S.) is organized, and it is led by the secretary of the Army, who has statutory authority under 10 United States Code § 7013 to conduct its affairs and to prescribe regulations for its government, subject to the limits of the law, and the directions of the secretary of defense and the president.

The secretary of the army is a civilian official appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The highest-ranking military officer in the department is the chief of staff of the Army, who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Other senior officials of the department are the under secretary of the Army (principal deputy to the secretary) and the vice chief of staff of the Army (principal deputy to the chief of staff.)

The &quot;Department of War&quot; was originally formed in 1789 as an Executive Department of the United States and was split by the National Security Act of 1947 into the Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force on September 18, 1947. By amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 in 1949, the department of the Army was transformed to its present-day status.

==Organizational structure==
The Department of the Army is a Military Department within the United States Department of Defense. The department is headed by the secretary of the army, who by statute must be a civilian, appointed by the president with the confirmation by the United States Senate. The secretary of the Army is responsible for and has the authority to conduct all the affairs of the Department of the Army, subject to the authority, direction and control of the secretary of defense. The Department of the Army is divided between its headquarters at the seat of government and the field organizations of the Army.

By direction of the secretary of defense, the secretary of the Army assigns Army forces, apart from those units performing duties enumerated in 10 United States Code § 7013 (i.e., organize, train &amp; equip) or unless otherwise directed to the operational command of the commanders of the Combatant Commands. Only the secretary of defense (and the president) has the authority to approve transfer of forces to and from Combatant Commands by 10 United States Code § 162.

===Headquarters, Department of the Army===

&quot;Headquarters, Department of the Army&quot; is the corporate office of the department which exercises directive and supervisory functions and consists of two separate staffs: the &quot;Office of the Secretary of the Army&quot; (10 United States Code § 7014), the mainly civilian staff; and the &quot;Army Staff&quot; (10 United States Code § 7031, &amp; 10 United States Code § 7032), the mainly military staff. The Office of the Secretary and the Army Staff are organized along similar lines, with civilians and military officers both overseeing similar program areas.


====Office of the Secretary====
The Office of the Secretary is led by the secretary of the Army, assisted by the under secretary of the Army and the administrative assistant to the secretary of the Army, who is the senior civilian career official of the department. The Office of the Secretary of the Army, also known as the &quot;Army Secretariat&quot;, is divided into multiple branches with functional responsibilities, the six most important of which are headed by one of the five assistant secretaries of the Army or the general counsel of the Army, each of whom are civilians appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

====The Army Staff====

The Army Staff is led by the chief of staff of the Army, a four-star general who is the highest-ranking officer in the Army and the Army member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The chief of staff is assisted in managing the Army Staff by the vice chief of staff of the United States Army, a four-star general and second highest-ranking officer in the Army. The Army Staff is divided into several directorates, each headed by a three-star general; a deputy chief of staff (DCS G–1 (personnel), G–2 (intelligence), G–3 (operations), G–4 (logistics), G-5 (planning), G-6 (network), G-7 (training), G-8 (finance), and G-9 (installations) respectively). The DCS G-3/5/7 is a single office for operations, plans, and training.

A key official within the Army Staff is the director of the Army Staff, who is a three-star general. The director is responsible for integrating and synchronizing the work of the Office of the Secretary and the Army Staff so that they meet the goals and priorities of the secretary of the Army. Other key figures within the Army Staff are the sergeant major of the Army, the Army Staff Senior Warrant Officer, the Chief Warrant Officer of the Army, the United States Army judge advocate general, the chief of the Army Reserve, the United States Army provost marshal general, and the United States Army surgeon general. The chief of the National Guard Bureau was previously considered part of the Army Staff, but has been elevated to four-star rank and membership in the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the director of the Army National Guard and the director of the Air National Guard (both three-star positions) report to the chief, National Guard Bureau for strategy and policy, but receive funding and Service-specific guidance from their respective services, as they have different legal authorities.

<text>The 1935 Canadian federal election was held on October 14, 1935, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 18th Parliament of Canada. The Liberal Party of William Lyon Mackenzie King won a majority government, defeating Prime Minister R. B. Bennett&#x27;s Conservatives.

The central issue was the economy, which was still in the depths of the Great Depression. In office since the 1930 election, Bennett had sought to stimulate the economy during his first few years through a policy of high tariffs and trade within the British Empire. In the last months of his time in office, he reversed his position, copying the popular New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt in the United States. Upset about high unemployment and inaction by the federal government, voters were unwilling to allow the Conservatives to continue to govern, despite their change of policy.

The Conservatives were also suffering severe internal divisions. During his first years in office, Bennett had alienated those in his party who supported intervention in the economy. His last minute conversion to interventionism alienated the rest of the party. Former cabinet minister H.H. Stevens left to form the Reconstruction Party. Senior minister Sir Joseph Flavelle announced he would be supporting the Liberals.

Voters opted for Mackenzie King&#x27;s promise of mild reforms to restore economic health. The Liberals crushed the Tories, winning 173 seats to the Conservatives&#x27; 39, the worst ever performance by the Tories until their collapse in 1993. The Liberal Party would continue to hold power until 1957.

The 1935 election was also important in it saw the final demise of the Progressive Party and the United Farmers of Alberta. The Progressive Party, having been in gradual decline over the previous decade, did not run any candidates under its own banner. The federal party, always highly decentralized, ceased to exist sometime circa 1940. However, Liberal-Progressive Premier of Manitoba John Bracken brought the name back into formal use when he moved to federal politics in 1942; his first act as leader of the Conservatives was to rechristen them the Progressive Conservative Party.

The United Farmers of Alberta, whose credibility was ruined by a sex scandal involving former leader John E. Brownlee, lost all their seats in the provincial election earlier that year, and subsequently withdrew from electoral politics, likewise fielding no candidates in this federal election.

Two new movements rose out of the west, however. The new Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, a social democratic party, first competed in this election and won seven seats, promising social reform. The Social Credit Party of Canada was even more successful, capturing seventeen seats on its platform of monetary reform despite winning less of the popular vote than the former. Fifteen of these seats were in Alberta, where the party dominated after having swept to power in a landslide less than two months before the federal vote. John Horne Blackmore was chosen to lead the Social Credit caucus after the election. The de facto leader of the national movement was Alberta Premier William Aberhart, who did not stand in the federal election himself.

<text>The , , was the military police of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA). The organization also shared civilian secret police that specialized clandestine and covert operation, counterinsurgency, counterintelligence, HUMINT, interrogate suspects who may be allied soldiers, spies or resistance movement, maintain security of prisoner of war camps, raiding to capture high-value targets, and providing security at important government and military locations at risk of being sabotaged roles within Japan and its occupied territories, and was notorious for its brutality and role in suppressing dissent. The broad duties of the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; included maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers. In occupied areas, it also issued travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment. At its peak at the end of World War II, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; had about 35,000 personnel.

Founded in 1881 during the Meiji era, the size and duties of the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; grew rapidly as Japanese militarism expanded. During World War II, the organization ran Japan&#x27;s prisoner of war and civilian internment camps, known for their mistreatment of detainees, and also acted as a political police force in the military and occupied territories. It carried out torture, summary executions, and violent reprisals and massacres against civilians, as well as procuring comfort women and human test subjects for Unit 731. The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; was disbanded after the war, and many of its leaders were tried and convicted of war crimes. 

While institutionally part of the Army, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; also discharged limited military police functions for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). A member of the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; corps was called a &quot;kempei&quot; .

The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; was based on the France National Gendarmerie.

== History ==
The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; was established on 4 January 1881, during the Meiji era, by order of the Great Council of State as part of a broader modernization and Westernization of the Japanese military. Initially, the organization was an elite corps of 349 men, and was tasked with the narrow role of enforcing the new army conscription legislation. Under laws passed in 1898 and 1928, the organization functioned in a General Affairs Section and a Service Section; the former took up the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; policy, personnel, discipline, and records functions, as well as political policing within the IJA and IJN parallel to the civilian Special Higher Police (&quot;Tokkō&quot;), while the latter was responsible for supply, organization, and training; public security; and counterintelligence. The Navy, seeking to limit Army influence, also maintained its own military police corps, known as the &quot;Tokkeitai&quot;.

Following the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), the Empire of Japan effectively controlled the Korean Peninsula, which was formally annexed into the empire as Chōsen in 1910. The Korean &quot;Kempeitai&quot; developed into a unique gendarmerie organization known as the &quot;Kempei keisatsu&quot;, which operated from 1,642 police stations and recruited large numbers of Korean nationals. The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; was instrumental in suppressing Korean opinion and political participation, and played a major role in recruiting comfort women and in conscripting guards for prisoner of war camps. It carried out the empire&#x27;s policies of suppressing Korean national identity, language, customs, and culture; it also promoted Japanese organizations and spread pro-Japan propaganda through Korea&#x27;s daily newspapers.

In 1931–1932, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria and established the puppet state of Manchukuo. It became a major zone of operations for the &quot;Kempeitai&quot;, with 18,000 personnel in the area by 1932. Many of Japan&#x27;s wartime leaders built their reputations and careers as officers in the Manchurian &quot;Kempeitai&quot;, including Lieutenant General , commander of the Manchukuo &quot;Kempeitai&quot; (1932–1934) and later Vice Minister of War; General Shizuichi Tanaka, commander of the Kwantung Army&#x27;s &quot;Kempeitai&quot; (1937–1938) and later commander of Tokyo &quot;Kempeitai&quot; (1938–1940) and Eastern District Army; and notoriously General Hideki Tojo, commander of the Kwantung Army &quot;Kempeitai&quot; (1935–1937) and later Minister of War, Prime Minister, and Chief of the General Staff.

As further foreign territories fell under Japanese military occupation during the 1930s and the early 1940s, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; recruited large numbers of locals in those territories. Taiwanese and Koreans were extensively used as auxiliaries to guard POWs and police the newly occupied areas in Southeast Asia, and the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; also carried out recruitment activities among the populations of French Indochina, Malaya, and other territories.

The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; also operated on the Japanese home islands, where it was responsible for maintaining public order as a secret police, alongside the civilian Special Higher Police (in the 1920s there were mentions of a joint &quot;Tokkō–Kempeitai&quot; organization). The two organizations served as public censors and overseers of private morals and thought. All prisoners were presumed guilty on arrest; examinations of suspects took place in secret, and the use of torture to extract confessions of guilt was commonplace. While its suspects were nominally subject to civilian judicial proceedings, they were often denied &quot;habeas corpus&quot; (the right to have one&#x27;s case tried before a court). The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; had close ties with the &quot;Tokumu Kikan&quot; military intelligence agency, which reported directly to the Imperial General Headquarters; the organizations jointly carried out clandestine and covert operation, counterinsurgency, counterintelligence, espionage, fifth-column, HUMINT, internal security, propaganda, and public security activities. After Tojo was appointed as Vice Minister of War in 1938 and the National Diet passed an anti-espionage act in 1939 which expanded its power, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; became even more visible and active in Japan.

From 1933 to 1941, the Soviet Union operated a spy ring in Tokyo led by Richard Sorge and Hotsumi Ozaki, which gathered intelligence on Japanese intentions in the Far East. By 1940 both the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; and &quot;Tokkō&quot; suspected an espionage ring operating in Japan, though neither organization shared information with the other. The Germans began suspecting Sorge, who was posing as a journalist sympathetic to Nazism, was a Soviet agent and in mid-1940 informed the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; that Sorge was under surveillance. The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; and &quot;Tokkō&quot; investigated and concluded that Sorge was a Soviet spy, and also came to suspect Ozaki, who was arrested on 15 October 1941. Information from his interrogation by the &quot;Tokkō&quot; implicated Sorge, who was arrested on 18 October. Both men were tried, and executed by hanging on 7 November 1944. 

The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; was disbanded after Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945, upon which its officers were ordered to disperse and vanish. Nonetheless, many of its former commanders were convicted of war crimes. The post-war Self-Defense Forces military police corps, the &quot;Keimutai&quot;, has no jurisdiction over civilians.

== Organization and strength ==

The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; formed a branch of the IJA through its Administration Bureau, which was led by a provost marshal general who was answerable to the Minister of War. In Japan during peacetime, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; was answerable to the Ministry of War for regular military duties, the Home Ministry for civil police duties, and Ministry of Justice for law administration duties. In war zones, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; came under the control of that area&#x27;s military commander.

The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; was made up of field officers (&quot;sakan&quot;), non-commissioned officers (&quot;kashikan&quot;) and superior privates (&quot;jotohei&quot;). When needed, first- and second- class privates were attached from other services. A &quot;Kempeitai&quot; headquarters was established under each army of the IJA, and commanded by a major general or colonel. Each headquarters controlled two to three field offices, each commanded by a lieutenant colonel, 22 field officers (&quot;sakan&quot;), and 352 other ranks. Each field office was divided into sections (&quot;buntai&quot;) commanded by a captain or lieutenant and 65 other ranks, in turn divided into detachments (&quot;bunkentai&quot;) commanded by a second lieutenant or warrant officer and 20 other ranks. Each detachment had sections for police (&quot;keimu han&quot;), administration (&quot;naikin han&quot;), and special duties (&quot;tokumu han&quot;). &quot;Yasen Kempeitai&quot; operated in forward areas as field units. Volunteer ethnic &quot;Kempeitai&quot; auxiliaries, established under laws in 1919 and 1937, were allowed a highest rank of sergeant major.

&quot;Kempeitai&quot; officers were usually graduates of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy or Army War College. In peacetime, officers typically had one year of training, while non-commissioned officers were trained for six months. In 1937, Western sources estimated there were 315 &quot;Kempeitai&quot; officers and 6,000 personnel of other ranks; in 1942, the U.S. Army estimated there were 601 &quot;Kempeitai&quot; officers in its &quot;Handbook on Japanese Military Forces&quot;. Japanese records show a peak of 34,834 &quot;Kempeitai&quot; officers and personnel during the war: 10,679 in Japan, 6,115 in central China, 4,946 in the Kwantung Army, 4,253 in north China, 1,927 in Korea, 1,094 in south China, 937 in Thailand, 829 in the Philippines, 758 in Malaya, 745 in Formosa, 540 in Burma, 538 in Java, 479 in occupied French Indochina, 387 in Sumatra, 362 in Singapore, 156 in Borneo, and 89 in the South Seas. Included within these numbers were Taiwanese, Malays, Chinese, Cambodians, and Vietnamese. In Indo-China the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; particularly recruited from members of the Cao Dai religious sect.

== Activities and war crimes ==

In Japan, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; often assisted local civilian law authorities (though it was not a gendarmerie), and targeted students, farmers, socialists, communists, pacifists, foreign workers, and any showing irreverence for the emperor. In occupied territories and war zones, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; was responsible for issuing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting members of resistances, requisitioning food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressing anti-Japanese sentiment. The organization was notorious for its brutality in suppressing dissent, and was responsible for widespread abuses, including forced labor, torture, and executions. Torture methods were taught at &quot;Kempeitai&quot; schools, and included flogging, waterboarding, burning and scalding, administration of electric shocks, knee joint separation, suspension from ropes, kneeling on sharp edges, fingernail and toenail removal, and digit fracturing. 

The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; also ran Japan&#x27;s network of prisoner of war (POW) and civilian internment camps, which treated detainees in violation of the Geneva Convention of 1929 (not ratified by Japan). A total of 350,000 prisoners were taken and housed in 176 camps in Japan and about 500 in occupied territories. The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; pressed many POWs and civilians into slave labour gangs for war work, and subjected them to torture, including standing inside small cages set on top of red ant nests and lashing to trees with barbed wire. Prisoners were forced to sign non-escape oaths, and those who escaped and were recaptured were subjected to beatings and torture as examples in front of other prisoners. 27 percent of Allied POWs taken by Japan during the war died in captivity. Camp guards, often Korean and Formosan, were also abused by &quot;Kempeitai&quot; superiors. 

After the Doolittle Raid in April 1942, captured Allied airmen were accused of intentionally attacking civilians so were treated as war criminals rather than POWs, and were thus made subject to the death penalty. The U.S. airmen captured in China after the raid were subjected to harsh treatment and interrogation by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot;; three were sentenced to death and executed in October 1942, while five others had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. They were subjected to mental torture in the form of mock executions. Every airman captured in occupied territory after the raid was starved, interrogated, and tortured by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot;; by May 1945, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; decided that formal trials were a waste of time, and executed airmen (often by beheading) soon after their courts-martial had been approved. In December 1944, three U.S. airmen were arrested by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; at Hangzhou; they were paraded through the streets, ridiculed, beaten, and tortured before being doused with petrol and burned alive. In February 1945, six British airmen were captured in southern Burma and interrogated by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; before being lined up on the edge of a trench, blindfolded, and beheaded by a &quot;Kempeitai&quot; officer; their bodies were used for bayonet practice. In May 1945, a U.S. aviator shot down and injured near Saigon in French Indochina was left untreated for three days before being interrogated by &quot;Kempeitai&quot;, then killed with procaine. In July 1945, 15 U.S. airmen were captured and interrogated by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; near Hiroshima; 12 died in the U.S. atomic bombing of the city on August 6, of which two were possibly clubbed to death at Hiroshima Castle by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot;, and two were possibly stoned to death by civilians.

The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; organized regular and violent reprisals against populations in Japan&#x27;s occupied territories. After the Doolittle Raid, it carried out reprisals against thousands of Chinese civilians accused of helping U.S. airmen. In 1942, it carried out the Sook Ching, a mass killing in Singapore after it fell to the Japanese, and in October 1943, in the Double Tenth incident, arrested and tortured 57 people in response to an Allied raid on Singapore Harbour; 15 of them died in custody. In 1943–1944, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; arrested 1,918 persons on Java, of whom 743 died while in custody (439 of whom were executed). In March 1944, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; brutally suppressed a riot in Tasikmalaya in western Java, killing several hundred Muslims; Muslim leader Zainal Mustafa and 23 of his disciples were later executed. In September 1944, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; executed the Rajah of Loeang and 95 natives from the Loeang and Sermata Islands for failing to turn over guerrillas who had allegedly assassinated several officers. On 7 July 1945, the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; killed 600 inhabitants of the village of Kalagon in the Moulmein region of southeast Burma in the Kalagon massacre as reprisal for local guerrilla attacks after interrogation, beatings, and the rape of women and children did not elicit information.

The Chinese &quot;Kempeitai&quot; was responsible for providing human test subjects, codenamed &quot;maruta&quot; (&#x27;logs&#x27;), for the Army&#x27;s biological warfare research program under Unit 731 near Harbin, Manchuria. Thousands of uncooperative prisoners and civilians were transported in windowless prison cars to the unit&#x27;s facility under the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; Human Materials Procurement Arm and were subjected to medical experimentation, including vivisection, artificially-induced illness, frostbite, and simulated combat wounds. More experiments, also facilitated by the &quot;Kempeitai,&quot; were conducted on Allied POWs in the southeast Pacific. In February 1944, an outbreak of tetanus among hundreds of laborers in Java, possibly tied to the biological warfare program, was traced to contaminated vaccines. The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; accused Achmad Muchtar of the Eykman Institute in Jakarta, who treated many of the victims, of deliberately contaminating the vaccines to sabotage labor for the Japanese, and imprisoned him for nine months before beheading him and running over his body with a steamroller.

The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; also organized extensive criminal networks, which extorted vast amounts of money from businesses and civilians in areas where they operated; the forced prostitution system for the Imperial Army, whose victims were known as comfort women; and the all-female Tokyo Rose radio propaganda broadcasts.

== Active units ==
The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; operated commands on the Japanese mainland and throughout all occupied and captured overseas territories during the Pacific War. The external units operating outside Japan were:
* First Field Kempeitai – commanded by Major-General Kōichi Ōno from August 1941 to 23 January 1942 and probably based in China with the Japanese Kwantung Army
* Second Field Kempeitai – attached to the 25th Army and based in Singapore from 1942, the unit was under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Oishi Masayuki. In January 1944, Malaya came under the responsibility of Third Field Kempeitai Major-General Masanori Kojima.
* Third Field Kempeitai – drawn from a Manchurian Kenpei Training Regiment in July 1941, attached to the 16th Army and based in Java and Sumatra from 1942. The unit headquarters were in Batavia under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Kuzumi Kenzaburo. By war&#x27;s end, the unit had 772 members.
* Fourth Field Kempeitai
* Fifth Field Kempeitai
* Sixth Field Kempeitai – attached to the 8th Area Army based at Rabaul, Papua New Guinea
* Seventh Field Kempeitai
* Eighth Field Kempeitai – attached to the 2nd Army on Halmahera, Indonesia
* Ninth Field Kempeitai
* Tenth Field Kempeitai
* Eleventh Field Kempeitai – commanded by Colonel Shōshichi Kamisago from November 1941 to August 1942, when he became head of the 1st Army Kempeitai Southern Section

== Uniform ==
&quot;Kempeitai&quot; personnel wore either the standard M1938 field uniform or the cavalry uniform with high black leather boots. Civilian clothes were also authorized with rank badges or the Japanese Imperial chrysanthemum worn under the jacket lapel. Uniformed personnel also wore a black chevron on their uniforms and a white armband on the left arm with the characters &quot;ken&quot; and &quot;hei&quot; , together read as &quot;kempei&quot; or &quot;kenpei,&quot; which transliterates to &quot;military police&quot;. 

Until 1942, a full dress uniform comprising a red kepi, gold and red waist sash, dark blue tunic and trousers with black facings was authorized for &quot;Kempeitai&quot; officers on ceremonial occasions. Rank insignia comprised gold Austrian knots and epaulettes. &quot;Kempeitai&quot; officers were armed with a cavalry sabre and pistol, while enlisted men had a pistol and bayonet. Junior NCOs carried a &quot;shinai&quot; , especially when dealing with prisoners.

<text>Computer cooling is required to remove the waste heat produced by computer components, to keep components within permissible operating temperature limits. Components that are susceptible to temporary malfunction or permanent failure if overheated include integrated circuits such as central processing units (CPUs), chipsets, graphics cards, hard disk drives, and solid state drives.

Components are often designed to generate as little heat as possible, and computers and operating systems may be designed to reduce power consumption and consequent heating according to workload, but more heat may still be produced than can be removed without attention to cooling. Use of heatsinks cooled by airflow reduces the temperature rise produced by a given amount of heat. Attention to patterns of airflow can prevent the development of hotspots. Computer fans are widely used along with heatsink fans to reduce temperature by actively exhausting hot air. There are also other cooling techniques, such as liquid cooling. All modern day processors are designed to cut out or reduce their voltage or clock speed if the internal temperature of the processor exceeds a specified limit. This is generally known as Thermal Throttling in the case of reduction of clock speeds, or Thermal Shutdown in the case of a complete shutdown of the device or system.

Cooling may be designed to reduce the ambient temperature within the case of a computer, such as by exhausting hot air, or to cool a single component or small area (spot cooling). Components commonly individually cooled include the CPU, graphics processing unit (GPU) and the northbridge.
==Generators of unwanted heat==
Integrated circuits (e.g. CPU and GPU) are the main generators of heat in modern computers. Heat generation can be reduced by efficient design and selection of operating parameters such as voltage and frequency, but ultimately, acceptable performance can often only be achieved by managing significant heat generation.

In operation, the temperature of a computer&#x27;s components will rise until the heat transferred to the surroundings is equal to the heat produced by the component, that is, when thermal equilibrium is reached. For reliable operation, the temperature must never exceed a specified maximum permissible value unique to each component. For semiconductors, instantaneous junction temperature, rather than component case, heatsink, or ambient temperature is critical.

Cooling can be impaired by:
* Dust acting as a thermal insulator and impeding airflow, thereby reducing heatsink and fan performance.
* Poor airflow including turbulence due to friction against impeding components such as ribbon cables, or incorrect orientation of fans, can reduce the amount of air flowing through a case and even create localized whirlpools of hot air in the case. In some cases of equipment with bad thermal design, cooling air can easily flow out through &quot;cooling&quot; holes before passing over hot components; cooling in such cases can often be improved by blocking of selected holes.
* Poor heat transfer due to poor thermal contact between components to be cooled and cooling devices. This can be improved by the use of thermal compounds to even out surface imperfections, or even by lapping.

==Damage prevention==
Because high temperatures can significantly reduce life span or cause permanent damage to components, and the heat output of components can sometimes exceed the computer&#x27;s cooling capacity, manufacturers often take additional precautions to ensure that temperatures remain within safe limits. A computer with thermal sensors integrated in the CPU, motherboard, chipset, or GPU can shut itself down when high temperatures are detected to prevent permanent damage, although this may not completely guarantee long-term safe operation. Before an overheating component reaches this point, it may be &quot;throttled&quot; until temperatures fall below a safe point using dynamic frequency scaling technology. Throttling reduces the operating frequency and voltage of an integrated circuit or disables non-essential features of the chip to reduce heat output, often at the cost of slightly or significantly reduced performance. For desktop and notebook computers, throttling is often controlled at the BIOS level. Throttling is also commonly used to manage temperatures in smartphones and tablets, where components are packed tightly together with little to no active cooling, and with additional heat transferred from the hand of the user.

The user can also perform several tasks in order to preemptively prevent damage from happening. They can perform a visual inspection of the cooler and case fans. If any of them are not spinning correctly, it is likely that they will need to be replaced. The user should also clean the fans thoroughly, since dust and debris can increase the ambient case temperature and impact fan performance. The best way to do so is with compressed air in an open space. Another preemptive technique to prevent damage is to replace the thermal paste regularly. 

==Mainframes and supercomputers==
As electronic computers became larger and more complex, cooling of the active components became a critical factor for reliable operation. Early vacuum-tube computers, with relatively large cabinets, could rely on natural or forced air circulation for cooling. However, solid-state devices were packed much more densely and had lower allowable operating temperatures.

Starting in 1965, IBM and other manufacturers of mainframe computers sponsored intensive research into the physics of cooling densely packed integrated circuits. Many air and liquid cooling systems were devised and investigated, using methods such as natural and forced convection, direct air impingement, direct liquid immersion and forced convection, pool boiling, falling films, flow boiling, and liquid jet impingement. Mathematical analysis was used to predict temperature rises of components for each possible cooling system geometry.

IBM developed three generations of the Thermal Conduction Module (TCM) which used a water-cooled cold plate in direct thermal contact with integrated circuit packages. Each package had a thermally conductive pin pressed onto it, and helium gas surrounded chips and heat-conducting pins. The design could remove up to 27 watts from a chip and up to 2000 watts per module, while maintaining chip package temperatures of around . Systems using TCMs were the 3081 family (1980), ES/3090 (1984) and some models of the ES/9000 (1990). In the IBM 3081 processor, TCMs allowed up to 2700 watts on a single printed circuit board while maintaining chip temperature at . Thermal conduction modules using water cooling were also used in mainframe systems manufactured by other companies including Mitsubishi and Fujitsu.

The Cray-1 supercomputer designed in 1976 had a distinctive cooling system. The machine was only in height and in diameter, and consumed up to 115 kilowatts; this is comparable to the average power consumption of a few dozen Western homes or a medium-sized car. The integrated circuits used in the machine were the fastest available at the time, using emitter-coupled logic; however, the speed was accompanied by high power consumption compared to later CMOS devices.

Heat removal was critical. Refrigerant was circulated through piping embedded in vertical cooling bars in twelve columnar sections of the machine. Each of the 1662 printed circuit modules of the machine had a copper core and was clamped to the cooling bar. The system was designed to maintain the cases of integrated circuits at no more than , with refrigerant circulating at . Final heat rejection was through a water-cooled condenser. Piping, heat exchangers, and pumps for the cooling system were arranged in an upholstered bench seat around the outside of the base of the computer. About 20 percent of the machine&#x27;s weight in operation was refrigerant.

In the later Cray-2, with its more densely packed modules, Seymour Cray had trouble effectively cooling the machine using the metal conduction technique with mechanical refrigeration, so he switched to &#x27;liquid immersion&#x27; cooling. This method involved filling the chassis of the Cray-2 with a liquid called Fluorinert. Fluorinert, as its name implies, is an inert liquid that does not interfere with the operation of electronic components. As the components came to operating temperature, the heat would dissipate into the Fluorinert, which was pumped out of the machine to a chilled water heat exchanger.

Performance per watt of modern systems has greatly improved; many more computations can be carried out with a given power consumption than was possible with the integrated circuits of the 1980s and 1990s. Recent supercomputer projects such as Blue Gene rely on air cooling, which reduces cost, complexity, and size of systems compared to liquid cooling.

==Air cooling==
===Fans===
Fans are used when natural convection is insufficient to remove heat. Fans may be fitted to the computer case or attached to CPUs, GPUs, chipsets, power supply units (PSUs), hard drives, or as cards plugged into an expansion slot. Common fan sizes include 40, 60, 80, 92, 120, and 140 mm. 200, 230, 250 and 300 mm fans are sometimes used in high-performance personal computers.

====Performance of fans in chassis====
A computer has a certain resistance to air flowing through the chassis and components. This is the sum of all the smaller impediments to air flow, such as the inlet and outlet openings, air filters, internal chassis, and electronic components. Fans are simple air pumps that provide pressure to the air of the inlet side relative to the output side. That pressure difference moves air through the chassis, with air flowing to areas of lower pressure.

Fans generally have two published specifications: free air flow and maximum differential pressure. Free air flow is the amount of air a fan will move with zero back-pressure. Maximum differential pressure is the amount of pressure a fan can generate when completely blocked. In between these two extremes are a series of corresponding measurements of flow versus pressure which is usually presented as a graph. Each fan model will have a unique curve, like the dashed curves in the adjacent illustration.

====Parallel vis-à-vis series installation====
Fans can be installed parallel to each other, in series, or a combination of both. Parallel installation would be fans mounted side by side. Series installation would be a second fan in line with another fan such as an inlet fan and an exhaust fan. To simplify the discussion, it is assumed the fans are the same model.

Parallel fans will provide double the free air flow but no additional driving pressure. Series installation, on the other hand, will double the available static pressure but not increase the free air flow rate. The adjacent illustration shows a single fan versus two fans in parallel with a maximum pressure of of water and a doubled flow rate of about .

Note that air flow changes as the square root of the pressure. Thus, doubling the pressure will only increase the flow 1.41 () times, not twice as might be assumed. Another way of looking at this is that the pressure must go up by a factor of four to double the flow rate.

To determine flow rate through a chassis, the chassis impedance curve can be measured by imposing an arbitrary pressure at the inlet to the chassis and measuring the flow through the chassis. This requires fairly sophisticated equipment. With the chassis impedance curve (represented by the solid red and black lines on the adjacent curve) determined, the actual flow through the chassis as generated by a particular fan configuration is graphically shown where the chassis impedance curve crosses the fan curve. The slope of the chassis impedance curve is a square root function, where doubling the flow rate required four times the differential pressure.

In this particular example, adding a second fan provided marginal improvement with the flow for both configurations being approximately . While not shown on the plot, a second fan in series would provide slightly better performance than the parallel installation. 

====Temperature vis-à-vis flow rate====
The equation for required airflow through a chassis is

: formula_1

where
* formula_2 = Cubic Feet per Minute ()
* formula_3 = Heat Transferred (kW)
* formula_4 = Specific Heat of Air
* formula_5 = Density
* formula_6 = Change in Temperature (in °F)

A simple conservative rule of thumb for cooling flow requirements, discounting such effects as heat loss through the chassis walls and laminar versus turbulent flow, and accounting for the constants for specific heat and density at sea level is:

: formula_7

: formula_8

For example, a typical chassis with 500 watts of load, maximum internal temperature in a environment, i.e. a difference of :

: formula_9

This would be actual flow through the chassis and not the free air rating of the fan. It should also be noted that &quot;Q&quot;, the heat transferred, is a function of the heat transfer efficiency of a CPU or GPU cooler to the airflow.

===Piezoelectric pump===
A &quot;dual piezo cooling jet&quot;, patented by GE, uses vibrations to pump air through the device. The initial device is three millimetres thick and consists of two nickel discs that are connected on either side to a sliver of piezoelectric ceramics. An alternating current passed through the ceramic component causes it to expand and contract at up to 150 times per second so that the nickel discs act like a bellows. Contracted, the edges of the discs are pushed apart and suck in hot air. Expanding brings the nickel discs together, expelling the air at high velocity.

The device has no bearings and does not require a motor. It is thinner and consumes less energy than typical fans. The jet can move the same amount of air as a cooling fan twice its size while consuming half as much electricity and at lower cost.

==Passive cooling==
Passive heatsink cooling involves attaching a block of machined or extruded metal to the part that needs cooling. A thermal adhesive may be used. More commonly for a personal computer CPU, a clamp holds the heatsink directly over the chip, with a thermal grease or thermal pad spread between. This block has fins and ridges to increase its surface area. The heat conductivity of metal is much better than that of air, and it radiates heat better than the component that it is protecting (usually an integrated circuit or CPU).

Dust buildup between the metal fins of a heatsink gradually reduces efficiency, but can be countered with a gas duster by blowing away the dust along with any other unwanted excess material.

Passive heatsinks are commonly found on older CPUs, parts that do not get very hot (such as the chipset), low-power computers, and embedded devices. Many smartphones are used passive cooling without heatsinks.

Usually a heatsink is attached to the integrated heat spreader (IHS), essentially a large, flat plate attached to the CPU, with conduction paste layered between. This dissipates or spreads the heat locally. Unlike a heatsink, a spreader is meant to redistribute heat, not to remove it. In addition, the IHS protects the fragile CPU.

Passive cooling involves no fan noise, as convection forces move air over the heatsink.

==Other techniques==
===Liquid immersion cooling===

Another growing trend due to the increasing heat density of computers, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs is to immerse the entire computer or select components in a thermally, but not electrically, conductive liquid. Although rarely used for the cooling of personal computers, liquid immersion is a routine method of cooling large power distribution components such as transformers. It is also becoming popular with data centers. Personal computers cooled in this manner may not require either fans or pumps, and may be cooled exclusively by passive heat exchange between the computer hardware and the enclosure it is placed in. A heat exchanger (i.e. heater core or radiator) might still be needed though, and the piping also needs to be placed correctly.

The coolant used must have sufficiently low electrical conductivity not to interfere with the normal operation of the computer. If the liquid is somewhat electrically conductive, it may cause electrical shorts between components or traces and permanently damage them. For these reasons, it is preferred that the liquid be an insulator (dielectric) and not conduct electricity.

A wide variety of liquids exist for this purpose, including transformer oils, synthetic single-phase and dual phase dielectric coolants such as 3M Fluorinert or 3M Novec. Non-purpose oils, including cooking, motor and silicone oils, have been successfully used for cooling personal computers.

Some fluids used in immersion cooling, especially hydrocarbon based materials such as mineral oils, cooking oils, and organic esters, may degrade some common materials used in computers such as rubbers, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and thermal greases. Therefore it is critical to review the material compatibility of such fluids prior to use. Mineral oil in particular has been found to have negative effects on PVC and rubber-based wire insulation. Thermal pastes used to transfer heat to heatsinks from processors and graphic cards has been reported to dissolve in some liquids, however with negligible impact to cooling, unless the components were removed and operated in air.

Evaporation, especially for 2-phase coolants, can pose a problem, and the liquid may require either to be regularly refilled or sealed inside the computer&#x27;s enclosure. Immersion cooling can allow for extremely low PUE values of 1.05, vs air cooling&#x27;s 1.35, and allow for up to 100 KW of computing power (heat dissipation, TDP) per 19-inch rack, as opposed to air cooling, which usually handles up to 23 KW.

===Waste heat reduction===
Where powerful computers with many features are not required, less powerful computers or ones with fewer features can be used. a VIA EPIA motherboard with CPU typically dissipates approximately 25 watts of heat, whereas a more capable Pentium 4 motherboard and CPU typically dissipates around 140 watts. Computers can be powered with direct current from an external power supply unit which does not generate heat inside the computer case. The replacement of cathode-ray-tube (CRT) displays by more efficient thin-screen liquid crystal display (LCD) ones in the early twenty-first century has reduced power consumption significantly.

===Heat-sinks===
A component may be fitted in good thermal contact with a heatsink, a passive device with large thermal capacity and with a large surface area relative to its volume. Heatsinks are usually made of a metal with high thermal conductivity such as aluminium or copper, and incorporate fins to increase surface area. Heat from a relatively small component is transferred to the larger heatsink; the equilibrium temperature of the component plus heatsink is much lower than the component&#x27;s alone would be. Heat is carried away from the heatsink by convective or fan-forced airflow. Fan cooling is often used to cool processors and graphics cards that consume significant amounts of electrical energy. In a computer, a typical heat-generating component may be manufactured with a flat surface. A block of metal with a corresponding flat surface and finned construction, sometimes with an attached fan, is clamped to the component. To fill poorly conducting air gaps due to imperfectly flat and smooth surfaces, a thin layer of thermal grease, a thermal pad, or thermal adhesive may be placed between the component and heatsink.

Heat is removed from the heatsink by convection, to some extent by radiation, and possibly by conduction if the heatsink is in thermal contact with, say, the metal case. Inexpensive fan-cooled aluminium heatsinks are often used on standard desktop computers. Heatsinks with copper base-plates, or made of copper, have better thermal characteristics than those made of aluminium. A copper heatsink is more effective than an aluminium unit of the same size, which is relevant with regard to the high-power-consumption components used in high-performance computers.

Passive heatsinks are commonly found on older CPUs, parts that do not dissipate much power (such as the chipset), computers with low-power processors, and equipment where silent operation is critical and fan noise unacceptable.

Usually a heatsink is clamped to the integrated heat spreader (IHS), a flat metal plate the size of the CPU package which is part of the CPU assembly and spreads the heat locally. A thin layer of thermal compound is placed between them to compensate for surface imperfections. The spreader&#x27;s primary purpose is to redistribute heat. The heatsink fins improve its efficiency.
Several brands of DDR2, DDR3, DDR4 and DDR5 DRAM memory modules are fitted with a finned heatsink clipped onto the top edge of the module. The same technique is used for video cards that use a finned passive heatsink on the GPU.

Higher-end M.2 SSDs can be prone to significant heat generation, and as a result these may be sold with a heatsink included, or alternatively a third-party heatsink may be attached by the user during installation.

Fan-cooled aluminium heatsinks were originally the norm for desktop computers, but nowadays many heatsinks feature copper base-plate, copper base-circle, or are entirely made of copper.

Dust tends to build up in the crevices of finned heatsinks, particularly with the high airflow produced by fans. This keeps the air away from the hot component, reducing cooling effectiveness; however, removing the dust restores effectiveness.

===Peltier (thermoelectric) cooling===

Peltier junctions are generally only around 10–15% as efficient as the ideal refrigerator (Carnot cycle), compared with 40–60% achieved by conventional compression cycle systems (reverse Rankine systems using compression/expansion). Due to this lower efficiency, thermoelectric cooling is generally only used in environments where the solid state nature (no moving parts, low maintenance, compact size, and orientation insensitivity) outweighs pure efficiency.

Modern TECs use several stacked units each composed of dozens or hundreds of thermocouples laid out next to each other, which allows for a substantial amount of heat transfer. A combination of bismuth and tellurium is most commonly used for the thermocouples.

As active heat pumps which consume power, TECs can produce temperatures below ambient, impossible with passive heatsinks, radiator-cooled liquid cooling, and heatpipe HSFs. However, while pumping heat, a Peltier module will typically consume more electric power than the heat amount being pumped.

It is also possible to use a Peltier element together with a high pressure refrigerant (two phase cooling) to cool the CPU.

===Liquid cooling===


Liquid cooling is a highly effective method of removing excess heat, with the most common heat transfer fluid in desktop PCs being (distilled) water. The advantages of water cooling over air cooling include water&#x27;s higher specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity.

The principle used in a typical (active) liquid cooling system for computers is identical to that used in an automobile&#x27;s internal combustion engine, with the water being circulated by a water pump through a water block mounted on the CPU (and sometimes additional components as GPU and northbridge) and out to a heat exchanger, typically a radiator. The radiator is itself usually cooled additionally by means of a fan. Besides a fan, it could possibly also be cooled by other means, such as a Peltier cooler (although Peltier elements are most commonly placed directly on top of the hardware to be cooled, and the coolant is used to conduct the heat away from the hot side of the Peltier element). A coolant reservoir is often also connected to the system.

Besides active liquid cooling systems, passive liquid cooling systems are also sometimes used. These systems often leave out a fan or a water pump, theoretically increasing their reliability and making them quieter than active systems. The downsides of these systems are that they are much less efficient in discarding the heat and thus also need to have much more coolantand thus a much bigger coolant reservoirgiving the coolant more time to cool down.

Liquids allow the transfer of more heat from the parts being cooled than air, making liquid cooling suitable for overclocking and high performance computer applications. Compared to air cooling, liquid cooling is also influenced less by the ambient temperature. Liquid cooling&#x27;s comparatively low noise level compares favorably to that of air cooling, which can become quite noisy.

Disadvantages of liquid cooling include complexity and the potential for a coolant leak. Leaking water (and any additives in the water) can damage electronic components with which it comes into contact, and the need to test for and repair leaks makes for more complex and less reliable installations. (The first major foray into the field of liquid-cooled personal computers for general use, the high-end versions of Apple&#x27;s Power Mac G5, was ultimately doomed by a propensity for coolant leaks.&lt;ref name=&quot;PowerMac G5 Coolant Leaks/Repairs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) An air-cooled heatsink is generally much simpler to build, install, and maintain than a water cooling solution, although CPU-specific water cooling kits can also be found, which may be just as easy to install as an air cooler. These are not limited to CPUs, and liquid cooling of GPU cards is also possible.

While originally limited to mainframe computers, liquid cooling has become a practice largely associated with overclocking in the form of either manufactured all-in-one (AIO) kits or do-it-yourself setups assembled from individually gathered parts. The past few years have seen an increase in the popularity of liquid cooling in pre-assembled, moderate to high performance, desktop computers. Sealed (&quot;closed-loop&quot;) systems incorporating a small pre-filled radiator, fan, and waterblock simplify the installation and maintenance of water cooling at a slight cost in cooling effectiveness relative to larger and more complex setups. Liquid cooling is typically combined with air cooling, using liquid cooling for the hottest components, such as CPUs or GPUs, while retaining the simpler and cheaper air cooling for less demanding components.

The IBM Aquasar system uses &quot;hot water cooling&quot; to achieve energy efficiency, the water being used to heat buildings as well.

Since 2011, the effectiveness of water cooling has prompted a series of all-in-one (AIO) water cooling solutions. AIO solutions result in a much simpler to install the unit, and most units have been reviewed positively by review sites.

===Heat pipes and vapor chambers===


A heat pipe is a hollow tube containing a heat transfer liquid. The liquid absorbs heat and evaporates at one end of the pipe. The vapor travels to the other (cooler) end of the tube, where it condenses, giving up its latent heat. The liquid returns to the hot end of the tube by gravity or capillary action and repeats the cycle. Heat pipes have a much higher effective thermal conductivity than solid materials. For use in computers, the heatsink on the CPU is attached to a larger radiator heatsink. Both heatsinks are hollow, as is the attachment between them, creating one large heat pipe that transfers heat from the CPU to the radiator, which is then cooled using some conventional method. This method is usually used when space is tight, as in small form-factor PCs and laptops, or where no fan noise can be tolerated, as in audio production. Because of the efficiency of this method of cooling, many desktop CPUs and GPUs, as well as high end chipsets, use heat pipes or vapor chambers in addition to active fan-based cooling and passive heatsinks to remain within safe operating temperatures. A vapor chamber operates on the same principles as a heat pipe but takes on the form of a slab or sheet instead of a pipe. Heat pipes may be placed vertically on top and form part of vapor chambers. Vapor chambers may also be used on high-end smartphones.

===Electrostatic air movement and corona discharge effect cooling===
The cooling technology under development by Kronos and Thorn Micro Technologies employs a device called an ionic wind pump (also known as an electrostatic fluid accelerator). The basic operating principle of an ionic wind pump is corona discharge, an electrical discharge near a charged conductor caused by the ionization of the surrounding air.

The corona discharge cooler developed by Kronos works in the following manner: A high electric field is created at the tip of the cathode, which is placed on one side of the CPU. The high energy potential causes the oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the air to become ionized (positively charged) and create a corona (a halo of charged particles). Placing a grounded anode at the opposite end of the CPU causes the charged ions in the corona to accelerate towards the anode, colliding with neutral air molecules on the way. During these collisions, momentum is transferred from the ionized gas to the neutral air molecules, resulting in movement of gas towards the anode.

The advantages of the corona-based cooler are its lack of moving parts, thereby eliminating certain reliability issues and operating with a near-zero noise level and moderate energy consumption.

===Soft cooling===
Soft cooling is the practice of utilizing software to take advantage of CPU power saving technologies to minimize energy use. This is done using halt instructions to turn off or put in standby state CPU subparts that aren&#x27;t being used or by underclocking the CPU. While resulting in lower total speeds, this can be very useful if overclocking a CPU to improve user experience rather than increase raw processing power, since it can prevent the need for noisier cooling. Contrary to what the term suggests, it is not a form of cooling but of reducing heat creation.

===Undervolting===
Undervolting is a practice of running the CPU or any other component with voltages below the device specifications. An undervolted component draws less power and thus produces less heat. The ability to do this varies by manufacturer, product line, and even different production runs of the same product (as well as that of other components in the system), but processors are often specified to use voltages higher than strictly necessary. This tolerance ensures that the processor will have a higher chance of performing correctly under sub-optimal conditions, such as a lower-quality motherboard or low power supply voltages. Below a certain limit, the processor will not function correctly, although undervolting too far does not typically lead to permanent hardware damage (unlike overvolting).

Undervolting is used for quiet systems, as less cooling is needed because of the reduction of heat production, allowing noisy fans to be omitted. It is also used when battery charge life must be maximized.

===Chip-integrated===
Conventional cooling techniques all attach their &quot;cooling&quot; component to the outside of the computer chip package. This &quot;attaching&quot; technique will always exhibit some thermal resistance, reducing its effectiveness. The heat can be more efficiently and quickly removed by directly cooling the local hot spots of the chip, within the package. At these locations, power dissipation of over 300 W/cm2 (typical CPU is less than 100 W/cm2) can occur, although future systems are expected to exceed 1000 W/cm2. This form of local cooling is essential to developing high power density chips. This ideology has led to the investigation of integrating cooling elements into the computer chip. Currently there are two techniques: micro-channel heatsinks, and jet impingement cooling.

In micro-channel heatsinks, channels are fabricated into the silicon chip (CPU), and coolant is pumped through them. The channels are designed with very large surface area which results in large heat transfers. Heat dissipation of 3000 W/cm2 has been reported with this technique. The heat dissipation can be further increased if two-phase flow cooling is applied. Unfortunately, the system requires large pressure drops, due to the small channels, and the heat flux is lower with dielectric coolants used in electronic cooling.

Another local chip cooling technique is jet impingement cooling. In this technique, a coolant is flowed through a small orifice to form a jet. The jet is directed toward the surface of the CPU chip, and can effectively remove large heat fluxes. Heat dissipation of over 1000 W/cm2 has been reported. The system can be operated at lower pressure in comparison to the micro-channel method. The heat transfer can be further increased using two-phase flow cooling and by integrating return flow channels (hybrid between micro-channel heatsinks and jet impingement cooling).

===Phase-change cooling===
Phase-change cooling is an extremely effective way to cool the processor. A vapor compression phase-change cooler is a unit that usually sits underneath the PC, with a tube leading to the processor. Inside the unit is a compressor of the same type as in an air conditioner. The compressor compresses a gas (or mixture of gases) which comes from the evaporator (CPU cooler discussed below). Then, the very hot high-pressure vapor is pushed into the condenser (heat dissipation device) where it condenses from a hot gas into a liquid, typically subcooled at the exit of the condenser then the liquid is fed to an expansion device (restriction in the system) to cause a drop in pressure a vaporize the fluid (cause it to reach a pressure where it can boil at the desired temperature); the expansion device used can be a simple capillary tube to a more elaborate thermal expansion valve. The liquid evaporates (changing phase), absorbing the heat from the processor as it draws extra energy from its environment to accommodate this change (see latent heat). The evaporation can produce temperatures reaching around . The liquid flows into the evaporator cooling the CPU, turning into a vapor at low pressure. At the end of the evaporator this gas flows down to the compressor and the cycle begins over again. This way, the processor can be cooled to temperatures ranging from , depending on the load, wattage of the processor, the refrigeration system (see refrigeration) and the gas mixture used. This type of system suffers from a number of issues (cost, weight, size, vibration, maintenance, cost of electricity, noise, need for a specialized computer tower) but, mainly, one must be concerned with dew point and the proper insulation of all sub-ambient surfaces that must be done (the pipes will sweat, dripping water on sensitive electronics).

Alternately, a new breed of the cooling system is being developed, inserting a pump into the thermosiphon loop. This adds another degree of flexibility for the design engineer, as the heat can now be effectively transported away from the heat source and either reclaimed or dissipated to ambient. Junction temperature can be tuned by adjusting the system pressure; higher pressure equals higher fluid saturation temperatures. This allows for smaller condensers, smaller fans, and/or the effective dissipation of heat in a high ambient temperature environment. These systems are, in essence, the next generation fluid cooling paradigm, as they are approximately 10 times more efficient than single-phase water. Since the system uses a dielectric as the heat transport medium, leaks do not cause a catastrophic failure of the electric system.

This type of cooling is seen as a more extreme way to cool components since the units are relatively expensive compared to the average desktop. They also generate a significant amount of noise, since they are essentially refrigerators; however, the compressor choice and air cooling system is the main determinant of this, allowing for flexibility for noise reduction based on the parts chosen.

A &quot;thermosiphon&quot; traditionally refers to a closed system consisting of several pipes and/or chambers, with a larger chamber containing a small reservoir of liquid (often having a boiling point just above ambient temperature, but not necessarily). The larger chamber is as close to the heat source and designed to conduct as much heat from it into the liquid as possible, for example, a CPU cold plate with the chamber inside it filled with the liquid. One or more pipes extend upward into some sort of radiator or similar heat dissipation area, and this is all set up such that the CPU heats the reservoir and liquid it contains, which begins boiling, and the vapor travels up the tube(s) into the radiator/heat dissipation area, and then after condensing, drips back down into the reservoir, or runs down the sides of the tube. This requires no moving parts, and is somewhat similar to a heat pump, except that capillary action is not used, making it potentially better in some sense (perhaps most importantly, better in that it is much easier to build, and much more customizable for specific use cases and the flow of coolant/vapor can be arranged in a much wider variety of positions and distances, and have far greater thermal mass and maximum capacity compared to heat pipes which are limited by the amount of coolant present and the speed and flow rate of coolant that capillary action can achieve with the wicking used, often sintered copper powder on the walls of the tube, which have a limited flow rate and capacity.)

===Liquid nitrogen===
As liquid nitrogen boils at , far below the freezing point of water, it is valuable as an extreme coolant for short overclocking sessions.

In a typical installation of liquid nitrogen cooling, a copper or aluminium pipe is mounted on top of the processor or graphics card. After the system has been heavily insulated against condensation, the liquid nitrogen is poured into the pipe, resulting in temperatures well below .

Evaporation devices ranging from cut out heatsinks with pipes attached to custom milled copper containers are used to hold the nitrogen as well as to prevent large temperature changes. However, after the nitrogen evaporates, it has to be refilled. In the realm of personal computers, this method of cooling is seldom used in contexts other than overclocking trial-runs and record-setting attempts, as the CPU will usually expire within a relatively short period of time due to temperature stress caused by changes in internal temperature.

Although liquid nitrogen is non-flammable, it can condense oxygen directly from air. Mixtures of liquid oxygen and flammable materials can be dangerously explosive.

Liquid nitrogen cooling is, generally, only used for processor benchmarking, due to the fact that continuous usage may cause permanent damage to one or more parts of the computer and, if handled in a careless way, can even harm the user, causing frostbite.

===Liquid helium===
Liquid helium, colder than liquid nitrogen, has also been used for cooling. Liquid helium boils at , and temperatures ranging from have been measured from the heatsink. However, liquid helium is more expensive and more difficult to store and use than liquid nitrogen. Also, extremely low temperatures can cause integrated circuits to stop functioning. Silicon-based semiconductors, for example, will freeze out at around .

==Optimization==
Cooling can be improved by several techniques which may involve additional expense or effort. These techniques are often used, in particular, by those who run parts of their computer (such as the CPU and GPU) at higher voltages and frequencies than specified by manufacturer (overclocking), which increases heat generation.

The installation of higher performance, non-stock cooling may also be considered modding. Many overclockers simply buy more efficient, and often, more expensive fan and heatsink combinations, while others resort to more exotic ways of computer cooling, such as liquid cooling, Peltier effect heatpumps, heat pipe or phase change cooling.

There are also some related practices that have a positive impact in reducing system temperatures:

===Thermally conductive compounds===

Often called Thermal Interface Material (TIM).

Perfectly flat surfaces in contact give optimal cooling, but perfect flatness and absence of microscopic air gaps is not practically possible, particularly in mass-produced equipment. A very thin skim of thermal compound, which is much more thermally conductive than air, though much less so than metal, can improve thermal contact and cooling by filling in the air gaps. If only a small amount of compound just sufficient to fill the gaps is used, the best temperature reduction will be obtained.

There is much debate about the merits of compounds, and overclockers often consider some compounds to be superior to others. The main consideration is to use the minimal amount of thermal compound required to even out surfaces, as the thermal conductivity of compound is typically 1/3 to 1/400 that of metal, though much better than air. The conductivity of the heatsink compound ranges from about 0.5 to 80W/mK (see articles); that of aluminium is about 200, that of air about 0.02. Heat-conductive pads are also used, often fitted by manufacturers to heatsinks. They are less effective than properly applied thermal compound, but simpler to apply and, if fixed to the heatsink, cannot be omitted by users unaware of the importance of good thermal contact, or replaced by a thick and ineffective layer of compound.

Unlike some techniques discussed here, the use of thermal compound or padding is almost universal when dissipating significant amounts of heat.

===Heat sink lapping===
Mass-produced CPU heat spreaders and heatsink bases are never perfectly flat or smooth; if these surfaces are placed in the best contact possible, there will be air gaps which reduce heat conduction. This can easily be mitigated by the use of thermal compound, but for the best possible results surfaces must be as flat as possible. This can be achieved by a laborious process known as lapping, which can reduce CPU temperature by typically .

===Rounded cables===
Most older PCs use flat ribbon cables to connect storage drives (IDE or SCSI). These large flat cables greatly impede airflow by causing drag and turbulence. Overclockers and modders often replace these with rounded cables, with the conductive wires bunched together tightly to reduce surface area. Theoretically, the parallel strands of conductors in a ribbon cable serve to reduce crosstalk (signal carrying conductors inducing signals in nearby conductors), but there is no empirical evidence of rounding cables reducing performance. This may be because the length of the cable is short enough so that the effect of crosstalk is negligible. Problems usually arise when the cable is not electromagnetically protected and the length is considerable, a more frequent occurrence with older network cables.

These computer cables can then be cable tied to the chassis or other cables to further increase airflow.

This is less of a problem with new computers that use serial ATA which has a much narrower cable.

===Airflow===

The colder the cooling medium (the air), the more effective the cooling. Cooling air temperature can be improved with these guidelines:
* Supply cool air to the hot components as directly as possible. Examples are air snorkels and tunnels that feed outside air directly and exclusively to the CPU or GPU cooler. For example, the BTX case design prescribes a CPU air tunnel.
* Expel warm air as directly as possible. Examples are: Conventional PC (ATX) power supplies blow the warm air out the back of the case. Many dual-slot graphics card designs blow the warm air through the cover of the adjacent slot. There are also some aftermarket coolers that do this. Some CPU cooling designs blow the warm air directly towards the back of the case, where it can be ejected by a case fan.
* Air that has already been used to spot-cool a component should not be reused to spot-cool a different component (this follows from the previous items). The BTX case design violates this rule, since it uses the CPU cooler&#x27;s exhaust to cool the chipset and often the graphics card. One may come across old or ultra-low-budget ATX cases which feature a PSU mount in the top. Most modern ATX cases do however have a PSU mount in the bottom of the case with a filtered air vent directly beneath the PSU.
* Prefer cool intake air, avoid inhaling exhaust air (outside air above or near the exhausts). For example, a CPU cooling air duct at the back of a tower case would inhale warm air from a graphics card exhaust. Moving all exhausts to one side of the case, conventionally the back/top, helps to keep the intake air cool.
* Hiding cables behind motherboard tray or simply apply ziptie and tucking cables away to provide unhindered airflow.

Fewer fans strategically placed will improve the airflow internally within the PC and thus lower the overall internal case temperature in relation to ambient conditions. The use of larger fans also improves efficiency and lowers the amount of waste heat along with the amount of noise generated by the fans while in operation.

There is little agreement on the effectiveness of different fan placement configurations, and little in the way of systematic testing has been done. For a rectangular PC (ATX) case, a fan in the front with a fan in the rear and one in the top has been found to be a suitable configuration. However, AMD&#x27;s (somewhat outdated) system cooling guidelines notes that &quot;A front cooling fan does not seem to be essential. In fact, in some extreme situations, testing showed these fans to be recirculating hot air rather than introducing cool air.&quot; It may be that fans in the side panels could have a similar detrimental effect – possibly through disrupting the normal air flow through the case. However, this is unconfirmed and probably varies with the configuration.

==== Air pressure ====

Loosely speaking, positive pressure means intake into the case is stronger than exhaust from the case. This configuration results in pressure inside of the case being higher than in its environment. Negative pressure means exhaust is stronger than intake. This results in internal air pressure being lower than in the environment. Both configurations have benefits and drawbacks, with positive pressure being the more popular of the two configurations. Negative pressure results in the case pulling air through holes and vents separate from the fans, as the internal gases will attempt to reach an equilibrium pressure with the environment. Consequently, this results in dust entering the computer in all locations. Positive pressure in combination with filtered intake solves this issue, as air will only incline to be exhausted through these holes and vents in order to reach an equilibrium with its environment. Dust is then unable to enter the case except through the intake fans, which need to possess dust filters.

==Computer types==

===Desktops===

Desktop computers typically use one or more fans for cooling. While almost all desktop power supplies have at least one built-in fan, power supplies should never draw heated air from within the case, as this results in higher PSU operating temperatures which decrease the PSU&#x27;s energy efficiency, reliability and overall ability to provide a steady supply of power to the computer&#x27;s internal components. For this reason, all modern ATX cases (with some exceptions found in ultra-low-budget cases) feature a power supply mount in the bottom, with a dedicated PSU air intake (often with its own filter) beneath the mounting location, allowing the PSU to draw cool air from beneath the case.

Most manufacturers recommend bringing cool, fresh air in at the bottom front of the case, and exhausting warm air from the top rear. If fans are fitted to force air into the case more effectively than it is removed, the pressure inside becomes higher than outside, referred to as a &quot;positive&quot; airflow (the opposite case is called &quot;negative&quot; airflow). Worth noting is that positive internal pressure only prevents dust accumulating in the case if the air intakes are equipped with dust filters. A case with negative internal pressure will suffer a higher rate of dust accumulation even if the intakes are filtered, as the negative pressure will draw dust in through any available opening in the case

The air flow inside the typical desktop case is usually not strong enough for a passive CPU heatsink. Most desktop heatsinks are active including one or even multiple directly attached fans or blowers.

===Servers===
==== Server coolers ====
Each server can have an independent internal cooler system; Server cooling fans in (1 U) enclosures are usually located in the middle of the enclosure, between the hard drives at the front and passive CPU heatsinks at the rear. Larger (higher) enclosures also have exhaust fans, and from approximately 4U they may have active heatsinks. Power supplies generally have their own rear-facing exhaust fans.

====Rack-mounted coolers====
Rack cabinet is a typical enclosure for horizontally mounted servers. Air typically drawn in at the front of the rack and exhausted at the rear. Each cabinet can have additional cooling options; for example, they can have a Close Coupled Cooling attachable module or integrated with cabinet elements (like cooling doors in iDataPlex server rack).

Another way of accommodating large numbers of systems in a small space is to use blade chassis, oriented vertically rather than horizontally, to facilitate convection. Air heated by the hot components tends to rise, creating a natural air flow along the boards (stack effect), cooling them. Some manufacturers take advantage of this effect.

==== Data center cooling ====
Because data centers typically contain large numbers of computers and other power-dissipating devices, they risk equipment overheating; extensive HVAC systems are used to prevent this. Often a raised floor is used so the area under the floor may be used as a large plenum for cooled air from a CRAC (Computer Room Air Conditioner) or a CRAH (Computer Room Air Handler) and power cabling. A plenum made with a false ceiling can also be present. Hot Aisle containment or cold aisle containment are also used in datacenters to improve cooling efficiency. Alternatively slab floors can be used which are similar to conventional floors, and overhead ducts can be used for cooling.

Direct Contact Liquid Cooling has emerged more efficient than air cooling options, resulting in smaller footprint, lower capital requirements and lower operational costs than air cooling. It uses warm liquid instead of air to move heat away from the hottest components. Energy efficiency gains from liquid cooling is also driving its adoption. Single and dual/two phase immersion/open tub cooling and single and dual phase direct-to-chip cooling as well as immersion cooling confined to individual server blades have also been proposed for use in data centers. In-row cooling, rack cooling, rear door heat exchangers, racktop cooling which places heat exchangers above the rack, overhead cooling above aisles or fan walls/thermal walls in a data center can also be used. Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) with cold plates for cooling chips in servers can be used due to the higher heat removal capacities of these systems. These systems can either cool some or all components on a server, using rubber or copper tubing respectively. Rear door heat exchangers were traditionally used for cooling high heat densities in data centers, but these did not see widespread adoption. They can be cooled with refrigerant or chilled water. Those cooled with chilled water can either be active, which have fans, or passive, which have no fans. Liquid-to-air heat exchangers (radiators) can be used to cool servers cooled with direct-to-chip liquid cooling, in order to avoid installation of facility water piping. These heat exchangers can be installed separately from racks, or as a rear door on a rack.

===Laptops===
Laptops present a difficult mechanical airflow design, power dissipation, and cooling challenge. Constraints specific to laptops include: the device as a whole has to be as light as possible; the form factor has to be built around the standard keyboard layout; users are very close, so noise must be kept to a minimum, and the case exterior temperature must be kept low enough to be used on a lap. Cooling generally uses forced air cooling but heat pipes and the use of the metal chassis or case as a passive heatsink are also common. Solutions to reduce heat include using lower power consumption ARM or Intel Atom processors.
=== Mobile devices ===
Mobile devices such as phones usually have no discrete cooling systems, as mobile CPU and GPU chips are designed for maximum power efficiency due to the constraints of the device&#x27;s battery. Some higher performance devices may include a heat spreader that aids in transferring heat to the external case of a phone or tablet.

<text>Digital Speech Standard (DSS) is a proprietary compressed digital audio file format defined by the International Voice Association, a consortium of Olympus, Philips and Grundig Business Systems.

DSS was originally developed in 1994 by Grundig with the University of Nuremberg. In 1997, the digital speech standard was released, which was based on the previous codec. It is commonly used on digital dictation recorders. Modern psychoacoustical codecs that perform nearly as well at only slightly higher bitrates have led to this speech coding standard being less used in modern voice recording equipment.

== Operation ==
The DSS file format stores voice audio data in a highly compressed format that allows basic recording functionality (such as recording, playing, rewinding, etc.) as well as the ability to record in either insert or overwrite mode making it ideal for dictation. This along with ability to include additional information in the file header for the transcriptionist including priority mark, author, job type, etc.

DSS is a format designed specifically for speech, equivalent to MP3 for music. In contrast with MP3, however, the quality usually is as low as possible, to minimize the size of the file.

<text>61* is a 2001 American sports drama television film directed by Billy Crystal and written by Hank Steinberg. It stars Barry Pepper as Roger Maris and Thomas Jane as Mickey Mantle on their quest to break Babe Ruth&#x27;s 1927 single-season home run record of 60 during the 1961 season of the New York Yankees. The film first aired on HBO on April 28, 2001.

==Plot==
In 1998, the family of the late Roger Maris goes to Busch Stadium to witness Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals break their father&#x27;s record with a 62nd home run. Maris&#x27; widow, Pat, is hospitalized due to complications from arrhythmia and watches the game on television from a hospital bed.

Decades earlier in 1961, Maris is presented with the Most Valuable Player award for the 1960 baseball season, but Mickey Mantle remains the New York Yankees&#x27; superstar. Mantle starts off hot while Maris struggles. Maris suspects he may be traded, but new manager Ralph Houk has Mantle and Maris switch places in the Yankees&#x27; batting order to see if it helps. It does, and Maris begins to hit home runs at a record pace. Mantle keeps pace and it becomes clear that both &quot;M&amp;M Boys&quot; will make a run at Babe Ruth&#x27;s record of 60 homers in one season.

Mickey&#x27;s life off the field is taking a toll on his playing. He drinks, enjoys the Manhattan nightlife and arrives at the ballpark hung over. More than once, pitcher Whitey Ford has to bail him out or sober him up. To keep Mantle out of trouble, Maris and teammate/roommate Bob Cerv invite him to move in with them in a modest home in Queens, with one condition: no women.

New York&#x27;s fans and media pull for the popular and personable Mantle, a long-time Yankee. The quieter Maris is viewed as an outsider, aloof and unworthy. As the two men close in on the record, MLB Commissioner Ford Frick, who was Babe Ruth&#x27;s ghostwriter, makes a decision: unless the record is broken in 154 games, as Ruth did in 1927, the new mark would be listed separately indicating it had been done in baseball&#x27;s newly expanded 162-game season.

It appears Mantle is not going to make it; his health deteriorates and he plays in constant pain. Maris, meanwhile, is unaccustomed to such a high level of public scrutiny and is uncomfortable interacting with the media, who dissect and distort everything he says or does. The fans heckle Maris and even throw objects at him on the field. Soon he begins receiving hate mail and death threats. His wife lives far from New York, usually available only by phone. The stress becomes so intense that Maris&#x27; hair begins to fall out in clumps. The Yankees owner also tries to favor Mantle by asking Houk to switch Mantle and Maris in the batting order, but Houk refuses, because the redesigned lineup has been winning a higher percentage of games.

Chronic injury and alcohol abuse catch up with Mantle, and an ill-advised injection by a doctor infects his hip and lands him in a hospital bed. With Mantle gone from the lineup, the stage becomes set for Maris. He fails to break the record in the 154th game of the season, but he does finally hit his 61st home run during the final game of the season.

==Cast==

==Filming locations==
Most of the baseball action scenes, including those set at Yankee Stadium, were actually filmed at Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Michigan. A combination of strategic photographing and post-production effects were used to enhance the illusion of the &quot;classic&quot; layout of Yankee Stadium. Tiger Stadium was credited as &quot;playing&quot; Yankee Stadium in the closing credits. Tiger Stadium also &quot;played itself&quot; as the home of the Tigers when the Yankees played them in Detroit.

The shots depicting Fenway Park and Baltimore&#x27;s Memorial Stadium were shot at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

==Critical reception==
At the 59th Golden Globe Awards, actor Barry Pepper was nominated for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film.

<doc id="798383" wikidata="Q1352596" url="?curid=798383" title="North American Interfraternity Conference">
<text>The North American Interfraternity Conference (or NIC; formerly known as the National Interfraternity Conference) is an association of intercollegiate men&#x27;s social fraternities that was formally organized in 1910. However, it began at a meeting at the University Club of New York on November 27, 1909. The power of the organization rests in a House of Delegates in which each member fraternity is represented by a single delegate. However, the group&#x27;s executive and administrative powers are vested in an elected board of directors consisting of nine volunteers from various NIC fraternities. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, the NIC has a small professional staff.

The NIC seeks to provide services that will include, &quot;but not be limited to, promotion of cooperative action in dealing with fraternity matters of mutual concern, research in areas of fraternity operations and procedures, fact-finding and data gathering, and the dissemination of such data to the member fraternities&quot;. However, it notes that &quot;[c]onference action shall not in any way abrogate the right of its member fraternities to self-determination&quot;.

As of December 2021, the NIC had fifty-six member organizations with 4,000 chapters located on over 800 campuses in the United States and Canada with approximately 350,000 undergraduate members.

Originally named the Interfraternity Conference, the name was changed to the National Interfraternity Conference in 1931. The name, North American Interfraternity Conference, was adopted in 1999 to reflect the organization&#x27;s affiliations at Canadian colleges and universities.

==Membership requirements==

The NIC membership requirements are detailed in the By-Laws of the North American Interfraternity Conference. Each member fraternity must be national or international in scope, as opposed to local, which is defined to mean having five chapters of ten men each, having three chapters that have been part of the fraternity for at least five years, and have a constitution that calls for national conventions with the interim authority vested in a smaller governing body. Further, each fraternity must be exclusive of other NIC members and, therefore, in competition with them for recruitment. All members&#x27; chapters must exist at four or two-year degree-granting colleges. The members agree to share &quot;best practices, statistics, and information that will benefit member organizations&quot;.

Also, the members agree to uphold universal fraternal ideals, to hold their chapters and colonies to their general vision statements, honor NIC resolutions, abide by the NIC Constitution and By-Laws, attend all meetings of the House of Delegates, and pay membership dues.

Each member fraternity must share a wealth of statistical information with the NIC including the number of new members, new member retention, the number of new initiates, total number of initiates, annual retention rate, the number of new chapters and their size, the number of closed chapters and the reason for closure, the total number of active chapters, number of members who are &quot;campus leaders&quot;, number of hours of community service completed, and amount of money raised for charitable causes. This information is aggregated, and the raw data is destroyed.

The NIC requires its members to support open expansion on their campuses. It requires that its members are insured and have risk management programs. It imposes a grade requirement on new members and initiated members. It denies members from having women&#x27;s auxiliary groups. It requires alcohol-free recruitment and new member programs, and new member programs are capped at twelve weeks and encouraged to be shorter. Finally, each member must have provisions for the emergency temporary suspension of any of its chapters.

NIC members are required to &quot;communicate its values through its ritual at least annually or as prescribed by its policies.&quot;

==Mission==

The NIC serves to advocate the needs of its member fraternities through the enrichment of the fraternity experience; advancement and growth of the fraternity community; and enhancement of the educational mission of the host institutions. The NIC is also committed to enhancing the benefits of fraternity membership. Each of the 75 member organizations has adopted the basic expectations of their members and agreed to the following Nine Basic Expectations.

#I will know and understand the ideals expressed in my fraternity ritual and will strive to incorporate them in my daily life.
#I will strive for academic achievement and practice academic integrity.
#I will respect the dignity of all persons; therefore I will not physically, mentally, psychologically or sexually abuse or harm any human being.
#I will protect the health and safety of all human beings.
#I will respect my property and the property of others; therefore, I will neither abuse nor tolerate the abuse of property.
#I will meet my financial obligations in a timely manner.
#I will neither use nor support the use of illegal drugs; I will neither misuse nor support the misuse of alcohol.
#I acknowledge that a clean and attractive environment is essential to both physical and mental health; therefore, I will do all in my power to see that the chapter property is properly cleaned and maintained.
#I will challenge all my fraternity members to abide by these fraternal expectations and will confront those who violate them.

==NIC meetings==

The NIC is not a governing or regulatory board. It is a voluntary trade association; therefore, it is important that the leadership of the organization gather regularly. This occurs annually at the NIC Congressional Reception and the NIC Annual Meeting.

At the congressional reception, the leadership of the NIC, National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), and the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO) sponsor a series of meetings and receptions to advance an agenda that is positive toward fraternal organizations. Legislative priorities are determined with current emphasis on the College Fire Prevention Act which authorizes federal funding to upgrade fire safety in college dormitories and fraternity/sorority housing. It is estimated that there is $3.7 billion worth of fraternity housing, most of which is currently not fitted with fire prevention devices such as sprinklers. Other legislative priorities include Freedom of Association, Freedom of Speech, student privacy, and single-sex exemptions under Title IX.

==Public relations efforts==

The North American Interfraternity Conference has conducted research that suggests that to most effectively improve its public perception, high school juniors and seniors should be the primary focus of its public relations campaign. Specifically, the NIC would like to convince these students that their values align with those of the fraternity system before they enter the college environment.

Additionally, the North American Interfraternity Conference believes that fraternity involvement supports the retention and success of college students, and, therefore, that strong partnerships between the fraternity and university community will have a positive effect on both communities. Moreover, they believe that support from the university community is essential to the success of the NIC&#x27;s public relations initiatives.

==Educational programming==

Five permanent staff members create learning opportunities for all undergraduate men through a variety of programs, most notably the IFC Academy, Undergraduate Interfraternity Institute (UIFI), IMPACT, Futures Quest, Recruitment Program, Alumni Academy, and the Alcohol Summit. The purpose of the NIC is to promote service, scholarship, the opportunity for self-development, and brotherhood.

The IFC Academy is a one‐day, 14‐hour program, focusing participants on their role in developing high‐performing IFCs – specifically the role of the IFC in serving the needs of its member fraternities, and the role the NIC Standards play in supporting high performance. The program provides IFCs with benchmarks to measure their successes on campus, tools to assess how IFCs should be responding to the needs of its member chapters, and a renewed enthusiasm for advocating for the needs of the fraternity community on its campus.

The Undergraduate Interfraternity Institute (UIFI) is a five-day co-educational program that brings fraternity and sorority leaders together and teaches leadership skills, creates awareness of important issues, and calls on each graduate of the program to lead a change initiative within his/her fraternity/sorority community. The program, begun in 1990, has over 4600 graduates since its inception. In addition, over 120 fraternity/sorority advisors, staff, and volunteers participate each year as facilitators during the program. These facilitators support the work of the NIC staff by leading small group discussions that personalize the experience throughout the institute. St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital has become an active partner in the UIFI curriculum by sponsoring the Service component of the curriculum.

IMPACT is a campus-based weekend program that brings fraternity and sorority community leaders together to identify a strategy for change and/or improvement to the local fraternal experience. IMPACT is an acronym for Influence, Motivation, Purpose, Action, Commitment, and Trust. These are the five ideals that the curriculum of the program emphasizes. The campus leaders work together during the weekend to identify what needs to change to ensure a bright future for the entire community. The staff of the NIC leads these programs throughout the year.

The Jon Williamson Futures Quest brings together the newest members of the fraternity community. To participate, these men will have joined a fraternity in the previous year. The curriculum of Futures Quest is designed to allow the participants to begin their fraternal journey in a very positive way and build an awareness of the vast scope of the opportunities that are available to each of them. During the experience, these men will identify a personal action plan for what they want to accomplish during their years in college and beyond. The participants leave the program with a feeling of confidence and their self-esteem is affirmed. This in turn positively influences the fraternities as these men assume leadership positions.

The most important aspect of the fraternal experience may be the need to invite new members to join a fraternity each year. As a result, the NIC offers a program to its members that teaches participants new skills in recruitment and focuses on the positive aspects of membership. The Recruitment Program is one of the most important programs offered by the NIC. Not only does it ensure that membership in fraternities will continue, but it also teaches vital skills that each participant can use beyond the fraternal experience. The program makes the direct statement, &quot;If you want to recruit me, then you better have a plan.&quot; The goal of the program is that every participant has a plan of action for their recruitment goals.

Programs are offered for alumni members of fraternities as well. Vital to the success of the undergraduate chapters, is the importance of having chapter advisors and alumni mentors. The Alumni Academy is an opportunity for alumni members of fraternities to identify ways to serve the fraternity as a chapter advisor, house corporation member, and/or mentor. In addition, the alumni are re-educated about the purpose of fraternity in the lives of young men and the newer aspects of the fraternity experience in today&#x27;s society. Finally, the academy forms a community from among the alumni boards that are on each campus. It brings together the alumni role models, getting them to solve campus issues while recognizing the effectiveness of teamwork.

The NIC is always seeking ways in which it may develop new initiatives to enhance the work of its member organizations. In 2000, the NIC received a $750,000 cooperative grant from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This signaled the beginning of efforts to reach into the college community and have students determine the best course of action to take to deal with the number one issue on college campuses - alcohol. The Alcohol Summit is designed to bring together a coalition of students to discuss alcohol issues and create lasting outcomes to address the effects of alcohol and high-risk drinking behaviors.

===Current members===

At one time, the National Interfraternity Conferences separated its members into those with Junior membership and those with Senior membership. In addition to the fraternity&#x27;s websites, chapter information is available at the Baird&#x27;s Manual Archive Online.


===Active former members===
Several of the historically large fraternities are no longer members of the NIC. In December 2002, Kappa Sigma (December 9), Phi Delta Theta (December 9), and Phi Sigma Kappa, withdrew their membership in the NIC due to disagreements with the strategic direction of the organization. Phi Sigma Kappa rejoined the NIC in 2006. On October 27, 2015, Lambda Chi Alpha resigned its membership, stating: &quot;Unfortunately, the NIC has recently elected to pursue counterproductive tactics that we believe are antithetical to our values and we cannot support them.&quot; On January 14, 2016, Tau Kappa Epsilon announced that it had resigned its membership effective immediately, citing an extreme increase in cost resulting from the NIC 2.0 initiative and the obligation to ensure every member dollar is spent wisely.

On January 24, 2017, Delta Epsilon Psi resigned to focus efforts on National APIDA Panhellenic Association (NAPA), and the Panhellenic Association. Sigma Phi Epsilon announced its resignation on November 7, 2019, citing that &quot;SigEp’s vision for how to enhance health and safety in the fraternity experience and partner with our host institutions has diverged from the NIC’s current approach.&quot;

In May 2020, five fraternities - Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Sigma Phi, Alpha Tau Omega, Kappa Alpha Order, and Theta Chi - established the Fraternity Forward Coalition (FFC). Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Sigma Phi, and Theta Chi have since not renewed membership in the NIC, leaving Alpha Tau Omega as the sole member of both the NIC and FFC. Gordy Heminger, a coalition organizer, stated, “We look forward to partnering with the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC)
and other similar organizations advocating on behalf of fraternities,” in the FFC announcement.


===Defunct former members===
Several former NIC members have gone inactive or have merged with other members of the NIC and thus no longer have been counted as members.

<text>Kakaʻako is a commercial and retail district of Honolulu, Hawaiʻi between Ala Moana near Waikīkī to the east and downtown Honolulu and Honolulu Harbor to the west. Kakaʻako is situated along the southern shores of the island of Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi.

== History ==
Kakaʻako was once a thriving Native Hawaiian community with agricultural terraces where Hawaiian royalty once lived. Kamehameha I had a residence with his family and personal kahuna and chief adviser Hewahewa. Hawaiians used the region for fishpond farming, salt making, wetland agriculture and human burials, according to Cultural Surveys Hawaii, which did several reports on the area.

Through recent development projects many locations have unearthed ancient Hawaiian burials (iwi) thought to be scattered throughout the district. One area in particular, the Honuakaha Smallpox Cemetery, has more than a thousand Iwi.

In 1976, Kakaʻako was an industrial district under city control. It got caught in a political feud between then-Mayor Frank Fasi and then-Gov. George Ariyoshi. Hawaiʻi lawmakers founded Hawaii Community Development Authority (HCDA) in April 1976 as a way to prevent Fasi from using Kakaʻako as political leverage against Ariyoshi. The agency produced editorial opposition from local papers.

==Modern day==

The civic centers of Kakaʻako are Victoria Ward Centers and the Neal S. Blaisdell Center. On the ocean side is the John A. Burns School of Medicine, part of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. It is also the location of the University of Hawaiʻi Cancer Center, a research center designated by the National Cancer Institute. The main roads through Kakaʻako are Ala Moana Boulevard and Kapiʻolani Boulevard. In recent years, the area has been diversifying by adding more residential development.

HCDA is planning for up to 30 new buildings to be constructed in the area. The plans have produced protests by residents. HCDA rules allow buildings up to 400 feet high. Kakaʻako&#x27;s proposed transit-oriented development plan would permit some towers to reach 700 feet, twice as high as the city’s building height limit.

Developers can skip the Hawaii Land Use Commission and Honolulu City Council. HCDA staff reviews proposals and its governor-appointed board has approval authority. In 2005, opposition group &quot;Save Our Kakaʻako Coalition&quot; protested Alexander &amp; Baldwin&#x27;s plans to build waterfront residential towers known as Kakaʻako Makai, leading the Legislature to effectively kill the project.

On 8 March 2014, the coalition rallied to protest against the proposed plans to develop residential homes alongside Kakaʻako&#x27;s waterfront. The coalition feared that access to the waterfront would be limited and warranted only to residents of the new development, ultimately depriving the Hawaiian people access to this resource and thus violating both Hawaiian law and custom. Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) trustee Peter Apo assured the public that OHA has no intentions of developing high-rises alongside Kakaʻako Makai. Apo added that if OHA did indeed conduct development in that area, it would betray the values and the people they serve. Lela Hubbard, member of Save Our Kakaʻako, claimed that OHA is only in it for the money.

In recent years, Kakaʻako has faced much controversy over growing concerns of gentrification and having previous affordable housing being bought out and no longer able to be used for low-income families.

== Our Kakaʻako ==
Our Kakaʻako is a residential and commercial project led by Kamehameha Schools and Castle &amp; Cooke Homes Hawaiʻi Inc. that aims to improve Hawaiʻi&#x27;s urban-island lifestyle. The $60 million project will add 183 homes to Kakaʻako, with 88 rental units to be developed by Kamehameha Schools and Castle &amp; Cooke developing the remaining 95 units for buyers. The project will redevelop existing properties in Kakaʻako for residential and commercial space, as well as integrate mid-block pedestrian crossways, networked walking paths, complete streetscapes, green spaces, and unique retail experiences. Our Kakaʻako is estimated to take 15–20 years to complete.

== Ward Village ==
Ward Village is a 60-acre (24 ha), master-planned community in the Kaka&#x27;ako district of Honolulu. It is being developed by The Howard Hughes Corporation. Once completed, this beachfront development will feature fifteen mixed-use residential towers, retail stores, entertainment venues, pedestrian friendly streets and public open space.

<doc id="798400" wikidata="Q1465252" url="?curid=798400" title="United States Department of the Air Force">
<text>The United States Department of the Air Force (DAF) is one of the three military departments within the Department of Defense of the United States of America. The Department of the Air Force was formed on September 18, 1947, per the National Security Act of 1947 (codified into Title 10 of the United States Code) and it is the military department within which the United States Air Force and the United States Space Force are organized.

The Department of the Air Force is headed by the secretary of the Air Force (SAF/OS), a civilian, who has the authority to conduct all of its affairs, subject to the authority, direction and control of the secretary of defense. The secretary of the Air Force&#x27;s principal deputy is the under secretary of the Air Force (SAF/US). Their senior staff assistants in the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force are five assistant secretaries for acquisition, technology &amp; logistics; financial management &amp; comptroller; installations, environment &amp; energy; manpower &amp; reserve affairs; and space acquisition &amp; integration and a general counsel. The highest-ranking military officers in the department, and senior military advisers to the secretary, are the chief of staff of the Air Force and chief of space operations.

By direction of the secretary of defense, the secretary of the Air Force assigns Air Force and Space Force units – apart from those units performing duties enumerated in unless otherwise directed – to the combatant commands. Only the secretary of defense and the president have the authority to approve a transfer of forces between combatant commands.

==Proposed redesignations==
===As the Department of the Aerospace Force===
In 1981, Congressman Ken Kramer introduced legislation to rename the Department of the Air Force as the Department of the Aerospace Force, along with renaming the United States Air Force as the United States Aerospace Force, to reorient the service and department from an air force to an aerospace force. The legislation would also have established a space command within the Aerospace Force and renamed the Air National Guard to the Aerospace National Guard. The legislation was cosponsored by Representatives G. William Whitehurst, Ike Skelton, and Robin Beard of the United States House Committee on Armed Services. Although the legislation was supported by General James E. Hill, who commanded North American Aerospace Defense Command and Aerospace Defense Command, the Air Force did not support the name change and the legislation did not pass.

===As the Department of the Air and Space Forces===

Following the United States Space Force&#x27;s establishment, calls have been made for the Department of the Air Force to rename itself the Department of the Air and Space Forces to acknowledge the Space Force, similar to calls made for the Department of the Navy to rename itself the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps. SpaceNews reported that a proposed name change was considered in 2018, and in 2019 the Air Force Association also called for renaming the department. In 2022, the Air Force Association renamed itself the Air &amp; Space Forces Association, internally acting on its proposal to reflect the Space Force in the organization&#x27;s name. In a 2021 article in the Space Force Journal, two Space Force officers also proposed a name change for the department.

Congress has also proposed a variety of name changes within the Department of the Air Force to recognize the Space Force&#x27;s establishment, including a 2022 proposal by the U.S. Senate to rename the Air National Guard to the Air and Space National Guard and 2020 proposal to rename the Airman&#x27;s Medal the Air and Space Force Medal, mirroring the Navy and Marine Corps Medal.

==Organizational structure==

The Department of the Air Force is divided into the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, which is led by the United States secretary of the Air Force, the Air Staff which is led by the chief of staff of the Air Force, and the Space Staff which is led by the chief of space operations.

The Department of the Air Force consists of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force.

<text>Tây Ninh is a province in the Southeast region of Vietnam, with the capital at the town of Tây Ninh.

Tây Ninh province is located between Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh, in Southern Key Economic Zone. Tây Ninh City is 99 km away from Ho Chi Minh City following National Route 22 and 40 km away from the border with Cambodia to the northwest.

Followers of the Cao Dai, who dominate the area, have built a Holy See in Tây Ninh. The region also has concentrations of the Hòa Hảo, a rival Buddhist sect. The area is noted for its large rubber and sugar plantations; rice and coconuts are also harvested.

The province has a population of 1,169,165 (in 2019) and an area of .

==Geography==
Like other Southeast provinces, Tây Ninh province is in the middle terrain of South Central Coast Highland and Mekong Delta, the terrain is relatively flat. Tây Ninh not only has highland terrain, but also has flat terrain such as Black Virgin Mountain with the height of 986 m, Phung Mountain (435 m), Heo Mountain (289 m), Tan Bien National Revolutionary Martyrs&#x27; Cemetery or &quot;Hill 82&quot; (82 m). Terrain of south districts is about 15 m height, while river source of Dầu Tiếng Lake and some places in Tân Châu District is about 115 m, flat terrain and floodplain is 1 m, but the average height in Tây Ninh province is just about 35 m. Overall, terrain&#x27;s height of Tây Ninh province is lower than that of other Southeast provinces, except Ho Chi Minh City.

==History==
The Vietnamese began to settle in the then Khmer territory in 1770. The Cao Đài religion originated in Tây Ninh. It is the birthplace of Trình Minh Thế, a nationalist and military leader during the end of the First Indochina War.

Because of the once-vaunted political and military power of the Cao Dai, this region was the scene of prolonged and heavy fighting during the First Indochina War. Tây Ninh province served as a major terminus of the Ho Chi Minh trail during the Vietnam War, and in 1969 the Viet Cong captured Tây Ninh town and held it for several days. During the period of conflict between Cambodia and Vietnam in the late 1970s, the Khmer Rouge launched a number of cross-border raids into Tây Ninh province and committed atrocities against civilians. Several cemeteries around Tây Ninh are stark reminders of these events.

==Economy==
In 2016–18, the province has reduced its rice and cassava growing areas and increased growing high-value fruits, according to the province&#x27;s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. The fruits include longan, grapefruit, durian, mango and soursop. During the period, the province&#x27;s fruit growing area had a growth rate of 9.1 per cent a year, taking the province&#x27;s total fruit area to 20,212ha by the end of 2018. The province has about 1,300ha of fruits, including soursop, grapefruit, pineapple, banana and dragon fruit, which are grown under VietGAP standards.

Chairwoman of the National Assembly Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân lauded Tây Ninh for its efforts in socioeconomic development, with the gross regional domestic product (GRDP) growing 8.5 per cent in 2018 and the provincial competitiveness index ranked 14th out of the 63 cities and provinces, up five places from 2017. Alongside economic development, the province should pay attention to sustainable environmental protection, especially sewage and forest environment issues. Urging the locality to pay due attention to the fight against smuggling, trade fraud, and counterfeit goods through border gates, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc stressed the need to combining socioeconomic development with ensuring defense and security in border areas.

Tây Ninh province owns 9 industrial parks included the list of Vietnam industrial zone until 2015 and the vision of 2020, with a total natural land area of 4,485 ha. So far, 5 IPs have been established including: Trang Bang IP (190ha), Linh Trung industrial and processing zone No. III (203ha); Bourbon An Hoa IP (760 ha), Phuoc Đong IP (2,190 ha), Cha La IP – phase I (42 ha), with a total natural land area of 3,385 ha, the industrial land area for lease to construct workshop is 2,162 ha.

In 2019, The Ministry of Transport, the Ho Chi Minh City People&#x27;s Committee and the Tây Ninh provincial People&#x27;s Committee held a conference in Ho Chi Minh City on October 26 to sign a coordination plan on the construction of the Ho Chi Minh City-Moc Bai highway. The highway, which is being implemented under a public-private partnership, will connect the city with Moc Bai International Border Gate in the southern province of Tay Ninh. The Moc Bai International Border Gate in Tây Ninh province has international exchanges with Cambodia and Thailand. National Road 22 is the only road linking HCM City with Mộc Bài. A survey conducted in 2017 showed that 39,700 vehicles traveled on the road each day, and that its designed loading capacity was 40,000 per day. Construction of the HCM City-Moc Bai Expressway is slated to be completed by 2025 with at least four lanes and expanded to six or eight lanes by 2045.

<doc id="798426" wikidata="Q2364759" url="?curid=798426" title="Cobb (film)">
<text>Cobb is a 1994 American biographical sports drama film starring Tommy Lee Jones as baseball player Ty Cobb. The film was written and directed by Ron Shelton and based on a 1994 book by Al Stump. The original music score was composed by Elliot Goldenthal. The film is told through the partnership between Cobb and sportswriter Al Stump who served as a ghostwriter of Cobb&#x27;s autobiography. Some critics lauded the film and Jones&#x27;s performance, but the box office results for the film were underwhelming, grossing little over $1 million on a budget of $25.5 million.

==Plot==
In 1960, sportswriter Al Stump is hired as the ghostwriter for an authorized autobiography of baseball player Tyrus Raymond &quot;Ty&quot; Cobb. Now 74 and in failing health, Cobb wants an official biography to &quot;set the record straight&quot; before he dies. In addition, Stump will get to accompany Cobb at the annual Baseball Hall of Fame ceremony in Cooperstown, New York, where Cobb is due to be inducted.

Stump arrives at Cobb&#x27;s estate on Lake Tahoe, where he finds Cobb to be a continually-drunken, misanthropic and bitter racist who abuses everyone he comes in contact with. Even though Cobb&#x27;s darker reputation was already a known secret by many, including Stump, the sportswriter is still shocked at the length of Cobb&#x27;s behavior and ill temper when seen at face value. Although Cobb&#x27;s home is luxurious, it is without heat, power, and running water due to long-running violent disputes between Cobb and utility companies. Cobb also rapidly runs through domestic workers, hiring and firing them in quick succession. Although Cobb is seriously ill and prone to frequent physical breakdowns, including sexual impotence, he retains considerable strength and also keeps several loaded firearms within easy reach at almost all times, making the outbreak of violent confrontation a constant possibility. Stump finds himself butting heads with Cobb from the first day of the job, when the two men differ on the structure of the book, with Cobb wanting to emphasize his self-proclaimed greatness, while Stump argues that Cobb can&#x27;t call himself great, but needs to rely on others proclaiming his greatness.

Before heading for Cooperstown, Cobb plans a quick trip for him and Stump to Reno for fun. Cobb almost gets killed in an automobile accident off the Donner Pass, driving recklessly in a blizzard. Stump rescues him, but Cobb then seizes control of Stump&#x27;s car until he gets into another accident. The car has to be towed to Reno. There, Stump and Cobb see a show at a resort hotel featuring Keely Smith and Louis Prima, whose act Cobb rudely interrupts.

One morning, Cobb comes into Stump&#x27;s hotel room and looks at some notes Stump had written that decry the ballplayer as &quot;pathetic&quot; and &quot;lost in the past&quot;. In a rage, Cobb argues with Stump that people aren&#x27;t interested in Cobb&#x27;s personal issues. Only his achievements as a great player are important. He then gleefully reveals that Stump&#x27;s agents agreed, behind the writer&#x27;s back, to allow Cobb final editorial approval on his book, breaking the standard clause Stump has in his contract. Despite Cobb&#x27;s preferred vision for the book, the player does start opening up to Stump about the pivotal event of his life, the death of his father by his mother, which he tells Stump was a result of his dad&#x27;s jealous personality.

A cigarette girl, Ramona, becomes interested in Stump, but when Cobb barges into the hotel room, he&#x27;s in a jealous rage. He knocks Stump out, takes Ramona to another room, where he physically abuses her, while still failing to achieve sexual arousal. Stump comes to just in time to see Ramona storm out of Cobb&#x27;s room, viciously mocking the player as &quot;Georgia trash.&quot; Horrified with what he&#x27;s seen of Cobb since meeting him, Stump decides to focus on writing the true story of Cobb, instead of Cobb&#x27;s intended version.
Aware of Cobb&#x27;s editorial approval, Stump writes two books concurrently, the one Cobb expects (&quot;My Life in Baseball&quot;) and a sensational, merciless account that will reveal the real Cobb, warts and all. Stump continues writing notes for the expose on different forms of hotel stationery, including hotel napkins which he hides. Stump then places the typewritten pages of &quot;My Life in Baseball&quot; on his workspace for Cobb to see and approve. Stump plans to complete Cobb&#x27;s version while the old man is still alive, guaranteeing his payment for the project without violating Cobb&#x27;s approval clause, and letting Cobb die happy. Stump will then issue the hard-hitting follow-up after Cobb is gone.

As Cobb and Stump resume the road trip, the two work on Cobb&#x27;s book during the day, while Stump works on his book late at night, as Cobb sleeps. Stump soon goes from just being Cobb&#x27;s ghostwriter to a general caretaker for the player, making sure Ty takes his various medications during the trip. Stump is amazed by the ill Cobb seeming to maintain some vitality despite his various ailments, which include cancer.

Cobb and Stump finally reach the Hall of Fame&#x27;s induction weekend in Cooperstown, New York, where many star players from Cobb&#x27;s era are in attendance, including Rogers Hornsby and Mickey Cochrane. In the runup to the dinner, Stump learns that Cobb has secretly been financially helping some old former teammates who have been struggling, which further shows layers to Cobb&#x27;s person. During the Hall of Fame dinner, A hallucinating Cobb becomes haunted by images from his violent past as he views film footage of his career. Despite publicly honoring Cobb, many of the same players attending the dinner block Cobb out of their private hotel afterparties, having been fed up with his bad behavior. From Cooperstown, Cobb and Stump drive south to Cobb&#x27;s native Georgia, where his estranged daughter refuses to see him, which Cobb later tells Stump is the same case with the rest of his surviving children and his ex-wives.

Continuing to write his dual accounts, Stump starts drinking heavily himself as he realizes that by doing his secret book and Cobb&#x27;s book concurrently, Stump was becoming what Cobb, for all his faults, wasn&#x27;t: a liar.

Despite still seeing Cobb as a man who treats people like dirt, Stump gains a grudging respect for the player&#x27;s legendary intensity, competitive fire, and no-holds-barred honesty about his reputation as a tough player, taking pride in how hated he was by fellow players and even spectators. Cobb, in turn, begins to regard Stump as a friend of sorts; it is clear his conduct has driven away virtually all his legitimate friends and family. Having mockingly called Al &quot;Al-imony&quot; in reference to the writer&#x27;s impending divorce, Cobb helps Stump finally accept that his marriage is over. Cobb also continues to open up more about his father&#x27;s death, which Stump realizes was partly responsible for Cobb&#x27;s antagonistic personality, despite the player&#x27;s denials. Cobb finally reveals to Stump that his father&#x27;s murder was not committed by his mother, as he had earlier told Stump, but by his mother&#x27;s lover.

After a long night of drinking, Stump passes out. Cobb accidentally discovers Stump&#x27;s notes for the no-punches-pulled version, bringing on an epic explosion.

As he aims his pistol in his mouth to kill himself, Cobb begins to seriously cough up blood and is taken to a hospital. Stump, waking up to discover Cobb saw the notes and knows the truth, finds Cobb at the hospital wielding a gun and treating doctors and nurses as harshly as he has everyone else. Cobb begrudgingly gives Stump his blessing to continue with the warts-and-all version, even admitting he respects the sportswriter for &quot;beating&quot; him, in a sense by fooling Cobb about his real intentions. Cobb&#x27;s parting request to the sportswriter is to remember, &quot;The desire for glory is not a sin.&quot;

Stump completes his twin books by the time Cobb passes away on July 17, 1961. As Cobb is buried alongside his parents, Stump, in voiceover, reveals that he ended up publishing the glowing autobiography Cobb hired him to write, instead of the real story.

==Cast==
==Production==
Baseball scenes were filmed in Birmingham, Alabama, at Rickwood Field, which stood in for Philadelphia&#x27;s Shibe Park and Pittsburgh&#x27;s Forbes Field. Scenes also were filmed in Ty Cobb&#x27;s actual hometown of Royston, Georgia.

Much of the &quot;Cobb&quot; location filming was in northern Nevada. The hotel check-in was at the Morris Hotel on Fourth Street in Reno. Casino, outdoor and entry shots were done outside Cactus Jack&#x27;s Hotel and Casino in Carson City and outside the then-closed, now-reopened (2007) Doppelganger&#x27;s Bar in Carson City.

Baseball announcer Ernie Harwell, a Ford Frick Award recipient, is featured as emcee at a Cooperstown, New York awards banquet. Real-life sportswriters Allan Malamud, Doug Krikorian, and Jeff Fellenzer and boxing publicist Bill Caplan appear in the movie&#x27;s opening and closing scenes at a Santa Barbara bar as Stump&#x27;s friends and fellow scribes.

Carson City free-lance photographer Bob Wilkie photographed many still scenes for &quot;Nevada Magazine&quot;, the Associated Press, and the &quot;Nevada Appeal&quot;.

Tommy Lee Jones was shooting this film when he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. As his head was already partially shaved in the front for his role as the balding, 72-year-old Cobb, the actor made light of the situation in his acceptance speech: &quot;All a man can say at a time like this is, &#x27;I am not really bald ... But I do have work.&quot; In addition to his partially shaved head, Jones also endured a broken ankle, suffered while practicing Cobb&#x27;s distinctive slide.

The film shows Cobb sharpening his spikes as a means to keep infielders from tagging him out as he ran the bases, and was accused of spiking several players who tried. Cobb, however, always denied ever spiking anyone on purpose. Tyler Logan Cobb, a descendant of Cobb&#x27;s, played &quot;Young Ty&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened in limited release in December 1994. It earned a reported $1,007,583 in the U.S., on a budget of $25.5 million, making it a box-office bomb.

===Critical response===
&quot;Cobb&quot; currently has a 65% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 48 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Tommy Lee Jones&#x27;s searing performance helps to elevate &quot;Cobb&quot; above your typical sports biopic; he&#x27;s so effective, in fact, that some may find the film unpleasant.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; hailed it as &quot;one of the year&#x27;s best&quot; and Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon&quot; included it on his list of the best films of the decade. Others took a harsher view of the picture. Owen Glieberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;D&quot;, claiming it to be a &quot;noisy, cantankerous buddy picture&quot; and presented Cobb as little more than a &quot;septuagenarian crank&quot;. He noted that while the film had constant reminders of Cobb&#x27;s records, it had little actual baseball in it, besides one flashback where Cobb is seen getting on base, then stealing third and home, and instigating a brawl with the opposing team. He explained: &quot;By refusing to place before our eyes Ty Cobb&#x27;s haunted ferocity as a baseball player, it succeeds in making him look even worse than he was.&quot;

Roger Ebert&#x27;s review of December 2, 1994 in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described &quot;Cobb&quot; as one of the most original biopics ever made and including &quot;one of Tommy Lee Jones&#x27;s best performances,&quot; but he notes Stump (played by Wuhl) and his lack of development in the film. However, he also criticized the length of the film, giving it 2 stars out of 4.
=== Year-end &#x27;Best&#x27; lists ===
* 7th – Peter Rainer, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;
* 9th – Peter Travers, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;
* Top 10 (not ranked) – George Meyer, &quot;The Ledger&quot;
* Best of the year (not ranked) - Jeffrey Lyons, &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;
* Honorable mention – Robert Denerstein, &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;

==Historical accuracy==
In his 2015 book &quot;Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty&quot;, author Charles Leerhsen asserts that the film is based on Al Stump&#x27;s 1961 and 1994 biographies of Ty Cobb, books noted for glaring inaccuracies regarding Cobb&#x27;s life, as well as a &quot;True&quot; magazine article, also by Stump, published after Cobb&#x27;s death. When the author Leerhsen contacted director Shelton concerning the inaccuracies, Shelton refused to provide documentation for some of the most extravagant aspects of the movie, and admitted to fabricating scenes along with &quot;Al&quot; because they believed it was something the real Cobb could have plausibly done in real life.

Previously, in 2010, an article by William R. Cobb (no relation to Ty) in the peer-reviewed &quot;The National Pastime,&quot; the official publication of the Society for American Baseball Research, had accused Al Stump of extensive forgeries of Cobb-related baseball and personal memorabilia, including personal documents and diaries. Stump even falsely claimed to possess a shotgun used by Cobb&#x27;s mother to kill his father (in a well-known 1905 incident officially ascribed to Mrs Cobb having mistaken her husband for an intruder). The shotgun later came into the hands of noted memorabilia collector Barry Halper. Despite the shotgun&#x27;s notoriety, official newspaper and court documents of the time clearly show Cobb&#x27;s father had been killed with a pistol. The article, and later expanded book, further accused Stump of numerous false statements about Cobb, not only during and immediately after their 1961 collaboration but also in Stump&#x27;s later years, most of which were sensationalistic in nature and intended to cast Cobb in an unflattering light. Cobb&#x27;s peer-reviewed research indicates that all of Stump&#x27;s works (print and memorabilia) surrounding Ty Cobb are at the very best called into question and at worst &quot;should be dismiss(ed) out of hand as untrue&quot;.

<text>The following is the 1971–72 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1971 through August 1972. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1970–71 season.

This season was the first in which the prime time schedule was shortened to three hours (with the exception of Sunday and Tuesday), giving the 7:30 p.m. slot back to local stations, as implemented in the Prime Time Access Rule.

New fall series are highlighted in bold.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.

=== GIMPS ===
The University of Central Missouri continues to hold an important role in the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search. The GIMPS project at UCM is a university-wide effort managed by Curtis Cooper and Steven Boone. As of 2022, UCM&#x27;s team () is currently the 10th place contributor to that project in terms of CPU power devoted to the project, and is the only GIMPS team that has discovered four Mersenne primes: M43 230402457 - 1 with 9,152,052 digits, M44 232582657 - 1 with 9,808,358 digits, M48 257,885,161-1 with 17,425,170 digits, and M49 274,207,281-1 with 22,338,618 digits.

<text>The 6th Day is a 2000 American science fiction action film directed by Roger Spottiswoode and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tony Goldwyn, Michael Rapaport, Michael Rooker, Sarah Wynter, and Robert Duvall. In the film, a family man of the future is illegally cloned by accident as part of a vast conspiracy involving a shady billionaire businessman, and is thrust into a struggle to clear his name and protect his family from the conspirators who seek to keep the cloning a secret. The title refers to the Genesis creation narrative shared among the Abrahamic religions, where God created humanity on the sixth day of the universe&#x27;s existence. The film was Terry Crews&#x27; first acting appearance.

Schwarzenegger received a salary of $25 million for his role in the film. The film received mixed reviews and was a box office failure, earning $96 million worldwide on a budget of $82 million.

==Plot==
Following the successful cloning of Dolly the sheep in the 1990s, artificial cloning of animals has become commonplace by 2015. Human cloning is prohibited by &quot;Sixth Day&quot; laws, following a botched attempt.

Charter pilot Adam Gibson is hired for a snowboarding excursion by Michael Drucker, billionaire owner of cloning corporation Replacement Technologies, who requires him to undergo a seemingly routine drug test. When Adam’s wife informs him that their daughter’s dog has died, he reluctantly visits one of Drucker’s “RePet” cloning stores, while his partner Hank poses as Adam and flies Drucker to the mountains, where they are killed by an assassin, Tripp.

Buying a life-size animatronic “SimPal” doll for his daughter instead, Adam returns home to discover a clone of himself with his family. Before he can intervene, Adam is abducted by Marshall, Drucker’s head of security, and his agents Talia, Vincent, and Wiley. Adam escapes, killing Talia and Wiley, and goes to the police but is believed to be an escaped mental patient.

Drucker, somehow alive, assures reporters that he does not intend to have the Sixth Day laws repealed. However, he and his chief scientist, Dr. Griffin Weir, have secretly already perfected illegal human cloning, and revive clones of Talia and Wiley. Adam breaks out of the police station and is forced to kill Wiley again, before finding Hank at his apartment, still alive. He brings Hank to his house and contemplates killing his clone, but has second thoughts and reconsiders. Marshall and Talia arrive, forcing Adam to pose as his clone to send them away.

Returning to his apartment, Hank is again killed by Tripp, who is shot by Adam. A dying Tripp reveals he is an anti-cloning extremist who assassinated Drucker, the latter being subsequently cloned along with Hank. Marshall and Talia arrive, but Adam escapes in their vehicle after shooting off Talia’s fingers, taking her thumb to bypass the car’s biometric lock. Adam uses the thumb to sneak into Replacement Technologies and confronts Dr. Weir, whose pursuit of cloning is driven by his wife Katherine’s cystic fibrosis she reveals to her husband that she knows she is the latest in a series of clones he has made in an attempt to cure her.

Weir explains that the blood and vision tests Adam underwent scanned his DNA and memories — captured as a “syncording” — in the event he needed to be cloned. He reveals Drucker was secretly cloned after dying years earlier to maintain control of his fortune, as clones have no legal rights. Believing both Adam and Hank were killed alongside Drucker, Weir cloned them to return to their lives and cover up Drucker’s murder and second cloning. Weir gives Adam the syncording proving Drucker has been cloned, warning that he may go after Adam’s clone and family.

Adam races to Clara’s school recital, where Talia and Vincent have already abducted his wife and daughter. Coming face-to-face with his own clone, Adam reveals their situation, and agrees to deliver the incriminating syncording to Drucker in exchange for his family. Weir confronts Drucker, who engineered the clones, including Katherine, with shortened lifespans as an insurance policy against betrayal. Drucker kills Weir, promising to resurrect him and Katherine as clones.

Sending a decoy helicopter to be destroyed, Adam lands on Drucker’s helipad and wreaks havoc until he is captured. Drucker reveals that Adam is actually the clone, proven by a marking inside his eyelid, but realizes the real Adam has also infiltrated the building. While the original Adam rescues his family, his clone fights off Drucker’s agents. They are finally killed, and a mortally wounded Drucker clones himself again, but the malfunctioning equipment creates a deformed, incomplete body. Adam and his clone escape in the helicopter with his family, destroying the facility and all its syncordings as Drucker falls to his death.

The real Adam arranges for his clone, who is discovered to not have a shortened lifespan like the other clones, to start a new life in Argentina, running a satellite office of their charter business. As a parting gift, the clone gives the family Hank&#x27;s RePet cat, and the real Adam gives his clone a flying send-off.

==Production==
Joe Dante was initially attached to direct the film, before Arnold Schwarzenegger signed on to star.

&quot;The 6th Day&quot; was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;The 6th Day&quot; premiered at the Tokyo International Film Festival. It was released theatrically on November 17, 2000.

===Home media===
&quot;The 6th Day&quot; was released on VHS and DVD in the United States and Canada on March 27, 2001. The movie was released on video on the following dates:

A Blu-ray version was released in the United States and Canada on April 8, 2008. It includes two featurettes but lacks the commentary from the DVD release.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at #4 and grossed $13 million in its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $34 million in North America and $96 million worldwide, while &quot;Variety&quot; reports $116 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 40% based on reviews from 117 critics, with a rating of 5.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;This offering from Arnold Schwarzenegger contains an intriguing, disturbing premise, but the film&#x27;s execution is too routine and formulaic to make good use of it.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 49 out of 100 based on reviews from 30 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;The 6th Day&quot; three out of four stars, remarking that it is not in the same league as &quot;Total Recall&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, but that it nevertheless qualifies as a serious science fiction film. He also found problems with the cloning as depicted in the film, saying that &quot;[his] problem with both processes is that while the resulting clone ... might know everything I know ... I myself would still be over here in the old container.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; disliked the generic appearance of the film and Schwarzenegger&#x27;s typecasting as an action hero. He gave the film two out of five stars. Todd McCarthy of Variety called it: &quot;A mostly standard-issue latter-day Arnold Schwarzenegger actioner spiked with a creepily plausible cloning angle.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;The 6th Day&quot; earned three Razzie Award nominations for Schwarzenegger: Worst Actor (as the real Adam), Worst Supporting Actor (as the clone of Adam) and Worst Screen Couple (Schwarzenegger as Adam and Schwarzenegger as the clone), but lost all three to &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;. The film was also nominated four times at the 27th Saturn Awards, but lost to &quot;X-Men&quot; for Best Actor and Best Science Fiction Film, &quot;Hollow Man&quot; for Best Special Effects and &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; for Best Make-Up.

<doc id="798502" wikidata="Q3351976" url="?curid=798502" title="Omega Psi Phi">
<text>Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. () is a historically African-American collegiate fraternity. It was founded on November 17, 1911 at Howard University. Omega Psi Phi is a founding member of the National Pan-Hellenic Council. The fraternity has chartered over 750 undergraduate and graduate chapters. Over 250,000 men have been initiated into Omega Psi Phi.

==History==
Omega Psi Phi fraternity was founded on November 17, 1911, the first at a historically black university, by three Howard University students, Edgar Amos Love, Oscar James Cooper and Frank Coleman, and their faculty adviser, Dr. Ernest Everett Just. Its purpose was &quot;to attract and build a strong and effective force of Handsome men dedicated to its Cardinal Principles of manhood, scholarship, , and uplift&quot;.

The fraternity was incorporated under the laws of Washington, D.C., on October 28, 1914. In 1924, at the urging of fraternity member Carter G. Woodson, the fraternity launched &quot;Negro History and Literature Week&quot; to publicize the growing body of scholarship on African-American history. Encouraged by public interest, the event was renamed &quot;Negro Achievement Week&quot; in 1925 and given an expanded national presence in 1926 by Woodson&#x27;s Association for the Study of Negro Life and History as &quot;Negro History Week.&quot; Expanded to the full month of February from 1976, this event continues today as &quot;Black History Month&quot;.

In 1930, Omega Psi Phi became one of 5 founding members of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC). Today, the NPHC is composed of nine international black Greek-letter sororities and fraternities and promotes interaction through forums, meetings, and other mediums for the exchange of information, and engages in cooperative programming and initiatives through various activities and functions.

Since 1945, the fraternity has undertaken a National Social Action Program to meet the needs of African Americans in the areas of health, housing, civil rights, and education. Omega Psi Phi has been a patron of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) since 1955, providing an annual gift of $50,000.00 to the program.

Omega Psi Phi celebrated its centennial during the week of July 27–31, 2011, in Washington, D.C., becoming distinguished as only the third African American collegiate fraternity to reach the century mark.

As of 2024, it has more than 750 chapters. Over 250,000 men have been initiated into Omega Psi Phi throughout the United States, Bermuda, Bahamas, Virgin Islands, South Korea, Japan, Liberia, Germany, and Kuwait. Its headquarters are in Decatur, Georgia.

== Symbols and traditions ==
Omega Psi Phi&#x27;s Cardinal Principles or pillars are Manhood, Scholarship, Perseverance, and Uplift. Its motto is &quot;Friendship is Essential to the Soul&quot;. The fraternity&#x27;s colors are royal purple and old gold. Its symbol is the lamp. Members are called Omegas and Omega Men.

The fraternity&#x27;s publications are &quot;Oracle&quot; and &quot;Clarion Call&quot;.

Like many fraternal organizations, Omega Psi Phi has a rich tradition of practices. While some traditions are secret, many are freely expressed in public. One is the practice of members voluntarily undergoing branding of the letters, or variations and designs based on them (such as two linked Omega symbols), on their skin. The brands often are displayed in public as a matter of pride; some prospects first learn of the fraternity by seeing members bearing brands. Another unofficial tradition is use of the term Que Dog. However, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. &quot;prohibits the promotion of our brand with the affiliation of alcohol; tobacco; references to hazing or items that can be associated with a culture of hazing; items that include any to canine or other animal references.

== International programs ==

Each chapter administers internationally mandated programs every year:

*Achievement Week – A week in November that seeks to recognize individuals who have made notable contributions to society. During the Achievement Week, a High School Essay Contest is held and the winner usually receives a scholarship award.
*Scholarship – The Charles R. Drew Scholarship Program encourages academic progress among the organization&#x27;s undergraduate members. A portion of the fraternity&#x27;s budget is designated for the Charles R. Drew Scholarship Commission, which awards scholarships to members and non-members.
*Social Action Programs – All chapters are required to participate in programs that uplift their society. Many participate in activities like voter registration, illiteracy programs, mentoring programs, fundraisers, and charitable organizations such as American Diabetes Association, United Way, and the Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation.
*Talent Hunt Program – Each chapter is required to hold a yearly talent contest, to encourage young people to expose themselves to the Performing Arts. Individuals who win these talent contests receive an award, such as a scholarship.
*Memorial Service – March 12 is Omega Psi Phi Memorial Day. Every chapter of the fraternity performs a ritualistic memorial service to remember members who have died.
*Reclamation and Retention – This program is an effort to encourage inactive members to become fully active and participate in the fraternity&#x27;s programs.
*College Endowment Funds – The fraternity donates thousands of dollars to Historically Black Colleges and Universities each year.
*Health Initiatives – Chapters are required to coordinate programs that will encourage good health practices. Programs that members involve themselves in include HIV/AIDS awareness, blood drives, prostate cancer awareness, and sickle cell anemia awareness programs.
*Voter Registration, Education and Mobilization – Coordination activities that promote voter registration and mobilization.

*NAACP – A Life Membership at Large in the NAACP is required by all chapters and districts.

==Membership==
Omega Psi Phi recognizes undergraduate and graduate membership. College students must be working toward a bachelor&#x27;s degree at a four-year institution, have at least 31 semester credits, and maintain at least a 2.5 grade point average. For the graduate chapter, an applicant must already possess a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The fraternity grants honorary membership to men who have positively contributed to society on a national or international level. For example, Charles Young (March 12, 1864 – January 8, 1922) was the third African American graduate of West Point, the first black U.S. national park superintendent, the first African American military attaché, and the highest ranking black officer (Colonel) in the United States Army until he died in 1922.

<text>Scotsport is a Scottish sports television programme, broadcast on STV in northern and central Scotland between 1957 and 2008, as well as on ITV Border in southern Scotland.

It was first broadcast in 1957 as &quot;Sports Desk&quot; and continued until the end of its weekly football highlights show in May 2008.

==History==
Launching less than a month after the opening of Scottish Television, the programme first aired on 18 September 1957, as &quot;Sports Desk&quot;. The &quot;Scotsport&quot; title was adopted a short time later, and the vast majority of its coverage was of football, rather than sport in general, as the name might imply. The football coverage, in turn, concentrated mostly on Scottish Premier League clubs. The show also followed Scottish clubs in the UEFA Champions League via live matches and highlights programmes. &quot;Scotsport&quot;&#x27;s main rival was the long-running BBC Scotland strand &quot;Sportscene&quot;, which continues to broadcast to this day.

Prior to the 2007–08 season, &quot;Scotsport&quot; faced competition for viewers of its SPL coverage. On 18 July 2007, it was announced that the SPL had signed a similar deal with BBC Scotland for non-exclusive television coverage of the league. This did not affect &quot;Scotsport&#x27;s&quot; production, although the programme lost ratings. &quot;Scotsport&quot; continued in its hour-long Monday night slot at 10.40pm for the remainder of the 2007–08 season, with &quot;Sportscene&#x27;s&quot; SPL highlight airing later in the week on Wednesdays at 10pm on BBC Two Scotland.

On Hogmanay 2007, STV broadcast &quot;50 Years of Scotsport&quot;, a programme taking a look back at the shows best moments over the 50 years it had been on air. Featuring colleagues from past and present, one of the show&#x27;s most recent presenters, Grant Stott presented the Hogmanay special. A month before the anniversary programme aired, STV decided to axe &quot;Scotsport&quot;, after BBC Scotland won a five-year deal to show SPL highlights. The programme aired for the last time on Thursday 22 May 2008.

A smaller-scale sports magazine show, &quot;STV Sports Centre&quot;, was launched on Friday 5 March 2010 but it was axed fifteen months later.

==Presenters==
Despite being one of the world&#x27;s longest-running sports television programmes, there were only five main anchors in its 51 years on air, largely due to the 32-year tenure of Arthur Montford, who retired in May 1989. Montford was succeeded by Jim White (now with Sky Sports), Jim Delahunt, and finally, the pairing of Grant Stott and Andy Walker, who also anchored STV&#x27;s &quot;Champions League&quot; coverage.

Other key members of the &quot;Scotsport&quot; on-air team during its run included the likes of Bob Crampsey, Jock Brown, and Gerry McNee.

In 1982, Sally McNair joined the show and become the first female TV sports journalist in Scotland. Six years later, Hazel Irvine (who joined Scottish Television as a continuity announcer) became co-presenter of the Friday night preview show, &quot;Extra Time&quot; - she defected to the rival &quot;Sportscene&quot; programme in 1990.

A controversial revamp of the SPL highlights show in 2004 saw the arrival of Sarah O&#x27;Flaherty (known as &quot;Sarah O&quot;) and Julyan Sinclair, who co-anchored &quot;Scotsport SPL&quot; on Monday nights for two seasons.

In its latterday run, match commentators included Archie Macpherson (former &quot;Sportscene&quot; presenter), Jock Brown, Ian Crocker, Rob MacLean, Ken McRobb and David McKinney.

==Spin-off shows==
* &quot;Scotsport Results&quot; launched on 7 September 1957 and was broadcast on Saturday teatimes at around 5pm during the football season. It was presented by &quot;Arthur Montford&quot;, and latterly, &quot;Jim White&quot; until the end of the 1992/93 football season in May 1993.
* &quot;World of Sport from Scotland&quot; (billed as Scotsport Special) was broadcast as a occasional opt out from the network version of &quot;World of Sport&quot; on Saturday afternoons throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, it was presented by &quot;Arthur Montford&quot; and largely featured live and highlights coverage of Scottish sporting events incorporated with the network sporting events.
* &quot;Junior Scotsport&quot; was a short-lived feature series for children, which aired on alternate Wednesday evenings from 8 July to 5 August 1959 (6.35–7.05pm).
* From 1979 to 1984, a short preview programme called &quot;Sport Extra&quot; aired on Friday evenings at 6.25pm, following &quot;Scotland Today&quot;.
* Between the 1988–89 and 1999–2000 seasons, &quot;Scotsport Extra Time&quot; (later renamed simply &quot;Extra Time&quot; from 8 January 1994) aired mostly on Friday nights starting on 28 October 1988 at 10.35pm lasting until 17 December 1993 moving to Saturday lunchtimes at 12:30pm from 8 January 1994 until 11 May 1996 and then moving to Friday nights at 7:00pm at the beginning of the new season on 10 August 1996 and featured previews of the weekend&#x27;s fixtures, interviews and other sports including ice hockey, rugby, snooker and golf. Jim White presented the programme - alongside Hazel Irvine for the first two seasons - until his move to Sky in 1998 with his last programme on 10 May. Jim Delahunt took over with the programme starting with the final Friday night series on 31 July 1998 starting off at 6:00pm before moving back to its original timeslot of 7:00pm from 13 November, The last Friday night show was broadcast on 21 May 1999 before moving to Saturday lunchtime for the second time from 31 July 1999 until 9 December 2000. Grampian Television also aired the series from 2 January 1998 along with sister station Sky Scottish from launch on 1 November 1996 until 8 May 1998 three weeks before the station&#x27;s closure.
* During the seasons when Scottish Television owned the rights to Scotland&#x27;s premier rugby league, live matches and highlights were shown under the Scotsport Rugby Roundup banner commencing on 14 January 2001 continuing until 16 May 2004. Kathleen Wood, Jim Delahunt, Jim Hay and Richie Gray presented the programme.
* During the seasons where STV had the highlights rights for both the Scottish Premier League and the First Division, &quot;Scotsport&quot; was divided into two programmes. &quot;Scotsport First&quot; aired on Sunday mornings and retained a traditional highlights format, while &quot;Scotsport SPL&quot;, was revamped as a magazine show on Monday nights, featuring three presenters, a live studio audience and more emphasis on features over match highlights. The Monday night show was heavily criticised by viewers and latterly returned to a more traditional format for the 2006–7 season.
* &quot;Scotsport Fanzone&quot; aired during the latter half of the 2005–06 season on Thursday nights, taking in a forum format encouraging Scottish football fans to have their say on the week&#x27;s news.
*&quot;Scotsport Rugby Sunday&quot; was a short-lived spin-off, specifically focused on rugby union in Scotland. Richie Gray presented the series, featuring news and highlights, including coverage of Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors, lower league club rugby and women&#x27;s games.
*&quot;STV Rugby&quot;, an hour-long Celtic League highlights show was launched in September 2009, and continued on and off until the end of the 2011–2012 season, marking the end of regular Scottish sports programming produced by STV.

<doc id="798527" wikidata="Q1040321" url="?curid=798527" title="Peak ground acceleration">
<text>Peak ground acceleration (PGA) is equal to the maximum ground acceleration that occurred during earthquake shaking at a location. PGA is equal to the amplitude of the largest absolute acceleration recorded on an at a site during a particular earthquake. Earthquake shaking generally occurs in all three directions. Therefore, PGA is often split into the horizontal and vertical components. Horizontal PGAs are generally larger than those in the vertical direction but this is not always true, especially close to large earthquakes. PGA is an important parameter (also known as an intensity measure) for earthquake engineering, The design basis earthquake ground motion (DBEGM) is often defined in terms of PGA.

Unlike the Richter and moment magnitude scales, it is not a measure of the total energy (magnitude, or size) of an earthquake, but rather of how much the earth shakes at a given geographic point. The Mercalli intensity scale uses personal reports and observations to measure earthquake intensity but PGA is measured by instruments, such as accelerographs. It can be correlated to macroseismic intensities on the Mercalli scale but these correlations are associated with large uncertainty.

The peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) is the most commonly used type of ground acceleration in engineering applications. It is often used within earthquake engineering (including seismic building codes) and it is commonly plotted on seismic hazard maps. In an earthquake, damage to buildings and infrastructure is related more closely to ground motion, of which PGA is a measure, rather than the magnitude of the earthquake itself. For moderate earthquakes, PGA is a reasonably good determinant of damage; in severe earthquakes, damage is more often correlated with peak ground velocity.

==Geophysics==
Earthquake energy is dispersed in waves from the hypocentre, causing ground movement omnidirectionally but typically modelled horizontally (in two directions) and vertically. PGA records the acceleration (rate of change of speed) of these movements, while peak ground velocity is the greatest speed (rate of movement) reached by the ground, and peak displacement is the distance moved. These values vary in different earthquakes, and in differing sites within one earthquake event, depending on a number of factors. These include the length of the fault, magnitude, the depth of the quake, the distance from the epicentre, the duration (length of the shake cycle), and the geology of the ground (subsurface). Shallow-focused earthquakes generate stronger shaking (acceleration) than intermediate and deep quakes, since the energy is released closer to the surface.

Peak ground acceleration can be expressed in fractions of &quot;g&quot; (the standard acceleration due to Earth&#x27;s gravity, equivalent to g-force) as either a decimal or percentage; in m/s2 (1 &quot;g&quot; = 9.81 m/s2); or in multiples of Gal, where 1 Gal is equal to 0.01 m/s (1 &quot;g&quot; = 981 Gal).

The ground type can significantly influence ground acceleration, so PGA values can display extreme variability over distances of a few kilometers, particularly with moderate to large earthquakes. The varying PGA results from an earthquake can be displayed on a shake map.
Due to the complex conditions affecting PGA, earthquakes of similar magnitude can offer disparate results, with many moderate magnitude earthquakes generating significantly larger PGA values than larger magnitude quakes.

During an earthquake, ground acceleration is measured in three directions: vertically (V or UD, for up-down) and two perpendicular horizontal directions (H1 and H2), often north–south (NS) and east–west (EW). The peak acceleration in each of these directions is recorded, with the highest individual value often reported. Alternatively, a combined value for a given station can be noted. The peak horizontal ground acceleration (PHA or PHGA) can be reached by selecting the higher individual recording, taking the mean of the two values, or calculating a vector sum of the two components. A three-component value can also be reached, by taking the vertical component into consideration also.

In seismic engineering, the effective peak acceleration (EPA, the maximum ground acceleration to which a building responds) is often used, which tends to be ⅔ – ¾ the PGA.

==Seismic risk and engineering==
Study of geographic areas combined with an assessment of historical earthquakes allows geologists to determine seismic risk and to create seismic hazard maps, which show the likely PGA values to be experienced in a region during an earthquake, with a probability of exceedance (PE). Seismic engineers and government planning departments use these values to determine the appropriate earthquake loading for buildings in each zone, with key identified structures (such as hospitals, bridges, power plants) needing to survive the maximum considered earthquake (MCE).

Damage to buildings is related to both peak ground velocity (PGV) and the duration of the earthquake – the longer high-level shaking persists, the greater the likelihood of damage.

==Comparison of instrumental and felt intensity==
Peak ground acceleration provides a measurement of &quot;instrumental intensity&quot;, that is, ground shaking recorded by seismic instruments. Other intensity scales measure &quot;felt intensity&quot;, based on eyewitness reports, felt shaking, and observed damage. There is correlation between these scales, but not always absolute agreement since experiences and damage can be affected by many other factors, including the quality of earthquake engineering.

Generally speaking,
* 0.001 &quot;g&quot; (0.01 m/s) – perceptible by people
* 0.02  &quot;g&quot; (0.2  m/s) – people lose their balance
* 0.50  &quot;g&quot; (5  m/s) – very high; well-designed buildings can survive if the duration is short.

===Correlation with the Mercalli scale===
The United States Geological Survey developed an Instrumental Intensity scale, which maps peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity on an intensity scale similar to the felt Mercalli scale. These values are used to create shake maps by seismologists around the world.

===Other intensity scales===
In the 7-class Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the highest intensity, Shindo 7, covers accelerations greater than 4 m/s (0.41 &quot;g&quot;).

==PGA hazard risks worldwide==
In India, areas with expected PGA values higher than 0.36 &quot;g&quot; are classed as &quot;Zone 5&quot;, or &quot;Very High Damage Risk Zone&quot;.

<doc id="798536" wikidata="Q2354920" url="?curid=798536" title="M-168 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-168 was one of the shortest state trunkline highways in the US state of Michigan, extending just under a mile (1.6 km) from a junction with M-22 in downtown Elberta to the former Ann Arbor Railroad ferry docks. It followed the south shore of Lake Betsie (formed by the Betsie River before flowing into Lake Michigan). The highway was commissioned in 1931 and served as a connection to the car ferries until 1984. The road was reconstructed by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in preparation to transfer it to village control. That transfer happened on April 24, 2012, and now the former highway is a village street.

== Route description ==
M-168 began at a junction with M-22 just west of where M-22 crosses over Lake Betsie. Known as Frankfort Avenue, M-168 then traveled to the northwest near the shore of the lake through a mixed residential and commercial area before turning slightly westward onto Furnace Avenue. Along Furnace Avenue, the roadway is lined with homes on one side and lake frontage on the other. Eventually, the road curves to the west where it intersects Betsie Valley Trail coming to its terminus shortly thereafter at the former Ann Arbor Railroad ferry docks.

== History ==
M-168 had existed in its current location since 1931. It was originally assumed into the state trunkline system at in length. Aside from a minor realignment of the junction with M-22 in 1987, the route had remained in this configuration since 1931. From its creation until 1984, the road was the main entrance for cars bound for boarding the car ferry.

An MDOT document indicated that in 2010, a $2.1 million project would reconstruct M-168. Upon completion of the project, the route would be jurisdictionally transferred to the Village of Elberta, thereby removing M-168 from the state trunkline system. This transfer was finalized on April 24, 2012, and afterwards, the former M-168 was reclassified a village street.

<text>The Dardo was a small two-seater sports car manufactured in Brazil between 1979 and 1985.

Fiat&#x27;s Brazilian endorsed its production but also offered distribution, technical assistance and a factory warranty.

With the same powertrain as the 147 Rallye, the Dardo was created by Toni Bianco for Corona S. S. Viatura e Equipamento of Diadema, São Paulo. The company was a subsidiary of Caloi – a Brazilian bicycle manufacturer.

Total production amounted to 300 cars.

<doc id="798543" wikidata="Q3109600" url="?curid=798543" title="Motor Trend">
<text>Motor Trend is an American automobile magazine. It first appeared in September 1949, and designated the first Car of the Year, also in 1949.

Petersen Publishing Company in Los Angeles published &quot;Motor Trend&quot; until 1998, when it was sold to British publisher EMAP, who then sold the former Petersen magazines to Primedia in 2001. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; bears the tagline &quot;The Magazine for a Motoring World&quot;. As of 2024 it is published by Motor Trend Group. It has a monthly circulation of over one million.

Publication was monthly but changed to quarterly in 2024.

In December 2024, Hearst Communications acquired Motor Trend Group and most its assets including &quot;Motor Trend&quot; from Warner Bros. Discovery.

==Contents and sections==
The contents of &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazines are divided up into sections, or departments.

===Road tests===
&quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine provides its readers with written &quot;road tests&quot; of vehicles. These road tests are published in each issue and are meant to give readers information about the featured vehicle, certain aspects of the vehicle, and what the readers can expect if the featured vehicle is purchased.

===Vehicle comparisons===
There are two main types of &quot;Motor Trend&quot; vehicle comparisons. Regular comparisons usually compare two to three vehicles, looking at what each is like to own, drive, etc. On &quot;Motor Trend&quot;&#x27;s YouTube channel (titled &quot;MotorTrend Channel&quot;), &quot;Motor Trend&quot; puts up their best comparison of the month on a series called &quot;Head 2 Head,&quot; featuring &quot;MotorTrend&quot; editors comparing cars on YouTube. 

&quot;Big Test&quot; comparisons typically feature anywhere from five to seven vehicles, all being compared against each other. In a way, a vehicle comparison is like a large road test featuring many vehicles, rather than just one.

===The Trend===
&quot;The Trend&quot; provides readers with the latest what&#x27;s happening in the automotive industry. This section may feature news about manufacturers, recalls, etc. &quot;Newcomers&quot; (recently redesigned or all-new models), along with short informative articles about them, can also be found in this section.

===&quot;MotorTrend&quot; Garage===
&quot;Motor Trend&quot; keeps a fleet of long-term test cars at their headquarters in Los Angeles, California. The majority of the &quot;Motor Trend&quot; editors are each assigned a car, and their duty is to drive that car on a daily basis and report on what&#x27;s happening. Each month, one to two new vehicles are added to the fleet, to replace the one to two vehicles leaving the fleet. Each long-term test lasts approximately one calendar year. Not every vehicle receives a printed update each month, though the vehicles are still there. This section is typically located towards the end of the magazine.

===Other features===
Other types of articles are sometimes featured in the &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine. There is typically one special feature per month. For example, in one issue of the magazine, there may be a special feature about &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s &quot;Real MPG&quot; testing. For these tests, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; measures the &quot;real-world&quot; fuel economy of a vehicle in a number of conditions, and then compares their results to the EPA estimated fuel economy that manufacturers provide dealerships, who then provide it to their customers.

==&quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year==

One of the earliest and most enduring of the magazine&#x27;s creations was its Car of the Year award, given almost continuously since 1949, although the phrase itself would not become entrenched until well into the 1950s. It predates the European Car of the Year award begun in 1964.

The first winner was the 1949 Cadillac, which featured an innovative overhead valve V8 engine; while the company initially turned down the award from the brand new magazine, it now proudly references its COTY wins in publicity materials. The award has gone through several splits and permutations over the years, being called the &quot;Golden Wheels Award&quot; for a while in the 1970s and having given rise to Truck of the Year and Import Car of the Year, as well as SUV of the Year. Nevertheless, it is still coveted by manufacturers and is usually covered by the mainstream press as the most important distinction awarded in the American auto industry.

==New car guides==
The magazine releases a special edition every September and October listing the latest new 
vehicles. The September issue looks at the latest cars (sedans, coupes, etc.) for the next coming calendar year, whilst in October the magazine looks at off-roaders, MPVs and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).

==Offshoots==

===&quot;Truck Trend&quot;===
&quot;Truck Trend&quot; magazine presented features and the latest news about the truck, SUV, and crossover segments. Additionally, the Readers&#x27; Rides section allowed readers to post images and information about their own vehicles. &quot;Truck Trend&quot; began in 1995 as &quot;Truck Trends,&quot; a section of Motor Trend itself. It became the stand-alone publication &quot;Truck Trend&quot; in 1997. &quot;Truck Trend&quot; magazine ceased production in December 2019, as one of the nineteen magazines that Motor Trend Group ceased publication during that month.

===&quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot;===
&quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; included articles about significant classic cars from around the world made during the last 60 years. A total of 23 issues were produced. The first run was eight issues: two undated issues in 2005, and six additional bimonthly issues in 2006. Several years later the title was relaunched, and that second run was fifteen issues: quarterly from Spring 2010 through Spring 2013, then a combined Spring/Fall 2013 issue, with the final Summer 2014 issue appearing a year later. 

===Motor Trend On Demand===
&quot;Motor Trend On Demand&quot; is an online television service. It features television series from &quot;Motor Trend&quot;, &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot;, &quot;Hot Rod&quot;, &quot;Super Street&quot; and &quot;Four Wheeler&quot;, such as &quot;Roadkill&quot;. In 2015, TEN bought Torque.TV and integrated it into the service, adding coverage of motorsports competitions such as Blancpain GT Series, Pirelli World Challenge, Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, V8 Supercars, British Touring Car Championship, TCR International Series, FIA European Formula 3 Championship, European Le Mans Series, Australasian Safari, Motoamerica, Endurance FIM World Championship, Motocross World Championship, AMA EnduroCross Championship, and FIM SuperEnduro World Championship.

=== Motor Trend Network ===

In April 2018, following the acquisition of a majority stake in TEN by Discovery Communications, it was announced that its U.S. cable channel Velocity would rebrand as Motor Trend Network later in the year.

====Italy====

In Italy, the channel Motor Trend began broadcasting on April 29, 2018 at 6:00 am with the Car Crash TV in place of Focus, whose brand has meanwhile passed into the hands of Mediaset.

==Used car warranty==
In 2009, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; introduced a certified used car program, beginning with dealers in Atlanta, Georgia and Cincinnati, Ohio. As explained in their press release, the program is powered by EasyCare.

<doc id="798551" wikidata="Q1272560" url="?curid=798551" title="Daily Kos">
<text>Daily Kos ( ) is a group blog and internet forum focused on the U.S. Democratic Party and progressive liberal American politics. The site publishes blog posts, polls, election and campaign fundraising data, and is considered an example of &quot;netroots&quot; activism.

Daily Kos was founded in 2002 by Markos Moulitsas and takes the name &quot;Kos&quot; from the last syllable of his first name, his nickname while in the military.

== History ==

Daily Kos was founded in May 2002 by Markos Moulitsas in Berkeley, California.

The Daily Kos is funded by advertising, fundraising, and donations.

As of September 2014, Daily Kos has had an average weekday traffic of hundreds of thousands.

In 2008, &quot;Time&quot; magazine readers named Daily Kos the second best blog. In 2009, &quot;Time&quot; listed Daily Kos in its &quot;Most Overrated Blogs&quot; section due to the loss of its mission, fighting the &quot;oppressive and war-crazed&quot; Republican administration, during Democrat Barack Obama&#x27;s presidency. The website ran on the Scoop content management system until 2011 when it moved to its own custom content management system referred to as &quot;DK 4.0&quot;. In 2016 and 2017, the Trump presidency brought out huge support for the blog, with more than half a million in direct donations being received from their email campaigns.

In 2015, Cartoonist Dan Perkins was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Editorial Cartooning as Tom Tomorrow of Daily Kos.

In 2018, the Daily Kos launched Civiqs, a division of the blog that provides political polling data from volunteer participants.

In an October 2018 Simmons Research survey of 38 news organizations, the Daily Kos was ranked the fifth least trusted news organization by Americans in a tie with &quot;Breitbart News&quot;, with the &quot;Palmer Report&quot;, Occupy Democrats, &quot;InfoWars&quot; and &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; being lower-ranked.

In 2019 &quot;Prism&quot;, an independent, non-profit publication focused on covering injustice from the perspective of underrepresented groups, became an affiliate publication of the Daily Kos.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Daily Kos owner Kos Media LLC received $1.4 million in federally backed small business loans from Newtek Small Business Finance as part of the Paycheck Protection Program.

Daily Kos has been classified as left-leaning and far-left.

In 2023, Daily Kos received a PEN Oakland/Adelle Foley Award.

== Polling ==
Daily Kos had previously partnered with Research 2000 to produce polling for presidential, congressional and gubernatorial races across the country. In June 2010, Daily Kos terminated the relationship after finding that the data showed statistical anomalies consistent with deliberate falsification and announced its intention to sue the polling firm.

On November 30, 2010, an agreement to a settlement began as lawyers for the Plaintiff filed a status report indicating that both parties were &quot;in agreement as to the contours of a proper settlement but are still in the process of determining whether the execution of the proposed terms is feasible&quot;. In May 2011, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; reported that Research 2000 pollster Del Ali agreed to settle the lawsuit and make payments to Daily Kos.

The Daily Kos Elections tracked redistricting in the United States, forecasted Electoral College results, and provided polling data for elections.

== YearlyKos convention ==

In June 2006, members of Daily Kos organized the first ever Daily Kos political blogger convention, called YearlyKos, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The event was attended by approximately 1000 bloggers, and featured appearances by prominent Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, California Senator Barbara Boxer, General Wesley Clark, Governors Mark Warner, Bill Richardson, Tom Vilsack and DNC Chair Howard Dean. The event was widely covered in the traditional media, including &quot;Capitol Hill Blue&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and MSNBC. C-SPAN also carried portions of the convention.

== Political activity ==
In addition to being a blogging, news, and digital media platform, Daily Kos is a political organization. For instance, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that James Thompson, the April 2017 Democratic candidate for the vacant House seat from , &quot;was helped by nearly $150,000 from Daily Kos, ... and some more modest contributions from a group aligned with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont&quot;. OpenSecrets reported that &quot;the liberal Daily Kos endorsed Thompson and sent out a fundraising plea, which has so far garnered $178,000 in donations, according to its fundraising page.&quot;

Daily Kos has endorsed notable Democratic candidates in state and national races, including Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and candidate Jon Ossoff, who ran for in its 2017 special election. Ossoff received more than $1 million raised on Daily Kos.

In 2004, the site launched the dKosopedia. It was a wiki, using the MediaWiki software, and described as &quot;a political encyclopedia ... written from a left/progressive/liberal/Democratic point of view while also attempting to fairly acknowledge the other side&#x27;s take&quot;. It grew to more than 14,000 articles but has since been discontinued.

The site has also participated in mass digital campaigns to elected officials over ActionNetwork.org with prominent organizational partners including Saphron Initiative, Futures PAC, Democracy for America&#x27;s Advocacy Fund, and More Perfect Union.

<text>Horatio William Parker (September 15, 1863 – December 18, 1919) was an American composer, organist and teacher. He was a central figure in musical life in New Haven, Connecticut in the late 19th century, and is best remembered as the undergraduate teacher of Charles Ives while the composer attended Yale University.

==Biography==
He was born in Auburndale, Massachusetts. His earliest lessons were with his mother. He then studied in Boston with George Whitefield Chadwick, Stephen A. Emery, and John Orth. His first professional position was playing the organ at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Dedham, Massachusetts. He was paid a salary of roughly $300 a year from September 1880 to January 1882.

He finished his formal education in Europe, a common destination for a young American composer in the 1880s, where he studied in Munich with Josef Rheinberger. His fellow students at the Royal Music School in Munich included Arthur Whiting and H. H. Huss. In Munich Parker composed his first significant works, including a symphony and a dramatic cantata. He also premiered Joseph Rheinberger&#x27;s Organ Concerto No. 1 in F Major from 1884 there.

After his return to the United States in 1885, he was for two years professor of music in the Cathedral School of St. Paul in Garden City, Long Island. From 1888 to 1893, he was organist of Trinity Church, New York City, and from 1893 to 1901 organist of Trinity Church, Boston. In 1893, Parker became Battell Professor of the theory of music at Yale University. He was appointed Dean of Music at that school in 1904, a position which he held for the rest of his life.

The University of Cambridge bestowed on him the honorary degree &quot;Doctor of Music&quot; (Mus.Doc.) in May 1902. He directed the Derby Choral Club, organized by Frances Osborne Kellogg in Derby, Connecticut, for 16 consecutive seasons until his death. On December 30, 1915, he was elected as a national honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity, the national fraternity for men in music. Parker died in Cedarhurst, New York. 

Parker was the uncle of Parker Bailey, who was an American composer, pianist, and lawyer. Bailey served for a time as a lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission having graduated from Yale in 1923 with majors in Greek and mathematics, but remained active as a composer for much of his life. He won the Joseph H Stearns prize at Columbia University in 1928 for his &quot;Sonata in A Flat Major for flute and piano&quot;.

==Composition==
Before leaving New York City in 1893, Parker had completed his oratorio, &quot;Hora Novissima&quot;, set to the opening words of &quot;De contemptu mundi&quot; by Bernard of Cluny. It was widely performed in America; and also in England, in 1899 at Chester, and at the Three Choirs Festival at Worcester, the latter an honour never before paid an American composer. European critics called it one of the finest of American compositions. While he is mostly remembered for this single work, he was a prolific and versatile composer in a mostly conservative Germanic tradition, writing two operas, songs, organ and incidental music, and a copious quantity of works for chorus and orchestra. Influences in his compositions include Mendelssohn, Brahms, Wagner, as well as Debussy and Elgar in some works which he composed closer to 1900. During his lifetime he was considered to be the finest composer in the United States, a superior craftsman writing in the most advanced style.

In 1892, Parker composed the hymn tune &quot;Auburndale&quot; in celebration of the laying of the cornerstone of the new church building of the Episcopal parish he was baptised in, Parish of the Messiah. His father, Charles Edward Parker, had been the architect for that congregation&#x27;s chapel; famed Episcopal bishop Phillips Brooks laid the cornerstone. &quot;Auburndale&quot; was later published in the 1916 Hymnal (&quot;The Messiah Miracle: A History The Church of the Messiah of West Newton and Auburndale 1871–1971,&quot; privately published, 1971).

Parker entered his opera, &quot;Mona&quot;, into a contest at the Metropolitan Opera winning the prize for best composition in 1911. He won 10,000 dollars and his opera was performed by the company. &quot;Mona&quot; premiered on March 14, 1912 and ran for four performances. The title role was taken by Louise Homer. He won the Los Angeles $10,000 prize for his opera &quot;Fairyland&quot;.

Parker&#x27;s music is used as Hymn #66 &quot;Rejoice the Lord is King&quot; in the hymnbook for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (with lyrics by Charles Wesley, 1707-1788). The hymn uses the JUBILATE tune and has been in the church&#x27;s hymnbook since 1948.

<doc id="798571" wikidata="Q3823926" url="?curid=798571" title="Rule of succession">
<text>In probability theory, the rule of succession is a formula introduced in the 18th century by Pierre-Simon Laplace in the course of treating the sunrise problem. The formula is still used, particularly to estimate underlying probabilities when there are few observations or events that have not been observed to occur at all in (finite) sample data.

==Statement of the rule of succession==
If we repeat an experiment that we know can result in a success or failure, &quot;n&quot; times independently, and get &quot;s&quot; successes, and &quot;n − s&quot; failures, then what is the probability that the next repetition will succeed?

More abstractly: If &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 are conditionally independent random variables that each can assume the value 0 or 1, then, if we know nothing more about them,

:formula_1

==Interpretation==
Since we have the prior knowledge that we are looking at an experiment for which both success and failure are possible, our estimate is as if we had observed one success and one failure for sure before we even started the experiments. In a sense we made &quot;n&quot; + 2 observations (known as pseudocounts) with &quot;s &quot;+ 1 successes. Although this may seem the simplest and most reasonable assumption, which also happens to be true, it still requires a proof. Indeed, assuming a pseudocount of one per possibility is one way to generalise the binary result, but has unexpected consequences — see Generalization to any number of possibilities, below.

Nevertheless, if we had not known from the start that both success and failure are possible, then we would have had to assign

:formula_2

But see Mathematical details, below, for an analysis of its validity. In particular it is not valid when formula_3, or formula_4.

If the number of observations increases, formula_5 and formula_6 get more and more similar, which is intuitively clear: the more data we have, the less importance should be assigned to our prior information.

==Historical application to the sunrise problem==
Laplace used the rule of succession to calculate the probability that the Sun will rise tomorrow, given that it has risen every day for the past 5000 years. One obtains a very large factor of approximately 5000 × 365.25, which gives odds of about 1,826,200 to 1 in favour of the Sun rising tomorrow.

However, as the mathematical details below show, the basic assumption for using the rule of succession would be that we have no prior knowledge about the question whether the Sun will or will not rise tomorrow, except that it can do either. This is not the case for sunrises.

Laplace knew this well, and he wrote to conclude the sunrise example: &quot;But this number is far greater for him who, seeing in the totality of phenomena the principle regulating the days and seasons, realizes that nothing at the present moment can arrest the course of it.&quot; Yet Laplace was ridiculed for this calculation; his opponents gave no heed to that sentence, or failed to understand its importance.

In the 1940s, Rudolf Carnap investigated a probability-based theory of inductive reasoning, and developed measures of degree of confirmation, which he considered as alternatives to Laplace&#x27;s rule of succession. See also New riddle of induction#Carnap.

== Intuition ==
The rule of succession can be interpreted in an intuitive manner by considering points randomly distributed on a circle rather than counting the number &quot;success&quot;/&quot;failures&quot; in an experiment. To mimic the behavior of the proportion &quot;p&quot; on the circle, we will color the circle in two colors and the fraction of the circle colored in the &quot;success&quot; color will be equal to &quot;p&quot;. To express the uncertainty about the value of &quot;p&quot;, we need to select a fraction of the circle. 

A fraction is chosen by selecting two uniformly random points on the circle. The first point &quot;Z&quot; corresponds to the zero in the [0, 1] interval and the second point &quot;P&quot; corresponds to &quot;p&quot; within [0, 1]. In terms of the circle the fraction of the circle from &quot;Z&quot; to &quot;P&quot; moving clockwise will be equal to &quot;p&quot;. The &quot;n&quot; trials can be interpreted as &quot;n&quot; points uniformly distributed on the circle; any point in the &quot;success&quot; fraction is a success and a failure otherwise. This provides an exact mapping from success/failure experiments with probability of success &quot;p&quot; to uniformly random points on the circle. In the figure the success fraction is colored blue to differentiate it from the rest of the circle and the points &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are highlighted in red.

Given this circle, the estimate of &quot;p&quot; is the fraction colored blue. Let us divide the circle into &quot;n+2&quot; arcs corresponding to the &quot;n+2&quot; points such that the portion from a point on the circle to the next point (moving clockwise) is one arc associated with the first point. Thus, &quot;Z&quot; defines the first blue arc while &quot;P&quot; defines the first non-blue/failure arc. Since the next point is a uniformly random point, if it falls in any of the blue arcs then the trial succeeds while if it falls in any of the other arcs, then it fails. So the probability of success &quot;p&quot; is formula_7 where &quot;b&quot; is the number of blue arcs and &quot;t&quot; is the total number of arcs. Note that there is one more blue arc (that of &quot;Z&quot;) than success point and two more arcs (those of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;) than &quot;n&quot; points. Substituting the values with number of successes gives the rule of succession.

&quot;Note: The actual probability needs to use the length of blue arcs divided by the length of all arcs. However, when k points are uniformly randomly distributed on a circle, the distance from a point to the next point is 1/k. So on average each arc is of the same length and ratio of lengths becomes ratio of counts.&quot;

==Mathematical details==
The proportion &quot;p&quot; is assigned a uniform distribution to describe the uncertainty about its true value. (This proportion is not random, but uncertain. We assign a probability distribution to &quot;p&quot; to express our uncertainty, not to attribute randomness to &quot;p&quot;. But this amounts, mathematically, to the same thing as treating &quot;p as if&quot; it were random).

Let &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; be 1 if we observe a &quot;success&quot; on the &quot;i&quot;th trial, otherwise 0, with probability &quot;p&quot; of success on each trial. Thus each &quot;X&quot; is 0 or 1; each &quot;X&quot; has a Bernoulli distribution. Suppose these &quot;X&quot;s are conditionally independent given &quot;p&quot;.

We can use Bayes&#x27; theorem to find the conditional probability distribution of &quot;p&quot; given the data &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;n.&quot; For the &quot;prior&quot; (i.e., marginal) probability measure of &quot;p&quot; we assigned a uniform distribution over the open interval &quot;(0,1)&quot;

:formula_8

For the likelihood of a given &quot;p&quot; under our observations, we use the likelihood function

:formula_9

where &quot;s&quot; = &quot;x&quot;1 + ... + &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the number of &quot;successes&quot; and &quot;n&quot; is the number of trials (we are using capital &quot;X&quot; to denote a random variable and lower-case &quot;x&quot; as the data actually observed). Putting it all together, we can calculate the posterior:

:formula_10

To get the normalizing constant, we find

:formula_11

(see beta function for more on integrals of this form).

The posterior probability density function is therefore

:formula_12

This is a beta distribution with expected value

::formula_13

Since &quot;p&quot; tells us the probability of success in any experiment, and each experiment is conditionally independent, the conditional probability for success in the next experiment is just &quot;p&quot;. As &quot;p&quot; is being treated as if it is a random variable, the law of total probability tells us that the expected probability of success in the next experiment is just the expected value of &quot;p&quot;. Since &quot;p&quot; is conditional on the observed data &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; for &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;n&quot;, we have

:formula_14

The same calculation can be performed with the (improper) prior that expresses total ignorance of &quot;p&quot;, including ignorance with regard to the question whether the experiment can succeed, or can fail. This improper prior is 1/(&quot;p&quot;(1 − &quot;p&quot;)) for 0 ≤ &quot;p&quot; ≤ 1 and 0 otherwise. If the calculation above is repeated with this prior, we get

:formula_15

Thus, with the prior specifying total ignorance, the probability of success is governed by the observed frequency of success. However, the posterior distribution that led to this result is the Beta(&quot;s&quot;,&quot;n&quot; − &quot;s&quot;) distribution, which is not proper when &quot;s&quot; = &quot;n&quot; or &quot;s&quot; = 0 (i.e. the normalisation constant is infinite when &quot;s&quot; = 0 or &quot;s&quot; = &quot;n&quot;). This means that we cannot use this form of the posterior distribution to calculate the probability of the next observation succeeding when &quot;s&quot; = 0 or &quot;s&quot; = &quot;n&quot;. This puts the information contained in the rule of succession in greater light: it can be thought of as expressing the prior assumption that if sampling was continued indefinitely, we would eventually observe at least one success, and at least one failure in the sample. The prior expressing total ignorance does not assume this knowledge.

To evaluate the &quot;complete ignorance&quot; case when &quot;s&quot; = 0 or &quot;s&quot; = &quot;n&quot; can be dealt with, we first go back to the hypergeometric distribution, denoted by formula_16. This is the approach taken in Jaynes (2003). The binomial formula_17 can be derived as a limiting form, where formula_18 in such a way that their ratio formula_19 remains fixed. One can think of formula_20 as the number of successes in the total population, of size formula_21.

The equivalent prior to formula_22 is formula_23, with a domain of formula_24. Working conditional to formula_21 means that estimating formula_26 is equivalent to estimating formula_20, and then dividing this estimate by formula_21. The posterior for formula_20 can be given as:

: formula_30

And it can be seen that, if &quot;s&quot; = &quot;n&quot; or &quot;s&quot; = 0, then one of the factorials in the numerator cancels exactly with one in the denominator. Taking the &quot;s&quot; = 0 case, we have:

: formula_31

Adding in the normalising constant, which is always finite (because there are no singularities in the range of the posterior, and there are a finite number of terms) gives:

: formula_32

So the posterior expectation for formula_19 is:

: formula_34

An approximate analytical expression for large &quot;N&quot; is given by first making the approximation to the product term:

: formula_35

and then replacing the summation in the numerator with an integral

: formula_36

The same procedure is followed for the denominator, but the process is a bit more tricky, as the integral is harder to evaluate

: formula_37

where ln is the natural logarithm plugging in these approximations into the expectation gives

: formula_38

where the base 10 logarithm has been used in the final answer for ease of calculation. For instance if the population is of size &quot;10&quot;&quot;k&quot; then probability of success on the next sample is given by:

: formula_39

So for example, if the population be on the order of tens of billions, so that &quot;k&quot; = 10, and we observe &quot;n&quot; = 10 results without success, then the expected proportion in the population is approximately 0.43%. If the population is smaller, so that &quot;n&quot; = 10, &quot;k&quot; = 5 (tens of thousands), the expected proportion rises to approximately 0.86%, and so on. Similarly, if the number of observations is smaller, so that &quot;n&quot; = 5, &quot;k&quot; = 10, the proportion rise to approximately 0.86% again.

This probability has no positive lower bound, and can be made arbitrarily small for larger and larger choices of &quot;N&quot;, or &quot;k&quot;. This means that the probability depends on the size of the population from which one is sampling. In passing to the limit of infinite &quot;N&quot; (for the simpler analytic properties) we are &quot;throwing away&quot; a piece of very important information. Note that this ignorance relationship only holds as long as only no successes are observed. It is correspondingly revised back to the observed frequency rule formula_40 as soon as one success is observed. The corresponding results are found for the &quot;s=n&quot; case by switching labels, and then subtracting the probability from 1.

== Generalization to any number of possibilities ==
This section gives a heuristic derivation similar to that in &quot;Probability Theory: The Logic of Science&quot;.

The rule of succession has many different intuitive interpretations, and depending on which intuition one uses, the generalisation may be different. Thus, the way to proceed from here is very carefully, and to re-derive the results from first principles, rather than to introduce an intuitively sensible generalisation. The full derivation can be found in Jaynes&#x27; book, but it does admit an easier to understand alternative derivation, once the solution is known. Another point to emphasise is that the prior state of knowledge described by the rule of succession is given as an enumeration of the possibilities, with the additional information that it is possible to observe each category. This can be equivalently stated as observing each category once prior to gathering the data. To denote that this is the knowledge used, an &quot;I&quot;&quot;m&quot; is put as part of the conditions in the probability assignments.

The rule of succession comes from setting a binomial likelihood, and a uniform prior distribution. Thus a straightforward generalisation is just the multivariate extensions of these two distributions: 1) Setting a uniform prior over the initial m categories, and 2) using the multinomial distribution as the likelihood function (which is the multivariate generalisation of the binomial distribution). It can be shown that the uniform distribution is a special case of the Dirichlet distribution with all of its parameters equal to 1 (just as the uniform is Beta(1,1) in the binary case). The Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior for the multinomial distribution, which means that the posterior distribution is also a Dirichlet distribution with different parameters. Let &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; denote the probability that category &quot;i&quot; will be observed, and let &quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot; denote the number of times category &quot;i&quot; (&quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;m&quot;) actually was observed. Then the joint posterior distribution of the probabilities &quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; is given by:

: formula_41

To get the generalised rule of succession, note that the probability of observing category &quot;i&quot; on the next observation, conditional on the &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; is just &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;, we simply require its expectation. Letting &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; denote the event that the next observation is in category &quot;i&quot; (&quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;m&quot;), and let &quot;n&quot; = &quot;n&quot;1 + ... + &quot;n&quot;&quot;m&quot; be the total number of observations made. The result, using the properties of the Dirichlet distribution is:

:formula_42

This solution reduces to the probability that would be assigned using the principle of indifference before any observations made (i.e. &quot;n&quot; = 0), consistent with the original rule of succession. It also contains the rule of succession as a special case, when &quot;m&quot; = 2, as a generalisation should.

Because the propositions or events &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; are mutually exclusive, it is possible to collapse the &quot;m&quot; categories into 2. Simply add up the &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; probabilities that correspond to &quot;success&quot; to get the probability of success. Supposing that this aggregates &quot;c&quot; categories as &quot;success&quot; and &quot;m-c&quot; categories as &quot;failure&quot;. Let &quot;s&quot; denote the sum of the relevant &quot;n&quot;i values that have been termed &quot;success&quot;. The probability of &quot;success&quot; at the next trial is then:

:formula_43

which is different from the original rule of succession. But note that the original rule of succession is based on &quot;I&quot;2, whereas the generalisation is based on &quot;I&quot;&quot;m&quot;. This means that the information contained in &quot;I&quot;&quot;m&quot; is different from that contained in &quot;I&quot;2. This indicates that mere knowledge of more than two outcomes we know are possible is relevant information when collapsing these categories down to just two. This illustrates the subtlety in describing the prior information, and why it is important to specify which prior information one is using.

== Further analysis ==
A good model is essential (i.e., a good compromise between accuracy and practicality). To paraphrase Laplace on the sunrise problem: Although we have a huge number of samples of the sun rising, there are far better models of the sun than assuming it has a certain probability of rising each day, e.g., simply having a half-life.

Given a good model, it is best to make as many observations as practicable, depending on the expected reliability of prior knowledge, cost of observations, time and resources available, and accuracy required.

One of the most difficult aspects of the rule of succession is not the mathematical formulas, but answering the question: When does the rule of succession apply? In the generalisation section, it was noted very explicitly by adding the prior information &quot;I&quot;m into the calculations. Thus, when all that is known about a phenomenon is that there are &quot;m&quot; known possible outcomes prior to observing any data, only then does the rule of succession apply. If the rule of succession is applied in problems where this does not accurately describe the prior state of knowledge, then it may give counter-intuitive results. This is not because the rule of succession is defective, but that it is effectively answering a different question, based on different prior information.

In principle (see Cromwell&#x27;s rule), no possibility should have its probability (or its pseudocount) set to zero, since nothing in the physical world should be assumed strictly impossible (though it may be)—even if contrary to all observations and current theories. Indeed, Bayes rule takes &quot;absolutely&quot; no account of an observation previously believed to have zero probability—it is still declared impossible. However, only considering a fixed set of the possibilities is an acceptable route, one just needs to remember that the results are conditional on (or restricted to) the set being considered, and not some &quot;universal&quot; set. In fact Larry Bretthorst shows that including the possibility of &quot;something else&quot; into the hypothesis space makes no difference to the relative probabilities of the other hypothesis—it simply renormalises them to add up to a value less than 1. Until &quot;something else&quot; is specified, the likelihood function conditional on this &quot;something else&quot; is indeterminate, for how is one to determine formula_44? Thus no updating of the prior probability for &quot;something else&quot; can occur until it is more accurately defined.

However, it is sometimes debatable whether prior knowledge should affect the relative probabilities, or also the total weight of the prior knowledge compared to actual observations. This does not have a clear cut answer, for it depends on what prior knowledge one is considering. In fact, an alternative prior state of knowledge could be of the form &quot;I have specified &quot;m&quot; potential categories, but I am sure that only one of them is possible prior to observing the data. However, I do not know which particular category this is.&quot; A mathematical way to describe this prior is the Dirichlet distribution with all parameters equal to &quot;m&quot;−1, which then gives a pseudocount of &quot;1&quot; to the denominator instead of &quot;m&quot;, and adds a pseudocount of &quot;m&quot;−1 to each category. This gives a slightly different probability in the binary case of formula_45.

Prior probabilities are only worth spending significant effort estimating when likely to have significant effect. They may be important when there are few observations — especially when so few that there have been few, if any, observations of some possibilities – such as a rare animal, in a given region. Also important when there are many observations, where it is believed that the expectation should be heavily weighted towards the prior estimates, in spite of many observations to the contrary, such as for a roulette wheel in a well-respected casino. In the latter case, at least some of the pseudocounts may need to be very large. They are not always small, and thereby soon outweighed by actual observations, as is often assumed. However, although a last resort, for everyday purposes, prior knowledge is usually vital. So most decisions must be subjective to some extent (dependent upon the analyst and analysis used).
