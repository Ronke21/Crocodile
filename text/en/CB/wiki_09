<text>Alan Bermowitz (June 23, 1938–July 16, 2016), known professionally as Alan Vega, was an American vocalist and visual artist, primarily known for his work with the electronic proto-punk duo Suicide.

== Life and career ==

Alan Bermowitz was raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Until the announcement of the 70th birthday release of his recordings in 2008, Vega was widely thought to have been ten years younger; the 2005 book &quot;Suicide: No Compromise&quot; lists 1948 as his birth year and quotes a 1998 interview in which Vega talks about watching Elvis Presley on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (1956) as a &quot;little kid&quot;. A 1983 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article refers to him as a 35-year-old, and several other sources also list 1948 as his birthdate. Two 2009 articles confirmed his 1948 birth date, one in &quot;Le Monde&quot; about the Lyon exhibit and one in the magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In the mid-1950s, Bermowitz attended Brooklyn College where he studied both physics and fine art under Ad Reinhardt and Kurt Seligmann and graduated in 1960.

In the 1960s, he became involved with the Art Workers&#x27; Coalition, a radical artists group that harassed museums and once barricaded the Museum of Modern Art. In 1970, he reportedly first met and befriended Martin &quot;Rev&quot; Reverby.

In 1969, funding from the New York State Council on the Arts made possible the founding of : A Project of Living Artists—an artist-run 24-hour multimedia gallery at 729 Broadway in Manhattan. Producing visual art under the name Alan Suicide, Bermowitz graduated from painting to light sculptures, many of which were constructed of electronic debris. He gained a residency at the OK Harris Gallery in SoHo where he continued to exhibit until 1975. Barbara Gladstone continued to show his work well into the 1980s.

Seeing The Stooges perform at the New York State Pavilion, in August 1969, was an epiphany for Bermowitz. With Rev, Bermowitz began experimenting with electronic music, and formed a band that would become Suicide, along with guitarist Paul Liebgott. The group played twice at before moving on to the OK Harris Gallery. Writing publicity flyers under the pseudonym Nasty Cut, Bermowitz used the terms &quot;Punk Music&quot; and &quot;Punk Music Mass&quot; to describe their music, which he adopted from an article by Lester Bangs. In 1971, the group dropped Paul Liebgott; for a time it included Rev&#x27;s wife, Mari Reverby, on drums (although she didn&#x27;t play at their live performances).

With Bermowitz finally settling on Alan Vega as a stage name, they began to play music venues. Suicide went on to perform at the Mercer Arts Center, Max&#x27;s Kansas City and CBGB, and ultimately to achieve international recognition.

In 1980, Vega released an eponymous first solo record. It defined the frantic rockabilly style that he would use in his solo work for the next several years, with the song &quot;Jukebox Babe&quot; becoming a hit single in France. In 1985, he released the more commercially viable &quot;Just a Million Dreams&quot; but was dropped from his record label after its release. The album originally was set to be produced by Ric Ocasek as a follow-up to the critically acclaimed &quot;Saturn Strip&quot; (1983), but production switched over to Chris Lord-Alge and Vega ran into several difficulties during the recording sessions. The album eschewed many of Vega&#x27;s experimental traits in favor of power pop songs and he later lamented, &quot;They took all my songs and turned them into God knows what.&quot;

Vega teamed up with Martin Rev and Ric Ocasek again in the late eighties to produce and release the third Suicide album, &quot;A Way of Life&quot; (1988). Visual artist Stefan Roloff produced a music video for the song &quot;Dominic Christ&quot;, which was released by Wax Trax! Records. Suicide went overseas to promote the album by performing the song &quot;Surrender&quot; in Paris, which was aired on French television. Shortly thereafter, Vega met future wife and music partner Elizabeth Lamere while piecing together sound experiments that would evolve into his fifth solo album, &quot;Deuce Avenue&quot; (1990). &quot;Deuce Avenue&quot; marked his return to minimalist electronic music, similar to his work with Suicide, in which he combined drum machines and effects with free-form prose. Over the next several decades he would release six more solo records and perform and release albums with Suicide.

In 2002, art dealer Jeffrey Deitch tracked down Vega after a couple of his young gallery employees &quot;gushed&quot; over a Suicide gig at the NYC Knitting Factory. As a result, Vega made a return to visual art, constructing &quot;Collision Drive&quot;, an exhibition of sculptures combining light with found objects and crucifixes.

Vega&#x27;s tenth solo album, &quot;Station&quot;, was released on Blast First Records in 2007 and was described by his colleagues as &quot;his hardest, heaviest album for quite a while.&quot; In 2008, British label Blast First Petite released a limited edition Suicide 6-CD box set and monthly tribute series of 10&quot; Vinyl EP&#x27;s, to mark the occasion of Alan Vega&#x27;s 70th birthday Musicians who contributed to the tribute series included The Horrors, Lydia Lunch, Primal Scream, and Miss Kittin.

In 2009, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Lyon, France, mounted &quot;Infinite Mercy&quot; – a major retrospective exhibit of Vega&#x27;s art, curated by Mathieu Copeland. This included the screening of two short documentary films: &quot;Alan Vega&quot; (2000) by Christian Eudeline, and &quot;Autour d’Alan Vega (extraits)&quot; (1998) by Hugues Peyret.

In 2012, Vega suffered a stroke. That, and problems with his knees, led him to focus on less physically demanding art, such as painting; however, he continued to perform at selected concerts and work on the music that led to his final studio album, &quot;It&quot;. He continued to live in downtown New York City.

In 2016, Vega contributed vocals to the song &quot;Tangerine&quot; on French pop veteran singer Christophe&#x27;s album &quot;Les Vestiges du Chaos&quot;.

In 2017, Alan Vega&#x27;s final album &quot;It&quot; was released posthumously on July 14 on Fader. The album was produced by Alan Vega, Liz Lamere, Perkin Barnes, and Jared Artaud of New York City band The Vacant Lots. The album cover and inner sleeves featured Vega&#x27;s original artwork. Two posthumous art shows &quot;Dream Baby Dream&quot; at Deitch Gallery and &quot;Keep IT Alive&quot; at Invisible-Exports exhibited Alan Vega&#x27;s work in New York City.

In 2021, Sacred Bones Records released &#x27;Mutator&#x27;, the lost Alan Vega album produced and mixed by Jared Artaud and Liz Lamere, the first in a series of unreleased and rare material from the Vega Vault.

In 2024, a posthumous album titled &quot;Insurrection,&quot; consisting of 11 previously unreleased recordings by Vega, was released on In The Red Records. The album was produced and mixed by Jared Artaud and Liz Lamere in New York City. In May 2024 a new art exhibition of Alan Vega&#x27;s fine art works entitled &quot;Cesspool Saints&quot; that is co-curated by Jared Artaud opens in Paris at Laurent Godin Gallery.

==Death==

Vega died in his sleep on July 16, 2016, at the age of 78. His death was announced by musician and radio host Henry Rollins, who shared an official statement from Vega&#x27;s family on his website.

<text>Hitomi Soga-Jenkins (Japanese: 曽我ひとみ &quot;Soga Hitomi&quot;, born May 17, 1959) is a Japanese woman who was abducted to North Korea together with her mother, Miyoshi Soga, from Sado Island, Japan, in 1978. In 1980, she married Charles Robert Jenkins, an American defector to North Korea, with whom she had two daughters. In 2002, she was allowed to return to Japan, followed two years later by her husband and children.

==Abduction and life in North Korea==

Soga, a nurse, was returning home from shopping with her mother Miyoshi, 46, when they were abducted from her hometown of Mano-cho, now part of the city of Sado, Niigata, on August 12, 1978, and taken to North Korea to train agents in Japanese customs and language. Her mother, Miyoshi, was later separated from her and has not been heard from since. The North Koreans gave Soga the Korean name &quot;Min Hye-gyeong&quot; (). She met Jenkins in early July 1980, when he was asked to teach her English, and they married on August 8, 1980. They had two daughters, Mika and Brinda.

==Repatriation==
Soga was one of a group of five Japanese abductees whom North Korea allowed to visit their homeland in September 2002. Though the trip was intended to be brief, she, like her four companions, never returned to North Korea. She and many Japanese called on North Korea to release family members who had been left behind. On July 9, 2004, Soga was reunited with her husband and two daughters in Jakarta, Indonesia, which had been chosen as a neutral venue to allay fears that Jenkins would be arrested. The family came to Japan on July 18, 2004.

Jenkins was court-martialed and incarcerated for &quot;desertion&quot; at a U.S. military installation in Japan for 26 days before being released. According to media reports, the family settled in Soga&#x27;s hometown of Mano, on Sado Island.

In October 2012, she reportedly pleaded with the North Korean government for the release of her mother and other abductees. Charles Robert Jenkins died in 2017.

<doc id="797578" wikidata="Q905026" url="?curid=797578" title="Breeders' Cup">
<text>The Breeders&#x27; Cup World Championships is an annual series of Grade I Thoroughbred horse races, operated by Breeders&#x27; Cup Limited, a company formed in 1982. From its inception in 1984 through 2006, it was a single-day event; starting in 2007, it expanded to two days. All sites have been in the United States, except in 1996, when the races were at the Woodbine Racetrack in Canada.

The attendance at the Breeders&#x27; Cup varies, depending mainly on the capacity of the host track. Santa Anita Park set the highest two-day attendance figure of 118,484 in 2016. The lowest two-day attendance was 69,584 in 2007 at Monmouth Park. The attendance typically only trails the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Kentucky Oaks (and in some years, the Belmont Stakes).

With the addition of three races for 2008, a total of $25.5 million was awarded over the two days, up from $23 million in 2007. With the subsequent removal of two races, the purses for the remaining thirteen races totaled $24.5 million in 2014, plus awards for foal and stallion nominators. Prior to the 2016 running, the total purses were raised from $26 million to $28 million. The purse of the Classic was raised from $5 million to $6 million, and the purse of the Longines Turf was increased from $3 million to $4 million. In 2018, total prizes and awards were increased to over $30 million after another race, the Juvenile Turf Sprint, was added and the purse for the Sprint was increased to $2 million.

Each Breeders&#x27; Cup race presents four Breeders&#x27; Cup trophies to the connections of the winner and a garland of flowers draped over the withers of the winning horse. Many Breeders&#x27; Cup winners will go on to win the Eclipse Award in their respective division. For example, of the eleven flat racehorse categories, seven of the Eclipse winners in 2015 had also won a Breeders&#x27; Cup race, while three others were in the money.

In the 2015 listing of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA), three Breeders&#x27; Cup races are ranked among the top Grade 1 races in the world: the Classic (4th), the Turf (10th) and the Mile (12th). The Distaff is ranked second among the top Grade 1 races for fillies and mares.

==History==

===1980s-1990s: Founding, early races===
The event was created as a year-end championship for North American Thoroughbred racing, and also attracts top horses from other parts of the world, especially Europe. The idea for the Breeders&#x27; Cup was proposed at the 1982 awards luncheon for the Kentucky Derby Festival by pet food heir John R. Gaines (1928–2005), a leading Thoroughbred owner and breeder who wanted to clean up the sport&#x27;s image. The Cup was initially faced with much skepticism in the racing community, but with the vocal support of legendary trainer John Nerud and others, the Breeders&#x27; Cup was carried out, and subsequently experienced tremendous popularity domestically and abroad.

The prize money is largely supported by nomination fees paid by breeders for stallions and the resultant foals. In North America, participating stud farms pay an annual nomination fee for a given stallions that is equal to the stallion&#x27;s advertised stud fee, plus an additional amount if the stallion has more than 50 foals in a given year. The cost to nominate a European stallion is 50% of their stud fee, while the nomination fee for a South American stallion is 25% of their stud fee. In North America, the breeders of the resultant foals must also pay a one-time nomination fee (currently $400) by October 15 of the year of birth.

The races are operated by Breeders&#x27; Cup Limited, a company formed in 1982. The first event was in 1984. From its inception in 1984 through 2006, it was a single-day event; starting in 2007, it expanded to two days. All sites have been in the United States, except in 1996, when the races were at the Woodbine Racetrack in Canada.

===2000–09: Expansion===

In 2006 Greg Avioli began serving as interim President and CEO of the Breeders&#x27; Cup, and he became the official CEO in April 2007. &quot;This is an exciting time for the Breeders&#x27; Cup&quot;, said Avioli. &quot;We will continue to focus on growing the international market for our championships, creating a successful two-day event and promoting the Breeders&#x27; Cup brand with both our television and sponsorship partners.&quot; In 2007, the event was expanded from one to two days and in 2008, the first day was devoted to female horses and the overall purse increased to over $25 million, making it what the &quot;New York Post&quot; called &quot;the richest turf festival in the world.&quot; Before the Breeders&#x27; Cup expanded to two days, it was generally considered to be the richest day in sports. Beginning in 2008, the second day of the Breeders&#x27; Cup became the second-richest. In 2008, a total of $17 million was awarded on that day, down from $20 million in 2007 (two races were moved from Day 2 to Day 1). The richest single day in sports is now another Thoroughbred racing event, Dubai World Cup Night. It features six races with a combined purse of $21 million in 2008. In 2008, the Breeders&#x27; Cup Marathon was added but was dropped in April 2014. 2008 also marked the first time most of the races were run on an artificial surface, instead of the traditional dirt.

On August 11, 2009, the Breeders&#x27; Cup announced that it would use the standard colored saddle towel system starting with the 2009 event. The new color-coded system (which has been used at many North American racetracks since the mid-1990s) replaces the standard purple saddle towels which had been used since 1985. The first Breeders&#x27; Cup in 1984 used yellow saddle towels.

On October 22, 2009, the Breeders&#x27; Cup announced it had signed simulcasting and licensing agreements with Betfair, a company which in turn had purchased the horse-racing network TVG in January of that year. The agreement brought in Betfair&#x27;s customer base of over 2.5 million, many of whom had legal access to common-pool betting. Betfair handled common-pool wagering at the organization&#x27;s November 2009 championships, also streaming the events live to both national and international wagerers for the first time. At that point, the World Championship event was being telecast in over 140 countries, through various networks.

The Breeders&#x27; Cup also introduced the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge &quot;Win and You&#x27;re In&quot; qualifying system, a policy wherein winners of major races throughout the year, from North America, England, Ireland, France, Hong Kong, Japan, South Africa, Australia would gain automatic access to the Breeders&#x27; Cup Championships races. Profits for 2010 were the highest in the organization&#x27;s history, with wagering (both pari-mutuel and non-pari-mutuel) in 2010 nearing $200 million, or $21 million more than the previous year. Over $23 million of the non-pari-mutuel was wagered over Betfair.

===2010–19===
In 2011, the organization appointed Craig R. Fravel as CEO and President, a role he will be leaving after the 2019 event to head the racing operations of the Stronach Group. Also in 2011, the Juvenile Sprint was added, only to be dropped after the 2012 running. Organizers had originally planned to ban raceday use of the anti-bleeding medication furosemide (Lasix) for more consistency with European standards, but reversed the decision due to concerns from horsemen and many handicappers.

From 2008 to 2014, the Breeders&#x27; Cup was held at either Churchill Downs or Santa Anita Park, both major tracks with a demonstrated record of success in hosting the event. In 2015 however, Keeneland was selected as the host track for the first time, in large part because of Lexington&#x27;s position as the center of the North American thoroughbred breeding industry. Although concerns were raised over Keeneland&#x27;s limited amount of permanent seating, the 2015 event was considered a success, with record Friday attendance and a sell-out on Saturday.

2015 marked the first time a Triple Crown had been won since the inception of the Breeders&#x27; Cup, and thus the first opportunity to win the so-called Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing, consisting of the Triple Crown and Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic. American Pharoah completed the feat in a decisive wire to wire victory.
In 2016, Santa Anita had the record upon hosting the Breeders&#x27; Cup for a record ninth time. The 2017 event was held at Del Mar for the first time.

The 2018 event was held at Churchill Downs. For the 2018 event, the Friday card was known as &quot;Future Stars Friday&quot; and featured five races for two-year-olds, including the new Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint. The Distaff moved back to the Saturday card. Additional Breeders&#x27; Cup changes arrived with the Breeders&#x27; Cup Future Wager, similar to the Kentucky Derby Future Wager, and the first time the Equestrian event which was intermingled with Breeders&#x27; Cup and Churchill Downs activities.

The 2019 event at Santa Anita Park ended in the death of a popular horse, Mongolian Groom, in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic. Mongolian Groom suffered a broken lower cannon bone as well as an upper portion of pastern during the race and was euthanized. The accident came after 37 other deaths at Santa Anita Park in less than a year.

===Past===
The following races have been discontinued by the Breeders&#x27; Cup:
*Breeders&#x27; Cup Marathon** 
*Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile Sprint 
**The Breeders&#x27; Cup Marathon, while no longer run as such, has actually continued to be raced every year as part of the first day of the Breeders&#x27; Cup undercard. It was run for several years as the Las Vegas Marathon and in 2022 is being run as the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance Stakes. Even as a Breeders&#x27; Cup event, the race was never a Grade I race: it was a Grade II event when last run as part of the official Breeders&#x27; Cup program in 2013, and has remained a Grade II in its subsequent runnings as a non-Breeders&#x27; Cup race.

==Selection process==
A maximum of 14 starters are allowed in each of the Breeders&#x27; Cup Championships races (depending on track dimensions, some races such as the Turf Sprint or Dirt Mile may be limited to 12 starters). Breeders&#x27; Cup Limited has adopted a field selection system to select runners in the event that fields are oversubscribed. Winners of the &quot;Win and You&#x27;re In&quot; Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge races automatically qualify. Other pre-entries are ranked by (1) a point system for graded stakes performance during the year, and (2) the judgment of a panel of racing experts. After pre-entries are taken approximately two weeks before the Breeders&#x27; Cup, the ranking determines eligibility in oversubscribed races. After pre-entry, any vacancies in the fields are filled by horses in order of panel preference.

==Details==
Through 2006, there were eight races on the Breeders&#x27; Cup card, all classified as Grade I races. In 2007, three races – the Dirt Mile, Filly and Mare Sprint, and Juvenile Turf – were added, all of them run the Friday before the remaining eight races. Three more new races – a Turf Sprint, Juvenile Filly Turf and Marathon – were added for 2008. A Juvenile Sprint was added for 2011.

The order of the races on the card has changed many times throughout the event&#x27;s history, but the Turf and Classic are traditionally the last two races. The 2008 event was the first in which Day 1 of the event was dedicated to races for fillies and mares, with Day 2 featuring all other races. For 2009, the Marathon, open to runners of both sexes, was moved from Day 2 to be the opening race on Day 1, but all other races stayed on the day they had been run in 2008. In 2011, the Marathon was moved from Day 1 to Day 2, with the Juvenile Sprint becoming the first race overall (and also the only one on Day 1 open to males). The Marathon returned to Day 1 in 2012. Since 2013, the first day was no longer primarily devoted to races for fillies and mares, with the Dirt Mile and Juvenile Turf moving to Day 1 and the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint and Filly &amp; Mare Turf moving to Day 2.

Two other significant changes were made in 2013. First, the Juvenile Sprint (on dirt) was discontinued after only two runnings. That race had been widely perceived as a consolation prize for horses not good enough to run in the Juvenile. Second, the Ladies&#x27; Classic returned to its original name of Distaff. When the latter announcement was made, Breeders&#x27; Cup president Craig Fravel said,We restored the Ladies&#x27; Classic to its original name due to feedback from our loyal fans who have a strong affinity for the Distaff. In recognition of our 30th year, the Distaff has provided us with some of racing&#x27;s most remarkable moments, personified by such outstanding thoroughbreds as Lady&#x27;s Secret, Personal Ensign, Azeri, Zenyatta, and our two-time defending champion, Royal Delta. It is a fitting tribute to bring back the name Distaff to honor the rich history of the championships.

For 2018, the sprint race for two-year-olds was revived, now on turf as the Juvenile Turf Sprint. According to officials, the turf races for two-year-old horses have more entries than can fit within the Breeders&#x27; Cup limit of 12 to 14 horses, so they needed to add the third turf race for two-year-old horses at 5.5 or six furlongs, depending on the track.

==Women in the Breeders&#x27; Cup==
===Jockeys===
The 1988 Breeders&#x27; Cup marked the first time a woman jockey competed, as American Julie Krone rode in three races that day; the Juvenile Fillies, the Juvenile and the Classic finishing 2nd, 6th and 4th respectively. Krone also became the first woman to win when she guided Halfbridled to a historic victory in the 2003 edition of the Juvenile Fillies. Rosie Napravnik became the second woman jockey to win a Breeders&#x27; Cup race, winning the Juvenile in 2012 on Shanghai Bobby and the Distaff in 2014 on Untapable.

===Trainers===
Six women trainers have won Breeders&#x27; Cup races, the first in 1996 when Jenine Sahadi won the Breeders&#x27; Cup Sprint with Lit de Justice. In 2009, Carla Gaines also won the Sprint with Dancing in Silks and in 2013 Kathy Ritvo became the first woman to train a Classic winner, Mucho Macho Man. Jo Hughes became the first woman trainer from Britain to win a race at the Breeders&#x27; Cup with London Bridge in 2013. Most recently, Maria Borell saddled 2015 Sprint winner Runhappy.

==Television==

NBC broadcast the Breeders&#x27; Cup from its inception in 1984 through 2005. In 2006, ESPN took over the television contract for eight years through 2013. However, in January 2012 the Breeders&#x27; Cup announced a new contract with NBC Sports, superseding the final two years of the ESPN contract. Beginning in 2012, the Breeders&#x27; Cup would be broadcast in its entirety on NBCSN, except for the Classic which would be televised by NBC. In 2014, NBC announced a 10-year extension of their media rights to the Breeders&#x27; Cup. In 2015, NBC Sports announced a 3-year extension of their partnership to broadcast events from the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge series.
The Breeders&#x27; Cup races were called by Tom Durkin from 1984 through 2005, and by Trevor Denman from 2006 to 2012. The Breeders&#x27; Cup has used two announcers in recent years, with Larry Collmus calling the races for the network shows, and the host track&#x27;s announcer calling for the regular in-house and simulcast feeds.

==Race tracks==
The Breeders&#x27; Cup is held at different racetracks. Santa Anita Park has hosted the event more than any other track — it hosted its 11th Breeders&#x27; Cup in 2023. Churchill Downs has hosted nine times. Belmont Park hosted the series four times, and Gulfstream Park, Hollywood Park and Keeneland each hosted the meet three times. 

Since 2008 the Breeders&#x27; Cup has rotated exclusively between two tracks in California (Santa Anita and Del Mar) and two in Kentucky (Churchill Downs and Keeneland). Del Mar will host the Breeders&#x27; Cup in 2024 and 2025, marking the first time the event has been held in consecutive years at a single location since Santa Anita held the event in 2012, 2013 and 2014.

Past and future Breeders&#x27; Cup sites:
==Steeplechase==
For several years, the &quot;Grand National Steeplechase&quot; (now run as the Grand National Hurdle Stakes) was known as the Breeders&#x27; Cup Grand National Steeplechase under a licensing agreement between the National Steeplechase Association and Breeders&#x27; Cup. However, the Grand National was never an official part of the Breeders&#x27; Cup series.

<text>Cassino () is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Frosinone, Southern Italy, at the southern end of the region of Lazio, the last city of the Latin Valley.

Cassino is located at the foot of Monte Cairo near the confluence of the Gari and Liri rivers. The city is best known as the site of the Abbey of Montecassino and the Battle of Monte Cassino during World War II, which resulted in huge Allied and German casualties as well as the near total destruction of the town itself. It is also home to the University of Cassino.

Cassino has a population of 35,969 as of July 2017, making it the second largest town in the province.

==History==

===Ancient===

Cassino&#x27;s roots lie in the settlement of Casinum, the last city of the Latins, of Umbrian or Venetic or Oscan origin, sited atop the hill of Cassino near Monte Cairo, five kilometres to the north. Casinum passed under the control of the Volscians first and then the Samnites, Eventually Sabini (a Volsci branch and Umbrian/Venetic origins) were defeated by the Romans that gained control of Casinum and its territory (&quot;ager casinas&quot;), establishing a fortified Latin colony there in 312 BC, Interamna Lirenas.

During the Roman era the most venerated god was Apollo, whose temple rose up on Monte Cassino, where today stands the abbey.
At least once during Punic Wars, Hannibal passed near Casinum. Casinum was also the site of a villa presumed to belong to Marcus Terentius Varro.
===Medieval===
The ancient Casinum was deeply damaged by several barbarian raids.
The book &quot;Dialogues&quot;, Pope Gregory I gives us the testimony of the Benedict of Nursia settlement among the ruins of Casinum Acropolis. He destroyed the image of Apollo and pagan altars, and sanctified the place in name of St. John Baptist. From that moment on, he would never leave Monte Cassino: he founded the monastery that became a model for the Western monasticism and one of the major cultural centers of Europe throughout the Middle Ages and wrote the &quot;Rule&quot;, containing precepts for his monks. In the meanwhile the population built a village called &quot;Castellum Sancti Petri&quot;.

Because of their strategic position, the abbey and the village were involved in military events. In 577 a raid of the Lombards, led by Zotto, forced the monks to leave Monte Cassino to seek refuge in Rome. They came back only after more than a century. In 744, thanks to the donation of Gisulf II of Benevento, the monastery became the capital of a new state, called Terra Sancti Benedicti (&quot;Land of Saint Benedict&quot;). Few years later the town was re-founded by Abbot Bertharius and called &quot;Eulogimenopolis&quot;, meaning &quot;city of Saint Benedict&quot; in Greek. In 883 the monastery and the town were again attacked, this time by Saracens, and Bertharius was killed along with some other monks.

The abbey was again rebuilt in 949 by the decision of Pope Agapetus II and, together with the town, renamed San Germano (after Saint Germanus of Capua), began to experience a prosperous period. For defensive purposes, the castle Rocca Janula, which still dominates the town today, was also built. In the abbey are conserved the &quot;Placiti Cassinesi&quot;, dated 960–963, considered the first documents ever written in the Italian language. The abbey of San Germano had ceased to exist by the time of Abbot Richerius (1038–1055), when it was a parish church under an archpriest.

On July 23, 1230, the city was the site of the signing of the peace between Pope Gregory IX and Frederick II, which took place in the church of San Germano. On 9 September 1349, San Germano was destroyed by a large earthquake, which also seriously damaged the abbey. The reconstruction took place in 1366, at Pope Urbano V&#x27;s will.

===Modern era===

During the Renaissance era Cassino lay on the northern frontier of the Kingdom of Naples, which was dominated by Spain. In 1504, during the Second Italian War, the French attempted to capture the town in the Battle of Cassino, but failed.

On May 15–17, 1815, the town was the set of the final cruel battle of the Neapolitan War between an Austrian force commanded by Laval Nugent von Westmeath and the King of Naples, Joachim Murat. The so-called &quot;Battle of San Germano&quot; ended with the Austrian victory.

On July 28, 1863 the name of the town was officially reverted to &quot;Cassino&quot;. In the same year the town was reached by the rail system. Cassino was part of the Province Terra di Lavoro (meaning &quot;Land of Work&quot;) until 1927, when the Province of Frosinone was founded. On May 21, 1930 a cable car leading from the town to the Abbey in 7 minutes, covering a vertical drop of over 400 metres, was inaugurated.

=== World War II and afterwards ===
In World War II, after southern Italy was invaded by the Allies, the Germans entrenched around the German Gustav Line, which, in its southern tip, was anchored around the mountains behind Cassino. The town was therefore the site of fierce fighting in the Battles of Monte Cassino. On 15 February 1944 the Abbey was destroyed by a heavy aerial bombardment. The Allies, believing that the Abbey was a strategic position occupied by the Germans, bombed it, killing many of the people who had taken refuge. The works of art contained in the Abbey were transferred to Rome by the Germans before the bombing, but many disappeared on the way. On 15 March, the town was completely razed to the ground by aerial bombardment and artillery fire, followed by an unsuccessful Allied attack. 2,026 civilians, one-tenth of the town&#x27;s entire population of 20,000, were killed by the bombing and fighting before and during the battles of Cassino.

The reconstruction lasted until the 1960s. During the months following the end of the war, the area was afflicted by a malaria epidemic. However, the population received also great solidarity from the rest of Italy in terms of donations and hospitality: many children were hosted by families in northern Italy in the years after the war.
Cassino earned the Gold Medal of Military Valour, and had three war cemeteries built: the &quot;Cassino War Cemetery&quot;, housing the Commonwealth victims, the Polish Cemetery and the Germanic Cemetery.

The economy of the area was helped by the industrialization started with the settlement of the Fiat Cassino Plant and its satellite firms, the SKF plant and several paper factories as well as by the establishment of the University of Cassino.

Today the town is commercially developed, even though it has suffered in recent years from the crisis of the automotive sectors.

==Geography==
Cassino is located at the southern end of the region of Lazio and at the northern end of the historical region called Terra di Lavoro. The city centre is set in a valley at the foot of Monte Cassino and Monte Cairo. Cassino is distant from Rome, from Naples, from the coast (Gulf of Gaeta) and from the Parco nazionale d&#x27;Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise.

The town is crossed by the rivers Gari and Rapido that join themselves in the area of the Varronian Thermal Baths; forward, in the &quot;frazione&quot; of Sant&#x27;Angelo in Theodice, the Gari joins the Liri, becoming Garigliano, the river that marks the border between the regions Lazio and Campania.

===Climate===
Because of its valley location, Cassino is often foggy in the winter, with chilly rainfall. Summers are generally quite warm and humid.

==Main sights==

===Abbey of Monte Cassino===

Founded by St. Benedict in 529, the Abbey of Monte Cassino is one of the most famous monasteries in the world and is the source of the Benedictine Order. It has been destroyed four times in its millennial history, the last time in 1944 by Allied bombing. It has been rebuilt &quot;Com&#x27;era, dov&#x27;era&quot; (&quot;How it was, where it was&quot;) after the war, and reconsecrated by Pope Paul VI in 1964.

==Economy==
Cassino&#x27;s economy is based on industry and tertiary. The Fiat Chrysler Plant and its satellite firms employs a significant part of the population. As a consequence, the economy is strongly influenced by the automotive sector&#x27;s trends, as experienced from the recent crisis. In Cassino there is also an SKF plant and several paper mills and marble factories.

The weekly market that occur every Sunday, is also an attraction of people from the surrounding municipalities. Cassino is also home to a Courthouse.

<text>Barbara Woolworth Hutton (November 14, 1912 – May 11, 1979) was an American debutante, socialite, heiress and philanthropist. She was dubbed the &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot;—first when she was given a lavish and expensive debutante ball in 1930 amid the Great Depression and later due to a notoriously troubled private life.

Heiress to one-third of the estate of the retail tycoon Frank Winfield Woolworth, Barbara Hutton was one of the wealthiest women in the world. She endured a childhood marked by the neglect of her father and the early loss of her mother at age four who died from suffocation due to mastoiditis. Rumors have persisted that she committed suicide. This set the stage for a life of difficulty forming relationships. Married and divorced seven times, she acquired grand foreign titles but was maliciously treated and often exploited by several of her husbands. Publicly she was much envied for her possessions, her beauty and her apparent life of leisure; privately she remained deeply insecure, often taking refuge in drink, drugs, and playboys.

Hutton was an inconsistent and insecure parent to her one child, exacerbated when the divorce from her second husband ended in a bitter custody battle, and she subsequently developed anorexia nervosa. Her son Lance Reventlow died in a 1972 plane crash, leaving Hutton devastated. A life of lavish spending, paired with exploitation by those entrusted to manage her estate, brought Hutton to the verge of bankruptcy before her death.

==Early life==
Born in New York City, Barbara Hutton was the only child of Edna Woolworth (1883–1917), who was a daughter of Frank W. Woolworth, the founder of the successful Woolworth five-and-dime stores. Barbara&#x27;s father was Franklyn Laws Hutton (1877–1940), a wealthy co-founder of E. F. Hutton &amp; Company (owned by Franklyn&#x27;s brother Edward Francis Hutton), a respected New York investment banking and stock brokerage firm. She was a niece by marriage of cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, who was for a time (1920–1935) married to E.F. Hutton; thus their daughter, actress-heiress Dina Merrill (born Nedenia Hutton), was a first cousin to Barbara Hutton. Merrill related on A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot; that for a time Barbara lived with them following the death of her mother and abandonment by her father.

Edna Hutton reportedly died on May 2, 1917, age 33, from suffocation due to mastoiditis, but rumor persists that she committed suicide by poison in despair over her husband&#x27;s philandering, especially as the coroner decided that no autopsy was necessary. Four-year-old Barbara discovered her mother&#x27;s body; the trauma haunted her for the rest of her life. After her mother&#x27;s death, she lived with various relatives, and was raised by a governess. Hutton attended Miss Hewitt&#x27;s Classes, now The Hewitt School in New York&#x27;s Lenox Hill neighborhood and Miss Porter&#x27;s School for Girls in Farmington, Connecticut. She became an introverted child who had limited interaction with other children of her own age. Her closest friend and only confidante was her cousin Jimmy Donahue, the son of her mother&#x27;s sister. Jimmy Donahue inherited a portion of the Woolworth estate with Barbara and also grew up to have notorious, and public, drug, alcohol and relationship problems.

In 1924, Barbara Hutton&#x27;s grandmother Jennie (Creighton) Woolworth died and bequeathed to her $26.1 million (~$ in ). Another $2.1 million in stock from Edna&#x27;s inheritance was placed in a separate trust - both trusts were administered by Franklyn Hutton. By the time of her 21st birthday in 1933, Barbara Hutton&#x27;s father had increased her inheritance to $42 million ($966,549,230.77 in 2023) not including the additional $8 million from her mother&#x27;s estate, making her one of the wealthiest women in the world.

In accordance with New York&#x27;s high society traditions, Barbara Hutton was given a lavish débutante ball in 1930 on her 18th birthday, where guests from the Astor and Rockefeller families, amongst other elites, were entertained by stars such as Rudy Vallee and Maurice Chevalier. The ball cost $60,000, a veritable fortune in the days of the Depression. Public criticism was so severe that she was sent on a tour of Europe to escape the onslaught of the press.

She lived in the family home at 4 East 80th Street on the Upper East Side.

==Marriages==

Popular poet Ogden Nash then took note of Hutton&#x27;s public private life in the following light verse:

Said Aimee McPherson to Barbara Hutton,&lt;br&gt;
&quot;How do you get a marriage to button?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;You&#x27;ll have to ask some other person.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Said Barbara Hutton to Aimee McPherson

Barbara Hutton married:
# 1933: Alexis Mdivani, a self-styled Georgian prince, divorced 1935
# 1935: Count Kurt Heinrich Eberhard Erdmann Georg von Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow, divorced 1938
# 1942: Cary Grant, divorced 1945
# 1947: Prince Igor Troubetzkoy, divorced 1951
# 1953: Porfirio Rubirosa, divorced 1954
# 1955: Baron Gottfried Alexander Maximilian Walter Kurt von Cramm, divorced 1959
# 1964: Pierre Raymond Doan, divorced 1966

===Alexis Mdivani===
 
Her first husband, , used her great wealth to his advantage. As a social climber, he and his siblings were part of the &quot;Marrying Mdivanis&quot; from Georgia who claimed to be &quot;princes&quot; after they fled Tbilisi in 1921 due to the Soviet invasion of Georgia. Alexis was already married to Louise Van Alen, a friend Barbara met at Bailey&#x27;s Beach in Rhode Island and a member of the Astor family, when he met Barbara in Biarritz, France. Their meeting was engineered by Alexis&#x27; manipulative sister (aka &quot;Roussie&quot;) who was always propelling her family into wealthy marriages even if a divorce was required. Roussie and Alexis devised a plan that would enable Alexis to divorce Louise, seduce Barbara, and force her into marriage all at once when Alexis, Louise, Barbara, Roussie, and others were visiting San Sebastian, Spain. Roussie timed Louise and other witnesses to a visit a guest cottage while Alexis seduced Barbara. The group caught the couple, prompting Barbara to flee to Paris to avoid facing the scandal, but Roussie threatened Barbara with negative publicity if she did not marry her brother. Alexis and Barbara were married on June 22, 1933, in the Russian Orthodox Church in Paris, France. Barbara&#x27;s father provided a $1 million dowry. After spending millions of Barbara&#x27;s inheritance on a home, polo ponies, clothes and men&#x27;s jewelry, Alexis and Barbara divorced in March 1935.

===Kurt Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow===
Count Kurt Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow, with whom she had her only child, a son named Lance, was her second husband. Reventlow dominated her through verbal and physical abuse, which escalated to a savage beating that left her hospitalized and put him in jail. He also persuaded her to give up her American citizenship, and to take his native Danish citizenship for tax purposes, which she did in December 1937 in a New York federal court. At this point she lapsed into drug abuse. Hutton then developed anorexia, which would plague her for the rest of her life and would leave her unable to have further children. Lance Reventlow, the son, became a race car driver and builder of his own well-respected sports car, the Scarab, in the golden age of American sports car racing.

Hutton&#x27;s divorce from Reventlow gave her custody of their son after a bitter court dispute. As her father had done, she left the raising of her child to a governess and private boarding schools.

In 1938, Hutton had a brief affair with Howard Hughes in London at the Savoy Hotel, where Hughes spent several afternoons with Hutton. Hughes, at the time, was engaged to Katharine Hepburn and had come to London to meet with government officials and arrange permission to overfly Europe as part of a plan to circumnavigate the globe by air. Hutton later recalled that &quot;he felt he must absolutely be in control of a situation.&quot;

Hughes had met Hepburn on the set of one of Cary Grant&#x27;s movies, while visiting with Grant. Howard Hughes and Cary Grant were close, long-time friends.

===Cary Grant===
In 1937, Hutton and her then husband moved into their newly-built home, Winfield House, in London&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park. They had purchased the property from the Crown Estate Commission in 1936 and were granted permission to build a new home on the land. As World War II threatened in 1939, Hutton moved to California. She supported the commandeering of Winfield House by the British Forces and its use for various wartime services during the war.

Hutton was active during the war, giving money to assist the Free French Forces and donating her yacht to the Royal Navy. Using her high-profile image to sell war bonds, she received positive publicity after being derided by the press as a result of her marriage scandals. In Hollywood, she met Cary Grant, one of the biggest movie stars of the day, and later married him on July 8, 1942. According to the US Embassy website, following their marriage, Grant was in London for the war effort and visited Winfield House. Hearing criticism of Hutton by US broadcaster, Edward R. Murrow of her abandonment of her London home, Grant suggested Murrow visit the house before levelling unfounded criticism. Following the war, Hutton gifted Winfield House to the US Government to be used as the official residence for the US Ambassador.

The press dubbed Hutton and Grant, &quot;Cash and Cary&quot;, though Grant did not need her money nor did he need to benefit from her name, and he appeared to genuinely care for Hutton. Nevertheless, this marriage also failed. Grant did not seek or receive any money from Hutton in their divorce settlement.

===Igor Troubetzkoy===
Hutton left California and moved to Paris, France, before acquiring a palace in Tangier. Hutton then began dating Igor Troubetzkoy, an expatriate Russian prince of very limited means but world renown. In the spring of 1948 in Zürich, Switzerland, she married him. That year, he was the driver of the first Ferrari to ever compete in Grand Prix motor racing when he raced in the Monaco Grand Prix, and later won the Targa Florio. He ultimately filed for divorce. Hutton&#x27;s subsequent attempted suicide made headlines around the world. Labeled by the press as the &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot;, her life made great copy and the media exploited her for consumption by a fascinated public.

===Porfirio Rubirosa===
Her next marriage, lasting 53 days (December 30, 1953 – February 20, 1954), was to Dominican diplomat Porfirio Rubirosa, a notorious international playboy who meanwhile continued his affair with actress Zsa Zsa Gabor. She was granted Dominican citizenship in 1953.

In a scathing review of the marriage ceremony in the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot;, Phyllis Battelle coined the oft-quoted phrase: &quot;The bride, for her fifth wedding, wore black and carried a scotch-and-soda.&quot;

Hutton then spent time with Americans James Douglas and Philip Van Rensselaer. Her lavish spending continued; already the owner of several mansions around the world, in 1959 she built a luxurious Japanese-style palace on a 30-acre (120,000 m2) estate in Cuernavaca, Mexico.

===Gottfried von Cramm===
Her next husband was an old friend, German tennis star Baron Gottfried von Cramm. This marriage also ended in divorce. He later died in an automobile crash near Cairo, Egypt, in 1976.

===Raymond Doan===
In Tangier, Hutton met her seventh husband, Prince Pierre Raymond Doan Vinh na Champassak. This marriage, too, was short-lived. Raymond Doan was an adopted member of the former royal family of the Kingdom of Champasak (roughly located in modern Laos).

===Other relationships===
Hutton lived with Frederick McEvoy, purchasing a chalet at a ski resort in Franconia, New Hampshire, after her marriage to actor Cary Grant. The couple never married and remained friends until McEvoy&#x27;s death in 1951.
Hutton frequently appeared intoxicated in public and was notorious throughout her life for lavish spending. She was known to make gifts to total strangers.

==Art and jewelry==
Over the years, apart from an important inheritance which included Old Master paintings and important sculptures, she also personally acquired a magnificent collection of her own which included the spectrum of arts, porcelain, valuable jewelry, including elaborate historic pieces that had once belonged to Marie Antoinette and Empress Eugénie of France, and important pieces by Fabergé and Cartier. Among her pieces of jewelry was the Pasha Diamond, which she purchased as an unusual octagonal brilliant-cut but had recut into a round brilliant, bringing it down to .

==Final years and death==

The death of her only son Lance Reventlow in a plane crash in 1972 sent Hutton into a state of despair. By this time, her fortune had diminished, due to her extreme generosity, including donating Winfield House to the United States government as a residence for its UK ambassador. Alleged questionable deals by her longtime lawyer, Graham Mattison, also ate away at her fortune. Eventually she began liquidating assets in order to raise funds to live, yet continued to spend money on strangers willing to pay a little attention to her. She spent her final years in Los Angeles, living at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where she died from a heart attack in May 1979, aged 66. One biographer wrote that, at her death, $3,500 was all that remained of her fortune, but some close to her said that was not the case. She was interred in the Woolworth family mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York.

<text>Buje (; ) is a town situated in Istria, Croatia&#x27;s westernmost peninsula.

Buje was known as the &quot;sentinel of Istria&quot; for its hilltop site located inland from the Adriatic Sea.

==History==
Buje has a rich history; traces of life in the region date back to prehistoric times. The town developed from a Roman and Venetian settlement into a medieval town. Buje was part of the Republic of Venice from 1358 until 1797, when the Treaty of Campo Formio handed it over to Austria. It was annexed by France after the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809 but restored to Austria at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Buje passed to Italy at the end of World War I in 1918, where it remained until 1945. In 1947, it became part of the Free Territory of Trieste Zone B, which was administered by Yugoslavia. In October 1954, Zone B together with Buje was united with the Socialist Republic of Croatia, and remains part of independent Croatia today.

A Baroque style Church of Our Lady of Mercy from the 16th century, built on the foundations of an ancient Roman temple, dominates the central square. The old city was protected with stone fortifications, part of which have been preserved to modern times. With its narrow streets and a central square, the old town is a fine example of Medieval architecture with strong Venetian Renaissance architecture influences, as in the rest of the region.

After World War II Buje developed into an industrial, cultural, and economic center of this region of northwestern Croatia.

== Geography ==
The town is located in northwest Istria, 13 km from Umag. The town has an area of 103.28 km2.

Buje has become a modern regional center, and outside of the old town center a modern city has sprung. Despite its development, the city has retained some features from its historical periods.

Being situated on a hill, the old town section offers views of the surrounding scenery, dominated by Mediterranean flora, vineyards, and olive groves.

To its visitors today, Buje offers a blend of gentle Mediterranean climate, regional cuisine, and a quiet setting away from the more touristic Istrian coastal resorts.

== Municipality ==
The Town of Buje consists of 21 settlements.
==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census, its population was 4,441 with 2,087 living in the town proper.

The population of the whole administrative area of the Town of Buje in 2011 was 5,182, with 2,671 in the titular settlement itself.

=== Languages ===
According to the 1921 census, there were 7,431 Italians, 6 Croats, 8 Slovenes and 20 foreigners.

According to the 2011 census results, 58.39% of the town&#x27;s population had the Croatian language as their mother tongue, and 33.25% had the Italian language.

Buje has a high number of Italians, and an Italian language school, the &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot;. It was 50% Italian in 1991, when the town&#x27;s limits included Grožnjan/Grisignana.

<text>Senj (; ; ; Hungarian and ) is a town on the upper Adriatic coast in Croatia, in the foothills of the Mala Kapela and Velebit mountains.

The symbol of the town is the Nehaj Fortress () which was completed in 1558. For a time this was the seat of the Uskoks (), who were Christian refugees from Ottoman Bosnia resettled here to protect the Habsburg borderlands. The Republic of Venice accused the Uskoks of piracy and declared war on them which led to their expulsion following a truce in 1617.

Senj is to be found in the Lika-Senj County of Croatia, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gospić-Senj and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rijeka.

==History==

Senj has apparently been inhabited since prehistoric times. Senj is an old settlement founded more than 3000 years ago on Kuk hill, which is east of today&#x27;s Senj. A settlement called Athyinites or Athuinites (Αθυινιτες) in today&#x27;s Senj was mentioned in Greek documents dated to the 4th century BC. The Illyrian tribes Iapodes and Liburnians inhabited the area as it was located in Illyria.

&quot;Senia&quot; was a thriving town in the Roman province of Dalmatia, used by the Romans as a stronghold against the Illyrians in the 2nd century BC. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Avars and the Croats eventually settled here in the 7th century AD.

The Catholic diocese of Senj was established in 1169. King of Hungary Béla III gave the town to the Knights Templar in 1184, and in 1271 it became the property of the Frankopan counts of Krk.

In 1248 the bishop of Senj was allowed by Pope Innocent IV to use the Glagolitic alphabet and the vernacular in liturgy. A Glagolitic printing press was set up in 1494 and produced the &quot;incunabula&quot; &quot;The Glagolic Missal&quot; and &quot;Spovid općena&quot;.

The military captaincy of Senj was established in 1469 in order to defend against the invading Ottoman and Venetian armies. The town sheltered thousands of refugees from nearby occupied areas. The Nehaj Fortress was completed in 1558 on the hill Nehaj, which at the time was outside of town. Today it is wholly within the town&#x27;s borders. The wars with the Ottomans lasted well into the 17th century. During this time the Uskoks lived in Senj and occupied its fortress. One of the most significant Uskoks was Ivo Senjanin (Ivo of Senj), who frequently launched expeditions against the Ottomans until his execution in 1612. They served an important purpose during the wars since they had small units of men rowing swift boats that proved to be very effective guerrilla forces. However, after the Uskok War with Venice, which ended in 1617, they were forbidden to settle in the area. Prince Radic was appointed Prince of Senj by king Rudolf emperor of Austria (1 December 1600). (Radic family) Native noble family from Lika region; members of the family were Uskok military leaders at the headquarters in Senj.

Notable polymath and writer Pavao Ritter Vitezović was born within the city walls in 1652, whose work later inspired the Illyrian movement.

The 18th century brought some prosperity, especially with the construction of the &quot;Josephina&quot; (named after Emperor Joseph II) linking the Adriatic coast via Senj to Karlovac. The railway line built in 1873 between Fiume (Rijeka) and Karlovac did not pass by Senj which held back further development.

Until 1918, the town was part of the Austrian monarchy (Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Lika-Krbava County after the compromise of 1867), in the Croatian Military Frontier (&quot;Regiment III&quot;).

In the fall of 1943, during World War II, when Fascist Italy capitulated, the Partisans took control of Senj and used it as a supply port. Subsequently, the Luftwaffe started bombarding the town. By the end of the year they had demolished over half of the buildings in town and inflicted heavy civilian casualties.

==Climate==

Senj has a temperate climate which is usually described as temperate Oceanic or Marine west coast, with mild, windy winters and relatively dry and warm summers. According to the Köppen climate classification it falls within a cool, dry-summer subtropical zone (Csb), with cool-summer Mediterranean characteristics such as its usually dry summers.

==Economy==

Modern Senj is a seaside tourist town. Primary industries are fishing, boating, and tourism.

==Population==

As of the 2021 census, Senj had a population of 5,973, with 97.30% being ethnic Croats. The largest minorities are Serbs with a population of 43 (0.72%) and Albanians with a population of 27 (0.45%)

<text>George Island () is the second largest of the Speedwell Island Group in the Falkland Islands with a land area of . It lies south of Speedwell Island and south west of East Falkland, and is separated from Lafonia by Eagle Passage. The island is generally flat, rising no more than above sea level, and there are several ponds and there is severe soil erosion in the central section. However, the island is free of rats.

George and Barren Islands together are run as a sheep farm, the most southerly in the Falkland Islands. There is also tourism that is well managed.

<text>Solin (Latin and ; ) is a town and a suburb of Split, in Split-Dalmatia county, Croatia. It is situated right northeast of Split, on the Adriatic Sea and the river Jadro.

Solin developed on the location of ancient city of &quot;Salona&quot;, which was the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia and the birthplace of Emperor Diocletian. After the arrival of Avars and Croats in the 7th-century, the town was destroyed, and its refugees moved to the settlement in and around Diocletian&#x27;s palace, &quot;Spalatum&quot; (Split), turning it into a fortified town. In the Early Middle Ages, Solin was part of Croatian territory and played an important role in the Medieval Croatian state, being one of the political centres.

In the 20th century, the intensive industrialisation process of the Split basin made Solin no more than a suburb of Split. Today, with its independent municipal status, Solin is part of the Split conurbation, well connected with other towns. Lately, besides industry, tourism is being developed based on numerous archaeological sites and Solin&#x27;s distinctive image that comes from many urban parks along the Jadro.

==Geography==
Solin is situated north of the Split peninsula, in a basin surrounded by mountains Kozjak (779 m) to the north and Mosor (1339 m) to the east. The ancient city of Salona developed near the estuary of Jadro, and the later medieval settlement was formed on one of the several islands formed by the river, which is where today&#x27;s center is also situated.

The city covers an area of , situated in the central part of the Split conurbation, north of Split, east of Kaštela, east of Trogir and south of Klis. Residential and business parts of the city are located in the middle part of the river&#x27;s flow, and on the gentle slopes that make the Solin basin. Industrial areas occupy a small valley of the upper basin of the Jadro, as well as large areas to the west of the center, on the easternmost tip of the bay of Kaštela where industrial and service port is situated. The ruins of the ancient Salona are located in the middle, to the west of today center.

The climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters and hot summers. During the winter, a strong north-eastern wind Bura occurs frequently.

===Settlements===
The administrative area of the city of Solin includes the following settlements:

* Blaca, population 3
* Kučine, population 1,082
* Mravince, population 1,717
* Solin, population 20,996
* Vranjic, population 1,064

In the vernacular, Solin is divided into eight neighbourhoods: Centar, Priko vode, Srednja strana, Sveti Kajo, Rupotina, Vranjic, Mravince and Kučine.

==History==
===Ancient Salona===
In the late ancient times, Salona&#x27;s importance was great both politically and religiously. It was the birthplace of Emperor Diocletian, who ruled the Roman Empire from 284 to 305 AD. He was born around 244, and served as a soldier and then a Roman army officer as a young man.

Salona was an early Roman settlement, which became overshadowed when Diocletian constructed the nearby Diocletian&#x27;s Palace in about the year 300 AD. Surviving local residents of Salona, after the Avars retreated from those regions, to a settlement &quot;Spalatum&quot;, today&#x27;s (Split), at the location of Diocletian&#x27;s Palace (probably around the middle 7th century AD). Christianity in Salona probably originated during the time of the apostles.

The Apostle Paul mentions that his pupil Apostle Titus traveled to Dalmatia so the assumption that he worked in Dalmatia&#x27;s capital city of Salona, at least for a short time, is probable. That city, located on the Adriatic coast, with excellent sea connections with Italy and the Middle East, attracted Christian messengers of faith.
Salona had a well-organized Christian community with a bishop as leader ever since the middle of the 3rd century (bishop martyr Venantius lived at that time). Since the fourth century, Salona honored in its large basilicas its glorious martyrs from the times of Diocletian&#x27;s persecution: St Domnius (Latin: &quot;Domnius&quot;; Croatian: &quot;Duje&quot;; Italian: &quot;Domnio&quot;), craftsman Anastasius the Fuller, deacon Septimia, priest Asteria, and others.

In the fifth Century, Salona&#x27;s bishops started exercising more metropolitan duties (archbishop Hezihius), and in the sixth century they carried the archbishop title as well (arhiepiscopus), and fulfilled the duties associated with the title. (archbishops Stephen, Honorius and others). That means that at that time they held primary positions in western Illyria. Siscia&#x27;s bishop from the region Pannonia joined the Dalmatian bishops on the synods held in Salona in the years 530 and 533 as a member with full rights. At the time of Diocletian, Salona had a population of 60,000.

In 639 Salona was destroyed by the Slavs. After the fall of Salona and the whole region under the Avarian rule (first quarter of 7th century), worship of Salona&#x27;s martyrs was moved to Rome. Namely, Pope John IV ordered transportation of parts of their relics, which he placed in a dedicated chapel close to the Lateran baptistry. The images of those saints, which had been created in mosaic by the Pope&#x27;s wish, can be found today in the apside of the chapel. Search for relics for Rome was probably the incentive for Salona residents who inhabited the new city of Split, located only a few kilometers from the abandoned Salona. At the very least, they wanted to bring to Split the bones of their most important protectors: St. Domnius and St. Anastasius. They placed them in what was once Diocletian&#x27;s mausoleum, which was subsequently converted into the Cathedral of Saint Domnius.

===Middle Ages===

In the 9th century, Duke Trpimir I of Croatia built a Benedictine monastery between Klis and Solin. Inscriptions dated to 852 from there are first known written record of the name of Croats in modern-day Croatian territory.

In the 10th century, Queen Helen (Jelena) had built two churches by the Jadro: the Church of St. Stephen and the Church of St. Mary. The Church of St. Stephen was the burial place of a number of Croatian kings along with other nobility, It was destroyed by the Ottoman Turks in the 16th century. The nearby Church of Saint Mary was the burial site of Mihajlo Krešimir II and his wife Jelena, the benefactress.

In the 11th century, the Church of Saint Peter and Moses (known today as &quot;hollow church&quot;) was built north of Solin, near the two churches of Saint Mary and Stephen, in which Demetrius Zvonimir was crowned as king of Dalmatia and Croatia.
==Transport==
Solin is situated on the D8 (E65) Adriatic road (&quot;Jadranska magistrala&quot;), that becomes a 4-lane &quot;Split bypass road&quot; here and continues south towards Split and further down the Adriatic coast. A big roundabout south of the city centre is a major intersection with a D1 (E59) road that connects the area of Split conurbation with the A1 Zagreb-Split highway.

The Zagreb-Split railway passes through the city territory. Although there is a train station in Solin ( to the west of the city centre), only regional trains stop here. Regional rail transport is to be intensified because of the Split Suburban Railway project.

Split Airport (SPU) in Kaštela is situated to the west of Solin, well-connected by roads and local transport.

Public transport is organized by several bus lines operated by the Promet Split company, which provides public transport for the Split conurbation. These routes are:
* #1 Starine (Solin) - HNK (Split)
* #2 Kaštel Sućurac - Trajektna luka (Split)
* #5 Dračevac (Solin) - HNK (Split)
* #10 Japirko (Solin) - Trajektna luka (Split)
* #13 Kolodvor Sukoišanska (Split) - Dračevac (Solin)
* #16 Ninčevići (Solin) - HNK (Split)
* #22 Rupotina (Solin) - HNK (Split)
* #32 Kolodvor Sukoišanska (Split) - Kučine (Solin)
Local bus lines from Split to Kaštela, Trogir, Klis and Sinj also stop in Solin centre.
==Demography==
As of 2021, Solin has 24,862 inhabitants, 49.01% of them being male and 50.09% being female.

<text>Operation Praying Mantis was the 18 April 1988 attack by the United States on Iranian naval targets in the Persian Gulf in retaliation for the mining of a U.S. warship four days earlier.

On 14 April, the American guided missile frigate struck a mine while transiting international waters as part of Operation Earnest Will, the 1987–88 effort to protect reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attacks during the Iran–Iraq War. The explosion pierced the hull and broke the keel of the &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;, which nearly sank but was saved by its crew with no loss of life.

After the serial numbers of mines recovered in the area were found to match those of mines seized on an Iranian barge the previous September, U.S. military officials planned a retaliatory operation. On 18 April, the attack destroyed, damaged, or sank two Iranian oil platforms, three warships, several armed boats, and two fighter jets. Two U.S. Marine aviators died when their helicopter crashed into the Gulf.

The attack pressured Iran to agree to a ceasefire with Iraq later that summer, ending the eight-year Iran-Iraq War.

Later, Iran sued the United States, claiming that the attacks had breached the countries&#x27; 1955 Treaty of Amity. On 6 November 2003, the International Court of Justice dismissed the claim but ruled that Operation Praying Mantis and the previous October&#x27;s Operation Nimble Archer &quot;cannot be justified as measures necessary to protect the essential security interests of the United States of America.&quot;

Praying Mantis was the largest of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s five major surface engagements since World War II. It saw the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first exchange of anti-ship missiles with opposing ships, and its only sinking of a major surface combatant since World War II.

==Battle==

On 18 April, the U.S. Navy attacked with several groups of surface warships, plus aircraft from the aircraft carrier , and her cruiser escort, . The action began with coordinated strikes by two surface groups.

One surface action group, or SAG, consisting of the destroyers (including embarked LAMPS Mk I helicopter detachment HSL-35 Det 1 &quot;Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 35&quot;) and , plus the amphibious transport dock and its embarked Marine air-ground task force (Contingency MAGTF 2-88 from Camp LeJeune, North Carolina) and the LAMPS helicopter detachment (HSL-44 Det 5) from USS &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;, was ordered to destroy the guns and other military facilities on the Sassan oil platform.

At 8 am, the SAG commander, who was also the commander of Destroyer Squadron 9, ordered the &quot;Merrill&quot; to radio a warning to the occupants of the platform, telling them to abandon it. The SAG waited 20 minutes, then opened fire. The oil platform fired back with twin-barrelled 23 mm ZU-23 guns. The SAG&#x27;s guns eventually disabled some of the ZU-23s, and platform occupants radioed a request for a cease-fire. The SAG complied.

After a tugboat carrying more personnel had cleared the area, the ships resumed exchanging fire with the remaining ZU-23s, and ultimately disabled them. AH-1 Cobra helicopters completed the destruction of enemy resistance. The Marines boarded the platform and recovered a single wounded survivor, who was transported to Bahrain, some small arms, and intelligence. The Marines planted explosives, left the platform, and detonated them. The SAG was then ordered to proceed north to the Rakhsh oil platform to destroy it.

As the SAG departed the Sassan oil field, two Iranian F-4s made an attack run but broke off when &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; locked its fire-control radar on the aircraft. Halfway to the Rahksh oil platform, the attack was called off in an attempt to ease pressure on the Iranians and signal a desire for de-escalation.

The other group, which included the guided missile cruiser and frigates and , attacked the Sirri oil platform. Navy SEALs were assigned to capture, occupy, and destroy the Sirri platform but because it had already been heavily damaged by naval gunfire, an assault was not required.

Iran responded by dispatching Boghammar speedboats to attack various targets in the Persian Gulf, including the American-flagged supply ship &quot;Willie Tide&quot;, the Panamanian-flagged oil rig &quot;Scan Bay&quot; and the British tanker &quot;York Marine&quot;. All of these vessels were damaged in different degrees. The targets were part of the Mubarak off-shore Saudi oil field. After the attacks, A-6E Intruder aircraft launched from USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; were directed to the speedboats by an American frigate. The two VA-95 aircraft dropped Rockeye cluster bombs on the speedboats, sinking one and damaging several others, which then fled to the Iranian-controlled island of Abu Musa.
Action continued to escalate. Iranian fast-attack craft , an Iranian (La Combattante II type) fast attack craft, challenged &quot;Wainwright&quot; and Surface Action Group Charlie. The commanding officer of &quot;Wainwright&quot; directed a final warning (of a series of warnings) stating that &quot;Joshan&quot; was to &quot;stop your engines, abandon ship, I intend to sink you&quot;. &quot;Joshan&quot; responded by firing a Harpoon missile at them. The missile was successfully lured away by chaff.

&quot;Simpson&quot; responded to the challenge by firing four Standard missiles, while &quot;Wainwright&quot; followed with one Standard missile. All missiles hit and destroyed the Iranian ship&#x27;s superstructure but did not immediately sink it, so &quot;Bagley&quot; fired another Harpoon. The missile did not find the target. SAG Charlie closed on &quot;Joshan,&quot; with &quot;Simpson&quot;, then &quot;Bagley&quot; and &quot;Wainwright&quot; firing guns to sink the crippled Iranian ship.

Two Iranian F-4 Phantom fighters were orbiting about away when &quot;Wainwright&quot; decided to drive them away. &quot;Wainwright&quot; fired two Extended Range Standard missiles, one of which detonated near an F-4, blowing off part of its wing and peppering the fuselage with shrapnel. The F-4s withdrew, and the Iranian pilot landed his damaged airplane at Bandar Abbas.

Fighting continued when the Iranian frigate departed Bandar Abbas and challenged elements of an American surface group. The frigate was spotted by two A-6Es from VA-95 while they were flying surface combat air patrol for .

&quot;Sahand&quot; fired missiles at the A-6Es, which replied with two Harpoon missiles and four laser-guided Skipper missiles. &quot;Joseph Strauss&quot; fired a Harpoon missile. Most or all of the shots scored hits, causing heavy damage and fires. Fires blazing on &quot;Sahand&quot;″s decks eventually reached its munitions magazines, causing an explosion that sank it.

Late in the day, the Iranian frigate departed from its berth and fired a surface-to-air missile at several A-6Es from VA-95. The A-6Es then dropped a Mark 82 laser-guided bomb into &quot;Sabalan&quot;″s stack, crippling the ship and leaving it burning. The Iranian frigate, stern partially submerged, was taken in tow by an Iranian tug, and was repaired and eventually returned to service. VA-95&#x27;s aircraft, as ordered, did not continue the attack. The A-6 pilot who crippled &quot;Sabalan&quot;, Lieutenant Commander James Engler, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by Admiral William J. Crowe, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for the actions against &quot;Sabalan&quot; and the Iranian gunboats.

In retaliation for the attacks, Iran fired Silkworm missiles, suspected to be the HY-4 version, from land bases against SAG Delta in the Strait of Hormuz and against in the northern central Persian Gulf, but all missed because of evasive maneuvers and use of decoys by the ships. A missile was probably shot down by &quot;Gary&quot;″s gun. The Pentagon and the Reagan Administration later denied that any Silkworm missile attacks took place, possibly in order to keep the situation from escalating further - as they had promised publicly that any such attacks would merit retaliation against targets on Iranian soil.

===Disengagement===
After the attack on &quot;Sabalan&quot;, U.S. naval forces were ordered to assume a de-escalatory posture, giving Iran a way out and avoiding further combat. Iran took the offer and combat ceased, though both sides remained on alert, and near-clashes occurred throughout the night and into the next day as the forces steamed within the Gulf. Two days after the battle, &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; was directed to escort a U.S. oiler out through the Strait of Hormuz, while a Scandinavian-flagged merchant remained near, probably for protection. While the ships remained alert, no hostile indications were received, and the clash was over.

==Aftermath==

By the end of the operation, US Marines and US Navy ships and aircraft had destroyed Iranian naval and intelligence facilities on two inoperable oil platforms in the Persian Gulf, and sunk at least three armed Iranian Boghammer speedboats, one Iranian frigate, and one fast attack missile boat. One other Iranian frigate was damaged in the battle. &quot;Sabalan&quot; was repaired in 1989 and has since been upgraded, and is still in service with the Iranian navy. The fires eventually burned themselves out but the damage to the infrastructure forced the demolition of the Sirri platforms after the war. The site was built up again for oil production by French and Russian oil companies, after buying the drilling rights from the Iranian government.

The U.S. side suffered two casualties, the crew of a Marine Corps AH-1T Sea Cobra attack helicopter. The Cobra, attached to USS &quot;Trenton&quot;, was flying reconnaissance from &quot;Wainwright&quot; and crashed sometime after dark about southwest of Abu Musa island. The bodies of the lost personnel were recovered by Navy divers in May, and the wreckage of the helicopter was raised later that month. Navy officials said it showed no sign of battle damage. In his book &quot;Tanker War,&quot; author Lee Allen Zatarain indicates there was some evidence the helicopter may have crashed while evading hostile fire from the island.

A month later, the guided-missile cruiser arrived, summoned in haste to protect the frigate &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; as it was hauled back to the United States. On 3 July 1988, &quot;Vincennes&quot; shot down Iran Air Flight 655, a commercial airliner flying a scheduled route, killing all 290 crew and passengers. The U.S. government claimed that the crew of &quot;Vincennes&quot; mistook the Iranian Airbus for an attacking F-14 fighter. The Iranian government alleged that &quot;Vincennes&quot; knowingly shot down a civilian aircraft and called for the deaths of its crew.

===International Court of Justice===
On 6 November 2003 the International Court of Justice dismissed a claim by Iran and a counterclaim by the United States&#x27; for reparations for breach of a 1955 &#x27;Treaty of Amity&#x27; between the two countries. In short, the court rejected both claim and counterclaim because the 1955 treaty protected only &quot;freedom of trade and navigation between the territories of the parties&quot; and because of the US trade embargo on Iran at the time, no direct trade or navigation between the two was affected by the conflict.

The court did state that &quot;the actions of the United States of America against Iranian oil platforms on 19 October 1987 (Operation Nimble Archer) and 18 April 1988 (Operation Praying Mantis) cannot be justified as measures necessary to protect the essential security interests of the United States of America&quot;. The Court ruled that it &quot;...cannot however uphold the submission of the Islamic Republic of Iran that those actions constitute a breach of the obligations of the United States of America under Article X, paragraph 1, of that Treaty, regarding freedom of commerce between the territories of the parties, and that, accordingly, the claim of the Islamic Republic of Iran for reparation also cannot be upheld;&quot;.

<text>The Chicago Illinois Temple is the thirty-fifth temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is the second of three church temples that have been built in Illinois (The first and the third being the original and rebuilt temples in Nauvoo). The intent to build the temple was announced during a press conference on April 1, 1981, by church president Spencer W. Kimball.

The temple has six detached spires and a statue of the angel Moroni. Designed by church architectural staff and local architecture firm Wight &amp; Co, the structure is a sister temple to those in Boise, Idaho and Dallas, Texas. A groundbreaking ceremony, to signify beginning of construction, was held on August 13, 1983, conducted by Gordon B. Hinckley. 

==History==
The intent to construct the temple was announced by Spencer W. Kimball on April 1, 1981&quot;.&quot; Located in the Chicago suburb of Glenview, ground was broken on the site on August 13, 1983 by Gordon B. Hinckley, a member of the church&#x27;s First Presidency. The structure itself was constructed in gray buff marble and its roof features gray slate. Architects used a new design, adapting the traditional six-spire design and adding modern motifs.

The construction of the temple faced some pushback from the community due to environmental concerns. Construction was eventually able to proceed. Construction of the temple also allowed local Latter-day Saints to contribute their means, talents, and time. This included children donating pennies, young women making dolls for the temple nursery, and women crocheting and tatting altar cloths. Many hours were donated in helping with the public open house, held July 15 – August 3, 1985, during which over one hundred thousand people toured the temple. Hinckley dedicated the temple on August 9, 1985.

Four years after the dedication, the temple was closed and expanded, which more than doubled its size. The temple now has a total of , five ordinance rooms, and three sealing rooms.

On December 24, 2008, a frozen sprinkler pipe burst in the ceiling, with water-damaged furniture, carpet and wood trim that all had to be replaced.

In 2020, like all the church&#x27;s other temples, the Chicago Illinois Temple was closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Design and architecture ==
The building has a modern architectural style, coupled with a traditional Latter-day Saint temple design. The temple&#x27;s architecture reflects both the cultural heritage of the Chicago region and its spiritual significance to the church.

=== Site ===
The temple sits on a 13-acre plot, and the landscaping around the temple includes two water features. These elements are designed to provide a tranquil setting that enhances the sacred atmosphere of the site.

=== Exterior ===
The structure stands 112 feet tall, constructed with gray buff marble with a gray slate roof. The exterior is characterized by six detached spires and an angel Moroni statue, elements which were each chosen for their symbolic significance and alignment with temple traditions. The design incorporates elements that are reflective of both the local culture and church symbolism.

=== Interior ===
The interior features glass-paneled ceilings, ornamental marble, and chandeliers, centered around the celestial room, which is designed to create a spiritually uplifting environment. The temple includes five instruction rooms, three sealing rooms, a baptistry, and a celestial room, each designed for ceremonial use. 

=== Symbols ===
The design uses elements representing Latter-day Saint symbolism, which provide deeper spiritual meaning to the temple&#x27;s appearance and function. Symbolism is important to church members. One of the most visible symbolic elements of the temple is its six spires, used in the 1960s and 1980s to emulate the Salt Lake Temple, and the spires also symbolize the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods.

== Renovations ==
The temple has undergone several renovations to preserve its structural integrity, update facilities, and enhance its spiritual and aesthetic appeal. The most significant renovation project commenced in 1988. 

The renovations of the temple focused on several key areas, including expanding its interior. These changes were made to ensure the temple&#x27;s compliance with contemporary building standards and to accommodate the evolving needs of church members. The renovations included the relocation of a central tower from the rear exterior to a foyer near the chapel.

The renovated temple was rededicated on October 8, 1989, by Gordon B. Hinckley.

== Temple presidents ==
The church&#x27;s temples are directed by a temple president and matron, each serving for a term of three years. The president and matron oversee the administration of temple operations and provide guidance and training for both temple patrons and staff.

The first president of the Chicago Illinois Temple was Lysle R. Cahoon, with the matron being Betty Jane P. Cahoon. They served from 1985 to 1988. As of 2024, Jack D. Ward is the president, with Sharmon O. Ward serving as matron.

== Admittance ==
When construction was completed, the church held a public open house from July 15-August 3, 1985. The temple was then dedicated by Gordon B. Hinckley in 19 dedicatory sessions from August 9-13, 1985. Following the temple’s renovation period, it was rededicated by Gordon B. Hinckley on October 8, 1989. Like all the church&#x27;s temples, it is not used for Sunday worship services. To members of the church, temples are regarded as sacred houses of the Lord. Once dedicated, only church members with a current temple recommend can enter for worship.

<text>Margaret Julia &quot;Marlo&quot; Thomas (born November 21, 1937) is an American actress, producer, author, and social activist. She is best known for starring on the sitcom &quot;That Girl&quot; (1966–1971) and her children&#x27;s franchise &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot;. She received three Primetime Emmy Awards, a Daytime Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Peabody Award for her work in television and was inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame.

She also received a Grammy Award for her children&#x27;s album &quot;Marlo Thomas and Friends: Thanks &amp; Giving All Year Long&quot;. In 2014, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Thomas serves as National Outreach Director for St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, which was founded by her father Danny Thomas in 1962. She created the Thanks &amp; Giving campaign in 2004 to support the hospital.

==Early life==
Thomas was born in Detroit and raised in Beverly Hills, California, the eldest child of Rose Marie Cassaniti and comedian Danny Thomas. She has a sister, Terre, and a brother, producer Tony Thomas. Her father was a Catholic Lebanese American and her mother was Sicilian American. Her godmother was Loretta Young. The name &quot;Marlo&quot; came from her childhood mispronunciation of the name Margo, as Thomas was called by her family.

Thomas attended Marymount High School and graduated from the University of Southern California with a teaching degree: &quot;I wanted a piece of paper that said I was qualified to do something in the world&quot;. She was a member of the sorority Kappa Alpha Theta.

==Career==

===Early career===
Thomas appeared in many television programs including &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, and &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;. Her big break came in 1965 when she was cast by Mike Nichols in the London production of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot in the Park,&quot; co-starring Daniel Massey, Kurt Kasznar, and Mildred Natwick. (In 1986, she was once again cast by Nichols on Broadway in Andrew Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Social Security,&quot; co-starring Ron Silver and Olympia Dukakis.)

Thomas and her father, Danny, were cast as Laurie and Ed Dubro in a 1961 episode, &quot;Honor Bright&quot;, of CBS&#x27; &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;.

===&quot;That Girl&quot;===

Thomas starred in an ABC pilot called &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot; in 1965. Although it did not sell, it caught the attention of a network programming executive. He met with Thomas, and expressed interest in casting her in her own series. With their encouragement, Thomas came up with her own idea for a show about a young woman who leaves home, moves to New York City, and struggles to become an actress. The network was initially hesitant, fearing audiences would find a series centering on a single female uninteresting or unrealistic.

The concept eventually evolved into the sitcom entitled &quot;That Girl&quot;, in which Thomas played Ann Marie, a beautiful, up-and-coming actress with a writer boyfriend, played by Ted Bessell. The series told the daily struggles of Ann holding different temporary jobs while pursuing her dream of a career on Broadway. &quot;That Girl&quot; was one of the first television shows to focus on a working, single woman who did not live with her parents, and it paved the way for many shows to come. Thomas was only the fourth woman to produce her own series, following Gertrude Berg, Lucille Ball, and Betty White. &quot;That Girl&quot; aired from 1966 to 1971, producing 136 episodes, and was a solid performer in the Nielsen ratings.

In 1971, Thomas chose to end the series after five years. Both ABC and the show&#x27;s sponsor, Clairol, wanted the series finale to be a wedding between the two central characters, but Thomas rebuffed them, saying that she felt it was the wrong message to send to her female audience, because it would give the impression that the only happy ending is marriage. &quot;That Girl&quot; has since become popular in syndication.

Clairol was our sponsor and they wanted to end the show with a wedding. I said, &quot;I just can&#x27;t do that to these women and girls who followed Ann Marie&#x27;s adventure. I can&#x27;t now say that the only happy ending is a wedding, because I don&#x27;t believe it.&quot; There was a big ruckus about it, but I wouldn&#x27;t do it. The last show, Ann Marie took Donald to a women&#x27;s lib meeting, which made nobody happy but me. I loved it.

===Later career===

After &quot;That Girl&quot;, eager to expand her horizons, Thomas attended the Actors Studio, where she studied with Lee Strasberg until his death in 1982, and subsequently with his disciple Sandra Seacat. When she won her Best Dramatic Actress Emmy in 1986 for the television film &quot;Nobody’s Child&quot;, she thanked both individuals.

In 1972, she released a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot;, which was inspired by her young niece Dionne Gordon. She went on to create multiple recordings and television specials of and related to that title: &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot; (1972, 1974) and &quot;Free to Be... A Family&quot; (1987), with Christopher Cerf. Also in 1972, she served as a California delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida. She helped the George McGovern presidential campaign in October 1972 at Star-Spangled Women for McGovern–Shriver, reciting a parody of Erich Segal&#x27;s &quot;Love Story&quot; for 19,000 people at Madison Square Garden.

In 1973, Thomas joined Gloria Steinem, Patricia Carbine, and Letty Cottin Pogrebin as the founders of the Ms. Foundation for Women, the first women&#x27;s fund in the US. The organization was created to deliver funding and other resources to organizations that were presenting liberal women&#x27;s voices in communities nationwide.

In 1976, Thomas made a guest appearance on the NBC situation comedy &quot;The Practice&quot; as a stubborn patient of her father Danny Thomas&#x27; character Dr. Jules Bedford, and the chemistry of father and daughter acting together made for touching hospital-room scenes.

She has made guest appearances on several television series, including &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (as Judge Mary Conway Clark, a mentor of ADA Casey Novak), &quot;Ballers&quot;, &quot;The New Normal&quot;, &quot;Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later&quot;. She also narrated the series &quot;Happily Never After&quot; on Investigation Discovery. 

From 1996 to 2002, Thomas had a reoccurring role on the hit TV show, &quot;Friends&quot;. She played Rachel Green&#x27;s mother, Sandra Green, in three episodes. The role was poignant because of parallels to &quot;That Girl&quot;. Both shows were comedies about being young and single in New York City. Like Ann Marie three decades earlier, Rachel Green had left the suburbs for independence as a single woman in Manhattan. However, Thomas&#x27;s first appearance on &quot;Friends&quot; was in Season 2 when her character goes looking for her daughter, who had run off to Manhattan after ditching her fiancé, Barry, at the altar. Sandra confesses to Rachel that she is leaving her husband, expresses interest in being one of the girls, marijuana and what is new in sex. Sandra envies her daughter&#x27;s lifestyle, which she missed out on due to taking a more traditional path. When Rachel becomes upset at her mom&#x27;s frankness, Sandra explains that she thought Rachel of all people would understand because &quot;you didn&#x27;t marry your Barry, honey, but I married mine.&quot; In 2019, Thomas described her on-screen daughter, Rachel, as the &quot;That Girl&quot; of the late 90s and early 2000s. Thomas compared the on-air standards 30 years apart, noting that in &quot;That Girl&quot;, Donald could not even spend the night at Ann&#x27;s apartment, but on &quot;Friends&quot;, they were much more open about sex. Thomas also spoke of the great respect the &quot;Friends&quot; cast showed her when they worked together; they were familiar with her work and yielded to her comedic expertise. 

Thomas appeared in films such as &quot;Jenny&quot; (1970), &quot;Thieves&quot; (1977), &quot;In The Spirit&quot; (1990), &quot;The Real Blonde&quot; (1997), &quot;Starstruck&quot; (1998), &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo&quot; (1999), &quot;Playing Mona Lisa&quot; (2000), &quot;LOL&quot; (2012) with Demi Moore and Miley Cyrus, and &quot;Cardboard Boxer&quot; (2014). She also starred in television films, including &quot;It Happened One Christmas&quot; (1977; also produced) (a remake of &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;), &quot;The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck&quot; (1984; also produced), &quot;Consenting Adult&quot; (1985), &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child&quot; (1986; Best Dramatic Actress Emmy), &quot;Held Hostage: The Sis and Jerry Levin Story&quot; (1991; also produced), &quot;Reunion&quot; (1994; also produced), &quot;Deceit&quot; (2004; also produced), and &quot;Ultimate Betrayal&quot; (1994).

Thomas&#x27; Broadway theatre credits include &quot;Thieves&quot; (1974), &quot;Social Security&quot; (1986), and &quot;The Shadow Box&quot; (1994), and in 2011, she starred as Doreen in Elaine May&#x27;s comedy &quot;George Is Dead&quot; in &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot; during a set of three one-act plays (&quot;The New York Times&quot; called Thomas&#x27; performance &quot;sublime&quot;). The other two plays were written by Woody Allen and Ethan Coen.

Off-Broadway, Thomas has appeared in &quot;The Guys&quot;, &quot;The Exonerated&quot; (in which she also appeared in Chicago and Boston, co-starring with Brian Dennehy), &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; and &quot;Love, Loss, and What I Wore&quot;. Also off-Broadway, she appeared opposite Greg Mullavey in the 2015 New York debut of Joe DiPietro&#x27;s play &quot;Clever Little Lies&quot; at the Westside Theatre. Regional theatre productions include: &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; at the Hartford Stage; &quot;Woman In Mind&quot; at the Berkshire Theatre Festival; &quot;Paper Doll,&quot; with F. Murray Abraham at the Pittsburgh Public Theatre; and &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot; at the Cleveland Playhouse. In 1993, she toured in the national company of &quot;Six Degrees of Separation.&quot; In the spring of 2008, she starred in Arthur Laurents&#x27; last play, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; with Keith Carradine, at the George Street Playhouse.

Thomas has published seven best-selling books (three of them #1 best-sellers): &quot;Free to Be... You and Me;&quot; &quot;Free to Be... A Family;&quot; &quot;The Right Words at the Right Time&quot;; &quot;The Right Words at the Right Time, Volume 2: Your Turn&quot;; &quot;Marlo Thomas and Friends: Thanks &amp; Giving All Year Long&quot; (the CD version of which won the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children); her 2009 memoir, &quot;Growing Up Laughing&quot;; and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over...Till It&#x27;s Over: Reinventing Your Life and Realizing Your Dreams Anytime, At Any Age&quot;.

Thomas serves as the National Outreach Director for St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, which was founded by her father, Danny Thomas. She donated all royalties from her 2004 book and CD &quot;Marlo Thomas and Friends: Thanks &amp; Giving All Year Long&quot; (also produced with Christopher Cerf) and her two &quot;Right Words at the Right Time&quot; books to the hospital.

In 2010, Thomas created MarloThomas.com, a website for women aged 35+, associated with AOL and the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;.

==Honors==
Thomas is the recipient of four Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, a Grammy Award, a Jefferson Award, and the Peabody Award.

In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Thomas&#x27; name and picture.

In 1996, she was awarded the Women in Film Lucy Award in recognition of her excellence and innovation in her creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television.

On November 20, 2014, the Marlo Thomas Center for Global Education and Collaboration was opened as part of St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital. Hillary Clinton presided over the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

On November 24, 2014, President Barack Obama awarded Thomas the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor, at a White House ceremony.

==Personal life==
Thomas was in a long relationship with playwright Herb Gardner.

In 1977, Thomas was a guest on &quot;Donahue&quot;, the television talk show, when she and host Phil Donahue fell in &quot;love at first sight&quot;. They were married on May 21, 1980, and Donahue moved from Chicago to New York City with some of his sons and his daughter to live with Thomas and to produce his talk show there. Thomas is the stepmother to Donahue&#x27;s four sons and daughter from his first marriage. Concerning her relationship with her stepchildren, Thomas told &quot;AARP Magazine&quot; in May 2011:

Donahue died on August 18, 2024.

<text>Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Inc. () is a Latino non-profit social fraternity in the United States with 148 undergraduate chapters and 33 alumni associations.

It was founded on December 1, 1975, at Kean University (formerly known as Kean College) in Union, New Jersey. It was the first of several Latino fraternities to be established during the &quot;fuerza&quot; phase of the Latino collegiate Greek movement that defined much of the late 1970s and 1980s within the mainland United States. In 1992, Lambda Theta Phi was the first Latino Greek-lettered organization in the U.S. to join the North American Interfraternity Conference, which became the sole national umbrella conference of the fraternity after it rescinded its membership with the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations in 2014.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Inc. was founded on December 1, 1975, at Kean College in Union, New Jersey by a group of ten men of Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Ecuadorian descent. Alongside the support of brothers of the college&#x27;s oldest local social fraternity (Sigma Theta Chi) and a local veterans&#x27; fraternity (Alpha Sigma Mu). Prior to this, there were no Latin fraternities in the mainland United States at the undergraduate level with multiple active chapters. The Greek-letter organizations existing at the time primarily served Anglo and African-American demographics, with various Latin American focused organizations having long been dormant or in the process of becoming almost completely inactive at the undergraduate level. The founders of Lambda Theta Phi recognized a need to unite Latino students, nurture their leadership skills, emphasize the importance of education, and foster a commitment to community and culture. They saw the establishment of a fraternity as a means to achieve these goals, leading to the creation of Lambda Theta Phi, under the specific identity and name as a Latino fraternity. The creation of Lambda Theta Phi alongside fellow Kean College sorority Lambda Theta Alpha kickstarted the post-1975 wave of the Latino Greek Movement, which followed the &quot;principio&quot; (principle) phase kickstarted by student activism on college campuses in 1898 that led to the creation of fraternities like Phi Chi Delta and Phi Iota Alpha.

===1990s and 21st century===
Lambda Theta Phi has achieved several milestones, including becoming the first Latin fraternity to join the National Interfraternity Conference (NIC) in 1992. Additionally, the fraternity published &quot;The History of Lambda Theta Phi&quot; in 1994, authored by Jesus A. Peña, Esq., which serves as an authoritative text on its history.

The Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity Educational Foundation was established in 1998, aimed at awarding scholarships and grants for leadership and educational development. The fraternity also became a member of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO) in 2004, though it discontinued its membership in 2014.

== Chapters ==
The organization has 182 chapters made up of various undergraduate and alumni entities throughout the United States. 
==Notable members==
* Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Menendez – Former U.S. Senator from New Jersey (Honorary Brother)

==Hazing and misconduct controversies==
In 2007, The fraternity was temporarily suspended from Cornell University following a hazing incident on February 23, where pledges were subjected to physical and psychological abuse. A pledge reported being violently removed from a group by fraternity members, resulting in damage to property and being placed in a dark room where he was slapped. Two individuals involved were charged with second-degree hazing and harassment; one pled guilty to harassment and was fined, while the other remains pending a court appearance. Pledges also reported being forced to maintain a vow of silence, endure strenuous physical exercises, and were denied adequate sleep. In response, Cornell University banned the involved individuals from campus and initiated a review by the Fraternity and Sorority Affairs office. The fraternity would once again be suspended at the college in 2018 for more incidents of alleged hazing.

In 2017, Lambda Theta Phi was suspended after allegations of underage drinking, hazing, and sexual assault surfaced at the University of Central Florida. Reports indicated that pledges were coerced into exhausting physical and mental exercises while being subjected to fraternity chants containing racial slurs and threats of violence. One member was accused of sexually assaulting an intoxicated individual at a fraternity after-party. The University of Central Florida conducted an investigation, leading to the fraternity&#x27;s suspension from all campus activities.

For events in Fall 2022 and Spring 2023, the Phi chapter at University of Florida was investigated for hazing violations. Allegations included subjecting new members to food and sleep deprivation, forced alcohol consumption, forced calisthenics, and confinement to a specific location. The new members were reportedly required to wear uniforms, were prohibited from leaving or eating outside the location, and had to pay additional costs for this forced living arrangement. Members were also allegedly assigned numbers based on their height and referred to by their numbers rather than their names. The chapter was accused of continuing operations despite an Interim Suspension. As a result, the fraternity was suspended for five years, from Fall 2023 to Spring 2029, and its charter was revoked by its national organization.

In 2024, The fraternity&#x27;s chapter at the University of Connecticut was suspended following the arrest of the former chapter president on charges related to hazing activities. The individual was accused of physically assaulting a pledge who failed to complete push-up exercises, leading the victim to quit the fraternity. A second arrest was made on similar charges against the same individual. The university emphasized a zero-tolerance policy toward such behaviors and initiated an investigation into the incidents.

<doc id="797606" wikidata="Q3647792" url="?curid=797606" title="There Will Come Soft Rains (poem)">
<text>&quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; is a lyric poem by Sara Teasdale published just after the start of the 1918 German Spring Offensive during World War I, and during the 1918 flu pandemic about nature&#x27;s establishment of a new peaceful order that will be indifferent to the outcome of the war or mankind&#x27;s extinction. The work was first published in the July 1918 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;, and later revised and provided with the subtitle &quot;War Time&quot; in her 1920 collection &quot;Flame and Shadow&quot; (see 1920 in poetry). The &quot;War Time&quot; subtitle refers to several of her poems that contain &quot;War Time&quot; in their titles published during World War I, in particular to &quot;Spring In War Time&quot; that was published in her 1915 anthology &quot;Rivers to the Sea&quot; (see 1915 in poetry). The two poems, to the exclusion of all other of Teasdale works, appeared together in two World War I poetry anthologies, &quot;A Treasury of War Poetry: British and American Poems of the World War, 1914–1917&quot; published in 1917, and &quot;Poems of the War and the Peace&quot; published in 1921.

==Text==
The original publication of &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; does not contain the subtitle &quot;War Time&quot; that appears in the &quot;Flame and Shadow&quot; anthology, and &quot;circling&quot; in the second line was &quot;calling&quot; in the magazine. Quotation marks are included in the title, which is a stylistic convention used by the author that indicates the title is a phrase appearing in the first line of the poem.
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot;
(War Time)

There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pools singing at night,
And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;

Robins will wear their feathery fire
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree
If mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,
Would scarcely know that we were gone.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The poem includes six stanzas, each made up of a rhyming couplet in irregular tetrameters.

== Themes ==

=== Anti-war message ===
In &quot;Flame and Shadow&quot;, &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; is the first of the six poems in section VIII that dwell on loss caused by war—all of which reflect pacifist sentiments. The subtitle &quot;(War Time)&quot; of the poem, which appears in the &quot;Flame and Shadow&quot; version of the text, is a reference to Teasdale&#x27;s poem &quot;Spring In War Time&quot; that was published in &quot;Rivers to the Sea&quot; about three years earlier. &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; addresses four questions related to mankind&#x27;s suffering caused by the devastation of World War I that appear in &quot;Spring In War Time&quot;. The questions together ask how Nature can permit the Spring season to start while the war continues.
&lt;poem&gt;
Spring in War Time

I feel the Spring far off, far off,
 The faint far scent of bud and leaf—
Oh how can Spring take heart to come
 To a world in grief,
 Deep grief?

The sun turns north, the days grow long,
 Later the evening star grows bright—
How can the daylight linger on
 For men to fight,
 Still fight?

The grass is waking in the ground,
 Soon it will rise and blow in waves—
How can it have the heart to sway
 Over the graves,
 New graves?

Under the boughs where lovers walked
 The apple-blooms will shed their breath—
But what of all the lovers now
 Parted by death,
 Gray Death?
&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; expresses an anti-war message in that Nature, as personified by Spring, ignores the four questions asked by the poet in &quot;Spring In War Time&quot; by awakening even as war may destroy any meaning for mankind&#x27;s existence because such meaning, if it exists at all, only resides within mankind itself. In the poem, Nature proceeds indifferently to the outcome of war or human extinction as the personified Spring would &quot;not mind&quot; because Spring &quot;would scarcely know that we were gone&quot;.

=== The &quot;War Time&quot; subtitle and battlefield imagery ===
The Sedition Act of 1918 enacted two months before the original publication of &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; made it a criminal offense to &quot;willfully utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form of the Government of the United States&quot; and forced Teasdale to express her opposition to World War I &quot;obliquely&quot; in what might appear to be a pastoral poem. &quot;Flame and Shadow&quot; fell under the same regime of censorship since the Sedition Act was not repealed until December 13, 1920, but Teasdale revised her work to improve the chance that readers would perceive the implied battlefield imagery that, if made explicit, could have exposed her to criminal prosecution.

== Influences ==
Teasdale&#x27;s point of view in &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; that the universe has no caring interest in the existence or any actions of human beings developed from her readings of the works of Charles Darwin, which began in earnest in 1913. The same principle applies to all of the other living things mentioned in the poem. Thus, given that swallows, frogs, and robins must kill other creatures to feed themselves, the serenity in the poetic settings for them symbolizes the absence in their natures of war that is in human nature and not an idyllic world without violence.

== Adaptations ==
Choral arrangements titled &quot;There Will Be Soft Rains&quot; that incorporate all or parts of Teasdale&#x27;s poem as lyrics have been published by several composers and performed by numerous organizations. Below is a listed composer, the choral voice and instrument accompaniment arrangement, publisher, and publication year.

* Tom Vignieri, SSSAA with string orchestra, (publisher unknown 2010)
* Eriks Esenvalds, SSAATTBB a cappella, Music Baltica (2016)
* Christopher Tin, SSAATTBB with string orchestra, piano, and others, Decca Classics (2022)

A 1950 short story by Ray Bradbury shares the title and themes of the poem, and quotes it.

<doc id="797610" wikidata="Q353268" url="?curid=797610" title="Contrast ratio">
<text>The contrast ratio (CR) is a property of a display system, defined as the ratio of the luminance of the brightest shade (white) to that of the darkest shade (black) that the system is capable of producing. A high contrast ratio is a desired aspect of any display. It has similarities with dynamic range.

There is no official, standardized way to measure contrast ratio for a system or its parts, nor is there a standard for defining &quot;Contrast Ratio&quot; that is accepted by any standards organization so ratings provided by different manufacturers of display devices are not necessarily comparable to each other due to differences in method of measurement, operation, and unstated variables. Manufacturers have traditionally favored measurement methods that isolate the device from the system, whereas other designers have more often taken the effect of the room into account. An ideal room would absorb all the light reflecting from a projection screen or emitted by a cathode-ray tube, and the only light seen in the room would come from the display device. With such a room, the contrast ratio of the image would be the same as the contrast ratio of the device. Real rooms reflect some of the light back to the displayed image, lowering the contrast ratio seen in the image.

Static contrast ratio (or simultaneous contrast ratio) is the luminosity ratio comparing the brightest and darkest shade the system is capable of producing simultaneously at any instant of time, typically measured using ANSI checkerboard pattern; on the other hand, dynamic contrast ratio (or sequential contrast ratio) is the luminosity ratio comparing the brightest and darkest shade the system is capable of producing over time (or in one frame and another sequential frame), typically measured using the full on/full off method. Moving from a system that displays a static motionless image to a system that displays a dynamic, changing picture slightly complicates the definition of the contrast ratio, due to the need to take into account the extra temporal dimension to the measuring process.

== Methods of measurement ==

Many display devices favor the use of the &quot;full on/full off&quot; method of measurement, as it cancels out the effect of the room and results in an ideal ratio. Equal proportions of light reflect from the display to the room and back in both &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; measurements, as long as the room stays the same. This will inflate the light levels of both measurements proportionally, leaving the black-to-white luminance ratio unaffected.

Some manufacturers have gone as far as using different device parameters for the three tests, even further inflating the calculated contrast ratio. With DLP projectors, one method to do this is to enable the clear sector of the color filter wheel for the &quot;on&quot; part and disable it for the &quot;off&quot; part This practice is rather dubious, as it will be impossible to reproduce such contrast ratios with any useful image content.

Another measure is the &quot;ANSI contrast&quot;, in which the measurement is done with a checker board patterned test image where the black and white luminosity values are measured simultaneously. This is a more realistic measure of system capability, but includes the potential of including the effects of the room into the measurement, if the test is not performed in a room that is close to ideal.

It is useful to note that the &quot;full on/full off&quot; method effectively measures the dynamic contrast ratio of a display, while the &quot;ANSI contrast&quot; measures the static contrast ratio.

== Dynamic contrast ==
Some LED-backlit LCDs support technology called dynamic contrast (DC), also called advanced contrast ratio (ACR), smart contrast ratio (SCR), and various other designations. When there is a need to display a dark image, a display that supports dynamic contrast underpowers the backlight (or decreases the aperture of the projector&#x27;s lens using an iris), but proportionately amplifies the transmission through the LCD panel; this gives the benefit of realizing the potential static contrast ratio of the LCD panel in dark scenes when the image is watched in a dark room. The drawback is that if a dark scene contains small areas of superbright light, the resulting image will be over exposed.

The trick for the display is to determine how much of the highlights may be unnoticeably blown out in a given image under the given ambient lighting conditions.

Brightness, as it is most often used in marketing literature, refers to the emitted luminous intensity on screen, measured in candela per square metre (cd/m2). The higher the number, the brighter the screen.

It is also common to market only the dynamic contrast ratio capability of a display (when it is better than its static contrast ratio only on paper), which should not be directly compared to the static contrast ratio. A plasma display with a 4,000,000:1 static contrast ratio will show superior contrast to an LCD (with LED or CCFL backlight) with 30,000,000:1 dynamic and 20,000:1 static contrast ratio when the input signal contains a full range of brightnesses from 0 to 100% simultaneously. They will, however, be on par when input signal ranges only from 0 to 20% brightness.

== Contrast ratio in a real room ==
In marketing literature, contrast ratios for emissive (as opposed to reflective) displays are always measured under the optimum condition of a room in total darkness. In typical viewing situations, the contrast ratio is significantly lower due to the reflection of light from the surface of the display, making it harder to distinguish between different devices with very high contrast ratios. How much the room light reduces the contrast ratio depends on the luminance of the display, as well as the amount of light reflecting off the display.

A clean print at a typical movie theater may have a contrast ratio of 500:1, a transmissive digital projector is around 200:1, and a reflective digital projector (i.e. DLP) is around 500:1 under nearly ideal circumstances. A modern computer LCD monitor is typically at 1000:1, and TVs might be over 4000:1. Dynamic contrast ratio is usually measured at factory with two panels (one versus another) of the same model as each panel will have an inherent dark and light (hot) spot. Static is usually measured with the same screen showing half screen full bright vs half screen full dark. This usually results in a lower ratio as brightness will creep into the dark area of the screen thus giving a higher luminance.

<doc id="797615" wikidata="Q972672" url="?curid=797615" title="Intercession of saints">
<text>Intercession of the Saints is a Christian doctrine that maintains that saints can intercede for others. To intercede is to go or come between two parties, to plead before one of them on behalf of the other. In ecclesiastical usage both words are taken in the sense of the intervention primarily of Christ, and secondarily of the Blessed Virgin and the angels and saints, on behalf of men. The doctrine is held by the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Oriental Orthodox churches, and some Lutherans and Anglicans (chiefly those of Evangelical Catholic or Anglo-Catholic churchmanship, respectively). The practice of asking saints for their intercession can be found in Christian writings from the 3rd century onwards.

The 4th-century Apostles&#x27; Creed states belief in the communion of saints, which certain churches interpret as supporting the intercession of saints. However, similar practices are controversial in Judaism, Islam, and Protestantism.

== Biblical basis ==
===Intercession of the living for the living===
According to the Epistle to the Romans, the living can intercede for the living:

&quot;Now I (Paul) beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ&#x27;s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me&quot; (Romans 15:30).

Mary intercedes at the wedding at Cana and occasions Jesus&#x27;s first miracle. &quot;On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus&#x27; mother was there, and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. When the wine was gone, Jesus&#x27; mother said to him, &#x27;They have no more wine.&#x27; &#x27;Woman, why do you involve me?&#x27; Jesus replied. &#x27;My hour has not yet come.&#x27; His mother said to the servants, &#x27;Do whatever he tells you (John 2:1–5).

When God was displeased by the four men who had attempted to give advice to the patriarch Job, he said to them, &quot;My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly&quot; (Job 42:8).

Moses says to God, Forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now.&#x27; The Lord replied, &#x27;I have forgiven them, as you asked (Numbers 14:19–20).

The elders of the church can intercede for the sick people. &quot;Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven&quot; (James 5:14–15).

===Intercession of the living for the dead===

Some interpret 2 Timothy 1:16–18 to support prayer for the dead: &quot;The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.&quot;

The deuterocanonical book 2 Maccabees 12:43–46 speaks explicitly about the prayer of the living for the dead: &quot;And making a gathering, he sent twelve thousand drachms of silver to Jerusalem for sacrifice to be offered for the sins of the dead, thinking well and religiously concerning the resurrection, (For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should rise again, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to pray for the dead,) And because he considered that they who had fallen asleep with godliness, had great grace laid up for them. It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins.&quot;

===Intercession of the dead for the living===
Early Christians derived some of their views from Judaism. &quot;[A]t least some Jews in the first century believed that the angels in heaven were praying for those on earth and presenting their prayers to God. Those in heaven—Onias, Jeremiah, and the angels—were intimately involved in what was happening on earth.&quot; In Luke 15:7 Jesus says that those in heaven rejoice when a sinner repents. In Hebrews 12:1, the author refers to them as a &quot;cloud of witnesses&quot;. According to Fr. Lawrence, &quot;It was part of the Church&#x27;s faith in the first century that those in heaven interceded for those on earth.&quot;

Thomas Aquinas quotes Revelation 8:4: &quot;And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended up before God from the hand of the angel.&quot;

Both those for and against the intercession of saints quote Job 5:1: &quot;Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?&quot;

Christ&#x27;s parable of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19–31 indicates the ability of the dead to pray for the living.

The intercession of the dead for the living is shown in 2 Maccabees 15:14–17; an intercession on behalf of Israel by the late high priest Onias III plus that of Jeremiah, the prophet who died almost 400 years earlier. &quot;And Onias spoke, saying, &#x27;This is a man who loves the brethren and prays much for the people and the holy city, Jeremiah, the prophet of God.

== Catholic view ==

Catholic doctrine supports intercessory prayer to saints. This practice is an application of the doctrine of the Communion of saints. Some of the early basis for this was the belief that martyrs passed immediately into the presence of God and could obtain graces and blessings for others, which naturally and immediately led to their direct invocation. A further reinforcement was derived from the cult of the angels which, while pre-Christian in its origin, was heartily embraced by the faithful of the sub-Apostolic age.

Gregory of Nazianzus said of his deceased father: &quot;I am well assured that his intercession is of more avail now than was his instruction in former days, since he is closer to God, now that he has shaken off his bodily fetters, and freed his mind from the clay which obscured it&quot;; and Jerome wrote: &quot;If the Apostles and Martyrs, while still in the body, can pray for others, at a time when they must still be anxious for themselves, how much more after their crowns, victories, and triumphs are won! One man, Moses, obtains from God pardon for six hundred thousand men in arms; and Stephen, the imitator of the Lord, and the first martyr in Christ, begs forgiveness for his persecutors; and shall their power be less after having begun to be with Christ?&quot;

The doctrine of intercession and invocation was set forth by the Council of Trent, which teaches that &quot;... the saints who reign together with Christ offer up their own prayers to God for men. It is good and useful suppliantly to invoke them, and to have recourse to their prayers, aid, and help for obtaining benefits from God, through His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, Who alone is our Redeemer and Saviour&quot;.

Intercessory prayer to saintly persons who have not yet been beatified can also practiced by individuals, and evidence of miracles produced as a result of such prayer is very commonly produced during the formal process of beatification and canonization.

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church:

Some Catholic scholars have assessed invocation and intercession of the saints with a critical view toward the medieval tendencies of imagining the saints in heaven distributing favors to whom they will and instead seeing in proper devotion to the saints a means of response to God&#x27;s activity in us through these creative models of Christ-likeness.

In ecumenical conversations, agreement has been reached that &quot;asking the saints to intercede for us expresses the solidarity of the church wherein all are meant to be of mutual support to one another. Analogous to what is done among living persons, the request directed toward a saint to pray for us is a precise expression of solidarity in Jesus Christ, through the ages and across various modes of human existence&quot;.

Intercessory prayer to saints also plays an important role in the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches such as the Coptic Orthodox Church. In addition, some Anglo-Catholics believe in the intercession of the saints.

== Protestant views ==
With the exception of a few early Protestant churches, most modern Protestant churches strongly reject the intercession of the dead for the living, but they are in favor of the intercession of the living for the living according to Romans 15:30.

=== Lutheran views ===

The Lutheran confessions approve honoring the saints by thanking God for examples of his mercy, by using the saints as examples for strengthening the believers&#x27; faith, and by imitating their faith and other virtues. Although the Augsburg Confession rejects invoking the saints to ask for their help, it affirms that &quot;they pray for the Church universal in general&quot; in life and in heaven. The Augsburg Confession emphasizes that Christ is the only Mediator between God and man, and that He is therefore the only One to and through Whom Christians ought to pray. Though most Lutheran denominations do not, the Evangelical Community Church-Lutheran—a Lutheran denomination with Evangelical Catholic churchmanship—affirmed a belief in the intercession of saints.

With regard to the Virgin Mary specifically, Martin Luther advocated the use of the pre-Council of Trent version of the Hail Mary as a sign of reverence for and devotion to her. The 1522 &quot;Betbüchlein&quot; (Prayer Book) of Lutheranism thus retained the Ave Maria.

=== Anglican views ===
The first Anglican articles of faith, the &quot;Ten Articles&quot; (1536), defended the practice of praying to saints, while the &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot;, the official statement of religion produced in 1543, devotes an entire section to the importance of the &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (&quot;Hail Mary&quot;) prayer. However, the Thirty-nine Articles (1563) condemn &quot;invocation of saints&quot; as &quot;a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God&quot; (Article XXII).

Theologians within the Anglican Communion make a clear distinction between a &quot;Romish&quot; doctrine concerning the invocation of saints and what they view as the &quot;Patristic&quot; doctrine of intercession of the saints, permitting the latter, but forbidding the former. The bishop William Forbes termed the Anglican practice &quot;advocation of the saints&quot;, meaning &quot;asking for the saints to pray with them and on their behalf, not praying to them&quot;.

=== Calvinist views ===

Like Lutherans, strict Calvinists understand the &quot;communion of saints&quot; mentioned in the Apostles&#x27; Creed to consist of all believers, including those who have died, but invocation of departed saints is regarded as a transgression of the First Commandment.
Specifically, John Calvin in the Institutes of the Christian Religion (), believes that the Bible demonstrates that the central principle of worship is on the direct invocation of God. Calvin quotes Psalm 44, &quot;If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god, shall not God search this out?” The next principle Calvin brings out from the Bible is that all prayer must be done only through the intercession of Christ. Calvin teaches that in Hebrews 13:15, Christians are reminded that &quot;without the intervention of his priesthood our lips are not pure enough to celebrate the name of God&quot;. Because of the intercession of Christ, Calvin says that Christians can join the Apostle Paul and &quot;Pray without ceasing;&quot; (1 Thess:5:17). In contrast, Calvin believes that the practice of praying to saints is a demonstration of &quot;distrust, because they are either not contented with Christ as an intercessor or have altogether robbed him of this honour&quot;.

=== Methodist views ===
Article XIV of the Methodist Articles of Religion from 1784, echoing the Anglican Thirty-nine Articles, rejects invocation of saints by declaring the doctrine &quot;a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God&quot;.

== Parallels in other religions ==

=== Judaism ===
There is evidence of a Jewish belief in intercession, both in the form of the paternal blessings passed down from Abraham to his children, and 2 Maccabees, where Judas Maccabaeus sees the dead Onias and Jeremiah giving blessing to the Jewish army. In ancient Judaism, it was also popular to pray for intercession from Michael in spite of the rabbinical prohibition against appealing to angels as intermediaries between God and his people. There were two prayers written beseeching him as the prince of mercy to intercede in favor of Israel: one composed by Eliezer ha-Kalir, and the other by Judah ben Samuel he-Hasid. Those who oppose this practice feel that to God alone may prayers be offered.

In modern times, one of the greatest divisions in Jewish theology (&quot;hashkafa&quot;) is over the issue of whether one can beseech the help of a &quot;tzadik&quot; – an extremely righteous individual. The main conflict is over a practice of beseeching a &quot;tzadik&quot; who has already died to make intercession before the Almighty. This practice is common mainly among Chasidic Jews, but also found in varying degrees among other usually Chareidi communities. It strongest opposition is found largely among sectors of Modern Orthodox Judaism, Dor Daim and &quot;Talmide haRambam,&quot; and among aspects of the Litvish Chareidi community. Those who oppose this practice usually do so over the problem of idolatry, as Jewish Law strictly prohibits making use of a mediator (&quot;melitz&quot;) or agent (&quot;sarsur&quot;) between oneself and the Almighty.

The perspectives of those Jewish groups opposed to the use of intercessors is usually softer in regard to beseeching the Almighty alone merely in the &quot;merit&quot; (&quot;tzechut&quot;) of a &quot;tzadik&quot;.

Those Jews who support the use of intercessors claim that their beseeching of the &quot;tzadik&quot; is not prayer or worship, or alternatively that they are still praying &quot;to&quot; God &quot;and&quot; through God, but secondarily communicating with the &quot;tzadik&quot;. The conflict between the groups is essentially over what constitutes prayer, worship, a mediator (&quot;melitz&quot;), and an agent (&quot;sarsur&quot;).

=== Islam ===

Tawassul is the practice of using someone as a means or an intermediary in a supplication directed towards God. An example of this would be such: &quot;O my Lord, help me with [such and such need] due to the love I have for Your Prophet.&quot;

Some Shi&#x27;a practice seeking intercession from saints, in particular from Muhammad&#x27;s son-in-law, Ali and Ali&#x27;s son, Husayn. According to Muhammad al-Baqir, Walayah toward Ali is viewed as the essential criterion of both faith and salvation.

=== Mandaeism ===
The names of uthras (celestial beings in the World of Light) in Mandaean prayers, such as the canonical prayers of the Qulasta. Some of these prayers, such as the &quot;Asut Malkia&quot; (Qulasta prayer 105) and &quot;Ṭabahatan&quot; prayer (Qulasta prayer 170), have long lists of ancestors, uthras, and prophets such as Adam and John the Baptist.

=== Serer religion ===
In the religion of the Serer people of Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania, some of their ancient dead are taken as, in an analogy, holy saints, called &quot;Pangool&quot; in the Serer language. These ancient ancestors act as interceders between the living world and their supreme deity &quot;Roog&quot;.

<doc id="797616" wikidata="Q2069940" url="?curid=797616" title="Chipping Ongar">
<text>Chipping Ongar () is a market town and former civil parish, now in the parish of Ongar, in the Epping Forest District of the county of Essex, England. It is located east of Epping, southeast of Harlow and northwest of Brentwood. In 2020 the built-up area had an estimated population of 6420.

==Origin of the name==
The name &quot;Ongar&quot; means &quot;grass land&quot; (cognate with the German word ). &quot;Chipping&quot; is from Old English , &quot;a market, a market-place&quot;, akin to Danish and Swedish ; the same element is found in other towns such as Chipping Norton, Chipping Sodbury, Chipping Barnet and Chipping (now High) Wycombe.

==History==
Ongar was an important market town in the Medieval era, at the centre of a hundred and has the remains of Ongar Castle, which was a Norman castle built in and demolished between 1558 and 1603. The Church of England parish church, St Martin&#x27;s, dates from the 11th century and shows signs of Norman work. A small window in the chancel is believed to indicate the existence of an anchorite&#x27;s cell in medieval times. The Gothic Revival architect C. C. Rolfe added the south aisle in 1884. St Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church in Greensted, west of Ongar, is believed to be the oldest wooden church in the world.

The future missionary and explorer David Livingstone lived in Chipping Ongar on the High Street in 1838 to &quot;receive instruction from Rev. Richard Cecil, the Ongar Congregational minister, while training for the ministry&quot;.

In 1961 the parish had a population of 1673. The civil parish of Chipping Ongar was abolished in 1965 when the new parish of Ongar was created, also incorporating the former area of the Greensted and Shelley civil parishes. The parish was part of Epping and Ongar Rural District until 1974 when it became part of the Epping Forest District.

Several of the small private-sector businesses that operated through to the closing decades of the 20th century have closed down or relocated as the economic focus of the region has been redirected, especially since the opening of the M11 motorway in the 1970s, to larger towns in west Essex, especially Harlow and Brentwood. Local planning policies have focused increasingly on residential development, and Ongar, like very many of the smaller towns in the green belt around London, can be viewed primarily as a dormitory town for commuters to London, Brentwood, Harlow and Chelmsford. However, the single-track railway branch line that connected Ongar to Epping (and thereby to London), operated by the London Underground, was closed in 1994. Ongar has a range of retail shops.

Jane Taylor (1783–1824), who wrote the words of &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot;, is buried at the United Reformed Church in Ongar.

There is a memorial window to Father Thomas Byles in St Helen&#x27;s Catholic Church. He was parish priest in Chipping Ongar from 1905 and perished on in 1912, refusing to leave in a lifeboat and staying to pray with the remaining passengers.

Ongar Grammar School in Chipping Ongar, a private school for boys, was opened as a boarding school in 1811 by William Stokes M.A. By 1845 the school was known as &#x27;Ongar Academy&#x27; (not connected to an academy school in the 21st-century sense). It was a private grammar school by 1874, Chignell Grammar School by 1882, and was closed in 1940, before the introduction of secondary education under the Education Act 1944 and the Tripartite System.

RAF Chipping Ongar (also known as Willingale) is a former World War II airfield. The airfield is approximately northeast of Chipping Ongar. Opened in 1943, it was used by both the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces. During the War it was used primarily as a bomber airfield. It was closed in 1959 after many years as a reserve airfield.

==Education==
Chipping Ongar Infant School, originally housed in Victorian school buildings off the High Street (behind Budworth Hall on the site of today&#x27;s Sainsbury&#x27;s), was re-located in the mid-1980s, merging with Chipping Ongar Junior School at Greensted Road, at the southern edge of the town, forming Chipping Ongar Primary School. A further primary school, Ongar Primary School, is beyond the northern end of Chipping Ongar in Shelley. Also within Shelley is The Ongar Academy, providing secondary education for Ongar.

==Geography==
Chipping Ongar is at the convergence of several old roads, between Chelmsford and Epping on an east–west axis and between Dunmow and Chigwell (beyond which is London) on a north–south axis. To the southeast lies Brentwood, on the old road to the former River Thames ferry crossing at Tilbury, though the building in the 1970s of the M11 and M25 motorways means that Ongar is no longer directly on a principal route for petrol tankers (and other less prominent vehicles) travelling from the current Dartford Crossing and the Thames Estuary oil refineries.

The civil parish of Ongar, which has a town council, includes from north-to-south Shelley, Chipping Ongar and Marden Ash, with Greensted to the southwest.

The central part of Ongar High Street comprises a widened main street of the type found in many older English towns whose status as market towns is believed to have originated during the (little chronicled) Saxon period. This historic thoroughfare is lined with over 70 listed buildings and protected by the Chipping Ongar Conservation Area, one of the first to be designated by Essex County Council nearly 50 years ago. The wide high street is used to permit some &#x27;no charge&#x27; short-term parking that benefits the local shops. The high street does, however, retain a very narrow stretch, with shops and houses either side very close to the road due to pavements that are barely adequate for two people to pass each other.

Much of the surrounding countryside is occupied by large mechanised farms devoted, for the most part, to arable agriculture. During the 20th century the proximity of London encouraged dairy farming, but the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s were characterised by the removal of hedges and an increase in average field sizes as cattle numbers diminished. This policy was gradually reversed from the 1990s with schemes to replant hedges and trees. The subsoil is of heavy clay, rendering the land too soggy in winter for sheep.

==Transport==

===Road===
Ongar is less than from Central London, from M11 Junction 7 Harlow and from M25 J28 Brentwood. The A414 runs from Chelmsford, through Ongar, to Harlow.

Parking restrictions operate throughout the town centre where a 20-minute no-return 2-hour scheme applies. Three pay-and-display car parks are available with a total 530 capacity.

Local residents have previously called for lowering of the current national speed limit between The Mulberry House and the Four Wantz roundabout on the A414 Chelmsford-bound. However, Essex Police&#x27;s senior traffic management officer, Adam Pipe, deemed lowering the speed limit &quot;inappropriate, as drivers would feel is not adequate and would not comply&quot;.

===Bus===
The main destinations served by buses are Brentwood, Chelmsford, Harlow and Epping. Routes are operated by Arriva Shires &amp; Essex, First Essex, Trustybus, Stephensons of Essex and SM Coaches. Epping Ongar Railway also operate a limited number of heritage bus services between Ongar and North Weald and also Epping on weekends and Bank Holidays.

===Railway===

Since the closure of the Central line branch between Epping and Ongar in 1994, there is no longer a commuter train service to/from the town. The Epping Ongar Railway operates steam and diesel heritage services on the former Central line track, from North Weald Station on Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays every hour to Ongar Station. It first operated (Sundays and Holidays only) between 2004 and 2007, and then after refurbishment again with the additional Saturday trains from May 2012.

The nearest London Underground station to the town is Epping, away, the terminus of the Central line. The closest railway station is Brentwood, also away, which is now served by the Elizabeth line. Harlow Town Station, a National Rail station operated by Abellio Greater Anglia, is to the north west.

<doc id="797617" wikidata="Q2495618" url="?curid=797617" title="Universal pragmatics">
<text>Universal pragmatics (UP), more recently placed under the heading of formal pragmatics, is the philosophical study of the necessary conditions for reaching an understanding through communication. The philosopher Jürgen Habermas coined the term in his essay &quot;What is Universal Pragmatics?&quot; where he suggests that human competition, conflict, and strategic action are attempts to achieve understanding that have failed because of modal confusions. The implication is that coming to terms with how people understand or misunderstand one another could lead to a reduction of social conflict.

By coming to an &quot;understanding,&quot; he means at the very least, when two or more social actors share the same meanings about certain words or phrases; and at the very most, when these actors are confident that those meanings fit relevant social expectations (or a &quot;mutually recognized normative background&quot;).

For Habermas, the goal of coming to an understanding is &quot;intersubjective mutuality ... shared knowledge, mutual trust, and accord with one another&quot;. In other words, the underlying goal of coming to an understanding would help to foster the enlightenment, consensus, and good will necessary for establishing socially beneficial norms. Habermas&#x27; goal is not primarily for subjective feeling alone, but for development of shared (intersubjective) norms which in turn establish the social coordination needed for practical action in pursuit of shared and individual objectives (a form of action termed &quot;communicative action&quot;).

As an interdisciplinary subject, universal pragmatics draws upon material from a large number of fields, from pragmatics, semantics, semiotics, informal logic, and the philosophy of language, through social philosophy, sociology, and symbolic interactionism, to ethics, especially discourse ethics, and on to epistemology and the philosophy of mind.

==History==
Universal pragmatics (UP) is part of a larger project to rethink the relationship between philosophy and the individual sciences during a period of social crisis. The project is within the tradition of Critical Theory, a program that traces back to the work of Max Horkheimer.

UP shares with speech act theory, semiotics, and linguistics an interest in the details of language use and communicative action. However, unlike those fields, it insists on a difference between the linguistic data that we &quot;observe&quot; in the &#x27;analytic&#x27; mode, and the &quot;rational reconstruction of the rules of symbol systems&quot; that each reader/listener possesses intuitively when interpreting strings of words. In this sense, it is an examination of the two ways that language usage can be analyzed: as an object of scientific investigation, and as a &#x27;rational reconstruction&#x27; of intuitive linguistic &#x27;know-how&#x27;.

==Goals and methods==
Universal pragmatics is associated with the philosophical method of &quot;rational reconstruction&quot;.

The basic concern in universal pragmatics is &quot;utterances&quot; (or &quot;speech acts&quot;) in general. This is in contrast to most other fields of linguistics, which tend to be more specialized, focusing exclusively on very specific sorts of utterances such as &quot;sentences&quot; (which in turn are made up of &quot;words&quot;, &quot;morphemes&quot;, and &quot;phonemes&quot;).

For Habermas, the most significant difference between a sentence and an utterance is in that sentences are judged according to how well they make sense &quot;grammatically&quot;, while utterances are judged according to their &quot;communicative validity&quot; (see section 1). (1979:31)

Universal pragmatics is also distinct from the field of sociolinguistics, because universal pragmatics is only interested in the meanings of utterances &quot;if they have to do with claims about truth or rightness&quot;, while sociolinguistics is interested in all utterances in their social contexts. (1979:31, 33)

==Three aspects of universal pragmatics==
There are three ways to evaluate an utterance, according to UP. There are &quot;theories that deal with elementary propositions&quot;, &quot;theories of first-person sentences&quot;, and &quot;theories of speech acts&quot;.

A theory of elementary propositions investigates those things in the real world that are being &quot;referenced&quot; by an utterance, and the things that are implied by an utterance, or &quot;predicate&quot; it. For example, the utterance &quot;The first Prime Minister of Canada&quot; refers to a man who went by the name of Sir John A. Macdonald. And when a speaker delivers the utterance, &quot;My husband is a lawyer&quot;, it implies that the speaker is married to a man.

A theory of first-person sentences examines the expression of the &quot;intentions&quot; of the actor(s) through language and in the first-person.

Finally, a theory of speech acts examines the setting of standards for interpersonal relations through language. The basic goal for speech act theory is to explain how and when utterances in general are &quot;performative&quot;. (1979:34) Central to the notion of speech acts are the ideas of illocutionary force and perlocutionary force, both terms coined by philosopher J.L. Austin. &quot;Illocutionary force&quot; describes the intent of the speaker, while &quot;perlocutionary force&quot; means &quot;the effect an utterance has in the world&quot;, or more specifically, the effect on others.

A performative utterance is a sentence where an action being performed is done by the utterance itself. For example: &quot;I inform you that you have a moustache&quot;, or &quot;I promise you I will not burn down the house&quot;. In these cases, the words are also taken as significant actions: the act of informing and promising (respectively).

Habermas adds to this the observation that speech acts can either succeed or fail, depending on whether or not they succeed on &quot;influencing&quot; another person in the intended way. (1979:35)

This last method of evaluation—the theory of speech acts—is the domain that Habermas is most interested in developing as a &quot;theory of communicative action&quot;.

==Communicative action==

There are a number of ways to approach Habermas&#x27;s project of developing a formal pragmatic analysis of communication. Because Habermas developed it in order to have a normative and philosophical foundation for his critical social theory, most of the inroads into formal pragmatics start from sociology, specifically with what is called action theory. Action theory concerns the nature of human action, especially the manner in which collective actions are coordinated in a functioning society.

The coordination and integration of social action has been explained in many ways by many theories. Rational choice theory and game theory are two examples, which describe the integration of individuals into social groups by detailing the complex manner in which individuals motivated only by self-interest will form mutually beneficial and cooperative social arrangements. In contrast to these, Habermas has formulated a theory of &quot;communicative action&quot;. (Habermas 1984; 1987) This theory and the project of developing a formal pragmatic analysis of communication are inseparable.

Habermas makes a series of distinctions in the service of explaining social action. The first major differentiation he makes is between two social realms, &quot;the system&quot; and &quot;the lifeworld&quot;. These designate two distinct modes of social integration:
* The kind of social integration accomplished in the system is accomplished through &quot;the functional integration of the consequences of actions&quot;. It bypasses the consciousness of individuals and does not depend upon their being oriented towards acting collectively. Economic and industrial systems are great examples, often producing complex forms of social integration and interdependence despite the openly competitive orientations of individuals.
* The social integration accomplished in the lifeworld, by contrast, depends upon &quot;the coordination of action plans and the conscious action-orientations of individuals&quot;. It relies on processes of human interaction involving symbolic and cultural forms of meaning. More specifically, as Habermas maintains, the coordination of the lifeworld is accomplished through communicative action.

Thus, communicative action is an indispensable facet of society. It is at the heart of the lifeworld and is, Habermas claims, responsible for accomplishing several fundamental social functions: reaching understanding, cultural reproduction, coordinating action-plans, and socializing individuals.

However, Habermas is quick to note, different modes of interaction can (in some ways) facilitate these social functions and achieve integration within the lifeworld. This points towards the second key distinction Habermas makes, which differentiates &quot;communicative action&quot; from &quot;strategic action&quot;. The coordination of action plans, which constitutes the social integration of the lifeworld, can be accomplished either through consensus or influence.

Strategic action is action oriented towards success, while communicative action is action oriented towards understanding. Both involve the symbolic resources of the lifeworld and occur primarily by way of linguistic interaction. On the one hand, actors employing communicative actions draw on the uniquely impelling force of mutual understanding to align the orientation of their action plans. It is this subtle but insistent binding force of communicative interactions that opens the door to an understanding of their meanings. On the other hand, actors employing strategic actions do not exploit the potential of communication that resides in the mutual recognition of a shared action-oriented understanding. Instead strategic actors relate to others with no intention of reaching consensus or mutual understanding, but only the intention of accomplishing pre-determined ends unrelated to reaching an understanding. Strategic action often involves the use of communicative actions to achieve the isolated intentions of individuals, manipulating shared understanding in the service of private interests. Thus, Habermas claims, strategic action is parasitic on communicative action, which means communicative action is the primary mode of linguistic interaction. Reaching a reciprocally defined understanding is communication&#x27;s basic function.

Keeping in mind this delineation of the object domain, the formal pragmatics of communication can be more readily laid out. The essential insight has already been mentioned, which is that communication is responsible for irreplaceable modes of social integration, and this is accomplished through the unique binding force of a shared understanding. This is, in a sense, the pragmatic piece of formal pragmatics: communication does something in the world. What needs to be explained are the conditions for the possibility of what communication already does. This is, in a sense, the formal piece of formal pragmatics: a rational reconstruction of the deep generative structures that are the universal conditions for the possibility of a binding and compelling mutual understanding.

From here, Habermas heads the analysis in two directions. In one direction is a kind of linguistic analysis (of speech acts), which can be placed under the heading of the validity dimensions of communication. The other direction entails a categorization of the idealized presuppositions of communication.

===Communicative competence===

Habermas argues that when speakers are communicating successfully, they will have to defend their meaning by using these four claims.

# That they have &quot;uttered something&quot; understandably — or &quot;their statements are intelligible&quot;;
# That they have given other people &quot;something to understand&quot; — or are speaking &quot;something true&quot;;
# That &quot;the speaker&quot; is therefore understandable — or their &quot;intentions are recognized and appreciated&quot; for what they are; and,
# That they have come to an understanding &quot;with another person&quot; — or, they have used &quot;words that both actors can agree upon&quot;. (1979:4)

Habermas is emphatic that these claims are universal—no human communication oriented at achieving mutual understanding could possibly fail to raise all of these validity claims. Additionally, to illustrate that all other forms of communication are derived from that which is oriented toward mutual understanding, he argues that there are no other kinds of validity claims whatsoever. This is important, because it is the basis of Habermas&#x27; critique of postmodernism.

The fundamental orientation toward mutual understanding is at the heart of universal pragmatics, as Habermas explains:
&quot;The task of universal pragmatics is to identify and reconstruct universal conditions of possible mutual understanding... other forms of social action—for example, conflict, competition, strategic action in general—are derivatives of action oriented toward reaching understanding. Furthermore, since language is the specific medium of reaching understanding at the sociocultural stage of evolution, I want to go a step further and single out explicit speech actions from other forms of communicative action.&quot;

Any meaning that meets the above criteria, and is recognized by another as meeting the criteria, is considered &quot;vindicated&quot; or &quot;communicatively competent&quot;.

In order for anyone to speak validly — and therefore, to have his or her comments vindicated, and therefore reach a genuine consensus and understanding — Habermas notes that a few more fundamental commitments are required. First, he notes, actors &quot;have to treat this formulation of validity so seriously that it might be a precondition for any communication at all&quot;. Second, he asserts that &quot;all actors must believe that their claims are able to meet these standards of validity&quot;. And third, he insists that there must be a common conviction among actors that all validity claims &quot;are either already vindicated or could be vindicated&quot;.

===Examining the validity of speech===

Habermas claims that communication rests upon a non-egoistic understanding of the world, which is an idea he borrowed from thinkers like Jean Piaget. A subject capable of a de-centered understanding can take up three fundamentally different attitudes to the world. Habermas refers to such attitudes as &quot;dimensions of validity&quot;. Specifically, this means individuals can recognize different standards for validity—i.e., that the validation of an empirical truth claim requires different methods and procedures than the validation of subjective truthfulness, and that both of those require different methods and procedures of validation than claims to normative rightness.

These dimensions of validity can be summarized as claims to &quot;truth (IT), truthfulness (I),&quot; and &quot;rightness (WE)&quot;. So the ability to differentiate between the attitudes (and their respective &quot;worlds&quot;) mentioned above should be understood as an ability to distinguish between types of validity claims.

M. Cooke provided the only book length treatment of Habermas&#x27;s communication theory. Cooke explains:
:&quot;when we adopt an objectifying attitude we relate, in the first instance to the objective world of facts and existing states of affairs [IT]; when we adopt a norm-conformative attitude we relate, in the first instance, to the social world of normatively regulated interactions [WE]; when we adopt an expressive attitude we relate, in the first instance to the subjective world of inner experience [I]&quot;. (Cooke 1994)

This is fundamental to Habermas&#x27;s analysis of communication. He maintains that the performance of any speech act necessarily makes reference to these dimensions of validity, by raising at least three validity claims.

One way to grasp this idea is to take an inventory of the ways in which an attempt at communication can misfire, the ways a speech act can fail. A hearer may reject the offering of a speech act on the grounds that it is invalid because it:
# presupposes or explicates states of affairs which are not the case (IT);
# does not conform to accepted normative expectations (WE);
# raises doubts about the intentions or sincerity of the speaker (I).

Of course, from this it follows that a hearer who accepts the offering of a speech act does so on the grounds that it is valid because it:
# presupposes or explicates states of affairs that are true (IT);
# conforms to accepted normative expectations (WE);
# raises no doubts concerning the intentions or sincerity of the speaker (I).

This means that when engaging in communication the speaker and hearer are inescapably oriented to the validity of what is said. A speech act can be understood as an offering, the success or failure of which depends upon the hearer&#x27;s response of either accepting or rejecting the validity claims it raises. The three dimensions of validity pointed out above are implicated in any attempt at communication.

Thus, communication relies on its being embedded within relations to various dimensions of validity. Any and every speech act is infused with inter-subjectively recognized claims to be valid. This implicitly ties communication to argumentation and various discursive procedures for the redemption of validity claims. This is true because to raise a validity claim in communication is to simultaneously imply that one is able to show, if challenged, that one&#x27;s claim is justified. Communication is possible because speakers are accountable for the validity of what they say. This assumption of responsibility on the part of the speaker is described by Habermas as a &quot;warranty&quot;, because in most cases the validity claims raised during communication are taken as , and communication proceeds on that basis. Similarly, hearers are accountable for their stance taken up in relation to the validity claims raised by the speaker. Both speaker and hearer are bound to the validity claims raised by the utterances they share during communication. They are bound by the weak obligations inherent in pursuing actions oriented towards reaching an understanding. Habermas would claim that this obligation is a rational one:

:&quot;With every speech act, by virtue of the validity claims it raises, the speaker enters into an interpersonal relationship of mutual obligation with the hearer: The speaker is obliged to support her claims with reasons, if challenged, and the hearer is obliged to accept a claim unless he has good reason not to do so. The obligation in question is, in the first instance, not a moral one but a rational one -- the penalty of failure to fulfill it is the charge not of immorality but of irrationality -- although clearly the two will often overlap&quot; (Cooke, 1994).

This begins to point towards the idea of communicative rationality, which is the potential for rationality that is implicit in the validity basis of everyday communication, the shape of reason that can be extracted from Habermas&#x27;s formal-pragmatic analyses.

:&quot;The modern -- decentered -- understanding of the world has opened up different dimensions of validity; to the extent that each dimension of validity has its own standards of truth and falsity and its own modes of justification for determining these, one may say that what has been opened up are dimensions of rationality&quot; (Cooke, 1994).

However, before the idea of communicative rationality can be described, the other direction of Habermas&#x27;s formal pragmatic analyses of communication needs to be explained. This direction looks towards the idealized presuppositions of communication.

===Ideal presuppositions of communication===

When individuals pursue actions oriented towards reaching an understanding, the speech acts they exchange take on the weight of a mutually recognized validity. This means each actor involved in communication takes the other as accountable for what they have said, which implies that good reasons could be given by all to justify the validity of the understanding that is being achieved. Again, in most situations the redemption of validity claims is not an explicit undertaking (except in &quot;discourses&quot;, see below). Instead, each actor issues a &quot;warranty&quot; of accountability to the other, which only needs to be redeemed if certain validity claims are thrown into question. This suggests that the validity claims raised in every communicative interaction implicitly tie communication to argumentation.

It is here that the idealized presuppositions of communication arise. Habermas claims that all forms of argumentation, even implicit and rudimentary ones, rest upon certain &quot;idealizing suppositions,&quot; which are rooted in the very structures of action oriented towards understanding. These &quot;strong idealizations&quot; are always understood as at least approximately satisfied by participants in situations where argumentation (and communication) is thought to be taking place. Thus, when during communication it is discovered that the belief that these presuppositions are satisfied is not justified it is always taken as problematic. As a result, steps are usually taken to reestablish and maintain the belief that they are approximately satisfied, or communication is simply called off.

# The most basic of these idealized presuppositions is the presupposition that &quot;participants in communicative exchange are using the same linguistic expressions in the same way&quot;. This is an obvious but interesting point, which clearly illustrates what an idealized presupposition is. It is a presupposition because communication would not proceed if those involved did not think it was at least approximately satisfied (in this case that a shared language was being used). It is idealized because no matter how closely it is approximated it is always counterfactual (because, in this case, the fact is that all meanings are to some degree personally defined).
# Another, basic idealized presupposition of argumentation is the presupposition that &quot;no relevant argument is suppressed or excluded by the participants&quot;.
# Another is the presupposition that &quot;no persuasive force except that of the better argument is exerted&quot;.
# There is also the presupposition that &quot;all the participants are motivated only by a concern for the better argument&quot;.
# There is the presupposition of attributing a &quot;context-transcending significance to validity claims&quot;. This presupposition is controversial but important (and becomes expanded and clarified in the presuppositions of discourse, see below). The idea is that participants in communication instill their claims with a validity that is understood to have significance beyond the specific context of their agreement.
# The presupposition that &quot;no validity claim is exempt in principle from critical evaluation in argumentation&quot;;
# The presupposition that &quot;everyone capable of speech and action is entitled to participate&quot;, and everyone is equally entitled to introduce new topics or express attitudes needs or desires.

In sum, all these presuppositions must be assumed to be approximately satisfied in any situation of communication, despite their being necessarily counterfactual. Habermas refers to the positing of these idealized presuppositions as the &quot;simultaneously unavoidable and trivial accomplishments that sustain communicative action and argumentation&quot;.

Habermas calls &quot;discourses&quot; those forms of communication that come sufficiently close to actually satisfying these presuppositions. Discourses often occur within institutionalized forms of argumentation that self-reflectively refine their procedures of communication, and as a result, have a more rigorous set of presuppositions in addition to the ones listed above.

A striking feature of discourse is that validity claims tend to be explicitly thematized and there is the presupposition that all possible interlocutors would agree to the universal validity of the conclusions reached. Habermas especially highlights this in what he calls &quot;theoretical discourses&quot; and &quot;practical discourses&quot;. These are tied directly to two of the three dimensions of validity discussed above: theoretical discourse being concerned with validity claims thematized regarding objective states of affairs (IT); practical discourse being concerned with validity claims thematized concerning the rightness of norms governing social interactions (WE).

Habermas understands presupposition (5) to be responsible for generating the self-understanding and continuation of theoretical and practical discourses. Presupposition (5) points out that the validity of an understanding reached in theoretical or practical discourse, concerning some factual knowledge or normative principle, is always expanded beyond the immediate context in which it is achieved. The idea is that participants in discourses such as these presuppose that any understanding reached could attain universal agreement concerning its universal validity if these discourses could be relieved of the constraints of time and space. This idealized presupposition directs discourses concerning truth and normative certainty beyond the contingencies of specific communicative situations and towards the idealized achievements of universal consensus and universal validity. It is a rational reconstruction of the conditions for the possibility of earnest discourses concerning facts and norms. Recall that, for Habermas, rational reconstructions aim at offering the most acceptable account of what allows for the competencies already mastered by a wide range of subjects. In order for discourse to proceed, the existence of facts and norms must be presupposed, yet the certainty of an absolute knowledge of them must be, in a sense, postponed.

Striking a Piagetian and Peircean chord, Habermas understands the deep structures of collective inquiry as developmental. Thus, the presupposition shared by individuals involved in discourse is taken to reflect this. The pursuit of truth and normative certainty is taken to be motivated and grounded, not in some objective or social world that is treated as a &quot;given&quot;, but rather in a learning process. Indeed, Habermas himself is always careful to formulate his work as a research project, open to refinement.

In any case, reconstructing the presuppositions and validity dimensions inherent to communication is valuable because it brings into relief the inescapable foundations of everyday practices. Communicative action and the rudimentary forms of argumentation that orient the greater part of human interaction cannot be left behind. By reconstructing the deep structures of these Habermas has discovered a seed of rationality planted in the very heart of the lifeworld. Everyday practices, which are common enough to be trivial, such as reaching an understanding with another, or contesting the reasons for pursuing a course of action, contain an implicit and idealized rationality.

In other words, communication is always somewhat rational. Communication could not occur if the participants thought that the speech acts exchanged did not carry the weight of a validity for which those participating could be held accountable. Nor would anyone feel that a conclusion was justified if it was achieved by any other means than the uncoerced force of the better argument. Nor could the specialized discourses of law, science and morality continue if the progress of knowledge and insight was denied in favor of relativism.

====Criticism====
It is a question how appropriate it is to speak of &quot;communication&quot; without tense, and of &quot;everyday practices&quot; as though they cut across all times and cultures. That they do cannot be assumed, and anthropology provides evidence of significant difference. It is possible to ignore these facts by limiting the scope of universal pragmatics to current forms of discourse, but this runs the risk of contradicting Habermas&#x27;s own demand for (5). Moreover, the initial unease with the classical and liberal views of rationality had to do precisely with their ahistorical character and refusal, or perhaps inability, to acknowledge their own origins in circumstances of the day. Their veneer of false universality torn off by the likes of Foucault, it remains to be seen whether &quot;universal&quot; pragmatics can stand up to the same challenges posed by deconstruction and skepticism.

<doc id="797619" wikidata="Q2030697" url="?curid=797619" title="Scream (band)">
<text>Scream is an American hardcore punk band from Washington, D.C.; they originally formed in the suburb of Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads, Virginia. Scream originally formed in 1981 within the vanguard of the Washington Hardcore explosion. In 2009, the band reunited, and were on tour in Europe. As of 2017, the band was still touring in both America and the United Kingdom.

==History==

Scream was formed in Northern Virginia in 1981 by singer Pete Stahl, his brother Franz Stahl on guitar, bassist Skeeter Thompson, and Kent Stax, who replaced original drummer Steve Atton shortly after the band formed. Scream emerged at the tail end of the first wave of Washington, D.C., hardcore and would go on to outlast many of their fellow bands from D.C.&#x27;s early hardcore punk scene. Along with bands such as Minor Threat and Government Issue, Scream merged the attributes of the movement, including fast tempos, sociopolitical lyrics, deliberately unpretentious attitude, and a shunning of commercialism.

Recording their music in the basement of Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, Virginia, Scream was the first band on D.C.&#x27;s independent Dischord Records label to release a full-length album as opposed to the 7-inch or 12-inch EPs that comprised Dischord&#x27;s catalogue up to that point.

For their second album, Scream added another guitarist to their line-up, Robert Lee &quot;Harley&quot; Davidson, to thicken up the sound in the studio and in their live performances. In turn this yielded a dual-lead guitar style and intricate interplay between the musicians on the band&#x27;s third album. For selected compilation efforts and some live shows Scream added DC keyboard player Bobby Madden during this period. 

After the third album &quot;Banging the Drum&quot;, Stax left the band for personal reasons and was replaced by then 17-year-old local drummer Dave Grohl who lied to the band about his age in order to tour with them. Grohl joined the band in the studio to record their fourth album &quot;No More Censorship&quot; for which the band opted a release through reggae label RAS Records instead of Dischord. The band then toured Europe in the spring of 1990, during which time their show in Alzey, Germany was recorded for release on &quot;Your Choice Live Series Vol.10&quot;. Scream then recorded their fifth studio album, &quot;Fumble&quot;, which didn&#x27;t see release until 1993, three years after the group&#x27;s break-up.

=== Post-breakup and one-off tours ===
After Scream&#x27;s break up, Grohl moved to Seattle to play drums for the rock band Nirvana, while Pete and Franz remained in North Hollywood and started the rock band Wool.

To coincide with the belated release of the album &quot;Fumble&quot;, the Stahl/Stahl/Thompson/Grohl lineup of Scream toured North America in the summer of 1993. The Stahl/Stahl/Thompson/Grohl lineup of Scream performed at The Dragonfly, in Los Angeles, in August 1994, for a one-off &quot;mini reunion&quot; with Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against The Machine sitting in on the song &quot;Human Behavior&quot;. The Stahl/Stahl/Davidson/Thompson/Stax lineup of Scream then reformed to play a one-off reunion show at the Black Cat nightclub in Washington, D.C., on December 28, 1996, with Grohl joining the band on drums for the song &quot;No More Censorship&quot;. This performance was later released as &quot;Live at the Black Cat&quot; in 1998 on Torque Records.

In 1997, Franz Stahl joined Grohl&#x27;s newly formed group, the Foo Fighters, for a two-year stint. During this time, Pete Stahl worked as a road manager for both the Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age while continuing to record albums with several bands, including the Earthlings? and Goatsnake. Thompson remained in the D.C. area and continued to work in bands, including playing one gig at the Brickskeller in the spring of 1994 as Scream with keyboardist Robert Hunter, as did Stax with the Skinhead/Oi!-tinged bands: the Suspects, United 121, Spitfires United, and Alleged Bricks. Stax also committed himself to a family life. Davidson moved to Los Angeles and joined The Drills from 1989 to 1991. He returned to the D.C. area and formed the band Orangahead in the mid 1990s with Thompson and then joined up with the Baltimore-based punk band Jakkpot in 1998 for a European tour. Davidson went on to form new bands Festival of Fools and God is Dead.

===Reunion===

The original line-up of the band played a reunion show on December 20, 2009, once again at the Black Cat. An ad hoc lineup consisting of Pete Stahl (vocals), Grohl (electric guitar), Thompson (bass) and Stax (drums) performed &quot;Choke Word&quot; and two Bad Brains covers at the 9:30 Club&#x27;s 30th anniversary bash on May 31, 2010.

In 2011, the original line-up of Scream recorded the &quot;Complete Control Sessions&quot; EP at Grohl&#x27;s Studio 606 in Los Angeles. It was issued on vinyl and digital download. The following year, the band did a European tour.

In March 2018, Pete Stahl announced that their 1988 album &quot;No More Censorship&quot; would be reissued on April 27, 2018.

Stax died from cancer on September 20, 2023. By the next month he had been replaced by Jerry Busher.

Scream released the album &quot;DC Special&quot; on November 10, 2023 on Dischord Records.

<text>Thomas Sturge Moore (4 March 1870 – 18 July 1944) was a British poet, author and artist.

==Biography==
Sturge Moore was born at 3 Wellington Square, Hastings, East Sussex, on 4 March 1870 and educated at Dulwich College, the Croydon School of Art and Lambeth School of Art. In Lambeth he studied under the wood-engraver Charles Roberts. He was a long-term friend and correspondent of W. B. Yeats, who was to describe him as &quot;one of the most exquisite poets writing in England&quot;. He was also a playwright, writing a &quot;Medea&quot; influenced by Yeats&#x27; drama and the Japanese Noh style. As a wood-engraver and artist he designed the covers for poetry editions of Yeats and others, as well as illustrating books for the Vale Press of Charles Ricketts.
He was a prolific poet and his subjects included morality, art and the spirit writing in a &#x27;severely classical tone&#x27;, according to poet/critic Yvor Winters. His first pamphlet, &quot;Two Poems&quot;, was printed privately in 1893 and his first book of verse, &quot;The Vinedresser&quot;, was published in 1899. His love for poetry led him to become an active member of the Poetry Recital Society.

In 1901, Moore, with Yeats, Laurence Binyon, Charles Ricketts, and Ethel and Sybil Pye, formed the Literary Theatre Club. Moore&#x27;s first (of 31) play to be produced, a copyright reading of &quot;Aphrodite against Artemis&quot;, was the first production staged by the club, at the Dalston Theatre on 30 July 1901. Yeats described the play as &quot;powerful with a beautiful constrained passion.&quot;

In 1913 Moore nominated Rabindranath Tagore the Indian poet for the Nobel Prize in literature.

Moore received a civil list pension of £75 per annum in 1920 in recognition of his contribution to literature. In 1930 he was nominated as one of seven candidates for the position of Poet Laureate. He suffered from chronic ill health, suffering a series of heart attacks in 1942 and 1943, and died on 18 July 1944 at a convalescent home, St Andrews Cottage in Clewer, Windsor, Berkshire, from a kidney infection following a prostate operation.

He was cremated at Woking. His ashes were scattered near Petersfield in August 1953.

==Family==
Sturge Moore adopted the use of his middle name &#x27;Sturge&#x27; (his mother&#x27;s family name) as a way of avoiding confusion with the poet Thomas Moore.

On 26 November 1903 Moore married Marie Appia, niece of Louis Appia, a founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and cousin of the Swiss stage designer Adolphe Appia. They had two children: Daniel Sturge-Moore, journalist and broadcaster; and Henriette Sturge-Moore (1907–1995), prominent theatre designer, teacher and interior decorator.

Moore was the brother of the Bloomsbury philosopher George Edward Moore, one of the founders of the Analytic tradition in philosophy, and uncle of Nicholas Moore, New Apocalyptics poet of the 1940s, and of the composer Timothy Moore.

<text>The Nauvoo Illinois Temple is the 113th dedicated temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The intent to build the temple was announced on April 4, 1999, by church president Gordon B. Hinckley during general conference. It is the third temple built in Illinois (after the original Nauvoo and Chicago Illinois temples).

The temple has an attached end tower with a statue of the angel Moroni. This temple’s architecture was designed to replicate the original Nauvoo Temple, which was designed by Joseph Smith. A groundbreaking ceremony, to signify the beginning of construction, was held on October 24, 1999, and was conducted Hinckley. 

==History==
Located in the town of Nauvoo, the temple&#x27;s construction was announced on April 4, 1999, by church president Gordon B. Hinckley. Groundbreaking was conducted on October 24, 1999 and the cornerstones were laid November 5, 2000, with Hinckley presiding over both ceremonies. The structure itself was built in the Greek Revival to replicate the architectural style of the original Nauvoo Temple, using limestone block quarried in Russellville, Alabama.

The origins of the new temple go back to 1937 when Wilford C. Wood purchased some of the land on behalf of the LDS Church and purchased another piece of land that he later sold to the church. He also organized a group of church members from the Chicago Illinois Stake, co-led by Ariel S. Williams, to clear and beautify the recently purchased land. At the time, the Chicago Stake was one of only two east of the Mississippi River.

Wood purchased land in 1951 that included a house which was made a visitors&#x27; center for the temple site. In the late-1950s, and then in 1962, agents for the LDS Church completed purchase of the temple lot.

Following construction, an open house was held from May 6-June 22, 2002. The temple was dedicated by Hinckley on June 27, 2002. The dedication was broadcast via satellite to “2,300 locations throughout 72 countries and in 38 languages,” making it the first temple dedication to be broadcast internationally.

==Design and architecture ==
The Nauvoo Illinois Temple was designed to replicate the original Nauvoo Temple, which utilized a mix of architectural styles, incorporating elements of Roman, Grecian, and Gothic architecture. Designed by FFKR Architects, the temple&#x27;s architecture reflects both the cultural heritage of the Nauvoo region and its spiritual significance to the church.

The temple sits on a 3.3-acre plot, and the landscaping around the temple features a statue of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. 

=== Exterior ===
The building is constructed with limestone similar to the stone used for the original Nauvoo Temple. The exterior has a single attached end tower with an angel Moroni statue, along with other elements chosen for their symbolic significance and alignment with temple traditions. The design uses elements which reflect both local culture and broader church symbolism.

The building measures approximately long, wide, and tall to the top of the statue of angel Moroni on top of the temple spire. It has an area of . It is the church&#x27;s only operating temple that has a bell tower; the Kirtland Temple also has a bell tower, but it is not a functioning temple. The angel on the first Nauvoo temple was a weathervane, sculpted of metal. The figure was positioned horizontally as if it were flying, clothed in a robe and cap. The angel held a book in one hand and a trumpet in the other.

Church leaders and architects carefully worked to replicate the original exterior design of the 19th-century temple, which was damaged by an arson fire in 1848 and by a tornado on May 27, 1850. It was consequently condemned and demolished by the Nauvoo City Council. Construction materials and furniture were derived from the original design as well.

=== Interior ===
The interior is inspired by the time period of the original temple, including a spiral staircase. The temple includes five instruction rooms, a celestial room, six sealing rooms, an assembly room, a baptistry, and a chapel, each arranged for ceremonial use. Symbolic elements are integrated into the design, providing deeper meaning to the temple&#x27;s function and aesthetics.

The interior floor plan of the temple is noticeably different from the original structure in which the endowment ceremony assumed its present format. At the direction of Joseph Smith, the west end of the attic story was divided by cloth partitions into four spaces used to administer the endowment. One of the canvas &quot;rooms&quot; was decorated with potted plants to suggest the Garden of Eden.

The Salt Lake City Endowment House and early Utah temples, each with a series of four ordinance rooms through which patrons moved during the presentation of the endowment, followed this layout. The first three rooms were decorated with murals representing, the creation of the world, the Garden of Eden, and the world after the fall of Adam and Eve. The fourth room, known as the Terrestrial Room, was ornately decorated but lacked murals. The Los Angeles California Temple, dedicated in 1956, was the last temple with this layout. Subsequent temples presented the endowment in one or two rooms without murals in the ordinance rooms. The use of murals resumed again in 2001 with the opening of the Columbia River Washington Temple. The Nauvoo Illinois Temple, using the four room layout, is the sole exception, as it has the four-room progressive format with murals decorating the first three rooms.

=== Symbols ===
The design includes elements representing Latter-day Saint and Biblical symbolism, representing spiritual meaning to the temple&#x27;s appearance and function. Symbolism is important to church members. One example is the temple’s sunstones used to decorate the exterior, which are a recreation of the sunstones featured on the original Nauvoo Temple. Like the original, the temple features “30 pilasters, each with a moonstone at the base and a sunstone at the top,” with a star stone above each sunstone. 

The sunstones were characterized by two hands holding trumpets above an image of the sun rising above clouds, while the moonstones featured relief carvings of downward-facing crescent moons. The star stones consisted of large five-pointed stars, each with an elongated bottom ray Together, these elements represent “the glory of the latter-day church or kingdom, further symbolized by the sun rising through the clouds, with the trumpets heralding the restoration of the gospel and the glory of the latter-day Church of Jesus Christ.”

== Cultural and community impact ==
The temple and its surrounding grounds have been a gathering place for community events, including the Nauvoo Pageant and the British Pageant, which are both held every summer in Nauvoo. The Nauvoo Pageant is narrated by Parley P. Pratt, and tells the story of Joseph Smith, the early LDS Church, and the Nauvoo Temple. The British Pageant portrays the English Reformation and the church&#x27;s first missions to Britain. 

The temple and the historic Nauvoo sites are managed by the church and provide educating and spiritually uplifting elements and insights into church history in Nauvoo. The Historic Nauvoo Visitors&#x27; Center, equipped with historic exhibits including a diorama of Nauvoo, provides all visitors with an understanding of the faith of early church members and the temple&#x27;s unique place in church history.

=== Temple presidents ===
The church&#x27;s temples are directed by a temple president and matron, each typically serving a term of three years. The president and matron oversee the administration of temple operations and provide guidance and training for both temple patrons and staff. Notable presidents include Richard W. Winder (2002–04), who was the first after its dedication, and Spencer J. Condie (2010–13).

As of 2024, Chris V. Church is the president, with Jane H. Church as matron.

== Admittance ==
After the temple was completed, a public open house from 6 May to 22 June 2002 and attracted over 250,000 visitors. The dedication on June 27, 2002, was the anniversary of the death of Joseph Smith, the church&#x27;s founder.

Up to 1.5 million visitors a year have visited Nauvoo since the temple opened in 2002.

In 2020, like all the church&#x27;s other temples, the Nauvoo Illinois Temple was closed for a time in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Like all the church&#x27;s temples, it is not used for Sunday worship services. To members of the church, temples are regarded as sacred houses of the Lord. Once dedicated, only church members with a current temple recommend can enter for worship.

<text>Walter Frederick Ferrier (1865–1950) was a Canadian geologist and mining engineer.

He graduated from McGill University&#x27;s school of mining engineering. He was a tireless mineral collector and was known for walking straight into mining offices to request specimens. Consequently, he created large collections of mineral specimens of a quality still admired to this day. Many classic specimens would never be in collections had it not been for his effort and skill. 
The mineral specimens he amassed were instrumental in creating the mineral collections of the Smithsonian in Washington DC, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, University of Alberta, and the museum particularly dear to his heart, the Redpath Museum at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

During one of his collecting trips he noticed a bladed mineral enclosed in chalcedony on the edge of Kamloops Lake in the Kamloops Mining Division, British Columbia, Canada. It turned out to be a new member of the Zeolite family of minerals. Subsequently, it was named after him - Ferrierite. The type material of this mineral is stored at the Redpath Museum and is part of a separate collection that also bears his name.

<text>Martian spherules (also known as hematite spherules, blueberries, &amp; Martian blueberries) are small spherules (roughly spherical pebbles) that are rich in an iron oxide (grey hematite, α-Fe2O3) and are found at Meridiani Planum (a large plain on Mars) in exceedingly large numbers.
These spherules were discovered on the Martian day that NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Rover &quot;Opportunity&quot; landed at Meridiani Planum. (At NASA&#x27;s Mission Control building that was January 24, 2004.) They are grey but look bluish next to the ubiquitous rusty reds on Mars, and since the first spherules found in Eagle Crater were 3–6 mm in diameter,
the &quot;Opportunity&quot; team quickly called them &quot;blueberries&quot;.

Martian blueberries are either embedded or loose. That is, Martian blueberries are either embedded in the large body of sediments of Meridiani Planum, or they are loose blueberries that lie directly on outcrops of the sediments or lie on top soils spread over the Meridiani sediments. The size of these spherules varies by location and elevation across the Meridiani Planum.

Martian blueberries are rich in the iron oxide hematite, but determining how rich they are in this iron oxide has proven difficult. (more below). The formation of blueberries required aqueous chemistry and involved flows of acidic, salty, liquid water over the Meridiani Planum and over two geological epochs.

==Initial discovery==
===Discovery from Orbit===
The Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on the orbiter &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; first detected crystalline gray hematite (α-Fe2O3) within the Sinus Meridiani. This discovery was part of a broader effort to map Mars for minerals associated with past water.

===Maps of Surface Hematite===

Between 1997 and 2002, the &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot;″s TES mapped the whole planet of Mars for surface hematite levels. Figure 1a gives the TES&#x27;s global hematite map in low resolution. It has just one large spot covering a region with high hematite levels. This green, yellow, and red spot straddles the equator and the prime meridian in the middle of Figure 1a. A higher resolution map of the high-hematite region is shown in Figure 1b. 
===Search for Signs of Water &amp; Life===
In the 1990s, NASA officials wanted to delineate a framework for &quot;faster, better, cheaper&quot; exploration of Mars. In this context, the &quot;Water Strategy&quot; was outlined in 1995/1996. High priority goals for NASA in the mid-1990s were to gather some evidence for surface water using satellite surveys and to land robotic rovers on the surface to collect detailed local evidence of water and signs of life.

In early the 2000s, the hematite map of Figure 1b and the confirmation (from the topography mapping done by the &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot;) that this area is a flat plain and relatively easy to land on were the decisive pieces of evidence for choosing the Meridiani Planum as one of the landing sites for NASA&#x27;s two bigger 
Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs), named &quot;Opportunity&quot; and &quot;Spirit&quot;. 
The decisiveness for NASA of the hematite map of Figure 1b for choosing the landing site for &quot;Opportunity&quot;
was because NASA was using high hematite levels as proxy evidence for large amounts of liquid water flowing in the region in the past. (Hematite only forms in the presence of liquid water in geological settings). In 2003, this high-hematite region was a high-priority place to start to search for signs of life on Mars.

===New name: Meridiani Planum===

The hematite map of Figure 1b covered part of a larger area called the Sinus Meridiani by 19th-century Mars map-makers. In 2004, senior scientists for the upcoming MER &quot;Opportunity&quot; mission introduced the new place name Meridiani Planum for (roughly) the high hematite area in Figure 1b.

===Discovery of Spherules on the Ground===

NASA&#x27;S rover &quot;Opportunity&quot; successfully made the &quot;hole-in-one&quot; landing into Eagle Crater at Meridiani Planum on January 24(PST), 2004. On the first sol (Martian day), the rover immediately discovered thousands and thousands of small (4–6 mm diameter) spherules lying all over the place inside Eagle Crater.

Figure 2 shows a thumbnail of the view from &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s Pancam (panoramic camera) on the first sol. (The actual image is very large, 7838 x 2915 pixels). The lead of the Pancam team, Jim Bell, soon wrote about this view: &quot;Scientists are intrigued by the abundance of rock outcrops dispersed throughout the crater, as well as the crater&#x27;s soil, which appears to be a mixture of coarse gray grains and fine reddish grains.&quot; Figure 3 is a detail of Figure 2 showing the grey spherules more clearly (click to enlarge).

Tests quickly found that the grey spherules are rich in grey hematite. These tests included doing the &quot;berry bowl&quot; experiment (more below). 
The moniker &quot;blueberries&quot; was coined for the grey hematite spherules by the original &quot;Opportunity&quot; science team due to these spherules appearing bluish relative to the underlying rusty-red soils in the &quot;natural color RGB images&quot; analyzed.

==Blueberry Formation==

Blueberries are either embedded in the large body of sediments of Meridiani Planum or they are loose blueberries that lie directly on outcrops of the sediments or lie on top soils spread over the Meridiani sediments. The loose blueberries and soils are eroded out of the underlying sediments. Both today&#x27;s embedded blueberries and the loose blueberries were formed in the sediments of Meridiani Planum by &quot;diagenetic&quot; processes, i.e., processes that change sediments by water-rock interactions. The diagenetic processes not only formed embedded blueberries but also changed an original large body of sediments. Thus, blueberry formation was (broadly) a three-step process:

* Formation of the original body of sediments;
* Diagenetic transformation of the original sediments to produce today&#x27;s sediments and embedded blueberries;
* Erosion of top layers of the sediments to form top soils and loose blueberries.

Each of these broad steps involved multiple sub-step processes, described in the following sub-sections:

===Noachian River Flows===

Prior to the formation of Meridiani&#x27;s defining sediments, in the wet Noachian (named for the biblical Noah) more than about ~3.7 billion years ago, liquid water was present and plentiful enough to form river channels that bought and deposited large quantities of basaltic silt to the current Meridiani region. The dried river valleys are easily seen in thermal inertia images taken in orbit by &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; and reproduced in Figure 4 (click on it for higher resolution). The river valleys seen in Figure 4 terminate abruptly as they flow into the Meridiani&#x27;s massive formation of sediments.

===Formation of Today&#x27;s Sediments &amp; Embedded Spherules===

From around the late-Noachian/early-Hesperian to sometime around 3.5 billion years ago, the layered sediments deposited in the earlier Noachian epoch were transformed. This transformation probably included a significant additional deposition of high-sulfur-content material of volcanic origin. The change certainly included aqueous geochemistry that was acidic and salty, as well as rising &amp; falling water levels: Features providing evidence include cross-bedded sediments, the presence of vugs (cavities), and embedded hematite spherules that cut across sediment layers, additionally the presence of large amounts of magnesium sulfate and other sulfate-rich minerals such as jarosite and chlorides. Jarosite formation requires aqueous acidic conditions below pH 3.

Figures 5 and 6 show Microscopic Imager close-ups of the sediment rock matrix that appeared in a prestigious paper. Figure 5 illustrates the four physical constituents of sediment outcrop: (i) the sedimentary layers containing a lot of basaltic sand particles; (ii) the embedded hematite spherules; (iii) fine-grained, sulfate-rich cement (in most parts of the outcrop); (iv) vug cavities (that are thought to be molds for crystals of, for example, hydrated sulfates). Figure 6 images a similar sediment outcrop surface to Figure 5. However, &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s Rock Abrasion Tool abraded this surface. Such abrasions showed that (a) the sediment layers are very soft and easy to cut, and (b) the hematite spherules have uniform internal structures. 
The diagenetic transformation (i.e., change by water-rock interactions) to today&#x27;s sediments involved a significant shift in water flows in the region. The inflows from rivers became less, and the dominant water movements in the sediments became vertical with rising and falling aquifer levels. 
At least one model of global Martian hydrology accounts for the historical shift in water flows at Meridiani Planum. This model links Meridiani&#x27;s change in water flows to activity in the volcanic Tharsis region. With the vertical aquifer flows, it is believed that (playa) lakes repeatedly formed and disappeared as the aquifer levels rose and fell. (The dry area around Utah&#x27;s Great Salt Lake is a playa.)

McLennan and his students constructed a geochemical model that generates hematite within a context like the Meridiani sediment.

The hematite formed into spherules by concretion (when minerals came out of solution). 
The concretion process to form spherules of hematite probably occurred by diffusion of the hematite through the sedimentary rock matrix.

===Formation of Soils &amp; Loose Spherules, Crater Degradation===

The period of rising and falling aquifer levels ceased, and no water flowed on Meridiani Planum thereafter. Although, when this happened is poorly understood. Estimates include around 3.5 billion years ago and about 3 billion years ago. The only water left at the plain is bound in rocks.

Erosion with water flows in earlier eras was much faster than in this arid epoch.
However, erosion did not stop. Other much slower erosional processes continued and became the primary agents of change to the plain. This slower change was and is driven by meteorite impacts, the wind, and gravity. Over the hard-to-grasp eon of around three billion years, meteorite impacts and the wind formed the sandy top soils and loose hematite spherules and sorted these into the layered soil bedforms that we can now see.

The meteorite, gravity, and wind-driven processes work like this:
* Over billions of years, meteorite impacts created many craters on the plain.
* There were enough small (5 to 30 m diameter) craters created in the eon of around three billion years to cover, on average, the whole plain once. Although, each small crater degraded and disappeared in about 25 million years or less, and only about 0.7% of the plain&#x27;s area is presently covered in small craters.
* Each meteorite impact produces large numbers of blocks of sediment material in the crater rim and as ejecta around the crater.
* Most of the initial sediment blocks project above the surrounding material (by a few centimeters or more) and are exposed to saltating sand (i.e., wind-driven, bouncing sand).
* Meridiani sediment matrix is soft and easy-to-erode. It erodes about 30 to 300 times faster than other regions of Mars (such as Gusev Crater). (Although, this arid erosion is much slower than erosion with water flows.)
* The saltating sand erodes the soft, easy-to-erode parts of the sediment matrix in the projecting blocks. 
* These blocks are either completely eroded or erode until they become smooth and no longer project into saltating sand.
* This block erosion creates dust particles and turns embedded spherules into loose spherules.
* The dust particles are blown off the plain and become part of the global dust.
* The sulfates preferentially turn into dust and are transported off the plain by the wind.
* The larger basalt sand particles, spherules fragments, and hematite spherules remain in place on the plain.
* Wind, gravity, and size-sorting created the soil bedforms from the basaltic sands, spherule fragments, and spherules. 
* With the aid of gravity and wind, the original (small) crater holes are gradually filled in (with material from eroded rim blocks and other local erosion material), and the plain is returned to a flat state.

Phil Christensen outlined these processes in 2004, soon after &quot;Opportunity&quot; landed. Later, more in-depth research confirmed them and added details to Christensen&#x27;s outline.

==Blueberry Composition==

===Early Blueberry Composition Results===
Early on, &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s Mössbauer spectrometer took data that determined that the iron mineral component of these spherules is dominated by hematite. However, the Mössbauer spectrometer provided no information about the mineral components of these spherules that do not contain iron.
The &quot;berry bowl&quot; experiment took alpha particle X-ray spectrometer (APXS) readings of two sampling targets just centimeters apart: One had no (zero or one) spherules in the spectrometer&#x27;s field of view (FOV), while the other had around 25 spherules in the FOV. Figure 8 shows the adjacent &quot;berry bowl&quot; sampling targets. The APXS results indicated there was noticeably more iron in the target with ~25 spherules relative to the target with 0 or 1 spherules. Based on this and similar experiments, several unreviewed conference abstracts claimed (deliberately not cited here) 
that hematite dominated the composition of the spherules and some published papers cited these conference claims. However, there were reasons to be cautious. The instruments detected mixed signals from sampling targets that included signals not only from the spherules but also from dust and rock (in the &quot;berry bowl&quot; experiment) or dust and soils (in other composition data collections). In 2006, Morris et al. showed that the methods used by some researchers to pick out the spherule composition signal from the dust and soil signals were flawed and that such methods could do no more than constrain the iron oxide content of the spherules to between 24 wt% and 100 wt% (that is, almost no constraint at all).

===Later Blueberry Composition Results===
A 2008 paper published the result of a clever experiment that showed &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s mini-TES (thermal emission spectrometer) could not detect any silicate minerals in the spherules. This non-detection constrained silicate levels in spherules to less than 10 wt% and probably below 8 wt%. This result is helpful since the APXS data shows a strong anti-correlation between silicates and iron oxide in the spherules -
so low silicate levels indicate high iron oxide levels.

A recent paper used the mini-TES&#x27;s non-detection of silicates and some improved data analysis methods to find over 340,000 allowable standard oxide chemical compositions for the spherules (allowable = consistent with the silicate non-detection). The lowest and highest weight percentages for the iron oxide content in these allowable spherule compositions were, respectively, 79.5 wt% and 99.8 wt%. While, for the large majority of the allowable compositions, the iron oxide contents in the spherules were between 85 wt% and 96 wt%; further, the nickel content was always close to 0.3 wt%, a group of five standard oxides (MgO, Na2O, P2O5, SO3, and Cl) each had content above trace-level with a combined group content of 6.8 +/- 2.4 wt%, the SiO2 levels ranged between 8 wt% and 0 wt%, and the other eight APXS standard oxides had either 0 wt% content or only trace level content.

==Size of Blueberries==

The &quot;Opportunity&quot; science team published three papers that studied variations in hematite spherule size. They found spherule size variation by location and elevation.

In the earliest paper, a team of &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover scientists reported on studies of all the soil 
materials found between the landing site in Eagle Crater to the location on sol 552 of the rover&#x27;s traverse (between Endurance Crater and Victoria Crater). 
They found that in a sample of 696 blueberries, disregarding any non-spherical blueberries from the sample, the blueberries&#x27; average major axis to be about 2.87 mm (just over one-tenth inch). They also discovered that blueberries found within soils are typically smaller than blueberries found in the outcrops. They noted the size of the blueberries tends to decrease with decreasing latitude.

The &quot;Opportunity&quot; team found many fragmented blueberries and suggested the fracturing occurred after spherule formation. They believe the fracturing either be from meteoric impacts or the &quot;same process&quot; that &quot;fractured the outcrop&quot;. However, the team notes this would not explain the presence of the smallest hematite spherules detected. The smallest are close to perfectly spherical and therefore cannot be explained by fracturing or erosion. The &quot;Opportunity&quot; team also found that blueberries uncovered by the Rock Abrasion Tool aboard Opportunity were 4.2 +/- 0.9 mm (0.16 inches) major axis length at Eagle Crater and 4.5 +/- 0.6 mm at Endurance crater, about 2.2 +/- 0.5 mm (0.087 inches) at Vostok and about 3.0 +/- 0.2 mm (0.12 inches) at Naturaliste (crater). Those found in &quot;the plains&quot; south of Endurance Crater were smaller (1-2mm or 0.04-0.08 inches) than those of Eagle and Endurance craters.

The second paper studying spherule size extended the study area 2–3 km further south on the plains to Victoria Crater. This paper reported similar observations to the first but went further to suggest the observed size variation might be due to sampling different sediment stratigraphic levels at different locations. Additionally, it suggested simple variations in diagenetic conditions were linked to changes in spherule size.

The third paper made systematic size measurements of hematite spherules embedded in the walls of Victoria Carter at different heights. (Victoria Crater is a large and deep crater.) These measurements showed a clear variation of spherule size with elevation within the sediments of Meridiani Planum. The smaller spherules were higher up, the larger ones lower down. The lowest spherules near the bottom of Victoria Crater had similar diameters to the spherules in Eagle Crater, and the elevations of these distant locations were nearly equal.

No papers were written on spherule size that covered areas of the rover&#x27;s traverse south from Victoria Crater to the enormous Endeavour Crater. However, searches of the archive of the images taken by the rover&#x27;s Microscopic Imager show some of the largest blueberries photographed are close to the rim of Endeavour Crater (see Figure 11).

==Numbers of Blueberries &amp; Loose Spherule Surface Density==

There are no peer-reviewed published estimates of the number of loose hematite spherules on Meridiani&#x27;s soils or embedded hematite spherules in the plain&#x27;s sediments. However, the reader can sense how mind-boggling big those numbers are with a photograph of an area of soil with a typical surface density of the hematite spheres. Such a photograph &quot;has&quot; been published.

Figures 12 and 13 are true-color and false-color versions of the photo. The spherules are easier to see in the published false-color version (Figure 23). Click on it to enlarge it. The sampling target of Figures 12 &amp; 13 had 29% coarse hematite coverage. The range of coverage among similar targets was 10% to 40%. These targets were sampled over a wide area, between Sol 70 (2004-04-04) and Sol 999 (2007-11-15).

The parts of the plain &quot;Opportunity&quot; studied are &quot;not&quot; special: Compared to the rest of Meridiani Planum, they do not have high surface hematite levels. To see this, look at the plain&#x27;s surface hematite map (Figure 1b) and the small blue line (labeled OT ) indicating the route of &quot;Opportunity&quot;&#x27;s Traverse of the plain.

The mind-bogglingness of the number of loose hematite spherules hits when Figures 12 &amp; 13 are extrapolated to the plain&#x27;s whole surface area (about 150,000 km2): 150,000 km2 is close to 2/3&#x27;s the area of the main island of Japan (Honshu) and also 72% the area of the main island of the UK (Great Britain), it is also bigger than the land areas of 30 of the 50 states of the USA.

The number of embedded spherules (in the plain&#x27;s sediments) is probably much higher than the number of loose spherules (on soils). Since (1) the estimates of the erosion depth of original sediment needed to produce the loose spherules are less than 1 meter, while (2) the typical depths of the plain&#x27;s sediments are several hundred meters.

==Shiny Blueberries without Dust==
The image at right (Figure 14) shows shiny hematite blueberries. The shininess and the position of these blueberries are unusual. The rover &quot;Opportunity&quot; dug a trench into the top soils that lie over the Meridiani Planum&#x27;s sediments. Figure 14 shows a wall to the newly dug trench with (partially uncovered) soil-embedded blueberries. 
Soil-embedded blueberries are rare. Size-sorting tends to position loose blueberries on or very near the surface of soil bedforms. Almost all photographed blueberries were exposed to the atmosphere and are now covered in a layer of Mars&#x27;s dust. The layers of dust take away the shininess of the blueberries. The blueberries inside the trench are dust-free because the interiors of soil beds are largely dust-free. Without the dust, these blueberries are shiny.

==Blueberries on Earth==

===Earth analogs===

Researchers from the University of Utah have explored the similarities between the blueberries and spherical concretions discovered within &quot;Jurassic Navajo Sandstone&quot; in southern Utah. They have concluded Mars must have had previous ground water activity to form the blueberries. However, they do note the spherules are more spherical in the Martian sample due to the lack of &quot;joints, fractures, faults, or other preferential fluid paths&quot;, unlike the Utah sample. A team of researchers from Japan studied the spherules found in Utah as well as spherules that were later discovered in Mongolia, in the Gobi. They found evidence that the concretions found in these locations are first formed as &quot;spherical calcite concretions&quot; in sandstone. Acidic water rich in iron then dissolve the calcite leaving behind the iron rich (hematite) spherule. This leads to the conclusion that the blueberries may have formed early in Mars&#x27;s history when the atmosphere was more dense by the same process.

<text>Philip Carey (born Eugene Joseph Carey, July 15, 1925February 6, 2009) was an American actor, well-known for playing the role of Asa Buchanan on the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; for nearly three decades.

== Early life and education==
On July 15, 1925, Carey was born in Hackensack, New Jersey. He grew up in Rosedale, Queens and Malverne, New York.

Carey studied drama at the University of Miami.

== Career ==
Carey served in the United States Marine Corps, was wounded as part of the ship&#x27;s detachment of the during World War II, and served again in the Korean War.

Carey&#x27;s acting career began in 1950. One of his earliest roles was Lt. (jg) Bob Perry in John Wayne&#x27;s &quot;Operation Pacific&quot;. Carey also made appearances in films such as &quot;I Was a Communist for the FBI&quot; (1951), &quot;This Woman Is Dangerous&quot; with Joan Crawford (1952), &quot;The Nebraskan&quot; (1953), &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; with Doris Day (1953), &quot;They Rode West&quot; (1954), &quot;Pushover&quot; (1954), &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; (1955), &quot;The Long Gray Line&quot; (1955), and &quot;Port Afrique&quot; (1956).

In 1956, Carey starred on the NBC series &quot;Tales of the 77th Bengal Lancers&quot;. Carey&#x27;s character was portrayed as Canadian because Carey reportedly could not master a British accent. He played the character Dr. Simon Battle, gunfighter turned doctor in the outstanding 1961 episode of &quot;The Rifleman&quot; S3 E33 &quot;Death Trap&quot;. In 1961, he guest-starred in an episode of &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;.

In a following 1962 episode, &quot;Johnny Brassbuttons&quot;, Carey plays Marshal Frank Nolan assigned to bring back to justice a Native Indian accused of conspiracy to commit murder.

Carey had played Custer himself in &quot;The Great Sioux Massacre&quot; (1965) and played Captain Myles Keogh at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tonka&quot; in 1959.

During this period, Carey also appeared on CBS-TV hit sitcom &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. The episode entitled &quot;Lucy and the Runaway Butterfly&quot; was broadcast on April 22, 1963. In that installment, Carey played Howard McClay, a boyfriend of Lucy Carmichael&#x27;s (played by Lucille Ball).

In the 1970 tv series, Ironside, he guest starred with Vera Miles in a multi-part episode titled “Goodbye to Yesterday.” 

In 1971, Carey guest-starred on the landmark fifth installment of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, playing Steve, an ex–professional football player friend of Archie Bunker&#x27;s, who tells Archie he is gay. The episode was entitled &quot;Judging Books by Covers&quot;.

He also appeared in the low-budget horror film &quot;Monstroid&quot; in 1980.

Carey became well known for a series of tongue-in-cheek television commercials for Granny Goose potato chips, in which he self-identified as &quot;Granny Goose&quot;, portraying the company&#x27;s spokesperson as a tough cowboy.

=== &quot;One Life to Live&quot; ===

Carey joined the cast of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1980, originating the role of ruthless business tycoon Asa Buchanan. During his time portraying the patriarch of the Buchanan family, he became one of the most often-married characters in daytime television. In addition to &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, he also played the role in one episode of &quot;All My Children&quot; in 2003 and another in 2004. A lifelong smoker, he was diagnosed with lung cancer in January 2006, and underwent chemotherapy. 

In late March 2007, Carey was announced to be leaving &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, turning down an offer to go to recurring status with the show. The character subsequently died offscreen in August 2007, coinciding with the series&#x27; 10,000th episode celebration, which brought back characters from the show&#x27;s past to attend the funeral. In November 2007, Carey briefly reprised the role for three episodes in Asa&#x27;s videotaped will, airing November 9 to November 13, 2007. On July 16, 2008, he appeared as Asa&#x27;s ghost, and also returned on July 21, 2008, for the series&#x27; 40th anniversary, as character Victoria Lord, Asa&#x27;s former daughter in law visits, visits Heaven after a car accident. He again returned on August 19, 2008 as Asa&#x27;s ghost. Carey appeared one last time on December 29, 2008, in a videotaped message recorded by Asa before his death.

==Personal life==
In 1949, Carey married Maureen Peppler. They had three children, Jeff, Linda, and Lisa. The marriage ended in a divorce. In 1976, Carey married Colleen Welch. They had two children, Sean and Shannon.
Carey was close friends with his on-screen sons, Clint Ritchie (who died six days before Carey) and Robert S. Woods.

=== Death ===
On February 6, 2009, Carey died of lung cancer at age 83.

<text>The common blue butterfly or European common blue (Polyommatus icarus) is a butterfly in the family Lycaenidae and subfamily Polyommatinae. The butterfly is found throughout the Palearctic and has been introduced to North America. Butterflies in the Polyommatinae are collectively called blues, from the coloring of the wings. Common blue males usually have wings that are blue above with a black-brown border and a white fringe. The females are usually brown above with a blue dusting and orange spots.

The Common blue was elected as the national butterfly of Israel in 2023.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
This species was first described by Siegmund Adrian von Rottemburg in 1775. Vernacular names that have been given to &quot;P. icarus&quot; include little blew argus, blew argus, mixed argus, selvedg’d argus, ultramarine blue, caerulean butterfly, and alexis.

===Subspecies===
Subspecies include:

* &quot;P. i. icarus&quot; (Europe, Caucasus, Transcaucasia)
* &quot;P. i. mariscolore&quot; (Ireland)
* &quot;P. i. fuchsi&quot; (South Siberia, Transbaikalia)
* &quot;P. i. omelkoi&quot; (Amur, Ussuri)
* &quot;P. i. ammosovi&quot; (Central Yakutia, Far East, Kamchatka)
* &quot;P. i. fugitiva&quot; (Pakistan)
* &quot;P. i. napaea&quot; (Tian-Shan)
* &quot;P. i. zelleri&quot; 

==Description==
&quot;Polyommatus icarus&quot; has a wingspan of . The dorsal side of the wings is an iridescent lilac blue, bright violet-blue, or almost hyacinth-blue with a thin black border. Females&#x27; wings are brown or black-brown with a row of red reddish yellow spots along the edges of the wings (marginal spots) and usually some blue at the base. The extent of blue and brown is extremely variable depending on location. The top of the wings in the female may be mostly blue, especially in Ireland and Scotland, but it always has red spots.
The ventral side has a greyish or dust-grey base colour in the males and a more brownish hue in the females. Both sexes have a row of red or orange spots along the edge of the hindwing and extending onto the forewing, though they are generally fainter there, particularly in the males, where they are sometimes missing altogether. There are about a dozen black-centered white spots (ocelli) on the hindwing and nine on the forewing. These usually include one in the middle of the forewing cell, absent in Chapman&#x27;s and Escher&#x27;s blues. The fringes on the outer edge of the wings are uniform white, not crossed with black lines as in the chalkhill and Adonis blues (that is, the common blue lacks checkering).

Other similar species are:-
*&quot;Polyommatus semiargus&quot;
*&quot;Polyommatus coridon&quot;
*&quot;Polyommatus dorylas&quot;
*&quot;Polyommatus amandus&quot;
*&quot;Polyommatus damon&quot;
*&quot;Polyommatus celina&quot;
The caterpillar is small, pale green with yellow stripes and, as usual with Lycaenid larvae, rather slug-like.

==Geographic range==

The common blue butterfly is found in Europe, North Africa, the Canary Islands, and east across the Palearctic to Northern China. Recently it was discovered in Quebec, Canada. It is widespread in the British Isles. Its distribution trend shows a 15% decline since the 1970s.

===U.K. and Ireland===
The common blue is Britain and Ireland&#x27;s (and probably Europe&#x27;s) most common and most widespread blue. It is found as far north as Orkney and on most of the Outer Hebrides. A range of grassland habitats are used: meadows, coastal dunes, woodland clearings, and also many man-made habitats, anywhere their food plants are found.

===North America===
This is a recently introduced species in eastern Canada. It was discovered in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada, by Ara Sarafian, an amateur entomologist who observed the butterfly from 2005 to 2008. He contacted the Canadian National Collection of Insects in Ottawa where the butterfly was identified as &quot;Polyommatus icarus&quot;, a newly introduced butterfly to Canada and to North America. The butterfly seems to be well established and is extending its range from year to year. A study from Montreal, Quebec, Canada showed that the common blue is most abundant in areas with greater urban land cover and where their preferred larval host plant, bird&#x27;s foot trefoil (&quot;Lotus corniculatus&quot;), can be found.

==Habitat==
These butterflies inhabit flowery or grassy places, warm and cool, open or wooded areas and at all altitudes up to high alpine meadows at an elevation of above sea level. It mostly resides on chalk or limestone grassland, but also in smaller numbers in woodland clearings, meadows, heathlands, sand dunes, along railway embankments, and under cliffs.

===Source of decline===
Previously, &quot;P. icarus&quot; was a very common species that occupied Europe and Asia, and was one of the most widely distributed butterflies in Britain. It is known to be tolerant of many habitats, including a wide range of grasslands. There has been an estimated 74% loss of the butterfly population since 1901. This could be because 46% of the total land area covered by the butterfly&#x27;s preferred host plant, &quot;Lotus corniculatus&quot;, has also been lost since 1901. This host plant is a favored plant for two reasons: it provides adult nutrition, as well as food for the larva after it hatches.

==Food resources==
===Larval food plants===
The larvae feed on plants from the bean family, Leguminosae. Recorded food plants are &quot;Lathyrus&quot; species, &quot;Vicia&quot; species, &quot;Vicia cracca&quot;, &quot;Oxytropis campestris&quot;, bird&#x27;s foot trefoil (&quot;Lotus corniculatus&quot;), &quot;Oxytropis pyrenaica&quot;, &quot;Astragalus aristatus&quot;, &quot;Astragalus onobrychis&quot;, &quot;Astragalus pinetorum&quot;, black medick (&quot;Medicago lupulina&quot;), &quot;Medicago romanica&quot;, &quot;Medicago falcata&quot;, common restharrow (&quot;Ononis repens&quot;), wild thyme &quot;Thymus serpyllum&quot;, lesser trefoil (&quot;Trifolium dubium&quot;), &quot;Trifolium pratense&quot; and white clover (&quot;Trifolium repens&quot;).

===Flavonoids===
Common blues sequester flavonoids from their host plants and allocate these pigments that are UV-absorbing into their wings. These flavonoid pigments in females attract males. Males who patrol areas of suitable habitats while searching for virgin females stop and inspect females who have flavonoid pigments in them. This may be because flavonoid pigments that have UV absorption increase color saturation on females and allow females to be more conspicuous. There are also some other advantages of sequestering flavonoids, including the protection of eggs from adverse UV chemical reactions, as the butterflies will absorb the UV rays, and the flavonoids can offer a chemical defense against predators or pathogens.

Flavonoid sequestration is much more effective when coming from natural host plants than from experimentally offered diets. Females sequester about 60% more flavonoids than do males. This richness in females may increase visibility, but could also confer information about feeding history, and consequentially the quality of potential mate. Flavonoid sequestration is an important component of intraspecific visual communication and sexual signaling in &quot;Polyommatus&quot; butterflies.

==Parental care==
===Oviposition===
During oviposition, females must locate a potential host plant and evaluate its suitability as the host plant for oviposition. &quot;P. icarus&quot; uses visual cues to conduct this task. Females use several plants in the family Fabaceae as larval host plants, many which could also potentially function as nectar sources. &quot;P. icarus&quot; prefers plants with flowers over plants without, and prefers to oviposit near the flowers.

==Life cycle==
As a caterpillar, the common blue eats leaves. As an adult butterfly, it feeds on wildflower nectar and excrement. The adult lives 3 weeks.

Males are often very obvious as they defend territories against rivals and seek out the more reclusive females. In the south of Britain there are two broods a year, flying in May and June and again in August and September. Northern England has one brood, flying between June and September. In a year with a long warm season, there is sometimes a partial third brood in the south flying into October.

===Eggs===
The egg stage lasts for around eight days. The eggs are white and shaped like flattened spheres. The eggs are very small, about . The ground color of the egg sac is pale-greenish grey, with the actual arrangement being white. Eggs are laid singly on young shoots of the food plant.

===Larvae===
The larvae emerge around a week or two after eggs are laid. The larvae of &quot;P. icarus&quot; feed on the underside of leaves, causing blotching. Hibernation occurs as a half-grown larvae. They are attractive to ants of genera &quot;Myrmica&quot;, &quot;Lasius&quot;, &quot;Formica&quot;, &quot;Plagiolepiss&quot;, but not as much as some other species of blues. The chrysalis is olive green/brown and formed on the ground, where it is attended by ants of genera &quot;Myrmica&quot;, &quot;Lasius&quot;, &quot;Formica&quot;, &quot;Plagiolepiss,&quot; which will often take it into their nests. The larva creates a substance called honeydew, which the ants eat while the butterfly lives in the ant hill. The relationship between these ants and blue common larvae is described to be facultatively mutualistic.

====Instars of larvae====
There are five instars of larvae. During the first instar, larva emerge and eat away the crown of the egg. The segments of the larvae are large and rounded, and the following segments are smaller. The body is a light green, and is whitish in light. This stage lasts about nine days. The second instar, after the first moult, adds a couple of body segments onto the larvae, and the body is more green. The third instar signifies more feeding and growing in size of the larvae. They are about long and the head and legs are black colored. In the fourth and fifth instar, the larvae becomes very green, has ten body segments, and measures about in length.

====External effects on larval growth and development====
Larval growth rates are thought to be determined mainly by temperature and food quality and availability. The larvae of &quot;P. icarus&quot; are oligophagous, meaning they utilize a range of host plants in the family fabaceae, as well as have a mutualistic relationship with ants. For both male and female larvae, the total development time is longer with longer day lengths, corresponding to earlier times in the season. When larvae are born earlier in the season, they take a longer time to develop. When they are born later, they take a shorter time to develop. Thus the external effect of photoperiod affects the length of development for the larvae.

===Pupae===
Pupation, a stage that lasts about two weeks, occurs under silk strands at the base of the food plant. The chrysalis is olive green/brown and formed on the ground, where it is attended by ants. Ants may aid in protecting the pupa and may bury it to protect it from predators.

===Adults===
The male, with a bluer color, is more conspicuous than the female, which has brown upperwings. Males fly farther distances in search of territories that have fertile females. Females fly lower and search for nectar and places to lay her eggs. Wing span ranges from . When the sexes meet, copulation occurs immediately, usually without any courtship ritual.

==Physiology==
===Vision===
Visual systems in butterflies are highly diverse and their color vision abilities have only begun to be explored. To see color, &quot;P. icarus&quot; uses a duplicated blue opsin in conjunction with its long-wavelength opsin LWRh. This enables the common blue to see color in the green part of the light spectrum extending up to . There is also a difference between the dorsal and ventral eye-shine of &quot;P. icarus&quot;, with the dorsal retina dominated by yellow-reflecting ommatidia and the ventral exhibiting yellow and red-reflecting ommatidia. &quot;P. icarus&quot; is able to use color vision and distinguish between yellow of and blue of , but is not able to distinguish between yellow and red of 640 nm.

==Etymology==
Named in the Classical tradition. In Greek mythology, Icarus was the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the architect of the labyrinth of Crete.

<text>Province of Spalato () was a province of the Italian Governorate of Dalmatia, created in May 1941 during World War II (by the &quot;Regio Decreto Legge del 18 maggio 1941&quot;). It lasted until September 1943.

==History==
The puppet Independent State of Croatia ceded by the Treaties of Rome of 18 May 1941, extensive Adriatic coastal areas to the Fascist Kingdom of Italy. The ruling Italian National Fascist Party was a patron of Croatian fascist Ustasha Movement. Italy placed Ustasha leader Ante Pavelić as the head of Croatian puppet State after the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the April War 1941. Among the ceded areas was the city of Split in Dalmatia. 
Italy created some provinces (administrative districts) in that region, that lasted until September 1943. One was the province of Spalato. The administrative capital was the city of Spalato (Italian name for Split).

The province had an area of 1,075 square kilometers and a population of 128,000 inhabitants. Most of the province&#x27;s inhabitants were Croats, but there were more than 3,000 Dalmatian Italians (in Split alone there were over 1,000 in 1940, even if very few in number compared to the mid-19th century, when they were over a third of the city&#x27;s inhabitants). The island of Lastovo, ceded after World War I to Italy and renamed Lagosta, was united to the province.

The Italians started immediately a process of improvement in the underdeveloped area, creating needed infrastructures from hospitals to schools and sewages.


Under orders of Mussolini, it was also started in July 1941 a process of forced Italianization (related to the history of Venetian Dalmatia). 
Because of this, in the end of summer 1941 there was a resistance movement of Croats against the Italian conquest, but without huge consequences until spring/summer 1943. 

Furthermore, in spring 1942 was created the football team Associazione Calcio Spalato, that was ruled by the Italian FIGC in the Italian championships. 

Meanwhile, in 1941 and 1942 many Jews and some Serbs took refuge in the city, escaping from the nearby regions ruled by the Croatian Ustaše.

In September 1943 the German army took control of the region from the Italians, who had surrendered to the Allies, and soon started a terrible guerrilla war between the German occupiers and Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s partisans. The province was cancelled in the same September and later annexed to Ante Pavelić&#x27;s puppet Croatia.

==Administrative subdivision==
The 13 &quot;comuni&quot; were (first in Italian the official name and then in Croatian the actual)::
*Spalato / Split
*Blatta / Blato
*Castella Inferiore or Castel Vecchio / Kaštel Stari ili Donja Kaštela
*Castelli / Kaštel Sućurac

<doc id="797638" wikidata="Q1992677" url="?curid=797638" title="Quit India Movement">
<text>The Quit India Movement was a movement launched at the Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee by Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942, during World War II, demanding an end to British rule in India.

After the British failed to secure Indian support for the British war effort with the Cripps Mission, Gandhi made a call to &quot;Do or Die&quot; in his Quit India speech delivered in Bombay on 8 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank Maidan. Viceroy Linlithgow described the movement as &quot;by far the most serious rebellion since 1857&quot;.

The All India Congress Committee launched a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called &quot;An Orderly British Withdrawal&quot; from India. Even though it was at war, Britain was prepared to act. Almost the entire leadership of the Indian National Congress was imprisoned without trial within hours of Gandhi&#x27;s speech. Most spent the rest of the war in prison and out of contact with the masses. The British had the support of the Viceroy&#x27;s Council, of the All India Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha, the princely states, the Indian Imperial Police, the British Indian Army, and the Indian Civil Service. Many Indian businessmen profiting from heavy wartime spending did not support the Quit India Movement. The major outside support came from the Americans, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands.

The movement included boycotting the British government and rejection of transactions involving the government. Various violent incidents took place around the country against the British regime. The British arrested tens of thousands of leaders, keeping them imprisoned until 1945. Ultimately, the British government realised that India was ungovernable in the long run, and the issue for the postwar era became how to exit gracefully and peacefully.

The movement ended in 1945 with the release of jailed freedom fighters. Martyrs of this freedom movement include Mukunda Kakati, Matangini Hazra, Kanaklata Barua, Kushal Konwar, Bhogeswari Phukanani and others. In 1992, the Reserve Bank of India issued a 1 rupee commemorative coin to mark the Golden Jubilee of the Quit India Movement.

==World War II and Indian involvement==
In 1939, Indian nationalists were angry that British Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, brought India into the war without consultation with them. The Muslim League supported the war, but Congress was divided.

At the outbreak of war, the Congress Party had passed a resolution during the Wardha meeting of the working committee in September 1939, conditionally supporting the fight against the Axis, but were rebuffed when they asked for independence in return:

Gandhi had not supported this initiative, as he could not reconcile an endorsement for war (he was a committed believer in non-violent resistance, used in the Indian Independence Movement and proposed even against Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Hideki Tojo). However, at the height of the Battle of Britain, Gandhi had stated his support for the fight against racism and of the British war effort, stating he did not seek to raise an independent India from the ashes of Britain. However, opinions remained divided. The long-term British policy of limiting investment in India and using the country as a market and source of revenue had left the Indian Army relatively weak and poorly armed and trained and forced the British to become net contributors to India&#x27;s budget, while taxes were sharply increased and the general level of prices doubled: although many Indian businesses benefited from increased war production, in general business &quot;felt rebuffed by the government&quot; and in particular the refusal of the British Raj to give Indians a greater role in organising and mobilising the economy for wartime production.

Subash Chandra Bose remarked that a &quot;new chapter in Indian freedom struggle began with the Quit India Movement&quot;. After the onset of the world war, Bose had organised the &quot;Indian Legion&quot; in Germany, reorganised the Indian National Army with Japanese assistance and, soliciting help from the Axis Powers, conducted a guerrilla war against the British authorities.

Viceroy Linlithgow remarked the movement to be &quot;by far the most serious rebellion since 1857&quot;. In his telegram to Winston Churchill on 31 August he noted:

I am engaged here in meeting by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857, the gravity and extent of which we have so far concealed from the world for reasons of military security. Mob violence remains rampant over large tracts of the countryside and I am by no means confident that we may not see in September a formidable attempt to renew this widespread sabotage of our war effort. The lives of Europeans in outlying places are in jeopardy.

When American Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie and YMCA official Sherwood Eddy planned to meet Gandhi, Linlithgow deemed it to be American interference in &quot;our own business&quot; and asked Churchill to dissuade them. The Indian nationalists knew that the United States strongly supported Indian independence, in principle, and believed the U.S. was an ally. However, after Churchill threatened to resign if pushed too hard, the U.S. quietly supported him while bombarding Indians with propaganda designed to strengthen public support of the war effort. The poorly run American operation annoyed the Indians.

===Cripps mission===
In March 1942, faced with a dissatisfied sub-continent only reluctantly participating in the war and deterioration in the war situation in Europe and with growing dissatisfaction among Indian troops and among the civilian population in the sub-continent, the British government sent a delegation to India under Stafford Cripps, the Leader of the House of Commons, in what came to be known as the Cripps Mission. The purpose of the mission was to negotiate with the Indian National Congress a deal to obtain total co-operation during the war, in return for devolution and distribution of power from the crown and the Viceroy to an elected Indian legislature. The talks failed, as they did not address the key demand of a timetable of self-government and of the powers to be relinquished, essentially making an offer of limited dominion-status that was unacceptable to the Indian movement.

===Factors contributing to the movement&#x27;s launch===
In 1939, with the outbreak of war between Germany and Britain, India became a party to the war by being a constituent component of the British Empire. Had enough Indian states agreed to form a Federal Government under the terms of the 1935 Act, then the Viceroy could not have acted unilaterally in declaring war on India&#x27;s behalf. Following this declaration, the Congress Working Committee at its meeting on 10 October 1939, passed a resolution condemning the aggressive activities of the Germans. At the same time, the resolution also stated that India could not associate herself with war unless it was consulted first. Responding to this declaration, the Viceroy issued a statement on 17 October wherein he claimed that Britain was waging a war driven with the intention of strengthening peace in the world. He also stated that after the war the government would initiate modifications in the Act of 1935, in accordance with the desires of the Indians.

Gandhi&#x27;s reaction to this statement was; &quot;the old policy of divide and rule is to continue. Congress has asked for bread and it has got stone.&quot; According to the instructions issued by High Command, the Congress ministers were directed to resign immediately. Congress ministers from eight provinces resigned following the instructions. The resignation of the ministers was an occasion of great joy and rejoicing for the leader of the Muslim League, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He called the date i.e. 22 December 1939 The Day of Deliverance. Gandhi urged Jinnah against the celebration of this day, however, it was futile. At the Muslim League Lahore Session held in March 1940, Jinnah declared in his presidential address that the Muslims of the country wanted a separate electorate, Pakistan.

Meanwhile, crucial political events took place in England. Chamberlain was succeeded by Churchill as prime minister. This meant that the Marquis of Zetland who had piloted the 1935 Act, much to Churchill&#x27;s chagrin, resigned as Secretary of State for India. In order to pacify the Indians in the circumstance of the worsening war situation, the Conservatives were forced to concede some of the demands made by the Indians. On 8 August, the Viceroy issued a statement that has come to be referred to as the &quot;August Offer&quot;. However, Congress rejected the offer followed by the Muslim League.

In the context of the widespread dissatisfaction that prevailed over the rejection of the demands made by the Congress, at the meeting of the Congress Working Committee in Wardha, Gandhi revealed his plan to launch individual civil disobedience. Once again, the weapon of &quot;satyagraha&quot; found popular acceptance as the best means to wage a crusade against the British. It was widely used as a mark of protest against the unwavering stance assumed by the British. Vinoba Bhave, a follower of Gandhi, was selected by him to initiate the movement. Anti-war speeches ricocheted in all corners of the country, with the satyagrahis earnestly appealing to the people of the nation not to support the government in its war endeavours. The consequence of this satyagrahi campaign was the arrest of almost fourteen thousand satyagrahis. On 3 December 1941, the Viceroy ordered the acquittal of all the satyagrahis. In Europe the war situation became more critical with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the Congress realised the necessity for appraising their program. Subsequently, the movement was withdrawn.

Cripps&#x27; mission of March 1942 and its failure also played an important role in Gandhi&#x27;s call for The Quit India Movement. In order to end the deadlock on 22 March 1942, the British government sent Sir Stafford Cripps to talk terms with the Indian political parties and secure their support in Britain&#x27;s war efforts. A draft declaration of the British Government was presented, which included terms like the establishment of Dominion, the establishment of a Constituent Assembly, and right of the provinces to make separate constitutions. However, these were to be only implemented after the cessation of the World War II. According to Congress, this declaration offered India an only promise that was to be fulfilled in the future. Commenting on this Gandhi said, &quot;It is a post-dated cheque on a crashing bank.&quot; Other factors that contributed were the threat of Japanese invasion of India and the realisation of the national leaders of the incapacity of the British to defend India.

==Resolution for immediate independence==
The Congress Working Committee meeting at Wardha (14 July 1942) adopted a resolution demanding complete independence from the British government. The draft proposed massive civil disobedience if the British did not accede to the demands. It was passed at Bombay

However, it proved to be controversial within the party. A prominent Congress national leader, Chakravarti Rajgopalachari, quit the Congress over this decision, and so did some local and regional level organisers. Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Azad were apprehensive and critical of the call, but backed it and stuck with Gandhi&#x27;s leadership until the end. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad and Anugrah Narayan Sinha openly and enthusiastically supported such a disobedience movement, as did many veteran Gandhians and socialists like Asoka Mehta and Jayaprakash Narayan.

Allama Mashriqi, head of the Khaksar Tehrik, was called by Jawaharlal Nehru to join the Quit India Movement. Mashriqi was apprehensive of its outcome and did not agree with the Congress Working Committee&#x27;s resolution. On 28 July 1942, Allama Mashriqi sent the following telegram to Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Mohandas Gandhi, C. Rajagopalachari, Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad and Pattabhi Sitaramayya. He also sent a copy to Bulusu Sambamurti (former Speaker of the Madras Assembly). The telegram was published in the press, and stated:

The resolution said:
==Guidelines==

The guidelines of the movement that prevailed throughout the movement included disobedience of law, general strike among students, general strike amongst labour, formations of free Government, breaking of communications, refusal to pay taxes and others.

On 8 November 1942, Congress told people to perform ten duties &#x27;without any risk&#x27;:

# No transaction with any business either with the Britishers or their Government
# Every home and window exhibit tricoloured flag
# Do not see movies because this money &quot;goes to the tyrant Government&quot;
# Do not enter the Courts
# Do not purchase the foreign goods
# Withdrawal of your money from the Government Banks
# Boycott the servants of the British Government
# Do not transact any business for which you are asked to go to court
# Leave the cities and go to villages
# Let the grain and other things remain with the peasant.

==Opposition to the Quit India Movement==

Several political groups active during the Indian Independence Movement were opposed to the Quit India Movement. These included the Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha and princely states as below:

===Hindu Mahasabha===
Hindu nationalist parties like the Hindu Mahasabha openly opposed the call for the Quit India Movement and boycotted it officially. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the president of the Hindu Mahasabha at that time, even went to the extent of writing a letter titled &quot;Stick to your Posts&quot;, in which he instructed Hindu Sabhaites who happened to be &quot;members of municipalities, local bodies, legislatures or those serving in the army... to stick to their posts&quot; across the country, and not to join the Quit India Movement at any cost. But later after requests and persuasions and realising the importance of the bigger role of Indian independence he chose to join the Indian independence movement.

Following the Hindu Mahasabha&#x27;s official decision to boycott the Quit India movement, Syama Prasad Mukherjee, leader of the Hindu Mahasabha in Bengal, (which was a part of the ruling coalition in Bengal led by Krishak Praja Party of Fazlul Haq), wrote a letter to the British Government as to how they should respond, if the Congress gave a call to the British rulers to quit India. In this letter, dated 26 July 1942 he wrote:Let me now refer to the situation that may be created in the province as a result of any widespread movement launched by the Congress. Anybody, who during the war, plans to stir up mass feeling, resulting internal disturbances or insecurity, must be resisted by any Government that may function for the time being. In this way he managed to gain insights of the British government and effectively give information of the independence leaders. Mukherjee reiterated that the Fazlul Haq led Bengal Government, along with its alliance partner Hindu Mahasabha, would make every possible effort to defeat the Quit India Movement in the province of Bengal and made a concrete proposal as regards this:The question is how to combat this movement (Quit India) in Bengal? The administration of the province should be carried on in such a manner that in spite of the best efforts of the Congress, this movement will fail to take root in the province. It should be possible for us, especially responsible Ministers, to be able to tell the public that the freedom for which the Congress has started the movement, already belongs to the representatives of the people. In some spheres it might be limited during the emergency. Indian have to trust the British, not for the sake for Britain, not for any advantage that the British might gain, but for the maintenance of the defence and freedom of the province itself. You, as Governor, will function as the constitutional head of the province and will be guided entirely on the advice of your Minister.

===Others===

The Muslim League and Muhammad Ali Jinnah opposed the movement. Jinnah supported British war effort in the world war.

The Communist Party of India opposed the Quit India movement and supported the British war effort after Soviet Union was under attack.

While the movement had impact on princely states, some princes opposed the movement and funded the opposition.

==Local violence and parallel governments==
The movement significantly impacted military preparations of British Empire during the World War II as 57 infantry battalions were used to quell protests for months when they had to be used in the war. Airfield construction was also delayed for four to six weeks.

According to John F. Riddick, from 9 August 1942 to 21 September 1942, the Quit India Movement:
:...attacked 550 post offices, 250 railway stations, damaged many rail lines, destroyed 70 police stations, and burned or damaged 85 other government buildings. There were about 2,500 instances of telegraph wires being cut. The greatest level of violence occurred in Bihar. The Government of India deployed 57 battalions of British troops to restore order.

At the national level the lack of leadership meant the ability to galvanise rebellion was limited. The movement had a local impact in some areas. especially at Satara in Maharashtra, Talcher in Odisha, and Midnapore. In Tamluk and Contai subdivisions of Midnapore, the local populace were successful in establishing parallel government Tamluk National Government, which continued to function, until Gandhi personally requested the leaders to disband in 1944. A minor uprising took place in Ballia, now the easternmost district of Uttar Pradesh. People overthrew the district administration, broke open the jail, released the arrested Congress leaders and established their own independent rule. It took weeks before the British could reestablish their writ in the district. Of special importance in Saurashtra (in western Gujarat) was the role of the region&#x27;s &#x27;baharvatiya&#x27; tradition (i.e. going outside the law) which abetted the sabotage activities of the movement there. In Adas village in Kaira district, six people died and many more wounded in police shooting incident.

In rural west Bengal, the Quit India Movement was fuelled by peasants&#x27; resentment against the new war taxes and the forced rice exports. There was open resistance to the point of rebellion in 1942 until the great famine of 1943 suspended the movement in Bengal.

==Result of the movement==
One of the important achievements of the movement was keeping the Congress party united through all the trials and tribulations that followed. The British, already alarmed by the advance of the Japanese army to the India-Burma border, responded by imprisoning Gandhi. All the members of the Party&#x27;s Working Committee (national leadership) were imprisoned as well. Due to the arrest of major leaders, a young and until then relatively unknown Aruna Asaf Ali presided over the AICC session on 9 August and hoisted the flag; later the Congress party was banned. These actions only created sympathy for the cause among the population. Despite lack of direct leadership, large protests and demonstrations were held all over the country. Workers remained absent in large groups and strikes were called.

The demonstrations sometimes turned violent. At some places bombs exploded, government buildings were set on fire, electricity was cut, and transport and communication lines were severed.
The British swiftly responded with mass detentions. Over 100,000 arrests were made, mass fines were levied, and demonstrators were subjected to public flogging. Hundreds of civilians were killed in violence many shot by the police army. Many national leaders went underground and continued their struggle by broadcasting messages over the clandestine radio stations, distributing pamphlets and establishing parallel governments. The British sense of crisis was strong enough for a battleship to be specifically set aside to take Gandhi and the Congress leaders out of India, possibly to South Africa or Yemen. However, that step was ultimately not taken out of fear of intensifying the revolt. Leadership of the underground movement included names like Achyut Rao Patwardhan, Aruna Asaf Ali, Sucheta Kripalani, Daljit Singh and Nana Patil.

A sense that the movement could not gain prompt results had depressed many nationalists, while Jinnah and the Muslim League, as well as Congress opponents such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha sought to gain political mileage, criticising Gandhi and the Congress Party.

The Congress leadership was cut off from the rest of the world for over three years. Gandhi&#x27;s wife Kasturba Gandhi and his personal secretary Mahadev Desai died in months and Gandhi&#x27;s health was failing, despite this Gandhi went on a 21-day fast and maintained his resolve to continuous resistance. Although the British released Gandhi on account of his health in 1944, he kept up the resistance, demanding the release of the Congress leadership.

In 1945, when World War II had almost come to an end, the Labour Party of the United Kingdom won elections with a promise to provide independence to India. The jailed political prisoners were released in 1945.

<text>Ulcinj (, ; or ; ) is a town in the Coastal region of Montenegro and the capital of Ulcinj Municipality. It has an urban population of 11,488.

As one of the oldest settlements in the Adriatic coast, it was founded in 5th century BC. It was captured by the Romans in 163 BC from the Illyrians. With the division of the Roman Empire, it was a part of the Byzantine Empire and Serbian Kingdom in the Middle Ages until the Republic of Venice captured it in 1405. It was known as a base for piracy. In 1571, Ulcinj was conquered by the Ottoman Empire with the aid of North African corsairs after the Battle of Lepanto. The town gradually became a Muslim-majority settlement. Under the Ottomans, numerous hammams and mosques, and a clock tower were built. Ulcinj remained a den of piracy until this was finally put to an end by Mehmed Pasha Bushati. In 1673, the self-proclaimed Jewish Messiah Sabbatai Zevi was exiled here from Istanbul. Ulcinj remained an Ottoman town for more than 300 years until it was ceded to the Principality of Montenegro in 1878. It is a former medieval Catholic bishopric and remains a Latin titular see.

Ulcinj is a popular destination for tourists, because of its Long Beach, Lake Šas, Ada Bojana Island and for Ulcinj Castle, parts of which date back two millennia. There are 26 mosques in the town and surrounding countryside. Ulcinj is the centre of the Albanian community in Montenegro.

== Etymology ==
Early historian Livy (59 BC–AD 17) mentioned it, as did Pliny the Elder (23–79), who mentioned it as &quot;Olcinium&quot;, its old name &quot;Colchinium&quot;, &quot;founded by [settlers from] Colchis&quot; (Olchinium quod antea Colchinium dictum est a Colchis conditum). Ptolemy (90–168) mentions the city as Greek &quot;Oulkinion&quot; (Ουλκίνιον). Although the ancient writers preferred a connection with Cholchis, the name of the settlement appears to be connected with the Albanian word &quot;ujk&quot; or &quot;ulk&quot; (meaning wolf in English), from Proto-Albanian &quot;*(w)ulka&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*wĺ̥kʷos&quot;. In modern Albanian, it is known as &quot;Ulqin&quot;. The name, through Late (Vulgar) Roman, became Middle Latin Ulcinium, (), and &quot;Dolchin&quot;, modern Italian &quot;Dulcigno&quot; Slavic: &quot;Ulcinj&quot;, Old Serbian: Льцин, Ульцин and .

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
Ulcinj is an ancient seaport. The wider area of Ulcinj has been inhabited since the Bronze Age, based on dating of Illyrian tombs (tumuli) found in the village of Zogaj, in the vicinity of Ulcinj. The town is believed to have been founded in the 5th century BC by colonists from Colchis, as mentioned in the 3rd century BC poem by Apollonius of Rhodes. Illyrians lived in the region at the time as there are traces of immense Cyclopean walls still visible in the old Citadel.

All through the pre-medieval period, Ulcinj was known as a pirate capital of the Adriatic Sea. This is also seen during the later period of Illyrian Kingdom. From 20 BC to around 300 AD, the inhabitants of Ulcinj were known to be very confrontational towards foreigners they were especially concerned by border disputes.

=== Roman ===

In 168 BC, during the Third Illyrian War, Olcinium broke with Gentius and defected to the Romans (Livy 45:26:2). Under Roman rule the town received the status of &quot;oppidum civium Romanorum&quot; (settlement of Roman citizens), only to be later granted &quot;municipium&quot; (independent town) status.

The &quot;Periplus Maris Erythraei&quot; names several Indian ports from where large ships sailed in an easterly direction to &quot;Khruse&quot; (Kruče - seaside village in Ulcinj).

From circa 820, the city was the see of a Diocese of Ulcinj, which was only suppressed in 1532, and would be revived as a Latin titular bishopric.

=== Medieval period ===
In the 9th century, it was in the Dyrrhachium theme, a military governorate of the Byzantine Empire. In 1010, &quot;Tsar&quot; Samuel of Bulgaria (r. 997-1014†) failed to conquer the town during the war against the Byzantines.
By 1040, &quot;archon&quot; Stefan Vojislav of Duklja conquered the region. In 1183, Serbian Prince Stefan Nemanja conquered Olcinium and the town prospered as one of the most significant coastal towns. Ulcinj remained in Nemanjić hands in their Kingdom and Empire, and after the death of Emperor Dušan (r. 1331-1355†), the region, known as &quot;Lower Zeta&quot;, was under the supervision of &quot;gospodin&quot; Žarko, a &quot;voivode&quot; of Emperor Uroš the Weak until his death in 1360. Žarko&#x27;s lands were then held by the Balšić family. Under Balšić control, Ulcinj continued to be an important town and also minted coins.

=== Venetian and Ottoman rule ===

According to historian Luigi Paulucci at the time of the Venetians the town was half Albanian, a quarter Venetian and one quarter Slavic.

In 1496 Arnold von Harff created a German-Albanian dictionary simply by interacting with the population of the city.

The Venetians attempted to capture the town twice, in 1696 and 1718, but were unsuccessful on both occasions.

During the 19th century, the town began to regain its position as a flourishing port. The geographer Antonio Baldacci reported a merchant marine of 500 ships plying the trade routes between the Adriatic and Mediterranean coasts.

In 1867, Ulcinj became a kaza of the İşkodra sanjak of Rumeli veyalet. After the Congress of Berlin in 1878, borders between Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire were redrawn, with Plav and Gusinje being ceded to Montenegro. But Muslim Albanian resistance prevented the Montenegrins from taking over Plav and Gusinje, so the Great Powers in 1880 decided to reverse the territorial transfer and offered Ulcinj, then also known as Dulcigno, to Montenegro as compensation. This led to a dispute between the Ottoman Empire and the Principality of Montenegro as the Ottoman Empire initially refused to recognize the treaty&#x27;s provisions regarding Dulcigno. The Ottoman garrison in the town had been in place since the 16th century, but Montenegro claimed that the town and its surrounding territory were historically part of its territory.

In May 1880, the Great Powers (Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia) protested diplomatically and organized a naval demonstration off the coast of Dulcigno to put pressure on the Ottoman Empire to resolve the dispute peacefully. The Ottoman Empire eventually agreed to cede the town and surrounding territory to Montenegro in exchange for compensation. The surrender of Dulcigno to Montenegro marked a significant expansion of Montenegro&#x27;s territory and was seen as a diplomatic victory for the Great Powers, who had prevented a potentially violent conflict in the region.

After the city&#x27;s annexation to Montenegro, of its 8,000-strong population about 3,000 Albanians left and settled elsewhere in northern Albania. 142 Montenegrin families were brought to settle in the outskirts of Ulcinj in the 1880s. The population of Ulcinj steadily decreased until the post-WWII period.

=== 20th century to present ===

Ulcinj became a part of the Kingdom of Montenegro from 1878 until 1918 when Montenegro was absorbed into the Kingdom of Serbia for a short time before all would be incorporated into the first of the Yugoslav federations at the end of the year. Ulcinj remained within a Montenegrin entity whilst a South Slavic state had existed until 2006 when which it became part of an independent Montenegro following a referendum.

During the 20th century, Ulcinj survived heavy declines and new ascents. Ulcinj was the second biggest town of Montenegro when it joined the kingdom in 1880. In just three decades, it slid back to 6th place for economic development and number of inhabitants (after Podgorica, Niksic, Cetinje, Tivat and Plava). During World War I Ulcinj was conquered by Austria-Hungary in 1916 and Italy on November 4, 1918, and since 1920 it was part of the Serbo-Croatian-Slovenian Kingdom, later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

As the southernmost city of the coast of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Ulcinj had a strong turnaround in the 1930s with the development of the tourist industry. At that time hotels were built such as Krištja, Republic, Jadran and Koop (later Galeb). World War II halted economic momentum. From 1941 to 1944, Ulcinj was under the Albanian administration. On November 7, 1943, Ulcinj was bombarded by Allied forces, with over 46 people killed and many more injured. The Yugoslav Partisans took Ulcinj on November 26, 1944, and the city become part of Socialist Yugoslavia.

The 1950s and 1960s marked the greatest period of economic development for Ulcinj, with the construction of a range of modern hotels in the city and the Great Plain, as well as major economic collectives (NHT &quot;Riviera of Ulcinj&quot;, &quot;Agroulqini&quot;, Primary Building Company, &quot;Otrantkomerc&quot;, &quot;Ultep&quot; and others). In the catastrophic Montenegro earthquake on April 15, 1979, the city was severely damaged, but after only a few years, with the solidarity of the citizens of entire Yugoslavia, it was quickly renovated. Ulcinj at the end of the eighties had about 40 percent of the tourist turnover in Montenegro, while two-thirds of the guests were foreign, mostly German.

During the Kosovo War, in 1998 and 1999, thousands of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Ulcinj and its surroundings, where they were welcomed in the best possible conditions by the ethnic Albanian population of Ulcinj and the surrounding area.

== Police and intelligence career ==
Doval joined the Indian Police Service (IPS) in 1968 in the Kerala cadre as the Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) of Kottayam district.

Doval worked in Thalassery, Kerala, for a few months in 1972, before joining the central service. He has the experience of being involved in the termination of all 15 hijackings of Indian Airlines aircraft from 1971 to 1999.

In 2012, IB eyed on him due to then ruling party Congress&#x27;s suspicions on Doval and his think tank VIF with the doubts that he and VIF were the brains behind Ramdev and Anna Hazare led anti-corruption movement, which generated anger against government.

Doval has also spoken internationally at global events, citing the ever-increasing need of co-operation between the major established and emerging powers of the world.

==National Security Advisor (2014–present)==

On 30 May 2014, Doval was appointed as India&#x27;s fifth National Security Advisor. In June 2014, Doval facilitated the return of 46 Indian nurses who were trapped in a hospital in Tikrit, Iraq, following the capture of Mosul by ISIL. Doval, flew to Iraq on 25 June 2014 to understand the position on the ground and make high-level contacts in the Iraqi government. Although the exact circumstances of their release are unclear, on 5 July 2014, ISIL militants handed the nurses to Kurdish authorities at Erbil city and an Air India plane specially-arranged by the Indian government brought them back home to Kochi.

Along with Army Chief General Dalbir Singh Suhag, Doval planned a cross-border military operation against National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-K) separatists operating out of Myanmar. Indian officials claimed that the mission was a success and 20-38 separatist belonging to Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-K) were killed in the operation. However, the Myanmar government denied the strikes. According to Myanmar officials, the Indian operation against NSCN-K took place entirely on the Indian side of the border.
He is widely credited for the doctrinal shift in Indian national security policy in relation to Pakistan. It was speculated that the September 2016 Indian strikes in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir were his brainchild. Doval is widely credited along with then Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar and Indian Ambassador to China Vijay Keshav Gokhale, for resolving Doklam Standoff through diplomatic channels and negotiations.

In October 2018, he was appointed as the Chairman of the Strategic Policy Group (SPG), which is the first tier of a three-tier structure at the National Security Council and forms the nucleus of its decision-making apparatus.

After Pakistan based terrorist attacked convoy of CRPF by car bomb in Pulwama which resulted in the deaths of 40 CRPF personnel, India airforce conducted an airstrike on alleged terrorist bases in Pakistan. Doval was one of the seven persons who knew about India&#x27;s classified 2019 Balakot airstrike, including Indian Navy, army, Airforce chiefs and prime minister Narendra Modi. Following the airstrike and retaliatory 2019 Jammu and Kashmir airstrikes and subsequent capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman by Pakistani military, Ajit Doval held talks with US Secretary of State and National Security Advisor to secure the release of the Indian pilot.

On 3 June 2019, he was reappointed as NSA for 5 years and granted the personal rank of a Cabinet Minister. Doval is the first NSA to hold such a rank. He is widely considered to be one of Modi&#x27;s most powerful and trusted advisors, with major influence over India&#x27;s national security and foreign affairs.
He was also an instrumental figure in revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

On 26 February 2020, Ajit Doval walked the streets of riot-hit northeast Delhi to assess the situation and reassure the local residents.

On 15 May 2020, the military forces of Myanmar handed over a group of 22 militant leaders, active in Assam and other northeast states, to the Indian government. This was made possible through negotiations headed by Doval.

<doc id="797653" wikidata="Q2091594" url="?curid=797653" title="Climate of India">
<text>The climate of India consists of a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography. Based on the Köppen system, India encompasses a diverse array of climatic subtypes. These range from arid and semi-arid regions in the west to highland, sub-arctic, tundra, and ice cap climates in the northern Himalayan regions, varying with elevation. 

The northern lowlands experience subtropical conditions which become more temperate at higher altitudes, like the Sivalik Hills, or continental in some areas like Gulmarg. In contrast, much of the south and the east exhibit tropical climate conditions, which support lush rainforests in parts of these territories. Many regions have starkly different microclimates, making it one of the most climatically diverse countries in the world. The country&#x27;s meteorological department follows four seasons with some local adjustments: winter (December to February), summer (March to May), monsoon or south-west monsoon (June to September) and post-monsoon or north-east monsoon (October to November). Some parts of the country with subtropical, temperate or continental climates also experience spring and autumn.

India&#x27;s geography and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert in the northwest and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to create a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth&#x27;s highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer. The climate in South India is generally warmer, and more humid due to its coastlines. However some hill stations in South India such as Ooty are well known for their cold climate. 

Though the Tropic of Cancer—the boundary that is between the tropics and subtropics—passes through the middle of India, the bulk of the country can be regarded as climatically tropical. As in much of the tropics, monsoonal and other weather patterns in India can be strongly variable: epochal droughts, heat waves, floods, cyclones, and other natural disasters are sporadic, but have displaced or ended millions of human lives. Such climatic events are likely to change in frequency and severity as a consequence of human-induced climate change. Ongoing and future vegetative changes, sea level rise and inundation of India&#x27;s low-lying coastal areas are also attributed to global warming.

==Paleoclimate==


===History===
During the Triassic period of 251–199.6 Ma, the Indian subcontinent was the part of a vast supercontinent known as Pangaea. Despite its position within a high-latitude belt at 55–75° S—latitudes now occupied by parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, as opposed to India&#x27;s current position between 8 and 37° N—India likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm and frost-free weather, though with well-defined seasons. India later merged into the southern supercontinent Gondwana, a process beginning some 550–500 Ma. During the Late Paleozoic, Gondwana extended from a point at or near the South Pole to near the equator, where the Indian craton (stable continental crust) was positioned, resulting in a mild climate favorable to hosting high-biomass ecosystems. This is underscored by India&#x27;s vast coal reserves—much of it from the late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence—the fourth-largest reserves in the world. During the Mesozoic, the world, including India, was considerably warmer than today. With the coming of the Carboniferous, global cooling stoked extensive glaciation, which spread northwards from South Africa towards India; this cool period lasted well into the Permian.

Tectonic movement by the Indian Plate caused it to pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68 Ma, at the end of the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.

More recently, in the Holocene epoch (4,800–6,300 years ago), parts of what is now the Thar Desert were wet enough to support perennial lakes; researchers have proposed that this was due to much higher winter precipitation, which coincided with stronger monsoons. Kashmir&#x27;s erstwhile subtropical climate dramatically cooled 2.6–3.7 Ma and experienced prolonged cold spells starting 600,000 years ago.

==Regions==
India is home to an extraordinary variety of climatic regions, ranging from tropical in the south to temperate and alpine in the Himalayan north, where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall. The nation&#x27;s climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the Hindu Kush mountains in Pakistan, prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. Simultaneously, the Thar Desert plays a role in attracting moisture-laden south-west monsoon winds between June and October, which provide the majority of India&#x27;s rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate, into which fall the seven climatic zones, that as designated by experts, are defined on the basis of such traits as temperature and precipitation. Groupings are assigned codes (see chart) according to the Köppen climate classification system.

===Tropical===
A tropical rainy climate governs regions experiencing persistent warm or high temperatures, which normally do not fall below . India predominantly hosts two climatic subtypes that fall into this group: tropical monsoon climate and tropical savanna climate.

The most humid is the tropical wet climate—also known as the tropical monsoon climate—that covers a strip of southwestern lowlands abutting the Malabar Coast, the Western Ghats, and southern Assam. India&#x27;s two island territories, Lakshadweep and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, are also subject to this climate. Characterised by moderate to high year-round temperatures, even in the foothills, its rainfall is seasonal but heavy—typically above per year. Most rainfall occurs between May and November; this moisture is enough to sustain lush forests, swampy areas and other vegetation for the rest of the mainly dry year. December to March are the driest months, when days with precipitation are rare. The heavy monsoon rains are responsible for the exceptional biodiversity of tropical wet forests in parts of these regions.

In India a tropical savanna climate is more common. Noticeably drier than areas with a tropical monsoon type of climate, it prevails over most of inland peninsular India except for a semi arid rain shadow east of the Western Ghats. Winter and early summer are long and dry periods with temperatures averaging above . Summer is exceedingly hot; temperatures in low-lying areas may exceed during May, leading to heat waves that can each kill hundreds of Indians. The rainy season lasts from June to September; annual rainfall averages between across the region. Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September, most significant precipitation in India falls on Tamil Nadu and Puducherry leaving other states comparatively dry.

The Ganges Delta lies mostly in the tropical wet climate zone: it receives between of rainfall each year in the western part, and in the eastern part. The coolest month of the year, on average, is January; April and May are the warmest months. Average temperatures in January range from , and average temperatures in April range from . July is on average the coldest and wettest month: over of rain falls on the delta.

Additionally, Nicobar Islands rain forests experience a Tropical rainforest climate. 

===Arid and semi-arid regions=== 
Arid and semi-arid climate dominates regions where the rate of moisture loss through evapotranspiration exceeds that from precipitation;

A semi-arid steppe climate (hot semi-arid climate) predominates over a long stretch of land south of Tropic of Cancer and east of the Western Ghats and the Cardamom Hills. The region, which includes Karnataka, inland Tamil Nadu, western Andhra Pradesh, and central Maharashtra, gets between annually. It is drought-prone, as it tends to have less reliable rainfall due to sporadic lateness or failure of the southwest monsoon. Karnataka is divided into three zones—coastal, north interior and south interior. Of these, the coastal zone receives the most precipitation, averaging per annum, far in excess of the state average of . In contrast to norm, Agumbe in the Shivamogga district receives the second highest annual rainfall in India. North of the Krishna River, the summer monsoon is responsible for most rainfall; to the south, significant post-monsoon rainfall also occurs in October and November. In December, the coldest month, temperatures still average around . The months between March and May are hot and dry; mean monthly temperatures hover around , with precipitation. Hence, without artificial irrigation, this region is not suitable for permanent agriculture.

Most of western Rajasthan experiences an arid climatic regime (hot desert climate). Cloudbursts are responsible for virtually all of the region&#x27;s annual precipitation, which totals less than . Such bursts happen when monsoon winds sweep into the region during July, August, and September. Such rainfall is highly erratic; regions experiencing rainfall one year may not see precipitation for the next couple of years or so. Atmospheric moisture is largely prevented from precipitating due to continuous downdrafts and other factors. The summer months of May and June are exceptionally hot; mean monthly temperatures in the region hover around , with daily maxima occasionally topping . During winters, temperatures in some areas can drop below freezing due to waves of cold air from Central Asia. There is a large diurnal range of about during summer; this widens by several degrees during winter. There is a small desert area in the south near Adoni in Andhra Pradesh, the only desert in South India, experiencing maximum temperatures of in summers and in winters.
To the west, in Gujarat, diverse climate conditions prevail. The winters are mild, pleasant, and dry with average daytime temperatures around and nights around with virtually full sun and clear nights. Summers are hot and dry with daytime temperatures around and nights no lower than . In the weeks before the monsoon temperatures are similar to the above, but high humidity makes the air more uncomfortable. Relief comes with the monsoon. Temperatures are around but humidity is very high; nights are around . Most of the rainfall occurs in this season, and the rain can cause severe floods. The sun is often occluded during the monsoon season.

East of the Thar Desert, the Punjab–Haryana–Kathiawar region experiences a tropical and sub-tropical steppe climate. Haryana&#x27;s climate resembles other states of the northern plains: extreme summer heat of up to and winter cold as low as . May and June are hottest; December and January are coldest. Rainfall is varied, with the Shivalik Hills region being the wettest and the Aravalli Hills region being the driest. About 80 percent of the rainfall occurs in the monsoon season of July–September, which can cause flooding. The Punjabi climate is also governed by extremes of hot and cold. Areas near the Himalayan foothills receive heavy rainfall whereas those eloigned from them are hot and dry. Punjab&#x27;s three-season climate sees summer months that span from mid-April to the end of June. Temperatures in Punjab typically range from , but can reach in summer and fall to in winter (while most of the nation does not experience temperatures below even in winter). The zone, a transitional climatic region separating tropical desert from humid sub-tropical savanna and forests, experiences temperatures that are less extreme than those of the desert. Although the average annual rainfall is , it is very unreliable; like in much of the rest of India, the southwest monsoon accounts for most precipitation. Summer daily maxima are around . All this results in a natural vegetation typically comprising short, coarse grasses.

===Subtropical humid===
Most of Northeast India and much of North India are subject to a humid subtropical climate and a subtropical highland climate. Though they experience warm to hot summers, temperatures during the coldest months generally fall as low as . Due to ample monsoon rains, India has two subtropical climate subtypes under the Köppen system: &quot;Cwa&quot; and &quot;Cwb&quot;. In most of this region, there is very little precipitation during the winter, owing to powerful anticyclonic and katabatic (downward-flowing) winds from Central Asia.

Humid subtropical regions are subject to pronounced dry winters. Winter rainfall—and occasionally snowfall—is associated with large storm systems such as &quot;Nor&#x27;westers&quot; and &quot;Western disturbances&quot;; the latter are steered by westerlies towards the Himalayas. Most summer rainfall occurs during powerful thunderstorms associated with the southwest summer monsoon; occasional tropical cyclones also contribute. Annual rainfall ranges from less than in the west to over in parts of the northeast. As most of this region is far from the ocean, the wide temperature swings more characteristic of a continental climate predominate; the swings are wider than in those in tropical wet regions, ranging from in north-central India to in the east.

===Mountain===
India&#x27;s northernmost areas are subject to a montane, or alpine, climate. In the Himalayas, the rate at which an air mass&#x27;s temperature falls per kilometre (3,281 ft) of altitude gained (the dry adiabatic lapse rate) is 9.8 °C/km. In terms of environmental lapse rate, ambient temperatures fall by for every rise in altitude. Thus, climates ranging from nearly tropical in the foothills to tundra above the snow line can coexist within several hundred metres of each other. Sharp temperature contrasts between sunny and shady slopes, high diurnal temperature variability, temperature inversions, and altitude-dependent variability in rainfall are also common.

The northern side of the western Himalayas, also known as the trans-Himalayan belt, has a cold desert climate. It is a region of barren, arid, frigid and wind-blown wastelands. Areas south of the Himalayas are largely protected from cold winter winds coming in from the Asian interior. The leeward side (northern face) of the mountains receives less rain.

The southern slopes of the western Himalayas, well-exposed to the monsoon, get heavy rainfall. Areas situated at elevations of 1,070–2,290 metres (3,510–7,510 ft) receive the heaviest rainfall, which decreases rapidly at elevations above . Most precipitation occurs as snowfall during the late winter and spring months. The Himalayas experience their heaviest snowfall between December and February and at elevations above . Snowfall increases with elevation by up to several dozen millimetres per 100 metre (~2 in; 330 ft) increase. Elevations above never experience rain; all precipitation falls as snow.

==Seasons==
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) designates four climatological seasons:
* Winter, occurring from December to February. The year&#x27;s coldest months are December and January, when temperatures average around in the northwest; temperatures rise as one proceeds towards the equator, peaking around in mainland India&#x27;s southeast.
* Summer or Pre-monsoon season, lasting from March to June. In western and southern regions, the hottest month is April and the beginning of May and for northern regions of India, May is the hottest Month. In May, Temperatures average around in most of the interior.
* South-west monsoon lasting from June to September. The season is dominated by the humid southwest summer monsoon, which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June. Monsoon rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October. South India typically receives more rainfall.
* Post-monsoon or North-east monsoon season, lasting from October to November. In the northwest of India, October and November are usually cloudless. Tamil Nadu receives most of its annual precipitation in the northeast monsoon season.

The Himalayan states, being more temperate, experience an additional season, &quot;spring&quot;, which coincides with the first weeks of summer in southern India. Traditionally, North Indians note six seasons or &quot;Ritu&quot;, each about two months long. These are the spring season (&quot;&quot;), summer (&quot;grīṣma&quot;), monsoon season (&quot;varṣā&quot;), autumn (&quot;śarada&quot;), winter (&quot;hemanta&quot;), and prevernal season (&quot;śiśira&quot;). These are based on the astronomical division of the twelve months into six parts. The ancient Hindu calendar also reflects these seasons in its arrangement of months.

=== Winter ===
Once the monsoons subside, average temperatures gradually fall across India. As the Sun&#x27;s vertical rays move south of the equator, most of the country experiences moderately cool weather. December and January are the coldest months, with the lowest temperatures occurring in the Indian Himalayas. Temperatures are higher in the east and south.

In northwestern India region, virtually cloudless conditions prevail in October and November, resulting in wide diurnal temperature swings; as in much of the Deccan Plateau, they register at . However, from January to February, &quot;western disturbances&quot; bring heavy bursts of rain and snow. These extra-tropical low-pressure systems originate in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. They are carried towards India by the subtropical westerlies, which are the prevailing winds blowing at North India&#x27;s range of latitude. Once their passage is hindered by the Himalayas, they are unable to proceed further, and they release significant precipitation over the southern Himalayas.

There is a huge variation in the climatic conditions of Himachal Pradesh due to variation in altitude (450–6500 metres). The climate varies from hot and subtropical humid (450–900 metres) in the southern low tracts, warm and temperate (900–1800 metres), cool and temperate (1900–2400 metres) and cold glacial and alpine (2400–4800 metres) in the northern and eastern elevated mountain ranges. By October, nights and mornings are very cold. Snowfall at elevations of nearly 3000 m is about 3 m and lasts from December start to March end. Elevations above 4500 m support perpetual snow. The spring season starts from mid February to mid April. The weather is pleasant and comfortable in the season. The rainy season starts at the end of the month of June. The landscape lushes green and fresh. During the season streams and natural springs are replenished. The heavy rains in July and August cause a lot of damage resulting in erosion, floods and landslides. Out of all the state districts, Dharamshala receives the highest rainfall, nearly about . Spiti is the driest area of the state, where annual rainfall is below 50 mm. The five Himalayan states (Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir in the extreme north, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh in far east) and Northern West Bengal experience heavy snowfall, Manipur and Nagaland are not located in the Himalayas but experience occasional snowfall; in Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, blizzards occur regularly, disrupting travel and other activities.

The rest of North India, including the Indo-Gangetic Plain and Madhya Pradesh almost never receives snow. Temperatures in the plains occasionally fall below freezing, though never for more than one or two days. Winter highs in Delhi range from . Nighttime temperatures average . In the plains of Punjab, lows can fall below freezing, dropping to around in Amritsar. Frost sometimes occurs, but the hallmark of the season is the notorious fog, which frequently disrupts daily life; fog grows thick enough to hinder visibility and disrupt air travel 15–20 days annually. In Bihar in middle of the Ganges plain, hot weather sets in and the summer lasts until the middle of June. The highest temperature is often registered in late May or early June which is the hottest time. Like the rest of the north, Bihar also experiences dust-storms, thunderstorms and dust raising winds during the hot season. Dust storms having a velocity of are most frequent in May and with second maximum in April and June. The hot winds (loo) of Bihar plains blow during April and May with an average velocity of . These hot winds greatly affect human comfort during this season. Rain follows. The rainy season begins in June. The rainiest months are July and August. The rains are the gifts of the southwest monsoon. There are in Bihar three distinct areas where rainfall exceeds . Two of them are in the northern and northwestern portions of the state; the third lies in the area around Netarhat. The southwest monsoon normally withdraws from Bihar in the first week of October. Eastern India&#x27;s climate is milder but gets colder as one moves north west, experiencing moderately warm days to cool days and cool nights to cold nights. Highs ranges from 18 °C to 23 °C (64 °F to 73 °F) in Patna; to 22 °C to 27 °C (72 °F to 80 °F) in Kolkata (Calcutta); lows averages from 7 °C to 10 °C (45 °F to 50 °F) in Patna; to 12 °C to 15 °C (54 °F to 59 °F) in Kolkata. In Madhya Pradesh which is towards the south-western side of the Gangetic Plain similar conditions prevail albeit with much less humidity levels. Capital Bhopal averages low of and high of .

Frigid winds from the Himalayas can depress temperatures near the Brahmaputra River. The Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan plateau by preventing frigid and dry Arctic winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding temperate regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the monsoon winds, keeping them from travelling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the Terai region instead. The Himalayas are indeed believed to play an important role in the formation of Central Asian deserts such as the Taklamakan and Gobi. The mountain ranges prevent western winter disturbances in Iran from travelling further east, resulting in much snow in Kashmir and rainfall for parts of Punjab and northern India. Despite the Himalayas being a barrier to the cold northerly winter winds, the Brahmaputra valley receives part of the frigid winds, thus lowering the temperature in Northeast India and Bangladesh. The Himalayas contain the greatest area of glaciers and permafrost outside of the poles, and account for the origin of ten of Asia&#x27;s largest rivers. The two Himalayan states in the east, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, receive substantial snowfall. The extreme north of West Bengal centred on Darjeeling experiences snowfall, but only rarely.

In South India, particularly the hinterlands of Maharashtra, parts of Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, somewhat cooler weather prevails. Minimum temperatures in eastern Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh hover around ; in the southern Deccan Plateau, they reach . Coastal areas—especially those near the Coromandel Coast and adjacent low-elevation interior tracts—are warm, with daily high temperatures of and lows of around . The Western Ghats, including the Nilgiri Range, are exceptional; lows there can fall below freezing. This compares with a range of on the Malabar Coast; there, as is the case for other coastal areas, the Indian Ocean exerts a strong moderating influence on weather. The region averages 

===Summer===
Summer in northwestern India starts from April and ends in July, and in the rest of the country from March to May but sometimes lasts to mid June. The temperatures in the north rise as the vertical rays of the Sun reach the Tropic of Cancer. The hottest month for the western and southern regions of the country is April; for most of North India, it is May. Temperatures of and higher have been recorded in parts of India during this season. Another striking feature of summer is the Loo. These are strong, gusty, hot, dry winds that blow during the day in India. Direct exposure to the heat that comes with these winds may be fatal. In cooler regions of North India, immense pre-monsoon squall-line thunderstorms, known locally as &quot;Nor&#x27;westers&quot;, commonly drop large hailstones. In Himachal Pradesh, Summer lasts from mid April till the end of June and most parts become very hot (except in alpine zone which experience mild summer) with the average temperature ranging from to . Near the coast, the temperature hovers around , and the proximity of the sea increases the level of humidity. In southern India, the temperatures are higher on the east coast by a few degrees compared to the west coast.

By May, most of the Indian interior experiences mean temperatures over , while maximum temperatures often exceed . In the hot months of April and May, western disturbances, with their cooling influence, may still arrive, but rapidly diminish in frequency as summer progresses. Notably, a higher frequency of such disturbances in April correlates with a delayed monsoon onset (thus extending summer) in northwest India. In eastern India, monsoon onset dates have been steadily advancing over the past several decades, resulting in shorter summers there.

Altitude affects the temperature to a large extent, with higher parts of the Deccan Plateau and other areas being relatively cooler. Hill stations, such as Ootacamund (&quot;Ooty&quot;) in the Western Ghats and Kalimpong in the eastern Himalayas, with average maximum temperatures of around , offer some respite from the heat. At lower elevations, in parts of northern and western India, a strong, hot, and dry wind known as the loo blows in from the west during the daytime; with very high temperatures, in some cases up to around ; it can cause fatal cases of sunstroke. Tornadoes may also occur, concentrated in a corridor stretching from northeastern India towards Pakistan. They are rare, however; only several dozen have been reported since 1835.

===Monsoon===

The southwest summer monsoon, a four-month period when massive convective thunderstorms dominate India&#x27;s weather, is Earth&#x27;s most productive wet season. A product of southeast trade winds originating from a high-pressure mass centred over the southern Indian Ocean, the monsoonal torrents supply over 80% of India&#x27;s annual rainfall. Attracted by a low-pressure region centred over South Asia, the mass spawns surface winds that ferry humid air into India from the southwest. These inflows ultimately result from a northward shift of the local jet stream, which itself results from rising summer temperatures over Tibet and the Indian subcontinent. The void left by the jet stream, which switches from a route just south of the Himalayas to one tracking north of Tibet, then attracts warm, humid air.

The main factor behind this shift is the high summer temperature difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. This is accompanied by a seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a low-pressure belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India. This system intensified to its present strength as a result of the Tibetan Plateau&#x27;s uplift, which accompanied the Eocene–Oligocene transition event, a major episode of global cooling and aridification which occurred 34–49 Ma.

The southwest monsoon arrives in two branches: the Bay of Bengal branch and the Arabian Sea branch. The latter extends towards a low-pressure area over the Thar Desert and is roughly three times stronger than the Bay of Bengal branch. The monsoon typically breaks over Indian territory by around 25 May, when it lashes the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. It strikes the Indian mainland around 1 June near the Malabar Coast of Kerala. By 9 June, it reaches Mumbai; it appears over Delhi by 29 June. The Bay of Bengal branch, which initially tracks the Coromandal Coast northeast from Cape Comorin to Orissa, swerves to the northwest towards the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The Arabian Sea branch moves northeast towards the Himalayas. By the first week of July, the entire country experiences monsoon rain; on average, South India receives more rainfall than North India. However, Northeast India receives the most precipitation. Monsoon clouds begin retreating from North India by the end of August; it withdraws from Mumbai by 5 October. As India further cools during September, the southwest monsoon weakens. By the end of November, it has left the country.

Monsoon rains affect the health of the Indian economy; as Indian agriculture employs 600 million people and constitutes 20% of the national GDP, good monsoons correlate with a booming economy. Weak or failed monsoons (droughts) result in widespread agricultural losses and substantially hinder overall economic growth. Yet such rains reduce temperatures and can replenish groundwater tables and rivers.

===Post-monsoon===
During the post-monsoon or autumn months of October to December, a different monsoon cycle, the northeast (or &quot;retreating&quot;) monsoon, brings dry, cool, and dense air masses to large parts of India. Winds spill across the Himalayas and flow to the southwest across the country, resulting in clear, sunny skies. Though the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and other sources refers to this period as a fourth (&quot;post-monsoon&quot;) season, other sources designate only three seasons. Depending on location, this period lasts from October to November, after the southwest monsoon has peaked. Less and less precipitation falls, and vegetation begins to dry out. In most parts of India, this period marks the transition from wet to dry seasonal conditions. Average daily maximum temperatures range between in the Southern parts.

The northeast monsoon, which begins in September, lasts through the post-monsoon seasons, and only ends in March. It carries winds that have already lost their moisture out to the ocean (opposite from the summer monsoon). They cross India diagonally from northeast to southwest. However, the large indentation made by the Bay of Bengal into India&#x27;s eastern coast means that the flows are humidified before reaching Cape Comorin and rest of Tamil Nadu, meaning that the state, and also some parts of Kerala, experience significant precipitation in the post-monsoon and winter periods. However, parts of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Mumbai also receive minor precipitation from the north-east monsoon.

==Statistics==
Shown below are temperature and precipitation data for selected Indian cities; these represent the full variety of major Indian climate types. Figures have been grouped by the four-season classification scheme used by the Indian Meteorological Department; year-round averages and totals are also displayed.

===Temperature===

===Precipitation===
==Disasters==

Climate-related natural disasters cause massive losses of Indian life and property. Droughts, flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides brought on by torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms, which usually track from north to south; they cause extensive property damage in North India and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, causing severe damage to standing crops such as rice and wheat.

===Floods and landslides===

In the Lower Himalayas, landslides are common. The young age of the region&#x27;s hills result in labile rock formations, which are susceptible to slippages. Short duration high intensity rainfall events typically trigger small scale landslides while long duration low intensity rainfall periods tend to trigger large scale catastrophic landslides. Rising population and development pressures, particularly from logging and tourism, cause deforestation. The result, denuded hillsides, exacerbates the severity of landslides, since tree cover impedes the downhill flow of water. Parts of the Western Ghats also suffer from low-intensity landslides. Avalanches occur in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.

Floods are the most common natural disaster in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops. Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become increasingly common in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures. Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.

===Tropical cyclones===

Tropical cyclones, which are severe storms spun off from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, may affect thousands of Indians living in coastal regions. Tropical cyclogenesis is particularly common in the northern reaches of the Indian Ocean in and around the Bay of Bengal. Cyclones bring with them heavy rains, storm surges, and winds that often cut affected areas off from relief and supplies. In the North Indian Ocean Basin, the cyclone season runs from April to December, with peak activity between May and November. Each year, an average of eight storms with sustained wind speeds greater than form; of these, two strengthen into true tropical cyclones, which sustain gusts greater than . On average, a major (Category 3 or higher) cyclone develops every other year.

During summer, the Bay of Bengal is subject to intense heating, giving rise to humid and unstable air masses that morph into cyclones. The 1737 Calcutta cyclone, the 1970 Bhola cyclone, and the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone rank among the most powerful cyclones to strike India, devastating the coasts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Widespread death and property destruction are reported every year in the exposed coastal states of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. India&#x27;s western coast, bordering the more placid Arabian Sea, experiences cyclones only rarely; these mainly strike Gujarat and Maharashtra, less frequently in Kerala.

The 1999 Odisha cyclone was the most intense tropical cyclone in this basin and also the most powerful tropical cyclone to make landfall in India. With peak winds of , it was the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane. Almost two million people were left homeless;another 20 million people lives were disrupted by the cyclone. Officially, 9,803 people died from the storm; unofficial estimates place the death toll at over 10,000.

===Droughts===

Indian agriculture is heavily dependent on the monsoon as a source of water. In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons results in water shortages, resulting in below-average crop yields. This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Western Orissa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the past, droughts have periodically led to major Indian famines. These include the Bengal famine of 1770, in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876–1877 famine, in which over five million people died; the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5 million died; and the Bengal famine of 1943, in which over five million died from starvation and famine-related illnesses.

All such episodes of severe drought correlate with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Niño-related droughts have also been implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to —have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell that began in the 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India&#x27;s droughts. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.

===Heat waves===
A study from 2005 concluded that heat waves significantly increased in frequency, persistence and spatial coverage in the decade 1991–2000, when compared to the period between 1971–80 and 1981–90. A severe heat wave in Orissa in 1998 resulted in nearly 1300 deaths. Based on observations, heat wave related mortality has increased in India prior to 2005. The 2015 Indian heat wave killed more than 2,500 people. In April 2024, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasted a heat wave spell lasting approximately ten to twenty days longer than normal length of four to eight days during the three-month period between April and June. In June 2024 tempretures reached 50 degrees and in New Delhi temperesture were at their highest in six years overnight. Five people have been reported as dead due to this current heatwave.

==Extremes==

===Extreme temperatures: low===
India&#x27;s lowest recorded temperature was in Dras, Ladakh. However, temperatures on Siachen Glacier near Bilafond La () and Sia La () have fallen below , while blizzards bring wind speeds in excess of , or hurricane-force winds ranking at 12—the maximum—on the Beaufort scale. These conditions, not hostile actions, caused more than 97% of the roughly 15,000 casualties suffered among Indian and Pakistani soldiers during the Siachen conflict.

===Extreme temperatures: high===
The highest temperature ever recorded in India occurred on 16 May 2016 in Phalodi, Rajasthan at . The India Meteorological Department declared the reading of reported in Delhi on 29 May 2024 to be off by 3°C. A temperature of up to has been recorded in Jaisalmer District on 2 May 2016 near the border of Pakistan but the standard conditions are yet to be verified.

===Rain===

The average annual precipitation of in the village of Mawsynram, in the hilly northeastern state of Meghalaya, is the highest recorded in Asia, and possibly on Earth. The village, which sits at an elevation of , benefits from its proximity to both the Himalayas and the Bay of Bengal. However, since the town of Cherrapunji, to the east, is the nearest town to host a meteorological office—none has ever existed in Mawsynram—it is officially credited as being the world&#x27;s wettest place. In recent years the Cherrapunji-Mawsynram region has averaged between of rain annually, though Cherrapunji has had at least one period of daily rainfall that lasted almost two years. India&#x27;s highest recorded one-day rainfall total occurred on 26 July 2005, when Mumbai received ; the massive flooding that resulted killed over 900 people.

===Snow===
Remote regions of Jammu and Kashmir, such as the Pir Panjal Range, experience exceptionally heavy snowfall. Kashmir&#x27;s highest recorded monthly snowfall occurred in February 1967, when fell in Gulmarg, though the IMD has recorded snowdrifts up to in several Kashmiri districts. In February 2005, more than 200 people died when, in four days, a western disturbance brought up to of snowfall to parts of the state.

==Climate change==

== Atmospheric pollution ==

Thick haze and smoke originating from burning biomass in northwestern India and air pollution from large industrial cities in northern India often concentrate over the Ganges Basin. Prevailing westerlies carry aerosols along the southern margins of the sheer-faced Tibetan Plateau towards eastern India and the Bay of Bengal. Dust and black carbon, which are blown towards higher altitudes by winds at the southern margins of the Himalayas, can absorb shortwave radiation and heat the air over the Tibetan Plateau. The net atmospheric heating due to aerosol absorption causes the air to warm and convect upwards, increasing the concentration of moisture in the mid-troposphere and providing positive feedback that stimulates further heating of aerosols.

<text>Filippo Juvarra (7 March 1678 – 31 January 1736) was an Italian architect, scenographer, engraver and goldsmith. He was active in a late-Baroque architecture style, working primarily in Italy, Spain, and Portugal.

==Biography==

Juvarra was born in Messina, Sicily, to a family of goldsmiths and engravers. He spent his formative years with his family in Sicily, working in the family shop, but also studied for the priesthood, to which he was ordained in 1703. At the same time, he made his mark as a draughtsman - designing Messina&#x27;s festive settings for the coronation of Philip V of Spain and Sicily (1701) - and studied architecture independently, working from books alone, such as those by Vitruvius and Vignola. Juvarra moved to Rome in 1704. There he studied architecture with Carlo and Francesco Fontana.

The first phase of his independent career was occupied with designs for ceremonies and celebrations, and especially with set designs for theatres. Juvarra&#x27;s set designs incorporate the &quot;scena per angolo&quot;, literally &#x27;scenes at an angle.&#x27; The exact origin of this style is unclear. Ferdinando Galli Bibiena claims to have invented it in his treatise &quot;Architettura Civile&quot; (1711). However, the style was clearly in use before then, including in the works of Juvarra. This style differed from the one-point perspective sets that had been developed in the sixteenth century and had reached their apogee in the seventeenth century; see, for example, the work of Giacomo Torelli. A couple of early drawings by Juvarra, dated 1706, are associated with the San Bartolomeo Theater in Naples, though whether he actually completed the set designs for the theatre is unknown. The majority of his work in theatre and set design was in Rome under the patronage of Cardinal Ottoboni. He assisted in the rebuilding of the Cardinal&#x27;s private theatre in the Palazzo della Cancelleria and also designed sets for operas performed within the theatre. The first opera for which Juvarra designed all the sets was &quot;Costantino Pio&quot;, with libretto by Cardinal Ottoboni and music by CF Pollarolli. The opera premiered in 1709, inaugurated Ottoboni&#x27;s newly renovated private theatre, and was one of the first operas to appear after the lifting of papal bans on secular theatre. He also worked on set designs for performances sponsored by Ottoboni at the Teatro Capranica. His other main patron in Rome was Marie Casimire d&#x27;Arquien, the widowed former Queen of Poland, for whom Juvarra produced set designs for the operas performed in her small domestic theatre in the Palazzo Zuccari. In 1713 a theatre project took him to Genoa.

In 1706 Juvarra won a contest for the new sacristy at the St. Peter&#x27;s, organized by Pope Clement XI, and became a member of the prestigious Accademia di San Luca. In 1708 he created his first important non-theatrical architectural work, and the only one realized in Rome: the small but superbly executed Antamoro Chapel in the church of San Girolamo della Carità which he conceived in intimate cooperation with his close friend, the French sculptor Pierre Le Gros, who created the chapel sculptures.
Juvarra was also an engraver: his book of engravings of sculpted coats-of-arms appeared in 1711, &quot;Raccolta di varie targhe fatte da professori primarii di Roma&quot;.

After some time in Rome, Juvarra spent some time in his native Messina where he developed ambitious plans (never completed) for building along the harborside with a massive curved palace facade for residences and businesses. He was engaged in some projects in Lombardy, including a monumental altar for the Sanctuary Church of Caravaggio (never built, and substituted by a smaller work by architect Carlo Giuseppe Merlo), and the altar for the Bergamo Cathedral. He also designed the decorative belltower (now leaning) for the cathedral of Belluno.

==Churches in Turin==

In 1714, Juvarra began to design the architectural works for which he is best known, when he was recruited to Piedmont where Victor Amadeus II of Savoy first employed him in a scenographic project, then elevated Juvarra to the position of chief court architect.

In Turin, Juvarra designed the facade of the church of Santa Cristina (1715–1718), the church of San Filippo, the church of Santa Croce, the Basilica della Natività, and the chapel of San Giuseppe (1725) in the church of Santa Teresa. He also designed and built the church of the Blessed Virgin of the Carmine (1732-1736), where the space is concentrated around the central hall with the scenographic effect of light falling from above. He also helped decorate the interior of many churches in Turin.

One of Juvarra&#x27;s masterworks, the Basilica of Superga, was built in 1731 and rises at the top of a mountain overlooking the city of Turin. It was part-picturesque monument and part-royal mausoleum for the House of Savoy. Reputedly, the site was chosen because of a vow taken here by the then duke, and future king, Victor Amadeus II of Savoy, as he surveyed the field of operations while defending the city from the besieging French armies during the Battle of Turin. Construction was arduous, and took over fourteen years, including two years to flatten the mountaintop; and at incredible cost and effort to bring the stones and supplies to the peak. Behind the church, a monastery was erected. The classical portico is appended to a centralized church with a highly vertical, seventy-five metre, baroque dome; the latter creates a mountain atop a mountain effect.

He also built other churches, including the bizarre, Borrominesque church of San Gregorio in Messina, Sicily. In Mantua, he added a tall buttressed dome to the Alberti church of Sant&#x27;Andrea.

== Palaces in Portugal ==
The fame obtained in Piedmont led to demand for his talent and capacities at some of the richest noble and royal courts of Europe: in 1719 he was in Portugal, planning the palace at Mafra for King John V (1719–20), after which he travelled to London and Paris.

The project of Filippo Juvarra for the Royal Palace of Lisbon was planned starting in 1719, as an ambitious palatial complex alongside the Tagus river in Lisbon. The project included not only a monumental royal palace for King John V and the Portuguese royal court, but also a new cathedral for the Patriarch of Lisbon.

During his stay in Portugal he also made schemes for the creation of a monumental lighthouse in Lisbon at the mouth of the Tagus river with the Atlantic Ocean.

== Palaces in Northern Italy ==
The Palace of Stupinigi (1729–1731) was built to be the royal hunting lodge some 6 miles outside of Turin, the huge layout and highly decorated interiors made this palace a grand setting for summer retreats. The massive oval central pavilion, topped by a bronze stag, fronted with large arched windows, and extending into angled wings, is the mixture of classicism and whimsy that describes the ornamented delights of Italian Rococo. Juvarra fulfilled the needs of his patron for classical grandeur, but with the baroque urge to decorate, to construct buildings as if they were made with curling ribbons. The pavilion interior, highly decorated with stucco and gilded details, fulfils the expectations further. Juvarra also received a commission to restore and refurbish the massive palace complex of the Savoy monarchy at Venaria Reale, called the Reggia di Venaria Reale, and its church of Sant’Uberto. The latter, in its unfinished state, sports eclectic influences, with an octagonal dome and embracing wings arching outward.

One of his masterworks in palace construction is the façade (1718–21) of the Palazzo Madama, Turin. It recalls the formality of Palladio’s Palazzo Chiericati but with the enhancement of detail and windows. While the facade appears to house an airy &quot;piano nobile&quot;, it in fact is merely a scenic, almost theatrical gesture, sheltering a grandiose entry stairway entrance to a medieval castle. But this work was also part of an ambitious program to recast the crowded, medieval layout of central Turin into a more open and planned set of connected plazas. He also designed the &quot;Royal Gate&quot; of the Sanctuary of Oropa, near Biella.

Juvarra also built the third enlargement of Turin to the west according to the orthogonal system introduced by Ascanio Vitozzi and Carlo di Castellamonte: the project included construction of Palazzo Martini di Cigala (1716) and of the Quartieri Militari (1716–1728). He helped design the ‘’Court of Appeals’’ in Turin, a work completed by his successor, Benedetto Alfieri. He also helped design a palace in Milan. He created designs (never completed) for updating the Castle of Rivoli. The Neapolitan Corrado Giaquinto was among the artists that Juvarra invited to help decorate palaces, such as the Villa della Regina in Turin.

==Palaces in Madrid==
On Christmas Eve in 1734, the ancient Royal Alcazar of Madrid was destroyed by fire. This prompted the Bourbon king of Spain, Philip V to request Juvarra to supervise the construction of a new Palace. By April 1735 the architect had moved to Madrid, and began planning for the construction. The plans we have would have created an even larger structure than the present one with ample gardens. The linear facade has a formal rigidity lacking in some of his other works. He additionally executed designs for the façade of the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso and for some portions of Royal Palace of Aranjuez. Juvarra however died suddenly by January 1736, less than nine months after arriving in Spain. While a wooden mockup was built of his plans for the Royal Palace, all his designs there were executed after his death by his pupils, including Giovanni Battista Sacchetti.

==Influence==
Some writers noting that Juvarra&#x27;s early training was in Rome, attribute his style to the instruction of Carlo Fontana, but Juvarra was eclectic in production and seems to have imbibed many other influences, including the more adventurous architecture of Pietro da Cortona and Francesco Borromini. He was also likely influenced by the works of Guarino Guarini. Baroque architects strongly influenced by Juvarra include Bernardo Vittone and Benedetto Alfieri. Juvarra and Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach influenced one another through the medium of engravings. Juvarra&#x27;s work, along with much of Baroque art and architecture, fell out of favour with the rise of Neoclassicism. In 1994, a major exhibition of his designs was held in Genoa and Madrid.

<doc id="797667" wikidata="Q938118" url="?curid=797667" title="Cantus firmus">
<text>In music, a cantus firmus (&quot;fixed melody&quot;) is a pre-existing melody forming the basis of a polyphonic composition.

The plural of this Latin term is , although the corrupt form &quot;canti firmi&quot; (resulting from the grammatically incorrect treatment of &quot;cantus&quot; as a second- rather than a fourth-declension noun) can also be found. The Italian is often used instead: (and the plural in Italian is ).

==History==
The term first appears in theoretical writings early in the 13th century (e.g., Boncampagno da Signa, &quot;Rhetorica novissima&quot;, 1235). The earliest polyphonic compositions almost always involved a cantus firmus, typically a Gregorian chant, although by convention the term is not applied to music written before the 14th century. The earliest surviving polyphonic compositions, in the &quot;Musica enchiriadis&quot; (around 900 AD), contain the chant in the top voice, and the newly composed part underneath; however, this usage changed around 1100, after which the cantus firmus typically appeared in the lowest-sounding voice. Later, the cantus firmus appeared in the tenor voice (from the Latin verb &#x27;tenere&#x27;, to hold), singing notes of longer duration, around which more florid lines, instrumental and/or vocal, were composed or improvised.

Composition using a cantus firmus continued to be the norm through the 13th century: almost all of the music of the St. Martial and Notre Dame schools uses a cantus firmus, as well as most 13th century motets. Many of these motets were written in several languages, with the cantus firmus in the lowest voice; the lyrics of love poems might be sung in the vernacular above sacred Latin texts in the form of a trope, or the sacred text might be sung to a familiar secular melody.

In the 14th century, the technique continued to be widely used for most sacred vocal music, although considerable elaboration began to appear: while most continental composers used isorhythmic methods, in England other composers experimented with a &quot;migrant&quot; cantus firmus, in which the tune moved from voice to voice, but without itself being elaborated significantly. Elaborations came later, in what was to be known as the paraphrase technique; this compositional method became important in composition of masses by the late 15th century. (See paraphrase mass.)

The cyclic mass, which became the standard type of mass composition around the middle of the 15th century, used cantus firmus technique as its commonest organising principle. At first the cantus firmus was almost always drawn from plainchant, but the range of sources gradually widened to include other sacred sources and even sometimes popular songs. The cantus firmus was at first restricted to the tenor, but by the end of the century many composers experimented with other ways of using it, such as introducing it into each voice as a contrapuntal subject, or using it with a variety of rhythms. During the 16th century the cantus firmus technique began to be abandoned, replaced with the parody (or imitation) technique, in which multiple voices of a pre-existing source were incorporated into a sacred composition such as a mass. Yet while composers in Italy, France, and the Low Countries used the parody and paraphrase techniques, composers in Spain, Portugal, and Germany continued to use the cantus firmus method in nationally idiosyncratic ways.

Probably the most widely set of the secular cantus firmus melodies was &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot;. Over 40 settings are known, including two by Josquin des Prez, and six by an anonymous composer or composers in Naples, which were intended as a cycle. Many composers of the middle and late Renaissance wrote at least one mass based on this melody, and the practice lasted into the seventeenth century, with a late setting by Carissimi. There are several theories regarding the meaning of the name: one suggests that the &quot;armed man&quot; represents St Michael the Archangel, while another suggests that it refers to the name of a popular tavern (Maison L&#x27;Homme Armé) near Dufay&#x27;s rooms in Cambrai. Being that this music arose shortly after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, it is possible that the text &quot;the armed man should be feared&quot; arose from the fear of the Ottoman Turks, who were expanding militarily towards central Europe. There are numerous other examples of secular cantus firmi used for composition of masses; some of the most famous include: &quot;Se la face ay pale&quot; (Dufay), &quot;Fortuna desperata&quot; (attributed to Antoine Busnois), &quot;Fors seulement&quot; (Johannes Ockeghem), &quot;Mille Regretz&quot;, and &quot;Westron Wynde&quot; (anonymous).

German composers in the Baroque period in Germany, notably Bach, used chorale melodies as cantus firmi. In the opening movement of Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, the chorale &quot;O Lamm Gottes, unschuldig&quot; appears in long notes, sung by a separate choir of boys &quot;in ripieno&quot;.

==As a teaching tool==

* Using a cantus firmus as a means of teaching species counterpoint was the basis of &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; by Johann Joseph Fux, although the method was first published by Girolamo Diruta in 1610. Counterpoint is still taught routinely using a method adapted from Fux, and based on the cantus firmus. Cantus firmi used to teach counterpoint adhere to certain rules of music theory, including beginning and ending on a tonic note, and only containing consonant intervals.

==As metaphor==
Several writers have used &quot;cantus firmus&quot; as a metaphor. Kate Gross used it for those childhood pursuits that give her happiness and define her - pursuits that she calls the &quot;enduring melody&quot; of her life.

Dietrich Bonhoeffer also uses the metaphor for love for God in his &quot;Letters and Papers from Prison&quot;.

<text>Tony Millionaire (born Scott Richardson in 1956) is an American cartoonist, illustrator and author known for his syndicated comic strip &quot;Maakies&quot; and the &quot;Sock Monkey&quot; series of comics and picture books.

==Personal life==
Born Scott Richardson in 1956, Tony Millionaire grew up in and around the seaside town of Gloucester, Massachusetts. He was married to actress Becky Thyre, and has two daughters, Phoebe and Pearl.

He came from a family of artists – his father was a commercial illustrator, his mother and grandparents were painters – and was encouraged to draw from an early age. His grandfather, who was a friend of the cartoonist Roy Crane, had a large collection of old Sunday comics, which were an early source of inspiration to Millionaire. He drew his first comic strip, &quot;about an egg-shaped superhero who flew around talking about how great he was and then crashing into a cliff,&quot; when he was nine years old. During high school, Millionaire continued to draw comic strips for his own amusement. 

In 2022, he stated in an interview he was in recovery from alcoholism and lived in Yarmouth, Maine with artist and educator, Kat Gillies.

==Career==
After high school, Millionaire attended the Massachusetts College of Art, where he majored in painting. While in college, he began drawing houses for money; this, along with occasional illustration jobs, would be his primary source of income for the next 20 years. After graduating from college, he moved from place to place, living in Boston; Florida; California; and Italy; before settling in Berlin for five years during the 1980s. Returning to the U.S. in the early &#x27;90s, he moved to Brooklyn, where he began drawing a regular comic strip, &quot;Medea&#x27;s Weekend&quot;, for the Williamsburg newsweekly &quot;Waterfront Week&quot;.

One night at a local bar, the Six Twelve, Millionaire drew &quot;a cartoon about a little bird who drank booze and blew his brains out&quot; on a napkin – the origin of his best-known character, Drinky Crow. The bartender encouraged him to draw more cartoons, offering him a free beer for each one he completed. After doing many of these cocktail napkin drawings, Millionaire began drawing more polished versions of his cartoons for publication in various zines, including Spike Vrusho&#x27;s &quot;Murtaugh&quot; and Selwyn Harris&#x27;s &quot;HappyLand&quot;. He also did drawings for several trade journals and Al Goldstein&#x27;s notorious tabloid &quot;Screw&quot;. Eventually the alternative newsweekly &quot;New York Press&quot; asked him to draw a weekly strip, and in 1994, &quot;Maakies&quot; debuted in its pages. It soon spread to other papers across the country. During the mid-2000s, Millionaire transferred &quot;Maakies&quot; to &quot;The Village Voice&quot; as its NYC venue, but returned it to the &quot;New York Press&quot; in February 2007.

Besides &quot;Maakies&quot;, Millionaire produced a series of comics and picture books, collectively titled &quot;Sock Monkey&quot;. He formerly contributed to comics anthologies including &quot;Legal Action Comics&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Tales&quot;, Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, &quot;Dirty Stories&quot;, and &quot;Bizarro Comics&quot;. His illustrations were published in publications including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. For a time he contributed art to Dave Eggers&#x27; magazine &quot;The Believer&quot;. Animated versions of his work were featured on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in the They Might Be Giants documentary &quot;Gigantic&quot;, and on &quot;Adult Swim&quot;. In 2006, Fantagraphics Books published his graphic novel &quot;Billy Hazelnuts&quot;. Starting February 10, 2010, Millionaire&#x27;s comic &quot;Maakies&quot; was published weekly in &quot;Nib-Lit&quot; for a period of time. Nib-Lit went offline by 2020 leaving Millionaire without an outlet for his work.

==Style and influences==
Millionaire draws in a lush style that mingles naturalistic detail with strong doses of the fanciful and grotesque. His linework resembles that of Johnny Gruelle, whom he cites as one of his main sources of inspiration, along with Ernest Shepard and &quot;all those freaks from the twenties and thirties who did the newspaper strips&quot;; many of Millionaire&#x27;s admirers adduce a similarity to the work of E. C. Segar in particular. He draws with a fountain pen.

The nautical settings of much of Millionaire&#x27;s work draw inspiration from his childhood memories of his grandparents&#x27; artwork and seaside home, as well as the novels of Patrick O&#x27;Brian, of which he is an avid reader.

==Pseudonym==
Tony Millionaire&#x27;s birth name is Scott Richardson, which he admitted in a YouTube video he posted in 2021.

Yet, he maintains that &quot;Tony Millionaire&quot; is his real name: &quot;It is my legal name, and it&#x27;s been around a lot longer than I&#x27;ve been a cartoonist.&quot; He has said his unusual surname is an Old French word meaning &quot;a person who owns a thousand serfs,&quot; but the origin of the name &quot;Tony Millionaire&quot; is a character in an episode of the 1960s TV series &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. 

Millionaire has speculated that in the future he may publish some family-friendly works of his under a different moniker, in order to dissociate them from his other, more ribald output.

<doc id="797675" wikidata="Q7198899" url="?curid=797675" title="Pitchout">
<text>In baseball or softball, a pitchout is a ball that is intentionally thrown high and outside the strike zone with the purpose of preventing a stolen base, thwarting a hit and run, or to prevent a run-scoring play on a suicide squeeze play. The pitcher delivers the ball in such a manner for it to be unhittable and in a position where the catcher can quickly leap to his feet to catch it. A well-thrown pitchout will allow the catcher to receive the ball standing up as opposed to their usual squat, giving them a better line to throw to a base without the pitcher or the batter obstructing their vision or aim. Moreover, it is easier to throw a ball with more force from a standing position than it is from a squat, which is why most catchers leap to their feet when attempting to throw out a base stealer. A pitchout is a type of intentional ball, but differs in that a pitchout is thrown harder to give the catcher the most time to throw out the base runner.

The pitchout can be called for when the manager or catcher believes that an existing baserunner is likely to attempt a steal, and forms one of the two (with the pickoff) main countermeasures a pitcher can take against a potential stealer. A runner attempting to steal on a pitchout will have a more difficult time beating the throw to second base and almost no chance of stealing third barring a mistake by the catcher or the third baseman.

The pitchout can also be used against the hit and run. As the pitch is unhittable, the runner will have to attempt a straight steal against a prepared catcher. On a suicide squeeze play, when the runner is already running from third once the pitch has been thrown, a pitchout can be used to prevent the batter from being able to bunt the ball, allowing the catcher to tag the runner trying to score.

Pitchouts have become less frequent in Major League Baseball games than they were in the 1980s and before; sabermetricians have questioned their effectiveness. Around 1990, pitchouts could be seen in 8 MLB games out of every 10 on average; by 2015, that figure has fallen to 1 out of every 10. While pitchouts do help catch stealing runners - the rate caught stealing goes from 27% on non-pitchouts to 52% from data from 2011-2015 - stealing in general is less common than it was in the 1980s. Thus, the risk of granting the batter a free ball when no stealing attempt is actually being made is higher, and runners who steal frequently - the most important reason to use a pitchout - appear in fewer games.

<doc id="797678" wikidata="Q375236" url="?curid=797678" title="Earl of Richmond">
<text>The now-extinct title of Earl of Richmond was created many times in the Peerage of England. The earldom of Richmond was initially held by various Breton nobles; sometimes the holder was the Breton duke himself, including one member of the cadet branch of the French Capetian dynasty. The historical ties between the Duchy of Brittany and this English earldom were maintained ceremonially by the Breton dukes even after England ceased to recognize the Breton dukes as earls of England and those dukes rendered homage to the King of France, rather than the English crown. It was then held either by members of the English royal families of Plantagenet and Tudor, or English nobles closely associated with the English crown. It was eventually merged into the English crown during the reign of Henry VII of England and has been recreated as a Dukedom.

==History==
The title Earl of Richmond is associated with the now extinct earldom, the earlier lords of Richmond who held the Honour of Richmond, one of the most important fiefs in England, and eventually the dukes of Richmond. The title of earl predates the French-Breton-Norman title of count (&quot;comte&quot;), but the two became interchangeable in the time of William the Conqueror.

From their first creation, the lords and earls of Richmond were leading members of the ruling class of post-Conquest England, as defined by Keats-Rohan as &quot;[those holding fiefs, (the right to collect fees)] held in some relationship in the feudal chain from the king of England, whether the holder be Norman, Breton, Manceau, Poitevin, Fleming or Anglo-Saxon.&quot; &quot; In William I&#x27;s Conquest of England in fact &quot;the regional origin of [the Conquerors] ...was not exclusively Norman, ... and the size of the Breton contingent ... is generally agreed to be the most significant.&quot; Until the late 12th century, all the earls of Richmond were Breton noblemen.

The Earldom of Richmond was frequently associated with the accumulation of great wealth within England.

The earl was frequently known in the courts of the kings of France and the dukes of Brittany as &quot;comte de Richemont&quot; or other spelling variations, where in the courts of England and Brittany, French was frequently used.

===The lords of Richmond===
The Honour of Richmond preceded the Earldom of Richmond. The Honour conveyed, among other things, economic rights to the holder. The Honour of Richmond was reputed to be among the wealthiest in England. It appears to have been in existence in England from 1071 shortly after the Harrying of the North, a military campaign which followed the Battle of Hastings (1066). This was before the title Earl of Richmond was held in accordance with any strict legal principle. It was initially awarded to Breton nobles from the ducal family of Brittany by the king of England. It represented, among other things, the close association of England and Brittany.

Early holders of the honour of Richmond were sometimes known as lords of Richmond rather than as earls. The Honour of Richmond and the title Earl of Richmond, were held principally by Breton nobles, and often by the duke of Brittany, except for two periods from 1241 to 1268 and from 1286 to 1372. In 1435 the title was granted to the House of Plantagenet, before the Duchy of Brittany was permanently annexed to the crown of France. The title was definitively returned to crown during the reign of the Tudor kings. It was first granted to Alan Rufus in 1071 by William the Conqueror. The honour, which was assessed for the service of 60 knights, was one of the most important fiefs in Norman England.

===Earls of Richmond===

The 1st Earl of Richmond was the Breton warrior Alan Rufus (c. 1040–1093). He was related to both the duke of Normandy and the duke of Brittany. He was a grandson of Duke Geoffrey I of Brittany and Hawise of Normandy and the second son of Odo, Count of Penthièvre. He most probably took part in William the Conqueror&#x27;s invasion of England, after which he obtained grants of land in various parts of England, including manors formerly held by Earl Edwin in Yorkshire. Alan Rufus would be the first of as many as four brothers to constitute the Breton Richmond-Penthievre family in England. He built the Richmond Castle in Richmond. As he was William the Conqueror&#x27;s double second cousin, Keats-Rohan would describe him a member of the English nobility, that is the holder of a fief who are also a member of a kin-group, albeit a member of the Breton contingents within William&#x27;s conquering army. The Bretons within William&#x27;s army were composed of three groups, and at one time one of those contingents, led by Ralph de Gael revolted; as Lord of Richmond, Alan&#x27;s lands would be expanded by some of those forfeited by Ralph. This is taken by historians as symbolic of the loyalty that Alan Rufus displayed to William, and from this time Richmond would remain in the hands of the most loyal of English kings&#x27; nobles and also represent a means for the King to allocate wealth to his closest &quot;kin-group&quot; in the sense defined by Keats-Rohan. Alan Rufus emerged as the wealthiest and most important of the Breton nobles around William I, was a key supporter of William II in the events preceding, during and following the Rebellion of 1088 and may have participated in the invasion of Normandy in 1091.

Alan Rufus died on 4 August 1093 due to an unknown cause. His succession settled quickly upon his younger brother, another Alan, nicknamed &quot;Niger&quot; (&quot;The Black&quot;), who seems to have died by 1098. Stephen, their younger brother, inherited Richmond. Stephen died between 1135 and 1138, and was succeeded in Brittany by his eldest son, Geoffrey Boterel II, a supporter of the Empress Matilda, and in England by a younger son, Alan, also nicknamed &quot;The Black&quot;, who was an ally of King Stephen during The Anarchy.

The Penthièvre brothers who held the territorial designation as Lords of Richmond are often reckoned as de facto &#x27;earls of Richmond&#x27;, though they were not so in the later strictly legal sense. Through the reign of King Henry I few earldoms had been created. King Stephen&#x27;s reign was marked by the creation of several new earldoms.

Stephen of Tréguier&#x27;s son Alan (c. 1116–1146), was the first of these lords to be styled &quot;Earl of Richmond&quot; in a strictly legal sense. King Stephen also created Alan 1st Earl of Cornwall although this title would be forfeit in 1141 after the Battle of Lincoln. Alan of Brittany is recorded as riding at King Stephen&#x27;s side in the Battle of Lincoln. Alan Rufus, Stephen of Tréguier, and Alan were members of &quot;the Richmond-Penthievre... [family, and this family]... maintained its rivalry with its ducal cousins [in Brittany] into the next century&quot;.

Alan married Bertha, daughter and heiress of Duke Conan III of Brittany. Alan died in 1146 at which time his widow returned to Brittany. Their son, Duke Conan IV of Brittany (c. 1138–1171) married Margaret of Huntingdon, sister of King Malcolm IV of Scotland. Conan asserted his right to Brittany, and with it Richmond; he transferred the title Earl of Richmond during his lifetime to his daughter Constance (c. 1161–1201).

Constance married three times, and each of her husbands in turn assumed the title of earl of Richmond &quot;jure uxeris&quot;, in conjunction with that of Duke of Brittany (also &quot;jure uxeris&quot;). They were: Geoffrey Plantagenet (1158–1186), son of Henry II of England; Ranulph de Blondeville, Earl of Chester (c. 1172–1232) ; and Guy de Thouars (d. 1213), who survived his wife for twelve years. The only son of the first marriage, Arthur (1187–1203), was styled Earl of Richmond in his mother&#x27;s lifetime. On his likely murder at the hands of his uncle, King John (&quot;John Lackland [English] or Jean sans Terres [French]&quot;), the earldom&#x27;s possession was disputed. Arthur&#x27;s legal heir, his full elder sister, Eleanor, is sometimes considered to have succeeded him as Countess of Richmond in 1208, but due to her claims to England, Brittany, Anjou and Aquitaine, King John kept her imprisoned from 1202 and gave her no lands of the earldom.

To complicate matters, Constance of Brittany had two daughters by her third marriage, the elder of whom, Alix, was proclaimed Duchess of Brittany by the Breton lords and given in marriage to Peter Mauclerc by King Philip II of France, in 1213. Alix used the title &quot;Countess of Richmond&quot; from 1203 to her death in 1221. As a result of his marriage to Alix, Pierre was styled Duke of Brittany and Earl of Richmond, but the latter title was only officially proclaimed in 1218, during the reign of Henry III, while Eleanor was apparently deprived of her last title. Peter Mauclerc was the founder of the Breton House of Dreux. The title would continue in the House of Dreux for some time, although from time to time, it was forfeited, or it reverted to the crown. About 1235 Peter Mauclerc renounced his allegiance to England, and consequently suffered forfeiture of his English estates. Despite some better treatments including the grant of the Swaffham manor, the title and other lands of the earldom were however not restored to Eleanor, who remained confined until her death in 1241; William of Savoy was granted Honour of Richmond in 1236.

In 1241 Henry III granted the estates of Richmond to Peter of Savoy (1203–1268), uncle of his queen consort, Eleanor of Provence. Peter was thereafter described as Earl of Richmond by contemporary chroniclers. By his will, Savoy left Richmond to his niece, Eleanor, who transferred it to the crown. That year, 1268, Henry III granted the earldom to John I, Duke of Brittany (1217–1286), son of Pierre Mauclerc. The title was recreated for John I&#x27;s heir, John II, Duke of Brittany. In 1306 the title was granted to his son John of Brittany who entered into the service of Edward I and Edward II of England. As an earl, John of Brittany was particularly inattentive to English politics. He had a distinguished record as a diplomat working on behalf of these Kings of England and was a frequent warrior in their military quests, both on the continent and in Britain. Upon John of Brittany&#x27;s death, the title passed to his nephew, John III, Duke of Brittany.

The earldom was then passed to John of Montfort, John III&#x27;s half-brother. John III had no issue and upon his death the inheritance of the Duchy of Brittany became disputed. John III&#x27;s niece Joan of Penthievre claimed the duchy without apparently claiming to be hereditary countess of Richmond. John III&#x27;s half-brother, John of Montfort, disputed Joan&#x27;s claim to the duchy and their dispute was initially adjudicated by the French king in a court of peers in Conflans, France. In that adjudication, Charles of Blois, Joanna&#x27;s husband, gained recognition as Duke of Brittany and John of Montfort fled. The Breton War of Succession ensued. The French king&#x27;s adjudication raised the question of whether the Duke of Brittany and separately the Earl of Richmond, whether one and the same or not, owed homage to the French king as vassal. John of Montfort fled Conflans in order to regain his troops who occupied many fortified castles in a line from Nantes to Brittany. The French king raised an army to defend the interests of Charles of Blois and seized the county of Montfort from John of Montfort. The king then proposed to Jean de Montfort that he would permit him to retain the Earldom of Richmond if John accepted the adjudication of Conflans and returned to the French court as a loyal vassal. Edward III reacted by supporting Jean de Montfort.

In 1342, the title reverted to Edward III and would remain for a time behind the &quot;shield of England&quot; as the competing claims of the French and English crowns were played out, first in the Breton War of Succession and then across the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Edward III granted the Earldom to his son John of Gaunt, who then surrendered it in 1372. The earldom was then given to Duke John V of Brittany, but on his death or possibly at an earlier date through forfeiture, it reverted to the crown and was to remain behind the &quot;shield of England&quot; and away from any attempts of the French crown to acquire it and the related properties.

From 1414 to 1435 the earldom of Richmond was held by John Plantagenet, Duke of Bedford. In 1453 it was conferred on Edmund Tudor, half-brother to King Henry VI. When Edmund&#x27;s son Henry ascended the throne as Henry VII in 1485, the earldom of Richmond merged in the crown, and for the next forty years there was no further grant of the title. After Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, became King Henry VII of England, the title Duke of Richmond was created by the Tudor Dynasty, and over time generally overtook the use of the title Earl of Richmond. The earldom has not been recreated since.

===Titular Earls===
There was a close association with the Duchy of Brittany from the inception of the honours and titles associated with Richmond until the reign of John V. After John V, the English crown ceased to recognize the Breton rulers as Earls of Richmond and the crown frequently assigned the Honour of Richmond to English nobles. In Brittany, the Dukes who succeeded John V continued to use the title Earl of Richmond, or in French, &quot;Comte de Richemont&quot;. Francis II was the last Duke of Brittany associated with the courtesy title. He waived all rights to holdings in England an assigned them to Henry Tudor, in advance of Henry&#x27;s armed invasion of England. After Henry&#x27;s attainment of the English throne, the Earl of Richmond and the Honour of Richmond were merged with the English crown.

===The Tudor Dynasty===
Edmund Tudor had been educated by Catherine de la Pole, the Abbess of Barking, who brought him to Henry VI&#x27;s attention. Upon attaining adulthood, Edmund joined Henry VI at court. In 1449 Henry VI knighted him and then circa 1452 summoned Edmund to parliament as the Earl of Richmond. He had one son, Henry VII who was born posthumously circa 1456. 

===Subsequent Dukes of Richmond===
The Earldom of Richmond was replaced by the Dukedom of Richmond which was named after Richmond and its surrounding district of Richmondshire. It has been held by members of the royal Tudor and Stuart families. The current dukedom of Richmond initially maintained the historic ties of Richmond to Brittany when it was created in 1675 for Charles Lennox: he was the illegitimate son of King Charles II of England and a noble bretonne, Louise de Penancoët de Kérouaille.

==List of the Lords and Earls of Richmond==

===Earls of Richmond (early Lords of Richmond)===

*Alan Rufus (d. 1093) – built Richmond Castle, ally of William the Conqueror
*Alan the Black (d. 1098)
*Stephen, Count of Tréguier (d. 1136) – the younger brother of Alan Rufus

===Earls of Richmond, 1st Creation (1136)===
*Alan the Black, 1st Earl of Richmond (d.1146) – third son of Stephen of Treguier; husband of Bertha, Duchess of Brittany, daughter of Conan III. Alan died before she became Duchess.
*Conan IV, Duke of Brittany (d.1171) – son of Alan the Black and Bertha of Brittany; the first Duke of Brittany to hold the title directly; the Earldom was seized in 1158 by Henry II of England after Conan seized the County of Nantes and it was returned to Conan when the latter returned the County of Nantes to Henry II. The latter acted as a regent when Conan abdicated in favour of his daughter Constance of Brittany and would later confer the title on his son Geoffrey in connection with his marriage to Constance.
*Constance, Duchess of Brittany (1183–1201).
*Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany – Earl of Richmond &quot;jure uxoris&quot; (1183-1186).
*Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester – Earl of Richmond jure uxoris (1189–1198).
*Guy of Thouars – Earl of Richmond &quot;jure uxoris&quot; (1199–1201).
*Arthur I, Duke of Brittany (1196–1203) – son of Geoffrey and Constance; succeeded his mother in her lifetime. Imprisoned by his uncle King John of England (&quot;Jean sans Terres&quot;) since 1202, disappeared in 1203 and viewed as having died in 1208. The circumstances of Arthur&#x27;s death were a factor in the rebellions that culminated in French royal intervention and King John&#x27;s consequent loss of the continental empire that had been assiduously constructed by his father King Henry II.
**Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany – Titular Hereditary Countess of Richmond. She was Constance&#x27;s daughter and Arthur&#x27;s sister. She was considered by some to have succeeded to the Earldom as the 5th Countess of Richmond. Imprisoned initially by King John of England (&quot;Jean sans Terres&quot;) and then his successor King Henry III. John gave her no lands of the earldom. She died 1241 after a lifetime of imprisonment since 1202. During her life imprisonment, John I had offered the Earldom to Peter Mauclerc, who declined the offer but was still recognized as Earl of Richmond in 1218 under William Marshal regent of Henry III, by which time Eleanor ceased to be styled as countess. Meanwhile, Henry III had a law passed in England that prevented Eleanor from any English inheritances to the crown. She never regained Richmond even after Peter later forfeited it in 1235.
*Alix, Duchess of Brittany (1203–1221) – daughter of Constance and Guy of Thouars. She succeeded her half-brother. Although her half-sister Eleanor used the title Countess of Richmond in the same time, Alix made charters about this estate and used the title from 1203 to her death in 1221.
* Peter I, Duke of Brittany (1213–1218) – Earl of Richmond &quot;jure uxoris&quot;. Alix was Countess of Richmond from 1203 to 1221.

===Earls of Richmond, 2nd Creation (1218)===
*Peter I of Brittany (1190–1250), forfeit 1235 – the husband of Alix of Thouars, the heiress of Constance of Brittany; Peter also ruled as Duke of Brittany &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, and later as regent of Brittany. He was a member of the House of Dreux and was known at various times in his life as &quot;Pierre de Dreux&quot;, &quot;Pierre Mauclerc&quot; and &quot;Pierre de Braine&quot;. King John offered him the earldom in his own right, but Peter declined because of his links to the King of France. However, in 1218 he was still recognized as Earl of Richmond by William Marshal regent of John I&#x27;s son, Henry III. He forfeited any rights to the Earldom during the reign of Henry III.

===Earls of Richmond, 3rd Creation (1241)===
*Peter II, Count of Savoy (1203–1268) – in 1240 was granted the Honour of Richmond by Henry III, but he never assumed the title of Earl; under his will, he left the Honour of Richmond to his niece the queen, Eleanor of Provence, who transferred it to the crown.

===Earls of Richmond, 2nd Creation (restored 1268)===
*John I, Duke of Brittany (1217–1286), restored to the Earldom by Henry III; resigned peerage in 1268 to his son, John de Dreux, the future Duke John II, upon John&#x27;s marriage to Beatrice, Henry III&#x27;s daughter 
*John of Dreux, Earl of Richmond (1239–1305) – eventually, Duke John II of Brittany; married to Henry III&#x27;s daughter Beatrice; this marriage was meant to bring the Earl of Richmond under the &quot;shield of England&quot; during the reign of Henry III when tensions rose with France; John de Dreux would become Duke of Brittany after Beatrice&#x27;s death. Beatrice, therefore, never became Duchess of Brittany.
*John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond (1266–1334) – received his title from his father John II, Duke of Brittany in 1306 and entered into Edward I&#x27;s service; lost his lands in 1325 for a time when he allied himself with Queen Isabella to force the abdication of her husband Edward II in favour of her son Edward III; his lands were restored by Edward III. 
*John III, Duke of Brittany (1286–1341) – received this title in 1334 upon John of Brittany&#x27;s death after he had inherited the Duchy of Brittany in 1312 upon the death of Arthur II, Duke of Brittany; he was John of Brittany&#x27;s nephew and the eldest son of Arthur II and a grandson of John II.

===Earls of Richmond, 4th Creation (1341)===
*Robert of Artois (1287–1342), received the earldom as a reward for service and loyalty to Edward III of England during the first four years of the Hundred Years War. His claims was at the expense of John of Montfort, the pro-English claimant to the duchy of Brittany. John was compensated with the Honour of Richmond, the first time the title was separated from the land it represented. Robert only held the title for a year before dying in support of Montfort near Vannes during the Breton War of Succession.

===Earls of Richmond, 5th Creation (1342)===
*John of Gaunt, 1st Earl of Richmond (1340–1399), a son of Edward III; surrendered earldom 1372 to Edward III; other estates merged into the crown at his death under Richard II

===Earls of Richmond, 2nd Creation (restored 1372)===
From 1341, the title and honour were separated permanently. Members of the Montfort family of Brittany regained the honour in 1372, lost and regained it in 1381, lost it again in 1384, regained it briefly in 1420, but lost it permanently in 1425 when Arthur, second son of John IV of Brittany, joined the French side and became constable of France in the final phase of the Hundred Years War. The family continued to use the title until the merger of the line into the French royal family in 1547.
*John IV, Duke of Brittany (1372–1399), eldest son of John of Montfort
*Arthur, Earl of Richmond (1393–1425), second son of John IV

&quot;Titular Montfort earls&quot;:
* &quot;Arthur, Earl of Richmond&quot; (1425–1458), later Arthur III, Duke of Brittany
* &quot;Francis II, Duke of Brittany&quot; (1458–1488), nephew of Arthur III
* &quot;Anne, Duchess of Brittany&quot; (1488–1514), daughter of Francis II
* &quot;Claude, Duchess of Brittany&quot; (1514–1524), daughter of Anne
* &quot;Francis III, Duke of Brittany&quot; (1524–1536), eldest son of Claude
* &quot;Henry, Duke of Brittany&quot; (1536–1547), second son of Claude, became Henry II of France in 1547

===Earls of Richmond, 6th Creation (1414)===
*John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford (1389–1435) – created earl by his brother Henry V in 1414. John died without legitimate issue in 1435, and his title and honours as Earl of Richmond reverted to the crown during the reign of Henry VI.

===Earls of Richmond, 7th Creation (1452)===
*Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond (1430–1456) – created earl by Henry VI in 1452.
*Henry Tudor, 2nd Earl of Richmond (1456–1509) – posthumous son of Edmund Tudor; the title was deemed forfeit in 1461 by the Yorkists, but claimed by Henry nonetheless; George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, was then given the title, 1st Earl of Richmond, by King Edward IV, the title passed on to Richard Plantagenet, Duke of Gloucester (Richard III) after Clarence&#x27;s execution; despite the Yorkists, Henry was recognised as indisputable heir by Francis II, Duke of Brittany, who surrendered his rights to him and aided his side in the Battle of Bosworth Field, after which Henry became King Henry VII of England. The Honour of Richmond became a personal fief of the Tudor dynasty. The title was merged into the crown.

<text>The Intelligence Bureau (IB) (Hindi: आसूचना ब्यूरो; IAST: āsūcanā byūro) is India&#x27;s internal security and counterintelligence agency under the Ministry of Home Affairs. It was founded in 1887 as the Central Special Branch. The IB is often regarded as the oldest extant intelligence organisation in the world.

Until 1968, it handled both domestic and foreign intelligence after which the Research and Analysis Wing was formed specifically for foreign intelligence; following that, the IB was primarily assigned the role of domestic intelligence and internal security. Tapan Deka is the current director of the IB, since June 2022.

==History==
The Intelligence Bureau traces its origin to the Central Special Branch, established on 23 December 1887 by the British government in India to gather intelligence on political unrest, particularly after the formation of the Indian National Congress in 1885. Its creation followed Secret Dispatch No. 11, dated 25 March 1887, in which R. A. Cross, the Secretary of State for India, sanctioned the proposal by Marquess of Dufferin, the Viceroy of India, to create a system for the &quot;collection of secret and political intelligence in India&quot;.

Dufferin proposed utilizing the police forces in British India and political officers in princely states for the &quot;collection of intelligence on political, social and religious movements&quot;. He recommended the establishment of &quot;special agencies&quot; at both central and provincial headquarters, assigning local governments the responsibility of intelligence collection and obliging them to report relevant findings to the central government. The Provincial Special Branches, under local government control, were tasked with sharing intelligence with the Central Special Branch.

Dufferin modelled the agency after the Third Section of Imperial Russia. To reduce expenses, the agency shared the manpower and facilities of the existing Thuggee and Dacoity Department, headquartered at Shimla. The General Superintendent of the Department was entrusted with the supervision of the Central Special Branch. His proposed annual budget was ₹46,800. Donald McCracken, a police officer from the Punjab cadre, was appointed as its first head. McCracken was the assistant to the General Superintendent, Colonel P. D. Henderson. The Provincial Special Branches were attached to the offices of either the Inspector General of Police or the chief secretary of the respective provinces.

In 1904, based on the recommendations of the Indian Police Commission (1902 – 1903) chaired by Andrew Fraser, the Central Criminal Intelligence Department—also known as the Department of Criminal Intelligence (DCI)—was established. This reorganization led to the abolition of the Thuggee and Dacoity Department and the merger of the Central Special Branch into the DCI. Additionally, Criminal Investigation Departments (CID) were created in the provinces. Initially, Provincial Special Branches were incorporated into the CIDs, headed by a Deputy Inspector General (DIG), but they were later separated as their functions evolved.

Section 40(2) of the Government of India Act 1919 stated that &quot;the Intelligence Bureau should keep the Government posted with matters relating to the security of the Indian Empire.&quot; Reflecting this directive, the DCI was renamed the Intelligence Bureau in 1920, a year before the Act formally came into force in 1921. In the 1920s, the IB&#x27;s role was reduced to primarily relaying intelligence to the Indian Political Intelligence (IPI) office in London, which was responsible for analyzing intelligence, and acted as a liaison between the IPI and the Government of India. Following the implementation of provincial autonomy under the Government of India Act 1935, the IB began assigning officers designated as Central Intelligence Officers to the provinces starting in 1937.

The IB, initially also referred to as the Delhi Intelligence Bureau (DIB), was placed under the Home Department and reported directly to the Governor-General of India. After India gained independence in 1947, the IB came under the Ministry of Home Affairs, with T. G. Sanjeevi Pillai becoming its first Indian director. Until 1968, the IB was responsible for both internal and external intelligence. However, shortcomings in its external intelligence, particularly in foreseeing Chinese movements before the Indo-China War of 1962 led to the creation of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW) in 1968, dedicated to external intelligence.

==Organisation==
The IB is a constitutional body under the Schedule VII of the Constitution of India. The Union List within Schedule VII includes &quot;Central Bureau of Intelligence&quot;. IB is also listed in the Schedule of the Intelligence Organisations (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1985, which recognizes organisations &quot;established by the central government for purposes of intelligence or counter-intelligence&quot;. The IB functions under the Ministry of Home Affairs and is headed by a Director of the Intelligence Bureau. According to the Government of India, IB is a civilian organization without police powers.

Though IB operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), in practice, the director of the IB is a member of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) and the Steering Committee. The director has the authority to brief the Prime Minister when necessary. The organization operates at both state and national levels. Most of the intelligence collection is handled by Group C officers, including Security Assistants and Junior Intelligence Officers and Group B officers, such as Assistant Central Intelligence Officers. Higher-level coordination and management are carried out by Group A gazetted officers, such as Deputy Central Intelligence Officers, Assistant Director, Deputy Director, Joint Director, Additional Director, Special Director and the Director. At the state level, IB officers are part of the State Special Bureau and report to a Central Intelligence Officer, who acts as the intelligence advisor to the Governor. The IB maintains field units and headquarters, usually under the control of Joint or Deputy Directors.

==Responsibilities==
Shrouded in secrecy, the IB is used to garner intelligence from within India and also execute counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism tasks. The Bureau comprises employees from law enforcement agencies, mostly from the Indian Police Service (IPS) or the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) and the military. However, the Director of Intelligence Bureau (DIB) has always been an IPS officer. In addition to domestic intelligence responsibilities, the IB is particularly tasked with intelligence collection in border areas, following the 1951 recommendations of the Himmat Singh Ji Committee (also known as the North and North-East Border Committee), a task entrusted to the military intelligence organisations before independence in 1947. 

All spheres of human activity within India and in the neighbourhood are allocated to the charter of duties of the Intelligence Bureau. The IB was also tasked with other external intelligence responsibilities from 1951 until 1968 when the Research and Analysis Wing was formed.

==Activities and operations==

Understanding of the shadowy workings of the IB is largely speculative. Many times even members&#x27; family members are unaware of their whereabouts. One known task of the IB is to clear licences to amateur radio enthusiasts. The IB also passes intelligence between other Indian intelligence agencies and the police. The bureau also grants the necessary security clearances to Indian diplomats and judges before they take the oath. On rare occasions, IB officers interact with the media during a crisis. The IB is also rumoured to intercept and open around 6,000 letters daily. It also has an email spying system similar to the FBI&#x27;s Carnivore system. The bureau is authorised to conduct wiretapping without a warrant.

The IB was initially India&#x27;s internal and external intelligence agency. Due to lapses on the part of the Intelligence Bureau to predict the Sino-Indian War of 1962, and later on, intelligence failure in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, it was bifurcated in 1968 and entrusted with the task of internal intelligence only. The external intelligence branch was handed to the newly created the Research and Analysis Wing.

The IB operated a counterintelligence programme to prevent the CIA from gathering information about the preparations and activities related to the Indian nuclear weapons project, before the Pokhran-II nuclear tests.

The IB had mixed success in counterterrorism. It was reported in 2008 that the IB had been successful in busting terror modules. It alerted the police before the Hyderabad blasts and gave repeated warnings of a possible attack on Mumbai through the sea before the 2008 Mumbai attacks. On the whole, however, the IB came in for some sharp criticism by the media after the relentless wave of terror attacks in 2008. The government came close to sacking top intelligence officials soon after the 26/11 attacks, because of serious lapses that led to the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Heavy politics, under-funding and a shortage of field agents were the chief problems facing the agency. The overall strength of the agency is believed to be around 25,000, with 3500-odd field agents operating in the entire country. Of these, many were engaged in &quot;political intelligence&quot;.

Since 2014, the IB has undergone many reforms and changes. 
One of the biggest reforms was the cessation of internal political espionage.
The agency has also boosted its infrastructure and recruited more agents. It has been successful in stopping the earlier pattern of frequent terror attacks in India.
The agency has also been successful in counterintelligence.

==Media portrayal==

The Intelligence Bureau has been depicted in films such as &quot;Bad Aur Badnam&quot; (Hindi, 1984), &quot;Mukhbiir&quot; (Hindi, 2008), &quot;Vandae Maatharam&quot; (Tamil, 2010), &quot;Kahaani&quot; (Hindi, 2012), &quot;Jism 2&quot; (Hindi, 2012), &quot;Iru Mugan&quot; (Tamil, 2016), &quot;Spyder&quot; (Tamil, Telugu, 2017), &quot;India&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (Hindi, 2019) and IB71.

IB also featured in the Sony TV Series &quot;Yudh&quot;, starring Amitabh Bachchan.

<text>Thomas Z. Shepard (born June 26, 1936) is an American record producer who is best known for his recordings of Broadway musicals, including the works of Stephen Sondheim. Shepard is also a composer, conductor, music arranger and pianist.

He has won twelve Grammy Awards and produced the original cast recordings of many of the Sondheim musicals, including &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, &quot;Company&quot; and &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;, among others. He also produced the original cast recordings of &quot;1776&quot;, &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;42nd Street&quot;, among over a hundred others. He has produced hundreds of classical music and popular music recordings.

==Education and early career==
Shepard attended The Juilliard School&#x27;s preparatory division, training in piano and composition, leaving after his third year, in 1949. He then attended Oberlin College, again studying piano and, privately, composition, receiving his B.A., Music, in 1958. He then continued his studies in 1959 at the Yale Graduate School of Music.

Beginning in 1960, Shepard worked for fourteen years for Columbia Records, eventually becoming co-director of CBS Masterworks. He joined RCA Records in 1974, where he was Division Vice President of RCA Red Seal, responsible for recording, signing and marketing of the label, until 1986. He was then Vice President: Classical and Theatrical until 1989 for MCA Records in New York, where he created their classical and theatrical record line. Shepard then became an independent producer, wrote, narrated and produced &quot;The WQXR/MCA Classics Listener&#x27;s Guide&quot; (1988; music appreciation recordings) and has lectured on musical theatre and classical music.

==Producer and composer==
Shepard has produced numerous classical and Broadway cast albums, winning 12 Grammy Awards, including four with songs by Stephen Sondheim. In 1984, he received the NARAS Governors&#x27; Award for Lifetime Achievement, and in 1986, he won a Drama Desk Special Award &quot;for preserving musical theater heritage on record.&quot; Shepard received two Emmy Award nominations for songs he composed for the PBS television show &quot;Between the Lions&quot; (2007). He has also produced live concert events, most recently &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in 2007, and &quot;Camelot&quot; in 2008, with the New York Philharmonic, broadcast on PBS as part of the &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot; series. Shepard has arranged music and conducted for Anna Moffo, Richard Kiley, the Norman Luboff Choir and Richard Tucker, among others. He performed as a pianist at various concert venues, and his recording of classical piano pieces and improvisations, &quot;Love on a Stormy Weekend&quot;, was released by Planet Earth Recording Co. in 1998.

Shepard is the composer of five musicals and five operas, among other pieces. The operas include &quot;That Pig of a Molette&quot; (1988) and &quot;A Question of Faith&quot; (1990), both with libretti by Sheldon Harnick, which were presented as a double-bill under the title &quot;Love in Two Countries&quot; at St. Peter&#x27;s Church Theatre, in New York City, by Musical Theater Works in 1991; and a score for the lost music of &quot;Thespis&quot; (2008), which has been called &quot;a love letter to [Gilbert and Sullivan] and ... might be better than the original&quot;. In 1971, he composed the motion picture score for &quot;Such Good Friends&quot;, directed by Otto Preminger, and in 1974, he wrote a children&#x27;s cantata, &quot;In the Night Kitchen&quot;, with words by Maurice Sendak. He also composed the piano folio &quot;Folk a la Classique&quot; for Carl Fischer Music (2003; original compositions for children) and was the composer and lyricist for children&#x27;s educational material for the Carnegie Hall Explorers Division, &quot;The Children’s Symphony&quot; (2004, intended to teach the instruments of the orchestra to second-and third-grade schoolchildren) and for the PBS television show &quot;Between the Lions&quot; (2007).

<doc id="797696" wikidata="Q2157657" url="?curid=797696" title="Rhymers' Club">
<text>The Rhymers&#x27; Club was a group of London-based male poets, founded in 1890 by W. B. Yeats and Ernest Rhys. Originally not much more than a dining club, it produced anthologies of poetry in 1892 and 1894. They met at the London pub ‘Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese’ in Fleet Street and in the &#x27;Domino Room&#x27; of the &quot;Café Royal&quot;.

Those who took part also included Ernest Dowson, Lionel Johnson, Francis Thompson, Richard Le Gallienne, John Gray, John Davidson, Edwin J. Ellis, Victor Plarr, Selwyn Image, Lord Alfred Douglas, Arthur Cecil Hillier, John Todhunter, G.A. Greene, Arthur Symons, Ernest Radford, and Thomas William Rolleston. Oscar Wilde attended some meetings that were held in private homes. The group as a whole matched quite closely Yeats&#x27; retrospective idea of &#x27;the tragic generation&#x27;, destined for failure and in many cases early death.

Along with the social element of the Rhymers&#x27; Club, they published two volumes of verse. The first, entitled &quot;The Book of the Rhymers&#x27; Club&quot; was published by Elkin Mathews in 1892. &quot;The Second Book of the Rhymers&#x27; Club&quot; appeared two years later in 1894, published by the recently merged Elkin Mathews and John Lane. They had print runs of 450 and 650 respectively. Those of the group appearing in these two volumes were: T.W. Rolleston, John Todhunter, W. B. Yeats, Richard Le Gallienne, Lionel Johnson, Arthur Cecil Hillier, Ernest Dowson, Victor Plarr, Ernest Radford, Arthur Symons, G.A. Greene, Edwin J. Ellis, and Ernest Rhys.

This seemingly dualistic existence of the club (i.e. on one hand meeting informally at the Cheshire Cheese or in private homes; on the other hand producing anthologies of verse) makes determining the club&#x27;s members rather tricky at times. There are certain poets who were known to have attended meetings but never had their verse appear in either of the books. Also, certain poets feature in one book without featuring in the other. What is certain is that all the members were men.

By the time Arthur Ransome wrote his &quot;Bohemia in London&quot; in 1907, the group had already passed into legend: &quot;... the Rhymer&#x27;s Club used to meet, to drink from tankards, smoke clay pipes, and recite their own poetry&quot;. In fact, Ransome&#x27;s research was less than thorough; the group continued to meet in some form until about 1904.

<text>In popular culture, the friend zone (or friendzone) is a relational concept, describing a situation in which one person in a mutual friendship wishes to enter into a romantic or sexual relationship with the other person, while the other does not. The person whose romantic advances were rejected is then said to have &quot;entered&quot; (or to have been &quot;put in&quot;) the friend zone, with the sense that they are stuck there. The friendzone has a strong presence on the Internet; for example, on Facebook, dating sites, and other social media platforms. However, over time the term has expanded into middle schools, high schools, and colleges where young people are discovering their identities when it comes to dating and romance.

The concept of the friend zone has been criticized by some as misogynistic, because of a belief that the concept implies an expectation that women should be romantically involved with men in whom they have no interest, simply because the men were nice to them, though the term refers to all forms of unrequited affection, not necessarily a man liking a woman. It is also closely associated with so-called &quot;nice guy syndrome&quot;.

The term was originally popularized in the American sitcom television series &quot;Friends&quot; (1994). In the seventh episode of the first season, &quot;The One with the Blackout&quot;, Ross Geller is lovesick for Rachel Green, but Joey Tribbiani informs him that, when two people meet, there is a short period in which there is potential for a romantic relationship that Ross has gone beyond. After this time, if they continue to see each other, they are in the &quot;friend zone&quot; and so a romantic relationship is effectively impossible, even if one of the parties wants to be the other&#x27;s lover.

==Terminology==
The term friendzone can be verbified, as in the sentence &quot;So, she&#x27;s friend-zoned you.&quot; It is described as &quot;[a] situation in which a friendship exists between two people, one of whom has an unreciprocated romantic or sexual interest in the other.&quot; Although the term is apparently gender-neutral, the friend zone is often used to describe a situation in a male-female relationship in which the male is in the friend zone and the female is the object of his unrequited desire, or vice versa, where the female is being friend-zoned by the male, although less common. The person who does the friend-zoning is referred to as the &quot;friend-zoner&quot;, whereas the person who gets friend-zoned is called the &quot;friend-zonee&quot;.

The term &quot;friend zone&quot; is sometimes used in pick up artist (PUA) literature, where it forms part of PUA theories about female sexual attraction to males.

== Research ==
Binghamton University did a study on undergraduates from a midsize university in the northeastern United States. There were 562 participants with 305 identified as female and 257 as male. Of the 562 participants, 427 were exclusively heterosexual while 113 were not exclusively heterosexual. The participants were asked &quot;Have you ever friend-zoned someone else?&quot; and &quot;Have you ever been friend-zoned?&quot; The study found that 65.7% of exclusively heterosexual males have friend-zoned someone while 92.6% of exclusively heterosexual females have friend-zoned someone. The study also found that 75.2% of exclusively heterosexual males have been friend-zoned before while only 41.2% of exclusively heterosexual females have been friend-zoned before.

== Background ==
Writer Jeremy Nicholson in &quot;Psychology Today&quot; suggested that a romantic pursuer, in order to avoid being rejected upfront, uses a ploy of acting friendly as a &quot;back door&quot; way into a hoped-for relationship. When this method does not work, the pursuer consequently is placed in the &quot;friend zone&quot;. 

According to some psychologists, the man in a cross-gender friendship is more likely to be attracted to his woman friend than she is to him, and he is more likely to overestimate her interest in a romantic or sexual relationship.

==Criticism of the term==
Feminist writers such as Rivu Dasgupta and Amanda Marcotte have argued that the friend zone concept is misogynistic. Dasgupta sees the friend zone as being rooted in male narcissism. The &quot;nice guy&quot; concept has been criticized as a gender trope with an underlying message that kind acts demand a sexual or romantic reward. Dasgupta and Marcotte say that the concept implies that if a woman and a man have a platonic friendship and the man becomes romantically attracted to the woman, then the woman has an obligation to return his affection. A woman who does not return her &quot;nice guy&quot; male friend&#x27;s affection is viewed negatively or seen to be at fault. Ryan Milner of the College of Charleston argued that the &quot;friend zone&quot; concept is a nuanced and harmful aspect of patriarchal authority and male domination.

&quot;TheGuardian.com&quot; contributor Ally Fogg argues that while the friend zone does not exist in a literal sense, men who use the term &quot;friend zone&quot; are not necessarily misogynists who feel entitled to sex. He states the term&#x27;s usage reflects a genuine emotional experience for straight men with low self-esteem and self-confidence. He places blame on ingrained gender roles. Being rejected by a potential partner does not mean a person has been friend-zoned; it means that potential partner does not want to pursue a romantic relationship.

==In popular culture==
The term was popularized by a 1994 episode of the American sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; entitled &quot;The One with the Blackout&quot;, where the character Ross Geller, who was lovesick for Rachel Green, was described by character Joey Tribbiani as being the &quot;mayor of the friend zone&quot;.

The 2005 romantic comedy film &quot;Just Friends&quot; main plot device is that the protagonist Chris Brander (played by Ryan Reynolds) is &quot;friend-zoned&quot; by his best friend (and secret love interest since school) Jamie Palamino (played by Amy Smart).

Chris Rock mentions the term in his 1996 &quot;Bring the Pain&quot; skit. He says that women have male friends but these men are friends with women they &quot;haven&#x27;t fucked yet&quot;. Then claims that men who have platonic friends is because of an accident and ending up in the friend zone is because of a &quot;wrong turn somewhere&quot;.

MTV aired a reality show entitled &quot;FriendZone&quot; from 2011 to 2013. Each episode is based around &quot;crushers&quot; who are friends with the &quot;crushees&quot; but want to begin relationships with them.

The Cartoon Network series &quot;Regular Show&quot; brings up and shows the friend zone on a regular basis, as one of the show&#x27;s main characters, Mordecai, and his friend Margaret experience shifts in their relationship.

<text>Ingushetia or Ingushetiya, officially the Republic of Ingushetia, is a republic of Russia located in the North Caucasus of Eastern Europe. The republic is part of the North Caucasian Federal District, and shares land borders with the country of Georgia to its south; and borders the Russian republics of North Ossetia–Alania to its west and north and Chechnya to its east and northeast.

Its capital is the town of Magas, while the largest city is Nazran. At 3,600 square km in terms of area, the republic is the smallest of Russia&#x27;s non-city federal subjects. It was established on 4 June 1992, after the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was split in two. The republic is home to the indigenous Ingush, a people of Nakh ancestry. As of the 2021 Census, its population was estimated to be 527,220.

Largely due to the insurgency in the North Caucasus, Ingushetia remains one of the poorest and most unstable regions of Russia. Although the violence has died down in recent years, the insurgency in neighboring Chechnya had occasionally spilled into Ingushetia. According to Human Rights Watch in 2008, the republic has been destabilized by corruption, a number of high-profile crimes (including kidnapping and murder of civilians by government security forces), anti-government protests, attacks on soldiers and officers, Russian military excesses and a deteriorating human rights situation. In spite of this, Ingushetia has the highest life expectancy in all of Russia.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Ingushetia&quot; () derives from the Russian name of the Ingush, which in turn is derived from the ancient Ingush village Angusht, and from the Georgian suffix -&quot;éti&quot;. The name in Ingush is &quot;Ghalghaaichie&quot; (, /ʁalʁaitʃe/).

In the 1920–1930s there was not yet a unifying name for the Ingush Autonomous Oblast. Although the &quot;oblast&quot; was officially called &quot;Ingushetia&quot;, some scientists like and insisted that its correct name is &quot;Ingushiya&quot; ().

=== In Caucasian War and as part of Terek Cossacks Okrug ===

In the 18th century the Ingush were mostly pagan and Christian, with a Muslim minority. Beginning in 1588 some Chechen societies joined Russia (; ).
Russian historians claim that the Ingush volunteered to become a part of Russia. This assertion is mostly based on the document signed on 13 June 1810 by General-Major Delpotso and representatives of two Ingush clans; most other clans resisted the Russian conquest. In 1811, at the Tsar&#x27;s request, Moritz von Engelhardt, a Russian envoy of German origin, visited the mountainous region of Ingushetia and tried to induce the Ingush people to join Russia by promising many benefits offered by the Tsar. The representative of the Ingush people rejected the proposal with the reply: &quot;Above my hat I see only sky&quot;. This encounter was later used by Goethe in his 1815 poem, &quot;Freisinn&quot; (&#x27;free spirit&#x27;).

On 29 June 1832, the Russian Baron Rozen reported in letter No.42 to count Chernishev that &quot;on the 23rd of this month I exterminated eight Ghalghaj (Ingush) villages. On the 24th I exterminated nine more villages near Targim.&quot; By 12 November 1836 (letter no.560), he claimed that highlanders of Dzheirkah, Kist, and Ghalghaj had been at least temporarily subdued. In 1829 Imam Shamil began a rebellion against Russia. He conquered Dagestan, Chechnya, and then attacked Ingushetia hoping to convert the Ingush people to Islam, thus gaining strategic allies. However, the Ingush defeated Imam Shamil&#x27;s forces. They successfully repulsed two more attempts in 1858. Nevertheless, locked in warfare with two strong opponents and their allies, Ingush forces were eventually devastated. According to the Russian officer Fedor Tornau, who fought with the aid of Ossetian allies against the Ingush, the Ingush had no more than six hundred warriors. However, the Russian conquest in Ingushetia was extremely difficult and the Russian forces began to rely more upon methods of colonization: extermination of the local population and resettlement of the area with Cossack and Ossetian loyalists.

The colonization of Ingush land by Russians and Ossetians began in the mid-19th century. The Russian General Evdokimov and Ossetian colonel Kundukhov in &#x27;Opis no. 436&#x27; &quot;gladly reported&quot; that &quot;the result of colonization of Ingush land was successful&quot;.

Renamed Ingush villages and towns:
* Ghazhien-Yurt was renamed Stanitsa Assinovskaya in 1847.
* Ebarg-Yurt was renamed Stanitsa Troitskaya in 1847.
* Dibir-Ghala (town) was renamed Stanitsa Sleptsovskaya in 1847.
* Magomet-Khite was renamed Stanitsa Voznesenskaya in 1847.
* Akhi-Yurt was renamed Stanitsa Sunzhenskaya in 1859.
* Ongusht was renamed Stanitsa Tarskaya in 1859.
* Ildir-Ghala (town) was renamed Stanitsa Karabulakskaya in 1859.
* Alkhaste was renamed Stanitsa Feldmarshalskaya in 1860.
* Tauzen-Yurt was renamed Stanitsa Vorontsov-Dashkov in 1861.
* Sholkhi was renamed Khutor Tarski in 1867.
Following Imam Shamil&#x27;s repeated losses by the end of the Caucasian War, the Russians and Chechens unified their forces. Former Chechen rebels and their men joined the Russian ranks. On 3 November 1858, General Evdokimov ordered (order N1896) a former rebel commander, naib Saib-Dulla Gekhinski (Saadulla Ospanov) of Chechnya to attack and destroy Ingush settlements near the Assa and Fortanga rivers: Dattikh, Meredzhi, Aseri, Shagot-Koch and others. After their defeats in combat, the remaining Ingush clans resorted mostly to underground resistance.

The Russians built the fortress Vladikavkaz (&quot;ruler of the Caucasus&quot;) on the place of Ingush village of Zaur. Russian General Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov wrote in a letter to the Tsar of Russia, &quot;It would be a grave mistake for Russia to alienate such a militaristic nation as the Ingush.&quot; He suggested the separation of the Ingush and Chechens in order for Russia to win the war in the Caucasus. In another letter from General Ermolov to Lanski (dated 12 January 1827) on the impossibility of forceful Christianization of the Ingush, Yermolov wrote: &quot;This nation, the most courageous and militaristic among all the highlanders, cannot be allowed to be alienated...&quot;

The last organized rebellion (the so-called &quot;Nazran insurrection&quot;) in Ingushetia occurred in 1858 when 5,000 Ingush launched an attack against Russian forces, but lost to the latter&#x27;s superior number. The rebellion signaled the end of the First Russo-Caucasian War. In the same year, the Tsar encouraged the emigration of Ingush and Chechens to Turkey and the Middle East by claiming that &quot;Muslims need to live under Muslim rulers&quot;. His apparent motivation was to depopulate the area for the settlement of Ossetians and Cossacks. Some Ingush became exiled to deserted territories in the Middle East where many of them died. The remainder were  Culturally assimilated by Russification. It was estimated that eighty per cent of the Ingush had left Ingushetia for the Middle East by 1865.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviets promised the Ingush that the villages and towns annexed during the colonization would be returned to the Ingush. Ingushetia became a major battleground between the old archenemies: general Denikin, and Ingush resistance fighters. In his memoirs, general Denikin wrote 

===As part of the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus===
On 21 December 1917 Ingushetia, Chechnya, and Dagestan declared independence from Russia and formed a single state called the &quot;United Mountain Dwellers of the North Caucasus&quot; (also known as Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus), which was recognized by Central Powers (Germany, Austro-Hungary and Turkey), Georgia, and Azerbaijan (which declared their independence from Russia in 1918) as an independent state. For example, Anna Zelkina writes that in May 1918 the first country to recognize independence was Turkey:

Later Germany and others followed the recognition. According to P. Kosok:
According to the British War Office, Germans tried to establish the military base in Ingushetia:

The capital of the new state was moved to Temir-Khan-Shura (Dagestan). The first prime minister of the state was elected Tapa Chermoyev, a Chechen prominent statesman; the second prime minister was Ingush statesman Vassan-Girey Dzhabagiev who also was the author of the Constitution of the land in 1917. In 1920 he was reelected for a third term. In 1921 Russians attacked and occupied the country and forcefully merged it with the Soviet state. The Caucasian war for independence continued and the government went into exile.

===As part of Chechen-Ingush ASSR===
Cossack General Andrei Shkuro in his book writes:

The Soviets confiscated the remaining Ingush properties by collectivization and dekulakization and unified Chechnya and Ingushetia into Chechen-Ingush ASSR.

During World War II Ingush youth were drafted into the Red Army. In August 1942 Nazi German forces captured half of the North Caucasus within thirty-three days moving from Rostov-On-Don to Mozdok 560 km or almost 17 km per day (see Battle of the Caucasus). From Mozdok to Malgobek same thirty three days, 20 km the German forces moved roughly 600 meters per day and were stopped only at Ordzhonikidze (modern-day Vladikavkaz) and Malgobek which were mostly populated by Ingush before the genocide of 23 February 1944. The fighting for the Malgobek was so intense that the small town was captured and recaptured four times until the Germans finally retreated.

According to the Soviet military newspaper Red Star, after receiving the news about German brutality toward civilians in Kabardino-Balkaria, Ingush people declared Jihad(Gazavat) against Germans. Stalin planned the expansion of the USSR in the south through Turkey. Muslim Chechens and Ingush could become a threat to the expansion. In February 1944 near the end of World War II, NKVD units flooded the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. The maneuvers were disguised as military exercises of the southern district.

===Genocide of 1944===

During World War II, in 1942 German forces entered the North Caucasus. For three weeks, the Germans captured over half of the North Caucasus. They were only stopped at two cities in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR: Malgobek and Ordzhonikidze (a.k.a. &#x27;Vladikavkaz&#x27;) by the heroic resistance of the native population.

On 23 February 1944, Ingush and Chechens were falsely accused of collaborating with the Nazis, and the entire Ingush and Chechen populations were deported to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Siberia in Operation Lentil, on the orders of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, while the majority of their men were fighting on the front. The initial phase of the deportation was carried out on American-supplied Studebaker trucks specifically modified with three submachine gun-nest compartments above the deported to prevent escapes. American historian Norman Naimark writes: 
The deportees were gathered at railroad stations and during the second phase transferred to the cattle railroad carts. Up to 30% of the population perished during the journey or in the first year of the exile. The Prague Watchdog claims that &quot;in the early years of their exile about half of the Chechens and Ingush died from hunger, cold and disease&quot;. The deportation was classified by the European Parliament in 2004 as genocide. After the deportation Ingush resistance against the Soviets began again. Those who escaped the deportation, including shepherds who were high in the mountains during the deportations, formed rebel groups which constantly attacked Russian forces in Ingushetia. Major rebel groups were led by Akhmed Khuchbarov, the Tsitskiev brothers, and an Ingush female sniper, Laisat Baisarova. The last one of the male Ingush rebels was killed in 1977 by the KGB officers, while Baisarova was never captured or killed. American professor Johanna Nichols, who specializes in Chechen and Ingush philology, provided the theory behind the deportation:
===After return from Central Asia===
After 13 years of exile, the Ingush were allowed to return to Chechen-Ingushetia (but not to Ordzhonikidze a.k.a. &quot;Vladikavkaz&quot; or the Prigorodny District). Most of Ingushetia&#x27;s territory had been settled by Ossetians and part of the region had been transferred to North Ossetia. The returning Ingush faced considerable animosity from the Ossetians. The Ingush were forced to buy their homes back from the Ossetians and Russians. These hardships and injustices led to a peaceful Ingush protest in Grozny on 16 January 1973, which was crushed by Soviet troops In 1989, the Ingush were officially rehabilitated along with other peoples that had been subjected to repressions.

===Post-Soviet period===
In 1991, when the Chechens declared independence from the Soviet Union to form the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, the Ingush chose to secede from the Chechen-Ingush Republic. This was confirmed with the referendum and in 1992 the Ingush joined the newly created Russian Federation to try to resolve the conflict with Ossetia peacefully, also in the hope that the Russians would return their land as a token of their loyalty.

===Ethnic cleansing of 1992===
However, ethnic tensions in North Ossetia which were orchestrated by Ossetian nationalists (per Helsinki Human Right Watch), led to an outbreak of violence in the Ossetian–Ingush conflict in October–November 1992, when another ethnic cleansing of the Ingush population started.

Over 60,000 Ingush civilians were forced from their homes in the Prigorodny District of North Ossetia. As a result of the conflict, pro-Russian general Ruslan Aushev, a decorated war hero from the War in Afghanistan, was appointed by the Russian government as the first president of Ingushetia to stop the spread of the conflict. Partial stability returned under his rule.

===First and Second Chechen Wars===

In 1994, when the First Chechen War started, the number of refugees in Ingushetia from both conflicts doubled. According to the UN, for every citizen of Ingushetia, one refugee arrived from Ossetia or Chechnya. This influx was very problematic for the economy, which collapsed after Aushev&#x27;s success. The second Russo-Chechen war which started in 1999 brought more refugees (at some point there was one refugee for every Ingush citizen: 240,000 from Chechnya plus 60,000 from North Ossetia at the peak in 2000) and misery to Ingushetia. In 2001, Aushev was forced to leave his presidency and was succeeded by Murat Zyazikov, a former KGB general. The situation worsened under his rule. Many young Ingush men were abducted by Russian and Ossetian death squads. according to Human rights watchdogs Memorial and Mashr.

The number of rebel attacks in Ingushetia rose, especially after the number of Russian security forces was tripled. For example, according to a Russian news agency a murder of an ethnic-Russian school teacher in Ingushetia was committed by two ethnic-Russian and ethnic-Ossetian soldiers; Issa Merzhoev the Ingush Police detective who solved the crime was shot at and killed by &quot;unknown&quot; assailants shortly after he had identified the murderer.
At least four people were injured when a vehicle exploded on 24 March 2008. An upsurge in violence in these months targeted local police officers and security forces. In January 2008, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation launched a &quot;counter-terrorism&quot; operation in Ingushetia after receiving information that insurgents had been preparing a series of attacks.

Early in August 2008, the war between Georgia and South Ossetia broke out, in which the Russian Federation subsequently became involved. After the outbreak of the war, there were virtually no more attacks or abductions of Ingush civilians by &quot;unknown&quot; forces. Most of the Russian forces were transferred to North and South Ossetia 31 August 2008 Magomed Yevloyev, the head of Ingush opposition and the owner of the website ingushetiya.ru, was killed by Russian security forces Shortly before the unrecognised opposition group People&#x27;s Parliament of Ingushetia Mekhk-Kkhel called for the recognition of the Russian semi-autonomous republic&#x27;s independence, opposition activist Magomed Khazbiyev proclaimed, &quot;We must ask Europe or America to separate us from Russia.&quot;

On 18 October 2008, a Russian military convoy came under grenade attack and machine gun fire near Nazran. Official Russian reports of the ambush, which has been blamed on local Muslim separatists, said two soldiers were killed and at least seven injured. Reports from Ingush opposition sources suggested as many as forty to fifty Russian soldiers were killed.

On 30 October 2008, Zyazikov was dismissed from his office (he himself claimed he resigned voluntarily). On the next day, Yunus-Bek Yevkurov was nominated by Dmitry Medvedev and approved as President by the People&#x27;s Assembly of Ingushetia (later the title &quot;President&quot; was renamed &quot;Head&quot;). This move was endorsed by major Russian political parties and by the Ingush opposition. Under the current rule of Yevkurov, Ingushetia seems much calmer, showing some semblance of the Russian government. Attacks on policemen have fallen by 40% and abductions by 80%.

===Military history===
According to professor Johanna Nichols, in all the recorded history and reconstructable prehistory, the Ingush people have never undertaken battle except in defense. In the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC Pharnavaz, his son Saurmag the Iberian kings, and the relatives of Ingush people per Leonti Mroveli, received military assistance from Ingush people in defense of Iberia against the Kartli occupation.

During World War I, 500 cavalrymen from an Ingush regiment of the Wild Division attacked the German Iron Division. The Russian Emperor Nicholas II, assessing the performance of the Ingush and Chechen regiments during the Brusilov breakthrough on the Russian-German front in 1915 wrote in a telegram to the Governor-General of the Tersky region Fleisher:
In 1994–1996 Ingush volunteers fought alongside Chechens in the First Chechen War. Aside from a few incidents (including the killings of Ingush civilians by Russian soldiers), Ingushetia was largely kept out of the war by a determined policy of non-violence pursued by President Ruslan Aushev.

This changed after the beginning of the Second Chechen War, and especially since Murat Zyazikov became the second Russian appointed president of Ingushetia in 2002. The first major rebel attack of the conflict, in which a military convoy was destroyed occurred in May 2000 and caused the deaths of 19 soldiers. In the June 2004 Nazran raid, Chechen and Ingush rebels attacked government buildings and military bases across Ingushetia, resulting in the deaths of at least 90 Ingush people and an unknown number of Russian troops. Among them the Republic&#x27;s acting interior minister Abukar Kostoyev, his deputy Zyaudin Kotiyev. In response to a sharp escalation in attacks by insurgents since the summer of 2007, Moscow sent in an additional 25,000 MVD and FSB troops, tripling the number of special forces in Ingushetia.

==Politics==
Up until the dissolution of the Soviet state, Ingushetia was part of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR of the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic. In the late 1920s – early 1930s the Soviet officials were eager to enforce the Chechen-Ingush merger as an &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; process. The Soviet linguist Nikolay Yakovlev, who was a supporter of the merger, suggested that an inclusive name of &quot;Veinakh&quot; (&quot;our people&quot;) had to be used for both the Chechens and Ingush. According to his views, the rapid urbanization and rapprochement of the Chechens and Ingush within one and the same republic might encourage the formation of a common culture and language and the establishment of a unified &quot;Veinakh&quot; people.

During the late &#x27;80s, together with the separatist tendencies across the Soviet Union, the Second Congress of the Ingush People was held in Grozny on 9–10 September 1989. The gathering was directed at the top leadership of the Soviet Union, and included a request to &quot;restore the Ingush people&#x27;s autonomy within their historical borders, the Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic with a capital in the right-bank part of the city of Ordzhonikidze&quot;. The Ingush Republic was to be organized out of six traditional Ingush districts (including the contested Prigorodny District). The rise of the Russian Federation - and the 1991 Chechen Revolution - gave the Ingushetians the independence they vowed for and in 1992 the remainder of Checheno-Ingushstia became thus the Republic of Ingushtia. During the 1990s, Ingushetia was ruled by its elected president Ruslan Aushev, a former Soviet general and hero of the war in Afghanistan.

The head of government and the highest executive post in Ingushetia is the Head, elected by representatives of the Parliament of Ingushetia.

===Religion===

Ingushetia is one of the most religious regions of Russia.

===Education===
Ingush State University, the first institute of higher education in the history of Ingushetia, was founded in 1994 in Ordzhonikidzevskaya.

==Geography==

Ingushetia is situated on the northern slopes of the Caucasus. Its area is reported by various sources as either , , or ; the difference in reporting is mainly due to the inclusion or exclusion of parts of Sunzhensky Districts. The republic borders North Ossetia–Alania (SW/W/NW/N), the Chechnya (NE/E/SE), and the country of Georgia (Mtskheta-Mtianeti) (southwards). The highest point is the Gora Shan (4451 m).

==Economy==
There are some natural resources in Ingushetia: mineral water in Achaluki, oil and natural gas in Malgobek, forests in Dzheirakh, metals in Galashki. The local government is considering the development of tourism; however, this is problematic due to the uneasy situation in the republic itself and the proximity of some conflict zones. However, Ingushetia continues to remain as one of Russia&#x27;s poorest republics, largely due to the ongoing conflict, corruption and civil disorders. Unemployment is estimated to be around 53%, and growing poverty is a major issue.

<text>The title of Earl of Cambridge was created several times in the Peerage of England, and since 1362 the title has been closely associated with the Royal family (see also Duke of Cambridge, Marquess of Cambridge).

The first Earl of the fourth creation, the Marquess of Hamilton, was at the time sixth in line to the Crown of Scotland (after the Duke of Rothesay, later King Charles I, his sister Elizabeth and her children); his grandfather Lord Arran had been heir-presumptive to, and Regent for, Mary, Queen of Scots.

The Duke of Hamilton currently holds the title &quot;Earl of Arran and Cambridge&quot; in the Peerage of Scotland, which is not related to this earldom. From 1664, the title Duke of Cambridge superseded that of the Earl of Cambridge.

<doc id="797707" wikidata="Q461250" url="?curid=797707" title="Joseph Leidy">
<text>Joseph Mellick Leidy (September 9, 1823 – April 30, 1891) was an American paleontologist, parasitologist and anatomist.

Leidy was professor of anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania, later becoming a professor of natural history at Swarthmore College and the director of scientific and educational programs at the Wagner Free Institute of Science. His book &quot;Extinct Fauna of Dakota and Nebraska&quot; (1869) contained many species not previously described and many previously unknown on the North American continent. At the time, scientific investigation was largely the province of wealthy amateurs.

The Leidy Glacier in northwest Greenland was named by Robert Peary after him.

== Early life and family ==
Joseph Leidy was born on September 9, 1823, to an established Philadelphia family of Pennsylvania Germans. His father, Philip, was a hatter; his mother, Catharine, died during childbirth when he was young. His father then married his wife&#x27;s first cousin, Christiana Mellick. Leidy also had a brother, Thomas Leidy. With the support of his stepmother and after overcoming the opposition of his father, who wanted him to be a sign painter, Leidy studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with his medical degree in 1844.

He married Anna Harden, a woman who took a serious interest in his work and helped him with it on occasion. Their marriage was childless, and they eventually adopted an orphaned seven-year-old girl, Alwinia, daughter of the late Professor Franks of the University of Pennsylvania.

In 1848, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Paleontology==
Leidy named the holotype specimen of &quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot;, which was recovered from the marl pits of Haddonfield, New Jersey. It was notable for being the first nearly complete fossilized skeleton of a dinosaur ever recovered. The specimen was originally discovered by William Parker Foulke. Leidy concluded, contrary to the view prevailing at the time, that this dinosaur could adopt a bipedal posture. He also described the holotype specimens of &quot;Arctodus&quot; (&quot;A. pristinus&quot;), the dire wolf (&quot;Aenocyon dirus&quot;), and the American lion (&quot;Panthera atrox&quot;), among many others.

Noted American fossil collector and paleontologist E. D. Cope was a student of Leidy&#x27;s, but the enmity and ruthless competition that developed between him and rival paleontologist O. C. Marsh eventually drove Leidy out of western American vertebrate paleontology, a field that Leidy had helped to found. Marsh claimed Leidy contributed to the falling out of the two by showing Cope in the presence of Marsh that Cope had mistakenly placed the head of a fossil &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; on the tail, rather than on the neck, and then publishing a correction.

Leidy was an early American supporter of Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, and lobbied successfully for Darwin&#x27;s election to membership in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

In 1852, Leidy referred &quot;Bison antiquus&quot;, the North American fossil bison, to the genus &quot;Bison&quot;, the first to do so. Sometimes called the &quot;ancient bison&quot;, it was the most common large herbivore of the North American continent for over 10,000 years, and is a direct ancestor of the living American bison.

In 1855, Leidy published an influential memoir on fossil ground sloths of North America, the first comprehensive study of North American xenarthrans (the group including sloths, armadillos, glyptodonts, and anteaters). The work expanded understanding of the morphology of species known to the time, including details of the skull, and documented the broad geographic range once inhabited by the common species &quot;Megalonyx jeffersonii&quot;.

Leidy dominated vertebrate paleontology research in Florida during the latter half of the 19th century. He described and published the newly discovered species &quot;Smilodon floridanus&quot;.

=== The &quot;Soap Lady&quot; ===

In 1875, a woman&#x27;s body was exhumed from a Philadelphia cemetery; her body was encased in adipocere. Examining her, Leidy originally reported that she had died in the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic, but X-rays taken in 1987 showed that she had buttons on her body that weren&#x27;t produced until the 1830s. Similarly, the body didn&#x27;t have teeth, so Leidy thought the woman had died in middle or old age; however, a new set of X-rays in 2007 suggested that the woman had died in her late 20s.

== Wagner Free Institute ==
After William Wagner&#x27;s death in 1885, the Wagner Free Institute of Science formed a board of trustees to find a new director. They chose Leidy to lead the institute, and he became president of the institute&#x27;s faculty and curator of the museum. He held this position while remaining curator at the Academy of Natural Sciences and professor at Penn. Under Leidy&#x27;s direction, the Wagner became a more professional institution for research and education. He formed the institute&#x27;s professional journal &quot;Transactions of the Wagner Free Institute of Science&quot; and sponsored expeditions to collect specimens. One famed expedition to western Florida led by Angelo Heilprin led to the first discovery of a saber-toothed cat in North America. Leidy also led a large renovation to the building and dramatically reorganized the collection. The exhibition he designed opened in 1891, and displayed specimens based on taxonomy and systematics. Today, the Victorian cases and hand-labelled specimens remain almost unaltered since Leidy&#x27;s reorganization in the late 19th century.

==Other scientific fields==
Leidy was also a renowned parasitologist, and determined as early as 1846 that trichinosis was caused by a parasite in undercooked meat. He was also a pioneering protozoologist, publishing &quot;Fresh-water Rhizopods of North America&quot; in 1879 – a work that is still referenced today.

Leidy collected gems as well as fossils, and donated his important collection of the former to the Smithsonian before he died. At Swarthmore, he also taught a class on mineralogy and geology.

Leidy served as a surgeon to Satterlee Military Hospital in Philadelphia during the American Civil War.

==Forensic innovator==
In 1846, Leidy became the first person to use a microscope to solve a murder mystery. A man accused of killing a Philadelphia farmer had blood on his clothes and hatchet. The suspect claimed the blood was from chickens he had been slaughtering. Using his microscope, Leidy found no nuclei in these erythrocytes (human erythrocytes are anucleate). Moreover, he found that if he let chick erythrocytes remain outside the body for hours, they did not lose their nuclei. Thus, he concluded that the blood stains could not have been chicken blood. The suspect subsequently confessed.

==Death and legacy==
Leidy died in his home on April 30, 1891. After his death, his brain was donated to the American Anthropometric Society. In 1907, Edward Anthony Spitzka published a paper of his analysis of six brains at the American Anthropometric Society, including Leidy&#x27;s.

==Bibliography==
His bibliography includes 553 works.

<text>The Union Council of Ministers is the principal executive organ of the Government of India, which serves to aid and advise the President of India in execution of their functions. It is chaired by the Prime Minister of India and consists of the heads of each of the executive government ministries. Currently, the council is headed by and consists of 71 fellow members. The council is answerable to the Lok Sabha.

A smaller executive body called the Union Cabinet is the supreme decision-making body in India; it is a subset of the Union Council of Ministers who hold important portfolios and ministries of the government.

== Regulation ==
Pursuant to , the Council of Ministers is responsible collectively to the lower house of the Indian parliament, called the Lok Sabha (House of the People). The council of ministers upon losing the confidence of Lok Sabha shall resign to facilitate the formation of a new council.

A minister can take any decision without being considered by the council of ministers per . If needed, all union cabinet members shall submit in writing to the President to propose a proclamation of emergency by the president in accordance with .

According to the Constitution of India, the total number of ministers in the council of ministers must not exceed 15% of the total number of members of the Lok Sabha. Ministers must be members of parliament. Any minister who is not a member of either of the houses of the parliament for six consecutive months is automatically stripped off his or her ministerial post.

==Ranking==
There are five categories of the council of ministers as given below, in descending order of rank:
* Prime Minister: Leader of the Union Council of Ministers.

* Cabinet Minister: A member of the Union cabinet; leads a ministry. 
* Minister of State (Independent charge): Junior minister not reporting to a Cabinet Minister.
* Minister of State (MoS): Deputy Minister reporting to a Cabinet Minister, usually tasked with a specific responsibility in that ministry.

* Upon self resignation, or resignation or death of the prime minister
* Upon dismissal by the President for minister&#x27;s unconstitutional acts per

<doc id="797714" wikidata="Q6473564" url="?curid=797714" title="Music download">
<text>A music download is the digital transfer of music via the Internet into a device capable of decoding and playing it, such as a personal computer, portable media player, MP3 player or smartphone. This term encompasses both legal downloads and downloads of copyrighted material without permission or legal payment. Music downloads are typically encoded with modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) audio data compression, particularly the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format used by iTunes as well as the MP3 audio coding format.

According to a Nielsen report, downloadable music accounted for 55.9 percent of all music sales in the US in 2012. By the beginning of 2011, Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store alone made 1.1 billion of revenue in the first quarter of its fiscal year. According to the RIAA, music downloads peaked at 43% of industry revenue in the US in 2012, and has since fallen to 3% in 2022.

==Online music store==

Paid downloads are sometimes encoded with digital rights management that restricts copying the music or playing purchased songs on certain digital audio players. They are almost always compressed using a lossy codec (usually MPEG-1 Layer 3, Windows Media, or AAC), which reduces file size and bandwidth requirements. These music resources have been created as a response to expanding technology and needs of customers who wanted and/or needed easy, quick access to music. Their business models respond to the &quot;download revolution&quot; by making legal services attractive for users.

Even legal music downloads have faced a number of challenges from artists, record labels and the Recording Industry Association of America. In July 2007, the Universal Music Group decided not to renew their long-term contracts with iTunes. This decision was primarily based on the issue of pricing of songs, as Universal wanted to be able to charge more or less depending on the artist, a shift away from iTunes&#x27; standard—at the time—99 cents per song pricing. Many industry leaders feel that this is only the first of many show-downs between Apple Inc. and the various record labels.

According to research by the website TorrentFreak, 38 percent of Swedish artists support file share downloading and claim that it helps artists in early career stages. Artists, including Swedish rock group Lamont, have profited from file sharing.

==RIAA against illegal downloading==
The recording industry vs Napster: In the beginning of the 2000s Napster was sued due to mass infringement of music ownership copyrights by the record industry- a sue which issued a preliminary injunction for the service and was concluded by the closure of the Napster free music sharing between its users.

The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) oversees about 85 percent of published music production, distribution and manufacturing in the United States. Their stated goal is to support artists&#x27; creativity and help them not be cheated out of money by illegal downloading. The Recording Industry Association of America launched its first lawsuits on the 8th of September 2003, against individuals who illegally downloaded music files from the Kazaa FastTrack network.

Two years after it began, the campaign survived at least one major legal challenge. The RIAA said it filed 750 suits in February 2006 against individuals downloading music files without paying for them in hopes of putting an end to Internet music piracy. The RIAA hopes their campaign will force people to respect the copyrights of music labels and eventually minimize the number of illegal downloads.

The Official Charts Company began to incorporate downloads in the UK Singles Chart on 17 April 2005, at which time Radio 1 stopped broadcasting the separate download chart, although the chart is still compiled. Initially this was on condition that the song must have a physical media release at the same time; this rule was fully lifted on 1 January 2007, meaning all download sales are now eligible in the chart.

==Sales records==

===United Kingdom===
Music downloads have been measured by the Official Charts Company since 2004 and included in the main UK Singles Chart from 2005. Up to November 2022, the most-streamed song in the UK is &quot;Someone You Loved&quot; by Lewis Capaldi, with over 562 million streams.

===United States===
In November 2005, the record for the best-selling downloaded single in the United States was held by Gwen Stefani&#x27;s &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot;, which sold over one million downloads, making it the first song to achieve platinum download status. , the record for the best-selling downloaded single in the United States on the iTunes Store is held by The Black Eyed Peas&#x27;s &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot;, which has sold over 8 million downloads.

Soon after his death in 2009, Michael Jackson became the first artist to sell over one million songs downloaded via the Internet in one week. However, Adele marks the most downloads sold by a single song in a week, with &quot;Hello&quot; selling 1.12 million copies in November 2015.

Eminem&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Recovery&quot; (2010), became the first album to sell one million digital copies.

Beyoncé&#x27;s self-titled fifth studio album became the fastest-selling album within 24 hours in iTunes history after its release in December 2013. Within 24 hours of availability, the album sold 430,000 digital copies. Adele&#x27;s third studio album &quot;25&quot; became the fastest-selling album in a week in iTunes history after it was released on 20 November 2015. It sold 1.64 million digital copies in its first week (included preorders on the iTunes store since the release of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Hello&quot; in October 2015).

===Japan===

In 2006, the Recording Industry Association of Japan began issuing certifications for digitally released music in Japan, compiling data from the early 2000s onwards. The best-selling song is Fukushima-based vocal group Greeeen&#x27;s song &quot;Kiseki&quot; (2008), which was certified for being legally downloaded four million times between 2008 and 2015, followed by R&amp;B singer Thelma Aoyama&#x27;s &quot;Soba ni Iru ne&quot; (2008) featuring rapper SoulJa, which was certified for three million downloads between 2008 and 2014. Greeeen&#x27;s song &quot;Ai Uta&quot; (2007) ranks as the third highest certified song, with 2.5 million downloads tracked between 2007 and 2009. Two more songs have sold more than two million paid downloads: Ayaka&#x27;s &quot;Mikazuki&quot; (2006) and Kobukuro&#x27;s &quot;Tsubomi&quot; (2007). The most successful ringtone in Japan is Moldovan-Romanian band O-Zone&#x27;s &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; (2003), known locally as , which was certified as having four million units sold.

In Japan, only two albums have received digital certifications by the RIAJ. The first was &quot;Songs for Japan&quot; (2011), a charity compilation album raising profits for the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, which was certified gold for 100,000 downloads in June 2011. The second album was the Japanese language cast recording of the &quot;Frozen&quot; soundtrack, which sold 100,000 copies between its release in March 2014 and January 2015.

===South Korea===

In South Korea, Circle Digital Chart has been tracking digital sales since 2009. The most successful song according to their published data is Busker Busker&#x27;s &quot;Cherry Blossom Ending&quot; (2012), which was downloaded over 7 million times between 2012 and 2017. In 2011, &quot;Roly-Poly&quot; by T-ara was the most successful song of the year, selling 4.1 million digital copies. 
&quot;Roly Poly&quot; also became the fastest-selling song in Korea&#x27;s history and the first to reach more than 4 million downloads in a calendar year (within 5 months).
In 2012, this accolade went to Psy&#x27;s &quot;Gangnam Style&quot;, after selling 3.8 million units.

<text> ( and in Hungarian), is a Hungarian soup, made of beef, vegetables, ground paprika and other spices. It originates from a dish cooked by the cattlemen ( , ), who tended their herds in the Great Hungarian Plain (known as the or in Hungarian). These Hungarian cowboys often camped out with their cattle days away from populated areas, so they had to make their food from ingredients they could carry with themselves, and this food had to be cooked in the one available portable cauldron (called ) over an open fire.

The word is a loanword from Ottoman Turkish (spelled in modern Turkish), meaning a cauldron made of copper; from the word &quot;copper&quot; in Old Turkish language (spelled in modern Turkish).

The original dish called was a stew, not a soup. Traditional Hungarian is often still cooked outdoors over an open fire in a cauldron, giving the appearance of a barbecue. Later on when the dish left the peasant cuisines and became popular even in the town, it started to be cooked more like a soup. Nowadays the dish served in the majority of Hungarian restaurants is a soup, but the locals cook the dish called as a stew and like a soup. They should differ only in the amount of water used in preparation. The official vocational cookbook for Hungarian restaurant trainees still contains recipes for both and lists the core ingredients as finely diced onions, peppers, tomatoes, meat, garlic, salt, caraway seeds, potatoes and homemade noodles called .

There are different variations of the recipe. The meat is beef, but often mixed meats are used (e.g. beef, pork and mutton or lamb). Tomatoes, carrots and fresh peppers (often hot chilies) are also added. Onions, paprika and caraway seeds provide its flavour. Cubed potatoes or pasta squares are typically added to this spicy soup. This dish is not to be confused with other dishes, like or .

<text>Earl of Sussex is a title that has been created several times in the Peerages of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom. The early Earls of Arundel (up to 1243) were often also called Earls of Sussex.

The fifth creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1717 in favour of Talbot Yelverton, 2nd Viscount Longueville. The Yelverton family descended from Christopher Yelverton, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1597 to 1598. Christopher&#x27;s grandson and namesake, Christopher Yelverton, was created a baronet, of Easton Mauduit in the County of Northampton, in the Baronetage of England in 1641. He was succeeded by his son, Henry, the second Baronet. He married Susan Longueville, suo jure 13th Baroness Grey de Ruthyn. Their eldest son, Charles, succeeded in both the baronetcy and barony. However, he died young and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry, the fifteenth Baron. In 1690 he was created Viscount Longueville in the Peerage of England. Henry&#x27;s son, Talbot, the aforementioned second Viscount, was created Earl of Sussex in 1717. Henry&#x27;s two sons, George and Henry, both succeeded in the earldom. The baronetcy, viscountcy and earldom became extinct on Henry&#x27;s death in 1799. He was succeeded in the barony of Grey de Ruthyn by his grandson, Henry, the nineteenth Baron, the son of his daughter Lady Barbara Yelverton by Colonel Edward Thoroton Gould.

<doc id="797719" wikidata="Q1052306" url="?curid=797719" title="Cecil Heftel">
<text>Cecil Landau Heftel (September 30, 1924 – February 4, 2010) was an American politician and businessman from Hawai&#x27;i. A Democrat, He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1986 for the First Congressional District, encompassing most of urban Honolulu.

==Early years==
Heftel was born in Chicago, Illinois; his maternal grandparents were from Russia and his paternal grandparents from Poland. He attended Roosevelt High School in Albany Park, Chicago, then obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Arizona State University in 1951. Heftel then attended the University of Utah and New York University for graduate work. Heftel was a Latter-day Saint.

Heftel settled in Honolulu and established Heftel Broadcasting. He owned KGMB-AM-FM-TV and several other television and radio stations across the country. From 1943 to 1946, Heftel served in the United States Army.

In 1957 Heftel was a pioneer for what was then called Top 30 programming, when he purchased KIMN in Denver. In one of the nation&#x27;s most competitive radio markets, KIMN became the dominant, #1 rated radio station. Heftel sold the station in 1960, returning to Hawaii, but once again in 1973 re-entered the mainland with the purchase of WHYI-FM, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, identifying the station as Y-100. In 1974, Heftel hired consultant John Rook, who secured the services of Jackson, Mississippi programmer Bill Tanner, who crafted a Top 40 format described by Tanner as being &quot;predictable unpredictability&quot; that propelled the station to the top of the south Florida ratings, where it stayed for several years. The station was later sold by Heftel. Heftel also purchased WJAS in Pittsburgh which he later sold.

Heftel had a knack for getting in and out of station ownership in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. As broadcast revenues are tied to audience interest (ratings) and to advertising cycles, it can be a great business or a poor one. Heftel&#x27;s mostly AM group of Top-40 stations was sold in the late 1970s. The next group of stations Heftel purchased consisted of FM stations which were coming into their own in the early seventies. These were sold off in the 1980s and included WZPL (move into Indianapolis) and WLLT (Cincinnati).

Heftel partnered with Scott Ginsburg for a time in 1986–1987 as H &amp; G Communications. This group included WLUP-AM-FM Chicago, stations in Miami, and other cities.

The last Heftel Broadcasting accumulation of stations consisted of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, and Miami. These were taken over by Clear Channel Communications in a 1996 tender offer. This in turn was merged with Mac Tichenor&#x27;s Tichenor Media System into a new Heftel Broadcasting. That changed its name to Hispanic Broadcasting Corp (now Univision Radio).

==Political career==
Upon returning to his business in Honolulu, Heftel decided to run for political office.

In 1970, Heftel was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate, but lost narrowly to incumbent Republican Hiram Fong. He became a delegate to the 1972 Hawai&#x27;i State Democratic Convention. There, he was elected in caucus to become a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.

In 1976, Heftel was elected to Congress from the First District and was reelected four more times. While in office, Heftel was part of the U.S. fact-finding mission to the Philippines, largely responsible for the forced ouster of dictator Ferdinand Marcos.

Heftel resigned on July 19, 1986, to run for governor, but lost the Democratic primary to John Waihee. Heftel blamed the loss on a smear campaign against him. Democrats have long asserted that the smear came from Republicans looking to run against Democrat John Waihee as an easier path to governor. Many in Hawaii political circles, however, believe the smear was orchestrated by a more powerful political machine that was afraid of Heftel&#x27;s no-nonsense, honest approach.

==Post congressional career==
In 1992, he was a supporter of the presidential campaign of Ross Perot.

In 1998, he briefly returned to the political realm, authoring a book, &quot;End Legalized Bribery&quot;, in which he attempted to prove that the current state of campaign finance corrupts politicians, prevents qualified individuals from running for office, and costs citizens billions of dollars in pork barrel spending and corporate welfare. The book also contained arguments in favor of a national Clean Elections law and mandatory free commercial airtime for political candidates.

After 18 years out of the spotlight, the 80-year-old Heftel made a successful return to elective politics by being elected in November 2004 to the state Board of Education for the Oahu-At Large seat.

==Death and legacy==
Cecil Heftel died on February 4, 2010, from natural causes in San Diego, California. He was 85. (Numerous websites claim he died February 5, but his widow says he died on February 4.)
On June 13, 2011, U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa introduced legislation to designate the post office at 4354 Pahoa Avenue in Honolulu as the &quot;Cecil L. Heftel Post Office Building&quot;.

<text>William Diller Matthew FRS (February 19, 1871 – September 24, 1930) was a vertebrate paleontologist who worked primarily on mammal fossils, although he also published a few early papers on mineralogy, petrological geology, one on botany, one on trilobites, and he described &quot;Tetraceratops insignis&quot;, which was much later suggested to be the oldest known (Early Permian) therapsid.

Matthew was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, the son of George Frederic Matthew and Katherine (Diller) Matthew. His father was an amateur geologist and paleontologist who instilled his son with an abiding interest in the earth sciences. Matthew received an A.B. at the University of New Brunswick in 1889 and then earned his Ph.D. at Columbia University in 1894.

Matthew was curator of the American Museum of Natural History from the mid-1890s to 1927, and director of the University of California Museum of Paleontology from 1927 to 1930. He was an elected member of the American Philosophical Society. He was the father of Margaret Matthew Colbert, an artist, illustrator, and sculptor who specialized in visualizing extinct species.

==Asia hypothesis==

Matthew believed that the first humans had originated in Asia, he visited Asia by taking part in the Central Asiatic expeditions. Matthew was also well known for his deeply influential 1915 article &quot;Climate and evolution&quot;, Matthews theory was that climate change was how organisms came to live where we find them today in opposition to the theory of continental drift. His basic premise was that cyclical changes in global climate, along with the prevailing tendency for mammals to disperse from north to south, account for the odd geographic patterns of living mammals. He believed that humans and many other groups of modern mammals first evolved in the northern areas of the globe, especially central Asia because of the shifting climatic circumstances; Matthew firmly placed hominid origins in central Asia as he thought that the high plateau of Tibet was the forcing ground of mammalian evolution.

<text>Earl of Winchester was a title that was created three times in the Peerage of England during the Middle Ages. The first was Saer de Quincy, who received the earldom in 1207/8 after his wife inherited half of the lands of the Beaumont earls of Leicester. This creation became extinct in 1265 upon the death without male heirs of Saer&#x27;s son Roger de Quincy. In 1322 King Edward II created the elder Hugh le Despenser earl of Winchester. This creation lapsed after Despenser&#x27;s execution in 1326.

During his exile in 1470–71 Edward IV had been the guest of a Flemish nobleman, Lewis de Bruges. After Edward&#x27;s return to the throne, Lewis was rewarded with the earldom of Winchester. His son, the second Earl, returned it to the crown in 1500.

<doc id="797738" wikidata="Q3143340" url="?curid=797738" title="Hunt Saboteurs Association">
<text>The Hunt Saboteurs Association (HSA) is a United Kingdom organisation that uses hunt sabotage as a means of direct action to stop fox hunting. It was founded in 1963, with its first sabotage event occurring at the South Devon Foxhounds on 26 December (Boxing Day) 1963.

==History==
In 1963, John Prestige founded the Hunt Saboteurs Association in Brixham, England, after being assigned to report on the Devon and Somerset Staghounds, where &quot;he witnessed the hunters drive a deer into a village and kill her.&quot;

Within a year, HSA affiliates were founded across England in Devon, Somerset, Avon, Birmingham, Hampshire and Surrey; the HSA now operates throughout Europe and North America. 

Ronnie Lee, founder of the animal rights group Band of Mercy (a forerunner to the Animal Liberation Front), began his activism with an HSA group in Luton, England. 

==Tactics==
The HSA uses tactics including hunting horns and whistles to misdirect hounds, spraying scent dullers, laying false trails, and locking gates to interfere with the progress of a hunt. In the mid-1990s, members used a &quot;gizmo&quot; (a portable cassette tape player linked up to a megaphone or other portable amplification equipment) to play the sound of hounds in cry, causing the dogs to break off the chase. These are documented examples of HSA tactics.

The HSA has expanded into Europe, Canada and the United States, and have adapted their tactics depending on the type of hunting being disrupted. The HSA have disrupted deer, waterfowl, turkey, mink and hare hunts, as well as angling and other types of fishing. As a result, some US states have passed laws forbidding the disruption of legal hunting activities.

HSA UK has published a quarterly journal, &quot;Howl&quot;, since 1973.

==Controversy==

Hunt saboteurs have been seriously injured after clashes with hunters.

A public order act was created to help control HSA members on private land. Part V Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (CJPOA) Section 68(1) created offences in connection with trespass by hunt saboteurs, including giving police officers the power to &quot;direct trespassers on land (who are there with the common purpose of residing there for any period) to leave the land where the occupier has taken steps to ask them to do so, and either: they have damaged the land; or they have used threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour to the occupier, the occupier&#x27;s family, employees or agents; or between them they have 6 or more vehicles on the land&quot;. 
The Act also created the offence of aggravated trespass which was formed (in part) to give the police power over HSA members and actions: &quot;a person commits the offence of aggravated trespass if he trespasses on land in the open air and, in relation to any lawful activity which persons are engaging in or are about to engage in on that or adjoining land in the open air, does there anything which is intended by him to have the effect: a) of intimidating those persons or any of them so as to deter them or any of them from engaging in that activity, b) of obstructing that activity, or c) of disrupting that activity&quot;.

<doc id="797741" wikidata="Q1736399" url="?curid=797741" title="Ryzom">
<text>Ryzom, also known as The Saga of Ryzom, is a free and open source massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Nevrax for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Ryzom&quot; features open world gameplay. Instead of character classes, it has a unique system for character abilities that allows players to construct custom actions like spells or attacks in detail. The game world is complex modeled, incorporating realistic effects like changing weather and seasons. Computer controlled entities (&#x27;mobs&#x27;) display complex behaviors, and animals will, for example, graze in herds or hunt in packs. &quot;Ryzom&quot; offers a scenario editor that lets players design their own areas that can be uploaded and played on the official server.

===Skill system===
Each character gains levels independently in the fields of weapon-oriented fighting, magic, crafting, and harvesting simply by performing appropriate acts (killing enemies with a sword for fighting, assembling jewelry for crafting, etc.) Each level gained in one of these fields awards the character 10 skill points that can be spent on new abilities specific to that field, on general character improvements, or simply saved.

As a character progresses in levels, the skills become more refined. For instance, a starting character casting spells will acquire points in the skill called &quot;magic&quot;. After level 20, points are accumulated in either &quot;offensive magic&quot; or &quot;defensive magic&quot;, and attack spells will add points to the former, while healing spells add to the latter category. At later levels, these are also split, allowing higher level characters to specialize.

All player actions are built of components called &quot;stanzas&quot;. Each stanza defines one of the action&#x27;s effects, costs, or usage restrictions. Players may assemble actions out of any legal combination of stanzas their character knows.

Components for crafting can come from the corpses of killed animals or from hidden resource deposits scattered throughout Atys. Different ingredients provide varying benefits to different characteristics of the finished object. For example, when crafting a mace, using a certain kind of animal bone for the head may produce a hard-hitting but slow weapon, while using a particular wood may produce a weapon that is fast and gives a large bonus to parrying enemy attacks, but causes less damage. Further complicating things is the fact that any ingredient may occur in one of five classes and with a quality from 1 to 250, all of which affect the attributes of the final product.

Harvesting is a complex and sometimes team-oriented procedure. The player must first locate the desired materials using prospecting skills, as resources give no visible sign of their presence. If he does not have teammates to aid him, he may need to balance his work between extracting the resource and treating the extraction site to prevent it from collapsing prematurely or exploding. The site&#x27;s location and the harvester&#x27;s own skill levels both affect the maximum possible quality of the extracted resource.

===Player vs. player===
In general, player characters are not allowed to attack other player characters or peaceful non-player characters. The exception is specifically marked zones, either smaller areas, like the PvP arena in the starting region, or larger regions, like the &quot;Prime Roots&quot; of Atys. It is also possible to engage other players in one-on-one combat (duels), this requires acceptance by both combatants.

==Game world==

The game takes place on the planet Atys. Unlike normal planets, Atys is an enormous tree large enough to sustain an atmosphere and multiple ecosystems on its surface and within immense networks of branches and roots. The various creatures in Ryzom have differing AI based upon their species that allows them to perform many realistic behaviors, such as migration and movement as a herd. Carnivores, for example, will attack specific animals for food, and certain animals hunt in packs. The game also features changing seasons and weather. Weather effects include rain, snow, and wind. Tied to the season and weather changes are the movements of animals and the availability of harvestable materials. For example, a certain type of sap may only be harvested during spring rains and be unattainable during other seasons or weather conditions. Weather conditions can change minute by minute. Each game season (spring, summer, fall, and winter) lasts four real-time days.

Player characters come from one of four distinct humanoid races, collectively called &quot;homins&quot;. The &#x27;Matis&#x27; are a proud and noble race of forest dwellers. They have mastered the art that is a fusion of botany and genetic manipulation, and consequently they have constructed their kingdom and castles from massive trees grown for that very purpose. The &#x27;Tryker&#x27; are a fiercely independent and fun-loving race of lake dwellers. They build large floating cities on their lakes, and networks of wind-powered water pumps around them. The &#x27;Zoraï&#x27; are a spiritual and tranquil race of jungle dwellers. They build their temple-cities within naturally fortified areas of the jungle. Finally, the &#x27;Fyros&#x27; are a tough and obstinate race of desert dwellers. They have mastered fire technology, which they like to build into their weapons and architecture.

Interacting benevolently with all four homin cultures, but hostile towards each other, were two additional and far more advanced races: the magical Kami and the technological Karavan. The Kami are depicted as elusive, chaotic, playful, and highly protective of Atys, while the Karavan are more secretive and have never been shown outside their environmental suits or far from their machinery. The Matis, and to a lesser extent, the Tryker, cultures tend to ally with the Karavan, while the Zoraï and Fyros tend to side with the Kami.

In the game year 2481, the homin races were decimated when the hostile, insect-like Kitins were accidentally released from their home deep within Atys&#x27;s root system. Surviving refugees from all four homin cultures began working together in 2485 to rebuild a single, mixed society in relatively remote areas. Soon came the added threat of the &quot;Goo,&quot; a spreading infestation that renders areas uninhabitable and drives wildlife mad with rage. At release, the game year was 2525.

New characters come from one of the four homin races, and start out as &quot;refugees&quot;, they are scattered survivors of the kitin invasion who have somehow managed to make it to an area called the &quot;Ruins of Silan&quot;. This area, which is not connected to the rest of Atys, contains a variety of animals, as well as various traders and trainers, and representatives for the cultures in the game. There are several NPCs providing missions, including four whose missions act as tutorials in the four skill areas (fighting, magic, crafting, and foraging).

When a character decides to, he or she may choose to travel (teleportation) to the main world (called the &quot;mainland&quot;), and must choose one of the four homin capitals to travel to. This decision can not be reversed, and although it is possible to travel between capitals, the journey is long and dangerous, even for experienced characters.

==History==

===Development and release===

The independent French game development studio Nevrax began development of Ryzom, and the underlying game engine NeL (for Nevrax Library), around 2000. In October 2002 Nevrax made the NeL engine open source as free software using the GPL. The game launched in September 2004 with the name &quot;The Saga of Ryzom&quot; and received little attention at the time. The publisher was Winch Gate.

After the initial release, several updates were released as &quot;Chapters&quot;, providing new features and content. The first update, titled &quot;Changing Times&quot;, featured the addition of a merchants system in which players could sell their crafted items using vendors. It also revamped several of the game&#x27;s key systems, including prospecting and harvesting. On December 13, 2004 the first part of three from &quot;Chapter Two: Open Conflict&quot; was released, the third on January 13, 2005. Major features included the addition of the encyclopedia system and the addition of player mounts. &quot;Chapter Three: Outposts&quot; was released on December 19, 2005. Major features included the introductions of PvP outposts as well as major changes to the game&#x27;s fame system. On June 15, 2006 an update called the &quot;New Player Experience&quot; was released. It replaced the beginning area with an area called &quot;The Ruins of Silan&quot;, which provided more tutorial material for beginners. On October 3, 2006 an expansion called &quot;Ryzom Ring&quot; was released, offering players the ability to create their own content in the form of scenarios. It provides a scenario editor where players can design content, and subsequently upload it to the game&#x27;s main servers. Other players may then access the player-created areas through terminals located in each race&#x27;s capital city. In August 2006, the game&#x27;s name was simplified to &quot;Ryzom&quot; for marketing purposes.

=== Commercial problems and &quot;Free Ryzom Campaign&quot; ===
Since the game was not a commercial success, Nevrax announced, on November 20, 2006, that it would enter receivership sometime in December. On November 21, Nevrax confirmed that &quot;Nevrax as a corporate entity will probably cease to exist in a few weeks&quot; and announced that &quot;several companies and/or individuals are actively engaged in negotiations to take over Ryzom&quot;.

In response, the &quot;Free Ryzom Campaign&quot; was launched in order to gather enough funds from crowdfunding donations to purchase Ryzom and release the game as free software. On December 14, 2006 the Free Software Foundation pledged a donation of 60,000 dollars, but the campaign ultimately raised €172,988 instead of the €200,000 requested.

=== Nevrax and Ryzom sold ===
On December 21, 2006, Nevrax SARL was eventually sold to the owners of Gameforge AG, a German company specialising in browser games, which started up GameForge France SARL as a &#x27;sister company&#x27; and transferred all the rights. Less than a year later, Gameforge France had filed for bankruptcy. As GameForge had not fully paid for the Nevrax assets, these were returned to the original liquidator.

Currently, the game can be played free of charge with a limitation on character level.

=== Source code and assets freely released ===
On May 6, 2010, Ryzom announced the full release of source code under GNU AGPL-3.0-or-later and the artwork under CC-BY-SA-3.0, and a partnership with the Free Software Foundation to host a repository of the game&#x27;s artistic assets.

Since then, Ryzom has been community-developed. Ryzom offers a portal for open-source development of their GPL licensed engine NeL, on which the game Ryzom is based.

Since 2010 all the software&#x27;s source code is available as free software under the AGPL-3.0-or-later license. Similarly, the game&#x27;s artistic work is available as open content under the CC-BY-SA-3.0 license. The game&#x27;s 3D models and textures were ported to the Blender software format in 2016.

==Availability==
&quot;Ryzom&quot; is free-to-play available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux on the official servers. The game requires registration, and a paid subscription is required for characters to advance beyond level 125. Each account may have up to five different characters. Prior to 2012, there were three different &quot;Ryzom&quot; servers that used the same game world, but were differentiated by language, with the choice of English, French, or German being offered when starting a game. In 2012, all three servers (Arispotle, Aniro, and Leanon) were unified into one server (Atys), an event long-time players refer to as &quot;The Merge&quot;. Many of Ryzom&#x27;s chat channels utilize DeepL translation to facilitate communication between players who do not share a common language.

From the start, the client software, referred to as NeL, for the Nevrax Library, was released as free software under the GPL. As of May 6, 2010, the entire software base, including client, server, and associated tools, was made available under the AGPL-3.0-or-later license, and current development uses a community-based open source model. A 13GB archive containing all textures and effects, 3D models, animations, characters and clothing (but not music or sounds) was released under a CC-BY-SA-3.0 license. The commercial ongoing game-world data (story plots, quests, maps, lore, etc.) is not available for download, so as not to disrupt the fan-base. Also, in order to combat cheating, connecting to official servers with unofficial client builds is prohibited.

==Reception and awards==
Metacritic rates &quot;Ryzom&quot; 64/100, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reception. Initial reception ranged from great to mediocre. &quot;GameZone&quot; rated &quot;Ryzom&quot; at 8.1, highlighted the innovative skill system, and called &quot;Ryzom&quot; a &quot;fun game that has some very innovative features&quot;, with &quot;good graphics, and great gameplay and concept&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; also acknowledged the novel skill system and friendly community, but rated the game at 5.6 (&quot;mediocre&quot;), being unfinished and needlessly complex. In 2005, the game received the Reader&#x27;s Choice Award from MMORPG.com for the best game story.

<doc id="797742" wikidata="Q1543874" url="?curid=797742" title="Hertz Global Holdings">
<text>Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (formerly The Hertz Corporation), known as Hertz, is an American car rental company based in Estero, Florida. The company operates its namesake Hertz brand, along with the brands Dollar Rent A Car, Firefly Car Rental and Thrifty Car Rental.

It is one of the three big rental car holding companies in the United States, holding a 36% market share, placing it ahead of Avis Budget Group and second to Enterprise Holdings. As one of the largest worldwide vehicle rental companies by sales, locations, and fleet size, Hertz operates in 160 countries in North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and New Zealand.

Hertz was ranked 326th in the 2020 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list. The company filed for bankruptcy on May 22, 2020, citing a sharp decline in revenue and future bookings caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, the company had revenues of $7.3 billion, assets of $19.7 billion, and 23,000 employees. As of July 1, 2021, the company is no longer in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

== History ==
=== The company&#x27;s early years ===
Hertz Global Holdings, originally known as Rent-a-Car Inc., was founded by Chicago, Illinois native Walter L. Jacobs in 1918. This small car rental operation began with a dozen Model T Ford cars. Within five years, Jacobs&#x27; fleet expanded to 600 vehicles—generating annual revenues of approximately US$1 million. John D. Hertz, owner of Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company, developed an interest in the brand, leading to him purchasing the company in 1923. It was then renamed to Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System. Jacobs continued to serve as president and chief operating officer of Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System until 1961.

After three years of ownership, John Hertz sold the rental car brand to General Motors Corporation in 1926. GM purchased the rest of Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company in 1943. Under the ownership of General Motors, the company released the first rental car charge card in 1926, opened its first rental car location at Chicago&#x27;s Midway Airport in 1932, and introduced the first one-way rental plan in 1933. Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System expanded services to Canada in 1938 and Europe (France) in 1950.

=== Development of the corporation ===
John Hertz repurchased the brand from General Motors in 1953 through his other company, The Omnibus Corporation, which he renamed to The Hertz Corporation. In 1954, its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and it purchased a New York-based truck leasing company, Metropolitan Distributors, including a fleet of 4,000 trucks. This acquisition increased The Hertz Corporation&#x27;s fleet to 15,500 trucks and 12,900 passenger cars. During the General Motors ownership, the company had sold many local Hertz franchises to independent business entities. With the financial backing of investment bankers Lehman Brothers, led by Lehman partner and Hertz director, Frank J. Manheim, Hertz began a buyback program for the franchises in the US, then expanded globally. Manheim predicted the global growth and devised the strategy which made “Hertz” a household name and led to dynamic growth in the company&#x27;s market capitalization from $7 million in 1953 to $100 million in 1965.

The company expanded to South America in 1961. In 1967, The Hertz Corporation became a subsidiary of Radio Corporation of America. In 1985, the car rental company was sold to UAL Corporation, later known as Allegis Corporation, for a cash deal of US$587.5 million. This acquisition expanded Hertz&#x27;s vehicle renting and leasing, with nearly 400,000 cars and trucks in 120 countries across the globe.

In the summer of 1987, Allegis Corporation chairman and president Frank Olson announced the company would be selling Hertz due to internal changes. Park Ridge Corporation, which was owned and operated under Ford Motor Company, purchased Hertz in October 1987 for US$1.3 billion, and Hertz relocated its headquarters from Midtown Manhattan to Park Ridge, New Jersey in 1988.

In 2002, Hertz became the first international car rental company to open in China. In 2013, Hertz began partnering with China&#x27;s largest car rental company, China Auto Rental. In 2016, it reduced its ownership stake but announced a continuing commercial relationship through 2023.

By the second quarter of 2005, Hertz produced about ten percent of Ford&#x27;s overall pre-tax profit. However, after 18 years of ownership, the Ford Motor Company announced it would be selling the Hertz brand with the intent to focus more on building Ford cars and trucks. Private equity firms Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, The Carlyle Group, and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity agreed to purchase all shares of common stock in Hertz for an estimated US$15 billion, including debt, and the business itself for US$5.6 billion in 2005.

The Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice consortium took Hertz Global Holdings public again on the New York Stock Exchange in November 2006, and Hertz began to expand through Europe.

Hertz launched subbrand &quot;Simply Wheelz&quot; in September 2007 for economy-minded and leisure-market audiences. By 2008, the service expanded to airports in California, Florida, and the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada. Once an online reservation was made, customers were able to choose one of six types of vehicles at self-service rental kiosks. Simply Wheelz was rebranded as Advantage Rent-a-Car in the fall of 2009.

In late December 2009, Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice announced the acquisition of used cars dealer British Car Auctions (BCA) from London-based equity firm Montagu Private Equity for an estimated £390 million. BCA was subsequently sold to Haversham Holdings, an investment business, without ever being integrated into Hertz.

=== Dollar Thrifty and Advantage transactions ===
In November 2012, Hertz Global Holdings Chairman and CEO Mark P. Frissora announced the company&#x27;s purchase of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, a U.S.-based car rental brand with headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for US$2.3 billion. The business transaction included Hertz paying $87.50 per share of the Dollar Thrifty stock. The deal was finalized on November 19, 2012, and resulted in a combined 10,400 locations in approximately 150 countries. Before the merge, Dollar Thrifty was the fourth-largest car rental company.

In December 2012, Hertz announced it would sell its Advantage Rent a Car unit to Franchise Services of North America and Macquarie Capital after the acquisition of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group was finalized.

=== Modern corporate changes ===
In May 2013, Frissora and Florida Governor Rick Scott announced Hertz Global Holdings would relocate their worldwide headquarters from Park Ridge, New Jersey to Estero, Florida. Relocation to Southwest Florida was influenced by the state&#x27;s travel and tourism industry, proximity to Orlando and Miami, to condense corporate offices, and to increase efficiency of Hertz Global brands. A temporary office building in Naples, Florida housed 640 employees until construction of a new facility was completed in 2015.

John P. Tague replaced Frissora as chief executive officer and president of The Hertz Corporation in November 2014.

Kathryn V. Marinello, former CEO of Stream Global Services, was appointed president and chief executive officer of The Hertz Corporation on January 2, 2017, following John Tague&#x27;s retirement.

Marinello resigned as CEO on May 18, 2020, and Hertz announced that Paul Stone as new president and chief executive. Stone previously served as Hertz&#x27;s executive vice president and chief retail operations officer for North America.

On October 5, 2021, Hertz announced it had named Mark Fields interim CEO and Paul Stone president and chief operations officer.

In February 2022, Stephen M. Scherr was named Chief Executive Officer of Hertz.

=== Bankruptcy ===
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, on April 30, 2020, Hertz announced that it had missed lease payments on its fleet and was seeking support from its lenders, including activist investor Carl Icahn, in an attempt to avoid bankruptcy. Marinello resigned as CEO on May 18, 2020, and Hertz announced that Paul Stone would be the new president and chief executive. Stone previously served as Hertz&#x27;s executive vice president and chief retail operations officer for North America. On May 22, 2020, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Hertz was preparing to file for bankruptcy because it did not reach an agreement with top lenders. That same day, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Carl Icahn held 39% of Hertz&#x27;s shares when it filed for bankruptcy on May 22, 2020, and he controlled three board seats. He invested a total of $2.3 billion into Hertz shares from 2014 to 2020.

Hertz financed itself mostly by taking out loans secured by its fleet of cars, and if the cars fell in value, Hertz&#x27;s lenders had the right to demand an immediate payment, reducing the amount of the loan, so they were still comfortably covered by the cars’ now-lower value. Because of the crisis, used-car values and sales volumes fell right as Hertz lost most of its customers. The bankruptcy filing started a 60-day clock, during which Hertz&#x27;s secured lenders must wait before they can foreclose on the 400,000 U.S. cars that were financed through such arrangements.

Despite the bankruptcy filing, Hertz announced on June 11, 2020, that it was seeking to raise up to $1 billion in new equity (with disclaimers that there is a &quot;risk that the common stock could ultimately be worthless&quot;). The Wall Street Journal characterized the potential stock sale as a &quot;seemingly unprecedented move for a large bankrupt company eager to capitalize on market anomalies,&quot; as its stock price rose nearly 1000% from a low of 59 cents after its bankruptcy filing to $5.50 a share. Hertz&#x27;s stock has been heavily traded by retail investors, becoming one of the most-traded stocks. Hertz sold $29 million in stock before the Securities Exchange Commission halted further sales. The stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in October 2020.

On July 1, 2021, Hertz emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and changed its ticker symbol from HTZGQ to HTZZ.

In October 2021, Mark Fields was named interim CEO of Hertz with a focus on forward looking investments. On October 25, 2021, Fields announced that Hertz will buy 100,000 Tesla vehicles citing his goal of fleet electrification and that Tesla is the &quot;only manufacturer that can produce EVs at scale&quot;.

In November 2021, the company went public again on the Nasdaq with symbol HTZ.

In February 2022, Stephen M. Scherr was named CEO of Hertz. He stepped down in March 2024, being replaced by Gil West.

=== Accusing customers of car theft ===
Since 2019, Hertz has been embroiled in a mounting controversy where numerous reports have emerged of Hertz falsely accusing its customers of having stolen automobiles which were under an active rental agreement. Many of the victims report having been arrested in full view of their families and at gunpoint. Victims reported being jailed for months before being released, resulting in loss of licensure, professional credentials and employment while their falsely filed felonies languish through the system, depriving them of income and their rights. Victims also reported that Hertz claims that outdated computer systems are to blame, local and corporate systems &quot;not communicating correctly&quot;, but victim profiles have indicated that these false arrests are more likely to happen to minority groups.

In February 2022, a judge forced Hertz to reveal that it reports about 3,365 of its customers to the police every year for theft. Hertz claims that such instances are only a &quot;rare situation&quot; as this is only 0.014% of their 25 million annual transactions in the United States. According to reports, 47 customers have filed lawsuits against Hertz for misreporting cars as stolen resulting in many false arrests and imprisonment.
In December 2022, Hertz announced the settlement of 364 pending claims relating to vehicle theft reporting, bringing resolution to more than 95% of its pending theft reporting claims. In this settlement, Hertz agreed to pay approximately $168 million by year-end to resolve these disputes.

== Car rental locations and operation ==

Hertz has approximately 12,000 corporate and franchisee locations in 160 countries throughout North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and New Zealand.

=== History of franchising ===
Wilford Gwilliam of Overland West purchased a portion of Hertz franchise in 1941. Overland West is the largest Hertz franchise licensee in North America, operating 27 car rental and four car sales locations in eight states. Gwilliam sold it to Devere J. Sparrow, who led the organization until selling it to his son-in-law, Jerry H. Petersen, in 1976. As the current owner, president and CEO, Petersen oversees franchises and employees.

== Rental fleet ==
The Hertz rental car fleet has consisted of a variety of vehicle manufacturers, ranging from BYD, Mercedes, Infiniti, Cadillac, Land Rover, BMW, Porsche, Jaguar, Mazda, Volvo, Toyota, Jeep, and Lincoln, along with various others. By December 2012, the company had over 490,000 cars in the United States. As of 2014, 78 percent of Hertz&#x27;s fleet includes vehicles that reach 28 miles per gallon or more on the highway.

=== Specialty cars ===
In 1966, Hertz engaged racing and automotive designer Carroll Shelby to develop an exclusive version of his modified Ford Mustang. The objective was to attract more customers to Hertz and the Hertz fleet would tempt car renters to buy a Mustang or a Shelby-Mustang. One thousand GT350H Mustangs were built as rental cars, although urban legend also maintains that many were missing original engines when returned. The &quot;Rent-a-Racer&quot; program was available in selected locations during the late 1960s for a limited time. The fleet has included Corvettes, Jaguar XK-Es, and AMC AMXs.

In 2006, Hertz partnered with Shelby to rent specially-modified Ford Mustang GT-H Coupes as a tribute to the original 1966 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350-H. These 500 cars in 2006 were followed by convertibles in 2007. In 2008, Hertz began to rent modified Chevrolet Corvette (C6) &quot;ZH-Z&quot; Coupes, followed by convertibles in 2009.

Hertz reintroduced the program in 2016, and includes vehicles such as Hendrick Motorsports-modified Chevrolet Corvette (C7) Stingray Z/06 and Chevrolet Camaro SS and ZL-1, and a Shelby-modified Ford Mustang GT.

=== New technologies ===
In 2000, Hertz introduced SiriusXM Satellite Radio to its North America rental fleet.

In 2007, the company began testing hourly car rentals at three locations in New York City. It launched a global carsharing service under the name Connect by Hertz in December 2008, serving customers who paid a fee to rent cars by the hour in Park Ridge, New York, Orlando, London, Paris, and Sydney. Later branded as Hertz on Demand and Hertz 24/7, operation in the United States ceased in September 2015.

In 2009, it began testing a photo system to record damage to its rental cars.

It introduced ExpressRent kiosks at various rental locations in November 2011. This was the first introduction of large-scale car rental kiosks in the United States that used a live agent through video chat.

=== The Green Collection ===
Hertz launched its Green Collection of rental cars in September 2006. This fleet of environmentally friendly vehicles has included the Toyota Prius, Ford Fusion, Buick LaCrosse, Toyota Camry, and Hyundai Sonata. In the US vehicles within this group feature Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) highway fuel efficiency ratings of 28 miles per gallon-highway. Different models and different standards apply in other markets. The Green Collection was introduced in Singapore in 2014.

=== Electric vehicle rental fleet ===
In October 2021, Hertz announced it was investing in electric vehicles with the purchase of 100,000 Teslas, primarily Tesla Model 3 sedans. In March 2022, Tesla Model Y crossovers were added to the order. The Hertz Tesla fleet will have access to Tesla’s supercharger network as Hertz develops their own vehicle charging infrastructure.

Hertz and Uber announced a partnership in October 2022 where Hertz will offer up to 50,000 Tesla vehicles for rent to Uber drivers.

In April 2022, Hertz announced its intent to purchase up to 65,000 Polestar 2 vehicles over 5 years from electric carmaker Polestar.

In September 2022, Hertz unveiled a deal with General Motors to purchase up to 175,000 electric vehicles from Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac and BrightDrop over a period of 5 years.

As part of its investment in electrification, Hertz announced in September 2022 a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the development of a national network of EV charging stations powered by bp pulse, bp’s global electrification and charging solution brand.

In February 2023, Hertz stated that it plans to make a quarter of its total vehicle fleet electric. 

In January 2024, Hertz announced plans to sell a third of its EV fleet through outlets such as Auto Trader and EV.com, and to reinvest in petrol/gas-powered cars due to weak demand and high repair costs for its battery-powered vehicles. The company placed much of the blame on Tesla, whose prices cuts forced the company to write down the value of its EVS more quickly than anticipated, and Hertz&#x27;s CEO, Stephen Scherr, said Tesla was less willing than other automakers to give volume discounts on replacement parts. At the time of the announcement, Hertz offered EVs from Tesla as well as GM, Kia, Polestar, and Volkswagen. Scherr also cited how often EVs were involved in accidents at higher rates than other cars, with consumers less experienced in operating them. He noted, however, this was a partial reversal, not a complete abandonment of its fleet electrification. Analysts suggested the move would hurt the second-hand market for used EVs and might discourage some consumers from purchasing these vehicles. Scherr also noted that the decision was based on declining resale values of its EV fleet affecting the price that Hertz could recoup after the fleet&#x27;s lifetime and that dropping EVs form the company&#x27;s catalogue was &quot;the consequence of a material price decline in Teslas and EVs more generally.&quot; It would follow with an announcement in February 2024 that it was pausing purchases of Polestar vehicles, citing a loss in the value of EVs.

=== Heavy equipment rentals ===
Hertz opened a heavy equipment rental division in 1965, the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, with its first location in Houston, Texas and headquarters in Park Ridge, New Jersey. Herc Rentals became an independently publicly traded company called Herc Holdings Inc. on July 1, 2016. The company is headquartered in Bonita Springs, Florida. Herc Rentals wasn&#x27;t affected by its former parent&#x27;s bankruptcy on May 22, 2020.

== Advertising ==

=== Let Hertz Put You in the Driver&#x27;s Seat ===
In 1959, the advertising firm of Norman, Craig &amp; Kummel (NCK) was selected as the new advertising agency for Hertz. NCK developed the slogan &quot;Hertz puts you in the driver&#x27;s seat&quot;, which was first used commercially in September 1959. NCK changed the wording to &quot;Let Hertz put you in the driver&#x27;s seat&quot; by October 1959. Popular a cappella quartet The Hi-Lo&#x27;s sang the Hertz song for the commercials. Hertz used the line in the early 1960s in print, signs, and television. The series is listed as number 65 in the top 100 advertising campaigns of the 20th century by &quot;Advertising Age&quot; magazine.

=== O.J. Simpson ===

In the 1980s and 1990s, former football player O. J. Simpson appeared as a spokesperson in Hertz ads. Simpson&#x27;s place in advertising is said to have sparked black athletes being featured in film and television. One spot from the mid-1970s showed Simpson, at that point an American football player, running through an airport terminal, dressed in business attire, leaping over rows of seats to get to his Hertz rental car. A woman yelled, &quot;Go, O. J., Go!&quot; The tagline of the ad, as spoken by Simpson, was &quot;Hertz, the superstar in rent-a-car&quot;. The ad campaign was highly successful for the first five years it was used, and helped to propel Simpson to get high-profile sponsorship deals with other companies. Through the 1980s and 1990s, Simpson appeared with golfer Arnold Palmer and actress Jamie Lee Curtis. After Simpson&#x27;s Ford Bronco chase and his murder trial, Hertz cut all ties to him.

<text>In a cellular automaton, a puffer train, or simply puffer, is a finite pattern that moves itself across the &quot;universe&quot;, leaving debris behind. Thus a pattern consisting of only a puffer will grow arbitrarily large over time. While both puffers and spaceships have periods and speeds, unlike puffers, spaceships do not leave debris behind.

The period of a puffer can be considered as the combination of &quot;two&quot; periods; the first is the period of the puffer itself, while the second is the apparent period of the pattern of debris produced. This is often the same as the period of the puffer, but sometimes is a factor of the period. A puffer for which the apparent period deduced from the debris is smaller than the period of the engine is a pseudoperiod puffer. Such puffers are typically produced by artificial means. A true period puffer is one in which the period of the debris matches that of the puffer.

Puffers are divided into two classes, dirty puffers and clean puffers. While there is no precise distinction, a dirty puffer is one in which there is little apparent order in the debris (although the debris will still eventually be periodic). A clean puffer, conversely, has a small amount of debris that appears much more organized. A dirty puffer can sometimes be turned into a clean puffer by adding spaceships of the same velocity as the puffer that affect what debris results.

A puffer whose debris consists entirely of spaceships is called a rake.

==In Conway&#x27;s Game of Life==

The first known puffer, in Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, was discovered by Bill Gosper; it is a dirty puffer, but eventually stabilizes to leave a pattern of debris that repeats every 140 generations. Since then, many puffers have been discovered for this cellular automaton, with many different speeds and periods. Puffers are significant for Life and related rules for three reasons: First, if they can be stabilized in such a way that they produce only gliders (that is, turned into rakes) they can be used as part of many more complex patterns such as breeders. Second, stabilizations of puffers that eliminate all of their output debris can be used to produce spaceships with arbitrarily large periods. And third, puffers can sometimes be tamed or combined to form spaceships with speeds that do not seem to be achievable in other ways; for instance, in Life, the &quot;switch engine&quot; is a puffer train discovered by Charles Corderman that moves diagonally at speed &quot;c&quot;/12 (one cell every 12 generations on average), and in 1991 Dean Hickerson showed how to combine several switch engines to form a &quot;c&quot;/12 spaceship that he called the &quot;Cordership&quot;.

<text>The Patoka River is a tributary of the Wabash River in southwestern Indiana in the United States. It drains a largely rural area of forested bottomland and agricultural lands among the hills north of Evansville.

==Description==
It rises in the Hoosier National Forest in southeastern Orange County, approximately southeast of Paoli. It flows generally west, passing through Patoka Lake, where it is impounded for flood control. Downstream from the reservoir it flows in a highly meandering course, making large oxbows as it flows past sharp hilly terrain as it approaches Jasper, then westward across Pike and Gibson counties, passing through more sharp terrain. It joins the Wabash from the east opposite Mount Carmel, Illinois, approximately north-northwest of Evansville. The mouth of the river is approximately downstream on the Wabash from the mouth of the White River.

At Princeton, Indiana, the Patoka has a mean annual discharge of approximately 1,082 cubic feet per second.

The river once included highly diverse habitat that supported mussel, crayfish, and fish communities. A 1994 survey of 66 locations on the river concluded that about a third of the streams in the river&#x27;s watershed were devoid of aquatic life . The decline in aquatic life is believed by most biologists to be a result of acidic runoff from strip mining, as well as spills and contamination from petroleum and natural gas exploration in its watershed. The remaining freshwater crayfish population of the river comprises four extant species, including the principal population of the Indiana crayfish (&quot;Orconectes indianensis&quot;). In 1994 approximately of the river were designated as the Patoka River National Wildlife Refuge and Management Area, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The refuge contains one of the most significant bottomland hardwood forests remaining in the state. Interstate 69 passes through this area on a roughly 1.5-mile-long bridge through land deliberately set aside for the highway over environmentalist objections.

Patoka Lake is a major recreational destination in the region and includes four state parks along its shore.

The name &quot;Patoka&quot; is likely from the Miami-Illinois word (&quot;Comanche&quot;), which appears as a personal name in some historical records. Alternatively, it may be from the Munsee language word (&quot;it thunders&quot;), referring to the noisy waterfall at Jasper.

Crawford, Dubois, Gibson, and Pike counties each have a township named for the river.

==Earls of Bath; First creation (1486)==
*Philibert de Chandée, 1st Earl of Bath (d. aft. 1486)

==Earls of Bath; Second creation (1536)==

*John Bourchier, 1st Earl of Bath (1470–1539)
*John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath (1499–1561), son. 
*William Bourchier, 3rd Earl of Bath (bef. 1557–1623), grandson.
*Edward Bourchier, 4th Earl of Bath (1590–1636), son.
*Henry Bourchier, 5th Earl of Bath (1593–1654), first cousin once removed.

*Charles Granville, 2nd Earl of Bath (1661–1701), son.
*William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath (1692–1711), son.

==Jacobite creations==
George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne had been created a baron by Queen Anne on 1 January 1712. On 6 October 1721 the Jacobite Old Pretender &quot;James III&quot;, who refused to recognise his peerage &quot;Baron Lansdown&quot; bestowed by Queen Anne, created him &quot;Lord of Lansdown&quot;,&quot; Viscount [ ]&quot; and &quot;Earl of Bath&quot; in the Jacobite Peerage of England, with remainder to his heirs male. On 3 November 1721 James created him &quot;Duke of Albemarle&quot;, &quot;Marquis Monck and Fitzhemmon&quot;, &quot;Earl of Bath&quot;, &quot;Viscount Bevil&quot;, and &quot;Baron Lansdown of Bideford&quot; in the Jacobite Peerage of England, with remainder to the heirs male of his body, who failing to his brother, Bernard Granville, and the heirs male of his body. George died on 29 January 1735 and left no male progeny, and thus at his death the Barony of Lansdowne became extinct. His Jacobite titles, such as they were, were inherited by his nephew Bernard Granville, son of his brother Bernard. The younger Bernard died in 1776, when the Jacobite peerages created on 3 November 1721 became extinct, while those created on 6 October 1721 passed to his heir male.

<text>Shuckin&#x27; and jivin&#x27; (or shucking and jiving) is slang for joking and acting evasively in the presence of an authoritative figure. It usually involves clever lies and impromptu storytelling, to one-up an opponent or avoid punishment. In &quot;Ribbin&#x27;, Jivin&#x27;, and Playin&#x27; the Dozens: The Persistent Dilemma in Our Schools&quot;, Herbert L. Foster writes: &quot;Shuckin&#x27; and jivin&#x27; is a verbal and physical technique some blacks use to avoid difficulty, to accommodate some authority figure, and in the extreme, to save a life or to save oneself from being beaten physically or psychologically.&quot;

==Origin==
According to the linguist Barbara Ann Kipfer, the origins of the phrase may be traced to when &quot;black slaves sang and shouted gleefully during corn-shucking season, and this behavior, along with lying and teasing, became a part of the protective and evasive behavior normally adopted toward white people.&quot;

According to the 1994 book by Clarence Major, &quot;Juba to Jive: A Dictionary of African-American Slang&quot;, &quot;shuck and jive&quot; dates back to the 1870s and was an &quot;originally southern &#x27;Negro&#x27; expression for clowning, lying, pretense&quot;.

==Racial overtones==
The use of the phrase in modern American politics has generated charges of racism, especially as such usage increased since 2008 and is usually directed at African-American figures. In 2008, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo was criticized for saying of the Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama, who was running against Cuomo&#x27;s favored Hillary Clinton: &quot;You can&#x27;t shuck and jive at a press conference.&quot; Roland Martin of CNN said that &quot;&#x27;Shucking and jiving&#x27; have long been words used as a negative assessment of African Americans, along the lines of a &#x27;foot-shufflin&#x27; Negro.&quot; Similarly, on October 25, 2012, the former Republican Party vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin generated controversy when she stated: &quot;President Obama&#x27;s shuck-and-jive shtick with these Benghazi lies must end.&quot;

In September 2013, Rush Limbaugh referred to President Barack Obama&#x27;s strategy on Syria as &quot;Operation Shuck and Jive&quot;. He was criticized by Joan Walsh, &quot;Salon&quot;&#x27;s editor-at-large, as &quot;a racist troll&quot;.

At the 2008 ESPY Awards, Justin Timberlake used the phrase to compliment the agile play of African-American basketball player Paul Pierce. This segment was cut out of the broadcast by ESPN due to &quot;the phrase&#x27;s racial overtones&quot;.

==In media==
* &quot;Shuckin&#x27; and Jivin&#x27;: Folklore from Contemporary Black Americans&quot; is a 1981 book by Daryl Cumber Dance.
* &quot;Mr. Shuck ‘n’ Jive&quot; is a song written by Jimmy Webb for Art Garfunkel&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Watermark&quot;. The lyrics refer to an old friend telling far-fetched stories of past glory and their current diminished state.

<doc id="797758" wikidata="Q61324" url="?curid=797758" title="Sophie's World">
<text>Sophie&#x27;s World () is a 1991 novel by Norwegian writer Jostein Gaarder. It follows Sophie Amundsen, a Norwegian teenager, who is introduced to the history of philosophy as she is asked &quot;Who are you?&quot; &quot;Where does this world come from?&quot; in a letter from an unknown philosopher. The nonfictional content of the book aligns with Bertrand Russell&#x27;s &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot;.

&quot;Sophie&#x27;s World&quot; became a best-seller in Norway and won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 1994. The English translation was published in 1995, and the book was reported to be the best-selling book in the world that year. By 2011, the novel had been translated into fifty-nine languages, with over forty million print copies sold. It is one of the most commercially successful Norwegian novels outside Norway, and has been adapted into a film and a PC game.

==Plot summary==
Sophie Amundsen is a 14-year-old girl who lives in Lillesand, Norway.

The book begins with Sophie receiving two messages in her mailbox and a postcard addressed to Hilde Møller Knag. Afterwards, she receives a packet of papers, part of a course in philosophy.

Sophie, without the knowledge of her mother, becomes the student of an old philosopher, Alberto Knox. Alberto teaches her about the history of philosophy. She gets a substantive and understandable review from the pre-Socratics to Jean-Paul Sartre. In addition to this, Sophie and Alberto receive postcards addressed to a girl named Hilde from a man named Albert Knag. As time passes, Knag begins to hide birthday messages to Hilde in ever more impossible ways, including hiding one inside an unpeeled banana and making Alberto&#x27;s dog Hermes speak.

Eventually, through the philosophy of George Berkeley, Sophie and Alberto discover that they are actually fictional characters in a book written by Albert Knag as a 15th birthday gift for Hilde, his daughter. They also hypothesize that the &quot;real world&quot; in which their story is being written may itself be fictional. Hilde reads the manuscript, but begins to turn against her father after he continues to meddle with Sophie&#x27;s life by sending fictional characters like Little Red Riding Hood and Ebenezer Scrooge to talk to her.

Alberto helps Sophie fight back against Knag&#x27;s control by teaching her everything he knows about philosophy, through the Renaissance, Romanticism, and Existentialism, as well as Darwinism and the ideas of Karl Marx. These take the form of long pages of text, and, later, monologues from Alberto. Alberto manages to concoct a plan so that he and Sophie can finally escape Albert&#x27;s imagination. The trick is performed on Midsummer&#x27;s Eve, during a &quot;philosophical garden party&quot; that Sophie and her mother arranged to celebrate Sophie&#x27;s fifteenth birthday. The party soon descends into chaos as Albert Knag loses control over the world, causing the guests to react with indifference to extraordinary occurrences. Alberto informs everyone that their world is fictional but the guests react with rage, believing him to be instilling dangerous values in the children. When a Mercedes smashes into the garden, Alberto and Sophie use it as an opportunity to escape. Knag is so focused on writing about the car that he does not notice them escaping into his world.

Having finished the book, Hilde decides to help Sophie and Alberto get revenge on her father. Alberto and Sophie can interact only weakly with items in Albert Knag&#x27;s world and cannot be seen by anyone but other fictional characters. A woman from &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; gives them food before they prepare to witness Knag&#x27;s return to Lillesand, Hilde&#x27;s home.

While at the airport, Knag receives notes from Hilde set up at shops and gateways, instructing him on items to buy. He becomes increasingly paranoid as he wonders how Hilde is pulling the trick off. When he arrives back home, Hilde has forgiven him now that he has learned what it is like to have his world interfered with. Alberto and Sophie listen as Knag tells Hilde about one last aspect of philosophy—the universe itself. He tells her about the Big Bang and how everything is made up of the same material, which exploded outward at the beginning of time. Hilde learns that when she looks at the stars she is actually seeing into the past. Sophie makes a last effort to communicate with her by hitting her and Knag with a wrench. Knag feels nothing, but Hilde feels as though a gadfly stung her, and can hear Sophie&#x27;s whispers. Sophie wishes to ride in the rowboat but Alberto reminds her that, as they are not real people, they cannot manipulate objects. In spite of this, Sophie manages to untie the rowboat and they ride out onto the lake, immortal and invisible to all but a few. Hilde, inspired and mesmerized by philosophy and reconnected with her father, goes out to get the boat back.
