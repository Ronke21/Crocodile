<doc id="804196" wikidata="Q1809603" url="?curid=804196" title="1990 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active Atlantic hurricane season since 1969, with a total of 14 named storms. The season also featured eight hurricanes, one of which intensified into a major hurricane. It officially began on June 1, 1990, and lasted until November 30, 1990. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, tropical cyclogenesis can occur prior to the start of the season, as demonstrated with Tropical Depression One, which formed in the Caribbean Sea on May 24.
Though active, the season featured relatively weak systems, most of which stayed at sea. The 1990 season was unusual in that no tropical cyclone of at least tropical storm strength made landfall in the United States for the first time since the 1962 season, although Tropical Storm Marco weakened to a depression just before landfall.

Only a few tropical cyclones caused significant impacts. Hurricane Diana killed an estimated 139 people in the Mexican states of Veracruz and Hidalgo, while also causing approximately $90.7 million in damage. Hurricane Klaus brought flooding to Martinique and caused torrential rainfall across the southeastern United States after combining with Tropical Storm Marco and a frontal boundary. As a result of effects from Diana and Klaus, both names were retired following the season. Overall, the storms of the season collectively caused 171 fatalities and approximately $157 million in damage.

== Seasonal forecasts ==
=== Pre-season forecasts ===

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU). A normal season as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has eleven named storms, of which six reach hurricane strength, and two major hurricanes. In April 1990, it was forecast that six storms would reach hurricane status, and there would be &quot;three additional storms&quot; from the previous year, which would indicate 14 named storms. The forecast did not specify how many hurricanes would reach &quot;major hurricane&quot; status. In early June 1990, CSU released their predictions of tropical cyclonic activity within the Atlantic basin during the 1990 season. The forecast from CSU called for 11 named storms, seven of which to intensify into a hurricane, and three would strengthen further into a major hurricane.
== Seasonal summary ==


The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, but activity in 1990 began five days earlier with the formation of Tropical Depression One on May 25. It was an above average season in which 16 tropical depressions formed. Fourteen depressions attained tropical storm status, and eight of these attained hurricane status. There was only one tropical cyclone to reach major hurricane status (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale), which was slightly below the 1950–2005 average of two per season. Unusually, the season featured no landfalling tropical storms in the United States. This was only the sixth such occurrence known, the other seasons being 1853, 1862, 1864, 1922, and 1962. Overall, the storms of the season collectively caused 171 deaths and approximately $153 million in damage. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Nana, dissipated on October 21, over a month before the official end of the season on November 30.

The activity in the first two months of the season were limited in tropical cyclogenesis, with the second tropical depression of the season not developing until July 22. Following that, the season was very active, and there was a quick succession of tropical cyclone development from late-July to mid-August. The Atlantic briefly remained dormant, and activity resumed on August 24 with the development of Tropical Depression Eight (Hurricane Gustav). Although August was a very active month, there were only two named storms in September, both of which became hurricanes. Activity in October was higher than average, with five tropical cyclones either forming or existing in that month. Following an active October, no tropical cyclogenesis occurred in November.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 97, which is slightly above the mean value of 96. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is the threshold for tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==
=== Tropical Depression One ===
Tropical Depression One formed on May 24 from a weak low pressure area to the west of Jamaica, which had been producing scattered showers over the island during the preceding days. The depression moved across Cuba shortly after forming, although the convection was located to the east of its poorly defined center. As it headed toward Florida, it was absorbed by an approaching cold front.

The depression did not cause significant damage. In Florida, the depression was forecast to ease drought conditions that persisted for about two years. While crossing Cuba, the depression dropped heavy rainfall, and predictions stated that precipitation amounts could reach as high as , but the greatest amount measured was at east of Havana. Heavy rainfall also occurred across much of south Florida, peaking at at the Royal Palm Ranger Station in Everglades National Park. While the depression was affecting south Florida, the National Weather Service issued &quot;urban flood statements&quot; warning of flooded streets in mainly low-lying areas, especially in Dade and Broward counties. Standing water on many Florida expressways caused automobile accidents, especially in Dade County, where 28 accidents were reported.
=== Tropical Storm Arthur ===

The second tropical depression of the season developed on July 22 from a tropical wave nearly midway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. The depression slowly intensified, and was eventually upgraded to Tropical Storm Arthur, two days later. On July 25, Tropical Storm Arthur crossed the Windward Islands chain, and it was noted that the storm made landfall on Tobago. Emerging into the Caribbean Sea, Arthur nearly attained hurricane status on July 25. Thereafter, wind shear began increasing over Arthur, and a weakening trend began after peak intensity. As Arthur headed further into the Caribbean Sea, it significantly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical depression on July 27. Later that day, Air Force reconnaissance and satellite imagery did not show a low-level circulation, indicating that Arthur had degenerated into open tropical wave southeast of Kingston, Jamaica.

Shortly after Arthur became a tropical storm on July 24, a tropical storm warning was issued for Trinidad, Tobago, and Grenada; six hours later, it was extended to the Grenadines. About 24 hours later, all of the tropical storm warnings were discontinued. As Arthur headed further into the Caribbean Sea, a tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for Hispaniola and Puerto Rico on July 26. All of the tropical storm watches and warnings were discontinued after Arthur weakened to a tropical depression. After Arthur made landfall on Tobago, several landslides occurred, and a major bridge had collapsed; electrical and water services were significantly disrupted. Damage was also reported on Grenada, where two bridges were damaged, electricity and telephone service was disrupted, and crops were affected as well. In addition, Arthur caused damage to four hotels and hundreds of houses. Wind gusts on the island of Grenada reportedly reached . As Arthur passed south of Puerto Rico, there were reports of strong winds and heavy rainfall. Heavy rainfall was also reported on the south coast of Haiti as Arthur approached the country.
=== Hurricane Bertha ===
A tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa, and after interacting with a cold front and an area of low pressure, developed into a subtropical depression on July 24, offshore of North Carolina near Cape Hatteras. The subtropical depression slowly acquired tropical characteristics, and was reclassified as Tropical Depression Three on July 27. On the following day, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bertha. It drifted northeast and became a hurricane west-southwest of Bermuda on July 29. As Bertha continued parallel to the East Coast of the United States, it had experienced strong wind shear and was downgraded back to a tropical storm later on July 29. However, by July 30, Air Force reconnaissance flights reported at hurricane-force winds, and Bertha had re-intensified into a hurricane at that time. After becoming a hurricane again, Bertha continued northeastward, but transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Nova Scotia on August 2.

Nine deaths were attributed to Bertha, including six crew members of the Greek freighter &quot;Corazon&quot; who perished off the Canadian coast after their ship broke up. Another fatality was caused when one person fell off the ship &quot;Patricia Star&quot; and into the Atlantic; the other two deaths were from two people drowning in north Florida. Damage to crops and a suspension bridge were reported from Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island; this damage totaled to $4.427 million (1990 CAD; $3.912 million 1990 USD).
=== Tropical Storm Cesar ===

While Bertha was approaching Atlantic Canada, a tropical wave emerged into an Atlantic from the west coast of Africa, and quickly developed into Tropical Depression Four approximately south of Cape Verde. The depression headed northwestward due to the weakness of a subtropical ridge and slowly intensified. While the depression was well west of Cape Verde, it intensified into Tropical Storm Cesar on August 2. Cesar continued on the generally northwestward path and no significant change in intensity occurred, as it peaked at shortly after becoming a tropical storm. Later in its duration, wind shear significantly increased, causing the low-level circulation to be removed from the deep convection on August 6, and Cesar weakened back to a tropical depression as a result. As it was weakening to a tropical depression, Cesar became nearly stationary, and turned abruptly eastward. On the following day, Cesar dissipated almost east-southeast of Bermuda.
=== Tropical Storm Edouard ===

A frontal wave formed near the Azores in early August. When thunderstorm activity grew near its center, it was deemed a subtropical depression on August 2 just east of the Azores. Associated with an upper-level cold low, it intensified into a subtropical storm on August 3, although water temperatures were cooler than what is usually required for tropical cyclogenesis. It tracking westward and passed near Graciosa before weakening back to a depression on August 4. The depression executed a small cyclonic loop, developing deep and organized convection near the circulation. Late on August 6, it transitioned into Tropical Depression Six. The depression moved northeastward toward the Azores, intensifying into Tropical Storm Edouard on August 8. Shortly thereafter it reached peak winds of , and subsequently it moved past the northern Azores. On August 10, Edouard weakened again to depression status, and became extratropical on the following day. The remnants of Edouard dissipated on August 13, a few hundred miles west of Portugal.

Much of the western Azores reported winds of at . The island of Horta reported winds gusts from . Lajes Air Force Base on Terceira Island reported a maximum wind gust of . Also a tower on the island of Terceira reported sustained winds at , while a gusts as high as were recorded.
=== Hurricane Diana ===
A tropical wave uneventfully crossed the Atlantic Ocean and entered the Caribbean Sea either late July or early August 1990. As the system entered the southwest Caribbean, it began to further develop, and became Tropical Depression Five on August 4. The depression headed northwestward, and intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Diana on August 5. After becoming a tropical storm, Diana continued to quickly intensify, and maximum sustained winds were before landfall occurred in Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo, on the Yucatán Peninsula. Diana weakened somewhat over the Yucatán Peninsula, but was still a tropical storm when it entered the Gulf of Mexico. While over the Gulf of Mexico, Diana again rapidly intensified, and became a hurricane on August 7. Later that day, Diana further strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane, and peaked with winds of . Only two hours, Diana made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, at the same intensity. After moving ashore, Diana rapidly weakened, and had deteriorated to a tropical storm only four hours after landfall. By August 8, Diana weakened back to a tropical depression near Mexico City. Diana briefly entered the Eastern Pacific Basin on August 9, but was not re-classified, and it rapidly dissipated at the south end of the Gulf of California.

In preparations for Diana, there were several tropical storm watches and warning issued along the Yucatán Peninsula and several areas along the Gulf Coast of Mexico; hurricane watches and warnings were also put into effect. While crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, Diana produced near-tropical storm force winds, and heavy rainfall, but not damage or fatalities. However, the mainland of Mexico fared much worse, where torrential rainfall caused mudslides in the states of Hidalgo and Veracruz. As a result of heavy rainfall, many houses were destroyed, and approximately 3,500 became homeless. Diana also produced high winds across Mexico, which toppled tree and fell electricity poles, leaving many without telephone service and block several roads. In addition, the remnants of Diana brought rainfall to the southwestern United States. Contemporary reports indicated that 139 people had been killed, with an additional 25,000 people being injured. Damage as a result of Diana was estimated at $90.7 million.
=== Tropical Storm Fran ===

On August 11, a tropical wave developed into the seventh tropical depression of the season, while situated several hundred miles southwest of Cape Verde. The depression moved rapidly westwards, and intensified to just under tropical storm status on August 12. However, later that day, the depression began to lose its low-level circulation, while deep convection was diminishing. As a result, the depression became &quot;too weak to classify&quot; for Dvorak technique, and the system had degenerated back into a tropical wave early on August 13. After weakening back to a tropical wave, the system quickly re-organized, and re-developed into a tropical depression twelve hours later. Later that day, the depression further intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fran. No significant change in intensity occurred after Fran became a tropical storm and maximum sustained winds never exceeded . By the next day, Fran made landfall on Trinidad at the same intensity. While on Trinidad, Fran significantly interacted with the South American mainland, and quickly dissipated on August 15.

After Fran became a tropical storm on August 13, a tropical storm warning was issued for Trinidad, Tobago, and Grenada. Simultaneously, a tropical storm watch came into effect for Barbados and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. As Fran was passing through the Windward Islands, the tropical storm watch was discontinued. Only two hours before Fran dissipated, the tropical storm warning was discontinued for Trinidad, Tobago, and Grenada. As a result of Fran, only heavy rains were reported on the Windward Islands. Light rainfall was reported on Trinidad, peaking at . In addition, wind gusts were reported up to .
=== Hurricane Gustav ===
A tropical depression developed from a tropical wave approximately east of Barbados on August 24. After forming, the depression moved westward and on the next day intensified into a tropical storm on the following day. After becoming a tropical storm, Gustav continued to intensify as it headed west-northwestward. Intensification into a hurricane occurred on August 26, as the storm began slowly curving northward under the influence of a trough. After reaching Category 2 intensity, Gustav was affected by wind shear, and weakened, but eventually re-intensified. The hurricane ultimately peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on August 31, and was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, in addition to being the only major hurricane in the Atlantic that year. Around the time of attaining peak intensity, Gustav began a fujiwhara interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Hortense. After attaining peak intensity on August 31, Gustav weakened back, at nearly the same rate as it had intensified, and deteriorated to a tropical storm on September 2. By September 3, Gustav transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, south of Iceland.

Gustav initially appeared as a significant threat to the Lesser Antilles, which was devastated by Hurricane Hugo about a year prior. As a result, several hurricane watches and warnings were issued on August 27, but all were discontinued later that day as Gustav turned northward. The only effects reported on the Lesser Antilles were large swells, light winds, and light rains. Following the passage of Gustav, no damage or fatalities were reported.
=== Tropical Storm Hortense ===

The ninth tropical depression of the season developed from a tropical wave west-southwest of Cape Verde on August 25. The depression headed west-northwestward, while slowly intensifying and establishing better-defined upper-level outflow. By August 26, the depression intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Hortense. After becoming a tropical storm, Hortense was steered nearly due north, under the influence on an upper-level low. Hortense later headed generally northwestward, after the upper-level low degenerated into a trough and moved eastward. Although intensification was somewhat slow, Hortense managed to peak as a tropical storm on August 28. On August 29, nearby Hurricane Gustav was rapidly intensifying, and began to significantly affect Hortense with increasing vertical wind shear. Hortense weakened, with the storm degenerating into a tropical depression on August 30. Further weakening occurred, and Hortense dissipated on August 31 roughly east-southeast of Bermuda.
=== Hurricane Isidore ===
A vigorous tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 3. It quickly developed an area of deep convection with a well-defined circulation, which prompted it being classified a tropical depression on September 4. At the time it was situated hundreds of miles south of Cape Verde at a very southerly latitude of 7.2°N, making it the southernmost-forming tropical cyclone on record in the north Atlantic basin. Initial intensification was slow as the system moved northwestward, a movement caused by a large mid-level trough over the central Atlantic. On September 5 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isidore. Subsequently, it intensified at a faster rate, becoming a hurricane on September 6. The following day, satellite estimates from the Dvorak technique suggested a peak intensity of and a minimum barometric pressure of 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg).

After peaking, Isidore entered a region of stronger upper-level winds and quickly weakened. By September 8 it had deteriorated into a tropical storm, although re-intensification occurred after the shear decreased. An eye feature redeveloped in the center of the convection, and Isidore re-intensified into a hurricane on September 9. It ultimately reached a secondary peak intensity of . Isidore&#x27;s motion slowed, briefly becoming stationary, although it remained a hurricane for several days. Cooler waters imparted weakening to a tropical storm on September 16, and the next day it became extratropical to the east of Newfoundland. There were a few ships that came in contact with Hurricane Isidore, one of which reported hurricane-force wind gusts. The storm never approached land during its duration, and no damage or casualties were reported.
=== Tropical Depression Eleven ===

On September 18, Tropical Depression Eleven formed midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles from a tropical wave. Ship and reconnaissance aircraft observations reported that the depression almost reached tropical storm strength. However, it was torn apart by strong upper-level winds until it dissipated on September 27. The system never affected land.
=== Hurricane Josephine ===

A tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on September 16 with copious convection. It tracked westward, developing into Tropical Depression Twelve on September 21 while located a few hundred miles west of Cape Verde. Without intensifying further, the depression turned northward, due to a weakness caused by the deepening of a 200 mbar cut-off low near the Iberian Peninsula. Under the influence of a building high pressure area, the depression turned to a northwest and later westward drift. It into Tropical Storm Josephine on September 24, although increased wind shear from a trough weakened the storm back to a tropical depression on September 26. It remained weak for several days, gradually turning to the north due to a weak trough over the northwestern Atlantic. On October 1, another high pressure area halted its northward movement, causing Josephine to turn to the east. That day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm as it began to execute a small cyclonic loop. An approaching trough caused Josephine to accelerate north-northeastward, and with favorable conditions it intensified into a hurricane on October 5, after existing nearly two weeks.

Josephine intensified slightly more on October 5, attaining its peak intensity later that day with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . A large mid-latitude storm began developing on October 5, and Hurricane Josephine accelerated around the east periphery on the system. Josephine weakened back to a tropical storm early on October 6, while moving to the north of the mid-latitude system. After tracking near the mid-latitude cyclone, Tropical Storm Josephine transitioned into an extratropical storm on October 6 before being absorbed by it. The mid-latitude cyclone later developed into Hurricane Lili.
=== Hurricane Klaus ===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3 around /h) east of Dominica. The depression rapidly intensified into a tropical storm, and was classified as Tropical Storm Klaus only six hours later. Because Klaus was in an area of weak steering current, it was drifting west-northwestward. On October 5, Klaus briefly intensified into a hurricane, and passed only east of Barbuda later that day. By the following day, Klaus had weakened back into a tropical storm. After weakening to a tropical storm, Klaus began to accelerate, while turning westward. Klaus became significantly affected by wind shear, as it weakened to a tropical depression to the north of Puerto Rico on October 8. Later that day, deep convection began to re-developed near the low-level circulation of Klaus, and it had re-intensified into a tropical storm. As Klaus tracked northwestward near the Bahamas on October 9, it was absorbed by an area of low pressure, which would eventually develop into Tropical Storm Marco.

Since Klaus passed very close to the Leeward Islands, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued, as well as hurricane watches and warning, starting on October 4. In addition, tropical storm watches and warnings were also issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, and the Bahamas. After several watches and warnings were issued, all were discontinued by October 9, around the time when Klaus was absorbed by the area of low pressure. In Martinique, flooding caused seven fatalities, and displaced 1,500 other people. Heavy rainfall also occurred on other Leeward Islands, with estimates as high as of precipitation. However, no effects were reported in the Bahamas. The remnants brought large waves and heavy rainfall to southeastern United States, which caused four deaths when a dam burst in South Carolina. In total, Klaus caused 11 fatalities, but only $1 million in damage.
=== Hurricane Lili ===

A cold-core low which affected the latter stages of Josephine developed at the surface and became a subtropical storm on October 6, about southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The subtropical storm moved southwest and slowly curved westward, nearly intensifying into a hurricane. On October 11, the subtropical storm finally acquired tropical characteristics. Simultaneously, the now-tropical cyclone intensified into a hurricane, and was re-classified as Hurricane Lili. After becoming a hurricane, Lili headed rapidly west-southwestward, and did not intensify past maximum sustained winds of . After passing south of Bermuda later that day, Lili began to curve slowly northward, thereby avoiding landfall in the United States. While about east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, Lili weakened back to tropical storm intensity. Weakening to a tropical storm, Lili curved northeastward and accelerated toward Atlantic Canada. However, Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm on October 14, just offshore of Nova Scotia. The post-tropical cyclone made landfall on Newfoundland soon afterwards.

Lili posed a threat to Bermuda, and a hurricane warning as the storm approached, but only gusty winds and light rainfall was reported. As Lili continued westward, it had also posed a significant threat to the East Coast of the United States, since some of the computer models did not predict a northward curve. As a result, several hurricane watches and warnings were issued from Little River Inlet, South Carolina, to Cape Henlopen, Delaware. However, Lili later curved northward, and only caused minor coastal erosion in North Carolina and rainfall in Pennsylvania. Lili began impacting Atlantic Canada as it was transitioning an extratropical cyclone, and the storm reportedly caused strong winds in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. No damage total or fatalities were reported.
=== Tropical Storm Marco ===
As Klaus was dissipating, a new cold low developed over Cuba and developed down to the surface as a tropical depression on October 9. The depression emerged over the Straits of Florida, and quickly intensified into a tropical storm on October 10. After becoming a tropical storm, Marco steadily intensified and eventually peaked with winds of . Marco headed towards Florida, and remained just offshore of the western coast and nearly made landfall near St. Petersburg, Florida, on October 12. However, Marco continued to interact with land, and weakened to a tropical depression before actually making landfall near Cedar Key, Florida, with winds of . It rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated in Georgia later that day. Although it had dissipated, Marco added to the heavy rainfall already brought to the southeastern states by the remnants of Hurricane Klaus.

Although only a depression at final landfall, this was officially counted as a tropical storm hit on the United States as much of the circulation was on land before landfall in the area of St. Petersburg, Florida. In preparations for Marco, a tropical storm warning was issued for nearly the entire Gulf and Atlantic coast of Florida. In Florida, Marco caused flooding damage to houses and roads, in addition to producing tropical storm force winds across the state. However, Marco is more notable for the impact from the remnants, especially in Georgia and South Carolina, where rainfall from the storm peaked at near Louisville, Georgia. In combination with the remnants of Hurricane Klaus, Marco caused heavy rainfall in South Carolina, causing a dam to burst, leading to three fatalities. Several more fatalities were caused by the remnants of Marco and Klaus, and the system caused 12 deaths. It also caused $57 million in damage, most of it from damage or destruction of residences in Georgia.
=== Hurricane Nana ===

On October 7, a vigorous tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa near Cape Verde, and despite semi-favorable conditions, the wave did not develop initially, due to embedded westerlies, which caused the wave to remain disorganized, despite having deep convection. Six days later, the wave had reached the Lesser Antilles, and split, the northern portion of the wave then developed into Tropical Depression Sixteen on October 16. The depression rapidly intensified to a tropical storm, and then a hurricane the next day, receiving the name &quot;Nana&quot;. Development increased slightly and the system reached its peak intensity of that same day. Nana dissipated while heading southward on October 21.

Nana initially posed a threat to Bermuda, and as a result, a hurricane watch was issued late on October 18. However, after Nana weakened to a tropical storm on October 20, the hurricane watch was downgraded to a tropical storm watch. Furthermore, Nana began to curve southeastward away from Bermuda, and later on October 20, the tropical storm watch was discontinued. The only known effect from Nana on Bermuda was of rain. Nana was a very small hurricane, the circulation probably being only wide.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1990. This was the same list used for the 1984 season. Storms were named &quot;Marco&quot; and &quot;Nana&quot; for the first time in 1990.

=== Retirement ===

The World Meteorological Organization retired the names &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;Klaus&quot; from the Atlantic hurricane name lists following the 1990 season. They were replaced with &quot;Dolly&quot;, and &quot;Kyle&quot;, respectively, for the 1996 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1990 USD.

<text>Santiago Botero Echeverry (born October 27, 1972) is a Colombian former professional road bicycle racer. He was a pro from 1996 to 2010, during which he raced in three editions of the Tour de France and four editions of the Vuelta a España (the Tour of Spain). He is best known for winning the mountains&#x27; classification in the Tour de France, and the Time Trial World Championship 2002.

== Biography ==

=== Beginnings ===

Since childhood, he was very fond of bicycles, especially after his father, Alberto Botero, gave him a mountain bike, with which he practiced and began to compete in mountain bike races in Medellín. Although he was not a good academic student, he became one of the most important cyclists in Colombia.

Juan Darío Uribe, the sports doctor who discovered him and was his mentor in road cycling, says that he gave him the same effort test given to his other runners (some of them were Óscar de Jesús Vargas, Carlos Mario Jaramillo and Juan Diego Ramírez) on a stationary bike. The results were incredible. These pro riders hit 600 watts of power and nearly passed out. Santiago looked like a robot at this point in the test and hardly felt tired. “I realized that he had special conditions. None of the thousands of athletes from Indeportes Antioquia that he had studied showed such a level of strength,” said Dr. Uribe.

Uribe insisted that Botero should train in Europe and not in Colombia, so Santiago decided to go to that continent to make his professional debut in 1996 with the Spanish team Kelme.

== Career ==
He was, for the greater part of his career, a member of the team, but in 2003 joined . His performances as part of the Kelme dissipated in Team Telekom, with the team management blaming his lack of discipline in training, but he claimed health problems. In October 2004 he joined , together with Miguel Ángel Martín Perdiguero from , and Víctor Hugo Peña and Floyd Landis from .

He lives in both Colombia and Madrid, Spain with his wife. Botero joined the American domestic team, , for the 2008 season. Botero finished his professional career riding for the Colombian team . He was also previously the manager of UCI Continental team .

=== Results ===
Born in Medellín, Colombia, Botero was the World Champion in the individual time trial in 2002. His career highlights include a stage win in the Vuelta a Andalucía in 1999, a stage wins in the Paris–Nice in 1999, a stage wins in the 2000 Tour de France, the mountains classification in the 2000 Tour de France, two stage wins in the Vuelta 2001, the third place in the World Championships in the individual time trial in 2001 and two stage wins and fourth place overall in the 2002 Tour de France. Other victories include a stage win in the Clasica Bogota in 1997, a prologue wins in the Vuelta a Chile in 1997 and a stage win in GP Mitsubishi in 1998. After joining T-Mobile his accomplishments in the Tour diminished sharply.

On May 1, 2005, he won the Tour de Romandie in Switzerland, 33 seconds ahead of rising Italian star and favorite for the Giro d&#x27;Italia Damiano Cunego. Romandie is often used as a preparation race for the Giro d&#x27;Italia. Botero carried that form into the 2005 edition of the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré when he won the individual time trial ahead of Americans Levi Leipheimer and Lance Armstrong as well as winning the mountainous sixth stage which brought him into second overall in the general classification.

On February 28, 2007, Botero was presented with his new team UNE Orbitel in Bogota, Colombia. He outlined that his ambitions for the year would be to win the Vuelta a Colombia, to be the Colombian national champion and a podium place in the UCI World championships individual time trial event. In August, Botero won the Vuelta a Colombia for the first time in his career. He dominated the event by winning the prologue and two stages along the way as well as wearing the leaders jersey for most of the race.

=== Doping allegations ===
In 2006, Team Phonak dropped him on June 2 after he was named in media reports in the massive Operación Puerto doping probe in Spain, this just weeks before the start of the 2006 Tour de France. On October 2, 2006, Botero was cleared by the disciplinary committee of the Federación Colombiana de Ciclismo (Colombian Cycling Federation).

== Retirement ==

Botero retired from his professional career in 2010 and that same year was awarded by Coldeportes as one of the most outstanding sportspersons in Colombia.

The Colombian cyclist was 38 at the time of his retirement, working as a professional for 15 years, which has made him one of the best athletes in his country.

Botero is a business administrator graduated from Eafit University, in his country. He also studied service management at the University of Medellín.

<text>A wish is a hope or desire for something. In fiction, wishes can be used as plot devices. In folklore, opportunities for &quot;making a wish&quot; or for wishes to &quot;come true&quot; or &quot;be granted&quot; are themes that are sometimes used.

== Sociology ==
Several cultures engage in customs that entail wish-granting, such as blowing out the candles on a birthday cake, praying, seeing a shooting star at night, tossing a coin into a wishing well or fountain, breaking the wishbone of a cooked turkey, blowing a dandelion, or writing wishes on a ribbon or a sky lantern. Many believe such wishes can only come true if they are kept a secret from other people. Others, on the other hand, believe that wishes come true only if they are told to someone else.

== Religion ==
In Christianity, especially among Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican denominations, believers pray novenas to request a favour they wish to obtain.

Within Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, the Kalpavriksha trees were believed to have once held the ability to grant wishes. The Cintamani stone of Hindu-Buddhist origin is considered to parallel the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone of western alchemy and also thought to be capable of fulfilling any wishes.

==Artworks==
In many works of fantasy fiction a wish is a supernatural demand placed on the recipient&#x27;s unlimited request. When it is the center of a tale, the wish is usually a template for a morality tale, &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot;; it can also be a small part of a tale, in which case it is often used as a plot device. One can wish on many things for example: wishing wells, dandelions when one blows the seeds or light them on fire, stars and much more. When one wishes on a well, a coin is thrown in and the thrower silently makes a wish in the hope it comes true.

A template for fictional wishes could be &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, specifically the tale of Aladdin, although in the tale of Aladdin the actual wishes were only part of the tale. Also, Aladdin&#x27;s demands, while outrageous, were mainly variations on wealth (which is still often taken as the most common request).

Classically the wish provider is often a spirit, genie, or similar entity, which is bound or constrained within a commonplace object (Aladdin&#x27;s oil lamp for example) or a container closed with Solomon&#x27;s seal. Releasing the entity from its constraint, usually by some simple action, allows the object&#x27;s possessor to make a wish.

The subservience of the extraordinarily powerful entity to the wisher can be explained in several ways. The entity may be grateful to be free of its constraint and the wish is a thank-you gift. The entity may be bound to obedience by its prison or some other item that the wisher possesses. The entity may, by its nature, be unable to exercise its powers without an initiator.

Other wish providers are a wide variety of, more or less, inanimate objects. W. W. Jacob&#x27;s Monkey&#x27;s Paw is an example of this. Piers Anthony puts a spin on this idea in &quot;Castle Roogna&quot;: a magic ring claims to grant wishes and then claims credit when a wish comes true, apparently from the unaided efforts of the characters—but every wish made on the ring sooner or later comes true.

Some wishes appear to be granted by nothing in particular. Snow White&#x27;s mother&#x27;s wish for a beautiful child might have been a coincidence, but the father&#x27;s wish in &quot;The Seven Ravens&quot; transforms his seven sons into ravens, just as the mother&#x27;s wish in &quot;The Raven&quot; transforms her daughter. This is common in a tale involving a person, male or female, wishing for a child, even one that is a hedgehog, or a sprig of myrtle, or no bigger than a hazel nut.

The number of wishes granted varies. Aladdin had an unlimited number in the original story, but was restricted to three wishes in the 1992 Disney film. As in the Charles Perrault tale &quot;The Ridiculous Wishes&quot;, three is the most 
common, but others may be granted to fit the constraints of the tale. Several authors have spun variations of the wish for more wishes theme, though some disallow this as cheating.

In many stories the &quot;wording&quot; of the wish is extremely important. For example, characters often say, &quot;I wish I was wealthy.&quot; This wording could be taken literally, the wish granted so that at one time the wisher was (used to be) wealthy but is not any more. Saying, &quot;I wish to be wealthy&quot;, then because &quot;to be&quot; refers to either the present or the future, they would become wealthy.

A common problem is the granter of the wish being either extremely literal or through malice granting the request in a manner designed to cause maximum distress (such as a request for wealth being granted through inheritance/insurance on the death of a loved one). Certain authors have also tried an &quot;always on&quot; approach: the careless use of the word &quot;wish&quot; in everyday conversation having, often unpleasant, consequences.

<doc id="804205" wikidata="Q2600085" url="?curid=804205" title="Osage language">
<text>Osage (; Osage: &quot;Wažáže ie&quot;) is a Siouan language that is spoken by the Osage people of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Their original territory was in present-day Missouri and Kansas but they were gradually pushed west by European-American pressure and treaties.

Osage has an inventory of sounds very similar to that of Dakota, also a Siouan language, plus vowel length, preaspirated obstruents and an interdental fricative (like &quot;th&quot; in English &quot;then&quot;). In contrast to Dakota, phonemically aspirated obstruents appear phonetically as affricates, and the high back vowel *u has been fronted to .

Osage is written primarily with two systems: one using the Latin script with diacritics, and another derived Osage script created in 2006. Osage is among the few indigenous languages in the United States that has developed its own writing system.

==Language revitalization==
As of 2009, about 15–20 elders were second-language speakers of Osage. The Osage Language Program, created in 2003, provides audio and video learning materials on its website. The 2nd Annual Dhegiha Gathering in 2012 brought Osage, Kaw, Quapaw, Ponca and Omaha speakers together to share best practices in language revitalization. In early 2015, Osage Nation Chief Geoffrey Standing Bear announced he would make Osage language immersion a priority.

==Phonology==
Osage phonology is quite similar to that of Kansa. But, it preserves many historical alternations that have been leveled out in Kansa; for example, Kansa *u has merged with *i, whereas it is still largely distinct in Osage.

===Vowels===

====Basic vowels====
Osage has five plain vowels:
These are written . 

 varies between central and front, , and frequently unrounds to . It is especially far front following a velar obstruent and when it is near a front vowel with no intervening obstruent. It most commonly conflates with following &quot;ð&quot; and &quot;n&quot;.

Usually in fast speech, unstressed /a/ is pronounced . This assimilation occurs after a stressed syllable, or at the end of a word. For example: &#x27;cow&#x27;, &#x27;this one&#x27;.

====Nasalized vowels====
There are three vowels that carry this feature: . It is quite common for nasalized to become a nasal and vice versa. Non-nasalized vowels can be heard as nasalized as well. In general, vowels tend to become nasalized adjacent to another nasal vowel or consonant when there is no intervening obstruent. On the other hand, final nasal vowels tend to become oral. However, nasal vowels are always short, regardless of their position. 
Examples: &#x27;girl&#x27; and &#x27;mountain&#x27;

====Vowel clusters and long vowels====
According to Hans Wolff (65), common Osage vowel clusters are:
*iu for example: niuʒõ &#x27;Neosho River&#x27;
*íe for example: wíe &#x27;I&#x27;
*íĩ for example: kasíĩte &#x27;tomorrow&#x27;
*iuĩ for example: ékiuĩka &#x27;don&#x27;t&#x27;
*éa for example: cʼéaðe &#x27;I killed him&#x27;
*aĩ for example: hówaĩke &#x27;where?&#x27;
*óa for example: tóa &#x27;this one&#x27;

Vowel length is important in Osage, but it is hard to perceive and has a good deal of variation. For example, long vowels are often reduced to short ones when they are not accented. Quintero took long vowels to be the underlying form in such situations. There is not enough information to specify exactly how the accent system works in Osage, and there is still uncertainty about Osage vowel length.

Oral vowels are long before non-stop consonants and in final stressed position. When they are unstressed in final position, they are always short.

Lengthening of short vowels often occurs in questions.
:Example: &#x27;you want&#x27; becomes ?

Long vowels also arise when ð is omitted between identical vowels.

:Example: ðakʼéwaða &#x27;be kind to them&#x27; may become ðakʼéwaa.

When e(e) changes to a(a), an immediately preceding c is often replaced by t (thought not always)

:Example: océ &#x27;look for, hunt for&#x27; becomes otá &#x27;look for it!&#x27;

====Diphthongs====

The vowel sequences and are almost certainly diphthongs. The Osage script has letters to represent each of the diphthongs.

===Consonants===

There are thirty-one consonant phonemes in Osage, twenty-two of which are voiceless and nine are voiced. However, Osage has a rich system of stop sounds, known as the stop series, or the stop sequence. (See below)

====Stop series====

The stop series can be grouped according to five categories:

*Voiceless preaspirated or fortis: which may be pronounced as geminates or preaspirated. As in other Siouan languages they sometimes derive from h-C sequences, but not always.
*Voiceless plain or lenis: which are tenuis, and often lightly voiced.
*Postaspirated: which never appear as a surface form.
*Ejective . They cannot appear as the second member of a consonant cluster. Historical *tʼ is in Osage.
*Voiced: with b being the only member in this category. The only environment this sound may appear in is in the cluster . The cluster itself generally appears in the first verb form, otherwise it is somewhat infrequent.(see historical phonology section).
The ejective, fortis, and lenis series of the alphabet are not distinguished in Osage orthography.

Listed below is some features and phonological alternations of Osage:

* occur before back vowels, (usually) before the other vowels.
*The voiceless unaspirated affricate has two allophones: after ; elsewhere it is .

:Examples:
::::íðotse &#x27;be open&#x27;
::::ihtṍtse &#x27;son-in-law&#x27;
::::ðekṍõce &#x27;now&#x27;
:::: &#x27;rabbit&#x27;
:::: &#x27;you went&#x27;

*The glottal stop appears in clusters only after p, c, k, and it is not considered a true consonant of Osage. It is best thought of as a phonetic device used occasionally at utterance level, and it is typically to separate vowels that would otherwise contract.
* has two allophones, and . occurs between vowels, elsewhere it is .

:Examples:
:::: &#x27;cough&#x27;
:::: &#x27;gourd&#x27;
:::: &#x27;spirit&#x27;
:::: &#x27;crow&#x27;

*The phoneme is always voiceless.
* usually has a single allophone , but in the Hominy dialect it has two allophones: initially before and elsewhere.
 
:Examples:
::::ðɑ̃lĩ &#x27;good&#x27;
::::ðɑ̃brĩ &#x27;three&#x27;
::::ðĩe &#x27;you&#x27;
::::cʼéðe &#x27;he killed it&#x27;

*The cluster also depends on dialect. It is sometimes pronounced or .
*In some instances, due to morphologically complex formations, is an allophone of 

:Examples:
:::: &#x27;I&#x27;m finished&#x27;
:::: &#x27;I have&#x27;
:::: &#x27;I am unable&#x27;

The dentalveolar obstruents are often fricated: the ejective always (though it has other sources as well), and the other series before the front vowels . Exceptions occur due to compounding and other derivational processes. For example, from &quot;hką́ą́ce&quot; &#x27;fruit&#x27; and &quot;oolá&quot; &#x27;put in&#x27; is &quot;hkąącóla&quot; &#x27;pie&#x27;. (The fricated allophone is written &quot;c&quot;.)

&quot;Č, hč&quot; are rare, and only found in diminutives: &quot;č&quot; only in two words, &quot;čóopa&quot; &#x27;a little&#x27;, &quot;čáahpa&quot; &#x27;squat&#x27;, and &quot;hč&quot; for &quot;hc&quot; in endearment forms of kin terms like &quot;wihčóšpa&quot; &#x27;my grandchild&#x27;. In Hominy, &quot;šc&quot; is pronounced &quot;šč&quot;.

====Consonant clusters====

Osage has a simple expanded CV syllabic template: (C(C)) V (V). All consonants occur initially and medially; they never occur in final position. Consonant clusters of the type CC only occur in initial and medial positions. Furthermore, only voiceless consonants form clusters, with the exception of . 
The initial clusters are , excluding aspirated stops.
:Examples:
:::: pʃĩta &#x27;I&#x27;ll come (to your house)&#x27;
:::: kʃí &#x27;he reached home&#x27;

===Historical phonology===

The historically aspirated series *pʰ *tʰ *kʰ is seldom realized with aspiration today. Before back vowels they are , and before front vowels (written &quot;pš ch kš&quot;). Some speakers from Hominy assimilate &quot;tx&quot; to or .

&quot;Đ, n, r&quot; all derive from historic *r, and &quot;l&quot; from *kr and *xr. The latter is a recent phenomenon; in the 1930s words with modern &quot;l&quot; were transcribed &quot;xth&quot; and &quot;gth&quot;. Historically *r became &quot;ð&quot; before oral vowels and &quot;n&quot; before nasal vowels, but since the nasalization has often been lost, there are minimal pairs and are now separate phonemes. Nonetheless, intervocalic &quot;ð&quot; is optionally pronounced in many words. It is also sometimes strongly palatalized intervocalically, to the point of becoming .

In words with &quot;l&quot;, this is sometimes pronounced or . The former derives from historic *xl, the latter from *kð and *gð; these sequences have largely merged with simple *l. This is productive; &quot;ð&quot; in verbs may become &quot;l&quot; when prefixed with &quot;k&quot;.

The &quot;r&quot; is apparently an approximant like English . &quot;Br&quot; is most common in first-person forms of verbs beginning with &quot;ð&quot;, where the agent prefix &quot;w(a)-&quot; assimilates to before the &quot;ð&quot;, and indeed this was written &quot;bth&quot; in the 1930s. However, in rarer cases the origin of &quot;br&quot; is opaque.

<text>The United States Military Lands were land grants given to Continental Army servicemen by the United States Congress for service in the American Revolutionary War.

The United States federal government was often short of money in the country&#x27;s early decades. The government&#x27;s efforts to raise additional money in the early 1790s had met with considerable resistance, most notably the Whiskey Rebellion which had been provoked by a federal tax on whiskey. Nevertheless, the Congress and the administration of President George Washington faced considerable pressure to provide pensions as promised for the veterans that had secured the young nation&#x27;s independence. Besides cash, the federal government&#x27;s only other asset of any value was federal land.

Beginning in 1796, the Congress provided 2.6 million acres (10,500 km²) of land to Army soldiers and officers, mainly within the Northwest Territory. The decision to offer federal lands to Revolutionary War veterans helped to establish a precedent that would be repeated throughout the 19th century in which, wherever feasible, land would be bartered by the federal government in lieu of making payment in cash.

<text>The Ho-Chunk language (), also known as Winnebago, is the language of the Ho-Chunk people of the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin and Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. The language is part of the Siouan language family and is closely related to other Chiwere Siouan dialects, including those of the Iowa, Missouria, and Otoe.

&quot;Winnebago,&quot; a name now used for the Ho-Chunk who were forcibly removed to Nebraska, is an exonym, an Anglicization of the Sauk and Fox word &quot;Oinepegi&quot;. The anglicized form of the endonym is &quot;Ho-Chunk&quot;.

==Phonology==
=== Phonemic inventory ===
Ho-Chunk&#x27;s vowel sounds are distinguished by nasality and length. That is to say, the use of a nasal vowel or a long vowel affects a word&#x27;s meaning. This is evident in examples such as compared to , and compared to . All of Ho-Chunk&#x27;s vowels show a length distinction, but only have nasal counterparts.

Ho-Chunk&#x27;s consonants are listed in the following table:

Typical of Mississippi Valley Siouan languages, Ho-Chunk has aspirated and phonemes but no aspirated .

=== Nasalization patterns ===
In Ho-Chunk, vowels always occur as nasalized when they follow nasal consonants . Nasality spreads to an adjacent vowel if that vowel is nasalizable as well. Nasality spreads across syllable or word boundaries and can move across consonants and , but is blocked by all other consonants. Examples include and :

Another frequently occurring nasalization pattern is /r/ to [n] alternation: /r/ is pronounced as [n] when it immediately follows a nasal vowel. That is shown in the definite marker /ra/ on the verb &#x27;have&#x27; &quot;-nį-&quot;, which occurs as [nã] in the sentence &#x27;My knife is dull&#x27; below:

=== Dorsey&#x27;s Law (Vowel copying rule) ===
There is a notable sound law in Ho-Chunk called Dorsey&#x27;s Law[9] which dictates the following:
* /ORS/ → [OSRS] 
where O is a voiceless obstruent, R is a resonant, and S a syllabic sound. In other words, if there is an underlying voiceless obstruent (in Ho-Chunk, /p/, /c/, /k/, /s/, /š/, and /x/) followed by resonant (/r/, /n/, or /w/), the vowel following the resonant is copied into the proceeding consonant cluster. All Dorsey&#x27;s Law sequences attested in the language are listed below, with V representing the copied vowel: 
* pVnV 
* pVrV 
* kVnV 
* kVrV 
* kVwV 
* sVnV 
* sVrV 
* sVwV 
* šVnV 
* šVrV 
* šVwV 
* cVwV 
* xVnV 
* xVrV 
* xVwV

Multiple sources advocate that Dorsey&#x27;s Law is a synchronic process in the language because of the way that things like stress assignment and the morphological process of reduplication are affected by it.

Dorsey&#x27;s Law can apply within a single morpheme, as in /pra/ becoming [para] in the word &quot;paras&quot; &#x27;(be) wide, flat&#x27;, or across morpheme boundaries, as in /šra/ becoming [šara] in the word &quot;šaraše&quot; &#x27;you go there,&#x27; where &quot;š&quot; is the second person pronominal prefixing to the verb &quot;rahe&quot; &#x27;to be going there.&#x27;

=== Metrical structure ===
Ho-Chunk is a mora counting, but syllable accenting language. The stress placement of words spoken in isolation is extremely regular. Single-syllable words always have a long vowel (two moras), and stress falls on the first mora (e.g. &quot;áa&quot; &#x27;arm&#x27;). Two-syllable words have two moras, and primary stress falls on the second mora (e.g. &quot;wajé&quot; &#x27;dress&#x27;). In words longer than two syllables, primary stress most often falls on the third syllable, with secondary stress on each even numbered vowel after the point of primary stress (e.g. &quot;waǧįǧį́ &quot; &#x27;ball,&#x27; or &quot;hocįcį́k&quot; &#x27;boy&#x27;). A few rare examples of words with primary stress not on the third syllable include &quot;booráxux&quot; &#x27;you break something into pieces&#x27; and &quot;gikąnąhé&quot; &#x27;to invite somebody.&#x27; These and other exceptions are a result of syllable weight affecting stress location. As seen in &quot;booráxux&quot; &#x27;you break something into pieces,&#x27; when one of the first two syllables of a multiple-syllable word is a heavy syllable, then the main stress falls on the second syllable

Generally when words are spoken in sequence to form sentences, each retains its own stress domain. However, when two or more words are compounded, they are treated as a single word and form a new single stress domain in which the aforementioned patterns apply. Examples include &quot;hąąbókahi&quot; &#x27;every day&#x27; (a compound consisting of &quot;hąąp&quot; &#x27;day&#x27; and &quot;hokahí&quot; &#x27;every&#x27;) and &quot;wąągwácek&quot; &#x27;young man&#x27; (&quot;wąąk&quot; &#x27;man&#x27; and &quot;wacék&quot; &#x27;young&#x27;).

Ho-Chunk&#x27;s stress system is substantially different from that of other Siouan languages, which have main stress on the second syllable or second mora. It is theorized that Ho-Chunk underwent a stress shift one mora to the right at some point in its history.

== Orthography ==
The official Ho-Chunk orthography derives from an Americanist version of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). As such, its graphemes broadly resemble those of IPA, and there is a close one-to-one correspondence between graphemes and phonemes. The orthography differs from IPA in that the nasal vowels are indicated using an ogonek. Thus, /ĩ/, /ũ/, and /ã/ are written as &quot;į&quot;, &quot;ų&quot;, and &quot;ą,&quot; respectively. In addition, the postalveolar and palatal consonants are written as &quot;c, j, š, ž,&quot; and &quot;y&quot; (in IPA: /tʃ/, /dʒ/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/ and /j/), the velar fricative /ɣ/ is written as &quot;ǧ,&quot; and the glottal stop is written as &quot;ʼ&quot; .

The diacritic marks can be referred to in Ho-Chunk with the following terms: &quot;sįįc&quot; &#x27;tail&#x27; for the ogonek, &quot;wookąnąk&quot; &#x27;hat&#x27; for the haček, and &quot;hiyuša jikere&quot; &#x27;sudden start/stop&#x27; for the glottal stop.

For a short period of time in the mid to late 1800s, Ho-Chunk was written with an adaptation of the &quot;Ba-Be-Bi-Bo&quot; syllabics system. As of 1994, however, the official alphabet of the Ho-Chunk Nation is an adaptation of the Latin script. The Ho-Chunk Nations of Wisconsin and Nebraska represent some sounds differently in the alphabets that they use, as the Wisconsin tribe write a double vowel to mark longer length, and the Nebraska tribe uses a macron over the vowel (compare &quot;oo&quot; with &quot;ō&quot; for IPA /o:/&quot;).&quot; These differences, shown with example words, are demonstrated in the chart below. In total, the Ho-Chunk writing system consists of 26 consonant and 16 vowel graphs/digraphs.

== Morphology ==

=== Verb structure ===
Ho-Chunk is an agglutinating and somewhat fusional language. Verbs contain several affixes to indicate things like person, number, tense, and mood.

==== Prefix field ====
Ho-Chunk uses prefixes on a verb stem to mark person, locative case, instrumental case, benefactive case, reflexivity (including possessive reflexivity), and reciprocality.

===== Person prefixes =====
Ho-Chunk verbs are inflected with eight pronominal categories marked for person and clusivity. Ho-Chunk is a pro-drop language; pronouns are used very infrequently, and information on grammatical person is found on the verb in the form of one or more prefixes.
# First person singular (abbreviated 1SG)
# Second person singular (abbreviated 2SG)
# Third person singular (abbreviated 3SG)
# First person dual inclusive (abbreviated 1IN.DU)
# First person inclusive plural (abbreviated 1IN.PL)
# First person exclusive plural (abbreviated 1EX.PL)
# Second person plural (abbreviated 2PL)
# Third person plural (abbreviated 3PL)

====== Person marking in transitive verbs ======
Ho-Chunk&#x27;s transitive verbs are inflected with agent (actor) and patient (undergoer) pronominals. The generic paradigm of the pronominal prefixes in transitive verbs is outlined below. The letter V stands in the place of the verb stem.:

In this table, the null symbol (∅) is used to represent all third person singular actor and patient pronominals. It indicates that there is no overt prefix for those pronominals (in other words, that they are null morphemes). Some cells are left blank because there are no pronominal affixes associated with that particular person/number combination. In cases like these, the action is reflexive (i.e. I do something to myself, or you (plural) do something to yourselves). Reflexivity in Ho-Chunk is indicated with another prefix, &quot;kii&quot;-.

The sounds in the prefixes run together in casual speech, often leading to the deletion of the /h/ consonant and thus a long vowel or diphthong. This is evident in the example &quot;waakere&quot; &#x27;I put them (standing),&#x27; in which the third person plural patient prefix &quot;wa&quot;- merges with the first person actor prefix &quot;ha&quot;-, producing &quot;waa&quot;-.

====== Person marking in intransitive verbs ======
Ho-Chunk&#x27;s intransitive verbs fall into three main types: intransitive active verbs, intransitive stative verbs, and intransitive &#x27;third person-only&#x27; verbs.

Intransitive active verbs are those which involve only human or animate agent(s). An example is &quot;šgaac&quot; &#x27;play,&#x27; which is inflected for person and number as follows:

Intransitive stative verbs involve an action affecting a patient. This is characteristic of the verb &quot;š&#x27;aak&quot; &#x27;to be old&#x27;:

Intransitive third-person-only verbs designate states and properties of mostly inanimate things, such as &quot;(to) be delicious&quot; or &quot;(to) be expensive.&quot; They can only be inflected for third person singular or third person plural subjects (e.g. &quot;ceexi&quot; (∅-ceexi) &#x27;it is expensive&#x27; or &quot;ceexire&quot; (ceexi-ire) &#x27;they are expensive&#x27;).

===== Locative prefixes =====
Ho-Chunk has two locative prefixes, &quot;ha-&quot; &#x27;on&#x27; or &#x27;onto,&#x27; and &quot;ho-&quot; &#x27;in&#x27; or &#x27;into.&#x27; These prefixes were first described by William Lipkind in his 1928 grammar of the language[11] . The prefixes are added to a verb stem as seen in the examples below:


A locative prefix may derive a noun, a verb, or both. This is true for &quot;homįk&quot;, which can refer to a verb &#x27;to lie in&#x27; or a noun &#x27;bed.&#x27; More recent learning materials refer to the &quot;ha-&quot; prefix as a superessive applicative marker, and the &quot;ho-&quot; prefix as an inessive applicative marker.

===== Instrumental prefixes =====
Ho-Chunk has a set of instrumental prefixes which indicate that an action is accomplished by means of some instrument, force, or special type of instrumental movement. These prefixes are translated into English with such phrases as &#x27;by foot,&#x27; &#x27;by hand,&#x27; or &#x27;by striking.&#x27; Some sources list eight instrumental prefixes in Ho-Chunk, while others recognize a ninth &quot;nąą&quot;- &#x27;by internal force&#x27; (phonologically identical to &quot;nąą&quot;- &#x27;by foot&#x27;). These prefixes are listed first with their English translation, then paired with a stem &quot;wax&quot; &#x27;to break, cut or sever a string-like object&#x27;:
The instrumental prefixes are identified as &#x27;Inner&#x27; or &#x27;Outer&#x27; due to their position relative to other prefixes attaching to the verb stem. Inner prefixes are closer to the verb stem, while outer prefixes are farther away on the left edge of the word. Instrumental prefixes are found in all Siouan languages, and it is theorized that outer instrumentals originated as nouns or nominalized stems.

==== Suffix field ====
Ho-Chunk&#x27;s suffixes mark number, tense, mood, negation, and aspect.

== Syntax ==

=== Basic word order ===
Like other Siouan languages, Ho-Chunk&#x27;s basic word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).An example of a typical sentence is &quot;Hinųkra wažątirehižą ruwį&quot; &#x27;The woman bought a car.&#x27; In a sentence with two objects, such as &quot;Hinųkiža hocįcįhižą wiiwagaxhižą hok&#x27;ų&quot; &#x27;A girl gave a boy a pencil,&#x27; the canonical word order is Subject-Indirect Object-Direct Object-Verb. Word order is relatively free in Ho-Chunk; however, while a word order such as &quot;Wažątirehižą, hinųkra ruwį&quot; &#x27;The woman bought a car&#x27; is permissabie, the change from the basic neutral word order of SOV requires a prosodic pause indicated by a comma. Without this pause, an interpretation &#x27;A car bought the woman&#x27; is possible, though highly unlikely.

=== Negation ===
Negative phrases are expressed with a particle, such as &quot;hąąke&quot; &#x27;not&#x27; or &quot;hąkaga&quot; &#x27;never&#x27; paired with the suffix/enclitic -&quot;nį&quot; &#x27;not.&#x27; Both elements are required in such phrases: the particle precedes the verb phrase, while -&quot;nį&quot; is suffixed to the verb. The following examples demonstrate this construction:

== Language revitalization ==
Although the language is highly endangered, there are currently vigorous efforts underway to keep it alive in Ho-Chunk communities. In Wisconsin, the Hocąk Wazija Haci Language Division runs several language classes, an immersion daycare, and a language apprentice program. Some schools teach the language, or have elements of the language in cultural education. In Nebraska, the Ho-Chunk Renaissance program teaches the language in local and reservation schools. Both tribal governments recognize the importance of technology in language learning, and are active in Facebook and YouTube to reach the younger generation of learners. A &quot;Ho-Chunk (Hoocąk) Native American Language app&quot; is available for iPhone, iPad, and other iOS devices. Language is a crucial aspect of Ho-Chunk culture:

&quot;Within a lot of Native American cultures, language and culture go together,&quot; Lewis St. Cyr, language program director for the Ho-Chunk, said. &quot;You can&#x27;t have culture without language and you can&#x27;t have language without culture. The importance of it is of who we are.&quot;

<text>An astronomical clock, horologium, or orloj is a clock with special mechanisms and dials to display astronomical information, such as the relative positions of the Sun, Moon, zodiacal constellations, and sometimes major planets.

== Definition ==
The term is loosely used to refer to any clock that shows, in addition to the time of day, astronomical information. This could include the location of the Sun and Moon in the sky, the age and Lunar phases, the position of the Sun on the ecliptic and the current zodiac sign, the sidereal time, and other astronomical data such as the Moon&#x27;s nodes for indicating eclipses), or a rotating star map. The term should not be confused with an &quot;astronomical regulator&quot;, a high precision but otherwise ordinary pendulum clock used in observatories.

Astronomical clocks usually represent the Solar System using the geocentric model. The center of the dial is often marked with a disc or sphere representing the Earth, located at the center of the Solar System. The Sun is often represented by a golden sphere (as it initially appeared in the Antikythera mechanism, back in the 2nd century BC), shown rotating around the Earth once a day around a 24-hour analog dial. This view accorded both with the daily experience and with the philosophical world view of pre-Copernican Europe.

== History ==
The Antikythera mechanism is the oldest known analog computer and a precursor to astronomical clocks. A complex arrangement of multiple gears and gear trains could perform functions such as determining the position of the sun, moon and planets, predict eclipses and other astronomical phenomena and tracking the dates of Olympic Games. Research in 2011 and 2012 led an expert group of researchers to posit that European astronomical clocks are descended from the technology of the Antikythera mechanism.

In the 11th century, the Song dynasty Chinese horologist, mechanical engineer, and astronomer Su Song created a water-driven astronomical clock for his clock-tower of Kaifeng City. Su Song is noted for having incorporated an escapement mechanism and the earliest known endless power-transmitting chain drive for his clock-tower and armillary sphere to function. Contemporary Muslim astronomers and engineers also constructed a variety of highly accurate astronomical clocks for use in their observatories, such as the astrolabic clock by Ibn al-Shatir in the early 14th century.

The early development of mechanical clocks in Europe is not fully understood, but there is general agreement that by 1300–1330 there existed mechanical clocks (powered by weights rather than by water and using an escapement) which were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modelling the solar system. The latter is an inevitable development because the astrolabe was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system. American historian Lynn White Jr. of Princeton University wrote: 
The astronomical clocks developed by the English mathematician and cleric Richard of Wallingford in St Albans during the 1330s, and by medieval Italian physician and astronomer Giovanni Dondi dell&#x27;Orologio in Padua between 1348 and 1364 are masterpieces of their type. They no longer exist, but detailed descriptions of their design and construction survive, and modern reproductions have been made. Wallingford&#x27;s clock may have shown the sun, moon (age, phase, and node), stars and planets, and had, in addition, a wheel of fortune and an indicator of the state of the tide at London Bridge. De Dondi&#x27;s clock was a seven-faced construction with 107 moving parts, showing the positions of the sun, moon, and five planets, as well as religious feast days.

Both these clocks, and others like them, were probably less accurate than their designers would have wished. The gear ratios may have been exquisitely calculated, but their manufacture was somewhat beyond the mechanical abilities of the time, and they never worked reliably. Furthermore, in contrast to the intricate advanced wheelwork, the timekeeping mechanism in nearly all these clocks until the 16th century was the simple verge and foliot escapement, which had errors of at least half an hour a day.

Astronomical clocks were built as demonstration or exhibition pieces, to impress as much as to educate or inform. The challenge of building these masterpieces meant that clockmakers would continue to produce them, to demonstrate their technical skill and their patrons&#x27; wealth. The philosophical message of an ordered, heavenly-ordained universe, which accorded with the Gothic-era view of the world, helps explain their popularity.

The growing interest in astronomy during the 18th century revived interest in astronomical clocks, less for the philosophical message, more for the accurate astronomical information that pendulum-regulated clocks could display.

== Generic description ==
Although each astronomical clock is different, they share some common features.

=== Time of day ===


Most astronomical clocks have a 24-hour analog dial around the outside edge, numbered from I to XII then from I to XII again. The current time is indicated by a golden ball or a picture of the sun at the end of a pointer. Local noon is usually at the top of the dial, and midnight at the bottom. Minute hands are rarely used.

The Sun indicator or hand gives an approximate indication of both the Sun&#x27;s azimuth and altitude. For azimuth (bearing from the north), the top of the dial indicates South, and the two VI points of the dial East and West. For altitude, the top is the zenith and the two VI and VI points define the horizon. (This is for the astronomical clocks designed for use in the northern hemisphere.) This interpretation is most accurate at the equinoxes, of course.

If XII is not at the top of the dial, or if the numbers are Arabic rather than Roman, then the time may be shown in Italian hours (also called Bohemian, or Old Czech, hours). In this system, 1 o&#x27;clock occurs at sunset, and counting continues through the night and into the next afternoon, reaching 24 an hour before sunset.

In the photograph of the Prague clock shown at the top of the article, the time indicated by the Sun hand is about 9am (IX in Roman numerals), or about the 13th hour (Italian time in Arabic numerals).

=== Calendar and zodiac ===
The year is usually represented by the 12 signs of the zodiac, arranged either as a concentric circle inside the 24-hour dial, or drawn onto a displaced smaller circle, which is a projection of the ecliptic, the path of the Sun and planets through the sky, and the plane of the Earth&#x27;s orbit.

The ecliptic plane is projected onto the face of the clock, and, because of the Earth&#x27;s tilted angle of rotation relative to its orbital plane, it is displaced from the center and appears to be distorted. The projection point for the stereographic projection is the North pole; on astrolabes the South pole is more common.

The ecliptic dial makes one complete revolution in 23 hours 56 minutes (a sidereal day), and will therefore gradually get out of phase with the hour hand, drifting slowly further apart during the year.

To find the date, find the place where the hour hand or Sun disk intersects the ecliptic dial: this indicates the current star sign, the sun&#x27;s current location on the ecliptic. The intersection point slowly moves around the ecliptic dial during the year, as the Sun moves out of one astrological sign into another.

In the diagram showing the clock face on the right, the Sun&#x27;s disk has recently moved into Aries (the stylized ram&#x27;s horns), having left Pisces. The date is therefore late March or early April.

If the zodiac signs run around inside the hour hands, either this ring rotates to align itself with the hour hand, or there&#x27;s another hand, revolving once per year, which points to the Sun&#x27;s current zodiac sign.

=== Moon ===
A dial or ring indicating the numbers 1 to 29 or 30 indicates the moon&#x27;s age: a new moon is 0, waxes become full around day 15, and then wanes up to 29 or 30. The phase is sometimes shown by a rotating globe or black hemisphere, or a window that reveals part of a wavy black shape beneath.

=== Hour lines ===
Unequal hours were the result of dividing up the period of daylight into 12 equal hours and nighttime into another 12. There is more daylight in the summer, and less night time, so each of the 12 daylight hours is longer than a night hour. Similarly in winter, daylight hours are shorter, and night hours are longer. These unequal hours are shown by the curved lines radiating from the center. The longer daylight hours in summer can usually be seen at the outer edge of the dial, and the time in unequal hours is read by noting the intersection of the sun hand with the appropriate curved line.

=== Aspects ===
Astrologers placed importance on how the Sun, Moon, and planets were arranged and aligned in the sky. If certain planets appeared at the points of a triangle, hexagon, or square, or if they were opposite or next to each other, the appropriate aspect was used to determine the event&#x27;s significance. On some clocks you can see the common aspects – triangle, square, and hexagon – drawn inside the central disc, with each line marked by the symbol for that aspect, and you may also see the signs for conjunction and opposition. On an astrolabe, the corners of the different aspects could be lined up on any of the planets. On a clock, though, the disc containing the aspect lines can&#x27;t be rotated at will, so they usually show only the aspects of the Sun or Moon.

On the Torre dell&#x27;Orologio, Brescia clock in northern Italy, the triangle, square, and star in the centre of the dial show these aspects (the third, fourth, and sixth phases) of (presumably) the moon.

=== &quot;Dragon&quot; hand: eclipse prediction and lunar nodes ===
The Moon&#x27;s orbit is not in the same plane as the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun but crosses it in two places. The Moon crosses the ecliptic plane twice a month, once when it goes up above the plane, and again 15 or so days later when it goes back down below the ecliptic. These two locations are the ascending and descending lunar nodes. Solar and lunar eclipses will occur only when the Moon is positioned near one of these nodes because at other times the Moon is either too high or too low for an eclipse to be seen on the Earth.

Some astronomical clocks keep track of the position of the lunar nodes with a long pointer that crosses the dial, with its length extended out to both sides of the dial to pointing at two opposite points on the solar or lunar dial. This so-called &quot;dragon&quot; hand makes one complete rotation around the ecliptic dial every 19 years. It is sometimes decorated with the figure of a serpent or lizard (&#x27;) with its snout and tail-tip touching the outer dial, traditionally labelled &#x27; and &quot;&quot; even if the decorative dragon is omitted (not to be confused with the similar-seeming names of the two sections of the constellation Serpens).

During the two yearly eclipse seasons the Sun pointer coincides with either the dragon&#x27;s snout or tail. When the dragon hand and the full Moon coincide, the Moon is on the same plane as the Earth and Sun, and so there is a good chance that a lunar eclipse will be visible on one side of the Earth. When the new Moon is aligned with the dragon hand there is a moderate possibility that a solar eclipse might be visible somewhere on the Earth.

== Historical examples ==

=== Su Song&#x27;s Cosmic Engine ===
The Science Museum (London) has a scale model of the &#x27;Cosmic Engine&#x27;, which Su Song, a Chinese polymath, designed and constructed in China in 1092. This great astronomical hydromechanical clock tower was about ten metres high (about 30 feet) and featured a clock escapement and was indirectly powered by a rotating wheel either with falling water and liquid mercury, which freezes at a much lower temperature than water, allowing operation of the clock during colder weather. A full-sized working replica of Su Song&#x27;s clock exists in the Republic of China (Taiwan)&#x27;s National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung city. This full-scale, fully functional replica, approximately in height, was constructed from Su Song&#x27;s original descriptions and mechanical drawings.

=== Astrarium of Giovanni Dondi dell&#x27;Orologio ===

The Astrarium of Giovanni Dondi dell&#x27;Orologio was a complex astronomical clock built between 1348 and 1364 in Padova, Italy, by the doctor and clock-maker Giovanni Dondi dell&#x27;Orologio. The Astrarium had seven faces and 107 moving gears; it showed the positions of the sun, the moon and the five planets then known, as well as religious feast days. The astrarium stood about 1 metre high, and consisted of a seven-sided brass or iron framework resting on 7 decorative paw-shaped feet. The lower section provided a 24-hour dial and a large calendar drum, showing the fixed feasts of the church, the movable feasts, and the position in the zodiac of the moon&#x27;s ascending node. The upper section contained 7 dials, each about 30 cm in diameter, showing the positional data for the Primum Mobile, Venus, Mercury, the moon, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. Directly above the 24-hour dial is the dial of the Primum Mobile, so called because it reproduces the diurnal motion of the stars and the annual motion of the sun against the background of stars. Each of the &#x27;planetary&#x27; dials used complex clockwork to produce reasonably accurate models of the planets&#x27; motion. These agreed reasonably well both with Ptolemaic theory and with observations. For example, Dondi&#x27;s dial for Mercury uses a number of intermediate wheels, including: a wheel with 146 teeth, and a wheel with 63 internal (facing inwards) teeth that meshed with a 20 tooth pinion.

== Interior clocks and watches ==
=== The Rasmus Sørnes Clock ===
Arguably the most complicated of its kind ever constructed, the last of a total of four astronomical clocks designed and made by Norwegian Rasmus Sørnes (1893–1967), is characterized by its superior complexity compactly housed in a casing with the modest measurements of 0.70 x 0.60 x 2.10 m. Features include locations of the sun and moon in the zodiac, Julian calendar, Gregorian calendar, sidereal time, GMT, local time with daylight saving time and leap year, solar and lunar cycle corrections, eclipses, local sunset and sunrise, moon phase, tides, sunspot cycles and a planetarium including Pluto&#x27;s 248-year orbit and the 25 800-year periods of the polar ecliptics (precession of the Earth&#x27;s axis). All wheels are in brass and gold-plated. Dials are silver-plated. The clock has an electromechanical pendulum.

Sørnes also made the necessary tools and based his work on his own astronomical observations. Having been exhibited at the Time Museum in Rockford, Illinois (since closed), and at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry, the clock was sold in 2002 and its current location is not known. The Rasmus Sørnes Astronomical Clock No. 3, the precursor to the Chicago Clock, his tools, patents, drawings, telescope, and other items, are exhibited at the Borgarsyssel Museum in Sarpsborg, Norway.

=== Table clocks ===
There are many examples of astronomical table clocks, due to their popularity as showpieces. To become a master clockmaker in 17th-century Augsburg, candidates had to design and build a &#x27;masterpiece&#x27; clock, an astronomical table-top clock of formidable complexity. Examples can be found in museums, such as London&#x27;s British Museum.

Currently Edmund Scientific among other retailers offers a mechanical Tellurium clock, perhaps the first mechanical astronomical clock to be mass-marketed.

In Japan, Tanaka Hisashige made a Myriad year clock in 1851.

=== Watches ===

More recently, independent clockmaker created a wristwatch astrolabe, the &quot;Astrolabium&quot; in addition to the &quot;Planetarium 2000&quot;, the &quot;Eclipse 2001&quot; and the &quot;Real Moon.&quot; Ulysse Nardin also sells several astronomical wristwatches, the &quot;Astrolabium,&quot; &quot;Planetarium&quot;, and the &quot;Tellurium J. Kepler.&quot;
=== Other examples ===
Two of Holland America&#x27;s cruise ships, the &quot;MS Rotterdam&quot; and the &quot;MS Amsterdam&quot;, both have large astronomical clocks as their main centerpieces inside the ships&#x27; atriums.

<doc id="804230" wikidata="Q5134300" url="?curid=804230" title="Clintonville (Columbus, Ohio)">
<text>Clintonville is a suburban neighborhood in north-central Columbus, Ohio, United States with around 30,000 residents. Its borders, associated with the Clintonville Area Commission, are the Olentangy River on the west, Glen Echo Creek to the south, a set of railroad tracks to the east, and on the north by the Worthington city limits.

As the cachet of the Clintonville neighborhood grew towards the turn of the 21st century, real estate agents began to label homes north of Cooke Road as Clintonville or Clintonville or Beechwold thus leading to the apparent absorption of Beechwold and nearby Columbus subdivisions south of Worthington. The area also contains the former unincorporated community of Evanston, a name that was used by the Big Four Railroad as a station along its line and U.S. Postal service until the 1920s. Clintonville includes parts of ZIP codes 43202 and 43214. The United States Post Offices at the center of each ZIP code are known as Clintonville Station and Beechwold Station, respectively.

==History==
The community of Clintonville developed as the center of Clinton Township (named for the U.S. Vice President George Clinton), part of the land grants given to Continental Army soldiers in lieu of pensions in what used to be Wyandot Indian territory. For years, the steep hillsides discouraged development, until farmland was purchased by the Bull family and then used for religious services. Clinton Chapel (now a funeral home) was constructed in 1838 and served as a stop on the Underground Railroad over the next two decades.
Thomas Bull, a Methodist minister, along with his wife, four sons and one of his two daughters moved to Central Ohio from Vermont in 1812. His second daughter, Chloe Brevoort and her family, joined the rest of the Bull family about a year later. The family first settled in the Worthington area while they searched for land to purchase at a suitable price.

In 1813, Bull purchased 600 acres along the Columbus-Worthington Pike from John Rathbone. Before the Adams administration patented the land to Rathbone, it had been part of the United States Military Lands—land which was set aside to be given to Revolutionary War soldiers as both a pension and as a payment for their service in the War of Independence. Rathbone was a New Yorker who had never set foot in Ohio. Nonetheless, he owned a quarter section of Clinton Township which was named for George Clinton, the vice president in the Jefferson administration.

Once Thomas Bull and his family settled the land and began to farm, they were faced with a mighty problem. Namely, there was no one else around— nowhere they could easily go to buy shoes, have blacksmith or carpentry work done—they were isolated. This isolation made the management of a 600-acre farm difficult at best.

In an attempt to draw others to the area and lessen the isolation of their farm, the Bulls built businesses in the center of Clinton Township, along the plank toll road that later became North High Street, the main north–south thoroughfare connecting Columbus to Worthington, Ohio to the north. They offered to give these buildings away to any skilled laborers who would stay. A post office designated &quot;Clintonville&quot; opened in the center of this district on September 13, 1847, and this date is marked by present-day Clintonville residents as the neighborhood&#x27;s &quot;birthday&quot;.

By the early 1900s, downtown Columbus residents and professors from Ohio State University had built summer homes in Clintonville and the surrounding farmland was developed into housing developments shortly after the extension of the streetcar lines northward from Columbus, which identifies the community as a streetcar suburb of Columbus. A business district developed in Beechwold, separated by nearly a mile of residences from the Clintonville district to the south. Both communities were entirely part of Columbus by the 1950s after it annexed most of Clinton Township.
==Governance==
Clintonville is part of the City of Columbus and is therefore governed by the City of Columbus.

Because Columbus City Council does not use a ward system of representative government (all members of City Council are elected at large) the city created a series of Area Commissions to act in an advisory capacity to the city in reviewing zoning, variance, and demolition requests. The Clintonville and Beechwold neighborhoods, along with other Columbus neighborhoods are represented by the Clintonville Area Commission. The nine district-representative commissioners of the commission are nominated by neighborhood elections—with the commissioners being subsequently subject to appointment by the Columbus mayor and affirmation by the Columbus City Council. The Old Beechwold subdivision is further subject to an architectural review process.

Since 2004, residents along the southern ridge of Glen Echo Ravine have been seeking to have their neighborhood represented by the Clintonville Area Commission rather than by the University Area Commission, citing the view that their needs more closely match those of Clintonville residents than those of the University Area. While there currently is not a process for accommodating such requests, their request has caught the attention of city leaders who are examining the whole area commission program.

==Neighborhoods==
The topography of Clintonville is divided into two distinct regions, with North High Street forming the demarcation line. Property west of North High Street to the Olentangy River is lower in elevation than property to east of North High Street. Six glacial ravines, Glen Echo, Walhalla, Overbrook, Beechwold, Delawanda and Bill Moose Run cut through the area from east to west, with stream beds feeding into the Olentangy River. Four of the ravines have been developed, either with public roadbeds and/or private residences, with Glen Echo being the first ravine preserved as a public park in 1913. A portion of Overbrook Ravine is part of Whetstone Park, adjacent to the Park of Roses.

Residential districts in Clintonville are divided into five distinct (official &amp; unofficial) areas:
* South Clintonville – South of North Broadway, housing stock is a mix of single and multiple family homes. The majority of these houses were built prior to 1930, and represent a variety of styles from basic American foursquare to other types of revival style architecture. The area is also home to many catalog (Sears, Montgomery Ward, Radford, etc.) kit homes. These neighborhoods were also initially developed as &quot;streetcar&quot; developments, the intention being that most residents would rely upon the High Street streetcar lines to travel to downtown Columbus. Garages for the earliest developed streets are accessed via alleys behind the properties.
* North Clintonville – Immediately north of North Broadway and stretching to the Overbrook Ravine, this central section of Clintonville shows the progression in architectural styles and lifestyle considerations from 1910 through the late 1950s. Houses in this portion of Clintonville were built as higher end properties, lack alleyways and contain driveways as a nod to the increasing importance to the role of the automobile.
* Beechwold – Named for the Jeffrey family summer estate on North High Street, Beechwold contains the widest variety of housing, from Cape Cod influenced starter homes to high style, high end housing that occupies the land comprising the former Jeffrey family estate. Loosely defined as the area North of Henderson Rd, South of Riverview Park, East to Indianola Ave. and West to the Olentangy River.
* North of Morse – North of Morse Road and extending north to the Worthington city limits. This area is home to Bill Moose Run, the recently refurbished Graceland Shopping Center, the Ohio School for the Deaf and the Ohio State School for the Blind. A new park has recently been created at the site of the former Sharon Elementary School. The unincorporated areas west of High Street and located in Sharon Township are not part of Clintonville.
* Old Beechwold – Old Beechwold is Clintonville&#x27;s only neighborhood that is listed on the city, state and National Historic Registry. Old Beechwold is bounded on the East by High Street and on the West by the Olentangy River. The northernmost street is W. Jeffrey Place. The southernmost street is Riverview Park.

==Streets==
Like many of the neighborhoods in Columbus, the streets were often named after either early settlers or areas of Great Britain. However, the streets in the Walhalla Park Place section of Clintonville bear the legacy of Mathias Armbruster, a Bavarian immigrant who was fascinated with Norse mythology and Wagnerian opera; these street names include Druid, Mimring, Midgard, Brynhild, Gudrun, and Walhalla.

List of early settlers who have streets named after them:
* Judge Orland Aldrich (1882)
* Isaac Brevoort (1814)
* Reverend Philander Chase (1817) – First Episcopal Bishop of Ohio
* John Webster (1831)
* Jacob Weisheimer (1865)
* Dr. Charles Wetmore (1830)

List of early land owners who have streets named after them:
* Henry C. Cook(e)
* A. Henderson
* Thomas A. Ingham
* Walter Guy Richards
* L. E. Schreyer

==Landmarks==
Popular landmarks in Clintonville include its registered historic sites, the &quot;Welcome to Clintonville&quot; signs at the main entryways of the community, and Immaculate Conception Church.

A commemorative historical marker for Clinton Township and Clintonville is now at the North High Street entrance driveway to the Clintonville Woman&#x27;s Club, the sign originally having been at the corner of East North Broadway and North High streets – a mile south of the present location.

Landmarks on the national and Columbus registers of historic places include:
*A.B. Graham House
*East North Broadway Historic District
*Northmoor Engine House
*Old Beechwold Historic District
*Richard Berry Jr. House
*Truman and Sylvia Bull Coe House
*Weisheimer House

===Whetstone Park===
Whetstone Park in Clintonville is a Columbus landmark. The Park includes bike trails, baseball fields and tennis courts, a pond, ravine, library and recreation facility, as well as the Columbus Park of Roses. Opened in 1952, the Park of Roses is a frequent site for weddings and special events. In June, the Park of Roses hosts its annual &quot;Rose Festival.&quot; During summer months concerts featuring many of Columbus&#x27; brass bands are held every Sunday evening at the Park&#x27;s gazebo. Originally located at Fort Hayes, the gazebo was relocated to the park and restored in 1976. A group of volunteers hosted an annual Fourth of July fireworks display for the Clintonville community at Whetstone Park, but the group disbanded in 2019.

===Olentangy Park===
Clintonville was once home to the largest amusement park in the United States. First opened in 1880 as &quot;The Villa,&quot; by 1900, the park and picnic ground had become Olentangy Park in 1896. This park, located along North High Street between North Street and Tulane Road, grew rapidly between 1900 and 1915 and at one time, featured four large roller coasters, including a rare looping coaster known as the &quot;Loop the Loop&quot;, a zoo, a dance pavilion, a large &quot;Shoot-the-Chutes&quot; water slide, and a building from which visitors could rent canoes for a day on the Olentangy River. It was also home to the largest theatre in the country, as well as the largest swimming pool in the country at the time. Olentangy Park closed for its last season in 1937 and its land sold to L.L. LeVeque in 1938. The land was used to build the Olentangy Village apartment complex; scattered remains of the park could still be found in the woods by the river as recently as the late 1980s. The park&#x27;s carousel was moved several times and in 1999 it was restored. This carousel can now be seen at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium.

===Columbus Zoo===
Columbus&#x27;s first zoo was located in Clintonville. Opening in May 1905, the &quot;Columbus Zoological Gardens&quot; was located in what is now Old Beechwold at Beechwold Road and North High Street. The zoo closed only five months later in October 1905. The only remaining structures are the zoo&#x27;s monkey house, now used as a barn and located at 150 W. Beechwold Blvd., the zoo&#x27;s stone entrance way, and the &quot;kissing bridge&quot;, now Rustic Bridge Road.

<doc id="804232" wikidata="Q1957120" url="?curid=804232" title="Mandan language">
<text>Mandan () is an extinct Siouan language of North Dakota in the United States.
== Use and revitalization efforts ==
By 2009, there was just one fluent speaker of Mandan, Edwin Benson (1931–2016). The language is being taught in local school programs to encourage the use of the language. Prior to Benson&#x27;s death, Estonian linguist Indrek Park worked with him for more than two years to preserve the language as much as possible. The 2020 documentary &quot;To Save A Language&quot; portrays Park&#x27;s efforts to revive the language.

Mandan is taught at Fort Berthold Community College along with the Hidatsa and Arikara languages. Linguist Mauricio Mixco of the University of Utah has been involved in fieldwork with remaining speakers since 1993. As of 2007, extensive materials in the Mandan language at the college and at the North Dakota Heritage Center, in Bismarck, North Dakota, remained to be processed, according to linguists.

The MHA Language Project has created language learning materials for Mandan, including a vocabulary app, a dictionary, and several books in the language. They also provide a summer learning institute and materials for teachers.

==Classification==
Mandan was initially thought to be closely related to Hidatsa and Crow. However, since Mandan has had language contact with Hidatsa and Crow for many years, the exact relationship between Mandan and other Siouan languages (including Hidatsa and Crow) has been obscured and is currently undetermined. Thus, Mandan is most often considered to be a separate branch of the Siouan family.

Mandan has two main dialects: Nuptare and Nuetare.

Only the Nuptare variety survived into the 20th century, and all speakers were bilingual in Hidatsa. In 1999, there were only six fluent speakers of Mandan still alive. Edwin Benson, the last surviving fluent Mandan speaker, died in 2016.

The language received much attention from White Americans because of the supposedly lighter skin color of the Mandan people, which they speculated was due to an ultimate European origin. In the 1830s Prince Maximilian of Wied spent more time recording Mandan over all other Siouan languages and prepared a comparison list of Mandan and Welsh words (he thought that the Mandan might be displaced Welsh). The idea of a Mandan/Welsh connection was also supported by George Catlin.

Will and Spinden (p. 188) report that the medicine men had their own secret language.

==Phonology==

Mandan has the following consonant phonemes:
 and become and before nasal vowels, and is realized as word-initially.

==Morphology==

Mandan is a subject–object–verb language.

Mandan has a system of allocutive agreement and so different grammatical forms may be used that depend on the gender of the addressee. Questions asked of men must use the suffix the suffix is used to ask of women. Likewise, the indicative suffix is to address men, to address women. The same goes for the imperative: (male), (female).

Mandan verbs include a set of postural verbs, which encode the shapes of the subject of the verb:



The English translations are not &quot;A pot was sitting there,&quot; &quot;A big village stood there,&quot; or &quot;The river lay there.&quot; That reflects the fact that the postural categorization is required in such Mandan locative statements.

==Vocabulary==

Mandan, like many other North American languages, has elements of sound symbolism in its vocabulary. A sound often denotes smallness/less intensity, denotes medium-ness, denotes largeness/greater intensity:
* &quot;yellow&quot;
* &quot;tawny&quot;
* &quot;brown&quot;
* &quot;tinkle&quot;
* &quot;rattle&quot;

Compare the similar examples in Lakhota.

<doc id="804237" wikidata="Q1207611" url="?curid=804237" title="Crow language">
<text>Crow (native name: or ) is a Missouri Valley Siouan language spoken primarily by the Crow Tribe in present-day southeastern Montana. The word translates to &quot;Children of the Large Beaked Bird&quot; (from &quot;apá&quot; &#x27;beak/nose&#x27;, &quot;isáa&quot; &#x27;big&#x27;, &quot;dooká&quot; &#x27;child&#x27;), which was later incorrectly translated into English as &#x27;Crow&#x27;. It is one of the larger populations of American Indian languages with 4,160 speakers according to the 2015 US Census.

==Dialects==
Crow is closely related to Hidatsa spoken by the Hidatsa tribe of the Dakotas; the two languages are the only members of the Missouri Valley Siouan family. Despite their similarities, Crow and Hidatsa are not mutually intelligible.

==Status==
According to Ethnologue with figures from 1998, 77% of Crow people over 66 years old speak the language; &quot;some&quot; parents and older adults, &quot;few&quot; high school students and &quot;no pre-schoolers&quot; speak Crow. 80% of the Crow Tribe prefers to speak in English. The language was defined as &quot;definitely endangered&quot; by UNESCO as of 2012.

However, R. Graczyk claims in his &quot;A Grammar of Crow&quot; (2007) that &quot;[u]nlike many other native languages of North America in general, and the northern plain in particular, the Crow language still exhibits considerable vitality: there are fluent speakers of all ages, and at least some children are still acquiring Crow as their first language.&quot; Many of the younger population who do not speak Crow are able to understand it. Almost all of those who do speak Crow are also bilingual in English. Graczyk cites the reservation community as the reason for both the high level of bilingual Crow-English speakers and the continued use and prevalence of the Crow language. Daily contact with non–American Indians on the reservation for over one hundred years has led to high usage of English. Traditional culture within the community, however, has preserved the language via religious ceremonies and the traditional clan system.

Currently, most speakers of Crow are 30 and older but a few younger speakers are learning it. There are increased efforts for children to learn Crow as their first language and many do on the Crow Reservation of Montana, particularly through a Crow language immersion school that was sponsored in 2012. Development for the language includes a Crow language dictionary and portions of the Bible published from 1980-2007. The current literacy rate is around 1-5% for first language speakers and 75-100% for second language learners. Teens are immersed in Crow at the Apsaalooke language camp sponsored by the Crow Tribe.

==Classification==
Crow is closely related to Hidatsa spoken by the Hidatsa tribe of the Dakotas; the two languages are the only members of the Missouri Valley Siouan family. The ancestor of Crow-Hidatsa may have constituted the initial split from Proto-Siouan. Crow and Hidatsa are not mutually intelligible, however the two languages share many phonological features, cognates and have similar morphologies and syntax. The split between Crow and Hidatsa may have occurred between 300 and 800 years ago.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
There are five distinct vowels in Crow, which occur either long or short with the exception of the mid vowels.

There is also a marginal diphthong &quot;ea&quot; that only occurs in two native Crow stems: &quot;déaxa&quot; &#x27;clear&#x27; and &quot;béaxa&quot; &#x27;intermittent&#x27;.

===Consonants===
Crow has a very sparse consonant inventory, much like many other languages of the Great Plains.

Stops are aspirated word-initially, word-finally, when geminated (e.g. [ppʰ]) and when following another stop (e.g. [ptʰ]). Stops in a consonant cluster with &quot;h&quot; as the initial radical (&quot;hp&quot;, &quot;ht&quot;, &quot;hk&quot;) are unaspirated and lax. Gemination in stops only occurs intervocalically. Intervocalic single, nongeminate stops are lax, unaspirated, and generally voiced. The difference between voiced stops &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; (allophones of &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;) and voiceless stops is hardly discernible when following a fricative, since both are unaspirated and lax. The phoneme &quot;k&quot; has a palatalized allophone [kʲ] that occurs after &quot;i&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;sh&quot;, often word-finally.

Fricatives are tense; they are only lax when intervocalic. Palatal &quot;sh&quot; is often voiced intervocalically; &quot;s&quot; is sometimes voiced intervocalically; &quot;x&quot; is never voiced. The alveolar fricative /s/ has an optional allophone /h/ in phrase-initial position:
*&quot;sáapa&quot; &quot;what&quot; &gt; [háapa]
*&quot;sapée&quot; &quot;who&quot; &gt; [hapée]

Sonorants voiced /m/ and /n/ have three allophones: &quot;w&quot; and &quot;l&quot; intervocalically, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; word initially and following an obstruent, and &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; in all other conditions. In conservative speech, &quot;l&quot; is realized as a tapped &quot;r&quot;, however in general cases it is realized as &quot;l&quot;, perhaps due in part to the influence of English. Word initially, &quot;b&quot; is optional for /m/, though &quot;b&quot; is more commonly realized. The glottal sonorant /h/ assimilates to the nasality of the following segment, but retains its voicelessness. When following &quot;i&quot; or &quot;e&quot; or preceding &quot;ch&quot;, /h/ may be realized as an alveopalatal fricative.

===Structure===
Vowel sequences across morpheme boundaries can be quite varied, but short vowels cannot appear alone in the morpheme: V:V (long+short), V:V: (long+long) and diphthong+V (short). Word finally, only &quot;a&quot; (in a diphthong), &quot;o&quot;, and &quot;u&quot; (allomorphs of the plural suffix) can occur after a long vowel.

A wide variety of consonant clusters can occur in Crow. All consonants except for /h/ can be geminated. Voiced labials and dentals (phonemic &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, allophones &quot;b&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;w&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;l&quot;) are resistant to clustering. Because they only occur intervocalically, &quot;l&quot; and &quot;w&quot; do not occur in clusters. The plosive allophones &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; only occur in clusters as the second consonant and only at morpheme boundaries. The nasal allophones &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; can only occur with each other with the exception of &quot;nm&quot;, or occur with &quot;h&quot; at a morpheme boundary. Clusters in general occur at morphemic boundaries.

Some morphemic constraints:
*A word begins either with a V (long or short) or a single C; no word-initial consonant clusters
*Consonant clusters only occur word-internally; exception: &quot;sht&quot; as a single morpheme is an emphatic sentence-final declarative marker.
*A word can end in any C except for &quot;p&quot; and &quot;x&quot;; &quot;ch&quot; only occurs in one word (&quot;iach&quot;) as a plural demonstrative
*All lexical nouns and verb stems end in a vowel
*Generally, nonderived noun and verb stems consist of between 1-4 syllables.
*Only V: or diphthongs occur in one-syllable word

===Stress===
Stress in Crow is phonemic. The position of the stress in the stem is determined lexically. Virtually all noun and verb stems have an inherent stress. In word initial syllables, accented short vowels in a word initial syllable are generally followed by a consonant cluster, while accented long vowels are generally followed by a single consonant. Stress can fall on short vowels as well as long vowels and may fall on either mora of a long vowel. With diphthongs, either the long vowel or the offglide may bear the stress.

Stress helps predict the tones of all the vowels in a word: stressed vowels are high in pitch; all vowels following the stressed vowel are low in pitch; all short vowels preceding the stressed vowel are low in pitch; all long vowels preceding the stressed vowel are high in pitch; short vowels occurring between a long vowel and the accented vowel assimilate to a high pitch.

In words composed of more than one morpheme, there are several rules (with a few exceptions) to determine the placement of the stress:
*If the first stressed morpheme is stressed anywhere except for the final mora of a stem-final vowel, the subsequent morpheme is unstressed.
*If the first stressed morpheme has its accent of the stem-final vowel mora, that morpheme loses its stress.
*If the morpheme following the first stress lacks lexical stress, the stress remains on the first morpheme.
*If a stress stem-final vowel is deleted when the following morpheme lacks lexical stress, the stress is transferred to the preceding vowel mora of the deleted vowel.

Exceptions:
*A few stems with final falling accent have long high stress for the purposes of word formation.
*The punctual aspectual marker &quot;áhi&quot; overrides the regular word accent - it is always accented
*The exclamative sentence-final marker &quot;wík&quot; is stressed in addition to the stress of the stem to which it is combined. Vowel morae that occur between the first stress and the exclamative suffix are low in pitch.

===Phonological processes===
Phonological processes in Crow include:
*short vowel deletion: stem-final short vowels are deleted at a morpheme boundary unless a three-consonant cluster or a nasal plus voiceless obstruent would occur. Stem-final vowels do not delete before &quot;dak&quot;, the coordinate noun-phrase conjunction. Sentence-final evidential suffixes also do not cause the final short vowel to be deleted.
*nasal assimilation: &quot;n&quot; assimilates to &quot;m&quot; in a cluster; &quot;nm&quot; clusters do not occur.
*sibilant assimilation: alveolar &quot;s&quot; and &quot;ss&quot; are realized as /sh/ at morpheme boundaries before all consonants except &quot;x&quot; and &quot;s&quot;.
*vowel neutralization: word-finally, stem-final short vowels &quot;i&quot;, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;u&quot; are neutralized to their corresponding mid nonround or round vowel: &quot;i&quot;, &quot;a&quot; become &quot;e&quot;; &quot;u&quot; becomes &quot;o&quot;.
*identical vowel reduction: with suffixes beginning with &quot;a&quot;, sequences of 3-4 identical vowel morae are reduced to two (&quot;aa-a&quot; and &quot;aa-aa&quot; are reduced to &quot;aa&quot;); exceptions are compounds and prefixes.
*long vowel reduction before &quot;h&quot;: long vowels shorten before &quot;h&quot; in a syllable coda.
*final schwa deletion: the final schwa of a diphthong is deleted before suffixes beginning with &quot;a&quot; and before the plural; before other vowels, it is otherwise retained.
*palatal-dental alternation: stem-final &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are complementary; &quot;t&quot; occurs before &quot;a&quot;-initial suffixes and plural &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;ch&quot; everywhere else. This relations holds parallel for &quot;š&quot; - &quot;s&quot;; and geminates &quot;čč&quot; and &quot;šš&quot;. The &quot;č&quot; and &quot;š&quot; alternates occur before nonlow vowels, whereas &quot;t&quot; and &quot;s&quot; occur before low vowels. There are, however, a few exceptions to this complementary relationship, therefore these phonemes cannot be considered as allophones.
*palatal-velar alternation: there is a lexically conditioned &quot;č&quot; to &quot;k&quot; alternation; &quot;k&quot; occurs before the plural and before suffixes beginning with &quot;a&quot;, not producing &quot;t&quot;.
*stem ablaut: lexically conditioned alternation affecting stem-final long vowels triggered by the plural morphemes, the imperative, and &quot;a&quot;-initial suffixes. (&quot;ii&quot; to &quot;aa&quot; ablaut; &quot;ee&quot; to &quot;ii&quot; ablaut; &quot;ee&quot; to &quot;aa&quot; ablaut.

==Morphology==
Crow is a polysynthetic language.

===Nominal morphology===
Basic stems consist of one to four syllables (with four being rare) and always end in a vowel. Monosyllabic stems have long vowels or diphthongs, e.g., &quot;bií&quot;, &#x27;stone, rock&#x27;; &quot;bía&quot;, &#x27;woman&#x27;. The vast majority of nouns in Crow are derived stems. Derivational processes in nominal morphology include affixation and compounding.

====Suffixes====
An exhaustive list of nominal suffixes:
* - &#x27;approximative&#x27;: follows a stem-final short vowel, follows a stem-final long vowel. Marks resemblance or similarity: &#x27;kind of, sort of, like, (temporal) around the time of.&#x27;
* - &#x27;real, true; very&#x27;
* - &#x27;diminutive&#x27;: Can add the diminutive meaning &#x27;small, little&#x27; or the endearing, affectionate meaning &#x27;dear&#x27; according to the semantics of the noun.
* - &#x27;sportive, imitative&#x27;: Marks resemblance or imitation.
* - &#x27;real, genuine&#x27;: Marks an object&#x27;s reality, its genuineness. Often reduced to &quot;táali&quot;.
* - &#x27;here and there&#x27;: Most commonly occurs with verbs, though occasionally is attached to nouns.
* - &#x27;even&#x27;: Marks concessive subordinate clauses as &#x27;although, even though, even if.&#x27; Also occurs as a noun suffix glossed as &#x27;even.&#x27; &quot;Htaa&quot; is a rare suffix that combines with the bare nominal stem of the noun.

====Prefixes====
Prefixes will render a relative clause into a derived noun.
* - &#x27;agent nominalizer&#x27;: creates agentive nouns (ex. &#x27;singer&#x27;, &#x27;dancer&#x27;) from active verbs or verbs plus incorporated objects.
* - &#x27;locative, temporal, or manner nominalizer&#x27;: &#x27;where, when, how&#x27; derived from verbs or verbs plus incorporated nouns. In some cases, &quot;ala&quot; may follow the noun creating a lexicalized relative clause.
* - &#x27;indefinite nominalizer&#x27;: Derived from stative verbs, inalienably possessed nouns plus stative verbs, active transitive verbs, and from active intransitive verbs.
* - &#x27;instrumental nominalizer&#x27;: Derived from active transitive and intransitive verbs, and from transitive verbs plus incorporated nouns.
* - &#x27;depossessivizer&#x27;: Allows an inalienably possessed noun to occur without a possessor.

====Compounding====
There are two basic types of compounding in Crow: noun-noun compounds and noun-verb compounds.

Noun-noun compounds often involve a whole-part relationship: the first noun refers to the whole and the second to the part. Members of the compound may also be themselves compounds or derived nouns.

Noun-verb compounds consist of a noun plus a stative verb. There are a number of select exceptions.

====Possession====
Nouns are classified as either inalienably or alienably possessed, according to which possessive markers they occur with.

Inalienably possessed nouns are those that are inherently possessed or nondetachable associations, specifically body parts and family members, opposed to alienably possessed nouns whose entity is not inherently possessed. This rule is not absolute as some body parts and kin nouns can be considered alienable and some nouns with close associations to its possessor (i.e., &#x27;his house&#x27;, &#x27;her dog&#x27;) can be considered inalienable.

The affixed possession paradigm for inalienable and alienable possessives can be derived. The alienable possessives only use the first consonant of the alienable prefixes and do not mark the possessor when the prefix begins with a vowel. The final suffix transforms into a diphthong from /-o/.

====Personal names====
Personal names constitute a distinct morphological class of nouns in Crow. They are marked with the definite determiner suffix /sh/, which attaches to the stem rather than to the citation form.

====Pronouns====
Crow has three pronominal forms: bound; emphatic and contrastive; and interrogative-indefinite pronouns. With the first two types, there is a correlation between morphology and syntax. Argument pronouns are generally bound whereas emphatic and contrastive pronouns are generally independent. Bound pronominals function as direct and oblique arguments.

*A-set pronominals mark only subjects of active verbs, both transitive and intransitive.
*B-set pronominals mark subjects of stative verbs, direct objects, and objects of postpositions.

Bound Pronominal Stems:

===Verbal morphology===
Verbal derivational morphology is composed of prefixes, suffixes, one infix (&quot;chi&quot;, &#x27;again; possessive reflexive&#x27;) and reduplication, which expresses an &quot;iterative, distributive, or intensive sense to the meaning of the stem.&quot;

====Active–stative verbs====
The morphological verb classes in Crow mirror a semantic distinction: Crow is an active–stative language, meaning that the subject of an active verb is treated differently than the subject of a stative verb. Active verbs and stative verbs are marked with distinct sets of pronominal affixes: the &quot;A-set&quot; for active verbs and the &quot;B-set&quot; for stative verbs.

Active verbs may have one, two, or three arguments (making them respectively intransitive, transitive, or ditransitive). An intransitive verb takes a subject (SV), a transitive verb takes a subject and an object (SOV) and a ditransitive verb takes a subject and two objects (SO1O2V). In a relative clause built on an active verb, when the subject of the verb is the head of the relative clause and it is an animate noun phrase, it is marked by &quot;ak&quot;.

Stative verbs may have zero (impersonal), one, or two arguments. In a relative clause, the subject of a stative verb is marked with &quot;m&quot; or in elevated discourse, &quot;dak&quot;. There may also be an absence of marking on the head noun where the entire relative clause is marked with the indefinite nonspecific determiner &quot;m&quot;.

====Verb chain====
Crow has a fairly complex ordering of verb phrase constituents. The following table demonstrates simple constructions of active-state intransitive and transitive verbs based on the first person.

*1-4) Active (&quot;A-Set&quot;) pronominals in Crow are very diverse coming in many different forms based on the based bound form. They are patterned by a certain list of lexical and phonological factors, such as the &quot;dú(u) - by hand&quot; pattern which results in a 1sg &quot;bu&quot; and a 2sg &quot;di&quot;, or the &quot;dá(a) - by mouth&quot; pattern which results in a 1sg &quot;ba&quot; and a 2sg &quot;da&quot;.
*2) For Active-Intransitive Causative Verbs, 1-2 person singular causitive (rank 10) is marked by &quot;aa&quot; as in chart, 1-2 person plural is marked by &quot;uu&quot;, 3rd person singular is marked by &quot;ee&quot; or &quot;a&quot; determined lexically, and 3rd person plural is marked by either &quot;uu&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, or &quot;iio&quot; determined lexically.
*4) For Active-Transitive Causative Verbs, the causative transitive verb subject is marked by &quot;wa&quot; in the first person, &quot;la&quot; in the second person and &quot;0&quot; in the third person. The Causative affixes are &quot;hc&quot; (singular) and &quot;hk&quot; (plural).
*Mood in Crow is expressed by a variety of postpositionals. The standard indicative morpheme is &quot;k&quot;.

The verb chain constituents are, of course, much more complicated. Following is a concise list of the rank ordering of each type element:
*Prefixes:

==Syntax==
Crow is a subject–object–verb (SOV) language; it is a verb-final and head marking. In noun phrases, the order is possessor–possessum, with the person marker of the possessor identified by a prefix to the possessum. Subordinate clauses precede matrix clauses, and are marked by a suffixed clause-final marker. Relative clauses are internally headed. Crow has postpositional phrases, with the postposition often occurring as a prefix to the following verb. There is no distinct category of adjectives; instead, stative verbs function as noun phrase modifiers.

Crow is an active–stative language, with verbs divided into two classes, active (both transitive and intransitive) and stative, largely on semantic grounds. This is also often called a &quot;split intransitive&quot; language.

===Noun-phrase syntax===
An analysis of Crow noun phrase syntax under generative grammar has yielded the following rules:

# NP → N&#x27; (DET)
## N&#x27; → N
## N&#x27; → [s...N&#x27; head...] (relative clause)
## N&#x27; → NP N&#x27; (genitive/possessive)
## N&#x27; → PP N&#x27; (PP modifier)
# Q → DP Q (quantifier phrase)
# DP → DEM NP (demonstrative phrase)
# NP → NP NP (appositive)
# NP → S (COMP) (nominalization)
## NP → (NP CONJ)^n (coordinate NP with &quot;dak&quot;)
## NP → (N&#x27; CONJ)^n DET (coordinate N&#x27; with &quot;xxo&quot;)

There are two phrases that are subordinate to the NP (noun-phrase): (1) the DP (demonstrative phrase) and (2) the QP (quantifier phrase).

A noun phrase can be marked as definite or indefinite by a suffixed determiner (DET). The definite suffix is /-sh/ and the indefinite suffix is /-m/.
**&quot;iisáakshee-sh&quot; (definite)
***&#x27;the young man&#x27;
**&quot;bía-m&quot; (indefinite)
***&#x27;a woman&#x27;

The determiner suffix is attached to the final word of the noun phrase, not just the agentive noun.
Relative Clauses: N&#x27; → [s...N&#x27; head...]
Genitive Clauses: N&#x27; → NP N&#x27;
Postpositional Phrases: N&#x27; → PP N&#x27;
Quantifier Phrases: Q → DP Q
There are two classes of quantifiers that are distinguished syntactically. The first class heads a quantifier phrases that takes a demonstrative (or in its stead, a noun phrase) as its complement: &quot;xaxúa&quot;.
The second class is a stative verb that may function as a nominal modifier. This class includes: &quot;ahú&quot; &#x27;many, much&#x27;, &quot;hawa&quot; &#x27;some&#x27;, &quot;kooshtá&quot; &#x27;few&#x27;, &quot;sáawi&quot; &#x27;how many, so many, some&#x27;, and the numerals. This class may also be followed by a determiner. They may also function as clausal predicates.

Demonstrative Phrases: Q → DP Q
Demonstratives are deictic words; in Crow, they occur phrase-initially. They can also cooccur with determiners (ex. &#x27;this the horse&#x27;).

Appositives: NP → NP NP
/ko/ (demonstrative) and /kon/ (appositive) are used to modify each other.
===Relative clauses===
Relative clauses in Crow are complex and subject to theoretical debates. There are two types of relative clauses in Crow: lexically headed and non-lexically headed. There are two basic relativizers /ak/ and /ala/, several composite forms based on &quot;ala&quot; plus &quot;baa&quot; &#x27;indefinite pronoun&#x27; and instances with no relativizer. /ak/ indicates the subject of the relative clause is relativized and marks the subject as animate, and generally agentive. It can occur in both lexically and non-lexically headed clauses. /ala/ may indicate a locative, temporal or manner adverbial is the head of the relative clause. In non-lexically headed relative clauses, /ala/ can sometimes be interpreted as the head of the clause itself. It can also occur in both lexically and non-lexically headed clauses. The relativizers are bound, with many exception, but they are generally prefixed to the word that contains the verb of the relative clause.

Relative clauses are marked with final determiners. If the definite referent of the relative clause has already been accounted in the discourse or is otherwise obvious, the relative clause is marked with the definite /&quot;-sh&quot;/. Relative clauses can also be marked with the indefinite determiner marker /&quot;-m&quot;/; generally this is used to imply that the referent is being introduced into the discourse for the first time. However, the nominal head is almost always marked by the indefinite determiner /&quot;-m&quot;/.

<text>The Killers are an American rock band formed in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2001 by Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboards, bass) and Dave Keuning (lead guitar, backing vocals). After the band went through a number of short-term bassists and drummers, Mark Stoermer (bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion) joined in 2002.

The Killers have released seven studio albums, each of which topped the UK Albums Chart: &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; (2004), &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot; (2006), &quot;Day &amp; Age&quot; (2008), &quot;Battle Born&quot; (2012), &quot;Wonderful Wonderful&quot; (2017), &quot;Imploding the Mirage&quot; (2020), and &quot;Pressure Machine&quot; (2021). They have also released a B-sides and rarities compilation, &quot;Sawdust&quot; (2007); a live album, &quot;Live from the Royal Albert Hall&quot; (2009); two greatest-hits albums, &quot;Direct Hits&quot; (2013) and &quot;Rebel Diamonds&quot; (2023); and a Christmas compilation, &quot;Don&#x27;t Waste Your Wishes&quot; (2016).

Since 2016 and 2017, respectively, Stoermer and Keuning have had extended hiatuses from the band. Stoermer mostly retired from touring, citing both exhaustion and lingering effects from a pyrotechnics accident, while Keuning released a solo album. Despite his hiatus from touring, Stoermer participated in recording sessions for &quot;Wonderful Wonderful&quot; and &quot;Imploding the Mirage&quot;, and it was announced that Keuning was participating in recording &quot;Pressure Machine&quot;, which was released in 2021. Ted Sablay, who had served as a touring keyboardist and rhythm guitarist for the band since 2006, assumed lead guitar duties for live shows in Keuning&#x27;s absence, while touring rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Jake Blanton assumed the role of bassist in live shows. With Sablay moving to lead guitar, the band hired Taylor Milne and Robbie Connolly to play rhythm guitar and keyboards, respectively, live.

The Killers are considered one of the biggest rock bands of the 21st century, selling more than 28 million records worldwide, including 10.8 million in the U.S. They have performed in over 50 countries and on six continents, headlining venues such as Madison Square Garden, Wembley Stadium, Glastonbury Festival (2007 and 2019), and Electric Picnic in Ireland in 2023.

==History==
===2001–2003: Origins and formation===
In 2001, Brandon Flowers was fired by his first band, a synth-pop trio called Blush Response. After attending an Oasis concert at the Hard Rock Hotel during The Tour of Brotherly Love, Flowers realized his calling was to be in a rock band and began searching for like-minded musicians. He eventually came across an ad posted in a Las Vegas newspaper by Dave Keuning, a 25-year-old guitarist who had moved to Las Vegas from Iowa a year earlier. When the pair met, they bonded over similar musical influences and began writing songs together in Keuning&#x27;s apartment. They named their band the Killers because that was the name of a fictional band in the video for the New Order song &quot;Crystal&quot;. In November 2001, they headed to Kill the Messenger Studio in Henderson, Nevada, along with recently recruited drummer Matt Norcross, to record a demo. They recorded two tracks: &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot;, the first song Flowers and Keuning wrote together, and &quot;Desperate&quot;. A month later, they recorded two more, &quot;Under the Gun&quot; and &quot;Replaceable&quot;, with Keuning&#x27;s roommate Dell Neal on bass.

Keuning and Flowers played their first live show together at an open mic night at the Cafe Espresso Roma in Las Vegas in January 2002; the pair, joined by Neal and Norcross, began playing venues around the city where they handed out free copies of their demo. The Killers brought a unique style to the small Vegas music scene, which was dominated by punk, nu metal, and rap bands; one local reviewer wrote, &quot;The Killers, thankfully, don&#x27;t come across like any other band in town&quot;, and described their sound as a mix between the &quot;pop styles of British music and the lo-fi fuzz of modern indie rock&quot;. By the summer of 2002, the Killers, whose early live sound was also described as erratic, had fired Norcross and briefly replaced him with Brian Havens, who was also eventually fired. Bassist Dell Neal later left the band for personal reasons.

Ronnie Vannucci Jr. joined the Killers shortly before Neal&#x27;s departure. Vannucci was well known in the Las Vegas music scene, having played in bands since he was young. He met the Killers in 2002 while he playing in other bands, including Daphne Major and Romance Fantasy. Vannucci&#x27;s first show with the band was on August 30, 2002, at a club called The Junkyard. Playing bass that night was Mark Stoermer, who was at this point the lead guitarist for local progressive rock band the Negative Ponies. The band wanted Stoermer to join them permanently, but he was initially reluctant. They had first approached him to be the second guitarist when they were considering turning the band into a five-piece, &quot;possibly more like the Strokes, with a keyboard&quot;. Stoermer later said he could also play bass. The band had continued as a three-piece, trying out other bassists until November 2002, when Stoermer accepted the invitation to join. According to Ryan Pardey, who booked many of the band&#x27;s early shows, &quot;They became a great band when Ronnie and Mark joined. That&#x27;s when they finally became a cohesive unit. What Ronnie did — he was the discipline — and Mark was just a solid musician.&quot;
While walking through a Virgin Megastore in Las Vegas in 2002, Flowers noticed the album artwork on the then-new Elvis Presley compilation album &quot;ELV1S: 30 No. 1 Hits&quot;. This inspired him to use a marquee sign motif as the band&#x27;s logo. The band hired Vannucci&#x27;s roommate&#x27;s girlfriend to design it, and the logo has been used in the band&#x27;s branding, releases, promotional materials, and merchandise ever since.

The four members worked on song ideas in Vannucci&#x27;s garage. They also sneaked into the band room at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (where Vannucci was studying classical percussion) at night to practice. During this period, the band wrote much of its debut album, &quot;Hot Fuss&quot;, including the hit singles &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot; and &quot;Smile Like You Mean It&quot;. The band continued playing at small venues around Las Vegas, often playing Sunday nights at the transgender bar Sasha&#x27;s (later renamed Tramps). They caught the attention of Braden Merrick, an A&amp;R rep for Warner Bros. Records who had come across their demo on a website dedicated to unsigned bands in the Las Vegas area; after attending a live show he offered to help the band find a record deal, and eventually became their manager. He took the band to Berkeley, California, to record demos with former Green Day manager Jeff Saltzman. They sent the demo tapes to major U.S. record labels. The band was invited to perform at a number of showcases but was not signed. But the band caught the eye of Alex Gilbert, an A&amp;R rep from the United Kingdom. Gilbert took a demo with him to the UK and showed it to his friend Ben Durling, who worked at the newly formed Independent label Lizard King Records. Despite not meeting the band in person, Lizard King offered the band a deal based on the strength of the five song demo. The Killers signed with the British label in July 2003.

===2003–2005: &quot;Hot Fuss&quot;===
On August 19, 2003, the song &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; premiered on DJ Zane Lowe&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio 1 – Zane Lowe Tracklistings: 19/08/2003&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Killers traveled to London the following month to spend a week playing at live music venues across the city. On September 29, 2003, the song &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; was released in the UK on a limited number of CDs and vinyl records. Critical reviews of both the song and the shows were positive: &quot;NME&quot; noted the band&#x27;s retro sound, commenting &quot;The Killers steal so smartly, and with such mind-boggling variety&quot;. As a result of the buzz generated in the UK, a number of major labels in the US began showing strong interest in the band and they were invited to play at the ASCAP CMJ Music Marathon in New York City. They eventually signed with the record label Island Def Jam.

The band finished recording &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; in November 2003 with Jeff Saltzman. They decided to keep many of the previously recorded demos as they felt they had a spontaneity that re-recordings would not have. Shortly afterwards they returned to London, having been invited to support British Sea Power on their UK tour. The band also worked with Alan Moulder at Eden Studios and Townhouse Studios mixing tracks for their upcoming album. They continued playing support slots during the first half of 2004, including touring both the US &amp; UK with Stellastarr and opening for Morrissey on two occasions. The band filmed their first music video for the Spring 2004 release of &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot; which was to be the band&#x27;s debut single in the US and second single in the UK. The band&#x27;s first headline tour started in the UK in May 2004. During the spring and summer of 2004, the group played well-received sets at festivals across Europe and North America.
The Killers released their debut album &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; on June 7, 2004, in the United Kingdom on Lizard King Records and a week later in the United States on Island Records. The track listing differed depending on territory, in the UK and Australia &quot;Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll&quot; replaces &quot;Change Your Mind&quot; as track eight. Upon release &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics. Extensive touring and the success of the Grammy Award nominated singles &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot;, &quot;All These Things That I&#x27;ve Done&quot; and &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; led to the album becoming a commercial success. &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; reached number one in the UK in January 2005, seven months after its release, and has been certified 7× Platinum in both the UK and Ireland. It went on to spend more weeks on the UK Albums chart than any other album that decade, 173 weeks in total. In the US, the album reached its peak position of number seven in April 2005 and has been certified 3× Platinum. It reached the top spot in Australia in March 2005, where it was certified 3× Platinum. It has also been certified 3× Platinum in Canada, Platinum in New Zealand and Gold in Argentina, Belgium, Germany and France. &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; has been downloaded 3.7 million times in the United States and certified Diamond.

The Killers were named the World&#x27;s Best Selling New Group at the 2005 World Music Awards. The same year they won the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist and were also nominated for three Grammy Awards with &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; being nominated for Best Rock Album. In the UK, they picked up an NME Award for Best International Band. The band was recognized by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as the &quot;best-selling new rock band of the past year&quot; in June 2005. Lead singer Brandon Flowers had also gained media attention, being named both Sexiest and Best Dressed Man at the NME Awards, he had also caused controversy due to some outspoken views on other bands.

In July 2005, the Killers performed on the London stage of the Live 8 concert, playing &quot;All These Things That I&#x27;ve Done&quot;. Robbie Williams incorporated the song&#x27;s refrain &quot;I&#x27;ve got soul but I&#x27;m not a soldier&quot; into his own performance. Coldplay and U2 followed suit and, at their separate concerts played in Las Vegas, with the Killers in the crowd, incorporated the line into their songs &quot;God Put a Smile Upon Your Face&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, respectively.

The band fired manager Braden Merrick in 2006. Merrick later filed a lawsuit against the band for breach of contract and their new manager and lawyer, Robert Reynolds, for $16 million each. The band counter sued, citing that Merrick&#x27;s poor management had cost them millions. The case was settled in 2009.

===2006–2007: &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot; and &quot;Sawdust&quot;===
Shortly after finishing touring for Hot Fuss, the Killers headed back into the studio to start recording their second studio album with producers Alan Moulder and Flood, who were working together for the first time in a decade. &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot; was mostly recorded at Studio at the Palms in Las Vegas, with finishing touches added to the album at Criterion Studios, London in June 2006. Upon completion of the album, Flowers claimed he felt the band had made &quot;one of the best albums of the past twenty years&quot; and that he wanted the album to capture &quot;everything important that got me to where I am today&quot;. In July 2006, the lead single &quot;When You Were Young&quot; was premiered and it became a hit, gaining another two Grammy Award nominations and mostly positive reviews with many bringing attention to the influence of heartland rock on the song.
The Killers&#x27; second album, &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot;, was released in October 2006 under Island Def Jam Music Group. It received a varied response with some critics praising the album and the evolution of the band and others criticizing and mocking it, most notably it received a scathing review from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The album sold over 706,000 copies worldwide in the first week of release, reaching number two on the US Billboard chart and number one on the UK chart. The album has since been certified 5× Platinum in the United Kingdom; 4× Platinum in Ireland; 2× Platinum in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand; Platinum in the United States and Gold in Argentina, Belgium, Germany, and Russia.

The Killers recorded a live session at Abbey Road Studios for &quot;Live from Abbey Road&quot; on November 29, 2006. They performed an almost totally unplugged set, which included stripped back versions of the album&#x27;s title track &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot;, &quot;When You Were Young&quot; and a rendition of the Dire Straits hit &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. In December 2006, the band released a Christmas charity song, &quot;A Great Big Sled&quot;, which benefited Product Red. This has since become an annual tradition. 

In February 2007, the Killers attended the BRIT Awards in the United Kingdom, where they performed &quot;When You Were Young&quot;. The band won two awards — Best International Group &amp; International Album. In the same month, the band&#x27;s Tim Burton-directed video for the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Bones&quot;, won Best Video at the NME Awards.

The band recorded the video for the album&#x27;s third single &quot;Read My Mind&quot; in Tokyo, Japan during a break in their Sam&#x27;s Town Tour. The single release was accompanied by a remix of the song by the Pet Shop Boys. Due to high ticket demand, the Killers began headlining arenas including Madison Square Garden for the first time and also headlined a number of major European festivals during 2007, including Glastonbury Festival.

, the Killers have sold 5.3 million copies of both &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; and &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot;.

The band released a compilation album called &quot;Sawdust&quot;, containing B-sides from the band&#x27;s first two albums, rarities, and unreleased material in November 2007. &quot;Sawdust&quot; has been classified Platinum in the UK. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Tranquilize&quot;, a collaboration with Lou Reed, was released in October 2007. The album also featured a cover of &quot;Shadowplay&quot; by Joy Division which was recorded for the soundtrack to the Anton Corbijn directed biopic &quot;Control&quot;.

===2007–2011: &quot;Day &amp; Age&quot; and hiatus===

The band enlisted Stuart Price to produce their third studio album, he had previously remixed their songs under his &quot;Jacques Lu Cont&quot; moniker, the most notable being the remix of &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot;. They first met Price at his London home in 2007 to discuss the possibility of him producing some unreleased tracks for their b-sides album Sawdust, however that same night they ended up in Price&#x27;s home studio recording a demo of &quot;Human&quot; a new song that would become the eventual lead single from &quot;Day &amp; Age&quot;. The band took six months apart following the completion of their Sam&#x27;s Town tour, during this period they would send song ideas between each other and Price via Logic Pro. The band finished recording the album with Price at the band&#x27;s newly acquired Battle Born Studios in Las Vegas.

&quot;Human&quot; was released in October 2008 with Flowers describing the song as &quot;Johnny Cash meets the Pet Shop Boys&quot;. The song became a hit worldwide. The lyric &quot;Are we human, or are we dancer?&quot; confused listeners, due to its grammar and ambiguity. Flowers explained that the line was inspired by a Hunter S. Thompson quote where he stated America was raising &quot;a generation of dancers&quot;. It has since been voted by one poll as the most confusing song lyric of all time.
The Killers&#x27; third album, &quot;Day &amp; Age&quot;, was released on November 18, 2008. Flowers stated that &quot;Day &amp; Age&quot; was &quot;like looking at Sam&#x27;s Town from Mars&quot;, the band have called it their &quot;most playful record&quot; with the album making use of saxophones, steel drums, harpsichord, and tribal chanting. The album also saw the band write some of their most personal and challenging lyrics to date. Closing track &quot;Goodnight, Travel Well&quot; was written about the death of Keuning&#x27;s mother, while &quot;A Dustland Fairytale&quot; was written as a tribute to frontman Flowers&#x27; parents, his mother had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. &quot;Day &amp; Age&quot; became the band&#x27;s third studio album to reach number one in both the UK and Ireland, it reached number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. It has also been certified 4× Platinum in the UK and Ireland, Platinum in Germany, Australia, New Zealand and Canada and Gold in the US, Mexico, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Switzerland, Greece and the Middle East.
The band embarked on the Day &amp; Age World Tour, during which they performed on every continent and headlined US festivals Lollapalooza and Coachella for the first time. The tour was named one of the top 50 worldwide concert tours of 2009. On July 5–6, 2009 at the Royal Albert Hall, London the Killers recorded their first live DVD, &quot;Live from the Royal Albert Hall&quot;. It was released in November and played at various cinemas across the globe. &quot;Live from the Royal Albert Hall&quot; was certified 2× Platinum in the UK, Platinum in the US and Australia and Gold in Ireland and Brazil.

In January 2010, the band announced that they would take a short break after being on the road for the better part of six years. The break lasted for about a year and a half, during which band members devoted themselves on solo projects, while the band made sporadic other contributions. In late February 2010, Flowers&#x27; mother died from brain cancer. This resulted in the cancellation of dates in Asia. Two Australian dates in Sydney and Perth were also cancelled; however, both the Gold Coast and Melbourne concerts went ahead, with the Day &amp; Age tour finally coming to a close in Melbourne on February 21 when the Killers were the headline act of the Good Vibrations Festival at Flemington Racecourse.

===2011–2013: Return and &quot;Battle Born&quot;===
The band returned to the stage in 2011 when they headlined the new International Lollapalooza Festival in Santiago, Chile on April 2, 2011. They also performed at the season closing Top of the Mountain concert in Ischgl, Austria on April 30, 2011. They headlined Hard Rock Calling for the second time in Hyde Park, London on June 24, 2011. The Killers were also the inaugural headliner of the new Orlando Calling Festival in Orlando, Florida on November 12, 2011.
The band headed back into the studio to record their fourth studio album in 2011, during the recording they worked with five producers Steve Lillywhite, Damian Taylor, Brendan O&#x27;Brien, Stuart Price and Daniel Lanois. In June 2012, a short trailer was released on the Killers VEVO page, revealing the album&#x27;s name &quot;Battle Born&quot;, named after the flag of Nevada. This was followed by the release of lead single &quot;Runaways&quot; in July. That same month, they headlined Saturday night at the inaugural Firefly Music Festival in Dover, Delaware.

The Killers&#x27; fourth studio album &quot;Battle Born&quot; was released on September 18, 2012. The album became the Killers&#x27; fourth consecutive No. 1 album in the UK and Ireland and has been certified Platinum in the UK and Gold in Ireland, Mexico and Australia. The band&#x27;s Battle Born World Tour was their most widespread yet, with the band visiting new territories including Russia and China. The tour was named the 43rd highest grossing worldwide during 2013. On June 22, 2013, the band played their biggest show to date at the 90,000 capacity Wembley Stadium; the band performed a song specifically written for the occasion. Reviews of the show were positive. The band once again headlined festivals across Europe, Australia, South America &amp; North America. In October 2013 the Killers headlined the inaugural Life Is Beautiful Festival in hometown Las Vegas, concluding their Battle Born World Tour.

===2013–2016: &quot;Direct Hits&quot;===
On September 11, 2013, the band tweeted a picture, which contained six lines of Morse code. The code was translated to &quot;The Killers Shot at the Night&quot;. On September 16, 2013, exactly ten years to the day of their first show in London, the Killers released &quot;Shot at the Night&quot; which was produced by Anthony Gonzalez. It was also revealed that they would be releasing their first greatest hits compilation, &quot;Direct Hits&quot; released on November 11, 2013. The album featured songs from all four studio albums, the new single &quot;Shot at the Night&quot; and another new song &quot;Just Another Girl&quot;. The release of &quot;Direct Hits&quot; was followed by a short promotional tour, the band also played a number of festivals in 2014.

The band headlined the opening night of the new T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip on April 6, 2016, the band were joined during their set by a number of guests including &quot;Mr. Las Vegas&quot; Wayne Newton and the Blue Man Group. On May 24, 2016, the band announced that Mark Stoermer was taking a break from touring, In Stoermer&#x27;s absence touring keyboardist/guitarist Jake Blanton moved to bass guitar. On September 30 and October 1, 2016, the band (including Stoermer) celebrated the tenth anniversary of their second album, &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot;, by playing two nights at the Sam&#x27;s Town Hotel and Gambling Hall, which the album was named after. For these shows, they played the album in full from start to finish. The band contributed a track titled &quot;Mixed Signals&quot; to Robbie Williams&#x27; eleventh studio album, &quot;The Heavy Entertainment Show&quot;, released in November 2016.

=== 2017–2018: &quot;Wonderful Wonderful&quot; ===
The Killers released their fifth studio album, &quot;Wonderful Wonderful&quot;, on September 22, 2017. The album was produced by Jacknife Lee and lead single &quot;The Man&quot; was released on June 14, 2017.
 Before the album&#x27;s release the band headed to Europe for a number of summer festival dates, including an unannounced set at Glastonbury Festival, where Stoermer joined them to perform on the John Peel Stage, the same stage they had performed on during their first appearance at the festival 13 years earlier. The run of shows concluded with a sold-out headline performance at the British Summer Time festival in London&#x27;s Hyde Park.
On August 6, 2017, it was announced that Dave Keuning was going on an indefinite hiatus from the band, citing exhaustion from a grueling tour schedule and a desire to spend more time with his son.

The Killers released a statement on August 28, 2017, confirming that neither Stoermer nor Keuning would participate in the band&#x27;s upcoming Wonderful Wonderful World Tour, while reiterating that both are still members of the band. Jake Blanton would continue to fill in for Stoermer while touring guitarist/keyboardist Ted Sablay would fill in for Keuning. The band added another two touring musicians: keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Robbie Connolly and rhythm/lead guitarist Taylor Milne, a member of Big Talk, Vannucci&#x27;s project.

The band headlined the 2017 AFL Grand Final in Melbourne, Australia, on September 30, 2017. Following the conclusion of the game, the band also headlined a free concert at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and earned praise for their performance. They also welcomed onstage Jack Riewoldt, a fan and a vice-captain of the Richmond side that had been victorious against Adelaide in the Grand Final, to perform &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; with them.

&quot;Wonderful Wonderful&quot; became the band&#x27;s first album to reach the number one spot on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; it also claimed the top spot on the UK Album Chart, making the Killers the first international act to have their first five studio albums reach number one in the UK.
In May 2018, Flowers told the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; that he wanted to make another album with the band. In October 2018, guitarist Dave Keuning told &quot;NME&quot; that the band was in the early stages of the next album, though he wasn&#x27;t sure how big a role he would have in its creation process.

On January 14, 2019, the band released the standalone track, &quot;Land of the Free&quot;, the official music video for which was directed by Spike Lee. It was announced that the Killers would be performing at Woodstock 50, though Woodstock 50 was canceled after a series of permit and production issues, venue relocations, and artist cancellations.

=== 2019–2020: &quot;Imploding the Mirage&quot; ===
On November 15, 2019, the Killers announced their 6th studio album titled &quot;Imploding the Mirage&quot; for a Spring 2020 release. On that day, the band also announced a UK and Ireland stadium tour to take place in May and June 2020. On March 12, 2020, the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Caution&quot; was released featuring a solo by Lindsey Buckingham. Lindsey Buckingham said of the band, &quot;There&#x27;s such a strong center to what they&#x27;re doing. Their material is so well crafted that it cuts across a lot of generational lines.&quot; It was also confirmed by Flowers that Keuning did not participate in recording the album and that he will still not be touring with the band. On April 25, 2020, &quot;Caution&quot; reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Alternative Songs chart, setting a record of 13 years and 6 months since the band&#x27;s last number-one song on the chart.

In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published on May 5, 2020, Flowers and Vannucci stated that while Keuning is on hiatus from the band and that they had difficulties in working on the new album without him, he is still welcome to return to the Killers. They also stated that although Stoermer&#x27;s role in the band continues to be limited due to pyro-inflicted hearing damage suffered during a past show in London, he is still close with Flowers and Vannucci, was involved in the recording of the album, and is expected to play select live shows once touring resumes. On July 15, 2020, the band released the music video of their new album second single &quot;My Own Soul&#x27;s Warning&quot; and stated the album would be released on August 21, 2020.

=== 2020–2021: &quot;Pressure Machine&quot; and Keuning&#x27;s return ===
On the weekend of &quot;Imploding the Mirage&quot;&#x27;s release, Flowers revealed that the band was currently in the studio working on their seventh studio album: &quot;You know when someone makes a record and they say that they have fifty songs and they&#x27;re going to release another record? Well, we really are! We&#x27;re going to release another one in about ten months. We&#x27;ve already gone back into the studio with [producers Jonathan] Rado and Shawn [Everett]. I&#x27;m excited. It might be better than [&quot;Imploding the Mirage&quot;].&quot; The band revealed in 22 December a provisional &quot;A-List&quot; of &quot;apparent song titles on social media, sparking speculation that another new album could be on the way&quot;. In January 2021, Dave Keuning reunited with the band in the studio to record their 7th album. Keuning also said that he and Mark Stoermer are open to playing live with the band. During a podcast interview in June, Vannucci revealed that the album would be released in August.

Earlier in 2021, the band moved performance rights management from ASCAP to Irving Azoff-owned performance rights organization Global Music Rights.

On June 10, 2021 Bruce Springsteen announced an upcoming collaboration with the Killers. Later that day the Killers&#x27; social media announced the remake of &quot;A Dustland Fairytale&quot; retitled &quot;Dustland&quot; after a series of teases by the band throughout the day.

As it was announced on July 19, 2021, the band&#x27;s seventh album, entitled &quot;Pressure Machine&quot;, was released on August 13, 2021. Mark Stoermer remained absent due to difficulties presented by the COVID-19 Pandemic during recording and did not make it to the studio. &quot;Pressure Machine&quot; debuted at No. 1. on the Official U.K. Albums Chart, snagging the band&#x27;s seventh U.K. No. 1.

=== 2021–present: Aborted eighth album, &quot;Rebel Diamonds&quot;, and &quot;Bright Lights&quot;===
In June 2021, Keuning confirmed that the band had begun working on their eighth album, for which Flowers alluded to an early 2023 release in July 2022.

In March 2022, the band released a deluxe edition of &quot;Pressure Machine&quot;. The next month they kicked off their Imploding the Mirage tour with three nights at the Chelsea Ballroom in the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. Bassist Mark Stoermer was still absent, his part covered on tour by Jake Blanton, but Stoermer was reportedly interested in recording the band&#x27;s next album, their eighth.

On July 8, 2022, the band unveiled their upcoming single &quot;Boy&quot; during their performance at Mad Cool Festival in Madrid. The song was written during the &quot;Pressure Machine&quot; recording sessions but didn&#x27;t fit the album&#x27;s aesthetic. During an interview with &quot;NME&quot; Flowers confirmed they have been working on their eighth album, stating there would be more single releases in 2022 leading to the album&#x27;s release early 2023.

On August 15, 2023, the band performed at the Black Sea Arena in Shekvetili, Georgia. During a performance of the song &quot;For Reasons Unknown&quot;, the band attracted controversy as they invited a fan, who happened to be Russian, from the crowd on stage to help them perform the song. This was followed by booing by some parts of the crowd. The band&#x27;s lead singer Brandon Flowers tried to defuse the tensions by saying that all Killers fans are &quot;brothers and sisters&quot;. Some parts of the audience left in protest. The band later shared an apology on their social media, saying that they did not want to insult anyone and their message about friendship was misconstrued amid the political tensions between Russia and Georgia and the occupation of Georgian territories by Russia. Later that month, Flowers confirmed that the eighth album had been scrapped due to his dissatisfaction with its direction, stating &quot;I don’t think you’ll see us making this type of music any more.&quot;

On December 8, 2023, the band released its second greatest hits compilation, &quot;Rebel Diamonds&quot;, which included three songs from the aborted eighth studio album: &quot;Boy&quot;, &quot;Your Side of Town&quot; and &quot;Spirit&quot;. On December 25, the band previewed a fourth new song, named &quot;We Did It in the Name of Love,&quot; which remained otherwise unreleased.
In August 2024, the original four-piece of Flowers, Keuning, Stoermer, and Vannucci Jr. reunited for a ten-night Las Vegas concert residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, celebrating the 20th anniversary of &quot;Hot Fuss&quot;. The reunited line-up performed the album in full each night, and recorded a brand new song, &quot;Bright Lights&quot;, to coincide with the residency. The song was the first to feature all four core members since 2017.

<doc id="804242" wikidata="Q7128740" url="?curid=804242" title="Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.">
<text>Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99 (1928), is a leading case in American tort law on the question of liability to an unforeseeable plaintiff. The case was heard by the New York Court of Appeals, the highest state court in New York; its opinion was written by Chief Judge Benjamin Cardozo, a leading figure in the development of American common law and later a United States Supreme Court justice.

The plaintiff, Helen Palsgraf, was waiting at a Long Island Rail Road station in August 1924 while taking her daughters to the beach. Two men attempted to board the train before hers; one (aided by railroad employees) dropped a package that exploded, causing a large coin-operated scale on the platform to hit her. After the incident, she began to stammer, and subsequently sued the railroad, arguing that its employees had been negligent while assisting the man, and that she had been harmed by the neglect. In May 1927 she obtained a jury verdict of $6,000, which the railroad appealed. Palsgraf gained a 3–2 decision in the Appellate Division, and the railroad appealed again. Cardozo wrote for a 4–3 majority of the Court of Appeals, ruling that there was no negligence because the employees, in helping the man board, did not breach any duty of care to Palsgraf as injury to her was not a foreseeable harm from aiding a man with a package. The original jury verdict was overturned, and the railroad won the case.

A number of factors, including the bizarre facts and Cardozo&#x27;s outstanding reputation, made the case prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to most if not all American law students in torts class. Cardozo&#x27;s conception, that tort liability can only occur when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals&#x27; dissenter in &quot;Palsgraf&quot;, Judge William S. Andrews.

==Background==
At the time of the 1928 New York Court of Appeals decision in &quot;Palsgraf&quot;, that state&#x27;s case law followed a classical formation for negligence: the plaintiff had to show that the Long Island Railroad (&quot;LIRR&quot; or &quot;the railroad&quot;) had a duty of care, and that she was injured through a breach of that duty. It was not required that she show that the duty owed was to her. Under New York precedent, the usual duty of utmost care that the railroad as a common carrier owed its customers did not apply to platforms and other parts of the station.

===Facts===

Sunday, August 24, 1924, was a warm summer day in Brooklyn, and Helen Palsgraf, a 40-year-old janitor and housekeeper, was taking her two daughters, Elizabeth and Lillian, aged 15 and 12, to Rockaway Beach. Having paid the necessary fare, they were on the platform at the East New York station of the LIRR on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, when a train, not theirs, pulled in. As it began to move again, two men raced for the train, and one made it without incident, as the doors had not closed. The other, a man carrying a package, leapt aboard, with the help of a platform guard pushing him from behind as a member of the train&#x27;s crew pulled him into the car. But in the process, the man lost the package, which dropped and exploded, for it apparently contained fireworks. Either the force of the explosion or the panicking of those on the platform caused a tall, coin-operated scale to topple onto Helen Palsgraf. No one was hurt enough to spend the night in the hospital, though several people, Palsgraf among them, were listed as injured.

Contemporaneous accounts and witnesses at trial described the man as Italian in appearance, and there was speculation that the package was being taken for use at an Italian-American celebration of some sort; no great effort was made to identify the owner. Palsgraf&#x27;s injury was listed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as shock; she also suffered bruising. The distance between Helen Palsgraf and the explosion was never made clear in the trial transcript, or in the opinions of the judges who ruled on the case, but the distance from the explosion to the scale was described in the &quot;Times&quot; as &quot;more than ten feet away&quot; (3 metres). Several days after the incident, she developed a bad stammer, and her doctor testified at trial that it was due to the trauma of the events at East New York station. She had not recovered from the stammer when the case came to court.

=== Trial ===
Palsgraf brought suit against the railroad in the Supreme Court of New York, Kings County, a trial-level court, in Brooklyn on October 2, 1924. The summons was served the following month, and the defendant filed its answer on December 3. The case was heard on May 24 and 25, 1927, with Justice Burt Jay Humphrey presiding. Humphrey had served for over twenty years on the county court in Queens before unexpectedly being nominated for election to the Supreme Court in 1925; he was noted for his courteous and friendly manner. Manhattan lawyers tried the Brooklyn case: Matthew W. Wood, who worked from 233 Broadway (the Woolworth Building) represented Palsgraf, while Joseph F. Keany, whose office was at Pennsylvania Station, was for the railroad, along with William McNamara. Wood was an experienced solo practitioner with two degrees from Ivy League schools; Keany had headed the LIRR&#x27;s legal department for twenty years—McNamara, who tried the case, was one of the department&#x27;s junior lawyers, who had advanced from clerk to counsel after graduation from law school. At trial, Palsgraf testified that she had been hit in the side by the scale, and had been treated at the scene, and then took a taxicab home. She testified to trembling then for several days, and then the stammering started. Her health forced her to give up her work in mid-1926. Wood called Herbert Gerhardt, an engraver, who had seen the man with the package hurry towards the train, and whose wife had been hit in the stomach in the man&#x27;s rush. He testified that the scale had been &quot;blown right to pieces&quot;.

On the second day of the trial, Wood called Dr. Karl A. Parshall, Palsgraf&#x27;s physician. He testified that he had treated Palsgraf occasionally for minor ailments before the incident at East New York, but on the day after found her shaken and bruised. He gave it as his opinion that Palsgraf&#x27;s ills were caused by the accident. Grace Gerhardt, Herbert&#x27;s wife, was the next witness. She testified to being hit by one of &quot;the two young Italian fellows&quot; who were racing to make the train, and how one made it unaided and the other only with the help of two LIRR employees. She had nothing to say about the scale or Palsgraf, having seen neither. Elizabeth and Lillian Palsgraf, the elder and younger daughter of the plaintiff, were next to testify and spoke of what they had seen. Wood indicated his only remaining witness was a neurologist, an expert witness, and McNamara for the LIRR moved to dismiss the case on the ground that Palsgraf had failed to present evidence of negligence, but Justice Humphrey denied it. The neurologist, Graeme M. Hammond of Manhattan, had examined Palsgraf two days before, observing her stammering, speaking only with difficulty. She told him of depression and headaches. He diagnosed her with traumatic hysteria, for which the explosion was a plausible cause, and said the hysteria was likely to continue as long as the litigation did, for only once it was resolved were the worries connected with it likely to vanish.

Wood rested his case on behalf of the plaintiff; McNamara offered no evidence but again moved to dismiss, which Humphrey denied. The judge told the all-male jury that if the LIRR employees &quot;omitted to do the things which prudent and careful trainmen do for the safety of those who are boarding their trains, as well as the safety of those who are standing upon the platform waiting for other trains, and that the failure resulted in the plaintiff&#x27;s injury, then the defendant would be liable.&quot; The jury was out for two hours and 35 minutes, including the lunch hour, and they awarded Palsgraf $6,000 ($ today). Pursuant to statute, she also recovered costs of $142, an amount added to the verdict. A motion for a new trial was denied on May 27, 1927 by Justice Humphrey, who did not issue a written opinion, and a judgment was entered on the verdict on May 31, from which the LIRR appealed on June 14. Once Palsgraf had gotten her jury verdict, the Gerhardts also sued the railroad, with Wood as their counsel.

William H. Manz, in his article on the facts in &quot;Palsgraf&quot;, suggested that neither side spent much time preparing for trial. Wood did not contact his fact witnesses, the Gerhardts, until shortly before the trial, and Palsgraf was examined by Dr. Hammond the day before the trial started. McNamara, one of the most junior members of the LIRR&#x27;s legal team, called no witnesses, and Manz suggested the entire defense strategy was to get the judge to dismiss the case. In his later book, Judge Richard Posner indicated that the much-sued LIRR did not present a better case than the first-time plaintiff: &quot;it put on a bargain-basement defense&quot;.

=== Initial appeal ===
The LIRR&#x27;s appeal took the case to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, for the Second Department, the state&#x27;s intermediate appeals court. In its briefs before the Appellate Division, the LIRR argued that the verdict had been contrary to the law and the evidence. It stressed that it had no foreknowledge that the package was dangerous, and that no law required it to search the contents of passenger luggage. The brief stated that given this, there was no negligence in helping a man make a train, and even if there was, that negligence was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf&#x27;s injuries. Wood, for Palsgraf, argued that the jury verdict finding negligence was supported by undisputed facts, and should not be questioned by the appellate courts. The plaintiff&#x27;s brief also suggested that the failure of the railroad to call as witnesses the employees who had aided the man should decide any inferences of negligence against it. Wood deemed the trainmen guilty of a &quot;dereliction of duty&quot;, misconduct that was the proximate cause of Palsgraf&#x27;s injuries.

The lawyers argued the case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court&#x27;s judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the majority opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger had been born in Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of &quot;Palsgraf&quot;, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.

Presiding Justice Edward Lazansky (joined by Justice J. Addison Young) wrote a dissent. Lazansky, the son of Czech immigrants, had been elected New York Secretary of State as a Democrat in 1910. Elected to the Supreme Court in 1917, he had been designated presiding justice of the Second Department by Governor Smith earlier in 1927. Lazansky did not question the jury finding of negligence, but felt that the employees&#x27; conduct was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf&#x27;s injuries, since the man&#x27;s conduct in bringing a package that might explode to a crowded passenger station was an independent act of negligence, rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in causation for there to be liability.

== Court of Appeals==

The LIRR was entitled by law to take the case to the New York Court of Appeals (the state&#x27;s highest court) as there had been a dissent in the Appellate Division, and it did. The railroad argued again that Palsgraf had failed to establish that she had come to harm through the railroad&#x27;s negligence: that there was no negligence, and even if there was, that neglect had not harmed Palsgraf, since such injury was not &quot;a natural and probable consequence of assisting a man to board a train&quot;. Its brief alleged that the trainmen could not have stopped the man from boarding, and once he had flung himself onto the train, had little choice but to help him, &quot;faced with such an emergency they cannot be charged with negligence because they elected to assist the man rather than stand idly by and leave him to his fate.&quot; Wood, for his part, argued that negligence had been found by the jury, and by both majority and dissenting justices in the Appellate Division. He wrote that there were many facts from which the jury could have found negligence, including the fact that the train had not shut its doors as it departed (though whether this was to allow latecomers to board or because it was a summer day is uncertain). The case was argued before the Court of Appeals in Albany on February 24, 1928.

=== Cardozo&#x27;s majority opinion ===

The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, Benjamin N. Cardozo, was a judge who was greatly respected; he later became a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. After a standout legal career, Cardozo had been elected to the trial-level Supreme Court in 1913, but was quickly designated by the governor for service on the Court of Appeals. He was in 1917 appointed a judge of that court, and in 1926 was elected chief judge by the voters. In &quot;Palsgraf&quot;, Cardozo wrote for a 4–3 majority of the Court of Appeals, reversing the appellate judgment and directing that the case be decided for the defendant, the LIRR. Cardozo was joined by Judges Cuthbert W. Pound, Irving Lehman and Henry Kellogg.

Despite being the longest statement of the facts in any of the four appellate opinions generated by the case, Cardozo&#x27;s was described by Posner as &quot;elliptical and slanted&quot;. It has also been deemed &quot;highly abstract&quot;. According to Professor Walter O. Weyrauch in his 1978 journal article, &quot;Cardozo&#x27;s famous opinion reduced the complicated facts of the case to a bare minimum. Mrs. Palsgraf was transformed into a &#x27;plaintiff&#x27; without age, family status, or occupation. The opinion omitted the nature of her injury, the amount of damages that she sought, and the size of the jury award.&quot; For example, Cardozo describes Palsgraf (whom he does not name, nor mention her daughters) as standing on the LIRR&#x27;s platform, rather than waiting for a train, thus downplaying her status as a customer entitled to a high degree of care by the railroad. The explosive package is described as small, though the witnesses had described it as large. The scales are described as being &quot;at the other end of the platform, many feet away&quot; from the explosion, but the record does not support this statement. This characterization may have been based on testimony by Lillian Palsgraf, who had gone to buy a paper from a newsstand &quot;at the other end of the platform&quot;, but who was yet close enough to see the package fall. Cardozo&#x27;s characterization of distance would be challenged by the plaintiff in her motion for reargument, which would be denied with the rejoinder that however close she was to the explosion, she was not so close as to bring her within the zone of foreseeable risk.
After the fact pattern, Cardozo began his discussion of the law with &quot;the conduct of the defendant&#x27;s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relative to her it was not negligence at all.&quot; Cardozo quoted &quot;Pollock on Torts&quot; and cited several cases for the proposition that &quot;proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do.&quot; Only if there is a duty to the injured plaintiff, the breach of which causes injury, can there be liability. He defended his decision, &quot;a different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions.&quot; Cardozo posed hypothetical situations: if a railway guard stumbles over a bundle of newspapers, and there are explosives within, will there be liability to an injured passenger at the other end of the platform? Will the result be different if the object containing the explosives is a valise instead? If there was negligence that day, Cardozo argued, it was only negligence that resulted in the fall and destruction of the package, and there was no wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf for personal injury, &quot;the diversity of incidents emphasizes the futility of the effort to build the plaintiff&#x27;s right upon the basis of a wrong to some one else.&quot; The chief judge instructed, &quot;The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed&quot;. Cardozo did not absolve the defendant who knowingly unleashes a destructive force, such as by shooting a gun, just because the bullet takes an unexpected path. This is not such a case, Cardozo held: even if the railway guard had thrown down the package intentionally, without knowing the contents he could not knowingly risk harm to Palsgraf, and would not be liable. Negligence cannot impose liability where an intentional act would not.

Negligence, Cardozo emphasized, derives from human relations, not in the abstract. Negligence that does no one harm is not a tort. It is not enough, he found, to prove negligence by the defendant and damage to the plaintiff; there must be a breach of duty owed to the plaintiff by the defendant. He traced the history of the law of negligence, a concept not known in medieval times, and noted that it evolved as an offshoot of the law of trespass, and one could not sue for trespass to another. Had the railroad been negligent towards Palsgraf, it might have been liable, but &quot;the consequences to be followed must first be rooted in a wrong&quot;, and there was no legal wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf. Thus, the lower courts were incorrect, and must be reversed, and the case dismissed, with Palsgraf to bear the costs of suit.

=== Dissent by Andrews ===
William S. Andrews of Syracuse was a 69-year-old judge, noted for his scholarship, who had been on the Court of Appeals since 1917. The son of Charles Andrews, a former Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, William Andrews is best remembered today because he wrote an opinion in &quot;Palsgraf&quot;. In that dissent, he was joined by Judges Frederick E. Crane and John F. O&#x27;Brien. Andrews began with a brief recitation of facts: that a railroad employee had negligently dislodged the package, the contents of which the trainman was unaware, and the subsequent explosion broke the scale and injured the plaintiff, &quot;an intending passenger&quot;. Andrews noted the fundamental difference among the judges concerning the law of negligence: whether there must be a duty to the plaintiff, the breach of which injured her, and whether, when there is an act that is a threat to the safety of others, the doer of it should be &quot;liable for all its proximate consequences, even where they result in injury to one who would generally be thought to be outside the radius of danger&quot;. Andrews believed that if there was a negligent act, the proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff, that should establish liability.

Andrews found Cardozo&#x27;s reasoning too narrow, and felt that the focus should be on the unreasonable act: driving down Broadway at high speed is negligent whether or not an accident occurs. Such an act is wrong to the public at large, not only to those who might be injured. &quot;Due care is a duty imposed on each one of us to protect society from unnecessary danger, not to protect A, B or C alone ... In an empty world, negligence would not exist. It does involve a relationship between man and his fellows. But not merely a relationship between man and those whom he might reasonably expect his act would injure. Rather, a relationship between him and those whom he does in fact injure. If his act has a tendency to harm some one, it harms him a mile away as surely as it does those on the scene.&quot;

Andrews pointed out that the law allows plaintiffs to recover from defendants who had no duty towards them: orphans may recover for their negligently killed parents; a bereaved person may recover for negligence in the death of a spouse. An insurance company may sue in subrogation and recover the sum paid out from the person who started the fire. &quot;Behind the cloud of words is the fact they hide, that the act, wrongful as to the insured, has also harmed the company.&quot;

An event may have many causes, Andrews noted, and only some may be deemed proximate. Liability for negligence may only be found where that proximate cause exists, a term that the judge admitted was inexact. He suggested the analogy of a river, made up of water from many sources, and by the time it wound to sea, fully intermixed. But for a time, after water from a muddy swamp or a clayey bed joins, its origin may be traced. Beyond a certain point, it cannot be traced, and such is proximate cause, &quot;because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point. This is not logic. It is practical politics.&quot;

That point, beyond which there is no proximate cause, is drawn differently by different judges, and by different courts, Andrews explained. He listed factors that courts might consider, such as remoteness in time or space, and discussed some hypotheticals, such as a chauffeur who causes an accident, the noise of which startles a nursemaid into dropping a child, then returned to the case being decided,

Given that, Andrews concluded, the jury verdict should be upheld. &quot;Under these circumstances I cannot say as a matter of law that the plaintiff&#x27;s injuries were not the proximate result of the negligence. That is all we have before us.&quot;

== Subsequent events ==
Wood, Palsgraf&#x27;s lawyer, moved the Court of Appeals to allow reargument of the case, alleging that Cardozo had confused the position of Palsgraf with that of her daughter Lillian (at the newsstand), and complained about the chief judge&#x27;s use of such terms as &quot;distant&quot; and &quot;far away&quot;. Wood warned that the decision could have far-reaching adverse effects on innocent passengers. The court denied the motion with a one-sentence statement likely written by Cardozo, &quot;If we assume that the plaintiff was nearer the scene of the explosion than the prevailing opinion would suggest, she was not so near that injury from a falling package, not known to contain explosives, would be within the range of reasonable prevision.&quot; Costs of $559.60 were due from Palsgraf to the railroad under Cardozo&#x27;s order. Posner doubted the sum was ever collected, noting that Palsgraf&#x27;s family spoke to legal scholars and periodicals about the case in later years, and never mentioned an attempt to collect what would have been about a year&#x27;s salary for the disabled former janitor.

Helen Palsgraf remained embittered about the loss of her case. She became mute, and developed other health problems prior to her death on October 27, 1945, at the age of 61. At the time of her death, Palsgraf was living in Richmond Hill, Queens with her daughter Elizabeth. Her former attorney, Wood, maintained a law office in the Woolworth Building until his death in 1972 at age 96. His opposing trial counsel, McNamara, remained with the LIRR&#x27;s legal department until his retirement in 1959, while McNamara&#x27;s superior and counsel of record, Keany, continued as the railroad&#x27;s general solicitor until he died in 1935. Justice Humphrey retired in 1936, a year after he gained notoriety for presiding over the marriage of heiress Doris Duke; he died in 1940. Andrews retired at the end of 1928, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 70; he died in 1936. Cardozo was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover and served there until his death in 1938.

After the &quot;Palsgraf&quot; case became prominent among lawyers, having been taught to many of them in law school, members of the family sometimes encountered startled reactions when lawyers learned their last name. Frank Palsgraf, Helen&#x27;s grandson, told in 1978 of &quot;being treated like a celebrity&quot; by a prosecutor when called for jury duty, and causing the judge to reminisce about hard nights studying the case in law school. Nevertheless, the prosecutor struck him from the jury. According to Posner, the later coverage of the family &quot;makes it clear that, with the exception of Mrs. Palsgraf, the Palsgraf family was thrilled by its association with a famous case, notwithstanding the outcome&quot;. In 1991, that association became closer, as Lisa Newell, first cousin four times removed of Judge Cardozo, married Palsgraf&#x27;s great-grandson, J. Scott Garvey.

== Prominence ==
&quot;Palsgraf&quot; came to the attention of the legal world quickly. William L. Prosser of the University of California Law School wrote that the Appellate Division&#x27;s decision fell into the hands of Francis H. Bohlen of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Bohlen was at that time the reporter compiling the first &quot;Restatement of Torts&quot; for the American Law Institute (ALI), and Cardozo was informally one of the advisers. In that task, Bohlen was having difficulty dealing with the concept of duty of care in negligence, especially involving unforeseeable plaintiffs, and Prosser related that Cardozo was treated to a learned discussion by the other advisers of a case that might come before his court and, convinced by the arguments, used them to decide &quot;Palsgraf&quot;. Kaufman doubted this story, which was told to Prosser by Dean Young B. Smith of Columbia, noting that the only meeting of the advisers between the two appeal decisions in &quot;Palsgraf&quot; took place in New York on December 12–13, 1927, beginning only three days after the Appellate Division ruled, and the notes reveal that Cardozo was absent; the chief judge was hearing arguments all that week in Albany. Nevertheless, the discussions and materials from the &quot;Restatement&quot; compilation likely influenced Cardozo in his decision.

Bohlen dwelt heavily upon Cardozo&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Palsgraf&quot; in presenting the Tentative Draft of the &quot;Restatement&quot; to the ALI&#x27;s annual meeting, which approved the section citing &quot;Palsgraf&quot; with little discussion. &quot;Palsgraf&quot; quickly became well known in the legal community, and was cited in many cases, some of dubious relevance. According to Kaufman, &quot;the bizarre facts, Cardozo&#x27;s spin on the legal issue, the case&#x27;s timing in relation to the Restatement project, its adaptability for law-school teaching, the policy-oriented dissent by Andrews, Cardozo&#x27;s rhetoric, and Cardozo&#x27;s name—all these factors combined to make &quot;Palsgraf&quot; a legal landmark.&quot; According to Prosser, writing in his hornbook for law students, &quot;what the Palsgraf case actually did was submit to the nation&#x27;s most excellent state court a law professor&#x27;s dream of an examination question&quot;. But Professor (later Judge) John T. Noonan saw more than this, noting that Cardozo was then the nation&#x27;s most prominent state-court judge: &quot;The excitement of &quot;Palsgraf&quot; was not merely that it was a brilliant examination question; it was an examination question answered by Cardozo.&quot;

The first mentions of &quot;Palsgraf&quot; in law reviews were case notes written by law students, appearing over the course of the year following the decision by the Court of Appeals. Professor Robert L. Goodhart, in the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; in 1930, was at the front of an avalanche of commentary to such an extent that by 1938, Louisiana State University professor Thomas A. Cowan deemed &quot;Palsgraf&quot; &quot;a legal institution&quot;. The case entered the standard legal casebooks, from which law students learn, in the early 1930s, usually to illustrate the necessary connection between defendant&#x27;s misconduct and plaintiff&#x27;s injury in negligence cases. According to Posner, writing in 1990, &quot;&quot;Palsgraf&quot; is now the subject of a large scholarly literature, and is, I believe, the only case reprinted in &quot;all&quot; American casebooks on tort law.&quot; Manz wrote, &quot;everyone who has sat in an American law school torts class can recall the basic facts—the crowded railroad platform, the running men, the dropped package, the explosion, and the falling scale. &quot;Palsgraf&quot; has become a sort of legal &#x27;urban legend&#x27;—an allegedly true, but improbable, tale told and retold to each new class of law students.&quot; Professor W. Jonathan Cardi noted, &quot;in law school classrooms, &#x27;Palsgraf Day&#x27; is often celebrated with food and drink, dramatic reenactments, interpretive poems, and even mock duels between Judges Cardozo and Andrews&quot;.

&quot;Palsgraf&quot; was soon adopted by some state courts, at times in different contexts: Though some state courts outside New York approved it, others did not, sometimes feeling that foreseeability was an issue for the jury to consider. According to Posner, writing in 1990, Cardozo&#x27;s holding that there is no liability to a plaintiff who could not have been foreseen &quot;has been followed by a number of states besides New York, but it remains the minority rule. Most states continue to muddle along with the nebulous &#x27;proximate cause&#x27; approach, which emphasizes the proximity in time and space of the defendant&#x27;s careless act to the plaintiff&#x27;s injury; that was the approach taken by Judge Andrews&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Palsgraf&quot;.&quot;

The overwhelming majority of state courts accept that there must be a duty of care for there to be liability: the courts of Wisconsin, though, have stated that they have adopted Andrews&#x27; approach, and impose liability when there was a duty to any person, whether or not that person is the plaintiff. The &quot;Restatement (Second) of Torts&quot; (1965) amended the earlier formulation only slightly, but the third &quot;Restatement&quot; (2009), takes an approach closer to that of Andrews in focusing on whether the defendant engaged in an activity that carried a risk of harm to another (not necessarily the plaintiff), and on whether the defendant exercised reasonable care. The new formulation makes foreseeability, or the scope of the risk, not a hurdle that must be overcome, as in &quot;Palsgraf&quot;, but a factor to be weighed with others when determining whether there was negligence. Thus, according to law professor David Owen in his 2009 article, &quot;the &quot;Restatement (Third)&quot; discards Judge Cardozo&#x27;s elemental work in &quot;Palsgraf&quot; so long ago. And ... also rejects Judge Andrew&#x27;s valuable insight that juries should be offered a wide range of fairness factors, beginning with foreseeability, in figuring how far responsibility should extend&quot;.

== Discussion ==
According to Posner, &quot;Cardozo&#x27;s &#x27;bottom line&#x27; is that there is no liability to an unforeseeable plaintiff&quot;. Don Herzog, in his 2017 book, deemed the &quot;Palsgraf&quot; principle to mean that &quot;if anyone was wronged here, it was the man with the parcel. The guards&#x27; wronging him happened to harm Mrs. Palsgraf. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they wronged Mrs. Palsgraf. And if they didn&#x27;t wrong her, she can&#x27;t conceivably prevail in a tort action. Cardozo is not thinking that if he were on the jury, he wouldn&#x27;t find the railroad liable. He is saying it was a legal error to let the jury finding stand.&quot; This is because &quot;the crucial fact for Cardozo is that the parcel of explosives was unmarked. So reasonably careful conductors worry only that if they make it fall, it will break ... They have no reason to worry about the welfare of Mrs. Palsgraf.&quot;

Cardozo has been praised for his style of writing in &quot;Palsgraf&quot;. Posner noted that in the facts of the case Cardozo &quot;saw instantiated the basic principles of negligence law and was able to articulate them in prose of striking freshness, clarity, and vividness&quot;, in an opinion mostly written in short sentences and lacking footnotes or block quotes. University of Pennsylvania Law School Professor Kim Lane Scheppele noted that the opinion was &quot;written by Judge Benjamin Cardozo at the height of his formidable powers&quot;. Richard Polenberg, in his study of that jurist, stated, &quot;Cardozo had a genius for making it seem that the results he reached were logical, inevitable, and legally unassailable&quot;. Prosser stated, &quot;with due respect to the superlative style in which both [Cardozo&#x27;s and Andrews&#x27; opinions] are written, neither of them wears well on long acquaintance. Both of them beg the question shamelessly, stating dogmatic propositions without reason or explanation.&quot; Herzog was also less enthusiastic, noting that &quot;the majority opinion is unfortunately written in the curious idiolect I sometimes call Cardozo-speak.&quot;

From its early days, there has been criticism of &quot;Palsgraf&quot;, and more recently, of Cardozo for authoring it. Cowan, writing in 1938, described its holding as limited to its facts, that given the identical circumstances recurring, the railroad would breach no duty to the new plaintiff by assisting a man with such a package in boarding. Prosser in his 1953 article wondered &quot;how can any rule as to the &#x27;scope of the risk&#x27; evolved from two guards, a package of fireworks and a scale aid in the slightest degree in the solution of this question? Is it proper, in &quot;Palsgraf&quot; itself, so utterly to ignore the fact that the plaintiff was a passenger[?] ... until the question is decided, is &quot;Palsgraf&quot; really definite authority even for &quot;Palsgraf&quot; ?&quot;

Noonan&#x27;s 1976 book chronicled the unwillingness by legal scholars to utilize the &quot;multitude of legal facts not mentioned by Cardozo and Andrews&quot;, even though the lower-court record in &quot;Palsgraf&quot; was reproduced in a civil procedure casebook in the 1950s. Noonan criticized Cardozo for not taking Palsgraf&#x27;s circumstances into account when making his decision, and listed factors that may have influenced Cardozo against the plaintiff, including that he was a lifelong bachelor who did not have Palsgraf&#x27;s experience of caring for children, and he may have frowned upon Wood&#x27;s representation of Palsgraf (likely on a contingent fee, something not favored at the time). Posner, writing in 1990, disagreed with Noonan and with feminist critics following him, noting that judges take an oath to do equal justice to rich and poor, &quot;so the fact that Mrs. Palsgraf was poor would not have been a principled ground for bending the rules in her favor&quot;. Noonan had considered unjust the award of court costs against Palsgraf, and in her 2016 book, law professor Cathleen Kaveny agreed, &quot;the penalty imposed on Palsgraf for seeking justice through the courts was to deprive her, a single mother, of the ability to support her children ... All judges, however can develop empathy. And in telling the story of Helen Palsgraf, Judge Noonan makes a good case for why they should.&quot;

In 2011, Cardi analyzed the present-day influence that &quot;Palsgraf&quot; has had on state courts. He found that neither Cardozo nor Andrews has won on the question of how duty of care is formulated, with courts applying policy analyses. &quot;As to the proper doctrinal home for plaintiff-foreseeability, Cardozo has undoubtedly prevailed. Although a clear majority of jurisdictions state that duty is the proper home for plaintiff-foreseeability, Cardozo&#x27;s vision of foreseeability as a categorical determination has not been widely adopted.&quot; But, he noted, &quot;Andrews may have found a back door to victory. Arguably the most important consequence of the &quot;Palsgraf&quot; decision, the resolution of the judge/jury question, appears to lean in Andrews&#x27; direction. A majority of courts prefer to leave foreseeability—even as a part of duty—to the jury.&quot;

Scheppele put &quot;Palsgraf&quot; in social context, noting that 108 passengers were killed in railroad operations on the LIRR in 1924, a typical figure for it in the 1920s.

<text>Roger Kingdom (born August 26, 1962) is an American former sprint hurdler who was twice Olympic champion in the 110 meters. Kingdom set a world record of 12.92 in 1989. He is now an athletics coach and strength and conditioning coach who currently works as a speed and conditioning coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the NFL.

==Early life and athletics==
Born in Vienna, Georgia, an athlete of note Kingdom excelled at the high jump and discus in his formative years as well as being a noteworthy American football player. He attended the University of Pittsburgh originally on a football scholarship but excelled on the school&#x27;s track team winning the NCAA outdoor national championship in the 110 meter hurdles in 1983 and the NCAA indoor national championship in the 55 meter hurdles in 1984.

He had a long and distinguished career on the track in the 110 meter high hurdles, winning his first Olympic gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In 1988, he was unbeaten all season and was the favorite to retain his Olympic title in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. In a stunning display of technique, power, and speed, he won by three meters, becoming the first man to run below the 13 second barrier in an Olympic final, running 12.98s. This record stood until 1996 when Allen Johnson broke it at the Atlanta Games. Kingdom is only the second athlete to have successfully defended his 110 m hurdle Olympic title, after Lee Calhoun, who won the gold medal in both 1956 and 1960.

Kingdom set a 110 m high hurdles World Record of 12.92 seconds in Zürich, Switzerland in 1989. This stood until August 20, 1993 when it was beaten by 1/100 of a second by Colin Jackson of Great Britain in Stuttgart, Germany, a subsequent record that stood for 13 years.

His progress was hampered some in 1991 when he underwent surgery to repair ACL damage and remove bone chips from his knee. He returned to competition to win the gold medal in the 1995 Pan American Games and the bronze medal in the 1995 World Championships in Athletics.

Kingdom retired from active athletic competition in 1999.

In 2006, Kingdom was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted along with NFL&#x27;s Bap Manzini and MLB&#x27;s Jim Russell.

In 2018, Kingdom was included in the inaugural class of the University of Pittsburgh Pitt Athletics Hall of Fame

==Coaching==
Kingdom joined the California University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s athletics staff as an assistant Track &amp; Field and Cross Country coach in 2004. He then became the director of both teams in 2006.

On March 6, 2014, Kingdom was hired as the assistant strength and conditioning coach for the NFL&#x27;s Arizona Cardinals. Kingdom worked with head strength and conditioning coach Buddy Morris, his own strength coach at the University of Pittsburgh, and focused on improving the team&#x27;s speed.

Kingdom then spent the 2018 season as the Interim Director of Track &amp; Field/Cross Country at the University of Central Florida

In 2019, Kingdom returned to the NFL as the speed and conditioning coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In Tampa, he again worked under head coach Bruce Arians, who was the Cardinals&#x27; head coach during Kingdom&#x27;s tenure in Arizona.

In 2021, Kingdom won a Super Bowl title in Super Bowl LV.

<doc id="804245" wikidata="Q380376" url="?curid=804245" title="Håkan Nesser">
<text>Håkan Nesser (born 21 February 1950) is a Swedish author and teacher who mainly writes crime fiction. He has won Best Swedish Crime Novel Award three times, and his novel &quot;Carambole&quot; won the prestigious Glass Key award in 2000. His books have been translated from Swedish into more than twenty languages.

==Early life==
Håkan Nesser was born and grew up in Kumla, Örebro County. His first novel was published in 1988. He worked as a teacher in Uppsala until 1998 when he became a full-time author. In August 2006, Håkan Nesser and his wife Elke (a psychiatrist) moved to Greenwich Village in New York. A few years later, they moved to London since it was easier for his wife to find work there. They now live in Stockholm on the island Furillen in the Baltic Sea.

==Criminal conviction==
On June 14, 2024, Håkan Nesser was sentenced by the Svea Court of Appeal to one year and six months in prison for three counts of aggravated tax evasion. In February 2025, the Supreme Court of Sweden decided to reject Nesser&#x27;s request for leave to appeal. The crime had come to the attention of the judicial system thanks to the Paradise Papers.

==Characters and themes==
A recurring main character is named Van Veeteren, a detective in the early novels and later the owner of an antique books shop. These books play out in a fictitious city named Maardam, said to be located in northern Europe in a country which is never named but resembles Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland and Germany. The names however are mostly Dutch.

With his 2006 crime novel &quot;Människa utan hund&quot; (&quot;Human without Dog&quot;) Nesser introduced a new main character, Inspector Gunnar Barbarotti, a Swedish police inspector of Italian descent. He has remained the main protagonist in Nesser&#x27;s crime books since then. Barbarotti is a more upbeat character than Van Veeteren and the books are firmly set in Sweden, although the town of Kymlinge is fictitious and named after an &quot;abandoned tube station&quot; in Stockholm.

In August 2011 he hinted on his own site that a future book (which became &quot;The Living and the Dead in Winsford&quot;) would take place in the &quot;county of Somerset&quot;.

<text>The Rouse Ball Professorship of English Law is a senior professorship in English law at the University of Cambridge, established in 1927 by a bequest from the mathematician W. W. Rouse Ball. In establishing the office, Rouse Ball expressed a hope &quot;that it might be found practicable for such Professor or Reader to include in his or her lectures and treatment historical and philosophical aspects of the subject&quot;.

Its holders are chosen based on international recognition in their field of scholarship, having an outstanding record in research and publication, strategic vision and commitment to developing their field of scholarship within the University of Cambridge, and the Faculty of Law&#x27;s profile within that field, and having a commitment to excellence in learning and teaching.

On 1 October 2019, Professor Louise Gullifer was appointed to the professorship, following the retirement of her predecessor David Feldman.

<doc id="804250" wikidata="Q3033548" url="?curid=804250" title="Doctor Who spinoffs">
<text>&quot;Doctor Who&quot; spinoffs refers to material created outside of, but related to, the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Both during the main run of the series from 1963 to 1989 and after its cancellation, numerous novels, comic strips, comic books and other material were generated based on the characters and situations introduced in the show. These spinoffs continued to be produced even without a television series to support them and helped keep the show alive in the minds of its fans and the public until the programme was revived in 2005.

This entry mainly concentrates on &quot;official&quot; spinoffs, that is to say, material sanctioned by the British Broadcasting Corporation, which produces the series, as well as material sanctioned by the copyright holders of characters from the series.

One aspect of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spinoffs which makes them different from many spinoffs from other science fiction franchises is that many of the television writers and stars have been directly involved in the production of spinoffs. For example, it has become common for a former television actor to reprise their character for an audio play.

The BBC holds no position on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; canon. Although the spinoffs generally do not intentionally contradict the television series, the various spinoff series do occasionally contradict each other.

== Television ==

=== Official spinoff productions ===
The first spinoff attempt that actually reached the production stage appeared in 1981, when a 50-minute pilot episode for a series to be called &quot;K-9 and Company&quot; was aired. It focused on the adventures of former Doctor Who companions Sarah Jane Smith and K-9, a robot dog. The pilot, subtitled &quot;A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, despite receiving high ratings of 8.4 million, was not commissioned for a development into a series, though Sarah Jane and K-9 would later reappear together on the main &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series and her adventures would be continued in audio form by Big Finish Productions in the 2000s.

Since the return of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005, the show was accompanied by a documentary series, &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;, broadcast on BBC Three. Episodes were also edited to a 15-minute run time and rebroadcast with the title &quot;Doctor Who Confidential: Cut Down&quot;; these edited versions were included on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; DVD releases. In 2011, &quot;Confidential&quot; was among several shows cancelled by BBC Three to free up space for new programming.

Following the success of the first series of the revived &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, a new spinoff titled &quot;Torchwood&quot; became the first to be commissioned as a full television series. In contrast to its parent show, &quot;Torchwood&quot; was initially conceived by creator Russell T Davies as an &quot;adult&quot; programme to be broadcast post-watershed. It is set in modern-day Cardiff and revolves around a team investigating alien activities and crime. The series features John Barrowman, playing former Ninth Doctor companion Jack Harkness, police officer Gwen Cooper, computer expert Toshiko Sato, medic Owen Harper and &quot;support man&quot;, Ianto Jones. The first episode aired 22 October 2006 and received a record BBC Three (and all British cable television record for a locally produced non-sporting event) high rating of 2.4 million viewers. The first series (Oct &#x27;06 – Jan &#x27;07) comprised 13 episodes broadcast on BBC Three, and was followed by a second 13-part series (Jan &#x27;08 – Apr &#x27;08) broadcast on BBC Two. A third series was written as a five-part mini-series titled &quot;&quot;, airing on five consecutive nights from to 10 July 2009 on BBC One. A fourth series was similarly structured as a single story told as a ten-part mini-series, titled &quot;&quot;; unlike previous series, &quot;Miracle Day&quot; was a co-production between the BBC and the US cable television network Starz. The fourth series premiered on 8 July 2011 on Starz in the US and on 14 July 2011 on BBC One in the United Kingdom.

The 2006 and 2007 series were companioned with a CBBC show entitled &quot;Totally Doctor Who&quot;. Series 1 was presented by CBBC and &quot;Smile&quot; presenter Barney Harwood and &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter Liz Barker. For the show&#x27;s second series Barker was replaced by &quot;SMart&quot; presenter Kirsten O&#x27;Brien. During the second series, an animated serial, &quot;The Infinite Quest&quot;, was featured. David Tennant and Freema Agyeman reprised their roles from the live-action television series while Anthony Head, a guest star during the 2006 season, returned in a different role.

A second major spinoff of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, created for a younger audience on CBBC, starring Elisabeth Sladen as the Doctor&#x27;s former companion Sarah Jane Smith. It began with a 60-minute pilot episode co-written by Davies and Gareth Roberts, premiering on BBC One and the CBBC channel on New Year&#x27;s Day 2007; the full series started on 24 September 2007, consisting of two-part serials with half-hour individual episodes. Five series were produced altogether, the first four series consisting of twelve episodes each; the fifth series was truncated with only six episodes having been produced before Sladen&#x27;s death in 2011, as a result of which the programme was cancelled. &quot;Sarah Jane&#x27;s Alien Files&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, aired along with the fourth series in 2010.

A second animated serial, &quot;Dreamland&quot;, aired on CBBC in Autumn 2009. David Tennant voiced the Tenth Doctor, and the serial also starred Georgia Tennant (who appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 2008 series as the Doctor&#x27;s daughter, Jenny).

On 24 April 2006 &quot;The Independent&quot;, the &quot;Daily Star&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; confirmed, following past rumours, that K-9 would be featured in a 26-part animated children&#x27;s series, &quot;K-9&quot;, to be written by Bob Baker. The article in &quot;The Times&quot; also featured a picture of the redesigned K-9 for the animated series. Each episode will be 30 minutes long, made by Jetix Europe and London-based distribution unit Park Entertainment. According to a report in &quot;Broadcast&quot; magazine, the BBC opted out of involvement in order to focus on &quot;Torchwood&quot;, meaning that BBC-owned characters are unlikely to appear in the series. K-9 was first premiered on 31 October 2009. The 26th and final episode was aired on 25 September 2010.

On 1 October 2015 the BBC announced a new spinoff titled, &quot;Class&quot;, which is set in Coal Hill School. It premièred on BBC Three on 22 October 2016. The eight-episode series is written by Patrick Ness. In March 2016, it was announced that Greg Austin would be cast as Charlie. On 7 September 2017, BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh confirmed that the series had been cancelled.

A new animated series called &quot;Daleks!&quot;, which consists of five 10-minute long episodes, was released on the official &quot;Doctor Who&quot; YouTube channel in 2020.

On 30 October 2023, it was announced that &quot;The Whoniverse&quot;, a new section on BBC iPlayer dedicated to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; content, would release spinoffs, with the first being &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot; which first premiered on 1 November 2023.

==== Future television spinoffs ====
On 27 January 2023, Russell T Davies confirmed that future &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spinoffs were in the works. A spinoff miniseries centered around UNIT starring Jemma Redgrave as Kate Stewart titled &quot;The War Between the Land and the Sea&quot; is scheduled to be released in 2025.

===Charity===
&quot;Doctor Who&quot; also appeared on television in the form of special one-off productions to benefit charity. In 1993, &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; was produced for the benefit of &quot;Children in Need&quot;, coinciding with the series&#x27; 30th anniversary. It was a special in two parts, running about 12 minutes in total, which featured all surviving Doctors (including Tom Baker in his first appearance as the character since 1981), and more than a dozen former companions. Not meant to be taken seriously, the story had the Rani opening a hole in time, cycling the Doctor and his companions through his previous incarnations and menacing them with monsters from the show&#x27;s past. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, the action taking place in the latter&#x27;s Albert Square location.

In 1999, &quot;Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death&quot;, a parody starring Rowan Atkinson as a future incarnation of the Doctor in his final battle with the Master (Jonathan Pryce), was created for the charity Comic Relief. During the parody&#x27;s climax, when the Doctor regenerates several times, actors Richard E. Grant, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent and Joanna Lumley all had a chance to play the character. Richard E. Grant would go on to play another unofficial incarnation of the Doctor for the webcast of &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot;. BBC Video released the special in the same format as regular &quot;Doctor Who&quot; releases.

A second Children in Need special, but one that was part of the series&#x27; continuity, was produced for the charity&#x27;s 2005 appeal. This 7-minute &quot;mini-episode&quot; starred David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose Tyler, and filled in a gap between the episodes &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;.

A third Children in Need special, but one that was part of the series&#x27; continuity, was produced for the charity&#x27;s 2007 appeal. &quot;Time Crash&quot; starred David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor and Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor, and filled in a gap between the episodes &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot; and &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;. This takes part directly after Martha leaves the TARDIS, and ends when the &quot;Titanic&quot; crashes into the TARDIS.

For the 2011 Comic Relief Red Nose Day appeal a two-part story was shown. It starred Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill and did not have any guest stars.

===Unmade===
The first attempt to produce a spinoff television series for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; occurred in the mid-1960s when Terry Nation attempted to launch a US-produced serialised series focusing on the Daleks. A pilot-episode script entitled &quot;The Destroyers&quot; was written but no pilot film was ever produced. Years later, an outline of the story (which would have featured at least one character, Sara Kingdom, later featured in the parent series) appeared in &quot;The Official Doctor Who &amp; the Daleks Book&quot;. The US Dalek pilot was released on audio by Big Finish Productions in 2010 as part of the &quot;Lost Stories&quot; series, with actress Jean Marsh reprising the role of Sara.

There was some discussion about spinning off the characters of Henry Gordon Jago and Professor George Litefoot from the 1977 serial &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot; into their own series, but this was not taken forward on television (although it has been produced on audio).

The concept art for an animated &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series was produced by the Canadian animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced.

CBBC originally expressed an interest in a &quot;Young Doctor Who&quot; series, chronicling the childhood of the Doctor. Russell T Davies vetoed this concept, saying &quot;somehow, the idea of a fourteen-year-old Doctor, on Gallifrey inventing sonic screwdrivers, takes away from the mystery and intrigue of who he is and where he came from,&quot;. He instead suggested &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; (see above).

A further spinoff of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;—&quot;Rose Tyler: Earth Defence&quot;, a 90-minute special that could possibly become an annual event—was cancelled by Davies at a late stage of its development. He considered it to be &quot;a spin-off too far&quot;, despite the production having been commissioned and budgeted by the controller of BBC One.

===Novelisations===

Novelisations based upon individual &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials were first published in the mid-1960s, the first being &quot;Dr. Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks&quot; by David Whitaker, a loose adaptation of the show&#x27;s second serial, &quot;The Daleks&quot;. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novelisations became something of a tradition beginning in the early 1970s when Target Books (initially published by Universal-Tandem, later to become part of W.H. Allen &amp; Co and then Virgin Publishing) began publishing them on a regular basis, initially based upon the then-current Third Doctor&#x27;s episodes, but soon expanding to include all past Doctors as well.

The initial three novelisations had been published in various editions both inside and outside the United Kingdom (editions appeared in the Netherlands, Canada and the United States). Further foreign editions of the novelisations appeared from the 1970s, with the books being translated for readers in the Netherlands, Brazil, Turkey, the US (where the texts were slightly tweaked to eliminate unfamiliar Anglicisms), Japan, West Germany, Portugal, France and Finland.

By 1994, when the final Target book was published, all but six of the broadcast &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials had been novelised, as well as a radio serial (&quot;Slipback&quot;), stories slated for the &quot;missing season&quot; but never produced due to the 18-month hiatus in 1985–1986 (&quot;The Nightmare Fair&quot;, &quot;The Ultimate Evil&quot; and &quot;Mission to Magnus&quot;), the spinoff &quot;K-9 and Company&quot;, and even a 1976 children&#x27;s story record (&quot;The Pescatons&quot;), which has the distinction of being the final &quot;Doctor Who&quot; book published under the Target imprint. (The Target logo was retained for later reprints and intermittent new titles up to 1994 and was by this time used exclusively for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.)

Most of these novelisations contained minimal amounts of original material and were (usually) adapted closely from the shooting scripts, with the intent of the books being souvenirs of previously aired shows in the pre-VCR era; the decision by the BBC to delete many episodes from the Hartnell, Troughton and Pertwee eras resulted in many of these books becoming the only way for these &quot;lost&quot; adventures to be experienced prior to the release of soundtracks for those episodes and/or recovery of lost episodes (the Pertwee era, in particular, has been rendered intact since the early 1990s, and several Hartnell and Troughton stories are once again complete). Although novelisations became more elaborate in later years, the early books usually followed a set formula and were for a time restricted to a maximum page length as they were considered children&#x27;s literature.

Not all Target novelisations faithfully followed the scripts. John Lucarotti&#x27;s &quot;The Massacre&quot; (1987) completely changed the plot of the source serial, &quot;The Massacre of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Eve&quot;. Some guide books (notably 1999&#x27;s &quot;A Critical Guide to Doctor Who on Television&quot; by Kenneth Muir) describe the plot of the novel rather than the original serial due to the fact the original serial is one of the many that were lost. Also, when Target launched the novelisation line, there was no inkling that ultimately more than 150 of the show&#x27;s storylines would be adapted; as a result, there are numerous continuity gaps between early Target books and the scripts and/or later published novelisations; one example is &quot;Doctor Who and the Doomsday Weapon&quot; (based upon &quot;Colony in Space&quot;) which as written depicts Jo Grant&#x27;s first adventure with the Doctor, even though the television series introduced her several serials earlier in &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; (which was novelised at a later date and ignored the discrepancy). Authors sometimes added epilogues to their novelisations which were at odds with other material: &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot; by Ian Briggs suggested a fate for Ace that differed from later original novels, and Philip Martin&#x27;s adaptation of the &quot;Mindwarp&quot; segment of &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; included an ending that completely contradicted the scripted ending of the televised serial.

After Virgin began its New Adventures and Missing Adventures line of original novels in 1991, it also published several additional novelisations both on their own and under the Missing Adventures label. These were two Dalek stories from the Troughton era, &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot; and &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;, which—along with another radio novelisation &quot;The Paradise of Death&quot;—are considered to be the last of the Target run.

Later novelisations tended to be included as part of the original novel series from Virgin. &quot;The Ghosts of N-Space&quot;, a second radio serial featuring Jon Pertwee produced in the mid-1990s was novelised, as were several non BBC spinoff video productions such as &quot;&quot; (as one section of a larger original novel) and &quot;Downtime&quot;, adding an air of official sanction to them.

In 1996, BBC Books published a novelisation of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie. A one-time return to serial novelisations occurred in 2004 when BBC Books novelised the made-for-Internet adventure, &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot;.

Adams&#x27; stories were never novelised, reportedly because he wanted to do the job himself. However, soon after his tenure with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; ended, the author had gained considerable popularity because of his &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; franchise and became (depending upon the source of information) either too busy or too expensive (or both). Adams would later recycle elements of &quot;City of Death&quot; and the unbroadcast &quot;Shada&quot; into his Dirk Gently novels. As for Saward&#x27;s two Dalek serials, Target Books was unable to come to an agreement which would satisfy both Eric Saward and Terry Nation&#x27;s estate for the novelisations. Virgin tried again at a later date and authors were assigned for both books, but again an agreement was not reached.

Since the release of the last published book by Target in 1994, six titles remained as yet unpublished:

*&quot;Shada&quot; (a later released novel by Gareth Roberts, only through BBC Books though)
*&quot;City of Death&quot; (a later released novel by James Goss)
*&quot;The Pirate Planet&quot; (a later released novel by James Goss)
*&quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; (a later released novel by Eric Saward)
*&quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; (a later released novel by Eric Saward)
*&quot;The TV Movie&quot; (a later released novel by Gary Russell)

&quot;Shada&quot; was published on 15 March 2012 by BBC Books, and is still the only remaining book of the original show&#x27;s run to not be published by Target Books. Target did publish &quot;City of Death&quot; on 5 April 2018. &quot;The Pirate Planet&quot;, &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;, &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;, and &quot;The Doctor Who TV Movie&quot;, were all published on 11 March 2021 by Target Books.

Three novels of the original run were rewritten as audiobook exclusives, but were later published in print, once again by Target:
*&quot;The Stones of Blood&quot;, rewritten by David Fisher (audiobook released 5 May 2011, print version released 14 July 2022)
*&quot;The Androids of Tara&quot;, rewritten by David Fisher (audiobook released 5 July 2012, print version released 14 July 2022)
*&quot;Warriors&#x27; Gate and Beyond&quot;, rewritten and expanded by Stephen Gallagher (audiobook released 4 April 2019, print version released 13 July 2023)

From 1988, Titan Books released script books of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials. This included an unproduced serial, &quot;The Masters of Luxor&quot; (written 1963–1964, published 1992) by Anthony Coburn, which would have been the second serial of the programme if it had not been rejected. The story features the Doctor and his companions encountering an ancient civilisation of deactivated robots.

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; was successfully brought back to television in 2005, but for many years there were no plans to novelise episodes from the 21st century version of the programme. Instead, the BBC published original novels featuring the Ninth Doctor, Tenth Doctor, Eleventh Doctor and Twelfth Doctor, and a hardback script book containing the shooting scripts for the 2005 series. Scripts for later seasons have not yet been published as of 2018, though 2005–2009 lead writer Russell T Davies has made his scripts available online.

In 2007, Penguin Books revived the novelisations concept for the spinoff series, &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. As of early 2010, all stories from the series&#x27; first season, two from the second, and one from the third, have been adapted. The third-season novelisation, adapting &quot;The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith&quot;, marked the first appearance of the Doctor in a TV-based novelisation since the 1996 TV movie was adapted.

&quot;Shada&quot; by Douglas Adams (not originally completed for broadcast after television production was postponed in 1979, but completed with narration for video, then remade as a webcast in 2003) was finally released by BBC Books in 2012, adapted by Gareth Roberts.

Adams&#x27; scripts for &quot;City of Death&quot; and &quot;The Pirate Planet&quot; were novelised by James Goss and published in 2015 and 2017, respectively.

In 2018, BBC Books began a line adaptations of episodes from the 21st-century revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as part of &quot;The Target Collection&quot;.

=== Original fiction ===
The earliest original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spinoff fiction appeared in children&#x27;s annuals from 1964, and over the years many short stories, novellas and full-length novels have been published.

====Short stories and novellas====

The earliest original Doctor Who fiction were short stories that appeared in the official BBC &quot;Doctor Who&quot; annuals, which were published from 1964 to 1985 (and later revived by Marvel Comics as &quot;Doctor Who Year Books&quot; and as annuals by the BBC in 2005). A 45-page novella titled &quot;Doctor Who and the Invasion from Space&quot;, published in 1966, is the earliest known original long-form prose &quot;Doctor Who&quot; adventure.

Short stories also appeared in other venues such as two anniversary specials produced by the editors of the &quot;Radio Times&quot;. The first of these (1973) was Terry Nation&#x27;s &quot;We Are the Daleks!&quot; while the second (1983) had Eric Saward&#x27;s &quot;Birth of a Renegade&quot;. The former explains the origins of the Daleks and the latter reveals the background of Susan, but both contradict the series and many other stories on the subject. There were also stories in newspapers and comics, storybooks and even serials published on confectionery wrappers and trading cards. In 1979, Nation wrote &quot;Daleks: The Secret Invasion&quot;, a novella included in &quot;Terry Nation&#x27;s Dalek Special&quot;; this was the first original &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-related fiction to be published by Target Books.

During the 1990s, Virgin Publishing launched a series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-based short story anthologies titled &quot;Decalog&quot;. A total of five volumes were published, and the last two, &quot;Decalog 4&quot; and &quot;Decalog 5&quot; were published after Virgin had lost the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; franchise and did not feature the Doctor. Decalog 4 concentrated on the family of Roz Forrester—a companion introduced in the NAs—over a thousand-year time span.

Also during the 1990s, Marvel Comics commissioned the writers of the various original novels under Virgin&#x27;s New and Missing Adventures lines (see below) to write short pieces entitled &quot;Preludes&quot; which were run in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;. These short stories (never more than one magazine page in length) usually focused on an event just prior to a particular novel, or on a character prior to his or her encounter with the Doctor. Some non-novel related short stories titled &quot;Brief Encounters&quot; were also written, including one in which the Seventh Doctor met a future incarnation of himself. (The illustration accompanying this story based the future Doctor on actor Nicholas Briggs, who had played the Doctor in unauthorised audio dramas produced by the fan group Audio Visuals. The Briggs Doctor also appeared in the DWM comic strip.)

BBC Books, after it took over the licence to publish original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction, published several &quot;Decalog&quot;-style anthologies in the late 1990s under variations of the title &quot;Short Trips&quot;. Big Finish Productions later obtained a license to produce hardback short story anthologies and appropriated the &quot;Short Trips&quot; title; Big Finish has also published short story collections featuring Bernice Summerfield, a former companion of the Seventh and Eighth Doctors.

In the early 2000s, Telos Publishing produced a series of original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novellas, published individually in hardcover; the first, &quot;Time and Relative&quot; by Kim Newman, was released on 23 November 2001. Although the series was reasonably successful (in spite of the odd publication format, which resulted from the BBC having reserved for its own use the rights to publish &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story collections and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; books in paperback), the BBC chose not to renew Telos&#x27;s licence, and the series ended in March 2004, having completed 15 novellas featuring the Doctor. Prior to losing the license, a small number of Telos releases were re-issued in paperback form (albeit in a larger format than the BBC Books releases) following a separate agreement with the BBC.

Telos has subsequently launched a new series of novellas, &quot;Time Hunter&quot;, featuring characters created for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novella, &quot;The Cabinet of Light&quot;.

In 2006, BBC Books launched an annual series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novellas as part of the government-sponsored &quot;Quick Reads Initiative&quot; which were shorter stories (generally less than one hundred pages) intended to promote literacy in younger readers. The cover formats were the same as that for the New Series Adventures, however the books are published in paperbacks and do not have the same international distribution as the hardcovers. The first Quick Reads release was &quot;I Am a Dalek&quot; by Gareth Roberts. Released in March 2006, it was actually the first original Tenth Doctor novel to be released, predating the first series of full-length Tenth Doctor novels by a month. A second volume appeared in 2007, and a third has been announced for 2008.

====Novels====

After years of only novelisations being published, the first full-length original &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-related novels appeared in 1986 when Target launched a series of books titled &quot;The Companions of Doctor Who&quot; which were original works focusing on the Doctor&#x27;s former assistants. The first two books were &quot;Turlough and the Earthlink Dilemma&quot; by Tony Attwood, published in July 1986 based upon the character played by Mark Strickson in the early 1980s and &quot;Harry Sullivan&#x27;s War&quot; written by Ian Marter, who had actually played Harry Sullivan on the series a decade earlier, published in October 1986. Other novels would have featured Tegan, the Brigadier, Victoria and Mike Yates. Victoria eventually was the focus of the novel (and subsequent video) &quot;Downtime&quot; by Marc Platt. Yates would have appeared in &quot;The Killing Stone&quot; by actor Richard Franklin, but the novel was never published, although an abridged recording by Franklin based on the book appeared in 2002.

In 1989, Target launched another short-lived series of &quot;original&quot; novels, this time titled &quot;The Missing Episodes&quot; and based upon serials commissioned for but never produced for the cancelled 1985–1986 season. Again, only three books were published, the first being &quot;The Nightmare Fair&quot; by Graham Williams in May 1989, followed by &quot;The Ultimate Evil&quot; by Wally K. Daly in August 1989, and &quot;Mission to Magnus&quot; by Philip Martin in July 1990.

Virgin Publishing&#x27;s line of original novels, the New Adventures, featuring the Seventh Doctor began in July 1991 with &quot;&quot; by John Peel, and were billed as telling &quot;stories too broad and deep for the small screen&quot;. Virgin&#x27;s predecessors, Target Books and W. H. Allen Ltd, had by this point been publishing novelisations for twenty years, and even before the series had come to a conclusion, successive editors of the range such as Nigel Robinson and Peter Darvill-Evans had identified the need for original material to complement the few stories there were left to be novelised. The first four New Adventures were a single story arc called &quot;Timewyrm&quot;, and the first volume was controversial for including sexuality and violence of a level not encountered in the Target Books range. A second story arc, the three-volume &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; followed, after which the &quot;NA&quot; range settled into a mixture of standalone and arc stories.

The &quot;New Adventures&quot; were joined in 1994 by a companion series (the &quot;Missing Adventures&quot;) telling &quot;untold&quot; stories with earlier Doctors, set between episodes of the television series. At its height, new novels in both lines were being published monthly. Many authors of these books went on to write for the revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005: Russell T Davies, Paul Cornell, Gareth Roberts, Matt Jones and Mark Gatiss. Indeed, if one counts Steven Moffat&#x27;s contribution to the second Decalog collection, then about 75% of episodes of the new series were written by people who contributed to the Virgin line. (The same cannot be said of the BBC Books line. In fact, no writer who made their Doctor Who debut on the BBC Books line has written for the new series. The only writers to have contributed to the BBC line and the new series are those who also wrote for the Virgin line—Gatiss, who wrote two BBC books, and Cornell, who wrote one. Several writers from the BBC line have written tie-in novels for the new series, however, including editors Justin Richards and Stephen Cole.)

In the climate of renewed interest in the series that followed the 1996 telemovie, the BBC decided to reclaim Virgin&#x27;s licence when it next came up for renewal and publish its own series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels. The last two Virgin &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels were released in April 1997, bringing to an end almost 25 years of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; publishing outside of the BBC, with the first two BBC-published novels released in June that same year.

Virgin, meanwhile, continued the New Adventures line for several years afterward, focusing upon the Doctor&#x27;s former assistant, Professor Bernice Summerfield who had been the first companion created specifically for literature, rather than for television. These books (sometimes referred to informally as &quot;The Adventures of Benny Summerfield&quot;) gained their own fan following and featured appearances by other characters created specifically for the literary world of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

The BBC began releasing two new novels every two months, one featuring the ongoing adventures of the Eighth Doctor and the other an &quot;untold&quot; story of an earlier Doctor, referred to as the Eighth Doctor Adventures (EDAs) and Past Doctor Adventures (PDAs) respectively. Although many authors who wrote for the Virgin line returned to write for the BBC series, direct continuity between the two sets of books was discouraged, at least initially. Later, the editors loosened their policy on links between the Virgin and BBC novels, even publishing direct sequels to novels by the other publisher; for example, Justin Richards&#x27; &quot;Millennium Shock&quot; was a sequel to his earlier Virgin Missing Adventure &quot;System Shock&quot;. For the most part, however, links between the fictional ranges were kept deliberately oblique so as not to alienate new readers.

In 2004, the BBC almost halved the frequency of publication from 22 books a year (one EDA and one PDA per month) to 12, each release now coming out once every other month. When the new television series began in 2005, the EDAs came to an end, with future novels featuring the Eighth Doctor to be part of the PDA range. A new line of New Series Adventures began with three Ninth Doctor novels in May 2005. Another three Ninth Doctor novels followed, after which the series continued in 2006 with original novels featuring the Tenth Doctor. As of the fall of 2007 there is no indication of any future novels being planned featuring the Ninth Doctor.

Beginning in 2012, hardback books featuring past Doctors are being published, though at a much reduced rate compared with the pre-2005 output. The books are longer, in a larger format, and written by (or in once case, adapted from earlier work by) prominent science fiction authors. As of the beginning of 2012, the three titles announced are &quot;Shada&quot; by Gareth Roberts (a novelisation of the unbroadcast television story by Douglas Adams), &quot;The Wheel of Ice&quot; by Stephen Baxter and &quot;Harvest of Time&quot; by Alastair Reynolds.

The ninth Doctor novel &quot;The Monsters Inside&quot; by Stephen Cole is the first spinoff novel to be referred to in the television series — in the episode &quot;Boom Town&quot;, the Doctor and Rose&#x27;s trip to the Justicia system is mentioned. In 2007, Paul Cornell&#x27;s NA novel, &quot;Human Nature&quot;, was adapted (with significant changes) as the two-part story &quot;Human Nature&quot; and &quot;The Family of Blood&quot;.

By far, the most prolific writer of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction is Terrance Dicks, who has written well over 70 titles including the majority of Target Books novelisations, as well as original works for both the Virgin and BBC Books series. In March 2007, his first work for the revived series, the Tenth Doctor adventure &quot;Made of Steel&quot;, was released in the Quick Reads format. This was the first original novel published featuring companion Martha Jones.

A number of characters created for original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction have been spun off into series of their own, such as the comic book &quot;Miranda&quot; based upon a character created for Lance Parkin&#x27;s novel &quot;Father Time&quot;, though the comic was not a success and was cancelled after three issues. First Mad Norwegian Press and later Random Static published a series of &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; books, based on the characters created by Lawrence Miles for the novel &quot;Alien Bodies&quot;, and also republished one of the Bernice Summerfield novels originally published by Virgin. Similarly, Chris Cwej received a novel series of his own from Arcbeatle Press, &quot;Cwej&quot;.

== Comics ==
=== Polystyle-era comic strip (1964–1979)===
Comic strip adventures of the Doctor appeared almost from the beginning of the television series. The first phase has become known as the &#x27;Polystyle era&#x27; (1964–1979) of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strips. Paul Scoones, an historian of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strip, writes: &#x27;First launched in the pages of &quot;TV Comic&quot; in November 1964, the comic strip version of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is just one year younger than the television series on which it is based. The strip appeared almost every week: first in &quot;TV Comic&quot;, then in &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;TV Action&quot; before returning to &quot;TV Comic&quot;. All these titles were produced by a company called Polystyle Publications (formally TV Publications), which held the rights to publish a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic [strip] until May 1979 when the last installment of the strip appeared&#x27;. Both the First and Second Doctors were, for a time, shown travelling with two youngsters named John and Gillian who are identified as the Doctor&#x27;s grandchildren. Their place within established continuity has challenged fans ever since, although attempts have been made to reconcile their existence in various spinoff fiction venues.

===Dalek comics===
At the height of &quot;Dalekmania&quot; in the 1960s, a comic strip featuring the Daleks written by Alan Fennell and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Script Editor David Whitaker, but credited to Terry Nation, appeared in the Gerry Anderson &quot;TV Century 21&quot; comic magazine. The BBC also published a number of Dalek Annuals which contained a mixture of comic strips and prose short stories, and, in later volumes, reprints of the &quot;TV Century 21&quot; stories. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television later, concepts such as the Daleks&#x27; use of humanoid duplicates and the design of the Dalek Emperor would later appear in the series. The &quot;TV Century&quot; also featured the Daleks&#x27; enemies the Mechanoids, the spherical robots seen in &quot;The Chase&quot;.

An early Dalek Annual featured the Doctor&#x27;s companion Sara Kingdom and the Space Security Service in stories set prior to her death while.

===&quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; and related publications (1979–present)===
Comic strips, both starring the Doctor and other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; characters, appeared in the pages of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;. This began as a Marvel comic under the name &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; in 1979, which soon changed its title &quot;Doctor Who Monthly&quot;. The magazine continued to be published between 1990 and 2005 during which, apart from one-off productions, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had gone off the air.

The comic strip has usually featured the current Doctor in a series of adventures independent of the novels and the audios, and with another companion, though several crossovers with the worlds of the audio and literary &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and the comics have occurred. Creators who have worked on the &quot;DWM&quot; strip include such notables as writer Alan Moore and artists Dave Gibbons, Mike McMahon and John Ridgway. Selected stories were reprinted in North America by Marvel Comics, which was also the publisher of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; at the time. With&quot;DWM&quot; was published by Marvel, characters occasionally crossed over between the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic and other titles published by Marvel UK; these include the froglike Venusian businessman Josiah Dogbolter and the robotic bounty hunter Death&#x27;s Head.

The &quot;Flood Barriers&quot; feature in the trade paperback &quot;Doctor Who: The Flood&quot;, it was revealed that the comic writers had the opportunity to depict the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration into the Ninth Doctor, but declined when Davies refused to allow them to give the Ninth Doctor a companion prior to Rose Tyler.

The publishers of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; have also produced many the spinoff publications including &quot;Doctor Who Adventures&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who Classic Comics&quot; and many other special publications and annuals which include comics.

&quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, which is now owned by Panini Comics since 1995 and continues to produce new comic strip adventures. Panini has reprinted many of the early DWM strips in trade paperback format and ran a series of annuals called doctor who storybooks from 2005-2009 featuring the current companion/s at the time and the ninth and tenth doctor and in 2005 the first annual to feature the Ninth Doctor and Rose Tyler was printed by Panini but in 2006 it began to be printed by Penguin Books but their logo didn’t appear on the annuals until the 2016 annual.

===IDW series===
At the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con, IDW Publishing announced their intention to publish a new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comics, which would follow the adventures of the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones. The series was scripted by Gary Russell, with art by Nick Roche, and was slated to launch later that year. IDW published this title alongside &quot;Doctor Who Classics&quot;, republishing &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; and &quot;Monthly&quot; stories drawn by Dave Gibbons with new coloring. Subsequently, this was split into two publications titled &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, a six-issue mini-series, and &quot;Doctor Who Classics&quot; respectively. A second mini-series, &quot;Doctor Who: The Forgotten&quot;, by Tony Lee and Pia Guerra, began its release in August 2008 and deals with the Tenth Doctor recalling previous Doctors&#x27; adventures as an aid to fight off forced amnesia. Married writing team John Reppion and Leah Moore, together with artist Ben Templesmith, scripted one-shot &quot;The Whispering Gallery&quot;, which was released in February 2009. This initiated a series of one-shots which included &quot;The Time Machination&quot;, by Tony Lee and Paul Grist, in May 2009, and &quot;Autopia&quot;, by John Ostrander and Kelly Yates, in June.

It was announced Tony Lee in February 2009 at New York Comic Con that Tony Leewould write an ongoing series.

===Titan series===
On 21 January 2014, BBC Worldwide and Titan Comics announced a new deal to publish &quot;Doctor Who&quot; inedited stories featuring the Tenth, Eleventh and the Twelfth Doctors.

===Other comics===
The regular &quot;Doctor Who Annuals&quot; from World Distributors published comics most years from the first annual in 1965 until they ceased producing &quot;Doctor Who&quot; annuals in 1985. But when annuals were brought back in 2005 more annual comics and short stories were published and continue to be as of 27/4/24

In 2005 a webcomic called The Forge: project Longinus, written by Cavan Scott and Mark Wright and illustrated by Bryan Coyle was produced as a spinoff from Scott and Wright&#x27;s Big Finish Productions &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio dramas, and contained a number of unofficial references to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe.

Two short-lived spinoff series, &quot;Miranda&quot; from Comeuppance Comics and &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; from Mad Norwegian Press, have also appeared, both featuring characters who had debuted in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels.

==Films==

=== Cinema ===

Two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; movies produced by Max J. Rosenberg and Milton Subotsky were released in the mid-1960s, loosely adapted on the first two Dalek serials: &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965) and &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966). Neither film takes place in televised continuity. They both star Peter Cushing as Dr. Who, a human scientist who invents a time machine, &quot;Tardis&quot;, with early companions Ian, Barbara and Susan, also reimagined.

From 1987 to 1994, the Daltenreys group, George Dugdale, Peter Mackenzie Litten and John Humphreys, also tried to develop a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; movie for theatrical release, the script for which was worked on for a time by Johnny Byrne, who had previously worked on the television series. The license for this reverted to the BBC before the film neared production. The book &quot;The Nth Doctor&quot; by Jean-Marc Lofficier (Virgin Publishing, 1997) includes synopses of several proposed film story treatments, including those by Byrne.

Following K9, a second series was planned but was canceled in favor of a film titled &quot;K9: TimeQuake&quot;, set to release in 2017. In September 2018, it was announced the film had been delayed due to &quot;a new multimillion dollar series&quot; in partnership with a major US/UK company, intended to reestablish the &quot;K9 brand&quot; before the film. In December 2020, &quot;Megabytes&quot;, an anthology book featuring K9, was released, which was teased as being &quot;the road to TimeQuake.&quot; When Bob Baker died in November 2021, the official Twitter page released a statement saying &quot;Bob had recently completed scripts for both a new K9 film and TV series, which will continue in tribute to Bob and his legacy,&quot;, however, as of December 2024, this was the final message posted on the account and there is no other information available to suggest the project is still active.

The hunger for more &quot;Doctor Who&quot; on television, especially between the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1989 and its return in 2005, was partly answered by direct-to-video productions by various companies. The BBC has never authorised any &quot;Doctor Who&quot; video productions but production companies have been able to license individual characters and alien races from the show directly from the writers who created them, and feature them in adventures of their own.

Companies who have released videos of this kind include Reeltime Pictures (also known for the long-running &quot;Myth Makers&quot; series of documentaries) and BBV (who have also released a number of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-related audio adventures on the same basis). The first spinoff of this nature was &quot;Wartime&quot;, a half-hour film produced by Reeltime in the late 1980s and starring John Levene as Benton, a UNIT soldier who appeared on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the early to mid-1970s. In the 1990s, Reeltime distributed &quot;P.R.O.B.E.&quot;, a series of four made-for-video movies featuring Caroline John as her Pertwee-era character Liz Shaw. BBV, on their part, produced and released a trilogy of movies, &quot;Auton&quot;, &quot;Auton 2: Sentinel&quot; and &quot;Auton 3: Awakening&quot; that featured UNIT battling the Nestene Consciousness. Author Terrance Dicks also wrote and produced &quot;&quot; in 1994, which not only featured the reappearance of one of the series&#x27; most famous monsters, but also starred series alums Carole Ann Ford, Sophie Aldred and Michael Wisher. Jan Chappell played Lisa Deranne, captain of the solar racing yacht &quot;Tiger Moth&quot;, whose shakedown cruise is interrupted by a Sontaran attack squad furiously searching for a Rutan infiltrator. Another spinoff, &quot;Downtime&quot;, featured the return of Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier (Ret.) Lethbridge-Stewart and Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, along with Deborah Watling as Troughton-era companion Victoria Waterfield. More of a nostalgia trip for fans than anything, &quot;Downtime&quot; provided a more detailed look at Lethbridge-Stewart&#x27;s family and legacy than had ever been seen before. Reeltime Pictures also produced three other &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-universe related videos, &quot;Dæmos Rising&quot;, &quot;Mindgame&quot; and &quot;Mindgame Trilogy&quot;. In November 2016 they want to release &quot;White Witch of Devil&#x27;s End&quot;, a Reeltime Pictures independent drama starring Damaris Hayman as Olive Hawthorne, who made her original appearance in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the Jon Pertwee story &quot;The Dæmons&quot;.

In 1998 a video was released called &quot;Lust in Space&quot; in which the &quot;Time Assizes&quot; (Time Lords) put &quot;Doctor Who&quot; on trial for sexism. If it is found to be sexist, then it will be removed from history. None of the actors who had played the part of the Doctor took part. The &quot;evidence&quot; for the trial consists of short clips of interviews of some of the Doctor&#x27;s female companions. Katy Manning (Jo Grant) and Sophie Aldred (Ace) are brought through time and space to testify in court. Former writers and producers such as Terrance Dicks and John Nathan-Turner are cross examined through video interviews on their part in making the show &quot;sexist&quot;. There are no clips from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the video. In 2008 the BBV film &quot;&quot; was released. It features Zygons.

BBV is also known for a number of productions that, while not using any elements from the show itself, tell a similar style of story and feature ex-&quot;Doctor Who&quot; stars in roles similar to those they played in the series; these include a direct-to-video series starring Colin Baker as &quot;The Stranger&quot;, and a separate series of audio dramas starring Sylvester McCoy as &quot;The Dominie&quot;. In later episodes of &quot;The Stranger&quot;, it was made clear that not only was the Stranger not the Doctor but that their backgrounds were not even remotely analogous. Some of this clarification appears to have been the result of BBC pressure. Next to this they also released:
* Doctor Who parodies (&quot;Do You Have A Licence To Save This Planet?&quot;)
* Films and Audio Books that use elements that are very close to Doctor Who, but the names were changed to keep the BBC at bay (video: &quot;Cyberon&quot;, &quot;The Stranger&quot;; audio: &quot;The Dominie and Alice&quot;, &quot;Fred&quot; , &quot;Cyberons&quot;, &quot;Infidel&#x27;s Comet&quot;, &quot;The Pattern&quot;)
* Films that have no connection to Doctor Who besides the actors: &quot;The Airzone Solution&quot; (Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant, Peter Davison, Sylvester McCoy, Jon Pertwee), &quot;Souls&#x27; Ark&quot; (Colin Baker, Wendy Padbury, Carole Ann Ford)

Some contributors to these independent productions in the 1990s later contributed to the television series after its return. They include writer/performers Mark Gatiss and Nicholas Briggs and novelist/modelmaker Mike Tucker.

== Audio ==

Many audio productions based upon &quot;Doctor Who&quot; have been produced over the years. The first, in 1976, was a children&#x27;s audio adventure entitled &quot;Doctor Who and the Pescatons&quot; by Victor Pemberton.

In 1985, during a period when the series was on a sabbatical at the BBC, BBC Radio hired Colin Baker and his TV companion Nicola Bryant to reprise their TV roles for a new production called &quot;Slipback&quot;.

In the 1990s, the BBC began issuing the soundtracks of serials from the 1960s on cassette and compact disc; initially these were the &quot;lost&quot; episodes, but have also included serials from the 1970s and 1980s. There were also two further radio dramas: &quot;The Paradise of Death&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Ghosts of N-Space&quot; (1996), both featuring Jon Pertwee, which like &quot;Slipback&quot; were first broadcast on BBC Radio.

Beginning in 1999, Big Finish Productions, under licence from the BBC, began a range of audio plays on compact disc, with one released every month. Big Finish have also produced a limited-run series of audio plays based around one of the Doctor&#x27;s former television companions, Sarah Jane Smith, as well as a limited &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; series that explores possibilities contrary to the established mythos (for instance, &quot;What if the Doctor had never left Gallifrey?&quot;). From 6 August 2005, several of the Eighth Doctor audio dramas are being broadcast on the digital radio station BBC Radio 4 Extra—these are &quot;Storm Warning&quot;, &quot;Sword of Orion&quot;, &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot;, &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot;, &quot;Shada&quot; and &quot;The Chimes of Midnight&quot;. A new series of original audio dramas featuring the Eighth Doctor and new companion Lucie Miller began airing on BBC7 on 31 December 2006. These are &quot;Blood of the Daleks&quot;, &quot;Horror of Glam Rock&quot;, &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot;, &quot;Phobos&quot;, &quot;No More Lies&quot; and &quot;Human Resources&quot;. A second series of audios featuring the Eighth Doctor and Lucie Miller were broadcast on BBC7 in 2009, having first been released on CD by Big Finish Productions.

In 2009 and 2010, Big Finish Productions released further series of &quot;old&quot; material, firstly audio versions of Doctor Who stage plays from the 1960s to 1980s. This was followed by the &quot;lost&quot; season 23 featuring the Sixth Doctor—these were scripts originally written for the season that was cancelled before returning in the Trial of a Time Lord. The second season of The Lost Stories, to be released in 2010, includes audio versions of unmade episodes featuring the First Doctor and Second Doctor, the original &quot;Dalek&quot; pilot made for US television, and stories originally commissioned for the cancelled season 27 featuring the Seventh Doctor.

There are also several other &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-related audio mini-series including &quot;Dalek Empire&quot;, &quot;Dalek Empire II: Dalek War&quot; and &quot;Dalek Empire III&quot;, &quot;Gallifrey&quot;, &quot;UNIT&quot;, &quot;Kaldor City&quot; and &quot;Faction Paradox Protocols&quot;. Several of these audio productions were commissioned by and broadcast by the BBC, albeit on radio (in particular &quot;Slipback&quot;, the Pertwee serials, and the more recent BBC7 McGann series).

Produced by AudioGo, a Tenth Doctor story, &#x27;Dead Air&#x27; by James Goss, won Best Audiobook of the Year Award in 2010.

In April 2022, BBC Sounds began airing &quot;Doctor Who: Redacted&quot;, a ten-episode podcast written by Juno Dawson and starring Charlie Craggs and featuring Jodie Whittaker as the thirteenth Doctor. A second, six-episode season aired in late 2023 with Dawson once again writing the show and Craggs, Chimimba and Holly Quin-Ankrah returning. &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; actors Alexander Armstrong and Anjli Mohindra joined the second season cast.

== Stage ==
The universe of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has been adapted several times for the stage.

The earliest such production was &quot;The Curse of the Daleks&quot;, written by David Whitaker and Terry Nation and directed by Gillian Howell, which played at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre over the December 1965 to January 1966 Christmas theatre season. Whitaker&#x27;s play was intended to link the televised serials &quot;The Daleks&quot; and &quot;Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; and elements later appeared in the &quot;Daleks&quot; comic strip that later ran in &quot;TV21&quot;.

The Daleks also play a major role in the first produced stageplay to feature the Doctor. &quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday&quot; was written by Terrance Dicks and directed by Mick Hughes and ran at London&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre over the 1974–75 Christmas season and was expected to tour England until April 1975. However, the tour was cancelled at the eleventh hour. Trevor Martin played an alternate version of the Fourth Doctor in this play, which takes place immediately after the Third Doctor&#x27;s regeneration in &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot; (the play was staged before Tom Baker&#x27;s official debut as the Fourth Doctor in early 1975 although Baker had appeared at the close of &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot;). The play co-starred former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companion Wendy Padbury (playing a different character named Jenny). Also in the cast was Simon Jones as the &quot;Master of Karn&quot;, several years before he worked with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; writer Douglas Adams on &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. The play was not well attended by audiences as it debuted during an upswing of IRA violence in London.

UNIT was the focus of &quot;Recall UNIT (or, The Great Tea Bag Mystery)&quot;, a play mounted in August 1984 at the Moray House Theatre in Edinburgh. The play was directed and co-written by Richard Franklin, who had played Mike Yates in the series, and he reprised the role for the play, along with John Levene who returned as Sergeant Benton. The Daleks once again returned, as did Nicholas Courtney whose recorded voice allowed Brigadier Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart to also take part in the play, albeit off-stage.

&quot;Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure&quot; was mounted at Wimbledon Theatre in London for several months starting in March 1989. This musical play paired the Doctor with a set of new companions in a battle against not only the Daleks but the Cybermen as well. Jon Pertwee initially starred in the play for the first half of its run, reprising the Third Doctor. For the second half of the run, Colin Baker starred as the Sixth Doctor. For two performances during Pertwee&#x27;s tenure, David Banks (best known for playing various Cybermen in the TV series) played the Doctor when Pertwee fell ill.

From October to November 2010, &quot;Doctor Who Live&quot; toured in arenas across Britain.

In July 2011, as part of the Manchester International Festival, a live production &quot;The Crash of the Elysium&quot; ran in and around the new BBC developments in Media City. This was an interactive play, aimed at children, where the actors lead the audience through the set, with set-piece events occurring at various points. It featured filmed footage of the Eleventh Doctor, and weeping angels.

== Webcasts ==
A series of audio plays have also been webcast on bbc.co.uk, beginning with &quot;Death Comes to Time&quot; in 2001. The first episode had been made for, and then turned down by, BBC Radio 4 and after an experimental webcasting of this pilot generated over a million page hits, the rest of the episodes were produced and webcast. The serial featured Sylvester McCoy reprising his role as the Seventh Doctor.

Despite Death Comes to Time&#x27;s award-winning success, political wrangling behind the scenes meant the next two serials made specially for webcasts were by Big Finish Productions: &quot;Real Time&quot; (2002), with the Sixth Doctor versus the Cybermen and &quot;Shada&quot; (2003), with Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor in a script originally written by Douglas Adams and intended for the Fourth Doctor Tom Baker in 1979, but abandoned halfway through filming back then due to a BBC staff strike.

Although all of these adventures were intended as purely audio and were later released on CD, as webcasts they were accompanied by a slideshow of partially animated illustrations drawn by artist Lee Sullivan. &quot;Death Comes to Time&quot; was also released as a special MP3 CD with interactive content, including an option to view the illustrations as well as other bonus material such as cast and crew interviews that were originally available online.

In the middle of 2003, BBCi initiated plans to bring webcast production back in-house, producing the all-new adventure &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot; by Paul Cornell, starring Richard E. Grant as the Ninth Doctor and Derek Jacobi as the Master. This differed from the previous webcasts in that it was specifically an audio-visual experience and not an audio adventure: it was fully animated to broadcast standard (although the webcast version was slightly simplified for that medium) by Cosgrove Hall Films and webcast over five weeks in November and December 2003.

The adventures were originally intended to be an official continuation of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; mythos, and Grant was, for a brief time, touted as the New Doctor. However, with the announcement of the new BBC television series, &quot;Shalka&quot; was relegated to non-official status, and Russell T Davies, producer of the 2005 revival series, has referred to Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor. Plans for further webcasts were shelved.

== Merchandise ==
&quot;Doctor Who&quot; has generated many hundreds of products related to the show since its beginnings in the 1960s, from toys and games to picture cards and postage stamps.

<text>Alison Margaret Arngrim (born January 18, 1962) is an American actress and author. Beginning her television career at the age of twelve, Arngrim is a Young Artist Award–Former Child Star &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; Award honoree, best known for her portrayal of Nellie Oleson on the NBC television series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; from 1974 to 1982.

==Early life==
Arngrim&#x27;s father, Thor Arngrim, was a Canadian-born Hollywood manager. Her mother, Norma MacMillan of Vancouver, British Columbia, was an actress who provided the voices for characters for: Casper on &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot;, Gumby on &quot;Gumby&quot;, Davey on &quot;Davey and Goliath&quot;, Sweet Polly Purebred on &quot;Underdog&quot;, and other animated children&#x27;s programs.

Her brother Stefan (b. 1955) was also a child actor, perhaps best known for his role as Barry Lockridge on the Irwin Allen science fiction television series, &quot;Land of the Giants&quot;. 

Arngrim claimed that her brother sexually molested her from age six until nine, when he was aged from 13 to 16 years old. She also claimed that her brother admitted to the abuse but isn&#x27;t particularly apologetic for his behavior. Arngrim stated that she no longer has any kind of relationship with her brother, a decision she reports has bettered her life.

==Acting career==
After beginning a career as a child model and actress in television commercials, Arngrim rose to fame as a child star in 1974, portraying the role of Nellie Oleson on the NBC television series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. She originally auditioned for the role of Laura Ingalls and, later, Mary Ingalls, but was instead cast in the role of antagonist Nellie Oleson. Arngrim would play the role of Nellie for seven seasons and her portrayal became a cultural reference and camp archetype for the spoiled &quot;bad girl&quot; throughout the 1970s.

Years later, in one of her stand-up routines, Arngrim described playing Nellie on &quot;Little House on The Prairie&quot; as &quot;like having PMS for seven years.&quot; In 2002, she was honored by the Young Artist Foundation with its Former Child Star &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; Award for her work as a child actress on &quot;Little House&quot;. At the 2006 TV Land Awards, Arngrim tied with Danielle Spencer (&#x27;Dee&#x27; on &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;) as the &quot;Character Most in Need of a Time-out&quot; for her role as Nellie.

In addition to her role on &quot;Little House&quot;, Arngrim also recorded the 1977 comedy record album, &quot;Heeere&#x27;s Amy&quot; on Laff Records, where she impersonates President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s daughter Amy . Her mother, who voiced the Kennedy children on the comedy albums of Vaughn Meader, also guest starred on the album. After leaving &quot;Little House&quot;, Arngrim appeared in guest-starring roles on such television series as &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. She was also a frequent panelist on the short-lived NBC game show &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot;.

Starting in 2006, she developed a successful career on stage in France, with her friend, author/director/comedian Patrick Loubatière. In 2017 in Pinehurst, North Carolina she appeared as Emily Brent in Judson Theatre Company&#x27;s production of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
In addition to performing, Arngrim also devotes her time to charitable organizations. One of her inspirations for her charity work is the memory of her friend and fellow actor Steve Tracy, who played the role of Nellie Oleson&#x27;s husband, Percival Dalton, on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. Tracy died from complications of AIDS in 1986, after which Arngrim set her sights on becoming an activist for AIDS awareness including the organization ACT UP and working at AIDS hotline. She also focuses on other issues, such as child abuse, speaking frequently for and lobbying with the group PROTECT. In 2004, Arngrim revealed on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; that she herself was an incest survivor.

==Author==
In 2010, Arngrim authored an autobiography titled &quot;Confessions of a Prairie Bitch: How I Survived Nellie Oleson and Learned to Love Being Hated&quot;. In the book she, for the first time, publicly identified her then-teenaged brother as her childhood abuser, though the book is mostly light-hearted and received critical praise for her ability to mix humor and personal tragedy. She wrote and performed a stage version, which premiered at Club Fez in New York. She later performed this one-person show at Parliament House, a gay resort in Orlando, Florida.

<doc id="804257" wikidata="Q3444893" url="?curid=804257" title="Macro-Siouan languages">
<text>The Macro-Siouan languages are a proposed language family that includes the Siouan, Iroquoian, and Caddoan families. Most linguists remain unconvinced that these languages share a genetic relationship, and the existence of a Macro-Siouan language family remains a subject of debate.

In the 19th century, Robert Latham suggested that the Siouan languages are related to the Caddoan and Iroquoian languages. In 1931, Louis Allen presented the first list of systematic correspondences between a set of 25 lexical items in Siouan and Iroquoian. In the 1960s and 1970s, Wallace Chafe further explored the link between Siouan and Caddoan languages. In the 1990s, Marianne Mithun compared the morphology and syntax of all the three families. At present, the Macro-Siouan hypothesis based on relations among Siouan, Caddoan, and Iroquoian is not universally accepted as proven.

==Vocabulary==
Below is a comparison of selected basic vocabulary items in Proto-Siouan, Proto-Iroquoian, and Pawnee (a Caddoan language).

<text>Jeff Smith (born February 27, 1960) is an American cartoonist. He is best known as the creator of the self-published comic book series &quot;Bone&quot;.

==Early life==
Jeff Smith was born in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania to William Earl Smith and Barbara Goodsell. He grew up in Columbus, Ohio.

Smith learned about cartooning through comic strips, comic books, and animated TV shows. The strip he found to be the most entertaining was Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts.&quot; His father read it to him every Sunday, and it inspired him to learn to read. Smith was also inspired by Scrooge McDuck creator Carl Barks, whom Smith calls a &quot;natural comic genius&quot; for his ability to move characters effectively from panel to panel, and for their expressiveness. Alluding to the influence of Barks on &quot;Bone&quot;, Smith commented, &quot;I always wanted Uncle Scrooge to go on a longer adventure. I thought, &#x27;Man, if you could just get a comic book of that quality, the length of say, &quot;War and Peace&quot;, or &quot;The Odyssey&quot; or something, that would be something I would love to read, and even as a kid I looked everywhere for that book, that Uncle Scrooge story that was 1,100 pages long.&quot; Another seminal influence was the television program &quot;The Pogo Special Birthday Special&quot;, which Smith saw at age nine. The show was created by Walt Kelly and Chuck Jones, whom Smith later called &quot;two of my most favorite people&quot;. The day after that program aired, a girl brought her father&#x27;s &quot;Pogo&quot; book to school and gave it to Smith, who says it &quot;changed comics&quot; for him. Smith keeps that book on a table next to his drawing board to this day, and refers to Kelly as his &quot;biggest influence in writing comics&quot;.

Smith has cited &quot;Moby Dick&quot; as his favorite book, citing its multi-layered narrative and symbolism, and placed numerous references to it in &quot;Bone&quot;. He has also cited &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; as a story after which he attempted to pattern &quot;Bone&quot; structurally, explaining, &quot;the kinds of stories I’m drawn to, like &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, are the ones that start off very simple, almost like children’s stories...but as it goes on, it gets a little darker, and the themes become a little more sophisticated and more complex—and those are really the kinds of stories that just get me going.&quot; Other influences in this regard include the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the classic fairy tales and mythologies that inspired those works.

Smith says the earliest forerunner drawings of what later became Bone and his cousins occurred when he was about five, and sitting in his living room drawing, and he drew what looked like an old C-shaped telephone handset receiver, which emerged as a frowning character with its mouth wide open. Elements of that character and its demeanor found their way into the character Phoney Bone, the upset cousin to Bone. His name is derived from Fonebone, the generic surname that Don Martin gave to many of the characters that appeared in his &quot;Mad&quot; magazine strips. Smith began to create comics with the &quot;Bone&quot; characters as early as 1970, when he was about 9 years old.

 Smith graduated in 1978 from Worthington High School in Worthington, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, where he was a classmate of Jim Kammerud. Later on, in 1986, Smith and Kammerud co-founded Character Builders, an animation studio in Columbus where Smith worked until 1992. After high school, Smith attended the Ohio State University, and while there he created a comic strip called &quot;Thorn&quot; for the student newspaper, &quot;The Lantern&quot;, which included some of the characters who later featured in the &quot;Bone&quot; series. He also studied animation.

==Career==
After graduating from college, Smith and his two friends, Jim Kammerud and Marty Fuller, started an animation studio called Character Builders Inc. Their first paid job was producing a 60-second animated opening for the TV series &quot;Super Safari with Jack Hanna&quot;. Other jobs followed for clients such as White Castle, sequences in films that the studio was given when other studios fell behind, and a claymation project that they were given following the rise in popularity of The California Raisins. Initial budgets were restrictive for the studio, which required the animators to be resourceful in order to meet their deadlines. Smith sometimes did the voice work as well as the animation on certain projects, and the animators sometimes had family members come in on some evenings to paint animation cells. Though Smith found the projects exciting, he realized that it was not the type of cartooning he wanted to do, which was complicated by periods in which the studio had no work. It was during one of these slow periods that Smith reconsidered his career. Drawn to the idea that he could produce his own animated-type story but in the comics medium, and convinced by Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot; and Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Watchmen&quot; that a serious comic book with a beginning, middle and end structure was both artistically and commercially viable, Smith decided to produce &quot;Bone&quot;.
In 1991, Smith launched his company, Cartoon Books, in order to publish the series. Initially, Smith self-published the book, which meant that he did all the work required to both produce and distribute the series as a business, including answering letters, doing all the graphics and lettering (which he did by hand), sending the artwork to the printer, handling orders and bookkeeping. This made it difficult to focus on writing and drawing the book, and as a result, he fell behind in his production. To remedy this, he asked his wife, Vijaya, to quit her lucrative job at a Silicon Valley startup company in order to run the business side of Bone as the President of Cartoon Books. As a result, Smith was able to refocus on drawing, and sales improved. Smith published 55 issues of &quot;Bone&quot; between 1991 and 2004. The black and white comic book proved very successful, and has been collected in a number of trade paperback and hardback collections, including a series of nine books that collect all 55 issues, originally published by Cartoon Books in black and white, and later reissued in color by the Graphix imprint of Scholastic. In 2004, when Cartoon Books released a &quot;mammoth&quot; one-volume black and white collection of the entire nine-volume series, &quot;Time&quot; critic Andrew Arnold called &quot;Bone&quot; &quot;the best all-ages graphic novel yet published&quot;.

In 1994 Smith created an original cover for Dan DeBono&#x27;s &quot;Indy: The Independent Comic Guide&quot; (issue 13), and was interviewed to help to promote his and other alternative comics. Two additional volumes, &quot;Stupid, Stupid Rat Tails&quot; and &quot;Rose&quot;, collect a number of &quot;Bone&quot; prequel comics created by Smith and his collaborators.

In 1995 French publisher Delcourt acquired the rights to translate Bone into French. The translator of the first four French volumes was Alain Ayroles who would be inspired by Smith&#x27;s storytelling and go on to write the very successful Garulfo series, among others.

In 2003, Smith began work for DC Comics on a miniseries starring Captain Marvel, a superhero of which Smith is a fan. The series, entitled &quot;Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil&quot;, was published in four prestige format issues in 2007, and later collected into a hardcover edition.

In 2007, Fantagraphics Books named Smith as the designer for an upcoming series of books collecting the complete run of Walt Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Pogo&quot;. He also designed the cover art for Say Anything&#x27;s album &quot;In Defense of the Genre&quot;.

Smith released the first issue of &quot;RASL&quot;, &quot;a stark, sci-fi series about a dimension-jumping art thief with personal problems&quot;, in February, 2008. A six-page preview was shown on the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con. Originally intending &quot;RASL&quot; to be released in an oversized format, Smith consulted with retailers who unanimously cautioned him against the unconventional size. Smith later self-published &quot;RASL&quot; as a standard-sized, ad-free, black and white comic book. The first trade paperback, titled &quot;The Drift&quot;, is in stores in the originally intended oversized format.

Smith&#x27;s art was featured in a pair of museum shows in Columbus in mid-2008: &quot;Jeff Smith: Bone and Beyond&quot; at the Wexner Center for the Arts, and &quot;Jeff Smith: Before Bone&quot; at the Cartoon Research Library of Ohio State University. The exhibits were featured in a segment on the PBS news program &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot; on July 21, 2008.

In 2009, Smith was featured in &quot;The Cartoonist: Jeff Smith, BONE, and the Changing Face of Comics,&quot; a documentary film on his life and work.

In September that same year, Toon Books, the children&#x27;s book line launched by cartoonist Art Spiegelman and &quot;New Yorker&quot; art editor Françoise Mouly, released &quot;Little Mouse Gets Ready&quot;, a 32-page children&#x27;s graphic novel written by Smith and aimed at very young &quot;emerging readers&quot;. In a February 2009 Newsarama interview, Smith noted that the book featured another character Smith created in his childhood, &quot;a little gray mouse with a little red vest&quot;.

In March 2013, Smith said his next project would be a webcomic series called &quot;Tüki: Save the Humans&quot;, which tells the story of the first human to leave Africa. The web publication began in November 2013 and the print version was first released in July 2014. The fourth issue was delayed due to a hand injury, sustained by Smith, but after its release in February 2016 the series was put on hiatus in June 2016 due to the need to rework the strip.

From 2013 to 2018, Smith served on the board of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, a non-profit organization founded in 1986 chartered to protect the First Amendment rights of the comics community.

Smith helped found the annual Cartoon Crossroads Columbus festival, which debuted in 2015. He serves as artistic director of the convention.

==Personal life==
Smith lives in Columbus, Ohio, with his wife and business manager, Vijaya Iyer.

On August 13, 2023, Smith suffered a cardiac arrest. As a result, the remainder of his book tour was cancelled.

==Awards and accolades==
For his work on &quot;Bone&quot;, Smith has received numerous awards, among them ten Eisner Awards and eleven Harvey Awards. In 1995 and 1996 he won the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s award for Comic Books.

In 2022 &quot;Tuki: Fight for Fire&quot; was included in the American Library Association&#x27;s list of the Best Graphic Novels for Adults Reading List.

<text>Gustavs Celmiņš (April 1, 1899 – April 10, 1968) was a Latvian politician, who was the founder of the ultranationalist, anti-German, anti-Slavic, and antisemitic political party Pērkonkrusts.

==Biography==
He was educated at the commerce school of the Riga Stock Exchange, and graduated in Moscow. In 1917, he began studies at the Riga Polytechnical Institute which had been evacuated to Moscow. After the October Revolution, he returned to Latvia.

In 1918, Celmiņš enlisted into the newly created Latvian Army, and was promoted to lieutenant the following year, and was then appointed Latvian military attaché in Poland. In 1921, he was awarded the Order of Lāčplēsis.

Retired from army in 1924, he worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1925 to 1927. Celmiņš became the secretary of Minister of Foreign Affairs, and subsequently worked in the Finance Ministry. On 24 January 1932, the Latvian nationalist group &quot;&quot; was founded, and Gustavs Celmiņš was elected as its leader. After &quot;Ugunskrusts&quot; was banned, he founded the ultranationalistic organization &quot;Pērkonkrusts&quot;. Common for both organisations was that they advocated a national revolution for a radical re-organisation of society, politics, and the economy in Latvia. Following the 1934 Latvian coup d&#x27;état, Celmiņš was arrested and imprisoned for three years.

He was exiled from Latvia in 1937. Celmiņš moved to Italy, then Switzerland. While in Zürich, he was arrested and then banished from Switzerland. He later lived in Romania, where he had contacts with the Iron Guard, and then moved to Finland. In 1938, he became the leader of &quot;Pērkonkrusts&quot;&#x27; &quot;foreign contacts office&quot;. After the Soviet Union invaded Finland, Celmiņš enrolled as a volunteer on the Finnish side. When the conflict ended, he moved to Nazi Germany.

In July 1941, after Operation Barbarossa, together with Nazi officials, Celmiņš returned to Latvia and briefly regained leadership of &quot;Pērkonkrusts&quot;. After the German occupation authorities banned &quot;Pērkonkrusts&quot; a month later, Celmiņš continued his outward collaboration with the Germans in the hopes that sizable Latvian military formations would be created. From February 1942, he headed the Committee for Organising Latvian Volunteers (), the main function of which was the recruitment of Latvian men for the Latvian Auxiliary Police Battalions, known in German as &quot;Schutzmannschaften&quot; or simply &quot;Schuma&quot;. Aside from front-line combat duties, some of these battalions were also deployed in anti-partisan operations in Latvia and Belarus that included the massacres of rural Jews and other civilians. This situation was not what Celmiņš had hoped for, and so he began to sabotage the recruitment efforts. Because of this, he was later transferred to a job as a minor clerk within the occupation administration.

&quot;Pērkonkrusts&quot; members working within the SD apparatus in occupied Latvia would feed Celmiņš information, some of which he would include in his underground, anti-German publication &quot;Brīvā Latvija&quot;. This eventually led to Celmiņš and his associates being arrested by the Gestapo in 1944, with Celmiņš ending up imprisoned in Flossenbürg concentration camp.

In late April 1945, he was, together with other prominent concentration camp inmates, transferred to Tyrol where the SS left the prisoners behind. He was liberated by the Fifth U.S. Army on 5 May 1945.

After World War II, he lived in Italy, where he published the newspaper &quot;Brīvā Latvija&quot;. In 1947, he published the autobiographic book &quot;Eiropas krustceļos&quot; (&quot;At the Crossroads of Europe&quot;).

In 1949, he emigrated to the United States. From 1950 to 1952 he was an instructor at Syracuse University&#x27;s Armed Forces school in New York state, and beginning in 1951 he was also the director of the Foreign Language program for the US Air Force, and a television lecturer about the USSR and communism. From 1954 to 1956 he worked as a manufacturer in Mexico. Between 1956 and 1958 he was a librarian at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. In 1959 he became a professor of Russian studies at St. Mary&#x27;s University in San Antonio, Texas. He died on April 10, 1968, in San Antonio, Texas.

<text>A1 (stylised as a1) is a British–Norwegian boy group formed in 1998.

Their debut single, &quot;Be the First to Believe&quot;, entered the UK singles chart at number six in mid-1999. They achieved chart success in the UK and other parts of the world in the late 1990s and early 2000s, particularly Southeast Asia. In the UK, they scored two number ones and six other top 10 hits, seven of which were written by the band. Adding to this, they won a Brit Award for &quot;British Breakthrough Act&quot; in 2001. They were managed by band manager Tim Byrne, who also formed Steps.

Marazzi left the band in 2002, citing personal reasons. The three remaining members subsequently decided to split due to exhaustion from being on the road for the best part of four years straight.

In December 2009, Ingebrigtsen, Read and Adams reformed a1, without Marazzi, in Norway for a series of concerts at the Christiania Theatre in Oslo. Since their comeback, they have released new singles as well as their fourth and fifth studio albums, &quot;Waiting for Daylight&quot;, in 2010, and &quot;Rediscovered&quot;, in 2012.

In 2014, A1 appeared on the ITV2 documentary &quot;The Big Reunion&quot; along with other bands such as Eternal, Damage, Girl Thing, 3T and a band called 5th Story, made up of Dane Bowers (from Another Level), Gareth Gates, Kenzie (from Blazin&#x27; Squad), Kavana, and Adam Rickitt.

==History==
===1998: Formation===
Paul Marazzi, who had missed the cut for Steps, met Tim Byrne in 1998 to talk about forming a second group. Auditions were held where Christian Ingebrigtsen, Mark Read, and Ben Adams were recruited and the band was formed by the management team of Byrne and Vicky Blood.

===1999: &quot;Here We Come&quot;===
A1 signed with Columbia Records in February 1999 and released &quot;Be the First to Believe&quot; in Summer 1999. In November they released &quot;Here We Come&quot;, which reached number 4 in Norway and had four top ten singles in the UK.

===2000–2001: &quot;The A List&quot;===
In 2000, they achieved two number ones with &quot;Take On Me&quot; and &quot;Same Old Brand New You&quot;. The video for their seventh single, &quot;No More&quot;, was filmed in Singapore while they were on tour there. In 2001, the band began a massive arena tour of Asia, where they were very well received. During a mall signing in Indonesia, four teenage girls were killed in a stampede. In 2001, Sony Music launched a paid subscription service for a1 called &#x27;Access All Areas&#x27;, the first for an artist signed to the company. This was an early version of a social network allowing fans to meet and chat online.

===2002: &quot;Make It Good&quot;, Marazzi&#x27;s departure and split ===
Their third album, &quot;Make It Good&quot; saw a change of direction in their musical style but was to be their last studio project. On 8 October 2002, Marazzi left the group, citing personal reasons, and a1 subsequently decided to split.

===2002–2009: Post A1 and solo careers===
In January 2004 a &quot;Best of A1&quot; album was released in Asia; a compilation featuring all of their singles, two previously unreleased concert recordings, and three exclusive B-Sides. In 2009, following Adams&#x27; appearance on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, the band released its &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; in the UK.

In 2005, Adams went on to release his first solo single, &quot;Sorry&quot;, which peaked at number 18 on the UK singles chart. Adams was also due to record an album but parted with his record label. In 2009, he appeared as a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, eventually placing fifth. He attracted much attention later that same year when he posed naked for the cover of &quot;Attitude&quot;.

In 2003, Ingebrigtsen also began a solo career, with his first solo single, &quot;In Love With an Angel&quot;, being released in 2004. The single stayed in the Top 10 of the Norway Singles Chart for nearly three months. The song was swiftly followed by &quot;Things Are Gonna Change&quot;, which became Ingebrigsten&#x27;s final solo single before he moved into other areas of showbusiness.

In 2002, Read focused on becoming a songwriter for other artists, after signing a deal with Metrophonic. Read has written for artists such as Charlotte Church, Boyzone, Michael Bolton, Robin Gibb, and The Hollies. Read released his debut solo single, &quot;Greatest Lady in My Life&quot;, on 2 March 2009. His debut solo album, &quot;Peace at Last&quot; was released in June 2009.

Months after he left the band, Marazzi hosted the Andy Cole Children&#x27;s Foundation (now All Star Kids) on 26 April 2003 together with Jo Good. He turned down the offer to appear in I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2004. In late 2005 he formed a soul/rock band in Sunderland, Northeast England called Snagsby. He left the band in early 2009. Marazzi then went to work in The George Hotel in Whitby as a club DJ.

===2009–2010: Reunion as a trio and &quot;Waiting for Daylight&quot;===
In November 2008, the remaining members of the band formed a Myspace account to keep fans updated of their current situation. In summer 2009, the band made an official announcement, stating that not only were they to reform, but they were to play a series of concerts in Oslo in December of that year. Marazzi posted on his Facebook that he wished them good luck when he found out about his former bandmates&#x27; reunion on a TV show in Norway. The announcement also stated that the band&#x27;s first new single in seven years, &quot;Take You Home&quot;, would be released via iTunes in Norway on 2 November. The single entered the Norway Singles Chart at No. 9, based on download sales. It was announced in late 2009 that the band would compete to represent Norway in the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest, with the band&#x27;s second single since their reformation, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Lose You Again&quot;. The song peaked at No. 4 on the Norwegian Singles Chart. The band reached the national final of the contest and finished in second place. Incidentally, Adams would go on to represent Norway in the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest as one half of Subwoolfer finishing in 10th place in the grand final with the song Give That Wolf a Banana.The band made their official UK comeback on New Year&#x27;s Eve by performing at the Heaven New Year&#x27;s Eve Party in London. In March 2010, the band embarked on a worldwide tour that began in Norway, with performances in Oslo, Stavanger, Kristiansand, Bergen, Trondheim and Haugesund. The tour extended to Europe and ROTW in autumn 2010. The band&#x27;s first new studio album since 2002 was released on 11 October 2010, and includes the singles &quot;Take You Home&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Lose You Again&quot;, &quot;In Love and I Hate It&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Daylight&quot;.

===2011–2012: &quot;Rediscovered&quot;===
In October 2011, the group appeared on Channel 5&#x27;s OK TV to promote their British comeback gig at the O2 Academy Islington on 31 October 2011. The gig received positive reviews from sites such as &quot;This Must Be Pop&quot; and Time Out. On 18 November 2011, the band released a single, &quot;Another Year Gone&quot;. On 28 February 2012, the group performed at the Singapore Indoor Stadium with Blue and Jeff Timmons from 98 Degrees. The concert was entitled &quot;The Greatest Hits Tour: Blue, Jeff Timmons of 98 Degrees and a1 – Live in Singapore.&quot; They also visited Jakarta, Indonesia and Manila, Philippines as part of the concert tour. On 8 May 2012, the band announced the release of a new single, &quot;Just Three Words&quot;, a duet with Annie Khalid.

===2013–2014: &quot;The Big Reunion&quot; ===
In December 2013 it was announced that A1 would be appearing, again without Marazzi, on the ITV2 documentary &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;. In October 2014, A1 with other bands from the TV show Blue, Five, Damage, 3T, 911 and a new band called 5th Story toured together in October 2014, the tour was called The Big Reunion Boy Band Tour 2014.

On 3 October 2014 A1 performed on the Norwegian show called &quot;The Hit&quot;, choosing to perform the song &quot;Physical Love&quot; written by Mathilde Johnson, which became the single &quot;Critical Love&quot; after winning.

Their latest albums &quot;Waiting for Daylight&quot; and &quot;Rediscovered&quot; were released in UK on 12 June 2015.

===2016–2017: Comeback concert===
A1 gave a concert on 22 October 2016 in Singapore and in Manila and Cebu on 23 and 25 October, respectively.

===2017–present: Marazzi&#x27;s return and 20th-anniversary tour===
On 22 July 2017 Paul Marazzi met with his past band-mates in Newcastle. On an Instagram post of the band, the group posted a picture with all four original members Ben Adams, Christian Ingebrigtsen, Mark Read and Paul Marazzi. A follow-up post on the band&#x27;s Facebook page suggested that they may reform for &quot;One last song.. or 2 or 3&quot;. The photo was posted on 17 September 2017, a day after Ben Adams posted a photo of him and Paul at the backstage for Flashdance The Musical Tour in Sunderland. There was then no confirmation that Paul had indeed reunited with a1.

On 7 May 2018 Ben Adams called BBC Radio 2 host Matt Lucas, announcing A1 would go on a 20th anniversary tour the next year. He said they probably had to do something slightly special for their 20-year reunion, and they had invited original member Paul Marazzi back.

On 23 May 2018, it was announced that they would be doing a set of concerts in Southeast Asia with Marazzi on board. It was announced via their Twitter and Facebook page.

On 12 October 2018, they released their first single with all members since the departure of Marazzi, and the disbandment of the group, 16 years previously. The song is called &quot;Armour&quot;.

===2019–present: &quot;The Reunion Show&quot; and new music===
On 27 February 2019 the group announced their UK comeback, with their first live show with the original line up in 15 years. The show was held at the O2 Academy Islington, London on 1 November 2019.

In 2021, A1 released their single, &quot;Spiders&quot;, which was written by the four band members.

In September 2023, a1 released &quot;Call Me When You Land&quot;, a song they wrote during the pandemic, ahead of their Asian &quot;a1 Twenty Five tour&quot;.

==Jakarta mall incident==
On 18 March 2001, during a mall signing in Mall Taman Anggrek, Jakarta, Indonesia, four teenage girls were killed in a stampede and two others were reported critical. A spokesman for the group said: &quot;They are devastated and are immediately planning to return to Great Britain. They have cancelled the rest of the tour and their thoughts are with the families and friends of those killed and injured.&quot;

<doc id="804331" wikidata="Q10860046" url="?curid=804331" title="Nikolaev (crater)">
<text>Nikolaev is a crater on the far side of the Moon. It is located north of the Mare Moscoviense and south of the larger crater Von Neumann. Because it is on the far side of the Moon, it is not visible from Earth. It is named after the Soviet cosmonaut, Andriyan Nikolaev.

The circular rim of this crater is not overlain by any significant craters but has been slightly eroded. It has an uneven edge and a wide inner wall. There is a shelf running around much of the wide inner edge where the material has slumped, and some along the northeastern side. The interior floor is rugged in places, particularly in the eastern half, and is marked by several small impacts in the southern half. There is a small central rise near the midpoint.

<doc id="804351" wikidata="Q746777" url="?curid=804351" title="Pērkonkrusts">
<text>Pērkonkrusts (, &quot;Thunder Cross&quot;) was a Latvian ultranationalist, anti-German, anti-Slavic, and antisemitic political party founded in 1933 by Gustavs Celmiņš, borrowing elements of German nationalism—but being unsympathetic to Nazism at the time—and Italian Fascism. It was outlawed in 1934, its leadership arrested, and Celmiņš eventually exiled in 1937. Still-imprisoned members were persecuted under the first Soviet occupation; some collaborated with subsequently invading Nazi Germany forces in perpetrating the Holocaust. Pērkonkrusts continued to exist in some form until 1944, when Celmiņš, who had initially returned to work in the occupying German administration, was imprisoned.

Following the restoration of Latvia&#x27;s independence in 1991, a new radical nationalist movement, also called &quot;Pērkonkrusts&quot;, was formed in 1995. The organization espouses many of the same values as its predecessor. Members have participated in efforts to bomb the Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders several times, leading to the arrest, trial and imprisonment of many of its members. Since around 2000, the group has become almost inactive.

== Principles and ideology ==
Pērkonkrusts has been categorised by scholars as either representing the radical right or fascism. Fascism researcher Roger Griffin describes Pērkonkrusts as having been a &quot;small but genuine fascist opposition&quot; which &quot;pursued a revolutionary solution to the [economic] crisis and which would turn Latvia into an authoritarian state based on a new élite with a new corporatist economy&quot;, with its politics defined by &quot;integralist nationalism&quot;. Building on Griffin&#x27;s definition of generic fascism, a categorisation of Pērkonkrusts as &quot;anti-German national socialism&quot; has also been proposed in an article from 2015.

Aside from the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Pērkonkrusts&quot; (1933–34), the main source of information on the political platform of Pērkonkrusts can be found in the 1933 brochure, &quot;Pērkonkrusts: What Is It? What Does It Want? How Does It Work?&quot; (). This publication not only outlined the movement&#x27;s political programme, but also included the complete party statutes.

With its slogan &quot;Latvia for Latvians! Work and bread for Latvians!&quot; (), Pērkonkrusts wished to place all political and economic control of their country exclusively in the hands of ethnic Latvians. As a result, the party rejected the existing legislation that gave national minorities cultural autonomy. Pērkonkrusts aimed its propaganda against minorities who supposedly had taken over the Latvian economy (i.e. Baltic Germans, Jews) and the contemporary parliamentary politicians, whom it accused of corruption.

Pērkonkrusts rejected Christianity as a foreign influence and suggested instead adopting Dievturība, which was an attempt to revive an assumed pre-Christian Latvian religion.

Despite its rural ideals, Pērkonkrusts gained most of its support in the urban areas like Riga, Cēsis, Valmiera, Jelgava, more specifically among students at the University of Latvia.

== Party symbols ==

&quot;Thunder Cross&quot; is one of the names for the swastika in Latvian, which was used as a symbol of the organization.

The group used a variation of the Roman or Hitler salute, and greeted with the Latvian phrase &quot;Cīņai sveiks&quot; (&quot;Ready for battle&quot; or &quot;Hail the struggle&quot;).

According to Latvian historian , although the party used both the swastika and the Roman salute, it was neither affiliated with, nor a copycat of German Nazism— as was the case with the headed by .

The uniform of Pērkonkrusts was a grey shirt and black beret.

The fascist group (Fire Cross), one of the Latvian ethnic symbols as well as a sign which is a mirrored image of a swastika, was founded in Latvia in 1932 by Gustavs Celmiņš, but was soon outlawed by the government of Latvia. The former Ugunskrusts organisation reemerged immediately under the new name of Pērkonkrusts. By 1934, Pērkonkrusts is estimated to have had between 5,000 and 6,000 members, although the organization maintained that it had more.

Kārlis Ulmanis, leader of the conservative nationalist Peasants&#x27; Union Party and then Prime Minister of Latvia, proposed constitutional reforms in October 1933, which socialists feared would target the left more than the right. In November of the same year, seven communist deputies were arrested, while Pērkonkrusts officials were left alone. Because of political unrest, stemming partially from the growing power of the right, Ulmanis staged a bloodless coup d&#x27;état in May 1934, banning not only the Communist Party and Pērkonkrusts, but all parties and the Saeima (Parliament). Following the coup, Pērkonkrusts leader Celmiņš was imprisoned for three years and then banished from Latvia.

Although Pērkonkrusts did not exist officially after 1934, many former leaders and members acted with a degree of unity in subsequent years.

In the late 1930s, Celmiņš set up a &#x27;foreign liaison office&#x27; of Pērkonkrusts in Helsinki, Finland. During his peripatetic exile, Celmiņš had established personal contacts with the representatives of other fascist groupings in Europe, most notably Romania&#x27;s Corneliu Codreanu.

=== During World War II ===
Not long after the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact in 1939, Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union. Whereas the Soviet regime released the Communists imprisoned by Ulmanis with great ceremony, political prisoners from Pērkonkrusts were not freed. Instead, more members of Pērkonkrusts were arrested by the Soviet authorities during 1940–1941, some of them being deported to Siberia.
When the Germans invaded Latvia in late June 1941, Celmiņš, who had moved to Germany following Latvia&#x27;s occupation in 1940, returned to Latvia as a &quot;Sonderführer&quot; in the service of the German Wehrmacht.

In early July, Pērkonkrusts was briefly permitted to operate openly again. Former Pērkonkrusts members were actively sought by the German authorities as volunteers for the Arajs Commando. According to research by historian Rudīte Vīksne, however, there were only a handful of members of Pērkonkrusts who played a role in the Holocaust in Latvia, their activities focused more on propaganda.

During the early phases of the Holocaust in Latvia, Mārtiņš Vagulāns, whom historian Valdis Lumans describes as a member of Pērkonkrusts, led a killing squad attached to the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in the town of Jelgava. Historian Andrievs Ezergailis has countered that Vagulāns was not in fact a member of Pērkonkrusts, between whom and the Nazis existed &quot;a wall of suspicion.&quot; Ezergailis has also argued, &quot;I do not think that among the killers of the Jews there were more than ten Pērkonkrusts members, if that. They played a more significant role as purveyors of anti-Semitism in Nazi press.&quot;

The German authorities decisively banned the organization for good in August 1941. Some former Pērkonkrusts members collaborated with the Germans, while others maintained an anti-German sentiment and joined those groups subversively opposed to German occupation.

Celmiņš continued his outward collaboration with the Germans in the hopes that sizable Latvian military formations would be created. From February 1942, he headed the Committee for Organising Latvian Volunteers (), the main function of which was the recruitment of Latvian men for the Latvian Auxiliary Police Battalions, known in German as &quot;Schutzmannschaften&quot; or simply &quot;Schuma&quot;. Aside from front-line combat duties, these battalions also participated in so-called anti-partisan operations in Latvia and Belarus that included the massacres of rural Jews and other civilians.

Pērkonkrusts members working within the SD apparatus in occupied Latvia would feed Celmiņš information, some of which he would include in his underground, anti-German publication &quot;Brīvā Latvija&quot;. This eventually led to Celmiņš and his associates being arrested, with Celmiņš ending up imprisoned in Flossenbürg concentration camp.

=== In modern Latvia ===

A radical group claiming Pērkonkrusts&#x27;s name emerged in the 1990s as an organization whose stated goal was the overthrow of the current unsatisfactory government and the establishment of a &quot;Latvian Latvia&quot;. In 1995, three former members of the group &quot;Rība&#x27;s Defenders&quot; - Valdis Raups, Aivars Vīksniņš and then-68-year-old Vilis Liniņš - joined up with martial artist Juris Rečs to reconstitute Pērkonkrusts. &quot;Rība&#x27;s Defenders&quot; was an unregistered splinter group from the self-proclaimed successor organization of the pre-WWII Aizsargi&quot;,&quot; led by Jānis Rība. Members of the group were assigned code names, swore loyalty oaths, and senior members wore masks to initiate recruits. The organization was explicitly militaristic and considered itself a &quot;Latvian fighting unit&quot; pursuing a &quot;holy liberation struggle.&quot;

The ideology of the group was primarily characterized by ethnic and racial nationalism, anti-semitism, anti-communism, anti-liberalism and opposed to free markets. Among the goals of Pērkonkrusts were a Latvia where the &quot;Latvian would be the lord and master in his Fatherland... not in those of Latvian-speaking cosmopolitan bastards,&quot; and &quot;racial purity of the Latvian people.&quot; Pērkonkrusts has opposed &quot;Jew neo-Communists... half-Jews and their allies... enemy number one of the Latvian people.&quot;

Members of the reconstituted Pērkonkrusts tried three times to bomb the Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders. In one of the most serious incidents on the night of 5 June 1997, two of the members, Valdis Raups and Aivars Vīksniņš, were killed in the explosion. Another nine members were prosecuted for the bombing and received sentences ranging from a year and a half of probation to three years in prison. In 2000, most of the leaders of the current Pērkonkrusts were arrested and tried. The group ceased organised activities or was banned around 2006.One of the previous leaders of the organization Igors Šiškins has tried to re-activate Pērkonkrusts again. He has claimed to represent Pērkonkrusts at various events, such as the marking of Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires and Soviet Victory Day (9 May) in Riga. On 9 May 2007, Šiškins was arrested for wearing forbidden symbols in public. Šiškins was similarly detained for displaying forbidden symbols on 9 May 2009. In 2006 a similar organization, the Gustavs Celmiņš&#x27; Center (&quot;Gustava Celmiņa centrs&quot;), which used the same symbols as Pērkonkrusts and also claimed to promote Dievturība, was registered with Šiškins becoming one of its leaders until the organization was dissolved by the Riga Regional Court in 2014.

In its relations with Latvia, the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation at times brings up the history of the Pērkonkrusts movement as evidence of present-day Latvia&#x27;s &quot;fascist&quot; heritage.

In 2016, blogger Jānis Polis reported that the owner of the former GCC website is linked to purported fake news websites.

<doc id="804356" wikidata="Q11661250" url="?curid=804356" title="USS Reprisal (1776)">
<text>USS &quot;Reprisal&quot;, 18, was the first ship of what was to become the United States Navy to be given the name promising hostile action in response to an offense. Originally the merchantman brig &quot;Molly&quot;, she was purchased from Robert Morris by the Marine Committee of the Continental Congress on March 28, 1776, renamed &quot;Reprisal&quot;, and placed under the command of Captain Lambert Wickes.

==Service history==

===Caribbean voyage, June–September 1776===
On June 10, 1776, the Committee of Secret Correspondence of Congress, by arrangement with the Marine Committee, issued orders to Captain Wickes, to proceed in &quot;Reprisal&quot; to Martinique and bring from there munitions of war for George Washington&#x27;s armies, and also to take as passenger Mr. William Bingham, who had been appointed agent from the American colonies to Martinique.

&quot;Reprisal&quot; dropped down the Delaware River from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, some time during the latter part of June. Before the Continental armed brig &quot;Nancy&quot;, six guns, slipped out to the Atlantic, six British men-of-war had sighted and chased her as she was returning from St. Croix and St. Thomas with 386 barrels of gunpowder for the Army. In order to save her, her captain ran her ashore. Captain Wickes, with the crew of &quot;Reprisal&quot;, aided by Captain John Barry with the crew of , were able to keep off boats from and to save about 200 barrels of powder. Before quitting &quot;Nancy&quot;, they laid a train of gunpowder which, when &quot;Nancy&quot; was boarded, blew up killing seven members of the boarding party. In the engagement, Wickes&#x27; third lieutenant, his brother, Richard Wickes, lost his life. This engagement, on June 29, became known as the Battle of Turtle Gut Inlet.

&quot;Reprisal&quot; cleared the Delaware Capes on July 3. During that month, Captain Wickes captured a number of vessels in the West Indies, and, on July 27, had a sharp encounter with off Martinique, beating her off and escaping into port. She returned to Philadelphia on September 13.

===In European waters, October 1776–February 1777===
====Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s passage to France====
On October 24, 1776, Wickes was ordered by Congress to take &quot;Reprisal&quot; to Nantes, France, carrying Benjamin Franklin, who had been appointed Commissioner to France. Undertaking America&#x27;s first diplomatic mission, Franklin would remain in France for nine years as ambassador. Franklin was accompanied on &quot;Reprisal&quot; by two of his grandsons, William Temple Franklin and Benjamin Franklin Bache. &quot;Reprisal&quot; afterwards was to cruise against enemy shipping in the English Channel.

&quot;Reprisal&quot; became the first vessel of the Continental Navy to arrive in European waters. En route to France, &quot;Reprisal&quot; captured two British brigs, reaching Nantes on November 29, 1776.

====Off the Spanish coast and return to France====
On December 17, 1776, &quot;Reprisal&quot; docked at Saint-Nazaire, France, where Wickes prepared the ship for her first cruise in European waters. She set sail again on January 24, 1777, cruising along the coast of Spain, in the Bay of Biscay and in the mouth of the English Channel.

Five prizes were captured on the cruise. On February 5, &quot;Reprisal&quot; boarded and captured a 16-gun British packet ship, two days out of Falmouth, Cornwall, after a hard fight of 40 minutes in which two officers of &quot;Reprisal&quot; were seriously wounded and one man killed. After taking his prizes into Port Louis on February 13, 1777, touching off a diplomatic furor, Wickes sailed for L&#x27;Orient to end the cruise on February 14.

Lord Stormont, the British ambassador to France, demanded that the French government expel &quot;Reprisal&quot; for violating France&#x27;s neutrality, and demanded the return of the captured ships. However, Wickes had been able to arrange, with Franklin&#x27;s assistance, a clandestine sale of the prize vessels before the French could take action.

Ultimately, &quot;Reprisal&quot; was ordered to leave in 24 hours by the French authorities, who had been stirred to action by the remonstrances of the British government. Wickes, however, claimed that &quot;Reprisal&quot; had sprung a leak and should be careened for repairs. He received permission to make his repairs and by excuses was able several times to defeat the intentions of those in charge of the port while he made ready for another cruise.

===Cruise around Ireland, April–June 1777===
In April 1777 &quot;Reprisal&quot; was joined by the Continental vessels (16 guns), and (10 guns), these three vessels constituting a squadron under the command of Wickes. The American Commissioners in Paris sent the squadron on a cruise along the shores of the British Isles, where Wickes had planned an attack on the Irish linen merchant fleet.

Leaving Saint-Nazaire on May 28, 1777, they entered the Irish Sea by way of the North Channel, and cruised clockwise around the coast of Ireland. On June 19, they took their first prizes—two brigs and two sloops. During the following week, they cruised in the Irish Sea and made 14 additional captures, comprising two ships, seven brigs and five other vessels. Of these 18 prizes, eight were sent into port, three were released, and seven sunk, three of them within sight of the enemy&#x27;s ports.

Having created serious turmoil in the British shipping industry, &quot;Reprisal&quot; returned to Saint-Malo, France at the end of June to face a diplomatic crisis. Lord Stormont increased British pressure upon France to remain publicly neutral, accusing the French of having aided and abetted American privateering, and threatening war unless the American ships were expelled. In the interest of avoiding British hostilities, the French authorities detained Wickes and sequestered &quot;Reprisal&quot; and her companions until mid-September 1777, during which time the three vessels were refitted. The detention was lifted after Wickes assured the French that he would return to America. The &quot;Dolphin&quot; attempted to remain in Nantes under French colors, but she was seized by the authorities.

===Loss, October 1777===
On September 14, 1777, &quot;Reprisal&quot; left France, for the United States. About October 1, &quot;Reprisal&quot; was lost off the banks of Newfoundland and all 129 on board, except the cook, went down with her.

<doc id="804357" wikidata="Q7935690" url="?curid=804357" title="Viscount Bayning">
<text>Viscount Bayning, of Sudbury in the County of Suffolk, was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created on 8 March 1628 for Paul Bayning, 1st Baron Bayning. He had already been created a Baronet, of Bentley Parva in the County of Essex, in the Baronetage of England on 24 September 1611, and Baron Bayning, of Horkesley in the County of Essex, on 27 February 1628, also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. On his early death in 1638, the titles became extinct.

The substantial Bayning estates in Essex and Sussex devolved on the Honourable Anne Bayning, daughter of the first Viscount. In 1674, the viscountcy was revived in favour when she was made Viscountess Bayning, of Foxley in the County of Berkshire, for life, in the Peerage of England. She was the wife of firstly Henry Murray, Groom of the Bedchamber to Charles I, and secondly of Sir John Baber. The life peerage became extinct on her death in 1678. The Bayning title was revived once again in 1797 in favour of the Viscountess Bayning&#x27;s great-great-grandson Charles Townshend, who was made Baron Bayning in the Peerage of Great Britain. See this title for more information.

The Honourable Elizabeth Bayning, daughter of the first Viscount, married Francis Lennard, 14th Baron Dacre, and was created [[Countess of Sheppey]] for life in 1680. The Honourable Mary Bayning, daughter of the first Viscount, married William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison, and was the mother of Barbara, Duchess of Cleveland, mistress of Charles II.

<text>USS &quot;San Francisco&quot; (SSN-711) is a nuclear submarine, the third ship or boat of the United States Navy to be named for San Francisco, California.

==History==
Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia was awarded the contract to build USS &quot;San Francisco&quot; on 1 August 1975, and her keel was laid down on 26 May 1977. She was launched on 27 October 1979, sponsored by Mrs. Robert Y. Kaufman, and commissioned on 24 April 1981 with Commander J. Allen Marshall in command.

&quot;San Francisco&quot; joined Submarine Force US Pacific Fleet following an initial shakedown cruise, and moved to her homeport at Pearl Harbor. She completed deployments in 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 with the U.S. Seventh Fleet and various independent operations in the Pacific in 1986, earning the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; for Submarine Squadron Seven in 1985. She earned a Navy Unit Commendation and a second Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; for Submarine Squadron Seven, and her crew was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for independent operations in 1988.

&quot;San Francisco&quot; entered a Depot Modernization Period at Pearl Harbor from 1989 to 1990 and then went on to conduct deployments to the Western Pacific in 1992 and 1994. The submarine was awarded the 1994 Commander Submarine Squadron Seven &quot;T&quot; for excellence in tactical operations and a Meritorious Unit Commendation for the 1994 Western Pacific deployment.

On 18 December 2002, &quot;San Francisco&quot; arrived at her new homeport at Apra Harbor, Guam.

The submarine was homeported at Naval Base Point Loma, San Diego, California in 2009.

===Grounding with seamount===
On 8 January 2005 at 02:43 GMT, &quot;San Francisco&quot; suffered a collision with an undersea mountain about southeast of Guam while operating at flank (maximum) speed at a depth of .

Official US Navy reporting subsequent to the grounding cited the location as &quot;in the vicinity of the Caroline Islands&quot;. The position of the impact was estimated by a newspaper account as , between Pikelot and Lamotrek Atolls.

The collision was so serious that the vessel was almost lost; accounts detail a desperate struggle for positive buoyancy to surface after the forward ballast tanks were ruptured. Ninety-eight crewmen were injured, and Machinist&#x27;s Mate Second Class Joseph Allen Ashley, 24, of Akron, Ohio, died from head injuries on 9 January. Other injuries to the crew included broken bones, spinal injury, and lacerations.

&quot;San Francisco&quot;″s forward ballast tanks and her sonar dome were severely damaged, but her pressure hull was not breached and there was no damage to her nuclear reactor. She surfaced and arrived in Guam on 10 January, accompanied by , , and , as well as MH-60S Knighthawks and P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft.

The Navy stated that there was &quot;absolutely no reason to believe that it struck another submarine or vessel.&quot; Later, an examination in drydock showed unmistakably that she had struck an undersea mountain.


&quot;San Francisco&quot;″s captain Commander Kevin Mooney was reassigned to a shore unit in Guam during the investigation of the collision. The Navy concluded that &quot;several critical navigational and voyage planning procedures&quot; were not being implemented aboard &quot;San Francisco&quot;, despite Mooney&#x27;s otherwise remarkably good record. Consequently, the Navy relieved Mooney of his command and issued him a letter of reprimand.

Six crewmen received non-judicial punishment hearings for hazarding a vessel and dereliction of duty, and they were reduced in rank and given letters of reprimand.

Twenty other officers and men received awards for their actions in the crisis, including letters of commendation, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, and the Meritorious Service Medal.

The seamount that &quot;San Francisco&quot; struck did not appear on the chart in use at the time of the accident, but other charts available for use indicated an area of &quot;discolored water&quot;, an indication of the probable presence of a seamount. The Navy determined that information regarding the seamount should have been transferred to the charts in useparticularly given the relatively uncharted nature of the ocean area that was being transitedand that the failure to do so represented a breach of proper procedures.

Nonetheless, a subsequent study by UMass Amherst indicated that the Navy&#x27;s charts did not contain the latest data relevant to the crash site because the geographical area was not a priority for the Defense Mapping Agency. Moreover, a subsequent report &quot;found that the (submarine&#x27;s parent) squadron and the group could have done more to prepare the ship for sea.&quot; Specifically, it determined that the submarine&#x27;s squadron &quot;did not take adequate action to correct previously identified deficiencies in open ocean navigation onboard SFO,&quot; and did not provide adequate oversight of &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s navigation performance. Additionally, &quot;The report also notes the document known as a &#x27;Subnote&#x27; from the Group, which laid out a path and average speed, was delivered to the ship two-and-a-half days before &quot;San Francisco&quot; sailed, and the Group&#x27;s own requirements are that it be to the ship three to five days before sailing.&quot; Ultimate responsibility for navigational safety rests with the ship&#x27;s captain and crew, not the Subnote; however, &quot;The report found that the Subnote did route the &quot;San Francisco&quot; through the area where it hit the seamount.&quot;

&quot;San Francisco&quot; had recently replaced her nuclear fuel and she was thus expected to remain in service until 2017, so the Navy determined that repair of the submarine was in its best interests. Temporary repairs were made in Guam to provide watertight integrity and forward buoyancy so that the boat could safely transit to another location for more extensive repairs. &quot;San Francisco&quot; steamed to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) in Bremerton, Washington via Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she arrived on 26 August 2005.

In June 2006, it was announced that &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s bow section would be replaced at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard with the bow of , which was soon to be retired. &quot;San Francisco&quot; is four years older than &quot;Honolulu&quot;, but she had been refueled and upgraded in 2000–2002. The cost of her bow replacement has been estimated at $79 million, as compared with the estimated $170 million to refuel and overhaul the nuclear reactor of &quot;Honolulu&quot;.

On 10 October 2008, &quot;San Francisco&quot; undocked after a successful bow replacement at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The dry-docking project involved cutting more than of forward ballast tanks and sonar sphere off the former USS &quot;Honolulu&quot; and attaching them to &quot;San Francisco&quot;. &quot;San Francisco&quot; completed repairs and sea trials in April 2009, then shifted homeport to Naval Base Point Loma, San Diego, California.

===Final deployment and conversion===
&quot;San Francisco&quot; returned to Point Loma from her sixth deployment in October 2016. Her change of command and farewell ceremony was held on 4 November 2016, after which she was homeported to Norfolk for conversion to a moored training ship (MTS) at the Navy&#x27;s Nuclear Power Training Unit in Charleston, South Carolina. On 11 May 2017, the ship was placed in &quot;&#x27;In Commission Special&#x27; – stand down for MTS conversion&quot;, a 32-month long process that was expected to begin in early 2018. The conversion was completed in mid-2021 and on 16 August she was moved from Norfolk to Charleston. She was decommissioned on 15 May 2022.

<doc id="804429" wikidata="Q1549050" url="?curid=804429" title="Great storm of 1703">
<text>The Great storm of 1703 was a destructive extratropical cyclone that struck central and southern England on 26 November 1703. High winds caused 2,000 chimney stacks to collapse in London and damaged the New Forest, which lost 4,000 oaks. Ships were blown hundreds of miles off-course, and over 1,000 sea men died on the Goodwin Sands alone. News bulletins of casualties and damage were sold all over England – a novelty at that time. The Church of England declared that the storm was God&#x27;s vengeance for the sins of the nation. Daniel Defoe thought it was a divine punishment for poor performance against Catholic armies in the War of the Spanish Succession.

==Severity==
Contemporary observers recorded barometric readings down to 973 millibars (measured by William Derham in south Essex), but it has been suggested that the storm deepened to 950 millibars over the Midlands.

Retrospective analysis conjectures that the storm was comparable to a Category 2 hurricane.

==Damage==
In London alone, approximately 2,000 massive chimney stacks were blown down. The lead roofing was blown off Westminster Abbey and Queen Anne had to shelter in a cellar at St James&#x27;s Palace to avoid collapsing chimneys and part of the roof. On the Thames, some 700 ships were heaped together in the Pool of London, the section downstream from London Bridge. Huge waves on the Thames river sent water higher than had ever been recorded in London, destroying more than 5,000 homes along the river. HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; was wrecked at Chatham. Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell&#x27;s HMS &quot;Association&quot; was blown from Harwich to Gothenburg in Sweden before way could be made back to England. Pinnacles were blown from the top of King&#x27;s College Chapel, in Cambridge.

There was extensive and prolonged flooding in the West Country, particularly around Bristol. Hundreds of people drowned in flooding on the Somerset Levels, along with thousands of sheep and cattle, and one ship was found inland. Approximately 400 windmills were destroyed, with the wind driving their wooden gears so fast that some burst into flames.
At Wells, Bishop Richard Kidder and his wife were killed when two chimneystacks in the palace fell on them, asleep in bed. This same storm blew in part of the great west window in Wells Cathedral. Major damage occurred to the southwest tower of Llandaff Cathedral at Cardiff in Wales.

At sea, many ships were wrecked, some of which were returning from helping Archduke Charles, the claimed King of Spain, fight the French in the War of the Spanish Succession. These ships included HMS &quot;Stirling Castle&quot;, HMS &quot;Northumberland&quot;, HMS &quot;Mary&quot; and HMS &quot;Restoration&quot;, with about 1,500 seamen killed, particularly on the Goodwin Sands. Between 8,000 and 15,000 people died overall. Some sources cite a figure between 10,000 and 30,000. In total, around 300 Royal Navy ships anchored along the south coast were lost. The first Eddystone Lighthouse off Plymouth was destroyed on , killing six occupants, including its builder, Henry Winstanley. (John Rudyard was later contracted to build the second lighthouse on the site.) Two days later, a cargo ship struck the rocks and sank. She was the first wrecking to occur there since the lighthouse was constructed five years prior. Another ship, torn from its moorings in the Helford River in Cornwall, was blown for before grounding eight hours later on the Isle of Wight. The storm also caught a convoy of 130 merchant ships sheltering at Milford Haven, along with their man of war escorts &quot;Dolphin&quot;, &quot;Cumberland&quot;, &quot;Coventry&quot;, &quot;Looe&quot;, &quot;Hastings&quot; and &quot;Hector&quot;. By 3:00pm the next afternoon, losses included 30 vessels.

The number of oak trees lost in the New Forest alone was 4,000. The towns of Plymouth, Hull, Cowes, Portsmouth and Bristol were devastated.

==Reaction==
The storm was unprecedented in ferocity and duration and was generally reckoned by witnesses to represent the anger of God, in recognition of the &quot;crying sins of this nation&quot;. The government declared 19 January 1704 a day of fasting, saying that it &quot;loudly calls for the deepest and most solemn humiliation of our people&quot;. It remained a frequent topic of moralising in sermons well into the 19th century.

===Literary===
The great storm also coincided with the increase in English journalism, and was the first weather event to be a news story on a national scale. Special issue broadsheets were produced detailing damage to property and stories of people who had been killed.

Daniel Defoe produced his full-length book &quot;The Storm&quot; (July 1704) in response to the calamity, calling it &quot;the tempest that destroyed woods and forests all over England&quot;. He wrote: &quot;No pen could describe it, nor tongue express it, nor thought conceive it unless by one in the extremity of it.&quot; Coastal towns such as Portsmouth &quot;looked as if the enemy had sackt them and were most miserably torn to pieces&quot;. Winds of up to destroyed more than 400 windmills. Defoe reported that the sails in some turned so fast that the friction between the wooden brakes and the wheel caused the wood to overheat and catch fire. He thought that the destruction of the sovereign fleet was a punishment for their poor performance against the Catholic armies of France and Spain during the first year of the War of the Spanish Succession.

==Naval losses==
In the English Channel, fierce winds and high seas swamped some vessels outright and drove others onto the Goodwin Sands, an extensive sand bank off the southeast coast of England and the traditional anchorage for ships waiting either for passage up the Thames Estuary to London or for favourable winds to take them out into the Channel and the Atlantic Ocean.
The Royal Navy was badly affected, losing thirteen ships including the entire Channel Squadron, and upwards of 1,500 seamen drowned.
* The third-rate was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands; of the ship&#x27;s company of 387 not one was saved.
* The third-rate was lost on the Goodwin Sands; all 220 men, including 24 marines, were killed.
* The third-rate (battleship) was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands. Seventy men, including four marine officers, were saved, but 206 men were drowned.
* The fourth-rate was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands. The captain and the purser were ashore, but Rear Admiral Beaumont and 268 other men were drowned. Only one man, Thomas Atkins, was saved. His escape was remarkable – having first seen the rear admiral get onto a piece of her quarterdeck when the ship was breaking up, and then get washed off again, Atkins was tossed by a wave into the &quot;Stirling Castle&quot;, which sank soon after. From the &quot;Stirling Castle&quot; he was swept into a boat by a wave, and was rescued.
* The fifth-rate &quot;Mortar-bomb&quot; was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands and her entire company of 65 lost.
* The sixth-rate advice boat &quot;Eagle&quot; was lost on the coast of Sussex, but her ship&#x27;s company of 45 were all saved.
* The third-rate was lost at Pevensey on the coast of Sussex; all her ship&#x27;s company of 221 were saved.
* The fifth-rate &quot;Litchfield Prize&quot; was wrecked on the coast of Sussex; all 108 on board were saved.
* The fourth-rate was lost at Spithead. The carpenter and 39 men were saved, and the other 193 were drowned.
* The fifth-rate fire-ship &quot;Vesuvius&quot; was lost at Spithead; all 48 of her ship&#x27;s company were saved.
* The fourth-rate &quot;Reserve&quot; was lost by foundering off Yarmouth. The captain, the surgeon, the clerk and 44 men were saved; the other 175 members of the crew were drowned.
* The second-rate was sunk in Chatham harbour. She was not manned and had no armament fitted; the following year she was raised for rebuilding.
* The fourth-rate was lost at Harwich; all but four of her men were saved.

 narrowly escaped a similar fate. More than 40 merchant ships were also lost.

Lamb (1991) claimed 10,000 seamen were lost in one night—a far higher figure—about one-third of the seamen in the Royal Navy. Defoe&#x27;s &quot;The Storm&quot; suggests that the Royal Navy lost one-fifth of its ships; this would, however, indicate a much lower proportion of seamen were lost, as some wrecked sailors survived.

==Date: old style==
The date of 26 November is reckoned according to the Julian calendar, still in use in 1703. In today&#x27;s Gregorian calendar, the date would be reckoned as 7 December.

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; had an early Canadian connection. The series was conceived by Canadian expatriate Sydney Newman while he was the BBC&#x27;s Head of Drama. The series may have been inspired by a short-lived segment (canceled because parents complained that it was &quot;too frightening&quot; for their children) on the Canadian version of &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;. The segment featured a character surprisingly similar to the Doctor, a puppet called Mr. X who traveled through time and space in his &quot;Whatsis Box&quot; teaching children about history. Newman oversaw this series while working as head of programming for the CBC. Newman maintained a guiding influence over &quot;Doctor Who&quot; until he left the BBC in 1967 and was in talks with the BBC in 1986, when the show was foundering, to reformat the show and take the role of executive producer.

The series made its North American premiere in January 1965 on CBC with the broadcast of William Hartnell&#x27;s first 26 episodes, fourteen months following their first airing on the BBC. The CBC did not renew the program and it would not reappear on the network for 40 years.

===The 1970s: &quot;Doctor Who&quot; sold to the United States===
The BBC series was originally sold to television stations in the United States in 1972, with Time-Life Television syndicating selected episodes of Jon Pertwee&#x27;s time as the Doctor. The series did not do well, despite an interesting write-up some years earlier in &quot;TV Guide&quot;. Apparently, program directors of the commercial television stations that picked up the Jon Pertwee series did not know that the program was an episodic serial, and so it was constantly being shuffled about in the programming schedules.

In 1978, Tom Baker&#x27;s first four seasons as the Doctor were sold to PBS stations across the United States. This time, though, Time-Life was ready to have the Doctor poised for American consumption, by having stage and screen actor Howard Da Silva read voiceover recaps of the previous episode and teasers for the next one which would inform the viewer as to what was going on. To accommodate the teasers up to three minutes of original material was cut from each episode. PBS program planners took the show at face value, but it soon achieved cult status. A few commercial stations including WOR-TV in New York City and KVOS-TV in Bellingham, Washington also aired the show for a few years.

===Return to Canada: TVOntario and CPN===
In Canada, TVOntario aired the program starting in 1976 with &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; and continued with the rest of the original series on a weekly basis until 1990 with series airing two to three years behind the BBC. TVO was also available to many viewers in the United States living in states bordering the Great Lakes. In order to fulfill the network&#x27;s originally strict mandate as an educational broadcaster, TVO&#x27;s transmissions of the Third Doctor&#x27;s stories were hosted by Dr. Jim Dator, a futurist teaching to the University of Toronto, while the first three seasons of Fourth Doctor stories were hosted by science fiction writer Judith Merril, who called herself the &quot;UnDoctor&quot;. Both hosts would fill out the show&#x27;s half-hour time slot through introductions and longer extros which would analyze and discuss the episode critically for several minutes often explaining how a story was at variance with scientific concepts, how it related to science fiction genres, or putting the episodes in a socio-political context. Afterward, this broadcast requirement was relaxed and the extra time was used for the network&#x27;s standard short subject programming such as &quot;Eureka!&quot;. TVO continued to broadcast &quot;Doctor Who&quot; until it lost the rights to the programme in 1990.

Meanwhile, in other parts of Canada, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; became accessible again in the late 1970s as cable television provided many areas with PBS stations piped in from the US, and thus that network&#x27;s broadcasts of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. There were also some local broadcasts of the series outside Ontario: for example, between November 1978 and February 1979 a Saskatchewan-based pay-cable provider, the Co-operative Programming Network (CPN), aired &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes on its Just for Kids channel.

===1980s===
In the mid-1980s, as more stations began to show the existing 1960s episodes, Lionheart (the program&#x27;s American distributor in the 1980s) dispensed with the older Time-Life tapes containing the Howard Da Silva narrations. Lionheart also offered stations the choice between the standard 25-minute episodes, or a longer version that some stations termed &quot;Whovies&quot;. These &quot;omnibus editions&quot;, or, &quot;movie versions&quot; as they were also known, edited multi-part serials into a single, feature-length film, by cutting out the opening and closing credits, as well as the recap of the cliffhanger, between episodes. (Some edits were clumsy, particularly during Davison-era stories that frequently would have scenes interrupted by partial credit sequences, or feature the sudden appearance of the &quot;electronic scream&quot; sound effect that usually accompanied cliffhangers). This was the most common format used for PBS broadcasts of the series in the 1980s and 1990s. The shortest of these, representing two-episode serials, ran approximately 45 minutes. The longest &quot;Whovie&quot; release, a compilation of the 10-episode &quot;The War Games&quot; serial, ran for an uninterrupted four hours, though it was more often shown in two two-hour segments; the 14-episode &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; was, however, broadcast as four parts, divided, as with the novelisations of this story, into the serial&#x27;s four major plot lines. This practice carried into the earliest VHS releases in the U.S. and the UK, particularly the first release of &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot; which was considerably truncated. It was roundly disliked by many fans and the practice was dropped by the early 1990s.

Success of the program in America was sealed by personal appearances of cast members and production staff at science fiction conventions, and by the national airing on PBS of the 20th anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; two days before the BBC. In November 1983, on the weekend after the airing of &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, four actors who played the Doctor (Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Peter Davison and Tom Baker) and many of those who played the Doctor&#x27;s companions over the series&#x27; first two decades on television appeared at a standing-room-only event in Chicago, the start of a Thanksgiving Day weekend celebration that continues annually (Chicago TARDIS).
In 1986, BBC Enterprises organised the &quot;Doctor Who USA Tour&quot;, a two-year travelling exhibition of props and memorabilia from the program, showcased in a 48-foot trailer decorated with alien landscapes from the show, police box entrances, and a mock-up of the TARDIS interior. Many tour stops included guest appearances from cast members.

The statewide PBS chain New Jersey Network was enthusiastic on the series, scheduling pre-1970 serials as well as being the first to broadcast the new season of the program in 1985. NJN staff member Eric Luskin hosted and produced three documentaries on the series, the latter a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; look at the production of the 25th anniversary story &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot;.

On 22 November 1987, during a broadcast of the serial &quot;Horror of Fang Rock&quot; on Chicago, Illinois PBS affiliate WTTW-TV an unknown hacker wearing a Max Headroom mask jammed WTTW&#x27;s broadcast signal and replaced it with their own audio and video for 88 seconds, concluding with the masked man being hit on his bare butt with a fly swatter. This incident was investigated by the Federal Communications Commission but the culprit&#x27;s identity was never determined.

Once the series ceased production in 1989, the number of stations carrying &quot;Doctor Who&quot; naturally dropped, although the program&#x27;s popularity had been waning in the United States for some years. As most stations were in the practice of purchasing the omnibus &quot;movie versions&quot; of the series rather than the fourteen episodes produced annually in its last four years, stations only received four feature-length stories each January.

Meanwhile, Iowa Public Television (IPTV), the statewide PBS network for the state of Iowa, saw increased interest in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was aired on a Friday late-night science fiction marathon alongside &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and other British science fiction pieces. IPTV is the only television network (or station, or channel) in the world to have aired &quot;Doctor Who&quot; virtually continuously from its introduction in 1974 until the present. This totals 35 out of 40 years as of 2014, due to one break of about five years between 1979 and 1984, with other breaks of only a few months or weeks.

===Proposed Nelvana animated series===
In 1990, following the cancellation of the live action series, the BBC approached the Canadian animation house Nelvana to propose an animated continuation of the show. The cartoon series was to feature an unspecified Doctor incorporating elements of various BBC series Doctors and was not to be oriented to an audience younger than that of the live action series but was intended to be a continuation of the cancelled series but in animated form in order to save costs but with design elements that would promote merchandise sales.

According to Nelvana&#x27;s Ted Bastien: &quot;We went through a lot of development on it, then we were scripting and storyboarding it and about 4 scripts had been written. It happened really fast&quot;.

Concept art was prepared depicting several possible versions of the Doctor modelled on actors such as Peter O&#x27;Toole, Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Lloyd with elements of the wardrobes of previous Doctors. and new versions of allies such as K-9 and enemies such as the Daleks and Cybermen. The Master was to be &quot;half-man, half robot with a cybernetic bird accessory and a face modelled after Sean Connery.&quot; The show was also to feature female companions from Earth, and space battles which the BBC would not have been able to afford for the live action series.

The series would have been Nelvana&#x27;s biggest show to date, however, according to Bastien, &quot;it was pulled out from under us&quot; after a British animation studio told the BBC that it could do what Nelvana intended for a much lower price. The project did not proceed further and no pilot was produced.

==Later years==

===1996 television movie===
National awareness of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; temporarily increased when the Fox network broadcast a new television movie on 14 May 1996. The movie, a co-production between the BBC and Universal Pictures, received a moderate amount of publicity in American media, including a prominent story in &quot;TV Guide&quot;. The producers of the movie had hoped that it might serve as a &quot;backdoor pilot&quot; for a new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, but sub-par ratings in the U.S. prevented this hope from being realised. Many reasons are given for the ratings failure of the TV movie, most of which focus on strong, &quot;sweeps&quot; competition from programs on other channels, including a pivotal episode of the popular sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot;. However, it failed not just against its competition on the night, but against other movies broadcast in the same time slot in other weeks. It netted about a 5.5 rating, or about a 9-share. Fox&#x27;s &quot;Tuesday Night Movie&quot; slot was generally garnering an 11-share during this period.

At the same time, Fox was also broadcasting the dimension-hopping science fiction series &quot;Sliders&quot; which was facing its own struggles for renewal following average to middling ratings. Coincidentally, &quot;Sliders&quot; was owned by Universal Pictures, but when it came to supporting one series or another, the studio predictably backed the one that its wholly owned rather than the one for which it was merely a co-production partner. As a result, when the new Fall schedule was announced, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was not on the list. Universal did try to find &quot;Doctor Who&quot; a home on another broadcast or cable network, but were unsuccessful by the time their relationship expired with the BBC on 31 December 1997.

The TV movie was the first time a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; adventure was broadcast across the United States at the same time.

The movie was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, though it was set in San Francisco, and is to date the only &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story to be filmed in Canada. The film had its world premiere on CITV-TV in Edmonton, Alberta on 12 May 1996, two days before it aired on The Fox Network in the United States, and fifteen days before airing in the U.K. on the BBC. It is the only &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story to have had its premiere in Canada.

===Later syndication of the original series===
The first Canadian cable network to air &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was YTV which, from 1989 to the mid-1990s, aired all existing episodes of the series up to Season 26 in a weekday afternoon timeslot. The final two Sylvester McCoy seasons were aired in a separate evening time slot.

The original Hartnell and Troughton-era episodes aired daily on the Canadian science-fiction channel Space (now known as CTV Sci-Fi Channel) following the channel&#x27;s launch in late 1997; however the black and white episodes did not attract the hoped for viewership and were dropped after a year.

In the 1990s, fewer PBS stations carried &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, although a few continued to broadcast the series. In the mid-1990s WXEL in West Palm Beach, Florida aired several episodes never before broadcast in America.

By the early 2000s, only a small percentage of the 1980s-era tally of PBS stations still carried the program. In late 2004, the BBC began to stop sending any more episodes to PBS stations and not to renew current contracts as they expired. According to a report by the BBC, this was due to negotiations with commercial American networks to broadcast the new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. This meant that PBS stations had only their in-house libraries of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories to draw on, and several public television stations stopped broadcasting the programme altogether. By early 2006, only Maryland Public Television and Iowa Public Television still aired the classic series. After it became clear that the Sci Fi Channel would not be purchasing the rights to the classic series, BBC Worldwide offered the show to American broadcast channels again. KBTC &amp; KCKA in Washington State began broadcasting the show again in June 2006.

On 19 December 2006 it was announced that BBC Worldwide and Vuze, Inc., a peer-to-peer technology firm, had a content agreement and that legal copies of several BBC series; including &quot;Doctor Who&quot; are to be distributed by Azureus&#x27; Zudeo software to its American users sometime in the future. At present it is unclear whether the series covered by this agreement is the &#x27;Classic&#x27; series, the 2005 series, or both.

The classic series ran on the Canadian digital channel BBC Kids from 2001 until 2010 showing episodes from Jon Pertwee through Sylvester McCoy.

American digital broadcast network Retro Television Network announced that they would begin airing the classic series weeknights from 8-9 PM ET beginning 4 August 2014.

==The new series==

===2005–06: Series 1===
In 2005, media reports suggested that the Sci Fi Channel had expressed interest in the picking up the 2005 series revival, but ultimately did not do so that year. The CBC subsequently became the only North American broadcaster carrying the program that year, debuting it on 5 April 2005 to strong ratings. The Canadian broadcasts are formatted slightly differently from the British version, with the addition of commercial breaks, introductions specially recorded by Christopher Eccleston (Billie Piper also recorded an additional one for the Christmas special) and behind-the-scenes footage during the closing credits (mostly taken from &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;) in order to pad the 45-minute instalments to fill a 60-minute time-slot.

Initially, the Region 1 DVD release announced for 14 February 2006 was limited to Canada, with the American release delayed until a broadcaster could be found. When none seemed forthcoming, BBC Worldwide announced that the American DVD release would be available at the same time as the Canadian one. In the interim, however, Series 1 was picked up by Sci Fi, so while the Canadian DVD release went ahead as scheduled the American DVD release was pushed back to 4 July 2006. Series 1 began airing on Sci Fi on 17 March 2006.

In the Sci Fi Channel&#x27;s broadcasts of Series 1, the episodes (which appear to run off the same master tapes used in Canada) were edited for time, and for added commercial breaks, although the cuts made for American broadcast appear to differ from those made for Canadian television. With commercials, the total runtime per episode is one hour. In addition, the &quot;Next Time&quot; trailers are edited out in favour of original Sci Fi teasers run on the right two-thirds of the screen while the original credits are &quot;crushed&quot; to the left.

The initial Sci Fi Channel broadcasts of Series 1 attained an average Nielsen Rating of 1.3, representing 1.5 million viewers in total.
Although these ratings were less than those reached by Sci Fi&#x27;s original series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, they reflect a 44% increase in ratings and a 56% increase in viewership over the same timeslot in the second quarter of 2005, as well as increases of 56% and 57% in two key demographics.

===2006–08: Series 2-4===
&quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; aired on the Sci Fi Channel on 29 September 2006, along with the first episode of Series 2, &quot;New Earth&quot;. They were subsequently followed by the rest of season two, which completed airing on 22 December 2006. The second series did not fare quite as well in the ratings, averaging a 1.05 household Nielsen rating.

The third season began airing on the Sci Fi Channel on 6 July 2007. The first two episodes of season three, &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot; and &quot;Smith and Jones&quot;, earned 0.9 Nielsen ratings. Later episode &quot;The Lazarus Experiment&quot; earned a 0.8 rating, but the last two episodes and of the season, &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; and &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot; both earned 1.0 ratings. The third season averaged 1.3 million viewers.

CBC Television aired the fourth series beginning on 19 September 2008 and repeated the first three series on its digital channel bold. CBC was not given an &quot;in association with...&quot; screen credit during the closing credits of season four episodes, unlike its credit during the first three series. On 12 December 2008, CBC aired the season 4 finale episode &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; in an extremely edited version that removed approximately 20 minutes of story in order to fit the episode into a standard 60-minute time slot with commercials.

The Sci Fi Channel began airing season four on 18 April 2008. The season four premiere episode, &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;, earned a 1.1 rating and captured 1.48 million viewers, making it the best-rated season premiere since the pilot and the episode with the most viewers since 2006. The season finale, broadcast in a special 90-minute time slot, earned a 1.0 rating and 1.26 million viewers. Season four as a whole was rated 25% higher than season three in household ratings, and 17% higher in number of viewers.

The cable/satellite network BBC America began re-airing the entire 2005 series in the US on 21 November 2006. In December of the same year it was announced that American PBS station KTEH 54, which services San Jose, California, had acquired the rights to broadcast the 2005 episodes, making it the first public television station to publicise this acquisition of the new series. This news was shortly followed by a press release from CET, another PBS station this time servicing Cincinnati, Ohio, that they too had acquired the Eccleston episodes for broadcast. On 20 February, Outpost Gallifrey reported that another 38 PBS broadcasters, in total 40, have announced that they have acquired the rights to the Eccleston episodes and that they could begin to broadcast them as early as 1 March. On 3 March 2007, KERA-TV, the PBS station in Dallas, Texas, aired the episodes &quot;Rose&quot; and &quot;The End of the World&quot;, as well as the episode &quot;Bringing Back the Doctor&quot; of &quot;Doctor Who Confidential: Cut Down&quot;. In addition, WTTW 11 in Chicago, Illinois has been airing repeats of the new series. Episodes typically air on Saturday evenings at 10:00 pm. Further PBS stations have acquired the rights and begun airing the series at various times.

===2008–10: First set of specials and Series 5===
The CBC did not broadcast either the 2007 Christmas special, &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; or the 2008 follow-up, &quot;The Next Doctor&quot; and did not broadcast the 2009–2010 specials. After airing the 2009–2010 specials BBC America also acquired the American television rights to the 5th season in 2009. BBC America began airing this season on 17 April 2010.

Series five was aired on the Canadian cable channel Space. The channel aired the second series of &quot;Torchwood&quot; after CBC dropped the show after season one and the channel aired &quot;&quot; in July 2009.

Space also began airing &quot;Doctor Who&quot; specials in 2009. &quot;The Next Doctor&quot; aired on 14 March 2009 and &quot;Planet of the Dead&quot; aired on 25 July 2009, Waters of Mars aired later in the year and &quot;The End of Time&quot; two-parter aired 2 January 2010. BBC America aired these two specials on 27 June 2009 and on 26 July 2009. respectively.
Space aired &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; in April 2010.

BBC America&#x27;s airing of &quot;The Waters of Mars&quot; on 19 December 2009 earned the channel 1.1 million views, its highest ever prime-time ratings to that date. Part one of &quot;The End of Time&quot; aired on 26 December 2009 with part two airing 2 January 2010.

&quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; aired on the Canadian digital channel BBC Kids.

BBC America aired &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; on Christmas Day, 2010, making this the first episode of the revived series to be aired in North America on the same day as in the UK.

===2011: Series 6===
The first part of the sixth series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was broadcast on BBC America in the U.S. and Space in Canada on the same day as it was in the UK – on Saturday, 23 April – making it the first series since the show&#x27;s revival in 2005 to be broadcast on the same days in America and Canada as the UK broadcast. The BBC America airings also featured a short prelude, with Amy Pond recapping the events of her first meeting with the Doctor in the series 5 premiere The Eleventh Hour and the rest of the fifth season. Amy then tells the audience of her fantastic adventures with the Eleventh Doctor, travelling through time and space, alongside her boyfriend/fiancé/husband Rory Williams. This recap featured short clips from series 5, except for &quot;The Beast Below&quot;, &quot;Amy’s Choice&quot;, &quot;Vincent and the Doctor&quot; and &quot;The Lodger&quot;. This prologue was dropped after Amy Pond&#x27;s departure from the show.

===2019: HBO Max===
In 2019, the BBC announced that HBO Max would be the streaming video on demand home for the new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in addition to &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Top Gear&quot;, &quot;Luther&quot;, and &quot;The Honourable Woman&quot;.

===2023: Disney+===
On 25 October 2022, it was announced that beginning in 2023, future episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; would no longer air on BBC America and will instead stream on Disney+ in the U.S., and in Canada.

==Fandom==

Initially, the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Appreciation Society, the British &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan club, had North American chapters but by the early 1980s decided to divest themselves of international components for administrative reasons. As a result, national fan organisations sprang up in North America, including the North American &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Appreciation Society (which took over from DWAS), the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Fan Club of America (which organised regional weekend events with actors headlining the event), the Friends of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and the Canada-based &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Information Network (which was originally a DWAS chapter). Most of these organisations folded by the 1990s (Friends of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; lasting to the end of that decade) although the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Information Network still continues (celebrating its 33rd anniversary in 2013) and is now the longest-running &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan club in North America.

Local fan groups also developed, some disbanding when the series ended production, others which are still running; among those still in operation are The Whoosier Network (Indiana, celebrating its 29th anniversary in 2013), the North East Wisconsin Friends of The Doctor (NEWFOD), the Prydonians of Prynceton (New Jersey), the Guardians of Gallifrey (Central Florida), Tardis Repairs Inc. (aka TRI, Southern Florida), &quot;Doctor Who&quot; New York and the Gallifreyan Embassy of Long Island (New York), the Atlanta Gallifreyans (Georgia), The Earthbound TimeLords (Wauwatosa, WI), The Milwaukee Time Lords (Milwaukee, WI) and the Time Meddlers of Los Angeles (California). Other prominent fan groups have included the Unearthly Children (Pennsylvania), Friends of the Time Lord and UNIT (Massachusetts), T.A.R.D.I.S. (Arizona), the Legion of Rassilon (Northern California), Emerald City Androgums (Washington state), Motor City TARDIS (Michigan), the St. Louis CIA (Missouri), Space City Time Lords and the International House of Daleks (Texas) and the Chronicles of Who (Illinois). Many others have existed over the years.

Fan support of the &#x27;Classic&#x27; series, while not as pronounced as in its heyday in the 1980s, has continued in light of the current revival of the program, with a huge resurgence in mainstream popularity that reached its peak at the height of Matt Smith&#x27;s tenure as the Doctor. As of 2016, many annual fan-run events occur in America that are exclusively devoted to both &#x27;generations&#x27; of the series: the popular Gallifrey One (which has been running annually since 1990) which takes place in February in the Los Angeles area; Chicago TARDIS (begun in 2000) taking place in late November; Hurricane Who (begun in 2009) taking place in Orlando; the Sci Fi Sea Cruise which runs out of different ports annually to destinations such as Mexico and the Caribbean; and such newer events as Long Island Who (New York), Regeneration Who (Maryland), WhoFestDFW (Texas), ConKasterborous (Alabama), Time Eddy (Kansas), Console Room (Minnesota), TimeGate (Georgia) and Anglicon (Washington state). In recent years, many major comic book/media events such as San Diego Comic-Con and other local comic events, plus trade shows such as Wizard World and DragonCon, have featured top-billed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actors as guest stars. Other local events, including those promoted by the Meetup.com website, have spawned local fan gatherings, including the Tampa Time Lord Fest in Florida and the &quot;Galliday&quot; themed event at Disneyland in southern California.

Many expressions of fan interest have moved online exclusively. Though the series is a product of the United Kingdom, North American support for the program online has been as fervent and, in some cases, more prominent. Shaun Lyon&#x27;s Outpost Gallifrey website, statistically the most popular fan-created &quot;Doctor Who&quot; website in the series&#x27; history, originated out of Los Angeles and supported its extremely popular discussion forum community. While Outpost Gallifrey closed during the summer of 2009, it was succeeded by the Gallifrey Base discussion forum, based in Chicago, Illinois. Dr. Siobhan Morgan&#x27;s &quot;The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Homepage,&quot; one of the earliest &quot;Doctor Who&quot; information pages and still a widely regarded portal site, is based in Illinois. Shannon Patrick Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Doctor Who&quot;: A Brief History of Time (Travel)&quot; and Dominique Boies&#x27; &quot;The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Guide,&quot; both popular &quot;Doctor Who&quot; reference sites, are based out of Newfoundland and Ontario, Canada, respectively. More recently, the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; pages of scifi.com, the website of the Sci Fi Channel (which broadcasts the new series episodes) attracts hundreds of fans to its own forum community. Dozens of other popular &quot;Doctor Who&quot; web pages continue to thrive, and the earlier UseNET newsgroup rec.arts.drwho – a central source of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; discussion during the 1980s and 90s – still attracts fans.

In the late 2000s, new media developments led to several worldwide internet radio and podcast broadcasts. A variety of popular podcasts from both the United States and Canada serves the population; most notable is the Radio Free Skaro podcast (originating in Edmonton, Alberta and Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada), with countless others available for direct download on various websites as well as through sources such as iTunes.

<text>The 1940 Canadian federal election was held March 26, 1940, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 19th Parliament of Canada. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberal Party was re-elected to their second consecutive majority government.

The election was overshadowed by the Second World War, which caused many Canadians to rally around the government. In response to this, the Conservative Party of Robert Manion ran on a platform advocating the creation of an all-party national unity government and ran under the name &quot;National Government&quot; in this election. Though Manion was personally opposed to conscription, the Liberals faced intense pressure in Quebec on the question and promised not to institute the measure. This promise was to haunt the Liberals as they faced increasing pressure from the military and especially from English Canada to bring in the measure. To release him from his September 1939 promise, King called a plebiscite in 1942 on the question. &quot;See also Conscription Crisis of 1944.&quot; It was the most successful election for the Liberal Party in its history, in which it captured 73% of the seats in the House of Commons. By contrast, the Conservatives performed even worse than in the previous election, finishing with the same number of seats, a slightly lower share of the popular vote, and with Manion being defeated in his riding. This was the last election contested by the original incarnation of the Conservatives, who thereafter merged with remnants of the moribund Progressive Party to form the Progressive Conservatives.

Social Credit ran jointly with the New Democracy movement of William Duncan Herridge.

Some candidates of the Conservative and Social Credit parties insisted on running under the traditional names, however.

The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) gained its first seat east of Manitoba, with the election of Clarence Gillis from Cape Breton Island. This election was the last one for its ailing leader, J. S. Woodsworth.

2 New Democracy and Social Credit ran jointly under the New Democracy banner under the leadership of former Conservative William Duncan Herridge who had founded New Democracy in 1939 to promote his ideas monetary and economic reform, though several candidates continued to run under the old Social Credit name. The 3 New Democracy MPs elected were all Social Credit incumbents, including Social Credit parliamentary leader John Horne Blackmore while Herridge himself failed to win his seat. The party sat in the House of Commons under the New Democracy name until 1944 when its national convention voted to revert to the Social Credit name.

3One candidate appears to have run under the &quot;New Democratic Party&quot; banner. It is unlikely that this was related in any way to the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation&#x27;s adoption of this name in 1960. This may be a mis-reporting of party label - this may have been a &quot;New Democracy&quot; candidate.

4MP elected was Dorise Nielsen who ran and was elected as a Progressive Unity candidate in North Battleford but was a covert member of the Communist Party of Canada. When the Communist Party was refounded in 1943 as the Labor-Progressive Party, Nielsen openly joined the party and became an LPP MP.

<doc id="804563" wikidata="Q983074" url="?curid=804563" title="Toquinho">
<text>Antônio Pecci Filho (born July 6, 1946), better known as Toquinho (), is a Brazilian singer and guitarist. He is well known for his collaborations, as composer and performer, with Vinicius de Moraes.

==Childhood and musical studies==
Toquinho was born in São Paulo, the son of Italian immigrants Diva Bondioli and Antonio Pecci. He has one brother, João Carlos Pecci. His paternal grandfather was from Toro and his paternal grandmother was born in Calabria; his maternal grandparents were from Mantua. As he was very short as a child, his mother used to call him &quot;meu toquinho de gente&quot; (&quot;my piece of person&quot;), which was the origin of his nickname.

His first guitar lessons were with Dona Aurora, a piano teacher who also knew how to play guitar. However, she could not continue to teach Toquinho. At age 14, he began lessons with Paulinho Nogueira and went on to study harmony with Edgar Gianulo, classical guitar with Isaias Sávio and orchestration with Léo Peracchi. He also studied with and befriended Oscar Castro-Neves.

==Career==
Initially playing in colleges, Toquinho&#x27;s professional career took off in the 1960s at shows promoted by radio personality Walter Silva at the famous Paramount theater in São Paulo. He composed his first recorded song with Chico Buarque entitled &quot;Lua Cheia&quot; (Full Moon). His first big hit was composed in 1970 with Jorge Benjor, &quot;Que Maravilha&quot; (What a Wonder).

That same year he was invited by Vinicius de Moraes, co-writer of the worldwide hit &quot;Garota de Ipanema&quot; (The Girl from Ipanema), to participate in a series of shows in Buenos Aires, forming a solid partnership that would continue for 11 years and produce 120 songs, 25 records and over a thousand shows. After the death of Vinicius de Moraes in 1980, Toquinho went on to pursue a solo career, often performing with other talented musicians like Paulinho da Viola, Danilo Caymmi, Paulinho Nogueira and Chico Buarque.

Throughout his career, Toquinho composed songs for children, and recorded five albums for young audiences, including &quot;Arca de Noé&quot; (1980), with Vinicius de Moraes, and &quot;Casa de brinquedos&quot; (1983). Toquinho continues to record and play, and he remains popular in Brazil and Italy.

In 2021, his album &quot;Toquinho e Yamandu Costa - Bachianinha (Live at Rio Montreux Jazz Festival)&quot; (with Yamandu Costa) won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Album.

<doc id="804581" wikidata="Q4583" url="?curid=804581" title="Anne Frank">
<text>Annelies Marie Frank (, ; 12 June 1929 – February or March 1945) was a German-born Jewish girl who kept a diary documenting her life in hiding amid Nazi persecution during the German occupation of the Netherlands. A celebrated diarist, Frank described everyday life from her family&#x27;s hiding place in an Amsterdam attic. She gained fame posthumously and became one of the most-discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust with the 1947 publication of &quot;The Diary of a Young Girl&quot; (originally in Dutch, ; English: &quot;The Secret Annex&quot;), which documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944. It is one of the world&#x27;s best-known books and has been the basis for several plays and films.

Frank was born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1929. In 1934, when she was four-and-a-half, Frank and her family moved to Amsterdam in the Netherlands after Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party gained control over Germany. By May 1940, the family was trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. Frank lost her German citizenship in 1941 and became stateless. Despite spending most of her life in the Netherlands and being a &quot;de facto&quot; Dutch national, she never officially became a Dutch citizen. As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942, the family went into hiding in concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Frank&#x27;s father, Otto Frank, worked. The hiding place is notably referred to as the &quot;secret annex&quot;. Until the family&#x27;s arrest by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944, Frank kept and regularly wrote in a diary she had received as a birthday present in 1942.

Following their arrest, the Franks were transported to concentration camps. On 1 November 1944, Anne Frank and her sister, Margot, were transferred from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they died (presumably of typhus) a few months later. They were estimated by the Red Cross to have died in March, with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as the official date. Later research has alternatively suggested that they may have died in February or early March.

Otto, the only Holocaust survivor in the Frank family, returned to Amsterdam after World War II to find that Anne&#x27;s diary had been saved by his secretaries, Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. Moved by his daughter&#x27;s repeated wishes to be an author, Otto Frank published her diary in 1947. It was translated from its original Dutch version and first published in English in 1952 as &quot;The Diary of a Young Girl&quot;, and has since been translated into over 70 languages.

==Early life==
Frank was born Annelies or Anneliese Marie Frank on 12 June 1929 at the Maingau Red Cross Clinic in Frankfurt, Germany, to Edith () and Otto Heinrich Frank. She had an older sister, Margot. The Franks were liberal Jews, and did not practice all of the customs and traditions of Judaism. They lived in an assimilated community of Jewish and non-Jewish citizens of various religions. Edith and Otto were devoted parents, who were interested in scholarly pursuits and had an extensive library; both parents encouraged the children to read. At the time of Anne&#x27;s birth, the family lived in a house at Marbachweg 307 in Frankfurt-Eckenheim (today Frankfurt-Dornbusch), where they rented two floors. In 1931, the family moved to Ganghoferstraße 24 in a fashionable liberal area of Frankfurt-Ginnheim, called the &quot;Dichterviertel&quot; (&quot;Poets&#x27; Quarter&quot;) (now also part of Dornbusch). Both houses still exist.

In 1933, after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party won the federal election and Hitler was appointed Chancellor of the Reich, Edith Frank and the children went to stay with Edith&#x27;s mother Rosa in Aachen. Otto Frank remained in Frankfurt, but after receiving an offer to start a company in Amsterdam, he moved there to organize the business and to arrange accommodation for his family. He began working at the Opekta Works, a company that sold the fruit extract pectin. Edith travelled back and forth between Aachen and Amsterdam and found an apartment on the Merwedeplein (Merwede Square) in the Rivierenbuurt neighbourhood of Amsterdam, where many more Jewish-German refugees settled. In November 1933, Edith followed her husband and a month later Margot moved to Amsterdam. Anne stayed with her grandmother until February, when the family reunited in Amsterdam. The Franks were among 300,000 Jews who fled Germany between 1933 and 1939.

After moving to Amsterdam, Anne and Margot Frank were enrolled in school—Margot in public school and Anne in the 6th Montessori School. Anne joined the 6th Montessori School on 9 April 1934; in 1957, it was posthumously renamed &quot;Anne Frank School&quot;. Despite initial problems with the Dutch language, Margot became a star pupil in Amsterdam. Anne soon felt at home at the Montessori school and met children of her own age, like Hanneli Goslar, who would later become one of her best friends.

In 1938, Otto Frank started a second company, Pectacon, which was a wholesaler of herbs, pickling salts, and mixed spices, used in the production of sausages. Hermann van Pels was employed by Pectacon as an advisor about spices. A Jewish butcher, he had fled Osnabrück with his family. In 1939, Edith Frank&#x27;s mother came to live with the Franks and remained with them until her death in January 1942.

In May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands, and the occupation government began to persecute Jews by the implementation of restrictive and discriminatory laws; mandatory registration and segregation soon followed. Otto Frank tried to arrange for the family to emigrate to the United States—the only destination that seemed to him to be viable—but Frank&#x27;s application for a visa was never processed, because the U.S. consulate in Rotterdam was destroyed in the German bombing on 14 May 1940, resulting in the loss of all the paperwork there, including the family&#x27;s visa application.

After the summer holidays in 1941, Anne learned that she would no longer be allowed to go to the Montessori School, as Jewish children had to attend Jewish schools. From then on Anne, like her sister Margot, went to the (), an exclusive Jewish secondary school in Amsterdam that opened in September 1941.
==Period chronicled in Anne&#x27;s diary==
===Before going into hiding===

For her thirteenth birthday on 12 June 1942, Anne received an autograph book, bound with red-and-white checkered cloth and with a small lock on the front. Frank decided she would use it as a diary, and named it Kitty. She began writing in it almost immediately. In her entry dated 20 June 1942, she lists many of the restrictions placed upon the lives of the Dutch Jewish population.

In mid-1942, the systematic deportation of Jews from the Netherlands began. Otto and Edith Frank planned to go into hiding with the children on 16 July 1942, but when Margot received a call-up notice from the (Central Office for Jewish Emigration) on 5 July, ordering her to report for relocation to a work camp, they were forced to initiate their plan ten days earlier than they had originally intended. Shortly before going into hiding, Anne gave her friend and next-door neighbor Toosje Kupers a book, a tea set, and a tin of marbles. On 6 July, the Frank family left a note for the Kupers, asking them to take care of their cat Moortje. As the Associated Press reports: &quot;&#x27;I&#x27;m worried about my marbles, because I&#x27;m scared they might fall into the wrong hands,&#x27; Kupers said Anne told her. &#x27;Could you keep them for me for a little while?&#x27;&quot;

===Life in the &quot;Achterhuis&quot;===
On the morning of Monday, 6 July 1942, the Frank family moved into their hiding place, a three-story space entered from a landing above the Opekta offices on the Prinsengracht, where some of Otto Frank&#x27;s most trusted employees would be their helpers. This hiding place became known as the &quot;Achterhuis&quot; (translated into &quot;Secret Annex&quot; in English editions of the diary). Their apartment was left in a state of disarray to create the impression that they had left suddenly, and Otto left a note that hinted they were going to Switzerland. As Jews were not allowed to use public transport, Otto, Edith, and Anne walked several kilometres from their home. Margot cycled to the Prinsengracht with Miep Gies. The door to the &quot;Achterhuis&quot; was later covered by a bookcase to ensure it remained undiscovered.

Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep Voskuijl were the only employees who knew of the people in hiding. Along with Gies&#x27; husband Jan Gies and Voskuijl&#x27;s father Johannes Hendrik Voskuijl, they were the &quot;helpers&quot; for the duration of their confinement. The only connection between the outside world and the occupants of the house, they kept the occupants informed of war news and political developments. They catered to all of their needs, ensured their safety, and supplied them with food, a task that grew more difficult over time. Frank wrote of their dedication and of their efforts to boost morale within the household during the most dangerous of times. All were aware that, if caught, they could face the death penalty for sheltering Jews.


On 13 July 1942, the Franks were joined by the Van Pels family, made up of Hermann, Auguste, and 16-year-old Peter, and then in November by Fritz Pfeffer, a dentist and friend of the family. Frank wrote of her pleasure at having new people to talk to, but tensions quickly developed within the group forced to live in such confined conditions. After sharing her room with Pfeffer, she found him to be insufferable and resented his intrusion, and she clashed with Auguste van Pels, whom she regarded as foolish. She regarded Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer as selfish, particularly regarding the amount of food they consumed. Sometime later, after first dismissing the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, she recognized a kinship with him and the two entered a romance. She received her first kiss from him, but her infatuation with him began to wane as she questioned whether her feelings for him were genuine or resulted from their shared confinement. Anne Frank formed a close bond with each of the helpers, and Otto Frank later recalled that she had anticipated their daily visits with impatient enthusiasm. He observed that Anne&#x27;s closest friendship was with Bep Voskuijl, &quot;the young typist... the two of them often stood whispering in the corner.&quot;

===The young diarist===
In her writing, Frank examined her relationships with the members of her family, and the strong differences in each of their personalities. She was closest emotionally to her father, who later said, &quot;I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for that may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn&#x27;t need as much support because she didn&#x27;t suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did.&quot; The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot&#x27;s gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, &quot;Margot&#x27;s much nicer... She&#x27;s not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little baby who doesn&#x27;t count.&quot;

Frank frequently wrote of her difficult relationship with her mother, and her ambivalence towards her. On 7 November 1942, she described her &quot;contempt&quot; for her mother and her inability to &quot;confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness,&quot; before concluding, &quot;She&#x27;s not a mother to me.&quot; Later, as she revised her diary, Frank felt ashamed of her harsh attitude, writing: &quot;Anne, is it really you who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?&quot; She came to understand that their differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother&#x27;s and saw that she had added unnecessarily to her mother&#x27;s suffering. With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.

The Frank sisters each hoped to return to school as soon as they were able and continued with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a course &#x27;Elementary Latin&#x27; by correspondence in Bep Voskuijl&#x27;s name and received high marks. Most of Anne&#x27;s time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited (after March 1944) her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, dreams and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.

Frank aspired to become a journalist, writing in her diary on Wednesday, 5 April 1944:
She continued writing regularly until her last entry on 1 August 1944.

==Arrest==

On the morning of 4 August 1944, the &quot;Achterhuis&quot; was stormed by a group of German uniformed police (&quot;Grüne Polizei&quot;) led by SS-&quot;Oberscharführer&quot; Karl Silberbauer of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot;. The Franks, Van Pelses, and Pfeffer were taken to RSHA headquarters, where they were interrogated and held overnight. On 5 August, they were transferred to the Huis van Bewaring (House of Detention), an overcrowded prison on the . Two days later they were transported to the Westerbork transit camp, through which more than 100,000 Jews, mostly Dutch and German, had passed. Having been arrested in hiding, they were considered criminals and sent to the Punishment Barracks for hard labour.

Victor Kugler and Johannes Kleiman were arrested and jailed at the penal camp for enemies of the regime at Amersfoort, in the province of Utrecht. Kleiman was released after seven weeks, but Kugler was held in various Dutch concentration and prison camps until the war&#x27;s end. Miep Gies was questioned and threatened by the Security Police but not detained. Bep Voskuijl managed to escape with a few documents that would have incriminated their black market contacts. During the following days, the two female secretaries returned to the &quot;Achterhuis&quot; and found Anne&#x27;s papers strewn on the floor. They collected them, as well as several family photograph albums and Gies resolved to return them to Anne after the war. On 7 August 1944, Gies attempted to facilitate the release of the prisoners by confronting Silberbauer and offering him money to intervene, but he refused.

===Source of discovery===
In 2015, Flemish journalist Jeroen De Bruyn and Joop van Wijk, Bep Voskuijl&#x27;s youngest son, wrote a biography in which they alleged that Bep&#x27;s younger sister (their aunt) Nelly (1923–2001) could have betrayed the Franks. Nelly was a Nazi collaborator from the age of 19 to 23. She had run away to Austria with a Nazi officer, and returned to Amsterdam in 1943 after the relationship ended. Nelly had been critical of Bep and their father, Johannes Voskuijl, for helping the Jews; Johannes was the one who constructed the bookcase covering the entrance to the hiding place and remained as an unofficial watchman of the hideout. In one of their quarrels, Nelly shouted to them, &quot;Go to your Jews.&quot; Karl Josef Silberbauer, the SS officer who made the arrest, was reported to have said that the informer had &quot;the voice of a young woman&quot;.

In 2016, the Anne Frank House published new research pointing to an investigation over ration card fraud, rather than betrayal, as a possible explanation for the raid that led to the arrest of the Franks. The report stated that other activities in the building may have led authorities there, including activities of Otto Frank&#x27;s company; however, it did not rule out betrayal.

A 2018 book suggested Ans van Dijk, a Dutch Jew who betrayed at least 145 fellow Jews to the Gestapo, as a potential candidate for the informant. Dutch resistance fighter Gerard Kremer, who worked as a caretaker at an office building requisitioned by the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot;, apparently witnessed Van Dijk visiting the building in August 1944 and overheard her talking with her SD superiors about Prinsengracht, where the Franks were hiding. However, another book examining this possibility noted that many of Van Dijk&#x27;s victims had lived in or near Prinsengracht.

In January 2022, some investigators proposed Arnold van den Bergh, a member of Amsterdam&#x27;s Jewish Council who died in 1950, as the suspected informant. The investigators postulated that Van den Bergh gave up the Franks to save his family. The investigation is chronicled in Rosemary Sullivan&#x27;s English-language book, &quot;The Betrayal of Anne Frank: A Cold Case Investigation&quot;. Evidence was also claimed to have been found that Anne Frank&#x27;s father later knew this but did not reveal it after the war. According to the BBC, these investigators &quot;spent six years using modern investigative techniques to crack the &#x27;cold case...&#x27;&quot; However, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, several World WarII and Holocaust scholars have doubted the methods and conclusions of the investigators, calling the evidence &quot;far too thin&quot;.

Shortly after the publication of &quot;The Betrayal of Anne Frank&quot;, after criticism from scholars Bart van der Boom, David Barnouw and Johannes Houwink ten Cate, Dutch publishing house Ambo Anthos, which had published a Dutch translation, apologized via an internal email. The publisher said they should have been more critical and announced that they are &quot;await(ing) the answers from the researchers to the questions that have emerged and are delaying the decision to print another run&quot;. In response, Pieter van Twisk, one of the investigators referenced in the book, said that he was &quot;perplexed by the email&quot; and that the investigators had never claimed to have uncovered the complete truth. In March 2022, a group of World WarII experts and historians published their analysis of the conclusions and of the historical sources used in &quot;The Betrayal of Anne Frank&quot;; they contested the central claim that the Amsterdam Jewish council even had a list of Jewish hiding places that Van den Bergh could draw on, and concluded that the accusation of Van den Bergh was based on weak assumptions and lack of historical knowledge. As a result, the Dutch language version of the book was recalled by Ambo Anthos. 

On 19 August 2022, the Dutch researcher Natasha Gerson published an 80-page report analyzing the annotations and sources in &quot;The Betrayal of Anne Frank&quot;, which argued that the theory in the book was not only flawed but the product of source fraud. The report concluded that Otto Frank&#x27;s recorded agenda, as well as a letter Otto received from helper Johannes Kleiman and several other statements, were proven to be distorted to suit the outcome in the book. Several negative claims about Van den Bergh had Anton Schepers, a Nazi collaborator who was diagnosed twice as insane and who had taken over Van den Bergh&#x27;s notary practice, as the only source. This included the claim of Nazi contacts and a commission of 200,000 guilders paid on the sale of Jacques Goudstikker&#x27;s art business. While &quot;The Betrayal of Anne Frank&quot; stated that Van den Bergh enjoyed the protection of two high-up Nazis, the CCT and Sullivan had omitted statements that the named Nazis had not known Van den Bergh. Plans to publish a German translation of Sullivan&#x27;s book, previously postponed, were cancelled soon afterward.

==Deportation and life in captivity==
On 3 September 1944, the group was deported on what would be the last transport from Westerbork to the Auschwitz concentration camp and arrived after a three-day journey; on the same train was Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam native who had befriended Margot and Anne in the in 1941. Bloeme saw Anne, Margot, and their mother regularly in Auschwitz, and was interviewed for her remembrances of the Frank women in Auschwitz in the television documentary &quot;The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank&quot; (1988) by Dutch filmmaker Willy Lindwer and the BBC documentary &quot;Anne Frank Remembered&quot; (1995).

Upon arrival at Auschwitz, the SS forcibly split the men from the women and children, and Otto Frank was separated from his family. Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549—including all children younger than 15—were sent directly to the gas chambers. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the &quot;Achterhuis&quot; had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.

With the other women and girls not selected for immediate death, Frank was forced to strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was tattooed with an identifying number on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread rations for her mother, sister, and herself. The disease was rampant; before long, Frank&#x27;s skin became badly infected by scabies. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which was in a state of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.

In October 1944, the Frank women were scheduled to join a transport to the Liebau labour camp in Lower Silesia. Bloeme Evers-Emden was scheduled to be on this transport, but Anne was prohibited from going because she had developed scabies, and her mother and sister opted to stay with her. Bloeme went on without them.

On 28 October, selections began for women to be relocated to Bergen-Belsen. More than 8,000 women, including Anne and Margot Frank, and Auguste van Pels, were transported. Edith Frank was left behind and died of disease, starvation, and exhaustion. Tents were erected at Bergen-Belsen to accommodate the influx of prisoners, and as the population rose, the death toll due to disease increased rapidly.

Anne Frank was briefly reunited with two friends, Hanneli Goslar and Nanette Blitz, who were also confined in the camp. Blitz had been moved from the Sternlager to the same section of the camp as Frank on 5 December 1944, while Goslar had been held in the Sternlager since February 1944. Both women survived the war, and later discussed the conversations they had with Frank, Blitz in person and Goslar through a barbed wire fence. Blitz described Anne as bald, emaciated, and shivering, remarking: &quot;[The] shock of seeing her in this emaciated state was indescribable.&quot; Anne told her that she hoped to write a book based on the diary when the war ended. Goslar noted Auguste van Pels was with Anne and Margot Frank, and was caring for Margot, who was severely ill. She also recalled she did not see Margot, as she was too weak to leave her bunk, while Blitz stated she met with both of the Frank sisters. Anne told Blitz and Goslar she believed her parents were dead, and for that reason she did not wish to live any longer. Goslar later estimated their meetings had taken place in late January or early February 1945.

==Death==
Anne Frank died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in February or March 1945. The specific cause is unknown; however, there is evidence to suggest that she died from a typhus epidemic that spread through the camp, killing 17,000 prisoners. Gena Turgel, a survivor of Bergen-Belsen, knew Anne at the camp. In 2015, she told the British newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;: &quot;Her bed was around the corner from me. She was delirious, terrible, burning up.&quot; She said she had brought Frank water to wash. Turgel, who worked in the camp hospital, said that the epidemic took a terrible toll on the inmates: &quot;The people were dying like flies—in the hundreds. Reports used to come in—500 people who died. Three hundred? We said, &#x27;Thank God, only 300.&#x27;&quot; Other diseases, including typhoid fever, were rampant.

Witnesses later testified Margot fell from her bunk in her weakened state and was killed by the shock. Anne died a day after Margot. The dates of Margot&#x27;s and Anne&#x27;s deaths were not recorded. It was long thought that their deaths occurred only a few weeks before British troops liberated the camp on 15 April 1945, but research in 2015 indicated that they may have died as early as February. Among other evidence, witnesses recalled that the Franks displayed typhus symptoms by 7 February, and Dutch health authorities reported that most untreated typhus victims died within 12 days of their first symptoms. Additionally, Hanneli Goslar stated her father, , died one or two weeks after their first meeting; Hans died on 25 February 1945. After the war, it was estimated that only 5,000 of the 107,000 Jews deported from the Netherlands between 1942 and 1944 survived. An estimated 30,000 Jews remained in the Netherlands, with many people aided by the Dutch underground. Approximately two-thirds of this group survived the war.

Otto Frank survived his internment in Auschwitz. After the war ended, he returned to Amsterdam in June 1945 where he was sheltered by Jan and Miep Gies as he attempted to locate his family. He learned of the death of his wife, Edith, during his journey to Amsterdam, but remained hopeful that his daughters had survived. After several weeks, he discovered Margot and Anne had also died. He attempted to determine the fates of his daughters&#x27; friends and learned many had been murdered. Sanne Ledermann, often mentioned in Anne&#x27;s diary, had been gassed along with her parents; her sister, Barbara Ledermann, a close friend of Margot&#x27;s, had survived. Several of the Frank sisters&#x27; school friends had survived, as had the extended families of Otto and Edith Frank, as they had fled Germany during the mid-1930s, with individual family members settling in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

==&quot;The Diary of a Young Girl&quot;==
===Publication===
In July 1945, after the sisters Janny and Lien Brilleslijper, who were with Anne and Margot Frank in Bergen-Belsen, confirmed the deaths of the Frank sisters, Miep Gies gave Otto Frank Anne&#x27;s notebooks (including the red-and-white checkered diary) and a bundle of loose notes that she and Bep Voskuijl had saved in the hope of returning them to Anne. Otto Frank later commented that he had not realized Anne had kept such an accurate and well-written record of their time in hiding. In his memoir, he described the painful process of reading the diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that he had already heard some of the more amusing episodes read aloud by his daughter. He saw for the first time the more private side of his daughter and those sections of the diary she had not discussed with anyone, noting, &quot;For me it was a revelation... I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings... She had kept all these feelings to herself&quot;. Moved by her repeated wish to be an author, he began to consider having it published.

Frank&#x27;s diary began as a private expression of her thoughts; she wrote several times that she would never allow anyone to read it. She candidly described her life, her family and companions, and their situation, while beginning to recognize her ambition to write fiction for publication. In March 1944, she heard a radio broadcast by Gerrit Bolkestein—a member of the Dutch government in exile, based in London—who said that when the war ended, he would create a public record of the Dutch people&#x27;s oppression under German occupation. He mentioned the publication of letters and diaries, and Frank decided to submit her work when the time came. She began editing her writing, removing some sections and rewriting others, with a view to publication. Her original notebook was supplemented by additional notebooks and loose-leaf sheets of paper. She created pseudonyms for the members of the household and the helpers. The Van Pels family became Hermann, Petronella, and Peter van Daan, and Fritz Pfeffer became Albert Düssell. In this edited version, she addressed each entry to &quot;Kitty,&quot; a fictional character in Cissy van Marxveldt&#x27;s novels that Anne enjoyed reading. Otto Frank used her original diary, known as &quot;version A&quot;, and her edited version, known as &quot;version B&quot;, to produce the first version for publication. Although he restored the true identities of his own family, he retained all of the other pseudonyms.

Otto Frank gave the diary to the historian Annie Romein-Verschoor, who tried unsuccessfully to have it published. She then gave it to her husband Jan Romein, who wrote an article about it, titled (&quot;A Child&#x27;s Voice&quot;), which was published in the newspaper on 3 April 1946. He wrote that the diary &quot;stammered out in a child&#x27;s voice, embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at Nuremberg put together.&quot; His article attracted attention from publishers, and the diary was published in the Netherlands as (&quot;The Annex&quot;) (literally, &quot;the back house&quot;) in 1947, followed by five more printings by 1950.

It was first published in Germany and France in 1950, and after being rejected by several publishers, was first published in the United Kingdom in 1952. The first American edition, published in 1952 under the title &quot;Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl&quot;, was positively reviewed. The book was successful in France, Germany, and the United States, but in the United Kingdom it failed to attract an audience and by 1953 was out of print. Its most noteworthy success was in Japan, where it received critical acclaim and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first edition. In Japan, Anne Frank was quickly identified as an important cultural figure who represented the destruction of youth during the war.

A play by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett based upon the diary premiered in New York City on 5 October 1955 and later won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It was followed by the film &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959), which was a critical and commercial success. Biographer Melissa Müller later wrote that the dramatization had &quot;contributed greatly to the romanticizing, sentimentalizing and universalizing of Anne&#x27;s story.&quot; Over the years the popularity of the diary grew, and in many schools, particularly in the United States, it was included as part of the curriculum, introducing Anne Frank to new generations of readers.

Cornelis Suijk—a former director of the Anne Frank Foundation and president of the U.S. Center for Holocaust Education Foundation—announced in 1999 that he had five pages that had been removed by Otto Frank from the diary before publication; Suijk claimed that Otto Frank gave these pages to him shortly before he died in 1980. The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by Anne Frank about her parents&#x27; strained marriage and discuss Frank&#x27;s lack of affection for her mother. Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk&#x27;s foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001. Since then, they have been included in new editions of the diary.

===Reception===
The diary has been praised for its literary merits. Commenting on Anne Frank&#x27;s writing style, the dramatist Meyer Levin commended Frank for &quot;sustaining the tension of a well-constructed novel&quot;, and was so impressed by the quality of her work that he collaborated with Otto Frank on a dramatization of the diary shortly after its publication. Levin became obsessed with Anne Frank, which he wrote about in his autobiography &quot;The Obsession&quot;. The poet John Berryman called the book a unique depiction, not merely of adolescence but of the &quot;conversion of a child into a person as it is happening in a precise, confident, economical style stunning in its honesty&quot;.

In her introduction to the diary&#x27;s first American edition, Eleanor Roosevelt described it as &quot;one of the wisest and most moving commentaries on war and its impact on human beings that I have ever read.&quot; John F. Kennedy discussed Anne Frank in a 1961 speech, and said, &quot;Of all the multitudes who throughout history have spoken for human dignity in times of great suffering and loss, no voice is more compelling than that of Anne Frank.&quot; In the same year, the Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg wrote of her: &quot;one voice speaks for six million—the voice not of a sage or a poet but of an ordinary little girl.&quot;

As Anne Frank&#x27;s stature as both a writer and humanist has grown, she has been discussed specifically as a symbol of the Holocaust and more broadly as a representative of persecution. Hillary Clinton, in her acceptance speech for an Elie Wiesel Humanitarian Award in 1994, read from Anne Frank&#x27;s diary and spoke of her &quot;awakening us to the folly of indifference and the terrible toll it takes on our young,&quot; which Clinton related to contemporary events in Sarajevo, Somalia and Rwanda. After receiving a humanitarian award from the Anne Frank Foundation in 1994, Nelson Mandela addressed a crowd in Johannesburg, saying he had read Anne Frank&#x27;s diary while in prison and &quot;derived much encouragement from it.&quot; He likened her struggle against Nazism to his struggle against apartheid, drawing a parallel between the two philosophies: &quot;Because these beliefs are patently false, and because they were, and will always be, challenged by the likes of Anne Frank, they are bound to fail.&quot; Also in 1994, Václav Havel said &quot;Anne Frank&#x27;s legacy is very much alive and it can address us fully&quot; about the political and social changes occurring at the time in former Eastern Bloc countries.

Primo Levi suggested Anne Frank is frequently identified as a single representative of the millions of people who suffered and died as she did because &quot;One single Anne Frank moves us more than the countless others who suffered just as she did but whose faces have remained in the shadows. Perhaps it is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of all those people, we would not be able to live.&quot; In her closing message in Müller&#x27;s biography of Anne Frank, Miep Gies expressed a similar thought, though she attempted to dispel what she felt was a growing misconception that &quot;Anne symbolizes the six million victims of the Holocaust&quot;, writing: &quot;Anne&#x27;s life and death were her own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over. Anne cannot, and should not, stand for the many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their lives... But her fate helps us grasp the immense loss the world suffered because of the Holocaust.&quot;

Otto Frank spent the remainder of his life as custodian of his daughter&#x27;s legacy, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. In my case the role is reversed.&quot; He recalled his publisher&#x27;s explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, &quot;he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves him personally&quot;. Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when he said that the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the Nuremberg Trials, because &quot;people identified with this child. This was the impact of the Holocaust, this was a family like my family, like your family and so you could understand this.&quot;

In June 1999, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a special edition titled &quot;Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century&quot;. Anne Frank was selected as one of the &quot;Heroes &amp; Icons&quot;, and the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, described her legacy with the comment, &quot;The passions the book ignites suggest that everyone owns Anne Frank, that she has risen above the Holocaust, Judaism, girlhood and even goodness and become a totemic figure of the modern world—the moral individual mind beset by the machinery of destruction, insisting on the right to live and question and hope for the future of human beings.&quot; He notes that while her courage and pragmatism are admired, her ability to analyse herself and the quality of her writing are the key components of her appeal. He writes, &quot;The reason for her immortality was basically literary. She was an extraordinarily good writer, for any age, and the quality of her work seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition.&quot;

===Denials of authenticity and legal action===
After the diary became widely known in the late 1950s, various allegations against the veracity of the diary and its contents appeared, with the earliest published criticisms occurring in Sweden and Norway. In 1957, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Free Words&quot;), the magazine of the Swedish neofascist organization National League of Sweden, published an article by Danish author and critic Harald Nielsen, who had previously written antisemitic articles about the Danish-Jewish author Georg Brandes. Among other things, the article claimed that the diary had been written by Meyer Levin.

In 1958, at a performance of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; in Vienna, Simon Wiesenthal was challenged by a group of protesters who asserted that Anne Frank had never existed, and who challenged Wiesenthal to prove her existence by finding the man who had arrested her. Wiesenthal indeed began searching for Karl Silberbauer and found him in 1963. When interviewed, Silberbauer admitted his role and identified Anne Frank from a photograph as one of the people arrested. Silberbauer provided a full account of events, even recalling emptying a briefcase full of papers onto the floor. His statement corroborated the version of events that had previously been presented by witnesses such as Otto Frank.

In 1959, Otto Frank took legal action in Lübeck against Lothar Stielau, a school teacher and former Hitler Youth member who published a school paper that described the diary as &quot;a forgery&quot;. The complaint was extended to include Heinrich Buddegerg, who wrote a letter in support of Stielau, which was published in a Lübeck newspaper. The court examined the diary in 1960 and authenticated the handwriting as matching that in letters known to have been written by Anne Frank. They declared the diary to be genuine. Stielau recanted his earlier statement, and Otto Frank did not pursue the case any further.

In 1976, Otto Frank took action against Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was &quot;a forgery&quot;. The judge ruled that if Roth were to publish any further statements he would be subjected to a fine of 500,000 German marks and a six-month jail sentence. Roth appealed against the court&#x27;s decision. He died in 1978, and after a year his appeal was rejected.

Otto Frank mounted a lawsuit in 1976 against Ernst Römer, who distributed a pamphlet titled &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank, Bestseller, A Lie&quot;. When a man named Edgar Geiss distributed the same pamphlet in the courtroom, he too was prosecuted. Römer was fined 1,500 Deutschmarks, and Geiss was sentenced to six months imprisonment. The sentence of Geiss was reduced on appeal, and the case was eventually dropped following a subsequent appeal because the time limit for filing a libel case had expired.

With Otto Frank&#x27;s death in 1980, the original diary, including letters and loose sheets, was willed to the Dutch Institute for War Documentation, which commissioned a forensic study of the diary through the Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986. They examined the handwriting against known examples and found that they matched. They determined that paper, glue, and ink were readily available during the time the diary was said to have been written. They concluded that the diary was authentic, and their findings were published in what has become known as the &quot;Critical Edition&quot; of the diary. In 1990, the Hamburg Regional Court confirmed the diary&#x27;s authenticity.

In 1991, Holocaust deniers Robert Faurisson and Siegfried Verbeke produced a booklet titled &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank: A Critical Approach&quot;, in which they revived the allegation that Otto Frank wrote the diary. Purported evidence, as before, included several contradictions in the diary, that the prose style and handwriting were not those of a teenager, and that hiding in the &quot;Achterhuis&quot; would have been impossible. In 1993, the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel filed a civil lawsuit to prohibit further distribution of Faurisson and Verbeke&#x27;s booklet in the Netherlands. In 1998, the Amsterdam District Court ruled in favour of the claimants, forbade any further denial of the authenticity of the diary and unsolicited distribution of publications to that effect, and imposed a penalty of 25,000 guilders per infringement.

===Censored sections===
Since the original publication, several sections of Anne&#x27;s diaries which were initially edited out have been revealed and included in new editions. These contain passages relating to her sexuality, exploration of her genitalia, and her thoughts on menstruation. Following the conclusion of an ownership dispute in 2001, new editions have also incorporated pages removed by Otto Frank prior to publication which contain critical remarks about her parents&#x27; strained marriage and discuss her difficult relationship with her mother. Two additional pages which Anne had pasted over with brown paper were deciphered in 2018, and contained an attempt to explain sex education and a handful of &quot;dirty&quot; jokes.

==Legacy==
On 3 May 1957, a group of Dutch citizens, including Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting to rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The Anne Frank House opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the &quot;&quot;, all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces, all now protected behind acrylic glass. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbors, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam&#x27;s main tourist attractions, it received an average of 1.2 million visitors between 2011 and 2020.

In 1963, Otto Frank and his second wife, Elfriede Geiringer-Markovits, set up the Anne Frank Fonds as a charitable foundation, based in Basel, Switzerland. Upon his death, Otto willed the diary&#x27;s copyright to the Fonds, on the provision that the first 80,000 Swiss francs in income each year was to be distributed to his heirs. The Anne Frank Fonds represents the Frank family and administers the rights, &quot;inter alia&quot;, to the writings of Anne and Otto Frank and the letters of the Frank family. It is the owner of the rights to translations, editions, compilations, and authorised books about Anne Frank and her family. The Fonds educate young people against racism and loaned some of Anne Frank&#x27;s papers to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington for an exhibition in 2003. Its annual report that year outlined its efforts to contribute on a global level, with support for projects in Germany, Israel, India, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

In 1997, the Anne Frank Educational Centre (&quot;&quot;) was opened in the Dornbusch neighbourhood of Frankfurt, where Frank lived with her family until 1934. The centre is &quot;a place where both young people and adults can learn about the history of National Socialism and discuss its relevance to today.&quot;


The Merwedeplein apartment, where the Frank family lived from 1933 until 1942, remained privately owned until the 2000s. After featuring in a television documentary, the building—in a serious state of disrepair—was purchased by a Dutch housing corporation. Aided by photographs taken by the Frank family and descriptions in letters written by Anne Frank, it was restored to its 1930s appearance. Teresien da Silva of the Anne Frank House and Frank&#x27;s cousin, Bernhard &quot;Buddy&quot; Elias, contributed to the restoration project. It opened in 2005. Each year, a writer who is unable to write freely in their own country is selected for a year-long tenancy, during which they reside and write in the apartment. The first writer selected was the Algerian novelist and poet El-Mahdi Acherchour.

Anne Frank is included as one of the topics in the Canon of the Netherlands, which was prepared by a committee headed by Frits van Oostrom and presented to the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, Maria van der Hoeven, in 2006. The Canon is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. A revised version, which still includes her as one of the topics, was presented to the Dutch government on 3 October 2007, and approved in 2020.

In June 2007, &quot;Buddy&quot; Elias donated some 25,000 family documents to the Anne Frank House. Among the artifacts are Frank&#x27;s family photographs taken in Germany and the Netherlands and the letter Otto Frank sent his mother in 1945, informing her that his wife and daughters had perished in Nazi concentration camps.

In November 2007, the Anne Frank tree—by then infected with a fungal disease affecting the tree trunk—was scheduled to be cut down to prevent it from falling on the surrounding buildings. Dutch economist Arnold Heertje said about the tree: &quot;This is not just any tree. The Anne Frank tree is bound up with the persecution of the Jews.&quot; The Tree Foundation, a group of tree conservationists, started a civil case to stop the felling of the horse chestnut, which received international media attention. A Dutch court ordered city officials and conservationists to explore alternatives and come to a solution. The parties built a steel construction that was expected to prolong the life of the tree up to 15 years. However, it was only three years later, on 23 August 2010, that gale-force winds blew down the tree. Eleven saplings from the tree were distributed to museums, schools, parks, and Holocaust remembrance centres through a project led by the Anne Frank Center USA. The first sapling was planted in April 2013 at The Children&#x27;s Museum of Indianapolis. Saplings were also sent to a school in Little Rock, Arkansas, the scene of a desegregation battle; Liberty Park (Manhattan), which honours victims of the September 11 attacks; and other sites in the United States. Another horse chestnut tree honouring Frank was planted in 2010 at Kelly Ingram Park in Birmingham, Alabama.

Over the years, various films about Anne Frank have been produced. Her life and writings have inspired a diverse group of artists and social commentators to make reference to her in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include &quot;The Anne Frank Ballet&quot; by Adam Darius, first performed in 1959, and the choral works &quot;Annelies&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Beauty That Still Remains&quot; by Marcus Paus (2015). 

The only known footage of Anne Frank herself comes from a silent 20-second film of her next-door neighbor&#x27;s wedding. She is seen leaning out of a second-floor window in an attempt to better view the bride and groom at the nine second mark. The couple, who survived the war, gave the film to the Anne Frank House museum, which has posted it to YouTube.
In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; named Anne Frank among the heroes and icons of the 20th century on their list &quot;The Most Important People of the Century&quot;, stating: &quot;With a diary kept in a secret attic, she braved the Nazis and lent a searing voice to the fight for human dignity&quot;. Philip Roth called her the &quot;lost little daughter&quot; of Franz Kafka. Madame Tussauds wax museum unveiled an exhibit featuring a likeness of Anne Frank in 2012. Asteroid 5535 Annefrank was named in her honour in 1995, after having been discovered in 1942.

As of 2018, there are over 270 schools named after Anne Frank worldwide. 100 of them are in Germany, 89 in France, 45 in Italy, 17 in the Netherlands (among them the 6th Montessori School in Amsterdam which Frank herself attended until 1941), 4 in Brazil, 4 in the United States (among them the Anne Frank Inspire Academy), 2 in Bulgaria and one each in Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, El Salvador, Spain, Hungary, Israel, Nepal, Uruguay and Sweden. In 2020, the first of a series of Anne Frank Children&#x27;s Human Rights Memorials was placed adjacent to a high school in Maaleh, Adumim, outside of Jerusalem. In 2021, the second memorial was unveiled in Antigua, Guatemala, and another is in fabrication in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to be opened on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, 27 January 2022. In 2023, a plan to rename a daycare centre in Tangerhütte, Germany, named for Anne Frank since 1970, was met with international outcry and eventually dropped.

On 25 June 2022, a slideshow Google Doodle was dedicated in honour of Anne Frank marking the 75th anniversary of the publication of her diary.

<text>Peggy Ann Garner (February 3, 1932 – October 16, 1984) was an American child actress.

As a child actress, Garner had her first film role in 1938. At the 18th Academy Awards, Garner won the Academy Juvenile Award, recognizing her body of contributions to film in 1945, particularly in &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Junior Miss&quot;.

Featured roles in such films as &quot;Black Widow&quot; (1954) did not help to establish her in mature film roles, although she progressed to theatrical work and she made acting appearances on television as an adult. In 1961 she starred with Richard Boone in the episode &quot;Dream Girl&quot; on &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;.

==Early years==
Peggy Ann Garner was born on February 3, 1932, at Aultman Hospital in Canton, Ohio. She was the daughter of William H. Garner, an attorney, and Virginia Craig Garner; they were married in Toledo, Ohio on April 7, 1931. She was pushed by her mother into the limelight and entered in talent quests while still a child. Her parents divorced on February 26, 1947.

Garner was a child model for still photographers for two years before she began working in films in 1938.

==Film==

By 1938, Garner had made her first film appearance, and over the next few years she appeared in several more films, including &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot; (1944). She reached the height of her success at the age of 12 in &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; (1945), winning an Academy Juvenile Award largely for this performance. In the same year, she showed she could handle comedy by giving a fine performance in &quot;Junior Miss&quot; (also 1945).

In 1947, Garner appeared as herself in a promotional trailer for &quot; Miracle on 34th Street&quot;.

Like many child performers, Garner was unable to make a successful transition into adult film roles. 
==Stage==
In 1949, Garner starred in &quot;Peg O&#x27; My Heart&quot; at the Famous Artists Playhouse in Fayetteville, New York. In 1954, she toured with a troupe in several states, performing in &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot;. Garner headlined the national tour of the William Inge hit Broadway play &quot;Bus Stop&quot; beginning in 1955. She starred with Albert Salmi, who later became her husband. Garner also appeared with Dick York in the touring production. 

Garner&#x27;s Broadway credits include &quot;Home Is the Hero&quot;, &quot;First Lady&quot;, &quot;The Royal Family&quot;, and &quot;The Man&quot;.

==Radio and television==
In 1950, Garner starred as Esther Smith in the radio comedy &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;. The program ran two months on NBC.

Garner was a panelist in two television programs, &quot;Leave It to the Girls&quot; on ABC and NBC and &quot;Who Said That?&quot; on NBC. In 1951, she starred in the comedy &quot;Two Girls Named Smith&quot; on ABC.

In summer 1960, Garner appeared in &quot;The Unfamiliar,&quot; an episode of &quot;Producer&#x27;s Choice&quot;, and she was cast as Julie in the episode &quot;Stopover&quot; of David McLean&#x27;s western series &quot;Tate&quot;. In 1960 and again in 1962, Garner was cast in the episodes &quot;Once Around the Circuit&quot; and &quot;Build My Gallows Low&quot;, respectively, on the ABC series &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot;, with Gardner McKay. Garner appeared as Edie Brewer in the 1961 &quot;Naked City&quot; episode &quot;Button in the Haystack,&quot; alongside Albert Salmi, to whom she was married at the time, and in which the couple played husband and wife onscreen. During the early 1960s, Garner also appeared in one episode each of &quot;Bonanza&quot; (&quot;The Rival&quot;) and &quot;Combat!&quot;, both under director Robert Altman (see next section).

==Later years==
After Garner&#x27;s film career ended, she ventured into stage acting and had some success but also worked as a real estate agent and fleet car executive between acting jobs in order to support herself. After a decade away from work in feature films, she appeared as the pregnant aunt in the critically acclaimed film, &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978), directed by Robert Altman, whom she had worked with on television in the early 1960s. Her final screen performance was a small part in a made-for-television feature &quot;This Year&#x27;s Blonde&quot; (1980).

==Personal life and death==
Garner married singer/game show host Richard Hayes on February 22, 1951; the couple divorced in 1953. She then married actor Albert Salmi on May 16, 1956; they divorced on March 13, 1963. (Another source says that Garner and Salmi were married May 18, 1956.) Garner&#x27;s final marriage was to Kenyon Foster Brown. After a few years, that marriage also ended in divorce. 

In 1984, at age 52, Garner died from pancreatic cancer in the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Los Angeles. Her only child, Catherine Ann Salmi, died of heart disease on May 17, 1995. She was 38 years old. Peggy&#x27;s mother, Virginia, outlived both her only child and only grandchild.

<text>Robert Cletus Driscoll (March 3, 1937 – March 30, 1968) was an American actor who performed on film and television from 1943 to 1960. He starred in some of the Walt Disney Studios&#x27; best-known live-action pictures of that period: &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946), &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot; (1949), and &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950), as well as RKO&#x27;s &quot;The Window&quot; (1949). He served as the animation model and provided the voice for the title role in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953). He received an Academy Juvenile Award for outstanding performances in &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot; and &quot;The Window&quot;.

In the mid-1950s, Driscoll&#x27;s acting career began to decline, and he turned primarily to guest appearances on anthology TV series. He became addicted to narcotics, and was sentenced to prison for illicit drug use. After his release, he focused his attention on the &quot;avant-garde&quot; art scene. In ill health from his substance abuse, and with his funds depleted, his initially unidentified body was discovered on March 30, 1968, in an abandoned building in the East Village of Manhattan.

==Early life==
He was born Robert Cletus Driscoll in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the only child of Cletus (1902–1970), an insulation salesman, and Isabelle (née Kratz; 1904–1982), a former schoolteacher. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Des Moines, where they stayed until early 1943. The family moved to Los Angeles when a doctor advised the father to relocate to California because he was suffering from work-related handling of asbestos. 

Driscoll&#x27;s parents were encouraged to help their son become a child performer in films. Their barber&#x27;s son, an actor, got Bobby an audition at MGM for a role in the family drama &quot;Lost Angel&quot; (1943), which starred Margaret O&#x27;Brien. While on a tour across the studio lot, five-year-old Driscoll noticed a mock-up ship and asked where the water was. The director was impressed by the boy&#x27;s curiosity and intelligence and chose him over 40 applicants.

==Career==

===&quot;Wonder Child&quot;===

Driscoll&#x27;s brief, two-minute debut helped him win the role of young Al Sullivan, the youngest of the five Sullivan brothers, in the 20th Century Fox&#x27;s World War II drama &quot;The Fighting Sullivans&quot; (1944) with Thomas Mitchell and Anne Baxter. Additional screen portrayals included the boy who could blow his whistle while standing on his head in &quot;Sunday Dinner for a Soldier&quot;, the &quot;child brother&quot; of Richard Arlen in &quot;The Big Bonanza&quot; (both 1944), and young Percy Maxim in &quot;So Goes My Love&quot; (1946), with Don Ameche and Myrna Loy. He also had smaller roles in movies such as &quot;Identity Unknown&quot; (1945) and &quot;Miss Susie Slagle&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;From This Day Forward&quot;, and &quot;O.S.S.&quot; with Alan Ladd (all 1946).

===Disney===

Driscoll and Luana Patten were the first two actors Walt Disney placed under contract. Driscoll then played the lead character in &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946), which introduced live action into the producer&#x27;s films in conjunction with extensive animated footage. The film turned Driscoll and his co-star Luana Patten into child stars, and they were discussed for a special Academy Award as the best child actors of the year, but for the year of its release, no juvenile awards were presented at all.

Now nicknamed by the American press as Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Sweetheart Team&quot;, Driscoll and Patten starred together in &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot; (1948) with Burl Ives and Beulah Bondi. It was planned as Disney&#x27;s first all-live-action movie, with production beginning immediately after &quot;Song of the South&quot;, but its release was delayed until late 1948 to meet the demands of Disney&#x27;s co-producer and longtime distributor RKO Radio Pictures for animated content in the film. 

Driscoll played Eddie Cantor&#x27;s screen son in the RKO Studios musical comedy &quot;If You Knew Susie&quot; (also 1948), in which he teamed with former Our Gang member Margaret Kerry. Patten and he appeared with Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers in the live-action teaser for the &quot;Pecos Bill&quot; segment of Disney&#x27;s cartoon compilation &quot;Melody Time&quot; (also 1948).
Driscoll was lent to RKO to star in &quot;The Window&quot;, based on Cornell Woolrich&#x27;s short story &quot;The Boy Cried Murder&quot;. Howard Hughes, who had bought RKO the previous year, considered the film unworthy of release and Driscoll not much of an actor, so delayed its release. When it was released in May 1949, it became a surprise hit. &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited Driscoll with the film&#x27;s success:

&quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot; and &quot;The Window&quot; earned Driscoll a special Juvenile Academy Award in March 1950 as the outstanding juvenile actor of 1949.

Driscoll was cast to play Jim Hawkins in Walt Disney&#x27;s version of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950), with British actor Robert Newton as Long John Silver, the studio&#x27;s first all-live-action picture. The feature was filmed in the United Kingdom, and during production, Driscoll was found to not have a valid British work permit, so his family and Disney were fined and ordered to leave the country. They were allowed to remain for six weeks to prepare an appeal, and director Byron Haskin hastily shot all of Driscoll&#x27;s close-ups, using his British stand-in to film missing location scenes after his parents and he had returned to California.

&quot;Treasure Island&quot; was an international hit, and several other film projects involving Driscoll were under discussion, but none materialized. For example, Haskin recalled in his memoirs that Disney, although interested in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s pirate story as a full-length cartoon, always planned to cast Driscoll as Mark Twain&#x27;s Tom Sawyer. He was at the perfect age for the role, but because of a story rights ownership dispute with Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, who had previously produced the property in 1938, Disney ultimately had to cancel the entire project. Driscoll also was scheduled to portray a youthful follower of Robin Hood following &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, again with Robert Newton, who would play Friar Tuck, but Driscoll&#x27;s run-in with British immigration made this impossible.

Driscoll&#x27;s second long-run Disney contract allowed him to be lent to independent Horizon Pictures for the double role of Danny/Josh Reed in &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; (1951). His casting was suggested by screenwriter Michael Kanin.

In addition to his brief guest appearance in Walt Disney&#x27;s first television Christmas show in 1950, &quot;One Hour in Wonderland&quot;, Driscoll lent his voice to Goofy, Jr. in the Disney cartoon shorts &quot;Fathers Are People&quot; and &quot;Father&#x27;s Lion&quot;, which were released in 1951 and 1952, respectively.

Driscoll portrayed Robert &quot;Bibi&quot; Bonnard in Richard Fleischer&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Happy Time&quot; (1952), which was based on a Broadway play of the same name by Samuel A. Taylor. Cast with Charles Boyer, Marsha Hunt, Louis Jourdan, and Kurt Kasznar, he played the juvenile offspring of a patriarch in Quebec of the 1920s, the character upon whom the plot centered.

Driscoll&#x27;s last major success, &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), was produced largely between May 1949 and mid-1951. Driscoll was cast with Disney&#x27;s &quot;Little British Lady&quot; Kathryn Beaumont, who was in the role of Wendy Darling; he was used as the reference model for the close-ups and provided Peter Pan&#x27;s voice, and dancer and choreographer Roland Dupree was the model for the character&#x27;s motion. Scenes were played on an almost empty sound stage, with only the most essential props, and filmed for use by the animators.

In his biography on Disney, Marc Elliot described Driscoll as the producer&#x27;s favorite &quot;live action&quot; child star: &quot;Walt often referred to Driscoll with great affection as the living embodiment of his own youth.&quot; During a project meeting following the completion of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, though, Disney stated that he now saw Driscoll as best suited for roles as a young bully rather than a likeable protagonist. Driscoll&#x27;s salary at Disney had been raised to $1,750 per week, but Driscoll had little work from 1952 on. In March 1953, Driscoll&#x27;s additional two-year option had been extended (which would have kept him at Disney into 1956) but was cancelled just weeks after &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was released theatrically. A severe case of acne accompanying the onset of puberty, explaining why it was necessary for Driscoll to use heavy makeup for his performances on dozens of TV shows, was officially provided as the final reason for the termination of his connection with the Disney Studios.

===Radio and television===
Driscoll encountered increasing indifference from the other Hollywood studios. Still perceived as &quot;Disney&#x27;s kid actor&quot;, he was unable to get movie roles as a serious character actor. Beginning in 1953 and for most of the next three years, the bulk of his work was on television, on such anthology and drama series as &quot;Fireside Theater&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot;, &quot;Front Row Center&quot;, &quot;Navy Log&quot;, &quot;TV Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Ford Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;Dragnet&quot;, &quot;Medic&quot;, and &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;. On another series, &quot;Men of Annapolis&quot;, he appeared with John Smith, future second husband of Driscoll&#x27;s &quot;Song of the South&quot; co-star, Luana Patten.

In some special star-focusing series, Driscoll appeared with Loretta Young, Gloria Swanson, and Jane Wyman.

Between 1948 and 1957, he performed on a number of radio productions, which included a special broadcast version of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; in January 1951 and of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in December 1953. As was common practice in this business, Driscoll and Luana Patten also did promotional radio gigs (starting in late 1946 for &quot;Song of the South&quot;) and toured the country for various parades and charity events through the years.

In 1947, he recorded a special version of &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot; at Capitol Records. In 1954, he was awarded a Milky Way Gold Star Award, chosen in a nationwide poll for his work on television and radio.

===Post-Disney===
After Driscoll left the Disney studios, his parents withdrew him from the Hollywood Professional School, which served child movie actors, and sent him to the public West Los Angeles University High School, instead. There, his grades dropped substantially, he was the target of ridicule for his previous film career, and he began to take drugs. He said later, &quot;The other kids didn&#x27;t accept me. They treated me as one apart. I tried desperately to be one of the gang. When they rejected me, I fought back, became belligerent and cocky—and was afraid all the time.&quot; At his request, Driscoll&#x27;s parents returned him the next year to Hollywood Professional School, where in May 1955 he graduated.

His drug use increased; in an interview years later, he stated, &quot;I was 17 when I first experimented with the stuff. In no time I was using whatever was available... mostly heroin, because I had the money to pay for it.&quot; In 1956, he was arrested for the first time for possession of marijuana, but the charge was dismissed. On July 24, 1956, Hedda Hopper wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;This could cost this fine lad and good actor his career.&quot; In 1957, he had only two television parts, as the loyal brother of a criminal immigrant in &quot;M Squad&quot;, a long-running crime series starring Lee Marvin, and as an officer aboard the submarine S-38 in an episode of the World War II docudrama series &quot;The Silent Service&quot;.

In December 1956, Driscoll and his longtime girlfriend, Marilyn Jean Rush (occasionally misspelled as &quot;Brush&quot;), eloped to Mexico to marry despite their parents&#x27; objections. The couple was later rewed in a ceremony that took place in Los Angeles in March 1957. They had two daughters and one son, but the relationship did not last. They separated, then divorced in 1960. He would have nothing to do with his three children for the rest of his life due to his drug addiction.

===Later roles===
Driscoll began using the name &quot;Robert Driscoll&quot; to distance himself from his youthful roles as &quot;Bobby&quot; (since 1951, he had been known to friends and family as &quot;Bob&quot;, and in &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot; – Early Space Conquerors, 1952, was credited as &quot;Bob Driscoll&quot;). He landed two final screen roles: with Cornel Wilde in &quot;The Scarlet Coat&quot; (1955) and opposite Mark Damon, Connie Stevens, and Frances Farmer in &quot;The Party Crashers&quot; (1958). 

He was charged with disturbing the peace and assault with a deadly weapon after two hecklers made insulting remarks while he was washing a girlfriend&#x27;s car and he hit one with a pistol, but the charges were dropped.

His last known appearances on TV were small roles in two single-season series: &quot;The Best of the Post&quot;, a syndicated anthology series adapted from stories published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; magazine, and &quot;The Brothers Brannagan&quot;, an unsuccessful crime series starring Stephen Dunne and Mark Roberts. Both were originally aired on November 5, 1960.

Late in 1961, he was sentenced as a drug addict and imprisoned at the Narcotic Rehabilitation Center of the California Institution for Men in Chino, California. When Driscoll left Chino in early 1962, he was unable to find acting work. Embittered by this, he said, &quot;I have found that memories are not very useful. I was carried on a silver platter—and then dumped into the garbage.&quot;

===New York City===
In 1965, a year after his parole expired, he relocated to New York, hoping to revive his career on the Broadway stage, but was unsuccessful. He became part of Andy Warhol&#x27;s Greenwich Village art community known as the Factory, where he began focusing on his artistic talents.

He had previously been encouraged to do so by artist and poet Wallace Berman, whom he had befriended after joining Berman&#x27;s art circle (now also known as Semina Culture) in Los Angeles in 1956. Some of his works were considered outstanding, and a few of his surviving collages and cardboard mailers were temporarily exhibited in Los Angeles at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. 

In 1965, early in his tenure at the Factory, Driscoll gave his last known film performance, in experimental filmmaker Piero Heliczer&#x27;s underground movie &quot;Dirt&quot;.

== Death and aftermath ==
On March 30, 1968, two boys playing in a deserted East Village tenement at 371 East 10th Street found Driscoll&#x27;s body lying on a cot, with two empty beer bottles and religious pamphlets scattered on the ground. A post mortem examination determined that he had died from heart failure caused by advanced atherosclerosis from his drug use. No identification was on the body, and photos shown around the neighborhood yielded no positive identification. His unclaimed body was buried in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave in New York City&#x27;s Potter&#x27;s Field on Hart Island.

Late in 1969, Driscoll&#x27;s mother sought the help of officials at Disney studios to contact him, for a hoped-for reunion with his father, who was nearing death. This resulted in a fingerprint match at the New York City Police Department, which located his burial on Hart Island. Although his name appears on his father&#x27;s gravestone at Eternal Hills Memorial Park in Oceanside, California, his remains are still on Hart Island. In connection with the re-release of &quot;Song of the South&quot; in 1971, reporters researching the whereabouts of the film&#x27;s star first reported his death.

==Awards==

Driscoll received an Academy Juvenile Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at the 22nd Academy Awards presentation in 1950. The award was presented as a special miniature Oscar statuette for &quot;the outstanding juvenile actor of 1949&quot; for his roles in &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot; and &quot;The Window&quot;, both released that year. He also received the &quot;Milky Way Gold Star Award&quot; in 1954 for his work on television and radio.

For his contributions to the motion picture industry, Driscoll received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street in 1960.

==Tributes==
In February 2009, singer-songwriter Benjy Ferree released &quot;Come Back to the Five and Dime Bobby Dee Bobby Dee&quot;, a concept album based in part on Driscoll&#x27;s life.

In September 2011, American singer-songwriter Tom Russell released the song &quot;Farewell Never Neverland&quot; on the album &quot;Mesabi&quot;, an elegy for Bobby Driscoll as Peter Pan.

<text>Angela Maxine O&#x27;Brien (born January 15, 1937), known professionally as Margaret O&#x27;Brien, is an American actress. Beginning a career in feature films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer at age four, O&#x27;Brien became a child star and received a Juvenile Academy Award as the outstanding child actress of 1944. In her later career, she has appeared on television, on stage, and in supporting film roles.

==Early life and career==
O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s mother, Gladys Flores (1895–1958), was a flamenco dancer who often performed with her sister Marissa, who was also a dancer. O&#x27;Brien is of half-Irish and half-Spanish ancestry. She was raised Catholic.

===Film===

O&#x27;Brien made her first film appearance in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s &quot;Babes on Broadway&quot; (1941) at the age of four, but it was the following year that her first major role brought her widespread attention. As a five-year-old in &quot;Journey for Margaret&quot; (1942), O&#x27;Brien won wide praise for her quite convincing acting style, unusual for a child of her age. By 1943, she was considered a big enough star to have a cameo appearance in the all-star military show finale of &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot;. Also in 1943, at the age of seven, Margaret co-starred in &quot;You, John Jones,&quot; a &quot;War Bond/Effort,&quot; short film, with James Cagney and Ann Sothern (playing their daughter), in which she dramatically recited President Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;Gettysburg Address.&quot; She played Adèle, a young French girl, and spoke and sang all her dialogue with a French accent in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1943).

Arguably her most memorable role was in &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944), opposite Judy Garland . For her performance in this film as the younger sister &quot;Tootie&quot;, she was awarded a special juvenile Oscar in 1944 .

Margaret and June Allyson were known as &quot;The Town Criers&quot; of MGM. &quot;We were always in competition: I wanted to cry better than June, and June wanted to cry better than me. The way my mother got me to cry was if I was having trouble with a scene, she&#x27;d say, &#x27;why don&#x27;t we have the make-up man come over and give you false tears?&#x27; Then I&#x27;d think to myself, &#x27;they&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m not as good as June,&#x27; and I&#x27;d start to cry.&quot;

O&#x27;Brien‘s other successes included &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot; (1944), &quot;Our Vines Have Tender Grapes&quot; (1945), &quot;Bad Bascomb&quot; (1946) with Wallace Beery, and the first sound version of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1949). She played Beth in the 1949 MGM release of &quot;Little Women&quot;, but she was unable to make the transition to adult roles.

O&#x27;Brien later shed her child star image, appearing on a 1958 cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine with the caption &quot;How the Girl&#x27;s Grown&quot;, and was a mystery guest on the TV panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s acting appearances as an adult have been sporadic, mostly in small independent films and occasional television roles. She has also given interviews, mostly for the Turner Classic Movies cable network.

===Television===
O&#x27;Brien gave credit to television for helping her reform and modify her public image. In an interview in 1957, when she was 20, she said: &quot;The wonderful thing about TV is that it has given me a chance to get out of the awkward age — something the movies couldn&#x27;t do for me. No movie producer could really afford to take a chance at handing me an adult role.&quot;

On November 20, 1950, O&#x27;Brien co-starred with Cecil Parker in &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;, on &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; on TV. She appeared as the mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; November 24, 1957. On December 22, 1957, O&#x27;Brien starred in &quot;The Young Years&quot; on &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;. She played the role of Betsy Stauffer, a small-town nurse, in &quot;The Incident of the Town in Terror&quot; on television&#x27;s &quot;Rawhide&quot;. She appeared in S1 E39 &quot;The Sacramento Story&quot; of Wagon Train in 1958, playing Julie Revere, courted by Robert Horton&#x27;s Flint McCullough. She made a guest appearance on a 1963 episode of &quot;Perry Mason&quot; as Virginia Trent in &quot;The Case of the Shoplifter&#x27;s Shoe.&quot; In 1967, she made a guest appearance on the World War II TV drama &quot;Combat!&quot;. Also, in a 1968 two-part episode of &quot;Ironside&quot; (&quot;Split Second to an Epitaph&quot;) O&#x27;Brien played a pharmacist who (quite the opposite of her usual screen persona) was involved in drug theft and was accessory to attempted murder of star Raymond Burr&#x27;s &quot;Ironside&quot;. Another rare television outing was as a guest star on the popular &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; in the early 1970s, reuniting O&#x27;Brien with her &quot;Journey for Margaret&quot; and &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot; co-star Robert Young.

In 1991, O&#x27;Brien appeared in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, season 7, episode &quot;Who Killed J.B. Fletcher?&quot;, reuniting O&#x27;Brien with her &quot;Tenth Avenue Angel&quot; co-star Angela Lansbury.

==Academy Award==
While O&#x27;Brien was growing up, her awards were always kept in a special room. One day in 1954, the family&#x27;s maid asked to take O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Juvenile Oscar and two other awards home with her to polish, as she had done in the past. After three days, the maid failed to return to work, prompting O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s mother to discharge her, requesting that the awards be returned. Not long after, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s mother, who had been sick with a heart condition, suffered a relapse and died. In mourning, 17-year-old O&#x27;Brien forgot about the maid and the Oscar until several months later when she tried to contact her, only to find that the maid had moved and had left no forwarding address.

Several years later, upon learning that the original had been stolen, the Academy promptly supplied O&#x27;Brien with a replacement Oscar, but O&#x27;Brien still held on to hope that she might one day recover her original Award. In the years that followed, O&#x27;Brien attended memorabilia shows and searched antique shops, hoping she might find the original statuette, until one day in 1995 when Bruce Davis, then executive director of the Academy, was alerted that a miniature statuette bearing O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s name had surfaced in a catalogue for an upcoming memorabilia auction. Davis contacted a mutual friend of his and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s, who in turn phoned O&#x27;Brien to tell her the long-lost Oscar had been found.

Memorabilia collectors Steve Neimand and Mark Nash were attending a flea market in 1995 when Neimand spotted a small Oscar with Margaret O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s name inscribed upon it. The two men decided to split the $500 asking price hoping to resell it at a profit and lent it to a photographer to shoot for an upcoming auction catalogue. This led to Bruce Davis&#x27; discovery that the statuette had resurfaced and, upon learning of the award&#x27;s history, Nash and Neimand agreed to return the Oscar to O&#x27;Brien. On February 7, 1995, nearly 50 years after she had first received it, and nearly 40 years since it had been stolen, the Academy held a special ceremony in Beverly Hills to return the stolen award to O&#x27;Brien. Upon being reunited with her Juvenile Oscar, Margaret O&#x27;Brien spoke to the attending journalists:
For all those people who have lost or misplaced something that was dear to them, as I have, never give up the dream of searching—never let go of the hope that you&#x27;ll find it because after all these many years, at last, my Oscar has been returned to me.

==Additional honors==
In February 1960, O&#x27;Brien was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for motion pictures at 6606 Hollywood Boulevard, and one for television at 1634 Vine St. In 1990, O&#x27;Brien was honored by the Young Artist Foundation with its Former Child Star &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; Award recognizing her outstanding achievements within the film industry as a child actress. In 2006, she was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the SunDeis Film Festival at Brandeis University.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Brien was married to Harold Allen Jr. from August 9, 1959 until their divorce in 1968. She was married to steel-industry executive Roy Thorvald Thorsen from June 6, 1974 until his death. Their daughter, Mara Tolene Thorsen, was born in 1977.

<text>Jon James Lamont Whiteley (19 February 1945 – 16 May 2020) was a Scottish child film actor and in adult life a distinguished art historian.

==Life and career==
The Monymusk-born Whiteley appeared in five films during his brief acting career, and it was for the second of these, &quot;The Kidnappers&quot; (US: &quot;The Little Kidnappers&quot;, 1953), that he, along with co-star Vincent Winter, was awarded an Academy Juvenile Award. He appeared in only three more films, including &quot;The Spanish Gardener&quot; (1956), before his film acting career was effectively put on hold when his mother insisted on him passing the Eleven plus exam. After appearing twice more for TV credits, his acting career ended. 

Whiteley was educated at Pembroke College, Oxford, whereafter he became a respected art historian at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. He wrote his doctorate on the revival in painting of themes inspired by antiquity in mid-nineteenth-century France. He catalogued all the French Drawings in the Ashmolean, and authored and co-authored several books on artists including Ingres, Puvis de Chavannes and Claude Lorrain. He published a book on the Ashmolean&#x27;s Stringed Instruments in 2009, and was working on a catalogue of the later French paintings in the Museum.

His wife was art historian Linda Whiteley; the couple had two children. He was made a chevalier (knight) of the French Order of Arts and Letters in May 2009. The cause of his death was Glioblastoma (also known as glioblastoma multiforme or GBM). This is the most aggressive type of cancerous brain tumour in adults. The date or location of his funeral is not known. He is buried in Botley cemetery, Oxford.

<text>Ivan Jandl (24 January 1937 – 21 November 1987) was a Czechoslovakian child actor.

He appeared in the 1948 film &quot;The Search&quot; as a nine-year-old Czechoslovak boy who had survived Auschwitz and was searching for his mother in post-war Germany. The movie was filmed on location in Germany and at a studio in Zurich, Switzerland, from June to November, 1947. The boy spoke no English and had to learn his lines phonetically. He was awarded an Academy Juvenile Award for his work, but was not permitted by the then communist government of Czechoslovakia to travel to the USA to accept it. At the Academy Awards ceremony in 1949, his Oscar was accepted on stage on his behalf by the director of &quot;The Search&quot;, Fred Zinnemann. He was also awarded a Golden Globe for his performance in the film and both statuettes are now preserved in the Czech National Film Archive. He appeared in some Czech films in 1949 and 1950, then left acting to continue his studies. He tried unsuccessfully to continue his acting career in his late teens, and eventually found work in radio.

==Death==
Jandl died from complications of diabetes in Prague in 1987, aged 50. The minor planet 37736 Jandl is named after him. Thirty years after his death, on 9 January 2017, the ashes of Jandl were transferred to the Vyšehrad cemetery, the final resting place of many Czechoslovak personalities, thanks to the efforts of the Actors&#x27; Life Foundation (Život umělce) with the support of the Czech Actors&#x27; Association (Herecká asociace).

<doc id="804602" wikidata="Q182580" url="?curid=804602" title="Shirley Temple">
<text>Shirley Temple Black (born Shirley Jane Temple; April 23, 1928 – February 10, 2014) was an American actress, singer, dancer, and diplomat, who was Hollywood&#x27;s number-one box-office draw as a child actress from 1934 to 1938. Later, she was named United States Ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia, and also served as Chief of Protocol of the United States.

Temple began her film career in 1931 when she was three years old and was well-known for her performance in &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;, which was released in 1934. She won a special Juvenile Academy Award in February 1935 for her outstanding contribution as a juvenile performer in motion pictures during 1934 and continued to appear in popular films through the remainder of the 1930s, although her subsequent films became less popular as she grew older. She appeared in her last film, &quot;A Kiss for Corliss&quot;, in 1949.

She began her diplomatic career in 1969, when she was appointed to represent the U.S. at a session of the United Nations General Assembly, where she worked at the U.S. Mission under Ambassador Charles Yost. Later, she was named U.S. Ambassador to Ghana, and also served as the first female U.S. Chief of Protocol. In 1988, she published her autobiography, &quot;Child Star&quot;. After her biography was published, she served as the U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia (1989–1992).

Temple was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the Kennedy Center Honors and a Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. She is 18th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the greatest female American screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema.

==Early years==

Shirley Jane Temple was born on April 23, 1928, at Santa Monica Hospital (now UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center) in Santa Monica, California, the third child of homemaker Gertrude Temple and bank employee George Temple. The family was of Dutch, English, and German ancestry. She had two brothers: John and George Jr. The family moved to Rockingham Avenue, Brentwood, Los Angeles.

Temple&#x27;s mother encouraged her to develop her singing, dancing, and acting talents. At about this time, her mother began styling Temple&#x27;s hair in ringlets.

While at the dance school, Temple was spotted by Charles Lamont, who was a casting director for Educational Pictures. She hid behind a piano while he was in the studio. Lamont liked Temple and invited her to audition. He signed her to a contract in 1932. Educational Pictures launched its &quot;Baby Burlesks&quot;, 10-minute comedy shorts satirizing recent films and events, using preschool children in every role. In 1933, Temple appeared in &quot;Glad Rags to Riches&quot;, a parody of the Mae West feature &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;, with Temple as a saloon singer. That same year, she appeared in &quot;Kid &#x27;in&#x27; Africa&quot; as a child imperiled in the jungle and in &quot;Runt Page&quot;, a pastiche of the previous year&#x27;s &quot;The Front Page&quot;. The younger players in the cast recited their lines phonetically.

Temple became the breakout star of this series, and Educational promoted her to 20-minute comedies in the &quot;Frolics of Youth&quot; series with Frank Coghlan Jr. Temple played Mary Lou Rogers, the baby sister in a contemporary suburban family. Temple and her child costars modeled for breakfast cereals and other products to fund production costs. She was lent to Tower Productions for a small role in the studio&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;The Red-Haired Alibi&quot; (1932), and in 1933 to Universal, Paramount and Warner Bros. Pictures for various parts, including an uncredited role in &quot;To the Last Man&quot; (1933), starring Randolph Scott and Esther Ralston.

==Film career==
After viewing one of Temple&#x27;s &quot;Frolics of Youth&quot; films, Fox Film Corporation songwriter Jay Gorney saw her dancing in the theater lobby. Recognizing her from the screen, Gorney arranged a screen test for Temple for the film &quot;Stand Up and Cheer!&quot; (1934). Temple auditioned on December 7, 1933, and won the part. She was signed to a $150-per-week contract that was guaranteed for two weeks by Fox. The role was a breakthrough performance for Temple. Her charm was evident to Fox executives, and she was ushered into corporate offices almost immediately after finishing &quot;Baby, Take a Bow&quot;, a song-and-dance number that she performed with James Dunn.

===Roles===
Biographer John Kasson argues:

Biographer Anne Edwards wrote about the tone and tenor of Temple&#x27;s films:

President Franklin D. Roosevelt praised her performances, saying, &quot;It is a splendid thing that for just 15 cents, an American can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles.&quot;

===Finances===
On December 21, 1933, Temple&#x27;s contract was extended to one year at the same $150 per week () with a seven-year option, and her mother Gertrude was hired at $25 per week () as her hairdresser and personal coach. Released in May 1934, &quot;Stand Up and Cheer!&quot; became Shirley&#x27;s breakthrough film. She performed in a short skit in the film alongside popular Fox star James Dunn, singing and tap dancing. Fox executives rushed her into another film with Dunn, &quot;Baby Take a Bow&quot; (named after their song in &quot;Stand Up and Cheer!&quot;). Temple&#x27;s third film, also with Dunn, was &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; (1934), a movie written especially for her.

After the success of her first three films, Temple&#x27;s parents realized that she was not being paid sufficiently. Her image also began to appear on numerous commercial products without her legal authorization and without compensation. To regain control over the use of her image and to negotiate with Fox, Temple&#x27;s parents hired lawyer Lloyd Wright to represent them. On July 18, 1934, Temple&#x27;s contractual salary was raised to $1,000 per week (), and her mother&#x27;s salary was raised to $250 per week (), with an additional $15,000 () bonus for each finished film. Cease-and-desist letters were sent to many companies and the authorized corporate licenses began to be issued.

&quot;Bright Eyes&quot;, written with her acting style in mind, was released in 1934 The film included the song &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop&quot;, which is considered to be her signature song. She was awarded a miniature Juvenile Oscar in 1935.

===1935–1937===
Temple&#x27;s quota of films in each calendar year was increased from three to four in the contract that her parents signed in July 1934. &quot;Now and Forever&quot; starring Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard (with Temple billed third with her name above the title beneath Cooper&#x27;s and Lombard&#x27;s), &quot;The Little Colonel&quot;, &quot;Our Little Girl&quot;, &quot;Curly Top&quot; (with the signature song &quot;Animal Crackers in My Soup&quot;) and &quot;The Littlest Rebel&quot; were released after the contract was signed. &quot;Curly Top&quot; was Temple&#x27;s last film before the merger between 20th Century Pictures and the Fox Film Corporation.

Temple&#x27;s salary was $2,500 per week () by the end of 1935. Elaborate sets were built for the production at the famed Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, where a rock feature at the heavily filmed location ranch was eventually named Shirley Temple Rock.

&quot;Heidi&quot; was the only other Temple film released in 1937. Midway through shooting of the movie, the dream sequence was added to the script. Temple herself reportedly was behind the dream sequence and she had enthusiastically pushed for it, but in her autobiography, she vehemently denied this. Her contract gave neither her parents nor her any creative control over her movies. She saw this as Zanuck&#x27;s refusal to make any serious attempt at building upon the success of her dramatic role in &quot;Wee Willie Winkie&quot;.

One of the many examples of how Temple was permeating popular culture at the time is the references to her in the 1937 film &quot;Stand-In&quot;; newly minted film studio honcho Atterbury Dodd (played by Leslie Howard) has never heard of Temple, much to the shock and disbelief of former child star Lester Plum (played by Joan Blondell), who describes herself as &quot;the Shirley Temple of my day&quot;, and performs &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop&quot; for him.

===1938–1940===

The Independent Theatre Owners Association paid for an advertisement in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in May 1938 that included Temple on a list of actors who deserved their salaries while others&#x27; (including Katharine Hepburn and Joan Crawford) &quot;box-office draw is nil&quot;.

In 1939, she was the subject of the Salvador Dalí painting &quot;Shirley Temple, The Youngest, Most Sacred Monster of the Cinema in Her Time&quot;, and she was animated with Donald Duck in &quot;The Autograph Hound&quot;.
In 1940, Lester Cowan, an independent film producer, bought the screen rights to F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;Babylon Revisited&quot; for $80. Fitzgerald thought his screenwriting days were over, and with some hesitation, accepted Cowan&#x27;s offer to write the screenplay titled &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; based on the short story. After finishing the screenplay, Fitzgerald was told by Cowan that he would not do the film unless Temple starred in the lead role of the youngster Honoria. Fitzgerald objected, saying that at age 12, the actress was too worldly for the part and would detract from the aura of innocence otherwise framed by Honoria&#x27;s character. After meeting Temple in July, Fitzgerald changed his mind, and tried to persuade her mother to let her star in the film. However, her mother demurred. In any case, the Cowan project was shelved by the producer. Fitzgerald was later credited with the use of the original story for &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; starring Elizabeth Taylor.

As her contract with 20th Century-Fox was coming to a close, Temple&#x27;s mother applied her for entrance into the Westlake School for Girls in September 1939. There, Temple would enroll as a seventh grader. Temple noted that she had difficulty adapting to a school environment after having spent much of her youth with adults and private tutors. However, her classmate June Lockhart described her as having &quot;integrated herself right away&quot; and seeming &quot;delighted to be there&quot;. Temple frequently attended school dances and extracurricular activities, and according to Lockhart, &quot;students did not treat her differently despite her successful film career.&quot; Temple graduated from the school in May 1945.

===1941–1950: Final films and retirement===
Shirley signed with MGM after leaving 20th Century-Fox. However, upon meeting with Arthur Freed for a preliminary interview, the MGM producer exposed his genitals to her. When this elicited nervous giggles in response, Freed threw her out and ended their contract before any films were produced. The next idea was teaming her with Garland and Rooney for the musical &quot;Babes on Broadway&quot;. Fearing that either of those two could easily upstage Temple, MGM replaced her with Virginia Weidler. As a result, her only film for MGM was the relatively unsuccessful film &quot;Kathleen&quot;, released in 1941. &quot;Miss Annie Rooney&quot; followed for United Artists in 1942, but was unsuccessful. &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot; starring Cary Grant and &quot;Fort Apache&quot; starring John Wayne and Henry Fonda were two of her few hit films in the 1940s. Her then-husband John Agar also appeared in &quot;Fort Apache&quot;. She and future U.S. president Ronald Reagan were both in &quot;That Hagen Girl&quot; (1947)&quot;.&quot; She did not formally announce her retirement from full-length films until 1950.

==Radio career==
Temple briefly had her own radio series on CBS. &quot;Junior Miss&quot; debuted March 4, 1942, in which she played the title role. The series was based on stories by Sally Benson. Sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble, &quot;Junior Miss&quot; was directed by Gordon Hughes, with David Rose as musical director. The series ended on August 26, 1942.

==Television career==
From 1958 until 1961, Temple was the hostess, narrator, and an occasional actress on an anthology series of fairy tale adaptations called &quot;Shirley Temple&#x27;s Storybook.&quot; During 1958 the hour-long program was seen as a series of specials on ABC. Starting in 1959 the series began airing every third Monday night, alternating with &quot;Cheyenne&quot;. In 1960 the series moved to NBC, where it was broadcast under the title of &quot;The Shirley Temple Show&quot; until September 10, 1961.

In 1999, she hosted the &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Stars&quot; awards show on CBS.

In 2001 Temple served as a consultant on an ABC-TV film production of her autobiography, &quot;Child Star: The Shirley Temple Story.&quot; Directed by Australian director Nadia Tass and filmed by her husband David Parker, the film stars Ashley Rose Orr as Temple, Emily Anne Hart as teen Shirley, Connie Britton as Gertrude Temple, Colin Friels as George Temple, and Hinton Battle as Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson. It was filmed in Port Melbourne, Australia.

==Merchandise and endorsements==

John Kasson states:

Successful Shirley Temple items included a line of girls&#x27; dresses and many other items.

Alongside licensed merchandise came counterfeit items bearing Temple&#x27;s likeness to capitalize on her fame, from dolls, clothing, and other accessories to even cigars with her face printed on the label. Temple lamented in her memoirs that it &quot;made no economic sense&quot; to pursue litigation against those who made unlicensed goods under her name; a successful lawsuit was filed by Ideal Toy Company against a certain Lenora Doll Company, which manufactured and sold Shirley Temple dolls without authorization, with Temple herself cited as a co-plaintiff befitting her celebrity status.
==Myths and rumors==
At the height of her popularity, Temple was the subject of many myths and rumors, with several being propagated by the Fox press department. Fox publicized her as a natural talent with no formal acting or dance training. As a way of explaining how she knew stylized buck-and-wing dancing, she was enrolled for two weeks in the Elisa Ryan School of Dancing.

False claims circulated that Temple was not a child, but a 30-year-old dwarf, due in part to her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent, especially in Europe, that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate whether she was indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her primary teeth regularly through her days with Fox—for example, during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman&#x27;s Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the concrete, taking attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor said her teeth had been filed to make them appear like baby teeth.

A rumor about Temple&#x27;s trademark hair was that she wore a wig. On multiple occasions, fans yanked her hair to test the rumor. She later said she wished all she had to do was wear a wig, bemoaning the nightly process she had to endure in the setting of her curls as tedious and grueling, with weekly vinegar rinses that stung her eyes.

Rumors spread that her hair color was not naturally blonde. During the making of &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot;, news spread that she was going to do extended scenes without her trademark curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of her hair had been cut off.

==Diplomatic career==

Temple became active in the California Republican Party. In 1967, she ran unsuccessfully in a special election in California&#x27;s 11th congressional district after eight-term Republican J. Arthur Younger died of leukemia. She ran in the open primary as a conservative Republican and came in second with 34,521 votes (22.44%), behind Republican law school professor Pete McCloskey, who placed first in the primary with 52,882 votes (34.37%) and advanced to the general election with Democrat Roy A. Archibald, who finished fourth with 15,069 votes (9.79%), but advanced as the highest-placed Democratic candidate. In the general election, McCloskey was elected with 63,850 votes (57.2%) to Archibald&#x27;s 43,759 votes (39.2%). Temple received 3,938 votes (3.53%) as an independent write-in.

Temple was extensively involved with the Commonwealth Club of California, a public-affairs forum headquartered in San Francisco. She spoke at many meetings throughout the years, and was president for a period in 1984.

Temple got her start in foreign service after her failed run for Congress in 1967, when Henry Kissinger overheard her talking about South West Africa at a party. He was surprised that she knew anything about it. She was appointed as a delegate to the 24th United Nations General Assembly (September – December 1969) by President Richard M. Nixon and United States Ambassador to Ghana (December 6, 1974 – July 13, 1976) by President Gerald R. Ford. She was appointed first female Chief of Protocol of the United States (July 1, 1976 – January 21, 1977).

In 1976, Temple was considered a potential running mate to Gerald Ford in that year&#x27;s presidential election. While staying in Kansas City for the Republican National Convention, Temple and her husband were given a room with a White House telephone in it. Temple recalled that she speculated to her husband that the phone had been installed as Ford was about to ask her to be his running mate at the convention, however, the phone was disconnected. Bob Dole was instead chosen as the Vice Presidential nominee.

Temple had hoped after Ronald Reagan&#x27;s victory in the 1980 presidential election that she would be given a cabinet position or another ambassadorship. Reagan did send Temple as his representative to Paris as part of American inaugural celebrations abroad, however, she was not given any new posting during the Reagan administration. Writer Anne Edwards suggested that this was because Temple had supported Reagan&#x27;s rival, George H. W. Bush, in the 1980 Republican primaries. When rumours circulated that Reagan was planning to reappoint Temple as chief of protocol after Lenore Annenberg&#x27;s resignation, Temple remarked that she didn&#x27;t &quot;believe in looking back&quot;.

She served as the United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia (August 23, 1989 – July 12, 1992), having been appointed by President George H. W. Bush, and was the first and only woman in this job. Temple bore witness to two crucial moments in the history of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s fight against communism. She was in Prague in August 1968, as a representative of the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, and was going to meet with Czechoslovakian party leader Alexander Dubček on the very day that Soviet-backed forces invaded the country. Dubček fell out of favor with the Soviets after a series of reforms, known as the Prague Spring. Temple, who was stranded at a hotel as the tanks rolled in, sought refuge on the roof of the hotel. She later reported that it was from there she saw an unarmed woman on the street gunned down by Soviet forces, the sight of which stayed with her for the rest of her life.

Later, after she became ambassador to Czechoslovakia, she was present during the Velvet Revolution, which brought about the end of communism in Czechoslovakia. Temple openly sympathized with anti-communist dissidents, and assisted their efforts. She was ambassador when the United States established formal diplomatic relations with the newly elected government led by Václav Havel. She took the unusual step of personally accompanying Havel on his first official visit to Washington, traveling on the same plane.

==Personal life==

In 1943, 15-year-old Temple met 22-year-old John Agar, whom she married two years later in 1945, at age 17. She gave birth to Linda Susan Agar in 1948. Agar was reportedly an alcoholic and had extramarital affairs. Temple divorced Agar in 1950 on the grounds of mental cruelty.

In 1950, in Hawaii, Temple met Charles Alden Black at a cocktail party. Temple was married to Charles Alden Black from 1950 until his death on August 4, 2005. They had a son, Charles Alden Black Jr., and a daughter, Lori, who became a bassist for the rock band the Melvins.

===Breast cancer===
At age 44 in 1972, Temple was diagnosed with breast cancer. At the time, cancer was typically discussed in hushed whispers, and Temple&#x27;s public disclosure was a significant milestone in improving breast cancer awareness and reducing stigma around the disease.

==Death==
Temple died at age 85 on February 10, 2014, at her home in Woodside, California. The cause of death, according to her death certificate released on March 3, 2014, was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Temple was a lifelong cigarette smoker but avoided displaying her habit in public because she did not want to set a bad example for her fans. She is buried at Alta Mesa Memorial Park.

==Awards, honors, and legacy==

On March 14, 1935, Shirley left her footprints and handprints in the wet cement at the forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. She was the Grand Marshal of the New Year&#x27;s Day Rose Parade in Pasadena, California, three times in 1939, 1989, and 1999. On February 8, 1960, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 1970, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In February 1980, Temple was honored by the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. In 1975, Temple was installed as an honorary deputy paramount chief of the Oguaa people of Ghana.

In 1998, she received the Kennedy Center Honor for her achievement in film.

Her name is further immortalized by the mocktail named after her, although Temple found the drink far too sweet for her palate. In 1988, Temple brought a lawsuit to prevent a bottled soda version from using her name.

On June 9, 2021, Temple was featured on that day&#x27;s Google Doodle in celebration of the opening anniversary of &quot;Love, Shirley Temple” a special exhibit featuring a collection of her rare memorabilia at Santa Monica History Museum.

<doc id="804611" wikidata="Q230965" url="?curid=804611" title="Heather O'Rourke">
<text>Heather Michele O&#x27;Rourke (December 27, 1975 – February 1, 1988) was an American child actress. She had her breakthrough starring as Carol Anne Freeling in the supernatural horror film &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982), which received critical acclaim and established her as an influential figure in the genre. She went on to reprise the role in &quot;Poltergeist II: The Other Side&quot; (1986) and &quot;Poltergeist III&quot; (1988), the last of which was released posthumously.

O&#x27;Rourke also worked in television, appearing in the recurring roles of Heather Pfister on the comedy series &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1982–1983) and Melanie in the sitcom &quot;Webster&quot; (1983), as well as starring as Sarah Brogan in the television-film &quot;&quot; (1985).

Throughout her career, O&#x27;Rourke was nominated for six Young Artist Awards, winning once for her role in &quot;Webster&quot;. On February 1, 1988, O&#x27;Rourke died following two cardiac arrests, her cause of death later being ruled as congenital stenosis of the intestine complicated by septic shock.

==Early life==
Heather Michele O&#x27;Rourke was born on December 27, 1975, in San Diego, to Kathleen and Michael O&#x27;Rourke. Her mother worked as a seamstress and her father was a carpenter. She had an older sister, Tammy O&#x27;Rourke, also an actress. Her parents divorced in 1981, and O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s mother married part-time truck driver Jim Peele in 1984, while they were living in a trailer park in Anaheim, California. Her success later allowed the family to purchase a home in Big Bear Lake, California. Between acting jobs, O&#x27;Rourke attended Big Bear Elementary School, where she was president of her fifth grade class. At the time of her death, the family was living in Lakeside, California, a suburb of San Diego.

== Acting career ==
In a contemporary interview with &quot;American Premiere&quot; magazine, producer Steven Spielberg explained that he was looking for a &quot;beatific four-year-old child...every mother&#x27;s dream&quot; for the lead in his horror film &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982). While eating in the MGM commissary, Spielberg saw five-year-old O&#x27;Rourke having lunch with her mother while older sister Tammy O&#x27;Rourke was shooting &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;. After his lunch, Spielberg approached the family and offered O&#x27;Rourke the &quot;Poltergeist&quot; role; she was signed the next day over Drew Barrymore, who instead received the role of Gertie in &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;.
In &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, O&#x27;Rourke played Carol Anne Freeling, a young suburban girl who becomes the conduit and target for supernatural entities. During production, Spielberg twice accommodated the child actress when she was frightened; when she was scared by performing a particular stunt, Spielberg replaced O&#x27;Rourke with a stunt double wearing a blonde wig, and when she was disturbed by the portrayal of child abuse, Spielberg did not require her to perform the take again. For her work on the film, O&#x27;Rourke earned between $35,000 and $100,000. &quot;Poltergeist&quot; would go on to receive a cult following and critical acclaim, garnering three Academy Award nominations and a Young Artist Award nomination for O&#x27;Rourke. She was lauded for her performance, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; noting that she played a key role, writing that &quot;With her wide eyes, long blonde hair and soft voice, she was so striking that the sequel played off her presence.&quot; Her delivery of the lines &quot;They&#x27;re here!&quot; in the first film, and &quot;They&#x27;re baa-aack!&quot; in the second (that film&#x27;s tagline), placed her in the collective pop culture consciousness of the United States. &quot;They&#x27;re here!&quot; is ranked No. 69 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of 100 Movie Quotes, and PopSugar included the line on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Movie Quotes&quot;.

After her work in &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982), O&#x27;Rourke secured several television and TV movie roles. In April 1983, she starred as herself alongside Morey Amsterdam and well-known Walt Disney animated characters in the hour-long television special, &quot;Believe You Can...and You Can!&quot; She also appeared in &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Webster&quot;, &quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot;, &quot;Our House&quot;, and had a recurring role on &quot;Happy Days&quot; as Heather Pfister. For &quot;Webster&quot;, O&#x27;Rourke won her first Young Artist Award. She also appeared in the television movies &quot;Massarati and the Brain&quot; and &quot;&quot;. O&#x27;Rourke went on to reprise the role of Carol Anne Freeling in the second and third installments, &quot;Poltergeist II: The Other Side&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Poltergeist III&quot; in 1988 respectively; unlike its predecessor, the films garnered mixed reviews, although O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s performances were praised. &quot;Poltergeist III&quot; was her final feature, released in June 1988, four months after her death.

== Illness and death ==
In early 1987, O&#x27;Rourke became ill with giardiasis, which she contracted from well water at her family&#x27;s home in Big Bear Lake. She was subsequently diagnosed as having Crohn&#x27;s disease. She was prescribed cortisone injections to treat the disease during the time she was filming &quot;Poltergeist III&quot;. The steroidal injections resulted in facial swelling of the cheeks, which O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s mother said she was very self-conscious about.
On January 31, 1988, O&#x27;Rourke began exhibiting flu-like symptoms. The following morning, she collapsed in her home, and was rushed to Community Hospital in El Cajon. En route, she suffered cardiac arrest, but paramedics were able to restart her heart at 9:25a.m. She was subsequently flown to the Children&#x27;s Hospital of San Diego, where it was discovered she had intestinal stenosis and went into emergency surgery. She survived the surgery, but suffered another cardiac arrest while in the recovery room. Doctors performed CPR for over 30 minutes, but O&#x27;Rourke was pronounced dead at 2:43 that afternoon. O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s cause of death was ruled congenital stenosis of the intestine complicated by septic shock.

Daniel Hollander, the head of gastroenterology at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center stated that O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s death was &quot;distinctly unusual&quot; as she lacked prior symptoms of the bowel defect: &quot;I would have expected a lot of [digestive] difficulties throughout her life and not just to have developed a problem all of a sudden.&quot; However, Dr. Hollander further stated that it was possible for congenital bowel narrowing to cause sudden death without symptoms if an infection caused the bowel to rupture. A private funeral was held for O&#x27;Rourke on February 5 in Los Angeles, and she was entombed at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.

<doc id="804614" wikidata="Q287399" url="?curid=804614" title="Michal Martikán">
<text>Michal Martikán (; born 18 May 1979) is a Slovak slalom canoeist who has been competing at the international level since 1994. In 1996 he became the first athlete to win an Olympic gold medal for Slovakia since the country gained independence in 1993. In total he won 5 Olympic medals (2 golds, 2 silvers and 1 bronze), which is the most among all slalom paddlers. He has also won the World Championship title in the C1 individual category four times.

==Career==
At the age of 16, Michal Martikán became the youngest winner of a World Cup slalom canoeing event. Three months later, at age 17, Martikán was in sixth place after the first run of the canoe slalom singles event at the 1996 Olympics. With nothing to lose, he went all out on the second run and just bettered the score of defending champion Lukáš Pollert of the Czech Republic. Martikán was the first Olympic champion to represent independent Slovakia. He entered the 2000 Olympics as the favourite, having consistently finished near the top in every major competition and in each World Cup series. At the Sydney Games, Martikán registered the best score in the qualifying round, but was only in fifth place after the first run of the final. In the second run, he paddled a perfect course and his time was the fastest of the round. He was able to move up to the silver medal position behind Tony Estanguet of France. Competing in his third Olympics in 2004, Martikán again led the qualifying round. He also earned the highest score in the semi-finals, which also served as the first run of the final. After the second run, it appeared that Martikán had regained the Olympic title, but the referees controversially decided to award him a two-second penalty which pushed him to second place, only 12 hundredths of a second behind Estanguet. Martikán regained the Olympic title at the 2008 games in Beijing. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London Martikán took bronze. Michal Martikán is the only slalom canoeist to win five Olympic medals, one in each of the five games from 1996 through 2012.

At the World Championships, Martikán had an uninterrupted medal run in the individual C1 event between 1995 and 2010. The 2011 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships saw him finish outside the medals for the first time in an Olympic or World Championship individual race in his career. Ironically, this failure came in front of a home crowd on the Čunovo course near Bratislava. However, he managed to win gold in the team event with his Slovak teammates to prolong his medal run. He won another six gold medals in the C1 team event between 2013 and 2019, making it 17 straight World Championships with a medal.

He won his first medals in 1995 when he was just 16. He took a bronze in the C1 event and another bronze in the C1 team event. In 1997 he won his first individual world title as well as team gold. He won the individual C1 event on three more occasions (2002, 2003 and 2007). As of 2019 he has a total of 23 World Championship medals (15 golds, 3 silvers and 5 bronzes) which is more than any other slalom paddler in any category.

He has also won the overall World Cup title five times (1998, 2000, 2001, 2006, 2014), which is a record among C1 paddlers.

At the European Championships he has won four straight individual golds between 2007 and 2010. Slovakia won the C1 team event 11 times with him in the team. He also has 6 silvers (4 individual and 2 in team event) and 3 bronzes (1 individual and 2 in the team event).

Martikán is coached by his father Jozef.

==Manslaughter conviction==
In November 1997 Martikán was involved in a car accident near the village of Velké Zálužie, Slovakia. The car he was driving hit a pedestrian causing him fatal injuries. The investigation concluded that Martikán was traveling substantially over the 40 km/h speed limit. It was also found that the killed man was highly intoxicated at the time of the accident, in dark outside the inhabited area.

With Martikán facing actual incarceration due to the violation of his probation terms (during his Australia&#x27;s training camp he should process the license returning, a day after returning home while picking up the letter from the post office about driving license returning, the police surprisingly wait for him outside the building and he got in troubles...), then-president Rudolf Schuster, amid grave criticism, granted Martikán a presidential pardon, which besides sparing him from jail time effectively meant removal of the conviction from his criminal record. Schuster argued that Martikán&#x27;s positive athletic representation of the country abroad warranted the pardon, while critics pointed to the double standard and the preferential treatment Martikán was receiving as a sport celebrity.

<text>Hayley Catherine Rose Vivien Mills (born 18 April 1946) is an English actress. The daughter of Sir John Mills and Mary Hayley Bell and younger sister of actress Juliet Mills, she began her acting career as a child and was hailed as a promising newcomer, winning the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer for her performance in the British crime drama film &quot;Tiger Bay&quot; (1959), the Academy Juvenile Award for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pollyanna&quot; (1960) and Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress in 1961.

During her early career, Mills appeared in six films for Walt Disney, including her dual role as twins Susan and Sharon in the Disney film &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961). Her performance in &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; (a 1961 adaptation of the novel written by her mother) saw Mills nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress and she was voted the biggest star in Britain for 1961. 

In the late 1960s, Mills began performing in theatrical plays, making her stage debut in a 1969 West End revival of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. She also played in more mature roles. For her success with Disney, she received the Disney Legend Award. Although she has not maintained the box office success or the Hollywood A-list she experienced as a child actress, she has continued to make films and TV appearances, including a starring role in the UK television mini-series &quot;The Flame Trees of Thika&quot; in 1981, the title role in Disney&#x27;s television series &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; in 1988, and as Caroline, a main character in &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (2007–2012) on ITV in the UK. She published her memoirs, &quot;Forever Young,&quot; in 2021.

==Early life and education ==
Hayley Catherine Rose Vivien Mills was born on 18 April 1946, in Marylebone, London, to British actor Sir John Mills and actress Mary Hayley Bell. Her sister is actress Juliet Mills and her brother writer and producer Jonathan Mills.

== Child actress ==
Mills was 12 when she was cast by J. Lee Thompson, who was initially looking for a boy to play the lead role, in &quot;Tiger Bay&quot; (1959) which co-starred her father. The movie was popular at the box office in Britain.

===Disney===
Bill Anderson, one of Walt Disney&#x27;s producers, saw &quot;Tiger Bay&quot; and suggested that Mills be given the lead role in &quot;Pollyanna&quot; (1960). The role of the orphaned &quot;glad girl&quot; who moves in with her aunt catapulted her to stardom in the United States and earned her a special Academy Award of Juvenile Oscar, the last person to win the accolade. Because she could not be present to receive the trophy, Annette Funicello accepted it on her behalf. Disney subsequently cast Mills as twins Sharon and Susan who reunite their divorced parents in &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961). In the film, she sings &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot; as a duet with herself. The song was a hit around the world, reaching number 8 in the US.

Mills received an offer to make a film in Britain for Bryan Forbes, &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; (1961), based on a novel by her mother Mary Hayley Bell, about some children who believe an escaped convict is Jesus. It was a hit at the British box office and she was voted the biggest star in Britain for 1961. Mills was offered the title role in &quot;Lolita&quot; by Stanley Kubrick, but her father turned it down. &quot;I wish I had done it&quot;, she said in 1962. &quot;It was a smashing film.&quot; Mills returned to Disney for an adventure film, &quot;In Search of the Castaways&quot; (1962), based on a novel by Jules Verne. It was another popular success, and she was voted the fifth biggest star in the country for the next two years.

In 1963, Disney announced plans to film an adaptation of Dodie Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot;, with Mills in the role of Cassandra. Disney ended up dropping the project, while still retaining film rights to the book, when the novelist and the selected screenwriter Sally Benson did not get along; Mills grew too old for the part before the project could be revived. Her fourth movie for Disney did less well than her previous Disney films, but was still successful: &quot;Summer Magic&quot; (1963), a musical adaptation of the novel &quot;Mother Carey&#x27;s Chickens&quot;. Ross Hunter hired her for a British-American production &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; (1964), playing a girl who torments governess Deborah Kerr. Back at Disney she was in a film about jewel thieves, &quot;The Moon-Spinners&quot; (1964), getting her first on screen kiss from Peter McEnery. Mills had a change of pace with &quot;Sky West and Crooked&quot; (1965), set in the world of gypsies, written by her mother and directed by her father, but it was not commercially successful. In contrast, her last film with Disney, the comedy &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; (also 1965), did very well at the box office.

During her six-year run at Disney, Mills was arguably the most popular child actress of the era. Critics noted that America&#x27;s favourite child star was, in fact, quite British and very ladylike. The success of &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot; (which hit No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, No. 17 in Britain, No. 1 in Mexico, and No. 29 in Canada) also led to the release of a record album on Disney&#x27;s Buena Vista label, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together with Hayley Mills&quot;, which also included another hit song, &quot;Johnny Jingo&quot; (Billboard No. 21, 1962; Canada No. 19). In 1962, British exhibitors voted her the most popular film actress in the country. A third single, &quot;Castaway&quot;, reached No. 14 in Canada.

In &quot;Forever Young: A Memoir,&quot; among other topics, she reveals high points from her early career, as well as struggles with self-esteem and an eating disorder. Describing how she turned down roles that &quot;undermined the Disney image&quot; such as &quot;Doctor Doolittle&quot; and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot;, she wrote that &quot;I think by being under contract to Walt Disney, as much as I really appreciated the opportunity it gave me, [and] the career it gave me, quite frankly, it hampered me from getting more different kinds of roles and eventually it also influenced how I felt about myself. I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was capable of.&quot; Ultimately, at age 20, she turned down a new Disney contract. She felt her character castings led to her &quot;repeating herself&quot; with the studio. She also detailed, how at age 21, she lost most of her Disney fortune to a 90% tax rate implemented by the Inland Revenue in England. Her appeal to regain her funds was eventually shot down, with Mills admitting that at that time, she was worried about going the path of Judy Garland and becoming a &quot;studio asset&quot;.

==Post-Disney film career==
For Universal, Mills made another film with her father, &quot;The Truth About Spring&quot; (1965), co-starring Disney regular James MacArthur as her love interest. It was mildly popular. However &quot;The Trouble with Angels&quot; (1966), was a huge hit; she played a prankish Catholic boarding school girl with &quot;scathingly brilliant&quot; schemes, opposite screen veteran Rosalind Russell, and directed by another Hollywood veteran, Ida Lupino. She then provided the voice of the Little Mermaid for &quot;The Daydreamer&quot; (1966). 

Shortly after &quot;The Truth About Spring&quot;, Mills appeared alongside her father and Hywel Bennett in director Roy Boulting&#x27;s critically acclaimed film &quot;The Family Way&quot; (1966), a drama about a couple having difficulty consummating their marriage, featuring a score by Paul McCartney and arrangements by Beatles producer George Martin. She began a romantic relationship with Boulting and they eventually married, in 1971. She then starred as the protagonist of &quot;Pretty Polly&quot; (1967), opposite famous Indian film actor Shashi Kapoor, in Singapore. 

Mills made another movie for Boulting, the controversial horror thriller &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; in 1968, along with her &quot;Family Way&quot; co-star Hywel Bennett. She made a comedy, &quot;Take a Girl Like You&quot; (1970), with Oliver Reed and made her West End debut in &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; in 1970. She worked for Boulting again on &quot;Mr. Forbush and the Penguins&quot; (1971), replacing the original female lead.

In 1972 Mills again acted opposite Hywel Bennett in &quot;Endless Night&quot; along with Britt Ekland, Per Oscarsson and George Sanders. It is based on the novel &quot;Endless Night&quot; by Agatha Christie. She made two films for Sidney Hayers, &quot;What Changed Charley Farthing?&quot; (1974) and &quot;Deadly Strangers&quot; (1975). After &quot;The Kingfisher Caper&quot; in 1975, co-written by Boulting, she dropped out of the film industry for a few years.

According to one writer, &quot;She was a movie star for about a decade... a genuine, old-school, above-the-title movie star: listed in box-office polls, the focus of a carefully-protected public image, signatory to a long-term contract with a studio who would try to craft vehicles for her. In fact, you could make an argument that Hayley Mills was one of the last stars for whom that last factor applied, at least in English-speaking cinema.&quot;

==Television resurgence and reception==
In 1981, Mills returned to acting with a starring role in the UK television mini-series &quot;The Flame Trees of Thika&quot;, based on Elspeth Huxley&#x27;s memoir of her childhood in East Africa. The series was well received, prompting her to accept more acting roles. She then returned to America and made two appearances on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; in 1985, and an episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in 1986. 

Always welcomed at Disney, Mills narrated an episode of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, sparking renewed interest in her Disney work. In 1985, she was originally considered to voice Princess Eilonwy in Disney&#x27;s animated feature film &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, but was later replaced by the veteran British voice actress Susan Sheridan. Later, she reprised her roles as twins Sharon and Susan for a trio of &quot;Parent Trap&quot; television films: &quot;The Parent Trap II&quot;, &quot;Parent Trap III&quot;, and &quot;Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon&quot;. She also starred as the title character in the Disney Channel-produced television series &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; in 1987. The show was cancelled after 13 episodes and the rights were acquired by NBC, which reformatted &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; into &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; without any further involvement from Mills. In recognition of her work with The Walt Disney Company, she was awarded the Disney Legends award in 1998.

Mills recalled her childhood in the 2000 documentary film &quot;Sir John Mills&#x27; Moving Memories&quot;, which was directed by Marcus Dillistone and produced by her brother Jonathan. In 2005 she appeared in the acclaimed short film, &quot;Stricken&quot;, written and directed by Jayce Bartok. From 2007 to 2012, she appeared as Caroline in the ITV1 African vet drama &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;; her sister Juliet Mills was a guest star in the drama, which was the first time they had appeared on screen together. 

In 2010, Mills appeared in &quot;Mandie and the Cherokee Treasure&quot;, based on one of the popular &quot;Mandie&quot; novels of Lois Gladys Leppard. In 2011, she starred in the film &quot;Foster&quot; alongside Toni Collette. Mills guest-starred in episodes of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; and &quot;Moving On&quot; in 2014. In 2019, she had a role in the television series &quot;Pitching In&quot; set at a holiday park in Wales. In 2021, Mills played Michael Sheen&#x27;s mother in the film &quot;Last Train to Christmas&quot;, and in 2022 she had a recurring role in the television thriller series &quot;Compulsion&quot;. 

In February 2023 she appeared in the fifth series of the ITV crime drama &quot;Unforgotten&quot; as Lady Emma Hume. In September 2023, Mills appeared in an episode of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;.

==Stage career==
Mills made her stage debut in a 1969 West End revival of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. 

In 1991 she appeared as Anna Leonowens in the Australian production of &quot;The King and I&quot;. In 1997, Mills starred in the U.S. national tour of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The King and I&quot;.

In 2000 she made her Off-Broadway debut in Sir Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Suite in Two Keys&quot;, opposite American actress Judith Ivey, for which she won a Theatre World Award. In 2001, Mills starred as Desiree Armfeldt in a production of &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; in Seattle, Washington. It was a co-production with the city&#x27;s A Contemporary Theatre and the Fifth Avenue Theatre. 

In December 2007, for their annual birthday celebration of &quot;The Master&quot;, &quot;The Noël Coward Society&quot; invited Mills as the guest celebrity to lay flowers in front of Coward&#x27;s statue at New York&#x27;s &quot;Gershwin Theatre&quot;, thereby commemorating the anniversary of the 108th birthday of Coward. 

In 2012 she starred as Ursula Widdington in the stage production of &quot;Ladies in Lavender&quot; at the Royal &amp; Derngate Theatre, before embarking on a national UK tour. In 2015, she toured Australia with sister Juliet Mills and Juliet&#x27;s husband Maxwell Caulfield in the comedy &quot;Legends!&quot; by James Kirkwood.
Mills starred in the 2018 Off-Broadway run of Isobel Mahon&#x27;s &quot;Party Face&quot; at City Center.

==Personal life==

In 1966, while filming &quot;The Family Way&quot;, 20-year-old Mills met 53-year-old director Roy Boulting. The two were married in 1971 and owned a flat in London&#x27;s Chelsea and Cobstone Windmill in Ibstone, Buckinghamshire, which was later sold. Their son, Crispian Mills, is the lead singer and guitarist for the raga rock band Kula Shaker. The couple divorced in 1977.

Mills had a second son, Jason Lawson, born in July 1976, during a relationship with actor Leigh Lawson. She and Lawson split up in the early 1980s.

In the 1980s, following her breakup with Lawson, Mills developed an interest in a number of Eastern religions. She wrote the preface to the book &quot;The Hare Krishna Book of Vegetarian Cooking&quot;, published in 1984, although she was not a member of Hare Krishna. In 1988, Mills co-edited, with Marcus Maclaine, &quot;My God: Letters from the Famous on God and the Life Hereafter&quot; (Pelham Books, 1988).

Mills&#x27;s partner since 1997 and as of 2023 is actor/writer Firdous Bamji, who is 20 years her junior. They met when touring playing the lead roles in &quot;The King and I&quot;.

==Health==
In April 2008, Mills was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had surgery and started, but quickly abandoned, chemotherapy after only three sessions because of the severity of the side effects. She credits her survival to the alternative treatments she used. She told &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine in January 2012 that she had fully recovered.

==Memoir==
Mills published a memoir about her life and career, &quot;Forever Young: A Memoir,&quot; in September 2021.

<text>Claude Miller Jarman Jr. (September 27, 1934 – January 12, 2025) was an American actor. He became a child star with his role as Jody Baxter in &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1946), for which he won an Academy Juvenile Award. Further roles in films like &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; (1949) and &quot;Rio Grande&quot; (1950) followed. Jarman largely retired from acting in early adulthood and later served as executive director of the San Francisco International Film Festival, and director of Cultural Affairs for the City of San Francisco.

== Life ==
===Early life===
Jarman was born in Nashville, Tennessee, the son of Mildred (Freeman) and Claude Miller Jarman, an accountant for the railroad. As a child, he acted in productions of The Nashville Community Playhouse&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Theatre.

=== Child star ===
Jarman was 10 years old and in the fifth grade in Nashville when he was discovered in a nationwide talent search by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was cast as Jody Baxter in the film &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1946), a high-budget film adaptation of the novel by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, in which Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman played his parents. His performance received glowing reviews and, as a result, he received a special Academy Award as outstanding child actor of 1946. 

He continued his studies at the MGM studio school, and made a total of 11 films. His second film role was in &quot;High Barbaree&quot;, playing the younger version of Van Johnson&#x27;s main character. 

Jarman is also notable for his starring role as teenager Chick Mallison in the 1949 William Faulkner adaption &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot;, which tackled the subject of racism and segregation in the southern states in an unusually open way for a Hollywood film of that time. In April 1949, he appeared with more than four dozen Hollywood stars in a famous photo to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving person from that photo session.

The following year, he had another large role as the son of John Wayne and Maureen O&#x27;Hara in John Ford&#x27;s western &quot;Rio Grande&quot;. Jarman, who portrayed a young soldier in the film, learned roman riding for the role.

=== Adulthood ===
Republic Studios cast him in a couple of B-movies during the early 1950s, but by the time he reached his early adulthood, his acting career was in decline. He subsequently moved back to Tennessee to finish college at Vanderbilt University. Following coursework in pre-law at Vanderbilt, Jarman appeared in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot; (1956), his final movie. After that, he served three years in the U.S. Navy, doing public relations work.

Jarman moved to working behind the scenes. He ran the San Francisco International Film Festival for 15 years (1965–1980) and was known for his in-depth retrospectives of movie stars and directors. He was executive producer of the music documentary film &quot;Fillmore&quot; (1972), about rock impresario Bill Graham.

Jarman briefly returned to acting in 1978, for the television miniseries &quot;Centennial&quot;. He was a special guest at the 70th and 75th Academy Award telecasts, in 1998 and 2003 respectively, as a past acting award winner at the Oscar Family Album retrospectives.

Jarman served as director of cultural affairs for the City of San Francisco. He founded Jarman Travel Inc. in 1986 to serve the travel needs of corporations and executives. 

Jarman wrote &quot;My Life and the Final Days of Hollywood&quot;, which was published in 2018.

==Personal life and death==
Jarman married his first wife, Virginia, in 1959. They had three children: Elizabeth Suddeth, Claude Jarman III, and Murray Jarman, before their 1968 divorce. Jarman married his second wife, Maryann, in 1968. They had two daughters together, Vanessa Getty and Natalie Jarman, before their 1983 divorce. Jarman married his third wife, Katharine, in 1986, with whom he had twin daughters, Charlotte and Sarah. Jarman died at his home in Kentfield, California, on January 12, 2025, at the age of 90.

<text>Marble Mountain is a ski resort located in the town of Steady Brook, on the west coast of Newfoundland in the Long Range Mountains.

The resort is located on a series of steep ridges forming part of the southern side of the Humber River valley on Mount Musgrave at Steady Brook, approximately east of Corner Brook. As the name implies, marble is present but it forms only a minor part of the bedrock, which is mostly schist. The peak is named in honour of Sir Anthony Musgrave, a colonial governor of Newfoundland.

Lower elevations of Marble Mountain outside of the ski lanes are covered with a rich mixed forest of abundant balsam fir, white spruce, black spruce and white birch, with some red maple and mountain maple. At higher elevations, black spruce is often dominant and deciduous trees are less abundant.

Marble Mountain is the site of the largest alpine ski resort in Atlantic Canada. Environment Canada&#x27;s doppler weather radar station &quot;XME&quot;, part of the Canadian weather radar network is located near the resort at the summit of Mount Musgrave.

The Marble Mountain Ski Resort is known to have some of the best skiing east of the Rockies with an average of of snow each year, compared to Mont Tremblant&#x27;s . This produces a three-month ski season. In the winter of 2013/2014, the resort saw more than 21 feet of natural snowfall and in the 2014/2015 season, nearly 20 feet of natural snow fell. Marble Mountain was a key venue for the 1999 Canada Winter Games hosted by Corner Brook.

Marble Mountain boasts the only detachable high speed quad lift in Atlantic Canada, the Lightning Express. It is in length and has a ride time of approximately 7 minutes.

On June 29, 2018, the provincial government announced that it would be seeking a request for proposals to divest the government of ownership of Marble Mountain. The resort has been operated by the provincial government since 1988 through the Marble Mountain Development Corporation. The ski hill receives an annual subsidy of close to $1 million.

As of late June 2022 moves are under way to make Marble Mountain an all-season resort with more emphasis on summer recreation.
