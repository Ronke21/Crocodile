<text>The Romanian Greek Catholic Church or Romanian Church United with Rome is a &quot;sui iuris&quot; Eastern Catholic Church, in full union with the Catholic Church. It has the rank of a Major Archiepiscopal Church and it uses the Byzantine liturgical rite in the Romanian language. It is part of the Major Archiepiscopal Churches of the Catholic Church that are not distinguished with a patriarchal title.

Cardinal Lucian Mureșan, Archbishop of Făgăraș and Alba Iulia, has served as the head of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church since 1994. On December 16, 2005, as the &quot;Romanian Church United with Rome&quot;, the Greek-Catholic church was elevated to the rank of a Major Archiepiscopal Church by Pope Benedict XVI, with Lucian Mureșan becoming its first major archbishop. Mureşan was made a cardinal, at the consistory of February 18, 2012.

Besides the Archeparchy of Făgăraș and Alba Iulia, there are five more Greek-Catholic eparchies in Romania (Eparchy of Oradea Mare, Eparchy of Cluj-Gherla, Eparchy of Lugoj, Eparchy of Maramureș, and Eparchy of Saint Basil the Great of Bucharest), as well as one eparchy overseas, the Romanian Catholic Eparchy of St George&#x27;s in Canton, answering directly to the Major Archbishop and the Holy See, in the United States of America and Canada.

According to data published in the 2016 &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;, the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church had 504,280 members, 8 bishops, 1,225 parishes, some 835 diocesan priests and 235 seminarians of its own rite at the end of 2012. However, according to the 2011 Romanian government census, the number of its followers living in Romania was as low as 150,593, of whom 124,563 are ethnic Romanians. By 2022, however, the church estimated their numbers have grown to 488,000, as many citizens whose ancestors had converted to Orthodoxy or embraced Marxist-Leninist atheism under the Communist regime have chosen to rejoin the Greek Catholic Church. 

The vast majority of the Romanian diocesan priests in Romania are married.

In addition, there are five other Catholic dioceses in Romania, belonging to the Latin Church, whose members are more numerous.

==History==


Following the Habsburg conquest of Transylvania in 1687, Metropolitan Atanasie Anghel entered into full communion with the See of Rome by the Act of Union of 1698, that was formalized by a synod of bishops on September 4, 1700. This was part of the process the unification of the Romanian Orthodox population to the Catholic Church (Rome&#x27;s Church) newly created Greek Catholic Church, the former Orthodox Church of Romanians from Transylvania. 

By entering into the Union, Atanasie and the other bishops, along with their respective dioceses, accepted the supreme authority of the Pope, while at the same time being granted the right to keep their own Greek Byzantine liturgical rite. A diploma issued by the Emperor Leopold I declared that Transylvania&#x27;s Romanian Orthodox Church is one with the Catholic Church and Holy See. Transylvanian Romanians were therefore encouraged to convert to Catholicism and join to the Romanian Unified Church (Greek-Catholic Church), while being able to retain the Byzantine rite, if at the same time they accepted four doctrinal points promulgated by the Council of Florence (1431 and 1445): the supreme authority of the Pope over the entire church; the existence of Purgatory; the Filioque clause; and the validity of the use of unleavened bread in the celebration of the Eucharist in the Latin Church (Eastern Orthodox had contended that Latin Catholic use of unleavened bread was erroneous).

The step undertaken by Metropolitan Atanasie Anghel and his Holy Synod obtained for the ethnic Romanians of Transylvania (then part of the Habsburg monarchy) equal rights with those of the other Transylvanian nations, which were part of the Unio Trium Nationum: the Hungarian nobility, the Transylvanian Saxons, and the Székely. This event coincided with the arrival of the Jesuits in Transylvania (second time), who attempted to align this province more closely with Western Europe. However, Orthodox Serbian authority and Protestant Transylvanian nobility were not willing to accept Romanians Orthodox converts, and this in turn led to the formation of Romanian Orthodox movements that advocated for freedom of worship for the entire Transylvanian population – most notable the movements led by serbian monk Visarion Sarai, Nicolae Oprea Miclăuş, and the bosniac monk Sofronie of Cioara, under the influence of the dominant Serbian Orthodox Church.

In 1721, the Bishop&#x27;s Residence was moved from Alba Iulia to Făgăraș, and eventually to Blaj (1737). Following this change, Blaj became a center of learning and national awakening for all Romanians..

In 1761, Petru Pavel Aron (1709–1764), the Bishop of Făgăraș and head of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, translated &quot;Biblia Vulgata&quot; into Romanian. While the Romanian Orthodox kept Church Slavonic as the official liturgical language till 1863, the Romanian Church United with Rome has been using the Romanian vernacular ever since its inception. In the 19th century, during a time when the Hungarian government was pursuing a Magyarization policy in Transylvania, the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church, with the aid of the Transylvanian School &quot;(Școala Ardeleană)&quot; and the Transylvanian Memorandum, played a prominent role in resisting ethnic assimilation attempts. Moreover, many leading figures of the Romanian emancipation movement in Transylvania, such as Simion Bărnuțiu and Iuliu Maniu, began their careers as lay servants of the Greek-Catholic Church.

Additional Greek-Catholic Eparchies were eventually set up at Oradea (1777), as well as Gherla and Lugoj (1853); Blaj, under the title of Eparchy of Alba Iulia and Făgăraș, became the Metropolitan (i.e. Archiepiscopal) See. On December 16, 2005, the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church was elevated to the rank of Major Archiepiscopal Church.

===Persecution under Communism===

After assuming political power in 1948, the Communist regime, rooted in Marxist–Leninist atheism, deposed all 12 bishops of the Greek-Catholic Church on Stalin&#x27;s orders. Moreover, on October 21, 1948, the 250th anniversary of the Romanian Greek Catholic Union with the Catholic Church, the regime arranged for the &quot;voluntary&quot; and &quot;spontaneous&quot; transfer of all members of the Greek-Catholic Church (decree 358/1948), that numbered more than 1,500,000 at the time, to the Romanian Orthodox Church; furthermore, the property rights over many of the Greek-Catholic Church&#x27;s possessions, including its four cathedrals, were transferred to the Romanian Orthodox Church, while the remainder of those properties were confiscated by the Romanian State.

The Greek-Catholic bishops, along with many of their priests, were accused by the newly installed Communist authorities of &quot;antidemocratic activity&quot;. After refusing to give up their ties with the &quot;reactionary&quot; Holy See, they were imprisoned. At about the same time, the Orthodox Church was being &quot;purged&quot; of priests hostile to the Communist regime. Following this purge, the Orthodox hierarchy enjoyed good and unforced relations with the Communist authorities for the remainder of the Communist Rule of Romania.

Iuliu Hossu, Bishop of Cluj, turned down a proposal of the Romanian Orthodox Patriarch, Iustinian Marina, to convert to Orthodoxy and be named Orthodox Archbishop of Iaşi and metropolitan of Moldavia, and thereby become the official successor of the Romanian Orthodox Patriarch himself. Consequently, Hossu remained under house arrest. Year after year, he sent Memorandums to the President of the Republic, requesting that the country&#x27;s laws and international agreements be observed with regard to the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church. In 1969, Pope Paul VI asked Hossu to allow himself to be made a cardinal. As Hossu was reluctant to leave Romania, the pope made him a cardinal only &quot;in pectore&quot;, i.e. without publishing the fact, and this was only revealed on March 5, 1973, three years after Hossu&#x27;s death.

Another remarkable Romanian Greek-Catholic ecclesiastic of the time was Alexandru Todea (1912–2002). Secretly consecrated a bishop on November 19, 1950, he was arrested and the following year he was sentenced to life in prison. He was granted amnesty in 1964. On March 14, 1990, after the fall of the Communist regime, he was appointed Archbishop of Făgăraș and Alba Iulia, and was made a cardinal the following year.

After more than 40 years of clandestine existence, the Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic re-emerged publicly, in the wake of the Romanian Revolution. Normative Act 9/31, passed on December 31, 1989, repealed Decree 358/1948 (that outlawed the Greek-Catholic Church) as repugnant and bringing grave prejudice upon the Romanian state.

Only after much struggle and considerable delays, some of the Church&#x27;s properties, in particular the cathedrals of Cluj, Blaj, Lugoj, and Oradea, were restored to their rightful owner. However, much of the original property remains in Romanian Orthodox or government hands, as the persecution started in 1948 has led to a marked reduction in the numbers of Romanian Greek Catholic faithful. After 40 years of Communist rule and forced assimilation into the regime-approved Orthodox Church, numerous Romanian cradle Greek-Catholics remained in the Romanian Orthodox Church, at least on paper, and it is unclear how many of these nominal Orthodox members remain crypto-Catholic, especially in northern Transylvania where most Greek Catholics lived (as shown on the maps to the right). Other Greek Catholic Romanians switched to the Latin Church, and now account for the second-largest group in that denomination after Hungarians. The Romanian Church United with Rome is still undergoing a process of recovery from the wounds inflicted by the Communist rulers and the forced merger.

===Property issues since the fall of Communism===
Since the fall of Communism, Church leaders have claimed that the Romanian Greek-Catholic Community is facing a cultural and religious wipe-out: the Greek-Catholic churches are allegedly being destroyed by representatives of the Romanian Orthodox Church, whose actions allegedly enjoy not only the acceptance, but also the support of the Romanian authorities.

<text>Shiver and Shake was a British comic magazine published every Monday by IPC Magazines Ltd. It ran from (issue dates) 10 March 1973 to 5 October 1974, when it merged with &quot;Whoopee!&quot; As often happens with British comics, many names of strips were a play on popular television programmes and films of the time. The theme of the strips were mainly horror (albeit of a comic nature); similar to the later &quot;Monster Fun&quot;; indeed, &quot;Frankie Stein&quot; appeared in both comics. 

In an idea borrowed from the successful &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot;, it was two comics in one; &quot;Shake&quot; being a pull-out section from &quot;Shiver&quot;. The main star of &quot;Shiver&quot; was a ghost of the same name, while the eponymous &quot;Shake&quot; was an elephant. Both had their own strips in their respective sections (&quot;The Duke&#x27;s Spook&quot; and &quot;Shake&quot;). In 1973, the comic also featured a one-page strip starring stand-up comedian Charlie Williams.

&quot;Shiver and Shake&quot; ran for 79 issues. It also had eight specials, from 1973 to 1980, and 13 annuals, from 1974 to 1986.

<text>The Schauder fixed-point theorem is an extension of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to topological vector spaces, which may be of infinite dimension. It asserts that if formula_1 is a nonempty convex closed subset of a Hausdorff topological vector space formula_2 and formula_3 is a continuous mapping of formula_1 into itself such that formula_5 is contained in a compact subset of formula_1, then formula_3 has a fixed point.

A consequence, called [[Helmut Schaefer|Schaefer]]&#x27;s fixed-point theorem, is particularly useful for proving existence of solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations.
Schaefer&#x27;s theorem is in fact a special case of the far reaching Leray–Schauder theorem which was proved earlier by Juliusz Schauder and Jean Leray.
The statement is as follows:

Let formula_3 be a continuous and compact mapping of a Banach space formula_9 into itself, such that the set

: formula_10

is bounded. Then formula_3 has a fixed point. (A &quot;compact mapping&quot; in this context is one for which the image of every bounded set is relatively compact.)

==History==
The theorem was conjectured and proven for special cases, such as Banach spaces, by Juliusz Schauder in 1930. His conjecture for the general case was published in the Scottish book. In 1934, Tychonoff proved the theorem for the case when &quot;K&quot; is a compact convex subset of a locally convex space. This version is known as the Schauder–Tychonoff fixed-point theorem. B. V. Singbal proved the theorem for the more general case where &quot;K&quot; may be non-compact; the proof can be found in the appendix of Bonsall&#x27;s book (see references).

<doc id="638205" wikidata="Q3180208" url="?curid=638205" title="Joe Volpe">
<text>Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Volpe (born September 21, 1947) is a Canadian politician. He represented the Ontario riding of Eglinton-Lawrence as a member of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons of Canada from 1988 until 2011, when he lost his seat to Conservative candidate Joe Oliver. Volpe held two senior positions in Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s Cabinet from 2003 to 2006, and served as transportation critic when his party became the Official Opposition. In 2006, he ran unsuccessfully for the Liberal Party leadership.

==Background==
Volpe was born in Monteleone di Puglia, in southern Italy, and migrated to Canada with his family in 1955. As a teacher, he taught in Stoney Creek from 1971 to 1974, headed the history department of a secondary school in Etobicoke from 1974 to 1979, and was head of multicultural studies in a college in Weston, Ontario between 1979 and 1982. He worked as a mortgage development officer in 1982–83, and was vice-principal of the James Cardinal McGuigan Catholic High School (which he helped found) between 1983 and 1988.

He is married to Mirella and they have four children.

==Early political career==

Volpe first became involved with the Liberal Party in the 1968 federal election, when he worked on Charles Caccia&#x27;s campaign in Davenport. He ran for the North York Board of Education in the 1974 municipal election as a separate school representative, but was defeated. He later ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1981 provincial election and narrowly lost to New Democratic Party incumbent Odoardo Di Santo in Downsview. The following year, he supported David Peterson for the Ontario Liberal Party leadership.

Volpe subsequently chaired the sponsoring group of an immigrant counseling agency called Alliance Community Services, which received a controversial $500,000 grant from the federal government in January 1984. Local municipal politicians Howard Moscoe and Maria Rizzo charged that the ACS was a partisan organization and that the grant was political patronage; Volpe and others rejected this charge. Maria Minna, the president of COSTI-IIAS Immigrant Services, opposed the grant on the grounds that the new organization would duplicate the work of her organization. Employment and Immigration Minister John Roberts retracted the grant following criticism, but later reversed himself and allowed it to proceed. The ACS dissolved in early 1985.

Volpe increased his profile in the mid-1980s by recruiting many new Liberal Party members from Toronto&#x27;s Italian community. He helped influence several party nomination contests, including John Nunziata&#x27;s 1984 victory over Paul Hellyer in York South—Weston. Some questioned Volpe&#x27;s methods and suggested that he was manipulating the system by signing up &quot;instant party members&quot;, a charge that he denied. He endorsed John Roberts in the 1984 federal Liberal leadership convention, and threw his support to Jean Chrétien on the second ballot after Roberts withdrew from the contest. The winning candidate was John Turner, who led the Liberal Party to defeat in the 1984 federal election.

Volpe unsuccessfully campaigned for the presidency of the Ontario Liberal Party in 1985 and 1986, against media speculation that leading figures in the party opposed his candidacy. Despite Volpe&#x27;s earlier support for Chrétien, he organized a pro-Turner slate for the Liberal Party&#x27;s 1986 leadership review. Turner, who was faced with public and backroom challenges since 1984, received the necessary support to consolidate his leadership. Volpe spoke out against the Meech Lake Accord the following year, while most of the Liberal leadership supported it.

==Member of Parliament==

===Nomination challenge===

Volpe successfully challenged sitting Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Rev. Roland de Corneille to win the party&#x27;s nomination for Eglinton—Lawrence in the 1988 election. The contest was extremely divisive, with de Corneille alleging that Volpe was &quot;trying to organize a group for his personal advantage&quot; in recruiting new members from the riding&#x27;s Italian community.

After losing the nomination, de Corneille endorsed Progressive Conservative candidate Tony Abbott, who was himself a former Liberal cabinet minister. Volpe defended his right to seek the nomination, arguing that Toronto&#x27;s Italian residents were seeking to play a more active role in government. He also sought a reconciliation with de Corneille&#x27;s supporters, many of whom were from the riding&#x27;s Jewish community. Despite the divisions engendered by his nomination, Volpe won a convincing victory on election day.

===Opposition member, 1988–1993===

The Progressive Conservatives were re-elected with a majority government in the 1988 election and Volpe sat as a member of the official opposition for the next five years, serving as his party&#x27;s revenue critic for part of this time. During the constitutional debates of the early 1990s, he suggested that the Parliament of Canada (as opposed to the executive branch of government) should assume responsibility for reformulating the terms of Canadian Confederation. He argued that parliament represented a strong cross-section of Canada&#x27;s population, saying that parliamentary initiative on constitutional reform could save millions of dollars on &quot;needless commissions&quot;.

Volpe supported Paul Martin in the 1990 federal Liberal leadership convention, which was won by Jean Chrétien. He subsequently opposed some of Chrétien&#x27;s reforms to the Liberal Party constitution, including a change that allowed the leader to appoint candidates in selected ridings. Several Chrétien supporters defended this as necessary to prevent &quot;instant party members&quot; from taking over the party nomination process; many believe the change was directed against both Volpe and the Liberals for Life group affiliated with MP Tom Wappel.

Volpe remained one of Martin&#x27;s most prominent Toronto-area supporters after 1990. Many political observers believe this association kept him out of cabinet during Chrétien&#x27;s tenure as prime minister, from 1993 to 2003.

===Government backbencher===

The Liberals won a majority government in the 1993 election, and Volpe sat as a government backbencher in the parliament that followed. He was elected chair of the Ontario Liberal caucus following the election, but unexpectedly lost the position to a challenge from Sue Barnes in 1995. On 23 February 1996, he was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Minister of National Health and Welfare. The ministry was renamed on 12 July 1996, and Volpe&#x27;s position was restyled as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Health, a position he held until 15 July 1998.

Volpe was easily re-elected to parliament in the 1997 election. His closest opponent was Progressive Conservative candidate David Rotenberg, a former minister in the provincial government of Frank Miller. Volpe later endorsed Mel Lastman&#x27;s bid to become Mayor of Toronto in 1997 municipal election.

Volpe served as chair of the all-party Commons Health Committee after the 1997 election. He brought forward a report in late 1998 encouraging the sale of herbal medicines in Canada, and advocating their regulation in a category separate from foods and drugs. The following year, his committee produced a series of recommendations for improving Canada&#x27;s organ donation system.

Volpe was also given responsibility for overseeing Canada&#x27;s investigation of a controversial vitamin-hormone cancer treatment run by Luigi di Bella in Italy. Some of Di Bella&#x27;s supporters believed that his treatments actually cured cancer, and requested that their government investigate the possibility of assisting his research. Volpe led a delegation of Canadian doctors to Italy, arguing that they would either expose Di Bella as a fraud or establish the terms for assistance: they concluded there was no evidence to support the validity of his work. Volpe initially recommended that further research be conducted, arguing the doctor&#x27;s treatment could lead to an improved quality of life for cancer patients even if it did not actually cure the disease.

In 1999, Volpe argued that the government&#x27;s proposed Citizenship Act was too restrictive and arbitrary, saying that it could result in reduced immigration to Canada. He and fellow MP Andrew Telegdi were particularly critical of a section of the bill which allowed cabinet ministers to override the judicial system in rejecting applications from immigrants. He voted against the bill on its final reading in May 2000.

Volpe was not promoted to cabinet in the August 1999 cabinet shuffle. He served as chair of the Commons Standing Committee on Natural Resources in 2000, and developed a report for improving Canada&#x27;s national highway system. He also collaborated with Toronto-area MPs Derek Lee and John McKay to create a job placement and training program for at-risk youth in Toronto, called Workplace Connections. He described as &quot;unfortunate&quot; Canada&#x27;s decision to support a United Nations resolution critical of Israel in October 2000, and later argued that Canada should have abstained. During the 2000 campaign, Volpe advocated tax breaks for parents who send their children to private religious schools. He was re-elected without difficulty.

Volpe sought re-appointment as chair of the Natural Resources committee in 2001, but did not receive the position. He became increasingly critical of the Chrétien government during the next two years, and made no secret of his support for Paul Martin to replace Chrétien as party leader. Volpe criticized the Chrétien government for moving too slowly to replace Canada&#x27;s aging Sea King helicopters, and encouraged the government to purchase the EH-101 Cormorant helicopters recommended by the previous Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. In November 2002, he called for the government to provide compensation for all victims of Hepatitis C who were infected through the national blood supply system, and criticized the Chrétien government&#x27;s more restrictive settlement. He also expressed skepticism about the Chrétien government&#x27;s plans to decriminalize cannabis, saying &quot;I believe it&#x27;s a gateway drug. [...] It&#x27;s going to be a pretty convincing argument to get me to vote for it.&quot; He was an opponent of the government&#x27;s plans to legalize same-sex marriage during this period, and voted to retain the traditional definition of marriage in 2003.

Volpe worked openly for Paul Martin&#x27;s bid to replace Chrétien as Liberal Party leader after June 2002, when Martin left Chrétien&#x27;s cabinet under disputed circumstances. In June 2002, Volpe became one of the first sixteen Liberal MPs to publicly call for Chrétien to resign as prime minister. During the same year, he became a founding member of the group Liberal Parliamentarians for Israel.

==Cabinet Minister==

===Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development===

Paul Martin won an overwhelming victory in the 2003 federal Liberal leadership convention, and became Prime Minister of Canada on December 12, 2003. He appointed Volpe to cabinet as Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, with responsibility for labour, homelessness, training, community economic development and federal student loans. He was also named as political minister for Ontario and the Greater Toronto Area, and was appointed to Martin&#x27;s priorities and planning committee, known as the inner cabinet. Soon after his appointment, Volpe announced that he would revamp the federal job skills and training programs to better meet the needs of employers. He argued that Canada needed significant skill upgrading reforms in order to retain its long-term employment prospects.

Volpe announced a new &quot;Compassionate Care&quot; benefit in January 2004, providing paid leave for Canadians who were forced to leave work to care for seriously ill family members. In May of the same year, he introduced reforms to Canada&#x27;s Employment Insurance laws making it easier for seasonal workers to apply for benefits. Volpe promised a number of spending initiatives during the 2004 federal election, including $1 billion over five years for research, development and innovation in the automotive industry.

The Liberals were reduced to a minority government in this election, although Volpe was re-elected by a comfortable margin in Eglinton—Lawrence. He was retained as Human Resources and Skills Development minister after the election.

In late 2004, Canadian Auditor General Sheila Fraser accused the federal government of violating the spirit of its laws by running a large surplus of Employment Insurance funds, arguing that the government was using money earmarked for the unemployed to fund separate programs. Volpe acknowledged there were problems with the EI system, but noted that rates were falling and would likely continue to fall in the future.

During the same period, federal Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Judy Sgro was criticized for granting a temporary residency permit to Romanian exotic dancer who had worked on her election campaign. Sgro denied she had done anything wrong, and argued that she granted the permit on compassionate grounds. In the aftermath of the controversy, the Martin government eliminated a federal program that allowed foreign-born exotic dancers to enter the country. Volpe was given credit for this decision and was quoted as saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel in the slightest bit comfortable with the program and I didn&#x27;t think there was any justification for it&quot;.

===Minister of Citizenship and Immigration===
Judy Sgro announced her resignation from cabinet on 14 January 2005, following accusations that she had offered to intervene in the immigration hearing of Harjit Singh in return for free food during the 2004 campaign (these accusations were later retracted and Sgro was cleared of any wrongdoing). Volpe was named as her successor. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper subsequently published an article which indicated that Sgro believed Volpe wanted her cabinet position, and further asserted that the two were rivals within the party. Volpe denied that he had anything to do with Sgro&#x27;s resignation and cast doubt on the veracity of the report, saying that Sgro had told him directly that she did not make the statement attributed to her.

Two days after his appointment, Volpe pledged to tighten Canada&#x27;s refugee system and to accelerate the processing time for individual claimants. He also promised to give illegal immigrant workers the means and opportunity to attain legal status in Canada, although rejecting the option of a blanket amnesty, and pledged to promote regional immigration outside of Canada&#x27;s major cities. In mid-February 2005, he announced that spouses and common-law partners living in Canada without legal status would be eligible to apply under the family class sponsorship program. In the same period, Volpe asked his department to work on building cases to revoke the citizenship of five suspected Nazi war criminals living in Canada.

In April 2005, Volpe announced that the Martin government would fast-track the admission of 110,000 wage earning immigrants into Canada. He also announced that Canada would try to cut the waiting time for citizenship applications from 18 to 12 months, and that the Martin government would triple the number of parents and grandparents eligible to enter Canada.

In late 2005, Volpe announced that his government would seek a 35% increase in immigration over five years. He noted that there was a pressing need for more skilled immigrants throughout all parts of the country, and suggested that trade skills be emphasized over university education in determining the success of individual applications. Some within the Liberal Party criticized his proposal, arguing that it would be more appropriate to fix current backlogs in the immigration system. Volpe also proposed legislation to make foreign-born adopted children automatic citizens of Canada. After the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, Volpe announced that the Canadian government would take steps to expedite the reunification of families affected by the tragedy.

In November 2005, Volpe released a strategic plan for a national immigration policy following consultation with provincial and territorial leaders. The plan included improved recognition of immigrants with professional skills, such as doctors.

Also in November, the House of Commons Immigration Committee voted 6–5 along party lines to block $168 million in new money for immigration programs. Volpe criticized the opposition committee members for voting down the funding, arguing that their decision would jeopardize several previously announced reforms. Some opposition members argued that Volpe had not adequately justified his department&#x27;s spending.

One of Volpe&#x27;s last major acts as Immigration Minister was to announce a $920 million immigration settlement deal with the Government of Ontario on 21 November 2005. Under the terms of the deal, the money was to be earmarked to help immigrants settle, integrate, and become proficient in the English language. In the same week, Volpe also announced the creation of an &quot;in-Canada&quot; economic class of immigrants, making it easier for people on temporary work permits to apply for citizenship. Volpe&#x27;s department argued that the change would match immigrants with skill shortages, which addressing backlogs in the immigration system.

===Minister responsible for Ontario and for the Greater Toronto Area===

In March 2004, Volpe announced the addition of nearly $8 million for existing crime prevention programs in Ontario. In May of the same year, he announced that the federal government would provide $1 billion in funding for GO Transit.

Also in May 2004, Volpe wrote an official letter to Toronto Mayor David Miller, promising that the federal government would not order the construction of a bridge to the Toronto City Centre Airport against the wishes of Toronto City Council. Miller had been elected in the 2003 municipal election on a promise to cancel the bridge, and had previously expressed concern that the federal Toronto Port Authority might authorize its construction even after the city withdrew support. Volpe later expressed concerns about the continued viability of the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corp., and emerged as a prominent critic of Miller&#x27;s plans for waterfront management.

In May 2005, Volpe announced that the federal government would pay $35 million to the Toronto Port Authority to in compensation for the cancellation of the Toronto Island Airport Bridge. In September of the same year, he announced that a piece of waterfront property at Yonge St. and Queen&#x27;s Quay would remain in public hands. Many regard this property as essential for any future strategy involving comprehensive waterfront renewal.

Volpe remained active with issues of interest to the Italian community in Toronto, and was a prominent supporter of RAI International&#x27;s bid to receive a television licence in Canada.

===Views and controversies===

Volpe reconsidered his position on same-sex marriage in 2004, and voted with the rest of cabinet to grant legal status to same-sex marriages in 2005. Critics accused him of opportunism for changing his position. Volpe responded by arguing that he had played a contributory role in creating balanced legislation that protects the rights of both minority groups and religious institutions.

In May 2005, two Conservative MPs were photographed posing with a poster from the &quot;Western Standard&quot; with the title &quot;The Liberano$&quot;, comparing the Liberal Party to the mafia television show The Sopranos. The poster was sparked by accusations made against the Liberal Party during the federal sponsorship scandal of 2004–05. Volpe argued that the poster was offensive to Canadians of Italian heritage, and commented &quot;These are the same Conservatives who think that every immigrant is a potential terrorist and criminal and everything else&quot;, and &quot;Notwithstanding that they don&#x27;t have their cowl and their cape, the Klan looks like they&#x27;re still very much alive.&quot; The Conservative Party demanded an apology from Volpe, who acknowledged that his words &quot;might have been a little intemperate&quot; because of what he interpreted as a &quot;racial slur&quot;.

In September 2005, it was reported that Volpe had claimed $10,891.15 in meal and transportation expenses over an eleven-month period. Opposition MPs argued that this figure was excessive, and noted that Volpe&#x27;s meal expenses were more than three times higher than his predecessor as Immigration Minister, Judy Sgro, during the same period a year earlier. Volpe argued that his schedule was extremely busy, and that he had to meet with &quot;many stakeholders&quot; in the course of his ministerial duties. There was at least one instance of Volpe charging for two separate meals on the same night. His staff argued that he had made arrangements to meet with two groups of people on the same night, and could not cancel either meeting. In March 2006, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation awarded Volpe with its 8th annual &quot;Teddy&quot; award as the previous year&#x27;s worst offender in federal government overspending.

==Opposition member, 2006–2011==
The three opposition parties united to bring down the Liberal government in late 2005, and a new election was called for January 2006. During the campaign, Volpe and Paul Martin announced that, if re-elected, their government would waive the $975 landing fee charged to immigrants. The Liberals were defeated, however, and the Conservative Party came to office with a minority government. Volpe was again re-elected without difficulty in his own riding. Following the election, he was named as official opposition critic to the President of the Treasury Board.

In early September 2006, Volpe announced that he would break with his party&#x27;s official position and support a softwood lumber deal negotiated by the Conservative government with the United States of America. In November of the same year, Volpe was one of fifteen Liberal MPs who voted against a resolution from Prime Minister Stephen Harper that recognized the Québécois as a nation within Canada.

===Leadership candidate===

Paul Martin resigned the Liberal leadership after the election, and a new leadership contest was scheduled for late 2006. Volpe announced his candidacy on April 21, 2006. During his campaign launch, he said, &quot;We don&#x27;t need to re-invent the Party. We just need to give it back to the people who are its rightful owners. We need to take it back from the backroom players who hide behind new faces.&quot; He highlighted education and training issues, and said that Canada should be more accommodating to new immigrants. Volpe also argued that Canada should return to a peacekeeping ethos in foreign affairs, rather than primarily engaging in combat missions. After the party&#x27;s first all-candidates debate, he accused frontrunner Michael Ignatieff of echoing the foreign policy vision of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

At the start of his campaign, Volpe was supported by Liberal MPs Jim Karygiannis, Wajid Khan, Yasmin Ratansi, Joe Comuzzi, Sukh Dhaliwal, Massimo Pacetti, and Lui Temelkovski, and former MPs Nick Discepola and Bob Speller. Dhaliwal, Karygiannis and Ratansi later withdrew their support.

====Apotex donations====

Volpe&#x27;s campaign was hindered by controversy. In May 2006, the Canadian media reported that he had received $108,000 in donations from current and former executives of the drug company Apotex Inc., and each of their spouses and children. All of the donations were for $5,400, the maximum allowed for individual donations under the law, while five cheques were in the names of children under eighteen years of age. Companies are banned from donating money to a federal leadership campaign and individuals are prohibited from donating money on behalf of someone else, although donations from minors are not illegal. Critics charged that the Apotex contributions may have been an attempt to sidestep Canada&#x27;s laws on corporate donations. NDP MP Pat Martin accused Volpe of deliberately orchestrating fraudulent donations and asked the Elections Commissioner to investigate whether &quot;individuals may be trying to circumvent campaign fundraising limits&quot;. After Volpe threatened a libel suit, Martin said that his initial accusation was an overstatement but maintained that his call for an investigation was justified. While other parties criticized the donations, Liberal national director Steven MacKinnon stated that the party would not launch an investigation, arguing that it was the responsibility of Elections Canada to regulate donations. The donations were parodied by a website called &quot;YouthForVolpe.ca&quot;.

Volpe responded by promising to return any donations that contravened the letter or spirit of the law. He returned the five cheques from minors after extensive media criticism, and denied that any laws had been broken. The controversy nonetheless damaged his candidacy. Sukh Dhaliwal withdrew his support from Volpe after the controversy broke, saying &quot;I think this thing should not happen in any campaign&quot;. Other Liberals requested that Volpe withdraw from the contest due to negative publicity, but he said that this was not an option he was considering. In July 2006, Volpe argued that the Federal Accountability Act should be amended to prevent persons under eighteen from contributing to political campaigns.

On December 5, 2006, Elections Canada stated that Volpe had not violated election financing law in accepting the contributions.

====Other controversies====

Jim Karygiannis, who had been Volpe&#x27;s campaign chair, left the campaign on 21 July 2006 after disagreements over Volpe&#x27;s staunch pro-Israel stance in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. Soon after his abrupt departure, Karygiannis called the police to prevent a Volpe official from removing computers at the campaign&#x27;s Scarborough headquarters, which had been leased in Karygiannis&#x27;s name. No charges were filed. There was speculation that Karygiannis&#x27;s recruits were more loyal to him than to Volpe, and that his departure would create serious difficulties for Volpe&#x27;s candidacy.

On October 15, 2006, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that the Career Foundation, a federally funded charity serving the unemployed, had paid seven of its clients to work on Volpe&#x27;s leadership campaign. The Foundation is headquartered in Volpe&#x27;s Eglinton—Lawrence riding and fell under his purview during his tenure as Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development. The &quot;Star&quot; article indicated that three Foundation managers objected to paying workers in a partisan political campaign, on the grounds that it was an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds and incompatible with the foundation&#x27;s charitable status. The Foundation&#x27;s executive director, Colin Morrison, was quoted as saying that the assignment of clients served a &quot;higher purpose&quot; of &quot;help[ing] unemployed people.&quot; Volpe described the &quot;Star&quot;&#x27;s report as &quot;a total fiction&quot;, and the latest in a series of attempts to derail his campaign.

====Fine, appeal and exoneration====

On September 23, 2006, the Liberal Party investigated Volpe&#x27;s campaign on suspicion of questionable recruitment tactics in Quebec. Volpe had signed up 4,000 new members in the province, more than any other candidate. Several new party members in Montreal were reported as having been improperly registered, and at least nine members were signed up by the Volpe camp without their knowledge or without paying the $10 fee. In two of the cases, the signed-up members were deceased. There was speculation that Volpe would withdraw from the contest after these allegations but he declined to do so, saying that his campaign was not aware of any wrongdoing. Some of Volpe&#x27;s supporters suggested that Michael Ignatieff&#x27;s team was running a smear campaign against him. Volpe also argued that his ethnicity may have been a factor in the accusations, suggesting that they came from those who believed he was &quot;not Canadian enough&quot;. A similar sentiment was echoed by former Public Works minister Alfonso Gagliano, banned from the party for being implicated in the Sponsorship scandal, who urged Volpe to stay in the race and fight the allegations. Some prominent Liberals, including Scott Reid, were strongly critical of Volpe&#x27;s response.

The Liberal Party imposed a $20,000 fine on Volpe&#x27;s campaign in late September, having determined that it provided membership forms to cultural groups without ensuring that new members paid their own fees. Importantly, the panel found no that evidence Volpe or his senior officials knew about the problems. Volpe appealed the decision, arguing the fine was imposed &quot;without due process&quot; and was &quot;designed to inflict as much damage as possible on my campaign immediately prior to the delegate selection meetings.&quot;

On October 31, a Liberal Party appeals committee exonerated Volpe of improper membership sales, and withdrew the fine imposed the previous month. He was found guilty of a minor breach of the leadership candidates&#x27; code of conduct, and given a nominal fine of $1,000. Volpe accepted the ruling as vindication, and repeated his charge that the previous ruling had a prejudicial effect on delegate selection. He told reporters, &quot;I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m ecstatic because the damage has already been done&quot;. Volpe&#x27;s reputation in the Liberal Party, damaged by earlier controversies, recovered to some extent after the appeal.

====Results====

Volpe fared poorly in the delegate selection meetings, and knew going into the convention that he could not win the leadership. He threw his support behind former Ontario Premier Bob Rae during the convention&#x27;s &quot;speech night&quot;, only moments after the final speech from Michael Ignatieff. This decision did not affect the first ballot of voting, which took place as the speeches were being delivered. Volpe received 156 votes from the convention delegates, finishing in seventh place.

Rae released his delegates after being eliminated on the third ballot. Volpe moved to the camp of Stéphane Dion, who defeated Michael Ignatieff on the fourth ballot to win the party leadership. Volpe and four other MPs who contested the Liberal leadership were named to the frontbench of the Official Opposition in parliament.

==Post politics==

Since his election defeat Volpe became publisher of Corriere Canadese, an Italian-Canadian daily newspaper based in Toronto revived by Volpe and several other investors in 2013.

Volpe published an article in Corriere Canadese on January 8, 2021 questioning the decision of the Toronto Catholic District School Board to list YouthLine, an LGBTQ mental health resource, on its website, but YouthLine called his comments &quot;homophobic, transphobic and anti-LGBTQ&quot;. In April 2021, Volpe filed a 30-million dollar defamation suit against Kristyn Wong-Tam and Paul Ainslie, as well as four Toronto Catholic District School Board Trustees and Yahoo Canada. In May 2022, Volpe&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice after the defendants requested dismissal under the anti-SLAPP provisions of Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Courts of Justice Act.&quot;

<text>Cremorne railway station was an inner suburban station in Melbourne, Australia. It was on the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company’s line from Princes Bridge station to Windsor station, and was located just north of Balmain Street on the Melbourne side of the Yarra River bridge, in a part of the suburb of Richmond which is now known as Cremorne.

==History==
The line was opened as far as Cremorne station in December 1859. One of the station&#x27;s main functions was to encourage visitors to Melbourne&#x27;s Cremorne Gardens. George Coppin, who was the proprietor of the attraction, lobbied the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company, and then entered a financial arrangement with it, to expedite the building of the quarter-mile, four-minute extension from Richmond railway station. Often the price of admission to the gardens included free return rail ticket from the city to Cremorne station. 

The station consisted of a wooden platform located at the entrance to the Gardens.

Trains continued to stop at the station after the railway bridge over the Yarra from Cremorne to South Yarra was completed a year later.

The Cremorne Gardens closed in early 1863, and the last known train to stop at Cremorne station was on 23 November 1863, the day of the auction to dispose of the goods that remained in the Gardens. In 1890, Richmond residents lobbied the Victorian Railways Commissioners to reopen the station, but their request was refused as the station was deemed &quot;unnecessary&quot;. There are no remains of the station and subsequent track expansion now covers the area where it once stood.

Residents and local councils continued to lobby for the station to reopen many decades after it closed.

<text>Saltwater River railway station was the first station at Flemington Racecourse, Melbourne. It opened on 1 October 1859, as a small station. However, over time it was expanded to include a double platform. The Saltwater River was a name early settlers gave the Maribyrnong River.

On race days, trains ran every few minutes, and it is estimated that the station carried over 12,000 passengers. According to records, it remained in regular service until approximately 1867. However, it is unclear what happened to the station in the period between the opening of Flemington Racecourse station opened in 1861, and its temporary closure several years later. The station remained in use in the mid-to-late 1860s, and itself closed when Flemington Racecourse station was reopened in 1867.</text><links>

<text>Andrew Mitchell, (born April 21, 1953) is a Canadian politician. He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2006, representing Parry Sound-Muskoka as a member of the Liberal Party. He was a minister in the government of Jean Chrétien and a cabinet minister in the government of Paul Martin.

==Early life and career==

Mitchell was born in Montreal, Quebec, and has a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Carleton University (1972). Before running for public office, he worked for the Bank of Nova Scotia in Ottawa, Toronto, Cornwall, Elliot Lake, and Gravenhurst. He was also active with several local Chamber of Commerce organizations. Mitchell joined the Liberal Party in 1991.

==Parliamentarian==

===Government backbencher===
Mitchell was first elected in the 1993 federal election, winning a seat that had been held by the Progressive Conservatives since 1957. At the time, he did not have a strong public profile outside of his riding. The Liberals won a majority government, and Mitchell entered parliament as a backbench supporter of Jean Chrétien&#x27;s government.

He chaired a parliamentary task force that examined banking and small business policy in 1994. Its recommendations included a code of conduct for banks regarding small business loans, an ombudsman to oversee this code of conduct, and a provision allowing entrepreneurs to borrow up to twenty per cent from their registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs). The proposed code of conduct was intended to facilitate more bank loans to small businesses.

In 1996, Mitchell was appointed to another task force that examined the role of the federal government in relation to Canada&#x27;s disability community. It recommended that the government cancel its plans to wind down assistance programs for disabled people and instead introduce new programs and tax credits. Mitchell argued this investment was necessary to ensure disabled Canadians could enjoy the full rights of citizenship.

In the same period, he chaired a standing committee on natural resources with a focus on economic development in rural Canada. He supported construction of Fenbrook Institution, a medium security prison in Gravenhurst, as a benefit to the local economy.

===Minister===
;Secretary of State for Parks
Mitchell was re-elected in the 1997 federal election against a strong challenge from former general Lewis MacKenzie, who was running for the Progressive Conservative Party. The Liberals were re-elected with a second majority government nationally, and Mitchell was appointed as secretary of state for parks in Chrétien&#x27;s government. This was a ministerial position but not a full cabinet portfolio.

Shortly after his appointment, Mitchell announced that Canada&#x27;s national parks would not be privatized or commercialized apart from a small number of projects that had already been approved in the previous parliament. He following year, he introduced legislation to create a permanent agency for Parks Canada. The oversight of national parks had previously shifted among various ministries, and Mitchell argued that the new agency would allow for more and better-managed parks.

In April 1998, Mitchell said the Canadian government would block a salvage company&#x27;s plans to dynamite the wreckage of the Empress of Ireland ocean liner to recover an estimated one million dollars&#x27; worth of nickel ingots. Over one thousand people were killed when ship sank in the Saint Lawrence River in 1914, and Mitchell argued the detonation would violate Canada&#x27;s laws against interference with human remains. Many of the deceased were members of the Salvation Army, which strongly opposed the detonation plans.

Mitchell joined with environmental groups in late 1998 to oppose a bid by the government of the Northwest Territories, the Inuvialuit, and the Toronto-based company Falconbridge Ltd. to change a proposed boundary of the Tuktut Nogait National Park and permit nickel mining in the disputed area. Mitchell argued that the change would endanger the local caribou population and noted that eighty per cent of the nickel find was already located outside of the park&#x27;s boundaries. A committee of the Senate of Canada decided against moving the boundary in December 1998. The following year, Mitchell introduced legislation to restrict future development in all national parks and announced the creation of an aboriginal affairs secretariat to assist Parks Canada in matters relating to First Nations communities.

Mitchell supported a private member&#x27;s bill introduced by Liberal backbencher Albina Guarnieri in 1998 to reduce parole opportunities for criminals convicted of multiple murders.
;Secretary of State for Rural Development
In October 1999, Mitchell was reassigned as secretary of state for rural development and secretary of state for the federal economic development initiative for Northern Ontario (FedNor). In early 2000, he hosted Canada&#x27;s first national rural conference in Magog, Quebec. He also introduced thirty-seven million dollars for small and medium-sized businesses in Ontario and new money for advanced grain identification technology in Manitoba.

Re-elected in the 2000 federal election, Mitchell helped formulate a federal loan to prevent bankruptcy at Algoma Steel in 2001. He later announced the creation of a sixteen-member advisory committee on rural issues at the second national rural conference in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island.

In May 2002, Mitchell led a trade delegation to Atlanta, Georgia, to promote trade with Northern Ontario. Later in the same year, he promoted increased high-speed internet service for rural Canada and announced a fifteen million dollar plan to support co-operatives. In August 2003, he joined with Chrétien and Industry Minister Allan Rock to unveil Canada&#x27;s Municipal Rural Infrastructure Fund, valued at one billion dollars.
;Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development
Mitchell supported Paul Martin&#x27;s bid to succeed Jean Chrétien as Liberal Party leader in 2003. When Martin replaced Chrétien as prime minister, he promoted Mitchell to a full cabinet position as Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Mitchell introduced new self-government legislation for Canadian indigenous communities in January 2004 and said that he would not re-introduce his predecessor&#x27;s First Nations Governance Act, which had met with significant opposition from indigenous leaders.

Mitchell attended the Martin government&#x27;s one-day summit with leaders of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Métis National Council, the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, and the Native Women&#x27;s Association of Canada in April 2004. He indicated that he was willing to fund a housing secretariat that would be operated by the AFN.

In early 2004, Mitchell recognized embattled grand chief James Gabriel and the elected band council as the legitimate authority in Kanesatake, Quebec. The Kanesatake community was divided into rival factions, and Gabriel was forced to leave the community for his safety after his house was burned down.
;Minister of Agriculture
Mitchell was re-elected by a narrower margin in the 2004 federal election, as the Liberals were reduced to a minority government nationally. Following the election, he was reassigned as the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food. He was also appointed as minister of state for the federal economic development initiative for Northern Ontario in June 2005, after Joe Comuzzi&#x27;s resignation.

When Mitchell became agriculture minister, the American border was closed to Canadian cattle due to a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) found in a single Canadian cow in 2003. Mitchell&#x27;s initial efforts to lift the ban were unsuccessful, and he announced $488 million to aid the ailing sector in September 2004. When other instances of BSE were discovered in early 2005, Mitchell said that a &quot;low level and a declining level&quot; of the disease in older cattle was not surprising, that changes introduced in 1997 would ensure the safety of Canadian beef, and that an organized cull of older animals would be too extreme a reaction.

Mitchell announced one billion dollars in aid farm aid in March 2005, primarily in response to the border closure but also to grain harvests affected by frost, drought in the Prairies, and trade difficulties associated with the higher Canadian dollar relative to the American dollar. The border eventually reopened in July 2005. Mitchell subsequently established a beef and cattle advisory group to assist the government on export policy.

Mitchell withdrew the government&#x27;s support for a conference promoting agricultural exports to Iran in April 2005, following revelations that Canadian journalist Zahra Kazemi had died from torture in an Iranian prison two years earlier.

In early 2005, the National Farmers Union (NFU) charged that proposed federal legislation would make it difficult for independent farmers to retain seeds from one year to the next and that the government was abandoning its commitment to public plant breeding by closing four experimental research farms. The NFU further argued that these changes would benefit large companies like Monsanto over Canadian farmers. A representative for Mitchell responded that the government would protect the right of farmers to save their seeds. In response to further criticism, Mitchell announced a moratorium on the farm closures in June 2005.

Mitchell spent part of the 2006 federal election participating in previously scheduled World Trade Organization talks in Hong Kong on agricultural subsidies. After extended negotiations, Mitchell and International Trade Minister Jim Peterson announced their support for a tentative deal that would end farm export subsidies while allowing the Canadian Wheat Board&#x27;s operations to continue.

Mitchell lost to high-profile Conservative candidate Tony Clement by only twenty-eight votes in the 2006 election, as the Conservatives won a minority government nationally.

==After career==
Mitchell served as chief of staff for official opposition leader Bill Graham in 2006. He later became executive director and chair of the Greater Peterborough Economic Development Corporation (GPAEDC), led a non-profit organization called the Greater Peterborough Innovation Cluster, and became an adjunct professor at Trent University.

Mitchell was elected as deputy reeve of Selwyn in the 2010 municipal elections. By virtue of holding this position, he also served on the Peterborough County Council. Mitchell also served as a Senior Policy Advisor to the Hon. Jeff Leal, MPP and Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. He served until 2014.

Mitchell also served as campaign manager to the Maryam Monsef campaign in 2015 federal election in which Monsef won. He also worked as a professor at Trent University in the Political Studies department following his leaving federal politics.

On October 22, 2018 he won election to become mayor of Selwyn, Ontario

<doc id="638224" wikidata="Q5089293" url="?curid=638224" title="Cheeky Weekly">
<text>Cheeky Weekly was a British comic book magazine published every Monday by IPC Magazines Ltd. It ran for 117 issues from (issues dates) 22 October 1977 to 2 February 1980, failing to be published for 3 weeks in December 1978 due to an industrial dispute. It merged with stable-mate &quot;Whoopee!&quot;, initially as a 16-page pull-out section. The title character originated in an earlier comic called &quot;Krazy&quot; as a character in the strip The Krazy Gang and also the star of the &#x27;Ello, It&#x27;s Cheeky feature, and proved popular enough to get his own comic, which managed to outlive &quot;Krazy&quot; itself. The first issue came with a free &quot;Red Jet Rattler&quot; (a build-it-yourself model aeroplane). Its characters and strips included:

* &quot;Cheeky&#x27;s Week&quot;, a comic strip featuring the title character meeting various regular characters with much joke-telling. This strip was drawn by Frank McDiarmid.
* &quot;Lily Pop&quot;
* &quot;Posh Claude&quot;
* &quot;Walter Wurx&quot;
* &quot;Jogging Jeremy&quot;
* &quot;Baby Burpo&quot;
* &quot;Baker&#x27;s Boy&quot;
* &quot;Sid the Street Sweeper&quot;
* &quot;Ursula the Usherette&quot;

==Other Cheeky comic strips==
* &quot;Mustapha Million&quot; comic strip
* &quot;Six Million Dollar Gran&quot; comic strip - This was a parody of The Six Million Dollar Man.
* &quot;Skateboard Squad&quot; comic strip, later renamed &quot;Speed Squad&quot;
* &quot;Tub&quot; - Tub was one of the characters from Cheeky&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Comic&quot;.
* &quot;Disaster Des&quot; comic strip - Des&#x27;s comic strip began in Cheeky issue dated 30 September 1978 and continued until the last issue.
* &quot;Elephant On The Run&quot; - another of the characters from Cheeky&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Comic&quot;
* &quot;Calculator Kid&quot;
* &quot;Paddywack&quot;
* &quot;Stage School&quot;
* &quot;Snail of the Century&quot;

For many of the later issues of Cheeky his unnamed pet snail had the back page and met other garden creatures to exchange jokes.

The lead character Cheeky was portrayed in a red and black striped sweater with a large C on the chest. At one point the comic gave away a free knitting pattern so readers could knit their own (or get their mums to knit one for them).

One unusual aspect of &quot;Cheeky Weekly&quot; compared to its contemporaries was that the title character appeared in more than one strip. A typical issue would follow &quot;Cheeky&quot; through the week from Sunday through to the following Saturday in a series of one- or two-page strips. Often not so much a narrative as a series of random gags each episode was designed to lead into the ‘support’ strip which followed.

Some notable examples include: 
* Cheeky racing home to watch his favourite TV Show, usually arriving with seconds to spare.
* Cheeky trying to read the latest &quot;James Bold&quot; book in the bookshop – this would lead into a two-page ‘drama’ strip which would then end abruptly as the bookshop owner chased Cheeky from the store.

On Wednesdays, Cheeky babysat for Baby Burpo, a mischievous child similar to &quot;Whoopee!&quot;’s &quot;Sweeny Toddler&quot;. Cheeky would read him a tongue-in-cheek ghost story in the hope of scaring the kid but this invariably backfired and Cheeky would end up running home in terror as if pursued by whatever menace had featured in that week&#x27;s story.

Initially on Saturdays, Cheeky attended a Saturday morning picture show at his local cinema where he saw a cartoon (often represented by a strip featuring Warner Brothers cartoon characters) followed by a drama serial, while exchanging jokes with his friends in the interval. After just over a year the cinema feature was dropped and subsequent issues showed Cheeky pursuing a variety of weekend activities instead.

&quot;Cheeky Chit-Chat&quot; was the readers&#x27; letter pages. Any reader who had their letter printed received £2 and a &quot;Friend of Cheeky&quot; badge.

The &quot;Joke-Box Jury&quot; page gave the readers a chance to send in jokes, with a prize of £2 if their joke was published.

==&quot;Whoopee!&quot; comic merger==
For the first &quot;Whoopee!&quot; merged issue, &quot;Cheeky&quot; had the middle 16 pages (half the comic). Cheeky himself had 4 pages. &quot;Six Million Dollar Gran&quot;, renamed &quot;Robot Granny&quot; had 2 pages. &quot;Calculator Kid&quot; had 1 page. &quot;Stage School&quot; also had 2 pages. &quot;Paddywack&quot; had half a page. The letters page was renamed &quot;Whoopee Chit-Chat&quot; and usually occupied one and a half pages (the prize was £2 plus a Whoopee! logo&#x27;d T-shirt. &quot;Mustapha Million&quot; had 2 pages, though in 1981 many of these were reprints. On the 16 February 1980 issue a brand new single page comic strip &quot;Chip&quot; began. The other pages had advertising.

The last issue of &quot;Whoopee!&quot; to feature the &quot;Cheeky&quot; logo on the cover was dated 25 July 1981. The &quot;Whoopee!&quot; dated 5 September 1981 was the last to feature a 4-page &quot;Cheeky&quot; story and hereafter the Cheeky&#x27;s comic strips were distributed throughout the comic (rather than the 16 central pages).

<doc id="638229" wikidata="Q366580" url="?curid=638229" title="Technical support">
<text>Technical support, commonly shortened as tech support, is a customer service provided to customers to resolve issues, commonly with consumer electronics. This is commonly provided via call centers, online chat and email. Many companies provide discussion boards for users to provide support to other users, decreasing load and cost on these companies.

==Outsourcing tech support==
With the increasing use of technology in modern times, there is a growing requirement to provide technical support. Many organizations locate their technical support departments or call centers in countries or regions with lower costs. Dell was amongst the first companies to outsource their technical support and customer service departments to India in 2001. There has also been a growth in companies specializing in providing technical support to other organizations. These are often referred to as MSPs (Managed Service Providers).

For businesses needing to provide technical support, outsourcing allows them to maintain high availability of service. Such need may result from peaks in call volumes during the day, periods of high activity due to the introduction of new products or maintenance service packs, or the requirement to provide customers with a high level of service at a low cost to the business. For businesses needing technical support assets, outsourcing enables their core employees to focus more on their work in order to maintain productivity. It also enables them to utilize specialized personnel whose technical knowledge base and experience may exceed the scope of the business, thus providing a higher level of technical support to their employees.

==Multi-level tech support== 
Technical support is often subdivided into tiers, or levels, in order to better serve a business or customer base. The number of levels a business uses to organize their technical support group is dependent on the business&#x27;s needs regarding their ability to sufficiently serve their customers or users. The reason for providing a multi-tiered support system instead of one general support group is to provide the best possible service in the most efficient possible manner. Success of the organizational structure is dependent on the technicians&#x27; understanding of their level of responsibility and commitments, their customer response time commitments, and when to appropriately escalate an issue and to which level. A common support structure revolves around a three-tiered technical support system. Remote computer repair is a method for troubleshooting software related problems via remote desktop connections. 

===L1 Support===
Tier I (or Level 1, abbreviated as T1 or L1) is the first technical support level. The first job of a Tier I specialist is to gather the customer&#x27;s information and to determine the customer&#x27;s issue by analyzing the symptoms and figuring out the underlying problem. When analyzing the symptoms, it is important for the technician to identify what the customer is trying to accomplish so that time is not wasted on &quot;attempting to solve a symptom instead of a problem.&quot;

Once identification of the underlying problem is established, the specialist can begin sorting through the possible solutions available. Technical support specialists in this group typically handle straightforward and simple problems while &quot;possibly using some kind of knowledge management tool.&quot; This includes troubleshooting methods such as verifying physical layer issues, resolving username and password problems, uninstalling/reinstalling basic software applications, verification of proper hardware and software set up, and assistance with navigating around application menus. Personnel at this level have a basic to general understanding of the product or service and may not always contain the competency required for solving complex issues. Nevertheless, the goal for this group is to handle 70–80% of the user problems before finding it necessary to escalate the issue to a higher level.

===L2 Support===
Tier II (or Level 2, abbreviated as T2 or L2) is a more in-depth technical support level than Tier I and therefore costs more as the technicians are more experienced and knowledgeable on a particular product or service. It is synonymous with level 2 support, support line 2, administrative level support, and various other headings denoting advanced technical troubleshooting and analysis methods. Technicians in this realm of knowledge are responsible for assisting Tier I personnel in solving basic technical problems and for investigating elevated issues by confirming the validity of the problem and seeking for known solutions related to these more complex issues. However, prior to the troubleshooting process, it is important that the technician review the work order to see what has already been accomplished by the Tier I technician and how long the technician has been working with the particular customer. This is a key element in meeting both the customer and business needs as it allows the technician to prioritize the troubleshooting process and properly manage their time.

If a problem is new and/or personnel from this group cannot determine a solution, they are responsible for elevating this issue to the Tier III technical support group. In addition, many companies may specify that certain troubleshooting solutions be performed by this group to help ensure the intricacies of a challenging issue are solved by providing experienced and knowledgeable technicians. This may include, but is not limited to, onsite installations or replacement of various hardware components, software repair, diagnostic testing, or the utilization of remote control tools to take over the user&#x27;s machine for the sole purpose of troubleshooting and finding a solution to the problem.

===L3 Support===
Tier III (or Level 3, abbreviated as T3 or L3) is the highest level of support in a three-tiered technical support model responsible for handling the most difficult or advanced problems. It is synonymous with level 3 support, 3rd line support, back-end support, support line 3, high-end support, and various other headings denoting expert level troubleshooting and analysis methods. These individuals are experts in their fields and are responsible for not only assisting both Tier I and Tier II personnel, but with the research and development of solutions to new or unknown issues. Note that Tier III technicians have the same responsibility as Tier II technicians in reviewing the work order and assessing the time already spent with the customer so that the work is prioritized and time management is sufficiently utilized. If it is at all possible, the technician will work to solve the problem with the customer as it may become apparent that the Tier I and/or Tier II technicians simply failed to discover the proper solution. Upon encountering new problems, however, Tier III personnel must first determine whether or not to solve the problem and may require the customer&#x27;s contact information so that the technician can have adequate time to troubleshoot the issue and find a solution. It is typical for a developer or someone who knows the code or backend of the product, to be the Tier 3 support person.

In some instances, an issue may be so problematic to the point where the product cannot be salvaged and must be replaced. Such extreme problems are also sent to the original developers for in-depth analysis. If it is determined that a problem can be solved, this group is responsible for designing and developing one or more courses of action, evaluating each of these courses in a test case environment, and implementing the best solution to the problem.

===L4 Support===
While not universally used, a fourth level often represents an escalation point beyond the organization. L4 support is generally a hardware or software vendor.

==Scams==
A common scam typically involves a cold caller claiming to be from a technical support department of a company like Microsoft. Such cold calls are often made from call centers based in India to users in English-speaking countries, although increasingly these scams operate within the same country. The scammer will instruct the user to download a remote desktop program and once connected, use social engineering techniques that typically involve Windows components to persuade the victim that they need to pay in order for the computer to be fixed and then proceeds to steal money from the victim&#x27;s credit card.

<doc id="638234" wikidata="Q1427059" url="?curid=638234" title="Impedance bridging">
<text>In audio engineering and sound recording, a high impedance bridging, voltage bridging, or simply bridging connection is one in which the load impedance is much larger than the source impedance. The load measures the source&#x27;s voltage while minimally drawing current or affecting it. 

== Explanation ==

When the output of a device (consisting of the voltage source &quot;V&quot;S and output impedance &quot;Z&quot;S in illustration) is connected to the input of another device (the load impedance &quot;Z&quot;L in the illustration), these two impedances form a voltage divider:
:formula_1

One can maximize the signal level &quot;V&quot;L by using a voltage source whose output impedance &quot;Z&quot;S is as small as possible and by using a receiving device whose input impedance &quot;Z&quot;L is as large as possible. When formula_2 (typically by at least ten times), this is called a &quot;bridging connection&quot; and has a number of effects including: 
* Advantages:
** Reduces the 6dB attenuation incurred by impedance matching, which helps by reducing the amount of make-up amplification required and by maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio. However a transformer can be used instead to match impedance and provide better signal-to-noise. And the 6dB attenuation can be easily be made up in the amplifier.
** Facilitates connecting multiple loads to the same source.
** Reduces current drawn from the source device, which helps avoid wasting power and helps reduce distortion. Less current through the wire also reduces resistive loss.
* Disadvantages:
** Increasing &quot;Z&quot;L possibly increases environmental noise pickup since the combined parallel impedance of &quot;Z&quot;S || &quot;Z&quot;L (dominated by &quot;Z&quot;S) increases slightly, which makes it easier for stray noise to drive the signal node.
** Signal reflection from the impedance change. However for audio frequencies, a quarter wavelength at 20 kHz is approximately 2500 meters, so audio circuits in studios never become true transmission lines.

== Applications ==

=== Limit attenuation of voltage signal ===
Impedance bridging is typically used to avoid unnecessary voltage attenuation and current draw in line or mic level connections where the source device has an unchangeable output impedance &quot;Z&quot;S. Fortunately, the input impedance &quot;Z&quot;L of modern op-amp circuits (and many old vacuum tube circuits) is often naturally much higher than the output impedance of these signal sources and thus are naturally-suited for impedance bridging when receiving and amplifying these voltage signals. The inherently lower output impedance of modern circuit designs facilitate impedance bridging.

For devices with very high output impedances, such as with a guitar pickup or a high-Z mic, a DI box can help with impedance bridging by converting the high output impedances to a lower impedance so as to not require the receiving device to have outrageously high input impedance (which would suffer drawbacks such as increased noise in long cable runs). The DI box is placed close to the source device, so any long cables can be attached to the output of the DI box (which usually also converts unbalanced signals to balanced signals to further increase noise immunity). 

=== Increase electrical efficiency ===

As explained in , the efficiency of delivering power to a purely restive load impedance of from a voltage source with a purely restive output impedance of is:formula_3This &quot;efficiency&quot; can be increased using impedance bridging, by decreasing and/or by increasing .

However, to instead &quot;transfer&quot; the maximum power from the source to the load, impedance matching should be used, according to the maximum power transfer theorem.

<doc id="638237" wikidata="Q812056" url="?curid=638237" title="Bay-class landing ship">
<text>The Bay class is a ship class of four dock landing ships built for the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) during the 2000s. They are based on the Dutch-Spanish Royal Schelde Enforcer design, and replaced the logistics ships. Two ships each were ordered from Swan Hunter and BAE Systems Naval Ships. Construction work started in 2002, but saw major delays and cost overruns, particularly at Swan Hunter&#x27;s shipyard. In mid-2006, Swan Hunter was stripped of work, and the incomplete second ship was towed to BAE&#x27;s shipyard for completion. All four ships, , , , and had entered service by 2007.

Since entering service, the Bay-class ships have been used for amphibious operations, training of the Iraqi Navy in the Persian Gulf, counter-drug deployments in the Caribbean, and relief operations following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In 2010, &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was removed from service as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review. She was sold to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in 2011, who operate her as .

Since 2020, the RFA has used the ships for littoral warfare as part of Littoral Response Groups. The ships are expected to serve with the RFA into the 2030s, after which they are expected to be replaced by new Multi-Role Support Ships.

==Development==
The Bay class was designed as a replacement for the five logistics ships operated by the RFA. Planning for the class began in the 1990s, after the original intent to modernise and extend the service life of three Round Tables ran into problems with extensive corrosion and problems implementing new safety standards. After the first Round Table returned to service two years late and after excessive cost, the Ministry of Defence began to investigate the acquisition of new ships.

In April 2000, the MoD released an Invitation to Tender for two ships under a budget of £150 million, with the option to acquire three more. Appledore Shipbuilders, BAE Systems Naval Ships and Swan Hunter submitted tenders, but only Swan Hunter&#x27;s design met all the tender requirements, at a price of £148 million. A shortfall of work for BAE&#x27;s Govan yard led to fears that it could not deliver the Type 45 destroyers and s planned for later in the decade, so the Treasury agreed to fund an additional two LSDs to be built at Govan.

===Construction===
The contract for and was awarded to Swan Hunter on 18 December 2000 and the £122 million contract for and was awarded to BAE on 19 November 2001. Construction on &quot;Largs Bay&quot; started at Swan Hunter on 28 January 2002, and on &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; at BAE on 25 August 2002.

Swan Hunter struggled to manage the project and contain costs; only 7% of the design drawings were provided on time and more than 52% were over a year late. Swan Hunter&#x27;s owner, Jaap Kroese, has blamed the MoD for continually changing the specifications. The extent of the problems only came to light in September 2003, when Swan Hunter said they could not fulfill the contract at the agreed price. In November 2004, progress on &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was delayed by water entering two engines during engine trials, putting the planned first of class behind work on BAE&#x27;s first ship. The following month the government agreed to pay Swan Hunter an extra £84 million under new contract terms, but in June 2005 Swan Hunter said that they still could not finish the job within budget. This led to their contract being cancelled and BAE taking over the project in July 2006. In total Swan Hunter had been paid £342 million and BAE £254 million, making a total of £596 million for the four ships.
&quot;Mounts Bay&quot; entered service in July 2006, followed by &quot;Largs Bay&quot; in November of that year, 28 months later than originally planned. The incomplete &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; was towed to Govan for completion by BAE. &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; was dedicated on 26 November 2007; the last ship of the class to enter RFA service. The ship was the only warship built by Swan Hunter but not completed; she marked the end of shipbuilding on the Tyne, as soon afterwards Swan Hunter sold its equipment to India and reinvented itself as an engineering consultancy.

==Characteristics==
The Bay class is certified as a class 1 passenger ship, with design similarities to ro-pax ferries. The design is based on the Royal Schelde Enforcer, a joint project between the Dutch and Spanish resulting in the and amphibious warfare ships. The main difference is that the British ships have no helicopter hangar. The ships were originally designated Auxiliary Landing Ship Logistics (ALSL), but this was changed in 2002 to Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary) (LSD(A)), better reflecting their operational role and bringing them into line with the NATO designation for the Royal Schelde vessels.

The Bay-class ships have a full load displacement of . They are long, with a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion power is provided by two Wärtsilä 8L26 generators, providing , and two Wärtsilä 12V26 generators, providing . These are used to drive two steerable azimuthing thrusters, with a bow thruster supplementing. Maximum speed is , and the Bay-class ships can achieve a range of at . The ships were designed to receive an armament of two Phalanx CIWS, two manual 30 mm DS30B cannon and various small arms, but the exact weapons fit varies within the class.

In British service, the everyday ship&#x27;s company consisted of 60 to 70 RFA personnel, with this number supplemented by members of the British Armed Forces when the ships are deployed operationally. For example, &quot;Largs Bay&quot;″s deployment in response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake saw her sail with a core crew of 70, plus 40 Royal Logistic Corps personnel for boat- and cargo-handling duties, and 17 from the Royal Navy and Royal Marines for security and related tasks. Australia operates &quot;Choules&quot; with a permanent crew of 158 including a Ship&#x27;s Army Department of 22.

As a sealift ship, each Bay-class vessel is capable of carrying up to 24 Challenger 2 tanks or 150 light trucks in 1,150 linear metres of space, with stern- and side-ramp access to the vehicle deck. The cargo capacity is equivalent of 200 tons of ammunition, or 24 twenty-foot equivalent unit containers. During normal conditions, a Bay-class ship can carry 356 soldiers, but this can be almost doubled to 700 in overload conditions. The flight deck is capable of handling helicopters up to the size of Chinooks, as well as Merlin helicopters and Osprey tiltrotor aircraft. There is no hangar for long-term embarkation of a helicopter, although a temporary shelter can be fitted to house a Merlin or smaller helicopter. The well dock can carry one LCU Mark 10 or two LCVPs, and two Mexeflotes can be suspended from the ship&#x27;s flanks. Two 30-ton cranes are fitted between the superstructure and the flight deck. Internal passages are wide enough to allow two fully kitted marines to pass each other.

==Operational history==

In 2006 &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; took part in Operation Vela, a major amphibious exercise off West Africa.

In mid-April 2007, &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; sailed for &quot;Operation Orion 07&quot;, a four-month deployment to the Mediterranean. From 2008 until the end of 2010, &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; was used to accommodate and train personnel of the Iraqi Navy under the tutelage of Royal Navy and United States Navy personnel. During this time, the ship operated almost exclusively in the Persian Gulf.

In late November 2007, &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was deployed to the Caribbean for counter-drug operations. During the deployment, the ship visited ports across the Caribbean islands and the United States mainland, and intercepted a cocaine shipment. In late 2008, it was reported that &quot;Largs Bay&quot; was to replace the frigate for duties in the Falkland Islands. &quot;Northumberland&quot; was to have left for the Islands in December 2008, but was instead sent for an anti-pirate patrol off Somalia.

On 3 February 2010, &quot;Largs Bay&quot; headed to Haiti with aid supplies for relief efforts after the earthquake. On 18 February 2010, she arrived at Port-au-Prince and commenced unloading of the supplies. On 30 March 2010, she returned home.

In December 2010, it was announced that a Bay-class vessel, later identified as &quot;Largs Bay&quot;, would be decommissioned in April 2011 as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review. On 17 March 2011, the Australian Department of Defence announced that the RAN would be bidding for &quot;Largs Bay&quot;; this was followed on 6 April by news that a £65 million (A$100 million) bid had been successful. She was commissioned into the RAN on 13 December 2011 as , after receiving modifications for service in tropical conditions. A transformer in the propulsion system failed when she was en route to a training area on 14 June 2012, after earlier reports that the ship could not maintain top speed without transformers overheating. An insulation failure had short-circuited the failed transformer, while others aboard were showing signs of premature wear. With no spares available, the need to order from the manufacturer combined with the decision to replace all of the transformers aboard meant that &quot;Choules&quot; was kept out of service until April 2013.

In June 2011, &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; headed to Yemen to aid with the potential evacuation of British citizens affected by the ongoing unrest there.

<text>The Social Gospel is a social movement within Protestantism that aims to apply Christian ethics to social problems, especially issues of social justice such as economic inequality, poverty, alcoholism, crime, racial tensions, slums, unclean environment, child labor, lack of unionization, poor schools, and the dangers of war. It was most prominent in the early 20th-century United States and Canada. Theologically, proponents of the movement emphasized living out the line from the Lord&#x27;s Prayer (Matthew 6:10): &#x27;Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven,&#x27; interpreting it as a call to address societal injustices. They typically were postmillennialist and believed the Second Coming could not happen until humankind rid itself of social evils by human effort. The Social Gospel was more popular among clergy than churches. Its leaders were predominantly associated with the liberal wing of the progressive movement and most were theologically liberal, although a few were also conservative when it came to their views on social issues. Important leaders included Richard T. Ely, Josiah Strong, Washington Gladden, and Walter Rauschenbusch.

==History==
The term &quot;Social Gospel&quot; was first used by Charles Oliver Brown in reference to Henry George&#x27;s 1879 treatise &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, which sparked the &quot;single tax&quot; movement.

The Social Gospel affected much of Protestant America. The Presbyterians described their goals in 1910 by proclaiming:
The great ends of the church are the proclamation of the gospel for the salvation of humankind; the shelter, nurture, and spiritual fellowship of the children of God; the maintenance of divine worship; the preservation of truth; the promotion of social righteousness; and the exhibition of the Kingdom of Heaven to the world.

In the late 19th century, many Protestants were disgusted by the poverty level and the low quality of living in the slums. The social gospel movement provided a religious rationale for action to address those concerns. Activists in the Social Gospel movement hoped that, if by public measures as well as enforced schooling, the poor could develop talents and skills, causing the quality of their moral lives to improve. Important concerns of the Social Gospel movement were labor reforms such as abolishing child labor and regulating the hours of work by mothers. By 1920, they were crusading against the 12-hour day for workers at U.S. Steel.

===Washington Gladden===
Washington Gladden (1836–1918) was an American Congregational clergyman. His words and actions earned him the title of &quot;a pioneer&quot; of the Social Gospel even before the term came into use. Gladden spoke up for workers and their right to organize unions.

For Gladden, the &quot;Christian law covers every relation of life&quot; including the relationship between employers and their employees. His 1877 book &quot;The Christian Way: Whither It Leads and How to Go On&quot; was his first national call for such a universal application of Christian values in everyday life. The book began his leadership in the Social Gospel movement. Historians consider Gladden to be one of the Social Gospel movement&#x27;s &quot;founding fathers&quot;.

===Walter Rauschenbusch (1861–1918)===
Another of the defining theologians for the Social Gospel movement was Walter Rauschenbusch, a Baptist pastor of the Second German Baptist Church in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, New York City.

In 1892, Rauschenbusch and several other leading writers and advocates of the Social Gospel formed a group called the Brotherhood of the Kingdom. Pastors and leaders will join the organization to debate and implement the social gospel.

In 1907, he published the book &quot;Christianity and the Social Crisis&quot;, which would influence the actions of several actors of the social gospel. His work may be &quot;the finest distillation of social gospel thought.&quot; Rauschenbusch railed against what he regarded as the selfishness of capitalism and promoted instead a form of Christian socialism that supported the creation of labor unions and cooperative economics.

==== &quot;A Theology for the Social Gospel&quot; (1917) ====
The social gospel movement was not a unified and well-focused movement, for it contained members who disagreed with the conclusions of others within the movement. Rauschenbusch stated that the movement needed &quot;a theology to make it effective&quot; and likewise, &quot;theology needs the social gospel to vitalize it.&quot; In &quot;A Theology for the Social Gospel&quot; (1917), Rauschenbusch takes up the task of creating &quot;a systematic theology large enough to match [our social gospel] and vital enough to back it.&quot; He believed that the social gospel would be &quot;a permanent addition to our spiritual outlook and that its arrival constitutes a state in the development of the Christian religion&quot;, and thus a systematic tool for using it was necessary.

In &quot;A Theology for the Social Gospel&quot;, Rauschenbusch states that the individualistic gospel has made sinfulness of the individual clear, but it has not shed light on institutionalized sinfulness: &quot;It has not evoked faith in the will and power of God to redeem the permanent institutions of human society from their inherited guilt of oppression and extortion.&quot; This ideology would be inherited by liberation theologians and civil rights advocates and leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr.

The &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; is crucial to Rauschenbusch&#x27;s proposed theology of the social gospel. He states that the ideology and doctrine of &quot;the Kingdom of God,&quot; of which Jesus Christ reportedly &quot;always spoke&quot; has been gradually replaced by that of the Church. This was done at first by the early church out of what appeared to be necessity, but Rauschenbusch calls Christians to return to the doctrine of &quot;the Kingdom of God.&quot; Of course, such a replacement has cost theology and Christians at large a great deal: the way we view Jesus and the synoptic gospels, the ethical principles of Jesus, and worship rituals have all been affected by this replacement. In promoting a return to the doctrine of the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;, he clarified that the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;: is not subject to the pitfalls of the Church; it can test and correct the Church; is a prophetic, future-focused ideology and a revolutionary, social and political force that understands all creation to be sacred; and it can help save the problematic, sinful social order.

In this book, he explains that Christians must be like the Almighty who became man in Jesus Christ, who was with everyone equally and considered people as a subject of love and service.

===Settlement movement===

Many reformers inspired by the movement opened settlement houses, most notably Hull House in Chicago operated by Jane Addams. They helped the poor and immigrants improve their lives. Settlement houses offered services such as daycare, education, and health care to needy people in slum neighborhoods. The YMCA was created originally to help rural youth adjust to the city without losing their religious faith, but by the 1890s became a powerful instrument of the Social Gospel. Nearly all the denominations (including Catholics) engaged in foreign missions, which often had a social gospel component in terms especially of medical uplift. The Black denominations, especially the African Methodist Episcopal church (AME) and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion church (AMEZ), had active programs in support of the Social Gospel. Both evangelical (&quot;pietistic&quot;) and liturgical (&quot;high church&quot;) elements supported the Social Gospel, although only the pietists were active in promoting Prohibition.

===Progressives===
In the United States prior to the First World War, the Social Gospel was the religious wing of the progressive movement which had the aim of combating injustice, suffering and poverty in society. Denver, Colorado, was a center of Social Gospel activism. Thomas Uzzel led the Methodist People&#x27;s Tabernacle from 1885 to 1910. He established a free dispensary for medical emergencies, an employment bureau for job seekers, a summer camp for children, night schools for extended learning, and English language classes for immigrants. Myron Reed of the First Congregational Church became a spokesman, 1884 to 1894 for labor unions on issues such as worker&#x27;s compensation. His middle-class congregation encouraged Reed to move on when he became a socialist, and he organized a nondenominational church. The Baptist minister Jim Goodhart set up an employment bureau, and provided food and lodging for tramps and hobos at the mission he ran. He became city chaplain and director of public welfare of Denver in 1918. Besides these Protestants, Reform Jews and Catholics helped build Denver&#x27;s social welfare system in the early 20th century.

Mark A. Matthews (1867–1940) of Seattle&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church was a leading city reformer, who investigated red light districts and crime scenes, denouncing corrupt politicians, businessmen, and saloon keepers. With 10,000 members, his was the largest Presbyterian Church in the country, and he was selected the national moderator in 1912. He built a model church, with night schools, unemployment bureaus, kindergarten, an anti-tuberculosis clinic, and the nation&#x27;s first church-owned radio station. Matthews was the most influential clergymen in the Pacific Northwest, and one of the most active Social Gospelers in America.

The American South had its own version of the Social Gospel, focusing especially on Prohibition. Other reforms included protecting young wage-earning women from the sex trade, outlawing public swearing, boxing, dogfights and similar affronts to their moral sensibilities. The Methodist Episcopal Church, South, took on new responsibilities with the enlargement and professionalization of missionary women&#x27;s roles starting in 1886 with the Southern Methodist Woman&#x27;s Parsonage and Home Mission Society. By 1900, says historian Edward Ayers, the white Baptists, although they were the most conservative of all the denominations in the South, became steadily more concerned with social issues, taking stands on &quot;temperance, gambling, illegal corruption, public morality, orphans and the elderly.&quot;

===New Deal===
During the New Deal of the 1930s, Social Gospel themes could be seen in the work of Harry Hopkins, Will Alexander, and Mary McLeod Bethune, who added a new concern with African Americans. After 1940, the movement lessened, but it was invigorated in the 1950s by black leaders like Baptist minister Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement. After 1980, it weakened again as a major force inside mainstream churches; indeed, those churches were losing strength.

Examples of the Social Gospel&#x27;s continued influence can still be found in Jim Wallis&#x27;s Sojourners organization&#x27;s Call to Renewal and more local organizations like the Virginia Interfaith Center. Another modern example can be found in the work of John Steinbruck, senior pastor of Luther Place Memorial Church in Washington, DC, from 1970 to 1997, who was an articulate and passionate preacher of the Social Gospel and a leading voice locally and nationally for the homeless, Central American refugees, and victims of persecution and prejudice.

===Social Gospel and Labor Movements===
Because the Social Gospel was primarily concerned with the day-to-day life of laypeople, one of the ways in which it made its message heard was through labor movements. Particularly, the Social Gospel had a profound effect upon the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The AFL began a movement called Labor Forward, which was a pro-Christian group who &quot;preached unionization like a revival.&quot; In Philadelphia, this movement was counteracted by bringing revivalist Billy Sunday, himself firmly anti-union, who believed &quot;that the organized shops destroyed individual freedom.&quot;

===Legacy of the Social Gospel===
The Social Gospel movement peaked in the early 20th century, but scholars debate over when the movement began to decline, with some asserting that the destruction and trauma caused by the First World War left many disillusioned with the Social Gospel&#x27;s ideals while others argue that the war stimulated the Social Gospelers&#x27; reform efforts. Theories regarding the decline of the Social Gospel after the First World War often cite the rise of neo-orthodoxy as a contributing factor in the movement&#x27;s decline.

While the Social Gospel was short-lived historically, it had a lasting impact on the policies of most of the mainline denominations in the United States. Most began programs for social reform, which led to ecumenical cooperation in 1910 while in the formation of the Federal Council of Churches. Although this cooperation was about social issues that often led to charges of socialism. It is likely that the Social Gospel&#x27;s strong sense of leadership by the people led to women&#x27;s suffrage, and that the emphasis it placed on morality led to prohibition. Biographer Randall Woods argues that Social Gospel themes learned from childhood allowed Lyndon B. Johnson to transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice, as exemplified by the Great Society and his commitment to racial equality. The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach to a sort of Christian internationalism and nation building.

The Social Gospel Movement has been described as &quot;the most distinctive American contribution to world Christianity.&quot;

The Social Gospel, after 1945, influenced the formation of Christian democracy political ideology among Protestants and Catholics in Europe. Many of the Social Gospel&#x27;s ideas also reappeared in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. &quot;Social Gospel&quot; principles continue to inspire newer movements such as Christians Against Poverty.

Reinhold Niebuhr has argued that the 20th century history of Western democracies has not vindicated the optimistic view of human nature which the social gospelers shared with the Enlightenment. Labor historians argue that the movement had little influence on the labor movement, and attribute that failure to professional elitism and a lack of understanding of the collective nature of the movement. Labor did not reject social gospellers because they were unaware of them but, rather, because their tactics and ideas were considered inadequate.

Paul Lubienecki wrote that &quot;contrary to analysis of some historians the historical evidence demonstrated that the [Social Gospel] Movement failed in its campaign to be the leading voice of the worker and to convert the urban immigrant masses&quot;. Lubieniecki notes that social gospel appealed predominantly to the white American Protestant middle-class and ultimately related more with the middle class than with the working class. Social gospel ministers did not connect to the struggling ethnic urban poor, and social gospel congregations would often relocate their parish into well-off neighborhoods, abandoning poor districts. This resulted in the Catholic parishes being established in working class areas instead. Lubieniecki also argued that the social gospel movement limited its appeal because of anti-Catholicism and antisemitism - Rauschenbusch stated that social concerns could not be sufficiently addressed by non-Protestants, and regarded Catholicism as inherently anti-democratic and contrary to the American values of individual liberty. Likewise, some social gospel ministers believed that Jews and Catholics threatened the American social order.

== Canada ==
The Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, a political party that was later reformulated as the New Democratic Party, was founded on social gospel principles in the 1930s by J. S. Woodsworth, a Methodist minister, and Alberta MP William Irvine. Woodsworth wrote extensively about the social gospel from experiences gained while working with immigrant slum dwellers in Winnipeg from 1904 to 1913. His writings called for the Kingdom of God &quot;here and now&quot;. This political party took power in the province of Saskatchewan in 1944. This group, led by Tommy Douglas, a Baptist minister, introduced universal medicare, family allowance and old age pensions. This political party has since largely lost its religious basis, and became a secular social democratic party.
The Social Service Council (SSC) was the &quot;reforming arm of Protestantism in Canada&quot;, and promoted idea of the social gospel. Under the &quot;aggressive leadership of Charlotte Whitton&quot;, the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, opposed &quot;a widening of social security protection...&quot; and &quot;continued to impede the implementation of provincial mothers&#x27; pensions&quot;, instead pressing for the &quot;traditional private charity&quot; model. Charlotte Whitton argued that children should be removed from their homes &quot;instead of paying money to needy parents&quot; Charlotte Whitton, as Christie and Gauvreau point out, was also a member of the SSC, The SSC&#x27;s mandate included the &quot;intensive Christian conquest of Canada&quot;.

The Social Gospel was a significant influence in the formation of the People&#x27;s Church in Brandon, Manitoba, in 1919. Started by Methodist minister A. E. Smith, the People&#x27;s Church attempted to provide an alternative to the traditional church, which Smith viewed as unconcerned with social issues. In his autobiography &quot;All My Life&quot; Smith describes his last sermon before starting the People&#x27;s Church, saying &quot;The Church was afraid it might give offense to the rich and powerful.&quot; The People&#x27;s Church was successful for a time, with People&#x27;s Churches founded in Vancouver, Victoria, Edmonton, and Calgary. In Winnipeg, Methodist minister and Social Gospeler William Ivens started another workers church, the &quot;Labor Church,&quot; in 1918. Both Smith and Ivens tried to take leaves of absence from their Methodist ministries, which were initially granted. Upon a decision to bring all such special cases before the Methodist Stationing Committee, however, the decisions were rescinded.

== In literature ==
The Social Gospel theme is reflected in the novels &quot;In His Steps&quot; (1897) and &quot;The Reformer&quot; (1902) by the Congregational minister Charles Sheldon, who coined the motto &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; In his personal life, Sheldon was committed to Christian socialism and identified strongly with the Social Gospel movement. Walter Rauschenbusch, one of the leading early theologians of the Social Gospel in the United States, indicated that his theology had been inspired by Sheldon&#x27;s novels.

Members of the Brotherhood of the Kingdom produced many of the written works that defined the theology of the Social Gospel movement and gave it public prominence. These included Walter Rauschenbusch&#x27;s &quot;Christianity and the Social Crisis&quot; (1907) and &quot;Christianizing the Social Order&quot; (1912), as well as Samuel Zane Batten&#x27;s &quot;The New Citizenship&quot; (1898) and &quot;The Social Task of Christianity&quot; (1911).

==21st century==
In the United States, the Social Gospel is still influential in liberal Protestantism. Social Gospel elements can also be found in many service and relief agencies associated with Protestant denominations and the Catholic Church in the United States.

<doc id="638256" wikidata="Q3554385" url="?curid=638256" title="Blarenberghe">
<text>Van Blarenberghe was the name of a dynasty of painters, originally from French Flanders (Lille), but some of the most famous descendants also lived in Paris, France. They were all descendants from Joris van Blarenberghe (1612–1670).

The first two painters were Hendrick van Blarenberghe (1646–1712) and his son Jacques-Guillaume van Blarenberghe (1679–1742). Their style was still heavily influenced by the Flemish Baroque style. Jacques-Guillaume had two painting sons, Louis-Nicolas van Blarenberghe (15 July 1716 – 1 May 1794) and Henri Désiré van Blarenberghe (1734–1812).

Louis-Nicolas had a son who was also a painter and with whom he often collaborated: Henri-Joseph van Blarenberghe (24 November 1750 – 1 December 1826). Together with his father they stayed at the Palace of Versailles, where they worked as miniaturists for the high society of their day. They were especially famous for their paintings on snuff boxes. Louis-Nicolas also worked as official campaign painter of the French court, following the French army as a war reporter. Two of his daughters, Catherine-Henriette and Isabelle, were chamber maids to the children of the French kings. The works of Louis-Nicolas and Henri-Joseph were collected in profusion in the 19th century by the Rothschild family. There is a collection of their work on public display at Waddesdon Manor. An enormous collection of Blarenberghe art was sold in the Mentmore Towers sale of 1977.

Henri-Joseph painted, besides the miniatures, mainly panoramic paintings, often in gouache. The subjects were, as with his father, often military, and also included the French revolution. He was the drawing teacher of the French princes, and founder and first conservator of the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille.

<text>Higher education in Mauritius includes colleges, universities and other technical institutions. Public university education has been free to students since 2019. The sector is managed by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) which has the responsibility for allocating public funds, and fostering, planning and coordinating the development of post-secondary education and training. Formerly the Tertiary Education Commission, in 2020 it was reformed into the HEC and a separate Quality Assurance Authority (QAA) for auditing of qualifications.

==Universities==

===The University of Mauritius===
Starting as the College of Agriculture, the University of Mauritius, established in 1965, dominates the Tertiary Education Sector locally. Originally, it had three Schools, namely Agriculture, Administration and Industrial Technology.

==Other institutions==

===The Mauritius Institute of Education===
Founded in 1973, the MIE was charged with teacher education, research in education and curriculum development. The role of the MIE as a curriculum development centre has been phased so that it is now predominantly involved in training teachers and educational research. However, it continued to play a role in curriculum planning and development, and it was entrusted with the responsibility for Curriculum Development as from October 2010. It has since produced the National Curriculum Framework for the Pre-Primary(2008), Primary (2007) and Secondary (2009) sectors. In 2015, it spearheaded the curriculum development for the Nine Year Continuous Basic Education (NYCBE). Alongside, it produced the teaching and learning Syllabi and also wrote and published some 255 textbooks to cover the whole of the 9-year spectrum from Grades 1 to 9 between 2015 and 2020. In 2023, the MIE developed a new curriculum for Technical Education for Grades 10 and 11 comprising three main areas of learning, namely Engineering Technology, Health and Hospitality, Computer Technology and Innovation. It is also responsible for the development of the teaching and learning materials and teacher training for this new stream. The Publications are available on MIE&#x27;s website for consultation.

There are five schools at MIE: Applied Sciences, Education, Science and Mathematics, Arts and Humanities and a Centre for Open and Distance Learning.

It offers training to school teachers from pre-primary, primary and secondary schools, as well as managerial cadres in programme ranging from Certificate, Diploma, Post Graduate Certificate in Education and Post Graduate Diplomas. It offers B.Ed for both the Primary and Secondary Education. Masters programmes in Education, in collaboration with the University of Brighton, UK. It offers Doctoral programmes in association with the University of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa and the University of Brighton, UK. It is also associated with St Mary&#x27;s University, London and offers Joint Master&#x27;s and Doctoral programmes in Education, open to international students.

The MIE, through its Centre for Open &amp; Distance Learning, is involved in the Sankore Project for digitising curriculum materials for primary and secondary schools and the introduction of interactive whiteboard technology in schools.

===The Mahatma Gandhi Institute===
MGI was established in 1970 as a joint government of Mauritius and government of India venture for the promotion of education and culture, with emphasis on Indian culture and traditions. It runs, within the tertiary set-up, programmes in Indian Studies, Indological Studies, Performing Arts, Fine Arts, Chinese and Mauritian Studies.

MGI has three main schools operating at the tertiary level: the School of Indian Studies, the School of Music and Fine Arts, and the School of Mauritian and Area Studies. It also runs diploma and certificate level programmes, degree level programmes in Languages, Fine Arts and Performing Arts, in collaboration with the UoM. A secondary school and the Gandhian Basic School operate within the ambit of the MGI.

===The Mauritius College of the Air===
MCA was established in 1971 to promote education, arts and science and culture in Mauritius through mass media. When the MCA statute was re-enacted in 1985, distance education was maintained as a major strategy to meet these objectives. Merged with the Audio-Visual Centre of the Ministry of Education and Science in 1986, the MCA has until recently been catering mainly for the primary and secondary education sector through the production of educational programmes for broadcast on radio and television. The MCA has also been producing educational materials for non-formal or continuing education, for non-broadcast use. Since the beginning of 1995, it has been involved in dispensing tertiary level programmes in collaboration with overseas institutions through the distance mode.

The MCA is being reconfigured as the Open University of Mauritius.

===Rabindranath Tagore Institute===
Set up in December 2002, the Rabindranath Tagore Institute has a cultural vocation and operates under the aegis of the Mahatma Gandhi Institute. It is still in an early phase of development.

==The Polytechnics==
Two polytechnic institutions exist in the country. 
* The Swami Dayanand Institute of Management runs diploma level Programmes in Information Technology, Administration and Accounting; such diploma programmes were formerly provided by the UoM. 
* The Institut Supérieur de Téchnologie offers diploma level programmes (Brevét de Téchnicien Supérieur) in Electro-Technics, Mecatronics and Building Engineering. All the programmes are run on a full-time basis.

===Technical School Management Trust Fund===
The TSMTF was created in 1990 to manage the Polytechnics. It is administered by a Board. Industry Advisory Committees, composed of representatives of both the public and private sectors, are appointed in respect of the programmes. The committees function is to:
* establish programme objectives, curriculum content and delivery modes; 
* establish terminal standards and certification; 
* prescribe training equipment, hardware and software; 
* prescribe training facilities and environment; 
* advise on industrial training attachments; 
* review programme results and diploma holders’ employment performance; 
* monitor and review market demand; 
* review and upgrade programmes.

===Mauritius Institute of Training and Development (Ex:IVTB)===
The IVTB was set up in 1988 to promote vocational education and training with the purposes of supplying workforce for the industrial, services and domestic sectors. Most of the programmes are vocational nature leading to the National Trade Certification (levels 3 and 2). As from 1998 the IVTB began tertiary level programmes at the levels of certificate and diploma in areas including Hotel Management, Automation and Information Technology.

Since 2004, the IVTB has introduced the National Trade Certificate Foundation Course for students who have completed their Prevocational Education Level 3. The course teaches Craftsmanship.

The IVTB has also introduced other courses such as IC3 for students of National Trade Certificate Level 2 and 3.

===The Mauritius Institute of Health===
The MIH was set up in 1989 to cater for the training needs of health professionals, local and regional. It organizes courses and programmes, mostly of short duration for medical and para-medical personnel.

===Private institutions/distance education===
Private institutions and organisations, which amount to more than 35, are offering programmes in Management, Accountancy and Information Technology. Most of these private institutions are local counterparts of overseas institutions and are offering programmes ranging from sub-degree to postgraduate ones through a mixed-mode system, encompassing both distance learning and face-to face tutorials. A majority of the examinations are conducted by the Mauritius Examinations Syndicate (MES) and a few are organised and invigilated by the overseas institutions themselves in collaboration with the local partner. Key players include the Charles Telfair Institute, MALEM, the Mauritius Employers Federation and the Mauritius Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry.

===University of the Indian Ocean===
The UIO, established in January 1998 under the aegis of the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), is a network of tertiary education and research institutions of the five member states, namely Comores, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Seychelles. It offers tertiary level programmes of a regional vocation in the five member countries. During its three-year pilot phase, the secretariat of the UIO was based in Reunion. In line with a recent decision, the seat of the UIO will be a rotating one among member states.

===Institut de la Francophonie pour L’Entrepreneuriat===
IFE came into operation in 1999, within the context of an agreement signed between the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research and the &quot;Association des Universités Partiellement ou Entièrement de Langue Française et L’Université des Réseaux d’Expréssion Française&quot;. It offers Masters and Doctoral programmes and undertake research in entrepreneuriat and related fields with a regional vocation.

<text>Lawrence R. Rabiner (born 28 September 1943) is an electrical engineer working in the fields of digital signal processing and speech processing; in particular in digital signal processing for automatic speech recognition. He has worked on systems for AT&amp;T Corporation for speech recognition.

He holds a joint academic appointment between Rutgers University and the University of California, Santa Barbara.

==Education==
* B.S. in electrical engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1964
* M.S. in electrical engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1964
* Ph.D. in electrical engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1967

==Research interests==
* Digital signal processing
* Speech processing
* Multimodal user interfaces
* Multimedia communications
* Shared collaboration systems for tele-collaboration

==Life==
Rabiner was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1943. During his studies at MIT, he participated in the cooperative program at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, during which he worked on digital circuit design and binaural hearing. After obtaining his PhD in 1967, he joined AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories&#x27; research division in Murray Hill, NJ as a member of technical staff. He was promoted to supervisor in 1972, department head in 1985, director in 1990, and functional vice-president in 1995. He joined the newly created AT&amp;T Labs - Research in 1996 as director of the Speech and Image Processing Services Research Laboratory. He was promoted vice-president of Research in 1998, succeeding Sandy Fraser, where he managed broad programs in communication, computing, and information sciences. He retired from AT&amp;T in 2002 and joined the department of electrical engineering at Rutgers University, with a joint appointment at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Rabiner pioneered a range of novel algorithms for digital filtering and digital spectrum analysis. The most well known of these algorithms are the Chirp z-Transform method (CZT) of spectral analysis, a range of optimal FIR (finite impulse response) digital filter design methods based on linear programming and Chebyshev approximation methods, and a class of decimation/interpolation methods for digital sampling rate conversion. In the area of speech processing, Rabiner has made contributions to the fields of pitch detection, speech synthesis and speech recognition. Rabiner built one of the first digital speech synthesizers that was able to convert arbitrary text to intelligible speech. In the area of speech recognition, Rabiner was a major contributor to the creation of the statistical method of representing speech that is known as hidden Markov modeling (HMM). Rabiner was the first to publish the scaling algorithm for the Forward–Backward method of training of HMM recognizers. His research showed how to successfully implement an HMM system based on either discrete or continuous density parameter distributions. His tutorial paper on HMM is highly cited. Rabiner&#x27;s research resulted in a series of speech recognition systems that went into deployment by AT&amp;T to enable automation of a range of ‘operator services’ that previously had been carried out using live operators. One such system, called the Voice Recognition Call Processing (VRCP) system, automated a small vocabulary recognition system (5 active words) with word spotting and barge-in capability. It resulted in savings of several hundred millions of dollars annually for AT&amp;T.

<text>Évreux () is a commune in and the capital of the department of Eure, in the French region of Normandy.

==History==
===Antiquity===

In late Antiquity, the town, attested in the fourth century CE, was named &quot;Mediolanum Aulercorum&quot;, &quot;the central town of the Aulerci&quot;, the Gallic tribe then inhabiting the area. Mediolanum was a small regional centre of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis. Julius Caesar wintered eight legions in this area after his third campaigning season in the battle for Gaul (56-55 BC): Legiones VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII and XIV.

===Middle Ages===

The first known members of the family of the counts of Évreux were descended from an illegitimate son of Richard I, duke of Normandy. These counts became extinct in the male line with the death of Count William in 1118. The county passed by right of Agnes, William&#x27;s sister and wife of Simon I de Montfort (died 1087) to the house of the lords of Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury. Amaury VI de Montfort-Évreux ceded the title in 1200 to King Philip II. Philip IV presented it in 1307 to his brother Louis d&#x27;Évreux, for whose benefit Philip the Long raised the county of Évreux into the peerage of France in 1317.

Philip d&#x27;Évreux, son of Louis, became king of Navarre by his marriage to Joan II of Navarre, daughter of Louis the Headstrong, and their son Charles the Bad and their grandson Charles the Noble were also kings of Navarre. The latter ceded his counties of Évreux, Champagne and Brie to King Charles VI of France in 1404. In 1427 the county of Évreux was bestowed by King Charles VII on Sir John Stewart of Darnley (c. 1365–1429), the commander of his Scottish bodyguard, who in 1423 had received the seigniory of Aubigny, and in February 1427 or 1428 he was granted the right to quarter the royal arms of France for his victories over the English. On Stuart&#x27;s death before Orléans, during an attack on an English convoy, the county reverted to the crown.

===Modernity===
The countship was again temporarily alienated (1569–1584) as an appanage for Duke François of Anjou, and in 1651 was finally given to Frédéric Maurice de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, duc de Bouillon, in exchange for the Principality of Sedan. The most famous holder of the title is Louis Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, son of Marie Anne Mancini. 

Évreux was heavily damaged during the Second World War, and most of its centre was rebuilt. The nearby Évreux-Fauville Air Base was used by the United States Air Force until 1967, and since then by the French Air Force.


==Name==
The French name is derived from the Eburovices, a Gallic tribe who inhabited the area. Their name comes from the Gaulish meaning &#x27;yew tree&#x27;.&quot;

==Demographics==

The inhabitants of Évreux are known as Ebroicians ().

===Population===
===Catholicism===
Évreux Cathedral has been the seat of the bishops of Évreux since its traditional founder, Saint Taurin of Évreux, most probably working between 375 and 425; Bishop Maurusius was present at the Council of Orléans in 511. The earliest parts of the present building, which is mostly Gothic, date from the eleventh century. The west façade and its two towers are mostly from the late Renaissance; the octagonal central tower dates from the late fifteenth century. Of especial note are the Lady chapel and its stained glass, the rose windows in the transepts and the carved wooden screens of the side chapels. The church of the former abbey of St-Taurin is in part Romanesque. It has a choir of the 14th century and other portions of later date, and contains the thirteenth-century shrine of Saint Taurin. The episcopal palace, a building of the fifteenth century, adjoins the south side of the cathedral. The belfry facing the hôtel de ville also dates from the fifteenth century.

===Judaism===
In the Middle Ages, Évreux was one of the centres of Jewish learning, and its scholars are quoted in the medieval notes to the Talmud called the Tosafot. The following rabbis are known to have lived at Évreux: Samuel ben Shneor, praised by his student Isaac of Corbeil as the &quot;Prince of Évreux&quot;, one of the most celebrated tosafists; Moses of Évreux, brother of Samuel, author of the Tosafot of Évreux; Isaac of Évreux; Judah ben Shneor, or Judah the Elder, author of liturgical poems; Meïr ben Shneor; Samuel ben Judah; Nathan ben Jacob, father of Jacob ben Nathan, who in 1357 copied the five Megillot with the Targum for Moses ben Samuel.

==Sights==
Évreux is situated in the pleasant valley of the Iton, arms of which traverse the town; on the south, the ground slopes up toward the public gardens and the railway station. It is the seat of a bishop, and its cathedral is one of the largest and finest in France.

Henry I of France rebuilt the cathedral as an act of atonement to the Pope. Between 1194 and 1198, the conflict between Philippe Auguste and Richard the Lion-hearted damaged the new cathedral. The architecture of the present edifice shows this history, with its blend of Romanesque and Gothic styles. As did many towns in the regions of Nord and Normandy, Évreux and its cathedral suffered greatly from Second World War.

At Le Vieil-Évreux (lit. &quot;the old Évreux&quot;), the Roman Gisacum, southeast of the town, the remains of a Roman theatre, a palace, baths and an aqueduct have been discovered, as well as various relics, notably the bronze of &quot;Jupiter Stator&quot;, which are now deposited in the museum of Évreux.

The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1895.

The Église Saint-Taurin dates back to the 10th century.

===Mayors===
Évreux has historically maintained socialist politics, with Roland Plaisance of the French Communist Party serving as mayor for over two decades (1977–2001). Plaisance was followed by Jean-Louis Debré, in some part due to the latter&#x27;s friendship with Jacques Chirac. In 2014, Guy Lefrand (UMP, centre-right) a former member of the National Assembly of France, was elected mayor, with a mandate lasting six years.

<text>Hampton is a developing township to the south of Peterborough, in the Peterborough district, in the ceremonial county of Cambridgeshire, England.

==Hampton==

The first two neighbourhoods to be complete are Hampton Hargate, which is home to a community of around 1,700 homes, and Hampton Vale, with approximately 1,900 homes. Each neighbourhood is based around its own local centre with community facilities, shops and primary school. Work is continuing on building a third neighbourhood at Hempsted, while planning is now underway on a fourth neighbourhood, the Hamptons, which, like other parts of Hampton, will have its own distinct character.

Adjoining these is Hampton&#x27;s central and commercial area where the Serpentine Green shopping centre, Hampton College secondary and primary schools, and two business parks - Cygnet Park and Kingston Park, are located.

Eventually Hampton will have up to 8,500 new homes spread over its four local areas, with additional schools, local centres and leisure facilities, as well as commercial and retail areas providing more than 12,000 jobs. Construction started in 1996 and is scheduled to continue until at least 2023.

==Homes==
Since the first arrivals to Holly Walk, Hampton Hargate, in 1997, more than 5000 new homes have been built at a rate of up to 500 a year. More than 30 home builders and housing associations have built schemes, including around 900 units of affordable housing.

Innovative homes schemes include a zero carbon house built in association with Morris Homes. Two self-build schemes have been included, allowing people to design and build their own homes.

==Schools==
The success of Hampton&#x27;s schools has led to rapid expansion. Hampton Hargate Primary School was built in 2000 with one entry form (FE), extended in 2002 to two FE, and further extended in 2012 to three FE. Hampton Vale Primary was built in 2004 as a one FE school, expanded to a two FE in 2002, and further extended in 2012 to three FE. A third primary school opened in 2013 on the Hampton College campus.
Hampton Gardens Secondary School opened in 2017 followed by Hampton Lakes Primary School in 2020.

==Hampton College==
Hampton College, a secondary school built to serve Hampton, opened to years 7 and 8 in September 2005. By 2008 the school accepted students in years 7 through to 11. Further expansion, including a sixth form, was initially due for completion by 2010. Although the school will begin AS Level courses in September 2009, the date for the new buildings is currently under review. The school currently boasts an outdoor amphitheatre and is built around a courtyard setting. In the evenings, the school is used for a variety of groups and adult education classes and it is hoped that the school will eventually form the heart of the community within Hampton. The college was recently found to be &#x27;outstanding&#x27; by Ofsted, and was rated as outstanding in 6 out of a possible 7 categories. This puts it in the top 2% of schools nationally.

==Economy==
Hampton has a jobs-to-homes ratio of 1.25. Total rateable value of Hampton businesses now exceeds £20m.

Companies with distribution centres at Kingston Park, Hampton, include IKEA, Debenhams and Prologis. Other well-known names include News International, Kiddicare, GKL Northern and Volvo. Deafblind UK and Mencap have headquarters operations in Hampton.

The 2011 UK census showed Orton with Hampton ward has the highest proportion of employed people in Peterborough. 76.6% of 16- to 74-year-olds are working.

==Serpentine Green==

Hampton is served by a large shopping centre - Serpentine Green - which opened in 1999 and includes a Tesco Extra hypermarket, Boots, Costa Coffee, CEX, and many other High St names. It is located off the A15 road and has free parking. 
==Community==
There are currently two community centres on Hampton. The first is alongside Hargate Primary School, the second opened at Hampton Vale local centre in 2011. Other community facilities include Active Hampton, used by Hampton Football Club which has grown to have 23 separate squads for girls and boys.

==Environment==
Hampton has been cited by Natural England as an exemplar of how to integrate new development into the surrounding landscape. Its master developers, O&amp;H Properties, have maintained their pledge to provide at least 50% open space, and have planted around 110,000 trees.

Charities Froglife, The Wildlife Trust and Buglife, are involved in the design of the open space, including Hampton Nature Reserve which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The reserve is home to Europe&#x27;s largest population of Great Crested Newts and is managed by the charity Froglife. 
 It is notable not only for its amphibian population but at least 27 butterfly species, 18 species of dragonfly and 120 of water beetles.

The three miles of cycleway through the southern section of Hampton are part of Peterborough&#x27;s 50-mile Green Wheel route encircling the city.

==Arts==
A £50,000 sculpture competition resulted in David Nash (artist) OBE RA being commissioned to create a five piece work, The Noon Vessel, for the courtyard of Hampton College, creating shadows as the sun moves around.

==History==
The township is being developed on the site of former brick fields. The Ancient Romans were the first to work the Oxford clay in this area and by the twentieth century was one of the UK&#x27;s most important producers of bricks. Bricks from this area were known as &quot;flettons&quot; after the town, the term later became a little more generic.

<doc id="638285" wikidata="Q4950318" url="?curid=638285" title="Bournville">
<text>Bournville () is an affluent model village on the southwest side of Birmingham, England, founded by the Quaker Cadbury family for employees at its Cadbury&#x27;s factory, and designed to be a &quot;garden&quot; (or &quot;model&quot;) village where the sale of alcohol was forbidden. Cadbury&#x27;s is well known for chocolate products – including a dark chocolate bar branded &quot;Bournville&quot;. Historically in northern Worcestershire, it is also a ward within the council constituency of Selly Oak and home to the Bournville Centre for Visual Arts and the Cadbury&#x27;s chocolate factory. Bournville is known as one of the most desirable areas to live in the United Kingdom; research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2003 found that it was &quot;one of the nicest places to live in Britain&quot;.

== History ==

Originally the area that was to become Bournville consisted of a few scattered farmsteads and cottages, linked by winding country lanes, with the only visual highlight being Bournbrook Hall, which was built during the Georgian era.

The bluebell glades of Stock Wood were said to be a relic of the Forest of Arden and there are Roman remains nearby.

Though Selly Manor and Minworth Greaves date back to the 14th century or earlier, they were each moved to Bournville in the 20th century, and are operated as a museum.

=== Cadbury ===
Having taken over their father John Cadbury&#x27;s expanding business in 1861, the Quakers George and Richard Cadbury needed to move their cocoa and chocolate factory from Bridge Street in central Birmingham to a greenfield site to allow for expansion.

Cadbury were reliant on the canals for milk delivery, and on the railways for cocoa deliveries from the ports of London and Southampton. They therefore needed a site which was undeveloped and had easy access to both canal and rail. The brothers noticed the proposed development of the Birmingham West Suburban Railway, which would extend from central Birmingham south along the path of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal into the then green fields of southern Birmingham and the villages of northern Worcestershire.

In 1879, they moved their business to Bournbrook Hall, to the south of Birmingham. The location was chosen as it was regarded as cleaner, healthier and more amenable to longer-term expansion plans. Although rural, it was also already serviced by the new Stirchley Street railway station, which itself was located right next to the canal.

The Cadburys named the area &#x27;Bournville&#x27; after a local river named The Bourn (not to be confused with Bourn Brook, a similarly named local river for which the neighbourhood of Bournbrook is named); with &#x27;ville&#x27; being French for &#x27;town&#x27;; this set Bournville apart from the local area. Then the Cadburys began to develop their factory in the new suburb. Loyal and hard-working workers were treated with great respect and relatively high wages and good working conditions; Cadbury also pioneered pension schemes, joint works committees and a full staff medical service.

In 1893, George Cadbury bought 120 acres (0.5 km2) of land close to the works and planned, at his own expense, a model village which would &quot;alleviate the evils of modern, more cramped living conditions&quot;. By 1900, the estate included 313 cottages and houses set on of land, and many more similar properties were built in the years leading up to the First World War, with smaller developments taking place later on in the 20th century. These almost &#x27;Arts and Crafts&#x27; houses were traditional in design but with large gardens and modern interiors, and were designed by the resident architect William Alexander Harvey. These designs became a blueprint for many other model village estates around Britain. It is also noteworthy that, because George Cadbury was a temperance Quaker, no public houses have ever been built in Bournville; however, since the late 1940s, there has been a licensed members&#x27; bar at Rowheath Pavilion.
The Cadburys were particularly concerned with the health and fitness of their British workforce, incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans and encouraging swimming, walking and indeed all forms of outdoor sports. In the early 1920s, extensive open lands were purchased at Rowheath and laid to football and hockey pitches together with a grassed running track. Rowheath Pavilion was designed and built in accordance with the instructions of George Cadbury and opened in July 1924. At that time, it served as the clubhouse and changing rooms for the acres of sports playing fields, several bowling greens, a fishing lake and an outdoor swimming lido, a natural mineral spring forming the source for the lido&#x27;s healthy waters. The Rowheath Pavilion itself, which still exists, was used for balls and dinners and the whole area was specifically for the benefit of the Cadbury workers and their families with no charges for the use of any of the sporting facilities by Cadbury employees or their families. The lido was eventually closed in the 1970s after complaints of noise disturbance were made by residents of the newly built Oak Farm estate, coupled with new and stringent health and safety regulations relating to outdoor public swimming facilities. Cadbury&#x27;s also built the Bournville indoor swimming baths on Bournville Lane (separate buildings for &#x27;girls&#x27; and men), the Valley pool boating lake and the picturesque cricket pitch adjacent to the factory site, that was made famous as the picture on boxes of Milk Tray chocolates throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.

In 1900, the Bournville Village Trust was set up to formally control the development of the estate, independently of George Cadbury or the Cadbury company. Elizabeth Cadbury succeeded her husband as chair of the Bournville Village Trust in 1922. The trust focused on providing schools, hospitals, museums, public baths and reading rooms. As Bournville is a conservation area, another job of the Bournville Village Trust is to accept or reject plans for building extension and modification.

An almost campus feel evolved, with a triangular village green, infant and junior schools, the School of Art and the Day Continuation School (originally intended for young Cadbury employees) and a host of events such as fêtes and Maypole dances. The carillon and a Quaker meeting house are also beside the village green.

The trust continues to exercise an international influence on housing and town planning generally. Now containing 7,800 homes on 1,000 acres (4 km2) of land with 100 acres (0.4 km2) of parks and open spaces, Bournville remains a popular residential area of Birmingham.

Cadbury is still one of Birmingham&#x27;s main employers, and continues to make chocolate products.

The dark chocolate Bournville Plain is now manufactured in France and sold in the UK.

Cadbury also named their brand of malted drinks Bournvita after Bournville.

Cadbury World is now established here.

== Governance ==
The ward (Bournville &amp; Cotteridge) is served by two councillors, Liz Clements (Labour) and Fred Grindrod (Labour). It is within the boundary of the Birmingham Selly Oak parliamentary constituency. The current Member of Parliament is Alistair Carns.

== Demography ==
The 2011 UK Census found that 21,866 people were living in Bournville with a population density of 4,217 people per km2 compared with 3,649 people per km2 for the city of Birmingham as a whole. Bournville had an area of 639.8 hectares, and within this, it has a population density of 39.8 people per hectare. 52.9% of the population was identified as female, above the city average of 51.6%. A number of students from The University of Birmingham live there, although not as many as in the nearby wards of Selly Oak and Edgbaston.

Bournville has a White broad ethnic group representation of 70.9% of the population. The Asian broad ethnic group was the second largest at 15.4%. More specifically, the White British group is the largest ethnic group at 64.1%, well above the city average of 48.5% and below the national average of 85.4%.

The largest employer in the area is Mondelez International, employing approximately 6,500 people. Serco Integrated Services is the second-largest employer in Bournville, employing approximately 1,800 people.

Although Bournville is most famous for its turn-of-the-20th century Cadbury style homes, a significant amount of more modern stock also exists in the area – not all of which was built by Cadbury&#x27;s. The local authority built several homes around Bournville before and after the Second World War. Bryant Homes built a collection of upmarket and mostly detached houses in the west of Bournville during the 1970s.

== Education ==
Elizabeth Cadbury focused on education and youth work at Bournville. Primary schools in the area include Bournville Junior School, Bournville Infant School and St Francis Primary School. St Francis has 243 children on roll and was opened in 1979 and the 26 place nursery was officially opened by Professor Tim Brighouse in November 1998.

Dame Elizabeth Cadbury School is a secondary school and sixth form in Bournville named after Dame Elizabeth Cadbury. Opened in 1955 located on Woodbrooke Road. The school badge shows the Bourne brook flanked by a tree each side.

Bournville School is a secondary school in the Birmingham Local Education Authority area. It is a secondary school and primary school with academy status, for students aged 4–16, Birmingham in the United Kingdom. Bournville is served by Bournville College of Further Education, which features a sixth form college and higher education programmes. The college relocated to a new campus in Longbridge in September 2011 at a cost of £66 million kick-starting wider regeneration of the area after the collapse of carmaker MG Rover in 2005.

The Bournville Centre for Visual Arts, located at Ruskin Hall on Linden Road, has been part of the Birmingham Institute of Art and Design (BIAD) at Birmingham City University since 1988. It offers undergraduate, foundation and self-development courses.

== Transport ==
Bournville lies on the A4040, the ring road developed in the 1920s and served by the 11A and 11C Birmingham Outer Circle bus routes. The 27 (Hawkesley to Maypole) and 84 (Hawkesley to Queen Elizabeth Hospital) bus services also serve the area.

Road access into Birmingham City Centre is via either the Bristol Road (A38), served by the X61 (Birmingham to Frankley), 63 (Birmingham to Frankley), 98 (Birmingham to Rubery Great Park) and 144 (Birmingham to Worcester) bus routes, or the Pershore Road (A441), served by the 45 and 47 (Birmingham to Longbridge) buses. Trams ran on these routes until 1952.

Bournville is served by Bournville railway station on the Cross-City Line to Birmingham New Street, Lichfield and Redditch. While other suburban Birmingham railway stations feature the black and green corporate livery of Network West Midlands, Bournville railway station is instead painted in Cadbury&#x27;s purple.

The National Cycle Network route five passes near Bournville (map) towards Hurst Street in the City Centre. The Worcester and Birmingham Canal towpath can be joined at the railway station and serves as a de facto cycle route to Brindleyplace.

== Religion ==

Christian churches in Bournville include St Francis of Assisi Church which is also the Church of England parish church. The ward is also served by a joint Church of England and Methodist venture in the church dedicated to Saint Andrew and Oak Tree Church, meeting at Dame Elizabeth Hall. Rowheath Pavilion Church meets in Rowheath Pavilion. In addition to a site in Moseley, Riverside Church also meets in Bournville, at Dame Elizabeth Cadbury School.

There is a purpose-built Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Lazar, known by its members as Lazarica, formally the Church of the Holy Prince Lazar and is to be found in Cob Lane. The church is built in the traditional Byzantine style of the Balkans and is consciously modelled on some famous examples. The interior is decorated in the full scheme of the Orthodox Tradition with wall-paintings afresco. The parish is part of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Britain and Scandinavia, which comes under the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church.

As Bournville was founded by Quakers, a meeting house was built. Being intended also to serve other Christian denominations, it was equipped with an organ, which would not normally be expected in a Quaker meeting house in Britain. The Bournville Friends Meeting House is located on Linden Road, and features a bust of George Cadbury by Francis Wood, installed in 1924. The building, designed by William Alexander Harvey, was constructed in 1905. As a part of this Quaker tradition, Bournville is a dry town with no alcohol permitted to be sold within the historic estate boundaries.

<doc id="638288" wikidata="Q918137" url="?curid=638288" title="Renault Kangoo">
<text>The Renault Kangoo is a family of vans built by Renault since 1997 across three generations. It is sold as a passenger multi-purpose vehicle or as a light commercial vehicle. For the European market, the Kangoo is manufactured at the MCA plant in Maubeuge, France.

The Kangoo was also marketed as a rebadged variant by Nissan in Europe as the Nissan Kubistar (first generation), Nissan NV250 (second generation) and Nissan Townstar (third generation). In September 2012, Mercedes-Benz began marketing a rebadged variant of the second generation Kangoo as the Mercedes-Benz Citan, which is also marketed as Mercedes EQT and Mercedes T-Class for the current generation.

, the electric variant, the Renault Kangoo Z.E., is Europe&#x27;s top selling all-electric light commercial vehicle, with global sales of 48,821 units since its inception in 2011.

== First generation X76 (FC/KC; 1997) ==
The first-generation Kangoo was introduced in October 1997, and was facelifted in March 2003, with new front end nose styling, especially the grille, standardised across the Renault range, with the Renault diamond mounted on a body colour panel in the centre of the grille and teardrop headlamps.

The rear windows and seats of the Kangoo could be removed, producing the panel van Kangoo Express. The Kangoo became popular with mobility-impaired people and wheelchair users due to its height and accessibility and because it could be adapted to include mounting points for wheelchairs. The rear of the vehicle is cut to allow a ramp to be fitted. A pair of front tie downs are fitted (retractable seat belts with a solenoid release to allow them to be extended, passed around the wheelchair frame and then locked back when the solenoid is switched off and they retract); this stops the wheelchair from moving back. A pair of rear tie downs with the normal clamping buckles stop the wheelchair from moving forward. A normal, long seat belt is worn by the wheelchair user.

Both the Kangoo and Kangoo Express were available in four-wheel drive versions. A lengthened version was also available, with an increased cargo area. A pickup version was sold in the Swedish market. In some countries, such as Malaysia, the Kangoo was assembled by Nissan with third row seats.

From July 2003, &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; starred in adverts in the United Kingdom for the Kangoo.
===Break&#x27;Up===
The Kangoo Break&#x27;Up was a four-wheel drive concept car announced in August 2002 and previewed the facelift design due in 2003, together with a pick up-style rear. It was powered by a 1.6 L engine producing .
=== Kangoo Trekka 4x4===

The 4WD version of the Kangoo was introduced in 2002, and was marketed under the model name Trekka. It should not be confused with the Skoda-powered New Zealand-built utility vehicle named Trekka, which was marketed in the Antipodes for several years circa 1970.

The Kangoo Trekka&#x27;s all-wheel drive system differed from the Renault Scénic RX4 in its inclusion of a Nissan-sourced automatic torque coupling &quot;ATC&quot;, a hydraulic coupling that would engage drive on all four wheels should the front wheels start to lose traction.

This allowed the Kangoo Trekka to run in front-wheel drive in most conditions, thus saving fuel. Working in combination with the ATC, the Kangoo Trekka featured an electronically controlled &quot;ASR&quot; traction control system which could brake the front wheels to arrest traction loss.

The suspension on the front had longer front struts with revised coil springs, lower suspension arms were revised to a cast steel item. The rear suspension was completely revised from the standard Kangoo torsion bar suspension beam axle to a fully independent coil-sprung system with wishbones. The rear differential was centrally mounted with two driveshafts transmitting power to the rear wheels. All this was carried on a subframe which increased the ground clearance and wheel travel.

These changes gave the Kangoo Trekka a fording depth and 28 degree hill climbing capability. The Kangoo Trekka was marketed in the UK with a choice of two engines, the 1.6 L 16 valve petrol engine and the 1.9 L dCi common rail turbodiesel, both with a five speed manual gearbox.

In 2005, these models were priced at £12,600 and £13,600 respectively. The diesel produced a peak torque of and achieved over on the combined (urban and extra urban) fuel consumption test.

The petrol engine had a time of 14.3 seconds, and a combined fuel consumption of . The interior of the Kangoo Trekka was spartan. The rear bench seat could be folded forward to provide a loading area, with better access through the sliding side doors.

===Argentina===

The first-generation Kangoo was produced in Argentina from 1998 to 2018. The panel van production was launched in 1998, and the passenger model in 2001. It received a first facelift in 2008. A second facelift internally codenamed VLL (&quot;Very Long Life&quot;) was unveiled in 2013 exclusively for the Argentine market, featuring styling cues from Renault&#x27;s then-current design language. It was discontinued in 2018 to make way for its replacement, based on the Dokker, after 374 591 units had been produced in Argentina for the local market, and some other Latin America countries (Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Cuba).
===Engines===
The Kangoo and Kangoo Express was/is available with a choice of multiple engines:

Some LPG and CNG variants of petrol engines have also been produced.
===Nissan Kubistar===
A badge-engineered version of the Kangoo panel van was sold as the Nissan Kubistar in many European markets from 2003 to 2009. Nissan applied the &quot;X76&quot; model code to the Kubistar.
===Electric===
Cleanova II is a hybrid electric drive train system, used in a vehicle based on Renault Kangoo, with two electric versions: full electric vehicle (FEV) and plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV).
== Second generation X61 (FW/KW; 2007) ==
The second-generation Kangoo are based on the Scénic and manufactured in Maubeuge. Sales began in May 2007. A seven-seat version, which is longer by 40 cm, became available from July 2012.

They are also sold by Mercedes-Benz as the Mercedes-Benz Citan, with a revised front design, being launched in September 2012. In February 2012, Renault retired the Kangoo MPV, Espace, Laguna, Modus, and Wind lines in the United Kingdom.

A facelifted version of both the van and the passenger versions was available from the beginning of 2013.

In November 2018, it was announced that Nissan would rebadge the Kangoo, turning it into the NV250. The Nissan NV250 launched in December 2019 and is currently sold in the United Kingdom.

===Body styles===
The Kangoo is available in three wheelbase configurations: the Kangoo Express, the Kangoo Compact with a shorter wheelbase, and the Kangoo Express Maxi with a longer wheelbase – all three offered in passenger variants. The short wheelbase version was sold as the Kangoo Be Bop between 2009 and 2012.

The payload of the Kangoo Express and Express Maxi is between and depending on version and market, while the Kangoo Compact with its short wheelbase has a reduced payload of . The Kangoo Express Maxi has up to of usable floor length.

====Kangoo Be Bop====
Following the 2007 &quot;Renault Kangoo Compact Concept&quot;, the &quot;Renault Kangoo Be Bop&quot; was presented at 2008 Paris Motor Show. This long model, with only three doors, is equipped with a sliding glass roof at the rear, 4 seats and a two-tone body. Judged expensive and unpractical, the Kangoo Be Bop was a commercial failure, and only 1,400 units were produced between 2009 and 2011.

===Kangoo Z.E.===
;History
As part of its Z.E. electric car initiative, Renault has developed the Kangoo Z.E. model that is manufactured at its Maubeuge plant. A prototype was shown at the September 2010 International Commercial Vehicles Show in Hanover, Germany, and the electric van was released for retail sales in October 2011. In November 2011, the Kangoo Z.E. was voted &quot;International Van of the Year&quot; for 2012. It was also elected &quot;Electric Vehicle of the Year&quot; in 2012 and 2013 by GreenFleet.

It was introduced to Mexico on 15 October 2020. In 2021, the next-generation electric Kangoo was introduced as the Kangoo E-Tech electric, based on the Renault–Nissan CMF-C/D platform.

;Sales
A total of 3,652 Kangoo Z.E. utility vans were registered in France through December 2012, and, with 2,869 units delivered in 2012, the electric van became the top selling plug-in electric vehicle in the country. During 2011, the Kangoo Z.E. sold 991 units in Europe, and cumulative sales in the region reached 6,658 units sold in the region through December 2012, with global sales of 6,665 units.

Worldwide cumulative sales passed the 10,000 mark by the start of September 2013, representing about 10% of overall Kangoo van global sales. The Kangoo Z.E. is the leader of the small all electric van segment, and the best selling electric vehicle in France, with 9,125 units registered through June 2014. The vehicle was updated in 2017.

The Kangoo Z.E. is Europe&#x27;s top-selling all-electric light commercial vehicle, with global sales of 48,821 units since its inception through December 2019.

;Drivetrain
The Kangoo Z.E. has the same dimensions as the internal combustion model. It uses a synchronous electric motor with rotor coil. Its peak power is at 10,500 rpm, while maximum torque is . Its top speed is capped electronically to . The vehicle is powered by a 22 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that delivers a combined cycle range of NEDC which varies depending on factors such as type of road, ambient temperature, speed or driving style. Maximum charging power is limited to 3.7 kW (AC).

The Kangoo Z.E. Power+, released in 2017, includes four changes: a new battery, a new motor, a new charger, and a heat pump. The new battery has a capacity of 33 kWh for a range of according to the NEDC cycle. The new R60 traction motor produces the same peak power , but was developed by Renault, based on the R90 motor found in Renault Zoe. Charging power has doubled to 7 kW, and the heat pump provides a more efficient method of heating the cabin.

== Third generation XFK (FFK/KFK; 2020) ==
The third-generation Kangoo was revealed on 12 November 2020, alongside the lower-spec, separate model called Express. It is based on an all-new CMF-CD platform developed by Renault and Nissan. Production started late 2020 and sales early 2021.

A rebadged version called the Nissan Townstar was revealed in September 2021 to replace the NV200 and NV250 in various markets. In Europe, the electric Nissan e-NV200 will be replaced by a Townstar EV based on the Kangoo E-Tech Electric.

In 2024, the Kangoo was slightly updated with Renault&#x27;s latest logo.

;Notes
===Kangoo E-Tech Electric===

The third generation Renault Kangoo was previewed by the Renault Kangoo Z.E. concept presented on 23 April 2019, which was said to be 80% representative of the production model. The Kangoo Z.E. concept (2019) is an electric vehicle and has no pillar at the leading edge of the sliding side door to facilitate access, like the Frendzy concept. A prototype of the production electric Kangoo, renamed to Kangoo Van E-Tech Electric, was first shown in March 2021. It was officially introduced in November 2021 to succeed the prior electric Kangoo Z.E., which was based on the second-generation Kangoo and had been produced since 2011. Production was scheduled to start in 2022.
The 100% electric production panel van model entered production in June 2022. It is offered in two lengths, with cargo volume of or . The passenger version was launched in October 2022 at the 2022 Paris Motor Show.

The Kangoo E-Tech is equipped with a traction motor that delivers and , drawing from a 45 kW-hr battery which gives the vehicle an estimated range of under the WLTP mixed driving cycle. So equipped, the van accelerates from in 11.6 seconds and has a top speed of . There is a limited-power Eco mode, which reduces output to and maximum speed to . The standard onboard charger is limited to 11 kW (AC); as an option, the vehicle can be fitted with a charger that allows input power up to 80 kW (DC) or 22 kW (AC).
===Safety===
====Euro NCAP====
The Townstar in its standard European market configuration received 4 stars from Euro NCAP in 2021 with its results borrowed from the Kangoo.

<doc id="638291" wikidata="Q4388" url="?curid=638291" title="Red squirrel">
<text>The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), also called Eurasian red squirrel, is a species of tree squirrel in the genus &quot;Sciurus&quot;. It is an arboreal and primarily herbivorous rodent and common throughout Eurasia.

==Taxonomy==
There have been over 40 described subspecies of the red squirrel, but the taxonomic status of some of these is uncertain. A study published in 1971 recognises 16 subspecies and has served as a basis for subsequent taxonomic work. Although the validity of some subspecies is labelled with uncertainty because of the large variation in red squirrels even within a single region, others are relatively distinctive and one of these, &quot;S. v. meridionalis&quot; of South Italy, was elevated to species status as the Calabrian black squirrel in 2017. At present, there are 23 recognized subspecies of the red squirrel. Genetic studies indicate that another, &quot;S. v. hoffmanni&quot; of Sierra Espuña in southeast Spain (below included in &quot;S. v. alpinus&quot;), deserves recognition as distinct.

==Description==

The red squirrel has a typical head-and-body length of , a tail length of , and a mass of . Males and females are the same size.

The long tail helps the squirrel to balance and steer when jumping from tree to tree and running along branches and may keep the animal warm during sleep.

The coat of the red squirrel varies in colour with time of year and location. There are several coat colour morphs ranging from black to red. Red coats are most common in Great Britain; in other parts of Europe and Asia different coat colours coexist within populations, much like hair colour in some human populations. The underside of the squirrel is always white-cream in colour. The red squirrel sheds its coat twice a year, switching from a thinner summer coat to a thicker, darker winter coat with noticeably larger ear-tufts (a prominent distinguishing feature of this species) between August and November. A lighter, redder overall coat colour, along with the ear-tufts in adults and smaller size, distinguish the red squirrel from the eastern grey squirrel.

==Distribution and habitat==

Red squirrels occupy boreal, coniferous woods in northern Europe and Siberia, preferring Scots pine, Norway spruce and Siberian pine. In western and southern Europe they are found in broad-leaved woods where the mixture of tree and shrub species provides a better year-round source of food. In most of the British Isles and in Italy, broad-leaved woodlands are now less suitable due to the better competitive feeding strategy of introduced grey squirrels.

In Great Britain, Ireland and in Italy, red squirrel populations have decreased in recent years. This decline is associated with the introduction by humans of the eastern grey squirrel (&quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot;) from North America. However, the population in Scotland is stabilising due to conservation efforts.

==Ecology and behaviour==

The red squirrel is found in both coniferous forest and temperate broadleaf woodlands. The squirrel makes a drey (nest) out of twigs in a branch-fork, forming a domed structure about in diameter. This is lined with moss, leaves, grass and bark. Tree hollows and woodpecker holes are also used. The red squirrel is a solitary animal and is shy and reluctant to share food with others. However, outside the breeding season and particularly in winter, several red squirrels may share a drey to keep warm. Social organization is based on dominance hierarchies within and between sexes; although males are not necessarily dominant to females, the dominant animals tend to be larger and older than subordinate animals, and dominant males tend to have larger home ranges than subordinate males or females.

The red squirrel eats mostly the seeds of trees, neatly stripping conifer cones to get at the seeds within, fungi, nuts (especially hazelnuts but also beech, chestnuts and acorns), berries, vegetables, garden flowers, tree sap and young shoots.
More rarely, red squirrels may also eat bird eggs or nestlings. A Swedish study shows that out of 600 stomach contents of red squirrels examined, only 4 contained remnants of birds or eggs.

Excess food is put into caches called &quot;middens&quot;, either buried or in nooks or holes in trees, and eaten when food is scarce. Although the red squirrel remembers where it created caches at a better-than-chance level, its spatial memory is substantially less accurate and durable than that of grey squirrels.
Between 60% and 80% of its active period may be spent foraging and feeding. The red squirrel exhibits a crepuscular activity pattern. It often rests in its nest in the middle of the day, avoiding the heat and the high visibility to birds of prey that are dangers during these hours. During the winter, this mid-day rest is often much briefer, or absent entirely, although harsh weather may cause the animal to stay in its nest for days at a time.

No territories are claimed between the red squirrels and the feeding areas of individuals overlap considerably.

===Reproduction===

Mating occurs in late winter during February and March and in summer between June and July. Up to two litters a year per female are possible. Each litter averages three young, called kits. Gestation is about 38 to 39 days. The young are looked after by the mother alone and are born helpless, blind, and deaf. They weigh between 10 and 15g. Their body is covered by hair at 21 days, their eyes and ears open after three to four weeks, and they develop all their teeth by 42 days. Juvenile red squirrels can eat solids around 40 days following birth and from that point can leave the nest on their own to find food; however, they still suckle from their mother until weaning occurs at 8 to 10 weeks.

During mating, males detect females that are in oestrus by an odour that they produce, and although there is no courtship, the male will chase the female for up to an hour prior to mating. Usually, several males will chase a single female until the dominant male, usually the largest in the group, mates with the female. Males and females will mate several times with many partners. Females must reach a minimum body mass before they enter oestrus, and heavy females on average produce more young. If food is scarce breeding may be delayed. Typically a female will produce her first litter in her second year.

===Life expectancy===

Red squirrels that survive their first winter have a life expectancy of 3 years. Individuals may reach 7 years of age, and 10 in captivity. Survival is positively related to the availability of autumn-winter tree seeds; on average, 75–85% of juveniles die during their first winter, and mortality is approximately 50% for winters following the first.

===Competitors===
Arboreal predators include small mammals such as the pine marten, wildcats and the stoat, which preys on nestlings; birds, including owls and raptors such as the goshawk and buzzards, may also take the red squirrel. The red fox, cats and dogs can prey upon the red squirrel when it is on the ground. Humans influence the population size and mortality of the red squirrel by destroying or altering habitats, by causing road casualties, and by introducing non-native populations of the North American eastern grey squirrels.

The eastern grey squirrel and the red squirrel are not directly antagonistic, and violent conflict between these species is not a factor in the decline in red squirrel populations. However, the eastern grey squirrel appears to be able to decrease the red squirrel population due to several reasons:
*The eastern grey squirrel carries a disease, the squirrel parapoxvirus, that does not appear to affect their own health but will often kill the red squirrel. It was revealed in 2008 that the numbers of red squirrels at Formby (England) had declined by 80% as a result of this disease, though the population is now recovering.
*The eastern grey squirrel can better digest acorns, while the red squirrel cannot access the proteins and fats in acorns as easily.
*When the red squirrel is put under pressure, it will not breed as often.

In the UK, due to the above circumstances, the population has today fallen to 160,000 red squirrels or fewer; 120,000 of these are in Scotland. Outside the UK and Ireland, the impact of competition from the eastern grey squirrel has been observed in Piedmont, Italy, where two pairs escaped from captivity in 1948. A significant drop in red squirrel populations in the area has been observed since 1970, and it is feared that the eastern grey squirrel may expand into the rest of Europe.
==Conservation==
The red squirrel is protected in most of Europe, as it is listed in Appendix III of the Bern Convention; it is listed as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List. However, in some areas it is abundant and is hunted for its fur.

Although not thought to be under any threat worldwide, the red squirrel has nevertheless drastically reduced in number in the United Kingdom; especially after the eastern grey squirrel was introduced from North America in the 1870s. Fewer than 140,000 individuals are thought to be left in 2013; approximately 85% of which are in Scotland, with the Isle of Wight being the largest haven in England. A local charity, the Wight Squirrel Project, supports red squirrel conservation on the island, and islanders are actively recommended to report any invasive greys. The population decrease in Britain is often ascribed to the introduction of the eastern grey squirrel from North America, but the loss and fragmentation of its native woodland habitat has also played a significant role.

In contrast, the red squirrel may present a threat if introduced to regions outside its native range. It is classed as a &quot;prohibited new organism&quot; under New Zealand&#x27;s Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 preventing it from being imported into the country.

===Projects===

In January 1998, eradication of the non-native North American grey squirrel began on the North Wales island of Anglesey. This facilitated the natural recovery of the small remnant red squirrel population. It was followed by the successful reintroduction of the red squirrel into the pine stands of Newborough Forest. Subsequent reintroductions into broadleaved woodland followed and today the island has the single largest red squirrel population in Wales. Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour is also populated exclusively by red rather than grey squirrels (approximately 200 individuals).

Mainland initiatives in southern Scotland and the north of England also rely upon grey squirrel control as the cornerstone of red squirrel conservation strategy. A local programme known as the &quot;North East Scotland Biodiversity Partnership&quot;, an element of the national Biodiversity Action Plan was established in 1996. This programme is administered by the Grampian Squirrel Society, with an aim of protecting the red squirrel; the programme centres on the Banchory and Cults areas. In 2008, the Scottish Wildlife Trust announced a four-year project which commenced in the spring of 2009 called &quot;Saving Scotland&#x27;s Red Squirrels&quot;.

Other notable projects include red squirrel projects in the Greenfield Forest, including the buffer zones of Mallerstang, Garsdale and Widdale; the Northumberland Kielder Forest Project; and within the National Trust reserve in Formby. These projects were originally part of the Save Our Squirrels campaign that aimed to protect red squirrels in the north of England, but now form part of a five-year Government-led partnership conservation project called &quot;Red Squirrels Northern England&quot; to undertake grey squirrel control in areas important for red squirrels. However, grey squirrels were found to outnumber red squirrels in both Cumbria and Northumberland for the first time. In Northumberland grey sightings were 25% higher than reds, and in Cumbria they were 17.3% higher.

On the Isle of Wight, local volunteers are encouraged to record data on the existing red squirrel population, and to monitor it for the presence of invasive greys; as the red squirrel is still dominant on the island, these volunteers are also requested to cull any greys they find. In order to protect existing populations, increasing amounts of legislation have been issued to prevent the further release and expansion of grey squirrel populations. Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, it is an offense to release captured grey squirrels, indicating that any captured individuals must be culled. Additional rules covered under the WCA&#x27;s Schedules 5 and 6 include limitations on the keeping of red squirrels in captivity, and also prohibits the culling of red squirrels.

Research undertaken in 2007 in the UK credits the pine marten with reducing the population of the invasive eastern grey squirrel. Where the range of the expanding pine marten population meets that of the eastern grey squirrel, the population of these squirrels retreats. It is theorised that, because the grey squirrel spends more time on the ground than the red, they are far more likely to come in contact with this predator.

During October 2012, four male and one female red squirrel, on permanent loan from the British Wildlife Centre, were transported to Tresco in the Isles of Scilly by helicopter, and released into Abbey Wood, near the Tresco Abbey Gardens. Only two survived and a further 20 were transported and released in October 2013. Although the red squirrel is not indigenous to the Isles of Scilly, those who supported this work intend to use Tresco as a &quot;safe haven&quot; for the endangered mammal, as the islands are free of predators such as red foxes, and of the Squirrel parapoxvirus-carrying grey squirrel.

The UK Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) has proposed a method of non-lethal control of grey squirrels as part of a 5-year Red Squirrel Recovery Network (RSRN) project. The planned method for control would be by administering oral contraceptives via a grey squirrel-specific feeder, which would selectively allow feeding based on body weight in order to avoid inadvertently distributing the contraceptive to red squirrels as well. This project has received National Lottery Heritage funding.

==Historical, cultural and financial significance==

Squirrel Nutkin is a character, always illustrated as a red squirrel, in English author Beatrix Potter&#x27;s books for children.

&quot;Ekorr&#x27;n satt i granen&quot; (The Squirrel sat in the fir tree) is a well-known and appreciated children&#x27;s song in Sweden. Text and lyrics by Alice Tegnér in 1892.

Charles Dennim, protagonist of Geoffrey Household&#x27;s novel &quot;Watcher in the Shadows,&quot; is a zoologist who studies and writes about red squirrels.

In Norse mythology, Ratatoskr is a red squirrel who runs up and down with messages in the world tree, Yggdrasil, and spreads gossip. In particular, he carried messages between the unnamed eagle at the top of Yggdrasill and the wyrm Níðhöggr beneath its roots.

The red squirrel used to be widely hunted for its pelt. In Finland, squirrel pelts were used as currency in ancient times, before the introduction of coinage. The expression &quot;squirrel pelt&quot; is still widely understood there to be a reference to money. It has been suggested that the trade in red squirrel fur, highly prized in the medieval period and intensively traded, may have been responsible for the leprosy epidemic in medieval Europe. Within Great Britain, widespread leprosy is found early in East Anglia, to which many of the squirrel furs were traded, and the strain is the same as that found in modern red squirrels on Brownsea Island.

The red squirrel is the national mammal of Denmark.

Red squirrels are a common feature in English heraldry, where they are always depicted sitting up and often in the act of cracking a nut.

<text>Vidsel () is a locality situated in Älvsbyn Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 533 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated about 900 km north of Stockholm, Sweden, in the Arctic Circle.

==History==
Perhaps its earliest history is as a seasonal settlement, but permanent inhabitants have lived here since the 19th century.

The town was mainly founded in the 1950s, because of &quot;Robotförsöksplats Norr&quot; (RFN) (Missile Test Area North)/Vidsel Test Range. The range forms part of the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) Testing Directorate, which is responsible for the verification of systems procured for the Swedish Armed Forces.

RFN is the largest overland test range in Western Europe, consisting of 1,650 km2 of uninhabited forest and marshland, which can be extended by 1,500 km2 if required. The installation includes a military base with a 2,300 m runway. Because of its usage as a Swedish and European missile test site, this remote area is often listed in international weather forecasts and maps.

The site has been a test area for most Swedish flight developments, including Draken, Viggen and Gripen.

<text>Snufkin (original Swedish: Snusmumrik[en]&quot; or Mumriken]&quot;, Finnish: Nuuskamuikkunen) is a character in the Moomin series of books written by Swedish-speaking Finn Tove Jansson, appearing in six of the nine books; his first appearance is in the second book, &quot;Comet in Moominland&quot;. He is the best friend of the series&#x27; protagonist, Moomintroll, and lives a nomadic lifestyle, only staying in Moominvalley in the spring and summer, leaving for warmer climates down south every winter. He is the son of the elder Mymble and the Joxter, and is half-brother to the Mymble&#x27;s daughter and Little My.

Snufkin serves as the main protagonist in the 2024 video game .

== Description ==
Snufkin wears old green clothes and a wide-brimmed hat that he has had since birth. He lives in a tent, smokes a pipe and plays the harmonica. Snufkin also has a great dislike for authority figures such as the Park Keeper and the many regulation signs and fences he erects. At one point, he sabotages the Park Keeper by planting Hattifatteners in his garden, causing them to grow and drive him out. He has a great hatred for all symbols of private property, even losing his temper with the Hemulen after the latter attempts to put up a sign declaring &quot;Moominvalley&quot;.

Snufkin&#x27;s age is never specified outright in any of the books. He has had more mature conversations with Moominpappa and is notoriously wise and mysterious. However, he enjoys playing with Moomintroll and other children, and sometimes acts just as childish as them. He is also referred to as young and/or a child multiple in the series, and is younger than Little My, though he is easily twice her size. In problem situations, others often turn to the help of Snufkin, and he enjoys the unreserved admiration of the inhabitants of the valley for his wisdom. His advice is also followed. The way Snufkin thinks intersects a wide range of philosophical views. He is undoubtedly one of the most multi-faceted characters in &quot;The Moomins&quot;. Snufkin has said that no one should own more than they can handle, and he cannot understand his friend Sniff&#x27;s affection for worldly things. Snufkin once even throws his tent in the gorge, because he thinks it is not worth clinging to useless property, but instead can write a poem when he sees something beautiful.

== Inspiration ==
Tove Jansson based the character of Snufkin on her friend and one-time fiancé, Atos Wirtanen. A typical feature of Snufkin, to come and go independently without caring for others, is inspired by the nature of Atos Wirtanen; at the time, Wirtanen was the center of Jansson&#x27;s life, but Wirtanen was so busy working as an MP that he came and went, leading to the failure of their relationship. Wirtanen&#x27;s style was also borrowed in the recognizable green hat of Snufkin.

==Reception==

The character has a mostly positive reception.

<text>Fly! is a flight simulator video game for Windows and Macintosh developed by Terminal Reality and published by Gathering of Developers.

==Gameplay==

It includes simulation of air traffic control features as well as aircraft&#x27;s on-board systems, and was acclaimed for its highly detailed fully working interactive cockpits. Featured aircraft are fixed-wing light to medium aircraft. An enhanced version, &quot;Fly! 2K&quot;, and add-on, &quot;Wilco&#x27;s 737 for Fly!&quot;, were released in 2000. &quot;Fly! 2K&quot; added user-created add-ons, enhanced graphics, real world and real-time weather generation via the ability to import METAR reports from NOAA, and support for Roger Wilco. The improvements were made available for owners of the original &quot;Fly!&quot; via a free patch. Another version titled &quot;Fly! 2K: German Edition&quot; was released in early 2001. It added Ruhr area to the game. It is intended to replace the Fly! 2 main program (exe) and remain fully compatible with previous versions, scenery, aircraft, etc. The first publicly available version was released in 2010.

==Development==
The game was in development for more than three years. It was developed by a team of 20 people.

==Reception==
&quot;Fly!&quot; and &quot;Fly! 2K&quot; received mixed or average reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. It sold 93,000 units by October 2001.

==Sequel==
&quot;Fly! II&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Fly!&quot; released on April 26, 2001 for Windows and Macintosh. Macintosh version was distributed by MacSoft. Said sequel and &quot;Fly! 2K&quot; sold combined 47,000 units by October 2001.

===Reception===

Danny Atkin for Computer Gaming World said &quot;Fly! II is this year&#x27;s poster child for programs shoved out the door before completion–publisher Gathering of Developers not only shipped FLY! II with bugs and missing features, it even left out most of the manual. The shame of it all is that the finished parts are quite good, and developer Terminal Reality has been very quick to post patches and missing terrain data.&quot;

<doc id="638303" wikidata="Q529545" url="?curid=638303" title="Junkers Jumo 205">
<text>The Jumo 205 aircraft engine was the most numerous of a series of aircraft diesel engines produced by Junkers. The Jumo 204 first entered service in 1932. Later engines of this type comprised the experimental Jumo 206 and Jumo 208, with the Jumo 207 produced in some quantity for the Junkers Ju 86P and -R high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, and the 46-meter wingspan, six-engined Blohm &amp; Voss BV 222 &quot;Wiking&quot; flying boat. All three of these variants differed in stroke and bore and supercharging arrangements. In all, more than 900 of these engines were produced, in the 1930s and through most of World War II.

==Design and development==
These engines all used a two-stroke cycle with 12 pistons sharing six cylinders, piston crown to piston crown in an opposed configuration. This unusual configuration required two crankshafts, one at the bottom of the cylinder block and the other at the top, geared together. The pistons moved towards each other during the operating cycle. The intake ports were located at one end of the cylinder, whereas the exhaust ports were at the other end. This made one piston effectively control the intake, and the other control the exhaust. Two cam-operated injection pumps per cylinder were used, each feeding two nozzles, for four nozzles per cylinder in all.

As is typical of two-stroke designs, the Jumos used no valves, but rather fixed intake and exhaust port apertures cut into the cylinder liners during their manufacture, which were uncovered when the pistons reached a certain point in their strokes. Normally, such designs have poor volumetric efficiency because both ports open and close at the same time and are generally located across from each other in the cylinder. This leads to poor scavenging of the burnt charge, which is why valveless two-strokes generally produce smoke and are inefficient.

The Jumo largely addressed this problem through a clever arrangement of the ports. The intake port was positioned under the &quot;lower&quot; piston, while the exhaust port was under the &quot;upper&quot; piston. The lower crankshaft operated 11° behind the upper, causing the exhaust ports to open and close first, which allowed for proper scavenging. This design enabled the two-stroke Jumos to run nearly as cleanly and efficiently as four-stroke engines with valves, but with significantly less complexity.

Some downside exists to this system, as well. For one, since matching pistons were not closing at quite the same time, but one ran &quot;ahead&quot; of the other, the engine could not run as smoothly as a true opposed-style engine. In addition, the power from the two opposing crankshafts had to be geared together, adding weight and complexity, a problem the design shared with H-block engines.

In the Jumo, these problems were avoided to some degree by taking power primarily from the &quot;upper&quot; shaft, somewhat offset upwards on the engine&#x27;s front end. All of the accessories, such as fuel pumps, injectors and the scavenging compressor, were run from the lower shaft, meaning over half of its power was already used up. What was left over was then geared to the upper shaft, which ran the engine&#x27;s propeller.

In theory, the flat layout of the engine could have allowed it to be installed inside the thick wings of larger aircraft, such as airliners and bombers. Details of the oil scavenging system suggest this was not possible and the engine had to be run &quot;vertically&quot;, as it was on all designs using it.

Because the temperature of the exhaust gases of the Jumo diesel engines was substantially lower than that of comparable carburettor engines, it was easier to add a turbocharger for higher altitudes. This was explored in the Jumo 207 which used the energy of the exhaust gases to increase the power at high altitudes. The turbocharger was combined with a mechanically driven blower, so that the turbocharger creates the first stage of compression, and the mechanical blower the second stage. At low load and startup, the turbocharger does not contribute to supercharging the engine, but the mechanical blower provides enough air for the engine to operate. At high load, however, the turbocharger receives sufficient quantities of exhaust gas, which means that it alone can provide enough supercharging without the need of the inefficient mechanical blower. The addition of the turbocharger to the mechanical blower made the engine more powerful without significantly increasing its specific fuel consumption.

;Jumo 218: A 12-cylinder version, the Jumo 218, was designed but never built.
;Jumo 223: A single 24-cylinder four-crankshaft Jumo 223 was built and tested.
;Jumo 224: Larger than the Jumo 223 by combining 4 Jumo 207 C engines. 
;CLM Lille 6As: A license-built version from CLM Lille, delivering (CLM was the predecessor to the engine maker, a sister company to Peugeot)
;CLM Lille 6BrS: A developed version of the 6As used to power the Bernard 86

==Applications==
The Jumo 205 powered early versions of the Junkers Ju 86 bomber, but was found too unresponsive for combat and liable to failure at maximum power, common for combat aircraft. Later versions of the design also used the engine for extreme high-altitude use, as with the Ju 86P and -R versions for high-altitude reconnaissance over the British Isles. In January 1940, the Luftwaffe tested the prototype Ju 86P with Jumo 207A-1 turbocharged diesel engines. It was far more successful as a power unit for airships, for which its characteristics were ideal, and for noncombat applications such as the Blohm &amp; Voss Ha 139 airliner. Its more fuel-efficient operation lent itself for use on Germany&#x27;s few maritime patrol flying-boat designs during World War II, such as the BV 138 and BV 222.

<doc id="638305" wikidata="Q310009" url="?curid=638305" title="Harald Bohr">
<text>Harald August Bohr (22 April 1887 – 22 January 1951) was a Danish mathematician and footballer. After receiving his doctorate in 1910, Bohr became an eminent mathematician, founding the field of almost periodic functions. His brother was the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr. He was on the Denmark national team for the 1908 Summer Olympics, where he won a silver medal.

==Biography==
Bohr was born in 1887 to Christian Bohr, a professor of physiology, from a Lutheran background, and Ellen Adler Bohr, a woman from a wealthy Jewish family of local renown. Harald had a close relationship with his elder brother, which &quot;The Times&quot; likened to that between Captain Cuttle and Captain Bunsby in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;.

==Mathematical career==
Like his father and brother before him, in 1904 Bohr enrolled at the University of Copenhagen, where he studied mathematics, obtaining his master&#x27;s degree in 1909 and his doctorate a year later. Among his tutors were Hieronymus Georg Zeuthen and Thorvald N. Thiele. Bohr worked in mathematical analysis; much of his early work was devoted to Dirichlet series including his doctorate, which was entitled &quot;Bidrag til de Dirichletske Rækkers Theori&quot; (&quot;Contributions to the Theory of Dirichlet Series&quot;). A collaboration with Göttingen-based Edmund Landau resulted in the Bohr–Landau theorem, regarding the distribution of zeroes in zeta functions.

Bohr worked in mathematical analysis, founding the field of almost periodic functions, and worked with the Cambridge mathematician G. H. Hardy.

In 1915, he became a professor at Polyteknisk Læreanstalt (today Technical University of Denmark), working there until 1930, when he took a professorship at the University of Copenhagen. He remained in this post for 21 years until his death in 1951. Børge Jessen was one of his students there.

He was a visiting professor at Stanford University during the academic year 1930–1931. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in the summer of 1948.

Bohr was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1945.

In the 1930s Bohr was a leading critic of the anti-Semitic policies taking root in the German mathematical establishment, publishing an article criticising Ludwig Bieberbach&#x27;s ideas in &quot;Berlingske Aften&quot; in 1934.

==Football==

Bohr was also an excellent football player. He had a long playing career with Akademisk Boldklub, making his debut as a 16-year-old in 1903. During the 1905 season he played alongside his brother Niels, who was a goalkeeper. Harald was selected to play for the Denmark national team in the 1908 Summer Olympics, where football was an official event for the first time. Though a Danish side had played at the 1906 Intercalated Games, the opening match of the 1908 Olympic tournament was Denmark&#x27;s first official international football match. Bohr scored two goals as Denmark beat the French &quot;B&quot; team 9–0. In the next match, the semi-final, Bohr played in a 17–1 win against France, which remains an Olympic record. Denmark faced hosts Great Britain in the final, but lost 2–0, and Bohr won a silver medal. After the Olympics he made one further appearance for the national team, in a 2–1 victory against an England amateur team in 1910. His popularity as a footballer was such that when he defended his doctoral thesis the audience was reported as having more football fans than mathematicians.

==Teacher==
Bohr was known as an extremely capable academic teacher and the annual award for outstanding teaching at the University of Copenhagen is called the Harald, in honour of Harald Bohr. With Johannes Mollerup, Bohr wrote an influential four-volume textbook &quot;Lærebog i Matematisk Analyse&quot; (&quot;Textbook in mathematical analysis&quot;).

== Kaj Munk ==
Following the murder of Kaj Munk on 4 January 1944 the Danish resistance newspaper &quot;De frie Danske&quot; brought condemning reactions from influential Scandinavians, including Bohr.

<doc id="638307" wikidata="Q5048696" url="?curid=638307" title="Cash for comment affair">
<text>The cash for comment affair was an Australian scandal that broke in 1999 concerning paid advertising in radio that was presented to the audience in such a way as to sound like editorial commentary. John Laws, a shock jock radio presenter for Sydney talk back, was accused of misusing his authority as an announcer. While the initial publicity had died down by the end of the year, it sparked major changes in the way the radio industry is conducted in Australia. This resulted in a second scandal in 2004, leading to the resignation of Australian Broadcasting Authority head David Flint, after he had been found to have been less than impartial in his role in original &quot;cash for comment&quot; investigations.

Some have pointed to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, which has treated the media more as a business than a cultural institution, for a decline in the relevance of ethical standards in the Australian media industry.

==Reporting==
In 1999, reporters Richard Ackland, Deborah Richards and Anne Connolly from ABC&#x27;s &quot;Media Watch&quot; programme revealed that 2UE talk back hosts John Laws and Alan Jones had been paid to give favourable comment to companies including Qantas, Optus, Foxtel, Mirvac and major Australian banks, without disclosing this arrangement to listeners. Prior to giving favourable commentary to a group of banks, Laws had repeatedly criticised them for imposing unjustified fees on customers while cutting back on services.

Though they both initially vehemently denied any wrongdoing, Laws and Jones defended the practice by claiming that they were not employed as journalists but as &quot;entertainers&quot;, and thus had no duty of disclosure or of journalistic integrity.

==Inquiry==

The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) estimated the value of these arrangements at AUD$18 million, and found that Laws, Jones, and 2UE had committed 90 breaches of the industry code and five breaches of 2UE&#x27;s license conditions. The inquiry heard that Laws received cash and VIP hospitality at Sydney&#x27;s Star City Casino for not discussing negative aspects of gambling.

The ABA made it clear that Laws was not a journalist, but a radio personality, and so journalistic ethical standards didn&#x27;t apply to him. The inquiry focused on the extent to which deliberate commercial endorsement had led to distortions in which the public was misled about important matters. Regulations were subsequently tightened to prevent such behaviour; however, the ABA was accused of weakness and inconsistency in enforcing these regulations. Included in the changes were new sponsor disclosure requirements. Laws used a cow bell to announce sponsor deals following more stringent disclosure requirements.

In 2004, Laws and Jones were again accused of cash for comment in relation to deals both had made with Telstra. Laws was found to have breached the rules but Jones was cleared; the revelation of flattering letters written by ABA head David Flint to Jones, at the same time that Jones was under investigation, led to accusations of impropriety that ultimately forced Flint&#x27;s resignation.

==Fines==
2UE was fined $360,000 for Laws&#x27;s improper conduct. Initially the radio station was to pay the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), the succeeding media regulatory agency to the ABA, AUD$10,000 for each of the 13 breaches involving a sponsor disclosure requirement. The Communications Law Centre intervened, arguing that a harsher penalty was appropriate. This led to the Federal Court imposing a larger fine.

<text>The Diana camera is a plastic-bodied toy camera that uses 120 roll film and 35 mm film. The camera has a simple plastic meniscus lens. Originally marketed as an inexpensive novelty gift item, the Diana has been used to specifically take soft focus, impressionistic photographs somewhat reminiscent of the Pictorialist Period of artistic photography, branded in contemporary times as Lomography.

The Diana frequently suffers from light leaks, film advance issues, and other problems. However, its low-quality plastic lens has been celebrated for its artistic effects in photographs, normally resulting in a slightly blurred composition that can provide a &#x27;dreamlike&#x27; quality to the print.

==History==
The Diana first appeared during the early 1960s as an inexpensive box camera sold by the &quot;Great Wall Plastic Factory&quot; of Kowloon, Hong Kong. Most were exported to the United States and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the Diana was imported by the &quot;Power Sales Company&quot; of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. During the 1960s, Power Sales Company wholesaled the Diana by the case – 144 cameras – at about 50 cents U.S. per unit to a variety of retailers and promotional merchandisers.

Most Diana cameras were given away or sold for nominal sums as novelties or prizes at fairs, carnivals, product promotions, raffles, or other events. For a time, the camera was also regularly advertised for sale in various periodicals through mail order vendors. However, with the development of inexpensive, higher quality consumer cameras such as the Kodak Instamatic, together with the declining popularity of rollfilm, demand for the Diana – even as a novelty gift – gradually disappeared. Production of the Diana, its clones, close copies, and variants is believed to have stopped in the 1970s, though similar 35 mm box cameras were produced for many years thereafter by various companies in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China for use as promotional items.

It is currently marketed as the “Diana F+” in the original 120 format as well as &quot;Diana Mini&quot; in 35 mm format and the &quot;Diana Baby 110&quot; by Lomography. The current iteration of the medium-format Diana F+ is actually a system camera with interchangeable lenses, flashes, and film backs. Lomography also makes Diana lens adapters for several major DSLR systems, including Canon EOS, Nikon F-mount, and Micro Four Thirds.

A digital version of the camera was produced in 2014 by Greg Dash of Cyclops Cameras. The project was funded through crowdfunding platform Indiegogo, allowing Dash to produce a limited run of 1000 digital Diana cameras (a camera he called the &#x27;Rhianna&#x27;).

== Characteristics and variants ==
The Diana is a very simply constructed box camera with a mechanical film advance, spring-loaded shutter, and a primitive plastic viewfinder. It is constructed primarily of low-quality phenolic plastics of the type commonly found in toys imported from Asia during the 1960s. Because of wide variances in production quality, combined with a poorly designed camera body latching mechanism, Diana cameras are predisposed to light leaks onto the exposed film. If not desired, such leaks can be temporarily remedied by sealing the seams with light-proof tape after loading the film. The design of the Diana incorporates a crude lens that produces an image circle which only marginally covers the diagonal of a film frame. This marginal coverage field produces images with often pronounced vignetting. The poor quality of the plastic meniscus lens results in generally low contrast and resolution, odd color rendition, chromatic aberration, and blurred images. Additionally, the film spool may become loose or out of place when winding the film on to the next frame. Finally, the crude advance and shutter mechanism can result in images that are not properly centered or exposed.

Although these attributes are generally thought undesirable in a camera, various photographers and art photography schools have intentionally utilized these characteristics to produce photographs with interesting or artistic effects. The San Francisco Art Institute seems to have been the first school to employ the Diana in its photography program in 1967-68 as a way of stimulating creative vision without undue reliance upon camera features and technology. Later other schools picked up the idea, including Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. The use of the Diana in this role achieved a new level of fame when the camera was utilized by American photographer (and former Ohio University photography student) Nancy Rexroth in an influential 1976 photographic exhibit and book entitled &quot;IOWA&quot;.

In addition to the &#x27;Diana&#x27; labeled cameras, there are over fifty similar variants of the basic design, some of which may have been produced by other factories and/or manufacturers. The camera was sold under a variety of model names, often accomplished by merely affixing a different stick-on label to the same product. In other cases, slight modifications to the basic design were incorporated. Some Diana clones use a slightly different molding and plastic composition, while other models have a &#x27;bulb&#x27; setting for time exposures. Other variants incorporate a 6×6 cm negative size (like the Diana Deluxe), while others have provision for different controls or even separate flash illumination. The 3 aperture version of the classic Diana/Diana clone has apertures of , , and , and it takes 32 mm clip-on filters. The Diana Deluxe variant offers , , and , and takes a 46–49 mm step-up ring, unusual for such a low-end camera.

A twist on the classic 1960s first version Diana, the latest Diana F+ was produced in 2007. The modern Diana F+ offers four apertures, including a pinhole. Shutter speed is often variable due to manufacturing vagaries, and can vary from 1/200th to 1/30th of a second. As there is no shutter lock, and the shutter mechanism is always held in tension by a spring, multiple exposures with the Diana can be achieved by multiple operations of the shutter release without advancing the film. The Diana F+ can be used with the Diana Instant Back+, the Diana 35mm Back+ as well as the so as to produce a series of dreamy, radiant and lo-fi photos.

<doc id="638310" wikidata="Q1269719" url="?curid=638310" title="Damping factor">
<text>In an audio system, the damping factor is defined as the ratio of the rated impedance of the loudspeaker (usually assumed to be ) to the source impedance of the power amplifier. It was originally proposed in 1941. Only the magnitude of the loudspeaker impedance is used, and the power amplifier output impedance is assumed to be totally resistive.

In typical solid state and tube amplifiers, the damping factor varies as a function of frequency. In solid state amplifiers, the damping factor usually has a maximum value at low frequencies, and it reduces progressively at higher frequencies. The figure to the right shows the damping factor of two amplifiers. One is a solid state amplifier (Luxman L-509u) and the other is a tube amplifier (Rogue Atlas). These results are fairly typical of these two types of amplifiers, and they serve to illustrate the fact that tube amplifiers usually have much lower damping factors than modern solid state amplifiers, which is an undesirable characteristic.

== Calculation ==
The source impedance (that is seen by the loudspeaker) includes the connecting cable impedance. The load impedance formula_1 and the source impedance formula_2 are shown in the circuit diagram.

The definition of damping factor formula_3 normally used to characterize audio amplifiers is:
formula_4

However, in this form formula_3 is not in fact proportional to the electrical circuit damping. The load is the source of energy being damped, and if formula_2 = 0, the damping resistance in series with the energy source cannot fall below formula_1 itself (unless formula_2 is made negative, which is usually impractical). This fact was admitted and an improved definition was proposed, called the damping ratio formula_9:
formula_10
Nevertheless, the former definition has attained standard use.

== Explanation ==
Pierce undertook an analysis of the effects of amplifier damping factor on the decay time and frequency-dependent response variations of a closed-box, acoustic suspension loudspeaker system. The results indicated that any damping factor over 10 is going to result in inaudible differences between that and a damping factor equal to infinity. However, it was also determined that the frequency-dependent variation in the response of the loudspeaker due to the output resistance of the amplifier is much more significant than the effects on system damping. It is also important to not confuse these effects with damping effects, as they are caused by two quite different mechanisms. The calculations suggested that a damping factor in excess of 50 will not lead to audible improvements, all other things being equal.

For audio power amplifiers employing some global negative feedback, this source impedance formula_2 is generally smaller than , which from the point of view of the driver voice coil is a near short circuit.

The loudspeaker&#x27;s nominal load impedance (input impedance) of formula_1 is usually around , although other impedance speakers are available, sometimes dropping as low as or . However, the impedance rating of a loudspeaker is simply a number that indicates the nominal minimum impedance of that loudspeaker over a representative portion of its operating frequency range. It needs to be kept in mind that most loudspeakers have an impedance that varies considerably with frequency. For a dynamic loudspeaker driver, a peak in the impedance is present at the free-air resonance frequency of the driver, which can be significantly greater in magnitude than the nominal rated impedance. In addition, the electrical characteristics of every voice coil will change with temperature (high power levels increase voice coil temperature, and thus resistance), the inductance of voice-coil windings leads to a rising impedance at high frequencies, and passive crossover networks (composed of relatively large inductors, capacitors, and resistors) introduce further impedance variations in multi-way loudspeaker systems. Referring to the equation for formula_3 that was given above, this frequency-dependent variation in loudspeaker load impedance results in the value of the damping factor of the amplifier varying with frequency when it is connected to a loudspeaker impedance load.

In loudspeaker systems, the value of the damping factor between a particular loudspeaker and a particular amplifier describes the ability of the amplifier to control undesirable movement of the speaker cone near the resonant frequency of the speaker system. It is usually used in the context of low-frequency driver behavior, and especially so in the case of electrodynamic drivers, which use a magnetic motor to generate the forces which move the diaphragm. A high damping factor in an amplifier is sometimes considered to result in the amplifier having greater control over the movement of the speaker cone, particularly in the bass region near the resonant frequency of the driver&#x27;s mechanical resonance. 

Speaker diaphragms have mass, and their compliant suspension components have stiffness. Together, these form a resonant system, and the mechanical cone resonance may be excited by electrical signals (for example, pulses) at audio frequencies. But a driver with a voice coil is also a current generator, since it has a coil attached to the cone and suspension, and that coil is immersed in a magnetic field. For every motion the coil makes, it will generate a current that will be seen by any electrically attached equipment, such as an amplifier. In fact, the output circuitry of the amplifier will be the main electrical load on the &quot;voice coil current generator&quot;. If that load has low resistance, the current will be larger, and the voice coil will be more strongly forced to decelerate. A high damping factor (which requires low output impedance at the amplifier output) very rapidly damps unwanted cone movements induced by the mechanical resonance of the speaker, acting as the equivalent of a &quot;brake&quot; on the voice coil motion (just as a short circuit across the terminals of a rotary electrical generator will make it very hard to turn). It is generally (though not universally) thought that tighter control of voice coil motion is desirable, as it is believed to contribute to better-quality sound.

== The damping circuit ==
The voltage generated by the moving voice coil forces current through three resistances:
* The resistance of the voice coil itself
* The resistance of the interconnecting cable
* The output resistance of the amplifier

=== Effect of voice coil resistance ===
This is the key factor in limiting the amount of damping that can be achieved electrically, because its value is larger (say between 4 and 8 Ω typically) than any other resistance in the output circuitry of an amplifier that does not use an output transformer (nearly every solid-state amplifier on the mass market).

A loudspeaker&#x27;s flyback current is not only dissipated through the amplifier output circuit, but also through the internal resistance of the loudspeaker itself. Therefore, the choice of different loudspeakers will lead to different damping factors when coupled with the same amplifier.

=== Effect of cable resistance ===
The damping factor is affected to some extent by the resistance of the speaker cables. The higher the resistance of the speaker cables, the lower the damping factor.

=== Amplifier output impedance ===
Modern solid state amplifiers, which use relatively high levels of negative feedback to control distortion, have very low output impedances—one of the many consequences of using feedback—and small changes in an already low value change overall damping factor by only a small, and therefore negligible, amount.

Thus, high damping factor values do not, by themselves, say very much about the quality of a system; most modern amplifiers have them, but vary in quality nonetheless.

Vacuum-tube amplifiers typically have much lower feedback ratios, and in any case almost always have output transformers that limit how low the output impedance can be. Their lower damping factors are one of the reasons many audiophiles prefer tube amplifiers. Taken even further, some tube amplifiers are designed to have no negative feedback at all.

== In practice ==
Typical modern solid-state amplifiers with negative feedback tend to have high damping factors, usually above 50 and sometimes even greater than 150. High damping factors tend to reduce the extent to which a loudspeaker &quot;rings&quot; (undergoes unwanted short-term oscillation after an impulse of power is applied), but the extent to which damping factors higher than about 20 help in this respect is easily overstated; there will be significant effective internal resistance, as well as some resistance and reactance in crossover networks and speaker cables. Older amplifiers, plus modern triode and even solid-state amplifiers with low negative feedback, will tend to have damping factors closer to unity, or even less than 1.

Although extremely high values of damping factor in an amplifier will not necessarily make the loudspeaker–amplifier combination sound better, a high damping factor can serve to reduce the intensity of added frequency response variations that are undesirable. The figure on the right shows the effect of damping factor on the frequency response of an amplifier when that amplifier is connected to a simulated loudspeaker impedance load. This load is moderately demanding but not untypical of high-fidelity loudspeakers that are on the market, and it is based on the circuit proposed by Atkinson. The audio magazines &quot;Stereophile&quot; and &quot;Australian Hi-Fi&quot; have recognised the importance of amplifier damping factor, and have made the use of the simulated loudspeaker load a routine part of their amplifier measurements. At around , the real-life difference between an amplifier with a moderate (100) damping factor and one with a low (20) damping factor is about 0.37 dB. However, the amplifier with the low damping factor is acting more like a subtle graphic equaliser than is the amplifier with the moderate damping factor, where the peaks and dips in the amplifier&#x27;s frequency response correspond closely to the peaks and dips in the loudspeaker impedance response.

It is clear from the various amplifier frequency response curves that low damping factor values result in significant changes in the frequency response of the amplifier in a number of frequency bands. This will result in broad levels of sound coloration that are highly likely to be audible. In addition, the frequency response changes will depend on the frequency-dependent impedance of whichever loudspeaker happens to be connected to the amplifier. Hence, in high-fidelity sound reproduction systems, amplifiers with moderate to high damping factors are the preferred option if accurate sound reproduction is desired when those amplifiers are connected to typical multi-way loudspeaker impedance loads.

Some amplifier designers, such as Nelson Pass, claim that loudspeakers can sound with lower electrical damping, although this may be attributed to listener preference rather than technical merit. A lower damping factor helps to enhance the bass response of the loudspeaker by several decibels (where the impedance of the speaker would be at its maximum), which is useful if only a single speaker is used for the entire audio range. Therefore, some amplifiers, in particular vintage amplifiers from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, feature controls for varying the damping factor. While such bass &quot;enhancement&quot; may be pleasing to some listeners, it nonetheless represents a distortion of the input signal.

One example of a vintage amplifier with a damping control is the Accuphase E-202, which has a three-position switch described by the following excerpt from its owner&#x27;s manual:
Damping is also a concern in guitar amplifiers (an application in which controlled distortion is desirable) and low damping can be better. Numerous guitar amplifiers have damping controls, and the trend to include this feature has been increasing since the 1990s. For instance the Marshall Valvestate 8008 rack-mounted stereo amplifier has a switch between &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;Valvestate&quot; mode:
: &quot;Linear/Vstate selector. Slide to select linear or Valvestate performance. The Valvestate mode gives extra warm harmonics plus the richness of tone, which is unique to the Valvestate power stage. Linear mode produces a highly defined hi-fi tone that gives a totally different character to the sound and suits certain modern &quot;metal&quot; styles, or PA applications.&quot;

This is actually a damping control based on negative current feedback, which is evident from the schematic, where the same switch is labeled as &quot;Output Power Mode: Current/Voltage&quot;.

<text>The Junkers Jumo 223 was an experimental 24-cylinder aircraft engine based on the Junkers Jumo 205. Like the Jumo 205, it was an opposed piston two-stroke diesel engine. It had four banks of six cylinders in a rhomboid configuration, with four crankshafts, one at each vertex of the rhombus, and 48 pistons. It was designed for a power of 2,500 horsepower at 4,400 rpm, and weighed around 2,370 kg.

Only one example is known to have been built. It is rumoured to have been taken to Moscow at the end of World War II, where development may have continued.

== Jumo 224 ==
In 1942 the 223 was abandoned in favour of an even larger engine, the Jumo 224 with an intended output power of 4,500 horsepower.

The Jumo 223 series was influential to the successful three-crankshaft Napier Deltic engine.

<doc id="638312" wikidata="Q1046373" url="?curid=638312" title="Critical section">
<text>In concurrent programming, concurrent accesses to shared resources can lead to unexpected or erroneous behavior. Thus, the parts of the program where the shared resource is accessed need to be protected in ways that avoid the concurrent access. One way to do so is known as a critical section or critical region. This protected section cannot be entered by more than one process or thread at a time; others are suspended until the first leaves the critical section. Typically, the critical section accesses a shared resource, such as a data structure, peripheral device, or network connection, that would not operate correctly in the context of multiple concurrent accesses.

== Need for critical sections ==

Different codes or processes may consist of the same variable or other resources that must be read or written but whose results depend on the order in which the actions occur. For example, if a variable is to be read by process A, and process B must write to the variable at the same time, process A might get either the old or new value of .
Process A:

// Process A
.
b = x + 5; // instruction executes at time = Tx

Process B:

// Process B
.
x = 3 + z; // instruction executes at time = Tx


In cases where a locking mechanism with finer granularity is not needed, a critical section is important. In the above case, if A needs to read the updated value of , executing process A, and process B at the same time may not give required results. To prevent this, variable is protected by a critical section. First, B gets the access to the section. Once B finishes writing the value, A gets the access to the critical section, and variable can be read.

By carefully controlling which variables are modified inside and outside the critical section, concurrent access to the shared variable are prevented. A critical section is typically used when a multi-threaded program must update multiple related variables without a separate thread making conflicting changes to that data. In a related situation, a critical section may be used to ensure that a shared resource, for example, a printer, can only be accessed by one process at a time.

== Implementation of critical sections ==
The implementation of critical sections vary among different operating systems.

A critical section will usually terminate in finite time, and a thread, task, or process must wait for a fixed time to enter it (bounded waiting). To ensure exclusive use of critical sections, some synchronization mechanism is required at the entry and exit of the program.

A critical section is a piece of a program that requires mutual exclusion of access.
As shown in the figure, in the case of mutual exclusion (mutex), one thread blocks a critical section by using locking techniques when it needs to access the shared resource, and other threads must wait their turn to enter the section. This prevents conflicts when two or more threads share the same memory space and want to access a common resource.
The simplest method to prevent any change of processor control inside the critical section is implementing a semaphore. In uniprocessor systems, this can be done by disabling interrupts on entry into the critical section, avoiding system calls that can cause a context switch while inside the section, and restoring interrupts to their previous state on exit. With this implementation, any execution thread entering any critical section in the system will prevent any other thread, including an interrupt, from being granted processing time on the CPU until the original thread leaves its critical section.

This brute-force approach can be improved by using semaphores. To enter a critical section, a thread must obtain a semaphore, which it releases on leaving the section. Other threads are prevented from entering the critical section at the same time as the original thread, but are free to gain control of the CPU and execute other code, including other critical sections that are protected by different semaphores. Semaphore locking also has a time limit to prevent a deadlock condition in which a lock is acquired by a single process for an infinite time, stalling the other processes that need to use the shared resource protected by the critical section.

==Uses of critical sections ==

=== Kernel-level critical sections ===
Typically, critical sections prevent thread and process migration between processors and the preemption of processes and threads by interrupts and other processes and threads.

Critical sections often allow nesting. Nesting allows multiple critical sections to be entered and exited at little cost.

If the scheduler interrupts the current process or thread in a critical section, the scheduler will either allow the currently executing process or thread to run to completion of the critical section, or it will schedule the process or thread for another complete quantum. The scheduler will not migrate the process or thread to another processor, and it will not schedule another process or thread to run while the current process or thread is in a critical section.

Similarly, if an interrupt occurs in a critical section, the interrupt information is recorded for future processing, and execution is returned to the process or thread in the critical section. Once the critical section is exited, and in some cases the scheduled quantum completed, the pending interrupt will be executed. The concept of scheduling quantum applies to &quot;round-robin&quot; and similar scheduling policies.

Since critical sections may execute only on the processor on which they are entered, synchronization is only required within the executing processor. This allows critical sections to be entered and exited at almost no cost. No inter-processor synchronization is required. Only instruction stream synchronization is needed. Most processors provide the required amount of synchronization by interrupting the current execution state. This allows critical sections in most cases to be nothing more than a per processor count of critical sections entered.

Performance enhancements include executing pending interrupts at the exit of all critical sections and allowing the scheduler to run at the exit of all critical sections. Furthermore, pending interrupts may be transferred to other processors for execution.

Critical sections should not be used as a long-lasting locking primitive. Critical sections should be kept short enough so they can be entered, executed, and exited without any interrupts occurring from the hardware and the scheduler.

Kernel-level critical sections are the base of the software lockout issue.

=== Critical sections in data structures ===
In parallel programming, the code is divided into threads. The read-write conflicting variables are split between threads and each thread has a copy of them. Data structures such as linked lists, trees, and hash tables have data variables that are linked and cannot be split between threads; hence, implementing parallelism is very difficult. To improve the efficiency of implementing data structures, multiple operations such as insertion, deletion, and search can be executed in parallel. While performing these operations, there may be scenarios where the same element is being searched by one thread and is being deleted by another. In such cases, the output may be erroneous. The thread searching the element may have a hit, whereas the other thread may subsequently delete it. These scenarios will cause issues in the program running by providing false data. To prevent this, one method is to keep the entire data structure under critical section so that only one operation is handled at a time. Another method is locking the node in use under critical section, so that other operations do not use the same node. Using critical section, thus, ensures that the code provides expected outputs.

=== Critical sections in relation to peripherals ===

Critical sections also occur in code which manipulates external peripherals, such as I/O devices. The registers of a peripheral must be programmed with certain values in a certain sequence. If two or more processes control a device simultaneously, neither process will have the device in the state it requires and incorrect behavior will ensue.

When a complex unit of information must be produced on an output device by issuing multiple output operations, exclusive access is required so that another process does not corrupt the datum by interleaving its own bits of output.

In the input direction, exclusive access is required when reading a complex datum via multiple separate input operations. This prevents another process from consuming some of the pieces, causing corruption.

Storage devices provide a form of memory. The concept of critical sections is equally relevant to storage devices as to shared data structures in main memory. A process which performs multiple access or update operations on a file is executing a critical section that must be guarded with an appropriate file locking mechanism.

<doc id="638313" wikidata="Q1362323" url="?curid=638313" title="Supermajority">
<text>A supermajority is a requirement for a proposal to gain a specified level of support which is greater than the threshold of one-half used for a simple majority. Supermajority rules in a democracy can help to prevent a majority from eroding fundamental rights of a minority, but can also hamper efforts to respond to problems and encourage corrupt compromises at times when action is taken. Changes to constitutions, especially those with entrenched clauses, commonly require supermajority support in a legislature. Parliamentary procedure requires that any action of a deliberative assembly that may alter the rights of a minority have a supermajority requirement, such as a two-thirds vote. In consensus democracy the supermajority rule is applied in most cases.

==History==
The first known use of a supermajority rule was in juries during the 100s BC in ancient Rome.

Pope Alexander III introduced the use of supermajority rule for papal elections at the Third Lateran Council in 1179.

In the Democratic Party of the United States, a rule requiring the determination of a presidential nominee by the votes of two-thirds of delegates to the Democratic National Convention was adopted at the party&#x27;s first presidential nominating convention in 1832. The two-thirds rule gave southern Democrats a &quot;de facto&quot; veto over any presidential nominee after the Civil War, which lasted until the rule was abolished in 1936.

In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison were critical of supermajority requirements. In Federalist 22, Hamilton wrote that while preventing harmful legislation from being passed, such requirements also prevented beneficial legislation from being passed, and &quot;its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.&quot; Hamilton also wrote that such a requirement would encourage &quot;contemptible compromises of the public good&quot;. In Federalist 58, Madison wrote that supermajority requirements might help impede the passage of &quot;hasty and partial measures&quot;, but &quot;[i]n all cases where justice or the general good might require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued, the fundamental principle of free government would be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would rule; the power would be transferred to the minority.&quot; Madison also wrote that such requirements would encourage secession.

==Common supermajorities==
A majority vote, or more than half the votes cast, is a common voting basis. Instead of the basis of a majority, a supermajority can be specified using any fraction or percentage which is greater than one-half. Common supermajorities include three-fifths (60%), two-thirds (66.666...%), and three-quarters (75%). In most cases, if the supermajority fraction or percentage of votes yields a non-whole number, it is rounded to the nearest whole number.

===Two-thirds===
A two-thirds vote, when unqualified, means two-thirds or more of the votes cast. This voting basis is equivalent to the number of votes in favor being at least twice the number of votes against. Abstentions and absences may be excluded when calculating a two-thirds vote.

The two-thirds requirement can be qualified to include the entire membership of a body instead of only those present and voting, but such a requirement must be explicitly stated (such as &quot;two-thirds of those members duly elected and sworn&quot;). In this case, abstentions and absences count as votes against the proposal. Alternatively, the voting requirement could be specified as &quot;two-thirds of those present&quot;, which has the effect of counting abstentions but not absences as votes against the proposal.

For example, if there are 100 eligible voters, 67 votes are required for a supermajority (two-thirds of 100, rounded). However, if two voters abstain or are absent, the total decreases to 98, and the required votes for a supermajority drops to 65 (two-thirds of 98, rounded).

===Three-fifths, or 60 percent===
Another type of supermajority is three-fifths (60 percent). This requirement could also be qualified to include the entire membership or to include those present.

In 2006, the Constitution of Florida was amended to require a 60% majority to pass new constitutional amendments by popular vote.

In Poland, the Sejm (lower house of the bicameral parliament of Poland) requires a three-fifths majority of MPs to overturn a veto from the President of Poland.

===55%===
For the Montenegrin independence referendum held in 2006 the European Union envoy Miroslav Lajčák proposed independence if a 55% supermajority of votes are cast in favor with a minimum turnout of 50%. Such procedure, ultimately accepted by the government of Montenegro, was somewhat criticized as overriding the traditional practice of requiring a two-thirds supermajority, as practiced in all former Yugoslav countries before (including the previous referendum in Montenegro). The requirement for 50% turnout has also been criticized for causing no-show paradoxes.

In 2016, the Constitution of Colorado was amended to require a 55% majority to pass new constitutional amendments by popular vote. It had previously been a simple majority.

==Use in parliamentary procedure==
Parliamentary procedure requires that any action that may alter the rights of a minority have a supermajority requirement. &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; states:
==Use in governments around the world==
===Australia===
To pass an amendment to the Australian Constitution, a referendum is required and must achieve a &quot;double majority&quot;: a majority of those voting nationwide, as well as separate majorities in a majority of states (i.e., 4 out of 6 states). Furthermore, in circumstances where a specific state is affected by a referendum, a majority of voters in that state must also agree to the change—referred to as a &quot;triple majority&quot;.

===Bangladesh===
Article 142 of the Constitution of Bangladesh stipulates a bill in the Jatiya Sangsad must expressly state in its short title its purpose is to amend a provision of the constitution. Constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority in the unicameral Jatiya Sangsad to become effective.

===Canada===
In Canada, most constitutional amendments can be passed only if identical resolutions are adopted by the House of Commons, the Senate and two-thirds or more of the provincial legislative assemblies representing at least 50 percent of the national population.

===Denmark===
Article 20 of the Constitution of Denmark states that if the government or parliament wants to cede parts of national sovereignty to an international body such as the European Union or the United Nations, it has to get a five-sixths majority in the Folketing (150 out of 179 seats). If there is only a simple majority, a referendum must be held on the subject.

===European Union===
====Council====
The Council of the European Union uses &#x27;Qualified majority voting&#x27; for the majority of issues brought before the institution. However, for matters of extreme importance for individual member states, unanimous voting is implemented. An example of this is Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, whereby a member state can have its rights suspended with the unanimous approval of all other member states.

After the accession of Croatia, on 1July 2013, at least 260 votes out of a total of 352 by at least 15 member states were required for legislation to be adopted by qualified majority. From 1July 2013, the pass condition translated into:
# At least 15 (or 18, if proposal was not made by the commission) countries,
# At least 260 of the total 352 voting weights,
# At least 313.6 million people represented by the states that vote in favour.

====Parliament====
Requirements to reach an absolute majority is a common feature of voting in the European Parliament (EP) where under the ordinary legislative procedure the EP is required to act by an absolute majority if it is to either amend or reject proposed legislation.

===Finland===
According to Finnish Law, when a new legislative proposal would in some way add, alter or remove a part of the Finnish constitution, a bill requires a 2/3 majority in the Parliament of Finland. In other words, a legislative proposal that would modify, add or remove a part of the Finnish Constitution requires at least the approval of 134 out of 200 representatives in the Parliament of Finland

===India===
Article 368 of the Indian Constitution requires a supermajority of two-thirds of members present and voting in each house of the Indian Parliament, subject to at least by a majority of the total membership of each House of Parliament, to amend the constitution. In addition, in matters affecting the states and judiciary, at least above half of all the states need to ratify the amendment.

===Italy===
The President of Italy is elected by an electoral college consisting of both chambers of Parliament sitting in joint session with 58 electors from the country&#x27;s 20 regions. In the first three rounds of voting, a candidate must get two-thirds of the votes to win, but from the fourth round onwards only an absolute majority is needed. Reforms to the Constitution need to achieve a supermajority of two-thirds of the votes both in the Chamber and in the Senate to avoid the possibility of being sent to popular vote in order to be confirmed through a referendum.

===Japan===
Amendments to the constitution require a two-thirds majority in both houses of the National Diet and a simple majority in a referendum.

===New Zealand===
Section 268 of the Electoral Act sets out a number of &#x27;reserved provisions&#x27;. These provisions include section 17(1) of the Constitution Act 1986 (regarding Parliament&#x27;s term length), section 35 of the Electoral Act (regarding the drawing of electoral boundaries), and section 74 of the Electoral Act (designating 18 as the minimum voting age). For a &#x27;reserved provision&#x27; to be amended or repealed, a three-quarters majority is required in the House of Representatives or a majority is needed in a national referendum.

===Nigeria===
Under the Constitution of Nigeria a two-thirds majority is required in the National Assembly to alter the Constitution, enact legislation in a few areas, or remove office holders from some positions, such as Speaker. Legislative override or impeachment of the executive at either the state or federal government level also requires a two-thirds majority of the corresponding legislative assembly.

===Philippines===
Under the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, a two-thirds majority of both chambers of the Congress of the Philippines (the House of Representatives and the Senate) meeting in joint session is required to declare war. A two-thirds majority of both chambers is required to override a presidential veto. A two-thirds vote of both chambers of Congress voting separately is required to designate the vice president as acting president in the event that a majority of the Cabinet certifies that the president is &quot;unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office&quot; but the president declares that no such inability exists. A two-thirds vote of either chamber is required to suspend or expel a member from that chamber.

Under the 1987 Constitution, &quot;The Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of all its Members, call a constitutional convention, or by a majority vote of all its Members, submit to the electorate the question of calling such a convention.&quot; A three-quarters vote of all the members of the Congress is required to propose an amendment to the Constitution; the proposed amendment is submitted to the people for ratification (by a majority of the votes cast) in a plebiscite.

A two-thirds majority of the Senate is required to ratify treaties, and to remove an impeached official from office. Impeachment by the House, which is the required first step in the removal process, only requires one-third of Representatives to sign a petition (specifically a verified complaint or resolution of impeachment).

===Singapore===

Different amendment procedures apply to different parts of the Constitution. Most of the Articles of the Constitution may be amended by a bill enacted by Parliament if there is at least a supermajority of two-thirds of all elected MPs voting in favour of the bill during its Second and Third Readings in Parliament. This is in contrast to ordinary bills, which only need to be approved by at least a simple majority of all the MPs present and voting.

However, the ruling People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) has commanded a majority of more than two-thirds of the seats in Parliament since 1968. Thus, the more stringent amendment requirement has not imposed any major limitation on Parliament&#x27;s ability to amend the Constitution.

===South Korea===
====Legislation====
A three-fifths majority of legislators is required for a bill to be put to a vote in the National Assembly in order to prevent the ruling party from passing laws without the support of opposition parties. However, if a bill does not achieve the required three-fifths majority at one session without also being rejected, it must then be voted on at the next session even if less than three-fifths of legislators agree to do so.

Additionally, if the President vetoes a bill, the veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority of legislators.

====Impeachment====
According to Article 65 of the Constitution of South Korea, impeachment of the President requires a two-third majority of legislators to be effective.

====Judicial review====
According to Article 113 of the Constitution of South Korea, the Constitutional Court requires a two-thirds majority of its judges to issue rulings nullifying laws, removing impeached officials or dissolving a political party.

====Constitutional amendments====
According to Article 130 of the Constitution of South Korea, amendments to the constitution must be passed by a two-thirds majority of legislators and then approved by voters at a referendum in order to become effective.

===Spain===
====Constitutional reform====
The 1978 Constitution states that a three-fifths majority in both Congress of Deputies and Senate of Spain is needed to pass a constitutional reform, but if a two-thirds majority is reached in the Congress of Deputies, an absolute majority of senators is enough to pass the proposal.

Nevertheless, when a new Constitution is proposed or the proposal&#x27;s goal is to reform the Preliminary Title, the Chapter on Fundamental Rights and Freedoms or the Title on the Crown, the supermajority becomes significantly harder:
* A supermajority of two-thirds must be reached in both Congress of Deputies and Senate.
* Both chambers must be dissolved.
* The new elected chambers must approve the proposal by a new two-thirds supermajority.
* Finally, the proposal is passed by majority in referendum.

The first way has been used twice (1992 and 2011), but the second has never been used.

====Other legal procedures====
The Spanish Constitution states other supermajorities:
* Members of the General Council of the Judiciary are appointed by the Congress of Deputies and Senate of Spain, and each appointment needs a three-fifths majority.
* Members of the Constitutional Court are also appointed by both Congress of Deputies and Senate of Spain, and each appointment needs a three-fifths majority.
* The president of the RTVE, the public radio and television broadcaster, must be elected by two-thirds majority of the Congress of Deputies.

====Autonomous communities====
Each Spanish autonomous community has its own Statute of Autonomy, working like a local constitution that is subject to the 1978 Constitution and national powers.

The Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands states that its economic and fiscal regime and electoral law need a two-thirds majority of the Parliament to be modified. On its behalf, the Ombudsman needs a three-fifths majority to be appointed. Also, if a two-thirds majority votes against a law project, it must be proposed to the following session.

===Taiwan===
Before the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 2005, the constitution amendments need to be passed by the National Assembly. Since the Additional Articles ratified on June 7, 2005, the National Assembly was abolished. Amendments of the constitution need to be proposed by more than one-quarter of members of the Legislative Yuan, passed by three-quarters of those present in the meeting, the presence of which must surpass three-quarters of all members of Legislative Yuan, then followed by approval by more than half (50%) of all eligible voters in referendums.

===Turkey===
In Turkey, constitutional amendments need a three fifths majority (360 votes) to be put forward to a referendum and a two-thirds majority (400 votes) to be ratified directly.

===Ukraine===

====Constitutional amendments====
According to Article 155 of the Constitution of Ukraine, amendments to the constitution, except for Chapter I — &quot;General Principles,&quot; Chapter III — &quot;Elections. Referendum&quot;, and Chapter XIII — &quot;Introducing Amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine&quot;, must be previously approved by a simple majority of the constitutional composition of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and then passed by a two-thirds majority of the constitutional composition of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine at the succeeding regular session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.

According to Article 156 of the Constitution of Ukraine, amendments to Chapter I — &quot;General Principles,&quot; Chapter III — &quot;Elections. Referendum&quot;, and Chapter XIII — &quot;Introducing Amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine&quot; must be passed by a two-thirds majority of the constitutional composition of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and then approved by voters at a referendum in order to become effective.

===United Kingdom===

====UK Parliament====
A rare example of a supermajority requirement affecting the Parliament of the United Kingdom is the need for a two-thirds supermajority vote in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords to amend or dissolve the Royal Charter on self-regulation of the press, insofar as it applies in England and Wales.

Before its repeal, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 provided that the United Kingdom House of Commons could be dissolved and an election held before the expiry of its 5-year term by a vote of two-thirds of the membership of the House of Commons. The Act also provided that Parliament could alternatively be dissolved if the House of Commons passed a motion of no-confidence in the government and no new government were to win a motion of confidence within two weeks of the original vote of no-confidence.

The two-thirds supermajority provision for an early dissolution and election was triggered only once, resulting in the 2017 United Kingdom General Election. The previous election in 2015 had occurred due to the natural expiry of the 5-year term of the House of Commons.

Parliamentary supremacy meant that theoretically the Act could be circumvented by a government with a majority that wanted to bypass the requirement for a two-thirds vote by passing an act that stated, &quot;Notwithstanding the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a general election will be called on DATE&quot;. This was precisely what was done to initiate the election in 2019, the final election held whilst the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was in effect.

During the 2019 election, both the governing Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party expressed a desire to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and restore the traditional, centuries-old system under which elections could be held at any time, subject to the 5-year maximum term limit established by the Parliament Act 1911. Such a repeal would only require a simple majority.

Ultimately, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, thereby removing any supermajority requirement and restoring the previous royal prerogative power to dissolve the House of Commons at any time during its 5-year term.

====Devolved parliaments====
The devolved legislatures in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all usually operate with fixed intervals between ordinary elections. However, the acts governing the operation of those legislatures all allow for an early election to take place if a motion to that effect is approved by two-thirds of the total number of members of the legislature in question.

Section 31A of the Scotland Act 1998 and Section 111A of the Government of Wales Act 2006 provide that certain provisions of those Acts relating to the functions of and elections to the respective Scottish and Welsh devolved legislatures are protected from amendment by those legislatures, unless a two-thirds supermajority of the total number of members votes in favour.

Regarding Scotland, the protected provisions are:
*Who may vote at Scottish Parliament elections
*The system of election for members of the Scottish Parliament
*The number of Scottish Parliament constituencies
*The number of members returned by each constituency

The protected provisions regarding Wales are the same as those in Scotland; in addition, there are two Wales-specific provisions:
*The name of the legislature
*The number of individuals permitted to be appointed Welsh Minister or Deputy Welsh Minister

A two-thirds supermajority vote is required in the Scottish Parliament in order to amend or dissolve the Royal Charter on self-regulation of the press, insofar as it applies in Scotland.

====Local authorities====
Local authorities in Wales are required to pass a resolution with a two-thirds supermajority vote in order to change the system by which they are elected, with the permitted choices being first-past-the-post and single transferable vote.

District councils in England are required to pass a resolution with a two-thirds supermajority vote in order to change their &#x27;electoral scheme,&#x27; i.e. what proportion of councillors is elected at each ordinary election, with permitted proportions being one-third, one-half or all councillors.

The London Assembly may, by a two-thirds supermajority vote, veto the mayor&#x27;s draft strategies.

===United Nations===
The United Nations Security Council requires a supermajority of the fixed membership on substantive matters (procedural matters require a simple majority of those present and voting). According to Article 27 of the United Nations Charter, at least nine of the Security Council&#x27;s 15 members (i.e., a three-fifths supermajority) must vote in favor of a draft resolution in order to achieve passage. Specifying the fixed membership has the effect of making abstentions count as votes against—absences are not normal but would be treated the same way.

This is useful for the five permanent members of the council (China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States) because a vote against from any one of them constitutes a veto, which cannot be overridden. Permanent members who do not support a measure but are unwilling to be seen to block it against the wishes of the majority of the council, tend to abstain; abstentions by veto powers are generally seen by close observers of the UN as the equivalent of not vetoing votes against and have the same impact on the decision of the Security Council.

===United States===
====Federal government====
The Constitution of the United States requires supermajorities for certain significant actions to occur.

Amendments to the Constitution may be proposed in one of two ways: a two-thirds supermajority votes of each body of United States Congress or a convention called by Congress on application of two-thirds (currently 34) of the states. Once proposed, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters (currently 38) of the states (either through the state legislatures, or ratification conventions, whichever &quot;mode of ratification&quot; Congress selects).

Congress may pass bills by simple majority votes. If the president vetoes a bill, Congress may override the veto by a two-thirds supermajority of both houses.

A treaty must be ratified by a two-thirds supermajority of the Senate to enter into force and effect.

Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution gives Congress a role to play in the event of a presidential disability. If the vice president and a majority of the president&#x27;s cabinet declare that the president is unable to serve in that role, the vice president becomes acting president. Within 21 days of such a declaration (or, if Congress is in recess when a president is disabled, 21 days after Congress reconvenes), Congress must vote by two-thirds supermajorities to continue the disability declaration; otherwise, such declaration expires after the 21 days and the president would at that time &quot;resume&quot; discharging all the powers and duties of the office. , Section 4 has never been invoked.

The House may, by a simple majority vote, impeach a federal official (such as, but not limited to, the president, vice president, or a federal judge). Removal from office requires a two-thirds supermajority of the Senate. In 1842, the House failed to impeach president John Tyler. In 1868, the Senate fell one vote short of removing president Andrew Johnson following his impeachment. In 1999, efforts to remove Bill Clinton following his impeachment in 1998 fell just short of a simple majority, and 17 votes short of the two-thirds supermajority. The impeachment procedure was last used in 2021, when president Donald Trump was impeached for a second time during his first term and subsequently acquitted. Each chamber may expel one of its own members by a two-thirds supermajority vote; this last happened when the House expelled George Santos in 2023.

The 14th Amendment (section 3) bars a person from federal or state office if, after having previously taken an oath to support the Constitution as a federal or state officer, &quot;shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof&quot;. However, both the House and Senate may jointly override this restriction with a two-thirds supermajority vote each.

A two-thirds supermajority in the Senate is 67 out of 100 senators, while a two-thirds supermajority in the House is 290 out of 435 representatives. However, since many votes take place without every seat in the House filled and representatives participating, it does not often require 67 senators or 290 representatives to achieve this supermajority.

Apart from these constitutional requirements, a Senate rule (except in cases covered by the nuclear option, or of a rule change) requires an absolute supermajority of three-fifths to move to a vote through a cloture motion, which closes debate on a bill or nomination, thus ending a filibuster by a minority of members. In current practice, the mere threat of a filibuster prevents passing almost any measure that has less than three-fifths agreement in the Senate, 60 of the 100 senators if every seat is filled.

====State government====
For state legislatures in the United States, &quot;Mason&#x27;s Manual&quot; says, &quot;A deliberative body cannot by its own act or rule require a two-thirds vote to take any action where the constitution or controlling authority requires only a majority vote. To require a two-thirds vote, for example, to take any action would be to give to any number more than one-third of the members the power to defeat the action and amount to a delegation of the powers of the body to a minority.&quot; Some states require a supermajority for passage of a constitutional amendment or statutory initiative.

Many state constitutions allow or require amendments to their own constitutions to be proposed by supermajorities of the state legislature; these amendments must usually be approved by the voters at one or more subsequent elections. Michigan, for instance, allows the Legislature to propose an amendment to the Michigan Constitution; it must then be ratified by the voters at the next general election (unless a special election is called).

In most states, the state legislature may override a governor&#x27;s veto of legislation. In most states, a two-thirds supermajority of both chambers is required. However, in some states (e.g., Illinois, Maryland and North Carolina), only a three-fifths supermajority is required, while in Kentucky and West Virginia only a normal majority is needed.

One common provision of so-called &quot;taxpayer bill of rights&quot; laws (either in state statutes or state constitutions) is requirement of a supermajority vote in the state legislature to increase taxes. The National Conference of State Legislatures reported in 2010 that fifteen states required a supermajority vote (either a three-fifths, two-thirds or three-quarters majority vote in both chambers) to pass some or all tax increases.

Supermajority requirements for tax increases have been criticized as &quot;deeply flawed&quot; by a report by the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities because such requirements empower a minority of legislators, making it difficult to close tax loopholes or fund transportation infrastructure, and also may encourage pork-barrel spending as a trade-off to ensure passage of a tax increase (see logrolling).

<text>The postmaster general of Canada was the Canadian cabinet minister responsible for the Post Office Department (Canada Post). In 1851, management of the post office was transferred from Britain (Royal Mail) to the provincial governments of the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The position of Postmaster General was established in each province. With Canadian Confederation in 1867, a single position was created replacing this post in all of the above provinces except Newfoundland; this position was abolished in 1981 when the post office was transformed from a government department into a crown corporation. Since 1981 Canada Post has been led by a President and CEO. From 1900 until 1909 the Postmaster General was also responsible for the Department of Labour. It now reports to the Minister of Public Services and Procurement.

Canada Post Corporation has had its own CEO and President since 1981, who has most of the administrative responsibilities previously exercised by the Postmaster General. With the abolition of the position of Postmaster General the legislative and certain other duties previously exercised by the Postmaster General were transferred to the new position of Minister responsible for Canada Post Corporation.

<text>Discipline in BDSM is the practice in which the dominant sets rules which the submissive is expected to obey. When rules of expected behaviour are broken, punishment is often used as a means of disciplining.

==Punishment==
In BDSM, rules can be made so that a submissive (&quot;sub&quot;) knows how they should behave in order not to displease the dominant. Rules are usually set and agreed upon by the dominant and the submissive before the beginning of any BDSM scene and/or situation, and can also be used to help make the sub feel inferior, or for &quot;training&quot; a novice sub, though such is not always the case and rules can be set by the dominant for reasons both pertaining to the scene (such as fear play) and/or reasons outside of the constructed world of BDSM. When the rules are broken, even accidentally, punishment is often used as a means of discipline. Punishment itself can be physical (e.g. whipping or piercing) or psychological (e.g. erotic humiliation through public nudity or golden showers) or a combination of both (e.g. through predicament bondage).

The goal of discipline is to &quot;teach&quot; (in the context of the BDSM scene, and only as such to make the sub feel inferior by playing as if they are being taught &quot;how to behave&quot; like a child or animal, and such is pretended, as BDSM is sexual play and does not pertain or adhere to reality) the sub how they should behave as well as the consequences that may arise as a result of breaking the rules of behavior. When subs receive punishment for breaking the set rules, they &quot;learn&quot; (again in the context of sexual play) self-restraint and become &quot;better&quot; subs. The punishment is usually, but not always, related to the mistake, and is also usually proportionate to the severity and frequency of the mistake. For example, a punishment for speaking out of turn for the first time may be a simple restraint (such as being silenced using a gag). Similarly, the punishment for a male sub&#x27;s penis becoming erect despite not being allowed, even if unintentionally, can be a chastity cage.

The sub may also be given the option of choosing his/her own punishment. For example, for a minor mistake made repeatedly, the punishment can be an option either to be caned a few times (physical punishment) or to be paraded nude in public with a pet animal leash (mental punishment). For a major indiscipline by a female sub, the choice can be between breast torture and pussy torture. For a major indiscipline by a male sub, the choice may be the instrument type to be used (e.g. whip or cane) and the body part to be punished (e.g. back or buttocks) with a number of hard strokes.

Punishments carried out on BDSM submissives, even harsh ones involving severe pain, should not be confused with those carried out in sadomasochism, though similar. S&amp;M involves giving pain/torture to a &quot;sub&quot; for the sake of the physical pleasure of the &quot;sub&quot; and/or &quot;dom&quot;. In BDSM discipline, punishments given are meant to derive pleasure from the psychological aspect of being inferior, by having to be &quot;taught&quot; and punished like a child or animal, as well as the vulnerability, rejection, and humiliation the &quot;sub&quot; may feel when being punished, and the humility and vulnerability the &quot;sub&quot; may feel after &quot;learning&quot; to overcome their feelings of inferiority and reconcile with the dominant by apologizing and emotionally accepting the punishment for their perceived wrong. One thing the two activities have in common is that there are limits and safewords in both. 

Punishments in BDSM are carried out with the consent of both the dominant and the submissive. Such punishments carried out are agreed upon, set up, and talked about before the beginning of a BDSM scene or the signing of any BDSM &quot;slave contract&quot;, and the misbehavior of the submissive is also usually predetermined before the activity begins. BDSM is sexual play, and such punishments are not carried out in a real world context, as said before, in that BDSM activities are predetermined, the scenes are made up, and none of it is carried out due to any real misbehavior of the submissive to any actual, real rule. There are &quot;rules&quot; separate from the BDSM scene, such as the safeword being used to signal an unwillingness to continue, and not doing a specific activity, which makes one uncomfortable, and then there are rules in the context of the play which are set to be broken and punished, these are the &quot;play rules&quot;. Punishment should also not be confused with BDSM training which may involve giving pain simply in order to increase the endurance limit of the sub. Sometimes, disciplining may avoid punishment altogether, and instead a hard glance or loud voice from the dominant may be effective. 

In addition to punishment, disciplining may also involve positive reinforcement. This involves rewarding the sub for good behaviour (e.g. being allowed to sleep on a bed rather than a hard floor).

<doc id="638327" wikidata="Q1816155" url="?curid=638327" title="Peshwa">
<text>The Peshwa was the second highest office in the Maratha Confederacy, next in rank and prestige only to that of the Chhatrapati. Initially serving as the appointed prime minister in the Maratha Kingdom, the office became hereditary when Shahu gave the seat of Peshwa to Bajirao Ballal. During the reign of Shahu, the office of Peshwa grew in power and the Peshwas came to be the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of the Maratha Confederacy. Eventually, the Chhatrapati title became titular and the main heads were the Peshwas according to the Sangola pact. 

All Peshwas during the rule of Shivaji, Sambhaji and Rajaram belonged to Marathi Chitpavan Brahmin community. The first Peshwa was Moropant Pingle, who was appointed as the head of the Ashta Pradhan (council of eight ministers) by Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Kingdom. The initial Peshwas were all ministers who served as the chief executives to the king. The later Peshwas held the highest administrative office and also controlled the Maratha confederacy. Under the Bhat family, the Peshwas became the &quot;de facto&quot; hereditary administrators of the Confederacy. The Peshwa&#x27;s office was most powerful under Baji Rao I (r. 1720–1740). Under Peshwa administration and with the support of several key generals and diplomats, the Maratha Confederacy reached its zenith, ruling major areas of India. The subsequent Peshwas brought in autonomy and as a result later on many states were controlled and administered by the Maratha chiefs such as Scindias and Gaekwads.

In 1760, the peace of Peshwa government was broken by a rising of Kolis under their Naik Javji Bamble. Javji withdrew to the hills and organised a series of gang robberies, causing widespread terror and misery throughout the country. For twenty years he held out bravely, defeating and killing the generals the Peshwa&#x27;s Government sent against him. At last he was so hotly pursued that, on the advice of Dhondo Gopal, the Peshwa&#x27;s governor at Nasik, he surrendered all his forts to Tukoji Holkar and, through Holkar&#x27;s influence, was pardoned and placed in military and police charge of a district of sixty villages with powers of life and death outlaws. In 1798, a fresh disturbance took place among the Kolis. The leader of this outbreak was Ramji Naik Bhangria, who was an abler and more daring man than his predecessors, and succeeded in baffling all the efforts of the Government officers to seize him. As force seemed hopeless, the Government offered Ramji a pardon and gave him an important police post.

==First use==

The word Peshwa is from Persian &quot;pēshwā&quot;, meaning &quot;foremost, leader&quot;. The term was inherited from the political vocabulary of previous Persianate empires operating in the Deccan. As early as 1397, the Bahmani Sultanate designated its prime minister as &quot;peshwa&quot;. In the 16th and 17th centuries, this practice was continued by the Ahmednagar Sultanate and the Bijapur Sultanate, both successor states of the Bahmani Sultanate. After the coronation of Shivaji in 1674, he appointed Moropant Trimbak Pingle as his first Peshwa. Shivaji renamed this designation as &quot;Pantpradhan&quot; in 1674 but this term was less commonly used. Moropant Trimbak Pingale&#x27;s son, Nilopant Moreshvar Pingale, succeeded him during Sambhaji&#x27;s rule after Moropant Pingle&#x27;s death in 1683.

==Ramchandra Pant Amatya (Bawadekar)==

Ramchandra Amatya recaptured many forts from the Mughals between 1690 and 1694, some in person, as well as personally conducting guerilla war techniques. When Rajaram I fled to Jinji in 1689, before leaving Maharashtra, he gave &quot;Hukumat panha&quot; (King Status) to Pant. Ramchandra Pant managed the entire state under many challenges such as the Mughal influx, the betrayal of Vatandars, and scarcity of food. With his help, Sachiv kept the Maratha State on a sound economic footing.

==Bhat Family==

The Maratha war of succession between Tara Bai and Shahu resulted in latter&#x27;s victory and assumption of Maratha throne as Chhatrapati. In 1713, Shahu appointed Balaji Vishwanath (Bhat), as Peshwa. The appointment of Balaji&#x27;s son, Baji Rao I, as Peshwa in 1719 by Shahu made the position hereditary in the Bhat family. Baji Rao proved his loyalty by controlling the feudal chieftains who wanted independence from the Maratha Empire. The rebellion of General Trimbak Rao Dabhade, the &quot;senapati&quot; (commander in chief), over Chauthai (revenue collection) of Gujarat is one example of such internal Maratha feuds. The followers of Baji and Trimbak clashed at the Battle of Bilhapur on 1 April 1731, and Trimbak was killed. In gratitude, Shahu gave the Peshwas and the Bhat family unchallenged control over Maratha empire. who also appointed Baji Rao&#x27;s son as Peshwa in 1740, gave considerable authority to the Peshwas to command the Maratha armies, and they responded well during his reigns.

At the time of his death in 1749, Shahu made the Peshwas his successors under these conditions: Shivaji&#x27;s descendants, who remained as the titular Raja of Satara, were called &quot;Swami&quot; (Marathi for the &#x27;real owner&#x27;) by the Peshwas who reported to them, and officially they were to seek guidance from the Raja. 

==Legacy==
The first Peshwa to receive the status of a pantpradhan was Ramchandra Pant Amatya Bawdekar in 1689 by Rajaram. The first (Bhat) Deshmukh family Peshwa was Balaji Vishwanath (Bhat) Deshmukh. He was succeeded as Peshwa by his son Baji Rao I, who never lost a battle. Baji Rao and his son, Balaji Baji Rao, oversaw the period of greatest Maratha expansion, brought to an end by the Marathas&#x27; defeat by an Afghan army at the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761. The last Peshwa, Baji Rao II, was defeated by the British East India Company in the Battle of Khadki which was a part of Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–1818). The Peshwa&#x27;s land (Peshwai) was annexed to the British East India Company&#x27;s Bombay province, and Bajirao II, the Peshwa was pensioned off.

<text>Bar-le-Duc (), formerly known as Bar, is a commune in the Meuse département, of which it is the capital. The department is in Grand Est in northeastern France.

The lower, more modern and busier part of the town extends along a narrow valley, shut in by wooded or vine-clad hills, and is traversed by the Ornain, which is crossed by several bridges. It is bordered on the north-east by the Marne–Rhine Canal and on the south-west by a small arm of the Ornain called the &quot;Canal des Usines&quot;, on the left bank of which the upper town (&quot;Ville Haute&quot;) is situated.
The highly rarefied Bar-le-duc jelly, also known as Lorraine jelly, is a spreadable preparation of white currant or red currant fruit preserves. First mentioned in the historical record in 1344, it is also colloquially referred to as &quot;Bar caviar&quot;.

==History==
Bar-le-Duc was at one time the seat of the county, from 1354 the Duchy of Bar. 
Though probably of ancient origin, the town was unimportant until the 10th century when it was fortified by Frederick I of Upper Lorraine. 
Bar was an independent duchy from 1354 to 1480, when it was acquired by Duchy of Lorraine.

The &quot;Ville Haute&quot;, which is reached by steps and steep narrow thoroughfares, is intersected by a long, quiet street, bordered by houses of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. In this quarter are the remains (16th-century) of the château of the dukes of Bar, dismantled in 1670, the old clock-tower and the college, built in the latter half of the 16th century. The church of Saint-Étienne (constructed during the 14th and 15th centuries) contains the Cadaver Tomb of René of Chalon, a skilfully carved effigy in white stone of a half-decayed corpse. It was erected to the memory of René of Châlon (died 1544) and is the work of 16th-century artist Ligier Richier, a pupil of Michelangelo.

The lower town contains the official buildings and the churches of Notre-Dame, the most ancient in the town, and St Antony, with 14th-century frescoes. Among the statues of distinguished natives of the town is one of Nicolas Oudinot, whose house serves as the &quot;hôtel-de-ville&quot;. Other sights include Notre-Dame Bridge, with five arches surmounted by a chapel in the middle.

Bar-le-Duc served as the assembly point for essential supplies going to the besieged city of Verdun during the Battle of Verdun in 1916. Thousands of trucks, carrying men, equipment and food, travelled north, around the clock, on the road linking Bar-le-Duc to Verdun. The route was given the name Voie Sacrée (Sacred Way) by the writer and politician Maurice Barres in April 1916, a reference to the ancient Roman &quot;Sacra Via&quot;, leading to triumph.

In 2023, it served as the end location of the seventh season of the travel based competition “Jet Lag: The Game”.

<doc id="638329" wikidata="Q1869110" url="?curid=638329" title="London and Blackwall Railway">
<text>Originally called the Commercial Railway, the London and Blackwall Railway (L&amp;BR) in east London, England, ran from Minories to Blackwall via Stepney, with a branch line to the Isle of Dogs, connecting central London to many of London&#x27;s docks. It was operational from 1840 until 1926 (for passengers) and 1968 (for goods), closing after the decline of inner London&#x27;s docks. Much of its infrastructure was reused as part of the Docklands Light Railway. The L&amp;BR was leased by the Great Eastern Railway in 1866, but remained independent until absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway at the 1923 Grouping. Another branch was opened in 1871, the Millwall Extension Railway.

==History==


It was authorised by an act of Parliament, the (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. cxxiii), entitled &quot;An Act for making a Railway from the Minories to Blackwall, with Branches, to be called &quot;The Commercial Railway&quot;&quot; dated 28 July 1836 in the reign of William IV. The length of the railway was to be .

The engineer of the line was intended to be John Rennie, but the project&#x27;s City financiers favoured Robert Stephenson, believing that they would also benefit from the knowledge and wisdom of his respected father George. Although, because of the terms of the act of Parliament, Robert Stephenson had to follow Rennie&#x27;s route and use the obscure track gauge of , he was free to choose his own method of propulsion. Drawing on his experience with the Camden Incline on the London and Birmingham Railway he decided upon cable haulage from stationary steam engines.

The railway was on brick arches as far as the West India Docks, and then on an embankment before entering a shallow cutting near the Blackwall terminus at Brunswick Wharf. The station there had an iron-roofed shed, and offices designed in an Italianate style by William Tite.

The line opened on 6 July 1840, and the company changed its name to the &quot;London and Blackwall Railway&quot; on completion of an extension to Fenchurch Street, just within the City boundary, in 1841. The line was converted to use steam locomotives in 1848, partly because wear on the rope proved greater than anticipated (a steel-wire replacement had been tried but this twisted and kinked ferociously) and partly in consequence of the intended 1849 extensions. 

A line from Stepney (now Limehouse) linking it with the Eastern Counties Railway at Bow was opened in 1849, known as the London and Blackwall Extension Railway (LBER), at which time the line was converted to steam locomotive operation and the track converted to . Agreement between the L&amp;BR and the ECR about operation of the services over the LBER could not be reached so the actual junction was not completed. An interchange station called Victoria Park &amp; Bow was opened but the ECR stopped few services there so most services terminated at Bromley and Bow. Services were withdrawn from Victoria Park &amp; Bow on 6 January 1851.

By 1854 relations between the two companies had improved and the junction between the two lines was built and the LBER became part of the initial London Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) route to Fenchurch Street and the ECR started operating trains from Loughton into Fenchurch Street.

The LBER was joined to the new LTSR direct line from Barking at Gas Factory Junction in 1858.

In 1852 the North London Railway had linked up with the L&amp;BR at Poplar, and Fenchurch Street became the terminus for that line until Broad Street opened in 1865. In 1871 another branch line, the Millwall Extension Railway, opened from Millwall Junction to Millwall Docks to serve the West India Docks better. A year later the line was extended to North Greenwich, near the site of the original Island Gardens DLR station.

===Withdrawal of services===
In 1893 the Fenchurch Street–Stepney line was widened to four tracks, but by the turn of the century traffic to Blackwall and the Isle of Dogs was dropping. To save money railmotors acquired from the Great Western Railway were introduced in 1922, but nonetheless passenger services east of Stepney to North Greenwich and Blackwall were ceased on 3 May 1926 as a result of competition from trams.

John Betjeman (1906–1984), in his book &quot;First and Last Loves&quot; (published 1952), wrote of a journey on the L&amp;BR (most likely in the years just before closure):
Those frequent and quite empty trains of the Blackwall Railway ran from a special platform at Fenchurch Street. I remember them. Like stagecoaches they rumbled past East End chimney pots, wharves and shipping stopping at empty black stations till they came to a final halt at Blackwall station...When one emerged there, there was nothing to see beyond it but a cobbled quay and a vast stretch of wind whipped water...

The minor stations at Leman Street and Shadwell were closed in 1941 as wartime economy measures (as was Burdett Road opened on the Bow extension route in 1871). The junction at Stepney was disconnected in 1951, so that the only remaining access to the Blackwall Branch was from the LBER via the Limehouse Curve, and this was abandoned in 1963 (last train ran 5 November 1962). Access for occasional goods services to Blackwall and North Greenwich via the North London Railway at Poplar continued until 1968, but with the closure of the docks the line was abandoned, leaving only the Fenchurch Street–Stepney section of the original Blackwall branch still in use.

When the Docklands Light Railway opened in 1987, it reused much of the L&amp;BR line between Minories (renamed Tower Gateway) and Westferry Road. Part of the viaduct at North Greenwich for the line to the original terminus between Mudchute and Island Gardens DLR stations was used, though some of this section became disused again when the extension to was constructed and those stations replaced with ones nearby but below ground.

==Cable haulage==

As built the line was long, with two bidirectional tracks operated independently of each other. At the opening only one track was complete and the other was not brought into use until one month later. Each track had a double length of hemp rope, as an engine was winding in from one end an equivalent length of rope was being paid out at the other. Fourteen miles of rope, with metal swivels inserted at intervals to resist entanglements, were therefore required. 

On journeys from the terminus cars were dispatched in two groups: the first group of four cars for the three most distant stations (the terminus stations, as the most important, received two cars per trip) and the second group destined for the three nearest. Each rearmost car was released (&quot;slipped&quot;) as the convoy passed through its destination station. When the extension to Fenchurch Street was brought into use the pair of cars for that station was slipped from the rope at Minories as before, but the brakes were not applied. Momentum carried them up the slight slope to the new platforms. &quot;Slipping&quot; and &quot;pinning&quot; (attaching) was controlled from an open platform at whichever end of a car was leading, using levers connected to iron grips (acting vertically against blocks beneath the carriage floor). The carriages were joined by link-and-pin couplings and the pin was withdrawn as each carriage was released. First and second class accommodation was provided; seats were not thought necessary in second class because of the short journey times.

It was clearly dangerous to use the reverse method to pick up cars on journeys &quot;to&quot; the terminus, so all the cars were &quot;pinned&quot; to the cable at their respective stations and started simultaneously with the convoy departing from the terminus, the timing coordinated by an early example of the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph. They arrived at the terminus at intervals and a new train gradually assembled itself, with the pair of cars from the far terminus becoming the lead pair for the return trip. The timetable was simply one train every 15 minutes.

Power was provided by eight marine steam engines from Maudslay, Sons and Field, providing for four in use and four in maintenance. The Minories winding house had four at but the engines at Blackwall were only at as the overall gradient of the line fell from the west, where it was built on brick arches, to the east.

The line was converted to use steam locomotives in 1848, partly because wear on the rope proved greater than anticipated (a steel-wire replacement had been tried but this twisted and kinked ferociously) and partly in consequence of the intended 1849 extensions. A light roof over the line was provided where it passed near to timber stores or shipping, because of the anticipated fire risk from locomotive sparks. It then became possible to travel directly between intermediate stations, without a detour by way of a terminus.

==Stations==
The stations were:

Branch to Bow from Stepney, called the London and Blackwall Extension Railway (opened 1849, joint-operated with the Eastern Counties Railway):

*Burdett Road (opened 1871, closed 1941)
* Bromley and Bow (1849–1850)
*Bow Road first station (1876–1892) then closed and replaced by second station to provide interchange with Bow (North London Railway station) and on site of original Bromley and Bow station (opened 1892, closed 1949)

<text>During World War II some 70,000 Finnish children (, the &#x27;war children&#x27; ) were evacuated from Finland, chiefly to Sweden, but also to Norway and Denmark. Most were evacuated during the Continuation War (1941–1944) to ease the situation for their parents who set out to rebuild their homes in the re-conquered Karelia returning from the 1940 evacuation of Finnish Karelia. The first surge of evacuees arrived, however, during the Winter War when the Finns had reasons to fear a humanitarian catastrophe following the expected Soviet occupation.

== Effects ==
In retrospect, the evacuation has been considered psychologically flawed, as the separations turned out to inflict a far greater damage on the evacuees than the damage suffered by those children who had remained with their parents in Finland. In comparison to Finland&#x27;s approximately 23,000 military deaths in the Winter War, the 66,000 in the Continuation War, and the total of 2,000 civilian deaths – and the roughly equally many seriously wounded – the war children were, of course, not physically injured, let alone killed. However, their number is of about the same size as that of the war invalids, and many of them feel their sufferings to be ignored.

== Fate ==
After the war, Finland experienced times of economic hardship, and also substantial insecurity with regard to the Soviet Union&#x27;s plans for Finland, which resulted in the delay of the return of the children for several years. Ultimately, about 20% of the war children stayed with their foster families after the war, who often adopted them. Many more returned to Sweden as adults, when the prolonged post-war hardship in Finland pushed large contingents of unemployed Finns to Sweden&#x27;s booming economy in the 1950s–60s.

== 2005 film – &quot;Mother of Mine&quot; ==
&quot;Mother of Mine&quot; (Finnish: &quot;Äideistä parhain&quot;, Swedish: &quot;Den bästa av mödrar&quot;) is a 2005 Finnish-Swedish film directed by Klaus Härö about a Finnish war child who is sent by his mother to live in Sweden during World War II. The film is based on a novel by Heikki Hietamies. It received good reviews from the Finnish press, and was selected as Finland&#x27;s submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards.

== Notable people ==
Notable people who, as a child, were evacuated from Finland to Sweden during World War II:
* Jean Cronstedt (born 1932), Swedish gymnast
* Toini Gustafsson (born 1938), Swedish cross-country skier
* Pentti Kaskipuro (1930–2010), Finnish artist
* Laila Kinnunen (1939–2000), Finnish singer
* Pertti Ylermi Lindgren (1936–2015), Finnish confidence trickster, actor and entertainer
* Frej Lindqvist (born 1937), Swedish actor
* Carita Nyström (1940–2019), Finnish writer, poet, journalist and feminist
* Pentti Saarikoski (1937–1983), Finnish poet

<doc id="638332" wikidata="Q595257" url="?curid=638332" title="Kate Adie">
<text>Kathryn Adie (born 19 September 1945) is an English journalist. She was Chief News Correspondent for BBC News between 1989 and 2003, during which time she reported from war zones around the world.

She retired from the BBC in early 2003 and works as a freelance presenter with &quot;From Our Own Correspondent&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

==Early life==

Adie was born in Whitley Bay, Northumberland. She was adopted as a baby by a Sunderland pharmacist and his wife, John and Maud Adie, and grew up there. Her birth parents were Irish Catholics and she made contact with her birth family in 1993, establishing a loving relationship lasting more than 20 years with her birth mother &#x27;Babe&#x27; Dunnet. She failed to trace her birth father John Kelly, or his family from Waterford, despite public appeals, she knows only that he had a brother (her blood uncle) Michael.

She had an independent school education at Sunderland Church High School, and in 1963-1964 travelled to Berlin including the Soviet Sector of East Berlin to complete a German language course. She obtained her degree at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, in Swedish and Icelandic studies. At university she got to know the BBC presenter Marian Foster, who was president of the Gilbert and Sullivan society in which Adie performed several times.

During her third year at Newcastle, she also taught English in sub-arctic northern Sweden.

==Career==
===Radio===
Her career with the BBC began, after graduation, as a station assistant at BBC Radio Durham. From 1971 to 1975 she was at Radio Bristol, where she presented &#x27;Womanwise&#x27; on Fridays at 11am.

===Television===
By 1977, she was a BBC South news reporter based in Plymouth and Southampton, before her move to BBC national television news in 1979. She was the duty reporter one evening in May 1980 and first on the scene when the Special Air Service (SAS) went in to break up the Iranian Embassy siege. As smoke bombs exploded in the background and SAS soldiers abseiled in to rescue the hostages, Adie reported live and unscripted to one of the largest news audiences ever while crouched behind a car door. This proved to be her big break. Adie reported extensively for BBC News, including from the north London crime scenes of serial killer Dennis Nilsen, in 1983.

Adie was thereafter regularly dispatched to report on disasters and conflicts throughout the 1980s, including The Troubles in Northern Ireland, the American bombing of Tripoli in 1986 (her reporting of which was criticised by the Conservative Party Chairman Norman Tebbit), and the Lockerbie bombing of 1988. She was promoted to Chief News Correspondent in 1989 and held the role for fourteen years.

One of her most significant assignments was to report the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. She was reportedly injured after being grazed by a bullet which had &quot;shaved the skin off her arm&quot;, as she ran through Tiananmen Square at the height of the protests. Nearly thirty years later, she said that she and her team were the only crew out in the square, and so were able to witness &quot;the massacre by the Chinese army of its own citizens in Beijing in 1989&quot;, which had never been acknowledged by the government nor reported in China. She said, &quot;... at least we were there and we have the evidence of what they did. They would love to erase it from history&quot;. Adie famously had a public disagreement with fellow British journalist John Simpson, who reportedly had accused her of falsifying her reports on Tiananmen Square.

Major assignments followed in the Gulf War, the war in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the 1994 Rwandan genocide and the war in Sierra Leone in 2000. Her trademark assignment look became flak jacket and pearl earrings.

In Libya she met leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. She was also shot by a drunk and irate Libyan army commander after refusing, as a journalist, to act as an intermediary between the British and Libyan governments; the bullet, fired at point-blank range, nicked her collar bone but she did not suffer permanent harm.

While she was in Yugoslavia, her leg was injured in Bosnia and she met Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić.

A newspaper cartoon features two soldiers, one with a tattered flag &quot;To Iraq&quot; on the barrel of his machine gun, and the caption &quot;We can&#x27;t start yet... Kate Adie isn&#x27;t here.&quot; Her insistence upon being on the spot elicited the wry adage that &quot;a good decision is getting on a plane at an airport where Kate Adie is getting off&quot;.

In 2003 Adie retired from the BBC, where she had been Chief News Correspondent. She subsequently worked as a freelance journalist, where among other work she gives regular reports on Radio New Zealand, as a public speaker, as well as participating in many of the 500 iPlayer episodes of &quot;From Our Own Correspondent&quot; on BBC Radio 4. She hosted two five-part series of &quot;Found&quot;, a Leopard Films production for BBC One, in 2005 and 2006. The series considered the life experiences of adults affected by adoption and what it must be like to start one&#x27;s life as a foundling.

In 2017 she was one of the speakers at the Gibraltar International Literary Festival.

After being appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours, Adie warned the public that journalism was under attack:

Adie was appointed Chancellor of Bournemouth University on 7 January 2019, succeeding Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers. In her address, she warned postgraduate journalism students that confirming information and verifying news sources was critical in the current climate of fake news. She stressed the importance of personally verifying news sources. &quot;Getting your person there is an absolutely standard lesson... news is not news without verification. ...If you only have the station cat to send, send them!&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Adie&#x27;s role as a BBC television journalist covering the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege in Princes Gate, central London, is included in &quot;6 Days&quot;. The role was played by actress Abbie Cornish.

The satirical British puppet TV show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; depicted Adie as a thrill seeker giving her the title &quot;BBC Head of Bravery&quot; and featuring her puppet in dangerous situations.

Adie is mentioned in the TV series Gavin and Stacey having a confrontation with Stacey’s best friend Nessa.

Their first single, &quot;West Seattle Acid Party&quot;, came out in 1992; after several album releases on indie label Scooch Pooch Records, they signed with Epitaph in 1998. They are currently signed to Relapse Records. They are featured in several soundtracks from video games such as the song &quot;Death Alley&quot; was on &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;, the song &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;&quot; appeared on &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot;, and &quot;Kill the King&quot; appeared on &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Project 8&quot;.

<text>The Hindenburg is a 1975 American Technicolor disaster film based on the 1937 Hindenburg disaster. The film stars George C. Scott. It was produced and directed by Robert Wise, and was written by Nelson Gidding, Richard Levinson and William Link, based on the 1972 book of the same name by Michael M. Mooney.

A highly speculative thriller, the film and the book on which it is based depict a conspiracy involving sabotage, which leads to the destruction of the German airship &quot;Hindenburg&quot;. In reality, while the Zeppelins were certainly used as propaganda symbols by Nazi Germany, and anti-Nazi forces may have been motivated to sabotage them, the possibility of such an act was investigated at the time; ultimately, no firm evidence was uncovered to substantiate the theory. A. A. Hoehling, author of the 1962 book &quot;Who Destroyed the Hindenburg?&quot;, also about the sabotage theory, sued Mooney along with the film developers for copyright infringement as well as unfair competition. However, Judge Charles M. Metzner dismissed his allegations.

Filmed largely in color (with a mock newsreel presented in black-and-white at the beginning of the film), a portion of the film is presented in monochrome, edited between portions of the historical &quot;Hindenburg&quot; newsreel footage shot on May 6, 1937.

==Plot==
Kathie Rauch from Milwaukee, Wisconsin sends a letter to the German Embassy in Washington, D.C., claiming the German zeppelin &quot;Hindenburg&quot; will explode while flying over New York City during its first flight of the season. In the meantime, Luftwaffe Colonel Franz Ritter has been named the security officer to protect the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; as various threats have been made to sabotage the airship, which some see as a symbol of Nazi Germany.

Ritter is assisted by a Nazi government official, SS/Gestapo Hauptsturmführer Martin Vogel, who poses as the &quot;official photographer&quot; aboard the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;. However, both operate independently in investigating the background of all passengers and crew on the voyage. Ritter has reason to suspect everyone, even his old friend, Countess Ursula von Reugen, whose Baltic estate in Peenemünde had been taken over by the Nazis for weapons testing and appears to be escaping Germany while visiting her young hearing-impaired daughter in Boston.

Other prime suspects include Edward Douglas, a suspicious German-American advertising executive, card sharps Emilio Pajetta and Major Napier, as well as several crew members and even the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; captains Max Pruss and Ernst Lehmann. Many possible clues turn out to be red herrings, such as Joe Spah sketching the ship&#x27;s interior as an idea for a vaudeville show and mysterious names which later turned out to be the name of race horses two of the passengers are making bets on. Two other code names, for carnivorous air and sea animals, turn out to refer to the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; itself and the , where Douglas&#x27;s competitor is in a race to beat him to port to secure a business deal in New York.

As the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; continues to Lakehurst Naval Air Station, events conspire against Ritter and Vogel. They soon suspect crewman Karl Boerth, a former Hitler Youth leader who has become disillusioned with the Nazi regime. Ritter attempts to arrest Boerth but he resists and requests help from Ritter, who sympathizes with him because Ritter&#x27;s son was killed in an accident the previous year while in the Hitler Youth. Ritter later receives news that Boerth&#x27;s girlfriend, Freda Halle, was killed while trying to escape the Gestapo, who had arrested her for questioning after she was seen asking too many pointed questions about the ship&#x27;s exact position and arrival time at Lakehurst. Boerth, upon hearing the news of Halle&#x27;s death, plans to commit suicide by staying aboard the airship as the bomb goes off, to show that there is a resistance against the Nazi regime. Ritter reluctantly agrees with Boerth to set the bomb to 7:30, when the airship should have landed and passengers disembarked, saying an explosion which kills passengers is the &quot;last thing he wants&quot;.

While setting up the bomb, Boerth drops his knife which is recovered by a crew member. To cover up the loss of the knife, Boerth steals a knife from fellow rigger Ludwig Knorr. Vogel starts to work behind Ritter&#x27;s back, arresting Boerth and confiscating the Countess&#x27;s passport.

As the airship approaches Lakehurst Naval Air Station, Ritter, now realizing the landing will be delayed, frantically searches for Boerth to find out where the bomb is hidden. Ritter discovers Vogel in the cargo bay torturing Boerth; Ritter fights with Vogel, knocking him unconscious. An injured Boerth tells Ritter the bomb is in the repair patch of gas cell 4. Ritter attempts to defuse the bomb, but is distracted by a now-awakened Vogel and is unable to do so in time. The bomb explodes, killing Ritter instantly and sending Vogel flying down the catwalk. Vogel survives, being carried by ground crewmen. Boerth was injured from being tortured by Vogel and dies of his burns, but manages to set the Channings&#x27; Dalmatian dog free before the airship crashes to the ground. The Countess survives and is reunited with her daughter.

The following day, while newsreel footage of the wreckage is shown, a narrator lists some of the survivors and casualties of the disaster, as well as some of the possible theories. The wreckage is examined for the inquiry before being cleaned up. As Herbert Morrison&#x27;s memorable radio commentary is played, the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; is seen flying once again, only to disappear again in the clouds as the credits roll.

==Characters==
* Colonel Franz Ritter — A Luftwaffe Colonel assigned by Joseph Goebbels to board the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; as a security officer in response to the bomb threat. Ritter won the Knight&#x27;s Cross as the chief of intelligence during the Bombing of Guernica. His son Alfred was in the Hitler Youth and died the previous year falling from a synagogue after vandalizing it with slogans. In early versions of the screenplay, the character was known as &quot;Fritz Kessler.&quot; Ritter is based upon Colonel Fritz Erdmann who was aboard the final flight, though there is no evidence that he nor the other two Luftwaffe officers were aboard as a security officer to investigate a bomb threat.
* Ursula von Reugen — Ursula is a Baltic German countess and old friend of Ritter, who lived in her estate in Peenemünde. After it had been taken over by the Nazis, she boards the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; to fly to America. She previously became acquainted to Ritter through her deceased husband who was in the same flying club with him; she went to live on her estate after he died in a plane crash. Her young daughter, Trudi, is deaf and goes to a school in Boston, living with her friends.
* Karl Boerth — A rigger, and the saboteur of the airship. Boerth was a former Hitler Youth leader, but claims he became inactive because he helped build the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;. His girlfriend, Freda Halle, worked with foreigners in a French bank in Frankfurt, and her ex-lover was killed fighting for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, leading the Gestapo to investigate.
* SS/Gestapo Hauptsturmführer Martin Vogel — The antagonist of the film. Vogel is an undercover Gestapo agent posing as the official photographer for the airship. Initially, Vogel works cooperatively with Ritter, but after Ritter dismisses the suspicious behavior of some of the passengers and has apparent sympathies for Boerth and the Countess, Vogel begins to work behind Ritter&#x27;s back. He also has a romantic interest in a young girl, Valerie Breslau, referring to her as a &quot;Jewish model.&quot; Vogel is loosely based on Karl Otto Clemens, who was a semi-official photographer for the Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei (a passenger list shown in the film lists him as &quot;Otto Vogel&quot;) as well as Luftwaffe Major Hans-Hugo Witt, but there is no evidence that either Clemens or Witt were connected with the Gestapo.
* Rigger Ludecke — A rigger who also works for the Gestapo, helping Vogel catch Boerth.
* Captain Max Pruss — The ship&#x27;s commander. Unlike the real Pruss, he acts dismissively towards safety concerns voiced by Ernst Lehmann. In fact, the real Pruss may have been under Lehmann&#x27;s pressure to rush the landing of the airship.
* Captain Ernst Lehmann — Senior observer who has been a zeppelin captain since before World War 1. He is on the flight at the request of Ritter, and also to appeal to the United States Congress to supply Germany with helium for their airships. He is portrayed as being wary of the Nazis and on good terms with Dr. Eckener. In actuality, the real Lehmann was well known as a Nazi supporter (or at least pretended to be) in order to advance his career and the fortunes of the Zeppelin Company. However, in 1929 Lehmann filed a declaration of intent to become a United States citizen, but changed his mind when he was given charge of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; in 1936. In the film Lehmann reluctantly mentions dropping leaflets from the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; during a propaganda flight. In reality, he was eager and glad to oblige in this undertaking, to the extent that he attempted to launch the ship in unfavorable wind conditions, resulting in damage to the lower fin. Infuriated, Hugo Eckener, Lehmann&#x27;s superior in the Zeppelin Company, angrily berated him for endangering the ship to appease the Nazis, resulting in Propaganda Minister Goebbels blacklisting Eckener in the press, despite his being honored as a hero both in Germany and abroad.
* Reed &amp; Bess Channing — Broadway show promoters and composers, who also own a Dalmatian named Heidi. They took the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; because Mrs. Channing was pregnant for the first time and did not want to risk the turbulent seas on the . Reed Channing and Joe Späh perform a concert, satirizing the Nazi regime, which is abruptly stopped by an offended Captain Pruss. The Channings are very loosely based upon the Adelts, journalists who were closely affiliated with the Zeppelin Company. In reality, German acrobat Joseph Späh owned a dog, a German Shepherd named Ulla. There was also another dog aboard. The dog in the film survives the disaster. Neither of the two dogs aboard the last flight actually survived, and there was no passenger on board the last flight who was pregnant.
* The Breslaus — A family of German-Americans, consisting of Albert and Mildred Breslau and their three children Valerie, Peter, and Paul. Albert Breslau was to sell some diamonds hidden in a pen to get funding for his grandmother&#x27;s family, the Milsteins, out of Germany because they were Jewish. Breslau refused to do this but the pen was given by a Zeppelin staff member to Valerie Breslau before the flight. The family is based upon the Herman Doehner family that was aboard on the last flight (though the Doehners were not Jewish, and while Mrs. Breslau and all three Breslau children survive in the film, Mr. Doehner died in the crash and his daughter Irene died later of burns).
* Joseph Späh — A German-American Vaudeville acrobat who comes under suspicion for making unaccompanied visits to see the Channings&#x27; dog and drawing detailed sketches of the ship&#x27;s interior as an idea for a theatre show. The real Späh made unaccompanied visits into the hull to visit his own dog, and was accused of sabotaging the airship by some members of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; crew.
* Edward Douglas — A German-American advertising executive who was a cryptographer during World War I. He uses that past experience, during his trip aboard the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;, to keep track of a rival ad executive sailing aboard the ocean liner . The first person to reach New York City wins a lucrative contract for their agency to handle the advertising for a soon-to-open German branch of General Motors, which has acquired Opel. Although Douglas was a real passenger aboard the Hindenburg on the last flight, this subplot is only mentioned in Mooney&#x27;s book and has been dismissed as fictional by some airship historians. In addition, Opel was completely acquired by General Motors by 1931.
* Hugo Eckener — Renowned airship commander and head of the Zeppelin Company, known to be hostile to the Nazi regime. In the film, he claims to have refused to name the LZ129 after the Führer, but in reality, Hitler did not want the airship named after him because he thought airships were too dangerous and his name attached to something that might be destroyed would be bad for him.
* Captain Fellows — The U.S. Navy commanding officer at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station, based on Commander Charles E. Rosendahl. He is assisted by Lieutenant Hank Truscott, who is based on Lieutenant George F. Watson.

==Cast==
Many of the fictional characters are based on actual people. For example: Franz Ritter is based on Fritz Erdmann, Karl Boerth is based on Eric Spehl.
(*) Beside name indicates actual historical person

This was the second film released in 1975 to feature the actors William Atherton, Burgess Meredith and Richard Dysart after &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;.

==Production notes==
Director Robert Wise, known for an attention to detail and background research, began to collect documents and film footage on the real-life &quot;Hindenburg&quot; for over a year at the National Archives in London, the National Air and Space Museum Library and Archives in Washington, D.C. as well as in Germany. In 1974, while casting took place in United States, pre-production photography was undertaken in Munich (doubling for Frankfurt), Milwaukee, New York and Washington, D.C. Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey would also be a primary location, but Marine Corps Air Station Tustin near Los Angeles (and the Universal Studios sound stages), where two hangars constructed for airships still existed, doubled for the original &quot;Hindenburg&quot; mooring station (MCAS Tustin officially was closed by BRAC action in 1999). Additional locations in Southern California were also chosen.

Wise also intended to shoot the entire film in black and white and not just the disaster sequence. When Universal objected, he and production designer Edward Carfagno incorporated black and dark colors in the sets to &quot;give an impression of black-and-white in a color film.&quot;

Studio and special effects work was carried out at Sound Stage 12 in the Universal Studios complex. Wise&#x27;s research was used to advantage, since the bulk of Zeppelin blueprints were destroyed in World War II. Using photographs, a recreated passenger area, gondola and superstructure of the giant airship was constructed to create a realistic exterior and interior set for the actors. A team of 80 artists and technicians working double shifts for four months, assembled a &quot;giant Erector Set&quot; consisting of eight tons of aluminum, of muslin, of sash cord and 2,000,000 rivets.

&quot;The Hindenburg&quot; made extensive use of matte paintings to bring the Zeppelin to life. A highly detailed model of the airship was &quot;flown&quot; via an elaborate setup where the stationary model was photographed by a mobile platform consisting of a camera and dolly on a track on Universal Studios&#x27; largest and tallest sound stage, Stage 12. For the scene where the airship drops water ballast, a matte painting was used, and sugar was dropped through a hole in the windows as water. To recreate the initial explosion of the airship, which was missed by the newsreel cameras, matte paintings and animation were used to make a superimposed explosion of the airship beside its mooring mast. The model of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; was hung on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. along with the gondola as part of its Balloons and Airships gallery. (photo at right). When the gallery closed in 1990, the model was relocated to the outside of the museum&#x27;s gift shop, while the gondola was sold to NAS Lakehurst. In 2022, the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; model was moved a second time to the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center following the Smithsonian&#x27;s renovation.

A tragedy nearly happened during the filming of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;″s fiery demise. A full-scale section of the Zeppelin&#x27;s nose was built for the film on Universal Studios&#x27; Stage 12, and was set to be destroyed by fire for the film&#x27;s final destruction sequence. A half-dozen stunt artists wearing fire-retardant gear were placed in the nose replica as it was set afire; however, the fire quickly got out of control, causing several stunt artists to get lost in the smoke, damaging several cameras filming the action, and nearly destroying the sound stage. Only 4 seconds of footage from this sequence appears in the final cut of the film; the entire sequence, as it had been planned, was not included.

===Newsreel footage===
An interesting aspect was the film&#x27;s transition from black and white to technicolor and back to grayscale, beginning with a simulated Universal Newsreel that gave an educated view to the history of the lighter-than-air craft. While a narrator talks about the LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, footage of the LZ 130 &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot; being christened in 1938 is erroneously shown, indicating the newsreel was not from 1936. This ends with images of the Hindenburg&#x27;s construction, immediately transitioning to a color matte painting of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; shown outside its hangar, and along with the opening credits the airship flies by before disappearing into the clouds.

==Historical accuracy==
Although the film is largely accurate to its setting, there were numerous differences between the film and reality. Some aspects were added for dramatic purposes. The scene when the port fin&#x27;s fabric rips did not happen to the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;, but a similar event occurred on the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; during its first flight to the United States in 1928. Additionally, although the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; did have a specially constructed aluminum Blüthner baby grand piano aboard for the 1936 season, it was not aboard the final flight in 1937. While the interior of the ship was accurately recreated utilizing original blueprints and photographs, a stairway was added to the lower fin for dramatic purposes; in the real &quot;Hindenburg&quot;, access to the fin was provided by a ladder from the interior of the ship for crew members to use. Several aspects of the airship&#x27;s takeoff and landing procedures were also inaccurate.

The zeppelin hangar seen when the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; departs Germany for the United States is actually a World War II US Navy blimp hangar located at Tustin, California, the architecture of which is quite different from the actual German zeppelin hangars (the same hangar is also used in the scenes at Lakehurst; a similar hangar was built at Lakehurst in the 1940s, but did not exist in 1937).

The mooring mast used in the landing sequence is black, while the real mooring mast was red and white. During the landing sequence the ship drops water ballast through windows near the nose instead of at the tail section, as it did during the final approach. The &quot;Hindenburg&#x27;s&quot; former captain Ernst A. Lehmann is portrayed in the film as having died immediately from severe burns after the crash at the crash site while in reality he died one day after the crash in hospital from severe burns.

A few anachronisms occur as well: At the beginning of the story, two senior Luftwaffe Generals discuss the possibility of Colonel Franz Ritter receiving the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross for actions in the Spanish Civil War. The Knight&#x27;s Cross did not exist in 1937 (when the film is set), first being created at the start of World War II in 1939.

Also, at one point, Edward Douglas refers to the fact that the German car manufacturer Opel is to be taken over by General Motors &quot;the next day.&quot; In fact, Opel had been taken over completely by General Motors during the Great Depression in 1931, six years previously. When Col. Ritter empties the fountain pen in the sink, it is clearly a modern stainless steel design with modern taps. At Berlin, there are French Citroën HY delivery vans which were built in the late 1940s. And Ursula is seen reading a paperback version of Gone With The Wind, which did not exist in paperback form in 1937.

Several dramatic escapes depicted were based on fact, slightly altered for dramatic purposes, including:

*Werner Franz, a 14-year-old cabin boy, escaped the flames after a water ballast tank overhead burst open and soaked him with water. He then made his way to the hatch and turned around and ran the other way, because the flames were being pushed by the wind toward the starboard side. In the film, however, he is depicted being doused by the water after he jumped out.
*Passenger Joseph Späh, a circus performer, escaped by smashing a window with his home movie camera (the film survived the disaster), and held on to the side of the window, jumping to the ground when the ship was low enough, surviving with only a broken ankle. In the film he is depicted grabbing a mooring rope, but in reality there was no rope.
*Ursula survives the fire by walking down a stairway, similar to the real life escape of Margaret Mather. However, Mather escaped this way only after the ship had crashed to the ground.
*In the film, Radio Officer Willy Speck is seen jumping to his death from a high altitude. In reality he was trapped in the control car when the ship crashed, and later died of his injuries.

==Reception==
Although well received by the public as typical &quot;disaster movie&quot; fare, critical reception of &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; was generally unfavorable. Roger Ebert&#x27;s one-star review from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; dismissed it as a failed project, writing: &quot;&quot;The Hindenburg&quot; is a disaster picture, all right. How else can you describe a movie that cost $12 million and makes people laugh out loud at all the wrong times?&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;brainless&quot; and &quot;pricelessly funny at the wrong moments ... Yet I wouldn&#x27;t have missed a single foolish frame of it. I sort of like disaster movies, even bad ones, for reasons that have to do with the special effects and with other things that probably go back to the prenatal state.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Dull and formula scripting, a lack of real empathy and phoned-in acting shoot down some good though unspectacular special effects.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two stars out of four, faulting it for &quot;really dumb dialog&quot; and a &quot;fake story&quot; but finding it redeemed somewhat by &quot;terrific&quot; special effects and David Shire&#x27;s music. He concluded, &quot;As it stands, the only way to enjoy the film is to get in the mood for trash and to laugh a lot.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote &quot;Technically, the film is a triumph; dramaturgically, it is somewhat less than that. Its climax is terrifyingly, horrendously spectacular, but the two hours getting there are not as gripping as they might have been.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;The film has begun to drag by the time the climactic explosion occurs, and the climax itself is somewhat less than thrilling. Wise has tried to integrate the newsreel footage of the disaster with vignettes of the fictional characters inside attempting to escape, but there&#x27;s an impossible esthetic gulf between the documentary and staged scenes.&quot; Pauline Kael voiced her disapproval of the film and Wise&#x27;s direction with the phrase &quot;One gasbag meets another.&quot; Frank Rich, in his year-end review of films released that year, named &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; the year&#x27;s worst disaster film, stating &quot;The hero is a Nazi and the special effects couldn&#x27;t fool Gerald Ford.&quot; Similar reactions were recounted, and when the film eventually made it to television screens, the &quot;TV Guide&quot; summed up a near-universal review: &quot;This insipid, boring, implausible, senseless, deliciously funny, and expensively mounted film... There&#x27;s no tension whatsoever and none of the characters is remotely interesting, let alone sympathetic.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 33% based on 15 reviews.

&quot;The Hindenburg&quot; opened on Christmas Day 1975 (Thursday) and in its opening four-day weekend (Thursday to Sunday) grossed $3,729,907 from 289 theatres in the United States.

<text>SABRE (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) was a concept under development by Reaction Engines Limited for a hypersonic precooled hybrid air-breathing rocket engine. The engine is designed to achieve single-stage-to-orbit capability, propelling the proposed Skylon spaceplane to low Earth orbit. SABRE is an evolution of Alan Bond&#x27;s series of LACE-like designs that started in the early/mid-1980s for the HOTOL project. Reaction Engines went into bankruptcy in 2024 before completing the project.

The design comprises a single combined cycle rocket engine with two modes of operation. The air-breathing mode combines a turbo-compressor with a lightweight air precooler positioned just behind the inlet cone. At high speeds this precooler cools the hot, ram-compressed air, which would otherwise reach a temperature that the engine could not withstand, leading to a very high pressure ratio within the engine. The compressed air is subsequently fed into the rocket combustion chamber where it is ignited along with stored liquid hydrogen. The high pressure ratio allows the engine to provide high thrust at very high speeds and altitudes. The low temperature of the air permits light alloy construction to be employed and allow a very lightweight engine—essential for reaching orbit. In addition, unlike the LACE concept, SABRE&#x27;s precooler does not liquefy the air, letting it run more efficiently.

After shutting the inlet cone off at Mach 5.14, and at an altitude of , the system continues as a closed-cycle high-performance rocket engine burning liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen from on-board fuel tanks, potentially allowing a hybrid spaceplane concept like Skylon to reach orbital velocity after leaving the atmosphere on a steep climb.

An engine derived from the SABRE concept called Scimitar has been designed for the company&#x27;s A2 hypersonic passenger jet proposal for the European Union-funded LAPCAT study.
==History==
The precooler concept evolved from an idea originated by Robert P. Carmichael in 1955. This was followed by the liquid air cycle engine (LACE) idea which was originally explored by General Dynamics in the 1960s as part of the US Air Force&#x27;s aerospaceplane efforts.

The LACE system was to be placed behind a supersonic air intake which would compress the air through ram compression, then a heat exchanger would rapidly cool it using some of the liquid hydrogen fuel stored on board. The resulting liquid air was then processed to separate the liquid oxygen for combustion. The amount of warmed hydrogen was too great to burn with the oxygen, so most was to be expelled, giving useful thrust, but greatly reducing the potential efficiency.

Instead, as part of the HOTOL project, the liquid air cycle engine (LACE) based RB545 engine was developed with more efficient cycle. The engine was given the Rolls-Royce name &quot;Swallow&quot;. In 1989, after funding for HOTOL ceased, Bond and several others formed Reaction Engines Limited to continue research. The RB545&#x27;s precooler had issues with embrittlement and excess liquid hydrogen consumption, and was encumbered by both patents and the UK&#x27;s Official Secrets Act, so Bond developed SABRE instead.

In 2016 the project received £60m in funds from the UK government and ESA for a demonstrator involving the full cycle.
In July 2021 the UK Space Agency provided a further £3.9m for continued development.

==Concept==
Like the RB545, the SABRE design is neither a conventional rocket engine nor a conventional jet engine, but a hybrid that uses air from the environment at low speeds/altitudes, and stored liquid oxygen at higher altitude. The SABRE engine &quot;relies on a heat exchanger capable of cooling incoming air to , to provide oxygen for mixing with hydrogen and provide jet thrust during atmospheric flight before switching to tanked liquid oxygen when in space.&quot;

In air-breathing mode, air enters the engine through an inlet. A bypass system directs some of the air through a precooler into a compressor, which injects it into a combustion chamber where it is burnt with fuel, the exhaust products are accelerated through nozzles to provide thrust. The remainder of the intake air continues through the bypass system to a ring of flame holders which act as a ramjet for part of the air breathing flight regime. A helium loop is used to transfer the heat from the precooler to the fuel and drive the engine pumps and compressors.

===Inlet===
At the front of the engine, the concept designs propose a simple translating axisymmetric shock cone inlet which compresses and slows the air (relative to the engine) to subsonic speeds using two shock reflections. Accelerating the air to the speed of the engine incurs ram drag. As a result of the shocks, compression, and acceleration the intake air is heated, reaching around at Mach5.5.

Bayern-Chemie, through ESA, have undertaken work to refine and test the intake and bypass systems

===Precooler===
As the air enters the engine at supersonic or hypersonic speeds, it becomes hotter than the engine can withstand due to compression effects. Jet engines, which have the same problem but to a lesser degree, solve it by using heavy copper or nickel-based materials, by reducing the engine&#x27;s pressure ratio, and by throttling back the engine at the higher airspeeds to avoid melting. However, for a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) spaceplane, such heavy materials are unusable, and maximum thrust is necessary for orbital insertion at the earliest time to minimise gravity losses. Instead, using a gaseous helium coolant loop, SABRE dramatically cools the air from down to in a counterflow heat exchanger while avoiding liquefaction of the air or blockage from freezing water vapour. The counterflow heat exchanger also allows the helium to exit the engine at a sufficiently high temperature to drive pumps and compressors for the liquid hydrogen fuel and helium working fluid itself.

Previous versions of precoolers such as HOTOL put the hydrogen fuel directly through the precooler. SABRE inserts a helium cooling loop between the air and the cold fuel to avoid problems with hydrogen embrittlement in the precooler.

The dramatic cooling of the air created a potential problem: it is necessary to prevent blocking the precooler from frozen water vapour and other air fractions. In October 2012, the cooling solution was demonstrated for 6 minutes using freezing air. The cooler consists of a fine pipework heat exchanger with 16,800 thin-walled tubes, and cools the hot in-rushing atmospheric air down to the required in 0.01s. The ice prevention system had been a closely guarded secret, but REL disclosed a methanol-injecting 3D-printed de-icer in 2015 through patents, as they needed partner companies and could not keep the secret while working closely with outsiders.

===Compressor===
Below five times the speed of sound and 25 kilometres of altitude, which are 20% of the speed and 20% of the altitude needed to reach orbit, the cooled air from the precooler passes into a modified turbo-compressor, similar in design to those used on conventional jet engines but running at an unusually high pressure ratio made possible by the low temperature of the inlet air. The compressor feeds the compressed air at 140 atmospheres into the combustion chambers of the main engines.

In a conventional jet engine, the turbo-compressor is driven by a gas turbine powered by combustion gases. SABRE drives the turbine with a helium loop, which is powered by heat captured in the precooler and a preburner.

===Helium loop===
The &#x27;hot&#x27; helium from the air precooler is recycled by cooling it in a heat exchanger with the liquid hydrogen fuel. The loop forms a self-starting Brayton cycle engine, cooling critical parts of the engine and powering turbines. The heat passes from the air into the helium. This heat energy is used to power various parts of the engine and to vaporise hydrogen, which is then burnt in ramjets.

===Combustion chambers===
The combustion chambers in the SABRE engine are cooled by the oxidant (air/liquid oxygen) rather than by liquid hydrogen to further reduce the system&#x27;s use of liquid hydrogen compared with stoichiometric systems.

===Nozzles===
The most efficient atmospheric pressure at which a conventional propelling nozzle works is set by the geometry of the nozzle bell. While the geometry of the conventional bell remains static the atmospheric pressure changes with altitude and therefore nozzles designed for high performance in the lower atmosphere lose efficiency as they reach higher altitudes. In traditional rockets this is overcome by using multiple stages designed for the atmospheric pressures they encounter.

The SABRE engine must operate at both low and high altitude scenarios. To ensure efficiency at all altitudes a sort of moving, expanding nozzle is used. First at low altitude, air-breathing flight the bell is located rearwards, connected to a toroidal combustion chamber surrounding the top part of the nozzle, together forming an expansion deflection nozzle. When SABRE later transitions into rocket mode, the bell is moved forwards, extending the length of the bell of the inner rocket combustion chamber, creating a much larger, high altitude nozzle for more efficient flight.
===Bypass burners===
Avoiding liquefaction improves the efficiency of the engine since less entropy is generated and therefore less liquid hydrogen is boiled off. However, simply cooling the air needs more liquid hydrogen than can be burnt in the engine core. The excess is expelled through a series of burners called &quot;spill duct ramjet burners&quot;, that are arranged in a ring around the central core. These are fed air that bypasses the precooler. This bypass ramjet system is designed to reduce the negative effects of drag resulting from air that passes into the intakes but is not fed into the main rocket engine, rather than generating thrust. At low speeds the ratio of the volume of air entering the intake to the volume that the compressor can feed to the combustion chamber is at its highest, requiring the bypassed air to be accelerated to maintain efficiency at these low speeds. This distinguishes the system from a turboramjet where a turbine-cycle&#x27;s exhaust is used to increase air-flow for the ramjet to become efficient enough to take over the role of primary propulsion.

==Development==

Tests were carried out in 2008 by Airborne Engineering Ltd on an expansion deflection nozzle called STERN to provide the data needed to develop an accurate engineering model to overcome the problem of non-dynamic exhaust expansion. This research continued with the STRICT nozzle in 2011.

Successful tests of an oxidiser (both air and oxygen) cooled combustion chamber were conducted by EADS-Astrium at Institute of Space Propulsion in 2010

In 2011, hardware testing of the heat exchanger technology &quot;crucial to [the] hybrid air- and liquid oxygen-breathing [SABRE] rocket motor&quot; was completed, demonstrating that the technology is viable. The tests validated that the heat exchanger could perform as needed for the engine to obtain adequate oxygen from the atmosphere to support the low-altitude, high-performance operation.

In November 2012, Reaction Engines announced it had successfully concluded a series of tests that prove the cooling technology of the engine, one of the main obstacles towards the completion of the project. The European Space Agency (ESA) evaluated the SABRE engine&#x27;s precooler heat exchanger, and accepted claims that the technologies required to proceed with the engine&#x27;s development had been fully demonstrated.

In June 2013 the United Kingdom government announced further support for the development of a full-scale prototype of the SABRE engine, providing £60M of funding between 2014 and 2016 with the ESA providing an additional £7M. The total cost of developing a test rig is estimated at £200M.

By June 2015, SABRE&#x27;s development continued with The Advanced Nozzle Project at Westcott. The test engine, operated by Airborne Engineering Ltd., is being used to analyze the aerodynamics and performance of the advanced nozzles that the SABRE engine will use, in addition to new manufacturing technologies such as the 3D-printed propellant injection system.

In April 2015, the SABRE engine concept passed a theoretical feasibility review conducted by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory. The laboratory was to reveal two-stage-to-orbit SABRE concepts shortly afterwards, as they considered that a single-stage-to-orbit Skylon space plane is &quot;technically very risky as a first application of SABRE engine&quot;.

In August 2015 the European Commission competition authority approved UK government funding of £50 million for further development of the SABRE project. This was approved on the grounds that money raised from private equity had been insufficient to bring the project to completion. In October 2015 British company BAE Systems agreed to buy a 20% stake in the company for £20.6 million as part of an agreement to help develop the SABRE hypersonic engine.
In 2016, Reaction CEO Mark Thomas announced plans to build a quarter-sized ground test engine, given limitations of funding.

In September 2016 agents acting on behalf of Reaction Engines applied for planning consent to build a rocket engine test facility at the site of the former Rocket Propulsion Establishment in Westcott, UK which was granted in April 2017, and in May 2017 a groundbreaking ceremony was held to announce the beginning of construction of the SABRE TF1 engine test facility, expected to become active in 2020. However, development of the TF1 facility has since been quietly dropped, and the site has now been taken on by aerospace and defence group Nammo.

In September 2017 it was announced the United States Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had contracted with Reaction Engines Inc. to build a high-temperature airflow test facility at Front Range Airport near Watkins, Colorado. The DARPA contract is to test the Sabre engine&#x27;s pre-cooler heat exchanger (HTX). Construction of the test facilities and test articles began in 2018 with testing focusing on running the HTX at temperatures simulating air coming through a subsonic intake travelling at Mach5 or around beginning in 2019.

The HTX test unit was completed in the UK and sent to Colorado in 2018, where on 25 March 2019 an F-4 GE J79 turbojet exhaust was mixed with ambient air to replicate Mach3.3 inlet conditions, successfully quenching a stream of gases to in less than 1/20 of a second. Further tests simulating Mach5 were planned, with temperature reduction expected from . These further tests were successfully completed by October 2019.

The successful HTX test could lead to spin-off precooler applications which could be developed before a scalable SABRE demonstrator is completed; suggested uses are to expand gas turbines capabilities, in advanced turbofans, hypersonic vehicles, and industrial applications.
In March 2019, the UKSA and ESA preliminary design review of the demonstrator engine core confirmed the test version to be ready for implementation.

In 2019, Airborne Engineering conducted a test campaign on subscale air/hydrogen injectors for the SABRE preburners.

In 2020, Airborne Engineering conducted a test campaign on an &quot;HX3 module&quot; (preburner to helium loop heat exchanger) 

In 2022, a Foreign Comparative Testing of Reaction’s precooler heat exchanger was performed. The testing was successfully completed by the company’s US subsidiary (Reaction Engines Incorporated – REI) and the US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). “The FCT test program greatly expanded the demonstrated capabilities of our engine precooler technology”, said REI’s director of engineering, Andrew Piotti. “During these recent tests, the precooler successfully achieved our objective of over 10 megawatts of transferred thermal energy from the high-temperature airflow, which is three times higher than our previous test program.”

Despite technical successes, Reaction Engines has faced financial difficulties. In October 2024, reports emerged that the company entered administration after failing to secure additional funding, leading to significant layoffs. 

===Engine===
Due to the static thrust capability of the hybrid rocket engine, the vehicle can take off under air-breathing mode, much like a conventional turbojet. As the craft ascends and the outside air pressure drops, more and more air is passed into the compressor as the effectiveness of the ram compression drops. In this fashion the jets are able to operate to a much higher altitude than would normally be possible.

At Mach5.5 the air-breathing system becomes inefficient and is powered down, replaced by the on-board stored oxygen which allows the engine to accelerate to orbital velocities (around Mach25).

==Evolution==
===RB545===
Designed for use with HOTOL.

The engine had no air-breathing static thrust capability, relying on a rocket trolley to achieve takeoff

===SABRE===
Designed for use with Skylon A4.

The engine had no air-breathing static thrust capability, relying on RATO engines.

===SABRE 2===
Designed for use with Skylon C1.

The engine had no static thrust capability, using LOX until the air-breathing cycle could take over.

===SABRE 3===
Designed for use with Skylon C2.

This engine included a fuel rich preburner to augment the heat recovered from the airstream used to drive the helium loop, giving the engine static thrust capability.

===SABRE 4===
SABRE 4 is no longer a single engine design, but a class of engines, e.g. a instance of this engine is used with SKYLON D1.5, a for a USAF study into a partially reusable TSTO.

==Performance==
The designed thrust-to-weight ratio of SABRE is fourteen compared to about five for conventional jet engines, and two for scramjets. This high performance is a combination of the denser, cooled air, requiring less compression, and, more importantly, the low air temperatures permitting lighter alloys to be used in much of the engine. Overall performance is much better than the RB545 engine or scramjets.

Fuel efficiency (known as specific impulse in rocket engines) peaks at about 3500 seconds within the atmosphere. Typical all-rocket systems peak around 450 seconds and even &quot;typical&quot; nuclear thermal rockets at about 900 seconds.

The combination of high fuel efficiency and low-mass engines permits an SSTO approach, with air-breathing to Mach5.14+ at altitude, and with the vehicle reaching orbit with more payload mass per take-off mass than just about any non-nuclear launch vehicle ever proposed.

The precooler adds mass and complexity to the system and is the most aggressive and difficult part of the design, but the mass of this heat exchanger is an order of magnitude lower than has been achieved previously. The experimental device achieved heat exchange of almost 1 GW/m3. The losses from carrying the added weight of systems shut down during the closed cycle mode (namely the precooler and turbo-compressor) as well as the added weight of Skylon&#x27;s wings are offset by the gains in overall efficiency and the proposed flight plan. Conventional launch vehicles such as the Space Shuttle spend about one-minute climbing almost vertically at relatively low speeds; this is inefficient but optimal for pure-rocket vehicles. In contrast, the SABRE engine permits a much slower, shallower climb (thirteen minutes to reach the 28.5 km transition altitude), while breathing air and using its wings to support the vehicle. This trades gravity drag and an increase in vehicle weight for a reduction in propellant mass and a gain from aerodynamic lift increasing payload fraction to the level at which SSTO becomes possible.

A hybrid jet engine like SABRE needs only reach low hypersonic speeds inside the lower atmosphere before engaging its closed cycle mode, whilst climbing, to build speed. Unlike ramjet or scramjet engines, the design is able to provide high thrust from zero speed up to Mach5.4, with excellent thrust over the entire flight, from the ground to very high altitude, with high efficiency throughout. In addition, this static thrust capability means the engine can be realistically tested on the ground, which drastically cuts testing costs.

In 2012, REL expected test flights by 2020, and operational flights by 2030.

<text>Daqing () is a prefecture-level city in the west of Heilongjiang province, People&#x27;s Republic of China. The name literally means &quot;Great Celebration&quot; and refers to the tenth anniversary of the PRC. Daqing is known as the &quot;Oil Capital of China&quot; and has experienced a phenomenal boom since oil was discovered at the Daqing Oil Field in 1959.

Its population was 2,781,562 as of the 2020 census, of whom 1,574,389 lived in the built-up (or metro) area in four out of the total of five urban districts: Sartu, Longfeng, Ranghulu and Honggang.

==History==
The region now known as Daqing Prefecture was a reasonably insignificant place until the Qing dynasty, known only as an unsettled hunting ground of Dörbet Oirat tribes due to its wetland and prairies. The region began to grow slightly after the Russian Empire constructed the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) through the area in 1898. The railway has a station at Sartu in today&#x27;s Sartu District. It was not until 1959 that oil was discovered in the region as part of the large scale oil exploration put into motion across the Northeast China Plain. 

The Daqing oilfield was discovered in the late 1950s, and drilling began in 1958. A town with the same name was founded in 1959 to house workers extracting oil and gas from the oilfield and to host industries which could take advantage of the energy and petrochemicals, shortly before the 10th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. The successful construction of the Daqing oil field despite harsh weather conditions and supply limitations became a model held up by the Party as an example during subsequent industrialization campaigns. The project also delivered critical economic benefits because without the production of the Daqing oil field, crude oil would have been severely limited after the Soviet Union cut off supplies as a result of the Sino-Soviet split.

Original plans for Daqing included the development of a &quot;new socialist mining district&quot; (rather than a city) with families in which the husband would work in industry and the wife would work in agriculture.

The name Daqing literally means &quot;Great Celebration&quot;. On 26 May 1960, Anda City was established at former Anda town (today&#x27;s Anda City in Suihua prefecture), administering Daqing oilfield area. Five months later, the administrative organs of the oilfield relocated in Sartu. On 23 June 1964, the city was established Anda special administrative region, with Anda county administering its surrounding area. 

The first two years of the Cultural Revolution resulted in major disruptions to China&#x27;s petroleum industry and an oil shortage by 1967. In March of that year, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army was called to Daqing to maintain order so that oil production could proceed. This made Daqing one of the first places brought under military control during the Cultural Revolution. In May 1968, the Daqing Revolutionary Committee was established. Iron Man Wang Jinxi became its vice director. The oil field continued to be a major driver of economic growth during the chaotic Cultural Revolution period.

The Daqing Oil District became a city in 1980. Its first master plan set a goal of growing Daqing into &quot;a new industrial city&quot; through a development strategy of &quot;relative dispersion with several modest concentrations. Academic Hou Li summarizes that as a result &quot;new settlements became much more concentrated. The three existing towns, thirty-four central villages, and 260 settlement points were restructured into six workers&#x27; towns, twenty-four central villages, and twenty-seven resident villages.&quot;

The city revised its master plan in 1989, setting a new goal of building an oil city centered in Saertu, Dongfeng, and Longfeng. This plan shifted Daqing&#x27;s urban planning focus away from decentralization to centralization.

In 1990, the city received the top recognition in the Heilongjiang Province Science and Technology Awards. In 1994, its population reached one million. After the mid-1990s, urban expansion in Saertu was halted in order to provide more space for oil production. Urban construction was instead transferred to East Town and West Town areas.

Since its foundation, Daqing has been advocated as a model of good practice in industry and healthcare by the Chinese government.

===Learn from Daqing in industry===
The fact that Mao Zedong promulgated his Supreme Directive, &quot;Learn from Daqing in Industry&quot;, in the 1960s reflects how important a role Daqing has historically played in industry in China. &quot;Learn from Daqing in industry&quot; () was a slogan during the Cultural Revolution telling the people to use the city as an example for industrial production.

The film &quot;Entrepreneurial Pioneers&quot; (), made in the early 1970s, is a literary rendition of the history of Daqing. During the Mao era, Daqing&#x27;s agricultural counterpart was Dazhai, a village in the hilly Xiyang county, Shanxi Province, for which Chairman Mao issued the directive &quot;In agriculture, learn from Dazhai&quot;, also in the 1960s.

==Administrative divisions==
Daqing is divided into 9 county-level divisions: 5 districts, 3 counties and 1 autonomous county.

==Climate==
Located in the north temperate zone, Daqing has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;) and is affected by the Siberian high and the East Asian monsoon. Generally, winter is bitterly cold with occasional snowfalls, and spring and autumn are prevailed by monsoons. The vast majority of the annual rainfall occurs during summer. The diurnal temperature variation can be up to during the growing period. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . A majority of the annual precipitation falls in July and August alone. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 53% in July to 70% in February, the city receives 2,726 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme temperature ranges from to 

==Demographics==
Daqing has a population of 2.9 million, of them mainly Han Chinese, with a few population of other 31 minority ethnic groups including Manchu, Mongolian, Korean, and Hui nationalities. The population density is 112.69/km2, urban population density 205.07/km2.

==Economy==

Daqing&#x27;s economy highly depends on petroleum and related industries. Daqing&#x27;s oilfield is China&#x27;s largest and the world&#x27;s fourth most productive. Petroleum accounts for 60.8% of GDP. In 2011, Daqing&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) was RMB374 billion yuan, representing a rise of 12.1% year on year. Primary industries output (including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and the fisheries) increased by 13.5% to RMB13.29 billion. Secondary and value-added industries and construction output experienced an increase of 10.1%, reaching RMB307 billion, while the tertiary industry output increased 22.9% to RMB53.74 billion. In 2015 Daqing had a GDP of RMB 298.35 billion.

===Foreign trade===
Daqing exports over 10 million tons of crude oil each year. Over 160 varieties of paraffin wax, ethylene, tar oil and benzene are exported to more than 10 nations and regions including the US, the UK, Thailand and Hong Kong.

In 2011, total import and export volume in Daqing reached US$2.16 billion, up by 40.1%. Export volume was US$550 million and import volume was US$1.61 billion. Daqing&#x27;s main exports include six categories of petrochemical products, construction materials, processed foodstuffs, office furniture and mechanical and electronic equipment.

===Banking and insurance===
There were 32 banking institutions in Daqing by the end of 2006; none were foreign-invested banks. In 2011, savings deposits in Renminbi and foreign exchange totaled 170.5 billion RMB. The local finance sector plays an important role in building up Daqing&#x27;s Century Oilfield and in developing new industries.

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Agricultural Bank, China Construction Bank, Bank of China, China Communications Bank, the Everbright Bank, Guangdong Development Bank, the Daqing Urban Commercial Bank, Daqing Rural Credit Cooperative Union and the County Urban Credit Cooperative are the major banks serving Daqing.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
Daqing is a major railway hub in western Heilongjiang province and is located on the junction of Harbin-Manzhouli Railway and Tongliao-Ranghulu Railway. Daqing has three major railway stations: Daqing station, Daqing West station (formerly Ranghulu railway station) and Daqing East station. Trains from Daqing connect the city with Beijing, Harbin, Dalian and several other cities in China. The newly built Harbin–Qiqihar Intercity Railway has stops at both Daqing West station and Daqing East station.

===Airport===

Daqing Sartu Airport was opened on 1 September 2009. There are flights to several large cities including Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Qingdao and Shanghai.

===Highway===
Daqing is linked to the national highway network through the G45 Daqing–Guangzhou Expressway and G10 Suifenhe-Manzhouli Expressway.

==Culture==

===Daqing spirit===
Generated by the history of the city, Daqing has a culture centering around the &quot;Daqing Spirit, the Daqing People,&quot; which is said to represent deep personal commitment in pursuing national goals, self-sufficient and frugal living, and urban-rural integrated land use. Daqing&#x27;s urban-rural landscape was said to embody the ideal communist society described by Karl Marx because it eliminated (1) the gap between town and country, (2) the gap between workers and peasants, and (3) the gap between manual and mental labor.

&quot;Daqing Spirit, Daqing People&quot; was the title of an April 20, 1964 article in &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; which extolled the success of Daqing oil field workers. The most influential of many articles praising Daqing that appeared in state media around that time, &quot;Daqing Spirit, Daqing People&quot; was the first text to compare Daqing to Yan&#x27;an, the revolutionary base area where the Communist Party re-grouped following the Long March before going on to win the Chinese Civil War.

Wang Jinxi (, known as &quot;Iron Man&quot; Wang), a petroleum worker on the Daqing Oilfield who led No. 1205 drilling team, was honored as a national hero due to his contributions to the petroleum industry of China. Daqing was established by the central government as a model for the secondary industry during the 1960s. In order to illuminate the entrepreneurial history of Daqing and its people, several films were made by companies in China.

In 1964, chief director of the Central Experimental Theater Sun Weishi and her husband, the actor Jin Shan, traveled to Daqing to live and work with the oil workers and their families. The next year, the Communist Party journal &quot;Red Flag&quot; published an article by Sun which praised the Daqing people. After living in Daqing for two years, Sun Weishi returned to Beijing to produce the play &quot;The Rising Sun&quot;, which was based on the experiences of people in Daqing, particularly Daqing women.

==Sports==

The most popular sport in Daqing is association football. The largest sports venue by capacity is the 32,000-capacity Daqing Olympic Park Stadium. The city also has an indoor speed skating arena.

<doc id="638360" wikidata="Q750927" url="?curid=638360" title="Steve Miller Band">
<text>The Steve Miller Band is an American rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1966. The band is led by Steve Miller on guitar and lead vocals. The group had a string of mid- to late-1970s hit singles that are staples of classic rock radio, as well as several earlier psychedelic rock albums. Miller left his first band to move to San Francisco and form the Steve Miller Blues Band. Shortly after Harvey Kornspan negotiated the band&#x27;s contract with Capitol Records in 1967, the band shortened its name to the Steve Miller Band. In February 1968, the band recorded its debut album, &quot;Children of the Future&quot;. It went on to produce the albums &quot;Sailor&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, &quot;Your Saving Grace&quot;, &quot;Number 5&quot;, &quot;The Joker&quot;, &quot;Fly Like an Eagle&quot;, and &quot;Book of Dreams&quot;, among others. The band&#x27;s album &quot;Greatest Hits 1974–78&quot;, released in 1978, has sold over 13 million copies. In 2016, Steve Miller was inducted as a solo artist into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==History==
In 1965, after moving to Chicago to play the blues, Steve Miller and keyboardist Barry Goldberg founded the Goldberg-Miller Blues Band along with bassist Roy Ruby, rhythm guitarist Craymore Stevens, and drummer Maurice McKinley. The band contracted to Epic Records and recorded a single, &quot;The Mother Song&quot;, which they performed on &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, before Miller left the group and moved to San Francisco.

Miller then formed the Steve Miller Blues Band. Harvey Kornspan, managing partner, wrote and negotiated the band&#x27;s contract ($860,000 over five years as well as $25,000 of promotion money that was to be spent at the band&#x27;s discretion) with Capitol/EMI Records then-president Alan Livingston in 1967. Shortly after, the band&#x27;s name was shortened to the Steve Miller Band at the recommendation of George Martin in order to broaden its appeal. The band, consisting of Miller, guitarist James Cooke, bassist Lonnie Turner, drummer Tim Davis (who replaced the departing Lance Haas) and Jim Peterman on Hammond B3 organ, backed Chuck Berry at a gig at the Fillmore Auditorium that was released as the live album, &quot;Live at Fillmore Auditorium&quot;. Guitarist Boz Scaggs joined the band soon after and the group performed at the Magic Mountain Festival (festival was held June 10/11, 1967) and the following week at the Monterey Pop Festival (festival was held June 16/17/18, 1967).

In March 1968, while in England, the band recorded their debut album, &quot;Children of the Future&quot;, at Olympic studios with Glyn Johns as engineer/producer. The album did not score among the Top 100 album chart. The visit itself got off to a poor start also as the group and their entourage were arrested for &#x27;importing drugs and possession of a dangerous firearm&#x27;. Kornspan&#x27;s wife had called Johns asking if he would appear as a character witness in the magistrate&#x27;s court the day after the arrest and, hopefully, stand bail for them. Johns agreed and the group was released on condition that Johns would &#x27;stand surety for their good behavior&#x27; for the rest of their time in England. Both accusations were dropped. The &#x27;dangerous firearm&#x27; turned out to be a non-working flare gun that was being used as a wall decoration in the house where the group was staying. The &#x27;imported drugs&#x27; happened to be some hash that was buried in the middle of a large fruitcake that had been sent to the group by a stateside friend, unbeknownst to anyone in the group.

The second album &quot;Sailor&quot; appeared in October 1968 and climbed the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart to . Successes included the single &quot;Living in the USA&quot;. &quot;Brave New World&quot; (, 1969) featured the songs &quot;Space Cowboy&quot; and &quot;My Dark Hour&quot;. Paul McCartney, credited as &quot;Paul Ramon&quot;, played drums, bass and sang backing vocals on &quot;My Dark Hour&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Your Saving Grace&quot; (, 1969) and &quot;Number 5&quot; (, 1970). In 1971, Miller broke his neck in a car accident. Capitol Records released the album &quot;Rock Love&quot;, featuring unreleased live performances and studio material. This is one of two Steve Miller Band albums not to be reissued on CD until 2022, the other being &quot;Recall the Beginning...A Journey from Eden&quot;. In 1972, the double album compilation &quot;Anthology&quot; was released, containing 16 songs from five of the band&#x27;s first seven albums.

The style and personnel of the band changed radically with &quot;The Joker&quot; (, 1973), concentrating on straightforward rock and leaving the psychedelic blues side of the band behind. The title track, &quot;The Joker&quot;, became a single and was certified 5× platinum, reaching over five million sales. It was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on January 11, 1974.

Three years later, the band returned with the album &quot;Fly Like an Eagle&quot;, which charted at . Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; (), &quot;Fly Like an Eagle&quot; () and their second success, &quot;Rock&#x27;n Me&quot;. Miller credits the guitar introduction to &quot;Rock&#x27;n Me&quot; as a tribute to the Free song, &quot;All Right Now&quot;.

&quot;Book of Dreams&quot; (, 1977) also included three successes: &quot;Jet Airliner&quot; (), &quot;Jungle Love&quot; () (later becoming the song played over the opening credits of the 8th season of the sitcom &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;), and &quot;Swingtown&quot; (). 1982&#x27;s &quot;Abracadabra&quot; album gave Steve Miller his third success with the title track. Miller&#x27;s hit pushed Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; out of the spot, just as his &quot;Rock&#x27;n Me&quot; had knocked Chicago&#x27;s &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; out of the spot in 1976.

Released in 1978, &quot;The Steve Miller Band&#x27;s Greatest Hits 1974–78&quot; has sold over 15 million copies.

&quot;Bingo!&quot;, an album of blues and R&amp;B covers, was released on June 15, 2010. &quot;Let Your Hair Down&quot;, a companion release to &quot;Bingo!&quot;, was released 10 months later, on April 18, 2011.

Founding member Tim Davis died from complications due to diabetes on September 20, 1988, at the age of 44. Long-time band member Norton Buffalo died from lung cancer on October 30, 2009. John King (drummer during &quot;The Joker&quot; era) died after a short bout with kidney cancer on October 26, 2010. James Cooke died from cancer on 16 May 2011. Original bassist Lonnie Turner died from lung cancer on April 28, 2013. His time with the band led to songs such as Jet Airliner, Swingtown, Take the Money And Run, Jungle Love and many more. Blues guitarist Jacob Petersen officially joined the band before the Spring 2011 tour. Following Petersen joining the band, longtime guitarist Kenny Lee Lewis switched instruments to become the band&#x27;s full-time bassist. In 2014, Steve Miller Band toured with fellow San Francisco rock band Journey.

When it was announced that Steve Miller would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist without his band, Miller told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t my decision, and I didn&#x27;t have any input into any of it. If they had asked me what do, I think I would have said, &#x27;Here&#x27;s a list of everyone that was ever in my band. They all ought to be here.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="638364" wikidata="Q156918" url="?curid=638364" title="Salix alba">
<text>Salix alba, the white willow, is a species of willow native to Europe and western and central Asia. The name derives from the white tone to the undersides of the leaves.

It is a medium to large deciduous tree growing up to 10–30 m tall, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter and an irregular, often-leaning crown. The bark is grey-brown and is deeply fissured in older trees. The shoots in the typical species are grey-brown to green-brown. The leaves are paler than most other willows because they are covered with very fine, silky white hairs, in particular on the underside; they are 5–10 cm long and 0.5–1.5 cm wide. The flowers are produced in catkins in early spring and are pollinated by insects. It is dioecious, with male and female catkins on separate trees; the male catkins are 4–5 cm long, the female catkins 3–4 cm long at pollination, lengthening as the fruit matures. When mature in midsummer, the female catkins comprise numerous small (4 mm) capsules, each containing numerous minute seeds embedded in silky white hairs, which aids wind dispersal.

==Ecology==

Like all willows, &quot;Salix alba&quot; is usually to be found in wet or poorly-drained soil at the edge of pools, lakes or rivers. Its wide-spreading roots take up moisture from a large surrounding area.
White willows are fast-growing but relatively short-lived, being susceptible to several diseases, including watermark disease caused by the bacterium &quot;Brenneria salicis&quot; (named because of the characteristic &#x27;watermark&#x27; staining in the wood; syn. &quot;Erwinia salicis&quot;) and willow anthracnose, caused by the fungus &quot;Marssonina salicicola&quot;. These diseases can be a serious problem on trees grown for timber or ornament.

It readily forms natural hybrids with crack willow &quot;Salix fragilis&quot;, the hybrid being named &quot;Salix &quot;×&quot; rubens&quot; Schrank.
==Varieties, cultivars and hybrids==
Several cultivars and hybrids have been selected for forestry and horticultural use:
*&quot;Salix alba&quot; &#x27;Caerulea&#x27; (cricket-bat willow; syn. &quot;Salix alba&quot; var. &quot;caerulea&quot; (Sm.) Sm.; &quot;Salix caerulea&quot; Sm.) is grown as a specialist timber crop in Britain, mainly for the production of cricket bats, and for other uses where a tough, lightweight wood that does not splinter easily is required. It is distinguished mainly by its growth form, very fast-growing with a single straight stem, and also by its slightly larger leaves (10–11 cm long, 1.5–2 cm wide) with a more blue-green colour. Its origin is unknown; it may be a hybrid between white willow and crack willow, but this is not confirmed.
*&quot;Salix alba&quot; &#x27;Vitellina&#x27; (golden willow; syn. &quot;Salix alba&quot; var. &quot;vitellina&quot; (L.) Stokes) is a cultivar grown in gardens for its shoots, which are golden-yellow for one to two years before turning brown. It is particularly decorative in winter; the best effect is achieved by coppicing it every two to three years to stimulate the production of longer young shoots with better colour. Other similar cultivars include &#x27;Britzensis&#x27;, &#x27;Cardinal&#x27;, and &#x27;Chermesina&#x27;, selected for even brighter orange-red shoots.
*&quot;Salix alba&quot; &#x27;Vitellina-Tristis&#x27; (golden weeping willow, synonym &#x27;Tristis&#x27;) is a weeping cultivar with yellow branches that become reddish-orange in winter. It is now rare in cultivation and has been largely replaced by &quot;Salix x sepulcralis&quot; &#x27;Chrysocoma&#x27;. It is, however, still the best choice in very cold parts of the world, such as Canada, the northern US, and Russia. 
*The golden hybrid weeping willow (&quot;Salix &quot;×&quot; sepulcralis&quot; &#x27;Chrysocoma&#x27;) is a hybrid between white willow and Peking willow &quot;Salix babylonica&quot;.

===Award of Garden Merit===
The following have received the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit
*&quot;Salix alba&quot; &#x27;Golden Ness&#x27;
*&quot;Salix alba&quot; var. &quot;serica&quot; (silver willow)
*&quot;Salix alba&quot; var. &quot;vitellina&quot; &#x27;Yelverton&#x27;
*&quot;Salix&quot; × &quot;sepulcralis&quot; &#x27;Erythroflexuosa&#x27; 
*&quot;Salix&quot; × &quot;sepulcralis&quot; var. &quot;chrysocoma&quot;

==Uses==
The wood is tough, strong, and light in weight, but has minimal resistance to decay. The stems (withies) from coppiced and pollarded plants are used for basket-making. Charcoal made from the wood was important for gunpowder manufacture. The bark tannin was used in the past for tanning leather. The wood is used to make cricket bats. 

&quot;S. alba&quot; wood has a low density and a lower transverse compressive strength. This allows the wood to bend, which is why it can be used to make baskets. Willow bark contains indole-3-butyric acid, which is a plant hormone stimulating root growth; willow trimmings are sometimes used to clone rootstock in place of commercially synthesized root stimulator. 
It is also used for ritual purposes by Jews on the holiday of Sukkot.

===Medicinal uses===

Willow (of unspecified species) has long been used by herbalists for various ailments, although it is a myth that they attribute to it any analgesic effect. One of the first references to White Willow specifically was by Edward Stone, of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, in 1763. He &#x27;accidentally&#x27; tasted the bark and found it had a bitter taste, which reminded him of Peruvian Bark (Cinchona), which was used to treat malaria. After researching all the &#x27;dispensaries and books on botany,&#x27; he found no suggestion of willow ever being used to treat fevers and decided to experiment with it himself. Over the next seven years he successfully used the dried powder of willow bark to cure &#x27;agues and intermittent fevers&#x27; of around fifty people, although it worked better when combined with quinine.

Stone appears to have been largely ignored by the medical profession and herbalists alike. There are reports of two pharmacists using the remedy in trials, but there is no evidence that it worked. By the early 20th century, Maud Grieve, an herbalist, did not consider White Willow to be a febrifuge. Instead, she describes using the bark and the powdered root for its tonic, antiperiodic and astringent qualities and recommended its use in treating dyspepsia, worms, chronic diarrhoea and dysentery. She considered tannin to be the active constituent.

An active extract of the bark, called salicin, after the Latin name &quot;Salix&quot;, was isolated to its crystalline form in 1828 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist, and Raffaele Piria, an Italian chemist, who then succeeded in separating out the acid in its pure state. Salicylic acid is a chemical derivative of salicin and is widely used in medicine. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is, however, a chemical that does not occur in nature and was originally synthesised from salicylic acid extracted from Meadowsweet, and is not connected to willow.

<text>A promise is a commitment by someone to do or not do something. As a noun &quot;promise&quot; means a declaration assuring that one will or will not do something. As a verb it means to commit oneself by a promise to do or give. It can also mean a capacity for good, similar to a value that is to be realized in the near future.

In the law of contract, an exchange of promises is usually held to be legally enforceable, according to the Latin maxim &quot;pacta sunt servanda&quot;.

== Types ==
There are many types of promises. There are solemn promises, such as marriage vows or military oaths and are conventions. There are legal contracts, enforceable by law. Or, there are fairy tale promises, regrettable and problematic at the time, they must be honored. And lastly, there are election promises, commitments that most people realize will later be shaped by politics and compromise.

Both an oath and an affirmation can be a promise. One special kind of promise is the vow.

A notable type of promise is an election promise. Election promises are pledges that will be later shaped by politics and the cooperation of individuals.

A promise is a manifestation of intent to act or refrain from acting in a specified way at some point in the future. It&#x27;s communicated by one party, to at least one additional party, to signify a commitment has been made. The person manifesting intent is the Promisor. The person to whom the manifestation is addressed is the Promisee.

In law, contracts are created by a process of offer and acceptance. An offer to enter into a binding contract consists of an indication by the Oferror to be legally bound by the terms indicated in the offer once the person to whom the offer is addressed, the Offeree, has accepted the offer in the manner indicated in the offer (if any). Once acceptance has taken place, a binding contract has come into existence and both parties are legally bound by its terms. A contract is therefore a voluntarily assumed legal obligation. A party who fails to perform his obligations under the contract is said to be in breach of contract and is liable to compensate the other party. Compensation normally takes the form of payment of a sum of money sufficient to place the party entitled to damages in the same position as in which that party would have been if the contract had been performed. For instance, if A agrees to sell a car to B for $10,000 and B agrees to pay, then if A fails to deliver the car, B would be entitled to compensation sufficient to enable B to purchase a similar car without having to spend more than the agreed price. Therefore, if by the time of the breach the price of the car has increased by 10%, A would be liable to pay B $1,000, assuming that B has not paid anything yet. If B has paid a deposit of $5,000, then B would be entitled to restitution of his deposit plus the $1,000. A contract may consist of mutual undertakings, as in the example just given, where A agreed to deliver a car and B agrees to pay for it. Such contracts are known as bilateral contracts. But a contract may only give rise to an undertaking by one party, as where A agrees to pay B if B finds a particular car which A has been trying to acquire. B is under no duty to search but would be entitled to payment if she finds the car.

Other types of promises would include solemn promises which includes marriage vows and military oaths. People also make fairy tale promises which are regrettable and difficult at the time the promise is made but must still be honored.

==Conditional commitment==
In loan guarantees, a commitment requires to meet an equity commitment, as well as other conditions, before the loan guarantee is closed.

==Religion==

Religions have similar attitudes towards promises. With regard to keeping promises, in the Hebrew Bible states: &quot;Better not to promise at all than to make a promise and not keep it. Don&#x27;t let your own words lead you into sin&quot;. 

===Christianity===
Christian theology regards the gift of the Holy Spirit bestowed on believers as the fulfillment of a promise made by Jesus. Jesus is seen as making &quot;great promises&quot; in favour of prayer. 

In Christian ethics, a distinction is made between simple promises and oaths or vows. An oath is a promise invoking God as a witness. A vow is a solemn form of a promise typically made to commit oneself to a moral good with God as witness, and binds oneself to its fulfillment over time.

Some groups of Christians, for example the Religious Society of Friends and the Anabaptist Churches (such as the Mennonites), object to the taking of both oaths and affirmations, basing their objections upon a commandment given in the Sermon on the Mount, and regard all promises to be witnessed by God.

===Islam===
In Surah An-Nahl, God forbids Muslims to break their promises after they have confirmed them. All promises are regarded as having Allah as their witness and guarantor. In the hadith, Muhammad states that a Muslim who made a promise and then saw a better thing to do, should do the better thing and then make an act of atonement for breaking the promise. It is forbidden to break an oath in Islam. However, when someone does break an oath, they are required to ask for forgiveness and make up for the sin by feeding/clothing 10 poor people or freeing a slave (which is nearly impossible today), or, if unable to do these, to fast for three days. One of the four types of promises that are punished quickly is when you want to harm a relationship when the other person wants to keep it.

==Philosophy==
Philosophers have tried to establish rules for promises. Immanuel Kant suggested promises should always be kept, while some consequentialists argue that promises should be broken whenever doing so would yield benefits. In &quot;How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time&quot;, Iain King tried to reconcile these positions, suggesting that promises should be kept &#x27;unless they are worth less to others than a new option is to you,&#x27; and that this requires a relevant, unforeseen and reasonably unforeseeable change in the situation more important than the promise itself arising after the promise is made.

As opposed to Kant, some Rossian pluralists believe that morality with regards to right and wrong cannot be formalized in writing. In certain circumstances, breaking one&#x27;s promise may be more beneficial than the cost of keeping it. These moral principles need guidance and good judgments to maximize the benefits of people involved.

==Politics==
In democracy promises are made to offer assurance, especially during election. Political tactic to offer promise that would guarantee a better future to sway voters. In Western democracies, election promises are more often fulfilled than not. However, certain promises are famously broken.

==Society==

The &quot;promise&quot;, in sociology and society, as discussed by C. Wright Mills and others is the ideological impression or commitment our society makes to us, and the commitment we make to our society in return for prosperity. The best or most popular example of this is the American Dream.

==Psychology==
Promises are compared with threats by Verbrugge, Dieussaert, Schaeken and William. When a threat or promise is conditional, it tends to receive biconditional interpretation. Also, both threats and promises are highly controlled by the speaker. The fundamental difference is the valence of the prospective action on the speaker&#x27;s part. In the case of a promise it is generally positive while in the case of a threat it is negative. There is some evidence to suggest that threats are perceived simply as negative promises. However, promises are often made with an intent on the speaker&#x27;s part to convince a hearer to do something by holding out the prospect of a reward; threats by contrasts are often made with an intent to influence a hearer&#x27;s behavior by holding out the prospect of a punishment. In addition, certain characteristics of promises and threats, such as &quot;magnitude&quot; and &quot;credibility&quot;, affect the probability that the target will gain compliance or failure.
Promises can fall under many different categories, however they will have two key components. The type of activity that the promises undertakes to do, and the content of the promise. Promises can give us both the security that something is being fully guaranteed and the stress that you are guaranteeing something that cannot be verified at that given moment. This can create both a positive and a negative effect on our minds.

==Early life==

McShane was born in Blackburn, Lancashire on 29 September 1942. He is the only child of professional footballer Harry (1920–2012) and Irene McShane (née Cowley; 1922–2020). His father was Scottish, from Holytown, Lanarkshire. His mother, who was born in England, was of Irish and English descent. McShane grew up in Davyhulme, Manchester and attended Stretford Grammar School. After being a member of the National Youth Theatre, he studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), with Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt.

He later played Satan in the York Mystery Plays in 1963.

==Career==

In the United Kingdom, McShane&#x27;s best known role is antiques dealer Lovejoy in the eponymous series (1986-1994). Long before &quot;Lovejoy&quot;, McShane was a pin-up as a result of appearances in television series, such as &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1967, as Heathcliff), &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977, as Judas Iscariot), and &quot;Disraeli&quot; (1978)—as well as films like &quot;Sky West and Crooked&quot; (1965), &quot;If It&#x27;s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium&quot;, &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (both 1969), &quot;Pussycat, Pussycat, I Love You&quot; (1970), &quot;Sitting Target&quot; (1972), &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Fifth Musketeer&quot; (1979). The actor also enjoyed success in the United States as British film director Don Lockwood in &quot;Dallas&quot;.

In the United States, he is known for the role of historical figure Al Swearengen in the HBO series &quot;Deadwood&quot;, for which he won the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Drama. He was also nominated at the 2005 Emmy Award and Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Among science fiction fans, McShane is known for playing Robert Bryson in &quot;Babylon 5: The River of Souls&quot;. In a 2004 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, McShane stated that he wished he had turned down the role of Bryson as he had struggled with the technical dialogue and found looking at Martin Sheen, who was wearing an eye in the middle of his forehead, to be the most embarrassing experience that he had ever had while acting.

In 1985, McShane appeared as an MC on Grace Jones&#x27; &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;, a concept album which featured his narration interspersed throughout and which sold over a million copies worldwide.

In 1992, he recorded and released his own solo studio album, &quot;From Both Sides Now&quot;, which features McShane singing cover versions of popular songs. The album reached number 40 in the UK Albums Chart.
His other roles include that of armed robber and gangland boss Jack Last in the &quot;Minder&quot; episode &quot;The Last Video Show.&quot; As Captain Hook in &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;, Ragnar Sturlusson in &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, Tai Lung in &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; (for which he received an Annie Award nomination), crime boss Teddy Bass in &quot;Sexy Beast&quot;, and Mr. Bobinsky in &quot;Coraline&quot;. In live-action, he has performed in &quot;Hot Rod&quot;, the action/thriller &quot;Death Race&quot;, and &quot;The Seeker&quot;. He has appeared in &quot;The West Wing&quot; as a Russian diplomat. During 2007–08, he starred as Max in the 40th anniversary Broadway revival of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, co-starring Eve Best, Raúl Esparza, and Michael McKean, and directed by Daniel Sullivan, at the Cort Theatre (16 December 2007 – 13 April 2008).

In 2009, he appeared in &quot;Kings&quot;, which was based on the biblical story of David. His portrayal of King Silas Benjamin, an analogue of King Saul, was highly praised with one critic saying: &quot;Whenever &quot;Kings&quot; seems to falter, McShane appears to put bite marks all over the scenery.&quot;

In 2010, McShane starred in &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; as Bishop Waleran Bigod. The series was a historical drama set in 12th-century England and adapted from Ken Follett&#x27;s novel of the same name. That same year, it was confirmed that McShane would portray Blackbeard in the Walt Disney Company/Jerry Bruckheimer film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;.

In 2013, he played King Brahmwell in Bryan Singer&#x27;s &quot;Jack the Giant Slayer&quot;.

Since 2010, McShane has narrated the opening teases for each round of ESPN&#x27;s coverage of The Open Championship.

If they don&#x27;t deliver [a finished product], blame them,&quot; McShane said. began production in October 2018. &quot;&quot; was released on 31 May 2019, concluding the story of the series.

<text>Oz Squad is a comic book series using characters and setting from L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Land of Oz series, &quot;updated for a more adult audience&quot;.

==Publication==
The original series ran for ten issues from 1991 to 1996. The first four were illustrated by Andrew Murphy, inked by Daniel Schaffer, and published by Brave New Words, which also later reprinted the first two issues with alternative covers. Millennium Publications then produced a 48-page &quot;Oz Squad Special&quot;. Finally, Ahlquist and some friends created Patchwork Press to carry on publishing the book. Terry Loh drew the last six issues, and Mike Sagara illustrated a &quot;Little Oz Squad&quot; special.

Ahlquist published a new Oz Squad novel in 2011, &quot;Oz Squad: March of the Tin Soldiers&quot;.

==Plot==
The series adapts the mythology that Baum had created in the original children&#x27;s books and updates it with the intention of appealing to a more adult audience.

&quot;Oz Squad&quot;″s first issue featured Tik-Tok&#x27;s becoming insane and violent after his &quot;internal clockwork morality spring&quot; runs down during a visit to Earth (it would run down more rarely in Oz, where decisions are more &quot;black and white&quot;). Later issues featured an assault on the hideout of Rebecca Eastwitch (the Wicked Witch of the East) at Castle Munchausen, and a series of time travel adventures in which the Scarecrow met Leonardo da Vinci and Joan of Arc, Dorothy found herself in the American Old West, and Nick met himself while still a human. The series ended with Dorothy Gale revealing that she is pregnant to Princess Ozma.

In the 2011 &quot;Oz Squad: March of the Tin Soldiers&quot;, the Squad is in conflict with Rebecca Eastwitch and introduces Ozzy, Dorothy and Ozma&#x27;s son.

===Reviews===
The series provoked a strong negative response from many fans of Baum&#x27;s Oz. Pittsburg State University English professor Steven J. Teller reviewed it for &quot;The Baum Bugle&quot; and considered it worthless and disgusting.

When the series was reprinted, the &quot;Bugle&quot; was much kinder to it, and referred to Teller&#x27;s review, suggesting that with the Oz books so recently having fallen into the public domain, there was little else like it, but post-&quot;&quot;, it seems groundbreaking and not nearly as outrageous as it did at the time.

<doc id="638375" wikidata="Q2089676" url="?curid=638375" title="Seacat (missile)">
<text>Seacat was a British short-range surface-to-air missile system intended to replace the ubiquitous Bofors 40 mm gun aboard warships of all sizes. It was the world&#x27;s first operational shipboard point-defence missile system, and was designed so that the Bofors guns could be replaced with minimum modification to the recipient vessel and (originally) using existing fire-control systems. A mobile land-based version of the system was known as Tigercat.

The initial GWS.20 version was manually controlled, in keeping with the need for a rapidly developed and deployed system. Several variants followed; GWS.21 added radar-cued manual control for night and bad-weather use, GWS.22 added a SACLOS automatic guidance mode, and the final GWS.24 had fully automatic engagement. Tigercat saw relatively brief service before being replaced in British service by the Rapier, while Seacat saw longer service until being replaced by Sea Wolf and newer technology close-in weapons systems.

Seacat and Tigercat were both successful in the export market and some remain in service.

==History==
Seacat traces its history to the Short Brothers of Belfast SX-A5 experiments to convert the Malkara anti-tank missile to radio control as a short-range surface-to-air missile. This led to further modifications as the Green Light prototype, and finally emerged as Seacat.

As it was based on an anti-tank weapon, the Seacat was small and flew at relatively slow, subsonic speeds. It was thought to be useful against first and second generation 1950s jet aircraft of Hawker Sea Hawk performance, which were proving to be too difficult for the WWII-era Bofors 40 mm L/60 guns to successfully intercept. Another system, Orange Nell, was being developed for this role, but was cancelled when the Navy concluded it would not be effective against its intended targets, newer high-performance strike aircraft.

The first public reference to the name &quot;Seacat&quot; was April 1958, when Shorts was awarded a contract to develop a close-in short-range surface-to-air missile. Royal Navy acceptance of Seacat as a point defence system, to replace the 40/L60 or the newer and more effective Bofors 40mm /L70 with proximity fuzed shells. It would also be useful against large, slow anti-shipping missiles, like the Styx, which was being deployed by the Warsaw Pact and various clients of the Soviet Union. It was also seen as offering useful secondary roles as a lightweight weapon to use against light commercial shipping and fast attack craft.

The missile was shown for the first time to the general public at the 1959 Farnborough Air Show. The first acceptance trials of the Seacat on a warship was in 1961 aboard . The Seacat became the first operational guided missile to be fired by a warship of the Royal Navy. Later it was adopted by the Swedish Navy, making it the first British guided missile to be fired by a foreign navy.

==Design==
The Seacat is a small, subsonic missile powered by a two-stage solid fuel rocket motor. It is steered in flight by four cruciformly arranged swept wings and is stabilised by four small tail fins. It is guided by command line-of-sight (CLOS) via a radio-link; i.e., flight commands are transmitted to it from a remote operator with both the missile and target in sight. In some senses it was no more than an initially unguided subsonic rocket that took the controller about 7 seconds or flight time to acquire and lock onto radar tracking and optical direction, making it unsuitable for close-in AA defence.

Seacat was mounted on a powered four-round launcher which was smaller than the Mark 5 Twin Bofors and STAAG type mountings it replaced. It was also lighter, easier to maintain, and very easy to use.

==Variants==
Initially, all Seacat installations used a 4-round, trainable launcher, but a 3-round, launcher was later developed. Both launchers were manually reloaded and carried an antenna for the radio command link. All that was required to fit the system to a ship was the installation of a launcher, the provision of a missile handling room and a suitable guidance system. Seacat was used by NATO and Commonwealth navies that purchased British equipment and was exported worldwide. It has also been integrated with a variety of alternative guidance systems, the most common being Dutch HSA systems. The four systems used by the Royal Navy are described below.

===GWS-20===


This - &quot;Guided Weapon System 20&quot; - was the initial system, which was intended to replace the twin 40 mm Bofors Mark V gun and its associated fire-control systems. The original director was based on the Simple Tachymetric Director (STD) and was entirely visual in operation. The target was acquired visually with the missile being guided, via a radio link, by the operator inputting commands on a joystick. Flares on the missile&#x27;s tail fins aided identifying the missile.

&#x27;s GWS-20 was trialled on board HMS &quot;Decoy&quot;, a destroyer, in 1961; it was subsequently removed. It was carried in active service by the landing ships, the Type 12M (&quot;Rothesay&quot;-class) and Type 12I (&quot;Leander&quot;-class) frigates, the Type 61 (Salisbury-class) air defence frigates HMS &quot;Lincoln&quot; and HMS &quot;Salisbury&quot;, and the first group of s. HMS &quot;Kent&quot; and HMS &quot;London&quot; updated to GWS22 in the early 1970s. It was originally intended that all destroyers should receive GWS20, and the class were prepared accordingly. In the event only and HMS &quot;Caprice&quot; received it, in 1966 refits.

GWS-20 saw active service in the Falklands war on board the &quot;Fearless&quot; class and the &quot;Rothesay&quot; frigates and , who retained the GWS-20 director when upgraded to GWS-22.

===GWS-21===
GWS-21 was the Seacat system associated with a modified Close Range Blind Fire analogue fire control director (CRBFD) with Type 262 radar. This offered manual radar-assisted (&quot;Dark Fire&quot;) tracking and guidance modes as well as &#x27;eyeball&#x27; visual modes. It was carried as the design anti-aircraft weapon of the Type 81 (Tribal-class) frigate, the four AD conversions, on the first four County-class destroyers, HMNZS &quot;Otago&quot; and HMNZS &quot;Taranaki&quot;, and the carrier HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;. It was last used after sale to the Indonesian Navy and refit by Vosper Thornycroft in 1984 of, the Type 81s &quot;Tartar&quot;, &quot;Ashanti&quot; and &quot;Gurkha&quot;.

===GWS-22===
GWS-22 was the Seacat system associated with the full MRS-3 fire control director with Type 904 radar and was the first ACLOS-capable (Automatic, Command Line-Of-Sight) Seacat. It was fitted to most of the &quot;Leander&quot;, &quot;Rothesay&quot; and County-class escorts as they were refitted and modified in the 1970s, as well as the aircraft carrier . It could operate in automatic radar-guided (&quot;Blindfire&quot;), manual radar-guided, manual CCTV-guided or, in an emergency, &#x27;eyeball&#x27; guided modes. It saw active service in the Falklands onboard all these classes.

===GWS-24===
The final Royal Navy Seacat variant, this used the Italian Alenia Orion RTN-10X fire control system with Type 912 radar and was fitted only to the Type 21 frigate. This variant saw active service in the Falklands.

===Tigercat===
A land-based mobile version of Seacat based on a three-round, trailer-mounted launcher towed by a Land Rover with a second trailer carrying fire control equipment. Tigercat was used exclusively by 48 Squadron RAF Regiment between 1967 and 1978, before being replaced by Rapier. Tigercat was also operated by; India, Iran, Jordan, South Africa and Qatar and saw limited service in the 1982 Falklands War with Argentina.

=== Hellcat ===
&quot;Hellcat&quot;, an air-to-surface version to give British Westland Wasp or Westland Wessex HU.5 helicopters a capability against fast attack craft and other high-speed naval targets, was considered in the late 1960s. Two missiles would be carried on a pair of pylons on the helicopter, with an optical sight mounted through the cabin roof. Hellcat was also considered for counter-insurgency (COIN) purposes, with four missiles carried on a militarised Short Skyvan. Despite being offered by Shorts for some years, it does not seem to have been sold.

===Seacat Target===
&quot;Seacat Target&quot;&quot; is a specialised target vehicle based on the Seacat and is used to simulate sea-skimming missiles for practising a ship&#x27;s air defence against. Introduced in 1986 it uses the first and second stages of Seacat with the addition of a special target head in place of the missile&#x27;s warhead. The target missile can be fired from the standard Seacat launcher.

==Service==

The first warship to have the system fitted operationally was the Battle-class destroyer, , in February 1962. The Seacat became obsolete by the 1970s due to increasing aircraft speed and the introduction of supersonic, sea-skimming anti-ship missiles. In these cases, the manually guided subsonic Seacat was totally unsuited to all but head-on interceptions and then only with adequate warning. A Seacat version was tested for intercepting targets flying at high speed near the water surface. This version used a radar altimeter, which kept the missile from being guided below a certain altitude above the surface and hence prevented the operator from flying the missile into the water. This version was never ordered.

===Falklands conflict===
Despite being obsolete, the Seacat was still widely fielded by the Royal Navy at the outbreak of the Falklands War and was the main anti-aircraft defence of many ships. It proved more reliable than the more modern Sea Wolf missile that had been recently introduced, although HMS &quot;Ardent&quot;″s launcher failed at a critical moment when the ship was under air attack. Initial British postwar reports claimed that Seacat had destroyed eight aircraft, but these did not stand up to scrutiny and no &quot;kill&quot; could be solely attributed to the Seacat, despite it being fired on many occasions.

Seacat may have been involved in the destruction of three Argentine A-4C Skyhawks although these aircraft were subjected to the full force of San Carlos air defences; other claims to the same kills include Army Rapier and Blowpipe missiles and ship-based 40 mm gunfire. On 12 June, launched a Seacat at an incoming Exocet missile which may have been deviated by the close detonation, but not enough to cause a miss. The destroyer was hit and heavily damaged in the attack.

Argentina deployed Tigercats from GADA 601. Seven Tigercat launchers were captured by the British after the war, some being ex-RAF units.

After the Falklands conflict, a radical and urgent re-appraisal of anti-aircraft weaponry was undertaken by the Royal Navy. This saw Seacat rapidly withdrawn from service and replaced by modern weapons systems such as the Goalkeeper CIWS, more modern 20 mm and 30 mm anti-aircraft guns and new escorts carrying the Sea Wolf missile, including the vertical launch version.

===Sweden===
GWS-21 missiles were fitted to the four Swedish destroyers under the designation Rb 07, replacing three Bofors L/70 guns (a more modern and heavier variant than the Royal Navy&#x27;s L/60) with a single launcher on each ship. The &quot;Östergötland&quot;-class destroyers, which were of late 1950s origin, were retired in the early 1980s.

===Australia===
Seacat was mounted on all six destroyer escorts of the Royal Australian Navy and was removed from service when the final ship of this class was decommissioned in the late 1990s. In their final variant, fire control was provided by HSA M44 radar/optical directors. Secondary firing positions based on visual tracking of the target through binoculars mounted on a syncro-feedback mount was also available. was the final ship to live fire the system prior to its removal from service; and this was also the only time three missiles were on the launcher and fired in sequence, resulting in one miss and two hits on towed targets.

<text>Charles Edward Durning (February 28, 1923 – December 24, 2012) was an American actor who appeared in over 200 movies, television shows and plays. Durning&#x27;s best-known films include &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973), &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; (1975), &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979), &quot;True Confessions&quot; (1981), &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982), &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990), and &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; (2000). He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for both &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982) and &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1983). Prior to his acting career, Durning served in World War II and was decorated for valor in combat.

==Early life==
Durning was born in Highland Falls, New York. He was the son of Louise (née Leonard; 1894–1982), a laundress at West Point, and James E. Durning (1883 – c. 1935). His father was an Irish immigrant, and his mother was also of Irish descent. Durning was raised Catholic. Durning was the ninth of ten children. His three brothers – James (known as Roger, 1915–2000), Clifford (1916–1994), and Gerald (1926–2000) – and his sister Frances (1918–2006) survived to adulthood, but five sisters died from scarlet fever and smallpox as children.

==Military service==
Durning served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was drafted at age 20. Durning landed in France as part of an artillery unit after the D-Day invasion of Normandy. After being wounded by a German anti-personnel mine in the bocage, he spent six months recovering. Durning was reassigned to the 398th Infantry Regiment with the 100th Infantry Division, and participated in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. He was discharged with the rank of private first class on January 30, 1946.

For his valor and the wounds he received during the war, Durning was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts. Additional awards included the Army Good Conduct Medal, the American Campaign Medal and the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with Arrowhead device and two bronze service stars, and the World War II Victory Medal. His badges included the Combat Infantryman Badge, Expert Badge with Rifle Bar and Honorable Service Lapel Pin.

Durning received the French National Order of the Legion of Honor from the French Consul in Los Angeles in April 2008.

===Veteran groups and spokesman===
Durning participated in various functions to honor American veterans, including serving as Chairman of the U.S. National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans. He was an honored guest speaker for 17 years at the National Memorial Day Concert televised by PBS every year on the Sunday evening of Memorial Day weekend.

Durning was paid a special tribute at the May 26, 2013, National Memorial Day Concert when &quot;Taps&quot; was sounded in his honor.

==Acting career==

While pursuing an acting career, Durning, a professional ballroom dancer, taught at Fred Astaire Dance Studio in New York City.

Durning began his career in 1951. While working as an usher in a burlesque theatre, he was hired to replace a drunken actor on stage. Subsequently, he performed in roughly 50 stock company productions and in various off-Broadway plays, eventually attracting the attention of Joseph Papp, founder of The Public Theater and the New York Shakespeare Festival. Beginning in 1961, he appeared in 35 plays as part of the Shakespeare Festival. &quot;That time in my life was my best time,&quot; Durning told Pittsburgh&#x27;s &quot;Post Gazette&quot; in 2001. &quot;I had no money at all, and he [Joseph Papp] didn&#x27;t pay much. You were getting a salary for performance plus a rehearsal salary. We would do three plays in Central Park for the summer. And then you&#x27;d do three to six plays every year down on Lafayette Street – new plays by new writers: Sam Shepard, David Mamet, David Rabe, John Ford Noonan, Jason Miller.&quot;

During this period, he segued into television and movies. He made his film debut in 1965, appearing in &quot;Harvey Middleman, Fireman&quot;. He appeared in John Frankenheimer&#x27;s &quot;I Walk the Line&quot; (1970) starring Gregory Peck, and three Brian De Palma movies: &quot;Hi, Mom!&quot; (1970, as Charles Durnham), &quot;Sisters&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Fury&quot; (1978). He also appeared in &quot;&quot; (1972) with Barbara Hershey and John Lithgow.

Durning&#x27;s performances in Broadway productions include &quot;Drat! The Cat!&quot; (1965), &quot;Pousse-Café&quot; (1966), &quot;The Happy Time&quot; (1968), &quot;Indians&quot; (1969), &quot;That Championship Season&quot; (1972), &quot;In the Boom Boom Room&quot; (1973), &quot;The Au Pair Man&quot; (1973), &quot;Knock Knock&quot; (1976), &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1990), &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1996), &quot;The Gin Game&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Best Man&quot; (2000).

In 2002, he performed in Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot; with Al Pacino, produced by Tony Randall. He played the role of Jack Jameson in Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s final play, &quot;Third&quot; (2005), with Dianne Wiest at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Mitzi E. Newhouse Theatre.

Durning won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for his powerful performance in The Westwood Playhouse&#x27;s 1977 production of David Rabe&#x27;s &quot;Streamers&quot;. In 1980, he won critical acclaim for his performance as Norman Thayer, Jr. in Los Angeles&#x27;s Ahmanson Theater&#x27;s production of &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; opposite Julie Harris.

In 1972, director George Roy Hill, impressed by Durning&#x27;s performance in the Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;That Championship Season&quot;, offered him a role in &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973). In the Best Picture-winner, starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, Durning won distinction as a crooked cop, Lt. Wm. Snyder, who polices and hustles professional con artists. He doggedly pursues the young grifter, Johnny Hooker (Redford), only to become the griftee in the end. Other film credits include &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; with Al Pacino; &quot;When A Stranger Calls&quot;; &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;; &quot;The Hindenburg&quot;; &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; with Burt Lancaster; &quot;True Confessions&quot; with Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall. Some television credits include &quot;The Connection&quot;; &quot;Queen of the Stardust Ballroom&quot;, the made-for-television musical in which he played the mailman who reaches out to Maureen Stapleton&#x27;s lonely widow on the dance floor; &quot;Attica&quot;; PBS&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Bear&quot; with Tyne Daly; the PBS production &quot;I Would Be Called John&quot; as Pope John XXIII; &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame: Casey Stengel&quot;, in which Durning played the legendary baseball manager Charles Dillon &quot;Casey&quot; Stengel; NBC&#x27;s mini-series &quot;Studs Lonigan&quot; with Harry Hamlin and Colleen Dewhurst; &quot;The Best Little Girl in the World&quot; with Jennifer Jason Leigh. In 1976, he received both an Emmy and a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the television mini-series &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot;.

In 1979, he played Doc Hopper, a man who owns a frog leg restaurant and the main antagonist in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;. In &quot;Tootsie&quot;, he played a suitor to Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s cross-dressing lead character. The two actors worked together again in a 1985 TV production of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;.

In 1993, he guest-starred in the Sean Penn-directed music video &quot;Dance with the One That Brought You&quot; by Shania Twain.

Other film roles include Henry Larson, the benevolent father of Holly Hunter&#x27;s character in &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (1995) and Waring Hudsucker in &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994). He worked with the Coen Brothers again playing &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel, a cynical governor of Mississippi (a character loosely based on the Texas politician and showman W. Lee O&#x27;Daniel) in the Coen Brothers&#x27; &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; (2000).

Prior to appearing in the Burt Reynolds&#x27;s TV series, &quot;Evening Shade&quot;, as the town doctor Harlan Eldridge (1990–1994), Durning appeared with Reynolds in five films, beginning with 1979&#x27;s &quot;Starting Over&quot;, followed by 1981&#x27;s &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot;, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Stick&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Hostage Hotel&quot;.

On TV, Durning had a recurring role on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; as the Barone family&#x27;s long-suffering parish priest, Father Hubley. He also played the voice of recurring character Francis Griffin, the religious zealot father of Peter in the animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot;. He appeared on the FX television series &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, playing Mike Gavin, the retired firefighter father of Denis Leary&#x27;s character.

In 2005, he was nominated for an Emmy Award for his portrayal of a Marine veteran in &quot;Call of Silence,&quot; an episode in the television series &quot;NCIS&quot;, first broadcast November 23, 2004. Durning&#x27;s character turns himself in to authorities, insisting that he must be prosecuted for having murdered his buddy during ferocious combat on Iwo Jima six decades earlier. The real truth of the incident only becomes known for certain when the guilt-stricken veteran goes through a cathartic reliving of the battlefield events.

For his numerous roles on television, he earned nine Emmy Award nominations. He also received Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nominations for &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; in 1982 and &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; in 1983. He won a Golden Globe in 1990 for his supporting role in the television miniseries &quot;The Kennedys of Massachusetts&quot;, having had three previous nominations. That same year, he won a Tony Award for his performance as Big Daddy in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. He received two Drama Desk Awards for his performances in &quot;That Championship Season&quot; and &quot;Third&quot;.

In 1999, Durning was inducted into the Theater Hall of Fame on Broadway. He was honored with the Life Achievement Award at the 14th Annual Screen Actors Guild Award Ceremony on January 27, 2008. On July 31, 2008, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame adjacent to one of his idols, James Cagney.

&quot;There are many secrets in us, in the depths of our souls, that we don&#x27;t want anyone to know about,&quot; he told &quot;Parade&quot;. &quot;There&#x27;s terror and repulsion in us, the terrible spot that we don&#x27;t talk about. That place that no one knows about — horrifying things we keep secret. A lot of that is released through acting.&quot;

The Charles Durning Collection is held at the Academy Film Archive. Along with films he appeared in, his collection consists mainly of films he admired as well as a small collection of family home movies.

==Death==
Charles Durning died of natural causes at his home in Manhattan on Christmas Eve December 24, 2012, aged 89. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

On December 27, 2012, Broadway theatres dimmed their lights to honour him. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which commented on Durning&#x27;s more than 200 credited roles, referred to him and actor Jack Klugman, who died the same day, as &quot;extraordinary actors ennobling the ordinary&quot;. The &quot;Huffington Post&quot; compared the two men, calling them &quot;character actor titans&quot;.

<text>The Birmingham Vulcans were a professional American football team located in Birmingham, Alabama. They were members of the five-team Eastern Division of the World Football League (WFL). The Vulcans, founded in March 1975, played in the upstart league&#x27;s second and final season in 1975. The team was owned by a group of Birmingham businessmen with Ferd Weil as team president.

The Vulcans replaced the Birmingham Americans who had held the WFL franchise for Birmingham in 1974, winning World Bowl I in December 1974 before suffering financial collapse. The Vulcans were the best team in the league in 1975 with a 9–3 record and the best at the box office until the league folded 12 weeks into its second season. After the WFL ceased operations, the Vulcans were declared league champions by virtue of having the best record.

When the league folded, Birmingham and the Memphis Grizzlies attempted to get admitted into the National Football League for the 1976 season, although unlike the similar and more extensive effort in Memphis which involved actual cash deposits toward season tickets, it seemed to consist mainly of getting fans to sign a &quot;statement of support&quot; somewhat similar to a petition. When the Memphis effort failed, Vulcans followers were forced to accept the inevitable as well, and efforts to get the team into the more established league were abandoned.

The Vulcans name would be recycled for the Alabama Vulcans, a member of the American Football Association, in 1979.

, two former Vulcans players have been inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. Birmingham native Johnny &quot;Italian Stallion&quot; Musso, who placed 4th in Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the Alabama Crimson Tide, was inducted in the Class of 1989. Larry Willingham, who played for the St. Louis Cardinals and retired for medical reasons in 1973 but made a comeback in 1974 with the Birmingham Americans, was inducted in the Class of 2003. Willingham was also elected to the Auburn Tigers football &quot;1970s Team of the Decade.&quot;
