<text>Gomer Pyle – USMC is an American sitcom that originally aired on CBS from September 25, 1964, to May 2, 1969. The series was a spin-off of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, and the pilot episode was aired as the season finale of the fourth season of its parent series on May 18, 1964. The show ran for a total of 150 half-hour episodes spanning over five seasons, in black-and-white for the first season, and then in color for the remaining four seasons. In 2006, CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount) began releasing the series on DVD. The final season was released in November 2008.

Like its parent series, &quot;Gomer Pyle – USMC&quot; was also a major ratings hit, never placing lower than tenth in the Nielsen ratings, and ended its run as the second-highest-rated series in the United States (only behind &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;). It has enjoyed continued popularity through reruns and DVD releases. The series was created by Aaron Ruben, who also produced the show with Sheldon Leonard and Ronald Jacobs. Filmed and set in California, it stars Jim Nabors as Gomer Pyle, a naïve but good-natured gas station attendant from the town of Mayberry, North Carolina, who enlists in the United States Marine Corps. Frank Sutton plays Gomer&#x27;s high-octane, short-fused Gunnery sergeant Vince Carter, and Ronnie Schell plays Gomer&#x27;s friend Duke Slater. Roy Stuart portrayed Corporal Chuck Boyle, GySgt Carter&#x27;s good-natured sidekick. Allan Melvin played in the recurring role of Gunnery Sergeant Carter&#x27;s rival, Staff Sergeant Charley Hacker.

==History==
Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell, writers for &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, are credited with creating the character of Gomer Pyle. The character was based on an &quot;incompetent&quot; gas station attendant whom Greenbaum met and named after Gomer Cool (a writer) and Denver Pyle (an actor on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;). Jim Nabors was cast to play Gomer; he had been performing for a Santa Monica nightclub, The Horn, when Andy Griffith discovered him. Though originally intended to appear in only one episode, Gomer proved popular, and after appearing in seasons 3 and 4, Nabors was given his own spin-off produced by Aaron Ruben. The pilot episode of &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; was filmed in 1963 as part of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, but was not aired until 1964, as the finale of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;″s fourth season. In the episode, Andy accompanies Gomer when he reports to the Marine recruiting base at Camp Lejeune.

The 1960s saw a return to &quot;the more mundane sensibilities of comedy,&quot; due to viewers&#x27; wishes for television programming to be a &quot;cultural antidepressant.&quot; Thus, fantasy- and rurally-oriented comedies gained popularity and dominated the Nielsen ratings. Like other comedies at the time, &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; was a &quot;deep escapist&quot; show; it avoided political commentary and offered viewers a distraction from the social changes of the 1960s. Despite being a military-themed show and airing during the peak of the Vietnam War, the show never discussed the war. Instead, the show was founded on &quot;Gomer&#x27;s innocent simplicity [and] Sergeant Carter&#x27;s frustration and later concern for Gomer&#x27;s well-being.&quot; This, compounded with the popularity of rural comedies in the 1960s, made the show popular. Frank Sutton, who played Carter, ascribed the show&#x27;s popularity to its concentration on its two main characters, and the plots being built around their respective personalities. The program remained in the top 10 of the ratings throughout its run—in the top three for all but its third season when CBS moved it from Fridays to Wednesdays. Approaching age 40, Nabors quit because he desired to move to something else, &quot;reach for another rung on the ladder, either up or down.&quot;

After &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; left the air, Jim Nabors hosted his own variety show, &quot;The Jim Nabors Hour&quot;, from 1969 to 1971. As well as showcasing Nabors&#x27; singing and rich baritone voice, the show included comedy sketches that featured Nabors&#x27;s &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; co-stars Frank Sutton and Ronnie Schell. Though told that he should not leave &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot;, Nabors felt that the show would still be exciting and noted that every character he portrayed in his sketches &quot;turn[ed] out to be Gomer.&quot;

==Production==
The show was produced by creator Aaron Ruben, &quot;Andy Griffith Show&quot; producer Sheldon Leonard (in partnership with Griffith), and Ronald Jacobs; it was co-produced by Bruce Bayley Johnson and Duke Vincent. Among the writers were Sam Bobrick, Harvey Miller, Aaron Ruben, Jack Elinson, and Bill Idelson; &quot;Andy Griffith Show&quot; writers Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell also wrote episodes. Coby Ruskin was the primary director in the first four seasons, before John Rich took over the role for the fifth season; other directors included Gary Nelson, Peter Baldwin, and Alan Rafkin. Ruth Burch was in charge of the casting, and John Finger directed the cinematography. The theme song was composed by Earle Hagen, who also composed the themes for shows such as &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, and &quot;That Girl&quot;.

The show was filmed at Camp Pendleton, Desilu Studios&#x27;s Desilu-Cahuenga, and RKO Forty Acres backlot, where &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; was filmed. Though Ruben preferred the use of a multiple-camera setup for comedy programs, &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; used a single-camera setup because much of the shooting was conducted outdoors. In his book &quot;And The Show Goes On&quot;, Sheldon Leonard explained that the armed forces offer levels of &quot;cooperation&quot; with filmmakers. Because the Marines felt that the show would be good for the branch&#x27;s image, &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; was given &quot;total cooperation,&quot; meaning that the show was allowed unlimited access to military equipment.

The vehicles in the show were provided by the Chrysler Corporation, as opposed to the parent series&#x27; vehicles that came from the Ford Motor Company. Although Jeeps are also prominent in the show, the brand itself would not become a part of Chrysler until the AMC buyout that occurred in 1987.

Nabors and Sutton were the only actors credited in every episode (however, Sutton did not appear in every episode). Ronnie Schell (who played Duke Slater) left after the third season to star in &quot;Good Morning World&quot;, though he returned for the fifth season, promoted to corporal, after graduating from non-commissioned officer training. Roy Stuart, who played Corporal Chuck Boyle, made his debut in the second season and left after the fourth. Andy Griffith, Frances Bavier, Ron Howard, and George Lindsey made guest appearances on the series reprising their respective roles from &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. Denver Pyle and Allan Melvin, who both had roles on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, appeared in &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot;, but did not reprise their original roles. Denver Pyle, who had played Briscoe Darling in six episodes of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, played tomato farmer Titus Purcell in the &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; episode &quot;The Price of Tomatoes.&quot; Allan Melvin, who had played Clarence &quot;Doc&quot; Malloy and other antagonists on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, played Sergeant Carter&#x27;s rival, Staff Sergeant Hacker, for four seasons. Nabors also carried the Gomer Pyle character to fellow CBS series &quot;The Lucy Show,&quot; in which he made a cameo appearance in a 1966 episode.

Nabors always said he had a hard time watching the show&#x27;s opening credits, as many of the Marines he was filmed training with were later killed in Vietnam.

== Episodes ==

==Premise==

The premise of &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; is similar to and perhaps inspired by Andy Griffith&#x27;s starring role in the Broadway play and film version of &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot;, which was based on the Mac Hyman novel of the same title. Like Leonard&#x27;s other shows, &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; was character-driven; the main characters were &quot;accessible&quot; and &quot;engaging,&quot; and the supporting characters were often eccentric. In the show&#x27;s pilot episode, Gomer, a gas-station attendant from Mayberry, joins the Marines. Gomer&#x27;s naïveté immediately exasperates his drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Carter (Frank Sutton). Originally situated in Camp Wilson in North Carolina, the setting was moved to the fictional Camp Henderson in California. The show was a piece, which, like its contemporary &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, featured rural characters out of their normal settings. Like other comedies of the 1960s, the show avoided political commentary (especially concerning the Vietnam War) and focused instead on the predicaments that ensued from Gomer&#x27;s unintentional breaking of the rules or .

Among the themes explored were the honesty and &quot;strong family values supposedly inherent in small-town life&quot;; according to author Gerard Jones, &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot;&#x27;s basic message was &quot;far simpler than any corporate suburban sitcoms with their lessons in compromise and role-following [...] It said merely that the oldest, most basic, least sophisticated sort of sweetness could redeem even the toughest modern types&quot;. Author Elizabeth Hirschman noted that Gomer represented a &quot;uniquely American archetype&quot;—a &quot;large, powerful man physically&quot; with the &quot;simple, honest nature of a child or animal&quot;. She also noted that, like stories with characters of such an archetype, Gomer&#x27;s trusting nature was often taken advantage of, though in the end he &quot;reaps happiness&quot; because of his innocence. In his book &quot;Watching M*A*S*H, Watching America&quot;, media and communications scholar James Wittebols said that &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; illustrated how class differences &quot;supposedly negated or diminished by military training&quot; made themselves apparent in the military world.

==Characters==

Gomer Pyle (played by Jim Nabors), from Mayberry, North Carolina, is a good-natured and innocent private whose naïveté constantly annoys his drill instructor, Sergeant Carter. Eventually, however, his &quot;unquestioning love and trust of the world&quot; lead those in his platoon to befriend him. His good nature attracts the friendship of women; meanwhile, in so far as Carter&#x27;s abrasiveness repels women, Gomer is in the position of salvaging numerous social occasions by charming the women whose opinions are important to officers at the Marine base. Gomer was created as a stereotype of a rural American; according to &quot;Time&quot;, he &quot;wears a gee-whiz expression, spouts out of a lopsided mouth and lopes around uncertainly like a plowboy stepping through a field of cow dung. He is a walking disaster area.&quot; Though never promoted beyond private first class during the show&#x27;s run, Jim Nabors (who played Gomer) was given an honorary promotion to lance corporal in 2001, to corporal in 2007, and then to sergeant in 2013 by the Marines.


Vince Carter (played by Frank Sutton), a gunnery sergeant from Kansas, is Gomer&#x27;s irritable, abrasive, and socially inept drill instructor (later his platoon sergeant) who is constantly annoyed by Gomer&#x27;s well-intentioned mistakes. Carter disdains Gomer&#x27;s country idiosyncrasies (&quot;golly!&quot; &quot;Shazam!&quot; &quot;surprise, surprise, surprise!&quot;). He is also put off by Gomer&#x27;s expectation that the platoon should be a family, of which Carter is the father figure: As much as Carter wants their working relationship to be temporary, as is common in the military, Gomer expects a life-long friendship, which exasperates Carter. Due to the audience&#x27;s demand for more family-oriented programming, he eventually revealed his softer side: Carter became a father figure to Gomer as well as his best friend. Sutton stated that his character was created &quot; for the show&quot; and, as the actor played him &quot;by ear,&quot; Carter greatly changed during the first season. Barbara Stuart played his girlfriend &quot;Miss Bunny&quot; for three seasons.

Mark Slade appeared in eight episodes in 1964 in the role of &quot;Eddie&quot; though in the first of those appearances he was billed as &quot;Private Swanson.&quot;

Duke Slater (played by Ronnie Schell) is Gomer&#x27;s friend and platoon-mate. Schell left the show in the fourth season to star in the short-lived show &quot;Good Morning, World&quot; but returned in the final season as the corporal of Gomer&#x27;s platoon.

Chuck Boyle (played by Roy Stuart) is Gomer&#x27;s corporal. He often serves as Carter&#x27;s conscience and sticks up for Gomer when Sergeant Carter is annoyed over his mistakes. Stuart debuted in the second season and left the show after the fourth season; Boyle was replaced by Duke Slater as corporal for the final season.

Lou-Ann Poovie (played by Elizabeth MacRae) is Gomer&#x27;s girlfriend. She debuts in the third season as a singer for a nightclub, but leaves the job at Gomer&#x27;s urging to return home to Turtle Creek, North Carolina, and marry her beau Monroe Efford. In a later episode in the same season, she returns to California and reveals that she called the wedding off. At the end of the episode, she reveals that she wants Gomer to be her boyfriend, to the dismay of Carter and Duke. After she loses her job at the nightclub, Gomer finds her a job as a salesclerk at a record shop.

==Legacy==
In the song &quot;Nobody Home&quot; from Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;The Wall&quot;, an audio clip of Pyle saying his signature line &quot;Surprise, surprise, surprise!&quot; can be heard. The audio clip, however, is not present in the 1982 film.

In Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, the nickname &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; is given to Private Leonard Lawrence (played by Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio) as a derogatory term during boot camp, after incurring the drill instructor&#x27;s wrath for being unable to turn off his idiot&#x27;s grin and his perceived incompetence.

A brief clip of the show airing on American Forces Vietnam Network television appears during the military hospital scene in the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. In the scene, Gump is scolded for watching the show by a fellow soldier who calls it &quot;stupid shit&quot;.

<text>Joseph Lee Henry (born December 2, 1960) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. He has released 15 studio albums and produced multiple recordings for other artists, including three Grammy Award-winning albums.

==Early life==
Henry was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, the state where his parents, whom he described as devout Christians, were also from. He grew up in Oakland Township, Michigan, and attended Rochester Community Schools. He graduated from Rochester Adams High School, then graduated from the University of Michigan.

==Career==
===1985 to 2005===
Henry moved to Brooklyn, New York in 1985 and began performing in local music venues. He released his first album &quot;Talk of Heaven&quot; in 1986. The album earned him a recording contract with A&amp;M, which subsequently released the albums &quot;Murder of Crows&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Shuffletown&quot; in 1990. &quot;Shuffletown,&quot; produced by T Bone Burnett, represented a shift in musical direction towards the &quot;alt country&quot; genre. Henry&#x27;s next two recordings, &quot;Short Man&#x27;s Room&quot; (1992) and &quot;Kindness of the World&quot; (1993), featured members of the country-rock band the Jayhawks. The song &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; was recorded by Joan Baez in 2003 and Gov&#x27;t Mule in 2005. For his 1996 album &quot;Trampoline,&quot; Henry incorporated guitarist Page Hamilton of Helmet and a reviewer at &quot;Trouserpress&quot; called the album &quot;idiosyncratic broadmindedness.&quot;

1999&#x27;s &quot;Fuse&quot; was recorded with producers Daniel Lanois and T Bone Burnett. The album was called an &quot;atmospheric marvel&quot; by one reviewer and Ann Powers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: Henry has &quot;found the sound that completes his verbal approach.&quot;

&quot;Scar,&quot; released in 2001, featured jazz musicians Marc Ribot, Brian Blade, Brad Mehldau and saxophonist Ornette Coleman on &quot;Richard Pryor Addresses a Tearful Nation.&quot; According to AllMusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek, the album is a &quot;triumph not only for Henry—who has set a new watermark for himself—but for American popular music, which so desperately needed something else to make it sing again.&quot;

2003&#x27;s self-produced &quot;Tiny Voices&quot; album was Henry&#x27;s first recording on Epitaph&#x27;s Anti- label. AllMusic&#x27;s Jurek described this album as &quot;the sound of...electric guitars in an abandoned yet fully furnished Tiki bar in Raymond Chandler&#x27;s Los Angeles.&quot;

Henry&#x27;s wife talked him into letting her send Madonna, who is her sister, a demo of his song &quot;Stop,&quot; which was reworked and recorded as &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; (from Madonna&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Music&quot;). Henry&#x27;s own tango-tinged version of the song appeared on &quot;Scar&quot; and was featured in an episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Henry and his sister-in-law recorded a duet, &quot;Guilty by Association,&quot; on the charity album &quot;Sweet Relief II: Gravity of the Situation,&quot; and collaborated on the songs &quot;Jump&quot; on &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor,&quot; &quot;Devil Wouldn&#x27;t Recognize You&quot; on &quot;Hard Candy,&quot; and &quot;Falling Free&quot; on &quot;MDNA.&quot;

In the early 2000s, Henry was an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards&#x27; judging panel to support independent artists.

===2006 to present===

After producing the Grammy-award-winning album &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up on Me&quot; by Solomon Burke, Henry produced additional records and in 2006 opened up a home studio where he often collaborates with recording engineer Ryan Freeland and Los Angeles-based musicians such as Jay Bellerose, Greg Leisz, David Piltch, Patrick Warren and Keefus Ciancia. In September 2006, Henry and Loudon Wainwright III began composing the music for the Judd Apatow movie &quot;Knocked Up&quot; in Henry&#x27;s home studio. Some instrumentals were used as background score for the film while other songs appeared on Wainwright&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Strange Weirdos&quot; which Henry produced.

In 2007, Henry released &quot;Civilians,&quot; which was described as &quot;a rich, acoustic affair that returns us to Henry&#x27;s rootsier sounds&quot;. The final track on the album, &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; was used in a &quot;TCM Remembers 2008&quot; TV commercial. Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Slipstream,&quot; which Henry produced, contained versions of two songs from &quot;Civilians.&quot;

In 2009, Henry released his ninth solo record, &quot;Blood from Stars&quot; which incorporates orchestral blues with guitarist Marc Ribot, pianist Jason Moran and his son, Levon Henry, on saxophone. The album focuses on facets of blues with a sprinkling of jazz, rock and pop and traces the rugged history of American storytelling.&quot;

In May 2011, Henry released the album &quot;Reverie&quot; with simple acoustic instrumention on guitar, upright bass, piano and drums. &quot;When you listen to &quot;Reverie&quot;, especially on headphones, you can hear traffic in the background or a neighbor calling her dog. It&#x27;s not always a pristine recording environment. Henry not only left the windows open at his basement studio, but also put microphones on them.&quot; &quot;But there was this singer-songwriter environment, this post-Dylan fallout, of people who think that pages of your diary set to music are songs, and that the more &#x27;honest&#x27; songs are, the better they are. And that&#x27;s the greatest misconception of American popular music: that if you&#x27;re being honest, you&#x27;re being entertaining.&quot;

In June 2014, Henry released his thirteenth album, &quot;Invisible Hour&quot;. It was recorded at his LA home studio, The Garfield House, in 2013 with his regular band of musicians (Jay Bellerose, Jennifer Condos, Levon Henry, Greg Leisz, John Smith, and David Piltch). Guests providing backing vocals on the album included The Milk Carton Kids and Lisa Hannigan. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine described it as &quot;11 impossibly beautiful songs&quot; and &quot;Joe Henry&#x27;s masterpiece&quot;.

In October 2017, Henry released &quot;Thrum.&quot;

In June 2019, Henry recorded what was intended to be demos of 13 new songs. Those demos became his 15th studio album, &quot;The Gospel According To Water&quot;, which was released on November 15, 2019.

==Reception==
Henry has been described as &quot;a modest-selling &#x27;critic&#x27;s darling&#x27; with a reputation for pushing the envelope&quot; and who writes &quot;songs [that] don&#x27;t fit into an easily defined box&quot; and instead is influenced by folk, blues, jazz, rock and country.

==Personal life==
Henry married Melanie Ciccone in 1987. They have two children. Melanie is the sister of Madonna.

In 2013, Henry and his brother David released a biography of Richard Pryor, titled &quot;Furious Cool: Richard Pryor and the World That Made Him&quot;.

Joe Henry and his family moved out of their home (and his long-time recording space), The Garfield House, in early 2015.

In May 2019 Joe Henry revealed that a few months earlier he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer. He further advised that he has responded well to the treatment he has received, and that his prognosis for now is very encouraging.

<text>Gomer Pyle is a fictional character played by Jim Nabors and introduced in the middle of the third season of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;.

A naive and gentle auto mechanic, he became a recurring character with the January 1963 episode &quot;Man in a Hurry&quot;. Nabors played Pyle for 23 episodes, from 1962 to 1964.

After two seasons on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, the character was spun off to &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; in 1964, which ran until 1969.

==Character==

Gomer is a naïve, extremely moral auto mechanic turned United States Marine Corps private, from Mayberry, North Carolina. The only apparent employee at Wally&#x27;s Filling Station, he initially lived there in a back room, and according to Andy, was &quot;saving up for college&quot; and wanted to be a doctor. Wide-eyed and slack-jawed, he usually wore a service-station uniform and a baseball cap with an upturned bill; a handkerchief dangled from his back pocket. He initially displayed scant knowledge of automotive mechanics; in &quot;The Great Filling Station Robbery&quot;, for example, he thought a carburetor was a hood ornament. In the same episode, he admitted all he knew how to do was fill cars with gas, oil, water, and air, but he learned over time. In other episodes, he was able to diagnose mechanical problems for the average layperson. In his first appearance, the episode &quot;The Bank Job&quot;, Gomer is shown operating a blow torch to cut through a bank&#x27;s vault. In another episode, Gomer diagnoses a problem with a car belonging to an out-of-town visitor who is delayed by a mechanical breakdown. In &quot;Barney&#x27;s First Car&quot;, Andy calls Gomer to tow Barney&#x27;s disabled car, implying that Gomer knows how to operate Wally&#x27;s tow truck. In &quot;Gomer the House Guest&quot;, Wally fires Gomer, causing Gomer to move in with Andy. Wally&#x27;s former customers then bring their cars to Andy&#x27;s house so Gomer can diagnose mechanical problems and repair them. Realizing the success of his business depends on Gomer, Wally rehires him.

Like his cousin Goober, Gomer provided comic relief, awestruck by the simplest of things, resulting in the exclamation of his catchphrases, &quot;Shazam!&quot;, &quot;Golly&quot;, &quot;Sur-prise, sur-prise, sur-prise!&quot;, and &quot;shame, shame, shame!&quot;, as appropriate.
Gomer was sometimes deputized by Deputy Barney Fife, when Sheriff Taylor was otherwise occupied. Though always compliant, Gomer&#x27;s ineptitude usually made him more of a hindrance than a help in the line of duty. In the eyes of his friends, though, especially Sheriff Andy Taylor, his shortcomings were generally outweighed by his gentle, generous spirit.

In the last episode of the fourth season, Gomer tells Andy he has joined the Marines, because he realized he would eventually be drafted into military service.

Gomer&#x27;s Mayberry roots were evident in the spin-off series &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, where his countrified, backward nature served as the mainstay for the show&#x27;s humor, making him a comic foil to the hard-nosed drill instructor (later platoon sergeant) Gunnery Sergeant Vince Carter, played by Frank Sutton. Both series also included several episodes displaying Gomer&#x27;s skill as a baritone singer. This skill ultimately takes Gomer to Washington, DC, along with Sgt. Carter, in the 1967 episode &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, in which Gomer, backed by the Marine Corps Band, performs for an audience that includes the President. In one episode, Gomer stated that his birthday was on February 26.

At first, Sergeant Carter was rankled and &quot;extremely&quot; irritated by the slow-witted Pyle, and dreamed of ways to rid himself of the private&#x27;s presence. Over the course of the series, however, Carter began to tolerate Pyle, and even grew to respect him. Pyle, though always unconventional, developed into a good Marine, yet never went an episode without causing some degree of irritation for Carter. In the 1967 episode &quot;Gomer the Welsh Rarebit Fiend&quot;, Gomer&#x27;s appetite for welsh rarebit induces sleepwalking, during which Gomer derides and berates Sgt. Carter in a reversal of roles. In the final episode, Gomer requests a transfer after realizing he is nothing but a source of constant anxiety for Carter. Carter, initially pleased with the request, later arranges for the transfer to be denied, and the episode ends with Carter insisting the two shake hands, not knowing Gomer&#x27;s hand is covered in shellac.

Gomer’s dating life begins on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; in the December, 1963 episode &quot;A Date for Gomer&quot;, when he agrees to take Thelma Lou’s cousin, Mary Grace, to a town dance. As a Marine, Gomer&#x27;s romantic interest is Lou Ann Poovie, a fellow North Carolinian who came to California for a singing career, although she proves to be tone deaf. Like Gomer, Lou Ann is innocent and naive, and is a willing participant in many of Gomer&#x27;s misadventures. 

Both &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; ended their runs by the late 1960s. While &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; continued from 1968 to 1971, where &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; left off, the concept of returning Gomer to Mayberry was nixed, as the actor was given a CBS variety show of his own (&quot;The Jim Nabors Hour&quot;, which lasted two seasons). Gomer eventually returned, along with most of the original cast of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, to the 1986 television movie &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot;. Gomer and Goober Pyle run a gas station/car repair shop called G &amp; G Garage, implying that Gomer&#x27;s Marine career had, at some point, ended.

Jim Nabors briefly parodied his role in &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;, playing a character named Homer Lyle.

On an episode of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Lucy Gets Caught Up in the Draft&quot;, Nabors has a cameo role as Gomer Pyle.

When both &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; were running on CBS first run, an annual crossover aired between the series – with a character played by Burnett appearing on &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, and Nabors appearing on Burnett&#x27;s variety show on the first episode of every season.

==Cultural impact==

The term &quot;gomer&quot; has entered the English lexicon, usually meaning &quot;stupid person&quot; or &quot;fool,&quot; especially if a coworker or trainee. During the Vietnam War, it was used to refer to Vietnamese soldiers. The OED attributes the &quot;stupid person&quot; meaning to Gomer Pyle, though scholars note that &quot;gomerel&quot; meant &quot;fool&quot; in English dialects outside the United States long before Gomer Pyle appeared on television.

San Antonio has a street named Gomer Pyle Drive.

* In the film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; by Stanley Kubrick, the nickname &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; is derisively given to Private Leonard Lawrence (played by Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio) during boot camp, due to Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (played by R. Lee Ermey) objecting to his real name.
* &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; has become U.S.M.C. slang for a recruit who continually messes up or needs extra training.
* In the 1992 film &quot;White Men Can&#x27;t Jump&quot;, Billy Hoyle (played by Woody Harrelson) refers to a rival basketball player as &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; after being called &quot;Opie Taylor&quot;.

All voices are, of course, by Robin Williams as DJ Adrian Cronauer

<text>Hendrik &quot;Henri&quot; de Man (17 November 1885 – 20 June 1953) was a Belgian politician and leader of the Belgian Labour Party (POB-BWP). He was one of the leading socialist theoreticians of his period and, during the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, played a limited role in collaboration.

==World War I and the interwar period==
A politically active socialist, he nevertheless fought with the Belgian army and supported the Allied cause in World War I. After the war, he taught sociology for a time at the University of Washington, then started a workers&#x27; education school in Belgium, before moving back to Germany where he taught for some years at the University of Frankfurt. He was at odds there with the predominant, leftwing and communist movements surrounding some of his colleagues. He was allied with Eugen Diederichs, a conservative publisher in Jena. Henri de Man&#x27;s antisemitism, expressed openly in his memoir of 1941, &quot;Après Coup&quot;, developed during his years in Germany, although he lived in marriage with at least one Jewish woman (Après Coup, Brussels: Éditions de la Toison d&#x27;Or, 1941).

Returning to Belgium after the Reichstag fire (his books were not popular with Hitler, and de Man was always a maverick relative to others&#x27; ideologies) he became Vice President of the Belgian Labour Party (POB-BWP). Upon the death of Emile Vandervelde in 1938, he assumed its presidency. He was Minister of Finance from 1936 to 1938.

His views on socialism and his revision of Marxism were controversial. His promotion of the idea of &quot;planisme&quot;, or planning, was widely influential in the early 1930s, in particular among the Non-Conformist Movement in France, a movement also called the Third Way; he was connected briefly to the Personalist Emmanuel Mounier, and even thought of himself as something of a &quot;13th century Thomist&quot;.

The doctrine of Henri de Man intended to overcome the successive crises of capitalism by the nationalization of bank credit and an elevation of the degree of authority of the State in financial affairs, while preserving the structures of a capitalist economic system. The “planism” refuted the socialization of the means of production and the construction of a classless society, but on the contrary sought to encourage the private sector by freeing it from certain monopolies entrusted to the State and making it the protector of free competition and individual initiative. From a tactical point of view, marked by the crushing of the German Social Democrats by Hitler, which he attributes to the defection of the middle classes towards the NSDAP, de Man thought it necessary to move towards a rapprochement with liberal parties.

==Plan de Man==
In 1933 de Man produced a plan which some say was devised to halt the rise of fascism in Belgium, but which most other historians regard as part of his own turn toward fascism — as even de Man&#x27;s own memoirs attest. This became overwhelmingly clear when he served as &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister of Belgium directly under the Nazi occupation from June 1940. The plan became widely known as &#x27;Het Plan de Man&#x27; and was an example of planism. While some see the plan as comparable to Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal,
others point out that it was quite unlike the New Deal, proposing not a safety net of welfare and other benefits, but an anti-democratic prescription invented by a man disillusioned with democracy and the working class. The de Man Plan would have removed political power from the workers and their unions, leaving them only the appearance of representation, and would have vested power instead in owners and government. When he proposed it on the floor of the parliament, his opponents shouted, &quot;That is pure fascism&quot; in a debate that caused de Man to suffer a stroke on the spot, and paralyzed him for almost three months. Freedom of the press was also to be curtailed by Henri de Man.

==Collaboration==
De Man was an adviser to King Leopold III and his mother, Queen Elisabeth. Having lived extensively in Germany, and &quot;loving&quot; the country as he said, throughout the 1930s in Belgium he advocated accommodating Hitler&#x27;s expansionist policies to save Belgium from the crushing fate it had previously suffered in World War I, the policy that was called appeasement by other democratic nations. After the &quot;capitulation&quot; of the Belgian Army in 1940, he issued a manifesto to POB-BWP members, welcoming the German occupation as a field of neutralist action during the war: &quot;For the working classes and for socialism, this collapse of a decrepit world, far from being a disaster, is a deliverance.&quot;

He was involved in setting up an umbrella trade union, the &quot;Unie van Hand- en Geestesarbeiders&quot;/&quot;Union des Travailleurs Manuels et Intellectuels&quot; (UHGA-UTMI) which would unify the existing trade unions and moreover aim at the integration of manual and intellectual workers. That was branded by longtime socialists a fascist plan, and UHGA-UTMI was considered a fascist organization because workers had little or no control of this &quot;union&quot;. As de Man moved steadily to the right, he also opposed a free press, as he wrote himself in his memoire, entitled &quot;Après Coup&quot;.

During several months, he was (at least in his own eyes) the &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister of Belgium, serving under the German generals Alexander von Falkenhausen and Eggert Reeder, the actual Belgian ministers having all fled the country during the Battle of Belgium to form the Belgian government in exile. Nevertheless, he eventually was mistrusted both by Flemish Nazi collaborators (for his Belgicist views) and by the Nazi authorities, who forbade him to give any more public speeches after Easter 1941. Seeing he had lost his grip on events, he went into self-imposed exile.

==Exile and death==
After leaving Belgium, de Man lived for years in German-occupied Paris seeing his mistress Lucienne Didier; with her in occupied Paris he was part of the circle surrounding Ernst Jünger. However, with the advance of the Allied troops in May 1945, fearing capture, he fled to an Alpine cottage in La Clusaz, in the Haute Savoie region of France. After the liberation, he crossed the border to Switzerland and lived in the Grison mountains near Austria.

He died with his young wife in 1953 in a collision between his car and a train, a death that his son Jan de Man and others thought was probably a suicide. Henri de Man had been depressed and immobilized in Switzerland for years, prevented from returning to Belgium by the threat of trial and imprisonment for treason.

He was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; of treason after the war. His nephew, the literary theorist Paul de Man, became famous in the United States as a leading proponent of literary deconstructionism. After his death in 1983, Paul de Man was found to have written articles for a collaborationist newspaper in Belgium, some of which expressed antisemitic themes. This discovery prompted a broader re-evaluation of Paul de Man&#x27;s work, as well as his relationship to Hendrik, who had been a fatherlike figure to him.

<text>Frank Spencer Sutton (October 23, 1923 – June 28, 1974) was an American actor best remembered for his role as Gunnery Sergeant Vince Carter on the CBS television series &quot;Gomer Pyle – USMC&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Clarksville, Tennessee, Sutton developed an interest in acting, playing his first role at age nine and also starring in the drama club at East Nashville High School, where he graduated in 1941. He later said, &quot;The first time I walked out on a stage, I had a warm feeling. I knew then I wanted to be an actor.&quot;

After high school, Sutton returned to Clarksville to become a radio announcer. During World War II, he volunteered for service in the U.S. Marine Corps, but he was medically rejected due to his color blindness. He then enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in the South Pacific, taking part in 14 assault landings. Sutton was a sergeant who served from 1943 to 1946 in the 6th Infantry Division&#x27;s 293rd Joint Assault Signal Company.

===Combat and Non-Combat Operations===
*1944-1945 Leyte Campaign (1944-45)/Battle of Leyte
*1944-1945 WWII - Asiatic-Pacific Theater/Luzon Campaign (1944-45)
*1945-1945 Luzon Campaign (1944-45)/Battle for Recapture of Bataan
*1945-1945 Luzon Campaign (1944-45)/Battle for Manila
*1945-1946 US Occupation of South Korea

===Military awards and decorations===

==Acting career==
Honorably discharged after the war as a sergeant, he began acting on stage. He attended the Columbia University School of General Studies, graduating &quot;cum laude&quot; with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in drama in 1952.

Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Sutton played small roles in television shows such as &quot;Decoy&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, &quot;87th Precinct&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. He had a continuing role as Cadet Eric Rattison, the great rival of the Polaris Unit manned by the series&#x27; heroes, in &quot;Tom Corbett, Space Cadet&quot; from 1950 to 1955. In 1955, he received his big break in the Academy Award-winning movie &quot;Marty&quot;, in which he played the title character&#x27;s friend, Ralph. He also had a role in &quot;The Satan Bug&quot;, a 1965 spy thriller. He returned to the stage in &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot; in the early 1960s.

Having primarily acted in dramas, Sutton&#x27;s breakthrough role was on &quot;Gomer Pyle – USMC&quot;, a 1964 episode of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, in which he played the cynical and easily exasperated Gunnery Sergeant Vince Carter opposite Jim Nabors&#x27; character Gomer Pyle. This episode was the pilot for a spin-off TV comedy, &quot;Gomer Pyle – USMC&quot;, where Sutton continued the role for five seasons, until the show ended its run in 1969. He also appeared in public service announcements in the role of Gunnery Sergeant Carter. After &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; ceased production, Sutton appeared regularly on Nabors&#x27; variety show &quot;The Jim Nabors Hour&quot; with &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; co-star Ronnie Schell. Sutton played the brother-in-law of Nabors&#x27; character in comedy sketches. Sutton performed in dinner theater, playing, among other roles, the father in &quot;Norman, Is That You?&quot; and made guest appearances on other television programs.

==Personal life and death==
In 1946, Sutton married soap-opera writer Toby M. Igler, with whom he had two children, Joe Sutton and Amanda.

On June 28, 1974, while preparing for a performance in the comedy play &quot;Luv&quot; at the Beverly Barn Dinner Playhouse in Shreveport, Louisiana, Sutton died of a heart attack. He is buried in the Greenwood Cemetery in his hometown of Clarksville, Tennessee.

<text>Forceps (: forceps or considered a plural noun without a singular, often a pair of forceps; the Latin plural &quot;forcipes&quot; is no longer recorded in most dictionaries) are a handheld, hinged instrument used for grasping and holding objects. Forceps are used when fingers are too large to grasp small objects or when many objects need to be held at one time while the hands are used to perform a task. The term &quot;forceps&quot; is used almost exclusively in the fields of biology and medicine. Outside biology and medicine, people usually refer to forceps as tweezers, tongs, pliers, clips or clamps.

Mechanically, forceps employ the principle of the lever to grasp and apply pressure.

Depending on their function, basic surgical forceps can be categorized into the following groups:
# Non-disposable forceps. They should withstand various kinds of physical and chemical effects of body fluids, secretions, cleaning agents, and sterilization methods. 
# Disposable forceps. They are usually made of lower-quality materials or plastics which are disposed after use.

Surgical forceps are commonly made of high-grade carbon steel, which ensures they can withstand repeated sterilization in high-temperature autoclaves. Some are made of other high-quality stainless steel, chromium and vanadium alloys to ensure durability of edges and freedom from rust. Lower-quality steel is used in forceps made for other uses. Some disposable forceps are made of plastic. The invention of surgical forceps is attributed to Stephen Hales.

There are two basic types of forceps: non-locking (often called &quot;thumb forceps&quot; or &quot;pick-ups&quot;) and locking, though these two types come in dozens of specialized forms for various uses. Non-locking forceps also come in two basic forms: hinged at one end, away from the grasping end (colloquially such forceps are called tweezers) and hinged in the middle, rather like scissors. Locking forceps are almost always hinged in the middle, though some forms place the hinge very close to the grasping end. Locking forceps use various means to lock the grasping surfaces in a closed position to facilitate manipulation or to independently clamp, grasp or hold an object.

== Thumb forceps ==


Thumb forceps, known simply as &quot;forceps&quot; in surgical specialties, are commonly held in a pen grip between the thumb and index finger (sometimes also the middle finger), with the top end resting on the first dorsal interosseous muscle at the webspace between the thumb and index finger. Spring tension at the top end holds the grasping ends apart until pressure is applied. This provides an extended pinch and allows the user to easily grasp, manipulate and quickly release small objects or delicate tissue with readily variable pressure. Thumb forceps are used to hold tissue still when applying sutures, to gently move tissues out of the way during exploratory surgery and to access confined cavities that are hard to reach with hands and fingers.

Thumb forceps can have smooth tips, cross-hatched tips or serrated tips (often called &quot;mouse&#x27;s teeth&quot;). Common arrangements of teeth are 1×2 (two teeth on one side meshing with a single tooth on the other), 7×7 and 9×9. Serrated forceps are used on tissue; counter-intuitively, teeth will damage tissue less than a smooth surface because one can grasp with less overall pressure. Smooth or cross-hatched forceps are used to move dressings, remove sutures and similar tasks.

==Locking forceps==
Locking forceps, sometimes called &quot;clamps&quot;, are used to grasp and firmly hold objects or body tissues, or to apply external compression onto tubular structures such as blood vessels or intestines. When they are specifically used to occlude an artery to forestall bleeding, they are called hemostats. Another form of locking forceps is the needle holder, used to guide a suturing needle through tissue. Many locking forceps use finger rings/loops to facilitate handling (see illustration, below, of Kelly forceps). The finger loops are usually grasped by the thumb and middle or (more often) ring finger, while the index finger is placed on the pivot to help stabilize and guide the instrument.

The most common locking mechanism is a handle ratchet, which consists of an asymmetrically serrated short protrusion near the finger loop of one of the handles, and a corresponding hook on the other. As the forceps are closed, the opposing teeth engage and interlock, keeping the handles adducted and the jaw surfaces clamped constantly. To unlock, a simple shearing push by the fingers is all that is needed to disengage the teeth and allow the grasping ends to move apart.

=== Kelly forceps ===

Kelly forceps are a type of hemostat usually made of stainless steel. They resemble a pair of scissors with the blade replaced by a blunted grip. They also feature a locking mechanism to allow them to act as clamps.
Kelly forceps may be floor-grade (regular use) and as such not used for surgery. They may also be sterilized and used in operations, in both human and veterinary medicine. They may be either curved or straight. In surgery, they may be used for occluding blood vessels, manipulating tissues, or for assorted other purposes.
They are named for Howard Atwood Kelly, M.D., first professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
The &quot;mosquito&quot; variant of the tool is more delicate and has smaller, finer tips. Other varieties with similar, if more specialized, uses are Allis clamps, Babcocks, Kochers, Carmalts, and tonsils; all but the last bear the names of the surgeons who designed them.

<text>MOLPRO is a software package used for accurate &quot;ab initio&quot; quantum chemistry calculations. It is developed by Peter Knowles at Cardiff University and Hans-Joachim Werner at Universität Stuttgart in collaboration with other authors.

The emphasis in the program is on highly accurate computations, with extensive treatment of the electron correlation problem through the multireference configuration interaction, coupled cluster and associated methods. Integral-direct local electron correlation methods reduce the increase of the computational cost with molecular size. Accurate ab initio calculations can then be performed for larger molecules. With new explicitly correlated methods the basis set limit can be very closely approached.

==History==
Molpro was designed and maintained by Wilfried Meyer and Peter Pulay in the late 1960s. At that moment, Pulay developed the first analytical gradient code called Hartree-Fock (HF), and Meyer researched his PNO-CEPA (pseudo-natural orbital coupled-electron pair approximation) methods. In 1980, Werner and Meyer developed a new state-averaged, quadratically convergent (MC-SCF) method, which provided geometry optimization for multireference cases. By the same year, the first internally contracted multireference configuration interaction (IC-MRCI) program was developed by Werner and Reinsch. About four years later (1984), Werner and Knowles developed on a new generation program called CASSCF (complete active space SCF). This new CASSCF program combined fast orbital optimization algorithms with determinant-based full CI codes, and additional, more general, unitary group configuration interaction (CI) codes. This resulted in the quadratically convergent MCSCF/CASSCF code called MULTI, which allowed modals to be optimized a weighted energy average of several states, and is capable of treating both completely general configuration expansions. In fact, this method is still available today. In addition to these organizational developments, Knowles and Werner started to cooperate on a new, more efficient, IC-MRCI method. Extensions for accurate treatments of excited states became possible through a new IC-MRCI method. In brief, the present IC-MRCI will be described as MRCI. These recently developed MCSCF and MRCI methods resulted in the basis of the modern Molpro. In the following years, a number of new programs were added. Analytic energy gradients can be evaluated with coupled-cluster calculations, density functional theory (DFT), as well as many other programs. These structural changes make the code more modular and easier to use and maintain, and also reduces the probability of input error.

<doc id="638974" wikidata="Q1351060" url="?curid=638974" title="Shaniwar Wada">
<text>Shaniada is a historical fortification in the city of Pune, India. Built in 1732, it was the seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Confederacy until 1818. The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site.

==History==

The Shaniwar Wada was normally 
the seven-story capital building of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. It was supposed to be made entirely of stone. However, after the completion of the base floor or the first story, the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Chhatrapati Shahu I (Emperor) saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the emperor himself and not the Peshwas. Following this, an official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made of brick and not stone.

By 1758, at least a thousand people lived in the fort. In 1773, Narayanrao, who was the fifth and ruling Peshwa then, was murdered by guards on orders of his uncle Raghunathrao and aunt Anandibai. A popular legend has it that Narayanrao&#x27;s ghost still calls for help on full moon nights. Various people, working around the area, have allegedly reported the cries of &quot;Kaka mala vachava&quot; (Uncle, save me) by Narayanrao Peshwa after his death. The book, Assassination of the Peshwa, written in English and Marathi, covers this incident in detail. 

In June 1818, the Peshwa, Bajirao II, abdicated his &quot;Gaadi&quot; (throne) to Sir John Malcolm of the British East India Company and went into political exile at Bithoor, near Kanpur in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India. On 27 February 1828, a great fire started inside the palace complex. The conflagration raged for seven days. Only the heavy granite ramparts, strong teak gateways and deep foundations and ruins of the buildings within the fort survived.

According to Haricharitramrutsagar, a biographical text of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, he had visited Shaniwarwada on the insistence of Bajirao II in 1799.

==Construction==

Peshwa Baji Rao I, prime minister to Chattrapati Shahu, laid the ceremonial foundation of his own residence on Saturday, 10 January 1730. It was named &quot;Shaniwar Wada&quot; from the Marathi words &quot;Shaniwar&quot; (Saturday) and &quot;Wada&quot; (a general term for any residence complex). Teak was imported from the jungles of Junnar, stone was brought from the nearby quarries of Chinchwad, and Lime (mineral) was brought from the lime-belts of Jejuri. Shaniwarwada was completed in 1732, at a total cost of Rs. 16,110, a very large sum at that time.

The opening ceremony was performed according to religious customs, on 22 January 1732, another Saturday chosen for being a particularly auspicious day.

Later the Peshwas made several additions, including the fortification walls, with bastions and gates; court halls and other buildings; fountains and reservoirs. Currently, the perimeter fortification wall has five gateways and nine bastion towers, enclosing a garden complex with the foundations of the original buildings.
It is situated near the Mula-Mutha River, in Kasba Peth.

==Fort complex==
===Gates===

Shaniwar Wada has five gates:
* &quot;Delhi Darwaza&quot;
:The &quot;Delhi Darwaza&quot; is the main gate of the complex, and faces north towards Delhi. In fact, Shaniwar Wada is the only fort structure in India to have its main gate facing Delhi, the medieval imperial capital of Mughal Empire. Even Chhatrapati Shahu is said to have considered the north-facing fort an indication of Baji Rao&#x27;s ambitions against the Mughal Empire, and suggested that the main gate should be made of &quot;chhaatiiche, maatiche naahi!&quot; (Marathi for &quot;of the chests of brave soldiers, not made of mud&quot;).

:The strongly built &quot;Delhi Darwaza&quot; gatehouse has massive doors, large enough to admit elephants outfitted with howdahs (seating canopies). To discourage elephants charging the gates, each pane of the gate has seventy-two sharp twelve-inch steel spikes arranged in a nine by eight grid, at approximately the height of the forehead of a battle-elephant. Each pane was also fortified with steel cross members, and borders were bolted with steel bolts having sharpened cone heads. The bastions flanking the gatehouse has arrow-loops and machicolation chutes through which boiling oil could be poured onto offending raiders. The right pane has a small man-sized door for usual entries and exits, too small to allow an army to enter rapidly. Shaniwar Wada was built by a contractor from Rajasthan known as &#x27;Kumawat&#x27; of the Rajput Sub-caste, after completing construction they were given the name &#x27;Naik&#x27; by the Peshwa.

:Even if the main gates were to be forced open, a charging army would need to turn sharply right, then sharply left, to pass through the gateway and into the central complex. This would provide a defending army with another chance to attack the incoming army, and to launch a counterattack to recapture the gateway.

:As the ceremonial gate of the fort, military campaigns would set out from and be received back here, with appropriate religious ceremonies.

* &quot;Mastani Darwaza&quot; (Mastani&#x27;s Gate) or &quot;Aliibahadur Darwaja&quot;, facing north
:This gate was the entrance leading to Bajirao I&#x27;s wife Mastani&#x27;s palace and was used by her while travelling out of the palace&#x27;s perimeter wall.

*&quot;Khidki Darwaza&quot; (Window Gate), facing east
:The &quot;Khidki Darwaja&quot; is named for an armoured window it contains.

*&quot;Ganesh Darwaza&quot; (Ganesh Gate), facing south-east
:Named for the Ganesh Rang Mahal, which used to stand near this door. It was used by ladies at the fort to visit the nearby Kasba Ganapati temple.

*&quot;Jambhul Darwaza&quot; or &quot;Narayan Darwaja&quot; (Narayan&#x27;s Gate), facing south
:This gate was used by concubines to enter and leave the fort. It obtained its second name after Narayanrao Peshwa&#x27;s corpse was removed from the fort for cremation through this gate. He is said to have been assassinated at this gate.

===Palaces===
The important buildings in the palace includes the &quot;Thorlya Rayancha Diwankhana&quot; (Marathi: the court reception hall of the eldest royal, meaning Baji Rao I), &quot;Naachacha Diwankhana&quot; (Dance Hall), and &quot;Juna Arsa Mahal&quot; (Old Mirror Hall).

Since the buildings were destroyed in the fire of 1828, only descriptions of the living areas of the fort are available. All the state halls in the buildings are said to have doorways with exquisitely carved teak arches, with ornamental teardrop teak pillars shaped like &quot;Suru&quot; (cypress tree) trunks supporting the ceilings, which were covered with beautiful teak tracery, carved creepers and flowers. Exquisite glass chandeliers hung from the ceilings. The floors were made of highly polished marble, arranged in a mosaic pattern and adorned with rich Persian rugs. The walls contained paintings with scenes from the Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.

The buildings are said to have been designed and constructed by well-known artisans, including Shivaram Krishna, Devaji Sutar, Kondaji Sutar, Morarji Patharwat Bhojraja (an inlay-work expert from Jaipur) and Ragho (a painter).

It is said that the Shaniwarwada complex was seven storeys high. On the top floor was the residence of the Peshwa which was called Meghadambari. It is said that the spire of Jñāneśvar temple at Alandi, 17 km away, could be seen from there.

===The Fountain===
The complex had an impressive lotus-shaped fountain: the &quot;Hazari Karanje&quot; (Fountain of a thousand jets). It was constructed for the pleasure of the infant Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao. It was designed as a sixteen petal lotus; each petal had sixteen jets with an eighty-foot arch. It was the most complicated and intricate fountain of its time.

Shrimant Anandrao Rudrajirao Dhulap-More (an admiral of Maratha navy in 18th century) who visited the Shaniwarwada in 1791 described it as &quot;very magnificent. A hundred dancers can dance here at a time. In one corner is a marble Ganapati statue and the palace is flanked by a fountain and a flower garden.&quot;.

==Popular culture==
*In 2008, Shaniwar Wada was featured on &quot;The Amazing Race Asia 3&quot;. In the game show, one participant from each team of two had to find the correct pheta (turban) from among those worn by 50 men within the Wada.

<doc id="638986" wikidata="Q936466" url="?curid=638986" title="Chad Pennington">
<text>James Chadwick Pennington (born June 26, 1976) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. He is currently the head football coach of the Sayre School in Lexington, Kentucky. He played college football for the Marshall Thundering Herd, winning the Sammy Baugh Trophy as a senior, and was selected by the New York Jets in the first round of the 2000 NFL draft. Pennington spent his first eight seasons with the Jets and was a member of the Miami Dolphins in his last three.

During his career, Pennington led the league twice in completion percentage and once in passer rating. He helped clinch a division title with the Jets in 2002 and the Dolphins in 2008, both of which are the most recent for either franchise. At the time of his retirement, he held the NFL record for completion percentage.
==Early life==
Pennington is a native of Tennessee. His father, Elwood, was a physical education teacher and football coach at Halls High School, and his mother, Denise, a teacher at the Webb School of Knoxville, both in Knoxville. Both of Pennington&#x27;s parents are of English descent. Pennington&#x27;s first sport was basketball, which he began playing in the third grade. He began playing football in his freshman year in high school. His parents decided to have him repeat the eighth grade when he was enrolled at the Webb School of Knoxville due to the school&#x27;s intense academic program. He played basketball and football at Webb, but knew he had a better chance at getting into college via football.

Pennington was recruited by only two colleges, Middle Tennessee State University and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. In 1995, he went to a training camp at Marshall University, his parents&#x27; alma mater, where he was noticed by head football coach Jim Donnan and offered a scholarship.

==College career==
Originally the Thundering Herd&#x27;s fourth-string quarterback in 1995 and slated to be redshirted, Pennington led Marshall to the 1995 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game, which Marshall lost to Montana, 22–20. The following year, Pennington was redshirted in favor of Eric Kresser, a transfer from the Florida Gators, who guided the Herd&#x27;s return to the I-AA Championship game (a victory) in 1996. Pennington returned to play in 1997 as Marshall moved from Division I-AA to Division I-A. He led Marshall to the school&#x27;s first bowl game victory in a 48–29 rout of Louisville in the 1998 Motor City Bowl. Pennington was named the game&#x27;s MVP. In his senior year (1999), Marshall went undefeated at 13–0 as Pennington led the team to its third consecutive Mid-American Conference championship. Pennington and Marshall returned to Pontiac, Michigan for the 1999 Motor City Bowl, where they won, 21–3, over BYU, capping Pennington&#x27;s undefeated senior season.

Pennington set school records in several passing categories. He finished fifth in 1999 Heisman Trophy voting. Randy Moss was Pennington&#x27;s top receiver at Marshall. Pennington finished his career at Marshall with 1,026 of 1,619 completions for 13,423 yards and 115 touchdowns with only 45 interceptions.

In addition to his success on the football field, Pennington excelled academically, graduating with a degree in journalism, a 3.83 grade point average and becoming a finalist for the Rhodes Scholarship. He wrote frequently for Marshall&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Parthenon&quot; and was a broadcaster for the school&#x27;s radio station WMUL, although he used a pseudonym on air so as not to be distracting.

===College statistics===

&quot;Includes statistics from 1995 when Marshall competed in Division I-AA. Includes 1997 Motor City Bowl, 1998 Motor City Bowl and 1999 Motor City Bowl stats.&quot;

==Professional career==
===New York Jets===

====2000–2003====
Pennington was selected by the New York Jets in the first round of the 2000 NFL draft, 18th overall and the first quarterback taken.

After making only three appearances during his first two seasons, Pennington emerged as the Jets&#x27; starting quarterback after filling in for Vinny Testaverde during the fifth game of the 2002 season. Pennington helped reverse the Jets&#x27; fortunes by leading the 1–4 team to an eventual 9–7 record and an AFC East division championship. Despite starting less than a full season, Pennington threw for 3,120 yards with 22 touchdowns and six interceptions. His 104.2 quarterback rating set a team record. In the Wild Card game, Pennington threw for a 142 QB rating, leading the Jets over Peyton Manning and the number four passing offense of the Indianapolis Colts.

After their 2002 performance, Pennington and the Jets were given lofty expectations entering the 2003 pre-season; however, in the fourth pre-season game against the New York Giants, Pennington endured a fracture-dislocation on his left (non-throwing) hand after suffering a hit from linebacker Brandon Short. The injury forced him to miss the first six games of the season. Due to the severity of the injury, and a rushed rehab process, Pennington&#x27;s wrist would never be the same, and his once outstanding play-fake became thoroughly ordinary. Without their starting quarterback, the Jets began the season 1–4. Despite his return, the Jets only won five more games to finish 6–10.

====2004 season====
Into the 2004 season, the Jets signed Pennington to a team-record contract for seven years and $64.2 million and Pennington led the Jets to a 5–0 record. However, during a Week 9 game against the Buffalo Bills, Pennington injured his rotator cuff and subsequently missed three games. Second string quarterback Quincy Carter was 2–1 in Pennington&#x27;s absence. After returning to action with a rout of the Houston Texans. Despite a scuffle with the New York media and losses to the New England Patriots and the St. Louis Rams, the Jets earned a wild card berth with a 10–6 record. Pennington then led the Jets to a first-round, 20–17 overtime win against the AFC West Champion San Diego Chargers, as he went 23–33, for 279 yards and two touchdowns. Pennington and the Jets then faced the 15–1 Steelers at Pittsburgh. Despite the Jets&#x27; offensive struggles and facing a 10–0 deficit, the Jets defense and special teams rallied to score 17 unanswered points. However, Pennington and the Jets would see their season end with kicker Doug Brien missing two potential game-winning field goals. The Steelers went on to win in overtime.

Pennington feuded with the local New York media throughout the season. During a news conference on December 20, 2004, Pennington scolded the assembled media, telling them it was &#x27;not (their) right&#x27; but a &#x27;privilege&#x27; of theirs to cover the Jets, &#x27;to be around a bunch of professional athletes every day and do your job&#x27;.

====2005 season====
Pennington underwent surgery on his right shoulder in Birmingham, Alabama on February 4, 2005. It was later revealed that he had suffered a substantial tear in the right rotator cuff, as well as a large bone spur on that shoulder. A dismal performance against the Kansas City Chiefs in September and a lackluster one against the Miami Dolphins the following week led to speculation that the shoulder had yet to fully heal, but both Pennington and Jets coach Herman Edwards denied this, citing a lack of pre-season practice and Pennington&#x27;s less-than-full grasp of new offensive coordinator Mike Heimerdinger&#x27;s plays. On September 25, 2005, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Pennington once again suffered an injury, although he re-entered the game later and almost led the Jets to victory despite not throwing well. However, tests later showed another tear in his rotator cuff.

On October 6, 2005, Pennington once again underwent surgery to repair his right shoulder. Pennington and the Jets expected that with more rehabilitation time than his first surgery, he would have better strength and control with his throws entering the 2006 season. In the midst of the eventually-resolved labor talks of February–March 2006, Pennington restructured his contract with the New York Jets to ensure he remained with the team for at least the 2006 season. Pennington was reported to have taken a significant cut in pay, with the amounts lost recoverable by way of achievable incentives; however, the Jets organization did not comment on contractual issues.
====2006 season====
Entering the 2006 season, Pennington trained with new throwing coaches, and worked significantly on the strength of his torso and throwing mechanics. During training camp, new head coach Eric Mangini told players and the press that the quarterback position was still uncertain, and that all four Jets quarterbacks (Chad Pennington, Patrick Ramsey, Brooks Bollinger, and Kellen Clemens) had a chance to be the starter. The Jets medical staff limited Pennington&#x27;s throws to ensure the safety of his shoulder.

Pennington won the Jets pre-season quarterback competition, and started the 2006 season in pre-injury form. In the first two weeks of the season, and for the first time in his career, Pennington posted back-to-back 300-yard passing games. Pennington&#x27;s Week One performance against the Tennessee Titans earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. In Week 15 in Minnesota, Pennington passed for a career-high 339 yards.

Pennington reached career highs for completions, passing attempts, and passing yardage with 3,352 yards, starting all sixteen games.

Although his lack of arm strength was often criticized, Pennington&#x27;s abilities fit well with the new offense instituted by offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer. Using a short passing game and taking advantage of the &quot;yards after catch&quot; ability of wide receivers Laveranues Coles, Jerricho Cotchery, and running back Leon Washington, Pennington led the Jets to a 10–6 record and a playoff berth as a wild card team, a significant improvement over their 4–12 mark in 2005.

The Jets took on the New England Patriots in their lone playoff game. The Jets lost 37–16, with Pennington passing for 300 yards and a touchdown. With the start, Pennington also became the Jets&#x27; all-time leader in postseason starts by a quarterback with five.

For his stellar season, Pennington was awarded the Comeback Player of the Year Award, just one year after tearing his rotator cuff. He received 27 of the 50 votes cast, finishing far ahead of the 8.5 votes received by second-place finisher Drew Brees.

====2007 season====
The 2007 season was a tumultuous one for Pennington. In the first game of the season, against the Patriots, Pennington suffered a high ankle sprain that kept him out of game two. In the third game, against the Miami Dolphins, he led the Jets to a 31–28 victory, throwing two touchdowns and running for a third. After a 17–14 loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 4, he threw three interceptions against the New York Giants in Week 5, giving him five interceptions in two games. Two weeks later, he threw a costly interception late in the fourth quarter against the Cincinnati Bengals. After leading the Jets to a dismal 1–7 start, coach Eric Mangini decided to bench Pennington for second-year quarterback Kellen Clemens. Clemens suffered a rib injury during a Week 15 matchup against the Patriots, resulting in Pennington&#x27;s return to game action. Pennington finished the game completing 25 of 38 pass attempts for 184 yards. He also threw for more yards and fewer interceptions than opposing quarterback Tom Brady, who was on his way to an MVP season, but that day was 14–27 for 140 yards with one interception. Pennington started the next week at Tennessee, where the Jets lost 6–10. Clemens replaced Pennington for the final game of the season against the Kansas City Chiefs. Pennington finished the 2007 season with 1,765 yards, 10 touchdowns, 9 interceptions and a passer rating of 86.1.

In 2008, upon entering training camp, Eric Mangini announced a competition for the starting quarterback position between Pennington and Clemens. However, on August 7, 2008, the Jets acquired veteran and former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre, leading to Pennington&#x27;s release later that day.

===Miami Dolphins===

====2008 season====

Upon his release from the Jets, it was reported that at least six teams were interested in Pennington. However, only the Minnesota Vikings and the Miami Dolphins were considered as serious contenders. On August 8, Pennington signed a two-year, $11.5 million deal with the Dolphins. Dolphins head coach Tony Sparano said that Pennington would have to compete for the starting job. He was later announced as the starting quarterback as the Dolphins moved into the regular season. His 67.4 completion percentage led the NFL and broke Miami&#x27;s single-season record of 64.2 set by Dan Marino in 1984. He finished the season with a passer rating of 97.4, started all sixteen games for the Dolphins, and led them to an 11–5 record (including winning 9 of their last 10 games) and the third seed in the playoffs with an AFC East Championship. The Dolphins went on to lose to the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the playoffs, 27–9. He was the first Dolphins quarterback since Hall of Famer Dan Marino to throw for 3,500 yards. For his role in the Dolphins&#x27; ten-win turnaround, Pennington received notable MVP consideration from several major media outlets. He received four votes, and finished tied for second with running back Michael Turner for the 2008 AP NFL MVP. The winner of the award, Peyton Manning, received 32 votes.

At the completion of the regular season, Pennington was awarded his second Comeback Player of the Year Award.

====2009 season====
Pennington was the starter for the Miami Dolphins 2009 season, with Pat White as the second string, and Chad Henne as the third string. On September 27, 2009, against the San Diego Chargers, during the third quarter Pennington injured the same shoulder on which he had two previous surgeries. Chad Henne served as his replacement in the 23–13 loss.

On September 28, Pennington went in for an MRI amidst speculation of a season-ending injury. On September 29, 2009, it was announced that initial results show a torn capsule in his throwing shoulder. After seeking a second opinion, Pennington decided to go with a third surgery on the shoulder. Pennington later said that although he was not sure if he would play again, he would try and rehabilitate the shoulder and work on getting back to the NFL. He was officially placed on injured reserve and the Dolphins acquired Tyler Thigpen from the Chiefs for an undisclosed 2010 draft pick.

====2010 season====
On March 5, 2010, Pennington was re-signed by the Dolphins to a one-year deal. The deal would pay him $5.75 million if he had started, $4.2 million if he had been traded by the team, or $2.5 million as a back-up to Chad Henne.

On November 10, 2010, Pennington was named the starting quarterback for the November 14 game against the Titans. On his first play, Pennington suffered a severe shoulder injury. The injury was considered potentially career-ending.

====2011 season====
Pennington attempted another comeback to the NFL in 2011. However, on March 31, 2011, he tore his ACL while playing a game of pick-up basketball. Pennington announced that he would work for Fox Sports as an analyst during the 2011 NFL season. On February 9, 2012, he announced he would retire rather than attempt a comeback following his fourth shoulder surgery.

<doc id="638996" wikidata="Q3740854" url="?curid=638996" title="Everton, Liverpool">
<text>Everton is a suburb of north Liverpool, in Merseyside, England, and part of the Liverpool Walton constituency. It is bordered by Vauxhall to the west, Kirkdale to the north, and Anfield to the north-east. Historically in Lancashire, at the 2011 Census the population was 14,782.

==Toponymy==
The name Everton is derived from the Saxon word &quot;eofor&quot;, meaning &quot;wild boar that lives in forests&quot;. In 1830, local historian Robert Syers proposed an alternative origin for Everton&#x27;s name. He noted that earlier residents called it &#x27;Yerton&#x27;, a claim supported by James Stonehouse, his near contemporary, some thirty years later. Syers contended that in the Domesday Book of 1086, Everton was labelled Hiretun, meaning higher-town, signifying its elevated position. He suggested &#x27;Yerton&#x27; could be a corruption of Hiretun or &quot;Oure&quot;ton (higher-town or over-town respectively).

==History==
Everton is an ancient settlement and, like Liverpool, was one of the six unnamed s of West Derby. For many centuries, Everton was a small township. An early type of census conducted in 1327 recorded nineteen heads of household, suggesting a population of approximately ninety-five individuals. By 1692, only 135 people lived in Everton, and by 1714, the population had not exceeded 140 inhabitants. Before the middle of the eighteenth century, the residents were primarily individuals of modest means, engaged in agricultural activities as landowners and cultivators. Occasionally wealthier settlers, along with their families, who had withdrawn from commercial pursuits, chose to reside in Everton. During this time, the distinction between the upper classes and the middle or lower classes was minimal, in terms of both demeanour and lifestyle. 

Until the late 18th century Everton was a small rural parish of Walton-on-the-Hill, but the rise in prosperity of nearby Liverpool pushed its wealthier merchants towards Everton and further afield. The population of the township experienced significant growth during this period. By 1769, the population had risen to 253 individuals, reaching 370 by 1790, 499 by 1801, and 913 by 1811. A record of citizens from 1815 reveals a substantial change in the character of the township, with a disproportionately large number of its population listed as merchants or gentlemen not engaged in trade. Writing of this period in 1869, James Stonehouse recalled that &#x27;Fifty years ago Everton was a courtly place, wherein resided the richest merchants, the most distinguished citizens, and the most fashionable and leading families. Indeed, so high did the inhabitants hold their heads, in consequence of their wealth, stability, and position, that they were termed “Everton nobles.”’

In his &quot;History of Everton&quot;, published in 1830, Robert Syers wrote of the merchants, &#x27;It is this class of persons, principally, that has made Everton what it is; their wealth and attention have transformed a spot which, not long ago, was little better than an unsightly common – a neglected waste – into a modern arcadia…’ Prominent in this context was James Atherton, a Liverpool merchant and real estate developer. Having acquired a substantial amount of land on Everton Hill and its surroundings, he embarked on the transformation of the north-west district of the township. Atherton laid-out several well-known streets, including Albion Crescent (now Albion Street), Northumberland Terrace, York Terrace, and Grecian Terrace, embellishing them with &#x27;handsome mansions and delightful villas.&#x27; Additionally, he donated the land for the construction of St. George’s Church. Notably, James Atherton&#x27;s impact extended beyond Everton, founding the seaside resort of New Brighton in 1830. He was laid to rest at St George&#x27;s Church.

Before 1803, the site of St George&#x27;s Church was occupied by the Everton beacon, one of the area&#x27;s most famous landmarks. It was a modest square tower built from local red sandstone. Standing at approximately 25 feet, the two-storied tower featured a ground floor serving as a kitchen, an apartment above for the guard, and a flat roof or terrace for the beacon fire. A turret at the northwest corner provided shelter for the watchman. The interior had a stone staircase leading to the upper room, and a similar flight to the roof, which offered views of up to thirty miles, or fifty miles if conditions were optimal. Over time, the tower&#x27;s square-headed windows became frameless and exposed to the elements and its only inhabitants were the cattle grazing in beacon-field. By December 1802, the beacon was in a dilapidated state with an earth and clay floor, a deteriorated fireplace, and its upper apartment described as &#x27;bare, cheerless, and dungeon-like&#x27;. Debate surrounds the beacon&#x27;s construction date, with suggestions generally ranging from pre-Armada to post-1327. Its fate was sealed in 1803 when, during a stormy night, the structure collapsed. Speculation persists that it might have been deliberately undermined by someone viewing it and its visitors as a nuisance. Notably, during the English Civil War, the beacon served as a venue for marriages following the expulsion of loyal clergy from Liverpool, foreshadowing the future use of the site for a church.

By the early 19th century Liverpool&#x27;s demand for housing saw Everton begin to be built up. In 1821 the population was 2109 and by 1829 it had risen to an estimated 3763 (calculated from 579 inhabited houses). Everton became part of Liverpool in 1835. Commenting on the transformation of Everton in 1869, Stonehouse noted that &#x27;Within the last fifteen years…the process of metamorphosis has gone on until one of the pleasantest suburbs of Liverpool has become as life-teeming, cottage-bearing, and street-streaming as the densest part of Liverpool itself. Hosts of cottages now swarm up the hill sides, scramble over the top, and flood the plain on its summit. 

Along with neighbouring Vauxhall, Everton housed a very large Irish population. Sectarianism was one negative consequence of religious differences with tensions between Catholics and Protestants existing well into the 20th century. St Domingo Road in Everton was the intended site for the building of the Metropolitan Cathedral, but this was abandoned owing to financial constraints. The cathedral was eventually located in the city centre near to the southern edge of Everton.

Everton was formerly a township in the parish of Walton-on-the-Hill, in 1866 Everton became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1922 the parish was abolished and merged with Liverpool. In 1921 the parish had a population of 124,414.

Urban clearance during the 1960s and 1970s, followed by the creation of Everton Park, changed the face of the area and some parts have never recovered. The population has plummeted by over 100,000 since the 1960s; Everton Park has replaced the densely packed streets with fields and trees. The landscape of Everton is now mainly non-urban with the loss of so many people and many hundreds of buildings.


A new district centre on Great Homer Street was opened in 2017, code named &#x27;Project Jennifer&#x27; it was advertised as a scheme to breathe new life into the rundown parts of Everton centred on Great Homer Street including a revamped &#x27;Greaty&#x27; (branded &quot;Greatie&quot;) market. The project suffered numerous delays and setbacks through the proposal and construction stages, but was ultimately opened in June 2017, with the opening of a Sainbury&#x27;s supermarket. The NSPCC Hargreaves Centre (named after locally born benefactor John Hargreaves) was opened in May 2007 on the site of the former indoor market.

==Sport==
The football club Everton F.C. (originally called St. Domingo F.C.) is named after the area (St. Domingo Methodist Chapel was in Everton). The district is also the location of a building on the club&#x27;s crest, Everton Lock-Up, known locally as Prince Rupert&#x27;s Tower. Barker and Dobson, a local sweet manufacturer, introduced &#x27;Everton Mints&#x27; to honour Everton Football Club.

Ironically, Everton F.C. has never actually played in the area. Its first three homes were located in Anfield, including Stanley Park; the club has played at Goodison Park in the area of Walton since 1892. In addition, Everton Cemetery is also not located in Everton, it lies further north-east in the district of Fazakerley.

The football club Liverpool F.C. was originally founded as &#x27;Everton Football Club and Athletic Ground Company, Ltd&#x27;, or &#x27;Everton Athletic&#x27;, on 26 January 1892, as a consequence of the Everton F.C. split that resulted in Everton F.C.&#x27;s move to Goodison Park in 1892. The former Evertonians who founded &#x27;Everton Athletic&#x27; to play at Anfield renamed the club &#x27;Liverpool F.C.&#x27; on 3 June 1892.

<text>Congaree National Park is a national park of the United States in central South Carolina, 18 miles southeast of the state capital, Columbia. The park preserves the largest tract of old growth bottomland hardwood forest left in the United States. The lush trees growing in its floodplain forest are some of the tallest in the eastern United States, forming one of the highest temperate deciduous forest canopies remaining in the world. The Congaree River flows through the park. About are designated as a wilderness area.

The park received its official designation in 2003 as the culmination of a grassroots campaign that began in 1969. With 145,929 visitors in 2018, it ranks as the United States&#x27; 10th-least visited national park, just behind Nevada&#x27;s Great Basin National Park.

==Park history==

===Pre-park===
Resource extraction on the Congaree River centered on cypress logging from 1898 when the &quot;Santee River Cypress Logging Company&quot; began to operate in the area of what is now the park. Owned by Francis Beidler and Benjamin F. Ferguson of Chicago, the company operated until 1914; subsequently, Beidler and his heirs retained ownership of the area. In the 1950s Harry R. E. Hampton was a member of the Cedar Creek Hunt Club and co-editor of &quot;The State&quot;. Hampton joined with Peter Manigault at the Charleston &quot;The Post and Courier&quot; to advocate preservation of the Congaree floodplain. Hampton formed the Beidler Forest Preservation Association in 1961. As a result of this advocacy a 1963 study by the National Park Service reported favorably on the establishment of a national monument.

===Monument establishment===
No progress was made in the 1960s. Renewed logging by the Beidlers in 1969 prompted the 1972 formation of the Congaree Swamp National Preserve Association (CSNPA). The CSNPA joined forces with the Sierra Club and other conservation organizations to promote federal legislation to preserve the tract. South Carolina Senators Strom Thurmond and Ernest F. Hollings introduced legislation in 1975 for the establishment of a national preserve. On October 18, 1976, legislation was passed to create Congaree Swamp National Monument. An expansion plan was introduced by Hollings and Thurmond in 1988, expanding the monument to .

===Conversion to a national park===
Over two-thirds of the national monument was designated a wilderness area on October 24, 1988, and it became an Important Bird Area on July 26, 2001. Congress redesignated the monument Congaree National Park on November 10, 2003, dropping the misleading &quot;swamp&quot; from the name, and simultaneously expanded its authorized boundary by approximately . As of December 31, 2011, approximately of the park are in federal ownership.

==Environment==

The park preserves a significant part of the Middle Atlantic coastal forests ecoregion. Although it is frequently referred to as a swamp, it is largely bottomland subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters.

It has been designated an old growth forest and part of the Old Growth Forest Network. The park also has one of the largest concentrations of champion trees in the world, with the tallest known examples of 15 species. Champion trees include a 361-point loblolly pine, a 384-point sweetgum, a 465-point cherrybark oak, a 354-point American elm, a 356-point swamp chestnut oak, a 371-point overcup oak, and a 219-point common persimmon.

Large animals possibly seen in the park include bobcats, deer, feral pigs, feral dogs, coyotes, armadillos, turkeys, and otters. Its waters contain interesting creatures like amphibians, turtles, snakes, and many types of fish, including bowfin, alligator gar, and catfish.

==Amenities and attractions==

In addition to being a designated wilderness area, a UNESCO biosphere reserve, an important bird area and a national natural landmark, Congaree National Park features primitive campsites and offers hiking, canoeing, kayaking, and bird watching. The park is also a popular spot for watching firefly displays on summer evenings. Primitive and backcountry camping are available. Some of the hiking trails include the Bluff Trail (0.7 mi), Weston Lake Loop Trail (4.6 mi), Oakridge Trail (7.5 mi), and King Snake Trail (11.1 mi) where hikers may spot deer, raccoon, opossum, and even bobcat tracks. The National Park Service rangers have current trail conditions which can be found in the Harry Hampton Visitor Center. Along with hiking trails, the park also has a marked canoe trail on Cedar Creek.

Most visitors to the park walk along the Boardwalk Loop, an elevated walkway through the swampy environment that protects delicate fungi and plant life at ground level. Congaree boasts both the tallest () and largest (42 cubic meters) loblolly pines (&quot;Pinus taeda&quot;) alive today as well as several cypress trees well over 500 years old.
The Harry Hampton Visitor Center features exhibits about the natural history of the park, and the efforts to protect the swamp.

Monthly volunteer-led hikes are offered on some of the longer trails to give visitors an opportunity to get off the boardwalk and up close to nature.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Congaree National Park has a Humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

==Geology==

The park resides entirely within the Congaree River Floodplain Complex with flood deposits of sand, silt, and clay. Muck and peat are the products of vegetation decay. The meander of the river has produced distinctive oxbow lakes. North of the park is the NE-SW regional trending Augusta Fault and the Terrace Complex consisting of Pliocene fluvial terraces. South of the park is the Southern Bluffs, which have been eroding since the Late Pleistocene. West of the park is the Fall Line and Piedmont.

== Documentary ==
In 2008, South Carolina Educational Television (SCETV) produced a documentary on the history of the Congaree National Park titled &quot;Roots in the River: The Story of Congaree National Park&quot;. The documentary featured interviews with people involved in the movement that eventually led to the area&#x27;s U.S. National Monument status, and observed the role the park plays in the surrounding community of the Lower Richland County area of South Carolina. The program first aired on the SCETV network in September 2009.

<doc id="639004" wikidata="Q847506" url="?curid=639004" title="Feud (professional wrestling)">
<text>In professional wrestling, a feud is a staged rivalry between multiple wrestlers or groups of wrestlers. They are integrated into ongoing storylines, particularly in events which are televised. Feuds may last for months or even years; conversely, they may be resolved with implausible speed, perhaps during a single match. 

==Definition==
Feuds are often the result of the friction that is created between faces (the heroic figures) and heels (the malevolent, &quot;evil&quot; participants). Common causes of feuds are a purported slight or insult, although they can be based on many other things, including conflicting moral codes or simple professional one-upmanship such as the pursuit of a championship. Some of the more popular feuds with audiences involve pitting former allies, particularly tag team partners, against each other. Depending on how popular and entertaining the feud may be, it is usually common practice for a feud to continue on for weeks, usually building toward a match in a supercard.

Due to the complexity of modern wrestling storylines, some feuds lack the traditional ‘face vs. heel’ narrative. Many feuds take place between two faces, while some involve characters that don’t fit either traditional role, often called tweeners. Feuds between two heels are rare, but may take place, especially if one or more of the wrestlers in the feud are particularly popular with fans.

One of the longest feuds of all time was the feud between Ric Flair and Ricky Steamboat, estimated by Flair to comprise more than 2,000 matches, though he admits that most of those matches were &quot;confined to those in the arena&quot;.

Traditionally, most promoters wanted to &quot;protect the business&quot; by having wrestlers act in character in public, and thus further convince the live audience that the feuding wrestlers &quot;really did&quot; hate each other and were looking to outdo each other. During the days when wrestling territories were more regionally based, some feuds lasted for years, and if the feuding wrestlers were shown to really be friends, or were associating as friends in public, it would break the illusion of their feud, and undo all the work to promote it up to that point.

<text>Agile software development is an umbrella term for approaches to developing software that reflect the values and principles agreed upon by &quot;The Agile Alliance&quot;, a group of 17 software practitioners, in 2001. As documented in their &quot;Manifesto for Agile Software Development&quot; the practitioners value: 

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

The practitioners cite inspiration from new practices at the time including extreme programming, scrum, dynamic systems development method, adaptive software development and being sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes.

Many software development practices emerged from the agile mindset. These agile-based practices, sometimes called &quot;Agile&quot; (with a capital A) include requirements, discovery and solutions improvement through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams with their customer(s)/end user(s).

While there is much anecdotal evidence that the agile mindset and agile-based practices improve the software development process, the empirical evidence is limited and less than conclusive.

==History==
Iterative and incremental software development methods can be traced back as early as 1957, with evolutionary project management and adaptive software development emerging in the early 1970s.

During the 1990s, a number of &quot;lightweight&quot; software development methods evolved in reaction to the prevailing &quot;heavyweight&quot; methods (often referred to collectively as &quot;waterfall&quot;) that critics described as overly regulated, planned, and micromanaged. These lightweight methods included: rapid application development (RAD), from 1991; the unified process (UP) and dynamic systems development method (DSDM), both from 1994; Scrum, from 1995; Crystal Clear and extreme programming (XP), both from 1996; and feature-driven development (FDD), from 1997. Although these all originated before the publication of the &quot;Agile Manifesto&quot;, they are now collectively referred to as agile software development methods.

Already since 1991 similar changes had been underway in manufacturing and management thinking derived from Lean management.

In 2001, seventeen software developers met at a resort in Snowbird, Utah to discuss lightweight development methods. They were: Kent Beck (Extreme Programming), Ward Cunningham (Extreme Programming), Dave Thomas (Pragmatic Programming, Ruby), Jeff Sutherland (Scrum), Ken Schwaber (Scrum), Jim Highsmith (Adaptive Software Development), Alistair Cockburn (Crystal), Robert C. Martin (SOLID), Mike Beedle (Scrum), Arie van Bennekum, Martin Fowler (OOAD and UML), James Grenning, Andrew Hunt (Pragmatic Programming, Ruby), Ron Jeffries (Extreme Programming), Jon Kern, Brian Marick (Ruby, Test-driven development), and Steve Mellor (OOA). The group, The Agile Alliance, published the &quot;Manifesto for Agile Software Development&quot;.

In 2005, a group headed by Cockburn and Highsmith wrote an addendum of project management principles, the PM Declaration of Interdependence, to guide software project management according to agile software development methods.

In 2009, a group working with Martin wrote an extension of software development principles, the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto, to guide agile software development according to professional conduct and mastery.

In 2011, the Agile Alliance created the &quot;Guide to Agile Practices&quot; (renamed the &quot;Agile Glossary&quot; in 2016), an evolving open-source compendium of the working definitions of agile practices, terms, and elements, along with interpretations and experience guidelines from the worldwide community of agile practitioners.

== Values and principles ==

=== Values ===
The agile manifesto reads:

&quot;We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:&quot;
* 
* 

&quot;That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.&quot;

Scott Ambler explained:
* Tools and processes are important, but it is more important to have competent people working together effectively.
*Good documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it, but the main point of development is to create software, not documentation.
*A contract is important but is not a substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need.
*A project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholders&#x27; priorities, and people&#x27;s understanding of the problem and its solution.

Introducing the manifesto on behalf of the Agile Alliance, Jim Highsmith said,
=== Principles ===

The values are based on these principles:
# Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
# Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
# Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).
# Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
# Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.
# Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).
# Working software is the primary measure of progress.
# Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.
# Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
# Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work done—is essential.
# Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
# Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.

==Overview==
===Iterative, incremental, and evolutionary===
Most agile development methods break product development work into small increments that minimize the amount of up-front planning and design. Iterations, or sprints, are short time frames (timeboxes) that typically last from one to four weeks. Each iteration involves a cross-functional team working in all functions: planning, analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing. At the end of the iteration a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders. This minimizes overall risk and allows the product to adapt to changes quickly. An iteration might not add enough functionality to warrant a market release, but the goal is to have an available release (with minimal bugs) at the end of each iteration. Through incremental development, products have room to &quot;fail often and early&quot; throughout each iterative phase instead of drastically on a final release date. Multiple iterations might be required to release a product or new features. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

A key advantage of agile approaches is speed to market and risk mitigation. Smaller increments are typically released to market, reducing the time and cost risks of engineering a product that doesn&#x27;t meet user requirements.

===Efficient and face-to-face communication===
The 6th principle of the agile manifesto for software development states &quot;The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation&quot;. The manifesto, written in 2001 when video conferencing was not widely used, states this in relation to the communication of information, not necessarily that a team should be co-located.

The principle of co-location is that co-workers on the same team should be situated together to better establish the identity as a team and to improve communication. This enables face-to-face interaction, ideally in front of a whiteboard, that reduces the cycle time typically taken when questions and answers are mediated through phone, persistent chat, wiki, or email. With the widespread adoption of remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic and changes to tooling, more studies have been conducted around co-location and distributed working which show that co-location is increasingly less relevant.

No matter which development method is followed, every team should include a customer representative (known as &quot;product owner&quot; in Scrum). This representative is agreed by stakeholders to act on their behalf and makes a personal commitment to being available for developers to answer questions throughout the iteration. At the end of each iteration, the project stakeholders together with the customer representative review progress and re-evaluate priorities with a view to optimizing the return on investment (ROI) and ensuring alignment with customer needs and company goals. The importance of stakeholder satisfaction, detailed by frequent interaction and review at the end of each phase, is why the approach is often denoted as a customer-centered methodology.

==== Information radiator ====
In agile software development, an information radiator is a (normally large) physical display, board with sticky notes or similar, located prominently near the development team, where passers-by can see it. It presents an up-to-date summary of the product development status. A build light indicator may also be used to inform a team about the current status of their product development.

===Very short feedback loop and adaptation cycle===
A common characteristic in agile software development is the daily stand-up (known as &quot;daily scrum&quot; in the Scrum framework). In a brief session (e.g., 15 minutes), team members review collectively how they are progressing toward their goal and agree whether they need to adapt their approach. To keep to the agreed time limit, teams often use simple coded questions (such as what they completed the previous day, what they aim to complete that day, and whether there are any impediments or risks to progress), and delay detailed discussions and problem resolution until after the stand-up.

===Quality focus===

Specific tools and techniques, such as continuous integration, automated unit testing, pair programming, test-driven development, design patterns, behavior-driven development, domain-driven design, code refactoring and other techniques are often used to improve quality and enhance product development agility. This is predicated on designing and building quality in from the beginning and being able to demonstrate software for customers at any point, or at least at the end of every iteration.

==Philosophy==
Compared to traditional software engineering, agile software development mainly targets complex systems and product development with dynamic, indeterministic and non-linear properties. Accurate estimates, stable plans, and predictions are often hard to get in early stages, and confidence in them is likely to be low. Agile practitioners use their free will to reduce the &quot;leap of faith&quot; that is needed before any evidence of value can be obtained. Requirements and design are held to be emergent. Big up-front specifications would probably cause a lot of waste in such cases, i.e., are not economically sound. These basic arguments and previous industry experiences, learned from years of successes and failures, have helped shape agile development&#x27;s favor of adaptive, iterative and evolutionary development.

=== Adaptive vs. predictive ===
Development methods exist on a continuum from &quot;adaptive&quot; to &quot;predictive&quot;. Agile software development methods lie on the &quot;adaptive&quot; side of this continuum. One key of adaptive development methods is a &quot;rolling wave&quot; approach to schedule planning, which identifies milestones but leaves flexibility in the path to reach them, and also allows for the milestones themselves to change.

&quot;Adaptive&quot; methods focus on adapting quickly to changing realities. When the needs of a project change, an adaptive team changes as well. An adaptive team has difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future. The further away a date is, the more vague an adaptive method is about what will happen on that date. An adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks they will do next week, but only which features they plan for next month. When asked about a release six months from now, an adaptive team might be able to report only the mission statement for the release, or a statement of expected value vs. cost.

&quot;Predictive&quot; methods, in contrast, focus on analyzing and planning the future in detail and cater for known risks. In the extremes, a predictive team can report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the development process. Predictive methods rely on effective early phase analysis, and if this goes very wrong, the project may have difficulty changing direction. Predictive teams often institute a change control board to ensure they consider only the most valuable changes.

Risk analysis can be used to choose between adaptive (&quot;agile&quot; or &quot;value-driven&quot;) and predictive (&quot;plan-driven&quot;) methods. Barry Boehm and Richard Turner suggest that each side of the continuum has its own &quot;home ground&quot;, as follows:

=== Agile vs. waterfall ===
One of the differences between agile software development methods and waterfall is the approach to quality and testing. In the waterfall model, work moves through software development life cycle (SDLC) phases—with one phase being completed before another can start—hence the testing phase is separate and follows a build phase. In agile software development, however, testing is completed in the same iteration as programming.

Because testing is done in every iteration—which develops a small piece of the software—users can frequently use those new pieces of software and validate the value. After the users know the real value of the updated piece of software, they can make better decisions about the software&#x27;s future. Having a value retrospective and software re-planning session in each iteration—Scrum typically has iterations of just two weeks—helps the team continuously adapt its plans so as to maximize the value it delivers. This follows a pattern similar to the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle, as the work is &quot;planned&quot;, &quot;done&quot;, &quot;checked&quot; (in the review and retrospective), and any changes agreed are &quot;acted&quot; upon.

This iterative approach supports a &quot;product&quot; rather than a &quot;project&quot; mindset. This provides greater flexibility throughout the development process; whereas on projects the requirements are defined and locked down from the very beginning, making it difficult to change them later. Iterative product development allows the software to evolve in response to changes in business environment or market requirements.

=== Code vs. documentation ===
In a letter to &quot;IEEE Computer&quot;, Steven Rakitin expressed cynicism about agile software development, calling it &quot;&quot;yet another attempt to undermine the discipline of software engineering&quot; and translating &quot;working software over comprehensive documentation&quot; as &quot;we want to spend all our time coding. Remember, real programmers don&#x27;t write documentation&quot;.&quot;

This is disputed by proponents of agile software development, who state that developers should write documentation if that is the best way to achieve the relevant goals, but that there are often better ways to achieve those goals than writing static documentation.
Scott Ambler states that documentation should be &quot;just barely good enough&quot; (JBGE), that too much or comprehensive documentation would usually cause waste, and developers rarely trust detailed documentation because it&#x27;s usually out of sync with code, while too little documentation may also cause problems for maintenance, communication, learning and knowledge sharing. Alistair Cockburn wrote of the &quot;Crystal Clear&quot; method: 
==Methods==
Agile software development methods support a broad range of the software development life cycle. Some methods focus on the practices (e.g., XP, pragmatic programming, agile modeling), while some focus on managing the flow of work (e.g., Scrum, Kanban). Some support activities for requirements specification and development (e.g., FDD), while some seek to cover the full development life cycle (e.g., DSDM, RUP).

Notable agile software development frameworks include:
=== Agile software development practices ===
Agile software development is supported by a number of concrete practices, covering areas like requirements, design, modeling, coding, testing, planning, risk management, process, quality, etc. Some notable agile software development practices include:
====Acceptance test-driven development====
====Agile modeling====
====Agile testing====
====Backlogs====
====Behavior-driven development====
====Continuous integration====
====Cross-functional team====
====Daily stand-up====
===Method tailoring===
In the literature, different terms refer to the notion of method adaptation, including &#x27;method tailoring&#x27;, &#x27;method fragment adaptation&#x27; and &#x27;situational method engineering&#x27;. Method tailoring is defined as:

Situation-appropriateness should be considered as a distinguishing characteristic between agile methods and more plan-driven software development methods, with agile methods allowing product development teams to adapt working practices according to the needs of individual products. Potentially, most agile methods could be suitable for method tailoring, such as DSDM tailored in a CMM context. and XP tailored with the &quot;Rule Description Practices&quot; (RDP) technique. Not all agile proponents agree, however, with Schwaber noting &quot;that is how we got into trouble in the first place, thinking that the problem was not having a perfect methodology. Efforts [should] center on the changes [needed] in the enterprise&quot;. Bas Vodde reinforced this viewpoint, suggesting that unlike traditional, large methodologies that require you to pick and choose elements, Scrum provides the basics on top of which you add additional elements to localize and contextualize its use. Practitioners seldom use system development methods, or agile methods specifically, by the book, often choosing to omit or tailor some of the practices of a method in order to create an in-house method.

In practice, methods can be tailored using various tools. Generic process modeling languages such as Unified Modeling Language can be used to tailor software development methods. However, dedicated tools for method engineering such as the Essence Theory of Software Engineering of SEMAT also exist.

=== Large-scale, offshore and distributed ===
Agile software development has been widely seen as highly suited to certain types of environments, including small teams of experts working on greenfield projects, and the challenges and limitations encountered in the adoption of agile software development methods in a large organization with legacy infrastructure are well-documented and understood.

In response, a range of strategies and patterns has evolved for overcoming challenges with large-scale development efforts (&gt;20 developers) or distributed (non-colocated) development teams, amongst other challenges; and there are now several recognized frameworks that seek to mitigate or avoid these challenges.

There are many conflicting viewpoints on whether all of these are effective or indeed fit the definition of agile development, and this remains an active and ongoing area of research.

When agile software development is applied in a distributed setting (with teams dispersed across multiple business locations), it is commonly referred to as distributed agile software development. The goal is to leverage the unique benefits offered by each approach. Distributed development allows organizations to build software by strategically setting up teams in different parts of the globe, virtually building software round-the-clock (more commonly referred to as follow-the-sun model). On the other hand, agile development provides increased transparency, continuous feedback, and more flexibility when responding to changes.

=== Regulated domains ===
Agile software development methods were initially seen as best suitable for non-critical product developments, thereby excluded from use in regulated domains such as medical devices, pharmaceutical, financial, nuclear systems, automotive, and avionics sectors, etc. However, in the last several years, there have been several initiatives for the adaptation of agile methods for these domains.

There are numerous standards that may apply in regulated domains, including ISO 26262, ISO 9000, ISO 9001, and ISO/IEC 15504.
A number of key concerns are of particular importance in regulated domains:

* Quality assurance (QA): Systematic and inherent quality management underpinning a controlled professional process and reliability and correctness of product.
* Safety and security: Formal planning and risk management to mitigate safety risks for users and securely protecting users from unintentional and malicious misuse.
*Traceability: Documentation providing auditable evidence of regulatory compliance and facilitating traceability and investigation of problems.
* Verification and validation (V&amp;V): Embedded throughout the software development process (e.g. user requirements specification, functional specification, design specification, code review, unit tests, integration tests, system tests).

==Experience and adoption==
Although agile software development methods can be used with any programming paradigm or language in practice, they were originally closely associated with object-oriented environments such as Smalltalk, Lisp and later Java, C#. The initial adopters of agile methods were usually small to medium-sized teams working on unprecedented systems with requirements that were difficult to finalize and likely to change as the system was being developed. This section describes common problems that organizations encounter when they try to adopt agile software development methods as well as various techniques to measure the quality and performance of agile teams.

===Measuring agility===

==== Internal assessments ====
The &quot;Agility measurement index&quot;, amongst others, rates developments against five dimensions of product development (duration, risk, novelty, effort, and interaction). Other techniques are based on measurable goals and one study suggests that velocity can be used as a metric of agility. There are also agile self-assessments to determine whether a team is using agile software development practices (Nokia test, Karlskrona test, 42 points test).

====Public surveys====
One of the early studies reporting gains in quality, productivity, and business satisfaction by using agile software developments methods was a survey conducted by Shine Technologies from November 2002 to January 2003.

A similar survey, the &quot;State of Agile&quot;, is conducted every year starting in 2006 with thousands of participants from around the software development community. This tracks trends on the perceived benefits of agility, lessons learned, and good practices. Each survey has reported increasing numbers saying that agile software development helps them deliver software faster; improves their ability to manage changing customer priorities; and increases their productivity. Surveys have also consistently shown better results with agile product development methods compared to classical project management. In balance, there are reports that some feel that agile development methods are still too young to enable extensive academic research of their success.

===Common agile software development pitfalls===
Organizations and teams implementing agile software development often face difficulties transitioning from more traditional methods such as waterfall development, such as teams having an agile process forced on them. These are often termed &quot;agile anti-patterns&quot; or more commonly &quot;agile smells&quot;. Below are some common examples:

====Lack of overall product design====
A goal of agile software development is to focus more on producing working software and less on documentation. This is in contrast to waterfall models where the process is often highly controlled and minor changes to the system require significant revision of supporting documentation. However, this does not justify completely doing without any analysis or design at all. Failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly at first, but then to require significant rework as they attempt to scale up the system. One of the key features of agile software development is that it is iterative. When done correctly, agile software development allows the design to emerge as the system is developed and helps the team discover commonalities and opportunities for re-use.

====Adding stories to an iteration in progress====
In agile software development, &quot;stories&quot; (similar to use case descriptions) are typically used to define requirements and an &quot;iteration&quot; is a short period of time during which the team commits to specific goals. Adding stories to an iteration in progress is detrimental to a good flow of work. These should be added to the product backlog and prioritized for a subsequent iteration or in rare cases the iteration could be cancelled.

This does not mean that a story cannot expand. Teams must deal with new information, which may produce additional tasks for a story. If the new information prevents the story from being completed during the iteration, then it should be carried over to a subsequent iteration. However, it should be prioritized against all remaining stories, as the new information may have changed the story&#x27;s original priority.

====Lack of sponsor support====
Agile software development is often implemented as a grassroots effort in organizations by software development teams trying to optimize their development processes and ensure consistency in the software development life cycle. By not having sponsor support, teams may face difficulties and resistance from business partners, other development teams and management. Additionally, they may suffer without appropriate funding and resources. This increases the likelihood of failure.

====Insufficient training====
A survey performed by VersionOne found respondents cited insufficient training as the most significant cause for failed agile implementations Teams have fallen into the trap of assuming the reduced processes of agile software development compared to other approaches such as waterfall means that there are no actual rules for agile software development. 

====Product owner role is not properly filled====
The product owner is responsible for representing the business in the development activity and is often the most demanding role.

A common mistake is to fill the product owner role with someone from the development team. This requires the team to make its own decisions on prioritization without real feedback from the business. They try to solve business issues internally or delay work as they reach outside the team for direction. This often leads to distraction and a breakdown in collaboration.

====Teams are not focused====
Agile software development requires teams to meet product commitments, which means they should focus on work for only that product. However, team members who appear to have spare capacity are often expected to take on other work, which makes it difficult for them to help complete the work to which their team had committed.

====Excessive preparation/planning====
Teams may fall into the trap of spending too much time preparing or planning. This is a common trap for teams less familiar with agile software development where the teams feel obliged to have a complete understanding and specification of all stories. Teams should be prepared to move forward with only those stories in which they have confidence, then during the iteration continue to discover and prepare work for subsequent iterations (often referred to as backlog refinement or grooming).

====Problem-solving in the daily standup====
A daily standup should be a focused, timely meeting where all team members disseminate information. If problem-solving occurs, it often can involve only certain team members and potentially is not the best use of the entire team&#x27;s time. If during the daily standup the team starts diving into problem-solving, it should be set aside until a sub-team can discuss, usually immediately after the standup completes.

====Assigning tasks====
One of the intended benefits of agile software development is to empower the team to make choices, as they are closest to the problem. Additionally, they should make choices as close to implementation as possible, to use more timely information in the decision. If team members are assigned tasks by others or too early in the process, the benefits of localized and timely decision making can be lost.

Being assigned work also constrains team members into certain roles (for example, team member A must always do the database work), which limits opportunities for cross-training. Team members themselves can choose to take on tasks that stretch their abilities and provide cross-training opportunities.

====Scrum master as a contributor====
In the Scrum framework, which claims to be consistent with agile values and principles, the &quot;scrum master&quot; role is accountable for ensuring the scrum process is followed and for coaching the scrum team through that process. A common pitfall is for a scrum master to act as a contributor. While not prohibited by the Scrum framework, the scrum master needs to ensure they have the capacity to act in the role of scrum master first and not work on development tasks. A scrum master&#x27;s role is to facilitate the process rather than create the product.

Having the scrum master also multitasking may result in too many context switches to be productive. Additionally, as a scrum master is responsible for ensuring roadblocks are removed so that the team can make forward progress, the benefit gained by individual tasks moving forward may not outweigh roadblocks that are deferred due to lack of capacity.

====Lack of test automation====

Due to the iterative nature of agile development, multiple rounds of testing are often needed. Automated testing helps reduce the impact of repeated unit, integration, and regression tests and frees developers and testers to focus on higher value work.

Test automation also supports continued refactoring required by iterative software development. Allowing a developer to quickly run tests to confirm refactoring has not modified the functionality of the application may reduce the workload and increase confidence that cleanup efforts have not introduced new defects.

====Allowing technical debt to build up====

Focusing on delivering new functionality may result in increased technical debt. The team must allow themselves time for defect remediation and refactoring. Technical debt hinders planning abilities by increasing the amount of unscheduled work as production defects distract the team from further progress.

As the system evolves it is important to refactor. Over time the lack of constant maintenance causes increasing defects and development costs.

====Attempting to take on too much in an iteration====
A common misconception is that agile software development allows continuous change, however an iteration backlog is an agreement of what work can be completed during an iteration. Having too much work-in-progress (WIP) results in inefficiencies such as context-switching and queueing. The team must avoid feeling pressured into taking on additional work.

====Fixed time, resources, scope, and quality====
Agile software development fixes time (iteration duration), quality, and ideally resources in advance (though maintaining fixed resources may be difficult if developers are often pulled away from tasks to handle production incidents), while the scope remains variable. The customer or product owner often pushes for a fixed scope for an iteration. However, teams should be reluctant to commit to the locked time, resources and scope (commonly known as the project management triangle). Efforts to add scope to the fixed time and resources of agile software development may result in decreased quality.

====Developer burnout====
Due to the focused pace and continuous nature of agile practices, there is a heightened risk of burnout among members of the delivery team.

== Agile management ==

Agile project management is an iterative development process, where feedback is continuously gathered from users and stakeholders to create the right user experience. Different methods can be used to perform an agile process, these include scrum, extreme programming, lean and kanban.
The term &quot;agile management&quot; is applied to an iterative, incremental method of managing the design and build activities of engineering, information technology and other business areas that aim to provide new product or service development in a highly flexible and interactive manner, based on the principles expressed in the &quot;Manifesto for Agile Software Development&quot;.
Agile project management metrics help reduce confusion, identify weak points, and measure team&#x27;s performance throughout the development cycle. Supply chain agility is the ability of a supply chain to cope with uncertainty and variability on offer and demand. An agile supply chain can increase and reduce its capacity rapidly, so it can adapt to a fast-changing customer demand. Finally, strategic agility is the ability of an organisation to change its course of action as its environment is evolving. The key for strategic agility is to recognize external changes early enough and to allocate resources to adapt to these changing environments.

Agile X techniques may also be called extreme project management. It is a variant of iterative life cycle where deliverables are submitted in stages. The main difference between agile and iterative development is that agile methods complete small portions of the deliverables in each delivery cycle (iteration), while iterative methods evolve the entire set of deliverables over time, completing them near the end of the project. Both iterative and agile methods were developed as a reaction to various obstacles that developed in more sequential forms of project organization. For example, as technology projects grow in complexity, end users tend to have difficulty defining the long-term requirements without being able to view progressive prototypes. Projects that develop in iterations can constantly gather feedback to help refine those requirements.

Agile management also offers a simple framework promoting communication and reflection on past work amongst team members. Teams who were using traditional waterfall planning and adopted the agile way of development typically go through a transformation phase and often take help from agile coaches who help guide the teams through a smoother transformation. There are typically two styles of agile coaching: push-based and pull-based agile coaching. Here a &quot;push-system&quot; can refer to an upfront estimation of what tasks can be fitted into a sprint (pushing work) e.g. typical with scrum; whereas a &quot;pull system&quot; can refer to an environment where tasks are only performed when capacity is available. Agile management approaches have also been employed and adapted to the business and government sectors. For example, within the federal government of the United States, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is employing a collaborative project management approach that focuses on incorporating collaborating, learning and adapting (CLA) strategies to iterate and adapt programming.

Agile methods are mentioned in the &quot;Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge&quot; (&quot;PMBOK Guide 6th Edition&quot;) under the Product Development Lifecycle definition:

=== Applications outside software development ===

According to Jean-Loup Richet (research fellow at ESSEC Institute for Strategic Innovation &amp; Services) &quot;this approach can be leveraged effectively for non-software products and for project management in general, especially in areas of innovation and uncertainty.&quot; The result is a product or project that best meets current customer needs and is delivered with minimal costs, waste, and time, enabling companies to achieve bottom line gains earlier than via traditional approaches.

Agile software development methods have been extensively used for development of software products and some of them use certain characteristics of software, such as object technologies. However, these techniques can be applied to the development of non-software products, such as computers, medical devices, food, clothing, and music. Agile software development methods have been used in non-development IT infrastructure deployments and migrations. Some of the wider principles of agile software development have also found application in general management (e.g., strategy, governance, risk, finance) under the terms business agility or agile business management. Agile software methodologies have also been adopted for use with the learning engineering process, an iterative data-informed process that applies the learning sciences, human-centered design, and data informed decision-making to support learners and their development.

Agile software development paradigms can be used in other areas of life such as raising children. Its success in child development might be founded on some basic management principles; communication, adaptation, and awareness. In a TED Talk, Bruce Feiler shared how he applied basic agile paradigms to household management and raising children.

== Criticism ==
Agile practices have been cited as potentially inefficient in large organizations and certain types of development. Many organizations believe that agile software development methodologies are too extreme and adopt a hybrid approach that mixes elements of agile software development and plan-driven approaches. Some methods, such as dynamic systems development method (DSDM) attempt this in a disciplined way, without sacrificing fundamental principles.

The increasing adoption of agile practices has also been criticized as being a management fad that simply describes existing good practices under new jargon, promotes a &quot;one size fits all&quot; mindset towards development strategies, and wrongly emphasizes method over results.

Alistair Cockburn organized a celebration of the 10th anniversary of the &quot;Manifesto for Agile Software Development&quot; in Snowbird, Utah on 12 February 2011, gathering some 30+ people who had been involved at the original meeting and since. A list of about 20 elephants in the room (&#x27;undiscussable&#x27; agile topics/issues) were collected, including aspects: the alliances, failures and limitations of agile software development practices and context (possible causes: commercial interests, decontextualization, no obvious way to make progress based on failure, limited objective evidence, cognitive biases and reasoning fallacies), politics and culture. As Philippe Kruchten wrote:

The &quot;Manifesto&quot; may have had a negative impact on higher education management and leadership, where it suggested to administrators that slower traditional and deliberative processes should be replaced with more &quot;nimble&quot; ones. The concept rarely found acceptance among university faculty.

Another criticism is that in many ways, agile management and traditional management practices end up being in opposition to one another. A common criticism of this practice is that the time spent attempting to learn and implement the practice is too costly, despite potential benefits. A transition from traditional management to agile management requires total submission to agile and a firm commitment from all members of the organization to seeing the process through. Issues like unequal results across the organization, too much change for employees&#x27; ability to handle, or a lack of guarantees at the end of the transformation are just a few examples.

<doc id="639018" wikidata="Q674327" url="?curid=639018" title="X League (women's football)">
<text>The Extreme Football League (X League) is a women&#x27;s semi-professional indoor American football league operating in the United States. The league was originally founded in 2009 as the Lingerie Football League (LFL), and later rebranded as the Legends Football League in 2013.

On December 13, 2019, the league announced that it would not be holding a 2020 season; instead, it had restructured under its current name, placing new teams mostly in the same locations as the 2019 LFL season. The league also did not operate during 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The X League&#x27;s eight-team 2022 season spanned June to September, concluding with the restructured league&#x27;s inaugural championship, the X Cup, won by the Chicago Blitz.

Since 2021, the league is owned by Mike Ditka, a former National Football League (NFL) player and an inductee of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Samantha Gordon was also named an owner in May 2022.

The league is scheduled for return in 2026, as a hybrid format of tackle and flag football.

==History==
===LFL===
====2009–2012====
The concept of the league originated from an alternative Super Bowl halftime television special called the Lingerie Bowl, a pay-per-view event broadcast opposite the Super Bowl halftime show.

In 2009, league chairman Mitch Mortaza expanded the concept from a single annual exhibition game to a ten-team league, branded as the Lingerie Football League, or LFL. The league operated on a similar schedule to the National Football League (NFL), playing in fall and winter and played most of its games indoors with similar rules to indoor football. Many of the teams were coached by former NFL players and coaches who were already well known in their respective cities. Many of the LFL players had a background in other competitive athletics at the college and semiprofessional level, as well as some experience in tackle football from playing in other semiprofessional leagues.

The initial uniforms consisted of shoulder pads, elbow pads, knee pads, performance wear, and ice hockey-style helmets with clear plastic visors in lieu of face masks. The original uniforms of the Lingerie Football League consisted of an athletic bra and underwear that were more revealing than protective, as well as added lace, ribbons, and garters as decoration. While these uniforms were routinely criticized by media, players&#x27; reactions were typically mixed on the use of the uniforms, comparing the similarities in coverage to track and field uniforms or beach volleyball bikinis.

====Expansion and rebranding: 2012–2019====

After three seasons, the league announced it was adding a companion league in Canada that began play in August 2012. It then pushed back the US season to 2013 on a spring and summer schedule, mirroring other indoor football leagues.

During the hiatus, the league announced it would change its name to the Legends Football League, retaining the LFL initials, on January 10, 2013. The league also announced that the athletes would wear &quot;performance apparel&quot; instead of lingerie, but the uniforms look very much the same as before. In addition to the new uniforms, redesigned shoulder pads were introduced to provide more protection for players. Other league changes included eliminating images of sexy women from team logos and changing the league tagline from &quot;True Fantasy Football&quot; to &quot;Women of the Gridiron&quot;. Along with the rebrand of the league in 2013, the league also began changing the uniforms as the originals were too heavy on sex appeal, initially dropping the ribbons and garters. The league designed new ones for the 2014 season closer to more traditional activewear, resembling uniforms similar to volleyball players, replacing the ribbons with shoelaces on the front of the top and bottom.

The LFL then began looking into a Latin American league with six franchises throughout Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. On September 16, 2013, the LFL postponed the entire 2013 LFL Canada season until 2014 with plans to merge the US, Canada, and Mexico teams into a single league called LFL North America.

The LFL then formed another league in Australia in December 2013 and played one season. LFL Australia&#x27;s debut season in the beginning of 2014 marked the debut of the new performance wear uniforms. The LFL planned to launch a fourth global league – LFL Europa – in 2015 with teams in Dublin (Ireland), Manchester (England), Düsseldorf and Hamburg (Germany). Barcelona (Spain) and Frankfurt (Germany) had previously been mentioned as potential franchise cities. With four global leagues, the league announced intentions to compete in a LFL World Bowl in São Paulo in 2015. By July 2014, the league planned a three leagues: LFL Americas, LFL Europa, and LFL Oceania. On June 10, 2015, the LFL announced that there would be no international play through at least 2017 with sole focus on growing the league in the US, the exception being international exhibition games to introduce prospective countries to the league.

The LFL announced new uniforms with new colors for the 2016 season. Numbers and logos were printed on the uniform as opposed to previously being sewn on. In addition, the league also announced that teams would have a choice of camouflage or black alternates. In 2017, the league also added a long pants uniform in lieu of the regular bikini bottom for the final home games.

===Extreme Football League===
====Hiatus and restructuring: 2020–present====
On December 13, 2019, the league announced that it would not be producing a 2020 season and would re-evaluate markets in the future. Four days later, the LFL was restructured into the Extreme Football League, which was announced to begin play in April 2020. The league size remained at eight teams, which initially were all in the same markets as the former LFL teams, but under new team identities. The Nashville Knights were the only team listed in the X League announcement to not change names, but they were replaced by the Kansas City Force in January 2020. As part of the league restructuring, it began offering ownership stakes to its players and coaches based on the individuals contributions and commitment to the organization, as well as revenue distribution program for merchandise featuring an individual player&#x27;s likeness. The league also said it was to use 70-yard fields in a press release, although this was never implemented. The league implements a new uniform with full pads.

The league&#x27;s first season was postponed to a scheduled start in June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, it had been announced that it was postponed again to April 2021. During the hiatus, the league announced Mike Ditka had been named owner and chairman of the league, with plans on expanding into 24 US markets. The season was ultimately cancelled on May 18, 2021, pushing the league&#x27;s relaunch to the summer of 2022 due to the pandemic.

The 2022 season began on June 10 with the Chicago Blitz facing the Kansas City Force. After a nine-week regular season with a total of seven games, four teams advanced to the playoffs, with the Blitz capturing the first X Cup title on September 10 when they defeated the Atlanta Empire.

The league did not announce plans for a 2023 season and later updated their website with plans to announce a 2024 schedule in October 2023. This was later updated again to indicate a 2025 schedule, to be announced October 15, 2024. The schedule would be pushed back and finally released on November 21, 2024, which revealed the league&#x27;s intentions to return in 2026.

==Rules==

Playing style is full-contact and similar to other indoor football leagues. There are seven players from each team on the field during play. The field is 50 yards between end zones, 30 yards wide, and the end zones are 8 yards deep, roughly the same as other indoor leagues. Many fields are just over 28 yards wide, as games are often played in converted National Hockey League-sized rinks (85 feet wide), with the plexiglass removed, dasher boards padded, and ice surfaces covered with artificial turf.

There are no kickoffs, except the option for an on-side kick should the game be close near the end, nor field goals; halves and after scores begin on team&#x27;s own 15-yard line. Kicking off after every scoring drive was added before the 2013 Pacific Cup, but was removed shortly after the first game of the LFL Australia season. A team must attempt to get a first down on every fourth down, or they risk a turnover. After a touchdown, a team can attempt a one-point conversion from the one-yard line, or a two-point conversion from the three-yard line. Since 2015, teams are given the option to punt if within their own 10 yard line; the ball is placed on the 15 or wherever it went out of bounds if the punt is not returned.

A game consists of four ten-minute quarters and a 12-minute halftime (30-minute halftime in championship). In the event of a tie, an extra eight-minute sudden death period is played; whoever scores first wins the game. If still tied, the game ends as a draw, and counts as tie for both teams in the standings. In postseason games, multiple 10-minute sudden death overtime periods are played until one team scores, which wins the game and advances to the next round or wins the championship. Teams get two timeouts per half or overtime period.

==Reception==
The league was met with criticism throughout its existence. Critics say the league degrades female athletes through &quot;pernicious objectification&quot;. The uniforms received extensive criticism for their revealing nature. In an ESPN article, Sarah Spain, the co-host of espnW, wrote, &quot;After watching these women play, I can honestly say I respect the heck out of them as athletes, but I&#x27;ll still never respect the Lingerie Football League, no matter what name they give it.&quot;

LFL players with experience in track and field competitions noted that the typical LFL uniform is comparable to other uniforms, with Elizabeth Govrick of the Minnesota Valkyrie stating she &quot;ran track and I was wearing, you know, stuff if not close to almost smaller than what I&#x27;m wearing out on the football field. You take beach volleyball, you take volleyball, you take other sports where it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing.&quot; Adrian Purnell of the Jacksonville Breeze said that the outfits were only for marketing purposes. Heather Furr, a quarterback for the Chicago Bliss said &quot;I think with little girls watching the game ... if they can see past the uniform and see us as role models, then that&#x27;s what I want.&quot; Abbie Sullivan of the Cleveland Crush stated, &quot;Just because we play in the LFL does not mean we promote promiscuity. We are smart females. We are athletes who take care of our bodies. We are the total package.&quot; Similarly, Toledo Crush player Marija Condric stated, &quot;Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Sit down and watch. You&#x27;ll forget what we are wearing and you will be thinking about how hard that girl got hit on that last play.&quot;

Other players are quoted as viewing the uniforms as a necessary evil, with one saying, &quot;Maybe one day, girls won&#x27;t have to wear lingerie to get people interested [in women&#x27;s football].&quot; Liz Gorman, a player with the Jacksonville Breeze, stated she would rather wear a conventional uniform: &quot;I mean, I don&#x27;t like it. You&#x27;d rather wear full clothing. I have a bunch of scrapes on me.&quot;

The league was accused in its earlier years of fining players for wearing too many clothes, as well as not paying medical bills for injured players. However, the league responded by claiming that fines were given because the equipment worn was in direct conflict with the league&#x27;s sponsored gear.

The league also prohibited players from commenting on personnel matters, a rule that prompted the vast majority of the Toronto Triumph, including team captain Krista Ford, to quit in protest in October 2011. Originally a professional league with players receiving a cut of net revenue, Mortaza stopped paying his players beginning in the 2011 season and converted the league into an amateur organization; players must also pay for their own health insurance. League founder Mortaza admitted at one point the league was marketed toward &quot;mostly beer-drinking college students aged 21 and up.&quot;

===Safety===

The league received many complaints from players in regards to safety. Since the uniforms covered very little skin, the players are more susceptible to injury. Ex-lingerie football player Nikki Johnson was one of the many players who experienced injuries in her time in the league including injuries sustained from hard hits and a broken wrist that required surgery.

==Seasons==
===2009–2010===

Ten teams played in the inaugural 2009–2010 LFL season. The league schedule ran from September 4, 2009, to January 29, 2010, with one game each Friday. Teams played one game each against the other four teams in their conference. The top two teams in each conference advanced to the conference championship games held on February 4, 2010, in Miami, and the conference champions played in Lingerie Bowl VII on February 6, 2010. The Western Conference Los Angeles Temptation defeated the Eastern Conference Chicago Bliss by the score of 27–14.

===2010–2011===

For the 2010–2011 season, the LFL added new franchises in Orlando and Baltimore, while the New York Majesty and Denver Dream suspended operations. The 2011 Lingerie Bowl was held in Las Vegas, Nevada, on February 6, 2011. The Western Conference champion Los Angeles Temptation defeated Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia Passion, 26–25.

The 2011 All-Fantasy Game was held in Hamilton, Ontario, on July 30, 2011, at Copps Coliseum. Trailing 18–6 in the second half, the Eastern Conference rallied to win, 24–18, over the Western Conference. Anonka Dixon, quarterback for the Orlando Fantasy, was awarded offensive MVP for her 3 touchdown passes and game-winning rushing touchdown, while Liz Gorman, a safety with the Tampa Breeze, was named defensive MVP.

===2011–2012===
The LFL accepted five expansion franchises – the Cleveland Crush, Green Bay Chill, Las Vegas Sin, Minnesota Valkyrie, and Toronto Triumph, while the Dallas Desire, San Diego Seduction, and Miami Caliente suspended operations. The season kicked off on August 26, 2011, and culminated with Lingerie Bowl IX on February 4, 2012. The LFL Eastern and Western Conference championship games were played back-to-back on January 28, 2012, at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California. For the second straight year, the Los Angeles Temptation won the Western Conference championship while the Philadelphia Passion won the Eastern Conference championship, setting up a rematch in the 2012 Lingerie Bowl of the previous year&#x27;s championship game. The 2012 Lingerie Bowl was played at Orleans Arena in Las Vegas, in the afternoon prior to the start of Super Bowl XLVI. The Los Angeles Temptation won its third consecutive Lingerie Bowl with a 28–6 victory over Philadelphia Passion. The Temptation&#x27;s Ashley Salerno and Amber Reed were co-MVP&#x27;s, with Salerno throwing three touchdown passes and Reed scoring two rushing touchdowns.

In 2012, the LFL expanded its annual &quot;All-Fantasy&quot; game into a three-game international series, with one game in Mexico and two games in Australia. The Mexico All-Fantasy Game took place on May 5, 2012, at the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City; the Western Conference defeated the Eastern Conference, 37–7. The second match of the &quot;2012 LFL All-Fantasy Tour&quot; took place in Brisbane, Australia, on June 2, 2012, at the Brisbane Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre; the Western Conference again emerged victorious, this time by a 45–36 score. The Western Conference took a 3–0 series sweep with a 31–24 victory in the third and final &quot;All-Fantasy&quot; match in Sydney, Australia, on June 9, 2012, at Allphones Arena. Queensland native and wide receiver for the Los Angeles Temptation Chloe Butler served as the ambassador of LFL Football coming to Australia and captained the Western Conference squad. The LFL then helped found the Ladies Gridiron League in Australia to serve as a minor league for the announced LFL Australia expansion.

===2012 Canada===

For the 2011–12 LFL United States season, the All-Fantasy Game was played in Hamilton, Ontario. This was due in part to the league&#x27;s announcement that in 2012 there would be a Canadian Lingerie Football League. LFL Canada was originally scheduled for a twelve-week season with teams in six markets.

On September 28, 2011, it was announced that, in addition to the Toronto Triumph who began play in LFL United States, LFL Canada&#x27;s other five markets would consist of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, and Montreal; ironically, none of those five markets would actually get an LFL franchise. On February 9, 2012, the LFL announced that Abbotsford, British Columbia, would be the next Canadian city to host a team in the League. The franchise played its home games at the Abbotsford Entertainment &amp; Sports Centre and competed in the Western Division of LFL Canada. On February 20, 2012, the LFL announced that the franchise would be named the BC Angels following the results of an online fan vote. The decision for Abbotsford to host a team sparked some controversy, including expressed concern from at least one city councilor, as &quot;Abbotsford is a deeply religious agricultural community.&quot;

On February 22, 2012, the LFL announced that Regina, Saskatchewan, would be the next Canadian city to host a team in the League. Home games would be played at the Brandt Centre. On March 6, the LFL announced that the franchise would be named the Regina Rage after an online fan vote.

Six days later, on February 28, the LFL announced that Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, would join Regina as LFL Canada&#x27;s second team in the Wheat Province. Home games would be played at the Credit Union Centre. Upon releasing the Saskatoon Sirens&#x27; logo and colors, the league announced that LFL Canada was set at four teams for the 2012 season, with the league playing an eight-game schedule, scheduled to end with Lingerie Bowl I Canada the week before the Grey Cup.

The 2012 LFL Canada season began on August 25, 2012, and culminated with Lingerie Bowl Canada I on November 17, 2012, between the Saskatoon Sirens and the BC Angels at the Abbotsford Entertainment &amp; Sports Centre in Abbotsford, British Columbia. The BC Angels won the inaugural championship game 25–12 with BC Angels&#x27; quarterback Mary Anne Hanson and receiver Aleesa Garcia named as the game&#x27;s MVPs.

On December 15, 2012, the first annual Pacific Cup was played between the Seattle Mist of LFL US and the BC Angels of LFL Canada. Dubbed the &#x27;Border War&#x27;, the game was hosted by the Seattle Mist at the ShoWare Center in Kent, Washington, with home venues alternating each season.

===2013 season===


The league delayed the next LFL US season from fall/winter 2012 to April 2013 in order to shift to a spring/summer schedule and to focus on the 2012 LFL Canada season.
On June 27, 2013, the 2013 LFL Canada schedule was released. LFL Canada accepted one proposed expansion team, the Calgary Fillies; their home games would be played at the Stampede Corral. Meanwhile, the Toronto Triumph suspended operations for the 2013 season, bringing the number of LFL Canada teams back to four. On September 16, 2013, the LFL then postponed the entire 2013 LFL Canada season until 2014.

However, the BC Angels were expected to participate in the second-annual Pacific Cup, an exhibition game between the Angels and LFL US&#x27;s Seattle Mist scheduled for December 2013. On October 3, it was announced that the Angels would be replaced in the game by the LA Temptation, citing not enough preparation. The Pacific Cup was played at ShoWare Center on December 6, 2013. Several key players from the Angels joined the Mist while a few key players from Las Vegas Sin joined the Temptation.

===2013–14 Australia===

Following the two All-Fantasy games held in Australia in 2012, LFL Australia premiered in December 2013. Prior to the playing a game, the LFL&#x27;s deal with the Ladies Gridiron League (LGL) fell through and the LGL no longer served as a minor league to the LFL. The New South Wales Surge, Queensland Brigade, Victoria Maidens, and Western Australia Angels participated in the inaugural 2013–14 LFL Australia season. The LFL Australia Legends Cup was played on February 8, 2014, at nib Stadium in Perth, Western Australia.

On March 23, 2014, LFL Australia accepted one proposed expansion team, the Adelaide Arsenal, with home games to be played at the Coopers Stadium. However, on September 29, the 2014–2015 season was cancelled due to the lack of a broadcast partner with competition planned to resume in 2015–2016 including an expansion into New Zealand.

In February 2015, it was revealed that the players and coaches had actually left after disputes and issues with LFL management, namely commissioner Mortaza. Players and coaches left and joined the Ladies Gridiron League, originally a subsidiary of the LFL now operating as its own league.

===2014 season===

In the 2013 offseason, the LFL announced that the Philadelphia Passion and Minnesota Valkyrie had suspended operations for the 2014 LFL US season.

It was also announced that the Cleveland Crush were moving to Toledo, Ohio, and play its home games at the Huntington Center.

===2015 season===
===2016 season===

On September 16, 2015, Austin, Texas, received an expansion team for 2016 to play at the Cedar Park Center and the name was announced as the Austin Acoustic. On November 2, it was announced that Dallas, Texas, would rejoin the league in 2016 after being on hiatus since the end of the 2010–2011 season, retaining the Dallas Desire name, at Dr Pepper Arena. The Las Vegas Sin then suspended operations. A team was also added for New England bringing the league&#x27;s total to eight teams.

During the season, New England was forced to forfeit its final game as injuries caused the team to have below the minimum number of players needed to field a team. Seattle won a three-way tie with Dallas and Los Angeles for the best record in the Western Conference while Chicago had the best record in the Eastern Conference. Chicago and Atlanta advanced to the playoffs in the East while Seattle and Dallas advanced in the West. Chicago and Seattle won their Conference Championships and advanced to the Legends Cup in a rematch of both the previous championship and a meeting earlier in the season though with the opposite result of those two prior matches. The season ended on August 27, 2016, with the Chicago Bliss defeating the Seattle Mist 31–26 to win their third Legends Cup. The championship game was played at WestWorld in Scottsdale, Arizona.

===2017 season===

The 2017 season began with new teams at Pittsburgh and Denver replacing New England and Dallas. Three teams (Chicago, Los Angeles, and Seattle) completed the regular season with perfect 4–0 records, a first in LFL history. Chicago and Atlanta advanced to the playoffs from the East while Seattle and Los Angeles advanced in the West. Atlanta upset Chicago in the Eastern Conference Championship, their first victory against the Bliss following seven consecutive defeats. In a war of unbeatens, Seattle bested Los Angeles in the Western Conference Championship. The season ended on September 3, 2017, as the Seattle Mist beat the Atlanta Steam 38–28 in the Legends Cup, played at the Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California, to cap off their perfect 6–0 season to go with their second LFL title.

===2018 season===
===2019 season===

The 2019 season was the tenth and final season of the Legends Football League. It began April 5 and concluded on August 10.

===2022 season===

Following a regular season reduced to two games per team, the Chicago Blitz defeated the Atlanta Empire in the first X Cup championship game, 19–12.

===2023-2024===
Initially, the league&#x27;s website stated tickets would be &quot;on sale October 2023&quot; and &quot;2024 schedule released October&quot; but in October these were changed to &quot;December 2023&quot;. In December 2023 they would again be changed, this time to &quot;Coming soon&quot; instead. In February 2024, the league announced it has pushed back its restart from the 2024 season until May 3, 2025, with the schedule to be announced in October 2024.

==Media==
===Broadcasts===
In 2010, MTV2 licensed the broadcast rights to 20 regular season and two conference playoff games and aired highlights of those games on a program entitled &quot;LFL Presents: LFL, Friday Night Football on MTV2&quot;. For the 2011–12 season, MTV2 also broadcast the championship game, in addition to presenting the games in their entirety and broadcasting them live at 9:00 PM ET.

In 2013, the league began airing their games exclusively online on a week-delayed basis, releasing their games every Saturday on YouTube. Games are shot in 1080i.

At the start of the 2013–2014 Australia season, LFL signed an agreement with 7mate in Australia to broadcast games every Saturday night.

In 2015, Fuse became the exclusive broadcaster of LFL games in the United States. Games are broadcast on a week-delay basis on Saturday nights, and are later uploaded to YouTube on Fridays. In the Fall, Oxygen premiered the reality series, &quot;Pretty. Strong.&quot;, which focuses on the lives and careers of the Chicago Bliss. The show was produced by Relativity Television.

For the 2016 season, games were broadcast in select markets on affiliates of The CW and MyNetworkTV as well as Regional sports networks on a week-delayed basis.

In 2017, Super Channel became the exclusive Canadian broadcaster of all LFL games through the 2019 season. Super Channel used the LFL to launch its &quot;Super Channel SPORTS&quot; sub-brand for all sporting and events and sports-themed programming. Meanwhile, Eleven Sports Network acquired the broadcast rights to the LFL in the United States.

In May 2022, the league announced on Twitter that it would be launching a new subscription service called &quot;Fan Pass&quot; to directly stream games live and on-demand.

===Fantasy football===
In 2011, the Legends Football League partnered with Fantazzle Fantasy Sports to present a fantasy football game for the LFL. It was relaunched in 2013 as &quot;LFL PartyDeck&quot;.

===Video game===

<text>Alceste De Ambris (15 September 1874 – 9 December 1934) was an Italian journalist, socialist activist and syndicalist, considered one of the greatest representatives of revolutionary syndicalism in Italy.

== Early life and involvement with socialism ==
De Ambris was born in Licciana Nardi, province of Massa-Carrara, as the first of the eight children of Francesco De Ambris and Valeria Ricci. His father was a Mazzinian Republican and from an early age De Ambris showed an interest in politics. The miserable condition of the Lunigiana workers and their struggles led him to join socialism at the age of 18, becoming a militant and propagandist for the Italian Socialist Party in 1892 and taking part in the formation of numerous socialist circles in his region, especially those in Aulla and La Spezia, of which he was a member.

In 1893, at the age of 19, he enrolled in the law course at the University of Parma and stood out for his participation in the political life of the province, helping to organize the workers movement in the region. De Ambris had some socialist professors at the university and lived in the working class district of Parma, Oltretorrente. He enrolled in the law course between 1893 and 1895, but didn&#x27;t complete it because of his political militancy. During this period, he joined the workers and other students of Parma in protests against the Italian colonial wars in Africa and in 1896 he was targeted by the authorities and accused of defamation in the press.

In 1897, he was called up for compulsory military service in La Spezia, where he tried to desert to join a group of Italian Republicans who went to fight for Greece in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. De Ambris believed that Greece had established &quot;a community of the free and equal, animated by fraternity and solidarity and capable of sacrifice&quot;, representing what he wanted to build in Italy. He used the Greek example in opposition to conservative Italian nationalism, affirming an idea of solidarity with oppressed peoples fighting for freedom. Although some sources claim that De Ambris was arrested for attempted desertion, others claim that he was not punished.

In 1898, he was involved in writing the newspaper &quot;La Terra&quot;, whose articles denounced the conditions of the peasants of Massa-Carrara, who had almost all their time taken up by work, to which they devoted 10 hours in winter and 15 in summer, on land that was not always fertile. In the same year, a series of popular protests against the rising price of bread took place in Italy. De Ambris was once again called up for military service to suppress the protests, but he didn&#x27;t show up and, to escape arrest, he expatriated clandestinely to France, where he met other Italians fleeing repression. He went to Cannes and then to Marseille, where he worked for a few months in the port and lived with difficulties. The Florence Military Court sentenced him to a year&#x27;s imprisonment for desertion. De Ambris then left for Brazil.

== His first stay in Brazil and the &quot;Avanti!&quot; ==

De Ambris arrived in Brazil illegally on a ship from Italy, along with other poor immigrants attracted by the promises of the Brazilian government, which at the time was encouraging European immigration. Alceste initially intended to go to Montevideo, but spent some time in Rio de Janeiro living with his brothers Alfredo and Angelo, who had already been in Brazil since 1894, and was convinced by them to remain in the country. He later settled in São Paulo. Shaken by the torments he saw during the 25-day journey by ship, he decided to study the living and working conditions of the Italian immigrants on the coffee plantations and travelled on one of the trains that took the workers to the plantations, departing from the Hospedaria dos Imigrantes, in Brás, and helped the immigrants to organize themselves into associations and syndicates.

In 1900, he took part in the founding of the socialist newspaper &quot;Avanti!&quot;, which took its name from its Italian namesake and intended to be an organ at the service of workers and social struggles. The newspaper had a good circulation among the Italian community in São Paulo and, in general, advocated social reforms that could benefit the working class and the formation of workers associations of resistance aimed at improving workers living conditions. &quot;Avanti!&quot; was one of the first left-wing periodicals to be published in Brazil, and its editors sought to unite their efforts with the various socialist tendencies, so that in the pages of the newspaper there was room for more reformist positions, such as those of Alcebíades Bertolotti, and also for more radical positions, such as those of De Ambris. At the end of September 1901, when the newspaper was about to complete a year in circulation, De Ambris published an article in which he invited workers in Brazil to organize themselves autonomously, claiming that many improvements could be achieved directly through the action and organization of the working class. In the following issue, Bertolotti, in response, argued that workers organizations had the aim of raising wages and improving the lives of the working class, but that this should not lead to the conclusion that economic associations should disregard the role of the state and the party and that workers organizations could not and should not, in a way, exert pressure on them. Despite the polemics, the socialist idea of the need for a trade union for economic struggles and a party for political struggles prevailed in &quot;Avanti!&quot;. De Ambris himself, at a socialist congress held between 30 May and 2 June 1902, defended electoral action, declaring the need for socialists to register on electoral lists and inviting foreigners to abandon nationalism and become naturalized in order to enjoy the right to vote.

He was also an active member of the &quot;Lega Democratica Italiana&quot; and the &quot;Circolo Socialista Avanti!&quot; in the same period, and held several conferences in the city of São Paulo. He also made a number of propaganda trips to the interior of the state, where he helped to found socialist leagues and clubs. On 12 January 1901 &quot;Avanti!&quot; announced the first efforts to set up a socialist party, and in February, the militants gathered around the newspaper observed with great enthusiasm the strikes that broke out in São Paulo, especially after the strike at the Álvares Penteado textile factory, which spread to other categories. The victory of the strikers at the Penteado textile factory, who were demanding the reinstatement of the old tariff, a reduction in fines and measures to put an end to mistreatment, was seen as a great triumph by the newspaper. De Ambris and Bertolotti, who on behalf of &quot;Avanti!&quot; acted as intermediaries during the negotiations, went to Brás to tell the strikers about the victory as soon as they heard the news. &quot;Avanti!&quot; also ran a campaign on behalf of Angelo Longaretti, an Italian peasant who killed the owner of the factory where he worked, Diogo Eugenio Sales, brother of Campos Sales, then President of the Republic of Brazil.

Alceste and his brother Angelo were in São Paulo when they received the news that their mother had died unexpectedly. The editors of &quot;Avanti!&quot; sent affectionate greetings to both of them. In September 1901, he stepped down as editor of the newspaper, arguing that he wanted to devote more time to propaganda and start work on the &quot;Socialist Almanac&quot; for 1902, which was published a few months later with texts, portraits and caricatures. This almanac featured an introduction written by De Ambris, a text entitled &quot;&quot;Integral Socialism&quot; by the socialist Enrico Ferri, a text on socialism by Estevam Estrella, some poetry and short stories by Giovanni Cena, Raul Pompeia, Edmondo De Amicis and De Ambris himself, entitled &quot;La rivolta&quot; (scene della vita di fazenda)&quot;, which told the story of Angelo Longaretti and the difficulties of rural work, which led this settler to the extreme gesture of murdering the farmer. In 1902, he returned to the management of &quot;Avanti!&quot; and took part in a socialist congress held between the end of May and the beginning of June that year.

In April 1903, the São Paulo court sentenced him to 4 months and 20 days in prison for defamation through the press against industrialist Nicola Matarazzo. His brother Alfredo, who was a lawyer, defended Alceste during the expulsion process, seeking to have the case reviewed by the Supreme Court in Rio de Janeiro so that the sentence could be overturned. However, given that his conviction for desertion had been amnestied, De Ambris preferred to return to Italy.

== Approximation with revolutionary syndicalism and the Parma strike of 1908 ==
In Brazil, De Ambris became an experienced organizer and a journalist famous for his tenacity and the strength of his polemics. Back in Italy, he went on to hold important positions in syndicalism associations. As soon as he returned, he became secretary of the Chamber of Labor in Savona, Liguria, working mainly with metalworkers. At the end of 1904, he moved from Savona to the secretariat of the National Glassmakers&#x27; Federation, based in Livorno, Tuscany, then one of the most militant associations in Italy. Even from a distance, he also coordinated the work of Italian socialists in Brazil and was a correspondent for the newspaper &quot;Fanfulla&quot;.

During this period, he became close to revolutionary syndicalism, a concept that was gaining strength among the workers and radicalized elements of the Italian Socialist Party, especially after the general strike of 1904, driven by revolutionary syndicalists and radical socialists who were gaining strength in the Parma Chamber of Labor. Commenting on a congress of Italian socialists held in Switzerland in an article for the periodical &quot;Fanfulla&quot; in 1905, De Ambris noted the strength that this conception was gaining within the Italian Socialist Party. The syndicalist proposals had been defeated, but by a difference of 363 votes against 402 for the reformists. At the end of that year, De Ambris was in Rome and began collaborating with Enrico Leone&#x27;s &quot;Divenire Sociale&quot;, &quot;La Gioventù Socialista&quot;, the organ of the National Socialist Youth Federation, and &quot;Il Sindacato Operaio&quot;, writing articles that made clear his stance in favor of revolutionary syndicalism, affirming that the trade union was the instrument that would bring about the transformation of society and enable the proletariat to manage power, determining through struggle the transition from the state to the economic organization of the class, and defending the autonomy of syndicates from political parties. For De Ambris, parliamentary socialism had abandoned its proletarian and aggressive character to stagnate in a legalism and &quot;petty bourgeois&quot; humanitarianism with the pretension of representing &quot;general interests&quot;, sacrificing the interests of the working class in whose name it had arisen and asserted itself. This process had been going on since 1901, when the Italian Socialist Party began to collaborate with the liberal governments of Giuseppe Zanardelli and Giovanni Giolitti. Revolutionary syndicalism thus appeared as an alternative to reformist socialism.

De Ambris spent a brief period in Bagnone with his father and some of his brothers in 1906, where he gave lectures and collaborated with the newspaper &quot;La Terra&quot;, which was re-founded that year. He was with his family in Lunigiana when some friends wrote to him in 1907, asking him to take up the post of secretary of the Parma Chamber of Labor. De Ambris enthusiastically accepted the invitation, and in November, he became editor of the periodical &quot;L&#x27;Internazionale&quot;, considered the &quot;great mouthpiece of revolutionary syndicalism&quot;. Before his arrival, the Chamber of Labor was still controlled by the reformists, but most of the workers who were part of it had been adopting more radical stances since the 1904 strike. When he took over as general secretary of the organization, the workers movement in the province of Parma was going through a period of crisis, after successive defeats and because of the split between the moderate and radical socialists and between the city and country leagues. The invitation to De Ambris to head the Chamber of Labour was conceived as an attempt to reorganize the movement, given the great prestige he had in the region. Seeking to respond to the workers desire to democratize the unions, De Ambris, as secretary of the Parma Chamber of Labour, tried to create instruments that would guarantee members the possibility of effectively influencing the choices that involved them. Representations and meetings multiplied and referendums were used in the case of the most important decisions, such as whether or not to start a strike. In just a few months, the Chamber&#x27;s membership grew to 30,000. In addition, De Ambris did his best to avoid political divisions within the union, considering that if the workers considered it useful to launch the organization into the electoral struggle, this decision should be taken unanimously among the workers organized in the Chamber. In 1907, after De Ambris took over as secretary of the Parma Chamber of Labor, the association won some victories over the Agrarian Association, which brought together landowners and tenants in the region.

Under the leadership of Alceste De Ambris, the Parma Chamber of Labor declared a general strike on 1 May 1908 in response to the owners who were trying to disregard the gains made the previous year, such as the enforcement of contracts, wage increases, better working conditions and the recognition of the right of association. The strike involved around 30,000 workers from various municipalities in the province of Parma. The local bourgeoisie and landowners reacted violently to the movement, clashing with the workers. In the first days of the strike, the Socialist Party, the General Confederation of Labor (CGL) and the National Federation of Agricultural Workers (Federterra) took positions in support of the strikers, but avoided intervening in the conflict. The paralyzed workers, for their part, refused to negotiate with the owners through representatives of the CGL and Federterra, adopting methods of direct action to obtain the improvements and rights they were demanding. After 50 days on strike, the owners hired workers from other regions to replace the strikers. There were clashes around the train station, where some demonstrators tried to prevent the scabs from disembarking. In the working class district of Oltretorrente, the police clashed with the workers, who declared a general strike. Workers from the countryside also went to the city and there were clashes with the cavalry. The Socialist Party and the CGL tried unsuccessfully to convince the workers not to join the call for a general strike. In the face of the repression that followed the movement, the union headquarters were raided and all those present were arrested. At the end of July, the Agrarian Association made it possible to return to work, and only a few areas remained in turmoil. During this period, De Ambris received the news of the death of his only sister, Irma, at the age of 30.

At the end of the strike, the Parma Royal Prosecutor&#x27;s Office prosecuted the syndicalists, accusing them of having promoted and attempted an armed insurrection against the state during the strike. De Ambris was accused of being the head of the association and of throwing stones at a policeman from a window. In view of the tension that had built up between workers in the city and the countryside during the months of unrest, the trial was transferred from Parma to Lucca. Among the defense lawyers for the accused syndicalists and workers were Arturo Labriola, Pietro Gori and some socialist deputies. The police themselves, a delegate and a commissioner, ended up defending the strikers, claiming that the movement had no insurrectionary character, but only an economic objective. In May 1909, all the accused were acquitted and released. The prosecuted syndicalists and workers were welcomed with parties in Parma, where people carried portraits of Alceste De Ambris, Giuseppe Garibaldi and Jesus Christ.

== The second time in Brazil and &quot;La Scure&quot; ==
De Ambris managed to avoid arrest during the repression that followed the Parma strike and left for Switzerland in July 1908. From there, he went to France, where he took part with Edmondo Rossoni, Pulvio Zocchi and Ottavio Dinale in the 10th Congress of the C&quot;onfédération Générale du Travail&quot; (CGT), held in October 1908. He then came to Brazil for the second time, invited by Vitaliano Rotellini to run the newspaper &quot;La Tribuna Italiana&quot;, guaranteeing respect for his ideas and principles. Rotellini sent the money and De Ambris arrived in Brazil at the end of 1908.

De Ambris remained at the helm of &quot;La Tribuna Italiana&quot; for ten months, receiving criticism from Italian industrialists based in São Paulo and anarchist militants, who denounced his complicity with the &quot;bourgeois press&quot;. When Rotellini decided to control De Ambris&#x27;s direction of the newspaper, he left the paper and, in 1910, founded &quot;La Scure&quot;, whose first issue came out in April. Noticing the demobilization of the São Paulo workers movement, he gave the newspaper a direction that would bring together all groups with a democratic tendency, who defended the political rights of citizens, freedom to organize and strike, freedom of expression and the press. It declared itself to be the only Italian-language newspaper published in Brazil that was absolutely independent and free of any interest or party ties, criticizing the consular and diplomatic representatives maintained by Italy in Brazil and its institutions, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the Dante Alighieri school and the Colonial Institute, controlled by conservative monarchists.

As well as running &quot;La Scure&quot;, De Ambris made a series of propaganda trips to the interior of the state of São Paulo, giving talks in Campinas, Ribeirão Preto, Jardinópolis, Sertãozinho, Jaboticabal, Araraquara, São Carlos, Bauru, São Manuel and Botucatu, where he spoke on topics such as mutualism, resistance, cooperation and syndicalism.

In the issue of 21 May 1910 &quot;La Scure&quot; announced that, for work reasons, De Ambris was going to Rio de Janeiro, where he would only stay for a few weeks. However, he ended up staying in Rio for longer, where he continued to write &quot;La Scure&quot; and worked at the Havas Information Agency. During his time in Rio, he joined a group of bohemian writers that included Olavo Bilac, and even wrote a novel, which was published in chapters in São Paulo&#x27;s &quot;Avanti!.&quot; After his stay in Rio de Janeiro and shaken by the death of his brother Alfredo from yellow fever, De Ambris left for France in 1911.

== Return to Italy, participation in the First World War and Fiume expedition ==

On arriving in Europe, De Ambris was in Lugano, Switzerland, between 1911 and 1912, from where he took over the management of &quot;L&#x27;Internazionale&quot;. Shortly before returning to Italy, he entered into controversy with syndicalists in favor of the Libyan War, in particular Arturo Labriola. While Labriola tried to justify the colonial war as an economic and national necessity, accusing the syndicalists against it of being in agreement with the reformists, De Ambris accused Labriola and the pro-war syndicalists of being in agreement with the prime minister, Giolitti, the king, the bankers, the army and the Vatican. For him, national syndicalism that tried to identify the interests of the proletariat with those of militarism &quot;was already condemned to death&quot;. Faced with the controversy caused between pro-war and anti-war syndicalists, a bloc formed with the Parma group that was inclined to split from the CGL and form a new syndicalism body. Although a considerable part of the syndicalism movement considered it important to save the unity of the workers organization, the advocates of separation reached a consensus throughout 1912, which was consummated in November with the creation of the Unione Sindacale Italiana (USI), which was initially joined by 80,000 workers. Alceste De Ambris was one of its leaders.

In October 1913, he was elected to the legislature of Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy, with popular plebiscitary vote in the Electoral College of Parma - Reggio Emilia - Modena for the Partito Socialista Italiano for a term that would last until September 1919. With parliamentary immunity, he was able to return to Italy, where he was welcomed by a crowd in Parma. During his mandate, he devoted himself above all to syndicalism organization. In 1914, after the death of three anti-militarist demonstrators, outbreaks of insurrection spread across much of Italy for a week, which became known as &quot;Red Week&quot;. In several regions, public buildings were stormed and telegraph and railway lines were sabotaged. Anarchists, communists, socialists, liberals, republicans and syndicalists took part in the unrest. Alceste De Ambris called on the workers of Parma to sell their bicycles and buy revolvers. However, the failure of the movement discouraged De Ambris, who was disillusioned by the unpreparedness of the workers and the revolutionary forces. Regretting the disputes between the various left-wing currents, he began to support a federalist and republican program that could bring together all the progressive forces. His project, however, received criticism from all sides, especially the syndicalists, who saw it as a move away from De Ambris.

With the outbreak of the First World War, the leading group of the USI decided to support the military efforts of the Allies against the Central Powers. De Ambris was one of the most determined supporters of interventionism, he engineered the split within the Milanese Syndical Union (USM) through his 18 August 1914 public speech, arguing that interventionism was in favor of the fundamental freedoms of Western democratic nations, and was followed by Filippo Corridoni. As a partisan of national syndicalism, he believed the war to represent an opportunity equal to the impact of the French Revolution, and took his supporters (USM and Parma Labor Chamber) out of the &quot;Unione Sindacale Italiana&quot; to found the &quot;Fasci d&#x27;Azione Rivoluzionaria Internazionalista&quot;. The manifesto of the new movement attracted Benito Mussolini, who led his own movement, the &quot;Fasci Autonomi d&#x27;Azione Rivoluzionaria&quot;, into a merger that gave birth to &quot;Fasci d&#x27;Azione Rivoluzionaria&quot;. The pro-war leaders and factions ended up abandoning the USI, whose secretariat passed to the anarchist Armando Borghi. In 1918, the syndicalists who had left the USI formed the Unione Italiana del Lavoro (UIL), which aimed to unite workers who wanted to develop their action independently of any political party and taking into account the general conditions of development and freedom in Italy, stating that they should not renounce their homeland, &quot;but conquer it by radically renewing its institutions&quot;. This organization was initially supported by De Ambris, and Edmondo Rossoni was its secretary. Many of the UIL&#x27;s leaders and militants, including Rossoni, converted to fascism. In the same year, in co-authorship with the poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti he wrote The Manifesto of the Italian Fasces of Combat.

When Italy entered the war, De Ambris enlisted as a volunteer, believing that the conflict could trigger a revolutionary transformation. The Russian Revolution of 1917 seemed to confirm his thesis, and he said that, like Russia, Italy could rid itself of &quot;foreigners, tyrants, the temporal power of the popes&quot; and &quot;carry out all the most daring political and social liberations&quot;. At the end of the war, he became close to the poet Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio, accompanying him on the expedition to Fiume. The city was the subject of a dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia, and in September 1919, some rebel military sectors, with some groups of volunteers, under the command of d&#x27;Annunzio, occupied Fiume, which was under international control, and declared its annexation to Italy. De Ambris was one of d&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s political advisors and was responsible for the constitution of Fiume, the so-called &quot;Carta del Carnaro&quot;.
De Ambris&#x27;s text for the constitution of the so-called Italian Regency of Carnaro guaranteed freedoms of thought, the press, assembly, association, civil equality between the sexes, the secular character of the state, universal secret, direct and proportional voting, the possibility of revoking the offices of those invested with public functions, free schools, social security and considered property to be a social function, not an individual right or privilege. All citizens, including women, had to do military service. The regime installed in Fiume was to be a direct democracy based on productive work, with local and functional autonomy as its organic criterion. Another striking feature of the &quot;Carta del Carnaro&quot; was corporatism. Fiume&#x27;s constitution stated that all citizens who contributed to the material prosperity and civil development of the Republic through continuous manual and intellectual work were considered productive citizens and had to be compulsorily enrolled in guilds of workers, farmers, merchants, administrators, civil servants, teachers and liberal professionals. The guilds were to have full autonomy in terms of their organization and internal workings. Because of its corporatism, some historians have established a link between the &quot;Carta del Carnaro&quot; and fascism. However, other researchers see it as a kind of synthesis of the concepts adopted by De Ambris during his socialist and syndicalist activism. The draft constitution was approved by D&#x27;Annunzio on 18 March 1920. The English and French workers&#x27; organizations saw Fiume&#x27;s expedition as an imperialist undertaking and called on Italian workers to boycott. The UIL, influenced by De Ambris, however, declared its support for Fiume&#x27;s enterprise. Other left-wing leaders showed some sympathy for Fiume. Antonio Gramsci, who distrusted D&#x27;Annunzio, considered that his movement had appreciable popular elements, and Lenin advised an alliance of the Soviet Union with Carnaro&#x27;s Italian Regency.

In addition to drafting the Fiume constitution, De Ambris was also the secretary for civil affairs of the Liberation Army Command and was appointed chief of staff of the Dannunzian command on 10 June 1920. He worked to disrupt relations between the Fiume legionnaires and the fascists, seeking the support of the workers movement. After the Treaty of Rapallo and the repression of the Fiume expedition on 24 December 1920, De Ambris tried to keep the former legionaries together, trying to prevent them from falling under fascist and nationalist influence. However, D&#x27;Annunzio himself ended up converting to fascism.

== Exile and last years ==
De Ambris had collaborated with Benito Mussolini during the war and for a brief period afterwards. However, he never joined the Fasci di Combattimento and soon took a clearly anti-fascist stance, associating with Arditi del Popolo. With the rise of fascism, De Ambris took part in the clashes between the workers of Parma and Italo Balbo&#x27;s fascist squads in August 1922. On 20 December 1922 he was violently removed from the streetcar he was on in Genoa, beaten up and taken to the police station, accused of anti-fascist incitement. After this, he went into exile in France, together with his partner Maria, her daughter and her husband. Mussolini still tried to convince him to collaborate with fascism between 1923 and 1924, but De Ambris refused.

In his last exile, he lived in poverty and worked as a book seller. He soon became involved in the anti-fascist activities carried out by other Italian exiles, taking part in the &quot;Lega Italiana dei Diritti dell&#x27;Uomo&quot; (LIDU), together with Luigi Campolonghi, his long-time companion. The organization dealt with helping new arrivals obtain documents and jobs, as well as helping exiles threatened with expulsion and serving as a forum for discussion. De Ambris also founded the weekly &quot;Il Mezzogiorno&quot; in Toulouse and was a contributor to the newspaper &quot;Il Corriere degli Italiani&quot;, where he published various writings against fascism. In 1926, he wrote a brochure in which he commented on the case of the murder of the socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti, highlighting Mussolini&#x27;s responsibility for the murder with documents and arguing that &quot;it was shameful to tolerate Italy being governed dictatorially by a murderer and that the disgust aroused by this shame should find the will and the strength to eliminate it&quot;. In September of the same year, De Ambris lost his Italian citizenship because of his anti-fascist activities. Between 1927 and 1934, he maintained constant correspondence with his niece Irma. In many of his letters, he wrote under a false name, as he was constantly under surveillance by the fascist government and his correspondence was often intercepted.

On 9 December 1934 De Ambris invited a group of friends to his home to discuss a work plan for the LIDU, bringing together anarchists, socialists and Italian republicans in exile. A few hours after the meeting, he died. The Paris newspaper &quot;Le Peuple&quot; reported his death on 13 December 1934. On the tomb that the Parma workers built for De Ambris in the Brive-la-Gaillarde cemetery, Campolonghi wrote the following epigraph:
In 1964, his remains were taken from France to the Della Villetta cemetery in Italy, with celebrations being held in the city of Parma, attended by local authorities and syndicalist organizations.

<text>1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours is a compilation album comprising early recordings by American rock band Green Day, released October 1, 1991, on Lookout Records. Often erroneously referred to as the band&#x27;s debut album, the compilation combines the band&#x27;s actual debut &quot;39/Smooth&quot; (1990) and its first two EPs &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; (1989) and &quot;Slappy&quot; (1990) (all currently out of print), as suggested by the amalgamation of the titles of the debut album and two EPs for the resulting compilation album. The album includes one cover, &quot;Knowledge&quot; (originally from the &quot;Slappy&quot; EP), which was originally by influential California punk band Operation Ivy, whose singer, Jesse Michaels, contributed the artwork for the album. The cover art features the same image from &quot;39/Smooth&quot;.

Lookout re-released the album in 2004 with special limited packaging and all-new enhanced CD-ROM features, including live performances and pictures. The album was re-issued in the same packaging in 2007 through Reprise Records after Green Day pulled the album, along with the remainder of the band&#x27;s catalog previously released through Lookout, from the label in August 2005 due to unpaid royalties.

&quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot; has been certified Gold in the US by the RIAA; according to Nielsen SoundScan, it has sold 632,000 copies in the US as of August 2010. The album was certified Gold in the UK on July 22, 2013, representing sales of at least 100,000 copies. It has sold more than 2 million copies worldwide.

==Release==
Initially released in 1991 through Lookout! Records (despite the 1990 copyright date on the album), the label re-issued the album in a remastered form in 2004. It was re-released on CD on January 9, 2007, by Reprise Records, the label Green Day has been signed to since leaving Lookout!. In Europe, the album was already re-released by Epitaph Europe, and has remained in print. It was reissued on vinyl on March 24, 2009, by Reprise in a package containing the original 10-song &quot;39/Smooth&quot; LP along with reissues of the &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; and &quot;Slappy&quot; EPs. On the 2009 reissues, the song &quot;I Want to Be Alone&quot; is omitted.

===Composition===
Musically, the record has been labeled as punk rock, pop-punk, and skate punk; “Disappearing Boy” for example featured as the backing track for the “Contests, Demos, Skate Parks” segment in Plan B’s &quot;Questionable&quot; (1992).

==Reception==

Reviews of &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot; were largely mixed; for example, &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars. Brad of Punknews.org gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing, &quot;All in all, this album succeeds at being quite good. It shows obvious influences from the Clash and the Ramones, and is a good debut for a young band that would later change the course of Punk Rock forever by opening the floodgates for New School bands.&quot;

<doc id="639057" wikidata="Q8027658" url="?curid=639057" title="Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein">
<text>The Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) is a 502-amino acid protein expressed in cells of the hematopoietic system that in humans is encoded by the &quot;WAS&quot; gene. In the inactive state, WASp exists in an autoinhibited conformation with sequences near its C-terminus binding to a region near its N-terminus. Its activation is dependent upon CDC42 and PIP2 acting to disrupt this interaction, causing the WASp protein to &#x27;open&#x27;. This exposes a domain near the WASp C-terminus that binds to and activates the Arp2/3 complex. Activated Arp2/3 nucleates new F-actin.

WASp is the founding member of a gene family which also includes the broadly expressed N-WASP (neuronal Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein), SCAR/WAVE1, WASH, WHAMM, and JMY. WAML (WASP and MIM like), WAWH (WASP without WH1 domain), and WHIMP (WAVE Homology in Membrane Protrusions) have more recently been discovered.

== Structure and function ==

The Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS) family of proteins share similar domain structure, and are involved in transduction of signals from receptors on the cell surface to the actin cytoskeleton. The presence of a number of different motifs suggests they are regulated by a number of different stimuli, and interact with multiple proteins. These proteins, directly or indirectly, associate with the small GTPase CDC42, known to regulate formation of actin filaments, and the cytoskeletal organising complex, Arp2/3.

The WASp family proteins includes WASp, N-WASp, SCAR/WAVE, WHAMM and WASH. The five of them share a C- terminal VCA (verprolin, central, acidic) domain where they interact with actin nucleating complex (ARP2/3) and they differ in their terminal domains. WASp and N-WASP are analogs, they contain an N-terminal EVH1 domain, a C-terminal VCA domain and central B and GBD (GTP binding domain) domains. WASp, is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells and neuronal WASp (N-WASp), is ubiquitously expressed. N-WASp contains an output region and a control region that are essential for its regulation. The output region is called the VVCA domain. It is located towards the C-terminal end of the protein and contains four motifs: two verprolin homology motifs (VV) binds actin monomers and delivers them to Arp2/3; the central domain (C) was once thought to bind cofilin but is now believed to enhance the interactions between the V domains and actin monomers, as well as the interaction between the A domain and Arp2/3; and the acidic motif (A) binds Arp2/3. In isolation, the VCA region is constitutively active. However, in full-length N-WASp the control region suppresses VCA domain activity. The control region is located at N-terminal end of N-WASp. The control region contains a CDC42-binding domain (GBP) and a PIP2-binding domain (B), both of which are critical for proper regulation of N-WASp. Cooperative binding of CDC42 and PIP2 relieve the autoinhibition of N-WASp, causing Arp2/3 to carry out actin polymerization. WASp interacting protein (WIP) interacts with WASp N-terminal domain (WH1) preventing it from degradation and stabilising its auto-inhibitory conformation.

In the absence of CDC42 and PIP2, N-WASp is in an inactive, locked conformation. Cooperative binding of both CDC42 and PIP2 relieve the autoinhibition. The cooperative binding of CDC42 and PIP2 is thermodynamically favored; binding of one enhances binding of the other. CDC42 and PIP2 localize the N-WASp-Arp2/3 complex to the plasma membrane. This localization ensures the actin polymers will be able to push through the plasma membrane and form filopodium required for cell motility.

WASp is required for various functions in myeloid and lymphoid immune cells. Many of these, such as phagocytosis and podosome formation, related to its role in regulating the polymerization of actin filaments. Other functions of WASP depend on its activity as a scaffold protein for assembly of effective signalling complexes downstream of antigen receptor or integrin engagement. Particularly in NK cells it participates in the synapse formation and polarization of perforin to the immune synapse for NK cell cytotoxicity. When WASp is absent or mutated T cells and B cells formation of immune synapse and TCR/BCR downstream signaling is also affected.

== Clinical significance ==
Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome is a rare, inherited, X-linked, recessive disease characterized by immune dysregulation and microthrombocytopenia, and is caused by mutations in the &quot;WASp&quot; gene. The &quot;WASp&quot; gene product is a cytoplasmic protein, expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells, which show signalling and cytoskeletal abnormalities in WAS patients. A transcript variant arising as a result of alternative promoter usage, and containing a different 5&#x27; UTR sequence, has been described, but its full-length nature is not known.

WASp is a product of the &quot;WASp&quot;, and mutations in the &quot;WASp&quot; can lead to Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (an X-linked disease that mainly affects males with symptoms that include thrombocytopenia, eczema, recurrent infections, and small-sized platelets) in these patients the protein is usually significantly reduced or absent. Other, less inactivating mutations affecting the &quot;WASp&quot; cause X-linked thrombocytopenia, or XLT, where there is usually detectable protein levels by flow cytometry. The majority of the mutations causing classic WAS are located in the WH1 domain of the protein and these mutations affect binding with the WASp Interacting Protein. Mutations located in the GBD domain disrupt autoinhibition and lead to an unfolded protein that is constitutively active. Unlike WAS and XLT, WASp in this case is present and active. Activated WASp leads to nuclear localization of actin filaments and this can lead to premature apoptosis, aneuploidy and failure to undergo cytokinesis. This, in turn, causes myelodysplasia and X-linked neutropenia.

A prospective gene therapy for Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome, OTL-103, uses autologous CD34+ lymphocytes that are transfected with a lentiviral vector to produce functional WASp. , OTL-103 was undergoing Phase I/II clinical trials at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy.

<doc id="639061" wikidata="Q3837393" url="?curid=639061" title="Los Angeles Temptation">
<text>The Los Angeles Temptation were a women&#x27;s American football team in the Legends Football League (LFL) based in Los Angeles and Ontario, California. The team was established as Team Dream, one of two teams that participated in the inaugural Lingerie Bowl broadcast during Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004. The team won the first two Lingerie Bowls, and went on to win three more, their final one in 2012. The league, originally known as the Lingerie Football League, rebranded in 2013 and shifted away from Super Bowl halftime shows.

Following the 2019 season, the LFL ceased operations and relaunched as the Extreme Football League (X League), which first played in 2022. All former LFL teams received new brands and the Temptation were replaced by the Los Angeles Black Storm.

==History==

In 2004, the first Lingerie Bowl was played during halftime of Super Bowl XXXVIII between two teams of models and actresses wearing lingerie and minimal protective football gear. Team Dream was captained by Nikki Ziering and shutout the Angie Everhart-captained Team Euphoria with a single touchdown, winning the inaugural event 6–0. In the following year, the team was renamed Los Angeles Temptation and the Super Bowl halftime event was expanded by two more teams, the Dallas Desire and Chicago Bliss. After defeating the Dallas Desire in the Western Final (a semi-final competition that included a skill test, a 3-on-2 match, and a dance competition) with a score of 68–36, they met again with the re-named New York Euphoria at the final of Lingerie Bowl II and won again. In 2006, they defeated the Dallas Desire again in the semifinal, but lost 13–12 to the New York Euphoria in Lingerie Bowl III. The Lingerie Bowl was then cancelled for various reasons from 2007 through 2009.

In 2009, the event organizers launched the concept as a full league called the Lingerie Football League (LFL), culminating in the Lingerie Bowl as the championship game between the conference champions, still during the Super Bowl halftime. The Temptation were one of the ten teams to participate in the inaugural 2009–10 LFL season, with one game indoors at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and one outdoors at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Temptation won the Western Conference and then defeated the Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bliss by the score of 27–14 in Lingerie Bowl VII. They played both their 2010–11 LFL season home games at the Coliseum before moving to Ontario, California, and indoors at Citizens Business Bank Arena in 2011. The Temptation won the all three Lingerie Bowls after the launch of the LFL.

Following the 2011–12 LFL season, the league rebranded as the Legends Football League and shifted away from the Super Bowl halftime event, changing its championship game to the Legends Cup. The league also shifted the season to a spring and summer schedule that launched in 2013. In 2013 and 2014, the Temptation continued to play at Citizens Business Bank Arena. In 2015, the league placed the Las Vegas Sin at the arena after the Sin lost their home venue and the Temptation moved back to the outdoor Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, but returned to Ontario in 2016. The Temptation never made it to the Legends Cup until 2019, the last LFL season played.

On December 13, 2019, the LFL announced that it would not be producing a 2020 season and would re-evaluate markets in the future. Four days later, the Extreme Football League (X League) was announced to begin play in April 2020 with all previous LFL references redirecting to the new entity. The league size remained at eight teams, initially all in the same markets as the former LFL teams, but under new team branding and the Temptation were replaced by the Los Angeles Black Storm.

<doc id="639064" wikidata="Q1192264" url="?curid=639064" title="Joy to the World">
<text>&quot;Joy to the World&quot; is an English hymn and Christmas carol. It was written in 1719 by the English minister and hymnist Isaac Watts. It is usually sung to the American composer Lowell Mason&#x27;s 1848 arrangement of a tune attributed to George Frideric Handel. The hymn&#x27;s lyrics are a Christian interpretation of Psalm 98 and Genesis 3. 

Since the 20th century, &quot;Joy to the World&quot; has been the most-published Christmas carol in North America, even though it was not originally associated with Christmas. , it was published in 1,387 hymnals in North America, according to the &quot;Dictionary of North American Hymnology&quot;.

==History==

===Origin===

&quot;Joy to the World&quot; was written by English minister and hymnist Isaac Watts, based on a Christian interpretation of Psalm 98 and Genesis 3. The song was first published in 1719 in Watts&#x27;s collection &quot;The Psalms of David: Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, and applied to the Christian State and Worship&quot;. The paraphrase is Watts&#x27;s Christological interpretation. Consequently, he does not emphasize with equal weight the various themes of Psalm 98. In first and second stanzas, Watts writes of heaven and earth rejoicing at the coming of the King. Watts did not write this hymn as a Christmas carol, as the lyrics do not reflect the Virgin birth of Jesus, but rather Christ&#x27;s Second Coming. Stanza three, an interlude that alludes to Genesis 3:17–19 rather than to the psalm text, speaks of Christ&#x27;s blessings extending victoriously over the realm of sin. The cheerful repetition of the phrase &quot;far as the curse is found&quot; has caused this stanza to be omitted from some hymnals. But the line makes joyful sense when understood from the New Testament eyes through which Watts interprets the psalm. Stanza four celebrates Christ&#x27;s rule over the nations.&quot; The nations are called to celebrate because God&#x27;s faithfulness to the house of Israel has brought salvation to the world.

===Music===

Watts&#x27;s 1719 preface says the verses &quot;are fitted to the Tunes of the Old Psalm-Book&quot; and includes the instruction, &quot;&quot;To the&quot; Common Tunes &quot;sing all entitled&quot; Common Metre.&quot; It is not clear whether &quot;Old Psalm-Book&quot; means Playford&#x27;s 1677 publication or some other. Sternhold and Hopkins&#x27;s &quot;old version&quot; and Tate and Brady&#x27;s &quot;new version&quot;, among others, circulated at that time as well. In the late 18th century, &quot;Joy to the World&quot; was printed with music several times, but the tunes were unrelated to the one commonly used today.

The tune usually used today is from an 1848 edition by Lowell Mason for &quot;The National Psalmist&quot; (Boston, 1848). Mason was by that time an accomplished and well-known composer and arranger, having composed tunes such as &quot;Bethany&quot; and &quot;Hamburg&quot;, which were used for the hymns &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot; and &quot;When I Survey the Wondrous Cross&quot;. Mason&#x27;s 1848 publication of the current tune was the fourth version to have been published. The first, published in his 1836 book &quot;Occasional Psalm and Hymn Tunes&quot;, featured the present day tune (in a different arrangement) with the present-day lyrics, the first such publication to do so. The name of this tune was given as &quot;Antioch&quot;, and was attributed as being &quot;From Handel&quot;. A very similar arrangement of the tune to today&#x27;s arrangement, and also with the present-day lyrics, was published in Mason&#x27;s 1839 book &quot;The Modern Psalmist&quot;. It was also titled &quot;Antioch&quot; and attributed to Handel.

Musically, the first four notes of &quot;Joy to the World&quot; are the same as the first four in the chorus &quot;Lift up your heads&quot; from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; (premiered 1742), and, in the third line, the same as found in another &quot;Messiah&quot; piece: the arioso, &quot;Comfort ye&quot;. Consequently, and with Mason&#x27;s attribution to Handel, there has long been speculation over how much a part Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; had in &quot;Joy to the World&quot;. The limited resemblances between &quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, have been dismissed as &#x27;chance resemblance&#x27; by Handel scholars today. However, the possibility of a common source antedating Antioch, Händel, and Mason alike may suggest that resemblances are more than coincidental. Händel was a native German and a Lutheran before he moved to England and most likely was familiar with his denomination&#x27;s hymnic repertoire. In addition, it is known Mason was a great admirer and scholar of Handel&#x27;s music, and had in fact become president of the Boston Handel and Haydn Society in 1827 and was also an editor for them. The possibility of a common source is described in the next paragraph.

Several tunes have been found from the early 1830s closely resembling that of &quot;Antioch&quot;, the earliest of which was published in 1832 under the title &quot;Comfort&quot; (possibly as a nod to Handel&#x27;s &quot;Comfort ye&quot;). This would make it at least four years older than Mason&#x27;s first publication of &quot;Antioch&quot;. Other publications from the early 1830s further suggest the tune may have been around for some time before Mason published his arrangement. Thomas Hawkes published the &quot;Comfort&quot; tune in 1833 in his &quot;Collection of Tunes&quot;. In it, the attribution was given simply as &quot;Author Unknown&quot;, suggesting it may have been older. A 1986 article by John Wilson also showed &quot;Antioch&quot;&#x27;s close resemblance to an 1833 publication of &quot;Comfort&quot; and its associated Wesley hymn &quot;O Joyful Sound&quot;. In any case, there is no evidence to suggest that the tune is older than Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Vom Himmel hoch da komm ich her&quot;, a Christmas chorale of which Antioch appears to be an expanded paraphrase. This resemblance suggests Vom Himmel hoch as a common source and also may explain the widespread use of &quot;Joy to the World&quot; as a Christmas hymn.

A version by the Trinity Choir was very popular in 1911. , &quot;Joy to the World&quot; was the most-published Christmas hymn in North America.

<doc id="639072" wikidata="Q942297" url="?curid=639072" title="Prop">
<text>A prop, formally known as a (theatrical) property, is an object actors use on stage or screen during a performance or screen production. In practical terms, a prop is considered to be anything movable or portable on a stage or a set, distinct from the actors, scenery, costumes, and electrical equipment. This includes handheld items such as books, cups, weapons, and tools that actors interact with during a performance. Props help to create a realistic setting, convey information, or add to the storytelling by showing details about the characters or the environment.

==Term==

The earliest known use of the term &quot;properties&quot; in English to refer to stage accessories is in the 1425 CE morality play, &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot;.

During the Renaissance in Europe, small acting troupes functioned as cooperatives, pooling resources and dividing any income. Many performers provided their own costumes and small objects needed for performance, hence the term &quot;property&quot; suggesting these items belonged to the people on stage. Conversely, items such as stage weapons or furniture may have been acquired specially and considered &quot;company property&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; finds the first usage of &quot;props&quot; in its shortened form in 1841, while the singular form &quot;prop&quot; appeared in 1911.

&quot;Property&quot; and &quot;prop&quot; apply not only to props used in theatre, but also to props used in film and television. Properties director Bland Wade said &quot;A coffee cup onstage is a coffee cup on television, is a coffee cup on the big screen,&quot; adding &quot;There are definitely different responsibilities and different vocabulary.&quot;

==Backstage and on stage==
During a performance props are set up in order, off stage on a table in an easily accessed area or pre-set on-stage before the performance begins by the assistant stage manager (ASM).
The person in charge of preparing, maintaining and acquiring props is generally called the property master.

==Types==
Most props are ordinary objects. Some may require modification, such as rewiring of lamps to be compatible with dimmers or painting to make an object look used or be more visible from front of house under bright or dim lighting.

Props may also be manufactured specially for the production. This may be for reasons of weight, durability and safety or the item may be unique in appearance and/or function.

=== Weapons ===
A prop weapon, such as a gun or sword, can be a replica, a real weapon or a real weapon which has been modified to be non-functional.

To make melee weapons non-functional, swords often have their edges and points dulled. Knives are often made of plastic or rubber or have retractable blades.

Rubber bladed swords and guns may be used by stuntmen or actors where the action does not require detailed or functional weapons, in order to minimise risk.

====Firearms====
It is common for functioning firearms to be used in film and television productions usually firing blanks.

Due to the increased level of risk it is standard practice for the safe and proper handling and use of firearms as props to be overseen by a specifically trained and licensed professional, usually called the weapons master or armourer.

Although blank cartridges do not fire projectiles, they still have an explosive charge and can cause fatal injury.

Dummy bullets are used if the prop is in closeup and chambered rounds in the cylinder of a revolver are visible to camera. The can also be used in shots of the actor loading a weapon or merely handling ammunition. Dummy bullets contain no primer or charge and are only &quot;bullet shaped objects&quot;

Although rare, fatal firearm related incidents have occurred, notably Jon-Erik Hexum on October 18, 1984, Brandon Lee on March 31, 1993, and Halyna Hutchins on October 21, 2021.

=== Breakaway ===

Breakaway props are designed to be destroyed or break in use, such as furniture made from balsa-wood or cardboard and windows, bottles and glassware made from sugar glass or resin. Cups, plates or vases may be made from bisque or wax.

Although these are relatively safe, a stunt double may replace the main actor for scenes involving their use.

=== Hero ===
Hero props are the more detailed pieces intended for close inspection by the camera or audience. The hero prop may have legible writing, lights, moving parts, or other attributes or functions missing from a standard prop. The name refers to their typical use by main characters in a production.

A hero prop phaser from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, for example, might include a depressible trigger and a light-up muzzle and display panel (all of which would make the hero prop more expensive and less durable).

=== Money ===
Although real money can be used, when large quantities are required or the money is to be destroyed, it is usually more practical for facsimiles to be used, which are made to not only look realistic but also comply with counterfeiting laws.

== Collecting ==
In recent years, the increasing popularity of movie memorabilia has elevated many props to the status of prized collectors items. &quot;Screen-used&quot; props can fetch vast sums at auctions and charity benefits.

There is also a growing industry in the making of replicas of well known hero props for home display, cosplay or LARP use.

<text>RealPlayer, formerly RealAudio Player, RealOne Player and RealPlayer G2, is a cross-platform media player app, developed by RealNetworks. The media player is compatible with numerous container file formats of the multimedia realm, including MP3, MP4, QuickTime File Format, Windows Media format, and the proprietary RealAudio and RealVideo formats. RealPlayer is also available for other operating systems; Linux, Unix, Palm OS, Windows Mobile, and Symbian versions have been released. 

The program is powered by an underlying open-source media engine called Helix. 

==History==
The first version of RealPlayer was introduced on April 3, 1995 as &quot;RealAudio Player&quot; and was one of the first media players capable of streaming media over the Internet. Then, version 4.01 of RealPlayer was included as a selectable Internet tool in Windows 98&#x27;s installation package. Subsequent versions of the software were titled &quot;RealPlayer G2&quot; (version 6) and &quot;RealOne Player&quot; (version 9), while free &quot;Basic&quot; versions as well as paid &quot;Plus&quot; versions, the latter with additional features, have also been offered. For the Windows OS, the RealPlayer version 9 the features of the separate program, RealJukebox.

In July 2008, the RealPlayer Music Store was replaced with the Rhapsody MP3 Store. 

RealPlayer 11 was released for Microsoft Windows in November 2007 and for Mac OS X in May 2008. RealPlayer 15 was released on November 18, 2011. This version allowed users to transfer video, music, and photos between their computers and mobile devices, share links of videos and photos on sites such as Facebook and MySpace, and download videos from popular sites such as YouTube and Metacafe. 

RealPlayer was initially accessed by many users as a plugin to watch streaming video or listen to streaming audio (for example, most of the BBC&#x27;s websites formerly employed the plugin); but in the early 21st century, Adobe Flash and subsequently HTML video became preferred options for this purpose.

==Current status==
In February 2016, RealNetworks released RealPlayer 18, which incorporated the features of the previous year&#x27;s release of RealTimes, an app that makes multimedia montages from users&#x27; photographs and videos, backed up and accessible via cloud storage. The Real.com Blog states that &quot;RealPlayer with RealTimes (aka &quot;RealPlayer&quot; for short) will still include the legacy features, such as Downloader, Converter, and Web Videos. It will also still include our RealTimes features, such as Photos and RealTimes Stories, our automatic video collage feature.&quot; Note that as of 2018, the publisher only provides RealTime for use on a Mac and no longer publishes a media player called RealPlayer for macOS. 

As of January 2022, the www.real.com home page offers RealPlayer for Windows, Android, and iOS. 

==Features==
Features of RealPlayer include a video download utility, a web browser, visualizations (graphical animations or &quot;light shows&quot; that appear on the screen when playing music), equalizer and video controls (including Crossfade and Gapless playback in RealPlayer Plus), recording audio, CD ripping, and a media converter which allows converting files to a variety of common audio and video formats.

==Supported platforms for RealPlayer== 

===Windows===
RealPlayer SP includes audio CD burning capabilities, DVR-style playback buffering, multimedia search, Internet radio, a jukebox-style file library, an embedded web browser (using Microsoft Internet Explorer), and the ability to convert and transfer media to a wide range of devices. This includes music players such as iPod and Zune, smartphones such as iPhone and BlackBerry, portable gaming devices such as Sony PSP, and console gaming systems such as Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. Since version 11, RealPlayer SP has gained Flash Video support, DVD, SVCD, VCD burning (120-minute), and video recording (DRM is supported). 

As of 2008, RealPlayer Enterprise is a licensed product for enterprise applications which can be customized and remotely administered by RealPlayer Enterprise Manager. The free &quot;Realplayer Enterprise Education Edition&quot; has been removed. Both versions of Realplayer Enterprise are lightweight, ad-free versions of RealPlayer, missing most consumer features and most plug-in support. The RealSched.exe update reminder can be disabled in two steps, and it is not reinstalled upon running the player. 

===macOS===

While RealPlayer for macOS had been distributed (for free) in the past, no macOS version of RealPlayer is available for download from the Real site. 

The last stable release included Real&#x27;s Helix playback engine for RealAudio and RealVideo, a 10-band equalizer and video adjustment controls, and a full-screen, resizable &quot;theater mode&quot; for video playback, as well as many features found in its Windows counterpart. 

Since the release of version 10 on January 7, 2004, RealPlayer had become much more closely integrated with macOS including features such as:
* QuickTime playback support (including full-screen viewing which Apple only introduced to its own basic QuickTime Player in 2007)
* An integrated Web browser based on Apple&#x27;s WebKit framework, resulting in RealPlayer and Safari sharing cookies.
* Support for Bonjour to share Internet favorites.
* Cocoa user interface. 

All available versions of RealPlayer for macOS are 32-bit, thus the program can only run up to macOS Mojave due to 32-bit app support being dropped in Catalina. 

===Linux/Unix===
RealPlayer for Linux/Unix was developed separately from the Windows and Mac versions. The client is based on the open-source Helix Player which can be found at the Helix Community Website . It supports Windows Media 7/8, RealAudio/Video, MP3 and Ogg Vorbis. The interface depends on the current GTK+ theme. 

===Android===
The Android version of RealPlayer is currently available as a free download from the Google Play Store. It supports Real Audio, Real Video, MP3, 3GP, AMR, and other media formats. 

===Symbian===
The Symbian version of RealPlayer allows mobile phones to play Real Audio, Real Video, MP3, 3GP, AMR, and other media formats. It is provided as freeware. In newer Symbian devices it can also be used to stream both audio and video content in the form of MP3 (music) and 3GP (videos). 

===Palm===
RealPlayer 1.6.1 (US) or RealPlayer 1.6.0 (worldwide) is available for free for PalmOne-made Palm OS 5 devices, such as the Palm Tungsten or Zire series. It is also compatible with RealPlayer Music Store tracks. However, they will neither install nor run on non-PalmOne-made devices like Sony&#x27;s Clie line of PDAs. Realplayer for Palm OS does not support later Palm smartphones such as the treo 700p, 755p, or Centro, although the treo 600 and 650 are listed as supported devices. 

==Related products==
RealJukebox was a media player that allowed users to play and manage their digital music on hard drives, CDs and online. It was first released in May 1999. By late 2001, the functions of RealJukebox, RealPlayer and GoldPass (a subscription webcast service) had been integrated into Real&#x27;s newly released all-in-one media player, RealOne Player. 

==Reception==
Past versions of RealPlayer have been criticized for containing adware and spyware such as Comet Cursor. In 1999 security researcher Richard M. Smith dissected some of RealJukebox&#x27;s network traffic and discovered that it was sending a unique identifier with information about the music titles to which its users were listening. RealNetworks issued a patch, and the spyware was removed in version 1.02. Their download page stated RealJukebox included privacy enhancements and supplied the link to their updated privacy policy. 

&quot;PC World&quot; magazine named RealPlayer (1999 Version) as number 2 in its 2006 list &quot;The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time&quot;, writing that RealPlayer &quot;had a disturbing way of making itself a little too much at home on your PC installing itself as the default media player, taking liberties with your Windows Registry, popping up annoying &#x27;messages&#x27; that were really just advertisements, and so on.&quot; In 2007, it placed RealPlayer, versions 1996–2004, at number 5 in its list &quot;The 20 Most Annoying Tech Products&quot;. 

US-CERT has issued multiple security advisories reporting defects which allowed remote sites to use RealPlayer to execute attack code. 

==Real Alternative==
Real Alternative is a codec which allows RealMedia files to be played without the installation of the RealPlayer software. In 2010, RealNetworks sued Hilbrand Edskes, a 26-year-old Dutch webmaster, for providing a hyperlink to the Real Alternative codec on his website, alleging that Real Alternative is a reverse engineered codec and therefore illegal. In November 2011, RealNetworks&#x27; case against Edskes was dismissed and RealNetworks was ordered to pay him €48,000 in damages. The case, however, cost Edskes €66,000 in legal fees. The case was reopened in 2013, when RealNetworks claimed to possess further proof showing that Edskes was involved in uploading Real Alternative.

<text>Newsday is a daily newspaper in the United States primarily serving Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island, although it is also sold throughout the New York metropolitan area. The slogan of the newspaper is &quot;Newsday, Your Eye on LI&quot;, and formerly it was &quot;Newsday, the Long Island Newspaper&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s headquarters are located in Melville, New York.

Since its founding in 1940, &quot;Newsday&quot; has won 19 Pulitzer Prizes. Historically, it penetrated the New York City market. As of 2023, &quot;Newsday&quot; is the eighth-largest circulation newspaper in the United States with a print circulation of 86,850.

==History==
===20th century===
Founded by Alicia Patterson and her husband, Harry Guggenheim, the first edition of &quot;Newsday&quot; was September 3, 1940, published from Hempstead.

Until undergoing a major redesign in the 1970s, &quot;Newsday&quot; copied the &quot;Daily News&quot; format of short stories and numerous pictures. Patterson was fired as a writer at her father&#x27;s &quot;Daily News&quot; in her early 20s, after getting the basic facts of a divorce wrong in a published report. She later went on the publish and edit &quot;Newsday&quot;. Following Patterson&#x27;s death in 1963, Guggenheim became publisher and editor.

In 1967, Guggenheim turned over the publisher position to Bill Moyers and continued as president and editor-in-chief. But Guggenheim was disappointed by the liberal drift of the newspaper under Moyers, criticizing what he called the &quot;left-wing&quot; coverage of the anti-Vietnam War protests.

The two ultimately split over the 1968 presidential election, with Guggenheim authoring an editorial supporting Richard Nixon when Moyers supported Hubert Humphrey.

In 1970, Guggenheim sold his majority share to the then-conservative Times-Mirror Company over the attempt of newspaper employees to block the sale, even though Moyers offered $10 million more than the Times-Mirror purchase price; Moyers resigned a few days later. Guggenheim, who died a year later, had Moyers removed from his will.

After the competing &quot;Long Island Press&quot; (not to be confused with the alternative weekly of the same name) ceased publication in 1977, &quot;Newsday&quot; launched a separate Queens edition, followed by a New York City edition dubbed &quot;New York Newsday&quot;. In June 2000, Times Mirror merged with the Tribune Company, partnering &quot;Newsday&quot; with the New York City television station WPIX, also owned by Tribune.

With the Times Mirror-Tribune merger, the newspaper founded by Alicia Patterson was now owned by the company that was founded by her great-grandfather, Joseph Medill, who owned the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and, until 1991, also owned her father&#x27;s &quot;Daily News&quot;. Tribune sold the &quot;Daily News&quot; to British newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell.

Following Maxwell&#x27;s death in 1992, the family publishing empire collapsed, and Mortimer Zuckerman purchased the &quot;Daily News&quot;.

===21st century===
In April 2008, News Corporation, headed by CEO Rupert Murdoch, attempted to purchase &quot;Newsday&quot; for US$580 million. This was followed by a matching bid from Zuckerman and a $680 million bid from Cablevision.

In May 2008, News Corporation withdrew its bid, and on May 12, 2008, &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that Cablevision would purchase the paper for $650 million. The sale was completed July 29, 2008.

In 2016, Altice, a Netherlands-based multinational telecommunications company, acquired Cablevision, including &quot;Newsday&quot; and News 12. However, Altice then sold a majority (75%) stake in &quot;Newsday&quot; back to Cablevision&#x27;s former owner Charles Dolan and his son Patrick, making Patrick the CEO of &quot;Newsday&quot;. Altice disposed of its remaining stake in &quot;Newsday&quot; at the end of July 2018, which, combined with Charles Dolan&#x27;s transfer of shares to son Patrick, made Patrick the sole owner of &quot;Newsday&quot;.

In July 2020, &quot;Newsday&quot; received $10 million in federal government loans from Paycheck Protection Program during the COVID-19 pandemic to pay salaries for 500 employees.

In 2022, Don Hudson was named editor.

In March 2023, &quot;Newsday&quot; launched NewsdayTV, featuring former News 12 Networks anchor Elisa DiStefano. NewsdayTV is available online and through major streaming outlets. NewsdayTV takes a similar approach to news as other Long Island news outlets such as News12.

==Editorial style==
Despite having a tabloid format, &quot;Newsday&quot; is not known for being sensationalistic, as are other local daily tabloids, such as the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; and the &quot;New York Post&quot;. This causes Newsday to sometimes be referred to as &quot;the respectable tabloid&quot;.

In 2004, the alternative weekly newspaper &quot;Long Island Press&quot; (which is not related to the defunct daily of the same name) wrote that &quot;Newsday&quot; has used its clout to influence local politics in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.

Bill Moyers briefly served as publisher. During the tenure of publisher Robert M. Johnson in the 1980s, Newsday made a major push into New York City. The paper&#x27;s roster of columnists and critics has included Cathy Young, Jimmy Breslin, Barbara Garson, Normand Poirier, Murray Kempton, Gail Collins, Pete Hamill, Sydney Schanberg, Robert Reno (died 2012), Jim Dwyer, sportswriter Mike Lupica, music critic Tim Page, and television critic Marvin Kitman. The paper featured both advice columnists Ann Landers and Dear Abby for several years.

From 1985 to 2005, Michael Mandelbaum wrote a regular foreign affairs analysis column for &quot;Newsday&quot;. Writer and biographer Robert Caro was an investigative reporter. Its features section has included television reporters Verne Gay and Diane Werts, TV/film feature writer Frank Lovece, and film critic Rafer Guzman. &quot;Newsday&quot; carries the syndicated columnist Froma Harrop. Pulitzer Prize winner Walt Handelsman&#x27;s editorial political cartoons animation are a nationally syndicated feature of &quot;Newsday&quot;. In the 1980s, a new design director, Robert Eisner, guided the transition into digital design and color printing. 

&quot;Newsday&quot; created and sponsored a &quot;Long Island at the Crossroads&quot; advisory board in 1978, to recommend regional goals, supervise local government, and liaison with state and Federal officials. It lasted approximately a decade.

On March 21, 2011, &quot;Newsday&quot; redesigned its front page, scrapping the nameplate and font used since the 1960s in favor of a sans-serif wordmark.

==Circulation==
In 2004, a circulation scandal revealed that the paper&#x27;s daily and Sunday circulation had been inflated by 16.9% and 14.5%, respectively, in the auditing period September 30, 2002 to September 30, 2003. The Audit Bureau of Circulation adjusted average weekday circulation to 481,816 from 579,599; average Saturday circulation to 392,649 from 416,830; and average Sunday circulation to 574,081 from 671,820, and instituted twice-yearly audits.

In 2008, &quot;Newsday&quot; was ranked 10th in terms of newspaper circulation in the United States.
On October 28, 2009, &quot;Newsday&quot; changed its web site to a paid-subscriber only model. Newsday.com would open its front page, classified ads, movie listings, and school closings to all site visitors, but access beyond this content would require a weekly fee – US$5 as of 2010. This fee would be waived for subscribers of the print edition of the paper, as well as for subscribers to parent-company Cablevision&#x27;s Internet service. Through its first three months only 35 non-Optimum, non-&quot;Newsday&quot; subscribers signed up for the paid website.

==In popular culture==
* 1969: The novel &quot;Naked Came the Stranger&quot; is written as a literary hoax poking fun at contemporary American culture. Although credited to &quot;Penelope Ashe&quot;, it was in fact written by a group of 24 journalists led by &quot;Newsday&quot; columnist Mike McGrady, who intended to author a deliberately terrible book with a lot of sex to illustrate the point that popular American literary culture had become mindlessly vulgar. The book fulfilled the authors&#x27; expectations and became a bestseller in 1969; they revealed the hoax later that year, further spurring the book&#x27;s popularity.
* 1985: In the comedy/thriller &quot;Compromising Positions&quot;, the lead character, played by Susan Sarandon, is a former &quot;Newsday&quot; journalist who is trying reestablish her career by selling a freelance story to the publication.
* 1986: In the &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; films, Linda Kozlowski&#x27;s character, reporter Sue Charlton, works at &quot;Newsday&quot;.
* 1996: The episode &quot;The Homer They Fall&quot; in season eight of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; quotes &quot;Newsday&quot; calling boxing &quot;the cruelest sport&quot;.
* 1996 to 2005: In the CBS sitcom &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, the fictional character Ray Barone played by Ray Romano is employed by &quot;Newsday&quot; as a sportswriter.
*2016: In the documentary &quot;Three Identical Strangers&quot;, former editor Howard Schneider discusses &quot;Newsday&quot;&#x27;s coverage of three young men who discovered they were separated as infants.

<doc id="639105" wikidata="Q302709" url="?curid=639105" title="Michael Onslow, 7th Earl of Onslow">
<text>Michael William Coplestone Dillon Onslow, 7th Earl of Onslow (28 February 1938 – 14 May 2011), styled Viscount Cranley from 1945 to 1971, was a British Conservative politician.

==Background and education==
Onslow was the only son of William Onslow, 6th Earl of Onslow, and his first wife, Pamela Dillon, daughter of Eric Dillon, 19th Viscount Dillon. He was educated at Eton and the Sorbonne.

==Political career==
Onslow succeeded his father in the earldom in 1971. He was far more colourful and unorthodox, publicly opposing apartheid and police racism, among other issues. He sat on the Conservative benches. He was a supporter of reform of the House of Lords, but not as proposed by Labour. When Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour government proposed the House of Lords Bill in 1999 to strip voting rights from the mostly Conservative hereditary peers in the House of Lords, Onslow said that he was happy to force a division on every clause of the Scotland Bill; each division takes 20 minutes and there were more than 270 clauses. This was a move to ruin the government&#x27;s legislative programme in protest at the removal. Onslow added he would &quot;behave like a football hooligan&quot; on this legislative programme, which he opposed. Ironically, he was one of the more than 90 hereditary peers elected to remain in the House of Lords after the House of Lords Act 1999. He criticised the decision by the Blair government to abolish the Lord Chancellor, stating Blair was: &quot;playing Pooh sticks with 800 years of history.&quot; He supported a majority-elected upper house. He opposed the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011.

He was a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights from July 2005 until his death, in which capacity he strongly criticised Jacqui Smith over the government&#x27;s proposed extension to the detention of terror suspects to 42 days. He disapproved of modernising tendencies within the Church of England, stating on one occasion that &quot;...one hundred years ago, the Church was in favour of fox hunting and against buggery. Now it is in favour of buggery and against fox hunting.&quot; On two occasions he appeared on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in November 1999 and October 2003 respectively. He is the only hereditary peer to have ever appeared on that programme to date.

==Death==
Onslow died on 14 May 2011, aged 73, from cancer which consigned him to a wheelchair.

==Family==
In 1964, Onslow married Robin Lindsay Bullard, daughter of Robert Lee Bullard III, of Atlanta, Georgia, and Ann Lindsay Bullard (&quot;née&quot; Aymer), who in 1949 married Charles McLaren, 3rd Baron Aberconway.

Onslow and his wife had three children:
* Rupert Charles William Bullard Onslow, 8th Earl of Onslow (b. 16 June 1967)
* Lady Arabella Ann Teresa Onslow (b. 1970, m. 24 June 2016), a general practitioner.
* Lady Charlotte Emma Dorothy Onslow (b. 1977)

In 2011 his daughter&#x27;s wedding was accelerated so that the dying Onslow would be able to attend.

<text>Claudette Bradshaw (April 8, 1949 – March 26, 2022) was a Canadian politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe, New Brunswick. She was first elected on June 2, 1997, and served until the 2006 election. She was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Claudette Bradshaw was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation and Minister Responsible for the Francophonie on June 10, 1997. On November 23, 1998, she was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Labour. After being re-elected in November 2000, she was re-appointed Minister of Labour on January 15, 2002, and again on December 12, 2003. From March 23, 1999, until July 20, 2004, she was the Federal Coordinator on Homelessness.

After the 2004 election, Prime Minister Paul Martin shuffled the cabinet, and demoted Bradshaw to the position of Minister of State (Human Resources Development). In November 2005, Bradshaw announced that she would not stand for re-election in the 2006 federal election.

Following her retirement from federal politics, there was some speculation that she would run for the provincial Liberals in the next New Brunswick election in the riding of Kent South. Bradshaw later announced she was not interested in re-entering electoral politics but was appointed special advisor to leader Shawn Graham for that election campaign.

In 2009, she was appointed a member of the Order of New Brunswick. In 2020, she was awarded the Human Rights Award of the Province of Brunswick.

Bradshaw died on March 26, 2022, at the age of 72 from cancer.

== Lifetime work ==
In 1974, Claudette Bradshaw founded the Moncton Headstart Early Family Intervention Center.

<doc id="639115" wikidata="Q180548" url="?curid=639115" title="Neolithic Revolution">
<text>The Neolithic Revolution, also known as the First Agricultural Revolution, was the wide-scale transition of many human cultures during the Neolithic period in Afro-Eurasia from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement, making an increasingly large population possible. These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants, learning how they grew and developed. This new knowledge led to the domestication of plants into crops.

Archaeological data indicate that the domestication of various types of plants and animals happened in separate locations worldwide, starting in the geological epoch of the Holocene 11,700 years ago, after the end of the last Ice Age. It was humankind&#x27;s first historically verifiable transition to agriculture. The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, resulting in a decrease in the quality of human nutrition compared with that obtained previously from foraging, but because food production became more efficient, it released humans to invest their efforts in other activities and was thus &quot;ultimately necessary to the rise of modern civilization by creating the foundation for the later process of industrialization and sustained economic growth&quot;.

The Neolithic Revolution involved much more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia, it transformed the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated human prehistory into sedentary (non-nomadic) societies based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their natural environment by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as irrigation and deforestation which allowed the production of surplus food. Other developments that are found very widely during this era are the domestication of animals, pottery, polished stone tools, and rectangular houses. In many regions, the adoption of agriculture by prehistoric societies caused episodes of rapid population growth, a phenomenon known as the Neolithic demographic transition.

These developments, sometimes called the Neolithic package, provided the basis for centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical ideologies, depersonalized systems of knowledge (e.g. writing), densely populated settlements, specialization and division of labour, more trade, the development of non-portable art and architecture, and greater property ownership. The earliest known civilization developed in Sumer in southern Mesopotamia (); its emergence also heralded the beginning of the Bronze Age.

The relationship of the aforementioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture, their sequence of emergence, and their empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate. It is usually understood to vary from place to place, rather than being the outcome of universal laws of social evolution.

==Background==
Prehistoric hunter-gatherers had different subsistence requirements and lifestyles from agriculturalists. Hunter-gatherers were often highly mobile and migratory, living in temporary shelters and in small tribal groups, and having limited contact with outsiders. Their diet was well-balanced though heavily dependent on what the environment could provide each season. In contrast, because the surplus and plannable supply of food provided by agriculture made it possible to support larger population groups, agriculturalists lived in more permanent dwellings in more densely populated settlements than what could be supported by a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. The agricultural communities&#x27; seasonal need to plan and coordinate resource and manpower encouraged division of labour, which gradually led to specialization of labourers and complex societies. The subsequent development of trading networks to exchange surplus commodities and services brought agriculturalists into contact with outside groups, which promoted cultural exchanges that led to the rise of civilizations and technological evolutions.

However, higher population and food abundance did not necessarily correlate with improved health. Reliance on a very limited variety of staple crops can adversely affect health even while making it possible to feed more people. Maize is deficient in certain essential amino acids (lysine and tryptophan) and is a poor source of iron. The phytic acid it contains may inhibit nutrient absorption. Other factors that likely affected the health of early agriculturalists and their domesticated livestock would have been increased numbers of parasites and disease-bearing pests associated with human waste and contaminated food and water supplies. Fertilizers and irrigation may have increased crop yields but also would have promoted proliferation of insects and bacteria in the local environment while grain storage attracted additional insects and rodents.

==Agricultural transition==
The term &#x27;neolithic revolution&#x27; was invented by V. Gordon Childe in his book &quot;Man Makes Himself&quot; (1936). Childe introduced it as the first in a series of agricultural revolutions in Middle Eastern history, calling it a &quot;revolution&quot; to denote its significance, the degree of change to communities adopting and refining agricultural practices.

The beginning of this process in different regions has been dated from 10,000 to 8,000 BCE in the Fertile Crescent, and perhaps 8000 BCE in the Kuk Early Agricultural Site of Papua New Guinea in Melanesia. Everywhere, this transition is associated with a change from a largely nomadic hunter-gatherer way of life to a more settled, agrarian one, with the domestication of various plant and animal species – depending on the species locally available, and influenced by local culture. Archaeological research in 2003 suggests that in some regions, such as the Southeast Asian peninsula, the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculturalist was not linear, but region-specific.

==Domestication==
=== Crops ===
Once agriculture started gaining momentum, around 9000 BP, human activity resulted in the selective breeding of cereal grasses (beginning with emmer, einkorn and barley), and not simply of those that favoured greater caloric returns through larger seeds. Plants with traits such as small seeds or bitter taste were seen as undesirable. Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest, therefore not stored and not seeded the following season; successive years of harvesting spontaneously selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer.
Daniel Zohary identified several plant species as &quot;pioneer crops&quot; or Neolithic founder crops. He highlighted the importance of wheat, barley and rye, and suggested that domestication of flax, peas, chickpeas, bitter vetch and lentils came a little later. Based on analysis of the genes of domesticated plants, he preferred theories of a single, or at most a very small number of domestication events for each taxon that spread in an arc from the Levantine corridor around the Fertile Crescent and later into Europe. Gordon Hillman and Stuart Davies carried out experiments with varieties of wild wheat to show that the process of domestication would have occurred over a relatively short period of between 20 and 200 years.

Some of the pioneering attempts failed at first and crops were abandoned, sometimes to be taken up again and successfully domesticated thousands of years later: rye, tried and abandoned in Neolithic Anatolia, made its way to Europe as weed seeds and was successfully domesticated in Europe, thousands of years after the earliest agriculture. Wild lentils presented a different problem: most of the wild seeds do not germinate in the first year; the first evidence of lentil domestication, breaking dormancy in their first year, appears in the early Neolithic at Jerf el Ahmar (in modern Syria), and lentils quickly spread south to the Netiv HaGdud site in the Jordan Valley. The process of domestication allowed the founder crops to adapt and eventually become larger, more easily harvested, more dependable in storage and more useful to the human population.
Selectively propagated figs, wild barley and wild oats were cultivated at the early Neolithic site of Gilgal I, where in 2006 archaeologists found caches of seeds of each in quantities too large to be accounted for even by intensive gathering, at strata datable to 11,000 years ago. Some of the plants tried and then abandoned during the Neolithic period in the Ancient Near East, at sites like Gilgal, were later successfully domesticated in other parts of the world.

Once early farmers perfected their agricultural techniques like irrigation (traced as far back as the 6th millennium BCE in Khuzistan), their crops yielded surpluses that needed storage. Most hunter-gatherers could not easily store food for long due to their migratory lifestyle, whereas those with a sedentary dwelling could store their surplus grain. Eventually granaries were developed that allowed villages to store their seeds longer. So with more food, the population expanded and communities developed specialized workers and more advanced tools.

The process was not as linear as was once thought, but a more complicated effort, which was undertaken by different human populations in different regions in many different ways.
One of the world&#x27;s most important crops, barley, was domesticated in the Near East around 11,000 years ago (). Barley is a highly resilient crop, able to grow in varied and marginal environments, such as in regions of high altitude and latitude. Archaeobotanical evidence shows that barley had spread throughout Eurasia by 2,000 BCE. To further elucidate the routes by which barley cultivation was spread through Eurasia, genetic analysis was used to determine genetic diversity and population structure in extant barley taxa. Genetic analysis shows that cultivated barley spread through Eurasia via several different routes, which were most likely separated in both time and space.

=== Livestock ===

When hunter-gathering began to be replaced by sedentary food production it became more efficient to keep animals close at hand. Therefore, it became necessary to bring animals permanently to their settlements, although in many cases there was a distinction between relatively sedentary farmers and nomadic herders. The animals&#x27; size, temperament, diet, mating patterns, and life span were factors in the desire and success in domesticating animals. Animals that provided milk, such as cows and goats, offered a source of protein that was renewable and therefore quite valuable. The animal&#x27;s ability as a worker (for example ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account. Besides being a direct source of food, certain animals could provide leather, wool, hides, and fertilizer. Some of the earliest domesticated animals included dogs (East Asia, about 15,000 years ago), sheep, goats, cows, and pigs.

West Asia was the source for many animals that could be domesticated, such as sheep, goats and pigs. This area was also the first region to domesticate the dromedary. Henri Fleisch discovered and termed the Shepherd Neolithic flint industry from the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon and suggested that it could have been used by the earliest nomadic shepherds. He dated this industry to the Epipaleolithic or Pre-Pottery Neolithic as it is evidently not Paleolithic, Mesolithic or even Pottery Neolithic.

The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development. As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier, many of the farmers were forced to leave, taking their domesticated animals with them. It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that later helped distribute these animals to the rest of Afroeurasia. This emigration was mainly on an east–west axis of similar climates, as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes. For instance, wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates, just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates. Some authors, like Jared Diamond, have postulated that this east–west axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the Fertile Crescent to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa, while it did not reach through the north–south axis of Africa to reach the Mediterranean climates of South Africa, where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years. Similarly, the African Zebu of central Africa and the domesticated bovines of the fertile-crescent – separated by the dry sahara desert – were not introduced into each other&#x27;s region.

==Centers of agricultural origin==
===West Asia===

Use-wear analysis of five glossed flint blades found at Ohalo II, a 23,000-years-old fisher-hunter-gatherers&#x27; camp on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Northern Israel, provides the earliest evidence for the use of composite cereal harvesting tools. The Ohalo site is at the junction of the Upper Paleolithic and the Early Epipaleolithic, and has been attributed to both periods.

The wear traces indicate that tools were used for harvesting near-ripe semi-green wild cereals, shortly before grains are ripe and disperse naturally. The studied tools were not used intensively, and they reflect two harvesting modes: flint knives held by hand and inserts hafted in a handle. The finds shed new light on cereal harvesting techniques some 8,000 years before the Natufian and 12,000 years before the establishment of sedentary farming communities in the Near East. Furthermore, the new finds accord well with evidence for the earliest ever cereal cultivation at the site and the use of stone-made grinding implements.

Agriculture appeared first in West Asia about 2,000 years later, around 10,000–9,000 years ago. The region was the centre of domestication for three cereals (einkorn wheat, emmer wheat and barley), four legumes (lentil, pea, bitter vetch and chickpea), and flax. Domestication was a slow process that unfolded across multiple regions, and was preceded by centuries if not millennia of pre-domestication cultivation.

Finds of large quantities of seeds and a grinding stone at the Epipalaeolithic site of Ohalo II, dating to around 19,400 BP, has shown some of the earliest evidence for advanced planning of plants for food consumption and suggests that humans at Ohalo II processed the grain before consumption. Tell Aswad is the oldest site of agriculture, with domesticated emmer wheat dated to 10,800 BP. Soon after came hulled, two-row barley – found domesticated earliest at Jericho in the Jordan valley and at Iraq ed-Dubb in Jordan.

Other sites in the Levantine corridor that show early evidence of agriculture include Wadi Faynan 16 and Netiv Hagdud. Jacques Cauvin noted that the settlers of Aswad did not domesticate on site, but &quot;arrived, perhaps from the neighbouring Anti-Lebanon, already equipped with the seed for planting&quot;. In the Eastern Fertile Crescent, evidence of cultivation of wild plants has been found in Choga Gholan in Iran dated to 12,000 BP, with domesticated emmer wheat appearing in 9,800 BP, suggesting there may have been multiple regions in the Fertile Crescent where cereal domestication evolved roughly contemporaneously. The Heavy Neolithic Qaraoun culture has been identified at around fifty sites in Lebanon around the source springs of the River Jordan, but never reliably dated.

In his book &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;, Jared Diamond argues that the vast continuous east–west stretch of temperate climatic zones of Eurasia and North Africa gave peoples living there a highly advantageous geographical location that afforded them a head start in the Neolithic Revolution. Both shared the temperate climate ideal for the first agricultural settings, and both were near a number of easily domesticable plant and animal species. In areas where continents aligned north–south such as the Americas and Africa, crops—and later domesticated animals—could not spread across tropical zones.

===East Asia===

Agriculture in Neolithic China can be separated into two broad regions, Northern China and Southern China.

The agricultural centre in northern China is believed to be the homelands of the early Sino-Tibetan-speakers, associated with the Houli, Peiligang, Cishan, and Xinglongwa cultures, clustered around the Yellow River basin. It was the domestication centre for foxtail millet (&quot;Setaria italica&quot;) and broomcorn millet (&quot;Panicum miliaceum&quot;), with early evidence of domestication approximately 8,000 years ago,&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1093/aob/mcm048&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and widespread cultivation 7,500 years ago. (Soybean was also domesticated in northern China 4,500 years ago. Orange and peach also originated in China, being cultivated .)

The agricultural centres in southern China are clustered around the Yangtze River basin. Rice was domesticated in this region, together with the development of paddy field cultivation, between 13,500 and 8,200 years ago.

There are two possible centres of domestication for rice. The first is in the lower Yangtze River, believed to be the homelands of pre-Austronesians and associated with the Kauhuqiao, Hemudu, Majiabang, and Songze cultures. It is characterized by typical pre-Austronesian features, including stilt houses, jade carving, and boat technologies. Their diet were also supplemented by acorns, water chestnuts, foxnuts, and pig domestication. The second is in the middle Yangtze River, believed to be the homelands of the early Hmong-Mien-speakers and associated with the Pengtoushan and Daxi cultures. Both of these regions were heavily populated and had regular trade contacts with each other, as well as with early Austroasiatic speakers to the west, and early Kra-Dai speakers to the south, facilitating the spread of rice cultivation throughout southern China.
The millet and rice-farming cultures also first came into contact with each other at around 9,000 to 7,000 BP, resulting in a corridor between the millet and rice cultivation centres where both rice and millet were cultivated. At around 5,500 to 4,000 BP, there was increasing migration into Taiwan from the early Austronesian Dapenkeng culture, bringing rice and millet cultivation technology with them. During this period, there is evidence of large settlements and intensive rice cultivation in Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, which may have resulted in overexploitation. Bellwood (2011) proposes that this may have been the impetus of the Austronesian expansion which started with the migration of the Austronesian-speakers from Taiwan to the Philippines at around 5,000 BP.

Austronesians carried rice cultivation technology to Island Southeast Asia along with other domesticated species. The new tropical island environments also had new food plants that they exploited. They carried useful plants and animals during each colonization voyage, resulting in the rapid introduction of domesticated and semi-domesticated species throughout Oceania. They also came into contact with the early agricultural centres of Papuan-speaking populations of New Guinea as well as the Dravidian-speaking regions of South India and Sri Lanka by around 3,500 BP. They acquired further cultivated food plants like bananas and pepper from them, and in turn introduced Austronesian technologies like wetland cultivation and outrigger canoes. During the 1st millennium CE, they also colonized Madagascar and the Comoros, bringing Southeast Asian food plants, including rice, to East Africa.

===Africa===
On the African continent, three areas have been identified as independently developing agriculture: the Ethiopian highlands, the Sahel and West Africa. By contrast, Agriculture in the Nile River Valley is thought to have developed from the original Neolithic Revolution in the Fertile Crescent.
Many grinding stones are found with the early Egyptian Sebilian and Mechian cultures and evidence has been found of a neolithic domesticated crop-based economy dating around 7,000 BP.
Unlike the Middle East, this evidence appears as a &quot;false dawn&quot; to agriculture, as the sites were later abandoned, and permanent farming then was delayed until 6,500 BP with the Tasian culture and Badarian culture and the arrival of crops and animals from the Near East.

Bananas and plantains, which were first domesticated in Southeast Asia, most likely Papua New Guinea, were re-domesticated in Africa possibly as early as 5,000 years ago. Asian yams and taro were also cultivated in Africa.

The most famous crop domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands is coffee. In addition, khat, ensete, noog, teff and finger millet were also domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands. Crops domesticated in the Sahel region include sorghum and pearl millet. The kola nut was first domesticated in West Africa. Other crops domesticated in West Africa include African rice, yams and the oil palm.

Agriculture spread to Central and Southern Africa in the Bantu expansion during the 1st millennium BCE to 1st millennium CE.
===Americas===

The term &quot;Neolithic&quot; is not customarily used in describing cultures in the Americas. However, a broad similarity exists between Eastern Hemisphere cultures of the Neolithic and cultures in the Americas. Maize (corn), beans and squash were among the earliest crops domesticated in Mesoamerica: squash as early as 6000 BCE, beans no later than 4000 BCE, and maize beginning about 7000 BCE. Potatoes and manioc were domesticated in South America. In what is now the eastern United States, Native Americans domesticated sunflower, sumpweed and goosefoot . In the highlands of central Mexico, sedentary village life based on farming did not develop until the &quot;formative period&quot; in the second millennium BCE.

===New Guinea===

Evidence of drainage ditches at Kuk Swamp on the borders of the Western and Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea indicates cultivation of taro and a variety of other crops, dating back to 11,000 BP. Two potentially significant economic species, taro (&quot;Colocasia esculenta&quot;) and yam (&quot;Dioscorea&quot; sp.), have been identified dating at least to 10,200 calibrated years before present (cal BP). Further evidence of bananas and sugarcane dates to 6,950 to 6,440 BCE. This was at the altitudinal limits of these crops, and it has been suggested that cultivation in more favourable ranges in the lowlands may have been even earlier. CSIRO has found evidence that taro was introduced into the Solomon Islands for human use, from 28,000 years ago, making taro the earliest cultivated crop in the world.
It seems to have resulted in the spread of the Trans–New Guinea languages from New Guinea east into the Solomon Islands and west into Timor and adjacent areas of Indonesia. This seems to confirm the theories of Carl Sauer who, in &quot;Agricultural Origins and Dispersals&quot;, suggested as early as 1952 that this region was a centre of early agriculture.

== Spread of agriculture ==

===Europe===
Archaeologists trace the emergence of food-producing societies in the Levantine region of southwest Asia at the close of the last glacial period around 12,000 BCE, and developed into a number of regionally distinctive cultures by the eighth millennium BCE. Remains of food-producing societies in the Aegean have been carbon-dated to at Knossos, Franchthi Cave, and a number of mainland sites in Thessaly. Neolithic groups appear soon afterwards in the Balkans and south-central Europe. The Neolithic cultures of southeastern Europe (the Balkans and the Aegean) show some continuity with groups in southwest Asia and Anatolia (e.g., Çatalhöyük).

Current evidence suggests that Neolithic material culture was introduced to Europe via western Anatolia. All Neolithic sites in Europe contain ceramics, and contain the plants and animals domesticated in Southwest Asia: einkorn, emmer, barley, lentils, pigs, goats, sheep, and cattle. Genetic data suggest that no independent domestication of animals took place in Neolithic Europe, and that all domesticated animals were originally domesticated in Southwest Asia. The only domesticate not from Southwest Asia was broomcorn millet, domesticated in East Asia.The earliest evidence of cheese-making dates to 5500 BCE in Kujawy, Poland.

The diffusion across Europe, from the Aegean to Britain, took about 2,500 years (8500–6000 BP). The Baltic region was penetrated a bit later, around 5500 BP, and there was also a delay in settling the Pannonian plain. In general, colonization shows a &quot;saltatory&quot; pattern, as the Neolithic advanced from one patch of fertile alluvial soil to another, bypassing mountainous areas. Analysis of radiocarbon dates show clearly that Mesolithic and Neolithic populations lived side by side for as much as a millennium in many parts of Europe, especially in the Iberian peninsula and along the Atlantic coast.

====Carbon 14 evidence====

The spread of the Neolithic from the Near East Neolithic to Europe was first studied quantitatively in the 1970s, when a sufficient number of Carbon 14 age determinations for early Neolithic sites had become available. In 1973, Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza discovered a linear relationship between the age of an Early Neolithic site and its distance from the conventional source in the Near East (Jericho), demonstrating that the Neolithic spread at an average speed of about 1 km/yr. More recent studies (2005) confirm these results and yield the speed of 0.6–1.3 km/yr (at 95% confidence level).

====Analysis of mitochondrial DNA====
Since the original human expansions out of Africa 200,000 years ago, different prehistoric and historic migration events have taken place in Europe. Considering that the movement of the people implies a consequent movement of their genes, it is possible to estimate the impact of these migrations through the genetic analysis of human populations. Agricultural and husbandry practices originated 10,000 years ago in a region of the Near East known as the Fertile Crescent. According to the archaeological record this phenomenon, known as &quot;Neolithic&quot;, rapidly expanded from these territories into Europe.

However, whether this diffusion was accompanied or not by human migrations is greatly debated. Mitochondrial DNA – a type of maternally inherited DNA located in the cell cytoplasm – was recovered from the remains of Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) farmers in the Near East and then compared to available data from other Neolithic populations in Europe and also to modern populations from South Eastern Europe and the Near East. The obtained results show that substantial human migrations were involved in the Neolithic spread and suggest that the first Neolithic farmers entered Europe following a maritime route through Cyprus and the Aegean Islands.

===South Asia===

The earliest Neolithic sites in South Asia are Bhirrana in Haryana dated to , and Mehrgarh, dated to between 6500 and 5500 BP, in the Kachi plain of Balochistan, Pakistan; the site has evidence of farming (wheat and barley) and herding (cattle, sheep and goats).

There is strong evidence for causal connections between the Near-Eastern Neolithic and that further east, up to the Indus Valley. There are several lines of evidence that support the idea of connection between the Neolithic in the Near East and in the Indian subcontinent. The prehistoric site of Mehrgarh in Baluchistan (modern Pakistan) is the earliest Neolithic site in the north-west Indian subcontinent, dated as early as 8500 BCE.

Neolithic domesticated crops in Mehrgarh include more than 90% barley and a small amount of wheat. There is good evidence for the local domestication of barley and the zebu cattle at Mehrgarh, but the wheat varieties are suggested to be of Near-Eastern origin, as the modern distribution of wild varieties of wheat is limited to Northern Levant and Southern Turkey.

A detailed satellite map study of a few archaeological sites in the Baluchistan and Khybar Pakhtunkhwa regions also suggests similarities in early phases of farming with sites in Western Asia. Pottery prepared by sequential slab construction, circular fire pits filled with burnt pebbles, and large granaries are common to both Mehrgarh and many Mesopotamian sites.

The postures of the skeletal remains in graves at Mehrgarh bear strong resemblance to those at Ali Kosh in the Zagros Mountains of southern Iran. Despite their scarcity, the Carbon-14 and archaeological age determinations for early Neolithic sites in Southern Asia exhibit remarkable continuity across the vast region from the Near East to the Indian Subcontinent, consistent with a systematic eastward spread at a speed of about 0.65 km/yr.

== Causes ==

The most prominent of several theories (not mutually exclusive) as to factors that caused populations to develop agriculture include:
* The Oasis Theory, originally proposed by Raphael Pumpelly in 1908, popularized by V. Gordon Childe in 1928 and summarised in Childe&#x27;s book &quot;Man Makes Himself&quot;. This theory maintains that as the climate got drier due to the Atlantic depressions shifting northward, communities contracted to oases where they were forced into close association with animals, which were then domesticated together with planting of seeds. However, this theory now has little support amongst archaeologists because subsequent climate data suggests that the region was getting wetter rather than drier.
* The Hilly Flanks hypothesis, proposed by Robert John Braidwood in 1948, suggests that agriculture began in the hilly flanks of the Taurus and Zagros Mountains, where the climate was not drier as Childe had believed, and fertile land supported a variety of plants and animals amenable to domestication.
* The Feasting model by Brian Hayden suggests that agriculture was driven by ostentatious displays of power, such as giving feasts, to exert dominance. This required assembling large quantities of food, which drove agricultural technology.
* The Demographic theories proposed by Carl Sauer and adapted by Lewis Binford and Kent Flannery posit an increasingly sedentary population that expanded up to the carrying capacity of the local environment and required more food than could be gathered. Various social and economic factors helped drive the need for food.
* The evolutionary/intentionality theory, developed by David Rindos and others, considers agriculture as an evolutionary adaptation of plants and humans. Starting with domestication by protection of wild plants, it resulted specialization of location and then complete domestication.
* Peter Richerson, Robert Boyd, and Robert Bettinger make a case for the development of agriculture coinciding with an increasingly stable climate at the beginning of the Holocene. Ronald Wright&#x27;s book and Massey Lecture Series &quot;A Short History of Progress&quot; popularized this hypothesis.
* Leonid Grinin argues that whatever plants were cultivated, the independent invention of agriculture always occurred in special natural environments (e.g., South-East Asia). It is supposed that the cultivation of cereals started somewhere in the Near East: in the hills of Israel or Egypt. So Grinin dates the beginning of the agricultural revolution within the interval 12,000 to 9,000 BP, though in some cases the first cultivated plants or domesticated animals&#x27; bones are even of a more ancient age of 14–15 thousand years ago.
* Andrew Moore suggested that the Neolithic Revolution originated over long periods of development in the Levant, possibly beginning during the Epipaleolithic. In &quot;A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution&quot;, Frank Hole further expanded the relationship between plant and animal domestication. He suggested the events could have occurred independently during different periods of time, in as yet unexplored locations. He noted that no transition site had been found documenting the shift from what he termed immediate and delayed return social systems. He noted that the full range of domesticated animals (goats, sheep, cattle and pigs) were not found until the sixth millennium BCE at Tell Ramad. Hole concluded that &quot;close attention should be paid in future investigations to the western margins of the Euphrates basin, perhaps as far south as the Arabian Peninsula, especially where wadis carrying Pleistocene rainfall runoff flowed.&quot;

== Consequences ==

===Social change===
Despite the significant technological advance and advancements in knowledge, arts and trade, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects, mostly diseases and warfare.

The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increase in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth. Average height for Europeans went down from 178 cm (5&#x27;10&quot;) for men and 168 cm (5&#x27;6&quot;) for women to 165 cm (5&#x27;5&quot;) and 155 cm (5&#x27;1&quot;) respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average height for Europeans to return to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.

The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making. Nonetheless, larger societies made it more feasible for people to adopt diverse decision making and governance models. Jared Diamond (in &quot;The World Until Yesterday&quot;) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently. The result is that a population can increase more rapidly. Diamond, in agreement with feminist scholars such as V. Spike Peterson, points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged gender inequality. This social reshuffle is traced by historical theorists, like Veronica Strang, through developments in theological depictions. Strang supports her theory through a comparison of aquatic deities before and after the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution, most notably the Venus of Lespugue and the Greco-Roman deities such as Circe or Charybdis: the former venerated and respected, the latter dominated and conquered. The theory, supplemented by the widely accepted assumption from Parsons that &quot;society is always the object of religious veneration&quot;, argues that with the centralization of government and the dawn of the Anthropocene, roles within society became more restrictive and were rationalized through the conditioning effect of religion; a process that is crystallized in the progression from polytheism to monotheism.

===Subsequent revolutions===
Andrew Sherratt has argued that following upon the Neolithic Revolution was a second phase of discovery that he refers to as the secondary products revolution. Animals, it appears, were first domesticated purely as a source of meat. The Secondary Products Revolution occurred when it was recognised that animals also provided a number of other useful products. These included:
* hides and skins (from undomesticated animals)
* manure for soil conditioning (from all domesticated animals)
* wool (from sheep, llamas, alpacas, and Angora goats)
* milk (from goats, cattle, yaks, sheep, horses, and camels)
* traction (from oxen, onagers, donkeys, horses, camels, and dogs)
* guarding and herding assistance (dogs)

Sherratt argued that this phase in agricultural development enabled humans to make use of the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for farming. It also made possible nomadic pastoralism in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the dromedary and Bactrian camel. Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts.

===Diet and health===

Compared to foragers, Neolithic farmers&#x27; diets were higher in carbohydrates but lower in fibre, micronutrients, and protein. This led to an increase in the frequency of carious teeth and slower growth in childhood , and studies have consistently found that populations around the world became shorter after the transition to agriculture. This trend may have been exacerbated by the greater seasonality of farming diets and with it the increased risk of famine due to crop failure.

Throughout the development of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed. Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution, as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population. Some examples of infectious diseases spread from animals to humans are influenza, smallpox, and measles. Ancient microbial genomics has shown that progenitors to human-adapted strains of &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; infected up to 5,500 year old agro-pastoralists throughout Western Eurasia, providing molecular evidence for the hypothesis that the Neolithization process facilitated the emergence of Salmonella entericia.

In concordance with a process of natural selection, the humans who first domesticated the big mammals quickly built up immunities to the diseases as within each generation the individuals with better immunities had better chances of survival. In their approximately 10,000 years of shared proximity with animals, such as cows, Eurasians and Africans became more resistant to those diseases compared with the indigenous populations encountered outside Eurasia and Africa. For instance, the population of most Caribbean and several Pacific Islands have been completely wiped out by diseases. 90% or more of many populations of the Americas were wiped out by European and African diseases before recorded contact with European explorers or colonists. Some cultures like the Inca Empire did have a large domestic mammal, the llama, but llama milk was not drunk, nor did llamas live in a closed space with humans, so the risk of contagion was limited. According to bioarchaeological research, the effects of agriculture on dental health in Southeast Asian rice farming societies from 4000 to 1500 BP was not detrimental to the same extent as in other world regions.

Jonathan C. K. Wells and Jay T. Stock have argued that the dietary changes and increased pathogen exposure associated with agriculture profoundly altered human biology and life history, creating conditions where natural selection favoured the allocation of resources towards reproduction over somatic effort.

<doc id="639127" wikidata="Q461375" url="?curid=639127" title="French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle">
<text>Charles de Gaulle is the flagship of the French Navy. The ship, commissioned in 2001, is the tenth French aircraft carrier, the first French nuclear-powered surface vessel, and the only nuclear-powered carrier completed outside of the United States Navy. She is named after French president and general Charles de Gaulle.

The ship carries a complement of Dassault Rafale M and E-2C Hawkeye aircraft, AS365F Dauphin Pedro, EC725 Caracal and AS532 Cougar helicopters for combat search and rescue, as well as modern electronics and Aster missiles. She is a CATOBAR-type carrier that uses two C13‑3 steam catapults of a shorter version of the catapult system installed on the US aircraft carriers, one at the bow and one at the waist. As of July 2021, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; was the only non-American carrier-vessel that had a catapult launch system, which has allowed for operation of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets&lt;ref name=&quot;F/A 18E-CDG&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and C-2 Greyhounds of the United States Navy.

==Development==

===Construction===
The carrier replaced , a conventionally powered aircraft carrier, in 2001. and &quot;Foch&quot; were completed in 1961 and 1963 respectively; the requirement for a replacement was identified in the mid-1970s.

The hull was laid down in April 1989 at the DCN Brest naval shipyard. The carrier was launched in May 1994 and at 42,000 tonnes (full load) was the largest warship launched in Western Europe since in 1950. She was to be named &quot;Richelieu&quot; in 1986 by the French president at the time, François Mitterrand, after the famous French statesman Armand-Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu. On 18 May 1987, the name of the ship was changed to &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; by the Gaullist Prime Minister Jacques Chirac.

Construction quickly fell behind schedule as the project was starved of funding, which was worsened by the economic recession in the early 1990s. Total costs for the vessel would top €3 billion. Work on the ship was suspended altogether on four occasions: 1990, 1991, 1993, and 1995. The ship was commissioned on 18 May 2001, five years behind the projected deadline.

In 1993, it was alleged by &quot;The Guardian&quot; that a group of engineers inspecting the vessel during her construction were British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) operatives, believed to have been learning the method of shielding the nuclear reactors, amongst other technical details. The newspaper published a denial by both the British government and the &quot;Direction de la surveillance du territoire&quot; (DST) (in English: &quot;Directorate of Territorial Surveillance&quot;) that there had been any incident.

===Trials and technical problems===

&quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; entered sea trials in 1999 which identified the need to extend the flight deck to safely operate the E-2C Hawkeye. This operation sparked negative publicity, as the same tests had been conducted on &quot;Foch&quot; and &quot;Clemenceau&quot; when the F-8E (FN) Crusader fighter had been introduced. The 5 million francs for the extension was 0.025% of the total budget for the &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; project.

The ship left Toulon for her fourteenth and final sea trial on 24 October 2000. During the night of 9–10 November, in the Western Atlantic while en route toward Norfolk, Virginia, the port propeller broke, and the ship had to return to Toulon to have a replacement fitted. Although the supplier, Atlantic Industrie, was not believed to have intentionally been at fault, it was nevertheless blamed for poor-quality construction. Not long after the French defence minister ordered an investigation on quality management, a fire destroyed the archives of the supplier. As a temporary solution, the less advanced spare propellers of &quot;Clemenceau&quot; were used, limiting the maximum speed to instead of the contractual .

On 5 March 2001, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; returned to sea with the ex-&quot;Clemenceau&quot; propellers and reached on her trials.

On 16 September 2001 the French press reported slightly higher than acceptable radioactivity levels aboard &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, thought to be caused by a faulty isolation element. It was later discovered that the radioactivity levels matched the design, but that the regulations concerning acceptable radioactivity levels had changed. While the United States was preparing its response to the 11 September attacks in the form of Operation Enduring Freedom, French media complained about the lack of deployable French military power. At the same time, the Defence Commission reported the maintenance of the Fleet to be substandard. In this context, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, then under repairs, was again an object of criticism, with former President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing describing it as a &quot;half-aircraft-carrier&quot; and requesting the launching of the second carrier vessel (named PA2) to guarantee an availability rate of 100%.

===Maintenance and upgrades===
&quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; first major overhaul began in September 2007. The highlight of this 15-month refit was the refuelling of the nuclear power plant, a necessary step after six years in service, during which &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; sailed the equivalent of 12 times around the world, spent 900 days at sea, and performed 19,000 catapult launches. Several improvements were also made, including the installation of new propellers. These allow &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; to reach her design speed of 27 knots, replacing the propellers used since 2001. Aircraft maintenance and weapons stores were also upgraded to allow the operation of new Rafale F3 fighters armed with ASMP-A nuclear missiles and SCALP EG cruise missiles, and satellite communications bandwidth will be increased tenfold. This refit increased displacement to 42500 tonnes and was completed in December 2008. After technical problems in March 2009, the carrier was back in Toulon for repairs. An intensive work-up period was planned to bring &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; and her air group back to operational status.

On 14 October 2010, a four-month cruise was cut down to a single day when the ship suffered an electrical fault in its propulsion system.

The aircraft carrier underwent an 18-month midlife upgrade and refit begun in February 2017 and returned to service in September 2018. The nuclear reactor was refuelled, standard maintenance was completed, and the ship&#x27;s combat system was modernized, to better communicate with allies and support the Rafale fighters employed by the carrier.

==Operational service==
On 11 October 2001, the frigate , four AWACS aircraft and &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; were involved in a successful trial of the Link 16 high-bandwidth secure data network. The network allows real-time monitoring of the airspace from the south of England to the Mediterranean Sea. The collected data were also transmitted in real-time to the frigate through the older MIL-STD-6011 system.
=== Afghanistan ===
On 21 November 2001, France sent &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; to the Indian Ocean in support of Operation Enduring Freedom against Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Task Force 473, with 2,900 personnel under the command of Contre-Amiral François Cluzel, sailed on 1 December. The task force was composed of &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, frigates , and &quot;Jean Bart&quot;, the nuclear attack submarine , the tanker and the . Embarked air power comprised sixteen Super Étendards, one E-2C Hawkeye, two Rafale Ms, and several helicopters. The Super Étendards carried out their first missions above Afghanistan on 19 December, executing reconnaissance and bombing missions, covering over . Approximately 770 sorties were carried out from the carrier.

From February 2002, the air wings of &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; and landed on each other&#x27;s decks as a means of strengthening the ties between the allies. On 18 February 2002, a Helios observation satellite spotted abnormal activities near Gardez. The next day, after American Special Forces in the region confirmed these observations, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; launched two reconnaissance Super Étendards. On 20 February 2002, British and US forces entered the valley and Operation Anaconda began in early March 2002. In March, Super Étendards and six land-based Mirage 2000 aircraft carried out airstrikes against targets claimed to be al Qaeda. A few targets suggested by US forces were denied out of fear of hitting civilians. French involvement was complimented on 11 March 2002 by US President George W. Bush, who mentioned &quot;our good ally, France, has deployed nearly one-fourth of its navy to support Operation Enduring Freedom&quot;. At this point, the French air complement had been increased to 16 Super Étendards, 6 Mirage 2000 D, 5 Rafales, and 2 Hawkeye AWACS. On 2 May, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; arrived in Singapore for relief, and returned to Oman on 18 May.

=== Indian-Pakistani crisis ===

In June 2002 while &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; was in the Arabian Sea, armed Rafale fighters conducted combat air patrols with the United States Navy off the coasts of India and Pakistan, marking a significant point in the Rafale M&#x27;s operational career and its integration with the carrier.

=== Continuing operations ===
&quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; participated in further actions as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2005. She returned to Southwest Asia in May 2006 and shortly after supported coalition efforts over Afghanistan. The aircraft carrier regularly participatds in the annual bilateral naval exercises between the Indian and French navies called &#x27;Varuna&#x27;.

=== Fifth overseas deployment: Task Force 473 and Operation Agapanthus 2010 ===
A French naval task group, designated Task Force 473, led by &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; departed Toulon on 30 October 2010 for a four-month deployment, code-named Operation Agapanthus 2010, to the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf. The task group also included the frigates and ; the nuclear attack submarine ; the replenishment oiler &quot;Meuse&quot;, 3,000 sailors, and an Embarked Aviation Group (EAG) consisting of 12 Super Étendard attack aircraft, 10 Rafale multi-role fighters, and two E-2C Hawkeye 2000 AEW aircraft.

On 28 November 2010, according to an Associated Press dispatch, the French Ministry of Defence announced that a French Rafale fighter jet crashed near &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, which was operating off the coast of Pakistan in the Arabian Sea in support of coalition forces in Afghanistan. The pilot parachuted to safety and was picked up by helicopter, and , the cause of the crash was under investigation.

In December 2010, during its deployment to the Persian Gulf, the British Type 22 frigate and the United States destroyer rotated from maritime security patrol to escort &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; in support of coalition military operations in Afghanistan. This represented an example of interoperability pursuant to the recently ratified Anglo-French defence cooperation treaty.

Between 7–14 January 2011, Task Force 473 participated in bilateral naval exercises, code-named Varuna 10, with the Indian Navy. Indian naval units participating in Varuna 10 included the aircraft carrier , the frigates and ; and the diesel-electric submarine . Varuna 10 was a two-phase naval exercise, with the harbour phase taking place between 7–11 January and the sea phase between 11 and 14 January in the Arabian Sea. Task Force 473 paid a port visit to Goa between 7–14 January 2011. The carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; and the frigate &quot;Forbin&quot; also paid a goodwill visit to Khor Fakkan, United Arab Emirates, on 30 January 2011, docking at its container terminal facilities.

Operation Agapanthus 2010 concluded on 21 February 2011. Task Force 473 completed more than 1,000 flying hours flown from &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; in support of NATO&#x27;s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) deployed in Afghanistan. Task Force 473 also participated in bilateral exercises with armed forces of India, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to test the interoperability of French military forces and share expertise with the regional partners.

=== 2011 Mediterranean operations ===

On 20 March 2011, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 which called for a no-fly zone over Libya. Accompanying &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; were the frigates and and the fleet replenishment tanker &quot;Meuse&quot;.

During Unified Protector, the air fleet had flown 1,350 sorties during the intervention in Libya. &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; was then withdrawn for maintenance at Toulon on 10 August.

Following this deployment, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; underwent maintenance and upkeep during an at-sea underway period in December 2011.

=== 2012 FANAL exercises ===
On 2 February 2012, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; was underway for three days of sea trials. Beginning on 5 February 2012, carrier qualifications began for the pilots of its air group. This included transitioning of pilots flying Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM) strike fighters to the new Rafale M fighters.

On 16 March 2012, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; departed for a one-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;″s task force was under the overall command of Rear Admiral Philippe Coindreau, and it consisted of the frigates , &quot;Dupleix&quot;, , and ; the replenishment ship &quot;Meuse&quot;; and the nuclear-powered submarine &quot;Émeraude&quot;. &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;″s embarked air group consisted of 7 Rafale fighters, 7 Super Étendards Modernisés (SEM) strike fighters, and 2 E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft. The highlight of the deployment for the task group was 2012 FANAL exercises that began on 5 April 2012 which also included land-based Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft. 2012 FANAL concluded on 12 April, and this was the first major exercise involving the French Navy&#x27;s new Caïman helicopter.

=== Operations against Islamic State ===
In January 2015, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; began being prepared for exercises in the Indian Ocean. In late February, the carrier and its battle group entered the Persian Gulf to participate in Opération Chammal against Islamic State militants in Iraq. France was the first country to join the American-led intervention and has 15 fighters, a patrol aircraft, and refuelling aircraft based on land in neighbouring countries. The addition of &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; added up to another 30 aircraft to France&#x27;s commitment to operations. The carrier battle group arrived in the Persian Gulf on 15 February 2015 and began launching airstrikes on 22 February; this occurred seven weeks after the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; attacks, as France vowed to be more responsive to jihadist terrorism. Sailing off the north coast of Bahrain, the carrier&#x27;s 12 Rafale and 9 Super Étendard fighters could reach targets in half the time it would take French fighters based in the United Arab Emirates. &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; left the Persian Gulf in late-April 2015 after launching strike and surveillance missions against IS targets to participate in exercises with the Indian military; the carrier launched 10–15 sorties per day during its two-month deployment.

On 5 November 2015, France announced &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; would return to the area to conduct operations and the ship departed from its base at Toulon on 18 November. Although originally planned to redeploy to the Persian Gulf, the carrier and its strike group was re-routed to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea off the Syrian coastline, much closer to targets within Syria. Sources claimed &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; had a larger than normal air wing of 26 fighters consisting of 18 Rafales and 8 Super Étendards; the carrier had approximately 31–34 aircraft total (the official limit is 40 aircraft). The carrier began operations on 23 November 2015, ten days after the ISIL terrorist attacks in Paris. On 7 December, Rear Admiral René-Jean Crignola of the French Maritime Force, embarked in &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, took command of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command&#x27;s Task Force 50, leading coalition naval strike operations. He was the first non-American to do so. In June 2016, the United States Navy awarded the crew of &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; a Meritorious Unit Commendation for its accomplishments.

In late September 2016, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; was deployed from Toulon to the Syrian coast for the Battle of Mosul. Its squadron of 24 Rafale M aircraft supported the international coalition against ISIL through airstrikes and reconnaissance missions.

In 2020, while continuing Opération Chammal in the Eastern Mediterranean, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; was joined by the United States Navy . They joined forces on Operation Inherent Resolve, an international coalition against the Daesh. Throughout the mission, the carrier strike group was joined by allied navy vessels from Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal. The cooperation illustrated common operational efficiency in the Mediterranean. During the operation, the &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; carrier group, its 2,000-member crew, a and a Hellenic Navy frigate docked at the Port of Limassol for a five-day port call. The President of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, and ambassador Isabelle Dumont addressed the aircraft crew in the presence of Captain Guillaume Pinget.

=== Mission Clemenceau ===
The aircraft carrier led the carrier strike group Task Force 473 on a five-month long operation that began in March 2019, through the Mediterranean Sea. Aircraft from &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; participated in the last major combat against the Islamic State in the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani and then sailed for the Indian Ocean. Arriving in Singapore on 28 May, the aircraft carrier participated in a bilateral exercise with the Singapore Armed Forces.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

In April 2020, 40 crew members began to show symptoms of COVID-19, requiring &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; to return to her home port at Toulon earlier than planned, as reported on 8 April by the Ministry of Armed Forces.

After 66 tests were conducted, the ministry announced on 10 April that 50 tests had returned positive. Three sailors were evacuated by helicopter to .

On 19 April, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that 1,081 crew members in the carrier&#x27;s naval group had tested positive, nearly all of which were on board &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;. The figure equated to nearly 60 percent of the carrier&#x27;s total complement.

On 11 May 2020, Florence Parly reported to the National Assembly the conclusions of two investigations into the outbreak on board the carrier, stating that the virus had first arrived before a stopover made in Brest, and that although the command and medical team aboard the carrier had &quot;excessive confidence&quot; in their ability to deal with the virus, the investigations did not consider them at fault.

Parly further explained that the introduction of the virus on board the carrier happened sometime between when it left Limassol, Cyprus, on 26 February 2020, and when it arrived at Brest on 13 March 2020. During this time, personnel had been brought on board via air from either Cyprus, Sicily, the Balearic Islands, Spain, or Portugal. The spread of the virus was exacerbated by the stopover at Brest. Social distancing and other measures were taken after the stopover, but they weighed heavily on crew morale, so after enforcing the strict measures for a fortnight, they were relaxed, and a concert on board was authorized for 30 March 2020. Parly also noted that all soldiers aboard &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; have since recovered from the disease except for one sailor, who was still hospitalized after leaving the ICU. Later analysis by physicians at the Military Instruction Hospital Sainte Anne in Toulon found that 60% of &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;″s 1,706 crewmembers were antibody-positive by the end of quarantine.

=== Clemenceau 21 ===
&quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; led the carrier strike group (CSG), as part of the &quot;Clemenceau 21&quot; mission, which set sail on 21 February 2021. The CSG deployed for several months to the Mediterranean Sea, then to the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf and returned to Toulon in June.

From 18 November to 2 December 2021, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; took part in Exercise POLARIS 21 in the western Mediterranean Sea.

=== Clemenceau 22 ===
&quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; set sail on 1 February, leading the French CSG to the Mediterranean as part of Clemenceau 22 from February to April 2022. This CSG consisted of one air defence frigate, &quot;Forbin&quot;; one air defence frigate, ; one anti-submarine frigate, ; one ; and one &quot;Durance&quot;-class replenishment oiler, . The CSG was joined by other three other allies&#x27; ships and one submarine.

=== Clemenceau 25 ===
&quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; departed on 28 November 2024 for Exercise Clemenceau 25. This deployment will see the carrier leading a carrier strike group comprising &quot;Forbin&quot;, a , two &quot;Aquitaine&quot;-class frigates, (&quot;Alsace&quot; for air defence and an anti-submarine warfare frigate, a nuclear-powered attack submarine, the logistics support ship &quot;Jacques Chevallier&quot;, and two support ships. For the exercise, the airwing consisted of two E-2C Hawkeye AEW aircraft, 24 Rafale Marine fighters and four helicopters.

On 4 January 2025, the Carrier Strike Group (CSG) centred on &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; (except &quot;Alsace&quot; and &quot;Forbin&quot;) arrived at Goa and docked in Mormugao Port Trust Jetty. On 5 January, &quot;Alsace&quot; and &quot;Forbin&quot; arrived at Kochi Port. The CSG stayed in India from 3 to 9 January. During this period, the Rafale M aircraft conducted an exercise with the Indian Air Force. Later, on its way of returning from the Pacific Ocean patrol, the CSG will re-visit India and is scheduled to participate in the 42nd edition of Varuna exercise with the Indian Navy.

 joined the CSG during their departure from India for the next phase of the mission in the Indian and Pacific oceans. The ships participated in joint navigational drills and Maritime Partnership Exercise. The drill included combat manoeuvres and cross-deck helicopter deployment with &quot;Forbin&quot; followed by replenishment by &quot;Jacques Chevallier&quot;. Simultaneously, Su-30MKI and Jaguar aircraft of the Indian Air Force also conducted joint anti-aircraft drills with the Rafale Ms of the French Navy.

On 15 January, two Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft landed in Indonesia as part of the mission before exercise La Perouse 2025 after logistical stopovers in Greece, UAE and India (10 Jan). The aircraft traversed 7800 nautical miles and 30 flight hours to complement the CSG.

As part of the mission, the CSG also participated in the fourth edition of the multinational exercise La Perouse 2025. The exercise includes with multiple ships representing eight other navies like Australia (), India (), United Kingdom (), United States (), Indonesia, Malaysia (, KD &quot;Gagah Samudera&quot;), Singapore (RSS &quot;Independence&quot;) and Canada (). The exercise aims to &quot;provide maritime safety with regional partners and multinational coalition assets in the 3 main straits detrimental to commercial shipping&quot; and &quot;sharing information and coordinating their actions against multiple threats thanks to the communication and coordination system IORIS&quot;. The exercise will be conducted in two phases. The first phase (16 to 20 January) focusing on Malacca and Sunda straits and the second one (21 to 24 January) focusing on Lombok Strait.

==Carrier air group==
The carrier air group () operates three squadrons (11F, 12F, 17F) of fifteen Rafale M aircraft each, and one squadron (4f) of three E-2C Hawkeye aircraft:
*Flottille 11F
*Flottille 12F
*Flottille 17F
*Flottille 4F
Typically two Rafale squadrons are expected to rotate in the &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; carrier air group, and a pair of E-2Cs would supplement them. In peacetime, the number of aircraft on board may be lower: 30 (of 40 maximum) Rafale M, 2 E-2C Hawkeye, and 2 (of 4 maximum) AS365 Dauphin helicopters. Although 30 Rafales, divided into two squadrons, are expected to be on board, usually some aircraft remain in France for upgrade or training. US Navy F-18 Hornets and C-2 Greyhounds regularly conduct qualification arrested landings and catapult launches from &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;. In June 2011, two US Navy C-2A(R) Greyhounds were assigned to the French Navy to conduct operational carrier on-board delivery (COD) missions for &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; during the NATO intervention in Libya.

In 2019, &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; operated 35 aircraft during exercises, its record: 2 Dauphin helicopters, 30 Rafale M, 2 E-2C Hawkeye, and 1 NH90 NFH Caiman. In the event of war, the carrier is expected to operate close to its full complement of 40 aircraft. The air group took part in combat operations in Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya.

==French aircraft carrier procurement==
The French Navy aimed to remain a two-carrier navy, mainly to ensure that at least one ship is operational at all times even when the other is under repair. This scheme required another aircraft carrier to be built, but &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; is the only aircraft carrier currently serving.

Cost considerations have made equipment standardization a necessity. In this context, there is a possibility of collaboration with Britain for future aircraft carriers. Thales UK (with BMT) made the design for the suitable for construction for France as the French aircraft carrier PA2. Both countries took steps to make such a scenario possible: The new carrier had to be conventionally propelled to meet the requirements of the Royal Navy. France favoured nuclear propulsion, and a study was conducted to see if it was more cost-efficient than gas turbines. The 2013 French Defence White Paper cancelled the plan for a second carrier.

Following completion of the midlife upgrade, in October 2018 the French armed forces minister announced an 18-month study to determine the requirements for a future carrier. In December 2020, President Macron announced that construction of the New Generation Aircraft Carrier would begin in around 2025 with sea trials to start in about 2036. The carrier is planned to have a displacement of around 75,000 tons and to carry about 32 next-generation fighters, 2 to 3 E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes, and a yet-to-be-determined number of unmanned carrier air vehicles.

<text>Ram Roy Bhaskar (; 15 May 1944 – 19 November 2014) was an English philosopher of science who is best known as the initiator of the philosophical movement of critical realism (CR). Bhaskar argued that the task of science is &quot;the production of the knowledge of those enduring and continually active mechanisms of nature that produce the phenomena of the world&quot;, rather than the discovery of quantitative laws, and that experimental science makes sense only if such mechanisms exist and operate outside the lab as well as inside it.

Roy Bhaskar is certainly the most prominent advocate for &quot;critical realism,&quot; but he did not initiate either the term or the concept. The term was used earlier by Donald Campbell (1974/1988, p. 432), and the concept of combining ontological realism and epistemological constructivism goes back at least to Herbert Blumer (1969). Bhaskar went on to apply that realism about mechanisms and causal powers to the philosophy of social science, and he also elaborated a series of arguments to support the critical role of philosophy and the human sciences. According to Bhaskar, it is possible and desirable for the study of society to be scientific.

Bhaskar was a World Scholar at the Institute of Education, University College London.

==Background==
Bhaskar was born on 15 May 1944 in Teddington, London, the first of two sons. His Indian father and English mother were Theosophists. Bhaskar said his childhood was unhappy, with his father having high expectations of him.

In 1963, Bhaskar attended Balliol College, Oxford, on a scholarship to read philosophy, politics and economics. The scholarship freed him from his father&#x27;s influence over his chosen academic path. Having graduated with first-class honours in 1966, he began work on a PhD thesis about the relevance of economic theory for under-developed countries. His DPhil changed course and was written at Nuffield College, Oxford, where Rom Harré became his supervisor, on the philosophy of social science and then the philosophy of science. His thesis was failed twice, which he believed to be partly for political reasons, but the second version was published largely unchanged in 1975 as his influential text, &quot;A Realist Theory of Science&quot;.

Bhaskar lectured at the University of Edinburgh from 1975 and later moved to the University of Sussex. He held visiting positions in several Scandinavian universities - adjunct professor in philosophy at the Centre for Peace Studies at the University of Tromsø, Norway, and guest professor in philosophy and social science, Department of Caring Sciences, Örebro University, Sweden. From 2007, Bhaskar was employed at the Institute of Education, in London, where he was working on the application of CR to Peace Studies. He was a founding member of the Centre for Critical Realism, International Association for Critical Realism and the International Centre for Critical Realism (2011), the latter at the Institute of Education.

Bhaskar married Hilary Wainwright in 1971. The couple remained close lifelong friends after their separation and never divorced. He died in Leeds with his partner, Rebecca Long, by his side on 19 November 2014.

== Influences ==
Bhaskar himself lists ten main influences on his early work, including philosophical work on the philosophy of science and language; the sociology of knowledge; Marx &quot;and particularly his conception of praxis&quot;; structuralist thinkers including Levi-Strauss, Chomsky and Althusser; the metacritical tradition of Hegel, Kant, and even Descartes; and perspectivalism in the hands of Nietzsche, Fanon, Gramsci and Gandhi.

His dialectical turn engaged more deeply with Hegel, and he called his work in that phase &quot;a non-preservative sublation of Hegelian dialectic&quot; since it draws heavily on Hegel&#x27;s work but moves beyond and improves on it. He also saw it as preserving and building on his own earlier work and on Marx&#x27;s work and claimed that &quot;Marx was a proto-dialectical critical realist&quot; but that there remained residues of Hegelian thought in his work.

He abandoned further work on dialectical critical realism, however, after he experienced transcendental meditation. He turned his attention to a variety of Eastern traditions of philosophy, which were the major influences on his later turn to the philosophy of metareality.

==Critical realism==
Bhaskar&#x27;s consideration of the philosophies of science and social science resulted in the development of critical realism, a philosophical approach that defends the critical and emancipatory potential of rational (scientific and philosophical) enquiry against both positivist, broadly defined, and &#x27;postmodern&#x27; challenges. Its approach emphasises the importance of distinguishing between epistemological and ontological questions and the significance of objectivity properly understood for a critical project. Its conception of philosophy and social science is socially situated but not socially determined; it maintains the possibility for objective critique to motivate social change, with the ultimate end being a promotion of human freedom.

The term &quot;critical realism&quot; was not initially used by Bhaskar. The philosophy began life as what Bhaskar called &quot;transcendental realism&quot; in &quot;A Realist Theory of Science&quot; (1975), which he extended into the social sciences as critical naturalism in &quot;The Possibility of Naturalism&quot; (1978). The term &quot;critical realism&quot; is an elision of transcendental realism and critical naturalism and was accepted by Bhaskar after it had been proposed by others.

Critical Realism should not be confused with various other critical realisms, including Georg Lukács&#x27; aesthetics, and Alister McGrath&#x27;s Scientific Theology (or Theological Critical Realism) although they share common goals. In contemporary critical realist texts, &quot;critical realism&quot; is often abbreviated to CR.

Bhaskar&#x27;s critical realism can be divided into several phases, but he insisted that the later phases preserved and extended the earlier phases of his work, rather than invalidating them. The simplest and most common division is into three phases: original, dialectical, and transcendental. However, original critical realism can also be divided further into transcendental realism and critical naturalism.

== Original critical realism ==
The first &#x27;phase&#x27; of Critical Realism accrued a large number of adherents and proponents in Britain, many of whom were involved with the &quot;Radical Philosophy&quot; Group and related movements. The &quot;Radical Philosophy&quot; journal was where much of the early CR scholarship first appeared. It argued for an objectivist realist approach to science based on a Kantian transcendental analysis of scientific experimental activity. Stressing the need to retain both the subjective epistemological, or &#x27;transitive&#x27;, side of knowledge and the objective ontological, or &#x27;intransitive&#x27;, side, Bhaskar developed a theory of science and social science that he thought would sustain the reality of the objects of science and their knowability but would also incorporate the insights of the &#x27;sociology of knowledge&#x27; movement, which emphasised the theory-laden, historically contingent and socially-situated nature of knowledge.

What emerged was a marriage of ontological realism with epistemological relativism that formed an objectivist yet fallibilist theory of knowledge. Bhaskar&#x27;s main strategy was to argue that reality has depth and that knowledge can penetrate more or less deeply into reality without ever reaching the bottom. Bhaskar said that he reintroduced ontology into the philosophy of science when that was almost heresy. He argued for an ontology of stratified emergence and differentiated structure, which supported the ontological reality of causal powers independent of their empirical effects. Such a move opened up the possibility for a non-reductivist and non-positivistic account of causal explanation in the human and social domain.

That explanatory project was linked with a critical project, the main idea of which is the doctrine of Explanatory Critique. Bhaskar developed it fully in &quot;Scientific Realism and Human Emancipation&quot; (1987), which developed the critical tradition of ideology critique within a CR framework by arguing that certain kinds of explanatory accounts could lead directly to evaluations and so science could function normatively, not just descriptively, as positivism has assumed since Hume&#x27;s law. Such a move, it was hoped, would provide the Holy Grail of critical theory, an objective normative foundation.

== Transcendental realism ==
&#x27;Transcendental realism&#x27; was the term used by Bhaskar to describe the argument that he developed in his first book, &quot;A Realist Theory of Science&quot; (1975). (Not to be confused with F. W. J. Schelling&#x27;s transcendental realism, or Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s transcendental realism.) The position is based on Bhaskar&#x27;s transcendental arguments for certain ontological and epistemological positions based on what reality must be like for scientific knowledge to be possible.

=== Transitive and intransitive domains ===
A &quot;Realist Theory of Science&quot; starts with a proposed paradox: how do people create knowledge as a product of social activities since knowledge is of things that are not at all produced by people?

The former is inspired by Kuhnian arguments of how scientific communities develop knowledge and asserts all observation is theory-laden based on previously acquired concepts. As such, it is not a naïve realist perspective of knowledge being a direct acquisition of facts through observation of the real world, but it rather considers knowledge to be fallible. That aspect of knowledge is described as the &quot;transitive domain of knowledge&quot; in that knowledge can change over time.

The second part of the paradox is asserted to be based on a real world, which exists and behaves in the same manner regardless of whether or not people exist or whether they know about the real world. That is described as the &quot;intransitive objects of knowledge&quot;.

Bhaskar refers to the elimination of the intransitive objects of knowledge and thus the reduction of ontology to epistemology as the &quot;epistemic fallacy&quot;, which Bhaskar asserts has been made repeatedly over the last 300 years of philosophy of science. The epistemic fallacy &quot;consists in the view that statements about being can be reduced to or analysed in terms of statements about knowledge&quot;.

=== Transcendental argument from experimental science ===
The core argument of &quot;A Realist Theory of Science&quot; begins as a critique of positivist/empiricist understandings of how science works. Bhaskar focuses on the empiricist argument that science produces true knowledge of invariant causal laws by observing causal regularities: &quot;a constant conjunction of events perceived&quot;. Bhaskar develops what he calls an immanent critique of empiricism in which he takes some of its core assumptions as correct for the purpose of the argument and then shows that to lead to an incoherence in the empiricist argument. In particular, he accepts the premise that experimental science produces useful knowledge (although he does not commit himself to the claim that the knowledge that it produces is true) and then asks what the world must be like if that is the case. In that sense, his arguments take a similar form to Kant&#x27;s transcendental arguments, a term that he employs to describe them.

He argues that experimental science is necessary only when and because &quot;the pattern of events forthcoming under experimental conditions would not be forthcoming without it&quot;. In experiments, scientists manipulate the conditions to exclude some causal factors so that they can focus on others. Any causal regularity observed is then in part the product of their activity, which is necessary only because the causal regularities do not occur consistently in the outside world, which Bhaskar calls &quot;open systems&quot;. The regularities are therefore not constant conjunctions in the sense required by empiricism. They are however believed to produce useful knowledge of how the world works, and in particular, scientists form beliefs about how the world outside the laboratory works on the basis of their experiment; however, scientists know that outside the laboratory, the constant conjunctions do not occur. Indeed, doing experimental science makes sense only if it tells us something useful about what occurs beyond the laboratory.

What experimental scientists are learning about, therefore, cannot be causal laws, which are understood as invariant patterns of events. Instead, Bhaskar argues that they are learning about causal mechanisms, which operate as tendencies in the sense that they tend to but do not always bring about certain outcomes. They may operate only under certain conditions, or they may be obstructed by other causal mechanisms since multiple mechanisms interact to produce any given event. The role of experimental scientists is to prevent such obstructions to allow the isolation of a particular mechanism. Mechanisms, or &quot;generative mechanisms&quot;, as he often calls them, are in turn properties of things (objects), and he usually identifies them as well with the &quot;causal powers&quot; of those things.

=== Real, actual and empirical domains ===
On that basis, Bhaskar argues that the world can be divided into nested domains of the &quot;real&quot;, the &quot;actual&quot; and the &quot;empirical&quot;. 

The &quot;empirical&quot; contains the events that people actually experience. It is a subset of the &quot;actual&quot;, the full set of events that actually occur, regardless of whether or not people are aware of them. That, in turn, is a subset of the &quot;real&quot; which includes objects, their structures and their causal powers as well. It is important to note that the objects and structures may be able to exert certain causal powers, but the powers may not affect a given situation if the triggering conditions are not present, and even if they are triggered, their characteristic effects may not be actualized if other causal powers obstruct them. The error of empiricism, then, is to build its ontology purely on the category of experience and thus to collapse all three domains into one.

=== Stratification and emergence ===
For Bhaskar, the causal powers of things depend on their structure as complex objects. They are emergent in the sense that they are properties of the whole that appear only as a result of the parts being structured as they are in this type of whole. As Collier explains in his book on Bhaskar&#x27;s critical realism, that leads to a view of wholes as composed of parts, which are themselves wholes with their own emergent powers. Reality is thus stratified in two senses: in the sense implicit in the division between the empirical, the actual and the real and also in the sense that it consists of things composed of parts that are themselves things at a lower level of stratification.

The relationships between objects and the combinations of their causal powers may create entirely new structures with new causal powers. A typical example is water, which has a causal power of extinguishing fire, but it is made up of hydrogen and oxygen that have causal powers of combustion. That stratification spans in all sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, sociology etc. That implies that objects in sociology (labour markets, capitalism etc.) are just as real as those in physics. The position is not reductionist: each stratum depends on the objects and their relationships in the strata below it, but the difference in causal powers means that they are necessarily different objects.

== Critical naturalism==
Critical naturalism is the term that Bhaskar used to describe the argument that he develops in his second book &quot;The Possibility of Naturalism&quot; (1979). He defines naturalism as the view that &quot;social objects can be studied in essentially the same way as natural ones, that is, &#x27;scientifically&#x27;&quot;. On one hand, Bhaskar argues for naturalism in the sense that the transcendental realist model of science is equally applicable to both the physical and the human worlds. On the other hand, however, he argues that studying the human world is studying something fundamentally different from the physical world and so the strategy to study it must be adapted. Critical naturalism, therefore, implies social scientific methods that seek to identify the mechanisms producing social events but with a recognition that they are in a much greater state of flux than events of the physical world (human structures change much more readily than those of, say, a leaf). In particular, it must be understood that human agency is made possible by social structures that themselves require the reproduction of certain actions/preconditions. Further, the individuals that inhabit the social structures are capable of consciously reflecting upon and changing the actions that produce them, a practice that is in part facilitated by social scientific research.

=== Transformational model of social activity (TMSA) ===

Bhaskar rejects the methodological individualist doctrine that social events can be explained purely in terms of facts about individual persons, but accepts that society has no other material presence than persons and the products of their actions. Equally, he rejects the collectivist notion, which he associated with Émile Durkheim, that reifies social groups and explains the social in terms of the influence of groups to the exclusion of the influence of persons. In fact, Durkheim does not reject psychology &quot;in toto&quot;. Durkheim spends two chapters of &quot;Suicide&quot; on psychological explanations of suicide. Durkheim&#x27;s real position is that not only psychology but also social facts play a role in explaining suicide rates. Instead, Bhaskar argues for an iterative relation between people and society, which he understands as &quot;an ensemble of structures, practices and conventions&quot;. People never create society from scratch because it always pre-exists them and provides the context in which they act, but society depends on human activity for its reproduction and/or transformation over time. Society is thus a necessary condition of human action and influences it, but human action is in turn a necessary condition of society, which it continually shapes and reshapes. Bhaskar initially saw the work of Anthony Giddens on duality of structure as consistent with the TMSA, but he later accepted the critique of Giddens by Margaret Archer, who argued that Giddens conflated structure and agency. Archer&#x27;s own concept of the morphogenetic cycle, which was developed independently, is remarkably similar to the TMSA. That led to both working together under the banner of critical realism.

=== Social structures ===
Bhaskar sees social structures as having emergent properties on the same model as structures in the natural world. However, he enumerates three key differences between social and natural structures, which affect both how they may behave and how they may be studied. Firstly, as described in the TMSA, they &quot;do not exist independently of the activities they govern&quot;, which implies that they cannot be empirically identified independently of those activities. Secondly, they depend on &quot;agents&#x27; conceptions of what they are doing&quot;, which gives a somewhat constructionist understanding of social structures and their dependence on human beliefs and thus the potentials for transforming them. Thirdly, that dependency on beliefs tends to make them less enduring and more easily transformed than natural structures.

=== Agency ===
Bhaskar understands human beings primarily as material beings who have the capacity of intentional action as an emergent consequence of their neurophysiological complexity. On that basis, he rejects reductionist explanations of human action as determined purely physiologically, and he argues instead for what he calls &quot;synchronic emergent powers materialism&quot;. He concludes, &quot;The powers associated with the mind are both real, that is, causally efficacious... and irreducible, that is, emergent from matter&quot;. That enables him to argue that reasons can be causes of human behaviour since reasons are examples of emergent mental powers, which entails that humans can explain human action (at least partly) in terms of intentionality.

=== Explanatory critique and ethical naturalism ===
One of the core themes of Bhaskar&#x27;s work, which he returns to several times across its different phases, is that philosophical arguments can be provided to support sociopolitical critique. His first attempt to provide such support comes in the form of the concept of explanatory critique, which was first introduced in &quot;The Possibility of Naturalism&quot; but developed more fully in &quot;Scientific Realism and Human Emancipation&quot; (1987). His argument is that if other things are equal, if something (S) is responsible for producing a false belief, one may proceed to a negative ethical evaluation of S and to a positive evaluation of action directed at its removal. It helps to explain the argument to think of it as related to Marxist ideology critique in which S is some sort of social structure, say capitalism, that produces false beliefs (ideology) but in which the basis of the critical response is not the harms caused by capitalism but that it misleads people about its true nature. The importance of that argument, Bhaskar suggests, is that it underpins the critical potential of the human sciences since they can provide a basis for political action by revealing the falsity of beliefs and their sources.

Bhaskar later extends the argument from that cognitive form of explanatory critique, which argues that the sources of false knowledge should be removed, to a needs-based form, which applies a similar argument to sources of failures to meet human needs. In terms of the previous example, that would be like arguing that capitalism should be removed because it causes human suffering, rather than because it misleads people.

Bhaskar claims that argument refutes what is sometimes known as &#x27;Hume&#x27;s Law&#x27;: the claim that an ethical conclusion cannot be derived from purely-factual premises. Indeed, he argues that as long as a belief is known to be false, there is sufficient grounds for a negative evaluation of it and for action directed at its removal. That, on his account, provides sufficient grounds for ethical naturalism, the belief that ethical conclusions can be derived from purely-factual premises, which also seems to entail moral realism, the belief that some ethical claims are objectively correct.

== Dialectical critical realism ==
The second phase of Critical Realism, the dialectic turn initiated in &quot;Dialectic: the Pulse of Freedom&quot; (1993) and developed further in &quot;Plato, etc&quot; (1994), won some new adherents but drew criticism from some critical realists. It argued for the &#x27;dialecticising&#x27; of CR, by an elaborate reading of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx. Arguing against Hegel and with Marx that dialectical connections, relations and contradictions are themselves ontological (objectively real), Bhaskar developed a concept of real absence, which he claimed could provide a more robust foundation for the reality and the objectivity of values and criticism. He attempted to incorporate critical rational human agency into the dialectic figure with his &#x27;Fourth Dimension&#x27; of dialectic, which would ground a systematic model for rational emancipatory transformative practice.

== Transcendental dialectical critical realism ==
In 2000, Bhaskar published &quot;From East to West: The Odyssey of a Soul&quot; in which he first expressed ideas related to spiritual values that came to be seen as the beginning of his so-called &#x27;spiritual&#x27; turn, which led to the final phase of critical realism, dubbed &#x27;Transcendental Dialectical Critical Realism&#x27;. That publication and the ones that followed it were highly controversial and led to something of a split among Bhaskar&#x27;s proponents. Some respected Critical Realists cautiously supported Bhaskar&#x27;s &#x27;spiritual turn&#x27;, but others took the view that the development had compromised the status of critical realism as a serious philosophical movement.

In his &quot;Reflections on Meta-Reality&quot;, he describes meta-reality as &quot;a new philosophical standpoint&quot;. The main departure, it seems, is an emphasis on the shift away from Western dualism to a non-dual model in which emancipation entails &quot;a breakdown, an overcoming, of the duality and separateness between things.&quot; Jamie Morgan&#x27;s paper &#x27;What is Meta-Reality&#x27; provides a very clear introduction to that phase of Bhaskar&#x27;s work.

== Politics ==
Bhaskar&#x27;s programme was intensely political. He thought of it as &quot;underlabouring&quot; for the work done in the human sciences in pursuit of &quot;the project of human self-emancipation&quot;. One of the threads that unites the different phases of his work is a continuing commitment to providing philosophical support for emancipatory politics.

He is sometimes described as a Marxist thinker, but his relationship to Marxism was ambivalent. In a debate with Bhaskar, a well-known Marxist, Alex Callinicos, identified him as &quot;a significant contributor to contemporary Marxist thought, broadly understood&quot;. In the same discussion, Bhaskar endorsed some key elements of Marx&#x27;s thought, including his explanatory account of the deep structures of the capitalist mode of production. Bhaskar clearly admired Marx as a philosopher of emancipation and both drew on and built on aspects of that work, at least up to and including the period of dialectical critical realism.

However, during the same debate with Callinicos, Bhaskar referred to &quot;The Marxists&quot;, as if the term did not include himself, and criticised them for neglecting the role of women in domestic labour. When he pinned his colours to a political flag, it was the more general flag of socialism. Despite his endorsement in the debate with Callinicos, he rarely paid much attention to the less philosophical aspects of Marx&#x27;s work, including political economy and class politics. It might be fairer to see Bhaskar&#x27;s work as intersecting with the Marxist tradition, rather than as being part of it. His work relates to politics primarily at a philosophical level. He rarely involved himself with questions of practical politics, with the exception of his late collaborative work on climate change.

==Criticism==
=== Transcendental realism ===
Criticisms have been levelled at the substance of Bhaskar&#x27;s arguments at various points.

One objection, raised by Callinicos and others, is that Bhaskar&#x27;s so-called &quot;transcendental arguments&quot; are not really that. They are not typical transcendental arguments as philosophers such as Charles Taylor have defined them, the distinguishing feature of which is the identification of some putative condition on the possibility of experience. (However, his arguments function in an analogous way since they try to argue that scientific practice would be unintelligible and/or inexplicable in the absence of the ontological features he identifies.)

On the other hand, some critics have taken Bhaskar at his word by criticising his use of transcendental arguments on the grounds that the term suggests (because of its usage by Kant) that such arguments provide foundational conclusions with absolute certainty, but Bhaskar elsewhere advocated a fallibilist view of knowledge. Bhaskar, however, repeatedly clarified that &quot;transcendental realism is fallible, as corrigible as the outcome of any other piece of human argument&quot;.

Bhaskar&#x27;s claim that the theory of explanatory critique justifies ethical naturalism and/or moral realism has also been criticised, including by other critical realists, as committing the naturalistic fallacy. Martyn Hammersley argues, for example, that the needs-based version of explanatory critique smuggles a value premise into the supposedly purely-factual premises of the argument because the concept of need already carries an ethical implication that the need should be met. Similarly, Dave Elder-Vass argues that the cognitive version of explanatory critique rests on the ethical premise that false knowledge is a bad thing. If Bhaskar&#x27;s argument rests on ethical premises like either of these, then it fails to provide examples of the derivation of ethical conclusions from purely-factual premises, which would appear to disprove his claim that the theory of explanatory critique provides a justification for ethical naturalism.

=== Dialectical critical realism ===
His early books were considered &quot;models of clarity and rigour&quot;, but Bhaskar has been criticised for the &quot;truly appalling style&quot; (Alex Callinicos, 1994) in which his &quot;dialectical&quot; works were written. He won the Bad Writing Contest in 1996, for a passage taken from &quot;Plato etc.&quot; (1994).

Bhaskar&#x27;s concept of real absence has been questioned by some like Andrew Collier, who argues that it fails to distinguish properly between real and nominal absences.

=== Transcendental dialectical critical realism ===
Bhaskar&#x27;s most recent &#x27;spiritual&#x27; phase has been criticised by many adherents of early critical realism for departing from the fundamental positions that had made it important and interesting without providing philosophical support for his new ideas. Jamie Morgan&#x27;s summary of meta-reality provides a number of careful challenges to Bhaskar&#x27;s argument.

<text>Lance James Henriksen (born May 5, 1940) is an American actor. He is known for his roles in various science fiction, action and horror genre productions, including Bishop in the &quot;Alien&quot; film franchise and Frank Black in the Fox television series &quot;Millennium&quot; (1996–99) and &quot;The X-Files&quot; (1999). 

He has also done extensive voice work, including the Disney film &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999) and the video games &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot; (2009) and BioWare&#x27;s &quot;Mass Effect&quot; trilogy (2007–2012). Other film credits include &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983), &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), &quot;Hard Target&quot; (1993), &quot;Color of Night&quot; (1994), &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; (1995), &quot;Powder&quot; (1995), &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000), &quot;Appaloosa&quot; (2008), and &quot;Falling&quot; (2020).

Henriksen was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards for his role on &quot;Millenium,&quot; and won a Saturn Award (out of four total nominations) for his performance in &quot;Hard Target&quot;. In 2021, he was nominated for a Canadian Screen Award for Best Actor for &quot;Falling&quot;.

== Early life ==
Henriksen was born on May 5, 1940, in Manhattan, New York. His father, James Henriksen, was a Norwegian merchant sailor and boxer nicknamed &quot;Icewater&quot; who spent most of his life at sea, while his mother, Margueritte Werner, struggled to find work as a dance instructor, waitress and model. Henriksen&#x27;s paternal grandmother was a Sámi reindeer herder. His parents divorced when he was two years old, and his mother struggled to raise him and his brother Walter, leading to his spending part of his childhood in foster care. During an interview, Henriksen recounted how, at the age of seven, his mother handed him his birth certificate and said, &quot;You&#x27;ll always know who you are&quot;, then pushed him out of his home. Henriksen did not actually leave home until he was 12, saying he&#x27;d &quot;had enough&quot; of his home life, and that he had been physically assaulted by multiple family members: &quot;I got bludgeoned a lot. Different people, relatives. I remember every single face from my childhood. My alcoholic uncles, whoever. I&#x27;m not having a pity party here; I&#x27;m not Quasimodo. That&#x27;s just how it was&quot;. On another occasion, two of his uncles tried to persuade him to take Methadrine and then take part in a staged car accident for the insurance money.

Growing up, Henriksen had a reputation for getting into trouble in the various schools he attended, and even spent time in a children&#x27;s home. He left school after completing first grade, and was illiterate until the age of 30. Henriksen served in the U.S. Navy, attaining the rank of Petty Officer Third Class. He later served with the U.S. Merchant Marine.

== Career ==
Henriksen found work as a muralist and as a laborer on ships. For a time, he worked in Europe. Around age 30, he found theater work as a set designer, and he received his first acting role because he built the set for a production. It was around this time that he taught himself to read. For his first role, he put the entire script on tape with the help of a friend, then learned his part and all of the others. Soon afterward, he graduated from the Actors Studio and began acting in New York City.

Henriksen&#x27;s first film appearance was in &quot;The Outsider&quot; in 1961, as an uncredited extra. He received his first credit in his second film, 1972&#x27;s &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy.&quot; He auditioned for the role of Leon Shermer in &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; (1975), but received the smaller part of an FBI agent that kills John Cazale&#x27;s character. He would appear in two more films directed by Sidney Lumet: &quot;Network&quot; (1976) and &quot;Prince of the City&quot; (1981). In a 2009 interview, Henriksen called Lumet &quot;the kind of guy that loves New York actors, because that’s where he works and that’s what he knows...He would give you the job that was maybe only meant for four days, and he’d give you the run of the show because he wanted to help support young actors in New York.&quot; 

Henriksen had supporting roles in a variety of films, including the science-fiction film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977) and the horror film &quot;Damien - Omen II&quot; (1978). He also had a co-starring role in the low-budget horror film &quot;Mansion of the Doomed&quot; (1976). He played Police Chief Steve Kimbrough in &quot;Piranha Part Two: The Spawning&quot; (1982), the astronaut Walter Schirra in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983), and actor Charles Bronson in the television film &quot;Reason for Living: The Jill Ireland Story&quot; (1991).

When James Cameron was writing &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), he originally envisioned Henriksen, with whom he had worked on &quot;Piranha II&quot;, as playing the title role, a cyborg. The role ultimately went to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Henriksen does appear in the film as Hal Vukovich, a Detective in the Los Angeles Police Department.

Henriksen played the android Bishop in Cameron&#x27;s film &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), and as Bishop&#x27;s designer Michael Weyland in &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992). He also played Charles Bishop Weyland, the man upon whom Bishop was based, in &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004). Bill Paxton and Henriksen are the only actors whose characters were killed by the Terminator, the Alien, and the Predator. He played the vampire leader Jesse Hooker in Kathryn Bigelow&#x27;s cult film &quot;Near Dark&quot;.

He portrayed gunfighters in the Westerns &quot;Dead Man&quot; and &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot;, and appeared with British actor Bruce Payne in &quot;&quot; in 1995. That year, he also played Sheriff Doug Barnum in the film &quot;Powder&quot;. He appeared with Payne again in &quot;Face the Evil&quot; (1997), and the dystopian classic &quot;Paranoia 1.0&quot; (2004).

In 1996, Henriksen starred in the television series &quot;Millennium&quot;, created and produced by Chris Carter, the creator of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Henriksen played Frank Black, a former FBI agent who possessed a unique ability to see into the minds of killers. Carter created the role specifically for the actor. His performances on &quot;Millennium&quot; earned him critical acclaim, a People&#x27;s Choice Award nomination for Favorite New Male TV Star, and three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series (1997–1999). The series was cancelled in 1999. On television, Henriksen appeared in the ensemble of &quot;Into the West&quot; (2005), a miniseries executive-produced by Steven Spielberg. He appeared in a Brazilian soap opera, &quot;Caminhos do Coração&quot; (&quot;Ways of the Heart&quot;) from Rede Record, aired in 2007–2008. Henriksen guest-starred on a Season 6 episode of &quot;NCIS&quot; (2009) playing an Arizona sheriff, and appeared in a recurring role as The Major on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Blacklist&quot;.

In the years after &quot;Millennium&quot;, Henriksen has become an active voice actor, lending his distinctive voice to a number of animated features and video game titles. In Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999) and its direct-to-video followup, he is Kerchak, the ape who serves as Tarzan&#x27;s surrogate father. He provided the voice for the alien supervillain Brainiac in &quot;&quot; (2006) and for the character Mulciber in &quot;Godkiller&quot; (2009). Henriksen is the voice of the character Molov in the video game &quot;Red Faction II&quot; (2002) and has also contributed to &quot;GUN&quot; (2005), &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; (2002), the canceled title &quot;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; (2004), and the role-playing game &quot;Mass Effect&quot; (2007) as Admiral Hackett of the Human Systems Alliance. Henriksen was also the voice behind PlayStation 3&#x27;s internet promotional videos.

In 2005, Henriksen was the voice of Andrei Rublev in Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;IGPX&quot;. The actor lent his voice to the animated television series &quot;&quot; as the character Lockdown. In 2009, Henriksen voiced Lieutenant General Shepherd in the award-winning game &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;. He would later voice Karl Bishop Weyland in &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot;; also, this character&#x27;s appearance resembles Henriksen&#x27;s. Henriksen voiced Master Gnost-Dural in &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;, and he also reprised his role as Admiral Hackett in &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot;. Henriksen reprised his role as Bishop in &quot;&quot;.

He starred in a 2003 series of Australian television commercials for Visa, titled &quot;Unexplained&quot; (about the raining of fish from the sky over Norfolk) and &quot;Big Cats&quot; (about the Beast of Bodmin Moor). In these commercials, Henriksen speaks as a Frank Black-type character about these phenomena as Mark Snow-inspired mysterious music plays in the background, as a link to Henriksen&#x27;s TV series &quot;Millennium&quot;. &quot;Unexplained&quot; went on to a gold world medal at the 2004 New York Festivals.

He made a cameo appearance in the 2009 horror comedy &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Body&quot;, and starred in the After Dark Horrorfest film, &quot;Scream of the Banshee&quot;, released in 2011. He played Henry Gale in Leigh Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Witches of Oz&quot;.

In January 2015, he was signed for the lead in the indie thriller &quot;Monday at 11:01 A.M.&quot; In 2016, he starred in the feature film &quot;Deserted&quot;, a psychological thriller. Henriksen played the role of Hopper.

In 2018, Henriksen performed motion capture and vocal performance for the character of Carl Manfred in the video game &quot;&quot;. The game&#x27;s plot involves androids gaining sentience and free will, topics explored briefly with Henriksen&#x27;s Bishop character in &quot;Aliens&quot;.

In October 2018, Henriksen was signed for one of the two leads in &quot;Falling&quot;, the directorial debut of actor Viggo Mortensen, who also wrote, produced and co-starred. Reviewing the film&#x27;s 2020 premiere, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s John DeFore noted not only the quality of Henriksen&#x27;s performance, but the opportunity Mortensen&#x27;s script presented: &quot;[F]ew moviegoers who&#x27;ve enjoyed him over the years will be surprised, but many will resent that we, and he, have waited so long for a role like this.&quot;

He received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Actor at the 9th Canadian Screen Awards in 2021, for his performance in &quot;Falling&quot;.

In 2022, Henriksen was cast in the upcoming American horror film, &quot;Awaken the Reaper&quot;. The film is currently shooting in New York and slated for a 2024 release date. It is directed by Justin Paul and Dave Campfield and produced by Fourth Horizon Cinema, Impact Media Studios and Design Weapons.

Henriksen has five children; three with Pollack, one with Lunde, and a daughter, Monique, with Joan Bottinelli, born 1964. Henriksen currently resides in Tumwater, Washington.

===Art===
Henriksen continues to produce art. He worked as a muralist before he became an actor, and he has worked with clay since 1960. In September 2017, Henriksen set up a website to showcase and find homes for some of his most recent clay works. He &quot;still believes that there is nothing as simple and beautiful as raw clay... And that Potters have the remaining soul of the nomads...always searching...&quot;

<text>Wunda is a large crater on the surface of Uranus&#x27; moon Umbriel. It is 131 km in diameter and is located near the equator of Umbriel. The crater is named after &quot;Wunda&quot;, a dark spirit of Australian aboriginal mythology.

Wunda has a prominent albedo feature on its floor, which takes the shape of a ring of bright material at least 10 km in radial width. The reason for its brightness, which stands out from the very dark composition of the moon as a whole, is unknown. It may be either a fresh impact deposit or a deposit of carbon dioxide ice, which formed when the radiolytically formed carbon dioxide migrated from all over the surface of Umbriel and got trapped inside relatively cold Wunda.

<text>LocoScript is a word processing software package created by Locomotive Software and first released with the Amstrad PCW, a personal computer launched in 1985. Early versions of LocoScript were noted for combining a wide range of facilities with outstanding ease of use. This and the low price of the hardware made it one of the best-selling word processors of the late 1980s. Four major versions of LocoScript were published for the PCW, and two for IBM-compatible PCs running MS-DOS. LocoScript&#x27;s market share didn&#x27;t expand with the PC versions, which were not released until after Windows had become the dominant PC operating system.

==Background and reception==
LocoScript&#x27;s developers, Locomotive Software, had produced Locomotive BASIC for Amstrad&#x27;s CPC 464 home computer, introduced in 1984. For the Amstrad PCW, introduced in 1985, Locomotive produced the LocoScript word processor and Mallard BASIC, and also wrote the PCW&#x27;s User Guide. These programs and a dot matrix printer were included in the price of the PCW, which was £399 plus VAT for the base model. The PCW, regarded as extremely good value for money, gained 60% of the UK home computer market, and 20% of the European personal computer market. According to &quot;Personal Computer World&quot;, the PCW &quot;got the technophobes using computers&quot;.

LocoScript was regarded as easier to use than Wordstar and WordPerfect, which in the mid-1980s were the dominant word processors on IBM-compatible PCs, and many users needed no additional information beyond what the manual&#x27;s &quot;first 20 minutes&quot; introductory chapter provided. The PCW&#x27;s keyboard offered clearly labelled, one-press special keys for many common LocoScript functions, including cut, copy, and paste, while LocoScript&#x27;s competitors required a wide range of key combinations that the user had to remember. Most of the program&#x27;s other features were presented via a pull-down menu bar in which the top-level options were activated by function keys. The menu system had two structures, one for beginners and the other for experienced users. Locomotive Software&#x27;s slogan for the product was &quot;Everything you need, nothing you don&#x27;t.&quot; However, LocoScript version 1 was regarded as relatively slow.

When the PCW product line was discontinued in 1998, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said that the range of independently produced add-on software for LocoScript had contributed to the series&#x27; longevity.

LocoScript faded into obscurity because its developers were slow to produce a version for IBM-compatible PCs. By the time they released a version that ran under MS-DOS, Windows was becoming the dominant operating system. The developers of WordPerfect made a similar mistake, releasing their first Windows version in 1991, shortly after the second Windows version of Microsoft Word.

As late as 1993, a journalist found &quot;special characters&quot; much easier to produce on LocoScript than on PC word processing software.

==Versions and capabilities==

===LocoScript===
LocoScript was the principal software included with Amstrad&#x27;s PCW 8256 and PCW 8512, both of which launched in 1985. LocoScript did not run under the control of an operating system; instead, the computer was booted from the LocoScript floppy disk, and LocoScript ran exclusively on the system. The user had to reboot in order to run any other program (a variety of CP/M applications were supplied on a separate disk). In later years a third-party utility called &quot;Flipper&quot; eventually became available, restricted to those PCWs with the greatest RAM memory, which could divide the bigger memory between LocoScript and CP/M, allowing both to run without the need to reboot.

On start-up LocoScript displayed a file management menu, like WordStar but unlike WordPerfect, Microsoft Word and other modern word processors, which start with an empty document. LocoScript enabled users to divide documents into groups, display all the groups on a disk and then the documents in the selected group, and set up a template for each group. File names were restricted to the &quot;8.3&quot; format, but the edit facilities enabled users to add summaries up to 90 characters long, which they could display from the file menu. The &quot;limbo file&quot; facility enabled users to recover accidentally deleted documents until the disk ran out of space (there was no hard disk, all files were stored on floppy disks), when the software would permanently delete files from &quot;limbo&quot; to make room for new ones. Journalist Dave Langford published a collection of his articles about the PCW, and titled it &quot;The Limbo Files&quot;. LocoScript was designed to accommodate add-on programs, which could be selected via the file manager.

LocoScript supported 150 characters. For each language supported by the PCW, the keyboard and LocoScript were configured so that users could easily type all of the normal character set. Various other languages&#x27; characters could be typed by holding down the ALT or EXTRA key, along with the SHIFT key if capitals were required. LocoScript could also display mathematical and technical symbols. All these characters and symbols could be printed, unless the printer was a daisy wheel unit.

LocoScript&#x27;s menu system enabled users to add, singly or in combination, a range of sophisticated typographical effects: monospaced or proportional character spacing; normal or double width characters and spacing; various font sizes; bold, underline, italics, subscript or superscript, and reverse video. All of these except those that affected font size and spacing were displayed on the screen. Reverse video was an on-screen reminder to the user and was never printed, while the other effects were printed, except on daisy wheel printers.

Users could optionally set up to two page headers and footers, and could tell LocoScript whether to use one header or footer on odd pages and the other on even pages, one header or footer for the first or last page and another for all the rest, or to omit a header or footer on the first or last page. The program provided codes for the current page number and total number of pages, and aligning them to the left, centre, or right, and for decorations such as leading and trailing hyphens (e.g. &quot;-9-&quot;). LocoScript automatically avoided widows and orphans, ensuring that, if a paragraph of four or more lines split across pages, at least two lines appeared on each page. Users could also tell LocoScript to keep a group of lines or paragraphs together on the same page, or to avoid splitting paragraphs throughout a document, and could force page breaks.

Users could control placement of text by means of: margins; indentation; normal tab stops; decimal tab stops, which set the position of the decimal point rather than the start of a number; and left, right or full justification. Different combinations of these settings, called &quot;layouts&quot;, were automatically numbered, which made it possible to re-use layouts and to make changes that applied to all parts of a document where a specified layout was used. These facilities could be used for presenting tables.

LocoScript&#x27;s cut, copy and paste facility provided 10 paste buffers (&quot;blocks&quot;), each of which was designated by a number and could be saved for re-use in a different document. Users could also save up to 26 short phrases, identified by letters, although the size of individual phrases and of the whole collection of phrases was limited. Both phrases and paste blocks could be inspected via a menu option. In addition, users could insert whole files, which could be either LocoScript documents or ASCII text files. The &quot;find&quot; and &quot;find and replace&quot; facilities could operate on a whole document, or small sections of one, and &quot;find and replace&quot; (&quot;exchange&quot; in the manual&#x27;s terminology) had an option to confirm each change or just go ahead.

The program did not immediately reflow text after major insertions or deletions, but did this when the user pressed the RELAY key, or automatically if the user moved the cursor through the changed passage.

LocoScript allowed the user to edit one document while printing another, so that the relative slowness of the bundled dot matrix printer seldom caused difficulties. Users could ask for all of a document to be printed or a range of pages, set the print quality to &quot;high quality&quot; or &quot;draft&quot;, and set the paper used to single-sheet or continuous stationery. LocoScript automatically adjusted the size of margins so that the same number of lines per page appeared on both single-sheet and continuous stationery. Since the printer only accepted one sheet of single-sheet paper at a time, LocoScript displayed a prompt at the end of each page when in single-sheet mode. The program also had the ability to resume at a specified page after a paper jam. In addition to printing LocoScript documents, the program had a &quot;direct printing&quot; mode which operated like a typewriter, printing each piece of text after the user pressed RETURN. This could be used for completing forms.

The original LocoScript version 1 had no spell checker or mail merge facilities. Both were available by December 1986.
Despite the sophistication of the software, the great drawback of the PCWs was the exclusive reliance of the early models (the PCW 8256 and 8512) on a poor quality dot matrix printer, coupled with the eventual introduction (with the 9512) of a high quality daisy wheel printer that could &quot;not&quot; print any of the wide range of non-alphanumeric symbols which the LocoScript software was capable of producing. The software was seriously hamstrung by the poor quality of the hardware: but this was due in large part to a commercial decision not to provide any support for third-party printers so long as the software remained exclusive to the PCW format.

===LocoScript 2===
LocoScript 2 was bundled with the Amstrad PCW 9512, introduced in 1987. This version was significantly faster, included the LocoSpell spell checker, and came bundled with a high-quality daisy wheel printer in addition to supporting the original dot matrix printer. The software increased its character set to 400 and allowed users to define up to 16 of their own characters.

It could also format, copy and verify disks by itself, instead of requiring the user to switch to CP/M and use the Disc Kit utility. Copying via LocoScript, however, could be much slower. Due to the word processor occupying more RAM than the CP/M system, and so leaving less usable space on the RAM disk, copying had to be done in smaller, more numerous stages.

Besides the addition of LocoSpell, LocoScript 2 was also the earliest version to support the optional LocoFile add-on, providing database functionality. 

===LocoScript PC===
LocoScript PC, later known as LocoScript PC Easy, was the first version of LocoScript to be incompatible with the Amstrad PCW, instead targeting IBM-compatible PCs running MS-DOS 3.0 and above. Released in 1990, the program&#x27;s feature set was largely inline with LocoScript 2, supporting LocoSpell, LocoMail, and LocoFile, while also adding a few new features, such as support for mixing text with different fonts and new text styling options, as well as a substantially increased range of compatible third-party printers.

===LocoScript Professional===
Released in May 1992, LocoScript Professional, or simply Script, was the second major release of LocoScript to run on MS-DOS and included a number of new features and improvements over LocoScript PC.

It supported printers that connected using the then-standard parallel port, such as most HP DeskJets and some Brother HL-series Laser printers (which could be run under DOS using the generic LaserJet4 driver). It did not support printers which required a USB connection or which were labelled &quot;Windows only&quot;.

Some issues exist as to its compatibility with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 (when run on those systems&#x27; DOS mode or using the DOSBox emulator). For example, it loses WYSIWYG functionality. However, version 2.51 can be tweaked to work in Windows 10 under DOSbox MB6 {Set in LocoScript by selecting F9-Settings-F5-ScreenMode-Text Screen Direct-OK F10} (DOSBox MB6 maintains printing via the parallel printer port, running in &quot;text screen&quot; mode).

===LocoScript 3===
LocoScript 3 included the ability to print text at any size using scalable &quot;LX&quot; fonts, and to use multiple fonts in a document. According to the vendor, LocoScript 3 also had the ability to include pictures and draw boxes within documents, a facility to print odd-numbered and even-numbered pages separately, and a word counter. The vendor recommended LocoScript 3 only for use with PCW models that had 512 KB of RAM. 

Four add-on utilities were included: LocoSpell (a spell checker), LocoMail (a mail merge program), LocoFile (a database program), and a Printer Support Pack, but (unlike in the earlier LocoScript versions) these utilities were no longer sold separately.

===LocoScript 4===
The last major version of LocoScript for the PCW, LocoScript 4, was released in 1996 by LocoScript Software, a new company created by former Locomotive Software employees after the sale of Locomotive to Demon Internet. It added a wider range of fonts, support for colour printing, a label-printing facility, and optional support for hundreds of printers. Version 4 also supported the mail merge program, LocoMail, and the LocoFile database program.

<text>The bes (: besses) was an Ancient Roman bronze coin produced during the Roman Republic. Valued at two thirds of an as (eight unciae), it was only produced in 126 BC by C. Cassius in combination with the dodrans, another very rare denomination which was valued at three quarters of an as (nine unciae). The obverse head displayed the god Liber facing to the right.

<doc id="639170" wikidata="Q378426" url="?curid=639170" title="Diplomatics">
<text>Diplomatics (in American English, and in most anglophone countries), or diplomatic (in British English), is a scholarly discipline centred on the critical analysis of documents: especially, historical documents. It focuses on the conventions, protocols and formulae that have been used by document creators, and uses these to increase understanding of the processes of document creation, of information transmission, and of the relationships between the facts which the documents purport to record and reality.

The discipline originally evolved as a tool for studying and determining the authenticity of the official charters and diplomas issued by royal and papal chanceries. It was subsequently appreciated that many of the same underlying principles could be applied to other types of official document and legal instrument, to non-official documents such as private letters, and, most recently, to the metadata of electronic records.

Diplomatics is one of the auxiliary sciences of history. It should not be confused with its sister-discipline of palaeography. In fact, its techniques have more in common with those of the literary disciplines of textual criticism and historical criticism.

==Etymology==
Despite the verbal similarity, the discipline has nothing to do with diplomacy. Both terms are derived, by separate linguistic development, from the word &quot;diploma&quot;, which originally referred to a folded piece of writing material—and thus both to the materials which are the focus of study in diplomatics, and to accreditation papers carried by diplomats.

The word &quot;diplomatics&quot; was effectively coined by the Benedictine monk Jean Mabillon, who in 1681 published his treatise, (Latin: roughly, &quot;The Study of Documents&quot;). From there, the word entered the French language as , and then English as &quot;diplomatic&quot; or &quot;diplomatics&quot;.

==Definitions==
&quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (1828) defines diplomatics as the &quot;science of diplomas, or of ancient writings, literary and public documents, letters, decrees, charters, codicils, etc., which has for its object to decipher old writings, to ascertain their authenticity, their date, signatures, etc.&quot;

Giorgio Cencetti (1908–1970) defined the discipline as &quot;the study of the &quot;Wesen&quot; [being] and &quot;Werden&quot; [becoming] of documentation, the analysis of genesis, inner constitution and transmission of documents, and of their relationship with the facts represented in them and with their creators&quot;.

The Commission International de Diplomatique has defined diplomatics as &quot;the science which studies the tradition, the form and the issuing of written documents&quot;.

More pragmatically, Peter Beal defines diplomatics as &quot;the science or study of documents and records, including their forms, language, script and meaning. It involves knowledge of such matters as the established wording and procedures of particular kinds of document, the deciphering of writing, and document analysis and authentication&quot;.

Theo Kölzer defines diplomatics as &quot;the teaching and the study of charters&quot;. He treats the terms &quot;charter&quot;, &quot;diploma&quot;, and &quot;document&quot; as broadly synonymous, and refers to the German scholar Harry Bresslau&#x27;s definition of &quot;documents&quot; as &quot;written declarations recorded in compliance with certain forms alternating according to the difference in person, place, time, and matter, which are meant to serve as a testimony of proceedings of a legal nature&quot;.

Properly speaking, and as usually understood by present-day scholars, diplomatics is concerned essentially with the analysis and interpretation of the linguistic and textual elements of a document. It is, however, closely associated with several parallel disciplines, including palaeography, sigillography, codicology, and provenance studies, all of which are concerned with a document&#x27;s physical characteristics and history, and which will often be carried out in conjunction with a diplomatic analysis. The term diplomatics is therefore sometimes used in a slightly wider sense, to encompass some of these other areas (as it was in Mabillon&#x27;s original work, and as is implied in the definitions of both Webster and Beal quoted above). The recent development of the science in non-English Europe is expanding its scope to a cultural history of documentation including aspects of pragmatic literacy or symbolic communication.

Christopher Brooke, a distinguished teacher of diplomatics, referred to the discipline&#x27;s reputation in 1970 as that of &quot;a formidable and dismal science ... a kind of game played by a few scholars, most of them medievalists, harmless so long as it does not dominate or obscure historical enquiry; or, perhaps, most commonly of all, an aid to understanding of considerable use to scholars and research students if only they had time to spare from more serious pursuits&quot;.

==History==

In the ancient and medieval periods, the authenticity of a document was considered to derive from the document&#x27;s place of preservation and storage, in, for example, temples, public offices, and archives. As a result, those with nefarious motives were able to give forged documents a spurious authenticity by depositing them in places of authority. Diplomatics grew from a need to establish new standards of authenticity through the critical analysis of the textual and physical forms of documents.

The first notable application of diplomatics was by Nicolas of Cusa, in 1433, and Lorenzo Valla, in 1440, who determined, independently, that the Donation of Constantine, which had been used for centuries to legitimize papal temporal authority, was a forgery. Diplomatic techniques were further developed as part of a wider battery of antiquarian skills during the Reformation and Counter-Reformation eras. The emergence of diplomatics as a recognisably distinct sub-discipline, however, is generally dated to the publication of Mabillon&#x27;s in 1681. Mabillon had begun studying old documents with a view towards establishing their authenticity as a result of the doubts raised by the Jesuit Daniel van Papenbroek over supposed Merovingian documents from the Abbey of Saint-Denis. During the Middle Ages, the production of spurious charters and other documents had been common, either to provide written documentation of existing rights or to bolster the plausibility of claimed rights. Mabillon&#x27;s work engendered a far livelier awareness of the potential presence of forged or spurious documents, in the fields of both history and law.

Although Mabillon is still widely seen as the &quot;father&quot; of diplomatics, a more important milestone in the formation of the battery of practical techniques which make up the modern discipline was the publication of René-Prosper Tassin and Charles-François Toustain&#x27;s &quot;Nouveau traité de diplomatique&quot;, which appeared in six volumes in 1750–65.

The most significant work in English was Thomas Madox&#x27;s &quot;Formulare Anglicanum&quot;, published in 1702. In general, however, the discipline was always studied more intensively by continental scholars than by those in Britain.

Diplomatics is often associated with the study of documents of the medieval period. However, scholars such as Luciana Duranti have argued that many of its theories and principles can be adapted and applied to contemporary archival science.

==Uses==
The study of diplomatics is a valuable tool for historians, enabling them to determine whether alleged historical documents and archives are in fact genuine or forgeries. Its techniques may also be used to help date undated documents.

Diplomatics has many similar applications in the field of law.

Some famous cases in which the principles of diplomatics have been employed have included:
* Lorenzo Valla&#x27;s proof of the forgery of the Donation of Constantine. Valla&#x27;s work preceded Mabillon by roughly two centuries, and was the first application of the principles of modern, scientific diplomatics.
* The Hitler diaries hoax (1983).
* The National Archives forgeries (the Martin Allen forgeries, or Himmler forged documents) (2005).

==Diplomatic editions and transcription==
A diplomatic edition is an edition (in print or online) of an historic manuscript text that seeks to reproduce as accurately as possible in typography all significant features of the manuscript original, including spelling and punctuation, abbreviations, deletions, insertions, and other alterations. Similarly, diplomatic transcription attempts to represent by means of a system of editorial signs all features of a manuscript original. The term &quot;semi-diplomatic&quot; is used for an edition or transcription that seeks to reproduce only some of these features of the original. A diplomatic edition is thus distinguished from a &quot;normalized edition&quot;, in which the editor, while not altering the original wording of the text, renders it using normal (modern) orthography.

A diplomatic edition is also to be distinguished both from a &quot;facsimile edition&quot;, which, in the modern era, normally employs photographic or digital images; and from a &quot;type facsimile&quot; (such as Abraham Farley&#x27;s edition of &quot;Domesday Book&quot;), which seeks to reproduce the appearance of the original through the use of a special typeface or digital font.

<text>Alcea is a genus of over 80 species of flowering plants in the mallow family Malvaceae, commonly known as the hollyhocks. They are native to Asia and Europe. The single species of hollyhock from the Americas, the streambank wild hollyhock, belongs to a different genus.

==Description==
Hollyhocks are annual, biennial, or perennial plants usually taking an erect, unbranched form. The herbage usually has a coating of star-shaped hairs. The leaf blades are often lobed or toothed, and are borne on long petioles. The flowers may be solitary or arranged in fascicles or racemes. The notched petals are usually over three centimeters wide and may be pink, white, purple, or yellow. The fruit is a schizocarp, a dry disc divided into over 15 sections that contain seeds.

==Uses==
Hollyhocks are popular garden ornamental plants. They are easily grown from seed. Breeds with red flowers attract hummingbirds and butterflies. Cultivars have been bred, especially from &quot;A. rosea&quot;. They include the double-flowered &#x27;Chater&#x27;s Double&#x27;, the raspberry-colored &#x27;Creme de Cassis&#x27;, and &#x27;The Watchman&#x27;, which has dark, nearly black, maroon flowers.

The stems of hollyhocks can be used as firewood, and the roots have been used medicinally.

==Pests and diseases==
&quot;Alcea&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Bucculatrix quadrigemina&quot; and &quot;Vanessa cardui&quot;, the painted lady.

The mallow flea beetle (&quot;Podagrica fuscicornis&quot;) is a pest that makes tiny holes in the leaves. Cutworms, aphids, and capsid bugs use the plant as a food source in hotter and drier conditions. A number of weevils use &quot;A. rosea&quot; as their host plant, including &quot;Rhopalapion longirostre&quot;, &quot;Alocentron curvirostre&quot;, and &quot;Aspidapion validum&quot;.

The plants are also susceptible to the pathogenic fungus &quot;Puccinia malvacearum&quot;, the hollyhock rust.

==Culture==
The Aoi Matsuri (Hollyhock Festival) is one of the three main festivals of the city of Kyoto.
During the Victorian era, the hollyhock symbolized both ambition and fecundity in the language of flowers.

The UK National Collection of hollyhocks is held by Jonathan Sheppard in Lincolnshire.

<text>TV-am was a TV company that broadcast the ITV franchise for breakfast television in the United Kingdom from 1 February 1983 until 31 December 1992. The station was the UK&#x27;s first national operator of a commercial breakfast television franchise. Its daily broadcasts were between 6:00 am and 9:25 am.

Throughout its nine years and 10 months of broadcast, the station regularly had problems, resulting in numerous management changes, especially in its early years. It also suffered from major financial cutbacks hampering its operations. Though on a stable footing by 1986 and winning its ratings battle with the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;, within a year turmoil had ensued when industrial action hit the company.

Despite these setbacks, by the 1990s, TV-am&#x27;s flagship programme &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; had become the most popular breakfast show on UK television. Following a change in the law regarding television franchising, the company lost its licence and was replaced by GMTV in 1993.

==Foundation==
The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) announced on 24 January 1980 that in the next ITV franchising round it would offer a national licence for breakfast television. Eight applications were received and on 28 December that year, the IBA announced that it had awarded the breakfast franchise to TV-am.

Although the initial launch date was set for June 1983, to avoid clashing with the 1982 launch of Channel 4, the IBA allowed the station to bring forward its start date to 1 February 1983 in response to the launch of the BBC service &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; two weeks earlier.

This hurried start affected the company in two ways. Firstly, ITV had failed in its negotiations for royalties and rates for advertising on the new Channel 4 and the breakfast service with the actors&#x27; trade union, Equity. The union instructed its members to boycott the new station, which meant there was little or no revenue from advertising in the early days.

Secondly, it was believed that the BBC&#x27;s breakfast service would be highbrow, focusing on news and analysis, so TV-am had developed its new service to match that. However, the BBC launched a lightweight, magazine-style programme that mimicked the style of United States breakfast television. With the launch of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; brought forward at short notice, this gave little time for TV-am to redevelop its plans.

TV-am was spearheaded by the so-called Famous Five who were not only lined up as presenters on the station, but were also shareholders: Michael Parkinson, David Frost (1983–92), Angela Rippon (1983), Anna Ford (1983) and Robert Kee. Esther Rantzen had originally been one of the station&#x27;s &#x27;star&#x27; line-up of presenter/shareholders, but pulled out in 1981 after the birth of her third child; she and the company agreed that the early morning starts would present a problem in her raising her child. She had also been persuaded by the BBC to continue producing and presenting &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; and conceded she did not want to give up the show, or worse, see it continue with another anchor.

There had been many difficulties for the other presenters in the run-up to launch. When the franchise was announced in December 1980, Rippon&#x27;s contract with the BBC was about to expire, and was not renewed as a result of her new employment. This left her seeking freelance work before TV-am went on air. Ford was dismissed by ITN, which had been part of another consortium bidding for the breakfast contract. ITN had presented Ford as their female programme presenter as part of their bid, unaware that she was planning to defect to TV-am. ITN heavily criticised her disloyalty and said that her dishonesty had made its bid seem &quot;ridiculous&quot; to the IBA. ITN replaced Ford with Selina Scott, who herself landed a double blow to ITN when she defected to the BBC to present &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; towards the end of 1982. Michael Parkinson did remain with the BBC, who hoped to persuade him to stay as they had with Rantzen, but he finally left the corporation in 1982. A challenge for all the Famous Five came before the station launch when in an administration error, the contracts for the five presenters were sent to the wrong individuals, which led Rippon to discover she was being paid £60,000 per year, considerably less than Anna Ford who was being paid £145,000. The women also learnt that their male counterparts Frost and Parkinson were each being paid almost £250,000.

TV-am&#x27;s headquarters and studios were at Breakfast Television Centre, Hawley Crescent, Camden Town, London. Designed by Terry Farrell and converted from a former car showroom, Henlys Rover, the building included a number of large plastic egg cups along its roofline facing Regent&#x27;s Canal; these egg cups also served as the programme&#x27;s closing credits copyright year identifier, with all previous years also kept on-screen behind the current year.

TV-am had two television studios. Studio A, 3000 square feet, was home to the Good Morning Britain set. Studio B had a smaller version of the GMB set and was also used as the news studio.

Programmes originally ran from 6 am to 9:15 am, with &quot;Daybreak&quot;, then &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; filling weekday mornings. This was followed by a 10-minute interval before the start of the regional ITV franchises at 9:25 am. This interval was needed because the process of the switching the broadcast signals from TV-am to each regional company was still manual and this gap gave British Telecom the required time to complete this task. Shortly after TV-am&#x27;s launch, the process was converted to allow automatic switching, which was introduced gradually throughout the network, and from the end of May 1983 the IBA extended TV-am&#x27;s hours to 9:25 am to allow for continuous programming. At this point, &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; was reduced to a two-hour slot from 7 am to 9 am. The 9 am to 9:25 am section was relaunched as a female-orientated lifestyle magazine segment titled &quot;After Nine&quot;. Although TV-am was a separate broadcaster occupying the ITV network channel during the morning, from the late 1980s the ITV stations extended their hours to 6 am to provide 24-hour television, handing over to TV-am at 6 am.

==Difficult beginnings==
While the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; was successful, TV-am&#x27;s early ratings were disappointing. Its high-minded and somewhat starchy approach, summed up in the phrase &quot;mission to explain&quot; (coined by chief executive Peter Jay) sat uneasily at that time of day, compared to the accessible magazine style of &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;, which mixed heavy news and light-hearted features, famously moving cabinet ministers, after a serious interview, to help with a cookery demonstration.

The first day of broadcasting from TV-am included an hour of news in &quot;Daybreak&quot;, a short film and an interview with Norman Tebbit about the current level of unemployment, a live comic strip called &quot;The World of Melanie Parker&quot;, and &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot;. Within two weeks of the launch; the ratings dropped sharply, within a month, the ratings fell again to just under 300,000. The company&#x27;s weekend slot, presented by Michael Parkinson, initially became the only success for the station, largely because the BBC did not broadcast on weekend mornings. The Saturday editions drew 1.5 million viewers.

A number of changes were made on 28 February: &quot;Daybreak&quot; was reduced by 30 minutes and presented by Gavin Scott, while &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; was moved 30 minutes earlier to start at 6:30 am, with Angela Rippon being moved from &quot;Daybreak&quot; to present alongside Anna Ford. The original &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; team of Frost and Ford was intended to last 12 weeks, but in an attempt to reinvigorate the show, Frost voluntarily agreed to step down so that the female team of Ford and Rippon could spearhead the slot. After just one edition on air, Ford was struck with flu, with her returning the following week on 7 March. During the first week of the revised format, the viewer figures increased by 200,000, with Frost and Parkinson stepping in to cover for her. During the second week of both Rippon and Ford, figures continued to remain at a peak of 500,000. On 26 March, new figures were published, highlighting that TV-am had once again lost 100,000 up to the week before; however, ratings were still higher overall, compared to the end of February&#x27;s figures.

A boardroom coup ensued on 18 March, when Peter Jay stepped aside allowing Jonathan Aitken, a sitting Conservative MP, to become chief executive of the station, after mounting pressure from investors who had demanded changes. On the same day, Angela Rippon and Anna Ford came out publicly to support Jay, calling the goings-on &quot;treachery&quot;, unaware Jay had already left. Over the course of the next few days Aitken made it clear a number of changes were being looked at to improve the ratings including cutting the number of ad breaks, while also denying he wanted anyone to resign. Many officials, like those at the IBA, opposition parties, and even Aitken&#x27;s own governing party were not happy at his appointment, as it may have interfered with TV-am&#x27;s political freedom, with many demanding he give up the role or stop being a Member of Parliament. The IBA finally approved Aitken a few days later, but made its intention clear: his tenure was for a limited period only, and they would keep an extra close eye on all the programmes during this period.

On 1 April (Good Friday), puppet Roland Rat made his first appearance; he was created by David Claridge and launched by TV-am Children&#x27;s editor Anne Wood to entertain younger viewers during the Easter holidays, which boosted the station&#x27;s audience. Roland Rat is generally regarded as its saviour, being described as &quot;the only rat to join a sinking ship&quot;. During the summer, when &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; hosts Frank Bough and Selina Scott were off, he helped take the audience from 100,000 to over a million and a half.

On 4 April, Greg Dyke became director of programmes to help overhaul the station&#x27;s output. A day later sports presenter Nick Owen become one of the main presenters working one week each with Ford and Rippon initially only for the month of April The latter was castigated by viewers and the media for her blatant hostility to Owen on air. When he made an error in a link, Rippon stated &quot;You see, it&#x27;s not as easy as you think.&quot; During April, the live comic strip &quot;The World of Melanie Parker&quot; was axed.

On 14 April, Aitken&#x27;s cousin Timothy became chief executive of the station due to the IBA rules regarding MPs operating a television station. This resulted in Rippon and Ford being sacked on 19 April, with no official reason given at that time; unofficially it was made clear both breached their contracts for their public support for Jay, while at some time by sacking both helped cut costs. Parkinson ended up in lengthy talks with Aitken over the issues and the sacking of his two former colleagues, which resulted in him becoming a director of the company and joining the board of management. As part of these talks, further members of staff who clashed with Parkinson would be removed. Ford encountered Jonathan Aitken at a party in Chelsea; in a parting shot over the terms of her dismissal, she threw her glass of wine in his face, saying of her action: &quot;It was the only form of self-defence left to a woman when she has been so monstrously treated.&quot; A couple of days later both Rippon and Ford started procedures to sue TV-am; by October, the case was dropped after reaching an out of court settlement.

Lynda Berry was brought in as stop-gap measurement for six weeks, before Anne Diamond joined from the BBC to become Owen&#x27;s new co-presenter from 6 June.

On 23 May, TV-am&#x27;s new look started. &quot;Daybreak&quot; was axed, with &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; extended to start at 6:25 am. Commander David Philpott was moved to present the weather at the weekends only, with Wincey Willis becoming the new weekday weather presenter, and a host of new features were introduced:
* &quot;Today&#x27;s The Day&quot; with Jeremy Beadle
* An exercise spot with Lizzie Webb
* Cooking with John Eley, the Cooking Canon (Rustie Lee would later take over)
* Fishing correspondent, &quot;Codfather&quot; George Vella
* Nick Owen with Lynda Berry (later succeeded by Diamond), reading out the newspaper bingo numbers.

By the end of its first week, TV-am&#x27;s ratings had doubled to 200,000.

Continuing low audiences brought further financial difficulties: the company was close to having its power supply disconnected; a London Electricity official arrived during a press conference with a warrant to cut off power for non-payment; and on numerous occasions, the presenters failed to receive their monthly wages, while the local newsagent stopped supplying the station with newspapers due to lack of payment. TV-am spent the summer on the road, using the outside broadcast truck from various seaside resorts around the UK, and was presented by Chris Tarrant.

Michael Parkinson went to Australia in early June 1983 for the summer, with Henry Kelly taking over his weekend duties. David Frost was given the Sunday slot from 28 August, initially for eight weeks with the belief that Parkinson would return to his full duties in October. By November, Parkinson had returned; however, he was only given the Saturday slot after Frost had increased the number of viewers on Sundays. Parkinson finally left the station in early February 1984, while the company announced plans to cut over 40 jobs.

In September, TV-am finally joined the television contractors’ associations, which gave the addition benefit of providing cross-promotional content between the 15 regional ITV companies and TV-am. The continuing increase in viewership had still not resulted in an increase in advertising revenue, and throughout October, speculation arose the company would collapse at any second. The situation was resolved in November when a new refinance package come into effect with new shareholders including Ladbrokes and the owners of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; which injected new capital worth over £4.5 million into the company.

==Bruce Gyngell==
Australian business tycoon Kerry Packer took a substantial minority interest in the company in early 1984, and in early May appointed his own chief executive, Bruce Gyngell, who was brought in to help make the company financially viable. Greg Dyke left within a few weeks of the appointment to take a new position with TVS. Ten days later, general manager Michael Moor also left the station. In July 1984, Michael Hollingsworth became the new Programme Controller, having previously worked for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;.

Gyngell pursued the same lightweight, populist approach that Dyke had forged to establish the station&#x27;s viability, a model parodied later in a &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper headline as &quot;Snap, Crackle and Pap&quot;. The station overhauled its children&#x27;s Saturday morning programme with &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot;, replacing &quot;Data Run &quot;and &quot;SPLAT&quot; as part of the cost-cutting by management.

The cost-cutting was brought sharply into focus in the Brighton hotel bombing on the Conservative cabinet in October 1984. The night before the terrorist attack, TV-am only had one crew covering the conference and that had been called back to London the previous night to cover a train crash in Wembley. When the blast occurred in the early hours, the BBC and ITN provided immediate coverage. TV-am&#x27;s response was limited to a caption of reporter John Stapleton reporting over the phone, while the BBC were showing graphic coverage of the attack. Trade union agreements at the time meant that technical staff at the local ITV station TVS could not provide cover for another commercial television company, and TV-am&#x27;s previous conflicts with ITN meant that the latter would not share its footage. The whole affair earned the company a severe rebuke from the IBA, which told the company to invest and improve its news coverage or it would lose its licence.

In an echo of the changes which had occurred in newspapers, Gyngell was determined to make use of technical developments in television in order to reduce staff and save money. He believed that the ease of use of modern broadcasting equipment meant that staffing levels could be reduced: ENG crews would no longer require a separate lighting technician (following a pattern familiar in Gyngell&#x27;s native Australia), and technical personnel could be virtually eliminated. This brought him into conflict with the broadcasting trade unions, but gained him support from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her government. During 1986, TV-am became the most popular breakfast television service in the UK, as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; lost viewers. In November of that year, the magazine-style &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; took on a more heavyweight approach; and in 1989 the BBC replaced &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; entirely with a more in-depth and analytical news format called &quot;Breakfast News&quot;, reminiscent of the original format used by TV-am.

In the hurricane-force storms that hit England in October 1987, electrical power to the studios was lost and an emergency programme had to be transmitted from facilities at Thames Television&#x27;s Euston Road centre, using reports from the crews of TV-am and those of ITN, TSW and TVS. All this notwithstanding, the programme continued to thrive. Eventually, Gyngell fired all of the locked-out technicians, replacing them with non-unionised labour from around the world.

===Intra-industrial dispute===
On 23 November 1987, technicians at the station went on a 24-hour strike. Management locked out the strikers, but stayed on air using non-technical staff to broadcast a skeleton service including, among other things, episodes of American series including &quot;Flipper&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

Gyngell himself took to directing the show personally, and various secretaries (including Gyngell&#x27;s own) manned cameras, when a reduced normal service resumed on 7 December. Although shambolic at times, this schedule turned out on occasions to be more popular than former programming, although not what would have been allowed to be broadcast under normal circumstances. Further discussions continued with the unions;
 however, on 16 February 1988, all the technicians were made redundant, with many of the technicians being informed by an announcement made on &quot;News at Ten&quot;.

In the years that followed, the station gradually found its feet again. By the early 1990s, operating with a significantly reduced staff, it was the world&#x27;s most profitable TV station in terms of turnover.

==Law change and demise==
In 1990, changes in broadcasting law meant that commercial television franchises were no longer allocated on merit or potential, but rather through a blind auction. Following these changes, the Independent Broadcasting Authority was replaced by a light touch regulator, the Independent Television Commission (ITC). TV-am was required to re-apply for its licence in May 1991. The ITV franchise results were announced on 16 October and the bid for £14.3m that TV-am had made was beaten by another consortium, Sunrise Television (renamed GMTV when it launched) which offered £36.4m. Ironically, in the years following its launch, GMTV approached the ITC to retrospectively obtain a reduction in this fee, taking it to a level below what TV-am had originally bid.

By February 1992 the first on-screen effects of the licence loss became obvious, with TV-am closing its in-house news service and contracting it out to Sky News for a one-off payment. Children&#x27;s programming also suffered, with fewer appearances of Timmy Mallett, though &quot;Wacaday&quot; would continue during major school holidays until TV-am&#x27;s close. Another impact was the abrupt cancellation after just six weeks of the Chris Evans-hosted Saturday morning strand &quot;TV-Mayhem&quot;, which had initially been commissioned for a 40-week run, and its replacement with presented-out-of-vision back-to-back cartoons strand &quot;Cartoon World&quot; on Saturdays from 8 am (extended to 7:30 am later in the year).

Margaret Thatcher, whose government had introduced the change to the allocation of commercial television franchises (but who had by then been replaced as prime minister by John Major), famously wrote to Bruce Gyngell, apologising for being partly responsible for TV-am losing its licence. Her letter read, in part: &quot;I am ... heartbroken. I am only too painfully aware that I was responsible for the legislation.&quot; The letter was private but Gyngell made it public, which drew criticism from friends of the former prime minister.

===Closure===
The station&#x27;s final broadcast ended on 31 December 1992 at 9:21 am. Credits over a black-and-white still of the station&#x27;s cast and crew in the studio showed snapshot of their portraits as the screen faded ending with the caption: TV-am: 1 February 1983 – 31 December 1992.

This was then followed by the last commercial break after which there was no final appearance by the famous eggcups; they had been seen for the last time the day before. Instead, the final promotion was for GMTV which began broadcasting at 6am the following day.

While TV-am was an independent station and had used an expensive, purpose-owned custom-built studio complex at Camden Lock, GMTV used studio space at The London Studios owned by one of GMTV&#x27;s shareholders, LWT.

====The studios====

Breakfast Television Centre in Camden Town was sold to MTV Networks in 1993, with the famous eggcups still standing on the roof of the building beside the Regent&#x27;s Canal. As well as being used by MTV for the production of its programmes, MTV Studios, as they were known, were available for commercial hire within the TV industry. The TV-am lettering built into the fascia of the building was obscured – by being covered with discs – but were still partially visible until they were completely removed during further renovations in spring 2012.

In 1999, a fire broke out in a video suite, causing extensive damage to the first floor and roof of the building. Production studios and offices were undamaged, as were the eggcups.

In 2011, MTV Networks applied for permission to make changes to the building, primarily to remove some of the studios – which were in decreasing demand following changes in MTV&#x27;s scheduling and commissioning practices – and replace these with modern office space. The rear of the building, facing Regent&#x27;s Canal, was repainted grey rather than blue, but the structure – and the iconic eggcups – remained in place. The front of the building was more extensively redeveloped during 2012–13: the studio block, which had been the site of the original TV-am studios, was demolished and replaced with a new glazed-fronted office complex. The front &#x27;courtyard&#x27; between the prior studio and office sections was renovated and reorganised, including the installation of a green wall. The office suite on the other side of the courtyard remained in place but was renovated, including the removal of the obscured-since-1993 &#x27;TVAM&#x27; lettering from the building fascia. MTV Networks continued to operate from the building during the rebuilding and renovation works, and following the construction of the expanded office space, it was able to move Comedy Central UK and Nickelodeon UK from their prior central London office complexes to Hawley Crescent.

====Brand and programming====
In August 1993, TV-am plc became Crockfords plc, since 1995 known as Capital Corporation Ltd, a gambling company which is currently non-trading.

The TV-am name and logo, and 15 registered trade marks, are now owned by journalist Ian White.

The archive of TV-am programmes made between 1983 and 1992 was taken over by Moving Image Communications Ltd, which recruited AP Archive as exclusive licensor of the TV-am footage library. The AP Archive claims to have over 10,000 hours of available TV-am material.

<text>Nigel Timothy Godrich (born 28 February 1971) is an English record producer, recording engineer and musician. He has worked with acts including Radiohead, Travis, Beck, Air, Paul McCartney, U2, R.E.M., Pavement, Roger Waters, Arcade Fire and Idles.

Early in his career, Godrich worked as the house engineer at RAK Studios, London, under the producer John Leckie. He first worked with Radiohead while engineering their second album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995), at RAK. Radiohead hired him to produce &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), which was a major success and brought him attention from major artists. Godrich has produced all of their albums since, along with several projects with the Radiohead members Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood. Godrich won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Album for the 2003 Radiohead album &quot;Hail to the Thief.&quot; 

Godrich is a member of the bands Atoms for Peace (with Yorke) and Ultraísta. In 2006, he launched the music webseries &quot;From the Basement&quot;. In 2010, Godrich and Beck composed the score for &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, Godrich&#x27;s first film work.

==Early years and education==
Nigel Godrich was born in Westminster, London, the son of Victor Godrich, a BBC sound supervisor, and Brenda Godrich. He was fascinated by recording at an early age. As a child, after he asked for a machine to make records, his father bought him a cassette machine; Godrich used it to make recordings of his television, train sets and running water.

Godrich was educated at William Ellis School in North West London, where he shared classes with his friend and the future Zero 7 member Henry Binns. Godrich began playing guitar, inspired by Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa. He first visited a recording studio at the age of 16, when his band recorded a demo at Elephant Studios, Wapping, and spent time asking the engineer questions. He studied at the School of Audio Engineering (SAE), London.

== Career ==
After graduating from SAE, Godrich became a junior staff member at the Audio One studio complex, working as a tea boy. He did not enjoy his time there. According to Godrich, &quot;With a beeper in my pocket, I&#x27;d wait next to the kettle, ready to deliver my hot beverages. I wasn&#x27;t even allowed in the studios, but I [would] hang there thinking, &#x27;OK, it&#x27;s only the first rung, but at least I&#x27;m on the ladder.&#x27;&quot;

After the closure of Audio One, in 1990 joined RAK Studios, London, first as a messenger and later as a studio assistant. He would stay late at night, inviting musician friends to play there while he practised recording them. At RAK, he became a tape operator for the producer John Leckie, with whom he worked on albums by Ride and Denim.

After four years, Godrich left RAK to go freelance and set up his own studio, Shabang, where he planned to create dance music. Six months later, he was hired to engineer and mix &quot;The Sound Of... McAlmont &amp; Butler&quot; (1995), the debut album by McAlmont &amp; Butler. Godrich said it was a &quot;brilliant experience&quot; and credited Bernard Butler with teaching him how to produce records. Godrich produced the self-titled debut album by &quot;Silver Sun&quot;, released in May 1997.

=== Radiohead ===

Godrich first worked with the rock band Radiohead when John Leckie hired him at RAK to engineer their EP &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; (1994) and their second album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995). The band nicknamed him &quot;Nihilist&quot;, approving of his efforts to take their sound in new directions. When Leckie left the studio to attend a social engagement, Radiohead and Godrich stayed to record B-sides. One song, &quot;Black Star&quot;, was instead included on &quot;The Bends&quot;. In 1995, Godrich produced Radiohead&#x27;s charity single &quot;Lucky&quot;, plus the B-sides &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Robes&quot; and &quot;Talk Show Host&quot;, released on the 1996 single &quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot;.

Radiohead invited Godrich to co-produce their third album, &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997). It won Best Alternative Album at the 40th Grammy Awards and sold more than 4.5 million copies worldwide. Working in improvised studios without supervision, Godrich and the band learned as they went, and credited the success to the open process. In 2013, Godrich told the &quot;Guardian&quot;: &quot;&quot;OK Computer&quot; was such a big thing for me because I was given power for the first time. Some of these incredibly intelligent and insightful people said &#x27;do what you want&#x27; to me so I worked my arse off for them and together we did something that represents where we all were at the time. And it stuck for some reason. People got it, so that changed my life.&quot;

Godrich has produced every Radiohead studio album since. He won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Album for their sixth album, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; (2003). For their seventh album, &quot;In Rainbows&quot; (2007), Radiohead initially hired a new producer, Spike Stent. According to the guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien, Radiohead wanted to get out of the &quot;comfort zone&quot; by working with a new producer, and the bassist, Colin Greenwood, said Godrich was busy working with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Beck. Radiohead re-enlisted Godrich after their sessions with Stent proved fruitless.

Godrich&#x27;s father died during the recording of Radiohead&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot; (2016). Godrich wrote: &quot;Making this album was a very intense experience for me. I lost my dad in the process. Hence a large piece of my soul lives here in a good way.&quot; Godrich provided sound design for &quot;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition&quot; (2021), an interactive experience created for the anniversary of &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;.

In 2006, CBC described Godrich&#x27;s collaboration with Radiohead as &quot;the most adventurous band-producer partnership in modern rock&quot;. He has been dubbed the band&#x27;s &quot;sixth member&quot;, an allusion to Beatles producer George Martin being called the &quot;fifth Beatle&quot;. Godrich also plays Chieftain Mews, a long-running character who appears in Radiohead&#x27;s promotional material.

==== Side projects ====

Godrich has produced most of the solo work by the Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke, including his albums &quot;The Eraser &quot;(2006), &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Modern Boxes &quot;(2014) and &quot;Anima&quot; (2019). Yorke credits Godrich with helping edit his work, identifying which parts need improvement and which have potential. He gave the example of the &quot;Eraser&quot; song &quot;Black Swan&quot;, which originally was &quot;a six-minute load of crap, except for this one juicy bit, and [Godrich] goes past and goes, &#x27;That bit. Fuck the rest.&#x27; Usually it&#x27;s something like that.&quot; Godrich said that working with Yorke alone was more straightforward than with Radiohead, as he did not have to manage the relationship between Yorke and the other band members. On &quot;The Eraser&quot;, he and Yorke were able to &quot;pull in the same direction&quot;.

In 2009, to perform songs from &quot;The Eraser,&quot; Godrich and Yorke formed Atoms for Peace, with Godrich on guitar, keyboards and synthesisers. The band also includes the bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the drummer Joey Waronker of Beck and R.E.M., and the percussionist Mauro Refosco of Forro in the Dark. Their debut album, &quot;Amok&quot;, produced by Godrich, was released in 2013, followed by a tour of Europe, the US and Japan. Godrich engineered &quot;Junun&quot;, a 2015 album by the Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, the Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur and the Indian ensemble the Rajasthan Express, recorded at Mehrangarh Fort in Rajasthan, India.

Godrich produced &quot;A Light for Attracting Attention&quot; (2022), the debut album by the Smile, a band comprising Yorke, Greenwood and the drummer Tom Skinner. The &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Alexis Petridis said the Smile &quot;sound like a simultaneously more skeletal and knottier version of Radiohead&quot;, exploring more progressive rock influences with unusual time signatures, complex riffs and &quot;hard-driving&quot; motorik psychedelia. Godrich mixed &quot;Jarak Qaribak&quot;, a 2023 album by Greenwood and the Israeli rock musician Dudu Tasaa.

=== Other projects ===
Following his success with &quot;OK Computer&quot;, Godrich mixed most of Natalie Imbruglia&#x27;s hit album &quot;Left of the Middle&quot; (1997) and R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Up&quot; (1998). Godrich produced three albums by the American singer-songwriter Beck: &quot;Mutations&quot; (1998), &quot;Sea Change&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Information&quot; (2006). The first two, particularly &quot;Sea Change&quot;, were noted for their atmospheric folk/pop sound, a departure from the spontaneous, sample-heavy style Beck was known for.

Godrich produced several albums by Travis, including their commercial breakthrough, &quot;The Man Who&quot; (1999), and its followup, &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; (2001). According to the Travis songwriter, Fran Healy, Godrich was frustrated after the gruelling sessions for Radiohead&#x27;s albums &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, and so &quot;took it out on us because he couldn&#x27;t take it out on Radiohead&quot;. The mood settled after an argument. Healy felt it was good for Godrich to work with &quot;melodic&quot; bands such as Travis as well as more experimental acts such as Radiohead. Godrich co-produced the &quot;Travis&quot; albums &quot;The Boy With No Name&quot; (2007) with Mike Hedges.

Godrich produced Pavement&#x27;s final album, &quot;Terror Twilight&quot; (1999), with Radiohead&#x27;s Jonny Greenwood contributing harmonica on two tracks. Godrich, a fan of the band, hoped to help them find a bigger audience with a less &quot;sloppy&quot; record. Songwriter Stephen Malkmus later described the album as &quot;overproduced&quot; and described conflicts with Godrich. In response, Godrich tweeted: &quot;I literally slept on a friend&#x27;s floor in NYC to be able to make that album.&quot; In 2020, Godrich said that he loved the album and had enjoyed making it.

In 2001, Godrich remixed U2&#x27;s &quot;Walk On&quot; for its single release, and mixed and contributed production to Air&#x27;s albums &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; (2004) and &quot;Pocket Symphony&quot; (2007). In 2002, Godrich was hired to produce the second album by the Strokes, &quot;Room on Fire&quot; (2003). He was fired when their work, according to the band, proved &quot;soulless&quot;. Godrich said of the failed collaboration: &quot;The problem there was that me and [singer Julian Casablancas] are just too similar, we&#x27;re both control freaks. He wanted to do it his way, I wanted to do it my way, and obviously that&#x27;s the point of me being there. And I&#x27;m saying &#x27;Well, why am I here if you&#x27;re not prepared to try and do it the way I want to do it?&#x27; We got on great, it was just one of those laughable things where it just doesn&#x27;t work. I wanted them to change, and they didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Godrich produced the 20th-anniversary version of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, released in December 2004, which featured artists including Paul McCartney, Yorke and Greenwood. Godrich said in 2009: &quot;I&#x27;m glad I did it – it raised quite a bit of money. It came on when I was sitting in a lobby somewhere once, and it took me a while to recognise it. It sounded good though, better than I remembered.&quot; 

McCartney hired Godrich to produce his album &quot;Chaos and Creation in the Backyard&quot; (2005) after being recommended by the Beatles producer, George Martin. Godrich fired McCartney&#x27;s touring band and demanded that he abandon songs Godrich found clichéd, over-sentimental, or subpar. The album was nominated for several Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, and Godrich was nominated for Producer of the Year. 

In 2010, Godrich and Beck composed the score for &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, Godrich&#x27;s first film work. In October 2012, Godrich, along with Joey Waronker and singer Laura Bettinson, released an album as Ultraísta. In 2015, he produced the live album &quot;Roger Waters: The Wall&quot;, and made a cameo as a Stormtrooper in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;. He mixed the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; eleventh studio album, &quot;The Getaway&quot; (2016). Godrich produced the fifth solo album by Roger Waters, &quot;Is This the Life We Really Want?&quot;, released in June 2017. Godrich, a fan of Waters&#x27; work with Pink Floyd, was critical of Waters&#x27; previous solo work and felt his role as producer was to &quot;encourage him, to push him a little bit&quot;. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Godrich worked with the Arcade Fire in isolation in El Paso, Texas, producing their album &quot;We&quot; (2022).

===&quot;From the Basement&quot; (2006–2009)===

In September 2006, it was announced that Godrich, along with producer Dilly Gent, producer James Chads and John Woollcombe, were shooting the music series &quot;From the Basement&quot;, filmed from London&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios. The series focused on intimate, live performances by musicians without a host or an audience. Godrich said, &quot;I&#x27;m really interested to capture some really iconic, bigger names– really the whole point is to get people who are having their moment, to try and get a definitive record of what they&#x27;re doing.&quot;

Godrich conceived &quot;From the Basement&quot; as a means of authentically documenting music being made. Drawing further inspiration from British television music series &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, Godrich came upon the idea of a television programme. Despite early reports, &quot;From the Basement&quot; did not initially appear on British television, because of not taking on corporate sponsors.

When the pilot was in production, &quot;From the Basement&quot; was to be an online programme only. However, this was not feasible as it did not generate enough money to produce the episodes to the quality level desired. Instead, the producers went to international TV networks to receive money up front to produce the series. The series did eventually air on television; the first UK broadcast was on Sky Arts on 1 December 2007, featuring four songs performed by Thom Yorke on 8 December 2007. The United States premiere was on Rave HD on 22 February 2008, followed by a run on Independent Film Channel, as part of the network&#x27;s &quot;Automat&quot; block of television programmes in the autumn of 2008. On 3 November 2008, the series was released on DVD. A new series of &quot;From the Basement&quot; began on YouTube in May 2022, featuring acts including Idles, Warpaint and Caribou.

== Approach and influences ==
Godrich credited the producers Phil Thornalley, John Leckie and Steve Lillywhite for teaching him his craft, saying they were &quot;people I watched directly and emulated&quot;. He named his &quot;heroes&quot; as the Beatles producer George Martin, for &quot;inventing the job&quot;, and Trevor Horn, for being &quot;the thing that really made me sit up and listen&quot;. He said Joni Mitchell was his favourite artist, citing her &quot;unique combination of musical and lyrical talent&quot;.

Godrich said that although he enjoys listening to &quot;clinical&quot; and &quot;shiny&quot; music, he works best creating &quot;organic&quot; sounds: &quot;Making a dark brown soup was more my skill, [rather] than making a big fairy cake.&quot; He does not approach acts he produces; instead, he waits for them to contact him, as he does not assume he could improve the work of acts he already admires.

Godrich said he believes people place too much emphasis on studio equipment and &quot;trickery&quot;, which is less important than musical sensibility and communication. He said: &quot;I get very annoyed with people asking me what my favourite microphone is. It doesn&#x27;t matter ... One of the reasons why music has become generally worse, and I&#x27;m sorry to say that, is that people think about technology more than the actual music they&#x27;re making.&quot; He feels that &quot;the recording process is best when fast, because it&#x27;s then the smallest obstacle to the actual music&quot;.

<text>Zompist.com is a website created by Mark Rosenfelder a.k.a. Zompist, a conlanger. It features essays on comics, politics, language, and science, as well as a detailed description of Rosenfelder&#x27;s constructed world, Almea. The website is also the home of &quot;The Language Construction Kit&quot;, Rosenfelder&#x27;s article introducing new conlangers to the hobby.

Many features of the site have been noted by the press, including its culture tests, humorous excerpts from phrase books, its collection of numbers in over 5000 languages, and &quot;The Language Construction Kit&quot;.

==The Language Construction Kit==

&quot;The Language Construction Kit&quot; was originally a collection of HTML documents written by Rosenfelder and hosted at Zompist.com intended to be a guide for making constructed languages. The LCK proceeds from the simplest aspects of language upward, starting with phonology and writing systems, moving on to words, going through the complexities of grammar, and ending with an overview of registers and dialects. This sensible progression, as well as the warnings against common oversights, frequent use of examples from natural languages, and healthy dose of humor, has earned the LCK its popular and respected status among the Internet conlanging community. It has been translated into Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and German by fans, and came out in book form in March 2010. Rosenfelder has published several follow-up works: &quot;Advanced Language Construction&quot; and &quot;The Conlanger&#x27;s Lexipedia&quot;, which get into more detail on certain aspects of conlanging, and &quot;The Planet Construction Kit&quot;, which is geared towards creating whole fantasy worlds. In 2015, Rosenfelder published the &quot;China Construction Kit.&quot;

==The Zompist Bulletin Board==
The website has a corresponding bulletin board, formerly hosted with SpinnWebe but now with its own domain at www.verduria.org. The Zompist Bulletin Board (often abbreviated &quot;ZBB&quot;) is an online forum created for the purpose of discussing conlangs, conworlds, and Mark Rosenfelder&#x27;s own constructed world, &quot;Almea&quot;. Members of the board share and showcase their own conlangs and conworlds, as well as discuss aspects of the world&#x27;s languages.

==Almea==
&quot;Almea&quot; is a fictional world constructed by Mark Rosenfelder, which Zompist.com is mainly dedicated to. It is populated by several races, known as the &quot;Thinking Kinds&quot;. The Thinking kinds include the humans, the &quot;ktuvoks&quot; (swamp mammals with reptile characteristics considered demons by most Almean humans), the &quot;iliî&quot; (singular form &quot;iliu&quot;, ancient wise aquatic race, playing a role similar to elves in Tolkien&#x27;s mythos), the &quot;flaids&quot; (said to be &#x27;friendly but insane&#x27;), the &quot;elcari&quot; (hard-working mountain dwellers comparable to Tolkien&#x27;s dwarves), and the &quot;icëlani&quot; (more primitive relatives of humans). Almea&#x27;s main continent, Ereláe, has several nations, including Verduria, which is the most detailed and closest Almean counterpart to real-life countries, Dhekhnam, which is a ktuvok empire (meaning that humans function as slaves to the &quot;ktuvoks&quot; there), Xurno, a nation ruled by artists, and Skouras, a detailed maritime nation. Ereláe also has a detailed historical atlas, which was inspired by the New Penguin Historical Atlases. In addition to the various atlases and languages, there is also a wiki called the Almeopedia, which works as an encyclopedic reference. The part of the website devoted to Almea, Virtual Verduria, also includes a range of stories and guides to various subjects, including drawing and maps.

Languages of Almea described on the website include:

*Verdurian
*Ismaîn
*Barakhinei
*Caďinor
*Sarroc
*Cuêzi
*Axunašin
*Xurnese
*Proto-Eastern
*Kebreni
*Munkhâshi
*Wede:i
*Old Skourene
*Elkarîl
*Flaidish
*Uyseʔ
*Lé
*Dhekhnami
*Obenzayet
*Bhöɣetan
*Šɯk
Most words in those languages have etymologies, being derived from proto-languages (like Proto-Eastern above) by means of sound changes, and are given historical backgrounds, resulting in the presence of loan-words.

<text>The McCarthyites were a short-lived anti-Catholic and anti-French Canadian political movement which contested the 23 June 1896 federal election in Canada. The McCarthyite movement and the Patrons of Industry represented the first challenge to the two-party system in Canada.

Dalton McCarthy was the only &quot;McCarthyite&quot; to win election (he contested and won two seats), and the movement disbanded in 1898, not long after his death.

==Formation and political platform==
Dalton McCarthy, an Irish-born lawyer, first ran as a Conservative in Simcoe North in the 1872 election. He served as the Member of Parliament for Cardwell from an 1876 by-election. He returned to Simcoe North for the 1878 Canadian federal election; he was elected there, then re-elected in 1882 and 1887. Seen as a protégé of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and &quot;the &#x27;brains of the party&#x27;&quot;, McCarthy was seen as &quot;a logical successor to leadership&quot;. However, in 1891, McCarthy left the Conservative Party after disagreements with its leader, and ran and won as an independent.

McCarthy was notoriously anti-Catholic and anti-French Canadian. He was a founder of the Canadian branch of the Imperial Federation League, a group that sought to unite Britain and its colonies and dominions in a trans-global federation.

McCarthy also appears to have been associated with the Equal Rights Party, although he did not run under its banner in the 1891 election.

==The 1896 election==
In 1896, McCarthy and nine of his supporters presented themselves for election in ridings in Ontario and Manitoba. At the time, candidates could present their names for election in more than one riding at a time.

McCarthy sought election and won in both Simcoe North, Ontario, and Brandon, Manitoba. Having won re-election in Simcoe North, McCarthy resigned the Brandon seat.

McCarthyite candidates polled second in three other Ontario ridings, Lanark South, Hastings North and Durham East, scoring over 40% of the vote in each case.

In Muskoka and Parry Sound, McCarthyite candidate William Edward O&#x27;Brien, who had previously served as a Tory MP, won 20.1% of the vote in a three-way race. In the other ridings, the McCarthyites did poorly, winning about 10% of the vote or less.

Across all ridings, McCarthyites collected a total of 12,861 votes, or 28.1% of the popular vote.

McCarthy and his candidates were supported by the Protestant Protective Association, though McCarthy publicly repudiated the support, saying his League &quot;had &#x27;nothing whatever to do&#x27;&quot; with an internal PPA policy to nominate their members as McCarthyite candidates.

==Post-election==

As the only elected McCarthyite, Dalton McCarthy forged an alliance with Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Liberals, even though Laurier was a French Canadian Catholic. This alliance began during the election, as the McCarthyites made arrangements with the Liberal Party and the Patrons of Industry in some Southern Ontario ridings to avoid vote splitting among anti-Conservative voters. He might have been appointed to cabinet had he not died following a carriage accident in early 1898. His son, Leighton McCarthy, won a by-election to succeed his father.

His followers attempted to revive the party and pursue McCarthy&#x27;s anti-Catholic theme, but were unsuccessful. The party was formally disbanded in the same year.

<text>Urban Clarence &quot;Red&quot; Faber (September 6, 1888 – September 25, 1976) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball from through , playing his entire career for the Chicago White Sox. He was a member of the 1919 team but was not involved in the Black Sox scandal. In fact, he missed the World Series due to injury and illness.

Faber won 254 games over his 20-year career, a total which ranked 17th-highest in history upon his retirement. At the time of his retirement, he was the last legal spitballer in the American League; another legal spitballer, Burleigh Grimes, was later traded to the AL and appeared in 10 games for the Yankees in 1934. Faber was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964.

==Early life==
Faber was born on a farm near Cascade, Iowa, on September 6, 1888. He was of Luxembourgish ancestry. While Faber was a child, his father managed a tavern and later ran the Hotel Faber in Cascade. His father became one of the wealthiest citizens in Cascade. As a teenager, Faber attended college prep academies in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin and Dubuque, Iowa. By the age of 16, Faber was receiving $2 to pitch Sunday games with a local baseball team in Dubuque.

In 1909, Faber pitched a season for St. Joseph&#x27;s College, later known as Loras College. In a game against St. Ambrose University that year, he set a school record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game (24). Former Dubuque minor league owner Clarence &quot;Pants&quot; Rowland encouraged Faber to sign with the Class B Dubuque Miners of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League.

==Minor leagues==
Faber started well in the minor leagues. He pitched 15 games for Dubuque in 1909 and returned to the team in 1910, registering an 18–19 win–loss record and a 2.37 earned run average (ERA) in 44 games. He threw a perfect game for the Dubs against the Davenport Prodigals in September of that season.

He also spent time with minor league clubs in Pueblo and Des Moines.

==Major leagues==
===Early career===
Faber broke into the major leagues in 1914, starting 19 games and relieving in another 21; he posted a 2.68 ERA while winning 10 games and saving a league-leading four games (a statistic that was not actually recognized until 1959, and became an official baseball statistic as of 1969). Through the 1910s, he varied between starting and relieving for a team that enjoyed a wealth of pitching talent. In he won 24 games, tied for second in the American League behind Walter Johnson, and led the league with 50 appearances. In one game that season, he pitched a three-hitter with only 67 pitches.

In he had a record of 16–13, and at one point started—and won—three games in two days. He saved his best work for the World Series against the New York Giants. After winning Game 2 in Chicago but losing Game 4 on the road, he came into Game 5 (at home) in relief and picked up the win as the Sox came back from a 5–2 deficit in the seventh inning to win 8–5. Faber went the distance in the clinching Game 6 two days later at the Polo Grounds, picking up his third win of the Series by a 4–2 score. As a consequence, he holds the all-time American League record for pitching decisions in a single World Series with four.

Faber once tried to steal third base when it was already occupied. He said that he saw the lead runner rounding third base on the previous play and he thought that the runner had scored a run. When the pitcher slowly entered his windup, Faber ran toward third base. However, in one game against Boston, he stole home, a rare feat for a pitcher.

Faber spent most of 1918 in the United States Navy due to World War I. He returned in 1919 only to develop arm trouble. He had lost much weight during the war. He finished the year with a 3.83 ERA – the only time in his first nine seasons he posted a mark over 3.00. Those problems, along with a case of the flu possibly related to the Spanish flu pandemic, prevented him from playing in the scandal-torn World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Years later, catcher Ray Schalk said that had Faber been available, the fix would likely have never happened. Had Faber been healthy, he would almost certainly have gotten some of the starts that went to two of the conspirators, Eddie Cicotte and/or Lefty Williams.

===Success in the 1920s===
Faber enjoyed the greatest success of his career in the early 1920s. The live-ball era was beginning, but, thanks to a rule change allowing active 17 spitball pitchers to continue throwing it the remainder of their careers after its 1920 ban, he made one of the most successful transitions of all pitchers. He took advantage of Comiskey Park&#x27;s spacious dimensions, surrendering only 91 home runs—barely one homer per month—from 1920 to 1931. He was one of only six pitchers to win 100 or more games in both the &quot;dead ball&quot; (through 1920) and live ball eras. Faber finished the 1920 season with 23 wins and led the league in games started.

During the summer of 1921, Faber and several other players had to leave a road trip in Washington after receiving subpoenas for the Black Sox trial in Chicago. Faber made the trip but was not asked to testify and returned to the White Sox without missing a start. He won 25 in 1921 and 21 in 1922, leading the league in ERA (1921–1922), innings (1922) and complete games (1921–1922). He was also among the league leaders in strikeouts each year, while pitching at least 25 complete games and over 300 innings.

Faber achieved most of his success with White Sox teams that were usually barely competitive. They had been one of the top teams in the league in the late 1910s, with a powerful offense. After much of the core of that team was permanently banned in the Black Sox Scandal, the White Sox had only two winning seasons in Faber&#x27;s last 13 years, never finishing above fifth place. In the season, Faber posted a terrific 25–15 win–loss record for a scandal-decimated team that limped to a 62–92 finish; from 1921 to 1929 his record was 126–103. In 1927 Faber broke up a 21-game hitting streak by a still capable 40-year-old Ty Cobb. Perhaps his last great performance was a one-hitter at age 40 in .

===Later career===
In his last few seasons, Faber returned to relief pitching, coming out of the bullpen 96 times between 1931 and 1933. Faber announced his retirement before the 1934 season. He had pitched 20 consecutive years for the White Sox. He ended his career at age 45 with a 254–213 career record, a 3.15 ERA and 1471 strikeouts. He holds the White Sox franchise record for most games pitched, and held the team records for career wins, starts, complete games and innings until they were later broken by Ted Lyons. After retiring as a player, Faber entered auto sales and real estate. He returned as a White Sox coach for three seasons.

Faber and catcher Ray Schalk started 306 games as a battery, fourth-most of any such duo since 1900.

==Personal life==
In 1947, Faber married Frances (Fran) Knudtzon, who was nearly 30 years younger than he. Faber said that he was too old for her, but she insisted that they get married. Fran was Lutheran and a divorcee, and the couple married quickly, making the marriage unpopular among Faber&#x27;s Catholic family. However, some became more accepting with time. The couple had a son the next year, Urban C. Faber II, nicknamed &quot;Pepper&quot;. When he was 14 he suffered a broken neck in a near-fatal swimming accident, causing long-term health problems.

Faber helped to found Baseball Anonymous, a charitable organization that assisted former baseball players who had run into financial or physical problems. Later he worked on a Cook County highway surveying team until he was nearly 80. He was a longtime smoker, and after suffering two heart attacks in the 1960s began to experience increasing heart and lung issues. He died in Chicago in 1976 and was interred in Acacia Park Cemetery there.

<doc id="639222" wikidata="Q933694" url="?curid=639222" title="Parvovirus B19">
<text>Human parvovirus B19, generally referred to as B19 virus (B19V), parvovirus B19 or sometimes erythrovirus B19, is a known human virus in the family &quot;Parvoviridae&quot;, genus &quot;Erythroparvovirus&quot;; it measures only 23–26 nm in diameter. &quot;Human parvovirus b19&quot; is a below-species classification of &quot;Erythroparvovirus primate1&quot;. The name is derived from Latin &quot;parvum&quot;, meaning small, reflecting the fact that B19 ranks among the smallest DNA viruses. B19 virus is most known for causing disease in the pediatric population; however, it can also affect adults. It is the classic cause of the childhood rash called fifth disease or erythema infectiosum, or &quot;slapped face syndrome&quot;. The name comes from it being the fifth in a list of historical classifications of common skin rash illnesses in children.

The virus was discovered by chance in 1975 by Australian virologist Yvonne Cossart. The name B19 originated from the coding of a serum sample, number 19 in panel B.

==Virology==
Erythroviruses belong to the &quot;Parvoviridae&quot; family of small DNA viruses. Human parvovirus B19 is a non-enveloped, icosahedral virus that contains a single-stranded linear DNA genome of approximately 5,600 base pairs in length. B19V&#x27;s nonenveloped viral particles are ~22 to 24 nm in diameter which are quite small compared to other parvoviruses. The infectious particles may contain either positive or negative strands of DNA. The icosahedral capsid consists of 60 capsomeres, consisting of two structural proteins, VP1 (83 kDa) and VP2 (58 kDa), which are identical except for 227 amino acids at the amino-terminal of the VP1-protein, the so-called VP1-unique region. VP2 is the major capsid protein, and comprises approximately 95% of the total virus particle. VP1-proteins are incorporated into the capsid structure in a non-stoichiometrical relation (based on antibody-binding analysis and X-ray structural analysis the VP1-unique (VP1u) region is assumed to be exposed at the surface of the virus particle. VP1u is located in the N-terminus of the VP1. At each end of the DNA molecule there are palindromic sequences which form &quot;hairpin&quot; loops. The hairpin at the 3&#x27; end serves as a primer for the DNA polymerase. It is classified as an erythrovirus because of its capability to invade red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow. Three genotypes (with subtypes) have been recognised.

The genome of human parvovirus B19 encodes four other proteins in addition to VP1 and VP2 and also some smaller proteins whose function is still unknown. The most notable of these is the large nonstructural protein commonly referred to as NS1. NS1 is a multifunctional protein that has a role in binding and operating on the p6 promoter which gives NS1 the ability to control the transcription of the B19V genome. NS1 sequence-specifically binds and cleaves DNA via restriction endonuclease activity at its N-terminus. NS1 is responsible for the regulation of certain cellular promoters including the p21/WAF1 promoter, and is thought to regulate the virus&#x27; own promoter. The 11 kDa protein encoded by the viral genome has been implicated in viral DNA replication.

The nucleotide substitution rate for total coding DNA has been estimated to be 1.03 (0.6-1.27) x 10−4 substitutions/site/year. This rate is similar to that of other single-stranded DNA viruses. VP2 codons were found to be under purifying selection. In contrast VP1 codons in the unique part of the gene were found to be under diversifying selection. This diversifying selection is consistent with persistent infection as this part of the VP1 protein contains epitopes recognised by the immune system.

Like other nonenveloped DNA viruses, pathogenicity of parvovirus B19 involves binding to host cell receptors, internalization, translocation of the genome to the host nucleus, DNA replication, RNA transcription, assembly of capsids and packaging of the genome, and finally cell lysis with release of the mature virions. In humans the P antigen (also known as globoside) is the cellular receptor for parvovirus B19 virus that causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in children. This infection is sometimes complicated by severe aplastic anemia caused by lysis of early erythroid precursors.

Studies of Parvovirus B19 (B19V) have provided insights into its persistence and integration within human tissues. Analyses revealed that B19V primarily resides in endothelial cells, monocytes, and B cells, with few documented integration events in vivo. Although B19V DNA integration has been observed in vitro, its low prevalence in sampled tissues suggests that alternative mechanisms may contribute to lifelong persistence. In one case involving pulmonary carcinoma, a B19V integration junction was found in the colon, indicating possible interactions with host genomic elements.

===Evolution===

The most recent common ancestor of the extant strains has been dated to about 12,600 years ago. Three genotypes—1, 2 and 3—are recognised. A recombination between types 1 and 3 gave rise to genotype 2 between 5,000 and 6,800 years ago.

==Transmission==
The virus is primarily spread by infected respiratory droplets; however, blood-borne transmission has also been reported. The secondary attack risk for exposed household persons is about 50%, and about half of that for classroom contacts. Transmission can happen from a mother that has B19V infection during pregnancy. The baby can get infected by bloodstream and therefore develop a severe anemia.

==Infectivity and symptoms==
Two out of ten infected people do not experience any symptoms but are still highly infective. The B19V infection starts with flu-like symptoms consisting fever, headache, runny nose, sore throat, joint pain and rash. Symptoms begin some six days after exposure (between 4 and 28 days, with the average being 16 to 17 days) and last about a week. The rash that children experience will appear after few days after the initial symptoms and can spread all over the body.

Infected patients with normal immune systems are contagious before becoming symptomatic, but probably not after. Individuals with B19 IgG antibodies are generally considered immune to recurrent infection, but reinfection is possible in a minority of cases. About half of adults are B19-immune due to a past infection.

Immunocompromised patients (organ transplant, HIV etc.) are prone to complications that affect the nerves, joints or bloodstream.

==Epidemiology==
A significant increase in the number of cases is seen every three to four years; the last epidemic year was 1998. Outbreaks can arise especially in nurseries and schools.

Parvovirus B19 causes an infection in humans only. Cat and dog parvoviruses do not infect humans due to animals having their own parvoviruses. There is always a possibility for a spillover. There is no vaccine available for human parvovirus B19, though attempts have been made to develop one.

==Role in disease==

===Fifth disease===
Fifth disease or &quot;erythema infectiosum&quot; is only one of several expressions of parvovirus B19. The associated bright red rash of the cheeks gives it the nickname &quot;slapped cheek syndrome&quot;. Any age may be affected, although it is most common in children aged six to ten years. It is so named because it was the fifth most common cause of a pink-red infection associated rash to be described by physicians (many of the others, such as measles and rubella, are rare now).

Once infected, patients usually develop the illness after an incubation period of four to fourteen days. The disease commences with high fever and malaise, when the virus is most abundant in the bloodstream, and patients are usually no longer infectious once the characteristic rash of this disease has appeared. The following symptoms are characteristic:
* A usual brief viral prodrome with fever, headache, nausea, diarrhea.
* As the fever breaks, a red rash forms on the cheeks, with relative pallor around the mouth (&quot;slapped cheek rash&quot;), sparing the nasolabial folds, forehead, and mouth.
* &quot;Lace-like, (reticular)&quot; red rash on trunk or extremities then follows the facial rash. Infection in adults usually only involves the reticular rash, with multiple joint pain predominating.
* Exacerbation of rash by sunlight, heat, stress.

===Papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome===
Teenagers or young adults may develop the so-called Papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome. It is a cutaneous condition characterized by pruritus, edema, and erythema of the hands and feet.
In 1996, an association with parvovirus B19 was described, after virus was demonstrated in skin biopsy samples, subsequently corroborated in numerous publications.
===Polyarthropathy syndrome===
Arthralgias and arthritis are commonly reported in association with parvovirus B19 infection in adults in the absence of skin findings, whereas erythema infectiosum is the main symptom observed in children. The occurrence of arthralgia coincides with the initial detection of circulating IgM- and IgG-antibodies against the viral structural proteins VP1 and VP2. Parvovirus B19 infection may affect the development of arthritis. In adults (and perhaps some children), parvovirus B19 can lead to a seronegative arthritis which is usually easily controlled with analgesics. Women are approximately twice as likely as men to experience arthritis after parvovirus infection. Possibly up to 15% of all new cases of arthritis are due to parvovirus, and a history of recent contact with a patient and positive serology generally confirms the diagnosis. This arthritis does not progress to other forms of arthritis. Typically joint symptoms last 1–3 weeks, but in 10–20% of those affected, it may last weeks to months.

A Danish study has links between B19 with polymyalgia rheumatica.

===Aplastic crisis and chronic erythroid hypoplasia===
Although most patients have a decrease of erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) during parvovirus infection, it is most dangerous in patients with pre-existing bone marrow stress, for example sickle cell anemia or hereditary spherocytosis, and are therefore heavily dependent on erythropoiesis due to the reduced lifespan of the red cells. This is termed &quot;aplastic crisis&quot; (also called reticulocytopenia). It is treated with blood transfusion.

Parvovirus B19 is a cause of chronic anemia in individuals with immunodeficiency, receiving immunosuppressive therapy or with HIV infection. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin usually resolves the anemia although relapse can occur. Parvovirus infection may trigger an inflammatory reaction in AIDS patients who have just begun antiretroviral therapy.

===Hydrops fetalis===

Parvovirus infection in pregnant women is associated with hydrops fetalis due to severe fetal anemia, sometimes leading to miscarriage or stillbirth. This is due to a combination of hemolysis of the red blood cells, as well as the virus directly negatively affecting the red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow. The risk of fetal loss is about 10% if infection occurs before pregnancy week 20 (especially between weeks 14 and 20), but minimal after then. Routine screening of the antenatal sample would enable the pregnant mother to determine the risk of infection. Knowledge of her status would allow the mother to avoid contact with individuals suspected or known to have an ongoing infection, however, at the present time, antenatal testing for immunity is not recommended, since there is no good means to prevent the infection, there is no specific therapy and there are no vaccines available. It may increase maternal anxiety and fear without proven benefit. The best approach would be to recommend all pregnant women to avoid contact with children with current symptoms of infection, as described above. The risk to the fetus will be reduced with correct diagnosis of the anemia (by ultrasound scans) and treatment (by blood transfusions). There is some evidence that intrauterine parvovirus B19 infection leads to developmental abnormalities in childhood.

==Treatment==
At the moment, there are no treatments that directly target parvovirus B19 virus. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) therapy has been a popular alternative because doctors can administer it without stopping chemotherapy drugs like MEL-ASCT. Also, the treatment&#x27;s side effects are rare as only 4 out of 133 patients had complications (2 had acute kidney injury and 2 had pulmonary edema) even though 69 of the patients had organ transplants and 39 of them were HIV positive. This is a large improvement over administering rituximab. The monoclonal antibody against the CD20 protein has been shown to cause acute hepatitis, neutropenia via parvovirus B19 reactivations, and even persistent parvovirus B19 infection. However, it is important to note that IVIG therapy is not perfect as 34% of treated patients will have a relapse after 4 months.

=== Diagnostics and Vaccination ===
There is no routine laboratory test for B19V, but in case of the doctor is suspecting a B19V infection patient&#x27;s blood will be drawn. The blood is then tested for antibodies.

As of 2020, no approved human vaccine existed against parvovirus B19. Bernstein et. al. tested in 2011 a possible candidate vaccine that was produced in insect cells. For the vaccine VP2/VP1 VLPs (virus-like particle) were used. This vaccine was approved to the I clinical phase, but was stopped due to unexplained reactions in patients. It was argued that the reaction could have been due to the PLA2 activity in VP1u. The reaction was either to the PLA2 activity releasing arachidonic acid and precursors of inflammatory mediators or the usage of insect cells. The PLA2 activity can be reduced or fully removed with site-directed mutagenesis. So this could still act as a candidate vaccine, but further research is needed.

<doc id="639223" wikidata="Q1249066" url="?curid=639223" title="Quincunx (Roman coin)">
<text>The quincunx was a bronze coin minted during the Roman Republic. It was not part of the standard coinage of the Roman monetary system. The quincunx was produced only during the Second Punic War (218 to 204 BC), by mints at Luceria (mod. Lucera), Teate (mod. Chieti), Larinum (mod. Larino), and northern Apulia. After the defeat of Cannae during the Second Punic War, a coin with the same value was minted in Capua.

The word &quot;quincunx&quot; comes from Latin &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;five&quot; and &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;one-twelfth&quot;, since the coin was valued at five-twelfths of a bronze &quot;as&quot; (also called a &quot;libra&quot;).

Its value was sometimes represented by a pattern of five dots arranged at the corners and the center of a square, like the pips of a die. So, this pattern also came to be called quincunx.

<text>The Barber of Seville or the Useless Precaution () is a French play by Pierre Beaumarchais, with original music by Antoine-Laurent Baudron. It was initially conceived as an &quot;opéra comique&quot;, and was rejected as such in 1772 by the Comédie-Italienne. The play as it is now known was written in 1773, but, due to legal and political problems of the author, it was not performed until February 23, 1775, at the Comédie-Française in the Tuileries. It is the first play in a trilogy of which the other constituents are &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and &quot;The Guilty Mother&quot;.

Though the play was poorly received at first, Beaumarchais worked some fast editing of the script, turning it into a roaring success after three days. The play&#x27;s title might be a pun on Tirso de Molina&#x27;s earlier play &quot;El Burlador de Sevilla&quot; (&quot;The Trickster of Seville&quot;). 

Mozart wrote a set of 12 variations, K.354, on one of Baudron&#x27;s songs, &quot;&quot;.

== Synopsis ==

The story follows a traditional &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; structure, with many characters seemingly based on famous stock characters. The plot involves a Spanish count, called simply The Count, although &quot;Almaviva&quot; appears as an additional name (whether it is a first name or a surname is not clear), who has fallen in love at first sight with a girl called Rosine. To ensure that she really loves him and not just his money, the Count disguises himself as a poor college student named Lindor, and attempts to woo her. His plans are foiled by Rosine&#x27;s guardian, Doctor Bartholo, who keeps her locked up in his house and intends to marry her himself. The Count&#x27;s luck changes, however, after a chance reunion with an ex-servant of his, Figaro, who is currently working as a barber and therefore has access to the Doctor&#x27;s home. After being promised money, and afraid the Count will seek revenge on him if he refuses, Figaro devises a variety of ways for the Count and Rosine to meet and talk, first as Lindor, then as Alonzo, a fellow student of the same music master, Bazile. The story culminates in the marriage of the Count and Rosine.

===Act 1===

Scene: the street in front of Dr. Bartholo&#x27;s house in Seville. The Count, disguised as a poor university student, waits in hope of catching a glimpse of Rosine, whom he encountered in Madrid and has followed to Seville. To this point they have never spoken to each other. Figaro happens to come down the street, singing a song (&quot;Bannissons le chagrin&quot;); he and the Count recognize each other. While the two men talk, Dr. Bartholo and Rosine come to a window of the house. Rosine pretends to drop a piece of sheet music from her window inadvertently. While the doctor is coming down the stairs to retrieve it, Rosine instructs the Count to pick up the sheet himself. He does, and finds a note from Rosine hidden inside it; in the note she asks him to explain who he is and why he has followed her to Seville, by way of singing his answer to the tune of the song. Figaro tells the Count that Rosine is the ward of Dr. Bartholo, and adds that as he is the doctor&#x27;s barber and apothecary, he frequents the house. He proposes a plan to smuggle the Count into the house by disguising him as a drunken soldier in need of lodging.

The two are interrupted when they overhear Dr. Bartholo making plans to secretly marry Rosine during the night, before he leaves to see his friend Bazile, who is to make the arrangements. Afterwards, the Count sings to Rosine (&quot;Vous l&#x27;ordonnez, je me ferai connaître... Je suis Lindor&quot;), introducing himself as a poor man named Lindor who is in love with her. From inside the house, Rosine sings a verse to the tune of &quot;Maître en droit&quot;, requiting his affections, before she is caught by someone else inside and is forced to retreat. Figaro and the Count go their separate ways, agreeing to meet again to put their plan in action.

===Act 2===

In Dr. Bartholo&#x27;s house, Rosine writes a note to &quot;Lindor&quot;. When Figaro drops in, she asks if he will deliver the note. Figaro agrees. The moment he steps out, Dr. Bartholo comes in, complaining that Figaro has given incapacitating medical treatments to all the servants. He notices ink stains on Rosine&#x27;s fingers; suspicious, he demands to know what she wrote. When she continues to deny writing anything, he accuses Figaro of having seduced her. Rosine leaves. Figaro is shown to be hiding in a cabinet. He listens as Bartholo and Bazile discuss the inquiries Count Almaviva has been making all over town about Rosine. They hatch a plan to spread malicious gossip about the Count so that if he ever should find her, she will be too disgusted with him to want to form a relationship.

They leave. Figaro goes to Rosine and warns her that Bartholo plans to force her to marry him before morning. At this point the Count enters disguised as an inebriated soldier, and sings a song to the tune of &quot;Vive le vin&quot;. He presents a forged lodging billet. The doctor explains he is exempted from the law that requires people to lodge soldiers. When he goes to find the paperwork that certifies this, the Count slips a note to Rosine. The doctor returns and sends the Count away. He sees Rosine with the note and demands she show it to him; but she is able to switch it with an innocent letter that extinguishes Bartholo&#x27;s fears. Rosine reads the actual note, which contains instructions for her to start a fight with Bartholo.

===Act 3===

The Count comes to the house again, disguised this time as a teacher. He tells Bartholo that Bazile is sick and has sent him as a substitute to give Rosine her music lesson for the day. Rosine enters pretending to be quite angry, having chosen the music lesson as an excuse to pick a fight with Bartholo. She recognizes the Count (&quot;Lindor&quot;) and becomes calm. The Count accompanies Rosine on the piano as she sings (&quot;Quand, dans la plaine&quot;). Lulled by the music, Bartholo keeps falling asleep; each time he does so the Count begins kissing Rosine, the music stops and the Doctor wakes up, forcing Rosine and the Count to scurry back to their music, and the &quot;lazzo&quot; repeats. After the lesson, the doctor sings his own song to Rosine (&quot;Veux-tu, ma Rosinette&quot;). Figaro arrives and tries to distract Dr. Bartholo by shaving him so that Rosine and the Count will be alone together, but Bartholo catches on, especially when Bazile arrives to give Rosine her music lesson. The Count discreetly hands Bazile a bag of money, bribing him to play along, and they are able to settle the doctor&#x27;s fears once more. The Count tells Rosine he will return at night to visit.

===Act 4===

The stage is dark and music suggesting a lightning storm is played. Bazile admits to Bartholo what happened earlier in the day, and speculates that the man in the house may have been the Count. He advises against Bartholo&#x27;s plan to force a marriage with Rosine, but Bartholo takes no heed. Rosine then comes out, looking for the Count; Bartholo goes to her and tells her that the man in the house was working for a notorious womanizing count named Almaviva, who plans to have his agents kidnap her. Rosine believes this story and becomes outraged. She agrees to marry Bartholo, and he goes out to find a judge to perform the marriage ceremony. Rosine runs to lock herself in Marceline&#x27;s room to avoid the impending abduction she expects.

Figaro and the Count break into the house, discussing the Count&#x27;s plan to propose marriage to Rosine, and worrying about how to break the news that he is really a count. Rosine comes back out to yell at him, and tell him she knows all about his horrible scheme to kidnap her: she notices that Figaro keeps addressing him as &quot;my lord&quot;, however, and inquires as to the reason. The Count then reveals his true identity, and Rosine forgives him. The Judge enters, and the Count takes him and has him draw up a marriage contract between himself and Rosine. Bartholo comes in just a moment after it is signed, and after making some futile arguments against the contract&#x27;s validity, resigns himself. As a consolation he is given Rosine&#x27;s dowry money to keep.

== Operas ==
Beaumarchais&#x27;s play has been adapted into several operas, most of them forgotten today. Giovanni Paisiello&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, dramma giocoso in four acts first performed in 1782, is probably the earliest opera adaptation still occasionally heard in the repertoire. The most famous opera adaptation is Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, &quot;commedia&quot; in two acts premiered in 1816. Despite the opera’s disastrous premiere its popularity even overshadows Beaumarchais&#x27; original play. Other lesser-known adaptions include those by Nicolas Isouard in 1796, Alexander Reinagle, Samuel Arnold in 1794, and Francesco Morlacchi in 1816.

==Character of Figaro==

Figaro is inspired by the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; character of Brighella, and like his predecessor he is a clever liar; moral and yet unscrupulous; good humored, helpful and brave, though somewhat embittered and cynical. As he says in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;: &quot;I must force myself to laugh at everything lest I be obliged to weep.&quot; Though he is normally calm, collected and intelligent, he can be irrational when angered.
The name &quot;Figaro&quot; was invented by Beaumarchais for this character, and it has been theorized by Frédéric Grendel that it is made from a phonetic transcription of the words &quot;fils Caron&quot; (Caron having been the given surname of the playwright).

The role was created in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; by Beaumarchais&#x27;s friend Préville. When &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; went into production almost a decade later, however, he felt himself too old to repeat the part and turned it over to fellow actor Jean Dazincourt.

According to the information Figaro gives at various points throughout the plays, his life story appears to be thus: he was the illegitimate son of Dr. Bartholo and his maid Marceline, and presumably therefore given his mother&#x27;s family name, was born Emmanuel de Verte-Allure. He was kidnapped as a baby and raised by gypsies, who are probably the ones that renamed him Figaro. After he grew &quot;disgusted with their ways&quot; he left to become a surgeon, and apparently took up a short-term job in the household of Count Almaviva during this time to support himself. Though the Count referred to him as a &quot;rather bad servant,&quot; he was pleased enough with Figaro to write him a recommendation to the Bureau in Madrid, where he was given a job as an assistant veterinary surgeon, much to his disappointment. While working there, he began dabbling in a literary career, apparently with great success. He was fired from the Bureau but stayed on in Madrid for a time trying to work as a publisher and playwright. He angered the censors with several of his works, and was briefly imprisoned. Eventually he gave up writing, and set himself up as a barber surgeon. After &quot;pensively proceeding through the two Castilles, la Mancha, Extremadura, the Sierra Morena, and Andalusia&quot; he set up shop in Seville, where he became reacquainted with Count Almaviva, and after assisting him with some romantic troubles, was hired as the Count&#x27;s personal valet. He evidently retains this position for the remainder of his life. It is after he returns to work for the Count that he marries Suzanne, though at what point he met her is unclear. Given that Suzanne&#x27;s uncle Antonio works for the Count, it seems likely she was hired on his recommendation when the Countess moved into the palace and a maid was needed for her, in which case she and Figaro would have met after the events of &quot;The Barber of Seville.&quot; 

In &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, Rosine claims that Figaro has a daughter, but because this is never mentioned again by any other characters or in the other plays, and because it comes up during a lie Rosine tells to conceal her relationship with the Count, it is probable that she made this up. In &quot;The Guilty Mother&quot;, the children of the Count and Countess are named, but no offspring from Figaro or Suzanne are referenced, which suggests they remain childless.

<text>Religions with the belief in a final judgment, a resurrection of the dead or an intermediate state (such as Hades or purgatory) often offer prayers on behalf of the dead to God.

==Buddhism==
For most funerals that follow the tradition of Chinese Buddhism, common practices include chanting the name of Amitabha, or reciting Buddhist scriptures such as the Sutra of The Great Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, Amitabha Sutra, Diamond Sutra or a combination of classic Buddhist scriptures, such as the Great Compassion Mantra, the Heart Sutra, the Amitabha Pure Land Rebirth Mantra and Sapta Atitabuddha Karasaniya Dharani (or &quot;Qi Fo Mie Zui Zhen Yan&quot; 七佛滅罪真言).

Other practices include Ritsu offer refuge, Pure Land Buddhists nianfo or chant Pure Land Rebirth Dhāraṇī and Tibetan Buddhists chant Om mani padme hum repeatedly. Prayers such as Namo Ratnasikhin Tathagata are for animals.

==Christianity==

===New Testament===
A passage in the New Testament which is seen by some to be a prayer for the dead is found in , which reads as follows:
:May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord&#x27;s mercy on that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.

As with the verses in , these verses reflect the deep-felt desire that God will deal mercifully with the deceased &quot;on that day&quot; (perhaps Judgement Day, see also Eschatology). It is not stated that Onesiphorus, for whom Saint Paul or the writer of the epistle prayed, was dead, though some scholars infer this, based on the way this only refers to him in the past tense, and prays for present blessings on his household, but for him only &quot;on that day&quot;. And towards the end of the same letter, in , we find a greeting to &quot;Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus&quot;, distinguishing the situation of Onesiphorus from that of the still living Prisca and Aquila.

===Tradition===
Prayer for the dead is well documented within early Christianity, both among prominent Church Fathers and the Christian community in general. In the Catholic Church the assistance that the dead receive by prayer on their behalf is linked with the process of purification known as purgatory. In Eastern Orthodoxy, Christians pray for &quot;such souls as have departed with faith, but without having had time to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance&quot;. While prayer for the dead continues in both these traditions and in those of Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East, many Protestant groups reject the practice.

The tomb of the Christian Abercius of Hieropolis in Phrygia (latter part of the 2nd century) bears the inscription: &quot;Let every friend who observes this pray for me&quot;, i.e. Abercius, who throughout speaks in the first person.

The inscriptions in the Roman catacombs bear similar witness to the practice, by the occurrence of such phrases as:
*&quot;Mayst thou live among the saints&quot; (3rd century);
*&quot;May God refresh the soul of ... ;&quot;
*&quot;Peace be with them&quot;.

Among Church writers Tertullian († 230) is the first to mention prayers for the dead: &quot;The widow who does not pray for her dead husband has as good as divorced him&quot;. This passage occurs in one of his later writings, dating from the beginning of the 3rd century. Subsequent writers similarly make mention of the practice as prevalent, not as unlawful or even disputed (until Arius challenged it towards the end of the 4th century). The most famous instance is Saint Augustine&#x27;s prayer for his mother, Monica, at the end of the 9th book of his &quot;Confessions&quot;, written around 398.

An important element in the Christian liturgies both East and West consisted of the diptychs, or lists of names of living and dead commemorated at the Eucharist. To be inserted in these lists was a confirmation of one&#x27;s orthodoxy, and out of the practice grew the official canonization of saints; on the other hand, removal of a name was a condemnation.

In the middle of the 3rd century, St. Cyprian enjoined that there should be no oblation or public prayer made for a deceased layman who had broken the Church&#x27;s rule by appointing a cleric trustee under his will: &quot;He ought not to be named in the priests prayer who has done his best to detain the clergy from the altar.&quot;

Although it is not possible, as a rule, to name dates for the exact words used in the ancient liturgies, yet the universal occurrence of these diptychs and of definite prayers for the dead in all parts of the Christian Church, East and West, in the 4th and 5th centuries shows how primitive such prayers were. The language used in the prayers for the departed is asking for rest and freedom from pain and sorrow. A passage from the Liturgy of St James reads:
Remember, O Lord, the God of Spirits and of all Flesh, those whom we have remembered and those whom we have not remembered, men of the true faith, from righteous Abel unto to-day; do thou thyself give them rest there in the land of the living, in thy kingdom, in the delight of Paradise, in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, our holy fathers, from whence pain and sorrow and sighing have fled away, where the light of thy countenance visiteth them and always shineth upon them.

Public prayers were only offered for those who were believed to have died as faithful members of the Church. But Saint Perpetua, who was martyred in 202, believed herself to have been encouraged in a vision to pray for her brother, who had died in his eighth year, almost certainly unbaptized; and a later vision assured her that her prayer was answered and he had been translated from punishment. St. Augustine thought it needful to point out that the narrative was not canonical Scripture, and contended that the child had perhaps been baptized.

===Catholic Church===
In the West there is ample evidence of the custom of praying for the dead in the inscriptions of the catacombs, with their constant prayers for the peace and refreshment of the souls of the departed and in the early liturgies, which commonly contain commemorations of the dead; and Tertullian, Cyprian and other early Western Fathers witness to the regular practice of praying for the dead among the early Christians.

However, in the case of martyred Christians, it was felt that it was inappropriate to pray &quot;for&quot; the martyrs, since they were believed to be in no need of such prayers, having instantly passed to the beatific vision of Heaven. Theoretically, too, prayer for those in hell (understood as the abode of the eternally lost) would be useless. However, since there is no certainty that any particular person is in hell, prayers are offered for all the dead, except for those believed to be in heaven who are prayed to, not for. In , there is usually reference to them being in purgatory. In view of the certainty that by the process of purification and with the help of the prayers of the faithful they were destined for heaven, they are referred to as the &quot;holy souls&quot;.

Limits were placed on public offering of Mass for the unbaptised, non-Catholics, and notorious sinners, but prayers and even Mass in private could be said for them. The present Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church states that, unless the person concerned gave some signs of repentance before death, no form of funeral Mass may be offered for notorious apostates, heretics and schismatics; for those who for anti-Christian motives chose that their bodies be cremated; and for other manifest sinners to whom a Church funeral could not be granted without public scandal to the faithful.

On the other hand, &quot;provided their own minister is not available, baptised persons belonging to a non-catholic Church or ecclesial community may, in accordance with the prudent judgement of the local Ordinary, be allowed Church funeral rites, unless it is established that they did not wish this.&quot;

During the slaughter of the First World War, Pope Benedict XV on 10 August 1915 allowed all priests everywhere to say three Masses on All Souls&#x27; Day. The two extra Masses were in no way to benefit the priest himself: one was to be offered for all the faithful departed, the other for the Pope&#x27;s intentions, which at that time were presumed to be for all the victims of that war. The permission remains.

Each Eucharistic Prayer, including the Roman Canon of the Order of Mass, has a prayer for the departed.

In &quot;Communio Sanctorum&quot;, the Lutheran and Catholic Churches in Germany agreed that prayer for the dead &quot;corresponds to the communion in which we are bound together in Christ ... with those who have already died to pray for them and to commend them ... to the mercy of God.&quot; Likewise, in the United States, the Evangelical Lutheran Church and Catholic Church formulated a statement &quot;The Hope of Eternal Life&quot;, which affirmed that &quot;there is communion among the living and the dead across the divide of death. ...Prayerful commendation of the dead to God is salutary within a funeral liturgy. ...Insofar as the resurrection of the dead and the general final judgment are future events, it is appropriate to pray for God&#x27;s mercy for each person, entrusting that one to God&#x27;s mercy.&quot;

===Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy===

====Theology====
Eastern and Oriental Orthodox reject the term &quot;purgatory&quot;. Prayer for the dead is encouraged in the belief that it is helpful for them, although &quot;how&quot; the prayers of the faithful help the departed is not elucidated. Eastern Orthodox simply believe that tradition teaches &quot;that&quot; prayers should be made for the dead.

Saint Basil the Great (379 CE) writes in his Third Kneeling Prayer at Pentecost: &quot;O Christ our God ... (who) on this all-perfect and saving Feast, art graciously pleased to accept propitiatory prayers for those who are imprisoned in hades, promising unto us who are held in bondage great hope of release from the vilenes that doth hinder us and did hinder them, ... send down Thy consolation ... and establish their souls in the mansions of the Just; and graciously vouchsafe unto them peace and pardon; for not the dead shall praise thee, O Lord, neither shall they who are in Hell make bold to offer unto thee confession. But we who are living will bless thee, and will pray, and offer unto thee propitiatory prayers and sacrifices for their souls.&quot;

Saint Gregory Dialogus († 604) in his famous &quot;Dialogues&quot; (written in 593) teaches that, &quot;The Holy Sacrifice (Eucharist) of Christ, our saving Victim, brings great benefits to souls even after death, provided their sins (are such as) can be pardoned in the life to come.&quot; However, St. Gregory goes on to say, the Church&#x27;s practice of prayer for the dead must not be an excuse for not living a godly life on earth. &quot;The safer course, naturally, is to do for ourselves during life what we hope others will do for us after death.&quot; Father Seraphim Rose († 1982) says: &quot;The Church&#x27;s prayer cannot save anyone who does not wish salvation, or who never offered any struggle (podvig) for it himself during his lifetime.&quot;

====Eastern Orthodox praxis====
The various prayers for the departed have as their purpose to pray for the repose of the departed, to comfort the living, and to remind those who remain of their own mortality. For this reason, memorial services have an air of penitence about them.

The Church&#x27;s prayers for the dead begin at the moment of death, when the priest leads the &quot;Prayers at the Departure of the Soul&quot;, consisting of a special Canon and prayers for the release of the soul. Then the body is washed, clothed and laid in the coffin, after which the priest begins the &quot;First Panikhida&quot; (prayer service for the departed). After the First Panikhida, the family and friends begin reading the Psalter aloud beside the casket. This reading continues and concludes until the next morning, in which usually the funeral is held, up until the time of the &quot;orthros&quot;.

Orthodox Christians offer particularly fervent prayers for the departed on the first 40 days after death. Traditionally, in addition to the service on the day of death, the memorial service is performed at the request of the relatives of an individual departed person on the following occasions:
*Third day after death
*Ninth day
*Fortieth day
*First anniversary of death
*Third anniversary (some will request a memorial every year on the anniversary of death)

In addition to Panikhidas for individuals, there are also several days during the year that are set aside as special general commemorations of the dead, when all departed Orthodox Christians will be prayed for together (this is especially to benefit those who have no one on earth to pray for them). The majority of these general commemorations fall on the various &quot;Soul Saturdays&quot; throughout the year (mostly during Great Lent). On these days, in addition to the normal Panikhida, there are special additions to Vespers and Matins, and there will be propers for the departed added to the Divine Liturgy. These days of general memorial are:
*Meatfare Saturday (two Saturdays before Great Lent begins); in some traditions families and friends will offer Panikhidas for their loved ones during the week, culminating in the general commemoration on Saturday
*The second Saturday of Great Lent
*The third Saturday of Great Lent
*The fourth Saturday of Great Lent
*Radonitsa (the second Tuesday after Easter)
*The Saturday before Pentecost; in some traditions families and friends will offer Panikhidas for their loved ones during the week, culminating in the general commemoration on Saturday
*Demetrius Saturday (the Saturday before the feast of Saint Demetrius, October 26). In the Bulgarian Orthodox Church there is a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday before the feast of Saint Michael the Archangel, November 8, instead of the Demetrius Soul Saturday.

The most important form of prayer for the dead occurs in the Divine Liturgy. Particles are cut from the prosphoron during the Proskomedie at the beginning of the Liturgy. These particles are placed beneath the Lamb (Host) on the diskos, where they remain throughout the Liturgy. After the Communion of the faithful, the deacon brushes these particles into the chalice, saying, &quot;Wash away, O Lord, the sins of all those here commemorated, by Thy Precious Blood, through the prayers of all thy saints.&quot; Of this action, Saint Mark of Ephesus says, &quot;We can do nothing better or greater for the dead than to pray for them, offering commemoration for them at the Liturgy. Of this they are always in need. ...The body feels nothing then: it does not see its close ones who have assembled, does not smell the fragrance of the flowers, does not hear the funeral orations. But the soul senses the prayers offered for it and is grateful to those who make them and is spiritually close to them.&quot;

Normally, candidates for sainthood, prior to their Glorification (Canonization) as a saint, will be commemorated by serving Panikhidas. Then, on the eve of their Glorification will be served an especially solemn Requiem, known as the &quot;Last Panikhida&quot;.

=== Lutheran Church ===
The Lutheran Reformers recognized that the early Church had practiced prayer for the dead, and accepted it in principle. Thus in the 1580 Book of Concord, the Lutheran Church taught:

&quot;... we know that the ancients speak of prayer for the dead, which we do not prohibit; but we disapprove of the application &quot;ex opere operato&quot; of the Lord&#x27;s Supper on behalf of the dead.&quot;

The Lutheran cleric Richard Futrell wrote that &quot;The historic practice within the Lutheran Church had prayers for the dead in their Prayer of the Church. For example, if we were to look at a typical Lutheran service during Luther’s lifetime, we would find in the Prayer of the Church not only intercessions, special prayers, and the Lord’s Prayer, which are still typical today in Lutheran worship, but also prayers for the dead.&quot; For those who have died, Martin Luther declared that &#x27;I regard it as no sin to pray with free devotion in this or some similar fashion: &quot;Dear God, if this soul is in a condition accessible to mercy, be thou gracious to it.&quot; (&quot;Luther’s Works&quot;, Volume 37) To console women whose children were not born and baptized, Martin Luther wrote in 1542: &quot;In summary, see to it that above all else you are a true Christian and that you teach a heartfelt yearning and praying to God in true faith, be it in this or in any other trouble. Then do not be dismayed about your child or yourself. Know that your prayer is pleasing to God and that God will do everything much better than you can comprehend or desire. &#x27;Call upon me,&#x27; he says in Psalm 50. &#x27;In the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.&#x27; For this reason, we ought not to condemn such infants. Believers and Christians have devoted their longing and yearning and praying for them.&quot; However, with regard to what he perceived as nonscriptural extensions of the practice (such as repeated Requiem Masses for the dead), in the same year 1542 he stated in his &quot;Preface to the Burial Hymns&quot;: &quot;Accordingly, we have removed from our churches and completely abolished the popish abominations, such as vigils, Masses for the dead, processions, purgatory, and all other hocus-pocus on behalf of the dead&quot;.

The largest Lutheran denomination in the United States, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, &quot;remembers the faithful departed in the Prayers of the People every Sunday, including those who have recently died and those commemorated on the church calendar of saints&quot;. In Funeral rites of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, &quot;deceased are prayed for&quot; using &quot;commendations: &#x27;keep our sister/brother ... in the company of all your saints. And at the last ... raise her/him up to share with all the faithful the endless joy and peace won through the glorious resurrection of Christ our Lord.&#x27;&quot; The response for these prayers for the dead in this Lutheran liturgy is the prayer of Eternal Rest: &quot;Rest eternal grant him/her, O Lord; and let light perpetual shine upon him/her&quot;.

The most recent edition of Luther&#x27;s &quot;Small Catechism&quot; widely used among communicants of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) recommends:

This question and answer do not appear in Luther&#x27;s original text, but reflect the views of the twentieth-century Lutherans who added this explanation to the catechism. The LCMS does not prohibit the practice of praying for the dead, however, and has continued the practice, most notably on All Saint&#x27;s Day where the church prays:

The conservative Lutheran denomination WELS teaches:

=== Anglicanism ===
The Church of England&#x27;s 1549 Book of Common Prayer still had prayer for the dead, as (in the Communion Service): &quot;We commend into thy mercy all other thy servants, which are departed hence from us with the sign of faith and now do rest in the sleep of peace: grant unto them, we beseech thee, thy mercy and everlasting peace.&quot; But since 1552 the Book of Common Prayer has no express prayers for the dead, and the practice is denounced in the Homily &quot;On Prayer&quot; (part 3). Nonjurors included prayers for the dead, a practice that spread within the Church of England in the mid-nineteenth century, and was authorized in 1900 for forces serving in South Africa and since then in other forms of service. Many jurisdictions and parishes of the Anglo-Catholic tradition continue to practice prayer for the dead, including offering the Sunday liturgy for the peace of named departed Christians and keeping All Souls&#x27; Day.

The 1979 Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church (United States) includes prayers for the dead. The prayers during the Sunday Eucharistic Liturgy include intercessions for the repose of the faithful departed. Furthermore, most of the prayers in the burial rite are for the deceased, including the opening collect: O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered: Accept our prayers on behalf of thy servant &quot;N.,&quot; and grant &quot;him&quot; an entrance into the land of light and joy, in the fellowship of thy saints; through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.According to the Catechism in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, &quot;We pray for (the dead), because we still hold them in our love, and because we trust that in God&#x27;s presence those who have chosen to serve him will grow in his love, until they see him as he is.&quot; Although this statement indicates that prayer is typically made for those who are known to have been members of the Church (&quot;those who have chosen to serve him&quot;), prayer is also offered for those whose faith was uncertain or unknown – authorized options in the Prayer Book burial rite allow for prayers that thus entrust the deceased to the mercy of God while retaining integrity about what was known of the deceased&#x27;s religious life. For example, following the intercessions, there are two options for a concluding prayer: the first begins, &quot;Lord Jesus Christ, we commend to you our brother (sister) &quot;N.,&quot; who was reborn by water and the Spirit in Holy Baptism ...&quot;; the second, however, would be appropriate for one whose faith and standing before God is not known:Father of all, we pray to you for &quot;N.,&quot; and for all those whom we love but see no longer. Grant to them eternal rest. Let light perpetual shine upon them. May &quot;his&quot; soul and the souls of all the departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen. 

=== Methodist Church ===
John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, stated that: &quot;I believe it to be a duty to observe, to pray for the Faithful Departed&quot;. He &quot;taught the propriety of Praying for the Dead, practised it himself, provided &quot;Forms&quot; that others might.&quot; Two such prayers in the &quot;Forms&quot; are &quot;O grant that we, with those who are already dead in Thy faith and fear, may together partake of a joyful resurrection&quot; and also, &quot;By Thy infinite mercies, vouchsafe to bring us, with those that are dead in Thee, to rejoice together before Thee.&quot; As such, many Methodists pray &quot;for those who sleep.&quot; Shane Raynor, a Methodist writer, explains the practice saying that it is &quot;appropriate to pray for others in the community, even across time and space&quot;, referencing the doctrine of Communion of Saints being a &quot;community made up of all past, present, and future Christians&quot;. In a joint statement with the Catholic Church in England and Wales, the Methodist Church of Great Britain affirmed that &quot;Methodists who pray for the dead thereby commend them to the continuing mercy of God.&quot;

=== Moravian Church ===
In its Easter liturgy, the Moravian Church prays for those &quot;departed in the faith of Christ&quot; and &quot;give[s] thanks for their holy departure&quot;.

=== Reformed Churches ===
Reformed churches are often opposed to prayer for the dead, because it is seen as useless. However, the Presbyterian Church USA has a &quot;commemoration of those who have died in the faith.&quot; They are not petitions for the dead but reminders that the church on earth is a part of a larger company of saints with the church in heaven. Other prayers combine thanksgivings for the dead with petitions for the living.

=== Irvingian Churches ===
The New Apostolic Church, the largest of the Irvingian Churches, practices prayer for the dead. Divine Services for the faithful departed take place thrice a year; additionally, &quot;New Apostolic Christians also pray that souls who have died in an unredeemed state may find salvation in Christ.&quot;

=== Other churches ===
Prayer for the dead is not practiced by members of Baptist and nondenominational Christian churches. For example, members of the Baptist churches hold that &quot;dead men receive no benefit from the prayers, sacrifices, &amp;c. of the living.&quot;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a number of sacred ordinances and rituals that are performed for the dead. Among these are baptism for the dead and the sealing of the dead to families. These practices are based upon multiple New Testament scriptures, some of which are 1 Corinthians 15:29-32 and Matthew 16:19.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism there are funeral speeches with prayers for the dead. Many of these funeral speeches are read out from the Mahabharata, usually in Sanskrit. Family members will pray around the body as soon as possible after death. People try to avoid touching the corpse as it is considered polluting.

== Islam ==

In Islam, Muslims of their community gather to their collective prayers for the forgiveness of the dead, a prayer is recited and this prayer is known as the Salat al-Janazah (Janazah prayer). Like Eid prayer, the Janazah prayer incorporates an additional (four) Takbirs, the Arabic name for the phrase Allahu Akbar, but there is no Ruku&#x27; (bowing) and Sujud (prostrating). Supplication for the deceased and mankind is recited. In extraordinary circumstances, the prayer can be postponed and prayed at a later time as was done in the Battle of Uhud.

Dogma states it is obligatory for every Muslim adult male to perform the funeral prayer upon the death of any Muslim, but the dogma embraces the practical in that it qualifies: when Janazah is performed by the few it alleviates that obligation for all.

In addition, &quot;Peace be upon him&quot; (sometimes abbreviated in writing as PBUH) is a constantly repeated prayer for dead people such as prophet Mohammed.

== Judaism ==

Prayers for the dead form part of the Jewish services. The prayers offered on behalf of the deceased consist of: Recitation of Psalms; Reciting a thrice daily communal prayer in Aramaic which is known as &quot;Kaddish&quot;. &quot;Kaddish&quot; actually means &quot;Sanctification&quot; (or &quot;Prayer of Making Holy&quot;) which is a prayer &quot;In Praise of God&quot;; or other special remembrances known as &quot;Yizkor&quot;; and also a &quot;Hazkara&quot; which is said either on the annual commemoration known as the &quot;Yahrzeit&quot; as well on Jewish holidays. The form in use in England contains the following passage: &quot;Have mercy upon him; pardon all his transgressions. ...Shelter his soul in the shadow of Thy wings. Make known to him the path of life.&quot;

&quot;El Maleh Rachamim&quot; is the actual Jewish prayer for the dead, although less well known than the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish. While the Kaddish does not mention death but rather affirms the steadfast faith of the mourners in God&#x27;s goodness, &quot;El Maleh Rachamim&quot; is a prayer for the rest of the departed. There are various translations for the original Hebrew which vary significantly. One version reads:
A record of Jewish prayer and offering of sacrifice for the dead at the time of the Maccabees is seen being referred to in 2 Maccabees, a book written in Greek, which, though not accepted as part of the Jewish Bible, is regarded as canonical by Eastern Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church:
Jacques Le Goff, French historian and agnostic, concluded: &quot;At the time of Judas Maccabeus – around 170 B.C., a surprisingly innovative period – prayer for the dead was not practiced, but that a century later, it was practiced by certain Jews.&quot;

This extract does not explain on what grounds Le Goff argued that prayer for the dead was not in use in the first half of the 2nd century BC. The account of the action of Judas Maccabaeus was written midway through the second half of the same century, in about 124 BC, and in the view of Philip Schaff its mention of prayer for the dead &quot;seems to imply habit&quot;.

==Mandaeism==

In Mandaeism, the masiqta is a lengthy ceremony for the dead performed over many days. Many prayers from the Qulasta and other Mandaean texts are recited during a masiqta, of which there are several types.

==Baháʼí Faith==
Followers of the Baháʼí Faith believe that the soul continues to progress toward God in the afterlife. In fact, the Baháʼí definition of heaven and hell are nearness and remoteness from God in the afterlife, respectively. The belief is that souls continue their journeys, though can be aided in their progress by the saying of prayers for the departed. Here is a sample of one such prayer:
The Prayer for the Dead is a particular prayer for the departed, said at Baháʼí funerals before interment.

==Taoism==
Taoists chant Qinghuahao (青華誥) or Jiukujing (救苦經).

== Zoroastrianism ==
Zoroastrians chant prayers for the dead in their funeral ceremonies, asking God to forgive the deceased.

==Other religions==
Many spiritual traditions have prayers for the dead as part of their liturgy, whether these prayers are salutational, to welcome the spirits of the deceased, or to remember their names.

African Traditional and Diasporic traditions often have incorporated ancestral veneration practices. In orisha based traditions, the mojuba is the praise chant which praises Olodumare, the orishas, the religious lineage, the blood lineage of ancestors, and the various other beings of the universe.

<doc id="639230" wikidata="Q1068765" url="?curid=639230" title="Bantha">
<text>Banthas are fictional creatures in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. They are large, quadrupedal mammals with long, thick fur, and are first seen in the film &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), where they are used as beasts of burden by Tusken Raiders on the planet Tatooine. They have since been featured in several other &quot;Star Wars&quot; works, including the Special Edition version of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), the prequel films &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) and &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), and the television shows &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, and &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, as well as video games and books.

One of the first creatures introduced in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, banthas were created by George Lucas, who was inspired in part by creatures called Banths in &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot;. Ralph McQuarrie designed the concept art for the banthas, with original sketches depicting them as horse-like creatures before they were changed to be elephant-sized. Art director Leon Erickson led the creation of the bantha costume for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the base of which was an elephant saddle with palm fronds and yak hair to create a shaggy coat, as well as a head mask molded from chicken wire, curved horns made from ventilation tubing, and a tail crafted from wood covered with thick thistles.

The bantha&#x27;s moan was created by sound designer Ben Burtt, who slowed down a bear sound originally collected to help create the voice of the Wookiee character Chewbacca. The banthas in &quot;Star Wars&quot; were portrayed by a female Asian elephant named Mardji, who was provided by the Marine World Africa USA amusement park. Her scenes were filmed in Death Valley National Park in California, and Mardji kept shrugging the heavy costume off her body during filming due to the intense heat.

The elephant&#x27;s gait served as the model for the movement of AT-AT walkers in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), and banthas also inspired the creation of the luggabeast creature in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015) and the Corellian hounds in &quot;&quot; (2018). Banthas that have appeared in subsequent &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and shows were digital creations modeled after the creature from &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The bantha shares characteristics with several real-life animals, including bighorn sheep, muskoxen, woolly mammoths, and domestic yaks, and its use of fur to help insulate itself from excess heat is a trait shared by such animals as the antelope, camel, and jerboa. The bantha has been described as a favorite among fans, as well as the cast and crew of the films; Anthony Daniels, the actor who portrayed C-3PO, called it &quot;one of the best things in the movie&quot;.

==Biology and characteristics==
Banthas are large, quadrupedal mammals with long, thick fur of brown or black. The creatures have long, furry tails, and a pair of spiraling horns extruded from their skulls, which resemble those of the real-life bighorn sheep, as well as the muskox, one of the inspirations behind the bantha. &quot;Star Wars&quot; books and media have established biological details about the bantha that go beyond the creature&#x27;s appearances in the films and television shows. About in height, banthas breathe oxygen, have a lifespan of 80 to 100 years, a gestation period of 30 months, and reach sexual maturation at 20 years of age. They weigh at birth and reach weights of up to at maturity. Banthas are extremely strong, capable of carrying up to 500 kilograms of cargo or an average of five passengers. Their planet of origin is unknown, but since they could be found on most agricultural systems, it was believed early settlers transported them to new worlds. Works of &quot;Star Wars&quot; media have established that bantha remains have been discovered that predate most known species in the franchise.

Although often associated with the planet of Tatooine, banthas can be found on many worlds in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe and have adapted to a variety of climates and terrains, ranging from deserts to tundra. Rather than serving as a hindrance in the heat of the desert planet of Tatooine, bantha fur helped insulate the animal and keep away excess cold or heat. This is a characteristic shared with several real-life desert animals, including the antelope, camel, and jerboa. Since the heat generated by a sun is absorbed by the fur on the bantha&#x27;s back, it prevents the heat from penetrating deeper into the creature&#x27;s skin, helping it survive even in harsh conditions. Science writer Sandhya Ramesh noted that large bodies have greater thermal inertia, meaning the bantha&#x27;s large body would be more difficult to heat them up compared than those of smaller animals, making it well suited to survive in Tatooine&#x27;s harsh environment. Marcus Schneck of &quot;The Patriot-News&quot; has noted the bantha shares similarities to the domestic yak, a bulky, hairy animal used by humans for transportation and food.

Bantha horns grow a new segment each year, and the strength of a given creature&#x27;s horns are indicative of its health and environment: thick, crenellated horns usually signify that the bantha is well fed and healthy, while thin, cracked, or underdeveloped horns indicate the bantha is unhealthy due to drought or famine. Male banthas develop thicker and longer horns than females, and males typically complete two horn spirals over the course of their lifetimes, while females usually only complete one. The horns of male banthas could reach a width of up to 3 meters at the shoulders. Bantha horns sometimes become locked when they fight each other, which can lead to exhaustion and death, particularly in difficult terrains like Tatooine. Banthas have a long tongue that help the animal compensate for its short neck when eating and drinking. The bantha tongue is highly sensitive, structurally complex, and very strong, containing gripping knobs at the end and spiracles along the edges for scenting. The tongue can be used for probing into the ground for food or water, holding and carrying items, and as a signifier for communications with other members of the species. Banthas also have extremely sharp incisors.

Although only one type of bantha is shown in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film (known as a &quot;common bantha&quot;), other media from the franchise have established that multiple sub-species of banthas exist, each varying in size, social behavior, metabolic specifics, and coloration. Among these sub-species are dwarf banthas and dune banthas. Dwarf banthas are smaller and more shy than the common bantha, living in remote outer areas, while dune banthas are more slender and less furry, and able to survive in very high temperatures with relatively little water. The Kashyyyk bantha is a sub-species adapted to survive on the Wookiee planet of Kashyyyk, which lacks the shaggy coat and horns of a common bantha and instead has large bony plates used as battering rams. The Kilian bantha, a type native to the planet Kilia IV, was another sub-species.

==Behavior and culture==
According to &quot;Star Wars&quot; works, banthas are herbivores, with a peaceful and docile manner, surviving on grasses and other native flora. Due to their size and internal reserves, they can survive up to a month without food or water. Highly intelligent creatures, they can be found both in the wild and domesticated. Banthas are extremely social pack animals who travel in herds. which can reach sizes of up to 25 individuals. Banthas are non-confrontational and usually flee when attacked, fighting only when necessary to defend the herd or their young. When they do fight, banthas attack by lowering their heads and ramming their horns against attacks, and adult banthas form a circle around their calves to protect them from threats. Despite their gentle temperaments, the size and strength of banthas often lead them to be used as beasts of burden and animals of war, with riders spurring them to charge at foes and trample them. Banthas have few natural enemies, and the only creature that hunts them for food are krayt dragons, massive carnivorous reptiles even larger in size than banthas.

Banthas in the wild belong to a matriarchal social system, and are led by the oldest, strongest, and most capable female in the herd. Matriarchs are most responsible for protecting the others for dangerous predators, though a lone male bantha often acts as a sentry for the herds. As the matriarch ages, she relinquishes control of the herd to the next qualified female bantha candidate. If a herd grows too large in size, it will occasionally split, with the second-oldest and strongest female becoming the matriarch of the new herd. Banthas treat the remains of their ancestors with a sense of reverence, gathering their bones into special areas known as &quot;bantha graveyards&quot; and fondling the bones with their tongues. Mothers have carried deceased newborn banthas many kilometers to these graveyards. Other species consider it bad luck to enter a bantha graveyard.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; books and media outside the films have established that banthas are an integral part of the culture of Tusken Raiders on Tatooine, with a deep spiritual and emotional connection developing between each bantha and its Tusken rider. When a Tusken Raider reaches age seven, a bantha of the same gender is ceremonially presented to the child as its partner in life. The young Tusken cares for and raises the bantha as it grows, and once it reaches maturity, the Tusken rides it and takes it into the desert for initiatory ceremonies and tasks. When Tusken Raiders marry, the couple&#x27;s banthas also mate, and when the Tusken couple has children the banthas will often produce offspring as well. When a Tusken Raider dies, the bantha is sent into the desert to find another bonding partner; however, the bond between the Tusken and bantha is so strong that banthas would often fall into depression or commit suicide in such cases. Likewise, if a bantha dies before its Tusken Raider, the Tusken clan would cast that Raider into the desert on a vision quest, to either die in isolation or be adopted by another wild bantha. If the latter occurs, the Tusken is allowed to return to his or her tribe. No other cultures or species share such a bond with banthas.

Other species have used bantha hides for clothing, with such items as bantha-skin boots and carrying cases fetching high prices. Bantha meat has often been processed for food and beverages, and &quot;bantha steaks&quot; are a common food in works of &quot;Star Wars&quot; media. In one scene from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, Luke Skywalker&#x27;s aunt Beru pours a cup of what is known as &quot;blue milk&quot;; it is later established that the milk comes from banthas. Bantha blue milk has reappeared in several &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, books, games, and other mediums, including the film &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016), and is sold as a real-life beverage at the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Galaxy&#x27;s Edge, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; themed area within Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Fictional bantha hides make an alcoholic drink when mixed with fermented grain. One such drink is called &quot;Jawa Juice&quot;, named after the Jawa alien species, which is served to Obi-Wan Kenobi at a restaurant in a scene from &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002). A flying reptile species on Tatooine known as skettos would gather loose wool from the backs of banthas for use in building nests. Tusken Raiders collect the bones of deceased banthas for use as tent supports and other purposes.

==&quot;Star Wars&quot; appearances==
Banthas first appear in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), the first film in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, during a scene in which protagonist Luke Skywalker is stalked and attacked by Tusken Raiders in a region of Tatooine known as the Jundland Wastes. After observing Luke from afar, the Tuskens mount their nearby banthas and begin their approach to ambush him. Luke later uses binoculars to survey the area and spots two banthas and a Tusken Raider in the distance, before another Tusken surprise attacks him and renders him unconscious. Other works of &quot;Star Wars&quot; media have established that the specific bantha most prominently featured in the film was a male named R&#x27;rrr&#x27;ur&#x27;R, whose name is similar to the guttural sounds of the Tusken language. According to his backstory, R&#x27;rrr&#x27;ur&#x27;R had been the alpha male of his herd before he was raised by the Tusken Raider RR&#x27;uruurrr for the personal use of URoRRuR&#x27;R&#x27;R, the leader of the tribe. Later in the film, while Luke and Obi-Wan Kenobi are surveying the wreckage of a destroyed sandcrawler, Kenobi correctly assesses that the craft was attacked not by Tusken Raiders but by Imperial stormtroopers serving the Galactic Empire. He reaches this conclusion by noting that the footprints left by the attackers were side by side, whereas Tusken Raiders and their banthas travel in single file to hide their numbers.

Chewbacca&#x27;s son Lumpawaroo plays with a plush toy version of a bantha in the &quot;Star Wars Christmas Special&quot; (1978), and comedian Harvey Korman appears in the special as a four-armed alien chef and parody of Julia Child, who cooks a meal called &quot;Bantha Surprise&quot;. Banthas have played a part in stories for the &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot; first published in 1987, including a bantha stampede caused by Tusken Raiders as an attack against the players. The game also introduced the Dim-U, a cult-like sect of monks that worship banthas as deities, believing the creatures&#x27; far-reaching presence on multiple worlds was a sign of a message from a higher power.
In the Special Edition version of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) released in 1997, a shot with a herd of banthas walking through the Tatooine desert was added to the film, just before the scene in which the sail barge vehicle of the character Jabba the Hutt passes. &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas said he added the shot because it allowed him to expand the environment of the fictional universe and add more nuance to the setting of the film. Banthas appear in two of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy films. In the first film, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), a bantha can be seen in the background when the characters Qui-Gon Jinn, Padmé Amidala, and Jar Jar Binks enter the Tatooine city of Mos Espa. In the second film, &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), a small herd of banthas are present in another scene set in Mos Espa, next to a docking bay where Anakin Skywalker and Padmé land their ship.
Banthas have appeared in the 3D CGI television series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, once again on the planet Tatooine, and have been mentioned in the television shows &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars Resistance&quot;. A bantha doll can be seen in the bedroom of Torra Doza in &quot;The High Tower&quot;, the fifth episode of &quot;Resistance&quot;, which first aired on October 28, 2018. Obi-Wan Kenobi walks among a herd of banthas in the 20th issue of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic book series by Marvel Comics. In the issue, released on June 15, 2016, Kenobi speaks to the banthas as if they are friends, referring to two in particular by the names Dolo and Nara. Banthas were also featured in an episode of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, a &quot;Star Wars&quot; television series featured on the streaming service Disney+. The episode, entitled &quot;Chapter 5: The Gunslinger&quot;, was first made available on December 6, 2019. In it, the title character and a bounty hunter named Toro Calican search Tatooine for a mercenary named Fennec Shand. During the search, Toro looks through a pair of binoculars and spots two banthas and their accompanying Tusken Raiders in the distance, a first-person camera angle that references a similar shot from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film when Luke Skywalker observes the banthas through binoculars.

Banthas appear in several &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games, including as minor villain characters that Luke Skywalker can fight in &quot;Super Star Wars&quot;, the 1992 video game for Super Nintendo. They also appear as a creature the player-controlled character can ride in &quot;Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy&quot; (2003), &quot;Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy&quot; (2006), &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot; (2008), &quot;Disney Infinity 3.0&quot; (2015), and the upcoming &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&quot; (2020). In &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot; (2004), the player who is killed the most often in some games receives an award called &quot;bantha fodder&quot;. The word &quot;bantha&quot; has been used throughout other &quot;Star Wars&quot; stories. The hovercraft that Jabba the Hutt used to transport the imprisoned Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca to the Sarlacc monster in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was called a &quot;Bantha-II cargo skiff&quot;. One alcoholic drink often consumed at the Jabba&#x27;s palace was called a &quot;Bantha Blaster&quot;, and one type of space vessel was named the &quot;Bantha&quot;-class assault shuttle. Additionally, in the television series &quot;Star Wars: A Clone Wars&quot;, Anakin Skywalker orders his starfighter squadron to use a single-file starfighter formation known as the &quot;Bantha formation&quot;. A children&#x27;s story called &quot;The Little Lost Bantha Cub&quot; is featured in the &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy of novels released in 1994, and a restaurant and entertainment complex called Bantha Traxx appears in the &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot;, which included a gift shop that sold toy banthas.

==Concept and creation==

Banthas were created by George Lucas, who was inspired in part by Banths, lion-like carnivorous creatures in the science fantasy serial story &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot;. They were one of the first creatures introduced in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, with the first use of a variation of the word &quot;bantha&quot; appearing in an early &quot;Star Wars&quot; film draft from May 1974, in which an antagonist Sith character had the callsign &quot;Banta Four&quot;. A second version of this draft, dated January 1978, featured a Rebel starfighter pilot with the callsign &quot;Banta One&quot; during the attack on the Death Star. The first mention of banthas as a creature was in the third draft of the screenplay from August 1975, which described a group of Tusken Raiders riding &quot;monstrous banthas&quot;, and includes a scene in which the creatures attack Luke Skywalker after he spots them. Ralph McQuarrie, a production illustrator on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, designed the early concept art for the banthas. The original sketches depicted them as horse-like creatures, but with other attributes ultimately used in the final design, including a shaggy coat and two horns around the animal&#x27;s mouth. The Tusken Raiders that would be riding banthas were at this time envisioned to be a smaller alien species, and once they were changed to the size of fully-grown humans, the banthas were changed to be the size of elephants.

The bantha was created through the visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic. Art director Leon Erickson created the bantha costume, leading a crew of six total crew members in the work. It took about one month to finish it. The base of the costume was a howdah, or elephant saddle, with palm fronds added to create the bantha&#x27;s shaggy coat. Yak hair was also used to create the fur. A head mask was molded from chicken wire and sprayed with foam to create the creature&#x27;s facial features, and a beard made from horse hair was added. The bantha&#x27;s curved horns were made from flexible home ventilation tubing, and its tail was crafted from wood covered with thick thistles. Early plans called for the tail to be carried in the air as the bantha walked, but due to the challenges associated with making this happen, Industrial Light &amp; Magic determined it would be dragged on the ground instead. The costume ultimately weighed about 300 pounds. The bantha&#x27;s moaning sound was created by sound designer Ben Burtt, who had collected a large number of bear sounds to create the voice of the Wookiee character Chewbacca. Burtt created the bantha&#x27;s noise by slowing down one a specific bear recording that had been provided to him by documentary producer George Casey.

==Filming and production==

The first bantha to appear onscreen was in the original 1977 &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. The filmmakers had the option of creating the bantha through stop motion animation or by filming an elephant in a bantha costume, and Lucas decided on the latter because he wanted a Tusken Raider to jump onto the back of the bantha in the scene, which could not be realistically done using stop motion. The bantha appeared in scenes on the desert planet of Tatooine, most of which were filmed in Tunisia. However, the production team had an insufficient budget to transport an elephant to the North African country, and large storms there would have prevented them from doing so even if they could. Lucas thus elected to film the bantha scenes in the United States, with sound to be added later, so that the scenes could be edited into the Tunisia-filmed scenes in post-production. Death Valley National Park in California offered to provide the scenery for the footage, and arrangements were made for an elephant, which was provided by the Marine World Africa USA amusement park in Redwood City, California. The bantha scenes were shot by second unit director Carroll Ballard. The elephant used to portray the bantha was a female Asian elephant named Mardji, who was 22 years old when &quot;Star Wars&quot; was filmed, and weighed about 8,500 pounds. Her trainer at the time, Bob Spiker, played the Tusken Raider that rode the Bantha in the first movie installment. Mardji had previously been trained to perform tricks, such as water skiing, and she had previously appeared in television commercials for Skippy Peanut Butter.

The bantha scenes were filmed in mid-January 1977, in an area of Death Valley known as Desolation Canyon, which marked the first time Mardji ventured out into the wild. She reportedly enjoyed the experience, playing in a creek during shooting breaks. This bantha costume designed for Mardji proved problematic during filming, as the elephant was unaccustomed to the intense heat of Death Valley and kept shrugging the heavy costume off her body, which slowed production. Crew members were worried the weight of the head mask would cause Mardji problems; special make-up effects artist Rick Baker was particularly concerned. But the elephant experienced more difficulty dragging the costume&#x27;s tail. Additionally, although Mardji was trained to tuck her trunk into her mouth to conceal it while wearing the bantha costume, her trunk would also occasionally fall out of the costume and become visible during shooting. Mardji&#x27;s trainer fed her apples as a reward between scenes to help keep her focused and help overcome the challenges from the costume. Lucas said filming with an elephant was more frustrating than using a visual effect because he felt it limited the environment in which he could place the creature. Nevertheless, Mardji was largely good-natured throughout the shoot, and the footage was captured without major incident.

Anthony Daniels, the actor who played C-3PO in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, first saw the bantha footage while recording dialogue during the dubbing process and was so impressed he asked George Lucas how the creature was brought to life, which Lucas did not reveal. During one scene in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Luke Skywalker looks through a pair of binoculars and sees two banthas. Only one was used in filming due to budget restraints, and the second bantha in the shot was created using optical compositing. Lucas later said he felt a deep connection with Mardji and &quot;fell in love&quot; with the elephant, regularly visiting her at Marine World after filming. In November 1995, aged 44, Mardji was euthanized at the University of California, Davis because of an untreatable and painful bone condition in her front legs. Mardji had been having difficulty walking due to the ailments, and had undergone two major surgeries for treatment in the years prior to her death. When Lucas revised &quot;Star Wars&quot; and released a new Special Edition version in 1997, he decided to retain the original shots of the elephant, rather than replacing the bantha with computer-generated imagery. The bantha costume used in &quot;Star Wars&quot; was on display at Marine World Africa USA for a time after Mardji&#x27;s death, but elements of it deteriorated because it was not sufficiently protected, and it was later destroyed.

Mardji&#x27;s gait served as the model for the movement of AT-AT walkers in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980). The idea was conceived by special effects artist Jon Berg, who felt the walkers looked so much like elephants that they should mimic their movements as well. During the production of &quot;Empire&quot;, Berg and fellow special effects artists Phil Tippett and Dennis Muren visited Mardji at Marine World Africa USA and shot footage of her walking back and forth for use as a reference in creating the walker&#x27;s movements. Each appearance of banthas in films and television after the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; films were digital creations modeled after the original creature in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, rather than again using an elephant in costume. The first such use of digitally-created banthas was the shot of a bantha herd in the Special Edition re-release of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Rick McCallum, a producer with the Special Edition films, said the digital banthas allowed for greater flexibility and freedom of movement than the original version, which he described as &quot;laboriously-made creatures that you couldn&#x27;t sync up&quot;. An entirely new digital model for the bantha had to be created for its appearance in the animated television series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; to match the show&#x27;s unique visual style.

The bantha inspired the creation of luggabeasts, semi-mechanical beasts of burden used by scavengers in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), the first film of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy. Concept designer Christian Alzmann said the crew sought to make updated versions of the creatures from the original films, and banthas from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film helped inspire this approach. Additionally, the use of a live elephant for the original bantha inspired the special effects team behind &quot;&quot; (2018) to use actual dogs to portray Corellian hounds, quadrupedal creatures featured in that film. Special effects artist Neal Scanlan said the bantha in &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;set that whole thing up for me. It&#x27;s our responsibility to carry that magic forward.&quot;

==Critical reception==

The bantha has been described as a favorite among fans, as well as the cast and crew of the films. Anthony Daniels, the actor who portrayed C-3PO, called the bantha &quot;one of the best things in the movie&quot;. Ted Edwards, author of &quot;The Unauthorized Star Wars Compendium&quot;, wrote that the shot of a herd of banthas added in to the Special Edition version of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was &quot;probably the single most striking image added to any of the three films&quot;. Gary Arnold, senior film critic with &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, said he appreciated that the bantha was not replaced by a digital creation in &quot;Star Wars&quot; re-releases like other creatures were, and that it represented an authenticity that fans appreciate. The bantha was included on &quot;HowStuffWorks&quot;″ list of &quot;11 Wacky &quot;Star Wars&quot; Creatures We Love&quot;, calling it &quot;a wacky combination of animal parts in a memorable form&quot;. Brian Linder of &quot;IGN&quot; praised banthas as a positive addition to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, writing: &quot;Banthas are the choice beast of burden of the Tusken frickin&#x27; Raiders. That alone makes them cool.&quot;

==Cultural references==
The first name of the original newsletter of the Official Star Wars Fan Club was &quot;Bantha Tracks&quot;, inspired by the creature. Originally entitled simply &quot;Official Star Wars Fan Club&quot; when first published in 1978, the newsletter was renamed after a contest in the second issue invited readers to submit new names. Preston Postole of Avon, Ohio, submitted the winning title of &quot;Bantha Tracks&quot;. During one scene in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Jabba the Hutt insults Han Solo by saying: &quot;You may have been a good smuggler, but now you&#x27;re bantha fodder.&quot; The line became a popular one among &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans, with &quot;bantha fodder&quot; becoming a well-known &quot;Star Wars&quot;-related insult. An Australian punk band called Bantha Fodder takes its name from the line. In &quot;Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars&quot;, a 2014 &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed episode of the animated series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, villain character Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz sings a song that ends with the line &quot;Darth Vader can kiss my bantha!&quot; A September 18, 2014 episode of the educational children&#x27;s television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot; featured a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-inspired segment in which Mr. Snuffleupagus, a woolly mammoth-like Muppet character, appeared as a bantha.

==Merchandise==
A bantha action figure was planned for the &quot;Star Wars: The Power of the Force&quot; toy line by Kenner Products in 1985, and concept artwork was prepared for the toy, but it was never produced before Kenner ended the toy line. A bantha figure would not be created until Hasbro revived the &quot;Power of the Force&quot; line in 1995. Several miniature bantha figures have since been released for use in &quot;Star Wars&quot; role-playing games, including one by West End Games, and a five-inch figurine through the &quot;Star Wars Miniatures&quot; toyline by Wizards of the Coast. Original t-shirts for official members of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan club featured a photo of a bantha. In 2014, Hallmark released a miniature bantha plush toys through its Itty Bittys toy line, sold in a two-pack along with a Tusken Raider. A bantha ride had been planned for &quot;Star Wars&quot; Galaxy&#x27;s Edge at Disneyland, but it was ultimately not created. The planned attraction would have allowed visitors to ride on platforms atop large animatronic banthas, which would then embark on a tour of the area.

<doc id="639232" wikidata="Q2639521" url="?curid=639232" title="Jedediah Strutt">
<text>Jedediah Strutt (1726 – 7 May 1797) or Jedidiah Strutt – as he spelled it – was a hosier and cotton spinner from Belper, England.

Strutt and his brother-in-law William Woollat developed an attachment to the stocking frame that allowed the production of ribbed stockings. Their machine became known as the Derby Rib machine, and the stockings it produced quickly became popular.

==Early life==
He was born in South Normanton near Alfreton in Derbyshire into a farming family in 1726.

In 1740 he became an apprentice wheelwright in Findern. In 1754 he inherited a small stock of animals from an uncle and married Elizabeth Woolatt in 1755 in Derbyshire. He moved to Blackwell where he had inherited a farm from one of his uncles and, in addition developed a business carrying coal from Denby to Belper and Derby.

==The Derby Rib==
Strutt&#x27;s brother-in-law, William Woolatt, employed one Mr. Roper of Locko who had produced an idea for an attachment to the stocking frame to knit ribbed stockings. He had made one or two specimens which he showed to his friends, though he lacked the interest (and the capital) to develop his idea. Woolatt conferred with Strutt, who sold a horse and paid Roper £5 for his invention. Strutt and Woolatt turned the device into a viable machine and took out a patent in 1759.

Their machine became known as the Derby Rib machine, and the stockings it produced quickly became popular. Cotton was cheaper than silk and more comfortable than wool but demand was far exceeding supply.

==Cotton mills==
Strutt and another spinner, Samuel Need, were introduced to Richard Arkwright who had arrived in Nottingham in about 1768, and set up his spinning frame there using horse-power to run the mill, but this was an unsatisfactory power source. In Derby, John Lombe had built a successful silk spinning mill using water power. Strutt and Need joined Arkwright in the building of a cotton mill at Cromford, using what was henceforth called Arkwright&#x27;s water frame. This was the first of its kind in the world, marking the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.

Strutt bought land in 1777 for his first mill in Belper, which at that time was a hamlet of framework knitters and nail makers. In 1781 he bought the old forge at Makeney by Milford Bridge from Walter Mather. Belper opened in 1778 and Milford in 1782. For each he built long rows of substantial worker&#x27;s houses and both are now part of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site.

In time there would be eight Strutt mills at Belper which would grow to a population of 10,000 by the mid-nineteenth century and be the second largest town in the county.
==Family==
Strutt was the second son of William Strutt of South Normanton and Martha Statham of Handley near Shottle, Derbyshire, England. In 1755, he married Elizabeth Woollatt. They had five children before Elizabeth&#x27;s death in London in 1774. In 1781, Strutt married again, to Ann Cantrell, the widow of George Daniels of Belper. There were no children from this marriage.

Jedediah and Elizabeth&#x27;s children were:
*William (1756–1830), who married Barbara Evans, daughter of Thomas Evans (by his second wife), and who invented the Belper stove. Their son was the Liberal politician Edward Strutt, 1st Baron Belper.
*Elizabeth (1758–1836), who married William Evans, son of Thomas Evans (by his first wife).
*Martha (1760–1793), who married Samuel Fox.
*George Benson (1761–1841), who married Catherine Radford, daughter of Anthony Radford of Holbrook.
*Joseph (1765–1844), who married Isabella Douglas, daughter of Archibold Douglas.

Jedediah died in Derby in 1797 and is buried in the Unitarian Chapel in Field Row, Belper, which he had built in 1788/9. His final home, Friar Gate House, Derby, is marked with a blue plaque. The house was designed by his son, William Strutt.

<doc id="639236" wikidata="Q7072899" url="?curid=639236" title="ORACLE (teletext)">
<text>ORACLE (from &quot;Optional Reception of Announcements by Coded Line Electronics&quot;) was a commercial teletext service first broadcast on the ITV network in 1978 and later additionally on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom from 1982. The service ceased on both channels at 23:59UTC on 31 December 1992, when it was replaced by Teletext Ltd.

==History==
It was developed and launched by the Independent Broadcasting Authority&#x27;s engineering division, about 4 years after BBC&#x27;s Ceefax service. Due to the lack of available receivers, exact launch dates have been left obscure. Receivers became popular around the early 1980s.

ITV Oracle made the world&#x27;s first telesoftware broadcast in February 1977 and this led to a working demonstration of telesoftware at the 1978 International Broadcasting Convention.

In Britain, ORACLE, ITV&#x27;s teletext service, was launched as a new advertising medium on 1 September 1981 with 180,000 teletext sets in the country. By the following year, there were then 450,000 sets in the UK and that number was projected to rise to nearly three million at the end of 1985 and confident predictions of advertising revenues as high as $90million (£50million).

ORACLE moved away from being an experimental engineering department and more towards being a content provider. Under the original plans for the ITV franchise renewal, they were to have been scrapped at the end of 1992 and the few scan lines they used given to the highest bidder. ORACLE successfully campaigned for the creation of a franchise for the teletext service on ITV and Channel 4, only to find themselves outbid by Teletext Ltd., a consortium originally comprising Associated Newspapers, Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. and Media Ventures International, who started broadcasting at midnight on New Year&#x27;s Day 1993.

==In-vision broadcasts==
From early 1983 until its demise on 31 December 1992, ORACLE pages were broadcast in vision during downtime, mostly on Channel 4, although occasionally pages were shown during the night on ITV.

===Channel 4===
====4-Tel on View====
Shown between 1983 and January 1997, 4-Tel on View was a magazine featuring previews of the day&#x27;s Channel 4&#x27;s programmes as well as back-up information and other features, such as the adventures of a dog called 4-T, from Channel 4&#x27;s own &quot;4-Tel&quot; teletext service. The transmissions were especially notable from 1986 when animated graphics were introduced. Although the service was transmitted alongside Oracle on Channel 4, 4-Tel was editorially and legally separate, and operated for Channel 4 by Intelfax Ltd.

From 1983 until the start of Channel 4&#x27;s breakfast television service in April 1989, the 4-Tel magazine ran for 15minutes and was repeated several times each day with transmissions airing at increasingly early times of the day as Channel 4 expanded its broadcast hours. Following the start of breakfast television, however, 4-Tel on View was shown in a single block, initially 40minutes in length, before the start of programmes. After ORACLE lost its franchise on 31 December 1992, 4-Tel on View continued to be shown and from 1 January 1993 until Channel 4 started 24-hour broadcasting in January 1997, 4-Tel on View was generally shown throughout Channel 4&#x27;s entire closedown period.

====Oracle on View====
Between 1983 and 1989, Channel 4 broadcast pages from the ORACLE service on air. Shown in 15-minute bursts, and alternating with 4-Tel on View and showings of the ETP-1 testcard, the pages were seen during the day when Channel 4 was not broadcasting actual programmes. Initially, the pages shown were from one aspect of the ORACLE service with the subject matter changing every so often. In September 1987, Oracle on View became a news service, adopting this format at the same time that Channel 4 expanded its broadcast hours to accommodate the transfer of ITV Schools to Channel 4. Oracle on View ended on 31 March 1989, three days before Channel 4 started broadcasting breakfast television.

===ITV===
====Jobfinder====
During the late 1980s and mid 1990s, many ITV companies broadcast job vacancies and related information during overnight periods and the service was provided by broadcasting the relevant ORACLE page in-vision. Central was the first company to do this, beginning in April 1986 with Yorkshire following in January 1987. Initially, the pages were broadcast for an hour after the end of regular programming but from April 1987, Central broadcast &quot;Jobfinder&quot; throughout their overnight downtime with Tyne Tees doing the same from November 1987. By late 1988, all of ITV was broadcasting a service and many other companies, including Granada, HTV and TSW, introduced their own &quot;Jobfinder&quot; service at this point, broadcasting the pages between 4am and 5am, later 4:30am to 5:30am. By the late-1990s, the vacancies were no longer transmitted in a teletext format and by the mid-2000s all of the &quot;Jobfinder&quot; services had ended, with Yorkshire being the last.

====Daybreak====
For a short period in 1987, prior to the start of 24-hour broadcasting on ITV, a selection of teletext pages were broadcast in-vision prior to the start of TV-am. These pages mostly consisted of news and information about TV-am.

==The end==
ORACLE began to disappear at 23:31:09 on 31 December 1992, with the outer border of pixels turning black: this process continued until 23:55:55 when only a white square was left, with the text &quot;ORACLE gone, 1978–1992&quot;. It was then replaced by the service from Teletext Ltd. ORACLE did not carry television listings beyond its midnight closing time on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1992. By , Teletext was fully operational.

<text>The Langdale axe industry (or factory) is the name given by archaeologists to a Neolithic centre of specialised stone tool production in the Great Langdale area of the English Lake District. The existence of the site, which dates from around 4,000–3,500 BC, was suggested by chance discoveries in the 1930s. More systematic investigations were undertaken by Clare Fell and others in the 1940s and 1950s, since when several field surveys of varying scope have been carried out.

Typical finds include reject axes, rough-outs and blades created by knapping large lumps of the rock found in the scree or perhaps by simple quarrying or opencast mining. Hammerstones have also been found in the scree and other lithic debitage from the industry such as blades and flakes.

The area has outcrops of fine-grained greenstone or hornstone suitable for making polished stone axes. Such axes have been found distributed across Great Britain. The rock is an epidotised greenstone quarried or perhaps just collected from the scree slopes in the Langdale Valley on Harrison Stickle and Pike of Stickle. The nature and extent of the axe-flaking sites making up the Langdale Axe Factory complex are still under investigation.
Geological mapping has established that the volcanic tuff used for the axes outcrops along a narrow range of the highest peaks in the locality. Other outcrops in the area are known to have been worked, especially on Harrison Stickle, and Scafell Pike where rough-outs and flakes have been found on platforms below the peaks at and above the 2000- or 3000-foot level.

Recent research has shown that Langdale tuff was used for tools before the Neolithic &#x27;axe factories&#x27; were established. In Maryport (Cumbria) it was selected for tool manufacture in the Final Palaeolithic and Mesolithic

==Petrographic analysis==
Archaeologists are able to identify the unique nature of the Langdale stone by taking sections and examining them using microscopy. The minerals in the rock have a characteristic pattern, using a method known as petrography. They have been able to reconstruct the production methods and trade patterns employed by the axe makers. The Langdale industry produced roughly hewn (or so-called &quot;rough-outs&quot;) axes and simple blocks. The highly polished final product were usually made elsewhere, such as at Ehenside Tarn in the western fringes of the Lake District, and all were traded on throughout Britain and Ireland. The Langdale tuff was among the most common of the various rocks used to make axes in the Neolithic period, and are known as Group VI axes. Flint was also commonly used to make polished axes, and mined at several places, but especially at Grimes Graves and Cissbury, and in continental Europe at Spiennes in Belgium, and Krzemionki in Poland.

Polishing the rough surfaces will have improved the mechanical strength of the axe as well as lowering friction when used against wood. Fractures occur more easily in brittle materials like stone when rough owing to the stress concentrations present at sharp corners, holes and other defects in the axe surface. Removing those defects by polishing makes the axe much stronger, and able to withstand impact and shock loads from use. Sandstone was usually used for polishing axes, and whetstones have been found nearby at Ehenside tarn, for example where the rough-outs were polished. Large fixed outcrops were also widely used for polishing, and there are numerous examples across Europe, but relatively few in Britain. That at Fyfield Down near Avebury is an exception, but there must be many more awaiting discovery and publication.

==Distribution and use==
The stone axes from Langdale have been found at archaeological sites across Britain and Ireland. An unusual concentration of finds occurs in the East of England, particularly Lincolnshire. Francis Pryor attributes this to these axes being particularly valued in this region. He mentions possible religious significance of the axes, perhaps related to the high peaks from which they came. He compares this with confirmed Neolithic flint mines which, apart from Grime&#x27;s Graves (where flint of exceptionally high quality was mined), were all at prominent elevated locations.

Of all the Neolithic polished stone axes that have been examined in the UK, around 27% come from the Langdale region. This is notable considering there were over 30 sources of material for stone axes from Cornwall to northern Scotland and Ireland.

Whether religious objects or not, the axes must have been of high value, given that they have been &quot;traded&quot; so widely. Some axes appear worn whilst others appear unused, again implying that they were regarded as sacred objects or, perhaps, simply as a display of visible wealth. Some though were used as practical tools. The shape of the polished axes suggests that they were bound in wooden staves and used for forest clearance.

Francis Pryor discusses a flint axe that he found north of Peterborough with fantastic swirling patterns that had been brought out by polishing – but this axe was totally impractical as the patterns were fault lines, making the flint very fragile. However, it must have been valued by its owner and/or maker, bearing in mind the work involved in making it. These facts suggest various interpretations of the purpose of the Langdale axes, which were both beautiful and practical, as well as being traded many miles from their place of production.

==Context==

The Langdale industry was one of many which extracted hard stone for manufacture into polished axes. The Neolithic period was a time of settlement on the land, and the development of farming on a large scale. Clearance of the forest cover was necessary in order to plant crops and rear animals, so axes were a staple tool, not just for clearance but also for wood working timber for houses, boats and other structures. Flint was probably the most widely used, simply because it was available from numerous flint mines in the downlands, such as Grimes Graves, Cissbury and Spiennes. Blades from roughing-out from flint and chert could also be used as small knives, arrowheads and other small sharp tools such as burins and awls.

But other hard and tough stones were used, such as igneous rocks from Penmaenmawr in North Wales, and similar working areas to Langdale have been found there. Many other locations for production of axes have been suggested (but not always found) across the country including Tievebulliagh in County Antrim, sites in Cornwall, Scotland and the Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire. It is also likely that bluestone axes were exported from the Preseli hills in Pembrokeshire. The industry was also widely developed elsewhere in the world, such as in Australia at Mount William stone axe quarry which used a similar rock until relatively recent times.
The variety of rocks used in polished tools and other artefacts is evident in museum collections, not all of the sources of the rocks having been positively identified. Taking sections is necessarily destructive of part of the artefact, and thus discouraged by many museums. Likewise, the rocks or anvils used to polish the axes are rare in Britain but common in France and Sweden.

Radiocarbon dating at the Langdale stone axe factory site suggests that it was in operation for about 1,000 years during the Neolithic period.

Current thinking links the manufacturers of the axes to some of the first Neolithic stone circles such as that at Castlerigg.

==Conservation==
The altitude and rough terrain of the archaeological sites have protected them from types of damage caused by human settlement in lowland areas. However, Great Langdale is much visited by walkers. People have removed axes (although current thinking is that they should be left in situ) and have caused inadvertent damage to stone scatters by walking.

An attempt to schedule the sites as ancient monuments in the 1980s was thwarted by the lack of reliable mapping. However, English Heritage has been considering questions on how the sites should be managed. Particular attention has been paid to the siting of footpaths to avoid damage to axeworking sites. 
Since the 1990s eroded paths in the Lake District, including Great Langdale, have been repaired by a &quot;Fix the Fells&quot; project in which the National Trust is the major partner.

Langdale axes are displayed in Cumbria at Kendal Museum and Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle, and in other collections such as the British Museum.
