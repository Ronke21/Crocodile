<text>A contour line (also isoline, isopleth, isoquant or isarithm) of a function of two variables is a curve along which the function has a constant value, so that the curve joins points of equal value. It is a plane section of the three-dimensional graph of the function formula_1 parallel to the formula_2-plane. More generally, a contour line for a function of two variables is a curve connecting points where the function has the same particular value.

In cartography, a contour line (often just called a &quot;contour&quot;) joins points of equal elevation (height) above a given level, such as mean sea level. A contour map is a map illustrated with contour lines, for example a topographic map, which thus shows valleys and hills, and the steepness or gentleness of slopes. The contour interval of a contour map is the difference in elevation between successive contour lines.

The gradient of the function is always perpendicular to the contour lines. When the lines are close together the magnitude of the gradient is large: the variation is steep. A level set is a generalization of a contour line for functions of any number of variables.

Contour lines are curved, straight or a mixture of both lines on a map describing the intersection of a real or hypothetical surface with one or more horizontal planes. The configuration of these contours allows map readers to infer the relative gradient of a parameter and estimate that parameter at specific places. Contour lines may be either traced on a visible three-dimensional model of the surface, as when a photogrammetrist viewing a stereo-model plots elevation contours, or interpolated from the estimated surface elevations, as when a computer program threads contours through a network of observation points of area centroids. In the latter case, the method of interpolation affects the reliability of individual isolines and their portrayal of slope, pits and peaks.

== History ==

The idea of lines that join points of equal value was rediscovered several times. The oldest known isobath (contour line of constant depth) is found on a map dated 1584 of the river Spaarne, near Haarlem, by Dutchman Pieter Bruinsz. In 1701, Edmond Halley used such lines (isogons) on a chart of magnetic variation. The Dutch engineer Nicholas Cruquius drew the bed of the river Merwede with lines of equal depth (isobaths) at intervals of 1 fathom in 1727, and Philippe Buache used them at 10-fathom intervals on a chart of the English Channel that was prepared in 1737 and published in 1752. Such lines were used to describe a land surface (contour lines) in a map of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio by Domenico Vandelli in 1746, and they were studied theoretically by Ducarla in 1771, and Charles Hutton used them in the Schiehallion experiment. In 1791, a map of France by J. L. Dupain-Triel used contour lines at 20-metre intervals, hachures, spot-heights and a vertical section. In 1801, the chief of the French Corps of Engineers, Haxo, used contour lines at the larger scale of 1:500 on a plan of his projects for Rocca d&#x27;Anfo, now in northern Italy, under Napoleon.

By around 1843, when the Ordnance Survey started to regularly record contour lines in Great Britain and Ireland, they were already in general use in European countries. Isobaths were not routinely used on nautical charts until those of Russia from 1834, and those of Britain from 1838.

As different uses of the technique were invented independently, cartographers began to recognize a common theme, and debated what to call these &quot;lines of equal value&quot; generally. The word &quot;isogram&quot; () was proposed by Francis Galton in 1889 for lines indicating equality of some physical condition or quantity, though &quot;isogram&quot; can also refer to a word without a repeated letter. As late as 1944, John K. Wright still preferred &quot;isogram&quot;, but it never attained wide usage. During the early 20th century, &quot;isopleth&quot; () was being used by 1911 in the United States, while &quot;isarithm&quot; () had become common in Europe. Additional alternatives, including the Greek-English hybrid &quot;isoline&quot; and &quot;isometric line&quot; (), also emerged. Despite attempts to select a single standard, all of these alternatives have survived to the present.

When maps with contour lines became common, the idea spread to other applications. Perhaps the latest to develop are air quality and noise pollution contour maps, which first appeared in the United States in approximately 1970, largely as a result of national legislation requiring spatial delineation of these parameters.

== Types ==
Contour lines are often given specific names beginning with &quot;iso-&quot; according to the nature of the variable being mapped, although in many usages the phrase &quot;contour line&quot; is most commonly used. Specific names are most common in meteorology, where multiple maps with different variables may be viewed simultaneously. The prefix &quot;&quot;&#x27;iso-&quot; can be replaced with &quot;isallo-&quot;&quot; to specify a contour line connecting points where a variable changes at the same &quot;rate&quot; during a given time period.

An isogon () is a contour line for a variable which measures direction. In meteorology and in geomagnetics, the term &quot;isogon&quot; has specific meanings which are described below. An isocline () is a line joining points with equal slope. In population dynamics and in geomagnetics, the terms &quot;isocline&quot; and &quot;isoclinic line&quot; have specific meanings which are described below.

=== Equidistant points ===
A curve of equidistant points is a set of points all at the same distance from a given point, line, or polyline. In this case the function whose value is being held constant along a contour line is a distance function.

=== Isopleths ===
In 1944, John K. Wright proposed that the term &quot;isopleth&quot; be used for contour lines that depict a variable which cannot be measured at a point, but which instead must be calculated from data collected over an area, as opposed to &quot;isometric lines&quot; for variables that could be measured at a point; this distinction has since been followed generally. An example of an isopleth is population density, which can be calculated by dividing the population of a census district by the surface area of that district. Each calculated value is presumed to be the value of the variable at the centre of the area, and isopleths can then be drawn by a process of interpolation. The idea of an isopleth map can be compared with that of a choropleth map.

In meteorology, the word &quot;isopleth&quot; is used for any type of contour line.

=== Meteorology ===
Meteorological contour lines are based on interpolation of the point data received from weather stations and weather satellites. Weather stations are seldom exactly positioned at a contour line (when they are, this indicates a measurement precisely equal to the value of the contour). Instead, lines are drawn to best approximate the locations of exact values, based on the scattered information points available.

Meteorological contour maps may present collected data such as actual air pressure at a given time, or generalized data such as average pressure over a period of time, or forecast data such as predicted air pressure at some point in the future.

Thermodynamic diagrams use multiple overlapping contour sets (including isobars and isotherms) to present a picture of the major thermodynamic factors in a weather system.

==== Barometric pressure ====

An isobar () is a line of equal or constant pressure on a graph, plot, or map; an isopleth or contour line of pressure. More accurately, isobars are lines drawn on a map joining places of equal average atmospheric pressure reduced to sea level for a specified period of time. In meteorology, the barometric pressures shown are reduced to sea level, not the surface pressures at the map locations. The distribution of isobars is closely related to the magnitude and direction of the wind field, and can be used to predict future weather patterns. Isobars are commonly used in television weather reporting.

Isallobars are lines joining points of equal pressure change during a specific time interval. These can be divided into &quot;anallobars&quot;, lines joining points of equal pressure increase during a specific time interval, and &quot;katallobars&quot;, lines joining points of equal pressure decrease. In general, weather systems move along an axis joining high and low isallobaric centers. Isallobaric gradients are important components of the wind as they increase or decrease the geostrophic wind.

An isopycnal is a line of constant density. An &quot;isoheight&quot; or &quot;isohypse&quot; is a line of constant geopotential height on a constant pressure surface chart. Isohypse and isoheight are simply known as lines showing equal pressure on a map.

==== Temperature and related subjects ====
An isotherm () is a line that connects points on a map that have the same temperature. Therefore, all points through which an isotherm passes have the same or equal temperatures at the time indicated. An isotherm at 0 °C is called the freezing level. The term &quot;lignes isothermes&quot; (or &quot;lignes d&#x27;égale chaleur)&quot; was coined by the Prussian geographer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, who as part of his research into the geographical distribution of plants published the first map of isotherms in Paris, in 1817. According to Thomas Hankins, the Scottish engineer William Playfair&#x27;s graphical developments greatly influenced Alexander von Humbolt&#x27;s invention of the isotherm. Humbolt later used his visualizations and analyses to contradict theories by Kant and other Enlightenment thinkers that non-Europeans were inferior due to their climate. 

An isocheim is a line of equal mean winter temperature, and an isothere is a line of equal mean summer temperature.

An isohel () is a line of equal or constant solar radiation.

An isogeotherm is a line of equal temperature beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface.

==== Rainfall and air moisture ====
An isohyet or isohyetal line () is a line on a map joining points of equal rainfall in a given period. A map with isohyets is called an isohyetal map.

An isohume is a line of constant relative humidity, while an isodrosotherm () is a line of equal or constant dew point.

An isoneph is a line indicating equal cloud cover.

An isochalaz is a line of constant frequency of hail storms, and an isobront is a line drawn through geographical points at which a given phase of thunderstorm activity occurred simultaneously.

Snow cover is frequently shown as a contour-line map.

==== Wind ====
An isotach () is a line joining points with constant wind speed.
In meteorology, the term isogon refers to a line of constant wind direction.

==== Freeze and thaw ====
An isopectic line denotes equal dates of ice formation each winter, and an isotac denotes equal dates of thawing.

=== Physical geography and oceanography ===

==== Elevation and depth ====
Contours are one of several common methods used to denote elevation or altitude and depth on maps. From these contours, a sense of the general terrain can be determined. They are used at a variety of scales, from large-scale engineering drawings and architectural plans, through topographic maps and bathymetric charts, up to continental-scale maps.

&quot;Contour line&quot; is the most common usage in cartography, but isobath for underwater depths on bathymetric maps and isohypse for elevations are also used.

In cartography, the contour interval is the elevation difference between adjacent contour lines. The contour interval should be the same over a single map. When calculated as a ratio against the map scale, a sense of the hilliness of the terrain can be derived.

===== Interpretation =====

There are several rules to note when interpreting terrain contour lines:
* The rule of Vs: sharp-pointed vees usually are in stream valleys, with the drainage channel passing through the point of the vee, with the vee pointing upstream. This is a consequence of erosion.
* The rule of Os: closed loops are normally uphill on the inside and downhill on the outside, and the innermost loop is the highest area. If a loop instead represents a depression, some maps note this by short lines called hachures which are perpendicular to the contour and point in the direction of the low. (The concept is similar to but distinct from hachures used in hachure maps.)
* Spacing of contours: close contours indicate a steep slope; distant contours a shallow slope. Two or more contour lines merging indicates a cliff. By counting the number of contours that cross a segment of a stream, the stream gradient can be approximated.

Of course, to determine differences in elevation between two points, the contour interval, or distance in altitude between two adjacent contour lines, must be known, and this is normally stated in the map key. Usually contour intervals are consistent throughout a map, but there are exceptions. Sometimes intermediate contours are present in flatter areas; these can be dashed or dotted lines at half the noted contour interval. When contours are used with hypsometric tints on a small-scale map that includes mountains and flatter low-lying areas, it is common to have smaller intervals at lower elevations so that detail is shown in all areas. Conversely, for an island which consists of a plateau surrounded by steep cliffs, it is possible to use smaller intervals as the height increases.

==== Electrostatics ====
An isopotential map is a measure of electrostatic potential in space, often depicted in two dimensions with the electrostatic charges inducing that electric potential. The term equipotential line or isopotential line refers to a curve of constant electric potential. Whether crossing an equipotential line represents ascending or descending the potential is inferred from the labels on the charges. In three dimensions, equipotential surfaces may be depicted with a two dimensional cross-section, showing equipotential lines at the intersection of the surfaces and the cross-section.

The general mathematical term level set is often used to describe the full collection of points having a particular potential, especially in higher dimensional space.

==== Magnetism ====

In the study of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, the term isogon or isogonic line refers to a line of constant magnetic declination, the variation of magnetic north from geographic north. An agonic line is drawn through points of zero magnetic declination. An isoporic line refers to a line of constant annual variation of magnetic declination

An isoclinic line connects points of equal magnetic dip, and an aclinic line is the isoclinic line of magnetic dip zero.

An isodynamic line (from or &quot;dynamis&quot; meaning &#x27;power&#x27;) connects points with the same intensity of magnetic force.

==== Oceanography ====
Besides ocean depth, oceanographers use contour to describe diffuse variable phenomena much as meteorologists do with atmospheric phenomena. In particular, isobathytherms are lines showing depths of water with equal temperature, isohalines show lines of equal ocean salinity, and isopycnals are surfaces of equal water density.

=== Geology ===
Various geological data are rendered as contour maps in structural geology, sedimentology, stratigraphy and economic geology. Contour maps are used to show the below ground surface of geologic strata, fault surfaces (especially low angle thrust faults) and unconformities. Isopach maps use isopachs (lines of equal thickness) to illustrate variations in thickness of geologic units.

=== Environmental science ===
In discussing pollution, density maps can be very useful in indicating sources and areas of greatest contamination. Contour maps are especially useful for diffuse forms or scales of pollution. Acid precipitation is indicated on maps with isoplats. Some of the most widespread applications of environmental science contour maps involve mapping of environmental noise (where lines of equal sound pressure level are denoted isobels), air pollution, soil contamination, thermal pollution and groundwater contamination. By contour planting and contour ploughing, the rate of water runoff and thus soil erosion can be substantially reduced; this is especially important in riparian zones.

=== Ecology ===
An isoflor is an isopleth contour connecting areas of comparable biological diversity. Usually, the variable is the number of species of a given genus or family that occurs in a region. Isoflor maps are thus used to show distribution patterns and trends such as centres of diversity.

=== Social sciences ===
In economics, contour lines can be used to describe features which vary quantitatively over space. An shows lines of equivalent drive time or travel time to a given location and is used in the generation of isochrone maps. An isotim shows equivalent transport costs from the source of a raw material, and an isodapane shows equivalent cost of travel time.

Contour lines are also used to display non-geographic information in economics. Indifference curves (as shown at left) are used to show bundles of goods to which a person would assign equal utility. An isoquant (in the image at right) is a curve of equal production quantity for alternative combinations of input usages, and an isocost curve (also in the image at right) shows alternative usages having equal production costs.

In political science an analogous method is used in understanding coalitions (for example the diagram in Laver and Shepsle&#x27;s work).

In population dynamics, an isocline shows the set of population sizes at which the rate of change, or partial derivative, for one population in a pair of interacting populations is zero.

=== Statistics ===
In statistics, isodensity lines or isodensanes are lines that join points with the same value of a probability density. Isodensanes are used to display bivariate distributions. For example, for a bivariate elliptical distribution the isodensity lines are ellipses.

=== Thermodynamics, engineering, and other sciences ===
Various types of graphs in thermodynamics, engineering, and other sciences use isobars (constant pressure), isotherms (constant temperature), isochors (constant specific volume), or other types of isolines, even though these graphs are usually not related to maps. Such isolines are useful for representing more than two dimensions (or quantities) on two-dimensional graphs. Common examples in thermodynamics are some types of phase diagrams.

Isoclines are used to solve ordinary differential equations.

In interpreting radar images, an isodop is a line of equal Doppler velocity, and an isoecho is a line of equal radar reflectivity.

In the case of hybrid contours, energies of hybrid orbitals and the energies of pure atomic orbitals are plotted. The graph obtained is called hybrid contour.

=== Other phenomena ===
* isochasm: aurora equal occurrence
* isochor: volume
* isodose: absorbed dose of radiation
* isophene: biological events occurring with coincidence such as plants flowering
* isophote: illuminance
* mobile telephony: mobile received power and cell coverage area

** Edge detection
** Level-set method
** Boundary tracing
* Active contour model

== Graphical design ==
To maximize readability of contour maps, there are several design choices available to the map creator, principally line weight, line color, line type and method of numerical marking.

Line weight is simply the darkness or thickness of the line used. This choice is made based upon the least intrusive form of contours that enable the reader to decipher the background information in the map itself. If there is little or no content on the base map, the contour lines may be drawn with relatively heavy thickness. Also, for many forms of contours such as topographic maps, it is common to vary the line weight and/or color, so that a different line characteristic occurs for certain numerical values. For example, in the topographic map above, the even hundred foot elevations are shown in a different weight from the twenty foot intervals.

Line color is the choice of any number of pigments that suit the display. Sometimes a sheen or gloss is used as well as color to set the contour lines apart from the base map. Line colour can be varied to show other information.

Line type refers to whether the basic contour line is solid, dashed, dotted or broken in some other pattern to create the desired effect. Dotted or dashed lines are often used when the underlying base map conveys very important (or difficult to read) information. Broken line types are used when the location of the contour line is inferred.

Numerical marking is the manner of denoting the arithmetical values of contour lines. This can be done by placing numbers along some of the contour lines, typically using interpolation for intervening lines. Alternatively a map key can be produced associating the contours with their values.

If the contour lines are not numerically labeled and adjacent lines have the same style (with the same weight, color and type), then the direction of the gradient cannot be determined from the contour lines alone. However, if the contour lines cycle through three or more styles, then the direction of the gradient can be determined from the lines. The orientation of the numerical text labels is often used to indicate the direction of the slope.

== Plan view versus profile view ==

Most commonly contour lines are drawn in plan view, or as an observer in space would view the Earth&#x27;s surface: ordinary map form. However, some parameters can often be displayed in profile view showing a vertical profile of the parameter mapped. Some of the most common parameters mapped in profile are air pollutant concentrations and sound levels. In each of those cases it may be important to analyze (air pollutant concentrations or sound levels) at varying heights so as to determine the air quality or noise health effects on people at different elevations, for example, living on different floor levels of an urban apartment. In actuality, both plan and profile view contour maps are used in air pollution and noise pollution studies.

== Labeling contour maps ==

Labels are a critical component of elevation maps. A properly labeled contour map helps the reader to quickly interpret the shape of the terrain. If numbers are placed close to each other, it means that the terrain is steep. Labels should be placed along a slightly curved line &quot;pointing&quot; to the summit or nadir, from several directions if possible, making the visual identification of the summit or nadir easy. Contour labels can be oriented so a reader is facing uphill when reading the label.

Manual labeling of contour maps is a time-consuming process, however, there are a few software systems that can do the job automatically and in accordance with cartographic conventions, called automatic label placement.

<text>Lisdoonvarna () is a spa town in County Clare in Ireland. The town is famous for its music and festivals. Although the music festival was discontinued in the 1980s, Lisdoonvarna still hosts its annual matchmaking festival each September. The population was 829 at the 2016 census.

==Geography==
Lisdoonvarna is located in the area of County Clare known as the Burren, on the N67 road between Ballyvaughan and Ennistymon. The Aille River flows through the town, where it is joined by the Gowlaun and Kilmoon streams.

The town is in the civil parish of Kilmoon. Nearby townlands in this parish include Ballyinsheen Beg, Ballyinsheen More, Rathbaun and Rooska.

==Name==
The town takes its name from the Irish &quot;Lios Dúin Bhearna&quot; meaning the &quot;lios dúin&quot;, or enclosured fort, of the gap (&quot;bearna&quot;). It is believed that the fort referred to in this name is the green earthen fort of Lissateeaun (&quot;fort of the fairy hill&quot;), which lies 3 km to the northeast of the town, near the remains of a Norman-era castle.

==History==
The present town is a comparatively new one by Irish standards, dating mainly from the start of the 19th century.

The spa official opened in 1845, but the town was visited before by people partaking of the waters. Even by the 1880s, however, the facilities were quite primitive. The wells were privately owned by the Guthrie family and were later developed and baths built by the new owner, a Dr. Westropp, who lived in a house overlooking the spa.

On 11 September 1887, the house of landowner Mike Walsh was attacked by &quot;moonlighters&quot; (members of one of the organized bands of desperados that carried on a system of agrarian outrages in Ireland). A detachment of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) defended the house and its owner, and there was heavy fighting in and around the house. Head Constable Whelehan was killed. All the moonlighters were captured. Seven constables, four acting constables and two head constables received the Constabulary Medal for valour.

The spa prospered into the 20th century. In 1920, it was called the &quot;Homberg of the Irish priests&quot;.

The area was officially classified as part of the West Clare Gaeltacht, an Irish-speaking community, until 1956.

Historical maps of Lisdoonvarna show how the Main Street looked in the nineteenth century. It also gives the location of the RIC barracks and the many hotels associated with the town, such as Queen&#x27;s Hotel and Eagle Hotel, amongst others.

==Arts and culture==
===Events===

In September each year one of Europe&#x27;s largest matchmaking events is held in the town attracting upwards of 40,000 romantic hopefuls, bachelor farmers and accompanying revellers. The month-long event is an important tourist attraction. The current matchmaker is Willie Daly, a fourth-generation matchmaker.

A now-defunct music festival which took place near the town is celebrated in a song of the same name written by the Irish folk singer Christy Moore. This festival took place until 1983, when the last event was marred by a riot and the accidental drowning of eight people.

==Infrastructure==
===Spa===
The spa originally consisted of four wells. Copperas Well, on Kilmoon stream, is now closed. It was used externally for skin conditions, ulcers and sores. The Magnesia and Iron Well remains open in season. The Twin Wells offer water rich in iron and sulphur. The main Sulphur Well lies at the bottom of the hill. All the waters contain iodine.

The spa park is located at the confluence of the Aille and Gowlaun rivers. The spa complex features a Victorian pump house among other amenities.

===Transport===
Bus Éireann route 350 links Lisdoonvarna to several locations: Ennis, Ennistymon, Cliffs of Moher, Doolin, Fanore, Kinvara and Galway. There are a number of journeys each way daily. Onward rail and bus connections are available at Ennis and Galway.

Spectacle Bridge, spanning the Aille river, dates from 1850.

<text>The São Paulo Museum of Art (, or &quot;&quot;) is an art museum in São Paulo, Brazil. It is well known for the architectural significance of its headquarters, a 1968 concrete and glass structure designed by Lina Bo Bardi. It is considered a landmark of the city and a symbol of modern Brazilian architecture.

The museum was founded in 1947 by Assis Chateaubriand and Pietro Maria Bardi, and is maintained as a non-profit institution. MASP distinguished itself by its involvement in several important initiatives concerning museology and art education in Brazil, as well as for its pioneering role as a cultural center. It was also the first Brazilian museum to display post-World War II art.

The museum is internationally recognized for its collection of European art, considered to be one of the finest in both Latin America and the Southern Hemisphere. It also houses an important collection of Brazilian art, prints and drawings, as well as smaller collections of African and Asian art, antiquities, decorative arts, and others, amounting to more than 8,000 pieces. MASP also contains one of the largest art libraries in the country. The entire collection was placed on the Brazilian National Heritage list by Brazil&#x27;s Institute of History and Art.

==History==
===General context===

At the end of the 1940s, the Brazilian economy was going through large structural changes as a result of accelerating industrialization. The city of São Paulo subsequently established itself as the most important industrial hub in the country. Prior to that time, São Paulo&#x27;s role in modern art had been marked by the Week of Modern Art of 1922. Despite the importance this event had enjoyed in the 1920s, Modernism wouldn&#x27;t draw much attention of city dwellers and institutions in the following decades. There was only one art museum in São Paulo, the Pinacoteca do Estado, solely devoted to Academic art, and a commercial gallery.

Assis Chateaubriand, founder and owner of the &quot;Diários Associados,&quot; or &quot;Associated Daily Press&quot;, the largest media and press conglomerate of Brazil at the time, was one of the most influential individuals of this period. In the late 1940s, Chateaubriand started a campaign to acquire masterpieces to form an art collection of international renown in Brazil. He intended to host the museum in Rio de Janeiro, but ultimately chose São Paulo, where he believed it would be easier to gather the necessary funds, since this city was enjoying a very prosperous moment. At the same time, the European art market had been deeply influenced by the end of World War II, making it possible to acquire fine artworks for reasonable prices.

With the help of Pietro Maria Bardi, an Italian professor, critic, art dealer and former owner of galleries in Milan and Rome, Chateaubriand created a &quot;Museum of Classical and Modern Art&quot;. Though he initially planned to lead the project for only a year, Bardi dedicated the rest of his life to it. He moved to Brazil together with his wife, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and brought along his library and his private art collection.

===Beginnings (1947–1957)===

The museum was inaugurated and opened to the public on 2 October 1947, displaying the first acquisitions, among them canvases by Picasso and Rembrandt. In these first years of activity, the museum was located on the upper floors of the Diarios Associados headquarters in the Centro neighborhood of São Paulo. Architect Lina Bo Bardi was in charge of adapting the building to the needs of the museum, dividing it into four distinct areas: an art gallery, a didactic exposition room about the history of art, a temporary exhibition room and an auditorium.

MASP was the first Brazilian art museum interested in acquiring works of modern art. The museum quickly became a meeting point for artists, students and intellectuals, attracted not only by its holdings, but also by the workshops and art courses it offered.

In the 1950s, the museum created the Institute of Contemporary Art (offering workshops of engraving, drawing, painting, sculpture, dance and industrial design), the Publicity School (presently Superior School of Propaganda and Marketing), organizing debates about cinema and literature and creating a youth orchestra and a ballet company. The courses were frequently given by important names of the Brazilian artistic scene, such as the painters Lasar Segall and Roberto Sambonet, the architects Gian Carlo Palanti and Lina Bo Bardi, the sculptor August Zamoyski, and the motion-picture technician Alberto Cavalcanti.

Along with the amplification of the educational program, the museum expanded its collection and began to be recognized internationally. Between 1953 and 1957, a selection of 100 masterpieces housed in the museum traveled throughout European museums, such as Musée de l&#x27;Orangerie (Paris) and the Tate Gallery (London), in a series of exhibitions organized with the intent of consolidating the collection. In 1957, the collection was also displayed in the United States at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and in the Toledo Museum of Art. The following year, the holdings of MASP were exhibited at other Brazilian venues, such as the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes, in Rio de Janeiro. This established the museum on a global level.

===Consolidation of the museum===
The collection&#x27;s rising growth and importance soon required the construction of a building to headquarter the museum. With that purpose, the São Paulo City Hall donated a plot of ground, previously occupied by the Belvedere Trianon – a traditional meeting point of the Paulistano wealthy, which had been demolished in 1951 – to host the first edition of São Paulo Art Biennial. The ground on Paulista Avenue had been donated to the City Hall with the condition that the view to the downtown area and the valley of the Nove de Julho Avenue be preserved.

The new MASP building was the brainchild of Lina Bo Bardi. To preserve the required view of the downtown area, Bardi idealized a building suspended above ground, supported by four massive rectangular columns made of concrete. The construction is considered to be unique worldwide for its peculiarity: the main body of the building stands on four lateral supporting pillars, generating a free area of 74 meters underneath the sustained building. Constructed between 1956 and 1968, the new site of the museum was inaugurated on 7 November by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom during her visit to Brazil.

Assis Chateaubriand would not get to see the inauguration of the new building. He died months before, a victim of thrombosis. The media empire which he developed had also been facing difficulties since the beginning of the 1960s. Growing debts and the competition in the media market by Roberto Marinho&#x27;s press conglomerate – caused the scarcity of the funds which had permitted the gathering of the collection.

The overthrow of Diários Associados and the death of its founder made the government intervene and pay for some of the debts contracted with foreign institutions. During the government of president Juscelino Kubitschek, Caixa Econômica Federal granted a loan to honor the financial obligations of the institution and secured the loan with its art collections. Years later, in the 1970s, the museum&#x27;s debt with the Brazilian government was negotiated and paid off.

In 1969, in response to a request by the museum, the Brazilian Institute for Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) registered MASP&#x27;s holdings as part of the national .

In the 1970s the museum gained fame in the Eastern Hemisphere by organizing many exhibitions using selected works of its collection at Japanese museums. In 1973, the collection was presented at the Ministry of Foreign Relations in Brasília. MASP&#x27;s collection was presented again in Japan in 1978/79, 1982/83, 1990/91, and 1995. In 1992, works of the French school and Brazilian landscapes were exhibited in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, in Santiago, Chile, and in the Biblioteca Luís Angel Aragón, in Bogotá.

==The building==


Construction on the present building of the museum began in 1957, and the building was inaugurated in 1968 and has 25 m high. MASP is famous for its remarkable Brazilian modern architecture structure, and it is considered one of the landmarks of city. It is located on the former site of Belvedere Trianon on Paulista Avenue, from which it was possible to see the Centro of São Paulo at that time and the Cantareira Mountains beyond. José Borges de Figueiredo, the investor who sold the plot of ground to the City Hall, wrote a non-binding letter to the administration, asking that it to be preserved as a &quot;public place in perpetuity&quot;. While in the following years multiple proposed projects ignored his wish, the architect Lina Bo Bardi and engineer José Carlos Figueiredo Ferraz ultimately conceived an underground block as well as a reinforced concrecte in tension suspended structure. The structure stands 8 meters above the ground, supported by 4 pillars connected by two huge concrete beams. A free space of between the pillars was the largest free span in the world at that time. The building inaugurated the so-called protected reinforced concrete technique in Brazil. Each of the 2 floors of exposition has some 7 meters of ceiling.

In the construction, totalling approximately , there are – besides the permanent and temporary exhibition galleries – library, photo gallery, film gallery, video gallery, 2 auditoriums, restaurant, store, workshop rooms, administrative offices and a technical area. The building&#x27;s installations and finishing are homely, as Lina Bo herself described: &quot;Concrete visible, whitewash, a flagstone flooring covering the great Civic Hall, tempered glass, plastic walls. Industrial black rubber flooring covering inner spaces. The belvedere is a &#x27;square&#x27;, with plants and flowers around, paved with parallelepipeds, according to Iberian-Brazilian tradition. There are also water spaces, small water mirrors with aquatic plants. [...] I didn&#x27;t search for beauty. I&#x27;ve searched for freedom&quot;. In 2003, the building was also registered as national patrimony by Brazilian Institute for Historic and Artistic Heritage.

In the museographic area, Lina Bo Bardi also innovated by using tempered crystal sheets leaned on concrete blocks bases as display supports for the paintings. The intention is to imitate the position of the canvas on the painter&#x27;s easel, but it also has roots in interwar Italian exhibition design. In the reverse of these supports, which are not used anymore, there were labels with information about the painter and the work. Paradoxically, the museum abandoned this model of exhibition at the end of the 1990s, when the method was beginning to be noticed and implemented by foreign institutions and artists.

Between 1996 and 2001, the current administration of the museum undertook a vast and controversial reform. Despite the indispensable restoration of the general structure, dramatic changes implemented by the architect and former director of the institution Julio Neves included the substitution of the original floor conceived by Lina Bo, the installation of a second elevator, the construction of a third underground floor, and the substitution of the water mirrors for gardens. Some architects allege that the reform caused a profound distortion of Lina&#x27;s original project.

In 2021 the museum planned to build a 14-story 72 m high extension with an underground link to its current building, which was completed by the end of 2024. The construction costed R$ 250 million and expanded the exhibition area from 10.485 m2 to 21.863 m2. The annex, called Edifício Pietro Maria Bardi, was built in a style of a modern black monolith, replacing completely the 1954 10-story art-deco styled Dumont Adams Highrise. From 2013 to 2019 there was a negotiation of R$ 13 million with mobile telephone company Vivo to build a 125 m high observation tower, of architect Julio Neves, in the place, but they were unsuccessful.

==The collection==
===The formation of the collection===
The main body of the collection was assembled between 1947 and 1960. Pietro Maria Bardi, formerly owner of commercial galleries in Milan and Rome, was in charge of searching and selecting the works which should be acquired, while Chateaubriand looked for donors and patrons, trying to tempt potential ones with banquets and lavish ceremonies. 

These methods drew lots of criticism, as was the fact that the museum acquired works of art without the proper corroboration of authenticity. This impression was endorsed by the fact that the museum was at the time, just after WWII, one of the major buyers of art in the international market. Unlike other institutions, whose acquisitions depended on approval of a curators council, the São Paulo Museum of Art usually acquired its pieces quickly, sometimes by telegram. The works of art were generally acquired at Christie&#x27;s, Marlborough, Sotheby&#x27;s, Knoedler, Seligman and Wildenstein.
At the end of the 1960s, Chateaubriand&#x27;s press conglomerate was facing troubles, with growing debts and competition from Roberto Marinho&#x27;s media companies. The financial difficulties of Diários Associados caused the decline of the museum&#x27;s financial resources. Consequently, the museum then added to its collection through spontaneous donations of artists, companies and private collectors.

===Overview of the collection===
The São Paulo Museum of Art collection is considered the largest and more comprehensive collection of Western art in Latin America. Among the 8,000 works of the museum, the collection of European paintings, sculptures, drawings, engravings, and decorative arts stands out. Early modern French and Italian schools of painting are broadly represented, forming the main body of the collection, followed by Spanish, Portuguese, Flemish, Dutch, English and German masters.

The museum also keeps a significant collection of Brazilian art and &quot;Brasiliana&quot;, which shows the development of Brazilian art from 17th century to the present. The museum also possesses important holdings of Latin American art and North American art.

On a smaller scale, the museum&#x27;s holdings include representative objects of many periods and distinct non-Western civilizations – such as African and Asian arts – and others which stand out for their technological, archaeological, historic, and artistic relevance, like the select collections of Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek and Roman antiquities, besides other artifacts of Pre-Columbian cultures and medieval European art.

== Claims for Nazi-looted art ==
The museum faces controversy regarding five sculptures by Edgar Degas which are claimed by the family of Alfred Flechtheim who alleges they were stolen by the Nazis during World War II.

==Theft==
On 20 December 2007, around 5:09 am, three men broke in to MASP and stole two paintings considered to be among the most valuable pieces in the museum&#x27;s collection: &quot;O Lavrador de Café&quot; (&quot;The Coffee Farmer&quot;) by Cândido Portinari, and the &quot;Portrait of Suzanne Bloch&quot; by Pablo Picasso. It took the perpetrators just three minutes in total to successfully carry out the heist, using a hydraulic jack and a crowbar. Art experts estimated the value of the paintings to be around $55-56 million in U.S. dollars. Both pieces were recovered by the Brazilian police a few weeks after they were stolen, on 8 January 2008, in the city of Ferraz de Vasconcelos, in Greater São Paulo. Two suspects were arrested, although the Brazilian Minister of Culture, Gilberto Gil, speculated that the thieves were &quot;linked to international gangs.&quot; The incident was described as &quot;a major embarrassment&quot; for the museum, which was revealed to have &quot;no alarm system and no sensors. Video security cameras captured some of the raid but, since it had no infrared capability, the images were obscure.&quot; Additionally, none of the museum&#x27;s collection was insured. MASP&#x27;s president, Julio Neves, stated that they did not have the resources to finance a modern security system, and that they had instead &quot;opted for security by patrolling, with people and cameras&quot;; he promised improvements in light to the incident. Just two months before the robbery, &quot;two thieves tried to break into the museum but were spotted and fled&quot;, and in 2005, MASP was forced to close temporarily &quot;when its power was cut off for nonpayment of bills.&quot;

<doc id="650115" wikidata="Q3052957" url="?curid=650115" title="War of the Emboabas">
<text>The War of the &quot;Emboabas&quot; () was a conflict in colonial Brazil waged in 1706-1707 and 1708-1709 over newly discovered gold fields, which had set off a rush to the region between two generations of Portuguese settlers in the viceroyalty of Brazil - then the Captaincy of São Vicente. The discovery of gold set off a rush to the region, Paulistas asserted rights of discovery and non-Paulistas challenged their claims. Although the Portuguese crown sought more control in the area and the Paulistas sought protection of their claims, the Emboabas won. The crown re-assessed its position in the region and made administrative changes subsequently.

==History==
Starting from the village of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga (now São Paulo) the Bandeirantes had explored most of what is now southeastern and southwestern Brazil, effectively taking advantage of the union of the Crowns of Portugal and Spain from 1580 to 1640 to incorporate all the former Spanish territories then west of the Tordesilhas Line. Their goal was to capture new Indian slaves (which put them in conflict with the Jesuit Reductions), recapture runaway slaves and find precious minerals.

Their search was rewarded in an area just north of their original Capitania, until then inaccessible, which became Minas dos Matos Gerais and is now Minas Gerais. However the mines, while rich, were in a vast area they could not effectively settle, so they attracted a gold rush from Portugal. The newcomers, called Emboabas, found an alternative, shorter route to the sea; the Caminho Novo das Minas dos Matos Gerais to São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro on Guanabara Bay, bypassing and alienating the original discoverers.

The Bandeirantes, or Paulistas, tried to assert rights of precedence but were defeated. As a result, the provinces of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro were formed, their capital cities of Vila Rica do Ouro Preto and São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro, respectively, became the new centers of power in the vice-kingdom of Brazil. São Sebastião (later shortened to its present name of Rio de Janeiro) became the capital city of the viceroyalty and later of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.

As soon as news of the discovery of gold spread thousands of outsiders moved to the area and became known pejoratively as &quot;Emboabas&quot;. The term is derived from the Tupi &quot;mbóaba&quot; which literally means &quot;hairy leg&quot; (&quot;mbo&quot; (leg) + &quot;tab&quot; (hairy)). Originally the term referred to birds with feathered legs and as, unlike the Paulista pioneers, the outsiders always wore knee-high boots with their trousers tucked in, giving them the name.
 

Alternatively, according to the Dicionário Houaiss &quot;emboaba&quot; could be derived from the Tupi words &quot;mbo&quot; (do) and &quot;tab&quot; (hurt) meaning &quot;those who invade or attack&quot; and would be applied to a group rather than an individual.

==Consequences==

* Regulation of the distribution of mines between Emboabas and Paulistas.
* Regulation of collection of the &quot;quinto do ouro&quot; tax.
* Breakup on 3 November 1709 of the Province of São Vicente into &quot;São Paulo e Minas de Ouro&quot; and &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot;, ruled directly by the Crown.
* São Paulo attained city status.
* End of the wars in the mining areas with the crown assuming the administrative control of the region.
* The defeat of Paulistas caused some of them to move west where, years later, they would discover new gold deposits in the current states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso and Goiás.
* The production of gold after the war increased so that Minas Gerais became the richest region of Brazil between 1740 and 1760.

<text>Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne (22 May 1724 – 12 June 1772) was a French privateer, East India captain and explorer. The expedition he led to find the hypothetical &quot;Terra Australis&quot; in 1771 made important geographic discoveries in the south Indian Ocean and anthropological discoveries in Tasmania and New Zealand. In New Zealand they spent longer living on shore than any previous European expedition. Half way through the expedition&#x27;s stay Marion was killed during a military assault by the Ngare Raumati iwi (tribe) of Maori.

He is commemorated with the toponyms Marion Island, South Africa and Marion Bay, Tasmania, as well in the name of two successive French oceanic research and supply vessel the &quot;Marion Dufresne&quot; (1972) and the &quot;Marion Dufresne II&quot;, which service the French Southern Territories of Amsterdam Island, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, and Saint Paul Island.

==Early career==
Born in Saint Malo in 1724 into the non-noble, but wealthy, Marion family of shipowners and merchants, he eventually inherited a farm &#x27;Le Fresne&#x27; near the village of Saint-Jean-sur-Vilaine and styled himself Marion Dufresne (or in some instances Dufresne-Marion). He was never known simply as (or signed himself) &#x27;Du Fresne&#x27;, but this has become a familiar appellation in New Zealand and Tasmania. He first went to sea in 1741 on a voyage to Cadiz aboard the 22-gun &quot;Saint-Ésprit&quot;.

During the War of the Austrian Succession Marion commanded several ships as a privateer, including the Prince de Conty where he transported Charles Edward Stuart from Scotland to France. In the Seven Years&#x27; War, he was engaged in various naval operations including taking the astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingré to observe the 1761 transit of Venus in the Indian Ocean.

In January 1762 Marion received a grant of 625 argents of land at Quartier Militaire in Mauritius. Although he returned to France in 1764 and 1767, he made the island home in 1768.

== Terra Australis expedition ==

In October 1770 Marion convinced Pierre Poivre, the civil administrator in Port Louis, to equip him with two ships and send him on a twofold mission to the Pacific. Marion&#x27;s fellow explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville had recently returned from the Pacific with a Tahitian native, Ahutoru. Marion was tasked with returning Ahutoru to his homeland, and then to explore the south Pacific for the hypothetical &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot;. For these purposes Marion was given two ships, the &quot;Mascarin&quot; and the &quot;Marquis de Castries&quot; and departed on 18 October 1771.

Marion spent most of his personal fortune on outfitting the expedition with supplies and crew. He hoped to make a significant profit on the journey by trading with the reportedly wealthy islands of the South Pacific. No part of Marion&#x27;s mission could be achieved; Ahutoru died of smallpox shortly after embarkation, and the expedition did not locate Terra Australis or make a profit from trade. Instead, Marion discovered first the Prince Edward Islands and then the Crozet Islands before sailing towards New Zealand and Australia. His ships spent several days in Tasmania, where Marion Bay in the south-east is named after him. He was the first European to encounter the Aboriginal Tasmanians.

=== Arrival in New Zealand ===
Marion sighted New Zealand&#x27;s Mount Taranaki on 25 March 1772, and named the mountain &quot;Pic Mascarin&quot; without knowing that James Cook had named it &quot;Mount Egmont&quot; three years earlier.

Over the next month, they repaired their two ships and treated their scurvy, first anchoring at Spirits Bay, and later in the Bay of Islands. Apparently their relations with Maori were peaceful at first; they communicated through the Tahitian vocabulary learned from Ahu-toru and sign language. They befriended many Maori including Te Kauri (Te Kuri) of the Ngāpuhi iwi (tribe). The French established a significant vegetable garden on Moturua Island. Sixty of the French sailors had developed scurvy and were on shore in a tent hospital. They had been invited to visit local Maori at their pa – a very rare event – and had slept there overnight. Maoris in return had been invited on board the ships and had slept in the ships overnight. The French officers made a detailed study of the habits and customs of Maoris including greetings, sexual mores, fishing methods, the role of females, the making of fern root paste, the killing of prisoners and cannibalism.

In these months there were two instances where Maoris were detained. The first had sneaked on board ship and stolen a cutlass. He was detained for a brief period to give him a fright, then released to his friends. Later the Maoris made a night raid on the hospital camp taking away many guns and uniforms. While the soldiers chased the raiders, Maoris slipped back and stole an anchor. Two men were held as hostage against the return of the stolen goods. One of them admitted he had been involved in the theft but accused Te Kauri of being involved. Marion, finding the men bound, ordered them unbound and released. Later an armed party of Maoris approached the French as if to challenge them, but the French understood enough tikanga to make peace with them by exchanging gifts.

=== Death and reprisals ===
No French witness to Marion&#x27;s death survived and it was some time before his crew were aware of his fate. Two contemporary accounts were written by French officers, Jean Roux and Ambroise du Clesmeur.

During the night of 9 June 1772, French sentries at the hospital camp noticed about six Maoris prowling. In the morning it was discovered that Maoris had also been prowling around a second camp where the French had been making masts. The next day Maoris arrived with a present of fish. Roux said the Maoris were astonished at the blunderbusses he had mounted outside his tent. He noticed the visiting chief taking a close look at the weapons and how they worked, as well as the defences of the camp, and became suspicious of his motives. The chief asked for the guns to be demonstrated and Roux shot a dog.

That night more Maoris were found on Moturua Island prowling around the hospital camp but ran when sentries approached. Captain du Clesmeur alerted Marion to the rise in suspicious activity, but Marion did not listen. On the afternoon of 12 June 1772 Marion and 15 armed sailors went to Te Kauri&#x27;s village and then went in the captain&#x27;s gig to go fishing in his favourite fishing area. Marion and 26 men of his crew were killed. Those killed included de Vaudricourt and Pierre Lehoux (a volunteer), Thomas Ballu of Vannes, Pierre Mauclair (the second pilot) from St Malo, Louis Ménager (the steersman) from Lorient, Vincent Kerneur of Port-Louis, Marc Le Garff from Lorient, Marc Le Corre of Auray, Jean Mestique of Pluvigner, Pierre Cailloche of Languidic and Mathurin Daumalin of Hillion.

That night 400 armed Maoris suddenly attacked the hospital camp but were stopped in their tracks by the threat of the multiple blunderbusses. Roux held his fire and realised that they had narrowly escaped being killed in their sleep. One chief told Roux that Te Kauri had killed Marion. At this point longboats full of armed French sailors arrived with the news that Marion and the sailors had been killed. One survivor, who had been spared, told them Maoris had tricked them into going into the bush, where they had been ambushed, with all the others being killed.

In the following days the French came under relentless attack. The next day about 1,200 Maoris surrounded the French, led by Te Kauri. As they approached, Roux ordered Te Kauri shot. Later even more Maori reinforcements arrived. The French decided to abandon the hospital camp. The Maori then stole all the tools and supplies and burnt the camp down. They were close enough that the French could see they were wearing the clothes of Marion and his fellow dead sailors.

The French retreated to Moturua Island. That night Maoris again attacked the camp and this time the French opened a general fire. The next day even more Maoris arrived taking their forces to about 1,500 men. The French charged this huge force with 26 armed soldiers and put them to flight, the Maoris fleeing back to Te Kauri&#x27;s pa. The French attacked the pa, firing at the defenders, who showered them with spears. The remainder got into canoes and fled. About 250 Maoris including five chiefs were killed in the battle. Many of the French were wounded.

Roux, Julien–Marie Crozet and Ambroise Bernard-Marie du Clesmeur took joint command and undertook reprisals against the Maoris over a one-month period as the ships were prepared for departure.

A month later on 7 July Roux searched Te Kauri&#x27;s deserted pa and found a sailor&#x27;s cooked head on a spike, as well as human bones near a fire. They left on 12 July 1772. The French buried a bottle at Waipoa on Moturua, containing the arms of France and a formal statement taking possession of the whole country, with the name of &quot;France Australe.&quot; However, both published and unpublished accounts of Marion&#x27;s death circulated widely, giving New Zealand a bad reputation as a dangerous land unsuitable for colonisation, and challenged the stereotypes of Pacific Islanders as noble savages then prevalent in Europe.

===Possible motives for military assault ===
There are different possible reasons for the Maori military assault on the landing site, including that the chief Te Kauri (Te Kuri) considered that Marion was a threat to his authority or Te Kauri became concerned at the economic effect of supplying food for the two crews, or that Marion&#x27;s crew, possibly unwittingly, broke several &quot;tapu&quot; laws related to their not carrying out the rituals required before the cutting down of kauri trees, or breaking of tapu by fishing in Manawaora Bay.

An account told by a Ngāpuhi elder to John White (ethnographer 1826–1891), but not published until 1965, describes Te Kauri and Tohitapu as leading the military resolution to the landing. Tapu had been placed on Manawaora Bay after members of the local tribe drowned here some time earlier, and their bodies had been washed up at Te Kauri&#x27;s (Tacoury&#x27;s sic) Cove. Since the interlopers did not leave, a military resolution was required.

<doc id="650127" wikidata="Q2084226" url="?curid=650127" title="Windgap, County Kilkenny">
<text>Windgap (), is a village in County Kilkenny, in Ireland. Windgap is located in the south-western part of Kilkenny on the border with Tipperary, just south of Callan. The village is located on the R689 regional road, the nearest main road being the N76 from Kilkenny to Clonmel.

Windgap was named for its location on a pass through hills east of Slievenamon. The landscape of Windgap is dominated by steep hills and large wooded areas. Windgap lies in a former slate-quarrying district spanning the Kilkenny-Tipperary border. Today, agriculture is Windgap&#x27;s main economic activity, with dairy products as the main export. The most notable buildings in Windgap are its 19th-century graveyard, &quot;The Old League House&quot;, which once served as a home for poor tenant farmers (see Irish National Land League), and early 20th-century grotto.

Those who hail from the village are sometimes referred to as &#x27;Gappers&#x27;.

==History and culture==
&quot;The Mayor of Windgap&quot; is an 1834 novel by Michael Banim set in Windgap in 1779. Windgap is also referred to in the 1907 book &quot;The Placenames of the Decies&quot; by Rev. P. Power.
==Sport==
Windgap GAA club was founded in 1954 following the advent of the &quot;one parish rule&quot; in the county. Gaelic games have been played in the area since the 1890s. In the early days, it was better known for football, but hurling was played with the Slatequarries in 1929 and St. Joseph &#x27;s in Tullahought in the 1940s. Handball first made its appearance in the Slatequarries in the early 1900s before it spread to Windgap. Camogie started in Lamogue in the 1920s and was played in many areas of the parish with teams representing Windgap and Tullahought at various stages. Ladies Football was played in the area for a time in the 1970s with a team in Tullahought. Windgap Camogie Club that was founded in 1994 and Windgap Handball Club in 1984. Galmoy and Windgap&#x27;s teams amalgamated in 2005.

<text>Borisoglebsky () is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) and the administrative center of Borisoglebsky District of Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia, located on the Ustye River, from Rostov and southwest of Yaroslavl. Population: 4,600 (1968).

The settlement&#x27;s principal tourist attraction is the famous Borisoglebsky Monastery, now a museum. The monastery is named after Saints Boris and Gleb. The monastery was favored by Ivan the Terrible who personally supervised the construction of towered walls and bell-tower around an even more ancient cathedral. The only addition made to the monastery after Ivan&#x27;s death is a superb carved barbican church, commissioned by the metropolitan Iona Sysoevich in the late 17th century.

In 2005, the statues of monk Peresvet (by Zurab Tsereteli) and of Prince Pozharsky were installed near the monastery walls.

<doc id="650134" wikidata="Q2566680" url="?curid=650134" title="Cratloe">
<text>Cratloe () is a village in County Clare, Ireland, situated between Limerick and Shannon in the mid-west of Ireland. It is possible that the name derives from &quot;Croit-shliabh&quot; meaning &quot;hump-backed hill&quot;, referring to Woodcock Hill. The present-day parish of Cratloe consists of the former parish of Kilfintinan and a portion of the contemporary parish of Killeely. This was agreed upon by priests in the 18th century, who claimed there were not enough members of the clergy to operate fully in both parishes.

==History==
The area of Cratloe is first mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters, where it is recorded that in 376 AD, Crimthann mac Fidaig, King of Munster and High King of Ireland died in the Cratloe area from poison administered by his sister, Mongfind, who wished for her son Brión mac Echach Muigmedóin to be High King. Mongfind herself also died later, as she drank the poison to convince the king to take some. In the end, however, Brian had to settle for the Kingdom of Connaught, while the High Kingship went to his half-brother, who was later known as Niall of the Nine Hostages.

In the 9th century, when the McNamaras territory was invaded by warriors from the Kingdom of Aileach in Ulster, the invaders chopped down oak trees in Cratloe Woods and brought them back to Ulster for the roof of the Aileach Royal Palace. Cratloe Woods have since been known for their oak trees and their wood used in many important buildings throughout Europe.

It was recorded in 940 that King Muirchertach of the Leather Cloaks and his forces, found that Cretshalach, as it was then known, was the worst passageway during their Circuit of Ireland. In ancient times the passageway through Cratloe ran over a steep hill, and was the main route from Munster into Connacht. The army stayed the night on top of the mountain where High King Crimthann was murdered, Sliabh-Suidhe-an-riogh, or in English, The Mountain Of The Death Of The King.
In 1216 it was formally granted to the Corporation of Limerick by King John, as part of the North Liberties. In 1510, an Anglo-Irish army led by Gerald Mór FitzGerald, the 8th earl of Kildare, marched on Thomond, and was met and defeated near Cratloe by an army of the O&#x27;Brien, McNamara, Sil-Aedha and Clanrickard clans led by Turlough O&#x27;Brien, son of Teige Mac Murrough O&#x27;Brien, the Lord of Thomond. The invading army were defeated with ease as the entire force had taken the short cut through Cratloe into Limerick, and as a result were ambushed by the Gaelic army. It was annexed to the County of Clare following the 1840 Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act.

==Geography==
Cratloe is bounded to the south by the tidal estuary of the River Shannon, and to the west by the Ratty/ Uí gCearnaigh (Garney) river. A large part of the eastern boundary is formed by a creek known locally as the Sandy River, or the Cratloe Creek.
With the exceptions of a few low hills, the portion of Cratloe south of the N18 dual-carriageway, and west of the R462 to Sixmilebridge mainly consists of the low lying flood plains of the tidal rivers. The farmlands in these areas are protected by levees.
The remainder of the parish consists of the south-western and western portion of Woodcock Hill, which summits at 310 m (1,016 ft) just outside Cratloe&#x27;s boundary. The western side of this hill is commonly known as Gallows Hill, named after the executions of rebels by Cromwellian forces that took place here around the year 1650.

===Cratloe Woods===

A state forest has been planted over a large portion of the Cratloe area, with mostly spruce and pine trees covering the 800 acre woodland. On the back road to Limerick that passes through the village, the ancient oak trees of Garranon Wood are still visible, and the forest has been historically dated to exist from at least 700 AD. The oak trees from this forest provided the timbers for the roofs of London&#x27;s Westminster Hall and the Royal Palace in Amsterdam. St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Limerick city was also built using Cratloe timber.

==Places of interest==
The area around Cratloe village contains several ancient and medieval sites. One of the oldest historic sites in the village itself is in the Craughaun Cemetery, where a megalithic wedge tomb, known as the &quot;Ballinphunta Dolmen&quot;, was discovered. This tomb was excavated in 1990 during an enlargement of the graveyard and a replica erected some time later in the newer section of the graveyard. Also in this graveyard is a vault to the Blood family, dating to 1738 when the first member of the family, Robert Maghlin, was buried. The ruins of the old Craughaun Church, dating from 1418, are also present.

D&#x27;Esterre Bridge, built in 1784, crossing the Ratty/O&#x27;gChearnaigh River between Bunratty and Sixmilebridge, is characterised by the ruins of the gate-towers remaining from its days as a toll-crossing. Henry D&#x27;Esterre built this bridge at his own expense as he wanted a crossing close to his own estate. The famous duel in February 1815 between Daniel O&#x27;Connell and Henry D&#x27;Esterre&#x27;s son, John Norcot, arose in local tradition because O&#x27;Connell refused to pay the toll, although this conflicts with the conventional account of the duel.

Within the Garranon Oak Wood, a roadside well known as the &quot;Squire&#x27;s Well&quot; can be found. The novelist and travel writer Georgiana Chatterton stated in 1841 that it flows from a clear stream, but over the time it has not been used, it has nearly been swallowed up in foliage and natural growth. The remnants of several small ráths, or ring-forts are located in various fields around Cratloe, although several of these forts were destroyed when the Western Railway Corridor was built in the late 19th century.

===Castles===
Cratloe is the location of several ruined castles and tower houses, including Cratloemoyle Castle (sometimes referred to as &#x27;Cratloe Castle&#x27;), located just to the north of the N18 road on the approach to Limerick. The castle is 5 stories high and was built sometime in the early 1500s. John McNamara, who died in 1780, was the last occupant of the castle and as he had no one to pass the castle onto, the castle was sold and for the first time in 700 years the land around the castle was not in the possession of the McNamara family.

Less than half a mile away, on the opposite side of the road, Cratloekeel Castle sits on a low outcrop, and can be seen from the road among the surrounding trees. This castle was built by Sean McNamara in the latter part of the 15th century, but by 1641 it had passed out of the McNamara family and was owned by a Dutch Protestant.

Further south, on the banks of the River Shannon, is the site of Castle Donnell or Cratloemore Castle, though now little of the ruins are left. This was once one of the biggest castles in Cratloe, being used by the McNamaras as a trading post because of its location on the River Shannon and its proximity to both Bunratty and Limerick. In 1730 most of this castle was destroyed and the stones were used to build Cratloe Wood House, the only example of an Irish longhouse still lived in by a family.

On the western slopes of Woodcock Hill, towards Sixmilebridge, the ruins of Ballintlea Castle lie in a farmyard. All of these castles are recorded as being built by the MacNamara clan, one of the most powerful families in the Kingdom of Thomond.

===Churches and graveyards===

In addition to the parish church, the Church of St. John, Cratloe, there is another church within the parish, on the approach to the village of Sixmilebridge. This church is known locally as &quot;The Little Church&quot;, and is unusual in that it is not dedicated to any particular saint. This church was built in the late 1700s but was demolished in 1858 and replaced with a new edifice. Again this church was renovated in 1988, with the Bishop of Limerick calling it &quot;the little gem of the Limerick Diocese&quot;.

The ruins of several other chapels and churches can be found in the area. As mentioned above, there is one such ruin within the cemetery at Craughaun, and there is another near Cratloemoyle Castle, which was not really a church but an oratory for the owners of the castle. This oratory, together with the nearby well, were dedicated to St. John. In his 1893 work &quot;The History and Topography of the County of Clare&quot;, James Frost mentions that one Augustus Stafford O&#x27;Brien MP removed the ruins of a friary from the grounds of his residence, Cratloe Woods House, apparently because it interfered with the view. The ruins of the medieval parish church and cemetery of Kilfintenan can be found in the townland of Carrowmore on the road from Sixmilebridge to Gallows Hill.
Kilfintenan graveyard is known as the smallest graveyard in Ireland. This graveyard was reserved for burying children and strangers who were travelling though the parish. The ruins of Cill an Bothair, or the Church of the Road, can also be found in the north of the parish. The graveyard of this church was again specifically used as a burial grounds for children. Kilcredaunnadober Graveyard in the townland of Cratloemore was a small burial ground for unbaptised children.

==Transport==
The largest road that passes through Cratloe is the N18 national primary road that connects Limerick and Galway. The road splits in two at Cratloe, with one direction going towards Limerick and the other bypassing the city via the Limerick Tunnel, changing into the M7 motorway to Dublin just outside the city. The R462 regional road, which begins as the Cratloe exit from the N18, connects the towns of Sixmilebridge and Tulla and the villages of Kilkishen and Kilmurry to Limerick. Shannon Airport and the Shannon Free Zone are located just 15 km away from the village.

The railway line from Limerick to Ennis also passes through the village, although the station remains closed at present. Cratloe railway station opened on 17 January 1859, but finally closed on 17 June 1963. As of 2008 it was hoped, with the re-opening of the Western Railway Corridor in 2010, that Cratloe Station would again be operational in the future. As of 2023, the station is still closed and used as a private dwelling.

==Education==
The local primary school is St. Johns National School, located just across the road from Cratloe Church. There were two previous schools before this school was built in 1980, the first one was built in 1849 and is now the local community hall and the second was built in 1965 and is now a small shopping area. Both these schools were built because of the expanding population. The present school, St. Johns National School, had an enrollment of 285 pupils as of 2023.

==Sport==
The most played sports in Cratloe are Gaelic games, although sports such as rugby and soccer have been catching up. In terms of Gaelic games, 2014 was the most successful year for Cratloe GAA club, as the Clare Senior Hurling Championship and the Clare Senior Football Championship was won, making Cratloe the first club in 85 years to win both senior county titles since Ennis Dalcassians achieved it in 1929. This year also marked Cratloe&#x27;s second Clare Senior Hurling Championship title, with the first coming five years earlier in 2009.

<doc id="650138" wikidata="Q612440" url="?curid=650138" title="Pietro Maria Bardi">
<text>Pietro Maria Bardi (La Spezia, February 21, 1900 – São Paulo, October 1, 1999) was an Italian writer, curator and collector, mostly known for being the Founding Director of the São Paulo Museum of Art in Brazil.

Bardi started his career in the 1920s as a journalist, writing about art and architecture for newspapers like Gazzetta di Genova and Corriere della Sera. Between 1926 and 1930, Bardi&#x27;s focus shifted &quot;from journalism to the art market.&quot; In 1928 he opened the Galleria Bardi in Milan, which exhibited many artists of the Scuola Romana. Two years later he moved to Rome and opened the Galleria di Roma, where the Second Exhibition of Rationalist Architecture was held in 1931. &quot;Throughout the 1930s, Bardi argued for the alliance of Rationalist architecture and fascist politics in the pages of Milan newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Ambrosiano&quot;, in the architecture journal &quot;Quadrante&quot; ... and in the Rome newspaper &quot;Meridiano&quot;.&quot;

Bardi visited Brazil for the first time in 1933 and permanently relocated in São Paulo in 1946 with his wife, architect Lina Bo Bardi. In 1947 he co-founded with Assis Chateaubriand the São Paulo Museum of Art, which he directed until 1996, stirring the Brazilian artistic community with his ideas about popularizing museums by making both modern and classical art more accessible. Hand-in-hand with this idea, he and his wife, Lina Bo Bardi, developed the concept of an open, wide exhibition space where paintings were fixed to acrylic pedestals, thus making the whole space visible at once and the works seemingly suspended in space. The substitution of traditional walls for the acrylic pedestals became a big point of debate.

He died in São Paulo in 1999, four months before his 100th birthday.

<text>The Captaincies of Brazil () were captaincies of the Portuguese Empire, administrative divisions and hereditary fiefs of Portugal in the colony of &quot;Terra de Santa Cruz&quot;, later called Brazil, on the Atlantic coast of northeastern South America. Each was granted to a single donee, a Portuguese nobleman who was given the title captain General.

Beginning in the early 16th century, the Portuguese monarchy used proprietorships or captaincies—land grants with extensive governing privileges—as a tool to colonize new lands. Prior to the grants in Brazil, the captaincy system had been successfully used in territories claimed by Portugal—-notably including Madeira, the Azores, and other Atlantic islands.

In contrast to the generally successful Atlantic captaincies, of all the captaincies of Brazil, only two, the captaincies of Pernambuco and São Vicente (later called São Paulo), are today considered to have been successful. For reasons varying from abandonment, defeat by aboriginal tribes, occupation of Northeast Brazil by the Dutch West India Company, and death of the donatário (lord proprietor) without an heir, all of the proprietorships (captaincies) eventually reverted to or were repurchased by the crown.

They were effectively subsumed by the Governorates General and the States of Brazil and Maranhão starting in 1549, and the last of the privately granted captaincies reverted to the Crown in 1754. Their final boundaries in the latter half of the 18th century became the basis for the provinces of Brazil.

==Establishment as colonies==

Following the successful expedition of Martim Afonso de Sousa in 1530, in order to exploit the trade in brazilwood discovered on the Atlantic coast, as well as explore rumors of vast riches in silver and gold in the interior, the Portuguese Crown determined to establish permanent colonies in their claim on the new continent. The Portuguese realized that they had no human or financial resources to invest in a large and distant colony, and decided to enlist private entrepreneurs, called &quot;donatários&quot;. Each would become owner and administrator of a &quot;capitania&quot; or captaincy, a land grant. This system had previously been successful in settling of the Portuguese colonies, first in Madeira, the Azores and various islands mostly along the coast of Africa.

The first captaincies were drawn in strips parallel to the equator, commencing at the Atlantic coast and terminating in the west at the Tordesillas Line (where Spanish territory began). They were established by King John III of Portugal, starting with Pernambuco by the royal &quot;Golden Letter&quot; (Carto Dourado) on 24 September 1534.

Within a system of royal patronage and nepotism, five of the captaincies were given to two cousins of finance minister António de Ataíde: Martim Afonso de Sousa and his brother Pero Lopes. An additional captaincy was issued to Pero de Gois, captain of Afonso&#x27;s 1530 expedition. The remaining captaincies were granted to a trusted mixture of military men (more precisely called &quot;conquistadores&quot;) and court bureaucrats.

Each captaincy was to be of fifty leagues &quot;height&quot; (measured north-south), but in practice, boundaries were marked by pairs of rivers, a plethora of which emptied into the Atlantic Ocean on the northeastern coast of the continent. So actual heights varied, as shown in the map at right. Initially fifteen, they were granted to twelve donees. They were the following (north to south):

All but four captaincies failed, due to inadequate resources of the donees and lack of support from the Crown. Four donees failed to take possession of their lands, and four more quickly succumbed to Indians. Only four captaincies survived past 1549: São Vicente, Pernambuco, Ilhéus and Porto Seguro.

==Subordination of the Captaincies==
The history of the captaincies is turbulent, reflecting the needs of the Kings of Portugal, a small European country, to colonize and govern an enormous expanse of South America. Throughout the early colonial era Captaincies were granted, divided, subordinated, annexed, and abandoned. In 1548 when the captaincy of &quot;Baía de Todos os Santos&quot; (Bahia) reverted to the Crown due to the massacre, by indigenous cannibals, of its donee, Francisco Pereira Coutinho and his settlers; the King, Dom João III, established a royal governor (later a governor-general) at Bahia. At the same time Dom João rescinded some of the expansive privileges he had previously granted the donatarios (lords-proprietor). However, clearly demonstrating the crowns desire to accommodate whatever worked, Dom João instructed his first Governor to visit all the remaining captaincies, except for Pernambuco, the one singularly successful captaincy. In fact no royal governor visited Pernambuco until the Seventeenth Century. The captaincies continued to exist as governments subordinate to the royal governors, governors-general, and viceroys. All captaincies, sooner or later, reverted to being royal rather than proprietary captaincies (variously thru some failure or repurchase by the crown).

During the Philippine Dynasty, some of the captaincies attained the status of provinces with royal governors (i.e. &quot;states&quot;), and Portuguese Brazil thereafter was a mixture of donatary captaincies, royal captaincies and states.

===List of post-1549 captaincies===

Some complications result from captaincies being merged and recreated with the same name, but representing altered regions. At least a few of the later captaincies were islands or capes of negligible size. Dates are of independent captaincies; in some cases, new captaincies were created as administrative divisions or subcaptaincies of existing ones before becoming fully independent (eg. Para was established as early as 1616 as a north and westward annex of Maranhão).
* Fernando de Noronha (not occupied or abandoned) 1504-1737
* Itaparica and Itamarandiba (islands), 1556, split from Bahia
* Rio de Janeiro, 1563, renamed first (northern) section of São Vicente + Paraiba do Sul(?)

* Paraíba, 1580, created from part of Rio Grande, enlarged by acquisition of most of Itamaracá, 1585
* Rio Grande de Norte, 1597, merger of northern portion of Rio Grande, Ceara and Maranhão
* Cabo Frio, 1615, promontory in Rio de Janeiro
* Pará, ~1616 as division of Maranhão from newly incorporated territory west of the Tordesillas Line; independent in 1652

* São Paulo, 1720, remaining after Minas Gerais split
* Mearim, 1723, within Maranhão
* Cumã, 1727, sub-captaincy split from Maranhão;
* Santa Catarina, 1739, split from São Paulo
* Goiaz, 1748, split from São Paulo

* Alagoas, 1817, split from Pernambuco
*Colônia de Caiena e Guiana, 1809, annexation of French Guiana
* Sergipe, 1820, split from Bahia

== Pernambuco and São Vicente ==

The Captaincy of Pernambuco thrived due to sugarcane plantations. The Captaincy of São Vicente, called São Paulo after the city of São Paulo became its capital in 1681, obtained success through the exploration of the hinterland known as &quot;bandeiras&quot;. In 1621, these became the basis for the southeastern State of Brazil.

==Provinces of Brazil==
In 1815, the State of Brazil was elevated to a kingdom and all existing provinces and Crown captaincies became provinces of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.

==Legacy of the Captaincies==
Thirteen modern states have names of their predecessor captaincies, and several cities. The captaincies immortalized a set of Tupi-guarani place names, chiefly those of rivers and mountains.

In echoes of the feudal system of landed noblemen, the huge fazendas of the 18th and 19th centuries were allocated from the land holdings of the captaincies.

Brazil today still lives with the legacy of a plantation culture that utilized 4million African slaves and concentrated land ownership. An elite 1.7percent of the landowners continue to own nearly half the arable land; the top 10percent of the nation earns half the income.

<doc id="650147" wikidata="Q3502838" url="?curid=650147" title="Thallus (historian)">
<text>Thallus or Thallos (), perhaps a Samaritan, was an early historian who wrote in Koine Greek. He wrote a three-volume history of the Mediterranean world from before the Trojan War to the 167th Olympiad, 112–108 BC, or perhaps to the 217th Olympiad (AD 89-93) or 207th Olympiad (AD 49-52). Most of his work, like the vast majority of ancient literature, has been lost, although some of his writings were quoted by Sextus Julius Africanus in his &quot;History of the World&quot;. It is not known when he lived and wrote, but his work is quoted by Theophilus of Antioch, who died around AD 185, and most scholars date Thallus&#x27; writings to around 50 AD.

The works are considered important by some Christians as confirming the historicity of Jesus and providing non-Christian validation of the Gospel accounts. According to the early Christian scholar Julius Africanus, Thallus apparently refers, in the third book of his histories, to the darkness at the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and explained it away as a solar eclipse; there is a range of interpretations on the matter.

==The fragments of Thallus==
# There are fragments from the 3 books of Thallus, in which he made a summary in abbreviated fashion from the sack of Troy to the 167th Olympiad [&quot;i.e.&quot; 109 BC] (Eusebius, &quot;Chronicle&quot;, I. K125.2)
# Castor and Thallus [recorded] Syrian events. (Sextus Julius Africanus, in Eusebius, &quot;Praeparatio Evangelica&quot;, X.10)
# The archives of the most ancient races—the Egyptians, Chaldaeans, and Phoenicians—need to be opened, and their citizens must be called upon, through whom knowledge must be provided—a certain Manetho the Egyptian and Berossus the Chaldaean, but also Jerome the Phoenician king of Tyre; and their followers, too: Ptolemy the Mendesian and Menander the Ephesian and Demetrius the Phalerean and king Juba and Apion and Thallus and the one who either proves or refutes these men, Josephus the Jew. (Tertullian, &quot;Apologeticum&quot; 19)
# Sextus Julius Africanus writes, concerning the passion of Christ, &quot;Concerning each of his deeds and his cures, both of bodies and souls, and the secrets of his knowledge, and his Resurrection from the dead, this has been explained with complete adequacy by his disciples and the apostles before us. A most terrible darkness fell over all the world, the rocks were torn apart by an earthquake, and many places both in Judaea and the rest of the world were thrown down. In the third book of his Histories, Thallos dismisses this darkness as a solar eclipse. In my opinion, this is nonsense. ...&quot; (Africanus, in George Syncellus, &quot;Cronography&quot;)
# For Thallus also remembers Belus the ruler of Assyria and Cronos the Titan, asserting that Belus waged war along with the Titans against Zeus and the select gods who were with him, stating at this point: &#x27;and defeated, Ogygus fled to Tartessus. While at that time that region was famous as Akte, now it is called Attica, which Ogygus then took over.&#x27; (Theophilus of Antioch, &quot;Ad Autolycum&quot; 3.29)
# For according to the history of Thallus, we find that Belus was born 322 years prior to the Trojan War. (Lactantius, &quot;Divine Institutions&quot; I.23)
# And so ... neither Diodorus the Greek nor Thallus, neither Cassius Severus nor Cornelius Nepos, nor any commentator on such ancient matters, prints that Saturn was anything but a man. (Tertullian, &quot;Apologeticus&quot; 10).
# Therefore, not only all poets, but even all historians and all writers on ancient matters, who have published for posterity his deeds done in Italy, agree he was a man: in Greek, Diodorus and Thallus, and in Latin, Nepos and Cassius and Varro. (Lactantius, &quot;Divine Institutions&quot;. I.13).
# All writers of Greek and Roman antiquities tell us that Saturn, the first of his kind, was a man: Nepos knows this, and Cassius in history, as well as Thallus and Diodorus, say this. (Marcus Minucius Felix, &quot;Octavius&quot;, 21)
# Regarding the events before the Olympiads, consider how the Attic chronologers reckon: from the time of Ogygus, during whose tenure the first great flood occurred in Attica, while Phoroneus was ruling the Argives, as Acusilaus records, up to the time of the first year of the first Olympiad, the point after which the Greeks consider time to be reckoned more accurately, 1020 years passed, which agrees with those mentioned earlier and with those who were listed in order. For the writers on Athenian history, Hellanicus and Philochorus (who wrote &quot;Atthis&quot;) and writers on Syrian affairs, Castor and Thallus, and writers on world affairs, Diodorus (who wrote the &quot;Library&quot;) and Alexander Polyhistor, and some of our contemporaries record these events even more accurately than all the Attic historians. (Africanus, in Eusebius, &quot;Praeparatio Evangelica&quot;, X.10)
# So know this: of all those among us [the Jews] happen to be more ancient than many: [for instance] ... Moses ... as is clear to us in the histories of the Greeks. ... For in the times of Ogygus and Inachus ... they record Moses ... so does Polemon in his first book of history of the Greeks, and Apion ... and Ptolemaeus the Mendesian, who wrote a history of Egypt, all these men agree. And the writers on Athenian history, Hellanicus and Philochorus (who wrote Atthis), Castor and Thallus and Alexander Polyhistor, and also those most wise of men, Philo and Josephus ... [all these men] mention Moses, as they do the very old and ancient origin of the Jews. (Pseudo-Justin, &quot;Cohortatio ad Graecos&quot;, 9)
# 41 Assyrian kings ruled the kingdom of the Arabs, who also ruled from the [?] year of the world to the [?] year of the world, enduring all of [?] years from the first of them, Belus, until the 41st king, Macoscolerus, the son of Sardanapallus, as most noted historians agree, including Polybius, Diodorus, Cephalion, Castor, Thallus and others. (Syncellus, &quot;Chronography&quot;)
# After the 70th year of the captivity, Cyrus was king of the Persians in the first year of the 55th Olympiad, as we find in the &quot;Library&quot; of Diodorus and the &quot;Histories&quot; of Thallus and Castor, and also in the works of Polybius and Phlegon, but also in those of others who concern themselves with Olympiads: they are all in agreement about the date. (Africanus, in Eusebius, &quot;Praeparatio Evangelica&quot;, X.10)
# Those most wise men, Thallus, Castor [259 F 11], and Polybius [254 F 4]...and among others, Herodotus...and the wise Theophilus, all recorded the chronology of the reign of Croesus. (John Malalas, &quot;Chronografia&quot;, VI).

==Time and subjects of work==
Thallus is first mentioned around AD 180 by Theophilus Bishop of Antioch in his &quot;Ad Autolycum&quot; (&#x27;To Autolycus&#x27;), which at 3.29 states:

Thallus makes mention of Belus, the King of the Assyrians, and Cronus the Titan; and says that Belus, with the Titans, made war against Zeus and his compeers, who are called gods. He says, moreover, that Gygus was smitten, and fled to Tartessus. At that time Gygus ruled over that country, which was then called Acte, but is now named Attica. And whence the other countries and cities derived their names, we think it unnecessary to recount, especially to you who are acquainted with history.

Eusebius of Caesarea in a list of sources mentions his work:

From the three books of Thallus, in which he collects (events) briefly from the fall of Ilion [Troy] to the 167th Olympiad.

However the text is preserved in an Armenian translation where many of the numerals are corrupt. The fall of Troy is 1184 BC, but the editors, Petermann and Karst, highlight that the end-date of the 167th Olympiad (109 BC) is contradicted by George Syncellus, who quotes Julius Africanus, and suggest that the end-date should read &quot;217th Olympiad&quot; (AD 89–93), a change of one character in Armenian. Others suggest &quot;207th Olympiad&quot; (AD 49-52).&lt;

==Thallus and Josephus==
Josephus may have referred to Thallus in Antiquities of the Jews 18.6.4:

Now there was another Samaritan, a freed-man of Caesar, of whom he borrowed a million of drachmae, and thence repaid Antonia the debt he owed her; and by sending the overplus in paying his court to Caius, became a person of great authority with him.

The identification depends on two assumptions. All the manuscripts have &quot;another Samaritan&quot; (ἄλλος Σαμαρεὺς γένος) in the section, but since Josephus does not refer to a previous Samaritan in this context, all modern editors except one consider it to be a corruption in the text where the Samaritan&#x27;s name is missing a Θ, and was &quot;Thallos&quot;. The second assumption is that the Thallos being named is the same one Eusebius and Africanus were referring to considering that such a name was likely rare at the time.

Others believe that the name Thallos was common at the time so the reference is not clear. A minority have disagreed with the mainstream view above and have suggested that the text is not corrupted and may have read &quot;Now there was another, namely a Samaritan by race (birth), a freedman of Caesar.&quot; and not have had a person named Thallos.

==Africanus on Thallus==

In his &quot;Chronicle of Theophanes&quot;, 9th-century Christian chronicler George Syncellus cites the &quot;Chronographiai&quot; of Sextus Julius Africanus as writing in reference to the darkness mentioned in the synoptic gospels as occurring at the death of Jesus:

On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun. For the Hebrews celebrate the passover on the 14th day according to the moon, and the passion of our Saviour falls on the day before the passover; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun. And it cannot happen at any other time but in the interval between the first day of the new moon and the last of the old, that is, at their junction: how then should an eclipse be supposed to happen when the moon is almost diametrically opposite the sun? Let that opinion pass however; let it carry the majority with it; and let this portent of the world be deemed an eclipse of the sun, like others a portent only to the eye. Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Caesar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth hour to the ninth — manifestly that one of which we speak. But what has an eclipse in common with an earthquake, the rending rocks, and the resurrection of the dead, and so great a perturbation throughout the universe? Surely no such event as this is recorded for a long period. But it was a darkness induced by God, because the Lord happened then to suffer. And calculation makes out that the period of 70 weeks, as noted in Daniel, is completed at this time.

So it is Africanus that goes on to point out that an eclipse cannot occur at Passover when the moon is full because it is diametrically opposite the Sun.

<text>Ellen Lewis Arthur (&quot;née&quot; Herndon; August 30, 1837 – January 12, 1880), known as Nell Arthur, was the wife of the 21st president of the United States, Chester A. Arthur. She died of pneumonia in January 1880; her husband was elected vice-president that November. He succeeded to the presidency in September 1881 when President James A. Garfield was assassinated.

==Early life==
Ellen Lewis Herndon, called &quot;Nell,&quot; was born in the town of Culpeper Court House, Virginia on August 30, 1837, the daughter of William Lewis Herndon and Frances Elizabeth Hansbrough.(October 10, 1817 – April 5, 1878). Her father was a naval officer who gained national renown in 1857 when he went down with his ship, the mail steamer SS &quot;Central America&quot;, along with more than 400 passengers and crew. It was the largest ever loss of life in a commercial shipping disaster at the time. Herndon had safely evacuated 152 women and children to another vessel during the severe hurricane off Cape Hatteras, but his ship could not be saved. Nell was 20 when her father died. One of her father&#x27;s cousins was Matthew Fontaine Maury, another notable naval officer and explorer.

Herndon was raised and educated in Washington, D.C. until 1856, when her father relocated the family to New York City. At age 16, she accompanied Matthew Maury, his two daughters and a cousin on an extended tour of Europe. A talented contralto, when she lived in Washington, Herndon&#x27;s singing ability resulted in an invitation to join the choir at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, which she accepted.

==Marriage and family==
Nell and the future U.S. President Chester A. Arthur were introduced in 1856 by her cousin Dabney Herndon Maury, a friend of Arthur, in New York City. Arthur proposed to her on the porch of the U.S. Hotel in Saratoga Springs, New York after a brief courtship.

Arthur, aged 30, married Herndon, aged 22, on October 25, 1859, at Calvary Episcopal Church in New York City. The day was her father&#x27;s birthday. Arthur, who was from rural Vermont, is said to have learned refined dressing while at Union College in upstate New York, where he was in the debating society, and the ways of high society from her socially prominent family. The couple were known for their parties in their Lexington Avenue townhouse in Manhattan.

After relocating to New York City, Nell Arthur continued to sing as a member of the Mendelssohn Glee Club and performed at benefits around New York. The Arthurs appeared to have a strong marriage, but it was strained by both Chester&#x27;s political activities, which took much of his time, and their divided loyalties on the Civil War. While Arthur was serving in the New York militia during the conflict, his wife privately sympathized with the Confederacy, for which many of her Virginia kinfolk were fighting.

The Arthurs had two sons, one of whom died young, and a daughter:
*William Lewis Arthur (1860–1863), died of convulsions at age two and a half, devastating his parents
*Chester Alan Arthur II (1864–1937) – He graduated from Princeton University in 1885 and went on to Columbia Law School. He became a gentleman of leisure. President Arthur on his deathbed warned his son not to go into politics. Alan Arthur traveled extensively, maintained a fine stable of horses, and relied on polo for exercise. A celebrated playboy, at age 36 he married Myra Townsend Fithian, a California heiress. The couple separated after 16 years of marriage and divorced in 1927. Eventually, he settled in Colorado Springs. In 1934 he married Rowena Graves, a real estate and insurance businesswoman. From his first marriage, he was the father of two children: a daughter, Myra, who did not survive, and Chester Alan &quot;Gavin&quot; Arthur III (1901-1972), who married but had no children.
*Ellen Hansbrough Herndon Arthur (1871–1915) – Still a child while her father was president, she was shielded from the press. She married Charles Pinkerton and lived in New York City.

==Social prominence==

Nell&#x27;s social network among the élite families of New York widened Chester&#x27;s political contacts. The pair became a prominent pairing noted for their ambition to gain the recognition and prestige that would accompany Chester&#x27;s rise in politics. Among Nell’s friends were Vanderbilts, Astors, and Roosevelts. Her mother&#x27;s wealth allowed them luxuries such as the three-story Lexington Avenue brownstone townhouse with expensive furnishings from Tiffany’s, which Arthur could not have afforded by himself. Freed from the need to earn enough income to support the lifestyle the couple enjoyed, Arthur was able to devote himself to the New York Republican party, eventually rising through political patronage to Quartermaster General of the New York Militia, with the rank of brigadier general during the Civil War, and Collector of the Port of New York after the war. Her singing as a soloist at the Mendelssohn Glee Club earned her renown of her own.

==Premature death==
On January 10, 1880, Nell Arthur came down with a cold. She quickly developed pneumonia and died two days later on January 12, 1880, at age 42 in New York City, New York. She was buried in the Arthur family plot in Albany, New York.

The president&#x27;s sister Mary Arthur McElroy served as hostess and unofficial First Lady for Arthur&#x27;s social activities as president. She also cared for the Arthur children, who were then 16 and 9 years of age.

Arthur deeply mourned the death of his wife. After taking office as president, Arthur, who could see St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church from his office, commissioned a stained glass window dedicated to his wife at the church. He had it installed where he could view it at night, as the lights were kept on within the church. Additionally, he ordered fresh flowers placed daily before her portrait in the White House.

<text>The blue danio, Kerr&#x27;s danio or turquoise danio (Danio kerri), is a tropical fish belonging to the genus &quot;Danio&quot; in family Danionidae.

==Distribution and habitat==
The blue danio is found on the islands of Langkawi and Ko Yao Yai in Malaysia.

==Description==
It is a blue-colored, deep-bodied danio with several pinkish/gold lines from tail to gills which may or may not be continuous, over a powder blue side.

==In the aquarium==
The blue danio is a peaceful, active schooling fish, so is usually kept in groups. They prefer a well-planted environment, but still need plenty of space to school. Blue danios are often kept in water with a 6.5 – 7.0 pH, a water hardness of 8 – 12 dGH, and a temperature range of .

==Mating==
Blue danios are egg-scatterers that spawn over coarse gravel beds. They will typically spawn at the first light of day. The eggs will hatch in about 36 hours.

==Etymology==
The taxonomic name honors A.F.G. Kerr, who collected the first specimen on Ko Yao Yai in 1929.

<text>Source-available software is software released through a source code distribution model that includes arrangements where the source can be viewed, and in some cases modified, but without necessarily meeting the criteria to be called &quot;open-source&quot;. The licenses associated with the offerings range from allowing code to be viewed for reference to allowing code to be modified and redistributed for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

== Distinction from free and open-source software ==
Any software is &quot;source-available&quot; in the broad sense as long as its source code is distributed along with it, even if the user has no legal rights to use, share, modify or even compile it. It is possible for a software to be both source-available software and proprietary software (e.g. id Software&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot;).

In contrast, the definitions of free software and open-source software are much narrower. Free software and/or open-source software is also always &quot;source-available software&quot;, but not all source-available software is also free software and/or open-source software. This is because the official definitions of those terms require considerable additional rights as to what the user can do with the available source (including, typically, the right to use said software, with attribution, in derived commercial products).

In the broad sense, any FOSS license is a &quot;source-available&quot; license. In the narrow sense, the term &quot;source-available&quot; specifically excludes FOSS software.

== Non-free licenses ==
The following source-available software licenses are considered non-free licenses because they have limitations that prevent them from being open-source according to the Open Source Initiative and free to the Free Software Foundation.

=== Commons Clause ===

The Commons Clause, created by Fossa, Inc., is an addendum to an open-source software license that restricts users from selling the software. Under the combined license, the software is source-available, but not open-source.

On August 22, 2018, Redis Labs shifted some Redis Modules from the GNU Affero General Public License to a combination of the Apache License 2.0 and the Commons Clause.

In September 2018, Matthew Garrett criticized Commons Clause calling it an &quot;older way of doing things&quot; and said it &quot;doesn&#x27;t help the commons&quot;.

=== Business Source License ===

Business Source License has been introduced by MariaDB Corporation in 2016 and rapidly became one of the most adopted &quot;delayed open source&quot; licenses. It prohibits use of the code in production environments, where a commercial license is required.

=== Functional Source License ===
Functional Source License has been introduced in November 2023 by Sentry, as a simpler alternative to Business Source License. It prohibits any &quot;competing&quot; use of the code, to preserve the rights of the author to economically exploit it, but applies for a limited time, after which the code itself is considered to be available under Apache License or MIT License.

=== GitLab Enterprise Edition License (EE License) ===

The GitLab Enterprise Edition License is used exclusively by GitLab&#x27;s commercial offering. GitLab Inc. openly discloses that the EE License makes their Enterprise Edition product &quot;proprietary, closed source code.&quot; GitLab also releases an open-source Community Edition under the MIT License. This makes GitLab an example of an open core company.

=== Mega Limited Code Review Licence ===

In 2016, Mega Ltd. released the source code of their Mega clients under the Mega Limited Code Review Licence, which only permits usage of the code &quot;for the purposes of review and commentary&quot;. The source code was released before former director Kim Dotcom stated that he would &quot;create a Mega competitor that is completely open source and non-profit&quot; following his departure from Mega Ltd.

=== Microsoft Shared Source Initiative ===

Microsoft&#x27;s Shared Source Initiative, launched in May 2001, comprises 5 licenses, 2 of which are open-source and 3 of which are restricted. The restricted licenses under this scheme are the Microsoft Limited Public License (Ms-LPL), the Microsoft Limited Reciprocal License (Ms-LRL), and the Microsoft Reference Source License (Ms-RSL).

=== Old Scilab License ===

Prior to version 5, Scilab described itself as &quot;the open source platform for numerical computation&quot; but had a license that forbade commercial redistribution of modified versions. Versions 5 and later are distributed under the GPL-compatible CeCILL license.

=== Server Side Public License ===

The Server Side Public License is a modification of the GNU Affero General Public License created by the MongoDB project. It modifies a clause relating to usage of the licensed work over a network, stating that if SSPL-licensed software is incorporated into a &quot;service&quot; offered to other users, the source code for the entirety of the service (including without limitation all software and APIs that would be required for a user to run an instance of the service themselves) must be released under the SSPL. The license is considered non-free by the Open Source Initiative, Debian and Red Hat, as it contains conditions that are unduly discriminatory towards commercial use of the software.

=== SugarCRM Public License ===

In 2007 Michael Tiemann, president of OSI, had criticized companies such as SugarCRM for promoting their software as &quot;open source&quot; when in fact it did not have an OSI-approved license. In SugarCRM&#x27;s case, it was because the software is so-called &quot;badgeware&quot; since it specified a &quot;badge&quot; that must be displayed in the user interface. SugarCRM&#x27;s open source version was re-licensed under the GPL version 3 in 2007, and later the GNU Affero GPL version 3 in 2010.

=== TrueCrypt License ===

The TrueCrypt License was used by the TrueCrypt disk encryption utility. When TrueCrypt was discontinued, the VeraCrypt fork switched to the Apache License, but retained the TrueCrypt License for code inherited from TrueCrypt.

The Open Source Initiative rejects the TrueCrypt License, as &quot;it has elements incompatible with the OSD.&quot; The Free Software Foundation criticizes the license for restricting who can execute the program, and for enforcing a trademark condition.

=== BeeGFS End User License Agreement ===
BeeGFS EULA is the license of the distributed parallel file system BeeGFS, except the client for Linux, which is licensed under GPLv2.

BeeGFS source code is publicly available from their website, and because of this they claiming BeeGFS as &quot;Open-Source&quot; software; it is in fact not because this license prohibits distributing modified versions of the software, or using certain features of the software without authorization.

<text>Dnepr ( Russian: Днепр) is a motorcycle brand produced in Kyiv, Ukraine. It has been in use since 1967.

Motorcycles have been produced in Kiev since 1946 at the Kiev Motorcycle Plant (&quot;Kievskiy Mototsykletnyi Zavod&quot; (KMZ), Київський Мотоциклетний Завод, (КМЗ)). Initial production was of a 98 cc two-stroke model that was confiscated from the German firm Wanderer as reparations. The original design for KMZ heavy motorcycles, and their cousin the IMZ, is taken from the pre-World War II German BMW motorcycle R71, which the Soviet Union licensed in 1940. The plant and equipment needed to make the M-72 (the Soviet derivative of the BMW R71) was transferred from the Gorky Motorcycle Plant (&quot;Gorkovskyi Mototsykletnyi Zavod&quot;, GMZ located in the city of Gorkiy (Nizhny Novgorod) in 1949. The first batch of M-72 motorcycles was produced in 1952 with the supply of 500 engines from IMZ. In 1958 KMZ replaced the plunger framed M72-N with the swingarm framed K-750. In 1964, KMZ introduced a military model, the MV-750 with a differential two-wheel drive to the sidecar wheel. 

In 1967, to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, KMZ released their first OHV engine in the &quot;Dnepr&quot; K-650. Unlike the earlier sidevalve engines with their roller bearing crankshafts, this engine featured a sleeve bearing crankshaft as found in the World War II Zündapp KS750. The K-650 was superseded by model MT-9 650 cc, which was available in both solo and sidecar models (often referred to as the best &quot;Cossack&quot;) as it was reliable and featured a new transmission with reverse gear and an automatic declutching mechanism incorporated into the riders foot pedal. The MT-10 was the first Soviet motorcycle to feature 12 volt electrics.

The Dnepr is famous for its off-road capability. Armed services models equipped with sidecars had two-wheel drive and as much as of ground clearance. The present engine is a 650 cc OHV boxer twin. Current models are fitted with engines ranging from the factory standard 650 to 750 and 1,000 cc.

Between 1973 and 1979 Dnepr was one of the makes marketed by Satra in the United Kingdom as Cossack motorcycles.

Since the demise of the Soviet Union, the factory fell on hard times. Production decreased to only remnants of former glory. All shops were closed, and machine tools were taken out of the city limits.

<text>Portoferraio () is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Livorno, on the edge of the eponymous harbour of the island of Elba. It is the island&#x27;s largest city. Because of its terrain, many of its buildings are situated on the slopes of a tiny hill bordered on three sides by the sea.

==History==
It was founded by Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1548, with the name of &quot;Cosmopoli&quot; (&quot;Cosimo&#x27;s City&quot;), to balance the presence of the Spanish citadel in Porto Azzurro. It had three forts (Forte Stella, Forte Falcone, and Forte Inglese) and a massive line of walls, all still visible today.

The name evolved from Ferraia with etruscan, Fabricia with Romans and Ferraio with Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

The city remained attached to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany until the late 18th century, when, due to its strategic position, it came into contention with France, Great Britain, and Austria. A British garrison withstood the Siege of Porto Ferrajo in 1801, but the 1802 Treaty of Amiens transferred the town to France. In 1814 it was handed over to Napoleon Bonaparte, as the seat of his first exile. In the 19th century, the city grew quickly, due to the construction of infrastructures and the exploitation of new iron mills in Rio Marina. Portoferraio then became the main shipping port of the ore to the mainland, whence the current name, meaning &quot;Iron Port&quot; in Italian. After the end of the Napoleonic Era, Portoferraio returned to Tuscany and became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1860. Here brigand Carmine Crocco was imprisoned until his death for his revolution against the reign of Victor Emmanuel II and the anarchist Giovanni Passannante who attempted to kill King Umberto I.

During World War II, Portoferraio became the scene of battle when Elba was occupied by German forces. In late June 1944, an Allied force composed mainly of Free French troops liberated the island in a fight that lasted two days. Portoferraio was taken by French troops on 18 June but was damaged by the fighting and the bombing raids which preceded the invasion.

Portoferraio&#x27;s economy suffered from the end of mining activities starting from the 1970s, but in the following decades, it gained status as an internationally renowned seaside destination.

==Population==
=== The Jewish community ===
The first Jews arrived in Portoferraio at the beginning of the 17th century following the publication of the edict of 1556 in which Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici granted special privileges to all those who settled in Cosmopoli. In 1593, Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici issued letters patent, called La Livornina, by which more privileges were granted to foreign merchants, Jews in particular, who were willing to settle in the new free ports on Elba and in Leghorn.

The first synagogue was built in 1631–1632 when there were barely over ten Jewish families living on the island. At the beginning of the 18th century, the Jewish community numbered more than 50 people.
 


In 1702, by order of the Grand Duke, the Jews of Portoferraio were required to live on a designated street, &quot;Via degli Ebrei&quot; or &quot;Street of the Hebrews&quot; (now called via Elbano Gasperi) which constituted a small ghetto which they were not allowed to leave after 1 o’clock in the morning. At about this time, Abraham Pardo, son of Isaac, was forbidden to build a new synagogue near the church. He was forced to build it in a garden behind his home, below Fort Stella. All Jewish rituals were celebrated in the synagogue and were attended by Jews from Piombino, Maremme and the rest of the island of Elba. The ecclesiastical authorities sought to isolate the Jewish community by preventing Christians from having any contact with the Jewish community. There were restrictions on all workers and in particular on wet nurses who had to apply for special dispensations from the Vicar Forane.
In 1765, authorization was granted to build a wall around a field designated for use as a Jewish cemetery. The field was situated over the Ponticello ditch, behind Ghiaie beach on the site of the present-day Hotel Villa Ombrosa. The wall with its central door is still visible. Until 1954, there was an inscription on the door which read: Cimitero Israelitico. In 1964, the remaining tombs, about 40 of them, with their inscriptions in Hebrew and Spanish and dating from 1646 to the end of the 19th century, were transferred to the new Jewish cemetery in Livorno. The ground was deconsecrated and sold by the Jewish community to a neighbor. It is now the garden of the villa behind it. 

In 1826, the Governor, at the request of the heads of 10 Jewish families, drew up a set of rules for the Jewish community. The rules were approved by the Grand Duke, Leopold II who nominated two &quot;massari&quot; (&quot;bailiffs&quot;) to represent the community. 
In the second half of the 18th century, the Jewish community declined in number due to the worsening of economic conditions on the island. Peace had been signed with the Ottoman Empire resulting in a reduction of military garrisons and the suppression of the “compagnia urbana” made up of 180 men. 
At the beginning of the 20th century, the construction of a steel mill attracted new Jewish families to the island. However, due to the anti-Jewish laws and persecutions, these families left the island. Alfonso Preziosi, in his book, cited above, wrote “generally, the Jews found the island of Elba to be an oasis of peace thanks to the privileges granted by the Medici and the Lorraine which allowed them to develop their trade with Eastern ports.” 

On January 27, 2023, the mayor of Portoferraio attended on the occasion of Remembrance Day the installation of two historical-informative panels on the surrounding wall of the cemetery and in via Elbano Gasperi where the Ghetto was located in memory of the presence of the Jews.

==Main sights==
The town center is crowded around the small marina lying in a natural cove.

Main points of interest include:

*Forte Stella
*Forte Falcone
*Forte Inglese
*Archeological museum 
*Napoleon&#x27;s house

==Portoferraio lighthouse==
The lighthouse stands on the northern rampart of Forte Stella built in 1548 by Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici. It was built by Leopold II Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1788; the stone tower is 25 metres high and has a double balcony and lantern. The lighthouse is fully automated, operated by Marina Militare and identified by the code number 2072 E.F.; the lantern is 63 metres above sea level and emits a group of three white lightning strikes in a 14-second period visible up to 16 nautical miles (roughly 30 km). On the same tower is an additional light identified by the number 2072.2.E.F. that emits a red fixed light at 60 metres above sea level.

<text>Thomas Bateman (8 November 1821 (baptised) – 28 August 1861) was an English antiquary and barrow-digger.

==Biography==
Thomas Bateman was born in Rowsley, Derbyshire, England, the son of the amateur archaeologist William Bateman. After the death of his father in 1835, Bateman was raised by his grandfather, and from the age of 16 he helped run the family estate at Middleton Hall in Middleton-by-Youlgreave, during which time he became interested in archaeology: Sir Richard Colt Hoare&#x27;s &quot;Ancient History of North and South Wiltshire&quot; influenced him greatly. He built Lomberdale Hall in 1844 as his private residence. Bateman had a long affair with Mary Ann Mason, but she was already married. He married Sarah Parker on 2 August 1847 and they had four daughters and a son.

Bateman&#x27;s first archaeological experience was observing the demolition of a medieval church in Bakewell. He joined the British Archaeological Association in 1843 and in 1844, whilst at an archaeological congress in Canterbury, participated in the excavation of barrows in the surrounding countryside. The following year he excavated 38 barrows in Derbyshire and Staffordshire, earning himself the nickname &quot;The Barrow Knight&quot;.

In 1847, he published &quot;Vestiges of the Antiquities of Derbyshire&quot; which united his work with that of earlier excavators in the area. With the help of Samuel Carrington of Wetton he continued to excavate barrows, 50 in the period 1848–1849 and a further 22 between 1851 and 1861, when he died. His second book was &quot;Ten Years&#x27; Diggings in Celtic and Saxon Grave Hills in the Counties of Derby, Stafford and York&quot;, published in the year of his death and it had the details of his work including Heath Wood barrow cemetery.

He was buried, following his instructions, in unconsecrated ground on a hillside in Middleton-by-Youlgreave His tomb is a Grade II listed building.

After his death, his son sold most of Bateman&#x27;s collections, parts of which were acquired by the Sheffield City Museum (now called the Weston Park Museum) in 1893, including the celebrated Benty Grange helmet found in Benty Grange, Derbyshire. A daughter, Clara Theodora Bateman, married Harcourt Clare.

In 2006, a bequest allowed Derbyshire Libraries to purchase a collection that had been amassed by Bateman by inserting documents into the four Derbyshire volumes of Lysons&#x27; &quot;Magna Britannia&quot;. Among the prints was an image of his museum at his home which is dated from around his death. A long description of his museum is found in Eliza Meteyard&#x27;s novel &quot;Dora and her Papa&quot;.

<doc id="650169" wikidata="Q939320" url="?curid=650169" title="Silesian Voivodeship (1920–1939)">
<text>The Silesian Voivodeship (; German: &quot;Woiwodschaft Schlesien&quot;) was an autonomous province (voivodeship) of the Second Polish Republic. The bulk of its territory had formerly belonged to the German/Prussian Province of Silesia and became part of the newly reborn Poland as a result of the 1921 Upper Silesia plebiscite, the Geneva Conventions, three Upper Silesian Uprisings, and the eventual partition of Upper Silesia between Poland, Germany and Czechoslovakia. The remainder had been the easternmost portion of Austrian Silesia (see Cieszyn Silesia) which was partitioned between Poland and Czechoslovakia following the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the Polish–Czechoslovak War and the Spa Conference of 1920. The capital of the voivodeship was Katowice.

The voivodeship was dissolved on 8 October 1939 following the German invasion of Poland, and its territory was incorporated into the German Province of Silesia. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, its territory was incorporated into a new, larger Silesian Voivodeship which existed until 1950.

== General description ==
The Silesian Voivodeship was one of the richest and best developed provinces of inter-war Poland. It owed its wealth to rich deposits of coal, which resulted in the construction of numerous coal mines and steelworks. For this reason, this Voivodeship was crucial to Polish armaments production. However, its location on the border with Germany made it vulnerable. In the mid-1930s, the Polish government decided to move some sectors of heavy industry to the nation&#x27;s heartland, creating the Central Industrial Region. Due to efficient agricultural practices, the Silesian Voivodeship also was a major producer of food, in spite of its small size.

According to the 1931 Polish census, 92.3% of the population stated Polish as their mother tongue. Germans made up 7% and Jews only 1.5%. Poles lived mainly in the villages (95.6% of the population there), while Germans and Jews preferred cities (12.9% of Polish Upper Silesian cities&#x27; population was German, especially Bielsko and Katowice).

Population density was the highest in the country at 299 persons per 1 km2. On 1 January 1937, forested areas made up 27.9% of the province. Rail density was the highest in the country at 18.5 km per 100 km2. In 1931, the illiteracy rate was the lowest in the country at 1.5% of the population.

== History ==

After the First World War a dispute arose about the future of Upper Silesia. This part of the Silesia region was the least affected by centuries of Germanisation. The population was predominantly Slavic, especially in rural areas, although over the years the percentage of the German population increased and in many cities Germans constituted the majority. Many of Slavic people considered themselves Poles (majority), and some Czechs (minority). The rest did not feel any strong connections to either of those nations; according to Wojciech Korfanty&#x27;s estimations, this last group represented up to a quarter of the total whole population of the region.

The Treaty of Versailles resolved that a plebiscite be conducted so that the local population could decide whether Upper Silesia should be assigned to Poland or to Germany. Before the plebiscite took place, two Silesian Uprisings supporting the Polish option had broken out. A third uprising occurred after the plebiscite.

Based on the results of the plebiscite, which was held on 20 March 1921, Upper Silesia was divided between Poland and Germany. The Polish part was incorporated as the Silesian Voivodeship. After the referendum of 1921, the German-Polish Accord on East Silesia (Geneva Convention) was concluded on 15 May 1922 and dealt with the constitutional and legal future of Upper Silesia, as part of it had become Polish territory.

The voivodeship was one of the most economically-developed parts of Poland. It had been granted autonomous status by an Act of the Polish Sejm dated 15 July 1920. That status was secure until the May Coup in 1926, which started various attempts to limit it in favour of a strong and centralised state.

After the German invasion of Poland, the voivodeship was dissolved on 8 October 1939, and its territory was incorporated into the German Province of Upper Silesia. The territory returned to Polish possession at the end of the war, and the 1920 act giving autonomous powers to the Silesian Voivodeship was formally repealed by a law of 6 May 1945. An enlarged Silesian Voivodeship (unofficially called Silesia-Dąbrowa Voivodeship, ) continued in existence until 1950, when it was divided into Katowice Voivodeship and Opole Voivodeship. (For details, see Administrative division of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland.)

== Politics ==
The voivodeship possessed wide autonomy in domestic matters excluding foreign and military policy. It had its own Silesian Parliament with 48 MPs (24 since 1935) elected in democratic elections. Legislation, however, had to be consistent with the Polish constitution. The voivodeship also had its own national treasury - the Silesian Treasury (). Only around 10% of taxes were transferred to Polish national treasury. The head of the administration was headed by a voivode appointed by the president of Poland to act as a representative of the central government.

== Administrative divisions ==

===Counties (&quot;powiaty&quot;)===
In mid-1939, in the wake of invasion, the population of the voivodeship was 1,533,500 (together with Trans-Olza, annexed in October 1938. Its total area was . The voivodeship was divided into the following counties; with largest cities based on the 1931 population census).

<doc id="650179" wikidata="Q7231656" url="?curid=650179" title="Porter Square">
<text>Porter Square is a neighborhood in Cambridge and Somerville, Massachusetts, located around the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Somerville Avenue, between Harvard and Davis Squares. The Porter Square station serves both the MBTA Red Line and the Commuter Rail Fitchburg Line. A major part of the Lesley University campus is located within the Porter Square area.

In 2004–06 the principal intersection, including the area adjacent to the shopping center, underwent extensive construction both to improve access for vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and mass transit users, and to improve drainage and storm water conditions. The artist Toshihiro Katayama of Harvard University, in conjunction with the landscape architect Cynthia Smith, designed a new visual look for the new circulation design, including contrasting light and dark concrete paving, stone walls and boulders.

==History==

Previously called Union Square, Porter Square was renamed in 1899 for the now-vanished Porter&#x27;s Hotel, operated by Zachariah B. Porter, who also left his name to the hotel&#x27;s specialty, the cut of steak known as porterhouse. The hotel was demolished in 1909. The square, formerly flanked by cattle yards that used the Porter rail head to transport their beef throughout the US, was an important center for commerce and light industry as early as the late 18th century. A tunnel for moving cattle to and from the railroad without interfering with street traffic, known as the Walden Street Cattle Pass, was built in 1857. The tunnel survives under the nearby Walden Street Bridge, and in 2007–08 was preserved and restored. The &quot;most dramatic loss&quot; of early 19th century landscape in the square was the leveling of the old Rand Estate in 1952 to make way for the Porter Square Shopping Center.

In 1984 the Red Line was extended from Harvard through Porter and Davis Square to its present terminus at Alewife, a project that also left Porter with its most visible landmark, Susumu Shingu&#x27;s 46-foot painted steel and aluminum kinetic sculpture entitled Gift of the Wind. Porter Square railroad history is covered in greater detail in the Porter Square station article.

==Lesley University==
Lesley University continues to expand in the Porter Square neighborhood, with the relocation of its College of Art and Design to the North Prospect Church and a new building built on the church&#x27;s former site at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Roseland Street.

In addition to University Hall at 1815 Massachusetts Avenue and the Lunder Arts Center at 1801 Massachusetts Avenue, Lesley also has administrative offices at 815 Somerville Avenue and parking areas across Massachusetts Avenue from University Hall.

==Shopping==

===Porter Square Shopping Center===
 The Porter Square Shopping Center consists of two buildings and a parking lot. As of July 2017, it is home to the following stores &amp; eateries:
===Porter Square Galleria===
Adjacent to the Porter Square Shopping Center is a small mall called the Porter Square Galleria. In recent years it has lost several large tenants. A Target is being built in the space formerly occupied by Walgreens. As of September 2018, it is home to:

*Sprint
*Parelli Optical

===The Shops at Porter and local &quot;Japantown&quot;===

A prominent feature of the Porter Square skyline is the tower on the Art Deco-style building located at 1815 Massachusetts Avenue. The building, now known as University Hall, was originally a Sears, Roebuck store from 1928 to 1985. In 1991, Lesley University began leasing classroom space there, and in 1994 the university bought the building, which now houses its Graduate School of Education, bookstore, administrative offices, art and dance studios, and classrooms.

Porter Square and The Shops at Porter have a recent history of being a center for Boston&#x27;s Japanese community. In May 2009, Lesley University ousted Kotobukiya, a Japanese grocery store, from The Shops at Porter, after 20 years in business there. Lesley wanted the space to expand its bookstore.

As of July 2017, The Shops at Porter is home to many Japanese eateries and businesses. Izakaya Ittoku and Shaking Crab are full-size restaurants, and the other eateries are located in a food court-like area with limited seating.

<text>A binary clock is a clock that displays the time of day in a binary format. Originally, such clocks showed &quot;each decimal digit&quot; of sexagesimal time as a binary value, but presently binary clocks also exist which display hours, minutes, and seconds as binary numbers. Most binary clocks are digital, although analog varieties exist. True binary clocks also exist, which indicate the time by successively halving the day, instead of using hours, minutes, or seconds. Similar clocks, based on Gray coded binary, also exist. 

== Binary-coded decimal clocks ==

Most common binary clocks use six columns of LEDs to represent zeros and ones. Each column represents a single decimal digit, a format known as binary-coded decimal (BCD). The bottom row in each column represents 1 (or 20), with each row above representing higher powers of two, up to 23 (or 8). 

To read each individual digit in the time, the user adds the values that each illuminated LED represents, then reads these from left to right. The first two columns represent the hour, the next two represent the minute and the last two represent the second. Since zero digits are not illuminated, the positions of each digit must be memorized if the clock is to be usable in the dark.

== Binary-coded sexagesimal clocks ==

Binary clocks that display time in binary-coded sexagesimal also exist. Instead of representing each digit of traditional sexagesimal time with one binary number, each component of traditional sexagesimal time is represented with one binary number, that is, using up to 6 bits instead of only 4.

For 24-hour binary-coded sexagesimal clocks, there are 11 or 17 LED lights to show the time. There are 5 LEDs to show the hours, there are 6 LEDs to show the minutes, and there are 6 LEDs to show the seconds (which aren&#x27;t used in clocks with 11 LED lights).


A format exists also where hours, minutes and seconds are shown on three lines instead of columns as binary numbers.

== Binary time ==
Less commonly, the day could be divided in binary fractions, such as ½ day, ¼ day, etc. The clock would show the time in 16 bits, where the smallest unit would be exactly day, or (about 1.318) seconds. An analog format also exists of this type. However, it is much easier to write and express this in hexadecimal, which would be hexadecimal time.

<doc id="650198" wikidata="Q2308159" url="?curid=650198" title="Consumer debt">
<text>In economics, consumer debt is the amount owed by consumers (as opposed to amounts owed by businesses or governments). It includes debts incurred on purchase of goods that are consumable and/or do not appreciate. In macroeconomic terms, it is debt which is used to fund consumption rather than investment.

The most common forms of consumer debt are credit card debt, payday loans, student loans and other consumer finance, which are often at higher interest rates than long-term secured loans, such as mortgages.

Long-term consumer debt is often considered fiscally suboptimal. While some consumer items such as automobiles may be marketed as having high levels of utility that justify incurring short-term debt, most consumer goods are not. For example, incurring high-interest consumer debt through buying a big-screen television &quot;now&quot;, rather than saving for it, cannot usually be financially justified by the subjective benefits of having the television early.

In many countries, the ease with which individuals can accumulate consumer debt beyond their means to repay has led to a growth in the debt consolidation industry and credit counseling. 
Debt also leads to a lower credit score and may have effects on mental health.

The amount of debt outstanding versus the consumer&#x27;s disposable income is expressed as the consumer leverage ratio. On a monthly basis, this debt ratio is advised to be no more than 20 percent of an individual&#x27;s take-home pay. The interest rate charged depends on a range of factors, including the economic climate, perceived ability of the customer to repay, competitive pressures from other lenders, and the inherent structure and security of the credit product. Rates generally range from 0.25 percent above base rate, to well into double figures. Consumer debt is also associated with predatory lending, although there is much debate as to what exactly constitutes predatory lending.

In recent years, an alternative analysis might view consumer debt as a way to increase domestic production, on the grounds that if credit is easily available, the increased demand for consumer goods should cause an increase in overall domestic production. The permanent income hypothesis suggests that consumers take debt to smooth consumption throughout their lives, borrowing to finance expenditures (particularly housing and schooling) earlier in their lives and paying down debt during higher-earning periods.

Personal debt is on the rise, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. According to the US Federal Reserve&#x27;s 2024 statistics, the US household debt service ratio was at its lowest level since its peak in the Fall of 2007 in 2021, but has since risen.

==Debt-to-GDP ratio, consumer leverage ratio==
A country&#x27;s private debt can be measured as a &#x27;debt-to-GDP ratio&#x27;, which is the total outstanding private debt of its residents divided by that nation&#x27;s annual GDP. A variant is the consumer leverage ratio, which is the ratio of debt to personal income.

<doc id="650199" wikidata="Q272400" url="?curid=650199" title="Lina Bo Bardi">
<text>Lina Bo Bardi, born Achillina Bo (5 December 1914 – 20 March 1992), was an Italian-born Brazilian modernist architect. A prolific architect and designer, she devoted her working life, most of it spent in Brazil, to promoting the social and cultural potential of architecture and design. While she studied under radical Italian architects, she quickly became intrigued with Brazilian vernacular design and how it could influence a modern Brazilian architecture. During her lifetime it was difficult to be accepted among the local Brazilian architects, because she was both a &quot;foreigner&quot; and a woman. 

She is recognizable for the unique style of the many architectural illustrations she created over her lifetime, along with her tendency to leave poignant notes to herself. She is also known for her furniture and jewelry designs. The popularity of her works has increased since 2008, when a 1993 catalog of her works was republished. A number of her product designs are being revived, and exhibitions such as her 1968 exhibition of glass and concrete easels have been recreated.

==Early life in Italy==
Achillina Bo was born on 5 December 1914 in Rome, Italy. Lina was the oldest child of Enrico and Giovanna Bo, who later had another daughter named Graziella. Lina had an appreciation for art from a young age. When she decided on becoming an architect, her father was not in total support of her decision. In 1939, she graduated from the Rome College of Architecture at the age of 25 with her final piece, &quot;The Maternity and Infancy Care Centre&quot;. She then moved to Milan to begin working with architect Carlo Pagani in the Studio Bo e Pagani, No 12, Via Gesù. Bo Bardi collaborated (until 1943) with architect and designer Giò Ponti on the magazine &quot;Lo Stile – nella casa e nell’arredamento&quot;. In 1942, at the age of 28, she opened her own architectural studio on Via Gesù, but the lack of work during wartime soon led Bardi to take up illustration for newspapers and magazines such as &quot;Stile&quot;, &quot;Grazia&quot;, &quot;Belleza&quot;, &quot;Tempo&quot;, &quot;Vetrina&quot; and &quot;Illustrazione Italiana&quot;. Her office was destroyed by an aerial bombing in 1943. From 1944–5 Bardi was the Deputy Director of &quot;Domus&quot; magazine.

The event prompted her deeper involvement in the Italian Communist Party. In 1945, Domus commissioned Bo Bardi to travel around Italy with Carlo Pagani and photographer Federico Patellani to document and evaluate the situation of the destroyed country. Bo Bardi, Pagani and Bruno Zevi established the weekly magazine &quot;A – Attualità, Architettura, Abitazione, Arte&quot; in Milan (&quot;A Cultura della Vita&quot;). She also collaborated on the daily newspaper &quot;Milano Sera&quot;, directed by Elio Vittorini. Bo Bardi took part in the First National Meeting for Reconstruction in Milan, alerting people to the indifference of public opinion on the subject, which for her covered both the physical and moral reconstruction of the country.

In 1946, Bo Bardi moved to Rome and married the art critic and journalist Pietro Maria Bardi.

==Career in Brazil==

In October 1946 Bo Bardi and her husband traveled to South America. Because they had participated in the Italian resistance movement, they had found life in post-war Italy difficult. In Rio, they were received by the IAB (Institute of Brazilian Architects). Bardi quickly re-established her practice in Brazil, a country which had a profound effect on her creative thinking. She and her husband co-founded the influential art magazine &quot;Habitat&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s title referenced Bardi&#x27;s conceptualization of the ideal interior as a &quot;habitat&quot; designed to maximize human potential.

In 1947, Assis Chateaubriand invited Pietro Maria Bardi to establish and run a Museum of Art. São Paulo was chosen as the location despite Bo Bardi&#x27;s preference for Rio de Janeiro. MASP (the São Paulo Museum of Art) was established on 2 October, with temporary offices on the second floor of the headquarters of the Diários Associados on Rua Sete de Abril. Working with Pietro Maria Bardi, Bo Bardi designed the conversion of several floors of the building into a museum; early sketches evoke the facade of the 1939 MoMA building by Philip L. Goodwin and Edward Durell Stone, but alterations were ultimately limited to the interior. She also designed the new headquarters for the Diários Associados on Rua Álvaro de Carvalho, São Paulo, and designed jewelry using Brazilian gemstones. In addition, soon after arriving in Brazil, Bardi began designing their home in Morumbi, a part of the virgin forest in the southern part of São Paulo.

In 1948, the Studio d’Arte Palma was established on the 18th floor of a building by Polish architect Lucjan Korngold (N˚ 66 Praça Bráulio Gomes, São Paulo), bringing Pietro Maria Bardi, Bo Bardi, Giancarlo Palanti (until 1951) and Valeria Piacentini Cirell (responsible for the antiquarian section) together.

In 1950, Bo Bardi and fellow Italian immigrant Giancarlo Palanti re-designed the MASP museum space in the Diários Associados building, shifting away from Beaux-Arts-style interiors with paintings backed by curtained walls, towards exhibition design rooted in interwar avant-garde artistic practices such as the work of El Lissitzky, the Deutscher Werkbund, and Franco Albini.

Bo Bardi became a naturalized Brazilian citizen in 1951, the same year she completed her first built work, her own &quot;Glass House&quot; in the new neighborhood of Morumbi. Italian rationalism shaped this first work, but because she was immersed in Brazilian culture, her creative thinking began to become more expressive.

In 1955 Bo Bardi became a lecturer for the Architecture and Urbanism Faculty at the University of São Paulo. She wrote and submitted the manuscript, &quot;Contribuição Propedêutica ao Ensino da Teoria da Arquitetura&quot; (Propaedeutic Contribution to the Teaching of Architecture Theory) to the school in 1957, hoping to win a permanent position there.

In 1959, Bo Bardi collaborated with theater director Martim Gonçalves to create the exhibition Bahia in Ibirapuera, which exhibited artworks, craft objects, music, and images from the Brazilian state of Bahia in the heart of the V São Paulo Bienal. This exhibition was a crucial transitional design between the museology of the earlier MASP in the Diários Associados building and the crystal easels of the later MASP on Avenida Pompéia.

In 1977 Bo Bardi designed the SESC Pompéia Factory, which was called a &quot;leisure center&quot; instead of a sports and cultural center by Bo Bardi because she felt that the word culture was too weighty, and this place should be somewhere to relax and find enjoyment. The design of SESC Pompéia prioritized labor and craftmanship over expensive materials because Bo Bardi believed architects should do their best to create jobs for craftsmen and laborers.

In 1989, at the age of 74, Bo Bardi was honored with the first exhibition of her work at the University of São Paulo.

Bo Bardi also created jewelry, costume, and set designs.

Bo Bardi died at the Casa de Vidro on 20 March 1992. When she died she left designs for a new São Paulo City Hall and a Cultural Centre for Vera Cruz.

== Early Projects ==
In August 1940 Bo Bardi partnered with Carlo Pagani in an unbuilt project titled &#x27;Casa sul mare di Sicilia&#x27; in a special issue of the magazine Domus. It is one of the first projects that Bo Bardi worked on – a utopian project whose representations indicate a way of proceedings that coagulates theory and imagination conceived as indissoluble relationship of &#x27;doing&#x27;.&quot; In addition the project had &quot;&#x27;unconventional&#x27; drawings of the project, plans, perspectives and perspective section, indicating a very personal way in using of graphic language&quot;. The project was a design for a Mediterranean house integrated into the landscape and built using an abundance of historical and cultural imaginary.

Bo Bardi&#x27;s very particular representational style likely originated through an artistic style inspired from her father Enricao Bo, who was in many trades but was an anarchist with an adventurous life which influenced many of the unique graphical drawings of her &#x27;Casa sul mare di Sicilia&#x27;.

== Major Projects ==

===The Glass House===

In 1951 Bo Bardi designed the &quot;Casa de Vidro&quot; (“Glass House”) to live with her husband in what was then the remnants of the Mata Atlantica, the original rain forest surrounding São Paulo. She appreciated the site&#x27;s rugged landscape, which aligned with many of her written works praising rural architecture. The structure is an early example of reinforced concrete in domestic architecture. Located on a 7,000-square-metre plot of land, it was one of the first three residences in the Morumbi neighborhood, along with Oswaldo Bratke&#x27;s studio house and his project for Oscar and Maria Luisa Americano. The area is now a wealthy suburb; a more domesticated version of the rain forest has re-established itself around the house, concealing it from view.

In addition to being her first built project, this building was also Bo Bardi&#x27;s first attempt at finding a Brazilian language for the Italian modernism that she had been trained in. She also drew from other American modernist works, such as Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s Farnsworth House and Case Study House No. 8 by Charles and Ray Eames, both of which were widely publicized at the time. It also could have been influenced by Bernard Rudofsky&#x27;s courtyard houses featured in the &quot;Brazil Builds&quot; exposition (1940–1942). However, she wanted to contextualize this modernism into the fabric of Brazil. Rather than copying the local forms, she hoped to incorporate the ideas behind them into the design in a way that was modern, and she celebrated the local environment.

The main part of the house is horizontal between thin reinforced concrete slabs with slender circular columns. The columns are pilotis, which allows the landscape to flow under the building. Large panels of glass combined with a sense of the structure hovering over the ground contributed to the &quot;Glass House&quot; name.Inside, the main living area is almost completely open, except for a courtyard that allows the trees in the garden below to grow up into the heart of the house. In the house, there are zones allocated to different functions- a dining room, a library, and a sitting area around the freestanding fireplace- but all are unified by the forest views through the glass. In theory, the glass panels slide open horizontally, but there is no balcony to encourage people to go outside.

The living area is only half of the house. The other half sits on solid ground at the top of the hill, on the north side of the living room. A row of bedrooms face a narrow courtyard, on the other side of which is the blank wall of the staff wing. Only the kitchen crosses the divide – a territory shared by servants and mistress, and equipped with a variety of well-designed labor-saving devices.

The house would become a model for the developer&#x27;s campaign to sell the remaining lots in the Morumbi. The slogan of &quot;Architecture and Nature&quot; echoed the major themes of Bo Bardi&#x27;s work.

===The São Paulo Museum of Art===
Bo Bardi&#x27;s basic design was used for the São Paulo Museum of Art (also known as &quot;MASP&quot;) which was built between 1957 and 1968. Her husband, Pietro Maria Bardi, was curator. The Bardis became involved with the Museum after meeting the Brazilian journalist and diplomat Assis Chateaubriand. Chateaubriand, with P.M. Bardi&#x27;s curatorial insight, acquired a vast collection of art for MASP, including art works by Bosch, Mantegna, Titian and Goya.

In what she coins &quot;Poor Architecture&quot;, one divorced from the pretentiousness often associated with cultured intellectuals, Bo Bardi sought to design a museum that embodied a simple form of monumental architecture. Formed from pre-stressed concrete without embellishment, the building is formed from raw and efficient solutions. The building features a suspended volume, spanning 74 meters, held aloft by 4 brilliant red, concrete columns connected by two concrete beam running along the length of the building, with 2 floors of gallery above and below the ground floor. The open midsection of the building left the plaza open to Avenida Paulista, São Paulo&#x27;s main financial and cultural avenue, and left the site unobstructed to the views of the lower-lying parts of the city, which was one of the conditions given by the local legislation when Bo Bardi received the commission for this project

Paintings were hung on individual sheets of glass set in rough-hewn concrete blocks – called &quot;crystal easels&quot; – and arranged in a rough grid in the MASP Pinacoteca. Bo Bardi intended to create an experience within the art gallery that would be unexpected and almost uncomfortable, by presenting the artwork in a non-chronological order in the open plan of each floor to create dissonance between the preconceived understanding of order and what is presented.
=== Solar do Unhão ===
Solar do Unhão is Salvador&#x27;s main cultural center. It was founded by Lina Bo Bardi after an invitation by the governor of Bahia to direct a new art museum in the North East of Brazil. Bo Bardi wanted this museum to show primitive art from the North East of Brazil, as well as the practical nature of their designs. The design of the museum reflects the culture in Salvador, but also the practicality and beauty of the region. Solar do Unhão used to be a sugar mill and was named after the 17th-century Brazilian high court judge, Pedro Unhão Castelo Branco. Bo Bardi was commissioned to restore the sugar mill into a museum of modern art. The construction lasted from 1959–1963. The staircase contrasts abstract geometry and traditional materiality. Bo Bardi is paying homage to the 17th-century building, but at the same time updating it with modern designs. Her goal was to restore extant buildings in ways that neither pandered to nostalgia nor ignored context. To do this, she left the colonial exterior intact and added the modern staircase. Solar do Unhão reflects Bo Bardi&#x27;s belief that a museum should also be a place for education. When the museum was first built it held many classes that educated the locals in art and history. Bo Bardi believed that a museum should not be a mausoleum of the past and should instead be an active site of knowledge.

=== Centro de Lazer Fábrica da Pompéia ===

The Centro de Lazer Fábrica da Pompéia (now called the SESC Pompéia) was one of Bo Bardi&#x27;s largest and most important projects, in addition to being an early example of adaptive reuse.The site was a former steel drum and refrigerator factory in São Paulo, and was to be redeveloped into a leisure and recreation center for the working class. SESC is a Brazilian non-governmental organization linked to national unions, created in the 1940s to provide workers with health services and cultural activities. Completed in several stages between 1977 and 1986, Bo Bardi combined the existing structure with additions of her own design.

After a site visit in the early stages of the project, Bo Bardi realized that locals and former factory workers were already using the existing structure as a social gathering space and a place for football, dance groups, and theater. Rather than interfere with the use of the site, she set out to maintain and amplify those uses. Bo Bardi stripped away old plaster and then sandblasted to reveal the rough concrete of the former factory. Her design added new concrete towers which were connected to the factory building by aerial walkways. Rough windows were knocked out of the factory walls and covered with bright red sliding screens attached inside. When deciding what kind of program should be implemented, Bo Bardi believed that the project should be a leisure center rather than a culture and sporting center. She believed that &quot;culture&quot; is a strong term and may mandate people to hold cultural events, and the term &quot;sporting&quot; may have a harmful tendency towards a culture that is already competitive by nature The building currently houses many activities rooms, including: theatres, gymnasiums, a swimming pool, snack bars, leisure areas, restaurants, galleries, and workshops.

SESC Pompéia was built after a 20-year military dictatorship in Brazil that created architecture that did not mirror the Brazilian culture. SESC Pompéia is thought to be an example of a new architectural language predominately influenced by Brazilian culture.

=== Teatro Oficina ===
The Teatro Oficina was designed by Bo Bardi in 1984. She was commissioned to turn a burnt office building in São Paulo into a theatre. The building was designed for the theatre group with the same name whom were an important part of the Tropicalia movement of the late 1960s. Tropicalia strived for change and a way for Brazil to escape its colonial past. They used theater to try and understand their Brazilian heritage. Bo Bardi designed the new space almost completely out of painted scaffolding. The design references the construction of sets in a theatre space. The theatre does not have conventional seats, which leads to bad sight lines. Architectural critiques have stated that this does not take away from the theatre experience but enhances it with intensity. The heavy wooden seats are designed in a circle at center stage and the stage is very narrow. Initially, the theatre was designed for experimental director, Zé Celso, who has said that the idea of the space came to him in an acid trip. The theatre is often used by experimental performers who work around the space. The design of the theatre is meant to make the viewer feel as though they are engaged with the act on the stage.

== Furniture design ==
In 1948, Bo Bardi founded the Studio de Arte e Arquitetura Palma with Giancarlo Palanti (1906–77) to design economical furniture of pressed wood or plastic manufactured by Pau Brasil Ltda., the fabrication studio they opened, and through which they furnished the São Paulo Museum of Art&#x27;s first headquarters. In the 1950s, Bardi began designing metal-framed furniture with upholstered seats and backs. Her most famous design is the 1951 upholstered bowl chair on a metal frame. &quot;Pianeta Design&quot; has written of her design that it received positive reviews in 1951, but only two original prototypes remain of the initial design as it was not initially put into production. In 2012, Italian Furniture brand Arper recreated 500 pieces of the limited edition Bowl Chair. Arper engaged in intensive dialogues with the Institute Lina Bo e P.M. Bardi evaluating the original iterations for size, interior structure, upholstery detailing – down to the quality and size of the stitching – and softness of the seat. Every detail, down to the small leather covers placed around the round steel frame of the chair to hold it in place, was carefully reinterpreted. Arper explored different modes of interpretation of color for this touchstone of Brazilian modernist design.

Later designs, such as her 1967 &quot;Cadeira Beira de Estrada&quot; (Roadside Chair), inspired by the vernacular designs she observed during her travels in the northeast of Brazil, embody an unofficial aesthetic with simplicity of design and reduction and rawness of material. She often used plywood and native Brazilian woods in her designs. Bardi wanted each object to display its own &quot;natural logic.&quot;

==Studio Culture==
A day working in one of Bo Bardi&#x27;s multiple studios was anything but typical. After the completion of her Glass House project, Bo Bardi and her four staff members met around the open fireplace in lieu of a dedicated office and collaborated there. In 1977, Bo Bardi moved her studio into a shipping container unit on the grounds of the SESC Pompéia site where it remained for nine years. It was common to see construction tools and hard hats littering her workspace as she was just as interested in the techniques and skills rooted in building as she was the poetics of her designs. Bo Bardi&#x27;s office never had a secretary to handle administrative duties, nor did they make a habit of producing &quot;standard&quot; technical drawings and plans for construction. Instead, Bo Bardi crafted colorful and expressive drawings using a plethora of pens, paints, watercolors and brushes. She used a unique drafting desk with a glass top and a cast-iron base imported from Italy in her office.

== Drawings ==
Bo Bardi produced more than six thousand drawings most of which are stored in her personal archives in the house she designed for herself and her husband in São Paulo. She used drawing as a primary language for communicating her thoughts and ideas to the rest of the world. Most of her drawings are not isolated events as they correlate and exist in a wide range of scales, patterns, relationships, and themes. As she moved to different practices and places her drawing style adapted to about the world surrounding her. Zeuler R. Lima, Lina Bo Bardi&#x27;s biographer, dedicated two books and two exhibitions to the study of her drawings (see external links below).

=== Analytical drawings ===
Bo Bardi&#x27;s drawings continued to have a presences in her education as an architect. She eventually moved away from the colorful representations of her adolescence and switched to a more analytical framework of observing and drafting. She used orange gouache for the pochè, the filled-in section of walls, which suggests her use of bold graphic choices. She took courses that helped her in composition, plein air drawing, perspective, and descriptive geometries all focused on historic buildings. She also studied classical, Renaissance, and manurist writings and treatises by Vitruvius.

=== Narrative drawings ===
After graduating at the outset of war, she used her knowledge of watercolor and gouache, with her architecture education to create drawings that tell stories. She created images illustrating pieces of traditional and modernist modes of representation, between lyricism and rationalism. She often organized these stories into little cartoons, resembling medieval horror vacui composition with little blank spaces between them. She would limit the texture of the drawings while also using a single-point perspective, axonometric and cavalier representations, as well as bird&#x27;s-eye views. She would display multiple spatial frameworks simultaneously, but never losing sight of the aspects of daily life, which she revealed gracefully, in colorful detail.

== Legacy ==
In 1990, the Instituto Lina Bo Bardi e P.M. Bardi was established to promote the study of Brazilian culture and architecture. Bo Bardi died in 1992 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Over the past years, numerous artists and architects including Gilbert &amp; George, Cildo Meireles, Isaac Julien, Cristina Iglesias, Norman Foster, Olafur Eliasson, and Adrián Villar Rojas have created works in homage to Lina Bo Bardi. SANAA architect Kazuyo Sejima put her at the center of her Venice Architecture Biennale in 2009. Her work was the subject of a 2012 exhibition at the British Council in London. In 2013, curator Hans Ulrich Obrist mounted the exhibition “The Insides are on the Outside”, set at the Casa de Vidro and at SESC Pompeia. Gilbert &amp; George spent a day at the Glass House as living sculptures, documenting the results with postcards to be distributed to visitors.

In 2013 the British Council, in collaboration with the Instituto Lina Bo Bardi e P.M. Bardi, created a fellowship called the Lina Bo Bardi Fellowship for UK architects to travel and work in Brazil.

In 2014, a Google Doodle commemorated her 100th birthday.

In 2015, &quot;The Guardian&quot; elected Lina Bo Bardi&#x27;s Teatro Oficina (1991) as the best theatre in the world.

In 2018, Nilufar Gallery, in collaboration with Space Caviar, supported by Instituto Bardi Casa de Vidro, presented the largest collection of Lina’s furniture ever brought together, at Fuorisalone Milan Design Week.

<doc id="650207" wikidata="Q1789027" url="?curid=650207" title="Null morpheme">
<text>In morphology, a null morpheme or zero morpheme is a morpheme that has no phonetic form. In simpler terms, a null morpheme is an &quot;invisible&quot; affix. It is a concept useful for analysis, by contrasting null morphemes with alternatives that do have some phonetic realization. The null morpheme is represented as either the figure zero (&quot;0&quot;) or the empty set symbol ∅. 

In most languages, it is the affixes that are realized as null morphemes, indicating that the derived form does not differ from the stem. For example, plural form &quot;sheep&quot; can be analyzed as combination of &quot;sheep&quot; with added null affix for the plural. The process of adding a null affix is called &quot;null affixation&quot;, &quot;null derivation&quot; or &quot;zero derivation&quot;. The concept was first used by the 4th century BCE Sanskrit grammarian from ancient India, Pāṇini, in his Sanskrit grammar.

==In English==

===Inflection===
The existence of a null morpheme in a word can also be theorized by contrast with other forms of the same word showing alternative morphemes. For example, the singular number of English nouns is shown by a null morpheme that contrasts with the plural morpheme &quot;-s&quot;.
* &quot;cat&quot; = &quot;cat&quot; + &quot;-∅&quot; = ROOT (&quot;cat&quot;) + SINGULAR
* &quot;cats&quot; = &quot;cat&quot; + &quot;-s&quot; = ROOT (&quot;cat&quot;) + PLURAL

In addition, there are some cases in English where a null morpheme indicates plurality in nouns that take on irregular plurals.
* &quot;sheep&quot; = &quot;sheep&quot; + &quot;-∅&quot; = ROOT (&quot;sheep&quot;) + SINGULAR
* &quot;sheep&quot; = &quot;sheep&quot; + &quot;-∅&quot; = ROOT (&quot;sheep&quot;) + PLURAL

Also, a null morpheme marks the present tense of English verbs in all forms but the third person singular:
* &quot;(I) run&quot; = &quot;run&quot; + &quot;-∅&quot; = ROOT (&quot;run&quot;) + PRESENT: Non-3rd-SINGULAR
* &quot;(He) runs&quot; = &quot;run&quot; + &quot;-s&quot; = ROOT (&quot;run&quot;) + PRESENT: 3rd-SINGULAR

===Derivation===
According to some linguists&#x27; view, English verbs such as &quot;to clean&quot;, &quot;to slow&quot;, &quot;to warm&quot; are converted from adjectives by a null morpheme – in contrast to verbs such as &quot;to widen&quot; or &quot;to enable&quot; which are also converted from adjectives, but using non-null morphemes. Null derivation, also known as conversion if the word class changes, is very common in analytic languages such as English.

==In other languages==
In languages that show the above distinctions, it is quite common to employ null affixation to mark singular number, present tense and third persons. It is also frequent to find null affixation for the least-marked cases (the nominative case in nominative–accusative languages, and the absolutive case in ergative–absolutive languages). English is unusual in its marking of the third person singular with a non-zero morpheme, by contrast with a null morpheme for others. Another unusual usage of the null morpheme is the feminine genitive case plural in most Slavic languages, cf. Russian singular nominative &quot;женщин-а&quot; (&quot;zhenshchin-a&quot;), &quot;woman&quot;, singular genitive &quot;женщин-ы&quot; (&quot;zhenshchin-y&quot;), &quot;woman&#x27;s&quot; and plural genitive &quot;женщин-∅&quot; (&quot;zhenshchin-∅&quot;), &quot;women&#x27;s&quot;.

In most languages of the world it is the affixes that are realized as null morphemes. But in some cases roots may also be realized as these. For instance, the Russian word вы-&quot;∅&quot;-ну-ть (&quot;vynut&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;to take out&#x27;) consists of one prefix (вы-), one zero root (&quot;-∅-&quot;), and two suffixes (-ну- and -ть).

A basic radical element plus a null morpheme is not the same as an uninflected word, though usage may make those equal in practice.

<doc id="650218" wikidata="Q11987" url="?curid=650218" title="Assis Chateaubriand">
<text>Francisco de Assis Chateaubriand Bandeira de Melo (pronounced ), also nicknamed Chatô (October 4, 1892 – April 4, 1968), was a Brazilian lawyer, journalist, politician and diplomat. He was founder and director of the prominent media conglomerate of Brazil, the &quot;Diários Associados&quot; including: 34 newspapers, 36 radio stations, 18 television stations, one news agency, one weekly magazine (&quot;O Cruzeiro&quot;), one monthly magazine (&quot;A Cigarra&quot;) as well as many magazines for children.

During the 1940s and 1950s, he became notable in Brazil for his work as a journalist, an entrepreneur, an arts patron as well as a politician. Chateaubriand was appointed Ambassador of Brazil to the United Kingdom, position he held from 1957 to 1961. He was also a lawyer and professor of law, writer and member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, occupying its 37th chair from 1954 until his death in 1968.

== Early life ==
Chateaubriand was born in Umbuzeiro, state of Paraíba, in the Northeast of Brazil, on October 4, 1892, the son of Francisco José Bandeira de Melo and his wife, Maria Carmem Guedes Gondim.

Chateaubriand married Maria Henriqueta Barroso do Amaral, who was the daughter of attorney Judge Zózimo Barroso do Amaral, and had one son, Fernando, with her.

==Career==
Chateaubriand was born into poor conditions, living in a wattle and daub house and only learning to read at the age of 10. He started working as a journalist at the age of 15, working for the newspaper &quot;Gazeta do Norte&quot;. He also wrote for &quot;Jornal Pequeno&quot; and &quot;Diário de Pernambuco&quot;. In 1917, having moved to Rio de Janeiro, he worked for &quot;Correio da Manhã&quot;. In this newspaper, he would publish his impressions about his trip to Europe, in 1920.

In the state of Pernambuco, as a young lawyer, he gained fame for a series of verbal clashes with various political and literary figures. At the same time, he managed, to become Professor of Roman Law at the Law Faculty of Recife in his 20&#x27;s, being formally appointed for the post only after various clashes with the state&#x27;s politicos, among them General Dantas Barreto and Dr. Manuel Borba. What finally settled the battle was a telegram from the president of the republic, Venceslau Brás, on December 8, 1915. His victory in attaining the position as professor further became a platform for his even more ambitious goal; to own a newspaper of his own by the age of thirty.

In 1924, Chatô became the director of &quot;O Jornal&quot;. This was his first step toward building his press empire, to which were added important newspapers from Brazil, such as &quot;Diário de Pernambuco&quot; (the oldest newspaper in Latin America) and &quot;Jornal do Commercio&quot; (the oldest newspaper in Rio de Janeiro). In the following year, a newspaper from São Paulo was added to his press conglomerate: &quot;Diário da Noite&quot;. In 1929, Chateaubriand added to Diários Associados another newspaper: &quot;Estado de Minas&quot;, now the most famous, influential and respected of that conglomerate.

Intelligent, learned, hard-headed and stubborn, he soon earned a reputation as a self-made man, who had no scruples about approaching and lobbying for influential people who might be serviceable to his personal interests; already as a teenager, he had already made friends with the powerful local Lundgren family of industrialists.

After moving to Rio, Chateaubriand worked as a journalist and lawyer, and it was in the latter capacity that he made friends with influential people, especially magnates connected with the interests of foreign corporations who wanted to hedge through lobbying against nationalist politics, among them the public utilities São Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company CEO Alexander McKenzie and the American mining magnate Percival Farquhar.

Chateaubriand was a media mogul in Brazil between the late 1930s and the early 1960s and the owner of Diários Associados, a conglomerate that counted at its peak more than a hundred newspapers, radio and TV stations, magazines and a telegraphic agency. He is also known as the co-creator and founder, in 1947, of the São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP), together with Pietro Maria Bardi.

On September 25, 1935, Chateaubriand inaugurated Rádio Tupi (pt) in a ceremony attended by the inventor of radio Guglielmo Marconi, who, ten days earlier, had broadcast the first musical program with a 120-voice orchestra performing the Brazilian National Anthem and was conducted by conductor Villa-Lobos. In its beginning, the station was known as &quot;Cacique do Ar&quot;, also being called by its prefix PRG-3 or, simply, G-3.

Chateubriand also founded the first television network of Latin America and the fifth in the world (Tupi TV). He was Senator of the Republic between 1952 and 1957.

After becoming a press tycoon, he eventually combined undeniable journalistic feeling with a totally unscrupulous behaviour, using as his main tool for money making the most extensive use of libel and blackmail, directed against magnates and authorities.: in the promotion of his pet projects – as in his campaign for the building of airports and training of pilots across Brazil – he would resort to any means whatsoever, having even ordered his thugs to shoot a German businessman who refused to be blackmailed by him&lt;ref name=&quot;Kucinski, Chatô, 166/167&quot;&gt;Kucinski, &quot;Chatô&quot;, 166/167&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, he would refurbish his São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP) with a whole collection of old European masters&#x27; works purchased at bargain prices in impoverished post-WW II Europe, by using funds extorted through blackmail from various Brazilian businessmen. Chateaubriand never made a great secret about his peculiar business strategies: &quot;excellency in business means buying &quot;without&quot; money&quot; he once allegedly said.

He died on April 4, 1968, in São Paulo, from a persistent disease, in which he resisted for years, continuing to write his articles, even though he was paraplegic and was unable to speak.

== Historical influence ==
An often polemic and controversial figure, hated and feared, Chateaubriand has also been nicknamed &quot;the Brazilian Citizen Kane&quot; and accused of unethical behavior, for allegedly blackmailing companies that did not place ads in his media vehicles, and for insulting entrepreneurs with lies (such as industry owner Count Francesco Matarazzo). His empire would have been built based on political interests and agreements, including tumultuous but profitable ties with Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas.

Regarded by some as having formed the basis for a modern Brazilian press and mass culture, Francisco de Assis Chateaubriand Bandeira de Melo&#x27;s power over the Brazilian media – as well as his lack of scruples, his upstart drive and gangster-like ethos – during his height from the 1920s and well into the &#x27;60s can be compared to that of William Randolph Hearst in the USA. Chateaubriand was one of the most influential individuals in Brazilian history. He was known for having strong ties to the current leaders within both politics and economy. With a career as solicitor, journalist, media mogul, ambassador and senator, he often was the decisive drop on the scale of political campaigns and decisions. He was part of the creation of presidents and the undisputed ruler of Brazilian press. At the same time, he always lacked a clear ideological agenda – except for being a staunch partisan of the untrammeled Free Market and of consented submission to imperialist interests. At the end of his life – especially after a stroke in 1960, that left him speechless, using a wheelchair and communicating with others mostly by means of notes typed in a specially adapted typewriter – he had become a clownish shadow of himself, &quot;a blackmailer who acted as an interloper in the power game of the ruling class&quot;. His media empire, after decades of personal financial mismanagement, quickly declined after his death. In the new ambience of a modernized Brazil, he was quickly dislocated by the new professionally managed, streamlined and more ideologically coherent Rede Globo.

<doc id="650219" wikidata="Q1533972" url="?curid=650219" title="Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II">
<text>, is a 1993 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Takao Okawara, with special effects by Kōichi Kawakita. Distributed by Toho and produced under their subsidiary Toho Pictures, it is the 20th film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, as well as the fifth film to be released during the franchise&#x27;s Heisei era. The film features the fictional monster character Godzilla, along with Baby Godzilla, Rodan and the mecha character Mechagodzilla. Despite its English title, the film is not a sequel to the 1974 film &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot;.

&quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on December 11, 1993, to generally positive reviews from critics. The film was a commercial success, generating a combined from the box office, book sales and merchandise sales by 1994. It was the first Japanese film to use Dolby Digital sound format. It was released directly to pay-per-view satellite television in the United States in 1998 by Sony Pictures Television. The film was promoted as the last film in the franchise&#x27;s Heisei series, and was also promoted by a children&#x27;s television program called &quot;Adventure! Godzilland 2&quot;. Although &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot; was not the final entry in the Heisei series, as it was followed by &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot; in 1994, Toho producers initially wished to avoid competing with TriStar&#x27;s then-upcoming &quot;Godzilla&quot; reboot.

==Plot==
In the aftermath of Mecha-King Ghidorah&#x27;s defeat by the hand of Godzilla in 1992, the United Nations establishes the &quot;United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center&quot; (UNGCC) to stop Godzilla. Their military branch, G-Force, salvages Ghidorah&#x27;s remains and reverse engineers them to build two anti-Godzilla weapons: an aerial gunship called &quot;Garuda&quot; and a mecha modeled after Godzilla called Mechagodzilla.

Two years later and one year after Godzilla battled Mothra and Battra in Yokohama, while on a mission to Adonoa Island, a Japanese team comes across what they assume is a large &quot;Pteranodon&quot; egg, which gives off a telepathic signal that attracts Godzilla and Rodan, an adult &quot;Pteranodon&quot; irradiated by nuclear waste. Godzilla critically wounds Rodan during the ensuing battle while the research team escapes with the egg. It is taken to a research center in Kyoto, where it imprints on a young female scientist. When a juvenile Godzillasaurus called Baby Godzilla hatches from the egg, the research team concludes that the egg was left in the &quot;Pteranodon&quot; nest with Rodan in a manner similar to the brood parasitism displayed by European cuckoos. Godzilla appears, once again responding to Baby&#x27;s psychic call. The JSDF mobilizes Mechagodzilla, which intercepts Godzilla as he is heading to Kyoto. The two battle, with Mechagodzilla initially having the upper hand until Godzilla disables a mecha with his energy pulse. Godzilla continues searching for Baby, but the scientists, having discovered the telepathic link between the monsters, shield it from Godzilla. Frustrated, he destroys most of Kyoto before returning to the ocean.

Tests on the baby reveal that it has a second brain in its hips that controls the animal&#x27;s movement. The UNGCC assumes that this also holds true for Godzilla and decide to use Baby to bait Godzilla into another fight with Mechagodzilla. The &quot;G-Crusher&quot; is installed into Mechagodzilla, which will allow the robot to penetrate Godzilla&#x27;s hide and destroy his second brain. Young psychic Miki Saegusa is ordered to become a part of Mechagodzilla&#x27;s crew to locate Godzilla&#x27;s second brain. While she is reluctant due to her mental connection with Godzilla, she agrees. The plan backfires when Rodan, having survived his battle with Godzilla and further mutated by radiation and became Fire Rodan, responds to Baby&#x27;s call and intercepts the UNGCC transport.

In response, they send Mechagodzilla and &quot;Garuda&quot; after Rodan instead, which injure him in the process. Godzilla arrives soon after and attacks Mechagodzilla. The fight is evenly matched until Mechagodzilla merges with &quot;Garuda&quot; to become Super-Mechagodzilla. Mechagodzilla paralyzes Godzilla, but Rodan, responds to Baby&#x27;s call, sacrifices himself and transfers his power to regenerates Godzilla&#x27;s second brain, which empowering Godzilla, allowing him to destroy Mechagodzilla.

Godzilla locates Baby, who is initially afraid of Godzilla&#x27;s gigantic size. Miki telepathically communicates Baby, convincing it to go with Godzilla and the two monsters return to the ocean together.

==Cast==
==Production==
The fifth film in the Heisei series of &quot;Godzilla&quot; movies was originally meant to be the last, in order to avoid competing with the upcoming TriStar American &quot;Godzilla&quot; reboot film (which was later delayed) and to honor the recent passing of Ishirō Honda. Toho had initially wanted to produce a remake of &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;, but were unable to acquire the rights to use the King Kong character from Universal Pictures. When that project was scrapped, Toho considered pitting Godzilla against Mechani-Kong, a mecha first introduced in &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;. The plot would have involved Mechani-Kong sporting syringes containing G-Force special forces which would have been injected into Godzilla&#x27;s bloodstream in a manner similar to &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, though the project was abandoned, as obtaining the rights to a monster even bearing the semblance of King Kong proved too costly.

Producers Tomoyuki Tanaka and Shōgo Tomiyama felt that reviving Mechagodzilla was a logical next step for the series after the successful reintroduction of King Ghidorah and Mothra to contemporary audiences. Furthermore, effects artist Koichi Kawakita had already demonstrated his competence in designing and creating mecha contraptions like the Super XII, Mecha-King Ghidorah, and the machines featured in &quot;Gunhed&quot;. The decision to reintroduce Minilla (rechristened as Baby Godzilla) was made in order to appeal to the largely female audience that made &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot; a financial success, despite objections by director Takao Okawara, who held a low opinion of the 1960s movies the character had previously been featured in. In the original ending for the film, Godzilla destroys Garuda but is killed by Mechagodzilla. Garuda&#x27;s nuclear reactor explodes and resurrects the King of the Monsters. Another ending was considered in which Godzilla&#x27;s escaping life energy mutates Baby Godzilla into a new adult Godzilla, a concept that was later used in &quot;Godzilla vs. Destoroyah&quot;.

Toho promoted the film as Akira Ifukube&#x27;s last performance as composer, and aired the children&#x27;s program &quot;Adventure Godzilla-land&quot;, which portrayed Godzilla and Mechagodzilla as rival news anchors reporting on the events of the upcoming movie, as well as featuring the dance routine &quot;Be like Godzilla&quot;. Shortly after the movie was released, Toho further promoted the film&#x27;s merchandise by opening a Godzilla-themed simulation ride in Sanrio Puroland called &quot;Monster Planet of Godzilla&quot;, which featured Megumi Odaka as the captain of a spacecraft which lands on a planet inhabited by Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra, who are then accidentally transported to contemporary Tokyo.

Kawakita made more extensive use of CGI than in previous &quot;Godzilla&quot; movies he worked on, and made an effort for the featured monsters to be less reliant on energy beams during battle sequences, particularly Rodan, who was portrayed via handpuppets and marionettes rather than through suitmation. Baby Godzilla was performed by series veteran Hurricane Ryu, and was designed to look much more dinosaur-like than his previous incarnation. Mechagodzilla was redesigned to be much less angular in form, and was performed by Wataru Fukuda. The Mechagodzilla suit itself consisted of multiple separate elements which Fukuda wore like plate armor. Kawakita originally envisioned Mechagodzilla being able to split into aerial and terrestrial units, though this idea was scrapped in favor of the character merging with the flying battleship Garuda. The new Godzilla suit was notably bulkier in profile than its predecessor, and had smaller shoulders and slimmer legs. The tail was also placed higher up the back, thus resulting in a very top-heavy appearance. Like the previous suit, the one used in &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot; had an electronically operated head that could tilt its head independently of the body. The suit previously used for &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot; was recycled for the long shots during the battle with Rodan, the rampage through Tokyo, and the character&#x27;s departure into the sea during the end credits.

==Release==
===English versions===
After the film was released in Japan, Toho commissioned a Hong Kong company to dub the film into English. In this international version of the movie, an English title card was superimposed over the Japanese title, as had been done with the previous 1990s &quot;Godzilla&quot; films.

In past English releases, including dubbed films and video game titles, Rodan&#x27;s name was pronounced &quot;roh-dan.&quot; In Japan, however, his name has always been pronounced (and spelled in &quot;katakana&quot;) as &quot;rah-dohn&quot;(ラドン). In the English version of this film, the producers changed his name back to Radon, as it is in Japan.

Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot; on home video on August 3, 1999. This was the first time the film had been officially released in the United States. Instead of using the original monaural English dub, a newer stereo version was included, with the main characters&#x27; lines and most other dialog re-recorded by a mostly different Hong Kong cast. Most of the new cast did not start dubbing until the late &#x27;90s. The purpose or origin of this revised English version is unknown. TriStar additionally cut the end credits and created new titles and opening credits.

The original version of the international dub is not known to have ever been released on video in its complete form. The only evidence of its existence is in the Hindi theatrical version. The Hindi dubbing company lacked a clean music and effects track and only had access to a copy of the original English version. Therefore, English dialog was muted and replaced with library tracks and music from other parts of the film itself, but occasionally the English source track was left intact.

An anamorphic widescreen transfer of the &quot;new&quot; English version was later released on DVD by TriStar in February 2005 with the option to listen to the original Japanese audio.

===Box office===
The film sold tickets in Japan, earning (roughly ) in distributor rental income and in gross receipts. The film grossed a total box office revenue of by 1994.

===Critical response===
The film received mostly positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, an approval rating of 83% based on 6 reviews, with a rating average of 7.2/10.&quot;

Monster Zero said that &quot;some critical flaws exist&quot; but felt overall that &quot;of all the films of the [Heisei era], &quot;Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla II&quot; represents Toho&#x27;s most technically and artistically successful effort,&quot; adding that &quot;the action sequences in this film are impeccable... excitingly staged, logical, and quite dramatic.&quot; American Kaiju said the film &quot;stumbles in the areas of both story and special effects&quot; but concluded it to be &quot;a good, solid entry in the Godzilla series,&quot; saying that &quot;the battles between Godzilla and Mechagodilla entertain&quot; and &quot;Akira Ifukube&#x27;s music score soars.&quot; Japan Hero said &quot;the story was interesting,&quot; &quot;the soundtrack is plain gorgeous,&quot; and &quot;the costume designs are just as great,&quot; concluding: &quot;While this is not my top favorite movie [of the Heisei series], it is definitely one of the best.&quot;

===Home media===
The film has been released twice on home media. The first release, by Columbia/Tristar Home Entertainment, was released on February 8, 2005. The subtitles for the Japanese track are really &quot;dubtitles&quot; (the subtitles are actually the captions for the English track). The video transfer is a 1.78:1 widescreen version of TriStar&#x27;s print. This means the Toho logos and end credits have been cut and all the onscreen, optical text from Toho&#x27;s international version has been removed or replaced by video-generated text.

The second release was by Sony on Blu-ray as part of The Toho Godzilla Collection and was released on May 6, 2014, in a two-disc double feature with &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot;.

===Merchandise===
In addition to its box office gross, the film generated a further from sales of books and merchandise by 1994, for a combined generated from the box office, book sales and merchandise sales, making it the most profitable non-animated Japanese film at the time.

<text>Patrick Joseph Toomey Jr. (born November 17, 1961) is an American businessman and politician who served as a United States senator from Pennsylvania from 2011 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he served three terms as the U.S. representative for , from 1999 to 2005.

Of mixed Irish Catholic and Azorean descent, Toomey graduated from Harvard College. A former Wall Street banker, Toomey narrowly lost the Republican primary for United States Senate in 2004. From 2005 to 2009, he served as president of the Club for Growth. Toomey won the Republican primary for the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania, and was elected to the seat after defeating the Democratic nominee, former U.S. Navy three-star admiral and congressman Joe Sestak, in the general election. He was reelected to the Senate in 2016, defeating Democratic nominee Katie McGinty.

On October 5, 2020, Toomey announced that he would not run for reelection to a third Senate term in 2022. On February 13, 2021, Toomey was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Donald Trump of incitement of insurrection in his second impeachment trial. After leaving office, Toomey joined the board of Apollo Global Management.

==Early life and education==

Toomey was born on November 17, 1961, in Providence, Rhode Island, the third of six children of Catholic parents, Mary Ann (née Andrews) of East Providence and Patrick Joseph Toomey of Providence. His father was of Irish descent and his mother of Portuguese ancestry. His mother&#x27;s grandparents were all born in the Azores. His father was a union worker who laid cable for the Narragansett Electric Company, and his mother worked as a part-time secretary at St. Martha&#x27;s Catholic Church.

Toomey was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and attained the organization&#x27;s highest rank, Eagle Scout. He attended La Salle Academy on a scholarship, where he participated in the Close Up Washington civic education program and graduated as valedictorian. He then attended Harvard College, where he graduated with a B.A. in government in 1984.

==Early career==
After graduation, Toomey was hired by Chemical Bank, where he was involved in currency swap transactions. In 1986, he was hired by Morgan, Grenfell &amp; Co., where he dealt in multiple foreign currencies, interest rates, and currency-related derivatives.

In 1991, Toomey resigned from Morgan, Grenfell after it was acquired by Deutsche Bank. He later said he resigned out of concern that Deutsche Bank would impose a less flexible and entrepreneurial work environment. The same year, Toomey and two younger brothers, Steven and Michael opened Rookie&#x27;s Restaurant in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

In 1994, Toomey was elected to Allentown&#x27;s newly established Government Study Commission. During his term, he drafted a new charter for the commission requiring a supermajority for any tax increase and established a split-roll tax system that levied taxes on land at higher rate than taxes on buildings. Allentown voters approved the charter on April 23, 1996.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;1998

In 1998, Toomey ran for the Pennsylvania&#x27;s 15th congressional district, based in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania, after Democratic incumbent U.S. Representative Paul McHale decided to retire. Toomey won the six-candidate Republican primary with 27% of the vote.

In the general election, Toomey faced state Senator Roy Afflerbach, a former Pennsylvania State Representative. During the campaign, Toomey criticized the agenda of the Clinton-Gore administration, especially its plans to modify the Internal Revenue Service. He said the plan did not &quot;address the real fundamental problems plaguing American taxpayers&quot; and said the IRS should be abolished.

Later in the campaign, Toomey and Afflerbach debated the effectiveness of a flat tax-based system, an issue on which they sharply disagreed. Toomey promised to serve no more than three terms if elected. He defeated Afflerbach, 55%–45%.

;2000
Toomey was reelected to a second term, defeating Ed O&#x27;Brien, president of the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania-based United Steelworkers Local 2598, 53%–47%. He won Lehigh County with 54% and Northampton County with 51%.

;2002
Toomey was reelected to a third term, defeating O&#x27;Brien again, 57%–43%. He won Lehigh County with 58% and Northampton County, with 54%.

;2004
In accordance with his 1998 pledge not to serve more than three terms in the House, Toomey did not run for reelection in 2004. He decided to challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Arlen Specter in the primary instead. He lost the primary by a narrow margin.

===Tenure===
Toomey served as the U.S. Representative for from 1999 to 2005. In the House, he distinguished himself as a fiscal expert. He pushed to decrease government spending and to set aside money for debt reduction.

In 2001, Toomey proposed a budget that would cut taxes worth $2.2 trillion over ten years, exceeding Bush&#x27;s $1.6 trillion plan.

In 2002, Toomey voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution which authorized military action against Iraq.

Toomey strongly opposed Bush&#x27;s plan for comprehensive immigration reform, saying &quot;I think it&#x27;s a slap in the face for the millions of people throughout the world who decide to take the effort to legally enter our country.&quot; He was a longtime supporter of creating Medicare Part D, but said he would not vote for it unless it lowered costs and guaranteed competition between government and private insurers.

In January 1999, Toomey was named to the House Budget Committee.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===
====2004====
In 2004, Toomey challenged longtime incumbent Senator Arlen Specter in the Republican primary election. His campaign was aided by $2 million of advertising from the Club for Growth. Toomey&#x27;s election campaign theme was that Specter was not a conservative, especially on fiscal issues. Most of the state&#x27;s Republican establishment including Pennsylvania&#x27;s other U.S. Senator, Rick Santorum, and President George W. Bush supported Specter. Specter won by 1.6 percentage points, about 17,000 votes out of over one million cast.

====2010====
On April 15, 2009, Toomey announced his intention to again challenge Specter in the 2010 Republican primary.

On April 28, 2009, Specter announced he would switch parties and run as a Democrat, after polls showed him losing to Toomey in the primary. Specter&#x27;s withdrawal left Toomey as the front-runner for the 2010 Republican nomination. Both primaries were held on May 18, 2010.

Toomey defeated Peg Luksik in the Republican primary, 81%–19%, and Specter lost the Democratic primary, 54%–46% to U.S. Representative Joe Sestak of Delaware County. The general election was spiteful and cost over $50 million including spending by the candidates, political parties, and outside groups. Toomey won 51%–49%, carrying most of the state&#x27;s counties.

====2016====

Toomey ran for reelection to the Senate in 2016. He was endorsed by the Club for Growth. He was unopposed in the Republican primary and won the general election with 48.9% of the vote, to Democratic nominee Katie McGinty&#x27;s 47.2% and Libertarian challenger Ed Clifford&#x27;s 3.85%.

===Tenure===
Toomey was the first Lehigh Valley resident to serve as Senator from Pennsylvania since Richard Brodhead in the mid-19th century. He was elected to the United States Senate on November 2, 2010, and his term began on January 3, 2011. He joined the Congressional Hispanic Conference, a caucus of which he was an original member in his days in the House.

On August 11, 2011, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell named Toomey to the United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The committee&#x27;s duties included composing a package of spending cuts for submission to both Houses of Congress.

On April 26, 2012, Toomey was selected to chair the United States Senate Steering Committee, a caucus of several Republican senators who collaborate on legislation. He succeeded Senator Jim DeMint, who had previously expressed his intention to transfer the committee&#x27;s chairmanship to a member of the Republican 2010 Senate class.

On October 6, 2018, Toomey was one of 50 senators (49 Republicans, 1 Democrat) to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Toomey and Senator Bob Casey disagreed on how evidence of sexual assault against Kavanaugh should be handled.

Some activists have criticized Toomey for not meeting frequently enough with his constituents, including never having held an in-person town hall in Philadelphia despite having held at least 47 &quot;teleconference town-hall meetings&quot; with his constituents. These &quot;teleconference town-hall meetings&quot; could have as many as 10,000 people on a single call, and when he has held in-person town-hall meetings Toomey has been accused of having selected the audience.

In February 2019, Toomey was one of 16 senators to vote against legislation preventing a partial government shutdown and containing $1.375 billion for barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border which included 55 miles of fencing.

In March 2019, Toomey was one of 12 Republican senators to cosponsor a resolution that would impose a constitutional amendment limiting the Supreme Court to nine justices. The resolution was introduced after multiple Democratic presidential candidates expressed openness to the idea of expanding the Supreme Court.

On June 5, 2019, Toomey recognized the 20th Anniversary of the SMART Congressional Initiative.

On April 17, 2020, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appointed Toomey to the COVID-19 Congressional Oversight Commission to oversee the implementation of the CARES Act.

On October 4, 2020, Toomey was reported to be retiring at the conclusion of his term, forgoing a reelection campaign or a run for governor in 2022. He confirmed the report the next day.

==Political positions==
===Education===
Toomey has strongly supported increased public spending on charter schools. In 2017, he supported Betsy DeVos as President Trump&#x27;s pick for Secretary of Education. At the time of the vote, Toomey&#x27;s campaigns had received $60,500 from the DeVos family during his career. There were weekly protests at his office and high numbers of calls, faxes, and emails were noted.

===Environment===
Toomey rejects that there is a scientific consensus on climate change. In 2010, he said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s clear that [climate change] has happened. The extent to which that has been caused by human activity I think is not as clear. I think that is still very much disputed and has been debated.&quot; In 2011, he voted to limit the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In 2013, he voted for a point of order opposing a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions. In 2015, he voted against the Clean Power Plan.

Toomey has a consistent record of voting against environmental interests or supporting them only with limiting provisions. In 2000, he opposed implementing the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to curb greenhouse gases. In 2001, he voted against raising corporate average fuel economy standards and providing incentives for alternative fuels. In 2003, he supported the Healthy Forests Initiative, which aimed to combat wildfires by allowing timber harvests in protected forests. In 2014, he supported protecting the Allegheny National Forest, saying, &quot;Congress should ensure that the Forest Service prioritize limited resources to adequately manage the lands for which it is currently responsible, rather continue to acquire additional property.&quot; In 2017, he opposed restricting oil drilling and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

In a series of roll-call votes attached to debate over the Keystone pipeline on January 21, 2015, Toomey voted against an amendment offered by Brian Schatz expressing the sense of Congress regarding climate change but in favor of a similar amendment offered by John Hoeven.

In July 2021, Toomey said that the data on global warming is not clear enough to justify imposing new regulatory burdens on consumers.

The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) 2021 National Environmental Scorecard gave Toomey a 18% score, with a lifetime score of 7%.

===Government shutdown===
In 2013, Toomey was one of 18 senators to vote against the bill to reopen the government during the United States government shutdown of 2013. Of his vote, he said: &quot;The one major redeeming aspect of this bill is that it reopens the government... I cannot support piling hundreds of billions of dollars of debt on current and future generations of Americans without even a sliver of reform to start putting our fiscal house in order.&quot;

===Deregulation===
Toomey is a strong supporter of banking deregulation. In 2019, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported &quot;10 of his 17 biggest campaign contributors are financial company officials.&quot;

Regarding deregulation of the financial services industry, Toomey said in 1999, &quot;The trend in deregulation, beginning in the early 1980s, is one of the biggest reasons for the sustained economic expansion. I would like to see us continue to deregulate on many fronts, including the financial services industry.&quot;

While serving on the House Banking Committee, in 1999 Toomey helped write House Resolution 10, which led to the repeal of parts of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act. The repeal of the Act which had regulated the separation of banks and investment firms, allowed for companies that combined banking and investment operations.

Toomey was also a supporter of the deregulation of the derivatives market, an area in which he had professional experience, stating that he believed the market to be adequately regulated by banking supervisors and state-level regulators. He pressed the House to pass the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 because it would &quot;eliminate most of the cloud of legal and regulatory uncertainty that has shadowed&quot; derivatives since their invention. He stated that he hoped that the Senate would modify the bill to &quot;allow greater flexibility in the electronic trading&quot; of over-the-counter derivatives.

Toomey was a leading sponsor of the JOBS Act which passed the Senate in March 2012. The Act would reduce costs for businesses that go public by phasing in SEC regulations for &quot;emerging growth companies&quot; over a five-year period. It would also help startup companies raise capital by reducing some SEC regulations.

Toomey orchestrated legislation to repeal consumer protection measures enacted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which had been intended to prevent auto lenders from discriminating on the basis of race.

===Gun policy===
In 2013, in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Toomey and Senator Joe Manchin introduced legislation that would have required a background check for most gun sales. The legislation failed and failed again when it was reintroduced in 2015, and again in 2016 after the mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub. In June 2016, Toomey voted against a bill that would prohibit gun purchases by people on the no-fly list because of concerns that there was no process for those on the no-fly list to seek removal if they were on the list in error. Instead, he sought to find compromise across a number of competing proposals, some partisan, and some bipartisan; none succeeded. After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Toomey renewed his calls for background checks, but a bill never came to vote. Toomey&#x27;s and Manchin&#x27;s background check proposal came up again after the Robb Elementary School shooting. The two senators were part of a bipartisan group of 20 senators working on a &quot;modest&quot; deal for gun control that included a red flag provision, a support for state crisis intervention orders, funding for school safety resources, stronger background checks for buyers under the age of 21, and penalties for straw purchases. That deal later became the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which Toomey voted for.

Toomey opposed President Obama&#x27;s executive orders on gun control as contrary to the constitutional system of checks and balances, but believes Congress should pass background checks. He received nearly $93,000 from gun-rights groups, including the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF), who endorsed his 2010 election campaign. His &quot;A&quot; rating fell to a &quot;C&quot; (&quot;poor&quot;) in 2016 after he started championing background check legislation.

In a 2022 interview with &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, Toomey said that Republicans can stay consistent on Second Amendment rights while still supporting gun-control measures like background checks and state red flag laws (with respect to due process), and addressing school safety and mental health issues.

In 2004, Toomey said he believes society should give special benefits only to couples who meet the &quot;traditional&quot; definition of marriage as &quot;one man, one woman.&quot; That same year, he voted in support of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. In 2015, Toomey disagreed with the Supreme Court decision which found that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional.

In 2010, Toomey supported the repeal of Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell, a policy that banned openly gay or bisexual persons from serving in the military, in a statement made while he was Senator-elect.

In November 2013, Toomey proposed an amendment exempting private religious entities from following the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. The amendment failed. After the bill received the 60 votes required for cloture, Toomey cast his vote in support.

Following the cloture vote, Toomey said he had long believed that more legal protections are appropriate to prevent employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, but planned to modify the bill to offer religious groups more &quot;leeway&quot;.

===Healthcare===
Toomey opposed the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act which he argued was fiscally irresponsible. His 2012 budget proposal called for turning Medicaid into a block grant to states and cutting federal funding for the program in half by 2021, which exceeded even the budget cuts proposed by Paul Ryan.

Toomey opposes the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has supported multiple efforts to dismantle, repeal or defund it.

Toomey intervened to have Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year-old girl dying of cystic fibrosis at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia, moved ahead of other recipients in obtaining a lung transplant, on the grounds that the existing policy reduced access for children. As a 10-year-old, Murnaghan was eligible for transplants only from other children, not from adults leading to a longer waiting time than adult patients. Some doctors said this decision privileged Murnaghan and another child over other recipients, and privileged them above a national policy of allocating organs according to well-established rules. Murnaghan&#x27;s case resulted in a permanent organ transplant policy change for pediatric patients.

In 2017, as Republicans tried to repeal Obamacare, Toomey said the independent insurance market was in a &quot;death spiral&quot; because of the ACA. Toomey helped write the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare.

On August 7, 2022, Toomey was one of 43 votes against a failed amendment in the Senate that would cap insulin costs at $35 per month.

===Taxes and government spending===
Toomey advocates for replacing graduated taxes based with a flat tax based upon income levels. He also favors abolishing the IRS, and has voted to reduce the capital gains tax, eliminate the estate tax, cut small business taxes, eliminate the &quot;marriage penalty&quot;, cut federal income taxes and corporate taxes, and expand tax credits.

Toomey publicly opposed the 2009 federal stimulus package. He opposes government-run or subsidized healthcare and farm subsidies.

In 2011, Toomey sponsored a federal balanced budget amendment. He supported extending unemployment benefits and offsetting the cost with reduced government spending in other areas.

In his first term in Congress, Toomey took credit for getting $12 million in earmark spending for businesses in his district. In 2010 he claimed but provided no proof that he eventually ceased getting earmarks as a congressman, when as a Senate candidate he signed the &quot;No Pork&quot; pledge. In December 2011, Toomey and Senator Claire McCaskill introduced the Earmark Elimination Act of 2011. The bill failed and failed again when it was reintroduced in 2014.

In September 2018, Toomey was among six Republican senators who voted against a $854 billion spending bill meant to avoid another government shutdown. The bill included funding for the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor and Education.

===Social issues===
Toomey is pro-life. While running for the Senate in 2010, he said he supports legislation to ban abortions and jail sentences for doctors who perform them. As a senator, Toomey voted for a bill that would have banned abortions after 20 weeks with no exceptions for the health of pregnant women and girls and new limits in cases of rape and incest. In January 2020, Toomey also signed an amicus brief urging the US Supreme Court to overturn several of its past rulings protecting abortion rights, including &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. When he first ran for Congress in 1998, Toomey said he believed abortion should be legal only in the first trimester.

Toomey voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act in 2013.

In March 2015, Toomey voted for an amendment to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to allow employees to earn paid sick time.

In July 2020, Toomey joined fellow Republican Senator Mitt Romney in condemning Trump&#x27;s decision to commute Roger Stone&#x27;s sentence, saying that while Trump &quot;clearly has the legal and constitutional authority to grant clemency for federal crimes,&quot; commuting Stone&#x27;s sentence was a &quot;mistake&quot; due in part to the severity of the charges against him and that &quot;Attorney General Bill Barr stated he thought Mr. Stone&#x27;s prosecution was &#x27;righteous&#x27; and &#x27;appropriate&#x27; and the sentence he received was &#x27;fair.&#x27;&quot;

===Immigration===
Toomey supported Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to impose a ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.

In February 2019, Toomey was one of 16 senators to vote against legislation preventing a partial government shutdown and containing $1.375 billion for barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border that included 55 miles of fencing. In March 2019, Toomey was one of 12 Republican senators to vote to block Trump&#x27;s national emergency declaration that would have granted him access to $3.6 billion in military construction funding to build border barriers.

===Impeachment===
====Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices====
In February 2018, Toomey said that it was worth discussing whether to impeach justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court who had ruled that a gerrymandered congressional map violated the Pennsylvania constitution.

====President Donald Trump====
In December 2019, Toomey said that it was not worth discussing whether to impeach Trump after he allegedly tried to extort the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, by demanding that Zelenskyy start a criminal investigation of Vice President Joseph Biden or at least falsely announce an investigation was underway of Trump&#x27;s allegation that Biden engaged in corruption in Ukraine. &quot;Where is the crime?&quot; said Toomey at a Republican fundraiser. Earlier Toomey had described Trump&#x27;s attempt to force Zelenskyy to make false allegations about the Democratic presidential candidate as &quot;errors of judgment&quot;. Toomey had harsher words for House Democrats, accusing them of &quot;disgracefully breaking with&quot; bipartisan precedent on impeachment inquiries.

Later that month, the House impeached Trump on multiple charges, including abuse of power in the attempted extortion of Zelenskyy. Even after Trump was impeached, Toomey continued to insist that his offenses were &quot;not impeachable&quot; and opposed hearing from any witnesses at Trump&#x27;s trial. &quot;We should move as quickly as we can to get this thing over with, get this behind us,&quot; Toomey said, adding, &quot;Even if someone believes that everything John Bolton says is going to confirm what&#x27;s charged in these articles, it&#x27;s still not impeachable.&quot; (The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported Bolton had written in his forthcoming book that Trump had told him in August 2019 that he wanted to continue freezing the Ukraine aid until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.) Along with all but one of the other Republican senators, Toomey voted against convicting Trump on the two articles for which he had been impeached by the House.

On January 9, 2021, Toomey said he thought Trump had performed an impeachable offense for his role in the January 6 United States Capitol attack, but he did not say if he would vote to convict in the Senate. On February 13, 2021, he joined all Democratic senators and six Republicans in voting to convict.

===Foreign policy===
In September 2016, Toomey was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of State John Kerry advocating that the United States use &quot;all available tools to dissuade Russia from continuing its airstrikes in Syria&quot; from an Iranian airbase near Hamadan &quot;that are clearly not in our interest&quot; and stating that there should be clear enforcement by the US of the airstrikes violating &quot;a legally binding Security Council Resolution&quot; on Iran.

In November 2017, Toomey co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which made it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

In March 2018, Toomey voted to table a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee which would have required Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda.

In April 2018, Toomey was one of eight Republican senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and acting Secretary of State John Sullivan expressing &quot;deep concern&quot; over a report by the United Nations exposing &quot;North Korean sanctions evasion involving Russia and China&quot; and asserting that the findings &quot;demonstrate an elaborate and alarming military-venture between rogue, tyrannical states to avoid United States and international sanctions and inflict terror and death upon thousands of innocent people&quot; while calling it &quot;imperative that the United States provides a swift and appropriate response to the continued use of chemical weapons used by President Assad and his forces, and works to address the shortcomings in sanctions enforcement.&quot;

On August 10, 2020, Toomey, along with 10 other U.S. individuals, was sanctioned by the Chinese government for &quot;behaving badly on Hong Kong-related issues&quot;.

===Trade===
In January 2018, Toomey was one of 36 Republican senators to sign a letter to Trump requesting that he preserve the North American Free Trade Agreement by modernizing it for the economy of the 21st century.

In November 2018, Toomey was one of 12 Republican senators to sign a letter to Trump requesting that the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement be submitted to Congress by the end of the month to allow a vote before the end of the year; they were concerned that &quot;passage of the USMCA as negotiated will become significantly more difficult&quot; in the incoming 116th United States Congress.

===January 6 United States Capitol attack===
On May 28, 2021, Toomey abstained from voting on the creation of an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

==Personal life==
In November 1997, Toomey married Kris Ann Duncan. The couple has three children. After leaving the Senate in 2023, Toomey joined the board of Apollo Global Management.

<doc id="650232" wikidata="Q1533787" url="?curid=650232" title="Godflesh">
<text>Godflesh are an English industrial metal band from Birmingham. The group formed in 1982 under the original title O.P.D. (later Fall of Because) but did not release any complete music until 1988 when Justin Broadrick (guitar, vocals, programming) and B. C. Green (bass, programming) renamed the band and decided to use a drum machine for percussion. Melding heavy metal with industrial music and later with electronic music and dub, Godflesh&#x27;s sound is widely regarded as a foundational influence on other industrial metal and post-metal acts and as significant to both experimental and extreme metal.

The band signed to Earache Records in the late 1980s and released their debut album &quot;Streetcleaner&quot; (1989) to contemporary and lasting acclaim. After the release of their sophomore album &quot;Pure&quot; (1992) and their major label debut &quot;Selfless&quot; (1994), they started experimenting with live drums as well as hip hop and breakbeat sounds. The resulting albums, &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot; (1996) and &quot;Us and Them&quot; (1999), were followed by &quot;Hymns&quot; (2001), which saw a simplification of the band&#x27;s style. Shortly after Green&#x27;s departure in 2002, Broadrick ended Godflesh and pursued various other projects, such as Jesu. Broadrick and Green reformed Godflesh in 2009, releasing &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; (2014) and &quot;Post Self&quot; (2017) to critical acclaim. Their ninth album, &quot;Purge&quot;, was released in June 2023.

As pioneers of industrial metal, Godflesh&#x27;s early sound was defined by harsh machine beats, production-emphasised bass, distorted guitar and sparse vocals delivered in a low, guttural fashion. The band performed for most of their career as a duo with Broadrick and Green playing over preprogrammed percussion, normally to a backdrop of apocalyptic scenery and Christian iconography. Godflesh&#x27;s music has been regarded as especially heavy and grim, with &quot;Streetcleaner&quot; being named by several publications as one of the heaviest and greatest metal albums.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1982–1988)===
The band that would eventually become Godflesh, O.P.D. (Officially Pronounced Dead), formed in 1982 when B. C. Green and Paul Neville, two young musicians living in cheap council estate housing in east Birmingham, started experimenting musically alongside a drum machine. In 1983, the band renamed to Fall of Because, named after a Killing Joke song and a chapter from an Aleister Crowley book. The band found a live drummer, Justin Broadrick, who lived in the same council housing as Green and Neville. Broadrick joined the group in 1984 after organising a concert at The Mermaid in Birmingham. At that show, Fall of Because, Final (Broadrick&#x27;s first musical act), and an early incarnation of Napalm Death performed before a crowd of twenty-five people. In the months following that concert, Broadrick joined Napalm Death as a guitarist and Fall of Because as a drummer and altered the latter&#x27;s sound by introducing albums from Swans, Sonic Youth and Discharge to Green and Neville. Only fifteen at the time, Broadrick said he &quot;usurped&quot; their band.

Fall of Because recorded a demo titled &quot;Extirpate&quot; in 1986, which contained several tracks that would become Godflesh songs. Due to these recordings not being widely available until 1999, they were retrospectively recognised as &quot;eerily&quot; ahead of their time by &quot;Exclaim!&quot;. Later in 1986, Broadrick was invited to play drums for Head of David, leading to his departure from Napalm Death and soon after from Fall of Because in 1987. Then, in March 1988, he left Head of David for being, according to Broadrick, &quot;too noisy of a drummer&quot;, and contacted Green in April to reform Fall of Because as a duo. In that reformation, Broadrick took over on guitar, and the band went back to employing a drum machine for percussion. It was then that the group was renamed Godflesh. Broadrick explained the new name by saying, &quot;I heard someone once say that music is the voice of God. The word &#x27;God&#x27; conjures something immense and inconceivable. The &#x27;flesh&#x27; part is what effects you on a physical level. Our music is loud and destructive.&quot;

===Self-titled EP, &quot;Streetcleaner&quot; and &quot;Pure&quot; (1988–1993)===
Inspired by the bleak urban landscape of Birmingham and the extreme music Broadrick introduced to Green, Godflesh took on a distinctly heavier tone than the primarily Cure-influenced Fall of Because. In 1988, the band established a presence in underground music by releasing their self-titled extended play (EP) through the Swordfish label. That EP, considered the source of industrial metal alongside Ministry&#x27;s 1988 studio album &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot;, combined programmed industrial beats, distorted vocals, low guitar and driving bass riffs to create the sound that Godflesh would become known for.

Shortly after the &quot;Godflesh&quot; release, the band recorded another EP titled &quot;Tiny Tears&quot; comprising four short, rough songs. Before Swordfish could release this EP, though, Godflesh were acquired by Earache Records, and the label&#x27;s founder, Digby Pearson, convinced Broadrick and Green to shelve &quot;Tiny Tears&quot; and use the songs as bonus tracks on their first full-length album. The band agreed, and in 1989 they released &quot;Streetcleaner&quot;, which went on to receive critical acclaim and recognition as a landmark album in heavy metal music. &quot;Streetcleaner&quot; saw the reintroduction of Neville into the band, this time as the second guitarist, and it marked the band&#x27;s first release of many on Earache. The album further defined Godflesh&#x27;s sound, standing out from other metal releases with unusual production that emphasised mechanical beats and percussive bass over guitar. &quot;Streetcleaner&quot; is regarded as particularly heavy and bleak.

From February to March 1991, Godflesh were again in the studio, recording the &quot;Slavestate&quot; EP, which saw the band experimenting with dance and more electronic elements. Later that year in April, Godflesh embarked on their first tour of North America (a leg of Earache&#x27;s Grindcrusher tour) with labelmates Nocturnus and Napalm Death. According to Mike Browning of Nocturnus, most of the shows of the 45-day tour were attended by 200 to 300 people. Godflesh missed the first concert due to permit issues, but they made it to the second date at the L&#x27;Amour in Brooklyn. The venue was full, and when Godflesh took the stage, their drum machine failed and the band could not continue. When a replacement machine was eventually found, Broadrick and Green hastily programmed in four songs to be ready for the tour&#x27;s third show at the Channel in Boston. Despite these initial difficulties, the rest of the tour went well and Godflesh drew surprisingly positive reception. &quot;Slavestate&quot; was released in July after Grindcrusher had concluded. In August and October 1991, both Broadrick and Green guested on &quot;Buried Secrets&quot; (1992), an EP by Painkiller.

With the successes of &quot;Streetcleaner&quot;, &quot;Slavestate&quot;, a concert opening for Nirvana and the Grindcrusher tour, Godflesh started on their second album, this time without Neville, who chose to focus on his other project, Cable Regime, which featured Broadrick as a recurring producer. To fill the void, Robert Hampson of Loop was brought in to play on half of the new album&#x27;s tracks as well as on &quot;Cold World&quot; (1991), an EP recorded in the same sessions. The sophomore album, &quot;Pure&quot;, was released in 1992 through Earache and has since been recognised as an influential release in the post-metal genre. Musically, &quot;Pure&quot; was even more mechanical than &quot;Streetcleaner&quot;, further emphasising the drum machine and featuring production that augmented the percussion with a stark, bleak atmosphere. Though Godflesh&#x27;s most overt experiments with hip hop and breakbeats occurred later in their career, &quot;Pure&quot; featured elements of both buried under the wailing guitar, shouted vocals and aggressively repetitive drumming. The album continued its experimentation with atypical song structures on its conclusion, &quot;Pure II&quot;, a twenty-minute ambient drone piece with a submerged beat that, as AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett said, &quot;hits like a distant cannon&quot;.

Despite Broadrick&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the mixing on &quot;Pure&quot; being &quot;not heavy enough&quot;, many critics regarded the album as unrelenting; in a positive review, &quot;Spin&quot; Mike Gitter wrote that &quot;Hiroshima was probably more fun [than &quot;Pure&quot;]&quot;. In support of the album, Godflesh planned to open for Ministry on another tour of North America, but instead ended up opening for the electro-industrial band Skinny Puppy on their &quot;Last Rights&quot; (1992) tour. Due again to issues with entering the United States, Godflesh were forced to cancel a number of these dates; they later returned to those markets as headliners to make the missed shows up. Broadrick retrospectively said that this era of the band stands as &quot;the most honest representation of what Godflesh set out to achieve.&quot;

===&quot;Selfless&quot;, &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot; and &quot;Us and Them&quot; (1994–2000)===
After a year of minimal activity in 1993, Godflesh were approached by several record labels. According to Broadrick, Danny Goldberg of Atlantic Records invited them to London and expressed his desire to acquire the band. About this period, Broadrick said, &quot;They really thought that Godflesh could be the next Nine Inch Nails and that we would be selling out fucking stadiums. The buzz at the time was ridiculous. It outweighed the sales, obviously. It was all hype.&quot; Ultimately, the band ended up with major record label Columbia for the release of the EP &quot;Merciless&quot; in 1994, the title track of which was originally a Fall of Because song. Another EP, &quot;Messiah&quot; was recorded during these sessions, but it was not released on a wide scale until 2003 through Relapse Records. Later in 1994, the band released their third album, &quot;Selfless&quot;, which represented a shift in the group to a more high-end production approach and to a greater focus on traditional heavy metal riffs. Despite being the band&#x27;s best-selling record with approximately 180,000 copies shipped, &quot;Selfless&quot; was deemed a commercial disappointment. This coupled with the ban of Godflesh&#x27;s first major music video led to the end of their collaboration with Columbia.

Feeling abandoned after being abruptly dropped by Columbia, Godflesh were briefly directionless in 1995. In 1996, the band returned to Earache and created their fourth studio album, &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot;, which was Godflesh&#x27;s first music made with a human drummer since the early Fall of Because days; Bryan Mantia of Praxis provided the aggressive, non-mechanical drumming. In retrospect, Broadrick believed &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot; marked the point where Godflesh lost sight of their original goal and started making &quot;self-conscious&quot; music. When it came time for the album&#x27;s 1996 tour, Mantia made the move to join Primus, and Godflesh recruited Ted Parsons of Prong and Swans to perform on the tour in his place. Along with the album&#x27;s follow-up remix release, &quot;Love and Hate in Dub&quot; (1997), &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot; moved away from Godflesh&#x27;s industrial roots into experimentation with conventional verse-chorus format, hip hop, dub and drum and bass. The remix album was supported by a one-off concert on 4 October 1997 at The Garage, London where Broadrick operated a mixing desk, Steve Hough played guitar, Green played bass and Diarmuid Dalton provided support on a Moog synthesiser.

This experimentation continued and increased with Godflesh&#x27;s next album, &quot;Us and Them&quot; (1999). While live drumming was dropped again in favour of percussive machines, &quot;Us and Them&quot; saw the group going further with electronics and drum-and-bass-oriented sound than ever before. Broadrick was quick to admit that he &quot;hated&quot; the album and that it was an &quot;identity crisis&quot;. Retrospectively, though, he revised his thoughts, saying that his hatred was overstated despite him still having issues with the album. Shortly after releasing &quot;Us and Them&quot; in 1999, Godflesh began work on a proposed remix album, &quot;Us and Them in Dub&quot;. While this album was never released, two tracks from it appeared on the 2001 compilation &quot;In All Languages&quot;. Also in 1999, &quot;Life Is Easy&quot;, an album compiling Godflesh&#x27;s recordings as Fall of Because, was released on the Alleysweeper label and distributed via Martin Atkins&#x27; Invisible Records label.

===&quot;Hymns&quot; and dissolution (2001–2002)===
Following the release of the double album compilation &quot;In All Languages&quot;, Godflesh released their sixth studio album, &quot;Hymns&quot; (2001) through several different labels. The album again saw Godflesh with a human drummer; Parsons returned to provide the live percussion and, according to Broadrick, the inspiration for Godflesh to continue. &quot;Hymns&quot; marked a dramatic shift away from Godflesh&#x27;s recent experimentation, moving instead into the realm of direct heavy metal, with only a few tracks revealing hip hop or electronic influence; Broadrick wanted &quot;Hymns&quot; to be more of a rock album than any other Godflesh releases. The album was recorded in a professional studio and a producer outside of the band was brought in to oversee the process, two firsts for Godflesh that Parsons believed to be mistakes. Despite receiving positive reviews, the final product of &quot;Hymns&quot; was ultimately dissatisfying for Broadrick, so much so that he restored it to a state resembling its demos on the 2013 reissue. With the band disheartened by &quot;Hymns&quot;&#x27; troubled production and dreading an upcoming tour, the direct future of Godflesh was unclear.

In October 2001, the same month &quot;Hymns&quot; was released, Broadrick received a call from Green just two weeks before Godflesh were set to tour with Strapping Young Lad and Fear Factory. Over the phone, Green expressed frustration at having to open for young bands despite being in the business since 1982, as well as being forced into a tour for an album that was manipulated from the outside. Green tearfully left Godflesh to return to university and focus on his relationship with his partner. To cope with the departure of his friend, Broadrick devoted all of his effort to maintaining the band. It was quickly announced that Green would be replaced by former Killing Joke and Prong bassist Paul Raven. Though this configuration of Godflesh came up with some ideas for another studio album (namely the usage of a rhythm from Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Shut &#x27;Em Down&quot;), Broadrick was &quot;always aware that a new album was never going to happen&quot;. Not long after this short-lived incarnation of Godflesh performed a handful of shows that Broadrick later said &quot;felt completely wrong&quot;, he experienced a nervous breakdown the day before departing for another tour of North America, this time with High on Fire and Isis. He recalled the breakdown as a &quot;real Brian Wilson moment&quot; and said, &quot;I felt paralyzed by the stress, which had been building for several months, and I literally couldn&#x27;t get out of bed. I was numb and couldn&#x27;t move, so when the car came to pick me up to take me to the airport, I ran and hid at another friend&#x27;s house in Birmingham.&quot; All of the shows were called off, and Godflesh officially disbanded on 10 April 2002.

The cancelled tour caused a number of problems for Broadrick; his thirteen-year relationship with his girlfriend dissolved, and a bus driver who had been hired for the tour threatened his life. In a panic, Broadrick remortgaged his house and amassed approximately US$35,000 to pay the driver and everyone else who had been affected by the cancellation. Broadrick, at a low point in his life, was left with little to do but work on new, different music. About the period, he said, &quot;My only solace, my only escape at that time was recording the first Jesu album.&quot; &quot;Jesu&quot;, the closing track of &quot;Hymns&quot; and, until 2014, the last original Godflesh song, ended with a hidden passage of unusual peacefulness and melodicism. Broadrick&#x27;s next project, bearing the same title of Jesu, adopted that shoegaze sound and the new band&#x27;s first EP, &quot;Heart Ache&quot;, was released in 2004. On promotional material for &quot;Heart Ache&quot;, a message from Broadrick read, &quot;Godflesh is dead, long live Jesu.&quot;

===Reformation (2009–2013)===
After Godflesh&#x27;s dissolution, Broadrick and Green rarely spoke. Though there was no falling out between the two members, Broadrick assumed the project permanently dead, believing that Green&#x27;s interest in it was gone. Regardless, Broadrick decided in 2009 to approach Green with an offer to reform, something that promoters had been pushing for years. Green responded to Broadrick&#x27;s call within a few hours, saying he would love to do it. Both members quickly agreed that the most important thing for the reunion&#x27;s integrity was that they return to a drum machine for percussion. In November 2009, the reunion was made public when Godflesh announced they would perform at the 2010 edition of the Hellfest Summer Open Air in Clisson, France. Asked in a February 2010 interview about Godflesh&#x27;s future, Broadrick replied, &quot;Godflesh will not commit to anything but Hellfest currently. I am unsure as to where we will go from there, if we go anywhere at all.&quot; He also revealed that the likelihood of new material was &quot;fairly minimal&quot;, but that the possibility still existed; though later, in 2014, he insisted that &quot;ultimately, the whole reformation thing was pretty much fundamentally about wanting to make new music&quot;. On 18 June 2010, Godflesh performed for their first time since 2001 at Hellfest. The show was fraught with technical difficulties, ending up as a forty-minute set instead of the intended sixty minutes. Despite the frustration of the return performance, Godflesh continued to play festivals throughout 2010 and 2011, including the 2011 edition of the Roadburn festival in Tilburg, Netherlands, where they performed their first album, &quot;Streetcleaner&quot;, in its entirety. This performance was later released as the group&#x27;s first in 2013.

In December 2010, Broadrick revealed to &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine that Godflesh were gradually assembling new ideas for a studio album. He explained, &quot;It&#x27;s something we&#x27;re discussing all the time, and I do have bits and pieces of material. But it&#x27;s something we&#x27;d really like to develop. It&#x27;d be quite easy to knock out eight to ten in-character songs and release it as quickly as possible to capitalise on the popularity of the group, but it would feel entirely wrong.&quot; In 2011, Godflesh (along with Black Sabbath, Napalm Death, Judas Priest and Led Zeppelin) were recognised by the UK-based &quot;Home of Metal&quot; archival project as significant contributors to the heavy metal genre. With this accolade absorbed, Broadrick continued to confirm the existence of a new Godflesh album throughout 2012, saying it would most likely be out in 2013 after a new EP. In 2013, Godflesh released their first new recording in over twelve years, a cover of Slaughter&#x27;s &quot;F.O.D. (Fuck of Death)&quot;, through &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine&#x27;s flexi disc Series. The flexi disc was included in the November 2013 issue of &quot;Decibel&quot;. Later in 2013, Godflesh performed &quot;Pure&quot; in its entirety at Roadburn, featuring Hampson on guitar for part of the set. In 2014, Broadrick said that disbanding Godflesh was the best thing they had ever done and stated that the upcoming album was his favourite since 1994&#x27;s &quot;Selfless&quot;.

===&quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; and &quot;Post Self&quot; (2014–2021)===
From 2012 to 2014, Godflesh were in Broadrick&#x27;s private studio, working on their seventh album. The process was slow due to Broadrick&#x27;s commitment to making a proper Godflesh album instead of a hollow exploitation of the reformation&#x27;s media attention. After a long revision process, the 2014 EP &quot;Decline &amp; Fall&quot; and the 2014 album &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; came out of those sessions, both of which featured Broadrick on an eight-string guitar. The album was the band&#x27;s first to chart in the U.S., and it was met with critical acclaim, drawing praise for its extreme weight and being lauded as the ideal return for Godflesh. Musically, Broadrick stated &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; was most similar to &quot;Streetcleaner&quot; and &quot;Pure&quot;, and Green added that it was &quot;spiritually&quot; close to those first few releases. About the album&#x27;s sound, Broadrick said, &quot;It&#x27;s extremely minimal and very, very brutal — a fairly unforgiving record, really, I think.&quot; &quot;Decline &amp; Fall&quot; and &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; were heavy, distorted, riff-driven industrial releases that Broadrick saw as a return to the direct simplicity of Godflesh&#x27;s original form. All of the recording, engineering, artwork and packaging was done by Godflesh through Broadrick&#x27;s own label, Avalanche Recordings.

Following a number of tours in support of &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; and an attempt at an &quot;In Dub&quot; remix release with Parsons providing additional drumming, Godflesh returned to the studio in 2016 for a new album. &quot;Post Self&quot;, the band&#x27;s eighth studio album, was released on 17 November 2017, shortly after another performance of &quot;Streetcleaner&quot; in its entirety. Unlike &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; focus on making a bombastic comeback, &quot;Post Self&quot; proved more introspective and moody. Most of the traditional metal riffs were dropped in favour of atmosphere, noise and experimentation. &quot;Post Self&quot; received similar high praise as its predecessor, and both appeared on several publications&#x27; year-end lists. After the release of &quot;Post Self&quot;, Broadrick avoided interviews, hoping to give listeners time to form their own opinions on the music and to retain some of the album&#x27;s &quot;mystique&quot;. Godflesh embarked on a few brief tours and played scattered festivals, including the 2018 edition of Roadburn where they performed all of &quot;Selfless&quot; live for the first time. Broadrick spent a month reprogramming the album&#x27;s percussion from scratch since the original drum parts no longer existed. In an interview with French magazine &quot;New Noise&quot;, Broadrick said that &quot;Selfless&quot; was the last Godflesh album he wanted to play in its entirety.

A compilation album titled &quot;Long Live the New Flesh&quot; was released in July 2021. The album featured most of the band&#x27;s studio material released since reformation in 2010. A shortened digital edition, &quot;New Flesh in Dub Vol 1&quot;, comprising the majority of Godflesh&#x27;s reformation-era remixes alongside two otherwise unreleased tracks from the &quot;Post Self&quot; sessions, was released ahead of the full compilation.

===&quot;Purge&quot; (2022–present)===
Godflesh had started work on a new album by January 2022, and a live album documenting the performance of &quot;Pure&quot; at Roadburn 2013, titled &quot;Pure : Live&quot;, was released in November that year. The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Purge&quot;, was released in June 2023, preceded by the singles &quot;Nero&quot; and &quot;Land Lord&quot;. Near the end of the following year, on 6 December 2024, Godflesh released &quot;A World Lit Only by Dub,&quot; a remix album of 2014&#x27;s &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; that had been in the works since 2013.

==Style and influence==
===Musical style and legacy===
Drawing inspiration from early industrial and noise groups such as Throbbing Gristle and Whitehouse, as well as from ambient musician Brian Eno, noise rock band Swans, post-punk innovators Killing Joke and also Siouxsie and the Banshees and Public Image Ltd., fellow Birmingham heavy metal band Black Sabbath and a wide range of hip hop artists such as Public Enemy, Eric B. &amp; Rakim and Run-DMC, Godflesh were among the pioneers of both industrial metal and post-metal and are considered a significant experimental metal and extreme metal band. Broadrick and Green have both distanced themselves from the industrial metal title, though they concede that the label is accurate on a literal level. They consider Godflesh to be a continuation of post-punk, specifically in regard to furthering Killing Joke&#x27;s sound. When asked in 2005 how he felt about being one of industrial metal&#x27;s founders, Broadrick said, &quot;I think I accidentally formed this genre. I don&#x27;t even really know what this genre is; I just make music.&quot; He expanded upon this statement in 2018 by calling the term industrial metal &quot;limiting&quot;.

Godflesh&#x27;s sound is characterised by a combination of programmed drum machine beats, percussive bass and distorted heavy metal guitar. Though the band would later employ human drumming for &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot; and &quot;Hymns&quot; in 1996 and 2001 respectively (a decision that Broadrick believed compromised the group&#x27;s musical identity), Godflesh&#x27;s early sound was dominated by artificial, stiff drum loops and an uncommon focus on bass. On those early influential releases, the rhythms, synths and samples were credited to &quot;Machine&quot; or &quot;Machines&quot; despite being done by Broadrick. Initially, the employment of mechanical percussion was done out of necessity. When Broadrick rejoined Fall of Because with Green to form Godflesh, the beats he desired were too difficult to play acoustically, so he instead used an Alesis HR-16 drum machine; this decision would prove defining for both Godflesh and for industrial metal at large. Godflesh&#x27;s writing and recording process is guided by Broadrick and generally happens without the aid of a professional studio or producer. According to Broadrick, &quot;50% of the Godflesh material was often born from rhythms and grooves&quot;, and he called the hands-on recording process &quot;primitive&quot;. 

About the band&#x27;s tuning, Green said in a 1997 interview, &quot;We would just tune down as low as we could. We couldn&#x27;t hear anything! But eventually we had to pick a pitch to tune to, so we chose C-sharp. It&#x27;s low and heavy, but you can still make out the notes.&quot; For the early Godflesh albums, the guitars are tuned down to B. Starting with 2014&#x27;s &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire,&quot; Broadrick started using an 8-string guitar tuned to F sharp.

Mike Patton of bands Faith No More and Mr. Bungle is a fan of Godflesh&#x27;s sound, calling them &quot;ridiculously heavy&quot; and &quot;one of the few bands that can make you wonder whether or not your batteries are running out on your stereo.&quot; Patton invited Broadrick to join Faith No More as guitarist after Jim Martin left the band in 1993. He was also asked to join Danzig shortly after Godflesh toured the U.S. with them and Type O Negative in 1994. In both instances, Broadrick declined the offer in favour of continuing to reside in the United Kingdom and work on his own music. Other artists such as Metallica, Fear Factory, Korn, Isis, Neurosis, Pelican, Prurient, Helmet, Prong, Nailbomb, Code Orange, Mortiis, Devin Townsend and Converge were inspired by Godflesh, and in 2014 MetalSucks wrote, &quot;Everyone from Nine Inch Nails to Fear Factory to Batillus probably owes these dudes a couple of checks&quot;. Despite acclaim among critics and fellow musicians, Godflesh have only experienced minimal commercial success; in 2002, shortly before the band dissolved, Broadrick said he had no illusions about selling out stadiums. The goal of Godflesh, according to him, was simply to put out good albums.

===Visual style===
Being interested in horror and art house cinema, both Broadrick and Green incorporated many references to such films in Godflesh. The image on the front of 1988&#x27;s &quot;Godflesh&quot; EP is a still from the 1966 John Frankenheimer film &quot;Seconds&quot;. &quot;Streetcleaner&quot; cover is an image from the movie &quot;Altered States&quot;, a 1980 horror film by director Ken Russell, and the album&#x27;s liner notes feature frames from David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1977). The cover of &quot;Merciless&quot; is derived from the 1943 experimental film &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot;, by Maya Deren. Broadrick repeatedly cited another Russell movie, &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971), as an influence of Godflesh&#x27;s sound. Additionally, Godflesh appeared in the 1995 film &quot;Hideaway&quot;; during one of the movie&#x27;s club scenes, Broadrick and Green can be seen playing onstage in the background, performing the song &quot;Nihil&quot; from &quot;Cold World&quot;.

Apart from cinema, Christian iconography helped inform Godflesh&#x27;s visual style. Broadrick, originally anti-religious, found churches and their related imagery intimidating. In a 2006 interview, Broadrick said, &quot;The imagery of religion, the feeling of like when you walk into a cathedral, the huge feeling of intimidation that you get from Christian religion – everything to do with religion I find totally obsessive.&quot; Broadrick described the worship setting as &quot;suffocating&quot; and &quot;claustrophobic&quot;, saying it played a large role in forming Godflesh&#x27;s style. The covers of &quot;Streetcleaner&quot;, &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot;, &quot;Love and Hate in Dub&quot; and &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; showcase such Christian imagery, as do Godflesh&#x27;s live performances.

===Vocal style and lyrical themes===
Early Godflesh vocals came in the form of screaming and death growls, and lyrics were scarce. Over time, Broadrick&#x27;s delivery expanded to include singing, softness and moments of melody, all things that he would further explore with Jesu. &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot; and &quot;Hymns&quot; saw Godflesh&#x27;s greatest profusion of vocals, while &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; and &quot;Post Self&quot; returned to Broadrick&#x27;s predominantly succinct style. Broadrick&#x27;s voice has been compared to Killing Joke singer Jaz Coleman&#x27;s, a self-proclaimed vocal influence in addition to Kelvin Morris from Discharge and Michael Gira&#x27;s early work with Swans. Godflesh lyrics are cryptic, bleak and generally sparse. Many of Godflesh&#x27;s themes deal with inner conflict, violence, destruction, corruption, religion, loss, emotional extremes and fear. In 2012, Broadrick stated that singing was &quot;a necessary evil&quot; to him and that he never felt he could do it properly; the role of vocalist came to him simply because he was bold enough to approach the microphone.

In a 1990 review of the band&#x27;s self-titled EP, Simon Reynolds of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; noted that Godflesh&#x27;s music rebelled against the overt masculinity found in most metal; he wrote, &quot;Rather than feminise themselves, they&#x27;d rather their masculinity was defeated, their strong bodies crushed and pulverised&quot;. Broadrick echoed this sentiment in the same year, insulting the &quot;celebration of male ego that comes with most metal&quot; and distancing Godflesh from masculine expression; he reinforced his stance in 2012, saying, &quot;Godflesh isn&#x27;t that all-conquering male thing, on stage with a fucking sword and saying they&#x27;re going to &#x27;rape and pillage&#x27;. Pure comedy.&quot; Throughout the group&#x27;s career, Broadrick continued to emphasise the defensive quality of the music over its offensive quality, citing aggression as a shield against the traumas of the world.

Broadrick has taken significant lyrical and thematic inspiration from Leonard Cohen. Both artists have an album titled &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot;, and the Godflesh track &quot;Avalanche Master Song&quot; combines two Cohen song titles. In the song &quot;Mothra&quot; (from &quot;Pure&quot;), Godflesh borrows the lyrics &quot;Your pain is no credential here / It&#x27;s just the shadow of my wound&quot; from the song &quot;Avalanche&quot; on the aforementioned Cohen album.

==Live performances==
Godflesh typically perform as a duo, with Green playing bass and Broadrick providing both guitar and vocals while the percussion is relayed over the speakers, often at a notably high volume. This lineup, however, has not been constant over the band&#x27;s career. In concerts supporting &quot;Streetcleaner&quot;, Neville occasionally came onstage and played second guitar, and Hampson did the same for &quot;Pure&quot;. For the tours in support of &quot;Selfless&quot;, &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot; and &quot;Hymns&quot;, the band played with a live drummer, though Broadrick believed this incorporation to be a misstep. In a 2014 interview, he clarified that the percussive additions of Mantia and Parsons brought &quot;something amazing&quot; to Godflesh, but that the band&#x27;s name should have changed so as to not dilute the original focus on machine drums. A handful of other musicians have briefly performed with Godflesh: Mick Harris in 1991; Diarmuid Dalton in 1997, 1999 and 2001; Steve Hough in 1997 and 1999 and both Paul Raven and Jaz Coleman of Killing Joke in 2002.

The band&#x27;s stage show is, like their music, minimal and focused. Godflesh only occasionally employ a smoke machine, and the lights are generally static; Toby Cook of &quot;The Quietus&quot; highlighted this unusual approach in a review of a 2014 concert, writing, &quot;Over-lit and with no dry ice in sight, they look alarmingly exposed&quot;. Images of industrial urban sprawls, Christian iconography and apocalyptic landscapes cycle through the projector. The music itself is presented as noisy and overwhelming, with some critics calling the sound even more cacophonous and dissonant than the band&#x27;s studio work. Gaps between songs are normally filled with feedback, and the band rarely speak to the crowd. In response to a question about Godflesh&#x27;s laconic stage presence, Broadrick said, &quot;I don&#x27;t communicate with people. We just make music. We come on stage and I don&#x27;t say anything to anyone. And that alone made people really mad. I find it really bizarre. I can&#x27;t believe that people would disown a band because I&#x27;m not telling them how much I&#x27;m going to kick their asses tonight.&quot;

In a 2011 interview, Broadrick called playing live &quot;a necessary evil&quot; that is &quot;so rarely right and so frequently wrong&quot;, but at the same time said that Godflesh &quot;is probably even more so a live band than it is a recorded band&quot; because those imperfections only work to accentuate the grinding chaos of the music (which is something that critics have noticed, too). Broadrick went on to say that it was the &quot;rage&quot; of Godflesh that made it work in a live setting.

<text>Ilha de Vera Cruz () (Portuguese for &quot;Island of the True Cross&quot;) was the first name given by the Portuguese navigators to the northeast coast of what later became Brazil. The name was later changed to Terra de Santa Cruz (&quot;Land of the Holy Cross&quot;).

When the Portuguese fleet, under Pedro Álvares Cabral, first officially touched land in South America on April 22, 1500, they thought they had found an island, as reflected in the chosen name. They took possession for the Kingdom of Portugal of what was believed to be an island of strategic importance on a western connection between Portugal and the Moluccas and other islands of the East Indies. This discovery marked the beginning of Portuguese colonization in South America. The name was changed to Terra de Santa Cruz when it was realized that it was not an island, but in fact part of a continent.

In 1534, the colonies of Terra de Santa Cruz became the Captaincies of Brazil, land grants to Portuguese captains General by King John III of Portugal.</text><links>

<text>The Comet tank or Tank, Cruiser, Comet I (A34) was a British cruiser tank that first saw use near the end of the Second World War, during the Western Allied invasion of Germany. The Comet was developed from the earlier Cromwell tank with a lower profile, partly-cast turret which mounted the new 77 mm HV gun. This was a smaller version of the 17 pdr anti-tank gun firing the same 76.2 mm (3&quot;) projectiles, albeit with a lighter charge, and was effective against late-war German tanks, including the Panther and Tiger.

The Comet rendered the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger obsolete and was an interim solution until the completely new design Centurion tank was available. When firing APDS rounds, the 77 mm HV was superior in armour penetration capability to the 75 mm KwK 42 gun of the equivalent Axis tank, the Panther.

The Comet entered active service in January 1945 and remained in British service until 1958. In some cases, Comets sold to other countries continued to operate into the 1980s.

==Design and development==
===Background===

Combat experience against the Germans in the Western Desert Campaign demonstrated to the British many shortcomings with their cruiser tanks. Hence a request was made in 1941 for a new heavy cruiser tank that could achieve battle superiority over German models. For reasons of economy and efficiency, it had to use as many components as possible from the current A15 Mk VI Crusader tank.

The initial designs for the new Cromwell tank evolved into the A24 Mk VII Cavalier tank and the A27L Mk VIII Centaur tank, both powered by the Nuffield Liberty. Design progressed through the Mk VII (A27M) Cromwell, a third parallel development to the Cavalier and Centaur, sharing many of the same characteristics.

Under the newer A27M specification, Cromwell integrated a number of advanced features. The Meteor engine proved to be very reliable and gave the tank good mobility but some problems appeared based on the vehicle&#x27;s shared heritage and significant jump in engine power. The tank was prone to throwing its tracks if track tension was not maintained properly or if it turned at too high a speed or too sharply. There were also some problems with suspension breakage, partly due to the Cromwell&#x27;s high speed and it ran through a number of design changes as a result.

The biggest complaint was related to firepower; the Cromwell had originally been designed to carry the 57 mm Ordnance QF 6-pounder, also retrofitted to the Crusader tanks. In combat, these were found to be useful against other tanks but lacking any reasonable high explosive load they were ineffective against anti-tank guns or static emplacements. Prior to the Cromwell entering combat service, the Ordnance QF 75 mm was introduced which equipped the majority of Cromwells, an adapted version of the 6-pounder firing shells from the US 75 mm gun from the Sherman. This offered somewhat lower anti-tank performance than the 6-pounder but its much larger shell provided an effective high explosive load.

Several attempts had been made to further improve firepower by fitting a more powerful gun. In parallel with development of the Cromwell and QF 75 mm gun, a new Vickers High Velocity 75 mm tank gun had been designed but this proved too large for the Cromwell turret ring and left a shortage in offensive anti-tank capability. A prior requirement for a 17-pounder armed tank led to development of the A30 Mk VIII Challenger. Based on the Cromwell, the hull had to be lengthened and a much larger turret set on top to allow a second loader for the 17-pounder, a requirement of the older specification believed necessary for the larger ammunition. The very high turret of the Challenger was considered a liability and this led to experiments with the similar A30 Avenger version, an anti-tank version with an open-top turret.

Conversion of Sherman tanks to the Sherman Firefly (a Sherman tank fitted with the 17-pounder gun) was significantly faster than Challenger production and driven by operational needs of the Normandy invasion, production of Challenger was dropped. Fireflies (and the limited number of Challengers) provided additional firepower to Cromwell and Sherman armed troops. One Firefly would be issued to each troop of Cromwells (giving three Cromwells and one Sherman Firefly). Problems were encountered due to the different maintenance requirements and associated supply complication of two tank models, as well as the performance difference between Cromwell and Sherman and the Sherman&#x27;s silhouette, even larger than the Challenger. The large size and obvious difference of both Challenger and Firefly made them a priority target for Axis forces.

Recognising that a common low profile vehicle was required to replace the mixed fleet of Cromwell, Challenger and Firefly tanks, a new specification of tank was created. This removed the Challenger&#x27;s need for a second loader and mounted the newer Vickers High Velocity weapon intended for the Cromwell.

===Tank, Cruiser, Comet l (A34)===
With the A34 (the General Staff specification), later named Comet, the tank designers opted to correct some of the Cromwell&#x27;s flaws in armament, track design and suspension while building upon its strengths of low height, high speed and mobility. This replaced the need for the Challenger and Firefly and acted upon the experiences gained through design and early deployment of the Cromwell.

Originally, it had been expected that the Cromwell would use the &quot;High Velocity 75 mm&quot; gun designed by Vickers but it would not fit into the turret. Development of the gun continued and as work commenced on the Comet, the gun design evolved into the 17 pdr HV (High Velocity). The gun now used the same calibre (76.2 mm) projectile as the 17-pounder but the cartridge case was from the older QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun loaded to higher pressures. The resulting round was different from 17-pounder ammunition, being shorter, more compact and more easily stored and handled within the tank. Testing on the range by 2nd Fife and Forfarshire Yeomanry as they converted from Shermans showed that the gun did not penetrate the front armour plate of a captured German Panther tank.

Several other improvements were made and many Cromwell design revisions were incorporated, such as safety hatches for the driver and hull gunner. The hull was fully welded as standard and armour was increased, ranging from 32 mm to 74 mm on the hull, while the turret was from 57 to 102 mm.

A new lower-profile welded turret was created using a cast gun mantlet for the 77 mm. The turret was electrically traversed (a design feature taken from the Churchill tank), with a generator powered by the main engine rather than the hydraulic system of the Cromwell. Ammunition for the 77 mm gun was stored in armoured bins.

The Comet&#x27;s suspension was strengthened, and track return rollers were added. As with later Cromwells, the Comet tank&#x27;s top speed was limited from the Cromwell&#x27;s 40+ mph to a slower, but respectable . This change preserved the lifespan of suspension and engine components and reduced track wear.

Similar to later Churchills, the Comet benefited from lessons learned in the co-operation of tanks with infantry. It was fitted as standard with two radio sets: a Wireless Set No. 19, for communication with the regiment and the troop, and a No. 38 Wireless for communication with infantry units. Like many British tanks, it also had a telephone handset mounted on the rear so that accompanying infantry could talk to the crew.

==Production==

Comet tanks were built by a number of British firms led by Leyland, including English Electric, John Fowler &amp; Co., and Metro-Cammell.

The mild steel prototype was ready in February 1944 and entered trials. Concerns about the hull gunner and belly armour were put to one side to avoid redesign, but there was still sufficient delay caused by minor modifications and changes. Production models did not commence delivery until September 1944. The Comet was intended to be in service by December 1944, but crew training was delayed by the German Ardennes Offensive. By the end of the war, 1,200 had been produced.

==Service history==
===Second World War===

The British 11th Armoured Division was the first formation to receive the new tanks, with deliveries commencing in December 1944 and the 29th Armoured Brigade, then equipped with Shermans, was withdrawn from fighting in the southern Netherlands early in the same month for re-equipping. After arriving in Brussels and preparing to hand in their Shermans the Ardennes Offensive commenced, and the brigade was forced to hastily take back its Shermans to take part in the countering of the German attack. The unit returned to the Brussels area in the middle of January 1945 three weeks later and finally paid-off its Shermans in exchange for Comets. The 11th Armoured Division would be the only division to be completely refitted with the Comet by the end of the war. The Comet saw combat and 26 were destroyed but due to its late arrival in the war in north west Europe, it did not participate in any large battles. The Comet was involved in the Operation Plunder crossing of the Rhine, and the later Berlin Victory Parade in July 1945.

===Postwar era===
In the post war era the Comet served alongside the heavier Centurion tank, a successor introduced in the closing days of the Second World War on an experimental basis but too late to see combat. The Comet remained in British service until 1958, when the remaining tanks were sold to foreign governments; up until the 1980s, it was used by the armies of various nations such as South Africa, which maintained several as modified recovery vehicles. Two examples were still being held in reserve by the South African Army as late as 2000.

Forty-one Comet Mk I Model Bs were also used by Finnish Defence Forces armoured brigade until 1970. The tanks were stored until 2007, when four of them were auctioned.

Four Comets were delivered to the Irish Army in 1959 and a further four in 1960. Severe budget cutbacks affected the service lives of the Comets, as not enough spares were purchased. The Comet appealed to the Irish Army as it was cheap to buy and run, had low ground pressure and good anti-tank capability. However, faulty fuzes meant the withdrawal of the HE ammunition, which limited the tank&#x27;s role to an anti-tank vehicle. With stocks of 77 mm ammunition dwindling in 1969, the army began an experiment to prolong the life of the vehicle. It involved replacing the turret with an open mounting with the Bofors 90 mm Pv-1110 recoilless rifle. The project was cancelled due to lack of funds. The last 77 mm Comet shoot was in 1973 with the tanks being withdrawn soon afterwards. One is preserved in the Irish Curragh Camp and two more survive in other barracks.

Cuba was an operator of the Comet tank; operating 15 purchased from the UK. In 1958, the USA began to cut off weapons sales to Cuba following the American government&#x27;s decision to stop Cuba from using its US-supplied armaments against pro-communist/socialist rebels throughout the country. The regime of Fulgencio Batista was forced to seek arms from other nations, which included the UK, which sold the Comet tanks from stocks (the government also allowed the purchase of 17 Hawker Sea Fury fighter aircraft from the manufacturer). The Comets arrived in Havana on 17 December 1958. After the collapse of the Batista regime on 1 January 1959, the new revolutionary government under Fidel Castro sought replacement parts and ammunition for their Comets from the British government, which having agreed to no further arms sales to Cuba in conjunction with the USA, refused. The few Comets in Cuba were soon retired from service and either scrapped or abandoned, being replaced with larger quantities of T-34/85 and T-54/55 tanks received from the Soviet Union.

Burma (&quot;Union of Burma&quot; it was then known; now Myanmar) was another user of the Comet tank, with around 25 bought from their former colonial rulers in between the late 1950s and the early 1960s. These took part in their Armed Forces Day held on 27 March 2021.

==Variants==

There were two Comet hull versions:

; Type A
: With the exhaust venting through the top rear of the vehicle engine deck similar to that of the Cromwell. These could be fitted with cowls to redirect exhaust fumes away from the air inlet vents. Cowls were usually split into two independent covers, as opposed to the single cover fitted to the Cromwell.

; Type B
: A post-war update with twin fishtail exhaust pipes exiting through holes in the rear-facing armoured plate. Cowls were no longer required. Early Type B Comets had armoured covers over the holes through which the fishtail exhaust pipes would protrude, retaining the older Model A setup.

Other vehicles that were based upon the Comet:

;Comet Crocodile
:One surviving photo shows a Comet Crocodile. This mounted a flamethrower and towed a fuel trailer similar to the Churchill Crocodile. Little is known about it.

;Comet 20pdr
:Finland tested a comet tank with new welded turret made by Lokomo and Army technical team, it was fitted with 84mm gun from charioteer tank. This prototype was however abandoned.

;Armoured Maintenance Vehicle
:The Comet was used by South Africa as the basis of a maintenance vehicle to support their Olifant Mk1A main battle tank (a variant of the Centurion). It had a crew of four and had a mass of 20 metric tons. It was powered by an AVI-1790-8 Continental, V12 90°, air cooled, fuel injection engine producing 615kW (852 hP), through an Allison CD 850 automatic three speed (low, high, reverse) transmission and had a maximum speed of 60 km/h. For its maintenance task it featured a welding machine, a hydrovane (high pressure air and water), a crane (1.5 to 6 metric tons), spare lubricants, 200l water, cutting facilities and carried a spare engine for the Olifant Mk1A. It was also fitted with six smoke grenade launchers (four rearward facing and four forward facing) for self defence.
;FV4401 Contentious
:The Comet was used as the basis for the experimental FV4401 Contentious, an air-transportable self-propelled anti-tank gun mounting a 105mm L7 gun in an open mounting on the shortened hull of a Comet, and using the vehicle&#x27;s hydraulic suspension system to adjust elevation, similar to the method used on the Swedish S-Tank. One or two prototypes were built and tested before the entire project was cancelled.

;COMRES 75
:COMRES 75 was an experimental tank built by FVRDE in 1968 that had an unmanned turret for an 84mm gun and autoloader, on a Comet chassis. It was sufficiently successful that the idea was considered during the initial stages of the Anglo-German Future Main Battle Tank programme.

== Survivors ==
Some surviving vehicles can be seen in a number of places including:

* The Curragh Museum, Irish Defence Forces, Ireland has a restored A34 in running condition.
* Curragh Camp, Irish Defence Forces, Ireland has two surviving A34&#x27;s on static display.
* Custume Barracks Athline, Irish Defence Forces, Ireland has one A34 as a static display. Formally located at Connolly Barracks in Longford.

<text>&#x27; (anglicized Gardariki or Gardarike) or &#x27; was the Old Norse term used in the Middle Ages for the lands of Rus&#x27;. According to &quot;Göngu-Hrólfs saga&quot;, the name  (also used as a name for Novgorodian Rus&#x27;) was synonymous with &quot;&quot;, and these names were used interchangeably in several other Old Norse stories.

As the Varangians dealt mainly with the northern lands of Rus&#x27;, their sagas regard the city of (usually identified with Novgorod) as the capital of . Other important places of mentioned in the sagas that have generally been identified with well known historical towns are (Ladoga), (Kiev), (Polotsk), (Smolensk), (Suzdal), (Murom), and (Rostov).

At least seven of the Varangian runestones, G 114, N 62, Sö 148, Sö 338, U 209, U 636, and Öl 28, refer to Scandinavian men who had been in .

==Etymology==

The word , which first appeared in Icelandic sagas in the twelfth century, could stem from the words and (an empire, realm, kingdom) according to the common Scandinavian pattern for state formations &quot;X+ríki&quot;. is the genitive form of , therefore the compound could be translated into English as &quot;the kingdom of Garðar&quot; or &quot;the empire of Garðar&quot;. The name itself was used in skaldic poems, runic inscriptions and early sagas up to the twelfth century to refer to the lands to the east of Scandinavia populated by the Rus&#x27; people, primarily to Novgorodian Rus&#x27;.

 is a plural form of the Old Norse word which referred to 1) a fence; 2) a fortification; 3) a yard; 4) a court; 5) a farm; 6) a village house, while the related Old Russian word &quot;городъ&quot; referred to 1) a fence; 2) a fortification; 3) a field defensive work; 4) a settlement. Since there is an overlapping meaning among the ones these related words once had (&quot;a fence, a fortified place&quot;), both &quot;garðr&quot; and &quot;городъ&quot; could mean the same at one time in the past. Thus, some researches interpreted as a collective name for Old Rus&#x27; towns encountered by Scandinavians on their way from Lyubsha and Ladoga down the Volkhov River into other Slavonic lands. The younger toponym could mean &quot;the realm of towns&quot;, or &quot;the country of towns&quot;.

<text>George Gipp (February 18, 1895 – December 14, 1920), nicknamed &quot;the Gipper&quot;, was an American college football player at the University of Notre Dame under head coach Knute Rockne. Gipp was selected as Notre Dame&#x27;s first Walter Camp All-American, and played several positions, particularly halfback, quarterback, and punter.

Gipp died at age 25 of a streptococcal throat infection and pneumonia, three weeks after a victory over Northwestern in his senior season, and was the subject of Rockne&#x27;s &quot;Win just one for the Gipper&quot; speech. In the 1940 film &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot;, he was portrayed by Ronald Reagan.

==College career==

Born and raised in Laurium, Michigan, on the Keweenaw Peninsula in the Upper Peninsula, Gipp entered Notre Dame intending to play baseball for the Fighting Irish. While on campus, he was recruited by Rockne for the football team, despite having no experience in organized football.

During his Notre Dame career, Gipp led the Irish in rushing and passing each of his last three seasons (1918, 1919, and 1920). His career mark of 2,341 rushing yards lasted over fifty years, until Jerome Heavens broke it Gipp was also an ideal handler of the forward and threw for 1,789 

He scored 21 career touchdowns, averaged 38 yards a punt, and gathered five interceptions as well as 14 yards per punt return and 22 yards per kick return in four seasons Gipp is still Notre Dame&#x27;s all-time leader in average yards per rush for a season (8.1), career average yards per play of total offense (9.37), and career average yards per game of total offense (128.4).

==Death==

Gipp died December 14, 1920, two weeks after being elected Notre Dame&#x27;s first All-American by Walter Camp, and second consensus All-American (after Gus Dorais).

A frequently told but probably apocryphal story of Gipp&#x27;s death begins when he returned to Notre Dame&#x27;s campus after curfew from a night out. Unable to gain entrance to his residence, Gipp went to the rear door of Washington Hall, the campus&#x27; theatre building. He was a steward for the building and knew the rear door was often unlocked. He usually spent such nights in the hall. On that night, however, the door was locked, and Gipp was forced to sleep outside. By the morning, he had contracted pneumonia and eventually died from a related infection. 

It is more likely that Gipp contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game, November 20 against Northwestern. Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited.

Gipp&#x27;s hometown of Laurium built a memorial in his honor; he is buried in Lake View Cemetery near West Tamarack, Michigan. 

==&quot;Win just one for the Gipper&quot;==

It was on his hospital bed that he is said to have delivered the &quot;win just one for the Gipper&quot; line. He apparently said this to the full quotation from which the line is derived is:
:&quot;I&#x27;ve got to go, Rock. It&#x27;s all right. I&#x27;m not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, ask them to go in there with all they&#x27;ve got and win just one for the Gipper. I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;ll be then, Rock. But I&#x27;ll know about it, and I&#x27;ll be happy.&quot;
Rockne used the story of Gipp, along with this deathbed line that he attributed to Gipp, to rally his team to a upset of the previously undefeated Army team in 1928, with Jack Chevigny scoring the &quot;that&#x27;s one for the Gipper&quot; tying touchdown at Yankee Stadium.

The phrase &quot;Win one for the Gipper&quot; was later used as a political slogan by Ronald Reagan, who in 1940 portrayed Gipp in &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot; and was often referred to as &quot;The Gipper&quot;. At the Republican National Convention in 1988 in New Orleans, he told Vice President Bush, &quot;George, go out there and win one for the Gipper.&quot; The term was also used by President George W. Bush at the 2004 convention in New York City, when he honored the recently deceased President Reagan by stating, &quot;this time we can truly win one for the Gipper.&quot; The Republicans won both presidential elections.

==Exhumation==

On October 4, 2007, Gipp&#x27;s body was exhumed for DNA testing to determine if he had fathered a child out of wedlock with an 18-year-old high school student. The right femur was removed and the rest of the remains were reburied the same day. A sports author who was present at the exhumation said it was requested by Rick Frueh, the grandson of one of Gipp&#x27;s sisters.

The tests showed that he was not the father of the child who was born within days of Gipp&#x27;s Other Gipp relatives claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the exhumation was conducted in an improper manner and under questionable circumstances. The lawsuit was subsequently

<doc id="650276" wikidata="Q131177" url="?curid=650276" title="Supersaurus">
<text>Supersaurus (meaning &quot;super lizard&quot;) is a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Late Jurassic period. The type species, &quot;S. vivianae&quot;, was first discovered by Vivian Jones of Delta, Colorado, in the middle Morrison Formation of Colorado in 1972. The fossil remains came from the Brushy Basin Member of the formation, dating between 153 and 145 million years ago. It is among the longest dinosaurs ever discovered, with the three known specimens reaching in length, with the largest individual possibly exceeding in size. Mass estimates for the WDC and BYU specimens tend to be around in body mass. A potential second species, &quot;S. lourinhanensis&quot; (&quot;Dinheirosaurus&quot;), is known from Portugal and has been dated to a similar time.

==Discovery==
&quot;Supersaurus&quot; is present in stratigraphic zone 5 of the Morrison, dating from the Tithonian. The original fossil remains of &quot;Supersaurus&quot; were discovered in the Dry Mesa Quarry in 1972. This find yielded only a few bones: mainly the shoulder girdle, an ischium, and tail vertebrae. Paleontologist James A. Jensen described &quot;Supersaurus&quot;; he designated a scapulocoracoid BYU 9025 (originally labeled as BYU 5500) as the type specimen. This shoulder girdle stood some tall, if placed on end. The specimen was given the name &quot;Supersaurus&quot; informally as early as 1973, but was not officially described and named until more than a decade later, in 1985. Sauropod researcher Jack McIntosh at one time thought that the BYU &quot;Supersaurus&quot; material might represent a large species of &quot;Barosaurus&quot; but later felt that there was evidence for &quot;Supersaurus&quot; being a valid genus.

A much more complete specimen WDC DMJ-021, was found in Converse County, Wyoming in 1986 by Brandon Flyr and Bart Lesco while out hiking and was reported to the people who owned the land at the time. The discovery was later named &quot;Jimbo&quot; in 1996 by the family that purchased the land, it was described and assigned to &quot;Supersaurus&quot; in 2007. The specimen represented approximately 30% of the skeleton. Its bones are being held at the Wyoming Dinosaur Center. A comparison of WDC DMJ-021 and other specimens previously assigned to &quot;Supersaurus&quot; was done in order to help decide what material from the Dry Mesa Quarry belonged to the genus. It indicated that a series of tail vertebrae and an ulna may have belonged to some other diplodocid.

===Ultrasauros===

Jensen, who described the original &quot;Supersaurus&quot; specimen, simultaneously reported the discovery of another gigantic sauropod, which would later be named &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot; &quot;macintoshi&quot; (later renamed &quot;Ultrasauros macintoshi&quot;). The type specimen (the specimen used to define a new species) of &quot;Ultrasauros&quot;, being a backbone (dorsal vertebra, labeled BYU 9044), was later found to have come from &quot;Supersaurus&quot;. In fact, it probably belonged to the original &quot;Supersaurus&quot; specimen, which was discovered in the same quarry in 1972. Therefore, &quot;Ultrasauros&quot; became a junior synonym of &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, which had been named first and thus retains priority, and the name &quot;Ultrasauros&quot; was abandoned.

Other bones that were found at the same location and originally thought to belong to &quot;Ultrasauros&quot;, like a shoulder girdle (scapulocoracoid, BYU 9462), actually belonged to &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, possibly a large specimen of &quot;Brachiosaurus altithorax&quot;. The &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; bones indicate a large, but not record-breaking individual, a little larger than the &quot;&quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; brancai&quot; (&quot;Giraffatitan brancai&quot;) mount in the Berlin&#x27;s Natural History Museum.

Originally, these &quot;Supersaurus&quot; and &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; bones were believed to represent a single dinosaur that was estimated to reach about long, high at the shoulder, in total height, and weighing maybe . At the time, mass estimates ranged up to 180 tons, which placed it in the same category as the blue whale and the equally problematic &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot;.

The naming of the chimeric &quot;Ultrasauros&quot; has a similarly complicated history. &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot; (with the final &quot;u&quot;) was the original choice, and was widely used by the media after the discovery in 1979. However, the name of a new species must be published with a description to become official.

Before Jim Jensen published his discovery in 1985, another paleontologist, Kim Haang Mook, used the name &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot; in a 1983 publication to describe what he believed was a giant dinosaur in South Korea. This was a different, much smaller dinosaur than Jensen&#x27;s find, but Kim thought it represented a similarly gigantic animal because he confused a humerus for an ulna. While the logic of naming was incorrect, the &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot; from Kim&#x27;s find fulfilled the requirements for naming and became regarded as a legitimate, if dubious genus. Thus, because Jensen did not publish his own &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot; find until 1985, Kim&#x27;s use retained its official priority of name, and Jensen was forced to choose a new name (in technical terms, his original choice was &quot;preoccupied&quot; by Kim&#x27;s sauropod). In 1991, at his suggestion, George Olshevsky changed one letter, and renamed Jensen&#x27;s sauropod &quot;Ultrasauros&quot;, with the final &quot;o&quot;.

When it was later discovered that the new name referred to bones from two separate, and already known species, the name &quot;Ultrasauros&quot; was considered invalid and became a junior synonym for &quot;Supersaurus&quot;. Since the holotype of the &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot; was a dorsal vertebrae of the &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, so &quot;Ultrasauros&quot; is not a junior synonym for &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;. The name &quot;Supersaurus&quot; was kept instead of &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot; as the animal is a diplodocid and &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot; had always referred to a brachiosaurid.

===Additional synonyms===
Another diplodocid dinosaur found near the original &quot;Supersaurus&quot; quarry, known from a backbone (dorsal vertebra type specimen BYU 5750), was named Dystylosaurus edwini and is now also considered to be a specimen of &quot;Supersaurus vivianae&quot;. Hence, &quot;Dystylosaurus&quot; has also become a junior synonym of &quot;Supersaurus&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Supersaurus&quot; is among the largest dinosaurs known from good remains and quite possibly the longest discovered thus far, with the WDC specimen reaching in length, the BYU specimen reaching perhaps and a third specimen potentially exceeding in size. The WDC and BYU specimens are estimated to have weighed in body mass. 
A study in 2024 also found the Jimbo specimen to be skeletally mature at the time of its death and among the oldest known dinosaurs. While the result obtained was 225 years, the study strongly states that a value this high is extremely unlikely and more reflects the limitations of the methodology in calculating the age of exceptionally old individuals. The same study found the age of a &quot;Diplodocus hallorum&quot; to be 60 years old, which makes it among the oldest known dinosaurs too, but considered the age of Jimbo to be even greater due to the extensive remodeling of the bone. In fact, the study suggests Jimbo was so old that its exact age cannot be reliably calculated by the applied methodology. Thus, despite the lack of a truly reliable age value, the Jimbo specimen of &quot;Supersaurus&quot; can be considered as possibly the oldest dinosaur known thus far. The study also suggests that, due to Jimbo&#x27;s skeletal maturity, the size range displayed by the three known &quot;Supersaurus&quot; specimens, which ranges from , can be considered an average adult size for the species.

The first described specimens of &quot;Supersaurus&quot; were individual bones that suggested a large diplodocid. A large cervical vertebra BYU 9024 from the same quarry was later assigned to &quot;Supersaurus&quot;.. This vertebra measures in length and is the longest cervical known. This enormous vertebra was reclassified as a &quot;Barosaurus&quot; vertebra, by Mike Taylor and Matt Wedel. However Brian Curtice has reassigned it to &quot;Supersaurus&quot; on the basis of additional specimens. Michael Benton also agreed with the reclassification, giving the &quot;Supersaurus&quot; BYU 9024 specimen an approximate length of up to an impressive , which would have made it the longest animal to ever live.

The assignment of the more complete specimen, WDC DMJ-021, to &quot;Supersaurus&quot; suggests that in most respects it was very similar in anatomy to &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; but less robustly built with especially elongated cervical vertebrae, resulting in one of the longest-known sauropod necks.

==Classification==

Most studies of diplodocid relationships have found it to contain two primary subgroups: Diplodocinae (containing those diplodocids more closely related to &quot;Diplodocus&quot; than to &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;) and Apatosaurinae (diplodocids more closely related to &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; than to &quot;Diplodocus&quot;). Originally, it was thought that &quot;Supersaurus&quot; was related to the long-necked diplodocid &quot;Barosaurus&quot;, and therefore a member of the subfamily Diplodocinae, however, with the assignment of the more complete WDC DMJ-021 most later studies found &quot;Supersaurus&quot; to be a close relative of the familiar &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; in the group Apatosaurinae. However, some later studies cast doubt on this paradigm. One comprehensive study of diplodocoid relationships published by Whitlock in 2011 found &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; itself to lie at the base of the diplodocid family tree, and other &quot;apatosaurines&quot;, including &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, to be progressively more closely related to &quot;Diplodocus&quot; (making them diplodocines).

In 2015, a specimen-level phylogenetic study of diplodocids found that &quot;Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis&quot; grouped with &quot;Supersaurus&quot;. The study considered that it should be a new species of &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, in a new combination &quot;S. lourinhanensis&quot;.

<text>The Department of Veterans Affairs Act of 1988 () changed the former Veterans Administration, an independent government agency established in 1930, primarily at that time to see to needs of World War I, into a Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs. It was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on October 25, 1988, but actually came into effect under the term of his successor, George H. W. Bush, on March 15, 1989.

This bill passed into law over the objection of some of President Reagan&#x27;s fellow Republicans, who were committed to preventing the U.S. federal government from expanding further. Many Republicans along with most Democrats ultimately supported it on the basis that it was really more of a reorganization than an expansion of government as the new department was in reality going to be doing very few things that the former Veterans Administration had not already been doing. There was the further consideration that military veterans constitute a large and powerful voting bloc and could easily be offended at the perceived slight that opposition to the bill might have implied.

<doc id="650291" wikidata="Q131038" url="?curid=650291" title="Mamenchisaurus">
<text>Mamenchisaurus ( , Dinosauria Translation and Pronunciation Guide M or spelling pronunciation ) is a genus of sauropod dinosaur known for their remarkably long necks which made up nearly half the total body length. Numerous species have been assigned to the genus; however, the validity of these assignments has been questioned. Fossils have been found in the Sichuan Basin and Yunnan Province in China. Several species from the Upper Shaximiao Formation, whose geologic age is uncertain, have been described. However, evidence suggests this formation to be no earlier than the Oxfordian stage of the Late Jurassic. &quot;M. sinocanadorum&quot; dates to the Oxfordian stage (158.7 to 161.2 mya), and &quot;M. anyuensis&quot; to the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous (around 114.4 mya). Most species were medium-large to large sauropods, measuring roughly in length—possibly up to , based on two undescribed vertebrae.

==History and species==
&quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; was first discovered in 1952 on the construction site of the Yitang Highway in Sichuan Province of China. The fossil site belonged to the Upper Shaximiao Formation, dating to at least the Late Jurassic. The partial skeleton fossil was later studied and named &quot;Mamenchisaurus constructus&quot; in 1954 by the renowned Chinese paleontologist Professor C. C. Young.

The type specimen (IVPP V. 790) was fragmentary, disordered, and not excavated in a technical way. Material included five dorsal vertebrae, 30 caudal vertebrae, rib fragments, dorsal neural spines, and chevrons. Fourteen neck vertebrae were preserved, but none were complete. Young noted that some neck vertebrae might have been missing. Limb material included; two pieces of a femur, a complete tibia, fibula, astragalus, metatarsals, phalanges, and claws. The skull, forelimbs, and pelvic girdle were missing. 

&quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; means &#x27;Mamenchi lizard&#x27;, from the Chinese Pinyin &quot;mǎ&quot; (马 &#x27;horse&#x27;) and &quot;mén&quot; (门 &#x27;gate&#x27;), while &quot;chi&quot; is an alternative transliteration of &quot;xī&quot; (溪 &#x27;stream&#x27; or &#x27;brook&#x27;), combined with the suffix &quot;-saurus&quot; (from Greek &quot;sauros&quot; meaning &#x27;lizard&#x27;). The intention was to name the genus after the place where its fossil was first found. However, due to an accentual mix-up by Young, the location name &quot;Mǎmíngxī&quot; (马鸣溪 &#x27;horse-neighing brook&#x27;) was mistaken as &quot;Mǎménxī&quot; (马门溪 &#x27;horse-gate brook&#x27;). The fact that the first &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; fossil was found due to construction work led to Young&#x27;s naming the type species as &quot;Mamenchisaurus constructus&quot;.

In 1958, Young described additional sauropod remains collected from Gansu Province. The remains consisted of various partial specimens (IVPP V. 945, V. 946, V. 947, V. 948) most of which were assigned to &quot;M. constructus.&quot; In 1972, one of these specimens was reassigned to &quot;M. hochuanensis.&quot;

=== &quot;Mamenchisaurus hochuanensis&quot; ===

In 1972, Young and Xijin Zhao described a second species, &quot;Mamenchisaurus hochuanensis&quot;. The fossils were found near a village in Hechuan, north of Chongqing (originally part of the Sichuan Province), China; above the Fu River on the slope of a mountain. The &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot; fossil site also belonged to the Upper Shaximiao Formation, very close to the &quot;M. constructus&quot; type specimen&#x27;s location, dating to at least the Late Jurassic. Locals first discovered the remains sometime before the Chinese Revolution. However, the remains were ultimately abandoned and left to weather in situ. Excavation did not begin on the site until 1957.

The holotype specimen (CCG V 20401) consisted of an almost complete and articulated vertebral column; including 19 elongated cervical vertebrae, which were almost entirely preserved, 12 dorsal vertebrae, four sacral vertebrae, and 35 caudal vertebrae with only the last several missing. Also missing from the skeleton was the majority of the forelimbs and skull. When &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot; was first described, it was the largest sauropod known from China.

In 1958, Young described a mamenchisaur specimen (IVPP V. 946) from the Haishiwan region of Yongdeng, Gansu Province. This specimen was initially assigned to &quot;M. constructus&quot;. However, in 1972 it was reassigned to &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot; as a paratype. This specimen was slightly smaller than the holotype and consisted of less material overall. However, it contained some anatomical details missing in the type specimen.

In 2001, another specimen (ZDM0126) was described and referred to &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot;. It was found in 1995 at a construction site in Huidong New District, Zigong City, Sichuan Province. This specimen was nearly complete and mostly articulated, preserving features missing from the holotype, such as the skull, pectoral girdle and forelimb material. However, a 2020 phylogenetic analysis by Moore and colleagues cast doubt on the referral of this specimen to &quot;M. hochuanensis.&quot;

=== &quot;Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum&quot; ===

In August 1987, a cervical rib was seen projecting out of a cliff by Z-M. Dong on an expedition by the China-Canada Dinosaur Project. The fossil site was located in the Junggar Basin, Xinjiang; from the upper part of the Shishugou Formation, making it one of the few mamenchisaurs known from outside the Sichuan basin; the locality is thought to date to around 162.2 million years ago. The location of the quarry the specimen was found in was originally reported as being north of an abandoned town, Jiangjunmiao. However, the original authors reported incorrect coordinates for the quarry that were later corrected by a subsequent study. The coarse and weak sandstone the specimen was preserved in, alongside the large and fragile nature of the bones, impeded excavation, leading to only the most anterior vertebrae being recovered despite more neck material being present. The specimen was named as a new species of &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot;, coined &quot;M. sinocanadorum&quot;, in 1993 by Dale Russell and Zhong Zheng. The specific name refers to the China-Canada Dinosaur Project. 

Overall, the specimen, IVPP V10603, consists of a complete left , a right , a , a right , a possible , a right , portions of the second through fourth , and an intact left . The neural arches of the vertebrae were well fused to the centra suggesting that the animal was mature. The authors noted that the teeth are fully erupted but unworn, possibly suggesting the animal starved. Due to the limited amount of bone at the cliff base, the authors proposed that the cervical vertebrae broke away before full decomposition. The head and part of the neck then drifted downstream until they came to rest in shallow water on a point bar and eventually buried. In 2023, &quot;M. sinocanadorum&quot; was redescribed by Andrew Moore and colleagues. The authors could not locate the vomer, right pterygoid, the possible ectopterygoid, the right quadrate, and the right dentary for restudy. A phylogenetic analysis performed by the authors found it to be outside the clade of other &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; species, closely allied to &quot;Xinjiangtitan&quot;, but refrained from taxonomic action until the type species &quot;M. constructus&quot; received re-evaluation.

Two large cervical vertebrae found from the same formation as &quot;M. sinocanadorum&quot; were informally referred to the species by Gregory S. Paul in 2019 based on their large sizes and origin. However, these vertebrae have yet to be formally described. Paul has suggested these may represent one of the largest dinosaurs known. Moore and colleagues could not support the referral of these vertebrae to &quot;M. sinocanadorum&quot; in their redescription of the species because the vertebrae lack anatomical overlap with the known material of the type specimen, and so cannot be compared for diagnosis. They also noted an undescribed specimen on display at the China University of the Geosciences in Beijing labelled as belonging to the species which has not been evaluated firsthand or mentioned in the scientific literature. Accordingly, they consider the referral to the species premature.

=== &quot;Mamenchisaurus anyuensis&quot; ===
&quot;M. anyuensis&quot; was described in 1996 by Xinlu He and colleagues. The remains were discovered in 1987 from two locations near the town of Longchiaoxiang in the Sichuan Basin. At one quarry, at least five to six individuals were found. At a second quarry, four individuals were found. One of these became the holotype, AL001, representing two-thirds of an articulated skeleton. Other specimens were also reported, AL002, AL003, and AL101-106, which provide more skeletal information. The species name references Anyue County where it was discovered. &quot;M. anyuensis&quot; is known from both the top of the Suining Formation and the bottom of the Penglaizhen Formation. Uranium–lead dating places &quot;M. anyuensis&quot; in the Suining Formation at 114.4 Ma in age; as this would make it roughly 30 million years younger than the other &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; species, it is unlikely that &quot;M. anyuensis&quot; is actually a member of the genus.

The holotype specimen preserved eight posterior cervical vertebrae, twelve dorsal vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae, several caudal vertebrae, and a complete pelvis. Another specimen (AL102) preserved five articulated cervical vertebrae from the middle of the neck. Except for the digit bones, the forelimb is completely known and represented by multiple individuals.
=== &quot;Mamenchisaurus youngi&quot; ===
Also described in 1996 was &quot;Mamenchisaurus youngi&quot; from the Upper Shaximiao Formation. A local quarrying stone near a village in Zigong, Sichuan Province, found the remains in 1987. The species was named in honour of C. C. Young.

The holotype specimen (ZDM 0083) was very complete and mostly articulated, preserving all the vertebrae from the head down to the 8th tail vertebra. Also preserved were the pectoral girdle, pelvic girdle, and material from all four limbs. This specimen also preserved a nearly complete skull.

=== &quot;Mamenchisaurus jingyanensis&quot; ===
&quot;M. jingyanensis&quot; was described in 1998 by Yihong Zhang, Kui Li, and Qinghua Zeng. The type specimen (CV00734) was located away from the administrative headquarters of the town of Meiwang, Jingyan county. Another specimen (JV002) was found in the village of Sanjiang approximately from Meiwang and became the paratype. A third specimen (CV00219) found near the village of Dujia, about 10 kilometers from Sanjiang. The fossils were located in the Sichuan basin, from the Upper Shaximiao Formation. The species name refers to Jingyan County from which the majority of specimens were excavated.

The type specimen includes a partial scapula and complete coracoid, forelimb material, a complete ischium, a relatively complete skull, and a hyoid bone. The paratype specimen included three anterior cervical vertebrae, several weathered dorsal vertebrae, various caudal vertebrae including a nearly articulated column, relatively complete hind and forelimbs, and isolated teeth. The third specimen preserved a column of cervical vertebrae with articulated ribs, four fused sacral vertebrae, several caudal vertebrae, a complete scapulocoracoid, various limb bones, and isolated teeth.

=== Other &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; species and material ===
Other species of &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; have been named over the years. In some cases, species from other genera have been transferred to &quot;Mamenchisaurus,&quot; but there is disagreement with the referral&#x27;s validity&quot;.&quot; Some of these species are based on fragmentary remains and have been considered undiagnostic. Others are considered as invalid or as &quot;nomina nuda&quot;.

In 1976, Hou, Chao and Chu named a new genus, &quot;Zigongosaurus fuxiensis.&quot; Known from at least four specimens from the Upper Shaximiao Formation. The type specimen (CV 02501) included skull material; maxilla, dentary, and basioccipital. Additional material includes dorsal vertebrae, pubis, and ischium. Since &quot;Zigongosaurus&quot; was described, other researchers have disagreed on whether the genus is valid. In 1983, Dong, Zhou and Zhang assigned some of the remains to the similarly named &quot;Omeisaurus fuxiensis&quot;, and the rest to &quot;Omeisaurus junghsiensis&quot;. Zhang and Chen assigned the remains to &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; as &quot;M. fuxiensis&quot; in 1996. Li and Cai considered it a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; in 1997. In 1999, Valérie Martin-Rolland considered &quot;Zigongosaurus&quot; a valid genus. Wang and colleagues considered it undiagnostic in 2019.

Another species, &quot;Mamenchisaurus guangyuanensis&quot;, has not been formally described, making it a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;. It is known from the remains of several individuals, ranging from juvenile to adult, from the Upper Shaximiao Formation. The largest individuals were estimated to have a length of It was originally described by Zhang Suping in her 1981 thesis as &quot;Omeisaurus guangyuanensis&quot;, but in 1997, Li and Cai listed it as a species of &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot;. Like &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot;, but unlike &quot;Omeisaurus&quot;, it shows bifurcated neural spines and procoelous caudal vertebrae. It was considered non-diagnostic by Wang and colleagues in 2019.

&quot;M. yunnanensis was&quot; described by Fang and colleagues in 2004, from the Anning Formation in the Sichuan Basin, Yunnan. The type specimen consisted of disarticulated forelimb, hindlimb, and pelvic material. Wang and colleagues questioned the assignment to &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; in 2019.

In 1988, He and colleagues considered &quot;Omeisaurus changshouensis&quot; to be closer to &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; based on features of the caudal vertebrae. In 2019, Tan and colleagues agreed with this assessment. In 1996, Zhang and Chen considered &quot;Omeisaurus changshouensis&quot; and &quot;Omeisaurus gongjianensis&quot; as referrable to &quot;Mamenchisaurus.&quot; However, in 2004, Upchurch considered &quot;O. changshouensis&quot; undiagnosable.

In 1978, an incomplete sauropod humerus (NSM PV17656) found in a layer of the Early Cretaceous-aged Miyako Group of Japan was considered to probably belong to &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot;. In 1991, it was referred to &quot;?Mamenchisaurus sp&quot;. by Hasegawa and colleagues&quot;.&quot; However, the humerus was reassessed by Azuma &amp; Tomida in 1998, and Barrett and colleagues in 2002. These authors could not find any distinguishing features that could place the humerus into a specific sauropod group. They regarded it as an indeterminate sauropod. The remains were given an informal name &quot;Moshi-ryu&quot;; &quot;Moshi&quot; being the local name for the location it was discovered, and &quot;ryu&quot; being Japanese for dragon—also referred to as &quot;Moshisaurus&quot;.

== Description ==
There is uncertainty that all the species assigned to &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; should belong to the genus. Some &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; species are almost completely known, and others are fragmentary. The species differ in overall size and specific features of the skull and skeleton but share typical sauropod traits, like quadrupedalism, large bodies, small heads, and long tails. The most distinctive feature of mamenchisaurids is their exceptionally long necks which approach half their total length. The type specimens of &quot;M. youngi and M. hochuanensis&quot; preserve complete necks, which consist of 18 and 19 vertebrae, respectively. &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; cervical vertebrae are elongated, lightly constructed and highly pneumatic. The neural spines on their posterior cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae are bifurcated. Their shoulders were somewhat higher than the hips.

The type species, &quot;M. constructus,&quot; is not particularly well preserved but has been estimated to be around in length with a mass of around . The neck of the type specimen was not completely preserved, but Young estimated the whole neck at .

The overall length of the &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot; type specimen is around with a neck long. Young and Zhao estimated the mass of &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot; at . However, later volumetric mass estimates are lower at . In 1972, Young and Chao described &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot; as having 19 cervical and 12 dorsal vertebrae. However, Paul Upchurch and colleagues suggested this vertebral count may be incorrect. The authors noted that the vertebra that is usually referred to as the second dorsal possessed a hyposphene, a feature not usually seen until the third or fourth dorsal in sauropods. They provisionally proposed that the actual vertebral count might be 18 cervicals and 13 dorsals in &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot;. 

&quot;M. sinocanadorum&quot; is known from fragmentary remains, but these suggest that it was a large species. The cervical vertebrae are on average 1.19 times longer than those of &quot;M. hochuanensis;&quot; based on this, Russel and Zheng estimated the type specimen at in length. Taylor and Wedel estimated the neck around in length based on comparison to &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot;. However, the 2023 redescription gave a longer estimate between and based on comparison to &quot;Xinjiangtitan&quot;, though the authors stressed the level of uncertainty. The type specimen possessed the longest cervical rib of any described sauropod dinosaur, measuring . For comparison, a &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; cervical rib measures . Based on CT imaging, Moore and colleagues estimated the cervical vertebrae of &quot;M. sinocandorum&quot; to be 69–77% air by volume, assuming complete removal of bone marrow. The mandible was in length and had 19 teeth. In contrast to the more squared-off jaws of diplodocids, the front of the mandibles met at an oblique angle. Two as-yet-undescribed cervical vertebrae possibly suggest one of the largest dinosaurs known. Gregory S. Paul suggested that these might belong to &quot;M. sinocanadorum&quot; and estimated a length and possibly weighing . However, the referral of these vertebrae to &quot;M. sinocanadorum&quot; has been questioned.

&quot;M. anyuensis&quot; shares morphological similarities to &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot;. He and colleagues estimated the length of this species at . Paul estimated it longer at with a mass of .

&quot;M. youngi&quot; is one of the smaller species of &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; and known from relatively complete remains&quot;.&quot; The type specimen was around long with a neck. The mass of &quot;M. youngi&quot; was estimated at using volumetric techniques. The holotype specimen preserves a nearly complete skull. There were four teeth in the premaxilla, 18 in the maxilla, and 22 to 24 in the dentary. An unusual part of the skeleton is the wedge-shaped sacrum; this causes the sacrum and the base of the tail to pitch up relative to the rest of the vertebral column.

&quot;M. jingyanensis&quot; was estimated by Zhang and colleagues to be between in length. Paul estimated it at with a mass of . The skull was restored at in length. There were four teeth in the premaxilla, 14–16 in the maxilla, and 17–19 in the dentary.

&quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; have forked chevrons (or sled chevrons) starting around the middle of the tail, similar to those seen in diplodocids; these chevrons curve strongly backwards and add a forward projection. Paul has argued that these types of chevrons are adaptations linked to rearing behaviour. In a tripodal stance, the tail acts as a prop, and the forked chevrons would help distribute the weight evenly. Paul also notes that the pelvises of Mamenchisaurs are retroverted (tilted), which may have allowed slow walking whilst bipedal.

ZDM0126, a specimen possibly referable to &quot;M. hochuanensis,&quot; possessed four fused caudal vertebrae near the tip of the tail. These vertebrae have expanded neural arches and taller neural spines, possibly representing a tail club. A study by Lida Xing and colleagues performed a finite element analysis on the club. The authors concluded that the club would have a limited ability to perform as a defensive weapon but might have also functioned as a sensory organ. Other Chinese sauropods, &quot;Shunosaurus&quot; and &quot;Omeisaurus,&quot; are also known to have had tail clubs, but they differ in shape to that of ZDM0126.

The neck posture and feeding strategies of sauropod dinosaurs is a controversial topic. Andreas Christian and colleagues analysed the neck of &quot;M. youngi&quot; and found that when articulated in a neutral posture, the neck was almost straight, with a slight upward bend at the base and a slight downward bend towards the head. The base of the neck has comparatively high upward flexibility but limited downward flexibility. The region near the head had better downward flexibility and low upward flexibility. In the mid-region, downward flexibility was high, which led the authors to conclude that &quot;M. youngi&quot; frequently fed at low levels. Long overlapping cervical ribs may have limited flexibility. The authors also estimated the stress on the intervertebral joint cartilage. Their results suggest the neck was kept mostly straight, with the possible exception of the neck base and near the head.

A large ulna (GPIT SGP 2006/10) measuring less than in length, referred to &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; sp. from the Shishugou Formation, was used in a bone histology analysis. By sectioning the bone and counting the growth rings, the age at death was estimated at 43 years.

== Classification ==
&quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; is sometimes referred to as a &#x27;wastebasket taxon&#x27;, with researchers questioning the number of species and fragmentary remains assigned to the genus. The genus is poorly defined with an increasingly confused taxonomy which makes understanding phylogenetic relationships difficult. Several analyses have failed to show &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; as monophyletic, suggesting the need to revise the genus. Additional research on the type species, &quot;M. constructus,&quot; is required to better understand the genus.

When &quot;M. constructus&quot; was first described, Young noted that the chevron bones indicated an affinity with Diplodocidae, but was uncertain to its exact position. In 1958, Young assigned &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; to the Titanosauridae. With the description of &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot;, Young and Zhao created the family Mamenchisauridae in 1972. In 1978, when no &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; skulls were known, Berman and McIntosh assigned the genus to Diplodocidae based on diplodocid-like vertebral features such as the forked chevrons. In 1990, McIntosh assigned &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; to a subfamily Mamenchisaurinae, which was placed inside Diplodocidae.

An analysis by Upchurch in 1995 found &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; in the family Euhelopodidae. Euhelopodidae, being named first, would take priority over Mamenchisauridae. Several later analyses found &quot;Euhelopus&quot; to be a more distantly related macronarian, with &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; in Mamenchisauridae just outside of Neosauropoda.

Analyses by Sekiya in 2011 and Moore and colleagues in 2020 treated &quot;M. constructus, M. hochuanensis,&quot; ZDM 0126 &quot;(M. hochuanensis&quot; referred&quot;), M. sinocandadorum, and M. youngi&quot; separately. Moore and colleagues analyses found the position of &quot;M. constructus&quot; to be unstable, probably due to the limited character information in its description. Depending on the dataset used, &quot;Euhelopus&quot; would either be within Macronaria, as other studies have found or outside Neosauropoda in a more traditional position, grouped with other &quot;Mamenchisaurus-&quot;like taxa. The latter scenario would make mamenchisaurids members of Euhelopodidae. The analyses of Sekiya (2011) and Moore and colleagues (2020) did not recover ZDM 0126 as a sister taxon to the holotype of &quot;M. hochuanensis,&quot; questioning its referral to the species.

The cladogram below shows a possible phylogenetic position of the genus within Sauropoda, from Allain and Aquesbi, 2008:

Below, two phylogenetic trees show the internal relationships of Euhelopodidae/Mamenchisauridae in the two analyses Moore and colleagues deemed most favorable, the implied-weights and Bayesian analyses of the Gonzàlez Riga dataset.

Topology A: Implied-weights analysis, Gonzàlez Riga dataset
Topology B: Time-calibrated Bayesian analysis, Gonzàlez Riga dataset
The 2023 redescription of &quot;M. sinocanadorum&quot; found a consistent sister taxon relationship between it and &quot;Xinjiangtitan&quot;, with &quot;Hudiesaurus&quot; and referred material of &quot;M. hochuanensis&quot; (ZDM 0126) also found to be consistent relatives.

== Paleochronology ==
&quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; was originally thought to have ranged from the Middle to Late Jurassic. However, there is not reliable dating for the Upper Shaximiao Formation, where many of the &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; species are found.

A study published in 2018 used uranium–lead dating on the underlying &quot;Omeisaurus&quot; bearing beds of the Lower Shaximiao Formation, previously thought to belong to the Middle Jurassic. However, the radiometric dating found the Lower Shaximiao Formation dated to the Late Jurassic, Oxfordian Stage, around 159 million years ago (mya). This finding suggests a younger age for the overlying &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; bearing rocks of the Upper Shaximiao; implying them to be no older than the Oxfordian.

&quot;M. sinocanadorum&quot; was found from the Middle to Upper Shishugou Formation. Radiometric dating suggests this formation dated to the Oxfordian, ranging from 158.7 to 161.2 mya. &quot;M. anyuensis,&quot; was found in the Suining Formation, thought initially to be Middle to Late Jurassic. A 2019 study found these rocks belonged to the Early Cretaceous, Aptian Stage, with an average age of around 114.4 mya. This indicates that mamenchisaurids might have existed around 30 million years longer than previously thought.

<text>Hunts Point is a neighborhood located on a peninsula in the South Bronx of New York City. It is the location of one of the largest food distribution facilities in the world, the Hunts Point Cooperative Market. Its boundaries are the Bruckner Expressway to the west and north, the Bronx River to the east, and the East River to the south. Hunts Point Avenue is the primary street through Hunts Point.

The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community District 2, and its ZIP Code is 10474. The neighborhood is served by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 41st Precinct. NYCHA property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 7 at 737 Melrose Avenue located in the Melrose section of the Bronx.

==History==
===European settlement===

Hunts Point was populated by the Wecquaesgeek, a Munsee-speaking band of Wappinger people, until English settlers first arrived in 1663. At this time, Edward Jessup and John Richardson arrived on the peninsula and purchased the lands from the Wecquaesgeek. After Jessup died, his widow, Elizabeth, entrusted the land to Thomas Hunt Jr., her son in-law for whom the area is named.

In the years between the Hunts&#x27; inheritance and 1850, several other wealthy landowning families occupied the peninsula. Legend has it that George Fox (1624–1691), founder of the Society of Friends (commonly known as Quakers), preached in the area in 1672. William H. Fox, a descendant of the Quaker leader, and his wife Charlotte Leggett, owned much of the land that is now Hunts Point.

As time passed and more New Yorkers became aware of Hunts Point, more City dwellers flocked to the area between 1850 and 1900. Later, the property wound up in the hands of Fox&#x27;s and Leggett&#x27;s son-in-law, H. D. Tiffany, a member of the family that owned the famous jewelry and decorative arts store Tiffany &amp; Co. now on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Fox, Tiffany and Leggett Streets derive their names from these former landowners. In 1909, the Fox mansion was demolished.

===Industry===
Hunts Point&#x27;s status as a home and vacation spot to the city&#x27;s elite came to an abrupt end in the period following World War I. At this time, the IRT Pelham Line () was built along Southern Boulevard. Apartment buildings replaced mansions, streets replaced meadows and Hunts Point became a virtual melting pot for the City&#x27;s masses.

Aside from being a period of residential growth for Hunts Point, the 20th century was also a time of industrial expansion for the peninsula. As more people moved to the area, the city&#x27;s business owners began to realize the advantages of locating to Hunts Point. Among these advantages were the convenient access to the Tri-State region, the existing rail lines running through the Hunts Point area and the abundance of space available for the development of industrial and commercial activity.

This discovery led to an influx of businesses to the area. As the momentum of incoming businesses increased, the reputation of Hunts Point grew accordingly among business circles. With the openings of the New York City Produce market in 1967 and Hunts Point Meat Market in 1974, and culminating with the designation of Hunts Point as an In-Place-Industrial Park in 1980, Hunts Point has grown into a successful economic zone. The Hunts Point Industrial Park hosts over 800 businesses providing an array of products and services to points throughout the world.

The second half of the 20th century, however, proved a difficult time for the district&#x27;s residential community. Characterized by frequent arson and mass abandonment from the 1960s through the 1990s, this period marked a low point in the area&#x27;s history. Living conditions became so difficult that almost 60,000 residents, approximately two-thirds of the population in Bronx Community District 2, left the neighborhood during the 1970s. The first full-service post office did not open in the neighborhood until 2001.

==Demographics==
The Hunts Point peninsula has a population of 8,684. It is a low-income residential neighborhood largely made up of Puerto Ricans, with smaller numbers of African Americans, Dominicans, Mexicans, and other Latin Americans. Hunts Point has one of the highest concentrations of Hispanics in all of New York City. Almost half of the population lives below the federal poverty line.

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Hunts Point and Longwood was 27,204, an increase of 2,062 (8.2%) from the 25,142 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 1.3% (342) White, 22.2% (6,049) African American, 0.2% (65) Native American, 0.7% (187) Asian, 0.0% (1) Pacific Islander, 0.2% (63) from other races, and 0.7% (192) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 74.6% (20,305) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 2, which comprises Hunts Point and Longwood, had 56,144 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 78.9 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 28% are between the ages of between 0–17, 29% between 25–44, and 21% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 12% and 10% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community Districts 1 and 2, including Melrose and Mott Haven, was $20,966. In 2018, an estimated 29% of Hunts Point and Longwood residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in eight residents (12%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 58% in Hunts Point and Longwood, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Hunts Point and Longwood are gentrifying.

==Land use and terrain==

Hunts Point is a peninsula located at the confluence of the Bronx River and the East River, which is actually a tidal strait connecting Upper New York Bay to the Long Island Sound. 
The total land area is approximately .

The land area in Hunts Point is dominated by industry. There is a small but dense residential pocket that occupies the high ground in the northern half of the peninsula along Hunts Point Avenue. It consists primarily of older pre-war architecture apartment buildings with a smaller number of semi-detached multi-unit row houses. The area includes the recently developed Hunts Point Riverside Park.

The New York City Department of City Planning designated a Special Hunts Point District in 2004 to incorporate zoning changes to encourage growth of the food distribution center while protecting the residential neighborhood.

===Parks===
Hunts Point Riverside Park was spearheaded by Majora Carter in 2000, and after several iterations, won the 2009 Rudy Bruner Award for Excellence in Public Spaces.

Joseph Rodman Drake Park is now recognized as the site of a burial ground for enslaved African-Americans.

The largest park in Hunts Point is the Barretto Point Park on the East River waterfront. It offers piers for fishing, sites for launching canoes and kayaks, and a floating swimming pool during the summer. There are also volleyball and basketball courts, a small amphitheater, and restroom facilities.

===Hunts Point Food Distribution Center===
Hunts Point is home to one of the largest food distribution centers in the world, covering . The Produce and Meat Distribution Center were opened along the Bronx river in 1967 and 1974, respectively. In 2005, Hunts Point became the site for New York City&#x27;s New Fulton Fish Market, which replaced the 180-year-old fish market formerly located in downtown Manhattan. Over 800 industrial businesses, employing over 25,000 workers, are located on the peninsula. A large concentration of food wholesalers, distributors, and food processing businesses are located in the New York City zoned industrial business park. Below are some of the facilities that make up the Food Distribution Center in Hunts Point:

The New York City Terminal Market carries fresh fruit and vegetables from 49 states and 55 foreign countries. The market consists of four buildings, each one-third of a mile in length. More than 65 fruit and vegetable wholesalers own and operate the coop, which has of warehouse space.

The facility started as the Youth House for Boys and Youth House for Girls in the mid-1940s, and it moved to Hunts Point in 1957. The Youth House soon became known as Spofford Juvenile Center. On August 1, 1998, it was vacated by the DJJ; earlier that year, on January 18, the city announced that the Horizon Juvenile Center, in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx, and the Crossroads Juvenile Center, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, would be opened to replace the Spofford facility. However, ultimately, Spofford was not closed, but was instead renamed Bridges Juvenile Center in 1999. In early 2011, Bridges was closed by the city. In announcing the closure, the Correctional Association of New York recognized that the facility had &quot;a history of poor conditions and brutality against children.&quot; It was reckoned as the juvenile counterpart of Attica Correctional Facility, which in turn has long been reckoned as the toughest adult prison in New York. The prison detention center was torn down in 2019 for a large, mixed use development to include over 700 housing units.

The Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center (VCBC) is an 800-bed barge offshore of Hunts Point, currently used as part of the New York City Department of Corrections.

<text>James R. &quot;Duke&quot; Aiona Jr. (born June 8, 1955) is an American politician and jurist who served as the eleventh lieutenant governor of Hawaii under Linda Lingle from 2002 to 2010. A member of the Republican Party, he also served both as an attorney and a judge for the state prior to becoming lieutenant governor.

Aiona was the Republican nominee for Governor of Hawaii in the 2010 election, but was defeated by Democrat Neil Abercrombie in the general election. He was the Republican nominee once again in the 2014 election, but lost to Democrat David Ige, since which he has done legal work and consulting. In June 2022, Aiona announced that he would run again for a third time in the Republican nomination for the 2022 election, which he lost to Democrat Josh Green, the incumbent Hawaii Lieutenant Governor. As of 2023, he is the most recent Republican to serve as Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii.

==Background==
James Aiona was born in Pearl City, Hawaiʻi. He is of Hawaiian and Portuguese descent on his father&#x27;s side and Chinese on his mother&#x27;s side. His mother worked as an elementary school teacher and his father worked as a life insurance agent. He attended Saint Louis School, a local academy of the Diocese of Honolulu. Upon graduating high school, Aiona played basketball at University of the Pacific in Stockton, California and pursued a bachelor of arts degree in political science, which he received from there in 1977. Aiona returned to Hawaiʻi and graduated from the William S. Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in 1981.

He began his legal career at the City and County of Honolulu as a deputy prosecutor, and was appointed to the Hawaiʻi State Judiciary in 1990 as a Family Court judge. In 1996, while serving as Circuit Court judge, Aiona became the first administrative judge and primary architect of the Drug Court Program in Hawaiʻi. The program gives non-violent offenders a chance to stay out of prison through active and effective drug rehabilitation.

In 1977, while attending law school, he met Vivian Welsh at a dance in Waikīkī. They married in 1981. They have two sons, Kulia and Makana; and two daughters, Ohulani and Kaimilani.
As lieutenant governor, Aiona was paid $117,312 &quot;per annum&quot;.

==Electoral history==
Aiona and Governor Linda Lingle became Hawaii&#x27;s first Republican administration to win a second term, and they won with the largest margin of victory in any gubernatorial race in the history of the state. Aiona ran to succeed Lingle as governor in 2010, but lost to Neil Abercrombie; he ran for governor again in 2014, losing to Democrat David Ige. In 2022, Aiona ran for governor a third time. He won the Republican nomination but was defeated in a landslide by the Democratic nominee, lieutenant governor Josh Green.

<doc id="650319" wikidata="Q5274997" url="?curid=650319" title="Dies Natalis (cantata)">
<text>Dies Natalis (Latin: &quot;Natal Day&quot; or &quot;Day of Birth&quot;), Op. 8, is a five-movement solo cantata composed in 1938–1939 by the twentieth-century English composer Gerald Finzi (1901–1956). It is a solo vocal cantata scored for a solo soprano or tenor accompanied by string orchestra, and features settings of four texts by Thomas Traherne (1636/37–1674), a seventeenth-century English Metaphysical poet, priest and theologian.

==History==
&quot;Dies Natalis&quot; is a cantata for solo voice and string orchestra. The opening introductory orchestral movement is followed by four movements for accompanied voice in which Finzi set mystical texts by the seventeenth-century English poet Thomas Traherne (1636/37–1674). Finzi selected three of Traherne&#x27;s poems, prefaced by prose drawn from the opening three sections of the Third Century in &quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot;. Written from 1938–1939, the score was published in 1946. Finzi conducted the work at the Three Choirs Festival in 1946.

The first recording of &quot;Dies Natalis&quot;, sponsored by the British Council, was one of only two recordings of Finzi&#x27;s music made in his lifetime. Two of the three sessions took place in October 1946, and the third on 29 January 1947. For Finzi it was an unfortunate experience: the soprano soloist was Joan Cross, whom he disliked for being an opera singer, and for her close connection to Benjamin Britten, whose work he disliked. The conductor Boyd Neel was ill for one of the three sessions, and Finzi had to take over. His biographer, Diana McVeagh, suggests it may have been for the &quot;Rhapsody&quot;, which was recorded on a particularly cold day - the coldest day in 50 years - and Joan Cross said afterwards, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I did justice to that piece, alas!&quot;.

In 1964, his son Christopher Finzi conducted the work for its second recording with the soloist Wilfred Brown. Brown had first sung &quot;Dies Natalis&quot; in 1952 under the composer&#x27;s baton. Finzi&#x27;s biographer, Diana McVeagh, describes Brown&#x27;s interpretation in the recording as &quot;among his finest: intelligent, poetic, and informed with his acute but gentle feeling for words.&quot;

==Movements==
The work is in five movements:
# &quot;Intrada&quot;
# &quot;Rhapsody&quot; (Recitativo stromentato)
# &quot;The Rapture&quot; (Danza)
# &quot;Wonder&quot; (Arioso)
# &quot;The Salutation&quot; (Aria)
N.G. Long has analysed Finzi&#x27;s setting of the texts.

==Texts of sung movements==
The following are the texts of movements 2,3, 4 and 5.

===Rhapsody===
Will you see the infancy of this sublime and celestial greatness? I was a stranger, which at my entrance into the world was saluted and surrounded with innumerable joys: my knowledge was divine. I was entertained like an angel with the works of God in their splendour and glory. Heaven and Earth did sing my Creator&#x27;s praises, and could not make more melody to Adam than to me. Certainly Adam in Paradise had not more sweet and curious apprehensions of the world than I. All appeared new, and strange at first, inexpressibly rare and delightful and beautiful. All things were spotless and pure and glorious.

The corn was orient and immortal wheat, which never should be reaped nor was ever sown. I thought it had stood from everlasting to everlasting. The green trees, when I saw them first, transported and ravished me, their sweetness and unusual beauty made my heart to leap, and almost mad with ecstasy, they were such strange and wonderful things.

O what venerable creatures did the aged seem! Immortal cherubims! and the young men glittering and sparkling angels, and maids strange seraphic pieces of life and beauty! I knew not that they were born or should die; but all things abided eternally. I knew not that there were sins or complaints or laws. I dreamed not of poverties, contentions or vices. All tears and quarrels were hidden from mine eyes. I saw all in the peace of Eden. Everything was at rest, free and immortal.

===The Rapture===
Sweet Infancy!&lt;br&gt;
O heavenly fire! O sacred Light!&lt;br&gt;
How fair and bright!&lt;br&gt;
How great am I&lt;br&gt;
Whom the whole world doth magnify!

O heavenly Joy!&lt;br&gt;
O great and sacred blessedness&lt;br&gt;
Which I possess!&lt;br&gt;
So great a joy&lt;br&gt;
Who did into my arms convey?

From God above&lt;br&gt;
Being sent, the gift doth me enflame,&lt;br&gt;
To praise His Name.&lt;br&gt;
The stars do move,&lt;br&gt;
The sun doth shine, to show His Love.

O how divine&lt;br&gt;
Am I! To all this sacred wealth&lt;br&gt;
This life and health,&lt;br&gt;
Who rais&#x27;d? Who mine&lt;br&gt;
Did make the same! What hand divine!

===Wonder===
How like an angel came I down! &lt;br&gt;
How bright are all things here! &lt;br&gt;
When first among His works I did appear&lt;br&gt;
O how their glory did me crown!&lt;br&gt;
The world resembled His Eternity&lt;br&gt;
In which my soul did walk;&lt;br&gt;
And every thing that I did see&lt;br&gt;
Did with me talk.

The skies in their magnificence&lt;br&gt;
The lovely, lively air, &lt;br&gt;
O how divine, how soft, how sweet, how fair!&lt;br&gt;
The stars did entertain my sense;&lt;br&gt;
And all the works of God, so bright and pure,&lt;br&gt;
So rich and great, did seem,&lt;br&gt;
As if they ever must endure&lt;br&gt;
In my esteem.

A native health and innocence&lt;br&gt;
Within my bones did grow,&lt;br&gt;
And while my God did all His Glories show,&lt;br&gt;
I felt a vigour in my sense &lt;br&gt;
That was all Spirit. I within did flow&lt;br&gt;
With seas of life, like wine;&lt;br&gt;
I nothing in the world did know&lt;br&gt;
But &#x27;twas Divine.

===The Salutation===
These little limbs, these eyes and hands which here I find,&lt;br&gt;
This panting heart wherewith my life begins;&lt;br&gt;
Where have ye been? Behind what curtain were ye from me hid so long?&lt;br&gt;
Where was, in what abyss, my new-made tongue?

When silent I, so many thousand, thousand years&lt;br&gt;
Beneath the dust did in a chaos lie, how could I smiles, or tears, &lt;br&gt;
Or lips, or hands, or eyes, or ears perceive? &lt;br&gt;
Welcome, ye treasures which I now receive.

From dust I rise and out of nothing now awake,&lt;br&gt;
These brighter regions which salute my eyes,&lt;br&gt;
A gift from God I take, the earth, the seas, the light, the lofty skies,&lt;br&gt;
The sun and stars are mine: if these I prize.

A stranger here, strange things doth meet, strange glory see,&lt;br&gt;
Strange treasures lodged in this fair world appear,&lt;br&gt;
Strange, all, and new to me: But that they mine should be who nothing was,&lt;br&gt;
That strangest is of all; yet brought to pass.

<text>Duricrust is a hard layer on or near the surface of soil. Duricrusts can range in thickness from a few millimeters or centimeters to several meters.

It is a general term (not to be confused with duripan) for a zone of chemical precipitation and hardening formed at or near the surface of sedimentary bodies through pedogenic or non-pedogenic processes. It is typically formed by the accumulation of soluble minerals deposited by mineral-bearing waters that move upward, downward, or laterally by capillary action, commonly assisted in arid settings by evaporation. There are different types of duricrusts, each distinguished by a dominant mineralogy. For example, ferricrete (laterite) is dominated by sesquioxides of iron; alcrete (bauxite) is dominated by sesquioxides of aluminum; silcrete by silica; calcrete (caliche) by calcium carbonate, and gypcrete (gypcrust) by gypsum.

Duricrust is often studied during missions to Mars because it may help prove the planet once had more water. Duricrust was found on Mars at the Viking 2 landing site, and a similar structure, nicknamed &quot;Snow Queen&quot;, was found under the Phoenix landing site. Phoenix&#x27;s duricrust was later confirmed to be water-based.

<doc id="650327" wikidata="Q7722" url="?curid=650327" title="Morning">
<text>Morning is the period from sunrise to noon. It is preceded by the twilight period of dawn. There are no exact times for when morning begins (also true of evening and night) because it can vary according to one&#x27;s lifestyle, latitude, and the hours of daylight at each time of year. However, morning strictly ends at noon, when afternoon starts.

Morning precedes afternoon, evening, and night in the sequence of a day. Originally, the term referred to sunrise.

==Etymology==
The Modern English words &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;tomorrow&quot; began in Middle English as , developing into , then , and eventually . English, unlike some other languages, has separate terms for &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;tomorrow&quot;, despite their common root. Other languages, like Dutch, Scots and German, may use a single wordto signify both &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;tomorrow&quot;.

==Significance==
=== Cultural implications ===

Morning prayer is a common practice in several religions. The morning period includes specific phases of the Liturgy of the Hours of Christianity.

Some languages that use the time of day in greeting have a special greeting for morning, such as the English . The appropriate time to use such greetings, such as whether it may be used between midnight and dawn, depends on the culture&#x27;s or speaker&#x27;s concept of morning. The use of &quot;&#x27;good morning&quot;&#x27; is ambiguous, usually depending on when the person woke up. As a general rule, the greeting is normally used from 3:00 a.m. to around noon. 

Many people greet someone with the shortened &#x27;morning&#x27; rather than &#x27;good morning&#x27;. It is used as a greeting, never a farewell, unlike &#x27;good night&#x27; which is used as the latter. To show respect, one can add the addressee&#x27;s last name after the salutation: &quot;Good morning, Mr. Smith.&quot;

For some, the word &quot;morning&quot; may refer to the period immediately following waking up, irrespective of the current time of day. This modern sense of &quot;morning&quot; is due largely to the worldwide spread of electricity, and the independence from natural light sources.

===Astronomy===

When a star first appears in the east just prior to sunrise, it is referred to as a heliacal rising. Despite the less favorable lighting conditions for optical astronomy, dawn and morning can be useful for observing objects orbiting close to the Sun. Morning (and evening) serves as the optimum time period for viewing the inferior planets Venus and Mercury. Venus and sometimes Mercury may be referred to as a morning star when they appear in the east prior to sunrise. It is a popular time to hunt for comets, as their tails grow more prominent as these objects draw closer to the Sun. The morning (and evening) twilight is used to search for near-Earth asteroids that orbit inside the orbit of the Earth. In mid-latitudes, the mornings near the autumnal equinox are a favorable time period for viewing the zodiacal light.

=== Genetics ===
For people, the morning period may be a period of enhanced or reduced energy and productivity. The ability of a person to wake up effectively in the morning may be influenced by a gene called &quot;Period 3&quot;. This gene comes in two forms, a &quot;long&quot; and a &quot;short&quot; variant. It seems to affect the person&#x27;s preference for mornings or evenings. People who carry the long variant were over-represented as morning people, while the ones carrying the short variant were evening preference people.

<text>The six-banded tiger barb (Desmopuntius hexazona) is a Southeast Asian species of cyprinid fish native to blackwater streams, peat swamps and other freshwater habitats with little movement in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo. Although there are reports from the Mekong basin, this is generally consider to be outside the range of the genus &quot;Desmopuntius&quot;. &quot;D. hexazona&quot; has often been confused—especially in the aquarium trade—with the less widespread, closely related &quot;D. pentazona&quot;, which is similar except that it has a black spot at the rear base of its dorsal fin (something that &quot;D. hexazona&quot; lacks). Although overall relatively widespread, &quot;D. hexazona&quot; is considered threatened in Singapore. This species reaches a total length of .

<doc id="650332" wikidata="Q1431272" url="?curid=650332" title="Longnose gar">
<text>The longnose gar (Lepisosteus osseus), also known as longnose garpike or billy gar, is a ray-finned fish in the family Lepisosteidae. The genus may have been present in North America for about 100 million years. References are made to gars being a primitive group of bony fish because they have retained some primitive features, such as a spiral valve intestine, but they are not primitive in the sense of not being fully developed. 

They have an olive brown to green, torpedo-shaped body armored with ganoid scales, elongated jaws that form a needle-like snout nearly three times the length of its head, and a row of numerous sharp, cone-shaped teeth on each side of the upper jaw. They typically inhabit freshwater lakes, brackish water near coastal areas, swamps, and sluggish backwaters of rivers and streams. They can breathe both air and water, which allows them to inhabit aquatic environments that are low in oxygen.

Longnose gar are found along the east coasts of North and Central America, and range as far west in the US as Kansas, Texas, and southern New Mexico. They are the only species of the family Lepisosteidae found in New Mexico. Their populations are stable and in some areas abundant in the interior portions of their range.

==Etymology==
The longnose gar was first described by Carl Linnaeus (1758), who gave it the name &quot;Esox osseus&quot;. The generic name &quot;Esox&quot;, which is for pike, was later changed to &quot;Lepisosteus&quot;, the genus for slender gars. &quot;Lepisosteus osseus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758), the scientific name for longnose gar, originated by combining &quot;lepis&quot;, which is Greek for scale, and &quot;osteos&quot;, the Latin word for bony. The latter references the bone-like, rhomboidal-shaped ganoid scales that protect gars against predation.

Gars have been referred to as primitive fish or living fossils because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their earliest ancestors, such as a spiral valve intestine, and a highly vascularized swim bladder lung that supplements gill respiration for breathing both air and water. Referring to gars as primitive fish simply means they have existed for a long time, having evolved over millions of years into a more perfected morphological state, not that the animal is primitive in the sense that it is not fully developed.

==Distribution==
Fossils of the genus dating from 100 million years ago (Mya) have been found in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. In the US, fossils of the modern species date back to the Pleistocene, where they were discovered in the Kingsdown Formation in Meade County, Kansas, and date back to the Irvingtonian (1.8–0.3 Mya). Longnose gar are found in Central America, Cuba, North America, and the Isla de la Juventud. 

Longnose gar are frequently found in fresh water in the eastern half of the US, but some gar were found in salinities up to 31 ppt. Their microhabitats consist of areas near downed trees, stone outcrops, and vegetation.

==Ecology==
The most common prey of longnose gar are small fish and occasionally insects and small crustaceans; they mostly feed at night. In most studies of adult &quot;L. osseus&quot;, a variety of species made up a majority of the diet, with the dominant prey changing among locations. Inland silversides were particularly common prey of juvenile gar in Lake Texoma, making up 84% of the diet, with gamefishes accounting for less than 1% of the diet. In Florida, their diet consisted mainly of fishes, with gizzard shad, bullhead catfish, and small bluegill particularly common. In Missouri, fishes made up 98% of the diet with shiners being the most common prey. In some lakes, adult longnose gar may consume large numbers of sunfish. Menhaden are a major food source along coasts where &quot;L. osseus&quot; moves towards the mouths of bayous into higher-salinity waters in the afternoon and evening to find this more prevalent prey. Longnose gar then move back up the bayous, into the lower-salinity waters in the morning. Their main competitors are other garfishes, and somewhat commonly, large gar to feed on smaller ones. Historically, Native Americans and early colonists harvested longnose gar as a main food source. Over time, longnose gars have gained in popularity as a sportfish rather than as a food source, but some people consider gar meat a delicacy. Adult longnose gar are considered apex predators in their aquatic habit, and have few predators, which include humans and in the southern reaches of their range the American alligator. They are most vulnerable to predation when they are young, and are preyed upon by other garfishes, larger fishes, birds of prey, snapping turtles, and water snakes.

==Life history==
Longnose gar have a typical lifespan of 15–20 years with a maximum reported age of 39. This long lifespan allows the female to sexually mature around 6 years old. Males mature sexually as early as 2 years of age. Longnose gar are sexually dimorphic; the females are larger than the males in body length, weight, and fin length. They generally have a clutch size close to 30,000, depending on the weight-to-length ratio of the females; larger females bear larger clutch sizes. They spawn in temperatures close to in late April to early July. Eggs have a toxic, adhesive coating to help them stick to substrates, and they are deposited onto stones in shallow water, rocky shelves, vegetation, or smallmouth bass nests. Their hatch time is 7–9 days; young gar stay in vegetation during the first summer of life. Longnose gar reach a typical length of , with a maximum length around and in weight.

==Management==
Currently, no management of this species is being conducted, nor is it federally listed as endangered, although some states have reported it as threatened (South Dakota, Delaware, and Pennsylvania). In the early 1900s, longnose gar were considered as destructive predators. Soon after this characterization, gar population reduction methods were established. Their declining populations are due to overfishing, habitat loss, dams, road construction, pollution, and other human-caused destruction of the aquatic systems. Because of their long lifespans and older sexual maturity age, factors affecting their reproduction are an issue in preserving them. Overfishing is a large issue for this fish, especially when the fish have not reached sexual maturity due to the female not reaching sexual maturity until about 6 years of age.

<doc id="650333" wikidata="Q465960" url="?curid=650333" title="Jesuit missions among the Guaraní">
<text>The Jesuit missions among the Guaraní were a type of settlement for the Guaraní people (&quot;Indians&quot; or &quot;Indios&quot;) in an area straddling the borders of present-day Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay (the triple frontier). The missions were established by the Jesuit Order of the Catholic Church early in the 17th century and ended in the late 18th century after the expulsion of the Jesuit order from the Americas. The missions have been called an experiment in &quot;socialist theocracy&quot; or a rare example of &quot;benign colonialism&quot;. Others have argued that &quot;the Jesuits took away the Indians&#x27; freedom, forced them to radically change their lifestyle, physically abused them, and subjected them to disease&quot;. 

In their newly acquired South American dominions, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires adopted a strategy of gathering native populations into communities called &quot;Indian reductions&quot; (, ). The objectives of the reductions were to impart Christianity and European culture. Secular as well as religious authorities created &quot;reductions&quot;. 

The missions among the Guaraní are often called collectively the Río de la Plata missions. The Jesuits attempted to create a &quot;state within a state&quot; in which the native peoples in the reductions, guided by the Jesuits, would remain autonomous and isolated from Spanish colonists and Spanish rule. A major factor attracting the natives to the reductions was the protection they afforded from enslavement and the forced labour of &quot;encomiendas&quot;. 

Under the leadership of both the Jesuits and native caciques, the reductions achieved a high degree of autonomy within the colonial empires. With the use of native labour, the reductions became economically successful. When the incursions of Brazilian Bandeirante slave-traders threatened the existence of the reductions, Indian militias were set up and armed (in defiance of existing royal orders against transfer of firearms to the Indians), which fought effectively against the Portuguese colonists. However, directly as a result of the suppression of the Society of Jesus in several European countries, including Spain, in 1767, the Jesuits were expelled from the Guaraní missions (and the Americas) by order of the Spanish king Charles III. So ended the era of the Paraguayan reductions. The reasons for the expulsion related more to politics in Europe than to the activities of the Jesuit missions themselves. 

The Jesuit Río de la Plata reductions reached a maximum population of 141,182 in 1732 in 30 missions in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. The reductions of the Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos, in eastern Bolivia, reached a maximum population of 25,000 in 1766. Jesuit reductions in the Llanos de Moxos, also in Bolivia, reached a population of about 30,000 in 1720. In Chiquitos, the first reduction was founded in 1691 and in the Llanos de Moxos in 1682.

==History==
In the 16th century, priests of different religious orders set out to evangelize the Americas, bringing Christianity to indigenous communities. The colonial governments and missionaries agreed on the strategy of gathering the often nomadic indigenous populations in larger communities called reductions in order to more effectively govern, tax, and evangelize them. Reductions generally were also construed as an instrument to make the Indians adopt European lifestyles and values. In Mexico the policy was called &quot;congregación&quot;, and also took the form of the hospitals of Vasco de Quiroga and the Franciscan Missions of California. In Portuguese Brazil reductions were known as &quot;aldeias&quot;. Legally, under colonial rule, Indians were classified as minors, in effect children, to be protected and guided to salvation (conversion to Christianity) by European missionaries.

The Jesuits, formally founded only in 1540, were relatively late arrivals in the New World, from about 1570, especially compared to the Dominicans and Franciscans, and therefore had to look to the frontiers of colonization for mission areas. The Jesuit reductions originated in the early seventeenth century when Bishop Lizarraga asked for missionaries for Paraguay. In 1609, acting under instructions from Phillip III, the Spanish governor of Asunción made a deal with the Jesuit Provincial of Paraguay. The Jesuits agreed to set up hamlets at strategic points along the Paraná river, that were populated with Indians and maintained a separation from Spanish towns. The Jesuits were to &quot;enjoy a tax holiday for ten years&quot; which extended longer. This mission strategy continued for 150 years until the Jesuits were expelled in 1767. Fundamentally the purpose, as far as the government was concerned, was to safeguard the frontier with the reductions where Indians were introduced to European culture. 

The reductions were considered by some philosophers as idyllic communities of noble savages, and were praised as such by Montesquieu in his &quot;L&#x27;Esprit des Lois&quot; (1748), and even by Rousseau, no friend of the Catholic Church. Their story has continued to be the subject of romanticizing, as in the film &quot;The Mission&quot; (1986), whose story relates to the events of the 1750s on a miniature scale. The Jesuit reductions have been lavishly praised as a &quot;socialist utopia&quot; and a &quot;Christian communistic republic&quot; as well as criticized for their &quot;rigid, severe and meticulous regimentation&quot; of the lives of the indigenous peoples they ruled with a firm hand through Guaraní intermediaries.

===Failure and flight===
In 1609 three Jesuits began the first reduction in San Ignacio Guazú in present-day Paraguay. For the next 22 years the Jesuits focused on founding 15 missions in the province of Guayrá, corresponding to the western two-thirds of present-day Paraná state of Brazil, spread over an area of more than . The total Native population of this area was probably about 100,000. 

The establishment of these missions was not without difficulty and danger. The Guaraní shamans resisted the imposition of a new religion and up to 7 Jesuits were killed by Indians during the first few years after the missions were established. In 1618 the first of a series of epidemics spread among the missions and killed thousands of the Guaraní. The congregation of the Guaraní into large settlements at the missions facilitated the spread of diseases. Nevertheless, the missions soon had 40,000 Guaraní in residence. Tens of thousands of Guaraní living in the same region remained outside the missions, living in their traditional manner and practicing their traditional religion.

The reductions were within Portuguese-claimed territory and large-scale raids by the Bandeirante slavers of São Paulo on the missions and non-mission Guaraní began in 1628. The Bandeirantes destroyed many missions and decimated and scattered the mission population. They looked upon the reductions with their concentration of Guaraní as an opportunity to capture slaves more easily than usual. Beginning in 1631 and concluding in 1638 the Jesuits moved the mission survivors still in residence, approximately 12,000 people, southwestward about to an area under Spanish control that in the 21st century is divided among Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. There were already Jesuit missions in the area and the refugees from Guayrá were also joined by Guaraní refugees from Uruguay and Tapé (in present-day Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) who had suffered similar experiences.

In the 1630s, the Jesuits also established short-lived missions in the Itatín region of present-day Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. They were destroyed by Bandeirantes and revolts by the local indigenous people.

===Reestablishment and success===
At the new locations, the Jesuits established 30 reductions, collectively often called the Rio de la Plata missions. By 1641, despite slavers and epidemics, the Guaraní population of the Rio de la Plata missions was 36,190. For nearly a century thereafter, the mission population increased to a maximum of 141,242 in 1732. Populations of individual reductions varied from 2,000 to 7,000. 
The immediate need of the Guaraní in the 1640s was to protect themselves from slavers. The Jesuits began to arm them, producing guns and gunpowder in the missions. They also secured the Spanish Crown&#x27;s permission, and some arms, to raise militias of Indians to defend the reductions against raids. The Bandeirantes followed the reductions into Spanish territory, but in 1641 the Guaraní militia defeated an army of 1,500 or more Bandeirante slavers and Tupi auxiliaries at the battle of Mbororé. The militias would eventually number as many as 4,000 troops and their cavalry was especially effective, wearing European-style uniforms and carrying bows and arrows as well as muskets.

Over a century passed until, in the 1750 Treaty of Madrid, the Spanish ceded to the Portuguese territories including the Misiones Orientales, reductions now in Brazil, threatening to expose the Indians again to the more oppressive Portuguese system. The Jesuits complied, trying to relocate the population across the Uruguay river as the treaty allowed, but the Guaraní militia under the mission-born Sepé Tiaraju resisted. What came to be known as the &quot;War of the Reductions,&quot; or the Guaraní War, ended when a larger combined force of 3,000 Spanish and Portuguese troops crushed the revolt in 1756, with Guaraní losses. both in the battle and subsequent massacres, of over 1,500.

The reductions came to be considered a threat by the secular authorities and were caught up in the growing attack on the Jesuits in Europe for unrelated reasons. The economic success of the reductions, which was considerable, although not as great as often described, combined with the Jesuits&#x27; independence, became a cause of concern. 

===Expulsion===
In 1767, king Charles III of Spain (1759–88) expelled the Jesuits from the Spanish dominions in the Americas. The expulsion was part of an effort in the Bourbon Reforms to assert more control over the American colonies. In total, 78 Jesuits departed from the missions leaving behind 89,000 Guaraní in 30 missions. 

According to historian Sarreal, most Guaraní initially welcomed the expulsion of the Jesuits. Spanish authorities made promises to Guaraní leaders and gained their support. The Guaraní leaders of one mission thanked the authorities who &quot;liberated us from the bondage that we lived in as slaves&quot;. Within two years, however, the financial situation of the missions was deteriorating and the Guaraní began leaving the missions seeking both freedom and higher wages. A decree in 1800 freed the Guaraní still in the missions from their communal obligation to labor. By 1840, the former missions were in ruins. While some Guaraní were employed outside the missions, many families were impoverished. A growing number of mestizos occupied what had formerly been mission lands. in 1848, Paraguayan president Carlos Antonio López declared that all Indians were citizens of Paraguay and distributed the last of the missions&#x27; communal lands. 

Some of the reductions have continued to be inhabited as towns. Córdoba, Argentina, the largest city associated with the reductions, was atypical as a Spanish settlement that predated the Jesuits and functioned as a centre for the Jesuit presence, with a novitiate centre and a college that is now the local university. The Córdoba mission was taken over by the Franciscans in 1767. Many of the missions in ruins have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including six of the Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos in Bolivia, and the ruins of Jesuit Missions of La Santísima Trinidad de Paraná and Jesús de Tavarangue in Paraguay. Two creole languages, Língua Geral and Nheengatu, based on Guaraní, Tupi, and Portuguese, originated in the reductions.

==Other reductions==
The Jesuit success in the Rio de la Plata, Chiquitos, and Llanos de Moxos missions was not duplicated by missions among the populous and warlike Eastern Bolivian Guaraní (Chiriguanos) of the Andes foothills. A Jesuit mission amongst the Chiriguanos in 1767 had only 268 converts. Likewise, the Jesuits had little success among the Guaycuru peoples, several nomadic tribes who dominated the Gran Chaco.
==Mission life==

At the height of the reductions, in 1740, about 30 different communities were home to more than 140,000 Guaraní. Another 50,000 more Tupi, Chiquitos, and members of diverse ethnic groups in the Llanos de Moxos were in Jesuit reductions in Bolivia. 

The reductions were ruled by indigenous chiefs who served as the reductions&#x27; governors, but were controlled by the Jesuits. There was a minimum of two Jesuits in a reduction, with more for larger ones. The social organization of the reductions has often been described as extremely efficient; most were self-supporting and even produced surpluses of goods, which they traded to outside communities, which laid the foundation of the belief that Jesuits were guarding immense riches acquired through Indian labour. The main traded products were cowhides and yerba mate (a herbal tea). Initially these were gathered from the wild, but later cultivated. A number of trades and skills were taught to some Indians, including even printing to produce mostly religious texts in indigenous languages, some illustrated by engravings by indigenous artists. In reality the communities were economically successful, but hardly constituted any important source of income for the Jesuit order. The degree to which the Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the degree to which they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate.

The main buildings, especially the churches, were often substantial Baroque constructions made by trained indigenous craftsmen and often remain impressive after over two centuries of abandonment, though the elaborate carved wood interiors have vanished in these cases. The first buildings were usually made in wood, which was sometimes covered with stucco decoration imitating stone Baroque architecture. Later, if resources allowed, actual stone buildings would follow, sometimes very large. The Bolivian missions have the best surviving wood and adobe churches. Father Martin Schmid (1694–1772), a Swiss Jesuit who was a leading figure in the reductions, was both an architect and a composer, and is usually given much of the credit for both the later architecture and the remarkable musical life of the reductions.

=== Mission layout ===
The ruins of several of the missions still remain. They were laid out in a uniform plan. The buildings were grouped about a central square, the church and store-houses at one end, and the dwellings of the natives, in long barracks, forming the other three sides. Each family had its own separate apartment, but one veranda and one roof served for perhaps a hundred families. The churches were of stone or fine wood, with lofty towers, elaborate sculptures and richly adorned altars, with statuary imported from Italy and Spain. The priests&#x27; quarters, the commissary, the stables, the armory, the workshop, and the hospital, also usually of stone, formed an inner square adjoining the church. The plaza itself was a level grass plot kept cropped by sheep. The native houses were sometimes of stone but more often of adobe or cane, with home-made furniture and religious pictures often made by the natives themselves.

=== Life at the missions ===
In the morning, children&#x27;s hymns were followed by Mass and breakfast, after which the workers went to their tasks. 
 The Jesuits marshaled their neophytes to the sound of music, and in procession to the fields, with a saint borne high aloft, the community each day at sunrise took its way. Along the way at stated intervals were shrines of saints where they prayed, and sang hymns between shrines. As the procession advanced it became gradually smaller as groups of Indians dropped off to work the various fields and finally the priest and acolyte with the musicians returned alone. At noon each group assembled for the Angelus, after which came dinner and a siesta; work was then resumed until evening. After supper came the rosary and sleep. On rainy days they worked indoors. Frequent festivals with sham battles, fireworks, concerts, and dances enlivened the community.
Aside from the main farm, each man typically had his own garden, pursuing agriculture, stock raising, and the cultivation of yerba mate. Jesuits introduced many European trades and arts to their communities. Cotton weavers, tanners, carpenters, tailors, hat makers, coopers, boat builders, silversmiths, musicians and makers of musical instruments, painters, and turners could sometimes be found. They also had printers, and manuscripts were also produced by hand copying.

The goods that were produced at the missions, including cattle, were sold in Buenos Aires and other markets under the supervision of the priests. The proceeds earned were divided among a common fund, the workers, and dependents.

Much emphasis was placed on education, as early training was regarded as the key to future success. Much of the instruction was conducted in Guaraní, which was still the prevailing language of the region, but Spanish was also taught.

<text>Sidney Coe Howard (June 26, 1891 – August 23, 1939) was an American playwright, dramatist and screenwriter. He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1925 and a posthumous Academy Award in 1940 for the screenplay for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

==Early life==
Sidney Howard was born in Oakland, California, the son of Helen Louise () and John Lawrence Howard. He is a descendant of Robert Coe, a 17th-century colonist who migrated to America from England. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1915 and went on to Harvard University to study playwriting under George Pierce Baker in his legendary &quot;47 workshop.&quot; (Other alumni of Baker&#x27;s class included Eugene O&#x27;Neill, Thomas Wolfe, Philip Barry and S.N. Behrman. Howard became good friends with Behrman.) 

Along with other students of Harvard professor A. Piatt Andrew, Howard volunteered with Andrew&#x27;s American Field Service, serving in France and the Balkans during World War I. After the war, Howard made use of his proficiency at foreign languages and translated a number of literary works from French, Spanish, Hungarian, and German. A liberal intellectual whose politics became progressively more left-wing over the years, he also wrote articles about labor issues for &quot;The New Republic&quot; and served as literary editor for the original &quot;Life Magazine&quot;.

==Career==

In 1921, Howard&#x27;s first play was produced on Broadway. A neo-romantic verse drama set in the time of Dante, &quot;Swords&quot;, did not do well with audiences or critics. It was with his realistic romance &quot;They Knew What They Wanted&quot; three years later that Howard established his reputation as a serious writer. The story of a middle-aged Italian vineyard owner who woos a young woman by mail with a false snapshot of himself, marries her, and then forgives her when she becomes pregnant by one of his farm hands, the play was praised for its un-melodramatic view of adultery and its tolerant approach to its characters. Theater critic Brooks Atkinson called it &quot;a tender, original, merciful drama.&quot; &quot;They Knew What They Wanted&quot; won the 1925 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, was adapted three times into film (1928, 1930, and 1940) and later became the Broadway musical, &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot;.

Howard&#x27;s career was anything but consistent. For every successful play he wrote, he saw several others close without making any money. His saving grace was that he was a remarkably prolific writer. &quot;Lucky Sam McCarver&quot;, his next play, was an unsentimental account of the marriage of a New York speakeasy owner on his way up in the world with a self-destructive socialite on her way down. It failed to attract audiences, though it won the admiration of some reviewers. 

With 1926&#x27;s &quot;The Silver Cord&quot;, starring Laura Hope Crews, Howard had a major hit. This drama about a mother who is pathologically close to her sons and works to undermine their romances, the result of a decade fascinated with Freud, Oedipal complexes, and family dysfunction. Both Howard&#x27;s works &quot;The Silver Cord&quot; and &quot;Ned McCobb&#x27;s Daughter&quot; ran on alternate weeks in the 1926-1927 season, produced by the Theatre Guild. &quot;The Silver Cord&quot; is also the only original play by Howard to outlive its era. (His 1929 adaptation &quot;S.S. Tenacity&quot; is periodically revived.) The play was occasionally staged by regional theater companies through the late twentieth century, and its first Off-Broadway production was mounted in 2013. The 1933 film of the play starred Irene Dunne and Joel McCrea, with Laura Hope Crews reprising her stage role.

By 1930, Howard was &quot;one of the most dashing figures on the Broadway scene.&quot; A prolific writer and a founding member of the Playwrights&#x27; Company (with Maxwell Anderson, S. N. Behrman, Elmer Rice, and Robert Sherwood), he ultimately wrote or adapted more than seventy plays; a consummate theater professional, he also directed and produced a number of works.

In 1922, Howard married actress Clare Eames (1896–1930), who had played the female lead in &quot;Swords.&quot; She later starred in Howard&#x27;s &quot;Lucky Sam McCarver&quot; (1925) and &quot;Ned McCobb&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1926) on Broadway and &quot;The Silver Cord&quot; in London (1927). The couple separated in 1927, and Howard&#x27;s anger at the disintegration of his marriage is reflected in his bitter satire of modern matrimony, &quot;Half Gods&quot; (1929). 

A particular admirer of the understated realism of French playwright Charles Vildrac, Howard adapted two of his plays into English, under the titles &quot;S. S. Tenacity&quot; (1929) and &quot;Michael Auclair&quot; (1932). One of his greatest successes on Broadway was an adaptation of a French comedy by René Fauchois, &quot;The Late Christopher Bean&quot;. &quot;Yellow Jack&quot;, an historical drama about the war against yellow fever, was praised for its high-minded purpose and innovative staging when it premiered in 1934.

&quot;In his thinking, Howard was very much a man of his time,&quot; Brooks Atkinson wrote. &quot;He was a Wilsonian; he brooded on the tragedy of the League of Nations. He intended to write an ironic tragedy on the theme of the destruction of such a league that would be devoted to the service rather than the conquest of humanity, [using the techniques] that made &quot;Yellow Jack&quot; such a forceful drama.&quot;

Hired by Samuel Goldwyn, Howard worked in Hollywood at MGM and wrote several successful screenplays. Despite his well-known left-wing political sympathies (he supported William Foster, the Communist Party candidate for president, in 1932), he became a shrewd Hollywood insider. In 1932, Howard was nominated for an Academy Award for his adaptation of the Sinclair Lewis novel &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; and again in 1936 for &quot;Dodsworth&quot;, which he had adapted for the stage in 1934. He wrote a screenplay as well for Lewis&#x27;s most political book, the anti-Fascist novel &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here.&quot; The film was never made. (Studio officials claimed production-cost issues, but Howard maintained that the politics of the script were the issue.) Sinclair Lewis was a great admirer of Howard&#x27;s stage work and was pleased with his three film adaptations, and the two men (whose political opinions aligned) became good friends.

In 1935, Howard wrote the Broadway stage adaptation of Humphrey Cobb&#x27;s novel &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;. With its unsparing depictions of battlefield brutality, the play failed at the box office. As a World War I veteran, however, Howard believed it necessary to show the horrors of armed conflict. Convinced that the novel should be filmed one day, Howard wrote, &quot;It seems to me that our motion picture industry must feel something of a sacred obligation to make the picture.&quot; The film version of the novel, directed by Stanley Kubrick, did not appear until 1957. Howard&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; echoed &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; with an unflinching look at the cost of war.

After two Academy Award nominations and the Broadway success of &quot;Dodsworth,&quot; Sidney Howard was at the height of his fame in the late 1930s and appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on June 7, 1937. Two years later, he was dead.

Howard was the posthumous winner of the 1939 Academy Award for an adapted screenplay for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. (He was the only writer honored for the writing of that screenplay, despite the fact that his script was revised by several other writers.) This was the first time a posthumous nominee for any Oscar won the award.

Howard was also an advocate for writers&#x27; rights in the theatrical industry. In 1935, he served as the sixth president of the Dramatists Guild of America.

==Personal life==
Three years after their separation, Clare Eames died unexpectedly in 1930. She was the niece of opera singer Emma Eames on her father&#x27;s side, and of the inventor Hiram Percy Maxim on her mother&#x27;s side, and a granddaughter of former Maryland governor William Thomas Hamilton. Howard and Eames had one child, a daughter, Jennifer Howard (1925-1993), who became an actress.

The following year in 1931, Howard married Leopoldine &quot;Polly&quot; Damrosch, youngest daughter American of conductor and composer Walter Damrosch. The couple had a son, Walter Damrosch Howard, and two daughters, Lady Sidney Howard Urquhart, and Margaret Howard.

His first daughter, Jennifer, married Samuel Goldwyn Jr. in 1950, with whom she had three sons: business executive Francis Goldwyn, actor Tony Goldwyn, and studio executive John Goldwyn.

==Death==
Howard died in the summer of 1939 at the age of 48 in Tyringham, Massachusetts while working on his 700-acre farm. A lover of the quiet rural life, Howard spent as much time on his farm as possible when he was not in New York or Hollywood. He was crushed to death in a garage by his two-and-a-half ton tractor. He had turned the ignition switch on and was cranking the engine to start it when it lurched forward, pinning him against the wall of the garage. &quot;His death was a Broadway calamity,&quot; Atkinson wrote. &quot;Broadway and the Playwrights&#x27; Company lost one of its most admirable people...in the midst of an active career and full of ideas for more plays.&quot; In his 2007 history of Broadway playwrights, Ethan Mordden wrote, &quot;When he found his metier, Howard excelled at edgy American stories about charismatic but somewhat unlikable people. He seemed to enjoy testing his public; or perhaps he simply saw the world as being filled with rogues...&quot;

At the time of his death, Howard was working on a dramatization of Carl van Doren&#x27;s biography of Benjamin Franklin. He is buried in the Tyringham Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Howard left behind a number of unproduced works. &quot;Lute Song&quot;, an adaptation of an old Chinese play co-written with Will Irwin, premiered on Broadway in 1946. A lighthearted reworking of the Faust legend, &quot;Madam, Will You Walk?&quot; closed out of town when produced by the Playwrights&#x27; Company in 1939, but was more warmly received as the first production of the Phoenix Theatre in 1953.

Shortly after his death his colleagues at the Playwrights&#x27; Company founded in his honor the Sidney Howard Memorial Award. The award consisted of a prize of $1500 given to a young playwright without notable successes who had shown promise in a New York production. The inaugural prize was given to Robert Ardrey in recognition of his play &quot;Thunder Rock&quot;.

Howard was posthumously inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981.

<text>Pantoprazole, sold under the brand name Protonix, among others, is a medication used for the treatment of stomach ulcers, short-term treatment of erosive esophagitis due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis, and pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. It may also be used along with other medications to eliminate &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;. Pantoprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and its effectiveness is similar to that of other PPIs. It is available by mouth and by injection into a vein.
Common side effects include headaches, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and joint pain. More serious side effects may include severe allergic reactions, a type of chronic inflammation known as atrophic gastritis, &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; colitis, low magnesium, and vitamin B12 deficiency. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases gastric acid secretion. It works by inactivating (H+/K+)-ATPase function in the stomach.
The study of pantoprazole began in 1985, and it came into medical use in Germany in 1994. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the sixteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 30million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023.

==Medical uses==
Pantoprazole is used for short-term treatment of erosion and ulceration of the esophagus for adults and children five years of age and older caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease. It can be used as a maintenance therapy for long-term use after initial response is obtained, but there have not been any controlled studies about the use of pantoprazole past a duration of 12 months. Pantoprazole may also be used in combination with antibiotics to treat ulcers caused by &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;. It can also be used for long-term treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It may be used to prevent gastric ulcers in those taking NSAIDs.

For improved efficacy of pantoprazole, the oral tablet formulation is taken half an hour prior to ingestion of food. In the hospital, intravenous administration is indicated when patients are unable to take the medication by mouth.

=== Children ===
Pantoprazole is only indicated for the short-term treatment of erosive esophagitis in children ages seven and older; and the safety and effectiveness of pantoprazole have only been established in the treatment of erosive esophagitis in children.

==Adverse effects==
===Infection=== 
Stomach acid plays a role in killing ingested bacteria. Use of pantoprazole may increase the chance of developing infections such as pneumonia, particularly in hospitalized patients.

=== Elderly ===
The incidence of adverse effects occurring in people aged 65 years and older was similar to that in people aged 65 years and less.

=== Pregnancy ===
In reproductive studies using doses largely greater than the recommended doses performed on rats and rabbits, there was no evident harm on the development of the baby.

=== Breast feeding ===
Pantoprazole has been found to pass through the breast milk. Additionally, in rodent cancer studies, pantoprazole has been shown to potentially cause tumor growth. The clinical relevance of the finding is unknown, but risks and benefits are recommended for consideration in determining the use of therapy for the mother and child.

===Common===
* Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain (6%), diarrhea (9%), flatulence (4%), nausea (7%), vomiting (4%)
* Neurologic: headache (12%), dizziness (3%)
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: arthralgia (3%)

===Rare===
* Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, hepatitis
* Blood problems: low white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia
* Immunologic: Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Metabolic: elevated creatine kinase, elevated cholesterol levels, elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), swelling
* Musculoskeletal: Muscle disorders, bone fracture and infection, &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection, osteoporosis-related hip fracture, rhabdomyolysis
* Kidneys: interstitial nephritis
* Nutrition: may reduce the absorption of important nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, including certain medications, leaving users at increased risk for pneumonia.

=== Long-term use ===
* Osteoporosis and bone fracture have been observed in people on high-dose and/or long-term (over one year) prescription proton pump inhibitors.
* Hypomagnesia has been observed in people on medications like pantoprazole when taken for longer periods of time (generally one year or more, although cases have been reported with regimens as short as three months).
* Deficiencies such as vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency, and calcium deficiency may be seen with long term use. Vitamin B12 deficiency is due to the change in the acidic environment within the stomach with the use of pantoprazole which prevents peptidases from being activated. This prevents the cleaving of R-factor from vitamin B12 and prevents its absorption.
* Rebound hypergastrinemia may be seen when stopping the medication after long term use.

=== Discontinuation ===
In people taking PPIs for longer than six months, a dose taper is recommended prior to discontinuation.

== Interactions ==
Due to its effect of reducing stomach acidity, use of pantoprazole can affect absorption of drugs that are pH-sensitive, such as ampicillin esters, ketoconazole, atazanavir, iron salts, amphetamine and mycophenolate mofetil. Additional medications that are affected include bisphosphonate derivatives, fluconazole, clopidogrel, and methotrexate.

==Pharmacology==
The mechanism of action of pantoprazole is to inhibit the final step in gastric acid production. In the gastric parietal cell of the stomach, pantoprazole covalently binds to the H+/K+ ATP pump to inhibit gastric acid and basal acid secretion. The covalent binding prevents acid secretion for up to 24 hours and longer.

Pantoprazole is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system. Metabolism mainly consists of demethylation by CYP2C19 followed by sulfation. Another metabolic pathway is oxidation by CYP3A4. Pantoprazole metabolites are not thought to have any pharmacological significance. It is usually given with a prokinetic drug because of inactivity in the acidic environment of the stomach. Pantoprazole binds irreversibly to H+K+ATPase (proton pumps) to suppress the secretion of acid. Due to irreversible binding of the pumps, new pumps have to be made before acid production can be resumed. The drug&#x27;s plasma half-life is about two hours. After administration, the time for the drug to reach peak plasma concentrations is 2 to 3 hours. The percentage of the drug that is protein bound is 98%.

==History==
Pantoprazole was discovered by scientists at Byk Gulden, a subsidiary of Altana; the drug discovery program started in 1980, producing pantoprazole in 1985. The compound was actually created by chemists working to scale up a different chemical that had been chosen as a development candidate. Byk Gulden partnered with Smith Kline &amp; French in 1984. The compound&#x27;s development names were BY1029 and SK&amp;F96022. By 1986 the companies had created the sodium salt, pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, and decided to develop it as it was more soluble and stable, and was more compatible with other ingredients used in the formulation. It was first marketed in Germany in 1994. Wyeth licensed the US patent from Altana, and obtained marketing approval from the US FDA in 2000 under the trade name Protonix.

In 2004, worldwide sales of the drug were $3.65 billion, about half of which were in the US.

In 2007, Altana&#x27;s drug business was acquired by Nycomed. Nycomed was in turn acquired by Takeda in 2011 and Wyeth was acquired by Pfizer in 2009.

The patent protecting the drug was set to expire in 2010, but Teva Pharmaceuticals filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in 2007, and Wyeth and Nycomed sued Teva for patent infringement, but Teva decided to launch its generic drug &quot;at risk&quot; that year, before the patent had been invalidated. Wyeth launched an authorized generic in 2008. Pfizer and Takeda&#x27;s patent exclusivity expired in 2010, and an administrative exclusivity they had for pediatric use expired in January 2011, and full generic competition began. The litigation between Teva and Pfizer/Takeda was settled in 2013, with Teva paying the patent holders $2.15 billion in damages for its early launch.

== Veterinary use ==
In veterinary medicine, pantoprazole appears to be safe to use in several large animal species. The pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole have been explored in several veterinary species, including calves, alpacas and foals with half lives reported as 2.81, 0.47, and 1.43 hours, respectively. Pantoprazole appears to be eliminated more quickly in goats when compared to calves, with goats having an elimination half-life of less than one hour.

Pantoprazole has been demonstrated to increase the 3rd compartment pH in alpacas. It has been shown to be generally safe to use in cattle, sheep and goats. The subcutaneous bioavailability is greater than 100% in calves. In calves intravenous and subcutaneous administration has been shown to significantly elevate abomasal pH.

Print unions tried to block distribution of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, along with other newspapers in Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News International group, after production was shifted to a new plant in Wapping in January 1986.

At the new facility, modern computer facilities allowed journalists to input copy directly, rather than involving print union workers who used older &quot;hot-metal&quot; Linotype printing methods. All of the workers were dismissed. The failure of the strike was devastating for the print union workers, and it led both to a general decline in trade union influence in the UK, and to a widespread adoption of modern newspaper publishing practices.

==Political significance==
Along with the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85, the Wapping dispute was a significant defeat in the history of the British trade union movement. The 51-week miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85 was followed a year later by the 54-week &quot;Wapping dispute&quot; launched by newspaper printers in London. It resulted in a second major defeat for unions and another victory for Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s union policies, especially her assurance that the police would defend the plants against pickets trying to shut them down. The target was Britain&#x27;s largest privately owned newspaper empire, News International (parent of &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;News of the World&quot; and others, all owned by Rupert Murdoch). He wanted to introduce technological innovations that would put 90% of the old-fashioned typesetters out of work. The company offered redundancy payments of £2,000 to £30,000 to each printer to quit their old jobs. The union rejected the offer and on 24 January 1986 its 6,000 members at Murdoch&#x27;s papers went on strike. Meanwhile News International had built and clandestinely equipped a new printing plant in the London district of Wapping.

The principal print unions – the National Graphical Association (NGA), the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT 82) and the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers (AUEW) – ran closed shops: only union members could be hired at the old Fleet Street plants; most were sons of members. However the new plant in Wapping did not have a closed shop contract. The company activated its new plant with the assistance of another union, the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union (EETPU). Most members of the National Union of Journalists moved to Wapping and NUJ Chapels continued to operate. The NUJ urged its member journalists not to work there and many NUJ members, known as &quot;refuseniks&quot;, refused to go to Wapping. However, enough printers were employed – 670 in all – to produce the same number of newspapers that it took 6,800 employees to print at the old shop. The efficiency was obvious and frightened the union into holding out an entire year. Thousands of union pickets tried to block shipments out of the plant; they injured 574 policemen. There were 1,500 arrests. The pickets failed. The union tried an illegal secondary boycott and was fined in court, losing all of its assets. In the next two years Britain&#x27;s national newspapers opened new plants and abandoned Fleet Street, adopting the new technology with far fewer employees. This is thought to have led to greater support for Thatcher among the press.

==Background==
For years Fleet Street had been living with poor industrial relations, and the so-called &quot;Spanish practices&quot;irregular or restrictive work practicesmaintained by trade union officials had put limits on newspaper owners that they considered intolerable. On the other hand, the News International management team, led by Bill O&#x27;Neill, was seeking terms that the union considered unacceptable: flexible working, a no-strike clause, the adoption of new technology and the end of the closed shop.

Despite the widespread use of the offset litho printing process elsewhere, the Murdoch papers, in common with the rest of Fleet Street, continued to be produced by the labour-intensive hot-metal Linotype method, rather than being composed electronically. Eddy Shah&#x27;s Messenger Group, in a long-running and bitter dispute at Warrington, also benefited from the Thatcher government&#x27;s trade union legislation which allowed employers to de-recognise unions, enabling the Messenger Group to use an alternative workforce and new technology in newspaper production. Journalists could input copy directly, which reduced the need for labour in the print halls, cut costs and shortened production time dramatically.

Although individual journalists (many of whom were members of the National Union of Journalists) worked &quot;behind the wire&quot; for News International at Wapping, the NUJ opposed the move to Wapping and urged its members not to do so without proper negotiations. NUJ members who refused to work at Wapping became known during the dispute as &quot;refuseniks&quot;. The NUJ was represented alongside the print unions in the negotiations with News International which eventually led to a monetary settlement.

==Start of dispute==
Immediately after the strike was announced on 24 January 1986, dismissal notices were served on all those taking part in the industrial action, effectively sacking 6,000 employees. As part of a plan that had been developed over many months, the company replaced the workforce with members of the EETPU and transferred its four main titles (&quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot; and the &quot;News of the World&quot;) to the Wapping plant.

Murdoch had led the print unions to think that the Wapping plant was to be used for a new evening newspaper, the &quot;London Post&quot;. This began what became known as the Wapping dispute. In support of sacked members, the print unions organized regular demonstrations outside the company&#x27;s premises in Pennington Street, with six pickets posted on Virginia Street and marches of large numbers of people usually converging nearby on The Highway in Wapping. 

The demonstrations outside the Wapping plant were not peaceful, although the trade unions maintained that they were committed to pursuing peaceful means to resolve the dispute.

The unions and leading members of the Labour Party also called for a boycott of the four newspapers involved. The print unions had encouraged the national boycott of Murdoch&#x27;s papers, and had been relying on the rail unions to ensure that they were not distributed, a problem Murdoch circumvented by distributing his papers via TNT instead of British Rail&#x27;s trains.

Like the miners&#x27; strike, large demonstrations were mounted to dissuade workers – in this case, TNT&#x27;s drivers as well as journalists and operators of the new printing process – from entering the premises, and a large police operation used force to ensure they were not able to physically stop the movement of TNT&#x27;s lorries distributing newspapers from the plant. More than 400 police officers, some TNT drivers and many members of the public were injured, and more than 1,200 arrests made during the dispute. A large-scale police operation was mounted throughout London to ensure the Wapping plant could operate effectively, and the movement of local residents was heavily restricted. To ensure their safety, workers at the plant were often taken to and from work in buses modified to withstand the attacks they came under.

Despite some public sympathy for the plight of the pickets, the boycott of Wapping&#x27;s news titles was not successful, and not a single day of production was lost throughout the year of the dispute&#x27;s duration.

==End of strike==
News International&#x27;s strategy in Wapping had strong government support, and enjoyed almost full production and distribution capabilities and a complement of leading journalists. The company was therefore content to allow the dispute to run its course. With thousands of workers having gone for over a year without jobs or pay, the strike eventually collapsed on 5 February 1987.

With the restrictive trade union practices associated with the traditional Fleet Street publishing empires removed, the trade union movement in Britain was irrevocably changed. The actions of News International and Rupert Murdoch, together with the EETPU and the police were criticised – in particular the policing methods that were employed. People in Wapping were largely viewed by the police as sympathetic to the strikers, and were frequently denied access to their own streets and homes. The strike also coincided with the redevelopment of the Docklands, of which Wapping is a part, and saw the end of the traditional association of the area with the labour movement.

By 1988, nearly all the national newspapers had abandoned Fleet Street to relocate in the Docklands, and had begun to change their printing practices to those being employed by News International. In 2016 the Dundee-based Sunday Post closed the last remaining Fleet Street newspaper office.

<text>Queen&#x27;s Gardens is a sequence of gardens in the centre of Kingston upon Hull, England. They are set out within a area that until 1930 was filled with the waters of Queen&#x27;s Dock. As the dock was not fully filled in, the gardens are largely below the level of the surrounding streets.

==Description==

The gardens have a central avenue of trees aligned with the Wilberforce Monument to the east, which is fronted by a pool with fountains. The statue of William Wilberforce atop a large Doric column was moved to this site in 1935 and originally dominated the gardens. However, the construction of Sir Frederick Gibberd&#x27;s building for Hull College behind the column in 1962 has reduced its impact.

Most visitors approach the gardens from the west, through a circus of flower gardens at street level around the &quot;Rosebowl&quot; fountain. Slopes and steps lead down from this area into the main area of the sunken gardens. Either side of the central avenue there are broad areas of lawn, interspersed with smaller borders filled with perennials, and another two large fountain pools.

The formal central axis of the gardens is now diminished by post-war planting of Japanese cherry trees in the central avenue, many of which are now over-mature and showing signs of stress. Vistas from the Rosebowl gardens into the main gardens were previously blocked by overgrown shrubberies on the slope between the two levels until recent renovations in 2017 to open out the area in-between the two sections of the park. Renovations also updated the pools and introduced a number of art installations.
On the north side of the Gardens a plaque commemorates Robinson Crusoe, the famous fictional character who sailed from Hull in 1651 on the voyage that ended with him castaway on a desert island for over 28 years. The plaque includes the quotation, &quot;Had I the sense to return to Hull, I had [&quot;i.e.&quot; would have] been happy.&quot;

The Peace Garden, at the eastern end of the park, was instituted by Hull City Council for the UN&#x27;s International Year of Peace in 1986. This was led by Alice Tulley, a councillor and a Quaker, with support from the local CND group. Peace events were held there with the mayor in attendance. Since then the Quakers have held a Meeting there each year to commemorate Hiroshima Day. This falls on the Sunday nearest the anniversary of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Victoria Square is at western end of the gardens, leading to the Princes Quay shopping centre and the Ferens Art Gallery. The gardens are well used, particularly by the local student population.

In 2005, the new BBC development was completed at the north-west corner of the gardens. This incorporates a tall apartment block.

In 2006, it was announced that Hull Citybuild – Hull&#x27;s Urban Regeneration Company – had been working with Hull City Council to bring forward &quot;a major public realm design competition&quot; for Queen&#x27;s Gardens and Victoria Square.

In August 2017, a £310,000 sculpture, Solar Gate, was installed in the gardens as part of the public realms work for the 2017 UK City Of Culture.

In February 2022, the first phase of a £11.7 million redevelopment of the gardens began. The second phase started in June 2023 and is expected to take 14 months to complete.

<doc id="650352" wikidata="Q3436573" url="?curid=650352" title="Robert Williams (artist)">
<text>Robert L. Williams, often styled Robt. Williams (born March 2, 1943), is an American painter, cartoonist, and founder of &quot;Juxtapoz Art &amp; Culture Magazine&quot;. Williams was one of the group of artists who produced &quot;Zap Comix&quot;, along with other underground cartoonists, such as Robert Crumb, Rick Griffin, S. Clay Wilson, and Gilbert Shelton. His mix of California car culture, cinematic apocalypticism, and film noir helped to create a new genre of psychedelic imagery.

== Early life and education ==
Robert L. Williams II was born on March 2, 1943, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Robert Wandell Williams and Betty Jane Spink. At a very early age he displayed an interest in drawing and in watercolor painting. He was enrolled in the Stark Military Academy in the first grade. When he was around fourteen years old, he was a member of the Albuquerque Unicycle Club.

Williams was instilled at an early age with a love for car culture. His father owned The Parkmore, a drive-in restaurant complete with carhops, which was frequented by hot rodders. Williams received his first car at twelve years old as a gift from his father: a 1934 Ford five-window coupe. References to his childhood environment can be seen throughout Williams&#x27; work, as well as in the custom hot rods which he would later build himself. He became so skillful at painting specular reflection from chromed auto parts that he later drew the chrome parts for other comix artists, who then drew the rest of the auto.

The Williams household was unstable, as his parents married each other a total of four times. During his early childhood, Williams was shuttled between Albuquerque, New Mexico, and his father&#x27;s home in Montgomery, Alabama. His parents&#x27; final separation occurred in 1956, after which 12-year-old Robert lived with his mother in Albuquerque. He became a delinquent, immersing himself in hot rods, hi-jinx, and street gangs; this led to him being expelled from public school in the eleventh grade.

To avoid the possibility of jail time, Williams moved to Los Angeles in 1963 when he was twenty years old. There, he enrolled in art courses at Los Angeles City College, where he contributed artwork to the school&#x27;s paper, &quot;The Collegiate&quot;, and met Suzanne Chorna, his future wife.

After that, he briefly attended the California Institute of the Arts (formerly the Chouinard Art Institute), where he was branded an &quot;illustrator&quot; in derogatory fashion. Now married, Williams left art school and became a professional artist in search of work. He worked for &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine and designed containers for the Weyerhaeuser Corporation, before he found his dream job in 1965 working with Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth.

== Career ==
In the late 1960s, while doing advertisements and graphics for Roth, Williams was also a productive oil painter. It was during this period that he created his &quot;Super Cartoon&quot; paintings. These included &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (which depicts a robotic rapist about to be punished by a metal avenger) and &quot;In the Land of Retinal Delights&quot;. These paintings were meticulously created in the style of the old masters, using hand-made paints and multiple layers of varnish. The &quot;Super Cartoon&quot; works sold well but were very time-consuming to produce, sometimes requiring more than a year.

In 1969 Williams joined the &quot;Zap Comix&quot; collective of artists with the infamous issue number 4 of Zap Comix. He flourished within the non-conformist, anti-establishment art movement of that time, along with Robert Crumb, S. Clay Wilson, Gilbert Shelton, Spain Rodriguez, Rick Griffin, and Victor Moscoso. That same year he created Coochy Cooty, his seminal underground comix antihero. His creation was unleashed in 1970 in &quot;Coochy Cooty Men&#x27;s Comics&quot; and in many issues of &quot;Zap Comix&quot;, and is still alive today in Williams&#x27;s oil paintings. 1970 was also the last year of Williams employment with Roth studios.

Many of Williams&#x27; comix and &quot;Super Cartoon&quot; paintings were included in his first book, &quot;The Lowbrow Art of Robt. Williams&quot;, which was published in 1982 by Rip Off Press. The title of the book was meant as a statement to the highbrow tone of the art world, which was antithetical to Williams&#x27;s artwork.

In the 1980s, Williams became involved with the punk rock movement and found his next audience. During this period, he published &quot;Zombie Mystery Paintings&quot;, which influenced and inspired a multitude of artists with its vibrant, sexy, and ultra-violent images. These works were done quickly, on rough canvas, and were sold via a waiting list due to heavy demand. In addition to Williams&#x27;s books, the popularity of his work was established in galleries known for lowbrow art, such as Billy Shire&#x27;s La Luz de Jesus Gallery, 01 Gallery, and the Tamara Bane Gallery.

&quot;Visual Addiction&quot; was Williams&#x27;s next book of paintings. The works it contained were more tightly rendered and began to contain detailed background elements and vignettes. This book also contained Williams&#x27;s &quot;Rubberneck Manifesto,&quot; which stated that &quot;Something dead in the street commands more measured units of visual investigation than 100 &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;s!&quot;

Williams published several more books as his work progressed in content, style, and size. His paintings moved from &quot;zombie sex&quot; to quantum mechanics and had sold-out shows on both coasts, generating demand for them from around the world. He influenced other artists and gave them a voice through publications such as &quot;Art? Alternatives&quot; in 1992, and later, &quot;Juxtapoz Art &amp; Culture Magazine&quot;. Williams founded &quot;Juxtapoz&quot; in 1994; the magazine propelled many new artists to fame and rose to become one of the most-circulated art magazines.

The year 1997 saw the publication of the retrospective &quot;Malicious Resplendence&quot; and his one-man show at the Shafrazi Gallery in New York. Two more Shafrazi shows followed, in 2000 and 2003. These works were published in &quot;Through Prehensile Eyes&quot; in 2005.

His next one-man show was in 2009, once again at the Shafrazi Gallery; it was titled &quot;&quot;Conceptual Realism: In the Service of the Hypothetical&quot;.&quot; A catalog of the same title was published. This exhibition moved to California State University, Northridge in 2010, where Williams provided a tour of the works, as well as a lecture defining his art movement, Colloquial or Exploratory Realism (Feral Art).

In 2010, Williams was busy with his inclusion in the Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and with the release of a feature-length documentary film about himself. This was titled &quot;Robert Williams, Mr. Bitchin&quot; and premiered on June 16, 2010, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where it received a standing ovation. The film was produced by Rhino Films and Foundation Films and documents Williams&#x27;s rise to fame from his car-culture and underground-comix roots.

On October 9, 2010, Williams was given a lifetime achievement award as part of the Beyond Eden Fair in Hollywood.

In 2011, Williams took part in the Los Angeles Art Fair and delivered another lecture on his art movement. His work was also included in the &quot;Two Schools of Cool&quot; show at the Orange County Museum of Art.

Williams has participated with other artists in &quot;The Art Boys,&quot; a venture which included such notables as Gary Panter, Matt Groening, The PIZZ, Mike Kelley, Neon Park, and Mark Mothersbaugh.

In 2015, Williams achieved a 51-year goal. After attending the 1964 Salvador Dalí exhibition at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, Williams vowed to have his own work displayed in the same institution. This vision was realized in &quot;Robt. Williams: Slang Aesthetics,&quot; which ran from February 22 thru April 19, 2015, setting the highest recorded attendance at over 20,000 visitors.
The exhibition included new paintings and sculptures as well as a retrospective of past works, and was accompanied by a catalog of the same name as well as a 20-year anniversary group show for &quot;Juxtapoz&quot; magazine. Thematically, Williams postulates that slang is a valid form of communication: &quot;In fact, slang represents freedom from pretension allowing artists to function as they please.&quot;

October 2019, Williams released a career-spanning book showcasing all of his paintings, drawings, and sculptures to date. &quot;Robert Williams: The Father of Exponential Imagination&quot;, comprising 484 pages and weighing over 10 pounds, was also accompanied by a full retrospective exhibition of the same name at the Bellevue Arts Museum from October 4, 2019 to March 8, 2020. Of exponential imagination, Williams states: &quot;...In the case of exponential creativity, previously existing compounded ideas pursue irrational directions as they metastasize with unmanageable poetic abstraction. In other words: a calculable explosive aberration, sometimes in the guise of art...&quot;

== Personal life ==
Williams currently lives in the San Fernando Valley in California with his wife Suzanne, who is also a professional artist.

He is also a unicyclist.

== In popular culture ==
Robert Williams was referenced in the 1991 Red Hot Chili Peppers song &quot;Mellowship Slinky in B Major&quot; on the album &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;.

Williams&#x27;s art and personal rat rod were featured in the music video for the song &quot;Who Was in My Room Last Night?&quot; from the Butthole Surfers&#x27; 1993 album &quot;Independent Worm Saloon&quot;.

Williams&#x27;s painting &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; was used as the cover art on Guns N&#x27; Roses debut album which was also given the same name as the painting after Williams approved. Later public outrage forced Geffen Records to move the image to the inside sleeve.

Another of William&#x27;s paintings is the album cover for Boogie Down Productions last record &quot;Sex and Violence&quot;.

==Critical reception==
The antics of Coochy Cooty and such paintings as &quot;Oscar Wilde in Leadville&quot; and &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; caused controversy. Here is Williams&#x27;s response, excerpted from a 1992 interview:

Of his paintings, Williams has stated, &quot;My paintings are not designed to entertain you; they are meant to trap you, to hold you before them while you try to rationalize what elements of the picture are making you stand there.&quot;

Of the term &quot;lowbrow,&quot; Williams steadfastly denies that the term was ever meant to define his work, saying that it was merely used in the title of his first book (&quot;The Lowbrow Art of Robert Williams&quot;): &quot;There was never any intention to make the title of my book the name of a fledging art movement, but over time, that seems to be what has transpired.&quot; And on being the driving force of the Lowbrow/Pop Surrealism art movement, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s been called Lowbrow Art and Pop Surrealism and a bunch of different names, but it&#x27;s a feral art. It&#x27;s an art that raised itself in the wilderness.&quot; In a 2015 phone interview, Williams emphasized: &quot;The art movement I go by is &#x27;Colloquial&#x27; or &#x27;Exploratory Realism&#x27;... &#x27;Feral Art&#x27;.&quot;

== Exhibitions and collections ==

<doc id="650353" wikidata="Q7455836" url="?curid=650353" title="SIPTU">
<text>SIPTU (; &quot;Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union&quot;; ) is Ireland&#x27;s largest trade union, with around 200,000 members. Most of these members are in the Republic of Ireland, although the union does have a Northern Ireland District Committee. Its head office, Liberty Hall, is in Dublin, and the union has five industrial divisions, three in the private sector and two in the public sector. SIPTU is affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.

==History==
The Union has its roots in two separate trade unions both founded by the trade union leader and socialist activist James Larkin; the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union and the Federated Workers&#x27; Union of Ireland. The two unions merged in 1990 to create SIPTU. The merge was first proposed in the 1950s, and almost happened in 1969.

SIPTU is a general union which organises across the public and private sectors in Ireland and has large numbers of members working in construction, health, education, transport and manufacturing. It has a long-term commitment to delivering social solidarity and has developed a leadership role in the areas of rights for unemployed persons, people with disabilities and older persons. The union, as part of promoting fairness at work and justice in society, includes migrant workers in Ireland and campaigns on the twin issues of the exploitation of migrant workers, particularly those from Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, and the consequent displacement of Irish workers from employment.

The union established an Organising Unit in 2004 and its former president, Jack O&#x27;Connor, set as his objective the transformation of SIPTU - hitherto firmly committed to a servicing agenda - into an organising union.

==Mergers==
Since its formation, several smaller unions have merged into SIPTU:

:1991: Irish National Painters&#x27; and Decorators&#x27; Trade Union
:1993: Irish Writers&#x27; Union

<doc id="650354" wikidata="Q1363307" url="?curid=650354" title="Spike Dudley">
<text>Matthew Jonathan Hyson (born August 13, 1970) is an American semi-retired professional wrestler best known for his tenure in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as Spike Dudley. Prior to WWE, Hyson began performing as Spike Dudley in the 1990s with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW); the Spike Dudley character being a member of The Dudley Brothers. As part of a storyline, fellow members Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley betrayed the faction to form a separate Dudley Boyz tag team; resulting in Hyson and members being involved in a subsequent feud with the duo.

The Dudley Boyz would eventually leave ECW for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1999. Meanwhile, Hyson remained in ECW, and during his time held two reigns as ECW World Tag Team Champion alongside Balls Mahoney. The promotion fell into bankruptcy in 2001, which led Hyson to join the WWF, where he reconciled with Ray and D-Von. Hyson would appear with his kayfabe brothers on-and-off, as well as capturing the WWF Tag Team Championship with Tazz. Hyson also held the European Championship once and Hardcore Championship eight times in 2002. He would go on to team with Ray and D-Von following this, and would then have a singles career in the promotion from 2004 to 2005, notably holding the Cruiserweight Championship.

In 2005, Hyson was released from his WWE contract. After a brief stint on the independent circuit and becoming a trainer at The Lock-Up Wrestling School, Hyson would join Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) changing his ring name to Brother Runt due to WWE retaining the Dudley trademark. He once again teamed with Ray and Devon who had joined the promotion a few months prior to him; as well as feuding with Abyss. Following his release from TNA in the summer of 2007, Hyson continued to work as a trainer, and would continue to compete on the independent circuit simply as Matt Hyson until 2010 where he stopped training and performing on a full-time basis, with his final match occurring in 2015.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1993-1996)===
In May 1993, Hyson entered All Pro Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;Boot Camp&quot; in Hayward, California to train as a referee and manager. He quickly began training to be a wrestler as well and spent the next three years wrestling for independent California promotions.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996-2001)===

Hyson debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) on September 14, 1996, at When Worlds Collide II. He was introduced as a fan favorite under the ring name &quot;Little&quot; Spike Dudley, as a part of the Dudley family. In his debut match, Spike teamed with his storyline brother Bubba Ray Dudley to defeat The Erotic Experience (GQ Gorgeous and Pat Day). He made his televised debut in ECW on the October 1 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;. His in-ring persona was that of the &quot;runt&quot; of the family. His initials LSD and finishing move, the &quot;Acid Drop&quot; were both drug references and, at times, he would stare at his hands waving in front of him as if he were on a trip.

At Crossing the Line Again on February 1, 1997, Bubba turned on the Dudley family by aligning with D-Von Dudley and hitting a &quot;Dudley Death Drop&quot; on Spike and forming the tag team The Dudley Boyz. This also resulted in Spike becoming the first recipient of the &quot;Dudley Death Drop&quot; or &quot;3D&quot;. As a result, Spike began a lengthy on-and-off scripted rivalry with them which continued for two years.

Spike would lose to Dudley Boyz&#x27; ally Axl Rotten on a few occasions at &quot;Winter Blowout&quot; and CyberSlam. During the summer of 1997, Spike teamed with Mikey Whipwreck and got involved in a mini feud with PG-13, which resulted in Dudley and Whipwreck defeating PG-13 at Heat Wave. Dudley&#x27;s first high-profile feud began with Bam Bam Bigelow when Dudley defeated Bigelow to score an upset win at Born to be Wired. He quickly gained the nickname &quot;The Giant Killer&quot;, as he would be booked to score quick wins against larger and heavier opponents. Dudley lost to Bigelow in a rematch in his pay-per-view debut at Hardcore Heaven. At As Good as It Gets, Dudley lost to Bigelow in a match. The match was notable for a very interesting moment in not only Hyson&#x27;s career but in ECW history in general, in which Bigelow threw him from the ring over the top rope and into the crowd. The fans caught him and proceeded to body surf him around the ECW Arena. This incident was incorporated into the &quot;Hardcore TV&quot; introduction for years.

Teaming with multiple people, including Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman, New Jack, and Nova, he defeated them to win the ECW World Tag Team Championship with his partner Balls Mahoney on two occasions in 1999.

He was also in the main event on some occasions, such as the 2000 Guilty as Charged pay-per-view, where he faced Mike Awesome for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, in a losing effort. During the match, however, he injured his knee, and after aggravating the injury in subsequent matches with Awesome and Lance Storm was forced to take several months off to recuperate. He returned in June 2000 as the ECW Commissioner and returned to in-ring action at the November to Remember event of that year, relinquishing his role as commissioner. Hyson stayed with ECW until it folded in 2001.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2005)===
Dudley joined the WWF in 2001, aligning with his half-brothers, Bubba Ray and D-Von. With his brothers in the middle of a three-way feud for the WWF Tag Team Championship with the Hardy Boyz and Edge &amp; Christian, Dudley frequently battled with Lita and Rhyno to try and help their respective team win (Lita managed The Hardy Boyz while Rhyno managed Edge &amp; Christian). Notably all three were heavily involved in the Tables, Ladders and Chairs (TLC) match at WrestleMania X-Seven. Although Dudley inadvertently saved Lita from being taken out by Rhyno, Dudley later took a hard chair shot to the head from Lita (who was later taken out by Bubba Ray and D-Von) and was then taken out by Jeff Hardy when he performed a Swanton Bomb off a 20-foot ladder and landed on 2 parallel tables with Rhyno on one and Dudley on the other with Jeff mostly landing on Dudley&#x27;s table.

After WrestleMania, The Dudley Boyz began a feud with The Holly Cousins. During this time, Dudley began a relationship with Molly Holly, which led to the Dudleys turning on him and putting Holly through a table. On the June 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Dudley was given his first opportunity at the WWF Championship, in a losing effort against Stone Cold Steve Austin. During The Invasion, Dudley remained loyal to WWF, despite being an ECW alumnus. It was during The Invasion that his relationship with Molly came to an end when she turned on him, aligning herself with Hurricane Helms and joining The Alliance.
Between May 2001 and January 2002, Dudley formed short-lived tag teams in an attempt to defeat his brothers. On the January 7, 2002, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Dudley and Tazz defeated The Dudley Boyz for the WWF Tag Team Championship, and successfully retained them at the Royal Rumble. Dudley next entered the Hardcore Championship picture, winning the championship eight times, including at WrestleMania X8 (though he never held the championship for more than a day, due to the &quot;24/7 rule.&quot;) He also defeated William Regal for the European Championship on the April 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, and held the championship for a month before losing it back to Regal.

As 2002 went along, Spike and Bubba began to team together again and feuded with The Un-Americans while also pursuing the WWE Tag Team Championship. By the end of the year, D-Von had rejoined his brothers, and they feuded with 3-Minute Warning. Dudley was injured after a missed spot during a 10-man tag match on &quot;Raw&quot; in September 2003. La Résistance threw Dudley to the outside but Dudley missed the table that he was supposed to crash through. After some time away from the ring, Spike returned and defeated René Duprée to get revenge for the injury.

In 2004, Dudley was drafted to the SmackDown! brand, where he immediately began challenging for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. On the July 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he defeated Rey Mysterio for the championship with interference from his brothers, thus turning into a heel. He then began to wrestle as the &quot;boss&quot; of the Dudley Boyz. The Dudleys defeated Mysterio, Billy Kidman and Paul London in a six-man tag team match at SummerSlam. He continued to defend his championship throughout the year, before eventually losing the Cruiserweight Championship to Funaki at Armageddon.

He made his last appearance with WWE at ECW One Night Stand on June 12, 2005, helping the Dudleys win their tag team match. At the event, Spike was dressed like his old ECW character (tie-dyed shirt and overalls) but still portrayed his WWE &quot;Boss&quot; character. Dudley was released from his WWE contract on July 5, 2005, along with seven other wrestlers in what was thought to have been a cost-cutting measure by the company. Bubba and D-Von also departed the company after ECW One Night Stand.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2006–2007, 2009–2014) ===
Hyson debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on the April 14, 2006, episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, preventing Eric Young from driving Brother Devon through a table and attacking each member of Team Canada. Hyson then celebrated with Brother Devon and Brother Ray, with him identifying him as &quot;Brother Spike&quot; and then &quot;Brother Runt&quot;. At Lockdown, Runt and Team 3D defeated Team Canada in a Six Sides of Steel Anthem match. Brother Runt continued to be a part of Team 3D during feud with Abyss and the James Gang and at Victory Road, Runt and Team 3D lost a six-man tag to The James Gang and Abyss. At Hard Justice, Runt lost to Abyss. On the August 31 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Runt lost to Abyss in a 10,000 Thumbtacks match.

In June 2006, Hyson represented TNA in Japan with the Hustle federation, where he, alongside Ray and Devon, defeated Kouhiro Kanemura, Masato Tanaka and Tomoaki Honma twice in 3-on-3 tag-team matches.

At UFW&#x27;s &quot;Hardcore War&quot; show, Spike stated that he had been sent a contract to compete at WWE&#x27;s ECW One Night Stand. Spike took out the contract and tore it into pieces in front of the live crowd stating that he was remaining loyal to TNA.

Through the rest of the year, Brother Runt continued to feud with Abyss and several other heavyweight wrestlers while having a short-lived alliance with Raven (Raven saved Brother Runt from being smashed through two stacked tables covered in thumbtack-covered boards from Abyss, before throwing Abyss in himself), before he turned on Raven on September 15, 2006. In September and October 2006 Hyson had formed a new look, very similar to Travis Bickle in the hit 1976 movie Taxi Driver complete with Bickle&#x27;s trademark green army jacket and mohawk. At No Surrender, Brother Runt competed in a No Disqualification 3-Way Dance which was won by Abyss, At Bound for Glory, Brother Runt competed in a fatal four way Monster&#x27;s Ball match which was won by Samoa Joe. On the December 21 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Brother Runt made his first TNA appearance in a while dressed up as Santa Claus, and was subsequently beaten down by The Latin American Xchange (LAX) until being saved by Eric Young, Sonjay Dutt, Jay Lethal, and Petey Williams. On the January 4 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Runt lost to Homicide in a Mexican Street Fight.

At Final Resolution on January 21, 2007, a drunk Brother Runt cost his Team 3D teammates their NWA World Tag Team Championship match against LAX (Latin American Exchange) by jumping onto Homicide. Runt soon returned to the April 12 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; after being attacked by LAX backstage. He was mocked by Konnan who fired a taser gun at him causing Brother Runt to roll around in pain. On August 15, 2007, Runt was released from TNA after several months of inactivity.

On April 16, 2009, Brother Runt and Balls Mahoney appeared on &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; to wish Team 3D luck in their match at Lockdown. They later were attacked by Beer Money, Inc. On March 15, 2010&#x27;s episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; in a six-man tag team match, he and Team 3D were defeated by The Nasty Boys and Jimmy Hart. On August 4, 2010, it was confirmed that Hyson would be taking part in TNA&#x27;s ECW reunion show, Hardcore Justice. At Hardcore Justice Hyson, was defeated by Rhino in a three-way match, which also included Al Snow.

On January 17, 2013, Hyson made an appearance on TNA &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; as one of Bully Ray&#x27;s groomsmen during his wedding to Brooke Hogan. He was assaulted by Aces &amp; Eights after they crashed the ceremony. On March 19, 2013, Runt appeared at TNA Hardcore Justice 2, teaming with Jeff Hardy to defeat Team 3D (Bully Ray and Devon) in a tag team tables match, which aired on July 5, 2013.

===Independent scene and sporadic appearances (2005–2015)===
Upon leaving WWE, he billed himself as Matt Hyson and performed at independent shows, mainly Top Rope Promotions in Massachusetts. He also joined the roster for Squared Circle Wrestling (2CW) in Syracuse, New York and the New York Wrestling Connection in Deer Park, New York. Hyson also went on to wrestle at Shane Douglas&#x27; Hardcore Homecoming, as well as guest featuring at shows with large amounts of talent from Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), mainly the UWF (UWF Live); this building speculation that Hyson would be signing with the TNA promotion. Whilst under contract with TNA, Hyson was permitted to continue his work for independent wrestling companies, and would use his TNA ringname Brother Runt instead of Matt Hyson.

In mid-2006, Hyson trained professional wrestlers at Top Rope Promotions in Fall River, Massachusetts until 2010.

After he parted ways with TNA, Hyson became a teacher at The Lock-Up Wrestling School, run by Top Rope Promotions, as well as performing with Big Time Wrestling (BTW). He would be billed as Spike Dudley, Brother Runt or Matt Hyson depending on the promotion.

Hyson notably reunited with Ray and Devon on the independent circuit in June 2008 for a one-off match in Danbury, Connecticut for Big Time Wrestling. This was the first time he would partner with Ray and Devon since his departing from TNA, and the penultimate time he would partner with them before the trio teamed together for the last time in 2010 on an episode of TNA Impact.

Hyson held the Big Time Wrestling Heavyweight Title from January to August 2010 when he lost the title to Shane Douglas in Webster, Massachusetts after Douglas hit Hyson with a chain. Hyson wrestled at a Real Action Wrestling event in St. Albans, Vermont on September 11, 2010, where he lost to Shane Williams. Hyson decided that he would retire from making frequent wrestling appearances after this bout, and would only work occasional shows. He had a two-year hiatus, before returning to the indie scene in 2012 for 2CW.

Hyson wrestled his last match to date in December 3, 2023, at LIVE Pro Wrestling&#x27;s Whaling City Rumble event, where he and tag team mates Little Mean Kathleen and Teddy Goodz defeated the Cosmic Cuties (Aaron Rourke, Ava Everett and LSG).

He appeared as a guest on the WWE &quot;Straight Outta Dudleyville&quot; DVD set in 2016.

== Other media ==
In the documentary &quot;Beyond the Mat&quot;, a heavily bleeding Hyson delivers the line &quot;I shall, I do,&quot; (Henry IV of England&#x27;s response to a request by Sir John Falstaff in the Shakespearean play &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;) when questioned regarding his favorite quote from Shakespeare.

Hyson made his video game debut in &quot;ECW Hardcore Revolution&quot;. He would also appear in &quot;ECW Anarchy Rulz&quot;, &quot;WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It&quot;, &quot;WWF Raw&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth&quot;, &quot;WWE Raw 2&quot;, &quot;WWE WrestleMania 21&quot; and &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006&quot;.

==Personal life==
Prior to his wrestling career, Hyson received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York. Hyson was a third-grade teacher&#x27;s assistant in San Francisco, California before getting into the wrestling business. He works as a financial transition specialist.

He and his wife, Vikki, have a daughter and son together.

<text>Count Leopoldo Cicognara (17 November 1767, in Ferrara – 5 March 1834, in Venice) was an Italian artist, art collector, art historian and bibliophile.

==Early life, education, and political career==
Cicognara attended the Collegio dei Nobili in Modena from 1776 to 1785. From 1788-1790, he attended the Societá dell&#x27;Arcadia in Rome where he studied painting under Jacob Philipp Hackert and Domenico Corvi. There he also became interested in art criticism and archeology. He later he visited Naples and Sicily, and published one of his first works of poetry in Palermo. Cicognara studied archeology during travels to Florence, Milan, Bologna and Venice.

In 1795, he moved to Modena and began a brief political career, becoming a member of the legislative body, serving as a councilor of state, and minister plenipotentiary of the Cisalpine Republic at Turin. Napoleon decorated him with the Iron Crown.

==Academic career and scholarship==
Cicognara left politics in 1805 to devote himself to art history. He settled in Venice and in 1808 was made president of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, a post in which he worked until 1826. He was influential in opening the Galleria dell’Accademia to the public in 1817, increasing the number of the professors at the academy, improving the curriculum, and establishing prizes.

In 1808, his treatise &quot;Del bello ragionamenti&quot;, which he dedicated to Napoleon, was published by Molini e Landi with the types of the famous Amoretti Brothers. Wilhelm Schlegel advised Cicognara on his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, the &quot;Storia della scultura dal suo risorgimento in Italia al secolo di Napoleone&quot;. The book was designed to complete the works of Winckelmann and D&#x27;Agincourt and is illustrated with 180 plates.

In 1814, after the fall of Napoleon, Cicognara was patronized by Francis I of Austria, and between 1815 and 1820 published, under the auspices of that sovereign, his &quot;Fabbriche più cospicue di Venezia&quot;, two folios, containing some 150 plates. Charged by the Venetians with the presentation of their gifts to the Princess Caroline Augusta of Bavaria at Vienna, Cicognara added to the offering an illustrated catalogue of the objects it comprised; this book, &quot;Omaggio delle Provincie Venete alla maestri Carolina Augusta&quot;, has since become of great value to bibliophiles.

The other works by Cicognara are the &quot;Memorie storiche de litterati ed artisti Ferraresi&quot; (1811); the &quot;Vite de&#x27; più insigni pittori e scultori Ferraresi&quot;, MS.; the &quot;Memorie spettanti alla storia della calcografia&quot; (1831); and a large number of dissertations on painting, sculpture, engraving and other kindred subjects.

In 1833, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.

== Cicognara Library ==
During his career, Cicognara collected about five thousand volumes on art and archeology, an important resource for scholars. In 1821 he published at Pisa a well-known catalog of his collection, the result of thirty years labor, the &quot;Catalogo ragionato de’ libri d’arte e di antichità&quot;. In 1824 his library was purchased &quot;en bloc&quot; by Pope Leo XII, and added to the Vatican library.

Philipp Fehl and Raina Fehl were the directors of The Leopoldo Cicognara Program at the University of Illinois Library, dedicated to the study and promulgation of literary sources in the history of art, 1987–2007. They cataloged the collection of work found in the Fondo Cicognara at the Vatican Library.

The Digital Cicognara Library is a collaborative project aiming to create an online version of the Fondo Cicognara by digitizing each title in the collection&quot;.&quot;

<text>Olympic sports are sports that are contested in the Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games. The 2024 Summer Olympics included 32 sports; the 2022 Winter Olympics included seven sports. Each Olympic sport is represented at the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by an international governing body called an International Federation (IF). 

The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo saw the introduction of four new sports, with karate, skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing making their Olympic debuts. Breakdancing made its debut at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, and ski mountaineering will make its debut at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy. Flag football and squash will make their debuts at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, while cricket and lacrosse will return after long absences.

== Early history and scope ==
From the 18th century onwards, researchers took a greater interest in the value of traditional games in elucidating cultural values and identities. The modern Olympic Games, founded by Pierre de Coubertin on the basis of &quot;All games, all nations&quot;, were influenced by this thinking; at the 1904 Summer Olympics, de Coubertin arranged &quot;Anthropological Days&quot;, which allowed athletes from Asia, Africa, and South America to demonstrate their regional games. However, the 1904 organizers marginalized this aspect of the Olympics, and it quickly faded away after a few years, with mainly only Western sports being played.

==Olympic sports definitions==
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) considers an Olympic sport to comprise all disciplines governed by an international sports federation. For example, aquatics is a summer Olympic sport that includes six disciplines: swimming, artistic swimming, diving, water polo, open water swimming, and high diving (a non-Olympic discipline), all of which are governed at international level by World Aquatics. Skating is a winter Olympic sport represented by the International Skating Union, and includes four disciplines: figure skating, speed skating, short track speed skating, and synchronized skating (a non-Olympic discipline). The sport with the largest number of Olympic disciplines is skiing, with six: alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, Nordic combined, snowboarding, and freestyle skiing.

Other notable multi-discipline sports are gymnastics (artistic, rhythmic, and trampoline), cycling (road, track, mountain, and BMX), volleyball (indoors and beach), wrestling (freestyle and Greco-Roman), canoeing (flatwater and slalom), and bobsleigh (includes skeleton). The disciplines listed here are only those contested in the Olympics—gymnastics has two non-Olympic disciplines, while cycling and wrestling have three each.

The IOC definition of a &quot;discipline&quot; may differ from that used by an international federation. For example, the IOC considers artistic gymnastics a single discipline, but the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG) classifies men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics as separate disciplines. Similarly, the IOC considers freestyle wrestling to be a single discipline, but United World Wrestling classifies women&#x27;s freestyle wrestling as the separate discipline of &quot;female wrestling&quot;.

An event, by IOC definition, is a competition that leads to the award of medals. Therefore, the sport of aquatics includes a total of 46 Olympic events, of which 32 are in the discipline of swimming, eight in diving, and two each in artistic swimming, water polo, and open water swimming. The number of events per sport ranges from a minimum of two (until 2008, there were sports with only one event) to a maximum of 47 in athletics, which despite its large number of diverse events is not divided into separate disciplines like aquatics is.

== Criteria for inclusion and thresholds ==
Sports eligible for inclusion in the Olympic programme are only those governed by international federations recognized by the IOC, as stated in Bye-laws 1.3.2 and 1.4.2 to Rule 45 of the Olympic Charter (2023). The opportunity to propose additional sports to the programme is at the full discretion of the respective Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and subject to the final decision of the IOC Session.

In the past, several criteria concerning widely practiced sports, disciplines or events have been abolished. However, the number of sports remains constrained by athlete and event limits. According to Bye-law 3.2 to Rule 45 of the Olympic Charter (2023), Summer Olympics should be approximately limited to 10,500 athletes, 5,000 coaches and support personnel and 310 events, while Winter Olympics should be capped at around 2,900 athletes, 2,000 coaches and support personnel and 100 events, unless agreed to otherwise by the Organizing Committee. These thresholds are likely to be surpassed for the 2028 Summer Olympics; sports director Kit McConnell stated that they would aim to &quot;limit the increase, but limit the impact on the existing sport&quot;.

In previous years, sports that depend primarily on mechanical propulsion, such as motor sports, could not be considered for recognition as Olympic sports, though there were power-boating events in 1908 before this rule was enacted by the IOC. The rule excluding motorsports was removed from the Olympic Charter in 2016. The FIA (governing body for automobile sports), FIM (governing body for motorcycle sports) and FAI (governing body for air sports) are recognised by the International Olympic Committee, and therefore, in theory, could be eligible for inclusion at future Olympic Games.

==Changes in Olympic sports==

The list of Olympic sports has changed considerably during the course of Olympic history, and has gradually increased over time. 
The Olympic Charter decrees that Olympic sports for each edition of the Olympic Games should be decided at an IOC Session no later than seven years prior to the Games.

The only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic program are athletics, aquatics (swimming), cycling, fencing, and gymnastics (artistic gymnastics). The only winter sports that were included in all Winter Olympic Games are skiing (nordic skiing), skating (figure skating and speed skating), and ice hockey. Figure skating and ice hockey were also included in the Summer Olympics (in 1908 and 1920) before the Winter Olympics were introduced in 1924.

Early Olympic Games prior to World War II included eight sports that have since been discontinued from the Olympics: basque pelota, croquet, jeu de paume, polo, rackets, roque, tug of war and water motorsports. Organizers were able to decide which sports or disciplines were included on the program from 1896 to 1920, with the IOC taking control of the program in 1924. As a result, a number of sports were on the Olympic program for relatively brief periods: of the eight discontinued early Olympic sports, the only one on the program after 1920 was polo (in 1924 and 1936). These sports were removed because of lack of interest or the absence of an appropriate governing body, and are considered unlikely to ever return.

Five early Olympic sports that were removed by the IOC have managed to return to the Olympic program: archery in 1972, tennis in 1988, curling in 1998, golf in 2016 and cricket in 2028. Further, three other early Olympic sports returned in a different format from which they were originally competed in: handball in 1972 (as indoor handball instead of field handball), rugby in 2016 (as rugby sevens instead of rugby union), and lacrosse in 2028 (as lacrosse sixes instead of field lacrosse).

For most of the 20th century, the Olympics included one or more demonstration sports, normally to promote a local sport from the host country or to gauge interest in an entirely new sport. Some such sports, like baseball and curling, were later added to the official Olympic program (in 1992 and 1998, respectively). The competitions and ceremonies in these sports were identical to official Olympic sports, except that the medals were not counted in the official record. On some occasions, both official medal events and demonstration events have been contested in the same sport at the same Games, such as men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s judo in 1988. Due to logistical issues, the International Olympic Committee decided in 1989 to eliminate demonstration sports from the Olympic Games after 1992. An unofficial exception was made in 2008, when the Beijing Organizing Committee received permission to organize a wushu tournament.

Women first competed in the 1900 Olympic Games, participating in five sports (croquet, sailing, tennis, golf and equestrian). With the addition of women&#x27;s boxing in 2012 and women&#x27;s ski jumping in 2014, women can now compete in all Olympic disciplines except for Greco-Roman wrestling and nordic combined; there are also two women-only disciplines, rhythmic gymnastics and artistic swimming.

===Changes since 2000===
The sports of baseball and softball were both voted off the program by the IOC Session in Singapore on 11 July 2005, a decision that was reaffirmed on 9 February 2006. Baseball and softball, before their reinstatement for the 2020 Olympics, were last included in 2008: therefore, the number of sports in the 2012 Summer Olympics was dropped from 28 to 26. This was the first time a sport or discipline had been removed from the Olympic program since canoe slalom after 1972 (though it returned in 1992).

Two previously long-discontinued sports, golf (last competed in 1904) and rugby (last competed in 1924), returned for the 2016 Summer Olympics. On 13 August 2009, the IOC Executive Board proposed that golf and rugby sevens be added to the Olympic program for 2016. On 9 October 2009, during the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, the IOC voted to admit both as official Olympic sports and to include them in the 2016 Summer Olympics. The IOC voted 81–8 in favor of rugby sevens and 63–27 in favor of golf, thus bringing the number of sports back to 28.

In February 2013, the IOC considered dropping a sport from the 2020 Summer Olympics to make way for a new sport: modern pentathlon and taekwondo were thought to be vulnerable, but instead the IOC recommended removing wrestling. On 8 September 2013, the IOC added wrestling to the 2020 and 2024 Summer Games.

Starting with the 2020 Games, the IOC altered the way it plans the Olympic sports program: rather than basing it on a maximum number of &quot;sports&quot;, the total number of &quot;events&quot; are now taken into account, opening the schedule up for the inclusion on a per-Games basis of additional sports to the 28 &quot;core&quot; sports. For the 2020 Summer Olympics, the local organizing committee was thus permitted to add five sports to the program in addition to the existing 28, taking the total to 33. Baseball and softball have been treated by the IOC as a single sport since the governing bodies for baseball and softball merged into a single international federation, the World Baseball Softball Confederation, in 2013 (with male athletes competing in baseball and female athletes competing in softball). On 3 August 2016, the IOC voted to add baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding as optional sports for the 2020 Summer Olympics.

On 21 February 2019, the Paris 2024 Organising Committee announced they would propose the inclusion of breakdancing (breaking), as well as skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing. All four sports were approved during the 134th IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland on 24 June 2019.

On 18 June 2021, the IOC issued a proposal for a new winter sport, ski mountaineering, for the 2026 Winter Olympics. The proposal was approved during the IOC&#x27;s session in Tokyo on 20 July.

On 3 February 2022, the IOC designated skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing to be core Summer Olympic sports starting in 2028, raising the number of core sports to 31. On 16 October 2023, the IOC approved the addition of five optional sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics: baseball/softball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash, while breakdancing was dropped. Cricket&#x27;s only previous Olympic appearance was in 1900, while lacrosse was last on the Olympic program in 1908.

==Summer Olympics==

At the first Olympic Games, ten sports were contested. Since then, the number of sports contested at the Summer Olympic Games has gradually risen to thirty-six on the program for 2028.

In order for a sport or discipline to be considered for inclusion in the list of Summer Olympic sports, it must be widely practiced in at least 75 countries, spread over four continents.

As of 2013, Summer Olympic sports were divided into categories based on popularity, which determined the share each sport&#x27;s International Federation received of Olympic revenue.

===Current and discontinued summer program===
The following sports (and disciplines) make up the current and discontinued Summer Olympic Games official program and are listed alphabetically according to the name used by the IOC. The figures in each cell indicate the number of events for each sport contested at the respective Games; a bullet () denotes that the sport was contested as a demonstration or unofficial sport.

Eight of the 32 sports at the 2024 Summer Olympics consist of multiple disciplines. Each discipline is marked with a unique 3-character identifier code by the IOC.



===Feats and artistic events===
Art competitions were held between the 1912 and 1948 Games, and medals were awarded. In 1952, art competition medals were removed from the official national medal counts. Olympic medals have also been awarded for feats of alpinism and aeronautics.
* Aeronautics (1936)
* Alpinism (1924, 1932, 1936)
* Art competitions (1912–1948)

===Demonstration summer sports===

Between 1924 and 1992, the IOC officially recognized demonstration sports, allowing host countries to organize demonstrations of non-Olympic sports during the Games; no demonstration sports were held in 1976 or 1980 due to the IOC temporarily eliminating them.

The following sports or disciplines have been demonstration sports at the Summer Olympic Games for the years shown, but have never been included on the Olympic program as a medal event.

* American football (1932)
* Australian football (1956)
* Budō (1964)
* Gliding (1936)
* Korfball (1928)
* La canne (1924)
* Pesäpallo (1952)
* Roller hockey (1992)
* Savate (1924)
* Swedish (Ling) gymnastics (1948)
* Water skiing (1972)

American football (1904) and Korfball (1920) first appeared as unofficial sports before becoming demonstration sports.

Gliding was promoted from a demonstration sport to an official Olympic sport for the 1940 Summer Olympics, but the Games were cancelled due to World War II. Flag football, a non-contact version of American football, will make its Olympic debut in 2028.

===Unofficial summer sports===
Several sports, while not officially recognized by the IOC as demonstration sports, have nonetheless been held alongside or as part of the Olympic program. Events held during Games prior to 1924 are considered demonstration sports by some scholars, though not by the IOC. Bowling at the 1988 Games (along with badminton) was considered an exhibition sport in that it was not part of the official Olympic schedule and did not require IOC approval for staging, unlike demonstration sports.

Organizers of the 1900 and 1904 Olympic Games, which were staged in conjunction with the 1900 and 1904 World&#x27;s Fairs, included numerous sporting events on an equal footing under their programmes. Historians generally regard many of these as not satisfying retrospective inclusion criteria to qualify as &quot;official&quot;. Through 1995, the IOC never made a determination regarding which events were Olympic and which were not, although the present IOC website generally conforms to historians&#x27; views.

* Angling (1900)
* Ballooning (1900)
* Boules (1900)
* Bowling (1988)
* Cannon shooting (1900)
* Chess (2000)
* Cycle polo (1908)
* Fire fighting (1900)
* Gaelic football (1904)
* Glima (1908, 1912)
* Gotland sports (1912)
* Hurling (1904)
* Indian sports (1936)
* Kaatsen (1928)
* Kite flying (1900)
* Life saving (1900)
* Longue paume (1900)
* Military exercise (1900)
* Motor racing (1900, 1936)
* Motorcycle racing (1900)
* Pigeon racing (1900)
* Pistol dueling (1906, 1908)
* Wheelchair racing (1984–2004)
* Wushu (1936, 2008)
==Winter Olympics==

Before 1924, ice sports like figure skating and ice hockey were held at the Summer Olympic Games. These two sports made their debuts at the 1908 and the 1920 Summer Olympics respectively, but in 1924 they were moved to the first edition of the Winter Olympic Games and became permanent fixtures on the sports program for the Winter Olympics from then on.

The 1924 &quot;International Winter Sports Week&quot;, later dubbed the first Olympic Winter Games and retroactively recognized as such by the IOC, consisted of nine disciplines in six sports.

A sport or discipline must be widely practised in at least 25 countries, and on three continents, to be eligible for inclusion on the Olympic program for the Winter Games.

===Current winter program===

The following sports (or disciplines of a sport) make up the current Winter Olympic Games official program and are listed alphabetically, according to the name used by the IOC. The figures in each cell indicate the number of events for each sport that were contested at the respective Games (the red cells indicate that those sports were held at the Summer Games); a bullet () denotes that the sport was contested as a demonstration or unofficial sport.

Three out of the eight sports consist of multiple disciplines.



===Demonstration winter sports===

The following sports or disciplines have been demonstration sports at the Winter Olympic Games for the years shown, but have never been included on the Olympic program as a medal event.

* Bandy (1952)
* Ice stock sport (1936, 1964)
* Ski ballet (acroski) (1988, 1992)
* Skijoring (1928)
* Sled-dog racing (1932)
* Speed skiing (1992)
* Winter pentathlon (1948)
===Unofficial winter sports===
* Disabled skiing (1984, 1988)

==Recognized international federations==
Many sports have their governing bodies recognized by the IOC, but are not contested at the Olympics. 

Such sports, if eligible under the terms of the Olympic Charter, may apply for inclusion in the program at future Games, through a recommendation by the IOC Olympic Programme Commission, followed by a decision of the IOC Executive Board and a vote of the IOC Session. When Olympic demonstration sports took place, a sport usually appeared as such before being officially admitted.

An International Sport Federation (IF) is responsible for ensuring that the sport&#x27;s activities follow the Olympic Charter. When a sport is recognized by the IOC, the IF becomes an official Olympic sport federation and joins either the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF, for summer Olympic sports), the Association of International Olympic Winter Sports Federations (AIOWF, for winter Olympic sports), or the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF, for non-Olympic sports).

A number of recognized sports are included in the program of the World Games, a multi-sport event run by the International World Games Association, an organization that operates under the patronage of the IOC. Since the start of the World Games in 1981, 16 sports and disciplines that have been competed there – badminton and baseball (1992), beach volleyball and softball (1996), taekwondo, trampoline, triathlon, women&#x27;s water polo and women&#x27;s weightlifting (2000), rugby sevens (2016), karate and sport climbing (2020), breakdancing (2024), and flag football, lacrosse sixes and squash (2028) – have subsequently been added to the Olympic program.

The governing bodies of the following sports currently not contested at the Olympic Games are recognized by the IOC:
* Air sports1
* Auto racing
* Bandy
* Billiard sports1
* Boules1
* Bowling
* Bridge
* Cheerleading1
* Chess
* Dancesport1,2
* Floorball1
* Flying disc1
* Ice stock sport
* Karate1,2
* Kickboxing1
* Korfball1
* Lifesaving1
* Motorcycle racing
* Mountaineering and climbing
* Muaythai1
* Netball
* Orienteering1
* Pelota vasca2
* Polo2
* Powerboating1,2
* Racquetball1
* Sambo
* Sumo
* Tug of war1,2
* Underwater sports1 
* Water skiing and wakeboarding1,3
* Wushu1
1 Official sport at the World Games.
2 Discontinued Olympic sport.
3 Water skiing and wakeboarding share the same governing body.

A sport can be contested at the Olympics even if most of its disciplines are not. For example, roller sports (governed by World Skate) are represented at the Olympics by skateboarding, but other disciplines such as inline skating or roller skating have not yet been added.

In addition, though not a sporting federation, the International Paralympic Committee, which hosts the annual Paralympic Games following the Olympics, is recognized by the IOC.

<doc id="650361" wikidata="Q699705" url="?curid=650361" title="George Williams (philanthropist)">
<text>Sir George Williams (11 October 1821 – 6 November 1905) was an English philanthropist, businessman and founder of the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA). The oldest and largest youth charity in the world, its aim is to support young people to belong, contribute and thrive in their communities.

Williams was knighted by Queen Victoria in her 1894 Birthday Honours. He died in 1905 and is buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Early life and education==
Williams was born on a farm in Dulverton, Somerset, England, as the youngest of seven surviving sons of Amos Williams and Elizabeth Vickery. He was baptised into the Church of England. He came from several generations of farmers in Somerset, and attended Gloyn&#x27;s in Tiverton, Devon until he was age 13, when he began working on his family farm. As a young man, he described himself as a &quot;careless, thoughtless, godless, swearing young fellow&quot;. For unknown reasons, his family sent him to Bridgwater to be an apprentice at Henry William Holmes&#x27; draper shop. In 1837, Williams converted from Anglicanism to Congregationalism. He went to the Zion Congregational Church and became an involved member.

==Works==
In 1841, he went to London and worked as an apprentice at Hitchcock &amp; Rogers, a draper&#x27;s shop, and became a member of the King&#x27;s Weigh House Congregational Church, using his time for evangelisation. After three years, in 1844, Williams was promoted to department manager. He married the owner George Hitchcock&#x27;s daughter, Helen Jane Maunder Hitchcock in 1853, and was taken into partnership at the drapers, renaming to George Hitchcock, Williams &amp; Co. When Hitchcock died in 1863, Williams became the sole owner of the firm.

Hitchcock and Williams had seven children; his son Albert, a solicitor, would go on to marry the granddaughter of Thomas Cook. Williams&#x27;s nephew John Williams married the only child of his lifelong London friend, Matthew Hodder, founder of British publisher Hodder &amp; Stoughton.

In 1868, Williams offered to contribute towards the election expenses of Charles Reed. When Williams died on 6 November 1905 at the Victoria and Albert Hotel, Torquay, England, he was president for societies including Band of Hope, London City Mission, Railway Mission and YWCA.

His funeral took place at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 14 November 1905, with 2,600 people in attendance and is commemorated with a bust atop his family vault at Highgate Cemetery (west).

== Founding of YMCA ==
Appalled by the terrible conditions in London for young working men, on 6 June 1844 Williams gathered a group of 11 fellow drapers in the living quarters of Hitchcock &amp; Rogers to create a place that would not tempt young men into sin. They were James Smith (from W. D. Owen drapers), Christopher W. Smith, Norton Smith, Edward Valentine, Edward Beaumont, M. Glasson, William Creese, Francis John Crockett, E. Rogers, John Harvey and John Christian Symons.

The name, Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA), was settled on at the suggestion of Christopher W. Smith, a fellow draper at Hitchcock &amp; Rogers. It promoted Muscular Christianity. One of the earliest converts and contributors to the new association was George&#x27;s employer, George Hitchcock, who was the organisation&#x27;s first treasurer.

==Honours==
Williams was knighted by Queen Victoria in her 1894 Birthday Honours, YMCA&#x27;s silver jubilee year, as well as receiving the Freedom of the City of London. After his death in 1905, he was commemorated by a stained-glass window in the nave of Westminster Abbey. Sir George Williams is buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Sir George Williams University in Montreal, which was founded by YMCA, was named in commemoration of Williams; it was later merged into Concordia University, with its former campus retaining the name Sir George Williams Campus. George Williams College, located on the shores of Geneva Lake in Wisconsin, USA, is a satellite of Aurora University, and is also named after Williams.

Williams House in YMCA of Hong Kong Christian College, which was founded by YMCA of Hong Kong, was named in commemoration of Williams.

<text>Jean Baptiste Louis George Seroux D&#x27;Agincourt (5 April 1730 – 24 September 1814) was a French archaeologist and historian.

Born in Beauvais, he was a descendant of the counts of Namur, and in his youth he served as an officer in a regiment of cavalry. Finding it necessary to quit the army in order to take charge of his younger brothers who had been left orphans, he was appointed a farmer-general by Louis XV. In 1777 he visited England, Germany and the Dutch Republic; and in the following year he travelled through Italy, with the view of exploring thoroughly the remains of ancient art. He afterwards settled in Rome and devoted himself to preparing the results of his researches for publication.

He died in 1814, leaving the work, which was being issued in parts, unfinished; but it was carried on by M. Gence, and published complete under the title &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de l&#x27;Art par les monuments, depuis sa décadence au quatrième siècle jusqu&#x27;à son renouvellement au seizième&quot; (6 vols. fol. with 325 plates, Paris, 1823). In the year of his death D&#x27;Agincourt published in Paris a &quot;Recueil de fragments de sculpture antique, en terre cuite&quot;.

<doc id="650379" wikidata="Q456751" url="?curid=650379" title="Giacinto Scelsi">
<text>Giacinto Francesco Maria Scelsi (; 8 January 1905 – 9 August 1988, sometimes cited as 8 August 1988) was an Italian composer who also wrote surrealist poetry in French.

He is best known for having composed music based around only one pitch, altered in all manners through microtonal oscillations, harmonic allusions, and changes in timbre and dynamics, as paradigmatically exemplified in his &quot;Quattro pezzi su una nota sola&quot; (&quot;Four Pieces on a single note&quot;, 1959). This composition remains his most famous work and one of the few performed to significant recognition during his lifetime. His musical output, which encompassed all Western classical genres except scenic music, remained largely undiscovered even within contemporary musical circles during most of his life. Today, some of his music has gained popularity in certain postmodern composition circles, with pieces like his &quot;Anahit&quot; and his String Quartets rising to increased prominence.

Scelsi collaborated with American composers including John Cage, Morton Feldman, and Earle Brown, as well as being a friend and a mentor to Alvin Curran. His work was a source of inspiration to Ennio Morricone&#x27;s Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza, and his music influenced composers like Tristan Murail and Solange Ancona.

==Life==
Born in the village of Pitelli near La Spezia, Scelsi spent most of his time in his mother&#x27;s old castle where he received education from a private tutor who taught him Latin, chess and fencing. Later, his family moved to Rome and his musical talents were encouraged by private lessons with Giacinto Sallustio. In Vienna, he studied with Walther Klein, a pupil of Arnold Schoenberg. He became the first exponent of dodecaphony in Italy, although he did not continue to use this system.

In the 1920s, Scelsi made friends with intellectuals like Jean Cocteau and Virginia Woolf, and traveled abroad extensively. He first came into contact with non-European music in Egypt in 1927. His first composition was &quot;Chemin du coeur&quot; (1929). Then followed &quot;Rotativa&quot;, first conducted by Pierre Monteux at Salle Pleyel, Paris, on 20 December 1931.

In 1937, he organised a series of concerts of contemporary works, introducing the music of (among others) Paul Hindemith, Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Sergei Prokofiev to an Italian audience for the first time. Due to the enforcement of racial laws under the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, which prevented the performance of works by Jewish composers, these concerts did not continue for long. Scelsi refused to comply, and gradually distanced himself from Italy. In 1940, when Italy entered the war, Scelsi was in Switzerland, where he remained until the end of the conflict, composing and honing his conception of music. He married Dorothy Kate Ramsden, a divorced Englishwoman.

Back in Rome after the war, his wife left him (eventually inspiring &quot;Elegia per Ty&quot;), and he underwent a profound psychological crisis that eventually led him to the discovery of Eastern spirituality, and also to a radical transformation of his view of music. In this so-called second period, he rejected the notions of composition and authorship in favour of sheer improvisation. His improvisations were recorded on tape and later transcribed by collaborators under his guidance. They were then orchestrated and filled out by his meticulous performance instructions, or adjusted from time to time in close collaboration with the performers.

Scelsi came to conceive of artistic creation as a means of communicating a higher, transcendent reality to the listener. In this view, the artist is considered a mere intermediary. For this reason, Scelsi never allowed his image to be shown in connection with his music; he preferred instead to identify himself by a line under a circle, as a symbol of Eastern provenance. Some photographs of Scelsi have emerged since his death.

One of the earliest interpreters Scelsi closely worked with was the singer Michiko Hirayama, whom he met in 1957 in Rome. From 1962 to 1972 he wrote the extensive song cycle &quot;Canti del Capricorno&quot; directly for her in view of her special and unique vocal range. The writing process of the piece set an example for Scelsi&#x27;s very personal way of working: developing pieces through improvisation, recording, and then making a final transcription.

From the late 1970s, Scelsi met several leading interpreters, such as the Arditti String Quartet, the cellist Frances-Marie Uitti, and the pianists Yvar Mikhashoff and Marianne Schroeder, who have promoted his music all over the world and gradually opened the gates to wider audiences.

Scelsi was a friend and a mentor to Alvin Curran (whose &quot;VSTO&quot; is a tribute) and other immigrant American composers such as Frederic Rzewski who were residing in Rome during the 1960s. Scelsi also collaborated with other American composers including John Cage, Morton Feldman, and Earle Brown (who visited him in Rome).

Frances-Marie Uitti, dedicatee of all Scelsi&#x27;s cello works, collaborated intensively with him for over 10 years editing and then recording La Trilogia, a massive 3 part work of 45 minutes in length which Morton Feldman called his &quot;autobiography in sound&quot;. It was first premiered in Festival di Como, and recorded on Fore records (Raretone) with Scelsi in the studio and later for Etcetera Records. A more recent acclaimed version with several of the Latin Prayers is to be found on ECM under the title Natura Renovatur.
Uitti also transcribed many of the chamber works for contrabass, contrabass and cello, viola, and two improvisations based on the ondiolina tapes that are found under the title Voyages.

Alvin Curran recalled that: &quot;Scelsi ... came to all my concerts in Rome even right up to the very last one I gave just a few days before he died. This was in the summer time, and he was such a nut about being outdoors. He was there in a fur coat and a fur hat. It was an outdoor concert. He waved from a distance, beautiful sparking eyes and smile that he always had, and that&#x27;s the last time I saw him&quot; (Ross, 2005).

Scelsi died of a cerebral hemorrhage on 8 August 1988, in Rome.

==Music==

Scelsi remained largely unknown for most of his career. A series of concerts in the mid to late 1980s finally premiered many of his pieces to great acclaim, notably his orchestral masterpieces in October 1987 in Cologne, about a quarter of a century after those works had been composed and less than a year before the composer&#x27;s death. Scelsi was able to attend the premieres and personally supervised the rehearsals. The impact caused by the late discovery of Scelsi&#x27;s works was described by Belgian musicologist Harry Halbreich:

Scelsi was also an idol of Ennio Morricone&#x27;s Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza, whose sixteen-minute track &#x27;Omaggio a Giacinto Scelsi&#x27; features on their live album &#x27;Musica Su Schemi&#x27;, released in 1976.

The music of Scelsi was heard by millions in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, in which excerpts of his two works &quot;Quattro pezzi su una nota sola&quot; and &quot;Uaxuctum&quot; (3rd movement) were featured alongside the music of his contemporaries György Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, John Cage and Morton Feldman.

Scelsi&#x27;s archives are held at the Isabella Scelsi Foundation.

<doc id="650383" wikidata="Q1066666" url="?curid=650383" title="Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg">
<text>Abbé Charles-Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg (8 September 1814 – 8 January 1874) was a noted French writer, ethnographer, historian, archaeologist, and Catholic priest. He became a specialist in Mesoamerican studies, travelling extensively in the region. 
His writings, publications, and recovery of historical documents contributed much to knowledge of the region&#x27;s languages, writing, history and culture, particularly those of the Maya and Aztec civilizations. However, his speculations concerning relationships between the ancient Maya and the lost continent of Atlantis inspired Ignatius L. Donnelly and encouraged the pseudo-science of Mayanism.

== Early life and writings ==
He was born in Bourbourg, a small town with many Flemish influences near Dunkirk, France, as the First French Empire was ending.

As a youth he went to Ghent in newly independent Belgium to study theology and philosophy. He became interested in writing during his studies there. Enthusiastic about Flanders&#x27; history, he wrote several essays about local folklore, which enabled him to enter literary circles. In 1837 aged 23, Brasseur traveled to Paris with supported by French poet Alphonse-Marie-Louis de Prat Lamartine&#x27;s, and became involved with political newspapers that sought the democratization of power such as . During this time, he began contributing essays to a Parisian journal. He wrote several historical accounts (using a pseudonym), including one concerning Jerusalem. He published several novels of Romantic style which was then very much in vogue. One of these, &quot;Le Sérapéon&quot;, received reviews which implied it had a very close resemblance to François-René de Chateaubriand&#x27;s 1809 novel &quot;Les Martyrs&quot;. Such near-allegations of plagiarism and inaccuracies in his works were to be made several times during his career.

Despite such criticisms, his reputation as a notable young writer and intellectual continued to develop. He transferred his studies and residence to Rome, where in 1845 he was ordained into the Roman Catholic priesthood, at the age of 30.

== Dispatched to Quebec ==
A year previously he had come to the attention of the Canadian Abbé, Léon Gingras, whom he had met (and apparently impressed) in Rome. Abbé Gingras entreated his friend and colleague the vicar-general of Quebec, Abbé Charles-Félix Cazeau, to have Brasseur de Bourbourg assigned to a job in the seminary there. Correspondence began in late 1844, with Abbé Gingras claiming that the seminary should &quot;...move heaven and earth to ensure that such a splendid bird does not escape us and fly to Montreal, where it would be so highly thought of&quot;.

A year later after having obtained his ordination, Brasseur de Bourbourg&#x27;s job in Quebec was approved by the Archbishop, Joseph Signay, and in the autumn of 1845 he left Europe for the British colony of the Province of Canada, stopping briefly in Boston along the way.

Upon his arrival in Quebec City he began work as a professor of ecclesiastical history at the seminary (the Séminaire de Québec, founded in 1663). After only a brief time however, his series of lectures was discontinued, for some unspecified reason.

Perhaps having extra time, Brasseur de Bourbourg began a programme of research of the history of the archdiocese of Quebec, and in particular of its 17th-century founder, François de Laval, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Quebec (after whom the seminary&#x27;s later incarnation as a University, the Université Laval, is named). The results of his archival investigations were published in early 1846 as a biography of Laval. The contents of this pamphlet seemed to displease his Canadian colleagues somewhat, for a dispute began which made his position there uncertain, or at least uncomfortable. Also, he apparently disliked the harsh winter climate (to judge by some comments he made in the dedication of his later &quot;History of Canada&quot;), and may also have been a factor in his departure which was soon to ensue.

He left the seminary later in that year, returning to Boston where he found a job with the diocese of Boston. The then current bishop, John Bernard Fitzpatrick, with whom he was evidently on better terms than with his previous superiors, made him vicar-general of the diocese.

Towards the end of the year Brasseur de Bourbourg returned to Europe, to spend some time conducting research in the archives of Rome and Madrid, in preparation for a new project—travel to Central America.

== Travels and expeditions to Central America ==

From 1848 to 1863 he travelled extensively as a missionary in many parts of Mexico and Central America.

During these journeys he gave great attention to Mesoamerican antiquities and became well-versed in the then-current theories and knowledge about the history of the region and the Pre-Columbian civilisations whose sites and monuments remained, yet were little understood.

Using information he had collected during his time spent travelling there, as well as that compiled by other scholars of his time, he published during 1857–1859 a history of the Aztec civilization, containing what was then known or speculated about the former kingdom, which had been conquered some three hundred years previously by the Spanish conquistadores in alliance with local enemies of the Aztecs.

He also conducted research into the local languages and their transliteration into the Latin alphabet. Between 1861 and 1864 he edited and published a collection of documents in the indigenous languages.

In 1864 he was archaeologist of the French military expedition in Mexico, and his resulting work &quot;Monuments anciens du Mexique&quot; was published by the French Government in 1866.

== Discovery of de Landa&#x27;s work ==
In 1862 while searching through archives at the Royal Academy of History in Madrid for New World materials, he came across an abridged copy of a manuscript which had originally been written by the Spanish cleric Diego de Landa sometime around 1566. De Landa had been one of those charged with disseminating the Roman Catholic faith amongst the Maya peoples in Spain&#x27;s new Central American possessions during the period after the Spanish conquest of Yucatán, and had lived there for several years. His manuscript (&quot;Relación de las Cosas de Yucatán&quot;) had been written upon his enforced return to Spain, where he was charged with illegally or improperly conducting an Inquisition (he was later absolved, returning to the New World as the appointed Bishop of Yucatán). In the manuscript de Landa had recorded much information about the Maya peoples and customs, based on his own observations and discussions with Mayan informants. Brasseur de Bourbourg&#x27;s main interest in the document, however, was a section in which de Landa reproduced what he termed &quot;an alphabet&quot; of the as-yet undeciphered Maya hieroglyphics, the writing system of the ancient Maya civilization. In this passage de Landa had annotated the Mayan symbols (or glyphs) which supposedly corresponded to the letters of the Spanish alphabet, as given to him by a Maya informant who he had quizzed. Brasseur de Bourbourg realised that this could prove to be basis of deciphering the Maya script, and he announced this discovery when republishing the manuscript (in a bilingual Spanish-French edition) in late 1863 with the title, &quot;Relation des choses de Yucatán de Diego de Landa&quot;.

However, upon initial analysis by Brasseur de Bourbourg and others, the so-called &quot;de Landa alphabet&quot; proved to be problematic and inconsistent, and these immediate attempts to use this alphabet as a kind of &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; to read the glyphs failed. Nevertheless, Brasseur de Bourbourg&#x27;s uncovering of this document and de Landa&#x27;s alphabet would much later prove to be vital in the eventual decipherment of the Maya glyphs. Brasseur de Bourbourg&#x27;s attempts, and those of others which followed, were misled insofar as they interpreted the signs alphabetically. When the signs were recognised to be mainly syllabic, significant progress was made.

== Publication of the Popol Vuh ==
In 1861 he published another significant work: a French translation of the Popol Vuh, a sacred book of the Quiché (Kʼicheʼ) Maya people. He included a grammar of the Kʼicheʼ language and an essay on Central American mythology.

== Speculations concerning Atlantis ==
Brasseur began to write about Atlantis in his publication &quot;Grammaire de la langue quichée&quot; (1862), in which he expressed his belief that the lost land described by Plato had existed with an advanced degree of civilization before the beginning of civilizations in Europe and Asia. He suggested that the origins of European and Persian words could be traced to indigenous languages of the Americas and that the ancient cultures of the New and Old Worlds had been in constant communication with one another.

In 1866, &quot;Monuments anciens du Mexique (Palenque, et autres ruines de l&#x27;ancienne civilisation du Mexique)&quot; was published with a text by Brasseur de Bourbourg accompanied by lavish illustrations by Jean-Frédéric Waldeck. Although Waldeck&#x27;s depictions of the ruins at Palenque were based on first-hand knowledge, his artistic reconstructions and embellishments implied a close relationship between Maya art and architecture and that of Classical antiquity Greece and Rome. This was subsequently demonstrated to be spurious, but not before Waldeck&#x27;s artwork had inspired speculations about contact between New and Old World civilizations, specifically via the lost continent of Atlantis.

These speculations were reinforced by Brasseur de Bourboug&#x27;s own references to Plato&#x27;s descriptions of the culture and society of Atlantis, which Brasseur believed was continued by ancient Maya civilization, in his book &quot;Quatre Lettres sur le Méxique&quot; (1868). In this publication, Brasseur de Bourbourg made extensive parallels between Maya and Egyptian pantheons and cosmologies, implying that they all had a common source on the lost continent of Atlantis. He developed these ideas further in his publication &quot;Quatre lettres sur le Mexique&quot; (1868), which presents a history of Atlantis based on his interpretation of Maya myths. His writings inspired Augustus Le Plongeon and also Ignatius L. Donnelly, whose book &quot;&quot; contains numerous references to Brasseur de Bourbourg&#x27;s scholarship. However, an academic wrote in 1875 that not a single contemporary scholar accepted Brasseur de Bourbourg&#x27;s theories about Atlantis.

The combination of Brasseur de Bourbourg&#x27;s interests in spiritualism and these speculations about relations between the ancient Maya and Atlantis provided the basis for Mayanism.

== Identification of a Maya codex ==
In 1866, Brasseur de Bourbourg had an opportunity to examine an artefact in Madrid which was in the possession of a Spanish paleography professor named Juan de Tro y Ortolano, who had purchased it some six years earlier. This artefact was an old codex, a book made from paper-bark in the form of a folded screen of continuous pages, several metres in length when extended. The codex contained numerous signs and drawings, which Brasseur de Bourbourg was readily able to identify as being Mayan in origin, having seen and studied many similar markings and glyphs while in Central America.

Tro y Ortolano gave him permission to publish the codex in a reproduction, and Brasseur de Bourbourg gave it the name &quot;Troano Codex&quot; in his honour. His identification of the codex was significant, as it was the only third such Maya codex to have been uncovered (the second, the Codex Paris, had been discovered by the French scholar Léon de Rosny only a few years before). In particular, Brasseur de Bourbourg recognised its exceeding rarity, since de Landa&#x27;s &quot;Relación&quot;, which he had earlier rediscovered, gave an account of how he had ordered the destruction of all such Maya codices he could find, and many volumes had been burned.

During 1869–1870 Brasseur de Bourbourg published his analyses and interpretations of the content of the Troano codex in his work &quot;Manuscrit Troano, études sur le système graphique et la langue des Mayas&quot;. He proposed some translations for the glyphs recorded in the codex, in part based on the associated pictures and in part on de Landa&#x27;s alphabet, but his efforts were tentative and largely unsuccessful.

However, his translation would later inspire Augustus Le Plongeon&#x27;s pseudo-science and speculation about the lost continent of Mu. The name &quot;Mu&quot; was actually used first by Brasseur de Bourbourg.

A few years later, another Maya codex was found possessed by another collector, which became known as the &quot;Codex Cortesianus&quot; (in the belief that it had been in the possession of Hernán Cortés). When Léon de Rosny examined it later, he determined that it was actually a part of the Troano codex, the two parts having been separated at some indeterminate time in the past. The two parts were later rejoined and are known collectively as the Codex &quot;Madrid&quot; or &quot;Tro-Cortesianus&quot;; they remain displayed in Madrid.
In 1871 Brasseur de Bourbourg published his &quot;Bibliothèque Mexico-Guatémalienne&quot;, a compendium of literature and sources associated with Mesoamerican studies.

His last article, &quot;Chronologie historique des Mexicains&quot; (1872) refers to the Codex Chimalpopoca and identifies four periods of world cataclysms that began about 10,500 BC and were the result of shifts of the Earth&#x27;s axis (a concept related to pole shift theory).

== Death and legacy ==
He died at Nice at the beginning of 1874, at the age of 59.

His archaeological fieldwork, as well as his diligent collection, discovery and republication of source materials, proved to be very useful for subsequent Mesoamerican researchers and scholars. The interpretations and theories he advanced proved to be mostly inaccurate.

<doc id="650385" wikidata="Q313198" url="?curid=650385" title="Red Buttons">
<text>Red Buttons (born Aaron Chwatt; February 5, 1919 – July 13, 2006) was an American actor and comedian. He won an Oscar and Golden Globe for &quot;Sayonara&quot;. He was nominated for awards for his work such as &quot;Harlow&quot; (1965), &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969), and &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (1977).

From the 1970s he was a familiar face on TV, with his &quot;Never Got a Dinner&quot; comedy monologues.

==Early life==
Red Buttons was born Aaron Chwatt on February 5, 1919, in Manhattan, New York, to Russo-Polish Jewish immigrants Sophie (née Baker) and Michael Chwatt. At 16 years old, Chwatt got a job as an entertaining bellhop at Ryan&#x27;s Tavern in City Island, the Bronx, New York. The combination of his red hair and the large, shiny buttons on the bellhop uniforms inspired orchestra leader Charles &quot;Dinty&quot; Moore to call him &quot;Red Buttons&quot;, the name under which he would later perform.

Later that same summer, Buttons worked on the Borscht Belt; his straight man was Robert Alda. Buttons was working at the Irvington Hotel in South Fallsburg, New York, when the master of ceremonies became incapacitated, and Buttons asked for the chance to replace him. In 1939, Buttons started working for Minsky&#x27;s Burlesque; in 1941, José Ferrer chose Buttons to appear in a Broadway show &quot;The Admiral Had a Wife&quot;, a farce, set in Pearl Harbor at Oahu, Hawaii. It was due to open on December 8, 1941, but never did. It was deemed inappropriate after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In later years, Buttons would joke that the Japanese only attacked Pearl Harbor to keep him off Broadway.

==Career==
In September 1942, Buttons made his Broadway debut in &quot;Vickie&quot; with Ferrer and Uta Hagen. Later that year, he appeared in the Minsky&#x27;s show &quot;Wine, Women and Song.&quot; This was the last classic burlesque show in New York City history; the Mayor La Guardia administration closed it down. Buttons was on stage when the show was raided.

Drafted into the United States Army Air Forces, Buttons in 1943 appeared in the Army Air Forces&#x27; Broadway show &quot;Winged Victory&quot;, along with several future stars, including Mario Lanza, John Forsythe, Karl Malden, and Lee J. Cobb. A year later, he appeared in Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s movie version of the play, directed by George Cukor. Buttons also entertained troops in the European Theater in the same Jeep Show unit as Mickey Rooney.

After the war, Buttons continued to perform in Broadway shows. He also performed at Broadway movie houses with big bands. He appeared as himself, delivering a comic monologue, in the RKO Radio Pictures movie revue &quot;Footlight Varieties&quot; (1951). 

==&quot;The Red Buttons Show&quot;==
In 1952, Buttons received his own television series, &quot;The Red Buttons Show&quot;, first seen on CBS and later on NBC. It was the number-11 show in prime time in 1952, and the comedian was extremely insistent on using fresh material. During the show&#x27;s three-year-run, Buttons was notorious for his treatment of the writing staff, and comedy writers came and went regularly. As columnist Dorothy Kilgallen reported, &quot;Three of Red Buttons&#x27; writers are ready to pack up and head for the booby hatch. The funnyman&#x27;s temperament is just too exhausting to take. The trio of script writers have already announced they will not be part of the comedian&#x27;s pending Hollywood movie assignment.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot;, noting the format changes of the show from variety to situation comedy, said his &quot;status as a TV comedian has been going up-and-down like a yo-yo for the past two years... He reacted to the heady wine of success like a small boy locked inside a candy store. He went out and bought a powder-blue Cadillac. He picked up a mink coat for his wife. He moved his family into a terraced apartment on Manhattan&#x27;s swank Sutton Place. Then he began to fool around with his scripts. &#x27;That,&#x27; he says now in what may go down as one of the most remarkable understatements of our time, &#x27;may well have been a mistake.&#x27; As a result of these misadventures, Buttons&#x27; sponsor General Foods disowned him at the end of his run and CBS let it be known that Red was welcome to look for work someplace else.&quot; The magazine article carried a melancholy postscript: &quot;P. S. It was in Hollywood that Red found the writers he got along with so well. They were Harry Clork, Larry Markes, Sumner Long, and Lester Lee. We regret having to use the past tense, but it seems that between the time the foregoing story was written a few weeks ago and the time we went to press, all but Lester Lee went thataway.&quot; Buttons admitted to the revolving door of writers: &quot;The critics have kidded a lot about all the writers I&#x27;ve had, and I have had quite a few. I quit counting at 87. Most of them were good writers but they just weren&#x27;t right for me.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; critic Dan Jenkins offered a jaundiced opinion about the comedian&#x27;s variable TV fortunes: &quot;Buttons has no comic traits of his own. He is not funny per se. A Jack Benny can be hilarious just standing with his arms folded, staring at an old lady in the front row, Buttons can&#x27;t. He needs material. Buttons, to this reviewer, has always been a club-date man. He was fleetingly sensational when he first appeared on television, but of all the media, TV is the one that most demands staying power -- a basic talent which can rise above material and carry its own weight on off-weeks. Buttons, thus far this season, has displayed very little of it.&quot;

In 1953, during his TV popularity, he recorded and had a two-sided hit with &quot;Strange Things Are Happening&quot;/&quot;The Ho Ho Song&quot;, with both sides/songs essentially being the same.

==New departure==
His role in the film &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1957) was a dramatic departure from his previous work. In this film, co-starring with Marlon Brando, he played Joe Kelly, an American airman stationed in Kobe, Japan, during the Korean War, who marries Katsumi, a Japanese woman (played by Miyoshi Umeki), but he is barred from taking her back to the US. His moving portrayal of Kelly&#x27;s calm resolve not to abandon the relationship, and the touching reassurance of Katsumi, impressed audiences and critics alike. Buttons won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Umeki won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the film.

After his Oscar-winning role, Buttons performed in numerous feature films, including the African adventure &quot;Hatari!&quot; with John Wayne and the adventure &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot; (1962) (where he received top billing). Buttons played the lead role of Private John Steele, the paratrooper hung up on the town steeple clock, in the 1962 international ensemble cast film &quot;The Longest Day&quot;. He was also prominent in the biopic &quot;Harlow&quot;, the disaster film &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, the dance-marathon drama &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot;, the family comedy &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;, the disaster film &quot;When Time Ran Out&quot; with Paul Newman, and the age-reversal comedy &quot;18 Again!&quot; with George Burns.

In 1966, Buttons again starred in his own TV series, a spy spoof called &quot;The Double Life of Henry Phyfe&quot;, which ran for one season. Buttons also made guest appearances on several TV programs, including &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, and &quot;Roseanne&quot;. His last TV role was in &quot;ER&quot;.

==&quot;Never Got a Dinner&quot;==
Beginning in the 1970s Red Buttons enjoyed a new popularity with his &quot;Never Got a Dinner&quot; routine, a standard of the Friars Club and &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; for many years. &quot;Never got a dinner!&quot; became a catchphrase, and formed the basis for elaborately eccentric lists of famous people (and their wives and mothers) who had not been honored with celebrity dinner roasts: &quot;Why are we here honoring this man? Why is he getting a dinner? I can think of many famous people who never got a dinner. Mrs. Ponce De Leon, who said to her husband Ponce, &#x27;You&#x27;re going to Miami without me again this year?&#x27;... &quot;never got a dinner!&quot;&quot;

Another of his catchphrases was &quot;I did not come here to be made sport of,&quot; which was later taken up by radio talk-show host Howie Carr.

He made numerous appearances at Chabad telethons, where he was often brought on and off stage to the tune of &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;. (He once told an interviewer, &quot;I&#x27;m a Jew who is doing comedy, not a &#x27;Jewish comic&#x27;.&quot;) Buttons received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television, located at 1651 Vine Street. He was number 71 on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time&quot;.

==Personal life==
Buttons married actress Roxanne Arlen in 1947, but the marriage soon ended in divorce. He married Helayne McNorton on December 8, 1949. They divorced in 1963. His last marriage was to Alicia Prats, which lasted from January 27, 1964, until her death in March 2001. With Prats he had two children. He was the advertising spokesman for Century Village, Florida, a retirement community.

Buttons was an early member of the Synagogue for the Performing Arts, and at the time Rabbi Jerome Cutler was the rabbi.

===Death===
Buttons died of complications from cardiovascular disease on July 13, 2006, at age 87 at his home in Century City, Los Angeles. He had been ill for a while and was with family members when he died. His ashes were given to his family after cremation.

<text>Gérard de Ridefort, also called Gerard de Ridefort (died 4 October 1189), was Grand Master of the Knights Templar from the end of 1184 and until his death in 1189.

==Early life==
Gerard de Ridefort is thought probably to have been of Flemish origin, although some nineteenth-century writers suggested an Anglo-Norman background, apparently through misreading his designation as &quot;of &quot;Bideford&quot;. It is uncertain when he arrived in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. He appears in the charter record in the service of Baldwin IV of Jerusalem in the late 1170s, and by 22 October 1179 held the rank of Marshal of the kingdom.

It seems that he expected Raymond III of Tripoli to give him the hand of an available heiress. However, when Cécile Dorel inherited her father&#x27;s coastal fief of Botrun in the County of Tripoli, Raymond married her (before March 1181) to Plivain or Plivano, the nephew of a Pisan merchant, for a bride price of 10,000 bezants. By the mid-thirteenth century, when the &quot;Old French Continuation of William of Tyre&quot; (the so-called &quot;Chronicle of Ernoul&quot;) was compiled, the story of the bride of Botrun had evolved into a fanciful legend in which Plivain&#x27;s uncle put the young lady (there renamed Lucie or Lucia) on the scales, and offered Raymond her weight in gold, to obtain the marriage.

==Templar==
Gérard fell seriously ill, after which he took vows as a Templar. By June 1183 he held the rank of seneschal of the Order. He was elected Grand Master in late 1184 or early 1185, after the death of Arnold of Torroja in Verona.

Gérard continued to hold a grudge against Raymond of Tripoli, which influenced some of his political manœuvrings. In 1186, when King Baldwin V, successor to the late King Baldwin IV, had died, Gérard quickly took the side of Agnes de Courtenay’s daughter Queen Sibylla and her husband Guy de Lusignan, in the ensuing succession struggle. Raymond and his allies, including the Ibelin family were the leaders of the opposing faction, who supported the claim of Sibylla&#x27;s younger half-sister Princess Isabella.

In the crisis of 1187, Gérard used the money sent by King Henry II to be deposited with The Templars in Jerusalem to hire additional troops for the &quot;arrière ban&quot; to defend the Kingdom Of Jerusalem from Saladin. (Henry had sent the funds for his own future crusading plans, in penance for the murder of Thomas Becket; some of it was deposited with the Templars, some with the Knights Hospitalíer, in Jerusalem and Tyre.) Gérard and fewer than 100 Templars, together with some Hospitallers, attacked Saladin&#x27;s son al-Afdal at the Battle of Cresson in 1187. Al-Afdal, however, had over 5,000 men. The Hospitaller Grand Master Roger de Moulins was killed; Gérard, though wounded, was one of the few survivors. Gérard&#x27;s report of the battle was the source for a short narrative written by Pope Urban III to Baldwin of Exeter, archbishop of Canterbury. 

In July of the same year Gérard led the Templars at the Battle Of Háttin. Saladin had captured Tiberias and Guy was contemplating a march on the city to retake it. Raymond advised him to wait for Saladin to come to them, since they were in a well-defended, well-watered position, and would have to cross a dry open plain to reach Tiberias. Gérard opposed this, and convinced Guy to continue the march. He was supported by Reynald de Châtillon, a fellow enemy of Raymond. The armies of Outremer ended up trapped on the dry plain and were defeated on 4 July. Raymond and several other nobles escaped, but some who were not killed, including Humphrey de Toron IV, Aimery de Lusignan, Reynald, Guy &quot;and&quot; &quot;also&quot; Gérard were among those captured by Salah ad-Din. The rest of the Templar prisoners were executed. Gérard remained a prisoner until 1188, during which time his Order was commanded by Brother Thierry (Terricus) from Tyre.

Gérard was given the condition by Saladin that, if he could convince a Templar fortress to surrender peacefully, he would be set free. He succeeded and on his release went to Tortosa, where he ably led the Templars&#x27; defence of their castle, which held out after the fall of the town to Saladin’s siege forces. Having taken back control of his order from Thierry, he seems to have seized the remainder of King Henry II’s money which had been left with the Templars in Tyre. This provoked a complaint from the city&#x27;s defender, Conrad of Montferrat, in letters of 20 September 1188 to Baldwin of Exeter and Frederick Barbarossa, even saying: &quot;...graver still, the Master of the Temple has made off with the King of England&#x27;s alms&quot;&quot;.

In 1189, he again joined forces with Guy, taking the Templars to the Siege of Acre. After being taken prisoner once more, he was beheaded by Saladin on 4 October 1189.

==In popular culture==

Gérard de Ridefort is a character in some contemporary novels, films, and video games. He is often depicted as being a hot-headed, vicious, and stubborn religious fanatic, whose self-righteously arrogant, scheming and selfish actions lead to his undoing.

===Literature===
*He appears in Jack Whyte&#x27;s book &quot;Standard of Honor&quot; as an adversary of Count Raymond.

*Gérard appears in Jan Guillou&#x27;s Crusades trilogy about the fictional character Arn Magnusson, wherein he is depicted as helping to ensure the latter&#x27;s release from the Templars.

*In &quot;Jerusalem&quot; by Cecelia Holland, &quot;Gerard de Ridford&quot; appears as the story&#x27;s primary antagonist.

===Games===
* Gérard is a general of the Kingdom of Jerusalem at the &quot;Medieval II: Total War: Kingdoms&quot; Crusades Campaign.

===Films===
* Gérard was portrayed by Nicholas Boulton in the Swedish 2007 film &quot;Arn – The Knight Templar&quot;, and its 2008 sequel &quot;Arn – The Kingdom at Road&#x27;s End&quot;, each of which depicts him as self-righteous, religiously fanatic, arrogant, and uncompromising.

<text>The term Link Trainer, also known as the &quot;Blue box&quot; and &quot;Pilot Trainer&quot; is commonly used to refer to a series of flight simulators produced between the early 1930s and early 1950s by Link Aviation Devices, founded and headed by Ed Link, based on technology he pioneered in 1929 at his family&#x27;s business in Binghamton, New York. During World War II, they were used as a key pilot training aid by almost every combatant nation.

The original Link Trainer was created in 1929 out of the need for a safe way to teach new pilots how to fly by instruments. Ed Link used his knowledge of pumps, valves and bellows gained at his father&#x27;s Link Piano and Organ Company to create a flight simulator that responded to the pilot&#x27;s controls and gave an accurate reading on the included instruments. More than 500,000 US pilots were trained on Link simulators, as were pilots of nations as diverse as Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Pakistan, and the USSR. Following WWII, Air Marshal Robert Leckie (wartime RAF Chief of Staff) said &quot;The Luftwaffe met its Waterloo on all the training fields of the free world where there was a battery of Link Trainers&quot;.

The Link Flight Trainer has been designated as a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The Link Company, now the Link Simulation &amp; Training division of CAE USA Defense &amp; Security CAE Inc., continues to make aerospace simulators.

==History==

===Origins===
Edwin Link had developed a passion for flying in his boyhood years, but was not able to afford the high cost of flying lessons. So, upon leaving school in 1927, he started developing a simulator. The project took him 18 months. His first pilot trainer, which debuted in 1929, resembled an overgrown toy airplane from the outside, with short wooden wings and fuselage mounted on a universal joint. Organ bellows from the Link organ factory, the business his family owned and operated in Binghamton, New York, driven by an electric pump, made the trainer pitch and roll as the pilot worked the controls.

Link&#x27;s first military sales came as a result of the Air Mail scandal, when the Army Air Corps took over carriage of U.S. Air Mail. Twelve pilots were killed in a 78-day period due to their unfamiliarity with Instrument Flying Conditions. The large scale loss of life prompted the Air Corps to look at a number of solutions, including Link&#x27;s pilot trainer. The Air Corps was given a stark demonstration of the potential of instrument training when, in 1934, Link flew in to a meeting in conditions of fog that the Air Corps evaluation team regarded as unflyable. As a result, the Air Corps ordered the first six pilot trainers on 23 June 1934 for $3,500 each. In 1936, the more advanced Model C was introduced.

American Airlines became the first commercial airline to purchase a Link trainer in 1937. Prior to World War II, Link trainers were also sold to the U.S. Navy, Civil Aeronautics Administration, Germany, Japan, England, Russia, France, and Canada.

===World War II===

Link and his company had struggled through the Depression years, but after gaining Air Corps interest the business expanded rapidly and during World War II, the AN-T-18 Basic Instrument Trainer, known to tens of thousands of fledgling pilots as the &quot;Blue Box&quot; (although it was painted in different colors in other countries), was standard equipment at every air training school in the United States and Allied nations. During the war years, Link produced over 10,000 Blue Boxes, turning one out every 45 minutes.

During World War II, Link trainers were sometimes run by women.

==Link Trainer models==
Several models of Link Trainers were sold in a period ranging from 1934 through to the late 1950s. These trainers kept pace with the increased instrumentation and flight dynamics of aircraft of their period, but retained the electrical and pneumatic design fundamentals pioneered in the first Link.

Trainers built from 1934 up to the early 1940s had a color scheme that featured a bright blue fuselage and yellow wings and tail sections. These wings and tail sections had control surfaces that actually moved in response to the pilot&#x27;s movement of the rudder and stick. However, many trainers built during mid to late World War II did not have these wings and tail sections due to material shortages and critical manufacturing times.

===Pilot Maker===
The Pilot Maker was Link&#x27;s first model. It was an evolution of his 1929 prototype and was used in Mr. Link&#x27;s Link Flying School and later by other flying schools. During the Depression years versions of the Pilot Maker were also sold to amusement parks. In fact, his patent (US1825462 A) for the Pilot Maker was titled &quot;Combination Training Device for Student Aviators and Entertainment Apparatus&quot;.

===AN-T-18===
The most prolific version of the Link Trainer was the AN-T-18 (Army Navy Trainer model 18), which was a slightly enhanced version of Link&#x27;s &quot;C3&quot; model. This model was also produced in Canada for both the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Royal Air Force with a somewhat modified instrument panel, where its model designation was &quot;D2&quot;. It was used by many countries for pilot training before and during the Second World War, especially in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.

The AN-T-18 featured rotation through all three axes, effectively simulated all flight instruments, and modeled common conditions such as pre-stall buffet, overspeed of the retractable undercarriage, and spinning. It was fitted with a removable opaque canopy, which could be used to simulate blind flying, and was particularly useful for instrument and navigation training.

====AN-T-18 design and construction====

The AN-T-18 consists of two main components:

The first major component is the trainer, which consists of a wooden box approximating the shape of a fuselage and cockpit, connected via a universal joint to a base. Inside the cockpit is a single pilot&#x27;s seat, primary and secondary aircraft controls, and a full suite of flight instruments. The base contains several complicated sets of air-driven bellows to create movement, a vacuum pump that both drives the bellows and provides input to a number of aircraft instruments, a device known as a Telegon oscillator that supplies an 85 VAC 800 Hz sinusoidal reference signal to the remaining pilot and instructor instruments, and a wind drift analog computer.

The second major component is an external instructor&#x27;s desk, which consists of a large map table; a duplicate display of the pilot&#x27;s main flight instruments; and the Automatic Recorder, a motorized ink marker also known as &quot;the crab&quot;. The crab is driven by the Wind Drift computer and moves across the glass surface of the map table, plotting the pilot&#x27;s track. The desk includes circuits for the pilot and instructor to communicate with each other via headphones and microphones, and controls for the instructor to alter wind direction and speed.

The AN-T-18 has three main sets of bellows. One set of four bellows (fore and aft and both sides of the cockpit) controls movement about the pitch and roll axes. A very complicated set of bellows at the front of the fuselage controls movement about the yaw axis. This Turning Motor is a complex set of 10 bellows, two crank shafts and various gears and pulleys derived from early player piano motors. The Turning Motor can rotate the entire fuselage through 360-degree circles at variable rates of speed. A set of electrical slip ring contacts in the lower base compartment supplies electrical continuity between the fixed base and the movable fuselage.

The third set of bellows simulates vibration, such as stall buffet. Both the trainer and the instructor&#x27;s station are powered from standard 110VAC/240VAC power outlets via a transformer, with the bulk of internal wiring being low voltage. Simulator logic is all analog and is based around vacuum tubes.

<text>Charles Clayton Morrison (1874–1966) was an American Disciples of Christ minister and Christian socialist.

Born in Harrison, Ohio, he attended high school in Jefferson, Iowa, Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, and the University of Chicago. He served as minister at the Monroe Street Church in Chicago, which in 1906, adopted &quot;Open Membership,&quot; allowing unimmersed Christians to join the church. This view of baptism was developed in his first book &quot;The Meaning of Baptism&quot; (1914). It was in 1908, when Morrison was still a young minister, that he purchased the foundering &quot;Christian Century&quot; magazine in Chicago in 1908. At the time of his purchase, the magazine was a Disciples of Christ journal. Within a decade he had broadened the journal&#x27;s reach by offering a broadly Protestant perspective. As he did this, he added the subtitle &quot;An Undenominational Journal of Religion.&quot; With donations and gradually increasing subscribership, the magazine survived and prospered under his editorship until his retirement in 1947.

During Morrison&#x27;s stewardship in the 1930s and 1940s, the Christian Century was accused of being antisemitic. It published articles opposing American intervention in World War II for the benefit of the Jews persecuted under the Nazis; arguing moral equivalence between an alleged Jewish-nationalist crucifixion of Jesus and the Nazi persecution of Jews; condemning American Jews for maintaining their distinct identity; and criticizing Rabbi Stephen Wise, president of the World Jewish Congress, for allegedly exaggerating the Holocaust. As late as 1944 the magazine published articles such as &quot;A Reply to Screamers&quot; by Fred Eastman which admonished the suggestion that there was a moral obligation for the United States to aid in the plight of European Jews being murdered during the Holocaust. Marty, writing about the 1940s, described the &quot;Christian Century&quot; at that time as being an &quot;anti-Zionist&quot; publication.

Morrison became a well-known spokesman for liberal Christianity. He supported the ecumenical movement, particularly the establishment of the World Council of Churches and the National Council of Churches.

==Notable quotes==
*&quot;The Christian church is a society of sinners. It is the only society in the world membership in which is based upon the single qualification that the candidate shall be unworthy of membership.&quot;

<doc id="650392" wikidata="Q1549486" url="?curid=650392" title="Astroscopus guttatus">
<text>Astroscopus guttatus or the northern stargazer is a fish belonging to the Uranoscopidae family and was first described by Charles Conrad Abbott in 1860. Members of the Uranoscopidae family are characterized by dorsally or dorsolaterally directed eyes placed on or near the top of a large, flattened cuboid head, an oblique to vertical mouth often lined with cutaneous cirri, and an elongated, sub-compressed body. The Astroscopus genus consists of three species: Astroscopus guttatus, Astroscopus Y-graecum, and Astroscopus zepherus. Typically found on the Atlantic shores between the states of North Carolina and New York in the United States, the Northern Stargazer can sometimes be confused with its sister species the Southern Stargazer, Astroscopus y-graecum. Both A. guttatus and A. Y-graecum overlap in their distributions in Cape Hatterus One way to distinguish the Northern Stargazer from the Southern Stargazer is by the presence of numerous small white spots closely spaced along its head and back, whereas the Southern Stargazer has fewer, larger spots on its back. The Northern Stargazer is a moderately sized fish that can reach lengths of 22 inches (56 cm). The northern stargazer can be found buried in sandy substrate at depths up to 120 feet (37 m) where the species remains buried awaiting prey. Stargazers have a flat forehead with a lot of body mass up front near the mouth creating a body plane optimal for remaining buried under sandy substrate.

==Description==
The northern stargazer has a blackish brown body covered in white spots that gradually increase in size towards the rear of the body. It has three dark horizontal stripes on its (white) tail. Another identifying feature for stargazers is the location of the lateral line. In most fish species the lateral line follows a straight direction or gentle curve on the side of the body. But in Astroscopus, the lateral lines that begin on the gill opening then run upward at a sharp angle until the two lines lie almost together, one on each side of the dorsal fin. This adaptation allows the fish to remain buried while keeping the lateral line operational. The southern stargazer, A. y-graecum, closely resembles the northern stargazer in appearance and life history. Two ways to tell the two species apart look at the size and density of white spots on the back of the fish. The northern stargazer possesses more closely set white spots compared to the southern stargazers large more spaced spots. Another way to tell the difference between the two, is to look at the difference in tail striping among the two. The northern stargazer&#x27;s middle tail stripe extends on the rear portion of the body. Whereas on the southern stargazer, the stripe does not extend past the tail. Northern stargazers have a robust body filled with small scales that becomes slender posteriorly. In addition, the fish have four to five short spines on the dorsal fin and 13 to 15 rays on the second dorsal fin. Their anal fin has one spine along with 12 rays. The northern stargazer has many adaptations that aid in its sand-dwelling lifestyle. First being the overall depressed shape of the stargazer. Stargazers have a flatted elongated body with a large head and eyes that are position on the top of their heads as opposed to the side. The strategic placement of the eyes on the top of the head allows for their eyes to remain functional despite being buried. In addition to the location of the eyes, stargazers as well as other bottom dwelling fish have the ability to change the height of their eyes by filling tissues at the back of the eye with body fluid. Stargazers also have ventral fins that have been moved forward in such a way that they assist with digging. &quot;A. guttatus&quot; has pectoral fins that act as shovels allowing the fish to bury itself in seconds. The mouth of the stargazer faces up so that it can ambush prey while hiding in the sandy bottoms of coastal bodies of water. In addition to placement of their mouth, Astroscopus fish can breathe when the water is full of sand or when buried due to a row of fine comb-like structures on the edge of each jaw. These comb-like serrations are position in a way that when the jaw is closed, they interlock allowing water to flow through but preventing sand. The top of the stargazer has electric organs in the orbitae which can generate and transmit an electric shock. The electric apparatus is composed of two organs, which form two vertical columns roughly oval in horizontal section and placed behind and somewhat under each eye. It is composed of about 200 thin layers of electric tissue.

==Distribution==
&quot;Astroscopus guttatus&quot; is typically found in coastal waters from New York to Virginia. But there have been sightings of the northern stargazer in the waters of South Carolina. Northern Stargazer can be found in deep ocean water at depths up to 120 feet or 37 meters. The Northern Stargazer enjoys rocky reef and soft bottom habitats. In places lacking natural reefs, scientists experimented with placing oyster cages on the bottom of the ocean floor. These scientists observed an increase in fish diversity including an increase in Northern Stargazer sightings flowing the addition of the oyster cage as the cage created additional reef like habitat for fish.

==Ecology==
Northern stargazers live primarily along the eastern seaboard of the United States. They do not swim much except when migrating as they swim clumsily and slowly. Instead, northern stargazers bury themselves in the sand using short side to side motions of their ventral fins and tail to bury themselves until ¾ of their body plane is covered by sandy substrate. If disturbed, stargazers can bury themselves beneath as many as 12 inches of sand to hide from predators. Stargazers utilize their camouflaged location in the sand to wait for prey to swim by. Northern Stargazers primarily feed on small fish that swim above them in the sand. Their eyes are situated on top of the head and poke up through the sand, hence the name stargazer. The eyes of the northern stargazer are also home to an electrical organ that sits under each eye. The electrical apparatus is composed of 200 thin layers of electric tissue which gives it a jelly or mucus like appearance. The origin of this organ is still underdetermined with the best logical supposition that the electric organ was derived by an unusual modification of a portion of one or more of the eye muscles. The organ is believed to not only be used to threaten predators from above as the fish lies buried in the sand, but to also stun prey. The stargazer&#x27;s scientific name is Astroscopus guttatus where Astroscopus means &quot;one who aims at the stars&quot; and guttatus translating into &quot;speckled&quot; – referring to the white spots on the fish&#x27;s back.

==Life cycle==

Stargazers lay small, transparent eggs on the bottoms of bays in the late spring early summer. These eggs float to the surface after they are released. They hatch into larvae which grow up to 6–7 mm (0.24–0.28 in). From there, the fish will continue to grow rapidly as it lives on its yolk sac. When the fish reaches 6–7 millimeters long, it will begin eating other nearby younger fish larva. After approximately one month, the fish will slowly grow a dark coloring and develop the electrical organs from eye muscles when they are 12–15 mm (0.5–0.6 in). As a juvenile, the northern stargazer travels in schools as it leaves the shoreline during the winter to avoid the serve cold only returning to the bay in the spring. After four to six years the fish has grown to 12–13 inches in length and them migrates to the sandy bottoms some distance off the coast where it lives permanently. This is also when the fish becomes reproductively active releasing eggs and sperm in the early spring and breeding around May or June.

==Conservation Status==
The Northern Stargazer was most recently assessed by the IUCN Red List of Threaten Species in 2014 and was listed as Least Concern. The current population trend for the species is unknown and there is no known major threat. As for use and trade, the Northern Stargazer occurs rarely as bycatch in bottom trawls but is not utilized.

==Taxonomy==
The northern stargazer was first described by Charles Conrad Abbott in 1860.

<text>Reginald Stuart Poole (27 January 18328 February 1895), known as Stuart Poole, was an English archaeologist, numismatist and Orientalist. Poole was from a famous Orientalist family; his mother Sophia Lane Poole, his uncle Edward William Lane and his nephew Stanley Lane-Poole were all famous for their work in this field. His other uncle was Richard James Lane, a distinguished Victorian lithographer and engraver.

==Life==
Born in London, Poole was the son of the Rev. Edward Poole, a well-known bibliophile. His parents became estranged during his early childhood, and his mother, Sophia Lane Poole, took her sons to Egypt to live with her brother, the Orientalist Edward William Lane. During their seven-year residence in Cairo from 1842 to 1849, Lane Poole wrote &quot;The Englishwoman in Egypt&quot;, while her son was imbibing an early taste for Egyptian antiquities.

In 1852 he became an assistant in the British Museum and was assigned to the Department of Coins and Medals, of which in 1870 he became keeper. In that capacity he worked as a writer, teacher, and administrator. He was largely responsible for founding the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1882 and for starting the Society of English Medallists in 1884. He was Yates Professor of Archaeology at University College, London from 1889, and also a lecturer at the Royal Academy. In 1883 he received an honorary degree from Cambridge University. He received the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1892.

On 6 August 1861, he had married Eliza Christina Forlonge, daughter of William Forlonge, with whom he had four children, including Sir Reginald Ward Poole.

Poole retired in 1893 and died in 1895.

==Works==
Some of Poole&#x27;s best work was done in his articles for the 9th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, on Egypt, Hieroglyphics and Numismatics; he also wrote for &quot;Smith&#x27;s Dictionary of the Bible&quot; and published volumes dealing with his special subjects.

Poole was one of the strong defenders in England of the work of Champollion when he was criticized harshly by Sir George Lewis even as late as 1862. In reply to Lewis critique, Poole defended Champollion&#x27;s method describing it as &quot;the method of interpreting Hieroglyphics originated by Dr. Young and developed by Champollion&quot;.

<text>Fort Michilimackinac was an 18th-century French, and later British, fort and trading post at the Straits of Mackinac; it was built on the northern tip of the lower peninsula of the present-day state of Michigan in the United States. Built around 1715, and abandoned in 1783, it was located along the straits that connect Lake Huron and Lake Michigan of the Great Lakes of North America. A reconstruction of the fort is preserved as the main feature of Colonial Michilimackinac Historic State Park. 

The present-day village of Mackinaw City developed around the site of the fort, which has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. It is preserved as an open-air historical museum, with several reconstructed wooden buildings and palisade, and is now part of the state park.

==History==

The primary purpose of the fort was as part of the French-Canadian trading post system, which stretched from the Atlantic Coast and the St. Lawrence River to the Great Lakes, and south to the Mississippi River through the Illinois Country. The fort served as a supply depot for traders in the western Great Lakes.

The French had first established a presence in the Straits of Mackinac in 1671 when Father Marquette established the Jesuit St. Ignace Mission at present-day St. Ignace in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In 1683, they augmented the mission with Fort de Buade. In 1701, Sieur de Cadillac moved the French garrison to Fort Detroit and closed the mission.

By 1713, however, the French decided to re-establish a presence along the Straits of Mackinac, and built the wooden Fort Michilimackinac on the northern tip of the lower peninsula. They sent Constant le Marchand de Lignery with a contingent of soldiers and workmen in 1715 to accomplish the job. Over the decades, they made several modifications and expansions to the palisade walls. Chevalier Jacques Testard de Montigny, who was a Lt. and a Knight of the Order of St. Louis, was appointed in 1730 and served for three years as commandant of the fort. He was previously commandant of Fort La Baye (Green Bay, Wisconsin). Many of his relatives settled in Michigan.

The French relinquished the fort, along with their territory in Canada, to the British in 1761 following their defeat in the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War. The British continued to operate the fort as a major trading post, but most residents were French and Métis (Ojibwe-French), who spoke predominantly French and worshipped at Sainte Anne Church in a small log structure. Other civilian residents included British fur traders, some of whom resided within the fort in the southeastern row house.

The Ojibwe in the region soon became dissatisfied with British policies, particularly their cancellation of the annual policy of distributing gifts to the Indians. On June 2, 1763, as part of the larger conflict known as Pontiac&#x27;s War, a group of Ojibwe staged a game of &quot;baaga&#x27;adowe&quot; (a forerunner of modern lacrosse) outside the fort as a ruse to gain entrance. After entering the fort, they killed most of the British inhabitants. They held the fort for a year before the British regained control, promising to offer more and better gifts to the native inhabitants of the area.

The British eventually determined that the wooden fort on the mainland was too vulnerable. In 1781 they built a limestone fort on nearby Mackinac Island. Now known as Fort Mackinac, it was initially named Fort Michilimackinac. The British then moved related buildings to the island by dismantling them and moving them across the water in the summer and over ice in winter to the island during the next two years. Ste. Anne&#x27;s Church was also moved. Patrick Sinclair, the lieutenant governor of Michilimackinac, ordered the remains of the original Fort Michilimackinac to be burned after the move.

==Today==

In 1960 the fort grounds were designated a National Historic Landmark. The grounds were then restored, largely through archaeologically informed reconstruction, as a tourist attraction. The fort and grounds operate, as of 2024, as part of Colonial Michilimackinac Historic State Park]] in Mackinaw City, a major component of the Mackinac State Historic Parks. Interpreters, both paid and volunteer, help bring the history to life with music, live demonstrations and reenactments, including musket and cannon firing demonstrations. The site has numerous reconstructed historical wooden structures based on archeological excavations. This is considered one of the most extensively excavated early colonial French archaeological sites in the United States.

The state park grounds feature the foot of the Mackinac Bridge, the Old Mackinac Point Lighthouse, dating from 1892, a day-use park with a view of the Mackinac Bridge and Mackinac Island, and a visitor center with gift shop.
