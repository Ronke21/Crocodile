<text>Milk toast is a breakfast dish consisting of toasted bread in warm milk, typically with sugar and butter. Salt, pepper, paprika, cinnamon, cocoa, raisins or other ingredients may be added. In the New England region of the United States, milk toast refers to toast that has been dipped in a milk-based white sauce.

Milk toast was a popular food throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially for young children and for the convalescent, for whom the dish was thought to be soothing and easy to digest. Although not as popular in the 2000s, milk toast is still considered a comfort food.

Food writer M. F. K. Fisher called milk toast a &quot;warm, mild, soothing thing, full of innocent strength&quot;, and wrote, of eating milk toast in a famed restaurant with a friend, that the dish was &quot;a small modern miracle of gastronomy&quot;. She notes that her homeliest kitchen manuals list it under &quot;Feeding The Sick&quot; or &quot;Invalid Recipes&quot;, arguing that milk toast was &quot;an instinctive palliative, something like boiled water&quot;. Fisher also notes that for true comfort, a ritual may be necessary, and for &quot;Milk Toast people&quot;, the dish used may be foolishly important. Her favorite version of milk toast has the milk mixed 50/50 with Campbell&#x27;s condensed cream of tomato soup in a wide-lipped pitcher called a , from Italian Switzerland.

== Outside New England ==
===Asia===
Milk toast is a dessert that is served in Asian milk tea cafes. It consists of thick, enriched toasted white bread with condensed milk on top. It is called () in Bangladesh and India and is occasionally served at gatherings. The topping is often infused with cardamom and other spices.
===Norway and Sweden===
A traditional Scandinavian dish similar to milk toast is called in Norwegian and in Swedish. It consists of broken &quot;flatbrød&quot; (wafer-thin, crisp bread), &quot;tunnbröd&quot; or dry bread served in a bowl of cold milk (often &quot;filmjölk&quot;) and sweetened with sugar. This was an everyday dish for peasants in the countryside, especially served as a simple supper in the evening and was sometimes served as breakfast with warmed milk during the winter.

===Serbia===
&quot;Popara&quot; is a dessert similar to milk toast which can be served at any time of the day. It is often made with fresh warm milk and day-old bread.

==In popular culture==
Milk toast&#x27;s soft blandness served as inspiration for the name of the timid and ineffectual comic strip character Caspar Milquetoast, drawn by H. T. Webster from 1924 to 1952. Thus, the term &quot;milquetoast&quot; entered the language as the label for a timid, shrinking, apologetic person.

In the American television series &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, Ward, Wally, and Beaver eat milk toast when Aunt Martha visits in the episode “Beaver’s Short Pants”.

<doc id="635260" wikidata="Q5290810" url="?curid=635260" title="2004 Dominican Republic presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in the Dominican Republic on 16 May 2004. The result was a victory for former president Leonel Fernández, who defeated incumbent Hipólito Mejía. Voter turnout was 72.8%.

==Candidates==
*Hipólito Mejía, serving president (2000-2004), representing the Dominican Revolutionary Party seeking immediate re-election.
*Leonel Fernández, president from 1996 to 2000, representing the Dominican Liberation Party seeking a second (non-consecutive) term.
*Eduardo Estrella of the Social Christian Reformist Party, a former senator and advisor to ex-president Joaquín Balaguer.

Opinion polls in the run-up to election day showed Fernández leading with 54%, Mejía on 27%, and Estrella on 14%. In the previous weeks, however, Mejía had been gaining support while Fernández&#x27;s numbers had been falling and, as a result, at one point it seemed possible that a second round run-off vote would have to be held between the two top candidates. Fernández&#x27;s final result, in excess of 50%, meant that the second round was not necessary.

===Overseas voting===
The Dominican Republic introduced legislation in 1997 to enable Dominican citizens residing abroad to vote in presidential elections. This was the first time the provisions of that law were put into practice, with some 52,500 registered overseas voters eligible to vote at polling stations set up in several American cities including Miami and New York, as well as Montréal, Caracas, Madrid and Barcelona.

Electoral officials noted that 52,500 was only a fraction of the overseas voters actually eligible to vote (one million Dominicans are estimated to live in the United States alone), but that the take-up rate was hampered by a lack of information regarding the necessary formalities and by bureaucratic hurdles (particularly, the requirement that up-to-date national ID cards be presented).

<text>Komsomolskaya Pravda (; ) is a daily Russian tabloid newspaper that was founded in 1925. Its name is in reference to the official Soviet newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; &#x27;Truth&#x27;.

==History and profile==
During the Soviet era, &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; was an all-union newspaper of the Soviet Union and an official organ of the Central Committee of the Komsomol. Established in accordance with a decision of the 13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (b), it first appeared on 24 May 1925 in an edition of 31,000 copies.

&quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; began as the official organ of the Komsomol, the youth wing of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). As such, it targeted the same 14 to 28 demographics as its parent organization, focusing initially on popular science and adventure articles while teaching the values of the CPSU. During this period, it was twice awarded the Order of Red Banner of Labour (in 1950 and 1957) and was also the recipient of the Order of Lenin (in 1930), of the Order of the October Revolution (in 1975), and of the Order of the Patriotic War (in 1945).

The paper&#x27;s largest owner is the son of the founder of the Baltic Media Group, Sergei Rudnov, who indirectly controls 45%. Until 2011, it was owned by Media Partner, which in turn was owned by ESN Group (), an energy company led by Grigory Berezkin. In December 2000 the Norwegian media company A-Pressen bought 25 percent plus one share of the paper. It is published in tabloid format by &quot;Izdatelsky Dom Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; (Komsomolskaya Pravda Publishing House).

&quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; reached its highest circulation in 1990 when it sold almost 22 million daily copies. In 2001 it was the ninth-top European newspaper with a circulation of 785,000 copies. It was the top-selling newspaper in Russia in 2006 with daily circulation ranging from 700,000 to 3.1 million copies. Its March 2008 circulation, certified by the NCS, was 660,000 copies and it was the most read paper in the country based on the findings by the TNS Gallup Media. In the same year the online version of the paper was also the most visited news website.

In January 2015 a front-page article in &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; suggested that the United States had orchestrated the Charlie Hebdo shooting.

In May 2017, columnist Alisa Titko went viral for writing that the English city of Manchester was &quot;full of fat people&quot; and that she found the sight of same-sex love &quot;disgusting&quot;.

In 2021, the tabloid published an article in which former Kontinental Hockey League coach Andrei Nazarov accused New York Rangers winger Artemi Panarin of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old Latvian woman in Riga. The team released a statement condemning the allegations as a &quot;fabrication&quot; and &quot;intimidation tactic&quot; against Panarin after speaking out against &quot;recent political events&quot;, most notably expressing his support for Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was detained upon return to Russia from Germany.

<text>The Lawrence Hall of Science is a public science center in Berkeley, California that offers hands-on science exhibits, designs curriculum, aids professional development, and offers after school science resources to students of all ages. The Lawrence was established in 1968 in honor of physicist Ernest Orlando Lawrence (1901–1958), the University of California&#x27;s first Nobel laureate. The center is located in the hills above the University of California, Berkeley campus, less than a mile uphill from the University&#x27;s Botanical Garden.

== Permanent exhibits ==
* Science on a Sphere – interactive globe displaying real scientific data from Earth. Scientific data displayed on the globe includes Earth&#x27;s weather patterns, ocean temperatures and currents, climate change, day and night views of the Earth, and tsunami and hurricane patterns. Science on a Sphere was developed by researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
* Forces That Shape the Bay – outdoor science park, which explores the seismological forces that created and still affect the entire San Francisco Bay area.
* Sunstones – an 18-foot granite astronomical sculpture, created by David Cudaback and Richard O&#x27;Hanlon and installed outside the Hall in 1979. Sight lines in the piece allow visitors to view northern- and southernmost setting of the sun at the solstices and many other important astronomical events.
* Young Explorers Area– a multi-sensory play area for children in kindergarten and younger. 
*Ernest O. Lawrence Memorial – devoted to the life and research of Ernest O. Lawrence. This exhibit features a biographical film on Lawrence&#x27;s life and a pair of &quot;Dee&quot; electrodes from one of the first cyclotrons.
*Insect Zoo – See hermit crabs, Indian walking sticks, a tarantula, and hissing cockroaches.
*The Animal Discovery Zone – where children learn about animals. Many homeschool and other classes are held in the Animal Discovery Zone and provide the opportunity for children to observe and interact with animals.
* Ingenuity Challenges – A different design challenge each month allows kids to think critically and explore real world engineering problems.
* Pheena the Fin Whale – a life sized model of a juvenile fin whale residing on the plaza.
* An eight hundred million-to-one scale model of a DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecule on the plaza is another favorite place for young visitors to play. This sculpture was designed by Michael Jantzen of Valencia, California. It was put in place in the spring of 1992.

In addition to its permanent exhibits, the Lawrence Hall of Science has featured a rotation of traveling exhibits. Past traveling exhibits include: Tony Hawk Rad Science, Dinosaurs Unearthed, Scream Machines: The Science of Roller Coasters, RACE: Are We So Different?, Facing Mars, Animal Grossology, Waterworks, Engineer It, Speed, Wild Music: Songs and Sounds of Life, Circus! Science at the Big Top, Grossology, My Home, Planet Earth, Big Dinos Return, Candy Unwrapped, and Math Midway.

== Nobel Prize display ==
In 2003, following the death of Lawrence&#x27;s widow, Molly Lawrence, the Lawrence family chose the Lawrence Hall of Science to house his 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics. The Nobel Prize medal was placed in a display case in the E.O. Lawrence Memorial room, a permanent exhibit which displayed artifacts of his life and work for nearly forty years.

On March 1, 2007 a member of the Lawrence Hall of Science Exhibits staff reported that the Nobel Prize medal was missing from its locked display case. The UC Police Department was notified immediately and began an investigation on the medal&#x27;s theft. A $2,500 award was offered in exchange for the medal&#x27;s recovery and information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect. The medal is made from 23 karat gold and worth approximately $4,000. Lawrence&#x27;s medal was the first Nobel Prize awarded to the University of California and the first Nobel Prize won by an American public university. The prize was recovered and a student was arrested on suspicion of grand theft. A replica of the Ernest Lawrence Nobel Prize now resides in the museum display case.

== Planetarium ==

The Lawrence Hall of Science develops interactive planetarium shows for its own planetarium and other small planetariums. The planetarium was built in 1973 and directed by Alan Friedman. The Holt Planetarium&#x27;s programs have focused on audience participation, an innovation that has changed the way small planetariums around the world present astronomy to the public. In 2000 the Holt Planetarium was deemed &quot;The Best Planetarium in the Whole World&quot; by The Planetarian, Journal of the International Planetarium Society.

The planetarium presents live, interactive shows (approximately 25 minutes long), following the hands-on philosophy of science education. 

The Holt Planetarium has a strong interactive approach to astronomy education. Their programs actively engage audience members in activities such as finding constellations, searching for exoplanets, and so forth. The planetarium at Pacific Science Center in Seattle (originally called Star Lab, now called the Willard Smith Planetarium) was directly modeled on the Holt. Dennis Schatz was hired in 1977 from Lawrence Hall of Science as the opening director of the Pacific Science Center planetarium.

== Publications and curriculum ==

Curriculum and publications developed by the Lawrence Hall of Science programs such as EQUALS/FAMILY MATH, Full Option Science System (FOSS), Great Explorations in Math and Science (GEMS), Marine Activities and Resources in Education (MARE), PEACHES—a program for early childhood educators, and Science Education for Public Understanding Program (SEPUP) reach many students nationwide and around the world. New programs are frequently developed and expanded at the Hall, such as Global Systems Science (GSS), Hands-On Universe (HOU), and Seeds of Science – Roots of Reading.

== Education ==
The Lawrence has an extensive education division, offering year-round youth and family classes and day camps on-site. Classes focus on a wide range of subjects, including biology, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, robotics and art. In addition to on-site classes, residential summer camps are held in various locations in California.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the Lawrence offered gifted teenagers free computer systems access through a program called The Friday Project, or FRID. This was important at the time because computers weren&#x27;t readily available in homes so that access to computers was otherwise only at school. To become a &quot;FRID kid&quot;, one had to submit a project proposal and be accepted by its leaders. Computer systems available included Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s 2000B, Data General&#x27;s Nova and Eclipse, and Control Data Corporation&#x27;s PLATO internet-like system that pioneered key on-line concepts such as forums, message boards, online testing, e-mail, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing, and multi-player games.

== Professional development ==
The Lawrence Hall of Science offers many workshops and other professional development opportunities for teachers. Online courses for the Lawrence Hall of Science curriculum are also available.

== Discovery Store ==
The Discovery store offers many science and math products for visitors of all ages. Popular items include science kits, educational posters, plush toys and astronaut ice cream.

== University of California, Berkeley ==
The Lawrence Hall of Science is the public science center of the University of California, Berkeley. Staff collaborate with University faculty from many fields to develop exhibits such as Big Dinos Return, Forces That Shape the Bay and Nanozone, as well as educational materials for teachers and families.

== In film ==
In the 1970s, several science fiction films utilized the Lawrence Hall of Science:
* The 1970 film &quot;&quot; used this location as the fictional Colossus command center. Actually filmed in 1969.
* Scenes from the 1971 movie &quot;THX 1138&quot; were filmed at the Lawrence Hall of Science.
* A flyover shot of the Lawrence Hall of Science is briefly featured as a location shot in the opening of the pilot episode of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; (1976).

<text>William Francis Grimes (known as Peter; 31 October 1905 – 25 December 1988) was a Welsh archaeologist. He devoted his career to the archaeology of London and the prehistory of Wales. He was appointed a CBE in 1955.

==Early life==
Grimes was born in Pembroke in Wales. His father was a draughtsman with the Pembroke docks board. He was educated at Pembroke county school and then at Bedford Modern School after his father moved to Bedford to work as a draughtsman on airships.

Grimes returned to Wales in 1923 to study Latin at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire in Cardiff, where his lecturers included Mortimer Wheeler and Cyril Fox. Wheeler was also Keeper and then from 1923 Director of the National Museum of Wales. Grimes graduated with first-class honours in 1926.

==Career==
Wheeler moved to become Director of the London Museum in 1926, and Cyril Fox replaced him as Director of the National Museum of Wales. Grimes became an assistant keeper of archaeology at the National Museum of Wales, working with the newly appointed keeper of archaeology, Victor Erle Nash-Williams. He received an MA from the University of Wales in 1930 for a dissertation on the Roman pottery from the 20th Legion&#x27;s works at Holt (then in Denbighshire). He became interested in the prehistory of Wales, and was involved in excavations at Pyle, Ludchurch, Corston Beacon and Llanboidy.

Grimes became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1934. He published a book on the prehistory of Wales in 1939, &quot;Guide to the Collection Illustrating the Prehistory of Wales&quot;, which won the Cambrian Archaeological Association&#x27;s G. T. Clark prize in 1949. The book was republished as &quot;The Prehistory of Wales&quot; in 1951, and a second edition followed in 1959. He met Audrey Williams in 1935, while preparing an exhibition in Swansea for the centenary of the Royal Institution of South Wales. They went on to work together at many excavations in Wales and elsewhere, and were later married.

Grimes moved to Southampton in 1938 to become an assistant archaeology officer with the Ordnance Survey, and was quickly involved in the excavation of the newly discovered ship burial at Sutton Hoo the following year. He was seconded to the Ministry of Works in the Second World War, and worked with Audrey Williams on quick surveys and excavations before the construction of new airfields and other military structures. His discoveries included an Iron Age religious site at Heathrow.

In 1945, he succeeded Mortimer Wheeler as director of the London Museum, then based in Lancaster House. He was involved in the programme to excavate Blitz sites in London before they were redeveloped. For this work, he received the freedom of the City of London in 1952. A highlight was the excavation of the London Mithraeum with Audrey Williams, which was discovered at a building site at Walbrook in 1954. The site was featured in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; illustrated with drawings by Alan Sorrell.

The unexpected discovery of a bust of Mithras on the last scheduled day of the excavation generated considerable press and public interest, debates in Parliament and discussion in the Cabinet. The excavation was extended, allowing further discoveries to be made, but delaying the construction. Although Bucklersbury House was built over the site, Grimes succeeded in salvaging many of its finds and features including marble statuary attesting to the wealth of its congregation. The temple was reconstructed nearby in the 1960s, but the work was not supervised by archaeologists and Grimes was dismissive of the result.

Grimes was appointed CBE in 1955. He continued his excavations in London after he succeeded V. Gordon Childe as director of the Institute of Archaeology and professor of archaeology at the University of London in 1956 (Wheeler had founded the Institute in 1937, and Childe became director after Wheeler resigned in 1946). While Grimes was its director, the Institute moved from St John&#x27;s Lodge in Regent&#x27;s Park to new premises at Gordon Square.

Grimes remained interested in the archaeology of Wales. He received an honorary DLitt from the University of Wales in 1961, and was president of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1963–64. He served on many commissions and committees with a variety of official bodies and archaeological societies and organisations, including the Society of Antiquaries, the Royal Archaeological Institute, and the Council for British Archaeology. He was a member of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales for 30 years from 1948, also serving a period as chairman, and joined the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England in 1964. He retired from both commissions in 1978. Between 1975 and 1988 he served as the first chairman of the Dyfed Archaeological Trust.

==Private life==
Grimes married a childhood friend Barbara Lilian Morgan in 1928. They had two children. They were divorced in 1959, and he became the third husband of Audrey Williams. She bestowed on him the nickname Peter. They retired to her home in Brynmill in Swansea in 1973. After Audrey died in 1978, he was remarried to Mrs Molly Waverley Sholto Douglas in 1980.

He suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease in later life, and died at home in Swansea. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at Pwlldu Bay on the Gower Peninsula, where the ashes of his second wife Audrey had also been scattered.

<text>Wörthersee (; Slovene: &quot;Vrbsko jezero&quot;, ) is a lake in the southern Austrian state of Carinthia. The bathing lake is a main tourist destination in summer.

==Geography==

Wörthersee is Carinthia&#x27;s largest lake. It is elongated, about long and wide, and stretches from the outskirts of the Carinthian capital Klagenfurt in the east to the bay of Velden in the west. Situated within the Klagenfurt Basin, its shores are flanked to the north and south by the foothills of the Gurktal Alps and the Karawanks range, all covered with dense forests beyond which snow-capped Alpine peaks are visible. The lake&#x27;s water is of a distinctive blue-green colour and transparent.

Lake Wörth and its basin in the central Carinthian foothills were largely formed by glaciers during the last ice age. The lake is divided into three basins by several islands and peninsulas. The western basin stretches from Velden to Pörtschach, the central basin from Pörtschach to Maria Wörth and the eastern basin from Maria Wörth to Klagenfurt. Numerous brooks flow into the lake; its sole outlet is the Glanfurt river in the east, eventually flowing into the Drava (Drau) river via the Glan and Gurk tributaries.

The northern shore is densely built up with the main resort towns of Krumpendorf, Pörtschach, and Velden. The Süd Autobahn motorway and a railway mainline occupy the narrow space between the steep hills and the shore. The southern shore is quieter and less developed. 

The water surface (epilimnion) can reach up to 25 °C in summer. In winter, the region is often covered by snow and approximately every 10 years the lake freezes over, attracting numerous ice skaters. Lake Wörth&#x27;s fauna is dominated by fish typically found in alpine lakes. The most common species are the pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;) and the common whitefish (&quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;).

==Etymology==
First mentioned as &quot;Werdse&quot; in an 1143 deed, the lake&#x27;s name originates from the islands in the lake, most notably Maria Wörth, a peninsula since the building of the Glanfurt outlet in 1770. Other islands are Schlangeninsel and Kapuzinerinsel; the former island of Maria Loretto is today also a peninsula. Until the 19th century the lake was called &quot;Werdersee&quot; (cf. Old High German &quot;weride&quot;: &quot;island&quot; or &quot;ait&quot;), i.e. &quot;Island Lake&quot;, but also Klagenfurt Lake or Velden Lake (as in Slovene: &quot;Vrbsko jezero&quot;).

==Tourism==

In the early 19th century the marshy shores were home only to a handful of poor peasants. The opening of the Austrian Southern Railway line (&quot;Südbahn&quot;) to Klagenfurt in 1863, later extended to Villach along the northern shore, quickly turned the Wörthersee into an exclusive summer retreat for Vienna&#x27;s nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie. Especially Velden and Pörtschach developed to main tourist resorts.

Up to today, the Mediterranean climate and the clean, warm waters make Lake Wörth a popular tourist destination in summer. Although the region around the lake has been termed &quot;Austria&#x27;s Monte Carlo&quot;, in recent decades tourism around Lake Wörthersee has suffered from tough competition from package holidays to cheaper overseas destinations. As a response a number of local businesses have tried to focus on niches such as high quality tourism, family tourism or golf and horse-riding vacations.

Most tourists visit the Lake in the months of July and August when water temperatures reach 25 °C. A large proportion of visitors return every summer and some own or rent holiday homes along the shore. The vast majority of visitors come from Vienna, northern Germany and the Netherlands.

The largest Volkswagen and Audi car show in Europe, the &quot;Wörthersee GTI-Treffen&quot; (in English, &quot;Wörthersee Meeting&quot; or simply &quot;Wörthersee&quot;), has been held in the lakeside town of Reifnitz (usually in May) every year from 1982 to 2021 (the 2022 event was cancelled due to the organisational problems). The municipality have announced in February 2023 that no &quot;GTI-Treffen&quot; would be permitted anymore. The organisers issued the statement: &quot;the effects of climate change, the responsibility of political decision-makers for the preservation of ecosystems, and the need to align actions at all levels according to the principles of sustainability make it necessary to place the future design under new premises. On the basis of these considerations, we can state the municipality of Maria Worth will no longer host any conventional major automotive events in the next few years.&quot;

==Transportation==
The &quot;A2 Süd Autobahn&quot; motorway (European Route E66) from Vienna to Italy passes along the northern side of the lake, as does the &quot;B83 Kärntner Straße&quot; highway connecting Klagenfurt with Villach and the &quot;Südbahn&quot; railway line from Vienna to Venice. There is also a cycle path along the northern shore. In summer, passenger boats connect the largest settlements. The number of private speedboats is strictly limited by a quota system to limit the environmental damage and hazard to swimmers.

<text>William Reid &quot;Bill&quot; Pogue (January 23, 1930 – March 3, 2014) was an American astronaut and pilot who served in the United States Air Force (USAF) as a fighter pilot and test pilot, and reached the rank of colonel. He was also a teacher, public speaker and author.

Born and educated in Oklahoma, Pogue graduated from Oklahoma Baptist University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education and enlisted in the USAF in 1951 and served for 24 years. He flew combat during the Korean War and with the USAF Thunderbirds, then served as a flight instructor. Following graduation from Oklahoma State University with a Master of Science degree in 1960, he served as mathematics professor at the United States Air Force Academy, and after training at the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School, he was a test pilot whose service included a two-years exchange with the Royal Air Force (RAF).

During his service as a flight instructor, Pogue was accepted as a trainee astronaut for NASA in 1966. His NASA career included one orbital mission as pilot of Skylab 4, whose crew conducted dozens of in-orbit research experiments and set a duration record of 84 days—the longest crewed flight—that was unbroken in NASA for over 20 years. The mission also had a dispute with ground control over schedule management that news media named The Skylab Mutiny. Pogue retired from the USAF and NASA a few months after he returned from Skylab, after which he taught and wrote about aviation and aeronautics in the U.S. and abroad. Pogue died in 2014, aged 84.

==Early life and education==
William Pogue was born on January 23, 1930, in Okemah, Oklahoma, to Alex Wallis Pogue (1904–1998) and Margaret Frances Pogue (; 1906–1994) and he self-identifies as being of Choctaw descent. William had four siblings; two sisters and two brothers.
 Pogue attended Lake Elementary School and Sand Springs High School (now Charles Page High School) in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, completing his high-school education in 1947. He participated in the Boy Scouts of America, earning the rank of Second Class. Pogue attended Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee, Oklahoma, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education in 1951. In 1960, he graduated from Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma, with a Master of Science degree in Mathematics.

==Career==
===Flight experience===
Pogue was attracted to flying from an early age; he first flew an airplane while in high school. Pogue enlisted in the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1951, underwent the aviation cadet training program in 1952. He was later commissioned into the USAF as a second lieutenant. While serving with the Fifth Air Force from 1953 to 1954 during the Korean War, he flew 43 combat missions in fighter bombers while completing a tour of duty. From 1955 to 1957, Pogue was a member of the USAF Thunderbirds as an aerobatics pilot.

Pogue piloted more than 50 types and models of American and British aircraft, and was qualified as a civilian flight instructor. Pogue served in the mathematics department as an assistant professor at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, from 1960 to 1963. He applied to become an astronaut in 1962, but was rejected due to a lack of pilot experience. In September 1965, Pogue completed a two-year tour as test pilot with the British Ministry of Aviation under an exchange program between the USAF and Royal Air Force and graduated from the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School in Farnborough, England. He was an Air Force major at the time, and went to the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, from an assignment at Edwards Air Force Base, California, where he had been an instructor at the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School since October 1965.

===NASA career===

In April 1966, Pogue was one of 19 astronauts selected by NASA in Group 5 of the Apollo program. He served as a member of the support crews for the Apollo 7, Apollo 11, 13 and Apollo 14 missions. He replaced Ed Givens, who died in a car accident, as Capsule Communicator for Apollo 7. No crew members were assigned to the canceled Apollo missions but if normal crew rotation had been followed, Pogue would have been assigned as command module pilot for the Apollo 19 mission.

Pogue was the pilot of Skylab 4, the third and final crewed visit to the Skylab Orbital Workshop, from November 16, 1973, to February 8, 1974. At 84 days, 1 hour and 15 minutes, it was the longest crewed flight to that date. It held the record for the longest spaceflight until 1978, when the crew of Soviet ship Salyut 6 spent 140 days at the space station. Pogue was accompanied on the flight by Commander Gerald Carr and science pilot Edward Gibson. As a crew, they completed 56 experiments, 26 science demonstrations, 15 subsystem detailed objectives, and 13 student investigations across 1,214 revolutions of the Earth.

After around six weeks of flight, there were disagreements between crew and ground control. On December 28, 1973, radio transmission was turned off with the crew spending the time relaxing and gazing at the Earth from orbit. The incident was later referred to as the Skylab mutiny. Pogue later commented that the team was “studying the Sun, the Earth below, and ourselves.” Once radio transmission had resumed, an agreement for the flight to continue; with tensions being significantly diminished. Pogue commented in 1985 that the flight had made him more empathetic, saying “I try to put myself into the human situation, instead of trying to operate like a machine.”

The crew also acquired extensive Earth resources observations data using Skylab&#x27;s Earth resources experiment package camera and sensor array, and logged 338 hours of operations of the Apollo Telescope Mount that made extensive observations of the sun&#x27;s processes. Pogue and Carr viewed a comet transiting the sky during an extravehicular activity (EVA). He logged 13 hours and 34 minutes in two EVAs outside the orbital workshop. On September 1, 1975, Pogue retired from the USAF, as a colonel, and NASA, to become vice president of High Flight Foundation. Pogue logged 7,200 hours of flight time, including 4,200 hours in jet aircraft and 2,000 hours in space flight during his career.

===Post-NASA activities===
After he retired from NASA, William Pogue was self-employed as an aerospace consultant and a producer of general-interest videos about space flight. In 1985, Pogue wrote a book called &quot;How Do You Go to the Bathroom in Space?&quot;, answering 187 common questions he received about spaceflight. In 1992, he co-wrote &quot;The Trikon Deception&quot;, a science-fiction novel, with Ben Bova. He also became a consultant for aircraft manufacturers including Boeing and Martin Marietta, helping to create space station technology. Pogue continuously presented lectures over a 40-year career, working at more than 500 schools and 100 civic clubs.

==Personal life==
William Pogue married three times; his first marriage was in 1952 to Helen Juanita Dittmar, with whom he had three children. The couple later divorced. He married Jean Ann Baird in 1979 and the marriage lasted until Baird&#x27;s death in 2009. Pogue&#x27;s last marriage was to Tina, whom he wed in 2012.

===Death===
During the night of March 3, 2014, at the age of 84, Pogue died from natural causes at his home in Cocoa Beach, Florida. His ashes were sent into Earth orbit using Celestis, a memorial rocket service launch on a Falcon Heavy rocket on June 25, 2019. A plaque commemorating his life was erected at Sand Springs, Oklahoma.

== In popular culture ==
The 6139-6005 model Seiko watch which Pogue took on his Skylab mission as his personal watch is known to watch collectors as the &quot;Pogue&quot;. It is of interest to collectors because it is the first automatic chronograph in space and unusual because NASA astronauts generally wore their NASA-issued Omega Speedmaster.

==Special honors==
Pogue and his crew members received many awards. Pogue won the Johnson Space Center Superior Achievement Award in 1970. Three Skylab crews, including Pogue, were awarded the 1973 Robert J. Collier Trophy. In 1974, President Richard Nixon presented the Skylab 4 crew with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, and the awarded the crew the De La Vaulx Medal and Vladimir Komarov Diploma that year. Pogue was among nine Skylab astronauts who were presented with the City of Chicago Gold Medal in 1974 after a parade with 150,000 spectators. The American Astronautical Society&#x27;s 1975 Flight Achievement Award was awarded to the crew. Gerald P. Carr accepted the 1975 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy from President Gerald Ford, which was awarded to the Skylab astronauts, who also won the AIAA Haley Astronautics Award in 1975.

William R. Pogue Municipal Airport in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, was named in Pogue&#x27;s honor in 1974. The Oklahoma Aviation and Space Museum awarded him the Clarence E. Page Memorial Trophy for &quot;making significant and ongoing contributions to the U.S. aviation industry&quot; in February 1989. Page died eight days before the award was presented and Pogue used most of his speech to memorialize Page&#x27;s life. Pogue was awarded an honorary doctorate of science from Oklahoma Baptist University in 1974. Pogue received the City of New York gold medal and the General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy for the same year.

Pogue has been inducted into three halls of fame. He was inducted into the Five Civilized Tribes Hall of Fame in 1975, and was one of five Oklahoman astronauts inducted into the Oklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Fame in 1980. Pogue was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. As a member of the USAF Thunderbirds, he won the Air Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.

<text>Jabesh () was the father of Shallum of the Kingdom of Israel according to the Hebrew Bible. 

Jabesh is mentioned In the Books of Kings (, ). However, the passage may instead mention a toponym, identifying that Shallum was &quot;the son&quot; of a city called Jabesh. In this view, Shallum may have originated from the Israelite town of Jabesh-Gilead. 

The name means &quot;dry&quot; in Hebrew.

<doc id="635284" wikidata="Q706739" url="?curid=635284" title="Scott E. Parazynski">
<text>Scott Edward Parazynski (born July 28, 1961, in Little Rock, Arkansas) is an American physician and a former NASA astronaut. A veteran of five Space Shuttle flights and seven spacewalks, Parazynski&#x27;s latest mission was STS-120 in October 2007 – highlighted by a dramatic, unplanned extra-vehicular activity (EVA) to repair a live solar array. In May 2016 he was inducted into the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame. His passion and determination continue to inspire, exemplified by the lasting impact he had on a friend of his son, Luke, who once spoke to Parazynski during a space mission—a moment that left a lifelong impression. He retired from NASA in March 2009 to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities in the private sector, and he is currently the CEO of a technology start-up. He is the first person to have both flown in space and summited Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. He describes his life&#x27;s experiences in his memoir &quot;The Sky Below&quot;.

==Personal life==
Parazynski is of Polish descent, as his great-great-grandparents migrated from Kraków to the US. He considers Palo Alto, California, and Evergreen, Colorado, to be his hometowns. He is married to Meenakshi Wadhwa, a planetary scientist at Arizona State University. He has two children with his first wife, Gail. Scott enjoys mountaineering, rock climbing, flying and scuba diving. A commercial, multi-engine, seaplane and instrument-rated pilot, Parazynski has logged over 2500 flight hours in a variety of aircraft. As a mountaineer, his summits include Cerro Aconcagua (at above sea level, the tallest mountain in the world outside Asia) and all 59 of Colorado&#x27;s peaks over in altitude. He first attempted to summit Mount Everest in May 2008, but was forced to turn back before the summit due to a severe back injury. Serving as team physician for the Discovery Channel a year later, at 4:00 am on May 20, 2009, he successfully summitted the mountain.

Other notable expeditions include a scientific dive into the summit caldera lake atop Licancabur Volcano ( on the Bolivian-Chilean border), one of the world&#x27;s highest lakes, and setting the first bootprints adjacent Masaya Volcano&#x27;s lava lake in Nicaragua with Sam Cossman in 2016. He also travelled aboard OceanGate&#x27;s submersible &quot;Titan&quot; and visited the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in the North Atlantic.

==Education and early life==
Parazynski attended junior high school in Dakar, Senegal, and Beirut, Lebanon. In March 1969 as an eight-year-old, he travelled to Florida to witness the launch of Apollo 9, an event he argued inspired him to pursue a career in science. He attended high school at the Community School, Tehran, Iran, and the American Community School, Athens, Greece, graduating in 1979. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from Stanford University in 1983, continuing on to graduate with honors from Stanford Medical School in 1989. He served his medical internship at the Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital of Harvard Medical School (1990). He had completed 22 months of a residency program in emergency medicine in Denver, Colorado, when selected for the NASA Astronaut Corps.

==Organizations==
Parazynski is a Fellow of the Aerospace Medical Association and The Explorers Club. Additionally, he is a member of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology, the Wilderness Medical Society, the American Alpine Club, the Association of Space Explorers, the Experimental Aircraft Association, and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. He is president of the board of directors of the Challenger Center for Space Science Education, and serves on the boards of the Houston Museum of Natural Science, the University of Texas McDonald Observatory and OceanGate.

In 2014, Parazynski was appointed as a professor of practice at Arizona State University, and was designated ASU&#x27;s first University Explorer. He subsequently founded Fluidity Technologies based on his intellectual property, a company aiming to manufacture and distribute novel control devices for mobility in 3-D space, for everything from drones and computer games to VR and surgical robotics.

While in medical school, he competed on the United States Development Luge Team and was ranked among the top ten competitors in the nation during the 1988 Olympic Trials. He also served as an Olympic Team Coach for the Philippines during the 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary, Canada.

==Medical career==
While an undergraduate at Stanford University, Parazynski studied antigenic shift in African sleeping sickness, using sophisticated molecular biology techniques. During medical school, he was awarded a NASA graduate student fellowship and conducted research at NASA Ames Research Center on fluid shifts that occur during human space flight. Additionally, he has been involved in the design of several exercise devices that are being developed for long-duration space flight, and has conducted research on high-altitude acclimatization. Parazynski has numerous publications in the field of space physiology, and has a particular expertise in human adaptation to stressful environments.

==NASA career==
Selected as an astronaut in March 1992, Parazynski reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He completed one year of training and evaluation, and was qualified as a mission specialist. Parazynski initially served as one of the crew representatives for extra-vehicular activity (EVA) in the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch. Following his first flight, he was assigned as a backup for the third American long-duration stay aboard Russia&#x27;s space station Mir, and was expected to serve as a prime crew member on a subsequent mission. He spent five months in training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Star City, Moscow, Russia.

In October 1995, when sitting-height parameters raised concerns about his fitting safely in the Soyuz spacecraft in the event of an emergency on board the Mir station, he was deemed too tall for the mission and was withdrawn from Mir training. He has served as the Astronaut Office Operations Planning Branch crew representative for Space Shuttle, Space Station and Soyuz training, and also served as Deputy (Operations and Training) of the Astronaut Office ISS Branch. Most recently, he served as Chief of the Astronaut Office EVA Branch. A veteran of five space flights, STS-66 (1994), STS-86 (1997), STS-95 (1998), STS-100 (2001), and STS-120 (2007), Parazynski has logged over 1,019 hours (8 weeks) in space, including 47 hours of EVA, and traveled over 17 million miles. Parazynski&#x27;s most recent mission was STS-120, during which he performed four spacewalks to continue International Space Station assembly. The fourth EVA is considered one of the most challenging and dangerous ever performed: while perched on the end of a 90-foot robotic boom, further away from the safety of the airlock than anyone had previously ventured, he had to repair a fully energized solar array. He became only the second NASA astronaut to perform four spacewalks during a single shuttle mission. A photo that he took during one of the spacewalks was listed on &quot;Popular Science&quot;″s photo gallery of the best astronaut selfies.

==Spaceflight experience==

The STS-66 Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-3 (ATLAS-3) mission was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 3, 1994, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on November 14, 1994. ATLAS-3 was part of an ongoing program to determine the Earth&#x27;s energy balance and atmospheric change over an 11-year solar cycle, particularly with respect to humanity&#x27;s impact on global-ozone distribution. Parazynski had responsibility for a number of on-orbit activities including operation of the ATLAS experiments and Spacelab Pallet, as well as several secondary experiments in the crew cabin. He and his crewmates also successfully evaluated the Interlimb Resistance Device, a free-floating exercise he developed to prevent muscular atrophy in microgravity. Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; circled the earth 175 times and traveled over 4.5 million miles during its 262-hour and 34-minute flight.

STS-86 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (September 25 to October 6, 1997) was the seventh mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. Highlights of the mission included the exchange of U.S. crew members Michael Foale and David Wolf, the transfer of 10,400 pounds of science and logistics, and the first Shuttle-based joint American-Russian spacewalk. Parazynski served as the flight engineer (MS2) during the flight, and was also the navigator during the Mir rendezvous. Parazynski (EV1) and Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Titov performed a 5-hour, 1 minute spacewalk during which they retrieved four experiment packages first deployed during the STS-76 Shuttle-Mir docking mission. They also deployed the Spektr Solar Array Cap, which was designed to be used in a future Mir spacewalk to seal a leak in the Spektr module&#x27;s damaged hull. Other objectives of EVA included the evaluation of common EVA tools to be used by astronauts wearing either Russian or American-made spacesuits, and a systems flight test of the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER). Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; circled the Earth 169 times and traveled over 4.2 million miles during its 259-hour and 21-minute flight, landing at the Kennedy Space Center.

STS-95 &quot;Discovery&quot; (October 29 to November 7, 1998) was a nine-day mission during which the crew supported a variety of research payloads, including deployment of the Spartan solar-observing spacecraft and the testing of the Hubble Space Telescope Orbital Systems Test Platform. The crew also conducted investigations on the correlation between space flight and the aging process. Parazynski was the flight engineer (MS2) for the mission, as well as the navigator for the Spartan spacecraft rendezvous. During the flight, he also operated the Shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm in support of the testing of several space-vision systems being considered for ISS assembly. In addition, he was responsible for monitoring several life sciences investigations, including those involving crewmate Senator John Glenn. The mission was accomplished in 134 Earth orbits, traveling 3.6 million miles in 213 hours and 44 minutes.

STS-100 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (April 19 to May 1, 2001) was the 9th mission to the International Space Station (ISS) Alpha during which the crew successfully delivered and installed the Space Station &quot;Canadarm2&quot; robotic arm, to be used for all future Space Station assembly and maintenance tasks. Parazynski conducted two spacewalks with Canadian colleague Chris Hadfield to assemble and power the next generation robotic arm. Additionally, the pair installed a new UHF radio antenna for space-to-space communications during Space Shuttle rendezvous and ISS extravehicular activity. A critical on-orbit spare, a direct current switching unit, was also transferred to Alpha during the 14 hours and 50 minutes of EVA work. Also during the flight, Parazynski operated &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s robotic arm to attach, and later detach, the Italian-built &quot;Raffaello&quot; Multi-Purpose Logistics Module. Traveling 4.9 million miles in 283 hours and 30 minutes, the mission was accomplished in 186 Earth orbits.

STS-120 &quot;Discovery&quot; (October 23 – November 7, 2007) launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the mission, the Node 2 module named &quot;Harmony&quot; was delivered to the International Space Station. This element opened up the capability for future international laboratories to be added to the station. Parazynski served as EV1 (lead spacewalker) and accumulated over 27 EVA hours in 4 spacewalks. One of the major EVA mission objectives was the relocation of the P6 Solar Array from the top of the Z1 Truss to the end of the port side of the Integrated Truss Structure. During the IVA-commanded re-deploy of the solar array, several array panels snagged and were damaged, requiring an unplanned spacewalk to successfully repair the array. The mission was accomplished in 238 Earth orbits, traveling 6.2 million miles in 15 days, 2 hours, and 23 minutes.

== Book ==
In 2017, Parazynski&#x27;s book, &quot;The Sky Below: A True Story of Summits, Space and Speed&quot;, with co-author Susy Flory, was published. Homer Hickam called it “a wonder, a fellow who has packed in more exploits in his lifetime than most of us can imagine.”

<text>Pohatcong Creek (also called the Pohatcong River) is a tributary of the Delaware River in northwestern New Jersey in the United States.

It rises in the mountains of eastern Warren County, west of Hackettstown. It flows southwest, in a valley along the northwestern side of the Pohatcong Mountain ridge, which separates its watershed from that of the Musconetcong River. It joins the Delaware in Pohatcong Township, approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) south of Phillipsburg.

The name Pohatcong is said to have thought of a Munsee phrase — &quot;pohwihtukwung&quot;, or &quot;at the rippling or lapping river&quot;.

<text>Morumbi () is one of the richest neighborhoods in São Paulo and is a district of the city of São Paulo belonging to the subprefecture of Butantã, in the southwestern part of the city. A common folk etymology attributes its name to the mixed Portuguese and Tupi phrase &quot;morro obi&quot;, which would mean &quot;green hill&quot;, but this is disputed, On December 29, 2022, Brazilian football star Pele died at the age of 82 in Morumbi.

Morumbi is between away from São Paulo&#x27;s downtown. It has boundaries with the districts of Vila Sônia, Campo Limpo, Vila Andrade, Itaim Bibi, Pinheiros, and Butantã. Within Morumbi, the neighborhoods of Vila Progredior, Caxingüi, Jardim Guedala, Cidade Jardim, Real Parque, Vila Morumbi, Paineiras do Morumbi, Jardim Panorama, Jardim Sílvia, Vila Tramontano and Paraisópolis are found.

== Toponym ==
There are several etymological explanations for &quot;Morumbi&quot;:

* It is a term of Tupi origin that means &quot;green fly&quot;, through the combination of the terms &quot;moru&quot; (fly) and &quot;mbi&quot; (green).
* According to Eduardo de Almeida Navarro, &quot;Morumbi&quot; would come from the General Language word &quot;maromby&quot;, from a purpurted &quot;*maromba&quot; (&quot;big fish&quot;) and &quot;y&quot; (&quot;river&quot;), and would mean &quot;river of the big fish&quot;.

== Points of interest ==
Morumbi is known nationally for being home to São Paulo Futebol Clube&#x27;s main ground, Estádio do Morumbi. In honour of that, one of the district&#x27;s subway stations is named after the club, São Paulo-Morumbi is the closest station to the stadium and responsible for connecting the district&#x27;s main attraction to the city&#x27;s metro system.

<text>The 2004 election of members to the Senate of the Philippines was the 28th election to the Senate of the Philippines. It was held on Monday, May 10, 2004, to elect 12 of the 24 seats in the Senate. The major coalitions that participated are the Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan, composed of parties that support the candidacy of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and the Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino, composed of parties that support the candidacy of film actor Fernando Poe Jr. coalition. The Alyansa ng Pag-asa was a minor coalition made up of Aksyon Demokratiko and Partido para sa Demokratikong Reporma–Lapiang Manggagawa. K4 won seven seats, while the KNP won the remaining five contested seats. 

The elections were notable for several reasons. This election first saw the implementation of the Overseas Absentee Voting Act of 2003 &quot;(see )&quot;, which enabled Filipinos in over 70 countries to vote.

== Electoral system ==
Philippine Senate elections are via pluraity block voting, with the entire country as an at-large &quot;district&quot;. Each voter has 12 votes, and can vote for up to 12 candidates. Seats up were the seats last contested in 1998. 

==Parties and coalitions==
This election has seen strong shifts of alliances and new parties as candidates switched allegiances. The two major coalitions seen in this elections were the pro-administration K-4 and the KNP as the &quot;united opposition&quot;.

===Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan (K-4)===
The Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan (Coalition of Honesty and Experience for the Future) was the remnant of the People Power Coalition that was formed following the ascendancy of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to power. Arroyo was seeking a full term under the K4 coalition with Senator Noli de Castro, an independent, popular politician, as her running mate. The leading party in this coalition is the ruling Lakas—Christian Muslim Democrats, of which Arroyo was a member. Other parties under this coalition are Liberal Party, Nacionalista Party, Nationalist People&#x27;s Coalition and People&#x27;s Reform Party.

===Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (KNP)===
The Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (Coalition of United Filipinos) was the coalition of the &quot;united opposition&quot;. Its presidential and vice-presidential candidates were Fernando Poe Jr. and Senator Loren Legarda. The leading parties of this coalition were Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino—Angara wing, PDP–Laban, and Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino. The LDP split had been caused by stubbornness between presidentiables Poe and Senator Panfilo Lacson, especially with Poe&#x27;s support from former President Joseph Estrada and former First Lady Imelda Marcos. The other major party under this coalition was Estrada&#x27;s &quot;Partido ng Masang Pilipino.&quot;

===Alyansa ng Pag-asa===
The third major coalition running in this election is the &quot;Alyansa ng Pag-asa&quot; (Alliance of Hope), This coalition fielded Raul Roco for president and Herminio Aquino for vice-president. The three major parties supporting this coalition were Roco&#x27;s Aksyon Demokratiko, former National Defense Secretary Renato de Villa&#x27;s Partido para sa Demokratikong Reporma, and former Cebu Governor Lito Osmeña&#x27;s Probinsya Muna Development Initiative.

<text>Paul Guimard (3 March 1921 – 2 May 2004) was a French writer known for combining his passion for writing with his love of the sea. His most famous work was &quot;Les Choses de la Vie&quot;, which was adapted for film, with a complete change of its ending, by Claude Sautet, with Romy Schneider and Michel Piccoli.

==Biography==
Guimard was born at Saint-Mars-la-Jaille (Loire-Atlantique). He married Benoîte Groult. Following a poor performance at the private Saint-Stanislas school of Nantes, he began a career as a journalist. During World War II he reported for the provincial paper &quot;L&#x27;Echo de la Loire&quot; and later had a job as a news editor for another regional daily, &quot;L&#x27;Ouest-Eclair&quot;. He covered French broadcasting in the op-ed pages of &quot;Tribune de Paris&quot; for four years.

In 1945 he wrote a comedy, &quot;Seventh Sky&quot;, which played briefly. His literary career began in 1956 with the successful, award-winning novel &quot;False Friends&quot;. His next award winner, &quot;Rue du Havre&quot;, followed a year later.

In 1960 Guimard wrote the comedy &quot;A Best Man&quot; with his friend Antoine Blondin in Paris. One year later, he published &quot;The Irony of Fate&quot; which, like &quot;Rue du Havre&quot;, explores the role of chance in human relationships. The book was the basis for a film by Edouard Molinaro.

==Later years==
Guimard was in charge of a mission for the French President François Mitterrand from Mitterrand&#x27;s election in 1981 until August 1982. &quot;My only regret is not to have obtained at the time of my passage to the Elysium the creation of an academy of the Sea&quot;, Guimard said, affirming that this experiment &quot;was not directed, but only one long accident&quot;.

Guimard was a member of the audio-visual communication authority from 1982 to 1986. He then returned to literature after a decade. He published a short story on Giraudoux, &quot;Giraudoux? Hello!... &quot; (1988) and novels such as &quot;A Combination of Circumstances&quot; (1990), &quot;The Stone Age&quot; (1992), and &quot;First Comers&quot; (1997).

In 1993 he received a lifetime achievement award from the Foundation of Prince Pierre of Monaco.

Paul Guimard died in Hyères (Var). He was married to French feminist and optimistic writer Benoîte Groult, who shared his love of navigation. The style of both writers slightly converged in that respect; Groult&#x27;s latest works (&quot;Les Vaisseaux du coeur&quot;) are more nostalgic, and Guimard&#x27;s &quot;brother&quot; novel, also about human destiny and sea (&quot;Le Mauvais temps&quot;), is more sensible to the role of human will as opposed to fate.

==Works==
Most of Guimard&#x27;s novels deal about the role of randomness in life (mainly &quot;L&#x27;Ironie du sort&quot;), time, man&#x27;s understanding of hidden and ironic structures in which he is trapped. His latest work (&quot;Le Mauvais temps&quot;) describes a major transformation of a character who finally understands in dramatic circumstances the price of life and the importance of personal choice, changing his desperate life for the best.

<doc id="635301" wikidata="Q3944777" url="?curid=635301" title="Saffron Hill">
<text>Saffron Hill is a street and former ward in Holborn, in the south eastern corner of the London Borough of Camden, between Farringdon Road and Hatton Garden. The name of the street derives from the fact that it was at one time part of an estate on which saffron grew. The ecclesiastical parish was St Peter, Saffron Hill, a daughter parish of Holborn, which is now combined with St Alban (the Martyr), Holborn.

In 1850, it was described as a squalid neighbourhood, the home of paupers and thieves. In Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1837), the Artful Dodger leads Oliver to Fagin&#x27;s den in Field Lane, the southern extension of Saffron Hill: &quot;a dirty and more wretched place he [Oliver] had never seen. The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours&quot;.

==Little Italy==

Saffron Hill is mentioned in the Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons&quot;, as the Italian Quarter where the Venucci family can be found. The area still retains a local nomenclature of &quot;Little Italy&quot;. Annually On the nearest Sunday to July 16 the procession of Our Lady of Mount Carmel takes place, a Roman Catholic manifestation of faith starting from St Peter&#x27;s RC Church on Clerkenwell Road. It was from Saffron Hill that Darby Sabini operated his criminal gangs in the 1920s and 30s

Saffron Hill formed part of the liberty of Saffron Hill, Hatton Garden, Ely Rents and Ely Place which became part of the County of London in 1889. It was abolished in 1900 and formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn until 1965.

Saffron Hill has become more residential in recent years with the building of several blocks of &#x27;luxury&#x27; apartments, including Da Vinci House situated in the former &quot;Punch magazine&quot; printworks and the architecturally distinctive Ziggurat Building.

<text>In statistics, the Page test for multiple comparisons between ordered correlated variables is the counterpart of Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient which summarizes the association of continuous variables. It is also known as Page&#x27;s trend test or Page&#x27;s &quot;L&quot; test. It is a repeated measure trend test.

The Page test is useful where:
*there are three or more conditions,
*a number of subjects (or other randomly sampled entities) are all observed in each of them, and
*we predict that the observations will have a particular order.

For example, a number of subjects might each be given three trials at the same task, and we predict that performance will improve from trial to trial. A test of the significance of the trend between conditions in this situation was developed by Ellis Batten Page (1963). More formally, the test considers the null hypothesis that, for &quot;n&quot; conditions, where &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a measure of the central tendency of the &quot;i&quot;th condition,

:formula_1

against the alternative hypothesis that

:formula_2

It has more statistical power than the Friedman test against the alternative that there is a difference in trend. Friedman&#x27;s test considers the alternative hypothesis that the central tendencies of the observations under the &quot;n&quot; conditions are different without specifying their order.

Procedure for the Page test, with &quot;k&quot; subjects each exposed to &quot;n&quot; conditions:

*Arrange the &quot;n&quot; conditions in the order implied by the alternative hypothesis, and assign each of them a rank &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
*For each of the &quot;k&quot; subjects separately, rank the &quot;n&quot; observations from 1 to &quot;n&quot;.
*Add the ranks for each condition to give a total &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
*Multiply &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; by &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; and add all the products together; this sum is called &quot;L&quot;.
*To test whether there is a significant trend, values of &quot;L&quot; can be compared with those tabulated by Page (1963).

:Alternatively, the quantity

::formula_3

:may be compared with values of the chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. This gives a two-tailed test. The approximation is reliable for more than 20 subjects with any number of conditions, for more than 12 subjects when there are 4 or more conditions, and for any number of subjects when there are 9 or more conditions.
*If a measure of the overall correlation between the conditions and the data is required, it can be calculated as

::ρ = 12&quot;L&quot;/&quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3 − &quot;n&quot;) − 3(&quot;n&quot; + 1)/(&quot;n&quot; − 1)

:if &quot;k&quot; = 1, this reduces to the familiar Spearman coefficient.

The Page test is most often used with fairly small numbers of conditions and subjects. The minimum values of &quot;L&quot; for significance at the 0.05 level, one-tailed, with three conditions, are 56 for 4 subjects (the lowest number that is capable of giving a significant result at this level), 54 for 5 subjects, 91 for 7 subjects, 128 for 10 subjects, 190 for 15 subjects and 251 for 20 subjects..

A corresponding extension of Kendall&#x27;s tau was developed by Jonckheere (1954).

<text>The Western Group of Forces (WGF), previously known as the Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany (GSOFG) and the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG), were the troops of the Soviet Army in East Germany. The Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany was formed after the end of World War II in Europe from units of the 1st and 2nd Belorussian Fronts. The group helped suppress the East German uprising of 1953. After the end of occupation functions in 1954 the group was renamed the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. The group represented Soviet interests in East Germany during the Cold War. Before changes in Soviet foreign policy during the early 1990s, the group shifted to a more offensive role and in 1989 became the Western Group of Forces. Russian forces remained in the eastern part of Germany after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and German reunification until 1994.

==History==
The Group of Soviet Occupation Forces, Germany was formed after the end of World War II in Europe from formations of the 1st and 2nd Belorussian Fronts, commanded by Georgy Zhukov. On its creation on 9 June 1945 it included:

The 4th Artillery Corps also became part of the GSFG in 1945. 

An order of 29 May 1945 had ordered the disestablishment of the 47th, 77th, 80th, 89th, 25th, 61st, 91st, 16th, 38th, 62nd, 70th, 121st, and 114th Rifle Corps, and of the 71st, 136th, 162nd, 76th, 82nd, 212th, 356th, 234th, 23rd, 397th, 311th, 415th, 328th, 274th, 370th, 41st, 134th, 312th, 4th, 117th, 247th, 89th, 95th, 64th, 323rd, 362nd, 222nd, 49th, 339th, 383rd, 191st, 380th, 42nd, 139th, 238th, 385th, 200th, 330th, 199th, 1st, 369th, 165th, 169th, 158th, and 346th Rifle Divisions. The 89th Rifle Division was not disbanded and instead transferred to the Caucasus.

In January 1946, the 2nd Shock Army left the Soviet Zone. A month later, the 47th Army was disbanded, with its units withdrawn to the Soviet Union. In October the 5th Shock Army was disbanded. In 1947 the 3rd and 4th Guards Mechanized Divisions (Mobilization), former mechanized armies, arrived in the group from the Central Group of Forces. In 1954 the 3rd Shock Army became the 3rd Red Banner Combined Arms Army (). The 3rd Guards Mechanized Army became the 18th Guards Army on 29 April 1957. On the same day, the 4th Guards Mechanized Army became the 20th Guards Army. 

After the abolition of the occupation functions in 1954, the Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany became known as the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSVG) on 24 March. The legal basis for the GSVG&#x27;s stay in East Germany was the Treaty on Relations between the USSR and the GDR of 1955.

Withdrawals from East Germany in 1956 and 1957/58 comprised more than 70,000 Soviet army personnel, including 18th Guards Army Staff.

The GSFG had the task to ensure for the adherence to the regulations of the Potsdam Agreement. Furthermore, they represented the political and military interests of the Soviet Union. In 1957 an agreement between the governments of the USSR and the GDR laid out the arrangements over the temporary stay of Soviet armed forces on the territory of the GDR, the numerical strength of the Soviet troops, and their assigned posts and exercise areas. It was specified that the Soviet armed forces were not to interfere into the internal affairs of the GDR, as they had done during the East German uprising of 1953.

Following a resolution of the government of the Soviet Union in 1979 and 1980, 20,000 army personnel, 1,000 tanks and much equipment were withdrawn from the territory of the GDR, among them the 6th Guards Tank Division, with headquarters at Wittenberg.

Until the last years of &quot;Perestroika&quot; the GSFG was in the process of realignment as a more offensive force regarding strength, structure and equipment, before a clear reduction of the tank forces in 1989. The GSFG was renamed the Western Group of Forces on 1 June 1989. The withdrawal of the GSFG was one of the largest peacetime troop transfers in military history. Despite the difficulties, which resulted from the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the same period, the departure was carried out according to plan and punctually until August 1994. Between the years of 1992 and 1993, the Western Group of Forces in Germany (along with the Northern Group of Forces) halted military exercises.
The return of the troops and material took place particularly by the sea route by means of the ports in Rostock and the island of Rügen, as well as via Poland. The Russian Ground Forces left Germany on 25 June 1994 with a military parade of the 6th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade in Berlin. The parting ceremony in Wünsdorf on 11 June 1994 and in the Treptow Park in Berlin on 31 August 1994 marked the end of the Russian military presence on German soil.

In addition to German territories, the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany operational territory also included the region of town of Szczecin, part of the territories transferred from Germany to Poland following the end of the Second World War. The rest of Poland fell under the Northern Group of Forces, while the southern regions (Austria, Czechoslovakia) were under the Central Group of Forces.

Generals directing the withdrawals from Germany diverted arms, equipment, and foreign monies intended to build housing in Russia for the withdrawn troops. Several years later, the last GSFG commander, General Matvey Burlakov, and the Defence Minister, Pavel Grachev, had their involvement exposed. They were also accused of ordering the murder of reporter Dmitry Kholodov, who had been investigating the scandals.

==Structure and equipment in 1991==

The Soviet troops occupied 777 barracks at 276 locations on the territory of the German Democratic Republic. This also included 47 airfields and 116 exercise areas. At the beginning of 1991 there were still about 338,000 soldiers in 24 divisions, distributed among five land armies and an air army in what was by then the Western Group of Forces. In addition, there were about 208,000 relatives of officers as well as civil employees, among them about 90,000 children. Most locations were in the area of today&#x27;s Brandenburg.

In 1991 there were approximately 4,200 tanks, 8,200 armored vehicles, 3,600 artillery pieces, 106,000 other motor vehicles, 690 aircraft, 680 helicopters, and 180 rocket systems.

At the end of the 1980s, the primary Soviet formations included:

*3rd Red Banner Army – Magdeburg (as of 1988)
**7th Guards Tank Division – Dessau-Rosslau
**10th Guards Uralsko-Lvovskaya Tank Division – Altengrabow

**105th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Division – Großenhain
**125th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Division – Rechlin [town, not in airfield] – disbanded July 1993 or October 1993.
**126th Fighter Aviation Division – Zerbst

Other Group-level formations included:
*6th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade (Karlshorst, Berlin) - withdrawn to Kursk in 1994
*35th Guards Air Assault Brigade (effectively an airmobile brigade; Cottbus, Germany, activated October 1979, and transferred to Kapchagay, Kazakh SSR, in April 1991. Eventually became part of the Kazakh Armed Forces).

<doc id="635308" wikidata="Q473221" url="?curid=635308" title="Mark L. Polansky">
<text>Mark Lewis &quot;Roman&quot; Polansky (born June 2, 1956, in Paterson, New Jersey) is an American aerospace engineer and research pilot and a former NASA astronaut. Polansky received the nickname &quot;Roman&quot; as a joke, because he shares a last name with director Roman Polanski. He flew on three Space Shuttle missions: STS-98, STS-116, and STS-127 and was first person of Korean ancestry in space.

==Background==
Polansky&#x27;s father, Irving, was Jewish. His mother, Edith, is originally from Hawaii and is of Korean descent. Polansky was raised as a Jew, and honored his father&#x27;s heritage by taking a teddy bear from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum along for the ride on STS-116. He is married and has two kids — one daughter and one son.

==Education==
Polansky graduated from J. P. Stevens High School, Edison, New Jersey, in 1974, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering, and a Master of Science degree in aeronautics and astronautics, from Purdue University, both in 1978.

==Military career==
Polansky received an Air Force commission upon graduation from Purdue University in 1978. He earned his pilot wings in January 1980 at Vance AFB, Oklahoma. From 1980 to 1983, he was assigned to Langley AFB, Virginia, where he flew the F-15 aircraft. In 1983, Polansky transitioned to the F-5E aircraft and served as an Aggressor Pilot, where he trained tactical aircrews to defeat enemy aircraft tactics. He was assigned in this capacity to Clark Air Base, Republic of the Philippines, and Nellis AFB, Nevada, until he was selected to attend USAF Test Pilot School, Edwards AFB, California, in 1986. Upon graduation, he was assigned to Eglin AFB, Florida, where he conducted weapons and systems testing in the F-15, F-15E, and A-10 aircraft. Polansky left active duty in 1992 to pursue a career at NASA. He has logged over 5,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft.

===NASA career===
Polansky joined NASA in August 1992, as an aerospace engineer and research pilot. He was assigned to the Aircraft Operations Division of the Johnson Space Center. His primary responsibilities involved teaching the astronaut pilots Space Shuttle landing techniques in the Shuttle Trainer Aircraft and instructing astronaut pilots and mission specialists in the T-38 aircraft. Polansky also conducted flight testing of the NASA T-38 avionics upgrade aircraft.

Selected by NASA in April 1996, Polansky reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. Having completed two years of training and evaluation, he was initially assigned as a member of the Astronaut Support Personnel team at the Kennedy Space Center, supporting Space Shuttle launches and landings. He served as pilot on STS-98 (2001) and has logged over 309 hours in space. He was next assigned as a CAPCOM. Polansky was Chief of the CAPCOM Branch from April 2002 to December 2002. He served as Chief Instructor Astronaut from April 2003 to January 2004. He has also served as Chief of the Return to Flight and Orbiter Repair Branches. Polansky&#x27;s last shuttle flight as commander of Mission STS-127, an assembly flight to the International Space Station.

Polansky retired from the Astronaut Corps on June 30, 2012. &quot;Mark is a remarkably talented individual,&quot; said Peggy Whitson, Chief of the Astronaut Office. &quot;His skills as an aviator coupled with his engineering expertise were a valuable contribution to our team. We wish him well in his future endeavors.&quot;

==Spaceflights==

=== STS-98 Atlantis (February 9–20, 2001) ===

The STS-98 crew continued the task of building and enhancing the International Space Station by delivering the U.S. Destiny Laboratory Module. The Shuttle spent seven days docked to the station while Destiny was attached and three spacewalks were conducted to complete its assembly. The crew also relocated a docking port, and delivered supplies and equipment to the resident Expedition 1 crew. Mission duration was 12 days, 21 hours, 20 minutes.

=== STS-116 Discovery (December 9–22, 2006) ===

The seven-member crew on this 12-day mission continued construction of the ISS outpost by adding the P5 Truss Segment during the first of four spacewalks. The next two spacewalks rewired the station&#x27;s power system, preparing it to support the addition of European and Japanese science modules by future shuttle crews. The fourth spacewalk was added to allow the crew to coax and retract a stubborn solar panel to fold up accordion-style into its box. Discovery also delivered a new crew member and more than two tons of equipment and supplies to the station. Almost two tons of items no longer needed on the station returned to Earth with STS-116. Mission duration was 12 days, 20 hours and 45 minutes.

=== STS-127 Endeavour (July 15–31, 2009) ===

Polansky was the commander of the STS-127 mission, which launched aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour on July 15, 2009, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. During this 16-day mission, the seven-member crew installed the Japanese Exposed Facility onto the ISS, and perform five spacewalks. Polansky returned to Earth with his crew on July 31, 2009. Following fellow astronaut Michael J. Massimino&#x27;s lead, Mark began posting public updates and replies to Twitter on May 7, 2009, during his training for STS-127, and continued to do so throughout the mission.

==Organizations==
Member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.

==Awards and honors==
Distinguished Graduate of the USAF Test Pilot School (1987). Distinguished Graduate of USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training (1980). Recipient of the USAF Flying Training Award (1980). Awarded Air Force Meritorious Service Medal and Air Force Commendation Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters.

In his hometown of Edison, NJ, a park is named for him on Grove Ave., across the street from his alma mater of J. P. Stevens High School. Recently in June 2006 the township officials unveiled a sign for Mark Polansky Park while his friends and family were there with him for this presentation. He frequently returns to Edison for programs at the local library for the kids.

<text>CFYK-DT (channel 8) is a CBC Television station in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. It is the flagship station of the CBC North television service.

==History==
The station signed on in 1967 as the first television station in northern Canada, and the first station to be part of the CBC&#x27;s Frontier Coverage Package; satellite delivery of colour television began in 1973.

Prior to 2011, the station was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) as a &quot;radiocommunication distribution undertaking,&quot; meaning that for regulatory purposes it was not a true television station, but merely a transmitter that redistributed CBC North from satellite. The CRTC formally relicensed it as a full television station in February 2011.

CFYK-TV switched to digital broadcasting, flash cutting on VHF 8 (originally VHF 7) with a PSIP of 8.1 on August 1, 2012. However, the CBC was not obligated to convert or close down this station, as no part of the Northwest Territories is designated as a mandatory market for digital conversion.

==Transmitters==
CFYK had 9 analogue VHF television rebroadcasters in the Northwest Territories. Additionally, CFWH-TV in Whitehorse and CFFB-TV in Iqaluit, though operating as semi-satellites of CFYK with their own networks of rebroadcasters, were actually licensed as rebroadcasters of CFYK.

Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analogue transmitters on July 31, 2012. None of CBC or Radio-Canada&#x27;s rebroadcasters were converted to digital. The only known translators in Arctic Canada that are known to still be in service are owned and operated by local community groups or local governments. However, few residents actually lost access to CBC programming due to the extremely high penetration of cable and satellite, which is all but essential for acceptable television in much of the Arctic.

<text>(often stylized in all-caps as MAZDASPEED) was Mazda&#x27;s in-house performance division. The company was a grassroots racing team in Japan. Owned by Mazda Motor Corporation, they built production model vehicles, became involved in motorsports development, and offered performance parts and accessories. Mazda has phased out Mazdaspeed branding and has not offered a Mazdaspeed trim since the 2013 Mazdaspeed3.

==History==

Mazdaspeed began in 1967 as &quot;Mazda Sports Corner&quot;, an independent racing team and tuning operation run by Takayoshi Ohashi, who also ran Mazda&#x27;s Tokyo distributor. They competed in numerous events at home and abroad, and they were also competitive at the 24 Hours of Le Mans races in the early 1980s, with the 717, 727, and 737. Mazda brought the racing team to Hiroshima in 1983, where the name became Mazdaspeed. In 1991 Mazdaspeed&#x27;s 787B won at Le Mans a feat no other Japanese team managed until Toyota did in 2018. Mazdaspeed also prepared the Lantis &amp; Familia for the JTCC between 1994 and 1996.

Outside of racing, Mazdaspeed produced numerous factory approved performance products for the MX5 (NA/NB), RX7 FC/FD), 626/Capella, Familia/323/Lantis, MX3/Presso, MX6, AZ1, Carol. Most notable are the limited-production touring kits (A-Spec, B-Spec, C-Spec, etc). Each of these kits offered a different exterior appearance and different performance parts.

Mazda Motor Corporation assumed control of Mazdaspeed in 1999 as a tuning and performance parts operation within the company. It began offering performance-based versions of its vehicles to consumers in 2003.

==Consumer models==

In 2003, Mazda debuted its first consumer-offered Mazdaspeed vehicle model, the 2003 Mazdaspeed Protegé. It was only released to the North American market as a performance upgrade to the Protegé MP3 and offered more power — from the MP3&#x27;s to — by using a T25 Callaway-Garrett turbocharger and an intercooler. Some modifications included new front air dam and a new spoiler. The Japanese market Mazdaspeed Familia utilized a naturally aspirated FS-ZE 2.0L engine with higher compression and a revised camshafts to produce at 6800 rpm.

A year after, in 2004, another Mazdaspeed model was offered: the Mazdaspeed MX-5 Miata, initially released in the North American market, followed by the Australian and Japanese markets. It featured an IHI single-scroll turbocharger producing of boost to further increase power, from to and torque from to . Mazda soon realized that these high performance models could be successful outside of North America and would make the next vehicles available worldwide.

In 2006, the Mazdaspeed6 was released globally, featuring the most powerful piston engine ever produced by Mazda at with an all-wheel drive layout.

The Mazdaspeed3 was introduced for the 2007 model year — which, with and of torque — was the most powerful vehicle in its class.. In the fall of 2009, Mazda released the second generation 2010 Mazdaspeed3. The newly styled Mazdaspeed3 carried forward the MZR 2.3L DISI turbocharged engine again with at 5500 rpm and of torque at 3000 rpm with refreshed interior, sheet metal, and body kit.

==Race branding==
Mazda branded a selection of several racing series as the Mazdaspeed as well as a driver development ladder. This program, which began in 2005, was organized by Mazda and promoters offering presented season winners in a given series with an automatic ride in the next series on the ladder.

The sports car version, Road to (the Rolex) 24 (at Daytona), offered winners of the Global MX-5 Cup Spec Miata series a promotion to the Prototype Lites series, and the winner there was offered a ride in the Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge, with opportunities later on in the IMSA WeatherTech United Sports Car Championship.

The single-seater version, the Road to Indy, once offered drivers who won in any series a shootout where they could enter the US F2000 championship, advance to Pro Mazda, and then advance to Indy Lights, before earning a ride in the IndyCar Series. Mazda discontinued its participation of the Road To Indy ladder system in 2018 to focus on its IMSA sportscar prototype program and grassroots racing contingency program under the Global MX-5 Cup

<text>The Shephelah () or Shfela (), or the Judaean Foothills (), is a transitional region of soft-sloping rolling hills in south-central Israel stretching over between the Judaean Mountains and the Coastal Plain. The different use of the term &quot;Judean Plain&quot;, as either defining just the Coastal Plain segment stretching along the Judaean Mountains, or also including, or only referring to, the Shfela, often creates grave confusion.

Today the Shfela is largely rural with many farms, but the cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon, Rehovot, Beit Shemesh, and Kiryat Gat roughly surround it.

The Bible assigned land in the Shfela to the tribes of Judah and Dan.

==Biblical references==
The Shfela is mentioned many times in the Hebrew Bible. In the King James Version, its name tends to be translated as &#x27;vale&#x27; or &#x27;valley&#x27;. The Shfela was the site of many biblical battles. During the Bar Kokhba revolt, hollowed out hills were connected to form elaborate bunker systems for the combat with the Romans.

==Geography==
The Shfela is bordered to the northeast by the Samarian Hills and the north-south Afek Pass at Rosh HaAyin-Antipatris (near the east-west Ayalon Valley) and Rishon LeZion in the northwest, and in the south by the northern Negev (the area).

The Shfela consists of fertile rolling hills. Topographically, it represents the transition from the higher and more rugged Jerusalem and Hebron Mountains, whose foothills it forms, and the Coastal Plain. About 60 km (35 miles) long in north–south direction and only 13 km (8 miles) wide, it is subdivided into two parts: the western &quot;Low Shephelah&quot;, which starts at an altitude of ca. 150 metres above sea level and rises to no more than ca. 200 metres above the Coastal Plain, and the eastern &quot;High Shephelah&quot; rising to altitudes between 250 and 450 metres above sea level. In the upper part the valleys descending from the Judean Mountains are deeper, and they broaden once they reach the lower part where the riverbeds create larger spaces between the hills. Where they reach the Shfela, the rivers can flow over substantial distances along the border between the mountains and the hills, forming longitudinal valleys. Passage between the east–west and north–south valleys has dictated the communication routes throughout history.

In geological terms, the Shfela is a syncline, i.e. it formed as a basin whose rock layers were folded downwards, but is part of the wider south Judean anticlinorium-a regional formation characterised by upward folding. Typical to the Shfela are the Senonian-Eocene chalky formations. The soft Eocene chalk is known locally as &quot;kirton&quot;, which tends to build a harder upper calcrete crust (&quot;nari&quot;), so that in the past people quarried the &quot;kirton&quot; while leaving the &quot;nari&quot; layer in place as a ceiling. Apart from using the extracted rock, they also utilised the generated underground hollows for different purposes (refuge, burial, storage etc.).

One of the major characteristics is hills formed of marl-covered soft chalk, as opposed to the Judean Hills which are made of hard chalk and dolomite. The valleys and lower areas contain soil with a high sand content, as well as large tracts of fertile areas. Seasonal swamps can develop during the rainy season. The southern part is made up of loess, while north of Ashkelon consists of clay.

The Shfela has a temperate Mediterranean to semi-arid climate.

A series of east–west valleys cuts the Shfelah into districts. From north to south, they are: the Valley of Ayalon, Sorek Valley, Valley of Elah, Guvrin Valley, Valley of Lachish, and Valley of Adorayim. The biblical towns established there guarded settlements of the interior and took advantage of trade passing along this route. Ayalon was the primary access corridor to Jerusalem along the ascent of Horon.

Caves are a major feature of the southern part of the Shfela, many of them bell-shaped such as those in Beit Guvrin.

==History and archaeology==
Archaeological surveys in the Shephelah have found evidence of habitation during the Late Bronze period. During the early Iron Age, the population of what has been widely believed to be a Canaanite enclave between the rising centres of both coastal Philistia and the Israelite/Judahite highlands, went into decline, though a string of settlements survived on the eastern edge. In the Iron Age IIA–B, population growth resumed and by the 8th century BCE it was densely populated, not so much by natural growth but as a result of incoming settlers, beginning with the short-lived settlement at Khirbet Qeiyafa. The overall estimated numbers for inhabitants range from 50,000 to 100,000, over numerous sites such as Tel Lachish, Azekah, Tel Burna, Tel Zayit, Khirbet el-Qom, Tel Erani, Tel Harasim and Tel Nagila. This colonization, together with the inhabitants of the Canaanite enclave, identified with the highland Israelite/Judahite culture, and its expansion coincides with the decline of Philistia. During the decline and ultimate destruction of Judah by the Neo-Assyrian Empire and the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the region was taken over gradually by the Edomites and it became the core of what was known in Greek as Idumea. The Shephela flourished during the Hellenistic period, was strongly affected by the First Jewish–Roman War (66–70) and was largely depopulated of Jews as a result of the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136). It flourished again in the Byzantine period and was the scene of one of the major battles during the Muslim conquest of the Levant of the 7th century.

A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 932 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on STS-55 (April 26 to May 6, 1993), was the pilot on STS-71 (June 27 to July 7, 1995), and was the spacecraft commander on STS-84 (May 15–24, 1997) and STS-91 (June 2–12, 1998), the final scheduled Shuttle-Mir docking mission, concluding the joint U.S./Russian Phase I Program.

==Space flight experience==
STS-55 &quot;Columbia&quot; launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 26, 1993. Nearly 90 experiments were conducted during this German-sponsored Spacelab D-2 mission to investigate life sciences, materials sciences, physics, robotics, astronomy and the Earth and its atmosphere. STS-55 also flew the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX) making contact with students in 14 schools around the world. After 160 orbits of Earth in 240 flight hours, the 10-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 6, 1993.

STS-71 (June 27 to July 7, 1995) was the first Space Shuttle mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir, and involved an exchange of crews (seven-member crew at launch, eight-member crew on return). The &quot;Atlantis&quot; Space Shuttle was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station. It also carried a Spacehab module in the payload bay in which the crew performed various life sciences experiments and data collections. STS-71 &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Mission duration was 235 hours, 23 minutes.

STS-84 Atlantis (May 15–24, 1997) carried a seven-member international crew. This was NASA&#x27;s sixth Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. During the 9-day flight, the crew conducted a number of secondary experiments and transferred nearly 4 tons of supplies and experiment equipment between the Space Shuttle and the Mir station. STS-84 &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Mission duration was 221 hours and 20 minutes.

STS-91 &quot;Discovery&quot; (June 2–12, 1998) was the 9th and final Shuttle-Mir docking mission and marked the conclusion of the highly successful joint U.S./Russian Phase I Program. The crew, including a Russian cosmonaut, performed logistics and hardware resupply of the Mir during four docked days. They also conducted the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer experiment, which involved the first of its kind research of antimatter in space. Mission duration was 235 hours, 54 minutes.

<text>Inspector Gadget&#x27;s Field Trip (onscreen title: Field Trip Starring Inspector Gadget) is an American live-action/animated children&#x27;s television series that is a spin-off incarnation of Inspector Gadget, produced by DIC Productions, L.P. in 1996. The series originally aired on The History Channel as one of only two DIC shows produced for the channel (&quot;Gadget Boy&#x27;s Adventures in History&quot; was the other one and ran concurrently with &quot;Field Trip&quot;) in the United States.

==Concept==
The series was an educational travelogue program for children, in which the animated Gadget would show viewers the many different sites in famous places around the world via live-action-clips with historical facts. The theme song is slightly similar to the one in the &quot;Gadget Boy&quot; series; in fact, Gadget Boy himself made a cameo appearance in one episode.

Gadget was the only main character to appear in this series; others such as Penny, Brain, Chief Quimby (although mentioned by Gadget in some episodes), Capeman, Dr. Claw, M.A.D. Cat and the M.A.D. Agents were absent. Don Adams reprised the role of Gadget in this series.

==Broadcast==
A total of 26 episodes were aired from 1996 to 1998, where the show continued in reruns on The History Channel until 2000. In 2001, the show began airing reruns in syndication in order to fill respective station&#x27;s E/I guidelines, and later aired as part of the E/I DIC Kids Network syndicated block from September 2004 until 2006. Comedian Don Adams returns as the voice of Inspector Gadget (this would be his final appearance as that character; he was concurrently voicing the title character of &quot;Gadget Boy&quot;).

A Spanish-dubbed version aired on Univision&#x27;s &quot;Planeta U&quot; block on Saturday mornings as &quot;Los Viajes de Inspector Gadget&quot; from the block&#x27;s premiere from April 5, 2008 to May 29, 2010 when it was taken off the lineup. During the opening sequence, an image of the Temple of Saturn in the ancient forum in Rome, Italy, is presented with the label of &quot;Greece.&quot;

The show is currently available to stream on Paramount+ (formerly CBS All Access).

==Episode list==
==Home media==
In June 1996, DIC appointed Buena Vista Home Video as the home video distributor for the series. Buena Vista, through subsidiary Disney Educational Productions, released various VHS tapes of the series with two episodes on each, which were sold as educational products for places like schools. The company would re-release the series on DVD in 2007, with the episodes varying between each DVD.

Anchor Bay UK released two volumes in 2004 and 2006 for public usage, each containing four episodes. Avenue Entertainment would release two volumes in 2004; these contained two episodes each.

<text>Philippe Perrin (Colonel, French Air Force) (born January 6, 1963) is a French test pilot, engineer and former CNES and European Space Agency astronaut. He served as mission specialist on the STS-111 mission where he conducted three spacewalks attaching new hardware to the International Space Station and replacing a wrist joint on the Canadarm2.

==Background==
Perrin was born 6 January 1963, in Meknes, Morocco, but considers Avignon, Provence, to be his hometown. He entered the École polytechnique in 1982 and graduated in 1985. Perrin then received his Test Pilot Licence in 1993 from the École du personnel navigant d&#x27;essais et de réception (EPNER), the French Test Pilot School at Istres Air Force Base and received his Air Line Pilot Certificate in 1995.

==Military and flight career==
Prior to graduating from the École polytechnique, Perrin completed military duty in the French Navy, where he was trained in ship piloting and navigation, and spent six months at sea in the Indian Ocean. Following École polytechnique, he entered the French Air Force in 1985, was awarded his pilot&#x27;s wings in 1986, and was assigned to the 33rd Reconnaissance Wing at Strasbourg Air Force Base (1987–1991). He flew the Mirage F1CR and made detachments in Africa and Saudi Arabia.

Perrin has flown 26 combat missions and has logged over 2,500 flying hours in over 30 types (from jet fighters to Airbus).

Upon graduating from EPNER, the French Test Pilot School, he worked on a variety of test programs while assigned to the Bretigny Test Center. In 1992, he was temporarily detached to the French Space Agency (CNES) and sent to Star City, Russia, where he trained for two months. In 1993, he reported to the 2nd Air Defense Wing of Dijon Air Force Base as Senior Operations Officer (Operation Southern Watch). In 1995, he returned to the Bretigny Test Center, as Chief Pilot Deputy, in charge of the development of the Mirage 2000-5.

==CNES and ESA career==
In July 1996, CNES announced his selection as an astronaut candidate and assigned him to attend NASA’s Astronaut Candidate Training in Houston, Texas.

Perrin reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. Having completed two years of training and evaluation, he qualified for flight assignments as a mission specialist. Perrin was initially assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Spacecraft Systems/Operations Branch.

He served as a mission specialist on the STS-111 mission in 2002 and logged over 332 hours in space, including 19 hours and 31 minutes in three spacewalks, performed with Franklin Chang-Diaz.

After his flight, Perrin returned to France to work as support astronaut on the Automated Transfer Vehicle program. December 2002 he was transferred from CNES to the European Space Agency&#x27;s astronaut corps.

He did not fly in space with ESA and left the European Astronaut Corps in 2004. He is currently working as a test pilot for Airbus.

===Spaceflight experience===
STS-111 Endeavour (5–19 June 2002). The STS-111 mission delivered a new ISS resident crew and a Canadian-built mobile base for the orbiting outpost’s robotic arm. The crew also performed late-notice repair of the station’s robot arm by replacing one of the arm’s joints. It was the second Space Shuttle mission dedicated to delivering research equipment to the space platform. Perrin performed three EVAs (spacewalks) with Franklin Chang-Diaz. STS-111 also brought home the Expedition 4 crew from their -month stay aboard the station. Mission duration was 13 days, 20 hours and 35 minutes. Unacceptable weather conditions in Florida necessitated a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

==Awards and honors==
* Awarded his pilot’s wings &quot;first of his class&quot; in 1996
* French Air Force Award for Flight Safety (2) in 1989
* French Overseas Medal (Gulf War, 1991)
* French National Defense Medal (2)
* Officier, Légion d&#x27;Honneur

Perrin is the only French astronaut to have received the Légion d&#x27;Honneur before flying in space as he became &quot;chevalier&quot; due to his actions while he was a military pilot. He was then elevated to the &quot;officier&quot; class after his space mission.

<text>Echo is the tenth studio album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Released in April 1999, the album reached number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 aided by singles &quot;Free Girl Now&quot;, &quot;Swingin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Room at the Top&quot;, which hit numbers 5, 17 and 19 respectively on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock Tracks in 1999. The album was the band&#x27;s last collaboration with producer Rick Rubin, and was also the last to feature contributions from longtime bassist/vocalist Howie Epstein, who died of a heroin overdose in 2003. Despite still being a member of the band, Epstein is missing from the album&#x27;s cover photo because he failed to show up for the photo shoot, and Petty ordered it to commence without him. It also marks the first to feature longtime touring member Scott Thurston, as well as the first to credit drummer Steve Ferrone as an official member. &quot;Echo&quot; was certified Gold (500,000 copies sold) by the RIAA in July 1999, only three months after it was released. &quot;Echo&quot; is the only Heartbreakers&#x27; album to feature a lead vocal from another member of the band, namely lead guitarist Mike Campbell on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Fight&quot;.

&quot;Free Girl Now&quot; is also notable for being the second single by a major artist to be made available for free internet download in MP3 format by the artist. Petty&#x27;s marketing decision caused concern at Warner Bros., and the download was pulled after two days but propagated thanks to services such as Napster.

<text>CBUT-DT (channel 2) is a television station in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, serving as the West Coast flagship of CBC Television. It is part of a twinstick with Ici Radio-Canada Télé station CBUFT-DT (channel 26). The two stations share studios at the CBC Regional Broadcast Centre on Hamilton Street in downtown Vancouver; CBUT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Mount Seymour in the district municipality of North Vancouver.

==History==

The station first signed on the air on December 16, 1953; as such, CBUT is the first and oldest television station in Western Canada. The station&#x27;s original studio facilities were located inside a converted automotive dealership at 1200 West Georgia Street (on the intersection of Bute Street) in downtown Vancouver. However, CBUT was not the first television station to serve Vancouverites; KVOS-TV (channel 12, now a Univision affiliate), across the border in Bellingham, Washington, had signed on months earlier as a CBS affiliate. CBUT has broadcast exclusively in English for most of its existence, except for a period from 1964 to 1976 when French language programs from Télévision de Radio-Canada aired on weekend mornings; this secondary affiliation ended when CBUFT (channel 26) signed on in September 1976. CBUT was known mainly as &quot;Channel 2&quot; from its inception until 1976.

During the station&#x27;s early years until 1976, CBUT&#x27;s station IDs consisted of slides of local Vancouver landmarks with the CBUT logo (the number &quot;2&quot; in Clarendon Bold typeface, contained within a stylized television screen) overlaid, accompanied by the announcement &quot;This is CBUT, Channel 2 in Vancouver&quot;; the ID slide used at the end of local programs on CBUT featured a larger version of the station&#x27;s logo on a navy blue background, accompanied by the announcement &quot;This is CBC Television, Vancouver&quot;. Beginning with the introduction of CBC&#x27;s &quot;gem&quot; logo in December 1974, CBUT (unlike other CBC Television O&amp;Os, which continued using their own station IDs at the end of their local programs) began using the &quot;gem&quot; network ID at the end of all programming, both network-distributed and locally produced.
In 1975, the CBC consolidated its Vancouver radio and television operations into one building. Prior to this, the CBC&#x27;s Vancouver radio properties – CBU (690 AM), CBU-FM (105.7) and CBUF-FM (97.7) – had operated from a separate studio facility at 701 Hornby Street, within the basement of the Hotel Vancouver. Together, those stations formed the basis of the Regional Broadcast Centre at 700 Hamilton Street, a few blocks east of its previous radio and television facilities.
The station&#x27;s IDs were changed in 1976 when CBUT changed its on-air branding to &quot;CBC British Columbia&quot;, with the initial IDs featuring a totem pole superimposed over local landmarks, after which the totem pole zoomed out and turned into the letter &quot;T&quot; in the station brand.

In recent years, CBUT, as with all CBC-owned stations, has de-emphasized local programming in favour of national network programming distributed out of Toronto. As of 2002, the station only aired sporadic local non-news programming and dropped all use of local station identifications in favour of using only network IDs; in addition, due to budget cuts, the CBC integrated CBUT&#x27;s master control operations (as it did for all of its other owned-and-operated stations) into the master control facility at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in downtown Toronto. Recently, however, CBUT has increased its local programming with the introduction of a locally themed lifestyle program, &quot;Living Vancouver&quot; (which has since been cancelled), as well as the addition of several new local newscasts.

==Programming==
CBUT currently produces a number of programs for CBC Television. Portions of &quot;Marketplace&quot; are produced at CBUT, as were portions of the program &quot;Hemispheres&quot;, the now-cancelled national version of &quot;Canada Now&quot; and the late-night independent film program &quot;ZeD&quot;.

===Sports programming===
CBUT presents Vancouver Canucks hockey games when Canucks games are featured on CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; NHL package produced by Sportsnet, the regional TV and radio rightsholder for the Canucks. Additionally, CBUT presents the Winter and Summer Olympics as part of CBC&#x27;s rights deal with the International Olympic Committee.

===News operation===

CBUT-DT presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 90 minutes each weekday and 30 minutes each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among CBC Television&#x27;s stations (either owned-and-operated or affiliated), although it now has the lowest newscast output among the Vancouver–Victoria market&#x27;s television stations – its weekly news total is far behind CTV O&amp;O CIVT-DT (channel 32) (which airs 38 hours of newscasts each week) and Global O&amp;O CHAN-DT (channel 8) (which broadcasts 46 hours each week).

In years past, the supper hour newscast (which was a completely locally produced program until the introduction of the national &quot;Canada Now&quot;) was known as &quot;Hourglass&quot;, &quot;Newscentre&quot;, &quot;CBC Evening News&quot;, &quot;Broadcast One&quot; and &quot;CBC News: Vancouver&quot;. On February 19, 2007, CBUT restored an hour-long local newscast to its schedule with the debut of a local edition of &quot;CBC News at Six&quot; (which was later retitled &quot;CBC News: Vancouver&quot; in July of that year), which retained the &quot;Canada Now&quot; name and was originally anchored by former national &quot;Canada Now&quot; anchors Ian Hanomansing and Gloria Macarenko. In September 2009, the early evening newscast expanded to 90 minutes, with the addition of an hour-long block at 5 p.m. and the removal of the 6:30 p.m. half-hour of the program.

In April 2010, CBC Television entered into a news share agreement with CHEK, in which both stations share news story content and resources. Tony Parsons also joined the CBC to anchor both CBUT&#x27;s early evening news block and CHEK&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast, remaining with both stations until his retirement in 2013. In addition, CHEK formerly carried a simulcast of &quot;CBC News: Vancouver at 6&quot; and &quot;Vancouver at 11&quot; while CBUT also produced a weekend 6 p.m. newscast for that station. As of April 10, 2016, CHEK no longer carries CBUT&#x27;s newscasts; on October 5, 2015, CHEK replaced the 6 p.m. airing of &quot;CBC News: Vancouver&quot; (since renamed as &quot;CBC Vancouver News&quot;) with its own half-hour 6 p.m. newscast, hosted by former CTV and Global TV reporter Ben O&#x27;Hara-Byrne, while on April 10, 2016, CHEK dropped the 11 p.m. airing of &quot;CBC Vancouver News&quot; in favour of an encore presentation of the 10 p.m. CHEK newscast on weeknights and various programming on Sundays.

As of June 2013, weather segments seen on CBUT&#x27;s newscasts are broadcast in HD, while video from other studio and field cameras are transmitted in standard definition and are upconverted to a 16:9 widescreen format.

On July 30, 2014, CBUT announced that Andrew Chang would begin anchoring the early evening newscasts starting September 1, succeeding Gloria Macarenko, who announced on her last day of her newscasts that she would become host of CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Story from Here&quot;. However, Macarenko will remain host of &quot;Our Vancouver&quot; while producing interview segments during CBUT&#x27;s evening newscasts.

===Current on-air staff===
* Anita Bathe – anchor of &quot;CBC Vancouver News at 6&quot;
* Gloria Macarenko – host of &quot;On the Coast&quot; on CBC Radio One; &quot;Our Vancouver&quot; host; also special assignment reporter
* Angela Sterritt – investigative reporter

===Notable former on-air staff===
* Adrienne Arsenault – reporter (1993–1998)
* Andrew Chang – anchor (2014-2017)
* Gillian Findlay – reporter (1982–1985)
* Dawna Friesen – reporter
* Bill Good – anchor
* Ian Hanomansing – anchor/reporter (1988–2010)
* Claire Martin – meteorologist
* Tony Parsons – 5, 5:30 and 6 p.m. anchor (2010–2013)
* Jack Webster – reporter, &quot;Hourglass&quot;

==Technical information==

===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CBUT shut down its analogue signal, over VHF channel 2, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. The station&#x27;s digital signal was relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 58, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to post-transition channel 43, using virtual channel 2.

Post-transition, CBUT downconverted the high definition video resolution for its digital signal from 1080i to 720p.

===Spectrum repacking===
In April 2017, Industry Canada posted new channel assignments for stations as a result of spectrum repacking due to the U.S. 600 MHz spectrum auction. CBUT-DT moved to channel 35 on May 1, 2020. Channel 35 was previously occupied by KVOS-TV; that station moved to channel 14 in October 2019.

===Former rebroadcasters===

CBUT&#x27;s over 85 analogue rebroadcast transmitters were located on the Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island, the Okanagan, and areas not previously occupied by a private CBC affiliate.

Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analogue transmitters on July 31, 2012. None of CBC or Radio-Canada&#x27;s television rebroadcasters were converted to digital; CHAN-DT is the last major network station in Vancouver to operate rebroadcasters throughout the province.

==Out-of-market cable coverage==
In addition to its coverage in British Columbia, CBUT has a significant American audience in Washington state. The station&#x27;s signal is receivable over-the-air in the city of Bellingham. It is also available on cable to nearly one million Comcast subscribers in the Puget Sound region; Comcast&#x27;s Puget Sound system also began offering CBUT&#x27;s digital signal in high definition in July 2009. CBUT is also available in both standard and high definition in Western and Central Washington on Wave Broadband&#x27;s systems in Western Washington as well as Lake Chelan area systems.

<doc id="635335" wikidata="Q326190" url="?curid=635335" title="Dave Keon">
<text>David Michael Keon (born March 22, 1940) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. He played professionally from 1960 to 1982, including his first 15 seasons with the Toronto Maple Leafs where he won the Calder Memorial Trophy and four Stanley Cup Championships, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1986. Keon was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2010. On October 16, 2016, as part of the Toronto Maple Leafs centennial celebrations, Keon was named the greatest player in the team&#x27;s history. In 2017, Keon was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in NHL history. In 2018, Keon was awarded the Order of Sport, marking his induction into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==
===Junior hockey===
Keon played junior hockey in Toronto for the St. Michael&#x27;s Buzzers of the Ontario Hockey Association&#x27;s Metro Junior B league in 1956–57;
on December 20, 1956, he scored seven goals in one game. In February 1957, he was named to the league&#x27;s eastern all-star team and was picked by NHL scouts as the top prospect in the league. Keon was selected as the league&#x27;s rookie of the year, finishing second in scoring, and his team won the league championship. He played some games that season for the Junior A St. Michael&#x27;s Majors, and moved to that club full-time for the 1957–58 season. Keon played for St. Michael&#x27;s through the end of the 1960 season, when he turned professional and joined the Sudbury Wolves of the Eastern Professional Hockey League for four playoff games. They would be the only games he would ever play in the minor leagues.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
Keon joined the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League for the 1960–61 season, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s top rookie with 20 goals and 45 points in his first season. It was his first of six consecutive 20-goal seasons. In his second year in the NHL, Keon was named to the second All-Star team and won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the most gentlemanly player, taking only one minor penalty through the entire season. He repeated as Lady Byng winner in 1962–63, again taking only a single minor penalty all year.

He was the Leafs&#x27; leading scorer in the 1963–64, 1966–67 and 1969–70 seasons, and the team&#x27;s top goal-scorer in 1970–71 and 1972–73. Keon was considered one of the fastest skaters in the NHL, and one of the best defensive forwards of his era. He would usually play against the opposing team&#x27;s top centre, and developed a reputation for neutralizing some of the league&#x27;s top scorers. In 1970–71, he scored eight shorthanded goals, setting an NHL record for most shorthanded goals scored in a single season, which would later be broken by Marcel Dionne in 1974–75, with 10 shorthanded goals (Dionne&#x27;s record would be broken by Wayne Gretzky in 1983–84 with 12 shorthanded goals. In turn, Gretzky&#x27;s record would be broken by Mario Lemieux in 1988–89, when Lemieux scored 13 shorthanded goals in a season).

Keon won four Stanley Cups with the Leafs, playing on the Cup-winning teams of 1961–62, 1962–63, 1963–64 and 1966–67. In the 1967 Cup Final, he shut down Jean Béliveau, the star centreman of the Montreal Canadiens, in the last two games of the series and was voted the most valuable player of the playoffs, winning the Conn Smythe Trophy. Keon&#x27;s eight points are the fewest ever by a non-goalie Conn Smythe winner, and he remains the only Leaf to have won the trophy named for the former owner of the club.

He was named team captain on October 31, 1969, succeeding George Armstrong who was said to be retiring from hockey. Armstrong returned to the Leafs two weeks later and played for another two seasons, but Keon remained captain and would wear the &quot;C&quot; through the rest of his years with the Leafs.

Keon hoped to make Team Canada for the 1972 Summit Series, but was coming off one of the worst years of his career, finishing the 1971–72 season with his lowest points-per-game average since his rookie year. The final pick for Team Canada came down between Keon and Bobby Clarke. It is believed that Clarke was selected because he had more points.

While Keon was not selected for Team Canada, the Ottawa Nationals of the World Hockey Association made a strong effort to sign Keon, whom they had placed on their negotiation list earlier that year. Harold Ballard, who had become the Leafs&#x27; majority owner in March 1972, said that Keon did not provide the leadership the team needed during the previous season and was refusing to give Keon a big salary increase after a poor year. Keon signed a letter of intent with the Nationals and received a $50,000 cheque from the team, but the deal fell apart just before training camp. Keon signed a three-year deal with the Leafs, and rebounded strongly in 1972–73, scoring 37 goals. On November 22, 1972, he scored his 297th goal as a Leaf, passing Armstrong and Frank Mahovlich to become the team&#x27;s all-time leading goal scorer.

Early into the 1974–75 season, Ballard publicly blasted Keon, saying that the team was not getting good leadership from its captain and vowing never again to agree to a no-trade clause in a contract, as he had with Keon. When Keon&#x27;s contract expired at the end of the season, Ballard made it clear that there was no place for him on the Leafs. The Leafs believed they had some strong young prospects at centre who needed more ice time, and Keon was again asking for a contract with a no-trade clause. The 35-year-old Keon was told he could make his own deal with another NHL team, but any club signing him would have been required to provide compensation to the Leafs. Ballard set the compensation price so high that other teams shied away from signing him, even though the Leafs had no intention of keeping him. In effect, Ballard had blocked Keon from going to another NHL team.

===WHA===
In August 1975, with the Leafs still controlling his NHL rights, Keon reluctantly jumped to the World Hockey Association, signing a deal with the Minnesota Fighting Saints reportedly worth $300,000 over two seasons. Keon chose to play for the Saints after they agreed to a no-trade clause, and also because head coach Harry Neale was an old friend of Keon&#x27;s. The team, and Keon, played well, but the team struggled badly financially due in large part to being in direct competition with the NHL&#x27;s Minnesota North Stars. With 21 games left in the season, the team folded. Keon refused to waive his no-trade clause since he had always planned to return to the NHL once his stint with the Saints was over. He was thus not included in the dispersal sale of Saints players to other WHA teams. The New York Islanders expressed a strong interest in signing Keon, but they needed to negotiate a deal for his NHL rights with the Leafs. Again, the Leafs&#x27; asking price (said to have been a first-round draft pick) was too high, and a disappointed Keon signed with the WHA&#x27;s Indianapolis Racers in March 1976.

The Fighting Saints were revived for the start of the WHA&#x27;s 1976–77 season, and Keon agreed to a trade back to Minnesota. However, the team folded for good in January 1977 (with Keon as its leading scorer). Keon&#x27;s WHA rights were briefly claimed by the Edmonton Oilers, but they immediately agreed to trade him to the New England Whalers. The move re-united Keon with Neale, who had taken over the Whalers after the original Fighting Saints&#x27; demise.

===Return to NHL===
He would remain with the Whalers through the rest of his career. In the 1977–78 season, Keon was joined on the Whalers by Gordie Howe who, at age 50, was the team&#x27;s leading scorer that season. Keon returned to the NHL in 1979 when the renamed Hartford Whalers became one of four WHA teams to join the NHL. The merger agreement allowed existing NHL teams to reclaim most of the WHA players whose NHL rights they held. Nevertheless, even though Keon was not protected from reclamation by the Whalers in the reclamation draft, the Maple Leafs declined to reclaim their former captain, allowing him to remain in Hartford. Bobby Hull joined the Whalers that season, with Keon, Howe, and Hull sometimes playing as a forward line. Howe and Hull retired at the end of the season. Terry Harper&#x27;s retirement in 1981 left Keon as the oldest active player in the NHL. Keon played two more seasons with the Whalers and announced his retirement on June 30, 1982, at age 42. Keon was the last active player who played a full season in the Original Six era.

==Retirement==
Following his retirement from hockey, Keon moved to Florida and worked in real estate for several years.

Bitter over his treatment by Ballard and the Leafs, Keon refused for many years to have any relationship with the Leafs organization, even after Ballard&#x27;s death and after the club changed ownership several times. Other Leaf players who clashed with Ballard&#x27;s management did reconcile, most notably Keon&#x27;s successor as club captain, Darryl Sittler, who accepted an invitation from GM Cliff Fletcher to return as a consultant after the team came under the ownership of Steve Stavro.

Keon turned down several offers of reconciliation from the team, including an invitation to the closing ceremony for Maple Leaf Gardens in 1999 and a proposed ceremony to honour his number.

On March 22, 1991, with the Leafs under new management after Ballard&#x27;s death, Keon played on a team of Leaf all-stars against their counterparts from the Montreal Canadiens in an old-timers game at Maple Leaf Gardens called &quot;Legends&#x27; Night in Canada&quot;. &quot;After that, I figured out the new ownership was no different than Ballard, and I had no use for it,&quot; Keon later said. In 2005, he told the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; that the new owners (majority equity owned by the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan, chaired by Larry Tanenbaum) &quot;would like to say they are different, but they are all the same.&quot;

In January 2007, the Toronto Maple Leafs announced that Keon would attend a pre-game ceremony to honour its 1967 Stanley Cup-winning team. Keon was one of several members of the 1967 team to appear on-ice at the Air Canada Centre before the Leafs&#x27; game on February 17, 2007 — the 80th anniversary of the first game played by the Toronto franchise after being renamed the Maple Leafs in 1927. Keon was introduced to the crowd second last, just before 1967 captain George Armstrong, and received a long-standing ovation. On February 16, 2013, Keon was a part of a pre-game ceremony honouring the 1963 Stanley Cup-winning Leafs team. He similarly appeared on February 8, 2014, with other members of the 1964 Cup winners.

His granddaughter, Kaitlyn Keon, played on the Brown Bears women&#x27;s ice hockey program from 2011 to 2015, accumulating 34 points.

On January 21, 2016, it was announced that Keon, along with former Maple Leafs Turk Broda and Tim Horton, would be commemorated with a statue on Legends Row in front of the Air Canada Centre, joining former Maple Leafs greats Syl Apps, Teeder Kennedy, Johnny Bower, George Armstrong, Darryl Sittler, Borje Salming, and Mats Sundin.

On October 14, 2016, the Toronto Maple Leafs released their list of the top 100 Leafs of all time. Based on the votes of fans and a 31-member expert panel, Keon was voted the greatest Toronto Maple Leaf.

On October 15, 2016, the Maple Leafs retired Dave Keon&#x27;s number 14 at a ceremony honouring the Maple Leafs&#x27; centenary.

<doc id="635340" wikidata="Q1164077" url="?curid=635340" title="Strategic Hamlet Program">
<text>The Strategic Hamlet Program (SHP; ) was implemented in 1962 by the government of South Vietnam, with advice and financing from the United States, during the Vietnam War to combat the communist insurgency. The strategy was to isolate the rural population from contact with and influence by the National Liberation Front (NLF), more commonly known as the Viet Cong. The Strategic Hamlet Program, along with its predecessor, the Rural Community Development Program, attempted to create new communities of &quot;protected hamlets&quot;. The rural peasants would be provided protection, economic support, and aid by the government, thereby strengthening ties with the South Vietnamese government (GVN) which was hoped would lead to increased loyalty by the peasantry towards the government.

Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, a communist sleeper agent of North Vietnam who had infiltrated the South Vietnamese army, was made overseer of the Strategic Hamlet Program and had hamlets built in areas with a strong NLF presence and forced the program forward at an unsustainable speed, causing the production of poorly equipped and poorly defended villages and the growth of rural resentment towards the government.

The Strategic Hamlet Program was unsuccessful, failing to stop the insurgency or gain support for the government from rural Vietnamese, it alienated many and helped contribute to the growth in influence of the NLF. After President Ngo Dinh Diem was overthrown in a coup in November 1963, the program was cancelled. Peasants moved back into their old homes or sought refuge from the war in the cities. The failure of the Strategic Hamlet and other counterinsurgency and pacification programs were causes that led the United States to decide to intervene in South Vietnam with air strikes and ground troops.

==Background and precursor program==
In 1952, during the First Indochina War (19 December 1946 – 1 August 1954) French commander François de Linares, in Tonkin began the construction of &quot;protected villages,&quot; which the French later named agrovilles. By constructing quasi-urban amenities, the French designed the agrovilles to attract peasants away from their villages. This policy was known as &quot;pacification by prosperity.&quot; In addition to offering social and economic benefits, the French also encouraged villagers to develop their own militias, which the French trained and armed. &quot;Pacification by Prosperity&quot; had some success, but it was never decisive, because the settlers felt insecure, a feeling which the numerous French guard posts along the perimeter could do little to dispel so long as the Việt Minh operated at night, anonymously, and intimidated or gained the support of village authorities.

Between 1952 and 1954, French officials transplanted approximately 3 million Vietnamese into &quot;agrovilles&quot;, but the project was costly. To help offset the cost, the French relied partially on American financial support, which was &quot;one of the earliest objects of American aid to France after the outbreak of the Korean War.&quot; According to a private Vietnamese source, the U.S. spent about &quot;200,000 dollars on the &#x27;show&#x27; &quot;agroville&quot; at Dong Quan.&quot; After visiting the villages of Khoi Loc in Quảng Yên Province and Đông Quan in Ha Dong Province, noted Vietnam War correspondent Bernard Fall stated that, &quot;the French strategic hamlets resembled British [Malayan] prototypes line for line.&quot; However, in contrast to the British, the French were reluctant to grant Vietnam its independence, or allow the Vietnamese a voice in government affairs; therefore, the agroville program had little effect.

The First Indochina War terminated and the 1954 Geneva Conference partitioned Vietnam into communist (north) and non-communist (south) parts and the terms North Vietnam and South Vietnam became the common usage.

Beginning in 1954, Việt Minh sympathizers in the South were subject to escalating suppression by the Diem government, but by December 1960 the National Liberation Front of Southern Vietnam had been formed and soon rapidly achieved de facto control over large sections of the South Vietnamese countryside. At the time, it is believed that there were approximately 10,000 Communist insurgents throughout South Vietnam.

In February 1959, recognizing the danger that the guerrillas posed if they had the support of the peasants, President Diem and his brother, Ngô Đình Nhu, made a first attempt at resettlement. A plan was put forth to develop &quot;centers of agglomeration&quot;. Through force and/or incentives, peasants in rural communities were separated and relocated. The primary goal of the centers was to concentrate the villagers, so they were not able to provide aid, comfort, and information to the Viet Cong.

The Government of Vietnam (GVN) developed two types of centers of agglomeration.
:The first type, qui khu, relocated Viet Cong (VC) families, people with relatives in North Vietnam, or people who had been associated with the Viet Minh into new villages; thus, providing easier government surveillance.

The second type of relocation center, qui ap, relocated into new villages those families that supported the South Vietnamese government but lived outside the realm of government protection and were susceptible to Viet Cong attacks. 
By 1960, there were twenty-three of these centers, each consisting of many thousands of people.

This mass resettlement created a strong backlash from peasants and forced the central government to rethink its strategy. A report put out by the Caravelle group, consisting of eighteen signers, leaders of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo sects, the Dai Viet, and dissenting Catholic groups described the situation as follows:

Tens of thousands of people are being mobilized… to take up a life in collectivity, to construct beautiful but useless agrovilles which tire the people, lose their affection, increase their resentment and most of all give an additional terrain for propaganda to the enemy.

== Ideological origins ==
Truman&#x27;s Point Four Program in 1949 aimed to integrate &#x27;third world&#x27; countries—i.e., those not aligned with NATO nor the Soviets—into the capitalist liberal economy to win &#x27;hearts and minds.&#x27; The U.S. believed that by developing the &#x27;third world&#x27; through education, sanitation, and reforming their economic and political systems, it could bring countries ‘out of the phase where rural revolutionary forces could come to power’ and create a path towards democracy. This was a similar to the stance that the U.S. took towards colonising the Philippines.

After the failure of the Truman and Eisenhower administration, Kennedy enacted a ‘flexible response’ program, which would increase the spectrum of military responses available to the U.S. to fight counterinsurgency. This response aimed to pre-empt the conditions which lead to guerrilla warfare and ultimately local support for communist nationalism: poverty, disease and hunger. The Strategic Hamlet Program was one such example of Kennedy&#x27;s &#x27;flexible response&#x27; initiative. The strategy was guided by an integrated model of social, economic and political change, in which the intensification of the war would lead to a transformation in Vietnamese society. It was hoped that an awareness of the material benefits of capitalism would catalyse the development of a new set of modern values and loyalties.

The Strategic Hamlet Program was also closely tied to modernisation theory promoted by W.W. Rostow, underpinning US Foreign Policy during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. &quot;Kennedy, his advisers, and the American foreign aid mission began to shift away from conventional military tactics and toward a comprehensive counterinsurgency program that integrated military action with a strategy of social engineering. By the end of 1961, the administration would become committed to defeating the Vietcong through modernisation&quot;. The Program was designed to strike at the heart of the Revolution’s political and social roots. US policymakers believed that, if Diem’s regime became the focus of popular aspirations, “nation-building and political development might stem the tide.” W.W. Rostow believed that responses to Communist warfare would have to harness the modernisation process that the insurgents sought to exploit. Thus, efforts at containment “needed to accelerate social progress” – it was anticipated that, if momentum could take hold in undeveloped areas, and social problems could be solved, the chances of insurgents seizing power would dramatically decline. Hence the promotion of modernization was regarded as means by which to “shut the narrow window of opportunity on which aggressors depended”.

In utilising the practice of modernisation, the US expressed a confidence on a global scale that it should be a “universal model for the world”. This approach &quot;contributed directly to justifying the militaristic approach to third world politics, above all in Vietnam”.

The concept of modernisation relied on the belief that all societies, including Vietnam, passed along a linear trajectory from &#x27;traditional&#x27; and economically unsophisticated, to &#x27;modern&#x27; and able to harness nature through industrialisation, technology, and literacy rates.

The practice of village relocation within the Strategic Hamlet Program, holds foundations in Rostow’s modernisation theory which recommended “destroying the external supports to guerrilla insurgents”. Relocation aimed to reduce the connections between the Vietcong and the Southern Vietnamese population, aiming to deter communist influence. “Modernizers aimed to replicateby force if necessarythe stable, democratic, capitalist welfare state that they believed was being created in the United States”.

The Strategic Hamlet Program also reflected wider ideas of American Exceptionalism. In their approach towards Vietnam, the US saw itself as a moderniser and an exemplary form of democracy. “The Strategic Hamlet Program projected a national identity for the US as a credible world power ready to meet revolutionary changes”. Perceptions of Vietnamese as &quot;backwards&quot; and subordinate to &quot;Western Progress&quot; resulted in the conclusion by US analysts that the Vietnamese were “incapable of self-government and vulnerable to foreign subversion&quot;.

The US media and government spokesmen presented the Strategic Hamlet Program and its projects of village relocation and social engineering as “reflections of benevolent American power”. In challenging communism against the backdrop of the Cold War, the Strategic Hamlet Program “revised older ideologies of imperialism and manifest destiny” stemming from notions of American Exceptionalism.

In aiming to deter the Vietnamese peoples from Communist and Vietcong influence, the US retained the “sense of national mission projected by an ideology of modernisation”. The US government aimed to defeat the threat of Communism in Vietnam to maintain its exceptionalist vision of “America&#x27;s superior society and its transformative potential”. The adoption of modernisation theory “reflected a sense that the United States should be a universal model”.

The Program also had roots in Vietnamese policymaking. Diem&#x27;s government had its own views of how to deal with the related issues of counter-insurgency and nation building, modern ideas which presented an alternative to the political agenda of both his regime&#x27;s US ally and his Communist opponent. The Strategic Hamlet Program was, arguably, the clearest embodiment of these ideas. Although strategic hamlets aimed to separate the Communist-led guerrillas from the peasantry by regrouping and fortifying thousands of rural settlements, they were not merely a device to defeat the armed insurgency. Ngo Dinh Diem also saw them as a way of mobilizing the population politically and generating support for his regime; they were the centre-piece of the government&#x27;s plans to modernize the RVN and simultaneously free it from dependence on the United States.

Ngo Dinh Diem made efforts to limit foreign involvement in the hamlet programme, particularly as the United States put a great deal of pressure on the regime in 1961 to accept US policy prescriptions for defeating the insurgents. Such demands further solidified notions within the Diem regime that its ally was overbearing and meddlesome; indeed, US pressure encouraged the Ngos to see the hamlet programme as a way to free South Vietnam from dependence on the United States for economic and military aid, as well as a way to satisfy their other political goals. Whilst the United States eventually supported the hamlet scheme, most US officials were &#x27;somewhat bewildered by the sudden appearance of a major activity that had not been processed through their complex co-ordinating staffs&#x27;.

== Stages of the Strategic Hamlet Program ==
According to Thompson&#x27;s memories, the Strategic Hamlet Program would be split into three stages: Clearing, holding and winning.

In the ‘clearing’ stage, areas for settlements were located which were usually next to an already secured area. These areas were then ‘saturated’ with police and military forces to either repel the insurgents or force them to depart to neighbouring territories, which could then also be ‘cleared’ for more settlements.

In the ‘holding’ stage, the government officials suggested that this would ‘restore government authority in the area and establish a firm security network.’ This was achieved by ensuring that military troops and police did not merely leave the hamlet once it had been cleared, so insurgents would not return at a late date.

The ‘winning’ stage involved the construction of schools, irrigation systems, new canals and road repairs to give the impression that the U.S. government was working for the people’s benefit in a ‘permanent capacity’. They also believed that educating the population into the modern world would counter communism, which many young men and women found appealing due to its ability to find ‘stable elements in their already unstable societies’. This was confirmed by W.W. Rostow on his trip to Saigon in October 1961, where he found that many young men were joining the Viet Cong in the hope of fitting into the modern world. But this survey was only conducted on a small sample size.

The stages of the program were designed to ultimately prevent communist re-infiltration.

However, this ‘clear and hold’ strategy came under some criticism from the U.S. Military Advisory Group who preferred the ‘search and destroy’ operations. This was due to the fact they had already trained the South Vietnamese to fight a conventional war which embraced counterinsurgency, so they preferred the fighting tactics used in Korea and World War One.

==Implementation==

In late 1961, President Kennedy sent Roger Hilsman, then director of the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, to assess the situation in Vietnam. There Hilsman met Sir Robert Thompson, head of the British Advisory Mission to South Vietnam (BRIAM). Thompson was a veteran of the Malayan counter-insurgency effort and a counter-insurgency advisor to the Diem government. Thompson shared his revised system of resettlement and population security, a system he had proposed to Diem that would eventually become the Strategic Hamlet Program. Thompson&#x27;s proposal, adopted by Diem, advocated a priority on winning control of the South Vietnamese rural population rather than killing insurgents. The police and local security forces would play an important role coupled with anti-insurgent sweeps by the South Vietnamese army (ARVN).

After his meetings with Thompson, on 2 February 1962 Hilsman described his concepts of a Strategic Hamlet Program in a policy document entitled &quot;A Strategic Concept for South Vietnam&quot;, which President Kennedy read and endorsed. Hilsman proposed heavily fortified strategic hamlets. &quot;Each strategic village will be protected by a ditch and a fence of barbed wire. It will include one or more observation towers...the area immediately around the village will be cleared for fields of fire and the area approaching the clearing, including the ditch, will be strewn with booby-traps...and other personal obstacles. The Strategic Hamlet Program &quot;aimed to condense South Vietnam’s roughly 16 000 hamlets (each estimated to have a population of slightly less than 1000) into about 12000 strategic hamlets”.

Hilsman proposed that each strategic hamlet be protected by a self-defense group of 75 to 100 armed men. The self-defense group would, in addition to defending the hamlet, be responsible for &quot;enforcing curfews, checking identity cards, and ferreting out hard-core Communists.&quot; The objective was to separate, physically and politically, the Viet Cong guerrillas and supporters from the rural population.

The first step in the establishment of a strategic hamlet would be a census carried out by the South Vietnamese government. Next, villagers would be required to build fortifications and the members of the self-defense force identified and trained. The villagers would be registered and be given identity cards, and their movements would be monitored. Outside the fortifications would be a free-fire zone.

The South Vietnamese government on its part would provide assistance to the strategic hamlet and build an &quot;essential socio-political base&quot; that would break old habits and orient the residents toward identification with the country of South Vietnam.

President Diem in an April 1962 speech outlined his hopes for the Program:
... strategic hamlets represented the basic elements in the war undertaken by our people against our three enemies: communism, discord, and underdevelopment. In this concept they also represent foundation of the Vietnamese society where values are reassessed according to the personalist revolution where social, cultural, and economic reform will improve the living conditions of the large working class down to the remotest village.

The U.S. military commander in Vietnam, General Lionel C. McGarr, was initially skeptical of the Strategic Hamlet Program, especially because it emphasized police and local security forces rather than military action against insurgents. The U.S. military also objected to the proposed focus of the program on the most populated areas of South Vietnam; the U.S. wished to focus on areas where communist influence was greatest. After compromises were made to secure U.S. agreement, the Strategic Hamlet Program began implementation in March 1962.

== Life in the Strategic Hamlet ==
As George Kahin suggests, life in the strategic hamlets was about more than fighting communism, it underpinned ‘a deeper globalisation problem within Cold War politics’; imperialism.

In the hamlets, the peasants were subjected to social control including constant surveillance from troops and watchtowers, identification cards needing to be carried by peasants at all times, and permission being needed to travel beyond the confines of the hamlet.

From the 1950s onwards, Non-government organisations (NGOs), or Civic action groups like the Peace Corps, were called into Vietnam, including in the hamlets, to help build infrastructure like dams and public roads. Kennedy believed that the provision of livestock, cooking oil and fertiliser alongside the establishment of local elections and community projects would give peasants a ‘stake in the war’.

A key strategy for hamlet residents was the U.S. &#x27;self-help&#x27; projects. These projects would increase the connections between officials and the peasantry to create loyalty to Diem’s regime. According to Hilsman, giving the hamlet people a ‘choice’ on which projects would most benefit their hamlet community would earn ‘an enormous political gain’ to counter the NLF’s portrayal of the U.S. as an imperial power. But, as former USOM official stated, whilst the projects undertaken were supposed to be decided by the hamlet people in local meetings, it was often the case that high-profile officials working within the hamlets decided on such projects. There was 62 projects made in 1964, with expansions expected in 1965, but as Latham suggests, ‘U.S. policies ignored the contradiction between the promotion of freedom and the construction of forced labour camps.’

Building schools and educating the peasants were also encouraged in the hamlets as the U.S. felt that education would instil new political values which would create a new cultural perspective for the Vietnamese population. This links to American interventionism, which suggested that intervening in foreign relations would preserve American values and maintain Western security.

Hence non-state actors played a role in the programs&#x27; implementation. Aid workers from the United States Operations Mission oversaw hamlet school construction and teacher-training programs. IVS education volunteers provided grassroots-level assistance to Vietnamese instructors and served as teachers in the strategic hamlets. As Elkind writes, the volunteers primary mission in the hamlets was to inspire a “desire for education” among the local population. They strove to accomplish this goal through “the mental conditioning of villagers to accept change and development.” Elkind also wrote that the volunteers’ had a disregard for the negative consequences of the program in the people forced to move to the hamlets and that this ultimately contributed to a widespread belief among the Vietnamese people that neither the South Vietnamese government nor its American supporters had their best interests in mind. Elkind wrote that their vision of helping Vietnam’s people was incompatible with the counterinsurgency goals of the strategic hamlet program.

==Operation Sunrise==
Operation Sunrise began on 19 March 1962 in Bình Dương Province, bordering the city of Saigon on the North. The province was heavily influenced by the Viet Cong, especially in the Iron Triangle, a Viet Cong stronghold. The selection of Binh Duong was contrary to Thompson&#x27;s advice to choose a more secure area for the initial phase of the Strategic Hamlet Program. The United States Agency for International Development provided $21 per family to compensate farmers for their loss of property when forced to move into a strategic hamlet. Of the first 210 families relocated, 140 were reported to have been moved at gunpoint. South Vietnamese soldiers burned their former villages. By May, South Vietnam&#x27;s government-owned newspaper reported that only 7 percent of 38,000 rural dwellers in the target area had been relocated either voluntarily or by force.

==Problems==
Although many people in both the U.S. government and government of South Vietnam (GVN) agreed that the Strategic Hamlet Program was strong in theory, its actual implementation was deficient on several grounds. Roger Hilsman himself later claimed that the GVN&#x27;s execution of program constituted a &quot;total misunderstanding of what the [Strategic Hamlet] program should try to do.&quot;

The speed of the implementation of the Program was one of the main causes for its eventual failure. The Pentagon Papers reported that in September 1962, 4.3 million people were housed in 3,225 completed hamlets with more than two thousand still under construction. By July 1963, over eight and a half million people had been settled in 7,205 hamlets according to figures given by the Vietnam Press. In less than a year, both the number of completed hamlets and its population had doubled. Given this rapid rate of construction, the GVN was unable to fully support or protect the hamlets or its residents, despite funding by the United States government. Viet Cong insurgents easily sabotaged and overran the poorly defended communities, gaining access to the South Vietnamese peasants. Only twenty percent of the hamlets in the Mekong Delta area were controlled by the GVN by the end of 1963. In an interview, a resident of a hamlet in Vinh-Long described the situation: &quot;It is dangerous in my village because the civil guard from the district headquarters cross the river to the village only in the daytime…leaving the village unprotected at night. The village people have no protection from the Viet Cong so they will not inform on them to the authorities.&quot;

Alongside the execution and intimidation of hamlet officials, the Viet Cong opposition to the Strategic Hamlet program included a fierce propaganda campaign, which portrayed U.S. strategy in Vietnam as imperialism. When Robert Thompson sent Filipino field operatives into local hamlet settlements, they reported that South Vietnamese peasants accepted Viet Cong propaganda as they believed that ‘America had replaced France as a colonial power in Vietnam’.

The U.S. officials tried to counter Viet Cong propaganda with their own, which included hiring Asian operatives in provinces, particularly Filipino. In theory, this would convince the South Vietnamese of the purpose of American assistance through their shared ethnicity, or ‘indigenous nationalism.’ This became known as the ‘demonstration effect’ as Filipinos were deemed a prime example of a country which had been ‘modelled on the enlightenment and benevolence of American tutelage.’

Another propaganda technique was using the forced relocations to inform South Vietnamese peasants that if they supported the North, then they would allow them to return home once the communist revolution had been won.

The Viet Cong also escalated their recruitment program by using women. This was not only through presenting women as victims by drawing on Vietnamese atrocities such as the rape of women, but Northern officials believed that women were the ideal political and psychological weapon for infiltration within the Strategic Hamlets. Their usefulness as operatives was underpinned by the fact that Northern officials thought that the U.S. government would not suspect women of being Communist allies. Although the U.S. also attempted to mobilise women, namely the Women’s Solidarity Movement, which Thompson believed could be trained alongside the Republican Youth Movement to protect the hamlets if they needed, this was unsuccessful. Not only were the members upper class and educated women, therefore not representative of the Vietnamese peasant population, but the founder; Madame Nhu, eventually instructed the Movement to oppose U.S. intervention strategies.

There are several other important problems that the GVN faced in addition to those created by the failure to provide basic social needs for the peasants and over-extension of its resources. One of these was wide public opposition to the Program stemming partly from the inability of the committee to choose safe and agriculturally sound locations for the hamlets. However, according to the Pentagon Papers, the most important source of failure was the inflexible nature of the ruling Ngo family.

In 1962, Ngô Đình Nhu, President Diem&#x27;s brother, headed the Strategic Hamlet Program, attempting to build fortified villages that would provide security for rural Vietnamese. The objective was to lock the Viet Cong out so that they could not operate among the villagers. Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo supervised these efforts, and when told that the peasants resented being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and put into forts they were compelled to build, he advised Nhu it was imperative to build as many hamlets as fast as possible. The Ngôs were unaware Thảo, ostensibly a Catholic, was in fact a communist double agent acting to turn the rural populace against Saigon. Thảo helped to ruin Nhu&#x27;s scheme by having strategic hamlets built in communist strongholds. This increased the number of communist sympathizers who were placed inside the hamlets and given identification cards. As a result, the Viet Cong were able to more effectively penetrate the villages to access supplies and personnel.

===Forced relocation===

In the best case scenario, restructuring peasant villages to create a defensible perimeter would require the forced relocation of some of the peasants on the outskirts of the existing villages. To ease the burden, those forced to move were supposed to be financially compensated, but they were not always paid by the GVN forces. Sometimes relocated villagers had their old homes burnt. This occurred during Operation Sunrise. Some relocated people also had to build new homes with their own labor and at their own expense. There was also the compulsory labor the South Vietnamese government forced on relocated peasants, leading Noam Chomsky to compare the hamlets to &quot;virtual concentration camps.&quot;

President Diem and his brother Nhu, who oversaw the program, decidedcontrary to Hilsman&#x27;s and Thompson&#x27;s theorythat in most cases they would relocate entire villages rather than simply restructuring them. This decision led to large-scale forced relocation that was deeply unpopular among the peasantry. The mostly-Buddhist peasantry practiced ancestor worship, an important part of their religion that was disrupted by being forced out of their villages and away from their ancestors&#x27; graves and their ancestral homes. Some who resisted resettlement were summarily executed by GVN forces.

===Corruption===

Promised compensation for resettled peasants was not always forthcoming and instead found its way in the pockets of South Vietnamese government officials. Peasants were promised wages for their labor building the new villages and fortifications; some corrupt officials kept the money for themselves. Wealthier peasants sometimes bribed their way out of working on construction, leaving more labor for the poorer peasants. Although the U.S. provided materials like sheet metal and barbed wire, corrupt officials sometimes forced the locals to buy the materials intended to provide them with protection.

===Security shortcomings===

Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of the Strategic Hamlet Program was its failure to provide the basic security envisioned by its proponents. This failure was partly due to poor placement of the hamlets. Ignoring the &quot;oil-blot&quot; principle (establish first in secure areas, then spread out), the South Vietnamese government began building strategic hamlets as quickly as possible and seemingly without considering &quot;geographical priorities,&quot; according to a U.S. official. The randomly placed hamlets were isolated, not mutually supporting, and tempting targets for the Vietcong.

Each hamlet was given a radio with which to call for South Vietnamese army ARVN support, but in fact ARVN forces were unreliable in responding to calls for help, especially when attacks occurred after nightfall. The villagers were also given weapons and training, but were only expected to hold out until conventional reinforcements arrived. Once it became clear that ARVN could not be relied upon, many villagers proved unwilling to fight even small Vietcong detachments, which could then capture the villagers&#x27; weapons. &quot;Why should we die for weapons?&quot; asked one Vietnamese peasant.

==Failure==

Despite the Diem government&#x27;s attempt to put a positive spin on the Strategic Hamlet Program, by mid-1963 it was clear to many that the program was failing. American military advisors such as John Paul Vann criticized the program in their official reports. They also expressed concerns to reporters who began to investigate more closely. David Halberstam&#x27;s coverage of the Strategic Hamlet Program&#x27;s shortcomings caught the eye of President Kennedy.

The Strategic Hamlet Program was exposed as an almost complete failure in the aftermath of the November 1, 1963 coup that left Diem and his brother Nhu murdered. US officials discovered, for example, that only 20% of the 8600 hamlets that the Diem regime had reported &quot;Complete&quot; met the minimum American standards of security and readiness. The situation had passed the point of possible recovery. The program officially ended in 1964.

On the ground in Vietnam, the demise of the program was visible. By the end of 1963, empty hamlets lined country roads, stripped of valuable metal by the Vietcong and the fleeing peasants. According to Neil Sheehan, &quot;The rows of roofless houses looked like villages of play huts that children had erected and then whimsically abandoned.&quot;

In his book &quot;Vietnam: a History&quot; (Viking,1983) Stanley Karnow describes his observations: 
:In the last week of November . . I drove south from Saigon into Long An, a province in the Mekong Delta, the rice basket of South Vietnam where 40 per cent of the population lived. 
:There I found the strategic hamlet program begun during the Diem regime in shambles. 
:At a place called Hoa Phu, the strategic hamlet built during the previous summer now looked like it had been hit by a hurricane. The barbed wire fence around the enclosure had been ripped apart, the watchtowers were demolished and only a few of its original thousand residents remained, sheltered in lean-tos... A local guard explained to me that a handful of Vietcong agents had entered the hamlet one night and told the peasants to tear it down and return to their native villages. The peasants complied... 
:From the start, in Hoa Phu and elsewhere, they had hated the strategic hamlets, many of which they had been forced to construct by corrupt officials who had pocketed a percentage of the money allocated for the projects. Besides, there were virtually no government troops in the sector to keep them from leaving. If the war was a battle for &quot;hearts and minds,&quot;...the United States and its South Vietnamese clients had certainly lost Long An. 
:My cursory impression, I later discovered, was confirmed in a more extensive survey conducted by Earl Young, the senior U. S. representative in the province. He reported in early December that three quarters of the two hundred strategic hamlets in Long An had been destroyed since the summer, either by the Vietcong or by their own occupants, or by a combination of both.

Years later Roger Hilsman stated his belief that the strategic hamlet concept was executed so poorly by the Diem regime and the GVN &quot;that it was useless.&quot;

<text>CBXT-DT (channel 5) is a CBC Television station in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It is part of a twinstick with Ici Radio-Canada Télé station CBXFT-DT (channel 11). The two stations share studios at the Edmonton City Centre (across from Churchill Square) in Downtown Edmonton; CBXT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located on Wye Road in Sherwood Park.

== History ==
The station first went on the air on October 1, 1961, as Edmonton&#x27;s second television station; the previous CBC affiliate, CFRN (channel 3), switched to the newly established CTV on the same day. Initially, it was branded as &quot;CBXT 5&quot;, or &quot;Channel 5&quot;. After being known as &quot;Edmonton/5&quot; in the late 1970s, it became known as &quot;XTV&quot; in 1980. It reverted to the &quot;Edmonton 5&quot; brand in the mid-1980s and then, on January 1, 1986, became &quot;CBC Television Edmonton&quot;. Its local newscasts were originally known as &quot;Metro&quot;.

When CBXT signed on, it was the first television station in Canada to use television cameras that could be remotely controlled from a control room, and did not need constant adjustment. In 2004, the CBC&#x27;s Edmonton operations moved into a new digital broadcast facility downtown, bringing all operations of radio and television, under one roof. The old television facility on 75th Street was , while the radio building on 51st Avenue was . The new combined facility at the Edmonton City Centre totals . At the same time, master control was consolidated with those of CBRT in Calgary into a single facility based at the CBC Studios in Calgary.

When Red Deer&#x27;s CKRD disaffiliated from CBC Television in 2005 (switching to E!, reverting to its original calls CHCA-TV), CBXT was given control of the transmitter in Coronation, Alberta (CKRD-1) on channel 10. CBXT added a transmitter on channel 22 in Red Deer, broadcasting the full CBXT/CBC schedule to Red Deer and Central Alberta.

== News operation ==
CBXT airs 12 hours of local news programming; in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the lowest local newscast output out of any English-language television station in the Edmonton market.

&quot;CBC Edmonton News&quot; is broadcast live at 6 and 11 p.m. on weekdays from its studios at Edmonton City Centre Mall. Hourly 1-minute summaries at :59 past the hour are also produced by CBC Edmonton, and are broadcast in the afternoons and evenings.

In addition, the station produces a weekend provincial newscast for both CBC stations in Calgary and Edmonton. &quot;CBC Alberta News&quot; airs at 11:30 p.m. or following &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; on Saturdays, and at 11 p.m. on Sundays.

The 11 p.m. edition of &quot;CBC Edmonton News&quot;, and the Saturday and Sunday editions of &quot;CBC Alberta News&quot; are simulcast on CBC North. Forecasts for Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon Territory are included in the weather segments.

CBXT also simulcasts &quot;Edmonton AM&quot; from CBX weekday mornings from 6–7 a.m. The radio program is presented with an enhanced news/weather/traffic ticker alongside live shots of its radio studio.

A weekly current affairs program, &quot;Our Edmonton&quot; also airs on weekend mornings.

As of May 22, 2017, CBXT began broadcasting all live TV news programming originating from its Edmonton studios using a control room in Toronto. The technical change has enabled the station to produce its local news in high-definition, the fourth and final station in Edmonton to do so.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
On April 1, 2011, CBXT began broadcasting its digital signal on UHF channel 42. On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts, the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on UHF channel 42, using virtual channel 5.1. On March 20, 2021, CBXT-DT changed its frequency to channel 25.

=== Transmitters ===
CBXT had nearly 30 rebroadcasters in certain Central and Northern Albertan communities. Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining transmitters on July 31, 2012. None of CBC or Radio-Canada&#x27;s television rebroadcasters were converted to digital, leaving those areas dependent on cable television to receive CBC Television programming.

<doc id="635343" wikidata="Q1385274" url="?curid=635343" title="Ronald Parise">
<text>Ronald Anthony Parise (May 24, 1951 – May 9, 2008) was an Italian American scientist who flew aboard two NASA Space Shuttle missions as a payload specialist.

Parise was born in Warren, Ohio, to Henry and Catherine Parise (nee Pasha). His father was born in Carovilli. By age 11, he became a licensed amateur radio operator. In his teens, he developed an interest in astronomy and aviation and became a pilot. He attended Western Reserve High School, graduating in 1969 before attending Youngstown State University. In 1973, he obtained a bachelor of science degree in physics, with minors in mathematics, astronomy, and geology. He went on to receive a master&#x27;s degree in 1977 and a doctorate in 1979 from the University of Florida, both in astronomy. He and his wife Cecelia Sokol Parise had two children.

Parise died from a brain tumor on May 9, 2008, at the age of 56.

==Career==
Upon graduation in 1979, Parise accepted a position at Operations Research Inc. (ORI) where he was involved in developing avionics requirements definitions and performing failure mode analyses for several NASA missions. In 1980 he began work at Computer Sciences Corporation in the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) operations center as a data management scientist and in 1981 became the section manager of the IUE hardcopy facility.

In 1981 he began work on the development of a new Spacelab experiment called the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT). His responsibilities involved flight hardware and software development, electronic system design, and mission planning activities for the UIT project. In 1984 he was selected by NASA as a payload specialist in support of the newly formed Astro mission series. During his twelve years as a payload specialist he was involved in mission planning, simulator development, integration and test activities, flight procedure development, and scientific data analysis, in addition to his flight crew responsibilities for the Astro program. At the completion of the Astro program, Parise assumed an advanced planning and communications engineering support role for a variety of human space flight projects including Mir, International Space Station (ISS), and the X-38.

Parise engaged in a number of astronomical research projects utilizing data from ground-based observatories, the Copernicus satellite (OAO-3), IUE, and the Astro observatory. His research topics, including circumstellar matter in binary star systems and the evolutionary status of stars in globular clusters, resulted in several professional publications. A veteran of two space flights, Parise logged more than 614 hours and 10.6 million miles in space. He served as a payload specialist aboard STS-35 in 1990 and STS-67 in 1995. At the end of his career, Parise supported the Goddard Space Flight Center, Networks and Mission Services Project, in the area of advanced communications planning for human spaceflight missions. He was also involved with projects in the Advanced Architectures and Automation Branch that developed the use of standard Internet Protocols (IP) in space data transmission applications.

== Spaceflight experience ==
STS-35/Astro-1 &quot;Columbia&quot; (December 2–December 10, 1990). The Astro observatory is a unique complement of three telescopes designed to simultaneously record spectral data, polarimetric data and imagery of faint astronomical objects in the far ultraviolet. The mission duration was 215 hours and 5 minutes. The Shuttle landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

STS-67/Astro-2 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (March 2–18, 1995). This was the second flight of the Astro observatory. During this record-setting 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. The mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes. The landing was at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

Coincidentally, Parise&#x27;s fellow payload specialist on both his missions was Sam Durrance.

Parise was instrumental in bringing amateur radio equipment to the Shuttle and operated on the air during his own missions. His amateur radio call sign was WA4SIR.

<doc id="635348" wikidata="Q684307" url="?curid=635348" title="Metropolitan Borough of Wigan">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Wigan is a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, England. It is named after its largest town, Wigan, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Atherton, Ashton-in-Makerfield, Golborne, Hindley, Ince-in-Makerfield, Leigh and Tyldesley. The borough also covers the villages and suburbs of Abram, Aspull, Astley, Bryn, Hindley Green, Lowton, Mosley Common, Orrell, Pemberton, Shevington, Standish, Winstanley and Worsley Mesnes. The borough is also the second-most populous district in Greater Manchester.

The borough was formed in 1974, replacing several former local government districts. It is the westernmost part of Greater Manchester and is bordered by the Greater Manchester boroughs of City of Salford and Bolton to the east, the Cheshire borough of Warrington to the south, the Merseyside borough of St Helens to the south west, and the Lancashire boroughs of West Lancashire to the west and Chorley to the north.

==History==
Wigan metropolitan borough was created on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972. It was formed from the former county borough of Wigan along with other local government units from the administrative county of Lancashire. These were the Municipal Borough of Leigh, the urban districts of Abram, Aspull, Atherton, Hindley, Ince-in-Makerfield, Orrell, Standish and Tyldesley. Ashton-in-Makerfield except for the parish of Seneley Green, the Golborne Urban District except for the parish of Culcheth and Glazebury in Warrington, the Higher End part of Billinge and Winstanley Urban District and the civil parishes of Haigh, Shevington and Worthington from the Wigan Rural District were included.

Before its creation, the name &quot;Wigan-Leigh&quot; was used in the Redcliffe-Maud Report. It was also suggested that the new metropolitan borough be named &quot;Makerfield&quot;. However, both names were rejected by a vote of 12 to 2. According to an opinion poll in 2003, 26% of 299 residents surveyed felt they belonged &quot;very strongly&quot; or &quot;fairly strongly&quot; (4% very strongly) to Greater Manchester, 64% (28% very strongly) to the borough of Wigan, and 63% (31% very strongly) to Lancashire.

The metropolitan borough was created from a highly industrialised area of Lancashire that was part of the Lancashire Coalfield and had an important textile industry.

==Geography==
Wigan borough covers an area of , and is the 9th-largest metropolitan borough (out of 36) in England. The borough is the most northwestern in Greater Manchester. Within Greater Manchester, it borders the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton to the north-east and east, and the City of Salford to the east. Outwith Greater Manchester, in the south it borders Warrington (a unitary authority in Cheshire); to the south-west it borders the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens in Merseyside. To the west, it borders the West Lancashire borough, and to the north it borders the Chorley borough, both in Lancashire.

Wigan borough has seven Local Nature Reserves: including Wigan Flashes LNR, Borsdane Wood LNR, between Hindley and Aspull, Greenslate Water Meadows LNR within Orrell Water Park in Orrell, Low Hall LNR between Hindley and Platt Bridge, Pennington Flash LNR, Kirkless LNR at Ince and Three Sisters LNR, Ashton-In-Makerfield.

==Governance==

===Local government===
For 12 years from the creation of Greater Manchester in 1974, the borough had a two-tier system of local government, and Wigan Council shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council. The county council was abolished in 1986 by the Local Government Act 1985. Since April 2011, some of the borough&#x27;s responsibilities have been pooled with neighbouring authorities and subsumed into the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which covers ten boroughs including Wigan.

The first elections to the borough council were held on 10 May 1973. The Metropolitan Borough Council is divided into 25 wards, each of which elects three councillors. Elections are by thirds, with one councillor from each ward up for re-election in each election year. The borough council has a leader and cabinet system. The current leader is David Molyneux who took over from Peter Smith, who resigned in May 2018, having been leader since 1991. The council rejected the idea of a directly elected mayor following a consultation in 2001.

The Metropolitan Borough of Wigan is traditionally a Labour Party stronghold - the council has been Labour-controlled since its creation. The local elections in 1998 resulted in a council with only two non-Labour members.

Labour had a majority with 43 seats at the 2006 election. The second-largest party was the local Community Action Party which had 15 seats. Community Action first contested Wigan elections in 2002, and won 18 seats in the 2004 election following the re-warding - their councilors are for wards in the middle of the borough, between Wigan and Leigh. The Conservative Party had nine seats, and the Liberal Democrats eight.

At the 2008 elections Labour was the largest party with 41 seats out of a total of 75; the Conservative Party had 14 seats, Community Action Party eight seats, Independent seven seats, Liberal Democrats four seats, and one was vacant.

In November 2010 (after elections in May), Labour was the largest party with 51 seats out of a total of 75; the Conservative Party had eight seats, Independents seven seats, Community Action Party four seats, Liberal Democrats three seats (one member currently suspended) and two members were &#x27;Independent Conservative&#x27;.

As of June 2011 (after May elections), Labour continued to be the largest party with 58 seats out of 75, the Independent Councillor group with 8 seats form the official opposition, the Conservative Party had 5 seats, the Liberal Democrats hold 2 seats, Community Action Party 1 seat and 1 Independent councillor.

In May 2012 (post 2012 Local Elections) the composition of the council was Labour 63 (+5), Others 9 (-1), Liberal Democrats 2 (No change) and Conservatives 1 ( -4).

Presently in May 2018, the Council&#x27;s political composition is: Labour 60, Conservatives 7, Independent 4, Independent Network 2, Shevington Independents 1, and Standish Independents 1.

The council uses Wigan Town Hall as its main headquarters. Leigh Town Hall is used as a secondary base.

===Localities and wards===

The borough is divided into 25 electoral wards, each of which elect three councillors. The present wards were adopted in 2023, following a review by the Boundary Commission, the previous review took place in 2003. Prior to 2003 the borough was divided in 24 wards. From the 2003 Boundary Review until the 2020s, Wigan Council divided the borough into ten areas by the name of townships, each with a Township Manager (council liaison) and a regularly scheduled Township Forum meeting. However with Austerity cuts This has been replaced with an ad hoc community consultation structure without regularly scheduled community forums or permanent council liaisons consisting of 16 communities or &#x27;Places&#x27; divided into 3 unnamed &#x27;Localities&#x27;, the Locality at the centre of the Borough consists of Ashton, Bryn, Abram, Platt Bridge, Hindley and Hindley Green with all areas to the northwest forming a locality centred on Wigan and all areas to the southwest forming one centred on Leigh. However two Town Centre Managers were appointed in Wigan and Leigh primarily to act as liaisons between the Council and local business.

===Civil &amp; ecclesiastical parishes===
The borough has three civil parishes: Haigh, Shevington and Worthington. The rest of the borough is an unparished area. Church of England ecclesiastical parishes in the west of the borough are part of the Diocese of Liverpool, those in the east of the Metropolitan Borough are part of the Diocese of Manchester and the northern section part of the Diocese of Blackburn.

===Parliamentary===
The Wigan Metropolitan Borough is currently covered by four parliamentary constituencies, Wigan, Makerfield, Leigh, and Bolton West. (Atherton is the only Wigan ward included in Bolton West, with the rest of the constituency made up of wards from Bolton Borough). New constituency boundaries recommended by the Boundary Commission for the 2010 general election saw the link to Salford broken by the removal of Wigan areas from the Worsley constituency. This resulted in the Worsley constituency wards of Tyldesley and Astley-Mosley Common being placed in the Leigh Constituency with the Atherton ward becoming part of Bolton West. Makerfield is the only constituency to have returned Labour MPs continuously since 1906.

===Coat of arms===

Wigan council&#x27;s new coat of arms is based on various elements from the arms of the councils of its predecessor districts.

==Demography==

With a population of around 300,000, Wigan is the second most populous borough of Greater Manchester, after Manchester. It has one of the lowest ethnic minority populations, with the 2001 census reporting 98.7% of the population as white. Unemployment is around the average for England and Wales. Approximately 9.5% of the population was recorded as being permanently sick or disabled compared to a national average of 5.5%.

===Population change===
The table details the population change since 1801, including the percentage change since the last available census data. Although the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan has existed since 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and civil parishes that became constituent parts of the borough.
The population of the borough has remained roughly static from the 1970s through to the start of the millennium at around 300,000 but has risen over 10% since reaching an estimated 339,174 in mid 2023, it is the second most populous borough within Greater Manchester after Manchester itself.

The ONS identify the Wigan Built-up Area as the western part of the district, as well as Skelmersdale and Upholland in West Lancashire, with a population of 175,485 in 2011. 

It considers towns in the east of the borough, Hindley, Leigh, Golborne, Atherton and Tyldesley to be part of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area.

Aspull and Shevington are identified as standalone urban areas and Ashton-in-Makerfield is considered to be part of the Liverpool Built-up area, sitting at the border with St Helen’s. The entirety of the Wigan borough forms part of the Manchester Larger Urban Zone

=== Ethnicity ===


==Transport==
Public transport in Wigan MBC is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM). 

The borough is served by an extensive bus network with most services operated by Stagecoach Manchester, Arriva North West First Greater Manchester and Diamond North West. There are two major bus stations in both Wigan and Leigh town centres. Services operate from the bus stations to Bolton, Manchester, the Trafford Centre, St Helens and Chorley, as well as local inter-urban routes, with three high frequency services between Wigan and Leigh bus stations, operated by Stagecoach Manchester. Leigh, Atherton and Tyldesley are also served by the high frequency Vantage services, via a guided busway, connecting the towns to Central Manchester in 30-40 minutes outside of peaks. 

Several railway lines cross the borough. Wigan Wallgate railway station is served by Northern trains on the Manchester to Southport and Kirkby lines. There are services to stations towards Manchester, serving all city centre stations including Manchester Victoria and Manchester Piccadilly via two routes: one through Bolton and one via Atherton, with connections to other local and national destinations.

<text>CBRT-DT (channel 9) is a CBC Television station in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The station&#x27;s studios are located in the Cambrian Wellness Centre, in the University Heights neighbourhood, and its transmitter is located near Old Banff Coach Road/Highway 563 and 85 Street on the city&#x27;s southwest side.

==History==
CBRT first signed on the air at 6 p.m. on September 1, 1975. Before then, CBC programming had aired on private affiliate CFAC-TV (channel 2, now CICT), making Calgary the largest market in Canada without a CBC owned-and-operated station of its own. The station initially branded as &quot;CBC 9&quot; or &quot;CBC Calgary&quot;, later branding as &quot;CBRT&quot;, then returning to &quot;CBC 9&quot; by 1982. CBRT was one of the first, if not the first, to use the network/channel number branding in North America that has become commonplace in the United States since the mid-1990s.

Up until 2008, CBRT&#x27;s Calgary studios were used by the 24-hour news channel CBC Newsworld as a production centre for programs including &quot;Newsworld Today&quot;, &quot;Your Call&quot;, and a Newsworld edition of &quot;Canada Now&quot;.

In January 2016, the CBC announced that its Calgary operations would move from their long-time home on Westmount Boulevard to a new, smaller facility at the Cambrian Wellness Centre near Foothills Hospital. The CBC cited the age of the facility, and its opinion that it was too large for its current operation, as justification for the re-location. The move was completed in October 2017.

==News programming==
As of October 5, 2015, CBRT airs over 11 hours a week of local news programming. On weekdays, &quot;CBC Calgary News&quot; broadcasts six 1-minute news updates at :59 past the hour from 2 to 10 p.m. A thirty-minute evening news magazine airs at 6 p.m., and a late evening newscast is shown at 11 p.m., following &quot;The National&quot;. On weekends, &quot;CBC Alberta News&quot;, originating from CBC Edmonton (CBXT), is broadcast on Saturday evenings after &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, and at 11 p.m. on Sunday evenings. However, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;CBC Alberta News&quot; has been put on hiatus and replaced with entertainment programming on Saturday evenings, and a rebroadcast of &quot;The National&quot; on Sunday nights.

CBRT also simulcasts CBC Radio One&#x27;s local morning news and current affairs program, &quot;The Calgary Eyeopener&quot;, from 6 to 7 a.m. weekdays.

The station also produces &quot;Our Calgary&quot;, a thirty-minute weekly local current affairs program on Saturdays at 10 a.m. and repeated on Sundays at 1 p.m..

CBC Calgary&#x27;s first supper-hour newscast on CBRT was named &quot;Evening Eye-Opener&quot; and later, &quot;The CBC Evening News&quot;. The original late-night news was called &quot;Night Final&quot;. In 1991, the CBC cancelled the local newscast on CBRT due to corporate budget cuts and began producing a provincial newscast, &quot;CBC Alberta News&quot;, co-produced and presented from Calgary and CBXT-DT in Edmonton. Following a sharp drop in ratings, localized newscasts from Calgary were restored in 1997.

The local supper-hour programs were cut to 30 minutes in length in 2000 with the launch of a national and international news program, &quot;Canada Now&quot; from Vancouver. Seven years later, the sole Calgary newscast returned to its hour-long format under the umbrella title of &quot;CBC News at Six&quot;.

===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
On April 1, 2011, CBRT began broadcasting its digital signal on channel 21. On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on UHF channel 21, using virtual channel 9.1.

===Transmitters===
CBRT operated 16 analog television rebroadcasters in certain Southern Alberta communities such as Lethbridge. Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analog transmitters on July 31, 2012.

CBRT-6 in Lethbridge, a mandatory market, was required to go digital or be taken off the air by the transition deadline of August 31, 2011. CBC had originally decided that none of its rebroadcasters will transition to digital. On August 16, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted the CBC permission to continue operating 22 repeaters in mandatory markets, including CBRT-6, in analog until August 31, 2012, at which point the transmitters had to be converted to digital or shut down.

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Bolton ( ) is a metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, named after its largest town, Bolton, but covering a larger area which includes Blackrod, Farnworth, Horwich, Kearsley, 
Westhoughton, and part of the West Pennine Moors. It had a population of in , making it the third-most populous district in Greater Manchester.

The borough is in the historic county of Lancashire, and was created in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of seven former local government districts and part of an eighth; being seven urban districts from the administrative county of Lancashire, and the County Borough of Bolton. The metropolitan districts of Bury, Salford and Wigan lie to the east, south and west respectively; and the unitary authority of Blackburn with Darwen and the non-metropolitan district of Chorley in Lancashire to the north and north-west.

==History==
Bolton Metropolitan Borough was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the combined areas of seven former local government districts and part of an eighth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Blackrod Urban District
*Bolton County Borough
*Farnworth Municipal Borough
*Horwich Urban District
*Kearsley Urban District
*Little Lever Urban District
*Turton Urban District (southern part; remainder became parish of North Turton in Blackburn district.)
*Westhoughton Urban District
As a county borough, the old borough of Bolton had been administratively independent from any county council, but was deemed part of Lancashire for ceremonial purposes. The other seven districts had all been part of the administrative county of Lancashire prior to 1974, with Lancashire County Council serving as their upper tier authority. When the metropolitan borough of Bolton was created in 1974 it was transferred to the new metropolitan county of Greater Manchester, with Greater Manchester Council providing county-level services. The Greater Manchester Council was abolished in 1986, after which Bolton became a unitary authority, providing all local government services.

Bolton Council unsuccessfully petitioned Elizabeth II for the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton to be granted city status in 1992 (the Queen&#x27;s 40th year as monarch), in 2000 (for the Millennium celebrations), in 2002 (Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee), and 2012 (Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee).

==Parishes==
Horwich, Westhoughton and Blackrod are now constituted as civil parishes, each having a town council: Westhoughton Town Council, Horwich Town Council and Blackrod Town Council. The rest of the metropolitan borough, covering the town of Bolton itself, Farnworth, Kearsley, Little Lever, and South Turton, have remained unparished areas since 1974.

==Demographics==

<text>James Anthony &quot;Jim&quot; Pawelczyk (born September 20, 1960) is an American physiology and kinesiology researcher who flew aboard the NASA STS-90 Space Shuttle mission as a payload specialist.

==Family background==
Pawelczyk was born in Buffalo, New York, although he considers Elma, New York, a suburb of Buffalo, as his hometown. He has two children. His hobbies include cycling, swimming, woodworking, philately, and outdoor activities. Pawelczyk is the first American astronaut of full-blooded Polish descent to go into space. (Polish Cosmonaut Mirosław Hermaszewski was the first Pole in space in 1978 when he flew aboard a Soyuz 30 spacecraft as part of a Soviet bloc program &#x27;Interkosmos&#x27;.) In 1999, Pawelczyk and three other astronauts from the STS-90 crew were guests of State of the Republic of Poland. He presented the president with the Polish flag that flew with him aboard space shuttle, Columbia. His parents, Joe and Rita, along with representatives of the Polish American Congress from Buffalo and Chicago accompanied the crew on their visit. He has two children.

==Education==
Pawelczyk graduated from Iroquois Central High School, Elma, New York, in 1978. He went on to earn a BA degree in biology and a BA degree in psychology from the University of Rochester, New York, in 1982. Subsequently, he obtained a MS degree in physiology in 1985, and a PhD degree in biology (physiology) from the University of North Texas in 1989.

==Academic career==

He conducted a post-doctoral fellowship in cardiovascular neurophysiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center between 1989 and 1992. Pawelczyk was also a visiting scientist at the Department of Anaesthesia of the Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1990. Next, he became an assistant professor of medicine (cardiology) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center from 1992 to 1995. Between 1992 and 1995, he was director of the Autonomic and Exercise Physiology Laboratories at the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine of the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas; in 1995, he was assistant professor of bioengineering at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; since 1995, Pawelczyk is an associate professor of physiology and kinesiology at Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania. Pawelczyk took leave from Penn State University to fly as a payload specialist on STS-90 (Neurolab).

Pawelczyk is co-editor of &quot;Blood Loss and Shock&quot;, published in 1994. He has been a principal investigator or co-investigator on 11 federal and state grants and contracts, and has over 20 refereed journal articles and 3 invited book chapters in the areas of cardiovascular regulation and cardiovascular physiology.

==NASA career==
User design group, GASMAP (Gas Analysis System for Metabolic Analysis Physiology); Unit principal investigator for the NASA Specialized Center for Outreach, Research and Training (NSCORT) grant in integrative physiology. He received a NASA Young Investigator Award in 1994 for his work in the area of autonomic neurophysiology. Pawelczyk was a co-investigator for experiments flown on the Neurolab mission, and two Shuttle-Mir (Phase 1B) flights. Pawelczyk served as a payload specialist on STS-90 Neurolab (April 17 to May 3, 1998). During the 16-day Spacelab flight the seven person crew aboard Space Shuttle Columbia served as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. The STS-90 flight orbited the Earth 256 times, covered 6.3 million miles, and logged over 381 hours in space. Pawelczyk testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science &amp; Transportation in 2003. His testimony advocated strengthening research on board the International Space Station. He is a standing member of NASA&#x27;s Life Sciences Advisory Subcommittee, and served as a member of the Research Maximization and Prioritization (ReMAP) Taskforce in 2002.

==Honors and awards==
Research Scientist, United States Olympic Swimming Trials, 1984; Pre-doctoral training award, National Institutes of Health, 1988–1989; Research award, Texas Chapter of the American College of Sports Medicine, 1988; Post-doctoral training award, National Institutes of Health, 1989–1992; Young Investigator Award, Life Sciences Project Division, NASA Office of Life and Microgravity Science Applications, 1994, NASA Space Flight Medal (1998).

<text>Obertauern is a tourist destination which is located in the Radstädter Tauern in the Salzburger Land of Austria. The winter sports resort is separated in two communities: Tweng and Untertauern.

==Geography==

Obertauern lies in the southeast of the state of Salzburg in the Radstädter Tauern mountains at heights of between 1,630 and 2,526 metres above sea level. The village is near to the highest point of the Radstädter Tauern Pass over which the Katschberg road (&quot;Katschberger Straße&quot;, the B 99) runs. Obertauern belongs to two districts: St. Johann/Pongau and Tamsweg, hence why the community is separated into the two municipalities of Untertauern (Pongau) and Tweng (Lungau). The municipal boundary runs at the height of the pass and hence through the centre of the village.

===Climate===
Obertauern has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;).
==History==

===Celts and Romans===

Obertauern has a long history, which goes back to the era of the Celts (4th – 1st century B.C.). Also, the Roman road led over the Tauern Pass (in Alpe) to Iuvavum (Salzburg). The tracks of old Roman wagons have been uncovered on this road. The relics of old milestones attest to Roman use of the pass. The upgrade of the road probably dates back to the time of the Emperor Claudius (41-54).

===Development of the village===

The first definite mention of the Radstädter Tauern was in the year 1207. In 1224, the records note that there was already a small church at the top of the pass. In 1517, it is documented that there were two innkeepers on the Tauern, referring to the houses of Schaidberg and Wisenegg. These two buildings are still in good order today. In 1519, the road was widened for to take coaches and wagons. In 1764, Archbishop Sigismund of Schrattenbach opened the posting house of Untertauern and there were two post runs per week. In 1870 this increased to four per week, and, in 1895, to twice daily. In 1902, the first skiers are recorded.

===The tourist resort of Obertauern===

In 1920, after the First World War, the first skiers came to Obertauern – on foot. Their baggage was transported by horse-drawn sleighs. From 1925 to 1927, the so-called Tauern races for cars and motorcycles took place, attracting many visitors. The people of Obertauern date the foundation of their village to 8 December 1929, because it was on that day that regular winter traffic over the Tauern Pass began for the first time. In 1948, the first lift was installed at the Seekarhaus. From 1948 to 1960, the slope was posted by skiers. For one hour of piste preparation, they got 3 free runs. Roads and avalanche protection were extended in 1950 and the first button lifts were built. The creation of the hotel village of Obertauern began in 1952. Between 1952 and 1961, a large number of modern cable cars, gondola lifts and drag lifts were installed.

===From the 1960s to the present day===
In 1961, the modern cable car on the Zehnerkar was taken into service. In 1962, Obertauern became the official name of the village. One year later, the first motorised piste basher in Austria started work in Obertauern and the pistes no longer had to be tamped down by foot by the skiers. At that time the &quot;Skiing Comprehensive School&quot; (&quot;Schifahrende Volksschule&quot;) became well-known; the school incorporating skiing in the afternoons, after following the normal timetable in the mornings.

In 1965, Obertauern was used by The Beatles in their film, &quot;Help!&quot;. The town was chosen as it was one of the few areas to have snow at the time.

1967 saw piste construction using bulldozers took place for the first time. This resulted in radical changes to the terrain in order to make the runs easier to negotiate for piste maintenance equipment and also for a wider range of tourists. By linking several of the lifts, a precursor to the present day Tauern Circuit (&quot;Tauernrunde&quot;) was created.

In 1985 the first snow cannon was installed and in the years that followed numerous drag lifts and chair lifts were replaced. Between 1991 and 1998 many modernization projects were completed – such as the floodlit ski slope and the introduction of the contactless ski pass system. In December 1999, the German, Christian Flühr, set the world marathon skiing record in Obertauern – skiing for three days non-stop (68 hours and 23 minutes). This is the distance between America and Europe. One season later, in February 2001, Christian Flühr set the world record again by skiing for more than 4 days (103 hours and 21 minutes) non-stop. Later, he beat this world record several times but in other locations.

Obertauern has also established itself as one of the top après ski resorts in Austria. The Edelweißalm and the area around the Lürzer Alm are internationally renowned.

==Cemetery of the Unknown==
At the top of the pass is the Cemetery of the Unknown (&quot;Friedhof der Namenlosen&quot;). The name comes from the time when people crossed the Tauern Pass on foot with poor clothing and equipment, often in bad weather, losing their lives as a result. Often these travellers could not be identified and were thus buried &quot;nameless&quot;. Today it is the cemetery for the population of the ski village of Obertauern.

==Winter sport in Obertauern==

===Skiing and snowboarding===

Skiing is the most popular sporting activity in Obertauern, followed by snowboarding. The ski region has around 100 kilometres of prepared pistes and 26 lifts that are capable of transporting 48,000 - 49,000 people per hour. The area is served by 1 gondola, 19 chair lifts and 6 drag lifts, and has 100 km of runs. The pistes are graded using a colour scheme: blue (61%) for easy runs, red (35%) for runs of medium difficulty and black (4%) for difficult pistes, the piste alongside the Gamsleiten 2 lift being the second steepest run in Austria. All the lifts will take non-skiers to the top as well, but only the Zehnerkarbahn and Grünwaldkopfbahn will take passengers down again. Daytime visitors may park on the 24,000 m2 of car parks in the vicinity of the slopes. The &quot;Liftgemeinschaft Obertauern&quot; (LGO) is responsible for all the lifts.

===The Tauern Circuit===
Because the lifts are laid out in a circle around the village, it is possible to do a &quot;Tauern Circuit&quot; (&quot;Tauernrunde&quot;), either clockwise (following the red signs) or anti-clockwise (following the green signs). To cross the B 99 (&quot;Katschberg-Straße&quot;) there are ski bridges by the Gamsleiten/Edelweiß, Kirchbühel (two bridges) and Grünwaldkopf/Zehnerkar pistes. The circuit may begin at any lift and returns the skier to the start. Good signposting also enables pistes outside the circuit to be skied.

===Cross-country skiing===
In addition to downhill skiing and snowboarding, Obertauern offers other winter sport activities. Visitors may used the 26 kilometres of cut cross-country skiing tracks, including one used for the world cup, as well as hiking trails.

===Ski passes===
Obertauern has its own ski pass that, since the 2012/13 season, is also valid for the Großeck-Speiereck ski region some 15 kilometres away. The Lungo Ski Pass (for the Obertauern - Lungau - Katschberg region) and the &quot;Super Salzburg Ski Card&quot; (Salzburger Land) are also valid, but not the Ski Amadé pass.

==Summer tourism==
In summer, Obertauern is a popular base for numerous hiking trails because the village lies on the Central Alpine Way (&quot;Zentralalpenweg&quot;). The two Alpine huts, &quot;Oberhütte&quot; towards Styria and the &quot;Südwiener Hütte&quot; in the direction of Flachau may be reached in 2 hours on foot.

In August and September, motorcycle gatherings take place.

However, Obertauern is mostly a winter resort and many hotels and businesses are closed in the summertime.

==Obertauern sports centre ==

Obertauern has a sports centre (the &quot;Sportzentrum Obertauern&quot;) where visitors may play various sports. Facilities include: 2 tennis indoor courts, 3 squash courts, 1 badminton court, 3 fully automatic bowling alleys, a bodybuilding and fitness room with a cardio area, a multi-purpose hall as well as a billiards facility. There is also a big vitality centre (600 square metres) and sports medical advice is available. In earlier times, famous sportsmen like Hermann Maier and Michael Walchhofer trained in this centre between races. Heinz Schilchegger, a world-class skier, is also from Obertauern.

==Flora and fauna==

Obertauern is also popular with scientists and friends of nature. In this region you can find the rare red-breasted bluethroat.

<doc id="635365" wikidata="Q5009122" url="?curid=635365" title="CBKST">
<text>CBKST, VHF analogue channel 11, was a CBC Television owned-and-operated station licensed to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, which operated from 1971 to 2012. The station was owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. CBKST&#x27;s master control facilities were located in the Hutchinson Building on 2nd Avenue South (between 21 and 22 Streets East) in Downtown Saskatoon after being relocated from an office tower above Midtown Plaza. Its transmitter was located between Highways 5 and 41.

CBKST was licensed as a rebroadcaster of CBKT-DT in Regina, even though it operated as a semi-satellite with its own associated network of repeaters; it aired separate commercials and (until the 1990s) its own local news broadcasts. On cable, the station was available on Shaw Cable channel 12 and Sasktel Max channel 3.

While the CBC originally planned to discontinue CBKST&#x27;s over the air feed on August 31, 2011 (as the corporation did not originally plan to convert rebroadcasters in mandatory transition markets like Saskatoon to digital), the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted the CBC permission to allow transmitters in selected mandatory markets, including Saskatoon, to still operate an analogue feed until August 31, 2012. On July 17, 2012, the CRTC approved the CBC&#x27;s application to delete CBKST from CBKT&#x27;s licence, effective August 1, 2012. On July 31, 2012, CBKST was shut down after more than 41 years on the air.

Since the closure of CBKST, cable and satellite providers have piped in CBKT (which took over CBKST&#x27;s slots) and other CBC outlets for their customers. Due to the high penetration of cable and satellite in Saskatoon and elsewhere in central and northern Saskatchewan, few viewers actually lost access to CBC programming.

==History==
As early as 1967, efforts were under way to secure a new CBC affiliate for Saskatoon. CFQC-TV, which had been the only station in Saskatoon since going on the air in December 1954, had wished to switch to CTV once the federal government commissioned a new CBC station. In November 1967, however, the federal government declined an application by the CBC to establish a new station, with Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson stating reasons including cost-cutting by the government and the fact CFQC already existed to provide CBC programming.

After this and further delays, the CBC was finally approved to launch a new station in Saskatoon. In a move that would come back to haunt the station, however, it was not licensed as a full standalone station in its own right, but as a rebroadcaster of Regina&#x27;s CBKRT (now CBKT). CBKST ultimately launched at 5:30 p.m. on October 17, 1971 as Saskatoon&#x27;s second television station. CFQC, which had begun airing select CTV programming in off-hours since 1969, became an exclusive CTV affiliate at CBKST&#x27;s launch. The first program aired was the religious music series &quot;Hymn Sing&quot;.

Like most local CBC stations, in the 1970s and 1980s, CBKST had its own newsroom and aired local newscasts and other original programming, as well as locally-aired syndicated reruns of off-network American shows outside of the network schedule. Notable personalities included veteran sportscaster Lloyd Saunders and newscaster Cathy Little. The station&#x27;s studios were originally located on the fifth floor of CN Towers (renamed Tower at Midtown in 2006), an office block located above Saskatoon&#x27;s Midtown Plaza shopping centre. In August 1976, CBKST was temporarily knocked off the air for several days when several chunks of concrete, each weighing several thousand pounds, fell off the side of CN Towers and went crashing into the mall below; fortunately, businesses at the Plaza had closed for the day and no one was injured as there was no one inside the Plaza at that point.

For several years from 1978 until December 31, 1985, CBKST used the brand &quot;Saskatoon 11/12&quot; on-air and in print, reflecting the station&#x27;s respective over-the-air and cable channels in the city. At the time, the CBKST logo consisted of the name &quot;SASKATOON&quot; with the station&#x27;s channel numbers contained within the &quot;O&quot;s. That logo was retired when the CBC&#x27;s reimaging program began on January 1, 1986.

In December 1990, nationwide cutbacks at the CBC resulted in many CBKST staff being laid off and its supper hour newscast cancelled. At this time, the station began sharing the &quot;CBC Saskatchewan&quot; branding with CBKT in Regina. In the early 2000s, the station moved into a new storefront studio facility, taking over the heritage Hutchinson Building, a few blocks away from CN Towers on 2nd Avenue South, which it shared with its Radio-Canada counterpart, CBKFT.

In 2002, CBC purchased former Prince Albert, Saskatchewan affiliate CKBI from previous owner Bell Globemedia (parent company of CTV), turning CKBI into a rebroadcaster of CBKST; prior to this, CKBI had been a separate CBC affiliate (despite the CTV-related ownership).

CBKST had ties to the CBC&#x27;s longest-running import, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, according to the 2002 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; (and noted in previous editions), CBKST acquired 1,144 episodes of the British soap from Granada Television on May 31, 1971, the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction. (CBC&#x27;s English flagship, CBLT in Toronto, was the first to televise &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in Canada, in 1966.)

On May 16, 2008, CBKST was given approval by the CRTC to delete its transmitters in Big River and Tisdale Viewers that had been served by the two stations were later served by two other CBKST transmitters, CBKST-TV-3 Leoville and CBKST-TV-11 Greenwater Lake.
==Transmitters==
CBKST had over 20 analog over-the-air television rebroadcasters in several northern Saskatchewan communities such as Prince Albert and North Battleford.

Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analog transmitters, including CBKST, on July 31, 2012. None of CBC or Radio-Canada&#x27;s rebroadcasters were converted to digital.

<doc id="635366" wikidata="Q362998" url="?curid=635366" title="Gennady Padalka">
<text>Gennady Ivanovich Padalka (; born 21 June 1958 in Krasnodar, Soviet Union) is a Russian Air Force officer and Roscosmos cosmonaut. Padalka is the only person to have served as the commander of the International Space Station (ISS) four times. He previously held the record for the most time spent in space at 878 days until Oleg Kononenko broke this record on February 4, 2024 at 07:30:08 UTC and is currently at 2nd position. He worked on both &quot;Mir&quot; and the International Space Station.

== Personal life ==
Padalka is married to Irina Anatoliyevna Padalka (Ponomareva). They have three daughters: Yuliya, Yekaterina, and Sonya. He enjoys the theater, parachute sport and diving.

== Education and training ==
Padalka graduated from Yeysk Military Aviation College in 1979. After graduation, he served as a pilot and later a senior pilot in the Russian Air Force, eventually attaining the rank of colonel. He has logged 1500 flight hours in six types of aircraft as a First Class Pilot in the Russian Air Force. In addition, he has performed more than 300 parachute jumps as an Instructor of General Parachute Training. Padalka also worked as an engineer-ecologist at the UNESCO International Center of Instruction Systems until 1994. He is an investigator for the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity Project, a US Government funded study investigating strategies for applying diagnostic telemedicine to space.

== Awards ==
Padalka is a recipient of the Hero Star of the Russian Federation and the title of Russian Federation Test-Cosmonaut. He is decorated with Fatherland Service Medal fourth class, Medals of the Russian Federation and also Medal of the International Fund of Cosmonautics support for Service to Cosmonautics. Padalka is a prize winner of the Russian Federation Government in the field of science and technology.

== Cosmonaut career ==

Gennady Padalka was selected as a cosmonaut candidate to start training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in 1989. From June 1989 to January 1991, he attended basic space training and in 1991 was qualified as a test-cosmonaut.

=== &quot;Mir&quot; Mission ===
On 13 August 1998 Gennady launched with Sergei Avdeyev aboard Soyuz TM-28 to become the crew of &quot;Mir&quot; Expedition 26, whose primary mission was to make repairs to life support systems and prepare the station for deorbit, which was to take place after Expedition 27. On 8 February 1999 at 11:23 GMT Padalka and Avdeyev undocked from &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s -X port in Soyuz TM-28, and redocked at the +X Kvant port at 11:39 GMT, freeing up the front port for the Soyuz TM-29 docking. He returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TM-28 capsule on 28 February 1999. The Soyuz TM-28 undocked from the Kvant rear docking port on 27 February at 22:52 GMT and landed in Kazakhstan on 28 February at 02:14 GMT. Padalka accumulated 198 days and 16 hours of space travel during the mission.

=== ISS Missions ===

From June 1999 to July 2000, Padalka trained for a space flight on a Soyuz-TM transport vehicle as an ISS contingency crew commander. From August 2000 to November 2001, he trained for a space flight as the Expedition 4 back-up crew commander.

==== Expedition 9 ====
In March 2002 Padalka was assigned as commander of the ISS Expedition 9 crew. Expedition 9 was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan aboard the Soyuz TMA-4 spacecraft, and docked with the ISS on 21 April 2004. Following a week of joint operations and handover briefings, they replaced the Expedition 8 crew who returned to Earth. In a six-month tour of duty aboard the station Padalka continued ISS science operations, maintained Station systems, and performed four spacewalks. The Expedition 9 mission concluded after undocking and landed back in Kazakhstan on 23 October 2004. In completing this mission, Padalka logged an additional 187 days, 21 minutes and 17 seconds in space, and 15 hours, 45 minutes and 22 seconds of EVA time.

==== Expedition 19/20 ====

Padalka returned to the ISS in 2009 to serve as commander of Expeditions 19 and 20. He commanded the Soyuz TMA-14 spacecraft which was launched from Baikonur on 26 March 2009 and docked with the ISS two days later. Padalka also commanded the first six-person space station crew (Expedition 20), returning to Earth on 11 October 2009.

==== Expedition 31/32 ====
In May 2012 Padalka returned to the ISS for a third time. He served as a flight engineer as part of Expedition 31 before graduating to command Expedition 32.

He launched to the ISS aboard Soyuz TMA-04M on 15 May 2012, along with fellow crew members Sergei Revin and Joseph Acaba and arrived at the space station on 17 May at 4:36 UTC. He, along with Revin and Acaba, returned to Earth on 17 September 2012.

==== Expedition 43/44 ====
Padalka returned to the ISS aboard Soyuz TMA-16M during Expedition 43 and Expedition 44, along with Mikhail Korniyenko and Scott Kelly. He landed on Soyuz TMA-16M on 12 September 2015. Padalka set the record for most time in space of anyone in history that stayed until Oleg Kononenko broke this record on February 4, 2024 at 07:30:08 UTC and is currently at 2nd position.

=== Retirement ===
In April 2017, it was announced that Padalka had filed his resignation from the Roscosmos cosmonaut corps. Padalka himself explained his decision by the fact that he has only a small chance to join any space mission in the near future. &quot;I had to resign. I am tired of doing nothing. There are no prospects that I will fly [to the International Space Station (ISS)],&quot; he told TASS, explaining his decision.

=== Spacewalks ===

On 15 September 1998 Padalka performed the first spacewalk of his career during a stay aboard Mir along with Sergei Avdeyev. After donning spacesuits, the PKhO compartment of the Mir Core Module was depressurized and the spacewalkers entered the dead &quot;Spektr&quot; module at 20:00 GMT. The crew reconnected some cables for the solar panel steering mechanism and closed the hatch a half hour later. The PKhO was then repressurized after a spacewalk which lasted 30 minutes.

On 10 November 1998 Padalka and Avdeyev again ventured out into space. The two made the EVA from the Kvant-2 airlock on Mir. The starting time of the spacewalk was at 19:24 GMT. The two spacewalking cosmonauts installed a meteoroid detector in for the upcoming Leonid shower, and hand-launched the Sputnik-41 amateur-radio mini-satellite. The space walk concluded at 01:18 GMT on 11 November, clocking a total time of 5 hours and 54 minutes.

Padalka&#x27;s third spacewalk was performed on 24 June 2004 from the ISS&#x27;s &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment. The spacewalk was cut short due to a spacesuit malfunction of his fellow spacewalking partner, NASA astronaut Michael Fincke. After Fincke egressed, within minutes flight controllers noticed a decrease in pressure in his primary oxygen tank. Although the spacewalk was planned for six hours, as a result of the problems it only lasted 14 minutes.

On 30 June 2004 Padalka performed his fourth spacewalk along with astronaut Michael Fincke. The duo successfully repaired a faulty circuit breaker on the space station an hour ahead of schedule. During their repair job, the two spacewalkers replaced a failed device called a remote power control module (RPCM) that had cut off power to its gyroscope. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 40 minutes.

On 3 August 2004 Gennady Padalka and Mike Fincke again left the space station to install communications gear and replace space exposure experiments on the outside of the &quot;Zvezda&quot; Service Module. The spacewalk was conducted from the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment airlock and commenced when Padalka and Fincke opened the outer hatch of the airlock at 6:58 GMT. During the spacewalk the two spacewalkers removed six obsolete laser reflectors used for docking and replaced four of them with newer versions. The crew also installed two antennas to allow the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) to communicate with the space station and removed a cable from a faulty television camera. The 4 hour 20 minute excursion out of the ISS marked Padalka&#x27;s fifth career spacewalk.

Padalka completed his sixth career spacewalk on 3 September 2004 when he and Mike Fincke ventured out into space. The spacewalk took place outside the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module. Padalka and Fincke began the spacewalk at 16:43 GMT, after emerging from the &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock. On the &quot;Zarya&quot; module, the two spacewalkers replaced a pump control panel that measures the module&#x27;s coolant levels. They also installed three communications antennas at its aft end of the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 21 minutes.

Padalka completed his seventh career spacewalk on 5 June 2009. He and NASA astronaut Michael Barratt egressed outside the ISS beginning at 7:52 UTC to install docking system antennas and cabling to accommodate the Mini Research Module 2 (MRM-2). The spacewalk began at an hour behind schedule because of higher than expected carbon-dioxide levels in the spacesuits. The spacewalk ended when the two crew members returned to the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment airlock at 12:46 GMT. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 54 minutes.

On 10 June 2009 Gennady Padalka and Michael Barratt entered the transfer compartment in the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module. The &quot;internal spacewalk&quot; began 10 minutes behind schedule because of initial problems with pressure inside the airlock, which did not fall as fast as expected. While they were not in open space outside the ISS, Padalka and Barratt had to wear space suits in the depressurized compartment. During the 12 minute spacewalk the two crew members moved a docking mechanism to accommodate the MRM-2. The event marked the eighth career spacewalk for Padalka.

On 20 August 2012 Padalka, together with cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko, participated in his ninth career spacewalk. Tasks assigned to the two cosmonauts included hardware relocations, installations, retrievals, and deployments. For the spacewalk, Malenchenko donned an Orlan spacesuit with the blue stripe. The duration of the spacewalk was 5 hours and 51 minutes. The spacewalk was delayed for about an hour due to a small leak between International Space Station modules. The spacewalk started from the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment Module at 15:37 GMT. The first task for Padalka and Malenchenko was to relocate the Strela-2 boom from the &quot;Pirs&quot; module to the forward end of the &quot;Zarya&quot; module. The relocation was needed since &quot;Pirs&quot; module was to be detached from the Space Station for the arrival of the new Multi-purpose Laboratory Module (MLM) &quot;Nauka&quot;, both of which occurred in 2021. The next task completed by Padalka and Malenchenko was to deploy a 21-inch diameter spherical satellite. The two cosmonauts also retrieved five debris shields from the &quot;Pirs&quot; Module, prior to installing them on the &quot;Zvezda&quot; Module. They also completed several get-ahead tasks (since they both opted not to take rests during the night passes) as the duo were about an hour ahead of the timeline. They retrieved an external experiment called Biorisk from the &quot;Pirs&quot; Module for return to Earth, and for added stability installed two structural support struts between the &quot;Pirs&quot; Module and the EVA ladder. Padalka and Malenchenko then both ingressed the &quot;Pirs&quot; Module, prior to closing the hatch and beginning the re-pressurisation procedure, to end a successful spacewalk.

<text>Rochdale ( ) is a town in Greater Manchester, England, and the administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale. In the 2021 Census, the town had a population of 111,261, compared to 223,773 for the wider borough. Rochdale is in the foothills of the South Pennines and lies in the dale (valley) of the River Roch, north-west of Oldham and north-east of Manchester.

Rochdale&#x27;s recorded history begins with an entry in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Recedham Manor&quot;, but can be traced back to the 9th century. The ancient parish of Rochdale was a division of the Salford Hundred and one of the larger ecclesiastical parishes in England, comprising several townships. By 1251, the town had become of such importance that it was granted a royal charter.

The town became a centre of northern England&#x27;s woollen trade and, by the early 18th century, was described as being &quot;remarkable for its many wealthy merchants.&quot; In the 19th century, it became a mill town and centre for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The town was historically in Lancashire and was a county borough within it before 1974.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The town is recorded as &quot;Recedham&quot; in the Domesday Book and &quot;Rachetham&quot; in 1193. Variations of &quot;Rechedham&quot; continue into the thirteenth century when the first element&#x27;s termination is dropped as &quot;Rachedam&quot; became &quot;Racheham&quot;. This change was soon followed with the suffix &quot;-ham&quot; (homestead) changing to &quot;-dale&quot; (wide valley).

&quot;Rachdale&quot; is recorded as a name for the town in 1242, but may have been used earlier as a name for the valley, Hundred and Parish. The Domesday Book&#x27;s rendering of the name led Eilert Ekwall to suggest a derivation from &quot;reced&quot;, an obscure Old English element meaning &quot;hall&quot;.

Although the name of the river is still pronounced (with a long vowel sound), Rochdale is pronounced (with a shorter &quot;o&quot; sound).

===Early history===
A Roman road, leading from Mamucium (Manchester) to Eboracum (York), crossed the moors at Blackstone Edge.

Rochdale was subjected to incursions by the Danes; the castle that Castleton is named after, and of which no trace remains, was one of twelve Saxon forts possibly destroyed in frequent conflicts that occurred between the Saxons and Danes during the 10th and 11th centuries. At the time of the Norman Conquest, the manor was held by a Saxon thegn, Gamel. Rochdale appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Recedham&quot; and was described as lying within the hundred of Salford and the county of Cheshire. At that time, Rochdale was under the lordship of Roger the Poitevin. Before 1212, Henry II granted the manor to Roger de Lacy, whose family retained it as part of the Honour of Clitheroe until it passed to the Dukes of Lancaster by marriage and then to the Crown by 1399. In medieval times, weekly markets were held from 1250 when Edmund de Lacy obtained a grant for a market and an annual fair. The market was held outside the parish church where there was an &quot;Orator&#x27;s Corner&quot;.

John Byron bought the manor in 1638 and it was sold by the poet, Lord Byron, to the Deardens in 1823, who hold the title. Rochdale did not have a manor house but the &quot;Orchard&quot;, built in 1702 and acquired in 1745 by Simon Dearden, was the home of the lords of the manor after 1823. It was described as &quot;a red-brick building of no architectural distinction, on the north side of the river opposite the town hall&quot; and sometimes referred to as the &quot;Manor House&quot;. It was demolished in 1922.

===Industrial Revolution===
Rochdale is a product of the Industrial Revolution, though the manufacture of woollen cloth, particularly baize, kerseys and flannels, was locally important as far back as the 1500s. At that time, the textile industry was rooted in the domestic system but, towards the end of the 18th century, mills powered by water started to appear.

Water power was replaced by steam power in the 19th century and local coal became important. The Deardens who were lords of the manor were among the local coal mine owners. By the mid-1800s, the woollen trade was declining and the cotton trade was rapidly growing in importance. Cotton manufacturing took advantage of new technological developments in spinning and weaving. In 1804, the Rochdale Canal opened, providing the first link over the Pennines between Lancashire and Yorkshire.

During the 19th century, Rochdale became one of the world&#x27;s most prominent cotton processing towns rising to prominence and becoming a major centre for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution and was amongst the first ever industrialised towns. By the end of the 19th century, Rochdale had woollen mills, silk manufacturers, bleachers and dyers, though cotton spinning and weaving were the dominant industries in the community.

The socioeconomic change brought by the success of Rochdale&#x27;s textile industry in the 19th century led to its rise to borough status and it became an important regional town based upon this economic success.

The Rochdale Pioneers opened the first Co-operative shop in Toad Lane in 1844. The reformer and Member of Parliament, John Bright (1811–1889), was born in Rochdale and gained a reputation as a leader of political dissent and supporter of the Anti-Corn Law League.

===Decline of textile manufacturing===
By the middle of the 20th century, Rochdale&#x27;s economy was in decline, reflecting the broader economic situation in other textile manufacturing towns in the North West England. This decline was largely driven by the global availability of cheaper textile product offerings from abroad.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Rochdale&#x27;s lack of a diverse economic base became very apparent, with the closure of numerous textile manufacturing facilities. Textile manufacturing did remain a major contributor to the local economy, even into the 1970s. Regionally, numerous companies still have some connection to the textile industry.

==Governance==
Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Rochdale was recorded in 1066 as held by Gamel, one of the twenty-one thegns of the Hundred of Salfordshire.

The ancient ecclesiastical parish of Rochdale was divided into four townships: Butterworth, Castleton, Hundersfield and Spotland. Hundersfield was later divided into four townships: Blatchinworth, Calderbrook, Wardleworth and Wuerdle &amp; Wardle.

Excluding the large chapelry of Saddleworth, which lay entirely in Yorkshire, the parish of Rochdale had an area of .

In 1825, commissioners for the social and economic improvement of the town were established. The town became part of a parliamentary borough in 1832. As there were no existing township boundaries, the commissioners and later the parliamentary constituency were deemed to cover a circular area extending three-quarters of a mile from the old market-place.

Under the terms of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, the town became the head of Rochdale Poor Law Union, which was established on 15 February 1837, despite considerable local opposition. In 1856, Rochdale was incorporated as a municipal borough, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom, and it obtained the powers of the improvement commissioners after 1858.

In 1872, the remaining area of Wardleworth township and parts of Castleton, Wuerdle and Wardle, Spotland and Butterworth townships were added to the borough.

When the administrative county of Lancashire was created by the Local Government Act 1888, Rochdale was elevated to become the County Borough of Rochdale and was, in modern terms, a unitary authority area exempt from the administration of Lancashire County Council. In 1900, most of Castleton Urban District was added to the borough; this urban district included parts of Castleton, Hopwood and Thornham townships. In 1933, parts of Norden Urban District and Birtle with Bamford civil parish were added to the borough.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, the town&#x27;s autonomous county borough status was abolished. The municipal boroughs of Middleton and Heywood and Littleborough, Milnrow and Wardle urban districts are now part of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, one of the ten metropolitan boroughs in Greater Manchester.

===Parliamentary representation===
The Rochdale constituency was created by the Reform Act of 1832. The constituency was held for two decades during the 20th century by Cyril Smith, first of the Liberal Party and then of the Liberal Democrats.

Following the 2010 general election, the town was represented by Simon Danczuk, who was elected as a Labour MP but was subsequently suspended and placed under investigation by the Labour Party.

Tony Lloyd (Labour) was elected as MP for the Rochdale constituency in the 2017 general election and represented the constituency until his death on 17 January 2024. The seat was subsequently won by George Galloway, leader and founder of the Workers Party of Britain, in the 2024 Rochdale by-election on 29 February; the campaign was dominated by opposition to British involvement in the Israel-Hamas war. Six months later, Galloway was defeated in the 2024 election by Labour&#x27;s Paul Waugh.

==Geography==

Rochdale is approximately above sea level, north-north-east of Manchester city centre, in the valley of the River Roch. Blackstone Edge, Saddleworth Moor and the South Pennines are close to the east; on all other sides, Rochdale is bound by other towns including Whitworth, Littleborough, Milnrow, Royton, Heywood and Shaw and Crompton, with little or no green space between them.

Rochdale&#x27;s built environment consists of a mixture of infrastructure, housing types and commercial buildings from a number of periods. Its housing stock is mixed, but has a significant amount of stone or red-brick terraced houses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Rochdale&#x27;s Town Hall, seven large tower blocks (locally nicknamed &quot;The Seven Sisters&quot;) and a number of former cotton mills mark the town&#x27;s skyline. The urban structure of Rochdale is regular when compared to most towns in England; its form is restricted in places by its hilly upland terrain.

Much of Rochdale&#x27;s built environment is centred around a central business district in the town centre, which is the local centre of both the town and borough.

There are a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Rochdale, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban.

For purposes of the Office for National Statistics, the Borough of Rochdale forms the fifth largest settlement of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom&#x27;s third largest conurbation.

==Demography==
===2001===
At the 2001 UK census, Rochdale had a population of 95,796. The population density was , with a 100 to 94.4 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 28.2% were single (never married), 44.0% married and 8.8% divorced. Rochdale&#x27;s 37,730 households included 30.4% one-person, 36.6% married couples living together, 8.4% were co-habiting couples and 11.1% single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 37.1% had no academic qualifications, similar to the figure for all of Rochdale, but higher than that of 28.9% in all of England. Rochdale has the highest number of Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance claimants in Greater Manchester, with 6.1 per cent of its adult population claiming the benefit in early 2010.

===2011===
Rochdale had a population of 107,926, which made it about the same size as Salford and Stockport; this was an increase from 95,796 in 2001. It is one of four townships in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, along with Middleton, Heywood and Pennine (a township which includes Littleborough and Wardle). Rochdale is considered an Urban Subdivision by the local borough council.

34.8% of Rochdale&#x27;s population were non-White British, compared with 21.4% for the surrounding borough. Rochdale town also has almost double the percentage of Asians compared with the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, which had a population of 211,699 in 2011. This means that the town takes up almost 55% of the borough&#x27;s population.

===2021===
The town of Rochdale&#x27;s population was enumerated at 111,261; its ethnic makeup was 57.2% White, 34.3% Asian, 2.6% Mixed, 3.4% Black, 2.1% Other and 0.5% Arab. The town&#x27;s religious makeup was 38% Christian, 36% Muslim, 24.2% No Religion and has small Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist and Jewish communities.

More than 40% of children in the Rochdale borough are living in poverty.

==Landmarks==


There are four grade I listed buildings in the town: the Town Hall, the Cenotaph, the Church of St Mary in the Baum, and St Edmund&#x27;s Church.

Rochdale Town Hall is a Victorian era town hall &quot;widely recognised as being one of the finest municipal buildings in the country.&quot; It is the ceremonial headquarters of Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council and houses local government departments, including the borough&#x27;s civil registration office.

Built in the Gothic Revival style, it was inaugurated on 27 September 1871. The architect, William Henry Crossland, won a competition held in 1864. The town hall had a clock tower, topped by a wooden spire with a gilded statue of Saint George and the Dragon, which were destroyed by fire on 10 April 1883. A new stone clock tower and spire in the style of Manchester Town Hall was designed by Alfred Waterhouse and erected in 1888. Art critic Nikolaus Pevsner described the building as possessing a &quot;rare picturesque beauty.&quot; Its stained glass windows, some designed by William Morris, are credited as &quot;the finest modern examples of their kind.&quot; It has been described as one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s finest examples of Victorian Gothic revival architecture.

The building came to the attention of Adolf Hitler, who was said to have admired it so much that he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had the United Kingdom been defeated in the Second World War.

The Rochdale Cenotaph, a war memorial bearing four sculpted and painted flags, is located opposite the town hall. It commemorates those who died in conflicts since the First World War. The monument and surrounding gardens were designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Rochdale&#x27;s cenotaph is one of eight designed by Lutyens in England. The earliest to be erected was at Southampton in 1920; the last at Norwich in 1927. The monument is made from Cornish granite and sits on the site of a building known as Manor House, which was used as a recruiting station during World War I. The cenotaph was built by Hobson Ltd of Nottingham at a cost of £12,611. It was unveiled by the Earl of Derby on 26 November 1922 and dedicated by the Archdeacon of Rochdale. It is about 10m tall and the top section is a catafalque, which includes a carving of a horizontal figure.

Adjacent to the town hall is a statue of the late singer, comedian and actress Dame Gracie Fields. The statue was unveiled by Roy Hudd on 18 September 2016. It was created by sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn, who based the statue on Fields&#x27; look during the 1940s. The statue was the first of a woman to be unveiled in Greater Manchester in more than 100 years and was part of Rochdale Borough Council&#x27;s wider regeneration of the town centre.

In Broadfield Park in the town centre, there is a statue of John Bright MP, a British Radical and Liberal statesman, who is regarded as one of the greatest orators of his generation and a promoter of free trade policies. Bright was born in Rochdale; he became famous for his crusade to repeal Britain&#x27;s corn laws and his promotion of religious freedom and electoral reform.

Worthy of note is a large industrial park, named the Kingsway Business Park, for which planning permission for its construction began in 2009. The complex covers an area of .

==Transport==
Public transport in Rochdale is coordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), which owns the bus station and co-ordinates transport services in the area.

===Railway and Metrolink===
Demand from the cross-Pennine trade to support local cotton, wool and silk industries led to the building of the Manchester and Leeds Railway. It opened in 1839 from Manchester to Littleborough and from Normanton to Hebden Bridge in 1840. The linking section opened on completion of the Summit Tunnel in 1841.

Rochdale railway station is located about a mile south of the town centre. Northern Trains operates services on the following routes:
* to , via and ; alternate services extend to 
* Leeds to , via , and 
* to , via Manchester Victoria, and .

The stopping service to Manchester Victoria on the Oldham Loop line ended in October 2009, in preparation for conversion of the line to an extension of the Metrolink light rail system. It was deferred in 2004 on grounds of cost but, in July 2006, plans were approved for the extension from Manchester Victoria as far as Rochdale railway station; it opened on 28 February 2013, as the &quot;Oldham and Rochdale Line&quot;. The extension to Rochdale town centre, via Drake Street and terminating opposite Rochdale Interchange, opened on 31 March 2014.

Metrolink services operate currently to East Didsbury tram stop, via Manchester city centre, on the &quot;Pink&quot; line.

===Buses===
The borough&#x27;s bus service was provided by a municipal operator, &quot;Rochdale Corporation Transport&quot;, which was merged into the SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive in 1969.

Following deregulation of bus services across England Rochdale was host to a number of bus operators. First Manchester (previously GM Buses North) established itself as the dominant company for interurban routes to destinations such as Manchester, Shaw, Oldham, Bury and Bolton. Rossendale Transport (Rebranded Rosso in 2013) owned by Rossendale Borough Council between 1986 and 2017 until being sold to Transdev was the largest operator of local bus routes within Rochdale operating brands such as Rochdale Rovers, the 464 and Lakeline.

Rochdale&#x27;s old bus station closed in November 2013 and was demolished in April 2014, along with the multi-storey car park and municipal offices (known locally as &quot;The Black Box&quot;), to make way for the new Rochdale Riverside retail and leisure development. Its replacement, Rochdale Interchange, is located next to the council office and main library building Number One Riverside and is linked with Rochdale Town Centre tram stop.

Since September 24, 2023 (Route 471) / March 24th 2024 (All Other Routes except 464/587/590) bus service in Rochdale has been provided by Bee Network under the franchising system. As of 2025, Stagecoach Manchester operates the 409 to Oldham/Ashton and the principal 17 which is the direct bus to Middleton/Manchester. Go North West operates the 471 to Bury/Rochdale while all other local Bee Network routes to destinations such as Bury/Littleborough are provided by First Manchester out of their Rochdale Depot.

Cross-county services are provided by Rosso to Rawtenstall and Accrington; First Halifax to Todmorden; Team Pennine to Halifax, via Ripponden; and National Express to London.

===Roads===
The earliest routes around Rochdale were tracks and packhorse routes, with a paved track over Blackstone Edge into Yorkshire that had Roman origins. As trade increased, the Blackstone Edge turnpike road was built in 1735.

The M62 motorway passes to the south of the town and is accessed via the A627(M), which starts at Sandbrook Park in Rochdale and runs to Elk Mill in Chadderton. The A627(M) also provides access to Oldham.

===Canals===
The idea for the Rochdale Canal emerged in 1776, when James Brindley was commissioned to survey possible routes between Sowerby Bridge and Manchester.

However, it was not until 4 April 1794 that an Act of Parliament was obtained. The broad canal which linked the Bridgewater Canal in Manchester with the Aire and Calder Navigation at Sowerby Bridge became a major artery of commerce between Lancashire and Yorkshire for cotton, wool, coal, limestone, timber and salt. The Rochdale Canal has the highest concentration of canal locks in the regional northern canal system; it houses 91 locks over .

Hollingworth Lake is part of the canal system. It was designed originally to regulate water levels and was part of the original engineering initiative. By the 1950s, the canal had fallen into general disuse and was abandoned in the 1960s, along with many other industrial areas that had supported traditional industries. The lower section from the Bridgewater Canal to the junction with the Ashton Canal was restored as part of the Cheshire Ring in 1974. The rest of the canal was restored and reopened in 2003. Local activist groups have worked to further improve the canal.

<text>George Edward Armstrong (July 6, 1930 – January 24, 2021) was a Canadian professional ice hockey centre who played 21 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Toronto Maple Leafs. He played 1,188 NHL games between 1950 and 1971, all with Toronto and a franchise record. He was the team&#x27;s captain for 13 seasons. Armstrong was a member of four Stanley Cup championship teams and played in seven NHL All-Star Games. He scored the final goal of the NHL&#x27;s &quot;Original Six&quot; era as Toronto won the 1967 Stanley Cup.

Armstrong played both junior and senior hockey in the Toronto Marlboros organization and was a member of the 1950 Allan Cup winning team as senior champions of Canada. He returned to the Marlboros following his playing career and coached the junior team to two Memorial Cup championships. He served as a scout for the Quebec Nordiques, as an assistant general manager of the Maple Leafs and for part of the 1988–89 NHL season as Toronto&#x27;s head coach. Armstrong was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1975 and the Maple Leafs honoured his uniform number 10 in 1998, and later officially retired the number, along with ten others, during a pre-game ceremony on October 15, 2016.

==Early life==
Armstrong was born in 1930 in Skead, Ontario, to an Irish Canadian father, Frederick James Armstrong (1907–1990), and a mixed Algonquin-Anishinabe mother, Alice Decaire (1907–2005). The couple were married in Sudbury in 1929 and George arrived eleven months later. He grew up in Falconbridge, Ontario where his father was a nickel miner. He had one sister, Lillian Ellen McCourt (1936–2016). Sport was an important part of Armstrong&#x27;s family as his father played soccer and his mother was a canoeist. The younger Armstrong developed a passion for hockey but was a poor skater, which his father believed was a consequence of a case of spinal meningitis George suffered at the age of six.

While attending Sudbury High School, Armstrong played on the hockey team with Red McCarthy and Tim Horton. Inspired by a newspaper advertisement offering tryouts with the Copper Cliff Redmen of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association (NOJHA), Armstrong convinced Horton and McCarthy to join him in trying out. They made the team and Armstrong began his junior hockey career at age 16 in the 1946–47 season. He recorded six goals and five assists in nine games and caught the attention of scouts for the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s Toronto Maple Leafs who added him to their protected list. He also played with the Prince Albert Blackhawks for part of that season. Armstrong quit school in grade 11 to focus on his hockey career.

==Playing career==

===Junior and senior===
The Maple Leafs placed Armstrong on the Stratford Kroehlers in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) junior division for the 1947–48 season. He led the league in both assists (43) and points (73), and was named recipient of the Red Tilson Trophy as the OHA&#x27;s most valuable player. Promoted to the Toronto Marlboros for the 1948–49 season, Armstrong recorded 62 points in 39 games with the junior squad and played in three regular season and ten post-season matches for the senior team. Armstrong remained with the senior Marlboros in 1949–50 where he served as captain. He led the OHA senior division with 64 goals, at the time an OHA record, and recorded 115 points in 39 games. He was again named the winner of the Red Tilson Trophy.

The Maple Leafs briefly recalled Armstrong during the 1949–50 season and he made his NHL debut on December 3, 1949. He appeared in two games before returning to the Marlboros. In the 1950 Allan Cup playdowns, he recorded 19 goals and 19 assists in 14 games as the Marlboros won the national senior championship. It was also during the season that he earned his nickname. While visiting the Stoney Reserve in Alberta with the Marlboros, the locals presented Armstrong with a ceremonial headdress and called him &quot;Big Chief Shoot the Puck&quot; owing to his own Native heritage. The nickname was often shortened to &quot;Chief&quot;.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===

Upon turning professional in 1950–51, Armstrong was assigned to Toronto&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Pittsburgh Hornets. In 71 games for Pittsburgh, he recorded 15 goals and 48 points. Despite being hampered by hand and wrist injuries suffered in fights, Armstrong was the AHL&#x27;s leading goal scorer and stood second in points by mid-season in 1951–52. He was recalled to Toronto during the season and scored his first NHL goal, against goaltender Gerry McNeil of the Montreal Canadiens. It was the first goal ever scored by a player with Native heritage. He finished the season with three goals and three assists in 20 games with Toronto.

Though he missed the start of the 1952–53 season due to a separated shoulder, Armstrong earned a permanent spot on the Maple Leafs&#x27; roster. He quietly established himself as an important contributor for Toronto by recording 25 points that season, then scoring 32 points the following season and 28 in 1954–55. A 48-point season in 1955–56 was second on the team to Tod Sloan&#x27;s 66. Armstrong then led the Maple Leafs in scoring with 44 points in 1956–57 despite missing 14 of his team&#x27;s games. He was named to play in the NHL All-Star Game in both seasons. They were the first two of seven he ultimately played.

The Maple Leafs named Armstrong the team&#x27;s captain in 1957–58 as he succeeded Ted Kennedy and Jim Thomson who served as co-captains the season before. He finished fourth in team scoring with 42 points, then played his third All-Star Game during the 1958–59 season. He recorded four assists in the playoffs as the Maple Leafs reached the 1959 Stanley Cup Finals, but lost to the Montreal Canadiens. With 51 points in 1959–60, Armstrong finished one behind Bob Pulford for the team lead. Toronto again reached the Stanley Cup Finals where they were again eliminated by Montreal.

The Maple Leafs finally reached the NHL&#x27;s peak two seasons later. Armstrong set a career high with 53 points in the 1961–62 regular season, then added 12 points in 12 playoff games for Toronto. He started the play that resulted in the Stanley Cup clinching goal, rushing the puck up ice before passing to Tim Horton, who then passed to goal-scorer Dick Duff that capped off a 2–1 victory in the sixth and deciding game of the series against the Chicago Black Hawks. As Maple Leafs captain, Armstrong was presented the trophy by league president Clarence Campbell. It was the first of three consecutive championships for Toronto as the Maple Leafs of 1962–1964 became the fourth dynasty in NHL history. Individually, Armstrong scored 21, 19 and 20 goals over the three seasons and by virtue of the NHL&#x27;s All-Star Game format of the time that had the defending champion play the all-stars of the remaining teams, appeared in his fourth, fifth and sixth All-Star Games. Early in the 1963–64 season, on December 1, 1963, Armstrong scored his 200th career NHL goal.

A 37-point season followed in 1964–65, then 51 points the 1965–66 season. By 1966–67, Armstrong led an aging Maple Leafs team which entered the playoffs as an underdog against a dominant Chicago team. The Maple Leafs nonetheless eliminated the Black Hawks in six games to set up the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals against Montreal. The Canadiens were so confident of victory that a display area for the Stanley Cup had been set up at the Quebec pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal prior to the series&#x27; start. The Maple Leafs dashed Montreal&#x27;s hopes by winning the championship in six games. Armstrong scored the final goal of the series in a 3–1 victory in the deciding contest. It was also the last goal scored in the NHL&#x27;s &quot;Original Six&quot; era as the league was set to double in size to 12 teams for the 1967–68 season.

Armstrong announced his intention to retire as a player following the championship then changed his mind and returned for another season. The Maple Leafs placed him on their protected list for the 1967 Expansion Draft and he remained with Toronto. He played in his seventh All-Star Game in 1968 and finished the season with 34 points. Retiring following the season before changing his mind became an annual event for Armstrong as he announced his intention to leave the game in five straight years. He remained a consistent scorer for Toronto, recording 27, 28 and 25 points in his following three seasons. He finally ended his playing career after the 1970–71 season to take an office position with the Maple Leafs finishing his career with two hundred and ninety-six goals, four goals away from obtaining three hundred. At the time of his retirement, Armstrong was second to Dit Clapper for the longest tenure as a team captain in NHL history.

==Coaching and scouting career==
Armstrong was announced as the head coach of his former junior team, the Toronto Marlboros, in July 1972. Though he had preferred his previous role as a scout to coaching, Armstrong led the Marlboros to Memorial Cup victories on two occasions: in 1973 and 1975. In 1977, Armstrong&#x27;s name circulated as a possible successor to Maple Leafs coach Red Kelly when the latter was fired by the team. When approached by the organization with the prospect of assuming head coaching duties however, Armstrong rejected the possibility. His decision resulted in animosity from within the organization and subsequently led to his resignation as coach of the Marlboros that season to accept a scouting post with the Quebec Nordiques.

Some 10 years later, Armstrong returned to the Maple Leafs organization in the dual capacities of assistant general manager and scout. During the 1988–89 season, and after management had fired head coach John Brophy, team owner Harold Ballard was adamant that Armstrong be named Brophy&#x27;s replacement. Armstrong agreed to take the position, but increasingly delegated majority of his duties to assistant coach Garry Lariviere. The Maple Leafs finished with 17 wins in 47 Armstrong&#x27;s games coached, falling just short of the fourth and final playoff berth in the Norris Division. Needing a win in their final regular season game, against the Chicago Blackhawks at Chicago Stadium, to capture the playoff berth, the Leafs would heartbreakingly lose to the Hawks in overtime. Armstrong was replaced by Doug Carpenter the following season and returned to his scouting capacities with the team. Armstrong remained a scout for the rest of his life. In 1972–73, he was selected as Coach of the Year by his peers in the OHL (Toronto Marlboros).

==Playing style==
The Toronto Maple Leafs described Armstrong as being a &quot;consistent, durable and hardworking&quot; player throughout his 21-season career that spanned parts of four decades. A consummate leader, Armstrong was lauded by owner Conn Smythe as &quot;the best captain, as a captain, the Leafs have ever had&quot;. His 713 career points were the second most all-time in Toronto franchise history at the time of his retirement, and as of 2014 remains fifth-best. His 1,187 NHL games are the most by any player in Toronto history, and he remains the franchise leader with 417 career assists and 713 points by a right wing. The Maple Leafs named him the co-recipient, with Bob Pulford, of the J. P. Bickell Memorial Award in 1959. The award is presented to members of the organization who perform with a high standard of excellence. In 1998, the franchise honoured his uniform number 10. In 2013, he ranked number 14 on Sportsnet&#x27;s list of the greatest Maple Leafs. Armstrong was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1975 and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Personal life==
Armstrong was a resident in Leaside, a neighbourhood in Toronto, for more than 55 years and often spent time with his family bike riding throughout the area. Aside from his coaching career in professional hockey, Armstrong coached sports teams around his community and contributed his time coaching the first floor hockey team for the Canadian Special Olympics. In Toronto, Beverley Street Public School was the foundation of this floor hockey team.

Armstrong resided in Toronto with his wife Betty. The couple had four children: Brian, Betty-Ann, Fred and Lorne. He was the uncle of Dale McCourt, a former first overall draft pick by the Detroit Red Wings in the 1977 NHL amateur draft. His nephew Dan McCourt, Dale&#x27;s brother, officiated in excess of 1,700 NHL games.

When given a day with the Stanley Cup in 2005, Armstrong elected to have a family gathering with it at his son&#x27;s home in Vaughan, Ontario. His granddaughter Kalley was a team captain with the Harvard Crimson women&#x27;s ice hockey program. She joined Kelly Paton&#x27;s coaching staff with the Western Mustangs women&#x27;s ice hockey program in the autumn of 2016. After coaching a girls team in the Little Native Hockey League annual event for First Nation youth in Ontario, in 2019 she started Armstrong Hockey, running annual camps and programs providing hockey development opportunities for Indigenous youth, particularly girls, and working to honour and celebrate her grandfather&#x27;s legacy in the Indigenous community.

Armstrong was recognized by the NHL for his charitable efforts in 1969 when he was named the inaugural recipient of the Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award. Proud of his Native heritage, Armstrong often supported programs organized by both Indian and Northern Affairs and non-governmental agencies that aimed to promote positive role models for Native children.

Armstrong had a brief film career, appearing as himself in the 1971 film &quot;Face-Off&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Winter Comes Early&quot;.

Armstrong died on January 24, 2021, at age 90, having suffered from heart complications in the time leading up to his death.

<text>The 2003 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the Grand Prix de Monaco 2003) was a Formula One motor race held on 1 June 2003 at the Circuit de Monaco. It was the seventh race of the 2003 Formula One World Championship. The 78-lap race was won by Colombian driver Juan Pablo Montoya, driving a Williams-BMW (the first victory of Williams in Monaco since 1983 with Keke Rosberg), with Finn Kimi Räikkönen second in a McLaren-Mercedes and German Michael Schumacher third in a Ferrari.

There were no recorded on-track overtakes during this race, one of the very few occasions in Formula One history where this has occurred. The other three races since 1981 not to feature any on-track overtakes were the controversial 2005 United States and 2021 Belgian Grands Prix, as well as the 2009 European Grand Prix.

==Background==
The Grand Prix was contested by 20 drivers, in ten teams of two. The teams, also known as constructors, were Ferrari, Williams, McLaren, Renault, Sauber, Jordan, Jaguar, BAR, Minardi and Toyota.

Before the race, McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 40 points; Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was second on 38 points. Behind them in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Rubens Barrichello was third on 26 points in the other Ferrari, with Fernando Alonso and David Coulthard on 25 and 23 points respectively. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari were leading with 64 points and McLaren were second on 63 points, with Renault third on 35 points.

==Practice==
Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—Two on Thursday, and two on Saturday. The Thursday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final practice sessions were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. Jaguar driver Mark Webber set the fastest time in the first session, posting a lap of 1:16.373, one-tenth of a second quicker than Jenson Button and Coulthard, in second and third places respectively. The Renault cars were fourth and fifth fastest; Alonso ahead of Jarno Trulli, with Michael Schumacher rounding out the top six.

==Qualifying==
The qualifying session was run as a one-lap session and took place on Thursday and Saturday afternoon. The cars were run one at a time; the Thursday running order was determined with the Championship leading heading out first. The Saturday running order was determined by times set in Friday afternoon qualifying with the fastest heading out last and the slowest running first. The lap times from the Thursday afternoon session did not determine the grid order.

Jenson Button suffered a heavy crash during Saturday morning practice and his resulting injuries meant that he took no further part in the weekend.

<text>Marshall William Faulk (born February 26, 1973) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons and current running backs coach at the University of Colorado. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest running backs of all time.

Faulk played college football for the San Diego State Aztecs, with whom he was a two-time unanimous All-American. He was selected by the Colts as the second overall pick in the 1994 NFL draft; he was with the Colts for five seasons and played the last eight seasons of his career with the Rams. Faulk was a member of the Greatest Show on Turf, a name given to the St. Louis Rams team that appeared in two Super Bowls and won Super Bowl XXXIV. He was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the 2000 season.

Faulk is one of only three NFL players to reach at least 10,000 rushing yards and 5,000 receiving yards and the only one to amass 12,000 yards rushing and 6,000 yards receiving. He was also an analyst for various programs on NFL Network until December 2017. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Early life==
Faulk was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. He attended Carver High School in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he played for the Carver Rams high school football team. Also a standout track sprinter, Faulk was timed at 10.3 seconds in the 100 meters, 21.74 over 200 meters, and 49.4 in the 400 meters. While growing up he sold popcorn at New Orleans Saints games in the Louisiana Superdome.

During his final two years playing for Carver High, Faulk rushed 1,800 yards and scored thirty-two touchdowns. In his senior season, he also played defensive back, intercepting 11 passes and returning six of them for touchdowns.

==College career==
Faulk was heavily recruited by several major colleges, but due to his standout performance on defense, most of them recruited him to play the cornerback position. However, Faulk strongly desired to play the running back position in college. &quot;I didn&#x27;t love playing cornerback, so I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be as successful in that position,&quot; Faulk told &quot;Sports Illustrated Kids&quot;. &quot;You have to really love what you do to be a star.&quot; Ultimately he accepted an athletic scholarship to attend San Diego State University, because they were the first team to offer him a scholarship to play running back.

One of the best performances of his career was against the University of the Pacific on September 14, 1991, in just his second collegiate game. In 37 carries, he amassed 386 yards and scored seven touchdowns, both records for freshmen (the 386 yards were a then-NCAA record). &quot;Faulk had scoring runs of 61, 7, 47, 9, 5, 8 and 25 yards.&quot; That performance sparked one of the greatest freshman seasons in NCAA history, gaining 1,429 yards rushing, with 1,630 total yards from scrimmage, 23 total touchdowns (21 rushing), and 140 points scored. At the end of the year, Faulk joined Tony Dorsett and Herschel Walker as one of just three true freshmen ever selected to the College Football All-America Team by the Associated Press.

Faulk went on to better 1,600 yards rushing in his sophomore year. In Faulk&#x27;s junior season in 1993, he was finally able to showcase his all-purpose ability by catching 47 passes for 640 yards and 3 touchdowns to go with 1,530 yards and 21 touchdowns on the ground. These numbers put Faulk 3rd in the nation in all-purpose yardage that year, and 2nd in scoring. Faulk left San Diego State University with many of the school&#x27;s offensive records, among them 5,562 all-purpose yards and 62 career touchdowns, which is the 8th most in NCAA history.

After his 1992 season at SDSU, Faulk finished second in the Heisman Trophy award voting, losing to quarterback Gino Torretta in what was considered a notable snub in the history of the award. Torretta&#x27;s 1992 Miami Hurricanes football team was undefeated in the regular season and ranked No. 1 in the country before the Heisman balloting, Faulk&#x27;s team finished with a middling 5–5–1 record, continuing a trend of the Heisman going to the most notable player on one of the nation&#x27;s best teams. ESPN analyst Lee Corso led a campaign supporting Torretta for the Heisman and left Marshall Faulk off of his ballot. Faulk was a Heisman finalist as well in 1991 (9th) and 1993 (4th).

In 1992, Faulk was named Arthur Ashe Sports Scholar Jr. by &quot;Diverse: Issues In Higher Education&quot;.

==Professional career==

===1994 NFL Draft===
Along with defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson and quarterbacks Heath Shuler and Trent Dilfer, Faulk was regarded as &quot;one of the four players who rank well above the others in this draft&quot;. and on March 31, he ran a 4.35 forty-yard time at the San Diego State Pro Day. The Bengals had the No. 1 pick in the 1994 NFL draft, and contemplated combining their heavy-duty runner Harold Green with the explosive Faulk, but picked Wilkinson, leaving Faulk for the Indianapolis Colts.

===Indianapolis Colts (1994–1998)===
Faulk was drafted in the first round with the second overall pick in the 1994 NFL draft by the Indianapolis Colts, who were in desperate need of a running game. On July 25, 1994, Faulk signed a seven-year $17.2 million contract and received a $5.1 million signing bonus. Faulk responded by rushing for 1,282 yards, 11 touchdowns, and one receiving touchdown. The Colts improved to 8–8. Marshall Faulk, later that season, would become the first NFL player to win both the Offensive Rookie of the Year Award and the Pro Bowl&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award in the same season. He was also the first rookie to win Pro Bowl MVP.

The next season Faulk rushed for 1,078 yards and 14 total touchdowns. The Colts made the postseason, going 9–7, and narrowly missed the Super Bowl after a close loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game, which Faulk missed due to a nagging toe injury.

The next year was a miserable one for Faulk. Because of a toe injury he suffered earlier in the season, he rushed for only 587 yards, with a 3 yards-per-carry average. He led the Colts in yards from scrimmage with 1,015. He recovered from the injury and rushed for 1,000+ yards in each of the next two seasons, setting a new personal high with 1,319 in 1998. He also caught 86 passes for 906 yards that year (playing alongside rookie quarterback Peyton Manning) and was the NFL&#x27;s leader in total yards from scrimmage with 2,227, beating out Denver&#x27;s MVP running back Terrell Davis by 2 yards, while also finishing 4th in the league in receptions. It would also be the first of an NFL-record 4 consecutive 2,000+ total-yard seasons.

===St. Louis Rams (1999–2006)===
Faulk was traded to the St. Louis Rams the following season for second- and fifth-round picks in the upcoming draft (which the Colts used to draft LB Mike Peterson and DE Brad Scioli). The Colts moved on at the position, drafting Edgerrin James in the first round. Faulk held out for 12 days as the details of his contract were worked out. On August 4, 1999, Faulk signed a seven-year, $45.2 million contract with the Rams, which was the biggest deal in team history at the time. In it, Faulk was guaranteed $9.6 million including a $7-million signing bonus. The problem in negotiations was the proposed fifth year, in which Faulk would get $7 million in salary and a $5-million roster bonus. The deal was structured to prevent Faulk from ever being tagged a transition or franchise player.

In his first year in St. Louis, Faulk was the catalyst for &quot;The Greatest Show on Turf&quot;, a nickname given to coordinator Mike Martz&#x27;s aggressive Coryell-style offense. In this offense, he put up some of the best all-purpose numbers in the history of the NFL. Faulk&#x27;s patience and diligence in learning the Rams&#x27; offense paid off when he totaled an NFL record 2,429 yards from scrimmage, eclipsing Barry Sanders&#x27;s record of 2,358 yards set in 1997 (Faulk&#x27;s mark has since been broken by Chris Johnson in 2009). With 1,381 yards rushing (5.5 yards-per-carry average), 1,048 receiving yards, and scoring 12 touchdowns, Faulk joined Roger Craig as the only men at that time to total 1,000+ yards in each category in a season. He also broke the NFL season record for most receiving yards by a running back, previously held by Lionel James. The Rams went on to win Super Bowl XXXIV. In the game, Faulk was contained on the ground by Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher&#x27;s defensive scheme, limiting him to just 17 rushing yards. This was perhaps due to the Titans&#x27; inability to stop the Rams&#x27; passing game, of which Faulk was a major part, recording 5 receptions for 90 yards. His 90 receiving yards were the second-highest total by a running back in Super Bowl history. At the end of the season, he received the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award and was a starter for the NFC squad in the 1999 Pro Bowl.

The following year, Faulk became the first running back in NFL history to lead his team in receptions five separate seasons (three in Indianapolis and twice in St. Louis). In addition, he was the NFL MVP and again the Offensive Player of the Year in 2000. He had 1,359 yards rushing in 14 games and set a new NFL record with 26 total touchdowns, (a record that would soon be broken by Priest Holmes and then later by Shaun Alexander and LaDainian Tomlinson), despite missing two games due to injury. He also averaged 5+ yards per carry again, this time with 5.4. The Rams, however, were not able to replicate the record they had the year prior. Even with the offense scoring the most points and yards during &quot;The Greatest Show on Turf&quot; era, the defense gave up 470 points.

The Rams returned to the Super Bowl the next year as their defense returned to form, allowing only 273 points, and the offense once again scored over 500 points, with 503. St. Louis lost on a late Adam Vinatieri field goal, 20–17, as Faulk totaled 76 rushing yards and 54 receiving yards. Faulk had another excellent season, rushing 260 times for a career-high 1,382 yards (5.3 yards per carry), and catching 83 passes for 765 yards, for an NFC-leading total of 2,147 yards from scrimmage (second in the NFL only to Priest Holmes, who totaled 2,169 yards) and scoring 21 touchdowns despite once again missing 2 games to injuries. Faulk won, for the third year in a row, the NFL&#x27;s Offensive Player of the Year award, but finished second in a close vote to teammate Kurt Warner in the MVP vote. These years would be the climax of Faulk&#x27;s career.
Faulk&#x27;s injuries and age would soon catch up to him; 2001 was the last of his 1,000-yard rushing seasons, and though he was still employed as the Rams&#x27; primary running back following the 2001 season, he was no longer the player he was in his prime, despite remaining a respected and effective player.

On July 29, 2002, Faulk signed a new seven-year, $43.95 million contract with the Rams. Faulk was about to enter the fourth year of his 1999 contract. In this new contract Faulk received a $10.7 million signing bonus. In the 2002 season the Rams struggled and finished the year at 7–9. Faulk played in 14 games and started 10 and ended with 953 yards and 80 receptions. The following season, he played in and started 11 games, finishing with 818 yards and 45 receptions as the Rams rebounded with a 12–4 record.

In 2004, Faulk split time with rookie Steven Jackson and played in 14 games and rushing for 774 yards. In February 2005, Faulk agreed to a restructured contract to reduce his contract cap number. He was scheduled to make about $7.5 million in 2005. With the new contract he received a total of $6 million in the next two seasons and a $2 million signing bonus was included. The 2005 season was Faulk&#x27;s last in the NFL. He rushed for only 292 yards on 65 carries and caught 44 passes for 291 yards and one touchdown. This marked the only time in his career where he did not have a rushing touchdown.

===Injuries and retirement===
On July 21, the Rams announced that Faulk would undergo reconstructive knee surgery and miss the entire 2006 NFL season. During the season Faulk served as an analyst for the NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;NFL Total Access&quot;.

During an NBC Sunday Night Football halftime show, Faulk was asked by one of the announcers, &quot;So are you retired or not?&quot; Faulk said that he was still a Ram, and would be a Ram for the rest of his life. He then said that if the Rams would have him back, he would play next year, as he was able to run full speed on his re-built knees, but on March 26, 2007, Faulk announced his retirement from football.

On November 29, 2007, the Rams announced that they would be retiring Faulk&#x27;s number. The ceremony was held during halftime of a Thursday night game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on December 20, 2007. In 2010 on the NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;The Top 100: NFL&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot;, Faulk was voted the number 70 player of all time.

In 2011, Faulk&#x27;s first year of eligibility, he was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. As a running back, he placed first in receiving yards (6,875), second in pass receptions (767), second in receiving touchdowns (36), third in yards from scrimmage (19,154), and tenth in rushing yards (12,280).

<doc id="635377" wikidata="Q5988282" url="?curid=635377" title="Identity Cards Act 2006">
<text>The Identity Cards Act 2006 (c. 15) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that was repealed in 2011. It created National Identity Cards, a personal identification document and European Economic Area travel document, which were voluntarily issued to British citizens. It also created a resident registry database known as the National Identity Register (NIR), which has since been destroyed. In all around 15,000 National Identity Cards were issued until the act was repealed in 2011. The Identity Card for Foreign nationals was continued in the form of Biometric Residence Permits after 2011 under the provisions of the UK Borders Act 2007 and the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

The introduction of the scheme by the Labour government was much debated, and civil liberty concerns focused primarily on the database underlying the identity cards rather than the cards themselves. The Act specified fifty categories of information that the National Identity Register could hold on each citizen. The legislation further said that those renewing or applying for passports must be entered on to the NIR.

The Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition formed following the 2010 general election announced that the ID card scheme would be scrapped. The Identity Cards Act was repealed by the Identity Documents Act 2010 on 21 January 2011, and the cards were invalidated with no refunds to purchasers.

The UK does not have a central civilian registry and there are no identification requirements in public. Driving licences, passports and birth certificates are the most widely used documents for proving identity in the United Kingdom. Most young non-drivers are able to be issued a provisional driving licence, which can be used as ID in some cases, but not all are eligible. Utility bills are the primary document used as evidence of residency. However, authorities and police may require individuals under suspicion without identification to be arrested.
==Development==
===Reasons given for the need for introduction===
Initial attempts to introduce a voluntary identity card were made under the Conservative government of John Major, under then Home Secretary Michael Howard. At the Labour Party conference in 1995, Tony Blair demanded that &quot;instead of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on compulsory ID cards as the Tory Right demand, let that money provide thousands more police officers on the beat in our local communities.&quot; It was included in the Conservative election manifesto for the 1997 general election, in which Labour returned to office.

A proposal for ID cards, to be called &quot;entitlement cards&quot;, was initially revived by the Home Secretary at the time, David Blunkett, following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, but was reportedly opposed by Cabinet colleagues. However, rising concerns about identity theft and the misuse of public services led to a proposal in February 2002 for the introduction of entitlement cards to be used to obtain social security services, and a consultation paper, &quot;Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud&quot;, was published by the Home Office on 3 July 2002. A public consultation process followed, which resulted in a majority of submissions by organisations being in favour of a scheme to verify a person&#x27;s identity accurately. However, it was clear that the ability to properly identify a person to their true identity was central to the proposal&#x27;s operation, with wider implications for operations against crime and terrorism.

In 2003, Blunkett announced that the Government intended to introduce a &quot;British national identity card&quot; linked to a national identity database, the National Identity Register. The proposals were included in the November 2003 Queen&#x27;s Speech, despite doubts over the ability of the scheme to prevent terrorism. Feedback from the consultation exercise indicated that the term &quot;entitlement card&quot; was superficially softer and warmer, but less familiar and &quot;weaselly&quot;, and consequently the euphemism was dropped in favour of &quot;identity card&quot;.

During a private seminar for the Fabian Society in August 2005, Tony McNulty, the minister in charge of the scheme, stated &quot;perhaps in the past the government, in its enthusiasm, oversold the advantages of identity cards&quot;, and that they &quot;did suggest, or at least implied, that they might well be a panacea for identity fraud, for benefit fraud, terrorism, entitlement and access to public services&quot;. He suggested that they should be seen as &quot;a gold standard in proving your identity&quot;. Documentation released by the Home Office demonstrated analysis conducted with the private and public sector showed the benefits of the proposed identity card scheme could be quantified at £650m to £1.1bn a year, with a number of other, less quantifiable, strategic benefits — such as disrupting the activities of organised crime and terrorist groups.

===Legislative progress===
The Identity Cards Bill was included in the Queen&#x27;s Speech on 23 November 2004, and introduced to the House of Commons on 29 November.

It was first voted on by Members of Parliament following the second reading of the bill on 20 December 2004, where it passed by 385 votes to 93. The bill was opposed by 19 Labour MPs, 10 Conservative MPs, and the Liberal Democrats, while a number of Labour and Conservative members abstained, in defiance of party policies. A separate vote on a proposal to reject the Bill was defeated by 306 votes to 93. Charles Clarke, the new Home Secretary, had earlier rejected calls to postpone the reading of the Bill following his recent appointment.

The third reading of the bill in the Commons was approved on 11 February 2005 by 224 votes to 64; a majority of 160. Although being in favour in principle, the Conservatives officially abstained, but 11 of their MPs joined 19 Labour MPs in voting against the Government. The Bill then passed to the House of Lords, but there was insufficient time to debate the matter, and Labour were unable to do a deal with the Conservatives in the short time available in the days before Parliament was dissolved on 11 April, following the announcement of the 2005 general election.

Labour&#x27;s manifesto for the 2005 general election stated that, if returned to power, they would &quot;introduce ID cards, including biometric data like fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out initially on a voluntary basis as people renew their passports&quot;. In public speeches and on the campaign trail, Labour made clear that they would bring the same Bill back to Parliament. In contrast, the Liberal Democrat manifesto opposed the idea because, they claimed, ID cards &quot;don&#x27;t work&quot;, while the Conservatives made no mention of the issue.

====After the 2005 election====
Following their 2005 general election victory, the Labour Government introduced a new Identity Cards Bill, substantially the same as the previous Bill, into the Commons on 25 May. The Conservatives joined the Liberal Democrats in opposing the Bill, saying that it did not pass their &quot;five tests&quot;. These tests included confidence that the scheme could be made to work, and its impact on civil liberties. In December 2005, the Conservative Party elected a new leader, future Prime Minister David Cameron, who opposed ID cards in principle.

The second reading of the Bill on 28 June was passed, 314 votes to 283, a majority of 31.

At its third reading in the Commons on 18 October, the majority in favour fell to 25, with 309 votes in favour to 284 against. In the report stage between the readings, the Bill was amended to prevent the National Identity Register database being linked to the Police National Computer.

In early 2006, the Bill was passed through the House of Lords committee stage, where 279 amendments were considered. One outcome of this was a vote demanding that the Government instruct the National Audit Office to provide a full costing of the scheme over its first ten years, and another demanding that a &quot;secure and reliable method&quot; of recording and storing the data should be found. A third defeat limited the potential for ID cards to be required before people could access public services. On 23 January, the House of Lords defeated the government by backing a fully voluntary scheme.

The committee stage ended on 30 January, and the third reading of the Bill took place on 6 February, after which it returned to the Commons. There, on 18 February, the legislation was carried by a majority of 25, with 25 Labour MPs joining those opposing it. Following the defeats in the House of Lords, the government changed the Bill in order to require separate legislation to make the cards compulsory; however, an amendment to make it possible to apply for a biometric passport without having to register on the National Identity Register database was defeated, overturning the Lords&#x27; changes to make the Bill fully voluntary. The Lords&#x27; amendment requiring a National Audit Office report was rejected.

The Bill returned to the Lords on 6 March, where the Commons amendments were reversed by a majority of 61. The defeat came despite ministers warning that the Lords should follow the Salisbury Convention by refraining from blocking a manifesto commitment. Both Conservatives and Liberal Democrats stated generally in 2005 that they no longer felt bound to abide by the convention, while in this specific case several Lords stated that it would not apply as the manifesto commitment was for implementation on a voluntary basis as passports are renewed, rather than being compulsory as passports are renewed.

Subsequent votes:
*13 March: House of Commons — majority of 33 for Government (310 to 277)
*15 March: House of Lords — majority of 35 against Government (218 to 183)
*16 March: House of Commons — majority of 51 for Government (292 to 241)
*20 March: House of Lords — majority of 36 against Government (211 to 175)
*21 March: House of Commons — majority of 43 for Government (284 to 241)

On 29 March, the House of Lords voted in favour of a new plan with a majority of 227 (287 to 60). Under this scheme, everyone renewing a passport from 2008 would be entered on the national passport and ID database. The Government said that from the identity card&#x27;s introduction in 2010, people could voluntarily apply for a card, though they would still have to pay for one, and would be placed on the passport and ID database.

The Bill received Royal assent on 30 March 2006.

===Timescale and implementation progress===
On 11 October 2006, the Labour government announced a timescale described as &quot;highly ambitious&quot; by computer experts. The Home Office announced that it would publish an ID management action plan in the months from November 2006, followed by agreements with departments on their uses for the system. There was to be a report on potential private sector uses for the scheme before the 2007 Budget.

On 25 September 2006, Home Office Minister Liam Byrne said that &quot;There are opportunities which give me optimism to think that actually there is a way of exploiting systems already in place in a way which brings down the costs quite substantially&quot;.

Emails leaked in June 2006 indicated that the plan was already in difficulty, with plans for the early introduction of a limited register and ID card with reduced biometrics known as the &quot;early variant&quot; described as a &quot;huge risk&quot;.

Due to the costs of developing a new system from scratch, in 2007, the Government approved an alternative plan to use the Department for Work and Pensions Customer Information System to store the biographical information, linked to a new database to store biometrics, despite concerns over issues of inter-departmental governance, funding and accountability which were never resolved.

The schedule for putting passport applicants&#x27; and renewers&#x27; details on the National Identity Register (NIR) was never announced. A nationwide network of 68 interview offices for first-time passport applicants started opening in June 2007 and was subsequently completed. The interview consisted mainly of asking applicants to confirm facts about themselves, which someone attempting to steal their identity may not know. The government stated that all personal information used in the interview not required for the application was destroyed shortly after the passport was issued. Fingerprints were not taken. Plans to take iris scans were dropped, although the Government had not ruled them out as a future option.

In March 2008, the Home Secretary announced that people could choose to have an identity card, a passport, or both when they became available (although they could not opt out of having their details recorded on the NIR). On 25 November 2008, people making applications to remain in the United Kingdom as a student or based on marriage were required to have an identity card. Under those plans, it was estimated that by the end of 2014–15 about 90% of all foreign nationals would have been issued with one. On 22 January 2008, the Home Office confirmed that large numbers of cards would not be issued until 2012; however, ID cards were issued to workers in critical locations, starting with airside workers in Manchester and London City airports in 2009, and young people were being offered cards in 2010.

A leaked document, published on 29 January 2008, suggested that &quot;universal compulsion should not be used unless absolutely necessary... due the need for inevitably controversial and time-consuming primary legislation&quot; but that &quot;various forms of coercion, such as designation of the application process for identity documents issued by British ministers (e.g. passports) were an option to stimulate applications in a manageable way&quot;.

In January 2008, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that Accenture and BAE Systems had withdrawn from the procurement process. Fujitsu Services, CSC, EDS, IBM, Steria and Thales Group were still negotiating framework agreements with the government. On 1 August 2008, it was confirmed that Thales Group was awarded a four-year contract to work on the design, building, testing and operation of the National Identity Scheme.

On 25 September 2008, Jacqui Smith unveiled replicas of the first actual cards to be issued as residence permits to foreign nationals.

The first to receive ID cards were foreign nationals, from 25 November 2008. This scheme continued as the Biometric Residence Permit.

National Identity Cards for British nationals became voluntarily available to people resident in the Greater Manchester area on 30 November 2009. Availability was planned to be expanded to all British Citizens on a voluntary basis by 2012. A Home Office minister, Meg Hillier, said that they would be a &quot;convenient way for young people to prove their age when going to bars&quot; and at £30 they were cheaper than purchasing passports (£77.50 at the time).

Although in later rollout stages, it was envisioned that retailers could accept applications and be able to charge processing fees; the total cost to applicants was expected to be up to £60 per card.

In December 2009, while on a trip to promote identity cards, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Identity Meg Hillier had to admit she had forgotten hers and was left unable to display one for photographers. The &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; revealed in 2010 that senior Whitehall officials were urged to email friends and relatives encouraging them to buy cards, because of fears about the level of demand.

=== Identity card for foreign nationals (Biometric Residence Permit) ===
Originally called the &quot;Identity Card for Foreign Nationals&quot; which was blue and pink in colour, was continued and renamed the Biometric Residence Permit, still issued as of 2024. It followed the common EU format until the UK&#x27;s exit from the European Union.

Their issuance began in November 2008 when non-European Union foreign nationals with permission to stay in the UK on the basis of a student visa or a marriage/civil partnership visa would, when applying to extend their stay, be required to apply for an ID card. This was later expanded to all non-EU residents.

===Initial rollout===

The initial rollout began on a regional basis, first in Greater Manchester. The cards were voluntary and cost £30 and were issued by the Identity and Passport Service, until its eventual cancellation. 
* October 2009: Greater Manchester residents – applications opened to all residents of Greater Manchester 
* November 2009: Air industry staff – a pilot scheme involving free, voluntary ID cards for airside workers at Manchester and London City airports.
* January 2010: North West England - applications opened to residents in Cheshire, Merseyside, Lancashire and Cumbria
* February 2010: Young London residents – applications opened to all residents of London aged 16–24 who already had a passport or a recently expired one.
* February 2010: Citizens over the age of 16 if registered for IPS newsletter updates – 21,000 people were registered for updates at the time

==== Planned wider rollout ====
* Young people opening bank accounts (voluntary) – in 2010, young people would have been encouraged to get ID cards when they opened bank accounts.
* Citizens over the age of 16 applying for a passport (voluntary) intended in 2011–2012, optional, but applicants&#x27; details would have been entered into the National Identity Register

===2010 general election===
During the 2010 general election campaign, the published manifestos of the various parties revealed that the Labour Party planned to continue the introduction of the identity card scheme, while all other parties pledged to discontinue plans to issue ID cards. The Conservative Party also explicitly pledged to scrap the National Identity Register, while the wording of several other manifestos implied that this may have been the position of certain other parties too.

===Ending of the scheme===

In the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement that followed the 2010 general election, the new government announced that they planned to scrap the ID card scheme, including the National Identity Register (as well as the next generation of biometric passports and the ContactPoint database), as part of their measures &quot;to reverse the substantial erosion of civil liberties under the Labour Government and roll back state intrusion.&quot;

In a document published in May 2010 at the time of the Queen&#x27;s Speech, the new Government announced that the scrapping of the scheme would save approximately £86 million over the following 4 years, and avoid a further £800 million in maintenance costs over the decade which were to have been recovered through fees.

The Identity Documents Act 2010 was announced on 27 May 2010, passed by the House of Commons on 15 September 2010 and received Royal Assent on 21 December 2010. Section 1(1) of the Identity Documents Act repealed the Identity Cards Act 2006 on 21 January 2011 (making ID cards invalid) and mandated the destruction of all data on the National Identity Register by 21 February 2011.

In May 2010 the Identity and Passport service stopped accepting applications for identity cards. On 21 January 2011, identity cards already issued became invalid, despite the cards themselves stating a 10-year expiry.

In all around 15,000 National Identity Cards were issued until the act was repealed in 2011. A banker from Germany with joint British and Swiss nationality was arguably the last person to officially use the ID card on a flight from Düsseldorf to Manchester on 21 January 2011, landing 90 minutes before the scheme was officially scrapped at midnight. No refunds were offered to cardholders who paid £30 for the card.

The National Identity Register was officially destroyed on Thursday, 10 February 2011, when the final 500 hard drives containing the register were shredded at RDC in Witham, Essex.

Some aspects of the original Identity Cards Act were continued including biometric British passports as well as the &quot;Identity Card for Foreign Nationals&quot;, which were renamed and continued as Biometric Residence Permits (BRP). The new Identity Documents Act 2010 allows private companies to issue proof of age cards, under the PASS scheme. PASS scheme cards are not usable as identification in most circumstances except for purchasing age-restricted items.

==Historical and international comparisons==

===ID cards during the World Wars===

Compulsory identity cards were first issued in the United Kingdom during World War I, and abandoned in 1919. Cards were re-introduced during World War II under the National Registration Act 1939, but were abandoned seven years after the end of that war, in 1952, amid widespread public resentment. The National Register became the National Health Service Register and is maintained to this day. Wartime alphanumeric identity numbers continued to be used as NHS numbers until 1996, when they were replaced by new fully numeric identifiers.

The World War I identity card scheme was unpopular, though accepted in the light of the prevailing national emergency. It is possible to take a small measure of how the national identity scheme was received from remarks by the historian A. J. P. Taylor in his &quot;English History, 1914–1945&quot;, where he describes the whole thing as an &quot;indignity&quot; and talks of the Home Guard &quot;harassing&quot; people for their cards.

After the Second World War the government of Clement Attlee decided to continue the scheme in the face of the Cold War and the perceived Soviet threat, though it grew ever less popular. Identity cards also became the subject of a celebrated civil liberties case in 1950. Harry Willcock, a member of the Liberal Party, refused to produce his after being stopped by the police. During his subsequent trial he argued that identity cards had no place in peacetime, a defence rejected by the magistrate&#x27;s court. In his subsequent appeal, &quot;Willcock v Muckle&quot;, the judgment of the lower court was upheld.

Protest reached Parliament, where the Conservative and Liberal peers voiced their anger over what they saw as &quot;Socialist card-indexing&quot;. After the defeat of the Labour Government in the general election of October 1951 the incoming Conservative administration of Winston Churchill was pledged to get rid of the scheme, &quot;to set the people free&quot;, in the words of one minister. Cheers rang out when on 21 February 1952 the Minister for Health, Harry Crookshank, announced in the House of Commons that national identity cards were to be scrapped. This was a popular move, adopted against the wishes of the police and the security services, though the decision to repeal the 1939 legislation was, in significant part, driven by the need for economies. By 1952 national registration was costing £500,000 per annum (about ) and required 1500 civil servants to administer it.

===International comparisons===

====Identity cards====
Generally, most countries in the world issue identity cards, with the exception generally being countries in the anglosphere. For example, Australia started work on a health and social services access card, but the government elected in the 2007 federal election cancelled it. However an exception is the US passport card is issued with similar properties to an identity card.

Identity cards are issued in every EU/EEA country except for Denmark and Ireland. However, since 2015, Ireland issues a passport card with similar properties to an identity card and Danish municipalities issue simpler identity cards (which are not valid for international travel). They are compulsory in 14 EU countries, voluntary in 9 countries and in 8 countries they are semi-compulsory (some form of identification required). They can be used to travel within the EU/EEA.

During the British Presidency of the EU in 2005, a decision was made to &quot;agree common standards for security features and secure issuing procedures for ID cards (December 2005), with detailed standards agreed as soon as possible thereafter. In this respect, the British Presidency has put forward a proposal for EU-wide use of biometrics in national ID cards.&quot; In 2019, a harmonised model for identity cards in the EU was adopted and was in force in 2021, introducing biometric functionality and a standardised format.

====Biometrics in identity and travel documents====
There has been an international move towards the introduction of biometrics into identity and travel documents. The ICAO has recommended that all countries adopt biometric passports, and the United States has made it a requirement for entering the US under the visa waiver programme. Biometric passports are issued in many countries, including in British passports. Internationally, the only requirement for biometric passports is a digital photograph.

==System==

===Legal requirements===

Under the NIS, residents who wanted or were required to apply for an ID card would have been required to fulfil certain functions:

*Attend in person to have their fingerprints recorded at one of the Identity &amp; Passport Service&#x27;s high street partners.
*Promptly inform the police or Identity &amp; Passport Service if a card is lost or damaged, and apply for a new card.
*Promptly inform the Identity &amp; Passport Service of any change of address.
*Promptly inform the Identity &amp; Passport Service of any prescribed change of circumstances affecting the information recorded about them in the Register.

Failure to do so would have meant a penalty of up to £1,000 or a shortened permission to stay.

===National Identity Register===
Key to the ID Card scheme was a centralised computer database, the National Identity Register (NIR). To identify someone it would not have been necessary to check their card, since identity could be determined by a taking a biometric scan and matching it against a database entry.

ID cards for foreign nationals were produced by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in Swansea on behalf of the Home Office.

===Identity Registration Number===
One entry on the NIR was the Identity Registration Number. The Home Office had recognised that a unique identifier was needed as a primary key for the database.

The Home Office&#x27;s Identity Cards Benefits Overview document described how the IRN would have enabled data sharing amongst police, legal and corporate databases (including bank and travel operators).

===Types of cards===
Three types of identity cards were issued:

* The &quot;National Identity Card&quot;, which was lilac and salmon in colour, was issued to British citizens only. It contained the text &quot;British Citizen&quot; and was a valid travel document for entry into any EEA state and Switzerland until its invalidation in 2010.
* The &quot;Identification Card&quot; was turquoise and green in colour and did not mention the holder&#x27;s nationality. It was issued to EU, EEA and Swiss citizens living in the UK (including Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland). It was also issued to certain family members of EU/EEA citizens, to British citizens to whom certain conditions or restrictions apply, and as an additional card to a person living in two gender roles.
* The &quot;Identity Card for Foreign Nationals&quot; was blue and pink in colour and was issued to certain categories of immigrants from non-EU/EEA countries. They were renamed and continued in the form of Biometric Residence Permits.

==Use as travel document==
Until midnight on 21 January 2011, the National Identity Card was officially recognised as a valid travel document by the EEA and Switzerland, following which the United Kingdom instructed immigration authorities therein to cease accepting it as a valid travel document. It also became accepted voluntarily by a number of other European countries but its current validity in these additional countries remains unclear, given that its acceptance and subsequent denial by these countries was never mandated by the United Kingdom through EU or EEA channels. It was the only travel document valid for use by British nationals throughout the EEA and Switzerland, other than a valid British citizen passport or a pink Gibraltar identity card. The exception to this was for travel to the Republic of Ireland. All British citizens are entitled to enter the Republic of Ireland without the need to carry a valid travel document, on account of the Common Travel Area agreement, though in practice, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service or Garda Síochána systematically require proof of identity from all travellers landing in Irish airports from the UK.

* European Union
* (EEA)
* (EEA)
* (EEA)

It became accepted also by:
* &quot;Any travel document recognised by France or Spain&quot;
* 
* 
* 
* (only for tours organised by a travel agency for groups of more than three people)
* 

It was also accepted as a travel document to enter the British Crown Dependencies and the British Overseas Territories:
* Part of EU
* Part of Common Travel Area — no travel document required to enter from the UK. (NB: Air travellers require photo ID for airline security purposes.)
* Part of Common Travel Area — no travel document required to enter from the UK. (NB: Air travellers require photo ID for airline security purposes.)
* Part of Common Travel Area — no travel document required to enter from the UK. (NB: Air travellers require photo ID for airline security purposes.)
All other overseas territories require a fully valid passport. Of the two countries closest to the UK not to accept British ID cards, Ukraine and Belarus, the latter requires not only a passport but also for British citizens to obtain a visa in advance (except if entering and exiting through Minsk airport and staying for max 5 days).

Initially, some travel companies initially refused to carry passengers with UK National Identity Cards due to their novelty.

==Reaction==

The announcement of the scheme had seen a mixed reaction from both the public and from figures connected to terrorism and law enforcement.

===Public reaction===
Over a period of time, public opinion, as measured by opinion polls, appears to have shifted away from support for the scheme towards opposition. This appeared to have become more of a concern since the disclosure of the loss of 25 million records by HM Revenue and Customs.

In 2003, the announcement of the scheme was followed by a public consultation exercise, particularly among &#x27;stakeholder groups&#x27;. At March 2003 the government stated that the overall results were:

:in favour: 2606 responses (61%)
:against: 1587 responses (38%)
:neutral: 48 responses (1%)

By July 2006, an ICM poll indicated that public support had fallen to 46%, with opposition at 51%.

A further poll by YouGov/Daily Telegraph, published on 4 December 2006, indicated support for the identity card element of the scheme at 50%, with 39% opposed. Support for the national database was weaker, with 22% happy and 78% unhappy with the prospect of having their data recorded. Only 11% trusted the government to keep the data confidential. 3.12% of the sample were prepared to undergo long prison sentences rather than have a card.

===Terrorism and crime===
Eliza Manningham-Buller, the former head of Britain&#x27;s counter-intelligence and security agency MI5 was on record as supporting the introduction of identity cards, as was Sir Ian Blair, former Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and his predecessor, Sir John (now Lord) Stevens. The Association of Chief Police Officers was also supportive.

However, in November 2005, Dame Stella Rimington, who was Director General of MI5 before Eliza Manningham-Buller, questioned the usefulness of the proposed scheme.
This intervention caused a good deal of controversy amongst supporters and opponents of the scheme, especially as Manningham-Buller stated that ID cards would in fact disrupt the activities of terrorists, noting that significant numbers of terrorists take advantage of the weaknesses of current identification methods to assist their activities.

Lord Carlile was appointed after 11 September attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 to independently review the working of the Terrorism Act 2000 and subsequent anti-terrorist laws. Talking on GMTV on 29 January 2006, he expressed his views on the proposed legislation, saying that ID cards could be of limited value in the fight against terrorism but that Parliament had to judge that value against the curtailment of civil liberties. Speaking on the same programme, Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, former Met Police Commissioner, argued in favour for the need for identity cards, saying they had benefits in tackling serious crimes, such as money laundering and identity theft.

==Objections to the scheme==

===Costs===
By the time the Act was repealed, the Home Office stated that £257 million had been spent specifically on implementing identity cards.

The estimated combined 10-year cost of the biometric passport and identity scheme was £5.612bn in November 2007. Much of the cost involved was due to the introduction and production of biometric passports, which became standard worldwide and British passports continued to be issued biometrically. Up to 70% of the total cost was due to biometric passport issuances.

Independent studies including one by the London School of Economics had forecasted that total costs of implementing the biometric identity and passport scheme could be as much as £10.6 billion to £19.2 billion, with an estimated £814 million to £1,200 million from costs directly attributed to ID card issuance. The reliability of this study was challenged by the Labour Government which disputed some of the assumptions used in the calculations, such as the need to retake biometric information every 5 years. The government argued that this assumption had not been supported by any research in the London School of Economics report, and that biometric experts quoted in the LSE reports had sought to distance themselves from its findings. The Government also claimed that the authors of these estimates were established opponents to the scheme and could not be considered unbiased academic sources.

Tony McNulty, Home Office minister who was responsible for the scheme, responded by saying a &quot;ceiling&quot; on costs would be announced in October 2005. There were indications that the Labour Government was looking at ways of subsidising the scheme by charging other Government Departments, with the implication that this would result in increased charges for other Government services to individuals or businesses.

The Labour Government abandoned plans for a giant new computer system to run the national identity card scheme. Instead of a single multibillion-pound system, information was held on three existing, separate databases.

An estimate from the Home Office placed the cost of a passport and ID card package at £85, while after the 2005 general election in May 2005 they issued a revised figure of over £93, and announced that a standalone ID card would cost £30. In 2009, it was announced that retailers would be collecting fingerprints and photographs, and that they would be able to charge for this, meaning that the total cost for a standalone ID card was expected to be up to £60.

===Effectiveness===
The then Home Secretary David Blunkett stated in 2004 said the cards would stop people using multiple identities and boost the fight against terrorism and organised crime. However, human rights group Liberty disputed this, pointing out that the existence of another form of ID cards in Spain did not prevent the Madrid train bombings.

However, Blunkett subsequently made a significant U-turn. At his opening speech for Infosecurity Europe on 27 April 2009, he stepped back from the concept of a full National Identity Database for every citizen, saying it would be sufficient to improve the verification of passports.

His successor, Charles Clarke, said that ID cards &quot;cannot stop attacks&quot;, in the aftermath of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, and added that he doubted it would have prevented the atrocities. However, he felt that on the balance between protecting civil liberties and preventing crime, ID cards would help rather than hinder.

===Ethnic minorities===
The Government&#x27;s Race Equality Impact Assessment indicated significant concern among ethnic groups over how the police would use their powers under an Identity Cards Act 2006, with 64% of black and 53% of Indian respondents having expressed concern, particularly about the potential for abuse and discrimination. In their January 2005 report on the Bill, the Commission for Racial Equality stated that the fear of discrimination is neither misconceived nor exaggerated, and note that this is also an ongoing issue in Germany, the Netherlands and France.

The CRE were also concerned that disproportionate requirements by employers and the authorities for ethnic minorities to identify themselves may lead to a two-tiered structure amongst racial groups, with foreign nationals and British ethnic minorities feeling compelled to register while British white people do not.

According to the CRE, certain groups who move location frequently and who tend to live on low incomes (such as Gypsies, travellers, asylum-seekers and refugees) would risk being criminalised under the legislation through failing to update their registration each time they moved due to lack of funds to pay the fee that may be charged.

===Concerns raised by the Information Commissioner===
In a press release on 30 July 2004, Richard Thomas the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office stated that
a NIR raised substantial data protection and personal privacy concerns. He sought clarification of why so much personal information needed to be kept as part of establishing an individual&#x27;s identity and indicated concern about the wide range of bodies who would view the records of services individuals have used. The Commissioner also pointed out that those who renew or apply for a driving licence or passport were to be automatically added to the National Identity Register, and so would lose the option of not registering. He subsequently stated: &quot;My anxiety is that we don&#x27;t sleepwalk into a surveillance society.&quot;
In February 2003, on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, he warned that ID cards could become a target for identity theft by organised crime.

===Human rights===
On 2 February 2005, the British Parliament&#x27;s Joint Committee on Human Rights questioned the compatibility of the Bill with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the right to respect for private life) and Article 14 (the right to non-discrimination), both of which are encapsulated in the Human Rights Act 1998.

===Feature creep===
Even without new primary legislation, the Identity Cards Act 2006 allowed the potential scope of the scheme to be much greater than that usually publicised by the Government.

For example, Gordon Brown was reported to be &quot;planning a massive expansion of the ID cards project that would widen surveillance of everyday life by allowing high-street businesses to share confidential information with police databases.&quot;
Francis Elliott reporting on the development for &quot;The Independent&quot; noted that &quot;police could be alerted as soon as a wanted person used a biometric-enabled cash card or even entered a building via an iris-scan door&quot;.

The wartime National Registration ID card expanded from 3 functions to 39 by the time it was abolished.

Concerns had also been raised following Tony Blair&#x27;s response to an ID card petition stating that the fingerprint register would be used to compare the fingerprints of the population at large against the records of 900,000 unsolved crimes. Opposition MPs claimed that the use of the biometric data in this way would directly breach promises given during the Commons debate that there would be adequate safeguards preventing the use of ID card data for &quot;fishing expeditions&quot;.

===Database extent and access===
Home Office forecasts envisaged that &quot;265 government departments and as many as 48,000 accredited private sector organisations&quot; would have had access to the database, and that 163 million identity verifications or more would take place each year.
However, the IPS had stated that only the data needed for the passport would have been kept and that organisations that have permission to access the data held on the Register could only have done so with the individual&#x27;s permission, unless to prevent or investigate a crime.

===Vulnerable individuals===
The CRE had also recommended that more work was required to protect the interests of vulnerable individuals. For example, people escaping from domestic violence or a forced marriage may have been at risk if their previous names or addresses were disclosed. Minister Meg Hillier, in a letter to &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine, claimed that as the ID card would not have someone&#x27;s address on it, it would protect such a person&#x27;s privacy in a way currently unavailable.

===Identity theft===
In May 2005, Tony Blair said &quot;ID cards are needed to stop the soaring costs of identity theft&quot;. However, security experts claimed that placing trust in a single document may make identity theft easier, since only this document needs to be targeted.

===Technology===
One test of facial recognition software dating from 2006 showed facial recognition error rates of up to 52% for disabled persons.

==Opposition campaigns==
In May 2006, NO2ID launched the &quot;Renew for Freedom&quot; campaign, urging passport holders to renew their passports in the summer of 2006 to delay being entered on the National Identity Register. This followed the comment made by Charles Clarke in the House of Commons that &quot;anyone who feels strongly enough about the linkage [between passports and the ID scheme] not to want to be issued with an ID card in the initial phase will be free to surrender their existing passport and apply for a new passport before the designation order takes effect&quot;.

In response, the Home Office said that it was &quot;hard to see what would be achieved, other than incurring unnecessary expense&quot; by renewing passports early. However, the cost of a non-biometric passport was £51 at the time, then increased in 2006 and 2007 to £72. This was due to rise to £93 after the introduction of biometric passports, which was inevitable due to increased document security requirements around the world. The US introduced a requirement for biometric passports to be used for entry from 2015 for Visa Waivier Program access.

On 14 November 2007, the NO2ID opposition group called for financial donations from the 11,360 people who had pledged to contribute to a fighting fund opposing the legislation. The organisation planned to challenge the statutory instruments that were planned to be brought in to enable the ID card scheme.

Baroness Williams and Nick Clegg said in 2007 that they would take part in civil disobedience campaigns by refusing to register for an ID card, or to attend photographic sittings, despite the cards being voluntary.

===Scotland===
Although policy on passports and the National Identity Scheme was not an area devolved to the Scottish Government, on 19 November 2008, the Scottish Parliament voted to reject the ID card scheme, with no votes against the government motion, and only the Scottish Labour MSPs abstaining. In 2005, the previous Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition government had stated that &quot;the proposals for an identity card scheme confine themselves to reserved policy areas only&quot;, and that ID cards will not be needed to access devolved services in Scotland, e.g. health, education, the legal system and transport. However the Scottish National Entitlement Card is required to obtain concessionary travel. It can also be used as Proof of Age for young people (Young Scot NEC) and give access to civic services such as libraries and leisure centres depending on the local authority.

===Northern Ireland===
The introduction of compulsory ID cards to Northern Ireland would likely have provoked serious opposition given the large Nationalist community who regard themselves as Irish and not British. In an effort to counter this, the British Government decided not to include the Union Flag on the card, and had stated that a separate card will be issued to Northern Irish people who identify their nationality as Irish. The separate card would not have included any statement of nationality and could not have been used as an EEA travel document (as only the Irish Government may issue travel documents for Irish citizens, wherever resident). Home Secretary Alan Johnson had also stated that the inclusion of Northern Irish people on the National Identity Register of British citizens would not have prevented such people from claiming full Irish citizenship rights.

<text>The Boeing B-50 Superfortress is an American strategic bomber. A post–World War II revision of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, it was fitted with more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 radial engines, stronger structure, a taller tail fin, and other improvements. It was the last piston-engined bomber built by Boeing for the United States Air Force, and was refined into Boeing&#x27;s final such design, the prototype B-54. Although not as well known as its direct predecessor, the B-50 was in USAF service for nearly 20 years.

After their primary service with Strategic Air Command (SAC) ended, B-50s were modified to serve as KB-50 aerial tankers for Tactical Air Command (TAC) and WB-50 weather reconnaissance aircraft for the Air Weather Service. These tanker and hurricane-hunter variants were retired in March 1965 after metal fatigue and corrosion were found in the wreckage of a KB-50J, &quot;48-065&quot;, that crashed on 14 October 1964.

==Design and development==
Development of an improved B-29 started in 1944, with the desire to replace the unreliable Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone engines with the more powerful four-row, 28-cylinder Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major radial engines, America&#x27;s largest-ever displacement aircraft piston engine in large-scale production. A B-29A-5-BN (serial number &quot;42-93845&quot;) was modified by Pratt &amp; Whitney as a testbed for the installation of the R-4360 in the B-29, with four R-4360-33s replacing the R-3350s. The modified aircraft, designated &quot;XB-44 Superfortress&quot;, first flew in May 1945.

The planned Wasp-Major powered bomber, the B-29D, was to incorporate considerable changes in addition to the engine installation tested in the XB-44. The use of a new alloy of aluminum, 75-S rather than the existing 24ST, gave a wing that was both stronger and lighter, while the undercarriage was strengthened to allow the aircraft to operate at weights of up to greater than the B-29. A larger vertical fin and rudder (which could fold to allow the aircraft to fit into existing hangars) and enlarged flaps were provided to deal with the increased engine power and weight, respectively.

Armament was similar to that of the B-29, with two bomb bays carrying of bombs, and a further externally. Defensive armament was 13 × 12.7mm (.50 BMG) machine guns (or 12 machine guns and one cannon) in five turrets.

First flying in May 1945, the sole XB-44 proved faster than the standard B-29, although existing sources do not indicate how much of this increased speed was due to differing aircraft weight due to deleted armament or increased power due to the R-4360-33 engines.

An order for 200 B-29Ds was placed in July 1945, but the ending of World War II in August 1945 prompted mass cancellations of outstanding orders for military equipment, with over 5,000 B-29s canceled in September 1945. In December that year, B-29D orders were cut from 200 to 60, while at the same time the designation of the aircraft was changed to &quot;B-50&quot;.

Officially, the aircraft&#x27;s new designation was justified by the changes incorporated into the revised aircraft, but according to Peter M. Bowers, a long-time Boeing employee and aircraft designer and a well-known authority on Boeing aircraft, &quot;the re-designation was an outright military ruse to win appropriations for the procurement of an airplane that by its B-29D designation appeared to be merely a later version of an existing model that was being canceled wholesale, with many existing examples being put into dead storage.&quot;

The first production B-50A (there were no prototypes, as the aircraft&#x27;s engines and new tail had already been tested) made its maiden flight on 25 June 1947. 78 more B-50As followed. The last airframe of the initial order was held back for modification to the prototype YB-50C, a planned version to be powered by R-4360-43 turbo-compound engines. It was to have a longer fuselage, allowing the two small bomb bays of the B-29 and the B-50A to be replaced by a single large bomb bay, more suited to carrying large nuclear weapons. It would also have longer wings, which required additional outrigger wheels to stabilize the aircraft on the ground.

Orders for 43 B-54s, the planned production version of the YB-50C, were placed in 1948, but Curtis LeMay, commander of Strategic Air Command (SAC), deemed it inferior to the Convair B-36 Peacemaker and having little capacity for further improvement, while requiring an expensive redevelopment of air bases owing to the type&#x27;s undercarriage. The B-54 program was therefore canceled in April 1949, with work on the YB-50C being stopped before it was completed.

While the B-54 was canceled, production of less elaborate developments continued as a stopgap until jet bombers such as the Boeing B-47 and B-52 could enter service. Forty-five B-50Bs, fitted with lightweight fuel tanks and capable of operating at higher weights, were built, followed by 222 B-50Ds, capable of carrying underwing fuel tanks and distinguished by a one-piece plastic nose dome.

To give the Superfortress the range to reach the Soviet Union, B-50s were fitted to be refueled in flight. Most of the B-50As were fitted with the early &quot;looped hose&quot; refueling system, developed by the British company Flight Refuelling Limited, in which the receiving aircraft would use a grapple to catch a line trailed by the tanker aircraft (normally a Boeing KB-29) before hauling over the fuel line to allow transfer of fuel to begin. To replace this clumsy system, Boeing designed the &quot;flying boom&quot; method to refuel SAC&#x27;s bombers, with most B-50Ds being fitted with receptacles for flying boom refueling.

Revisions to the B-50 (from its predecessor B-29) increased top speed to just under . Changes included:
* More powerful engines
* Redesigned engine nacelles and engine mounts
* Enlarged vertical tail and rudder (to maintain adequate yaw control during engine-out conditions)
* Reinforced wing structure (required due to increased engine mass, larger gyroscopic forces from larger propellers, greater fuel load, and revised landing gear loading)
* Revised routing for engine gases (cooling, intake, exhaust and intercooler ducts; also oil lines)
* Upgraded remote turret fire-control equipment
* Landing gear strengthened and takeoff weight increased from to 
* Increased fuel capacity with underwing fuel tanks being added.
* Improvements to flight control systems (the B-29 was difficult to fly; with increased weights the B-50 would have been more so).
* Nose wheel steering rather than a castering nose wheel as on the B-29

The C-97 military transport was, in its 1944 prototype, essentially a large upper fuselage tube attached to a B-29 lower fuselage and wings, with an inverted figure-eight cross-section. In its production version it incorporated the key elements of the B-50 platform including, after the first 10 in production, the enlarged tailfin of the B-50. The B-29 and B-50 were phased out with introduction of the jet-powered B-47 Stratojet. The B-50 was nicknamed &quot;Andy Gump&quot;, because the redesigned engine nacelles reminded aircrew of the chinless newspaper comic character popular at the time.

==Operational history==


Boeing built 370 of the various B-50 models and variants between 1947 and 1953, the tanker and weather reconnaissance versions remaining in service until 1965.

The first B-50As were delivered in June 1948 to the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s 43d Bombardment Wing, based at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. The 2d Bombardment Wing at Chatham Air Force Base, Georgia also received B-50As; the 93d Bombardment Wing at Castle Air Force Base, California and the 509th Bombardment Wing at Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico received B-50Ds in 1949. The fifth and last SAC wing to receive B-50Ds was the 97th Bombardment Wing at Biggs Air Force Base, Texas in December 1950.

The mission of these wings was to be able to deliver atomic bombs on enemy targets.

B-50s from the 4925th Special Weapons Group of Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico dropped atomic bombs in a series of tests in Frenchman Flat, Nevada from 1951 to 1953.

The 301st Bombardment Wing at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida received some B-50As reassigned from Davis–Monthan in early 1951, but used them for non-operational training pending the delivery of B-47A Stratojets in June 1951. The B-50 was built as an interim strategic bomber to be replaced by the B-47 Stratojet, but delays to the Stratojet forced the B-50 to soldier on until well into the 1950s.

A strategic reconnaissance version of the B-50B, the RB-50 was developed in 1949 to replace the aging RB-29s used by SAC in its intelligence-gathering operations against the Soviet Union. Three different configurations were produced, which were later redesignated RB-50E, RB-50F, and RB-50G. The RB-50E was earmarked for photographic reconnaissance and observation missions; The RB-50F resembled the RB-50E but carried the SHORAN radar navigation system designed to conduct mapping, charting, and geodetic surveys, and the mission of the RB-50G was electronic reconnaissance. These aircraft were operated primarily by the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. RB-50Es were also operated by the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing as a replacement for RB-29 photographic reconnaissance aircraft flown over North Korea during the Korean War.

The vast northern borders of the Soviet Union were wide open in many places during the early Cold War years, with little defensive radar coverage and limited detection capability. RB-50 aircraft of the 55th SRW flew many sorties along the periphery and, where necessary, into the interior. Initially, there was little opposition from the Soviet forces as radar coverage was limited and, if the overflying aircraft were detected, the World War II-era Soviet fighters could not intercept the RB-50s at their high altitude.

The deployment of the MiG-15 interceptor in the early 1950s made these flights exceedingly hazardous, with several being shot down by Soviet air defenses and the wreckage being examined by intelligence personnel. RB-50 missions over Soviet territory ended by 1954, replaced by the RB-47 Stratojet intelligence aircraft that could fly higher at near-supersonic speed.

The B-47 Stratojet was manufactured in large numbers beginning in 1953 and eventually replaced the B-50Ds in SAC service; the last being retired in 1955. With its retirement from the nuclear-bomber mission, many B-50 airframes were converted to aerial refueling tankers.

The B-50, with more powerful engines than the KB-29s in use by Tactical Air Command (TAC), was much more suitable to refuel tactical jet fighter aircraft, such as the F-100 Super Sabre. As tankers, KB-50s had extensively reinforced outer wing panels, the necessary equipment to air-refuel simultaneously three fighter-type aircraft by the probe and drogue method, and removed defensive armament.

The first KB-50 flew in December 1955 and was accepted by the Air Force in January 1956. The tankers steadily entered the operational inventory of TAC supplanting TAC&#x27;s KB-29s. By the end of 1957, all of the command&#x27;s aerial refueling squadrons had their full complement of KB-50s. KB-50s, and later KB-50Js with two General Electric J47 jet engines were used by TAC, and also by USAFE and PACAF overseas as aerial tankers. Some were deployed to Thailand and flew refueling missions over Indochina in the early years of the Vietnam War until being retired in March 1965 due to metal fatigue and corrosion.

In addition to the aerial tanker conversion, the Air Weather Service by 1955 had worn out the WB-29s used for hurricane hunting and other weather reconnaissance missions. Thirty-six former SAC B-50Ds were stripped of their armament and equipped for long-range weather reconnaissance missions. The WB-50 could fly higher, faster and longer than the WB-29. However, between 1956 and 1960 it experienced 13 major operational accidents, six of them involving the loss of the entire crew, and 66 crew-member fatalities. After the weather reconnaissance fleet was grounded in May 1960 because of fuel leaks, plans were set in motion in 1962 to modify B-47 Stratojets being phased out of SAC to replace it in the role. The WB-50 had an important role during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when it monitored the weather around Cuba to plan photo-reconnaissance flights. The WB-50 was finally retired in 1965 due to metal fatigue and corrosion.

<doc id="635380" wikidata="Q852459" url="?curid=635380" title="Mulligan (games)">
<text>A mulligan is a second chance to perform an action, usually after the first chance went wrong through bad luck or a blunder. Its best-known use is in golf, whereby it refers to a player being allowed, only informally, to replay a stroke, although that is against the formal rules of golf. The term has also been applied to other sports, games, and fields generally. The origin of the term is unclear.

==Possible origin==
The earliest known use of the term is in a 1931 issue of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, somewhat predating the earliest citation in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; from 1936. The most common explanation of the term&#x27;s origin is that it was named after a golfer with the surname &quot;Mulligan&quot;, the main candidates being either David Mulligan or John A. &quot;Buddy&quot; Mulligan; however, no connection with these figures is recorded until several decades after the term entered common use. In 2017, Peter Reitan suggested that the term first arose in baseball sports writing and was associated with a fictional baseball player &quot;Swat Mulligan&quot;.

===Eponymous origin theories===
The United States Golf Association (USGA) cites three stories espousing that the term derived from the name of a Canadian golfer, David B. Mulligan (1869–1954). At one time, he was the manager of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. He played at the Country Club of Montreal golf course, in Saint-Lambert near Montreal during the 1920s. There are three variations in reports indicating his being the Mulligan associated with the term. One version has it that one day after hitting a poor tee shot, Mulligan immediately re-teed and shot again. He called it a &quot;correction shot&quot;, but his companions thought it more fitting to name the unorthodox practice after him, and that David Mulligan then brought the concept from Canada to Winged Foot, a golf club in the U.S. A second version has the extra shot allowed for Mulligan due to his being jumpy and shaky after a difficult drive over the Victoria Bridge to the course. The final version of the David Mulligan story gives him an extra shot after having overslept and having rushed to get ready to make the tee time.

An alternative, later story credits a different man named Mulligan – John A. &quot;Buddy&quot; Mulligan, a locker room attendant at Essex Fells Country Club in New Jersey. In the 1930s, he would finish cleaning the locker room and, if no other members appeared, play a round with the assistant pro, Dave O&#x27;Connell, and a club member, Des Sullivan, who was a reporter and later, golf editor for the &quot;Newark Evening News&quot;. One day his first shot was bad and he beseeched O&#x27;Connell and Sullivan to allow another shot since they &quot;had been practicing all morning&quot; and he had not. Once they agreed and the round finished, Mulligan began to exclaim proudly for months to the members in his locker room, how he had gotten an extra shot from the duo. The members loved the device and soon began giving themselves &quot;Mulligans&quot; in his honor. Sullivan began using the term in his golf articles in the &quot;Newark Evening News&quot;. A television program, the &quot;Today Show&quot;, ran this story around 2005 and have it in their archives. Mulligan was located in the 1970s at the Lyons, New Jersey veterans administration hospital, helping with their golf facility. In his July 22, 1970, column in the &quot;Myrtle Beach Sun News&quot;, the semi-retired Des Sullivan wrote of finding Mulligan and the history behind the term.

===Swat Mulligan baseball origin theory===
In a 2017 blog post, Peter Reitan cast doubt on the eponymous &quot;mulligan&quot; etymology theories, pointing out that they conflicted with the (then-recent) 1931 antedating in the dictionary. He suggested that the term originated instead with &quot;Swat Mulligan&quot;, a fictional baseball player with extraordinary batting skills who appeared in the &quot;New York Evening World&quot; during the 1910s. Reitan presents quotations from the 1920s in which Mulligan&#x27;s name is used as a byword for powerful hits, including use of the phrase &quot;take a &quot;mulligan&quot;&quot; to mean taking a powerful swing at the ball. Reitan suggests that the term then arrived at its current meaning by semantic drift. The 1931 &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; citation has been suggested to represent a transitional form, in that the usage involves both a do-over and a powerful shot:

All were waiting to see what Byrd would do on the 290-yard 18th, with a creek in front of the well-elevated green. His first drive barely missed carrying the creek and he was given a “mulligan” just for fun. The second not only was over the creek on the fly, but was within a few inches of the elevated green. That’s some poke!

==Use in golf==
In golf, a mulligan is a stroke that is replayed from the spot of the previous stroke without penalty, due to an errant shot made on the previous stroke. The result is that the hole is played and scored as if the first errant shot had never been made. This practice is disallowed entirely by strict rules in formal play and players who attempt it or agree to let it happen may be disqualified from sanctioned competitions. However, in casual play, &quot;mulligans&quot; speed play by reducing the time spent searching for a lost ball, reduce frustration, and increase enjoyment of the game because a player can &quot;shake off&quot; a bad shot more easily with their second chance.

A &quot;gilligan&quot;, the opposite of a &quot;mulligan&quot;, is to redo a successful stroke when so requested by an opponent.

As mulligans are not covered by strict rules – except to prohibit them – there are many variations of the practice among groups of players who do allow them in friendly games. If a mulligan is allowed to be used to replay any shot, typically each player is limited to 18 per round, sometimes 9 in the first 9 holes and 9 in the second nine. Traditionally, mulligans can only be played on tee shots (which are notoriously difficult to make accurately), and sometimes they may only be played on the first tee shot of the round (known as a &quot;breakfast ball&quot;). In the case of a mulligan used to replay the first tee shot, multiple &quot;mulligans&quot; may be allowed under different names (Finnegan, Branagan, Flanagan, or Craig) until the player has hit a playable tee shot.

Although certain players may wish to bank their shots, this is deemed unsportsmanlike and is generally frowned upon. Golf tournaments held for charity may charge for mulligans to collect more money for the charity.

==Use in other games==
In &quot;Titan&quot;, the rules of the 1982 version allow a &quot;First move mulligan&quot; for an unfortunate dice roll.

===Card games===
In collectible card games, a mulligan refers to the process of adjusting which cards are in a player&#x27;s initial hand of cards. Card games have various official rules for how mulligans are performed.

In &quot;&quot;, a player may declare a mulligan after drawing their initial hand at the beginning of each game. If a player chooses to do so, that player shuffles their current hand back into their deck, draws a new hand of seven cards, then puts one card on the bottom of their library for each time they&#x27;ve mulliganed this game. The player may repeat this until satisfied, or until the number of cards in their hand reaches zero. The mulligan process has changed drastically over the history of the game. The current style is known as the &quot;London mulligan&quot;, as it was first used at a Mythic Championship tournament held in London.

&quot;Hearthstone&quot; allows players to mulligan at the start of the game by placing any number of cards in their opening hand back into their deck, each to be replaced with a random different card. Mulliganing one&#x27;s entire hand in hopes of getting a specific card is referred to as a &quot;hard mulligan&quot;.

In the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, each player needs at least one Basic Pokémon card in their opening hand to start the game. If there is no Basic Pokémon card in hand, the player must reveal their hand, shuffle it into their deck and draw a new hand of seven cards. If both players must mulligan, each of them reveals their hand, shuffles it into their deck and draws seven cards. If only one player must mulligan, their opponent may draw a number of cards up to the number of mulligans they took. (Before EX Ruby &amp; Sapphire, that player may draw up to 2 cards per mulligan.) Mulligans are repeated until each player has at least one Basic Pokémon card in hand.

In &quot;Dragon Ball Super Card Game&quot;, the player is given one opportunity to mulligan. They may return any number of cards into their deck and shuffle it, then draw the same number of cards.

&quot;&quot; bypasses mulligan rules common to other card games, and instead has a &quot;First Five&quot; rule, allowing players to pick the specific five cards which will comprise their opening hand.

In &quot;KeyForge&quot;, a player who is dissatisfied with their starting hand may discard it and draw a new hand with one fewer card.

In &quot;Legends of Runeterra&quot;, a player who is dissatisfied with their hand may shuffle any number of cards back into their deck, and draw the same number of cards.

In &quot;&quot;, players can mulligan up to two cards at the start of each round, replacing it with a random card from their deck. The player who goes first in Round 1 gets an additional mulligan. Also, as players draw three cards at the beginning of a round, but cannot have more than ten cards in hand, each drawn card that would increase their hand size over ten becomes a bonus mulligan instead.

In &quot;knock-out whist&quot; an eliminated player may ask for a &quot;dog&#x27;s chance&quot; in the next round. That player is then dealt a single card (regardless of how may cards would normally be in that hand). If the player succeeds in winning a trick with that card, they stay in for the next round, otherwise they are eliminated again.

===Politics===

In politics, the term &quot;mulligan race&quot; or &quot;mulligan candidate&quot; is used to describe a losing or disqualified candidate in a party primary or nomination, who, nevertheless, runs in the general election on another ballot line, either as an independent or as the nominee for a third party. In the 2006 Connecticut U.S. Senate race, many Ned Lamont supporters accused Senator Joseph Lieberman of running a mulligan race as an independent, since he had lost the Democratic Party primary. Several U.S. states have so-called &quot;sore-loser laws&quot; specifically designed to prevent such failed candidates from appearing on the ballot in the general election in such a manner.

As a general rule, in liberal democracies outside the United States there are few (if any) laws that would prevent failed or disqualified nomination candidates from contesting the general election, although mounting such a challenge often results in expulsion or permanent ostracization from the candidate&#x27;s former party. In jurisdictions using the Westminster system or single-member districts, mulligan candidates are a fairly common occurrence, especially in cases where the mulligan candidate alleges a nomination contest was lost due to unfair electoral practices or was disqualified by a former party without reasonable cause. 

Related terms include &quot;mulligan leader&quot; and &quot;mulligan party&quot;, the latter of which is used to describe a party founded or taken over by a failed leadership candidate (or deposed former leader) from another party. A recent example of such a party is the People&#x27;s Party of Canada, founded by failed Conservative Party of Canada leadership candidate, Maxime Bernier, while a notable historical party from the same country was the provincial Newfoundland Reform Liberal Party, founded and led by former Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Joey Smallwood. Although such parties rarely become serious contenders to form a government in general elections, if popular enough, they can cause vote splitting that especially in first past the post voting systems, may severely damage the electoral prospects of the mulligan leader&#x27;s former party.

In the 2008 American Democratic primary elections, the term mulligan was used to describe a proposed redo of elections in Michigan and Florida, after their results were declared invalid due to the early scheduling of the contests, against Democratic party rules.

The term also is coming into use to describe situations (that are becoming increasingly common in the age of social media) where a political party&#x27;s candidate or delegate is suddenly replaced by the party leadership on the eve of an election or convention, usually either because the person&#x27;s loyalty to the party or its leaders have come into question or because unsavory details regarding his past or character surface that warrant drastic measures to mitigate damage to the reputation or electoral prospects of the party or its leadership. Electoral rules and laws mostly drafted prior to the advent of social media, often severely restrict or prohibit the replacement of candidates after the nomination period has closed, which might be weeks or even months prior to the final vote. Proposals to relax such rules to allow parties to deal with to the increased likelihood of a candidate&#x27;s dodgy past coming to light at an inopportune moment have been mocked as &quot;mulligan rules&quot; by critics.

===Finance===

In finance, the term is used to refer to provisions in syndicated loan documentation where lenders only get the right to accelerate their loans after two financial covenants are breached. This practice is rare today, but was popular with sponsors at the height of the credit boom in 2006-07, allowing them to postpone the date at which they needed to start negotiating a restructuring with lenders. The loan &quot;mulligan&quot; is to be contrasted with a &quot;deemed cure&quot; clause that would allow a covenant breach to be disregarded in the event the next covenant tests were met. In addition, it typically remains possible with loans carrying financial covenants for a borrower to &quot;cure&quot; covenant breaches after the event by injecting new cash equity.

<doc id="635382" wikidata="Q148378" url="?curid=635382" title="Zatoichi">
<text>is a fictional character created by Japanese novelist Kan Shimozawa. He is an itinerant blind masseur and swordsman of Japan&#x27;s late Edo period (1830s and 1840s). He first appeared in the 1948 essay , part of Shimozawa&#x27;s &quot;Futokoro Techō&quot; series that was serialized in the magazine &quot;Shōsetsu to Yomimono&quot;.

This originally minor character was drastically altered and developed for the screen by Daiei Film and actor Shintaro Katsu, becoming the subject of one of Japan&#x27;s longest-running film series. A total of 26 films were made between 1962 and 1989. From 1974 to 1979, a television series was produced, starring Katsu and some of the same actors that appear in the films. Produced by Katsu Productions, 100 episodes were aired before the &quot;Zatoichi&quot; television series was cancelled.

The seventeenth film of the &quot;Zatoichi&quot; series was remade in the US in 1989 by TriStar Pictures as &quot;Blind Fury&quot;, starring Rutger Hauer. A 2003 film was directed by Takeshi Kitano, who also starred as the title character. It was awarded the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Silver Lion for Best Direction. A stage adaptation of &quot;Zatoichi&quot; directed by Takashi Miike and starring Show Aikawa was filmed in 2007 and later released on home video. &quot;&quot; is a 2010 film directed by Junji Sakamoto and starring Shingo Katori.

==Character==

Zatoichi at first comes across as a harmless blind &quot;anma&quot; (masseur) and &quot;bakuto&quot; (gambler) who wanders the land, making his living by &quot;chō-han&quot; (playing dice) as well as giving massages, performing acupuncture and even, on occasion, singing and playing music. Secretly, however, he is very highly skilled in swordsmanship, specifically Muraku-school kenjutsu and iaido along with the more general sword skills of Japan, as well as sumo wrestling and kyujutsu.

Little of his past is revealed, other than that he lost his sight as a child through illness. His father disappeared for undisclosed reasons when Zatoichi was about five years old. He is described by his swordsmanship instructor as having practiced constantly and with extreme devotion when he was a pupil in order to develop his incredible skills. Zatoichi says of himself that he became a yakuza (gangster) during those three years he spent training (which immediately precede the original &quot;The Tale of Zatoichi&quot;) and killed many people, something he later came to deeply regret. This is reflected in his willingness to involve himself in the affairs of others—chiefly, those suffering from oppression and exploitation, or some form of corruption. Despite that moral re-assessment and his new perspective and remorse (and most often because of them), he usually has a bounty (sometimes quite large) on his head from one source or another throughout the movies and series. However, because of his earnestness, wit, and natural sense of empathy, many people who encounter him during his travels grow to respect and even care for him.

Unlike a bushi, he does not carry a traditional katana. Instead, he uses a well-made &quot;shikomi-zue&quot; (仕込み杖, lit. &quot;prepared cane&quot; or cane sword), as the use or possession of true fighting blades was formally outlawed for non-samurai during the Edo period. The decree was virtually impossible to enforce, however, as evidenced by the yakuza enforcers being shown wielding katanas throughout the films. The blades of &quot;Shikomi-zue&quot; were generally straight-edged, of lower-quality, unfolded steel, which could not compare with even a low-end &quot;katana&quot;. As a result, the blade in Ichi&#x27;s cane sword is broken during the climactic battle in &quot;Zatoichi the Fugitive&quot; (the fourth film). The sword has a new blade by the next film, which he wields until the fifteenth film &quot;Zatoichi&#x27;s Cane Sword&quot;. The blade (which breaks during the film) and the blade that replaces it were specially forged at great expense and with far more than the usual care by master bladesmiths and were both of exceptional quality, superior to the swords of even most &quot;samurai&quot;. At the beginning of &quot;Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo&quot;, his swordblade (presumably the same) inexplicably breaks and is sold to a blacksmith along with its hilt and scabbard. Its replacement is not a &quot;shikomi-zue&quot;, but a &quot;jotō&quot; (杖刀 lit. a &quot;staff sword&quot;) of unrevealed origin that resembles a short, thick bo staff, which also soon breaks. In the next film, &quot;Zatoichi: The Festival of Fire&quot;, he is once again using his trademark cane sword, outfitted with a new blade of unknown origin and quality.

The principal recurring thematic formula of these films and the television series is that of the ever-wandering and sentimental drifter who protects the innocent and the helpless from oppressive or warring &quot;yakuza&quot; gangs, stops the worst of general injustice or predation and aids the unfortunate, and often, through no fault of his own, is set upon by ruffians or stumbles into harm&#x27;s way. Zatoichi&#x27;s saga is essentially one of an earthy but basically good and wise man almost always trying to do the decent thing, to somehow redeem himself and perhaps atone for past failings. Nevertheless, he believes himself instead to be a stained, corrupted and evil man, irredeemable and undeserving of the love and respect that some show and rightly have for him. This self-described &quot;god of calamities&quot; is routinely a magnet for troubles of one sort or another. Death is his only constant companion, as he pragmatically does not allow other people, especially those he loves or thinks highly of, to get close and stay there for long; such would lead to eventual tragedy. Death does seem, like a shadow, actually to follow an often reluctant Zatoichi almost everywhere he goes, and despite his mostly compassionate nature, killing appears to come entirely naturally to him.

His lightning-fast fighting skill is incredible, with his sword held in a reverse grip; this, combined with his unflappable steel-nerved wits in a fight, his keen ears, sense of smell and proprioception, all render him a formidable adversary. He is also quite capable with a traditional &quot;katana&quot;, as seen in &quot;Zatoichi&#x27;s Vengeance&quot; and the bathhouse scene in &quot;Zatoichi and the Festival of Fire&quot;. Similarly, he displays considerable skill using two swords simultaneously, in Musashi-like &quot;Nitō Ichi&quot; style in &quot;Zatoichi and the Doomed Man&quot;. Almost preternaturally dangerous with blades, he is fully capable (whether standing, sitting or lying down) of fighting and swiftly defeating multiple skilled opponents simultaneously. Some, however, have come close to besting him in combat, in particular during the final duel in &quot;Zatoichi Challenged&quot;, where extenuating circumstances played a role.

A number of other standard scenarios are also repeated through the series: Zatoichi&#x27;s winning of large amounts at gambling via his ability to hear whether the dice have fallen on even or odd is a common theme, as is his catching loaded or substituted dice by the difference in their sound. This frequently culminates in another set piece, Zatoichi&#x27;s cutting the candles lighting the room and reducing it to pitch blackness, commonly accompanied by his tagline &quot;Kurayami nara kotchi no mon da&quot; (暗闇ならこっちのもんだ; roughly meaning &quot;Darkness is my ally&quot; or &quot;Now we are all blind&quot;).

The character&#x27;s name is actually &quot;Ichi&quot;. &quot;Zatō&quot; is a title, the lowest of the four official ranks within the &quot;Tōdōza&quot;, the historical guild for blind men (thus, &quot;zato&quot; also designates a blind person in Japanese slang). Ichi is therefore properly called &quot;Zatō-no-Ichi&quot; (&quot;Low-Ranking Blind Person Ichi&quot;, approximately), or &quot;Zatōichi&quot; for short. Massage was a traditional occupation for the blind (as their lack of sight removed the issue of gender), as was playing the biwa or, for blind women (&quot;goze&quot;), the shamisen. Being lesser hinin (lit. &quot;&quot;), blind people and masseurs were regarded as among the very lowest of the low in social class, other than eta or outright criminals; they were generally considered wretches, beneath notice, no better than beggars or even the insane—especially during the Edo period—and it was also commonly thought that the blind were accursed, despicable, severely mentally disabled, deaf and sexually dangerous.

== Original film series ==

The original series of 26 films featured Shintaro Katsu as Zatoichi. The first film was made in 1962 in black and white. The third film, in 1963, was the first to be filmed in color. The 25th film was made in 1973, followed by a hiatus of 16 years until Katsu&#x27;s last film, which he wrote and directed himself in 1989.

The original series of movies features other popular fictional characters of the genre on two occasions. &quot;Zatoichi Meets the One-Armed Swordsman&quot; (1971) connects with the Shaw Brothers series of Hong Kong-produced movies directed by prolific director Chang Cheh; and &quot;Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo&quot; (1970) features Toshiro Mifune as Imperial Shogunate Secret Agent Daisaku Sasa. This character resembles the title character of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s films &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and &quot;Sanjuro&quot;. The earlier films, in which Mifune&#x27;s character used the pseudonym Sanjuro (30-year-old), are alluded to when Sassa is jokingly called Shijuro (40-year-old).

=== List of films ===
* Note: The English titles shown are the common commercially used titles, thus they are not direct translations of the original Japanese titles.

==Television series==
The television series &quot;Zatoichi&quot; ran for four seasons—a total of 100 episodes—with Shintaro Katsu in the lead role:
# 26 episodes, in 1974
# 29 episodes, in 1976
# 19 episodes, in 1978
# 26 episodes, in 1979

Most of the stories in the television series are original dramas, but some are essentially redacted remakes of the full-length Zatoichi films of the previous decade such as Season One, Episode 14, &quot;Fighting Journey with Baby in Tow&quot; (corresponds to the 8th film &quot;Fight, Zatoichi, Fight&quot; 座頭市血笑旅 Zatōichi kesshō-tabi); Season One, Episode 16, &quot;The Winds From Mt. Akagi&quot;.

The first season of television shows has been released with English subtitles from Media Blasters / Tokyo Shock.

==Production companies==
The first 20 films were produced and distributed by Daiei Film (except for the 16th film &quot;Zatoichi the Outlaw&quot; and the 20th film &quot;Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo&quot; which were produced by Shintaro Katsu&#x27;s own company, Katsu Productions, and distributed theatrically by Daiei).

The last 6 films (and the TV series) were also produced by Katsu Productions. Distribution of these films was done by Dainichi Eihai (&quot;Zatoichi Goes to the Fire Festival&quot;, &quot;Zatoichi Meets the One-Armed Swordsman&quot;), Toho (&quot;Zatoichi at Large&quot; which Toho also co-produced with Katsu Productions, &quot;Zatoichi in Desperation&quot;, and &quot;Zatoichi at the Blood Fest&quot;), and Shochiku which released Katsu&#x27;s last Zatoichi film in 1989. It was re-released (and retitled &quot;Darkness Is His Ally&quot;) in 2004, occasioned by the new 2003 Zatoichi film, &quot;Zatoichi&quot;, starring Takeshi Kitano, which Shochiku also released.

Chambara Entertainment/Video Action of Honolulu held the original VHS release rights to the Zatoichi film series numbers 1-20, though it only released some of them. Chambara eventually expired its North American release license. AnimEigo held the remainder of the VHS rights.

Home Vision Entertainment was granted United States distribution rights to the original Daiei films (except for the 14th and the 16th (the second of which was still in possession of AnimEigo)), and released them on DVD: the films were numbered 1–13, 15, and 17–19. AnimEigo released seven of the films: &quot;Zatoichi the Outlaw&quot; (1967), &quot;Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo&quot; (1970), &quot;Zatoichi at the Fire Festival&quot; (1970, as &quot;Zatoichi: The Festival of Fire&quot;), &quot;Zatoichi Meets the One-Armed Swordsman&quot; (1971), &quot;Zatoichi at Large&quot; (1972), &quot;Zatoichi in Desperation&quot; (1972), and &quot;Zatoichi at the Blood Fest&quot; (1973, as &quot;Zatoichi&#x27;s Conspiracy&quot;).

Media Blasters (under their Tokyo Shock label) have released both the 1989 film and the first season (26 episodes) of the TV series.

The Criterion Collection released the first 25 films as a dual-format Blu-ray and DVD boxed set on November 26, 2013.

==Remakes and spin-offs==

===&quot;Blind Fury&quot;===

In 1989, TriStar Pictures released a remake called &quot;Blind Fury&quot;, starring Rutger Hauer as a Vietnam War vet who is blinded, then taught to use a cane sword by a local tribe before returning home to America. This film is based on &quot;Zatoichi Challenged&quot; (1967), the 17th film in the original series.

===2003 film===

In 2003, Takeshi Kitano wrote, directed and appeared in a new high-budget film featuring the character, &quot;Zatoichi&quot;. It premiered on September 3, 2003, at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the prestigious Silver Lion award, and went on to numerous other awards both at home and abroad. The soundtrack was composed by Keiichi Suzuki and the Japanese tap dance troupe &quot;The Stripes&quot;. Zatoichi discovers a small, remote mountain town that has been overtaken by a bullying gang that is extorting money from the townspeople. As Zatoichi seeks to liberate the town, he encounters a &quot;rōnin&quot; seeking employment to pay for his ailing wife&#x27;s needs, and two &quot;geisha&quot; who are seeking to avenge the murder of their parents, but he soon discovers that they are not what they seem to be.

==In other works==
* In 1969, Teruo Sakamaki (酒巻輝男), a Japanese restaurant owner from Shinjuku turned Shintaro Katsu/Zatoichi impersonator, starred in a pink film entitled &quot;Lewd Priest: Forty-Eight Positions Cutting&quot; (好色坊主 四十八手斬り). The film was directed by Kaoru Umezawa and produced by Uematsu Productions, which was reportedly sued by Daiei for copyright infringement. Under various aliases including &quot;Shintaro Katsu look-alike (勝新太郎ソックリショー)&quot;, &quot;Rintaro Katsu (勝利太郎)&quot;, and &quot;Sing Lung (勝龍)&quot;, Sakamaki continued to imitate Shintaro Katsu as Zatoichi in numerous films in Taiwan including: &quot;The Blind Swordsman&#x27;s Revenge&quot; or &quot;The Blind Swordsman vs. The Flying Guillotine&quot; (盲劍・血滴子) (1972), &quot;The Blind Swordsman vs White Wolf&quot; (盲俠鬥白狼) (1972), &quot;Trust and Brotherhood&quot; (義氣傳義氣) (1972), &quot;The Hunchback&quot; (漢駝) (1972), &quot;Inspector Karate&quot; (頭號鐵人) (1973), and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Owl&quot; (魔鬼怪鷹) (1977).
* The 1969–70 &quot;Crimson Bat&quot; film series and its subsequent 1971 TV series were unauthorized variations, with a blind woman named O-Ichi, played by Yoko Matsuyama, as the sword-wielding hero.
* &quot;Blindman&quot; is a 1971 Spaghetti Western variation on the Zatoichi formula starring Tony Anthony as a blind gunman.
* In Hou Hsiao-hsien’s debut feature &quot;Cute Girl&quot; (1980), the main character Daigang performs a brief Zatoichi impression.
* The second season of the 1985 animated series &quot;Thundercats&quot; features a character named Lynx-O, who shares many similarities to Zatoichi. Having been blinded by volcanic gasses during his escape from his dying homeworld of Thundera, Lynx-O develops his other senses to &quot;see&quot; the world around him. He is a formidable fighter, and can use pressure points to disable and defeat his foes.
* The character of Zatoichi finds homage in the character of Zato-Ino (also known as &quot;the Blind Swordspig&quot;) in Stan Sakai&#x27;s long-running anthropomorphic comic series &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; (1984). This iteration of the character uses his keen sense of smell to find his way and to combat his enemies. Zato-Ino first appeared in &quot;Critters&quot; #7 (Jan 1987), published by Fantagraphics Books.
* A Western TV movie titled &quot;Blind Justice&quot; was released in 1994 from HBO. A blinded Civil War veteran protects a baby he is transporting to family beyond a border town besieged by bandits. 
* In the 1998 video game series &quot;Guilty Gear&quot;, one of the original characters is named Zato-1, who also happens to be a blind assassin. Although his name is pronounced Zato-one, the Japanese word for one is ichi, hence Zato-ichi.
* In the 2005 episode of &quot;The Boondocks&quot; titled &quot;Grandad&#x27;s Fight&quot;, Huey has a dream in which he fights Col. Stinkmeaner – a blind and cruel elderly man who had beaten his grandfather earlier in the episode – as a samurai. Later in the episode, Huey shows his grandfather footage of the animated Zatoichi in action, comparing Stinkmeaner to the blind swordsman.
* In the 2006 film &quot;Devil&#x27;s Den&quot;, the main characters, while being trapped in the strip club by female ghouls, have a fantasy scenario of how Zatoichi would deal with the ghouls himself.
* In the Shogun Pack update of the 2007 multiplayer first-person shooter &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, a katana called &quot;The Half-Zatoichi&quot; was introduced for use by both the Soldier and Demoman, alluding to the fact that the Demoman is missing an eye and is half-blind, while the Soldier&#x27;s helmet covers his eyes and restricts his vision.
* In the 2007 American exploitation horror film &quot;Death Proof&quot;, Jungle Julia sarcastically calls Stuntman Mike &quot;Zatoichi&quot; when he fails to notice a billboard. Mike responds with a wide grin similar to Zatoichi&#x27;s.
* Italian heavy metal band Holy Martyr released a song titled &quot;Zatoichi&quot; on their 2011 album &quot;Invincible&quot;, based on the character. The album&#x27;s cover art depicts Zatoichi in combat against two rival warriors.
* In the 2013 online co-op game &quot;Warframe&quot;, there is a katana stance called &quot;Blind Justice&quot;, which causes the katana to be held in reverse grip. Its first attack combination is called &quot;Zatos&#x27; Creed&quot;, all of them being references to Zatoichi. As well as this, there is a skin for the &quot;Excalibur&quot; Warframe named &quot;Excalibur Zato&quot;.
* In the long-running manga series &quot;One Piece&quot;, the minor character and marine Admiral Fujitora is based upon Zatoichi.
* In the music video for Wednesday Campanella&#x27;s song Inca, singer KOM_I plays a Zatoichi inspired character. 
* The character of Zatoichi also finds homage in 2016&#x27;s &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot;, where Chinese actor Donnie Yen appears as Chirrut Îmwe, a blind transient wanderer who is secretly a highly skilled warrior who believes in, and has a connection with, the Force. Jedi characters Rahm Kota and Kanan Jarrus also draw inspiration from the character.
* In 2017, a short eight-minute fictitious sci-fi film trailer entitled &quot;ZVP - Zatoichi vs Predator&quot;, produced, written and directed by Junya Okabe as a nonprofit fan film starring Shun Sugata as Zatoichi was released by Blast Inc. and made available on YouTube. A very special team of villains attack and kill a group of samurai comic book style, until a mysterious samurai appears to defeat them. He is revealed to be a Predator and Zatoichi will face him with a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-style Jedi Knight lightsaber. A making-of video was also available.
* Denzel Curry&#x27;s album &quot;Melt My Eyez See Your Future&quot; features a track titled &quot;Zatoichi&quot;, and its accompanying music video includes Curry training under a blind martial artist.

<text>CBKT-DT (channel 9) is a CBC Television station in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. It is part of a twinstick with Ici Radio-Canada Télé station CBKFT-DT (channel 13). The two outlets share studios with sister radio stations CBK, CBK-FM and CBKF-FM at the CBC Regina Broadcast Centre at 2440 Broad Street in Downtown Regina; CBKT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located near McDonald Street/Highway 46, just northeast of Regina proper.

==History==

CBKT signed on for the first time on December 21, 1962 as CHRE-TV, a semi-satellite of CHAB-TV in Moose Jaw and an affiliate of CTV. CHRE signed on as part of a deal between CHAB-TV and Regina&#x27;s original station, CKCK-TV, which allowed CTV to come to Saskatchewan for the first time. On the same day CHRE signed on, CKCK-TV opened a rebroadcaster in Moose Jaw. During the latter half of the 1960s, the station generally branded itself as &quot;Channel 9&quot;.

On May 30, 1968, controlling interest in CHAB Ltd., owner of CHAB-AM-TV and CHRE, was transferred to Moffat Broadcasting, owner of Winnipeg&#x27;s CTV affiliate, CJAY (channel 7, now CKY-DT). The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), however, told Moffat to sell CHAB-TV and CHRE to a new owner within one year. Moffat tried to sell CHAB and CHRE to Western Broadcast Management Ltd., owner of CHAN-TV in Vancouver. However, the CRTC denied this bid on July 18, 1969 in favour of a counteroffer from the CBC. On September 13, CBC officially assumed control of CHRE and CHAB and moved its programming there, while CKCK became the sole CTV outlet in southern Saskatchewan. CBC made the Regina station the main station, and changed the call letters of the stations to CBKRT and CBKMT respectively. After the switch to the CBC, the brand used was &quot;9&amp;4&quot; or &quot;CBC 9&amp;4&quot;, to signify both the Regina and Moose Jaw channel numbers.

The station received its current call letters on July 31, 1978. On the same day, CBKMT&#x27;s licence was merged with that of CBKT; its transmitter operated as a full-time rebroadcaster, CBKT-1. The CHRE calls are now used on a radio station in St. Catharines, Ontario, owned by Bell Media. After a brief flirtation with &quot;TV9 Regina&quot;, the station returned to the &quot;9&amp;4&quot; brand in the 1980s, this time to signify the station&#x27;s cable channel position. Today the station is branded just as &quot;CBC&quot; or &quot;CBC Saskatchewan&quot;, as it has since the early 1990s, when the latter branding was introduced to signify the inclusion of not only the main station but also its rebroadcasters across the province, including Moose Jaw and Saskatoon. In 2002, CBC purchased former privately owned affiliates CJFB-TV in Swift Current and CKOS-TV in Yorkton, turning both into rebroadcasters of CBKT.

==Newscasts==
CBKT-DT presently broadcasts 8 hours, 50 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 2 hours, 10 minutes each weekday); unlike most CBC stations, CBKT does not air local newscasts on weekends. The station airs local news programming on weekdays, covering stories in Regina, Saskatoon, Swift Current, Yorkton and Prince Albert. The station broadcasts a 30-minute early evening newscast, with a short ten-minute newscast at 11 p.m. following &quot;The National&quot;.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts, CBKT flash cut its digital signal into operation on VHF channel 9.

===Transmitters===
CBKT operated 14 analog over-the-air television rebroadcasters broadcasting in southern Saskatchewan in communities such as Moose Jaw, Swift Current and Yorkton. Additionally, CBKST in Saskatoon and its network of over 20 associated transmitters were officially licensed as rebroadcasters of CBKT. At CBC&#x27;s request, CBKST&#x27;s licence was revoked effective August 1, 2012. Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analog transmitters on July 31, 2012.

<text>Simon Larose (born June 28, 1978) is a former professional tennis player. He was Canada&#x27;s top-ranked singles player for some months during 2003 and 2004. Larose retired from the tour shortly after being banned for two years for substance abuse.

==Biography==
Larose was born in Cap-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec, Canada. He joined the ATP professional tour at the age of 20 in 1998 having played collegiately at Mississippi State University. He was Canada&#x27;s top-ranked singles player, according to the ATP rankings, in 2003 from January 6 until February 3, from May 19 until June 23, and from August 18 until October 13, and again in 2004 from July 12 until August 2. His best singles ATP ranking is World No. 189, which he achieved in July 2004.

Although Larose did not make any official announcement, he was quoted in the press as saying that he retired from tennis after being levied a two-year ban in February 2005 by the ATP for testing positive for cocaine. At the time of his supposed cocaine use, he had been out of action with a back injury.

Since his retirement from the ATP circuit Larose has been coaching at a local tennis club, moving on to coach for Tennis Canada.

Simon made Canadian radio history when he provided analysis on the first-ever Canadian English language production of the 2010 Rogers Cup tennis final along with CJAD 800&#x27;s Rick Moffat (play-by-play) and Mark Shalhoub (courtside reporter).

Larose provided CJAD 800 coverage for the 2012 Rogers Cup and returns to the booth August 10–11 for the Men&#x27;s Singles Semis and Final.

Larose has been successful as a coach. He was appointed the Canadian National team&#x27;s head coach and has coached Rebecca Marino and Francoise Abanda.

<doc id="635387" wikidata="Q1276025" url="?curid=635387" title="Kisii people">
<text>The Abagusii (also known as Kisii (Mkisii/Wakisii) in Swahili, or Gusii in Ekegusii) are a Bantu ethnic group indigenous to Kisii and Nyamira counties of former Nyanza, as well as parts of Kericho and Bomet counties of the former Rift Valley province of Kenya. 

The Abagusii traditionally inhabit Kisii and Nyamira counties, as well as sections of Kericho and Bomet counties, all of which were within the former Nyanza and Rift Valley provinces of Kenya. Studies of East African Bantu languages and anthropological evidence suggests that the Abagusii, together with Kuria, Ngurimi, Rangi, Mbugwe, Simbiti, Zanaki and Ikoma, emerged from East African Neolithic agropastoralists and hunters/gatherers believed to have come from the North of Mt. Elgon. It&#x27;s also believed that there was heavy influence on the Abagusii from Bantu speakers migrating out of Central Africa and West Africa; certain groups of the Abagusii may have been assimilated from the Luhya and Olusuba speaking Suba people, which originated from west of Lake Victoria. The majority of Abagusii are closely related to the Maasai, Kipsigis, Abakuria, and Ameru of Kenya.

The Abagusii also have a close linguistic relationship with the Ngurimi, Rangi, Mbugwe, Simbiti, Zanaki, Ikoma and Maragoli people. They speak the Ekegusii language which is classified with the Great Lakes Bantu languages. However, the inclusion of Abagusii in the Bantu language group is a subject of debate, given that studies on East African Bantu languages have found Ekegusii, together with the Kuria, Simbiti, Ngurimi, Rangi and Mbugwe languages to be rather distinct from other Bantu languages in terms of structure and tense.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Kisii&quot; is Swahili and originates from the colonial British administration, who used it in colonial Kenya to refer to the Abagusii people, as it was much easier to pronounce. The term Kisii, however, has no meaning in the Ekegusii language. In the Swahili language, the singular form is Mkisii and the plural form is Wakisii; the Swahili name for the Ekegusii language is Kikisii. The term is now popularly used in Kenya to refer to Abagusii people.

Among the Abagusii, the name Kisii does not refer to the people, but to a town—Kisii, also called Bosongo or Getembe by the locals, is the major native urban centre of the Abagusii people. The name Bosongo is believed to have originated from Abasongo, which means &quot;the whites&quot; or &quot;the place where white people settle(d))&quot;, referring to settlers living in the town during the colonial era.

The other name used by the British in reference to Abagusii were Kosova/Kossowa which is derivative of the Ekegusii expression &quot;Inka Sobo&quot;, meaning their home. The endonym is Abagusii (plural), and Omogusii (singular); the language spoken by the people is Ekegusii. The term &quot;Gusii&quot; supposedly comes from Mogusii, the founder of the community.

==History==


===Origins===
Based on linguistic and anthropological evidence, the Abagusii originated from the neolithic agropastoralist inhabitants of present-day Kenya, particularly from the former Nyanza and Rift Valley provinces. The competing theory by some scholars that the Abagusii migrated from Uganda is lacking, as there&#x27;s no historical evidence the Abagusii settled in Uganda and have been known to only settle on the eastern slopes of the Kenyan side of Mt. Elgon.

The oral tradition of the Abagusii holds that their ancestors migrated from a place called Misiri, north of Mt. Elgon, possibly in present-day Egypt. These ancestors were the founders of the six major Gusii clans: the Abagetutu, Abanyaribari, Abagirango, Abanchari, Abamachoge, and Ababasi. This original group later absorbed a group of settlers from west of Lake Victoria, what is now present day Buganda and Busoga; these settlers may have been assimilated from the Luhya and Olusuba-speaking Suba people.

===Settlement in Gusiiland===

Present-day Gusiiland, along with Kenya and East Africa at large, has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. As a result, its settlers have diverse origins. The first settlers were likely hunter/gathers similar to the Khoisan and Ogiek, which were followed by the Nyanza/Rift Cushites who replaced these hunters-gatherers, assimilating them, and settled during the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic period (c. 3200–1300 BC) The next group of settlers were Nilotic pastoralists from present-day South Sudan that settled in the area circa 500 BC. The last group to settle in the area are Bantu speakers, whose migration to the area began in 1 AD. Several southern Nilotics and southern Cushitics were assimilated into the Abagusii, whom are likely responsible for the Gusii practice of circumcision and other practices due to cultural diffusion.

=== Colonial era ===
The Abagusii were seen as warlike and fierce fighters by other ethnic groups, along with the Ameru, Abakuria and Maasai; the Abagetutu specifically were seen as the most martial of all Abagusii Clans. This perception is evident in excerpts from the East African Protectorate Commissioner Sir Charles Eliot in early 1900s expeditions of Gusiiland and surrounding areas:

Their warlike nature was deemed as a threat to British rule, especially the cattle camps the warriors frequented, and the British enacted punitive expeditions that raided cattle and crushed the warriors. This slowly brought an end to the pastoral and war-based lifestyle of most Abagusii.

The British introduced new immigrants to Kisii County and other parts of Kenya in the 1930s to work as soldiers, porters and farmers. These were the Baganda, the Maragoli, the Nubi, and the Olusuba-speaking Suba people (Kenya) from Rusinga Island, Mfangano Island, and sections of Homa Bay County. The Nubians were settled by the British in present-day Kisii town and worked as soldiers for the British government, while the Bantu speaking Maragoli, Baganda, and Suba people were settled in Kisii town as porters and labourers on white farms and tea plantations. Some of the new immigrants introduced to Kisii town by the British have been largely assimilated into the Gusii society, but others, particularly the Nubi, never assimilated and still maintain their original settlement in Kisii town.

=== Post-colonial ===
In the post-colonial age, the Abagusii have expanded out of their traditional range, settling in the major towns of the Luo-Nyanza counties, like Homa Bay, Migori, Kisumu and Siaya as well as other Kenyan towns and cities. There is also a significant diaspora population in the United States (particularly Minnesota), the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa.

== Relationship with other peoples ==
===Relationship with Nilotic speakers===
The relationship between the Abagusii and their neighbouring Nilotic speaking communities (such as Maasai, Nandi, Kipsigis, Luo) is often painted negatively on social media. The colonial perceptions of Nilotics as more hostile and warlike have continued to persist in wider Kenyan discourse as evidenced by works of scholars and researchers such as Ochieng and Ogot among others. These scholars have exploited such colonial stereotypes and largely stereotyped the Nilotic speaking communities in their works. Despite these stereotypes, the Abagusii have often maintained positive relationships with their Nilotic neighbours in the pre- and post-colonial era. Prior to colonization, the Abagusii engaged in barter trade with these communities, especially the Luo people, and at times, worked together to defeat cattle raiders. The co-existence between the Abagusii and the neighbouring Nilotic communities was largely peaceful, despite these communities and Abagusii occasionally clashing in sometimes violent cattle rustles and grazing land conflicts.

===Relationship with East African Bantu speakers===

During the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii mostly had contact with their immediate, Nilotic-speaking neighbours. As a result, there was limited contact between the Abagusii and Bantu-speaking communities, as indicated by Ekegusii having features not found in other Bantu languages. However, not all Bantu-speaking groups were cut off from the Abagusii. The Bantu-speaking groups in contact with the Abagusii in pre-colonial Kenya include the Kuria, Zanaki, Ikoma, Rangi, Mbugwe, Ngurimi, Simbiti, some Suba clans, and the Maragoli. In the post-colonial period, however, contact with other Bantu speaking communities both inside and outside of Kenya has dramatically increased, both from British population relocations and the advent of modern transportation.

====Etymology of Bantu and relevance to Abagusii====

The modern usage of the term &quot;Bantu&quot; was only developed in the 19th century with the advent of European colonization; prior to colonization, no such division existed in Africa. This categorization of Africa&#x27;s people into distinct, internally homogeneous groups is seen as generalizing at best, and inaccurate at worst. In the context of the Abagusii together with Kuria, Zanaki, Ikoma, Rangi, Mbugwe, Ngurimi, and Simbiti, some linguistic and cultural evidence indicate that they may be more influenced by Nilotic and Cushitic communities than other Bantu groups.

==Economic activities==
=== Agriculture and herding ===
During the pre-colonial era, the Abagusii cultivated finger millet, sorgum, barley, pumpkin, and other native crops; ox-drawn plows and iron hoes were used for cultivating crops. However, the Abagusii were mainly pastoralists and hunter-gatherers who primarily relied on their cattle, goats, sheep, and to a lesser extent, poultry for food. In the 19th century, Europeans introduced tea, coffee, bananas/plantains, and most importantly, maize. By the 1920s, maize quickly replaced finger millet and sorghum as a staple and cash crop. By the 1930s, tea and coffee had become major cash crops.

Today, the Abagusii still continue to keep livestock and poultry alongside farming, along with old agricultural practices; some crops they cultivate today include: cassava, potatoes, tomatoes, bananas, beans, onions, tropical fruits, and peas among others. Farming remains a dominant activity in Gusiiland due to high population density.

===Industrial activities===
During the pre-colonial period, Abagusii produced iron tools, weapons, decorations, wooden implements, pottery, and baskets. The Abagusii also imported pottery from the neighbouring Luo community. Blacksmiths and other occupations that worked with iron and iron ore were highly respected and influential members of Abagusii society, despite not forming a distinct societal caste; smithing was largely carried out by men.

===Trade===

The primary form of trade carried out in pre-colonial times was barter, and mostly took place within homesteads, as well as with neighbouring communities, especially the Luo; tools, weapons, crafts, livestock, and agricultural products were commonly exchanged. Cattle were an important form of currency, and goats served a lower valued currency. Barter trade between the Abagusii and the Luo took place at border markets and Abagusii farms, and was mainly carried out by women.

In the modern age, the Abagusii have established shopping centers, shops, and markets, further connecting them to the rest of Kenya, as opposed to their comparatively isolated pre-colonial economies.

===Division of labor===

Traditionally, Abagusii society divided labor between men and women. Women were expected to cook, brew, clean, cultivate and process crops, and fetch water and firewood; men were expected to herd, build houses and fences, clear crop fields, among other duties. Men were less involved in crop cultivation compared to women. Herding was primarily carried out by boys and unmarried men, and girls and unmarried women helped with crop cultivation. This division of labor has broken down over time, and women have gradually taken over many of the men&#x27;s traditional duties.

==Culture==

=== Coming-of-age rituals ===
Among the Abagusii, circumcising boys without anesthesia around 10 is an important rite of passage. Traditionally, the Abagusii did not marry into tribes that did not practice circumcision, though this practice has declined in recent generations. The ritual typically takes place every year in the months of November and December, followed by a period of seclusion where boys are led in different activities by older boys. During this period, only older circumcised boys are allowed to visit the initiates. It is considered taboo for anyone else to visit during this time. In this period of isolation, the male initiates are taught their roles as young men in the community, and the code of conduct of a circumcised man. Initiated boys were also taught the rules of shame (&quot;c&quot;hinsoni&quot;&quot;) and respect (&quot;o&quot;gosika&quot;&quot;). This is a time of celebration for families and the community at large. Family, friends, and neighbours are invited days in advance by the candidates to join the family in celebration.

=== Music ===
The Abagusii traditionally play a large bass lyre called &quot;obokano,&quot; alongside drums and flutes. Some of the notable musicians from the Abagusii community include: Mwalimu Arisi O&#x27;sababu, Christopher Monyoncho, Sungusia, Sagero, Riakimai &#x27;91 Jazz, Bonyakoni Kirwanda junior band, Mr Ong&#x27;eng&#x27;o, Grandmaster Masese, Deepac Braxx (The Heavyweight Mc), Nyashinski, Rajiv Okemwa Raj, Ringtone, Jiggy, Mr. Bloom, Virusi, Babu Gee,Vickyoung Ensanako, Brax Rnb, Sabby Okengo, Machoge One Jazz,Dela among others.

=== Art ===
The Abagusii are also known for their world-famous soapstone sculptures, called &quot;chigware&quot;, which are mostly concentrated in the southern parts of Kisii County, around Tabaka town.

===Religion===
Prior to the introduction of Christianity and Islam to Africa, the Abagusii were monotheistic, believing in a supreme God called &quot;&quot;Engoro&quot;; this God is also popularly called &quot;Nyasae&quot;, a loanword from the Dholuo language, among Abagusii. The Abagusii believe that Engoro created the Universe, and was the source of all life. The sun (&quot;Risase&quot;&quot;) and stars are both important in the Abagusii religion. Death, disease, and destruction of crops and livestock were considered unnatural events brought on by evil spirits, bad luck, witchcraft, or the displeasure of ancestor spirits. The Abagusii also revered medicine men and practiced ancestor worship, calling the ancestor spirits &quot;&quot;Ebirecha&quot;.&quot;

Today, most Abagusii practice Christianity, with the four major denominations being Catholicism, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Swedish Lutheranism, and Pentecostal Assemblies of God. A minority of Abagusii still adhere to their traditional religion, and others observe a syncretic form of their traditional religion and Christianity. Many still go to visit a diviner (&quot;omoragori&quot;) who can point out displeased spirits of the dead and prescribe solutions for placating them.

===Marriage===
Traditionally, marriage was arranged by the parents, who used intermediaries called &quot;&quot;chisigani&quot;; these intermediaries acted as referees for the future bride and groom. After the parents negotiated the dowry, the wedding would be organized. The wedding ceremony involved a mentor, called an &quot;omoimari&quot;&quot;, who could provide continuing support to the newly married couple. Marriage between members of the same clan was traditionally forbidden. Marriage was officially established through the payment of dowry in the form of cattle to the wife&#x27;s family. Afterwards, the man and woman are officially considered husband and wife. Divorce is customarily not allowed among Abagusii, as marriage is considered a permanent union that is only disrupted by death. Currently, civil and Christian marriages are recognized among the Abagusii.

===Household===
The typical Gusii family unit is composed of a man, his wives, and their children, living on the same land. This was divided into two components: the homestead (&quot;&quot;Omochie&quot;) and the cattle camps (&quot;Ebisarate&quot;&quot;). The married man, his wives, and their unmarried daughters and uncircumcised boys lived in the &quot;omochie&quot;. The &quot;ebisarate&quot;, situated in the grazing fields, was protected by the male warriors to defend against theft by cattle rustlers and raiders.

=== Architecture ===
A typical Gusii house has conical grass thatched roofs, and is typically round, though sometimes rectangular, in shape. Today, Gusii houses are still similar, though corrugated iron sheets and stone is sometimes used for the roofs and walls.

The traditional Gusii compound had elevated granaries for storing crops, such as millet and other crops. The Abagusii customarily built fortified walls and dug trenches around their homesteads and villages to protect against cattle rustling and raids by neighbouring communities. However, in 1913, the cattle camps were abolished by the British, forcing Abagusii to live in dispersed homesteads.

=== Cuisine ===
The original diet of Abagusii prior to colonization consisted of meat, milk, and blood from livestock, cereals from millet and sorghum, as well as fruits, vegetables, birds, edible insects (&quot;chintuga&quot;), and wild meat obtained through hunting and gathering. The post-colonial diet of Abagusii and other African tribes has been transformed and influenced by interactions with the European colonists that introduced new crops and farming methods to Gusiiland and Africa.

The staple meal is &quot;obokima&quot;, which is a dish of millet flour or sorghum flour cooked with water to a hardened dough-like consistency. It is often served with &quot;rinagu, chinsaga, rikuneni, enderema, emboga, omotere, risosa, egesare,&quot; among other local green leaves consumed as vegetables. It&#x27;s served with milk, particularly sour milk from livestock; it can also be served with any other stew. The Ekegusii word for &quot;having a meal&quot; &quot;(&#x27;ragera&#x27;)&quot; usually connotes a meal involving &quot;obokima&quot; at the centre. By 1920s, maize was introduced to Gusiiland and had overtaken finger millet and sorghum as staple crops and cash crops. As a result, maize is now largely used to prepare &quot;obokima&quot;. &quot;Ritoke&quot; (plural: &quot;amatoke&quot;), a dish of cooked and flavoured bananas, is a popular snack, but is considered a supplemental food, and not a proper meal.

=== Social organization ===
The social organization of Abagusii is clan-based and decentralized in nature. The Abagusii society is less based on social/caste stratifications than other societies, and there was little hierarchical strata based on caste or social status. For instance, certain professions like iron smiths (&quot;&quot;oboturi&quot;) and warriors (&quot;oborwani&quot;/&quot;chinkororo&quot;) were generally respected, but did not form a distinct caste.

==Political organization==
The Abagusii had a decentralized and clan-based form of government. Each clan had their own independent government and leader; the clan leader (&quot;omorwoti/omogambi&quot;&quot;) was the highest leadership rank for all clans and was equivalent to a king/chief role. It is common for the Abagusii men refer to their peers within the community as &quot;&quot;erwoti&quot; or &quot;omogambi&quot;&quot; when talking. There were also lower leadership ranks unique to individual clans. Warriors held an important role as the defenders of the community and their shared wealth in the form of cows.

<doc id="635388" wikidata="Q1142118" url="?curid=635388" title="City of Salford">
<text>Salford ( ), also known as the City of Salford, is a metropolitan borough with city status in Greater Manchester, England. The borough is named after its main settlement, Salford, but covers a larger area which includes the towns of Eccles, Swinton, Walkden and Pendlebury. The borough had a population of in , and is administered from the Salford Civic Centre in Swinton. 

Salford is the historic centre of the Salford Hundred an ancient subdivision of Lancashire. The City of Salford is the fifth-most populous district in Greater Manchester. The city&#x27;s boundaries, set by the Local Government Act 1972, include five former local government districts. It is bounded on the southeast by the River Irwell, which forms part of its boundary with Manchester to the east, and by the Manchester Ship Canal to the south, which forms its boundary with Trafford. The metropolitan boroughs of Wigan, Bolton, and Bury lie to the west, northwest, and north respectively. Some parts of the city, which lies directly west of Manchester, are highly industrialised and densely populated, but around one-third of the city consists of rural open space. The western half of the city stretches across an ancient peat bog, Chat Moss.

Salford has a history of human activity stretching back to the Mesolithic age. There are over 250 listed buildings in the city, including Salford Cathedral, and three Scheduled Ancient Monuments. With the Industrial Revolution, Salford and its neighboring settlements grew alongside the textile industry. The former County Borough of Salford was granted city status in 1926 and thus making it the second city in Greater Manchester after neighbouring Manchester. The city and its industries experienced a decline throughout much of the 20th century. Since the 1990s, parts of Salford have undergone regeneration, especially Salford Quays, home of BBC North and Granada Television, and the area around the University of Salford.

Salford Red Devils are a professional rugby league club in Super League and Salford City F.C. is a professional football club in League Two.

== History ==
Although the metropolitan borough of the City of Salford was a 20th-century creation, the area has a long history of human activity, extending back to the Stone Age. Neolithic flint arrow-heads and tools, and evidence of Bronze Age activity has been discovered in Salford. The northerly section of Watling Street, a Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) via Bury to Ribchester (Bremetennacum), passes through the city; a hoard of over 550 bronze Roman coins dating between 259 AD and 278 AD was discovered in Boothstown; and a Romano-British bog body, Worsley Man, was discovered in the Chat Moss peat bog.

In 1142, a monastic cell (small monastic house) dedicated to St. Leonard was established in Kersal. The 12th century hundred of Salford was created as Salfordshire in the historic county of Lancashire and survived until the 19th century, when it was replaced by one of the first county boroughs in the country. Salford became a free borough in about 1230, when it was granted a charter as a free borough by the Earl Ranulph of Chester. The cell in Kersal was sold in 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. A 16th-century manor house, called Kersal Cell, was built on the site of the priory. In the English Civil War between King Charles I and parliament, Salford was Royalist. Salford was also noted as Jacobite territory; its inhabitants supported Charles Edward Stuart&#x27;s claim to the Kingdom of Great Britain and hosted him when he rode through the area during the Jacobite rising of 1745.
During the Industrial Revolution, Salford grew as a result of the textile industry. Although Salford experienced an increase in population, it was overshadowed by the dominance of Manchester and did not evolve as a commercial centre in the same way. On 15 September 1830, Eccles was site of the world&#x27;s first railway accident. During a stop in Eccles to take on water, William Huskisson, Member of Parliament for Liverpool, had his leg crushed by Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Rocket&quot;; at the time he was in conversation with the Duke of Wellington, who was opening the railway, and did not get out of the way of the train in time. Although Huskisson was taken to Eccles for treatment he died of his injuries. The six-foot-tall Oglala Sioux tribesman, &quot;Surrounded By the Enemy&quot;, died here from a bronchial infection at age twenty-two in 1887 during a tour of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show and was buried at Brompton Cemetery. In 1894, the Manchester Ship Canal was opened, running from the River Mersey to Salford Quays; when it was complete it was the largest navigation canal in the world. Along the route of the canal, it was necessary to create an aqueduct carrying the Bridgewater Canal over the Ship Canal. The Barton Swing Aqueduct, designed by Sir Edward Leader Williams, is long and weighs .

At the start of the 20th century, Salford began to decline due to competition from outside the UK. A survey in 1931 concluded that parts of Salford were amongst the worst slums in the country. Salford was granted city status in 1926. During World War II, Salford Docks were regularly bombed.

In the decades following the Second World War there was a significant economic and population decline in Salford. In 1961 a small part of Eccles was added to the city. On 1 April 1974, the City and County Borough of Salford was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, and was replaced by the metropolitan borough of City of Salford, one of ten local government districts in the new metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. The city status of the new district was confirmed by additional letters patent issued on the same day. Since the early 1990s, the decline has slowed.

Prior to the metropolitan borough&#x27;s creation, the name Salford for the new local government district courted controversy. Salford was &quot;thought second-class by those in Eccles&quot;, who preferred the new name &quot;Irwell&quot; for the district (with reference to the River Irwell). A councillor for the then City and County Borough of Salford objected to this suggestion, stating this label was nothing but &quot;a dirty stinking river&quot;. The name Irwell won 8 votes to Salford&#x27;s 7, but a private protest and deliberation favoured Salford as the name for the new city, citing that the River Irwell would pass through two other Greater Manchester districts, and that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t touch Worsley&quot;.

== Geography ==

The City of Salford is bounded to the north by the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton and Metropolitan Borough of Bury. To the south by the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford and to the west by the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan. Manchester lies directly across the river from Salford. The natural mossland of Chat Moss lies in the south western corner of the city; it covers an area of about , accounting for about 30% of the city&#x27;s area, and lies above sea level. The moss makes up the largest area of prime farmland in Greater Manchester. Kersal Moor is an area of moorland spanning in Kersal; it is a local nature reserve and a Site of Biological Importance. Greenspace accounts for 55.7% of the City of Salford&#x27;s total area, domestic buildings and gardens comprise 20.0%, and the rest is made up of roads and non-domestic buildings.

To the south of Salford are the docks of Salford Quays, now home to the MediaCityUK. MediaCityUK is a large area that crosses the boundary into Trafford Park, Trafford. Although Salford Quays is in the City of Salford and has created job opportunities and more housing since the 2010s when it was built.

The River Irwell runs south east through Kearsley, Clifton and Agecroft then meanders around Lower Broughton and Kersal, Salford Crescent and the centre of Manchester, joining the rivers Irk and Medlock. Turning west, it meets the Mersey south of Irlam, where the route of the river was altered in the late 19th century to form part of the course of the Manchester Ship Canal. The ship canal, opened in 1894, forms part of Salford&#x27;s southern boundaries with Trafford. The city&#x27;s climate is generally temperate, like the rest of Greater Manchester. The nearest weather station is away at Ringway, in Manchester; the mean highest and lowest temperatures ( and ) are slightly above the national average, while the annual rainfall () and average hours of sunshine (1394.5 hours) are respectively above and below the national averages.

== Governance ==
=== Parliamentary constituencies ===

The City of Salford is represented by Members of Parliament (MPs) for three constituencies, Salford by Rebecca Long-Bailey (Labour), Worsley and Eccles by Michael Wheeler (Labour), and Blackley and Middleton South by Graham Stringer (Labour).

=== Council ===

In 1974, Salford City Council was created to administer the newly formed local government district. Until 1986, it shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council. The council offices are in Swinton, in what was formerly Swinton and Pendlebury Town Hall. The Labour Party have been in control of the council since its formation in 1974. The council has a constitution detailing how they should operate in performing their duties.

Salford City Council was assessed by the Audit Commission and judged to be &quot;improving well&quot; in providing services for local people. Overall the council was awarded &quot;three star&quot; status meaning it was &quot;performing well&quot; and &quot;consistently above minimum requirements&quot;, similar to 46% of all local authorities.

The metropolitan borough of the City of Salford is based on the former County Borough of the City of Salford which included the city centre, Pendleton, Weaste, Claremont, Langworthy, Broughton, Kersal, Ordsall and Seedley. The city is entirely unparished and absorbed the municipal boroughs of Eccles and Swinton and Pendlebury and the urban districts of Irlam and Worsley. An urban district was a type of local government district which covered an urbanised area.

Since 2012, in addition to the long-existing and largely ceremonial, annually appointed civic mayor of Salford, the city has also had a directly elected mayor.

==== Electoral wards ====
There are 60 councillors representing 20 wards. Swinton and Walkden have six councillors each.

===Central Salford and Salford West===
The district is divided into two areas (Central Salford and Salford West) for some purposes including planning, regeneration and housing.
*Central Salford is the eastern part of the district and comprises seven wards: Broughton, Claremont, Irwell Riverside, Kersal, Ordsall, Langworthy and Weaste &amp; Seedley. This is the more urban half of the district and lies partly within the Manchester Inner Ring Road. Salford Quays lies within this area. Between 2005 and 2011, the Central Salford Urban Regeneration Company was responsible for urban regeneration in this area, securing over £1 billion of private sector investment. Social housing is provided by Salix Homes in this area.
*Salford West comprises the other 13 wards, including the towns of Eccles, Pendlebury, Swinton and Walkden. This is the more suburban and rural half of the district. Salford City Council&#x27;s aspiration is that &quot;In 2028, Salford West will be one of the most desirable and prosperous areas in Greater Manchester.&quot; Social housing is provided by City West Housing Trust in this area.

=== Coat of arms ===
The coat of arms of Salford City Council depicts a weaving shuttle surrounded by five bees with a three masted ship above, on a shield flanked by two lions. The blue background with a gold chief is taken from the arms of the city council of the County Borough of Salford, who in turn took it from the colours of the Earl of Chester. The shuttle and five bees represent the industry of the area and five settlements who benefited from the textile industry. The ship is borrowed from the crest of Eccles Borough Council and represents the importance of waterways to the city. The ship is flanked by two millrinds – the iron centres of millstones – symbolising engineering. The lions are taken from the crest of the Borough of Swinton and Pendlebury; they are wearing iron steel chain representing engineering. The shield is topped by a griffin carrying a pennon depicting three boars&#x27; heads. The griffin is taken from the crest of Eccles and the boars are from the crest of Irlam Urban District. Beneath the shield is a scroll reading &quot;salus populi suprema lex&quot;, Latin for &quot;the welfare of the people is the highest law&quot;.

=== Budget ===
In 2017–18, Salford City Council agreed to spend £267 million. They agreed an estimated £79M on children&#x27;s services (30%); £56M on community health and social care (21%); £40M on levies and charges (15%); £39M on environment and community safety (14%); £36M and on capital financing (13%); £9M on corporate business (3%); £7M on regeneration (3%); and £2M on public health, reform and commissioning (1%). For the 2016–17 financial year, the council&#x27;s income is expected to consist of £65M including council tax and efficiency savings. The net expenditure is therefore expected to be £202M.

=== Audit ===
A Comprehensive Area Assessment by the Audit Commission in 2009 found that Salford&#x27;s key priorities are improving health, reducing crime, helping young people achieve A-level qualifications, social services, including the views of minority groups, improving skills and &quot;making Salford a cleaner and more attractive place to live&quot;.

== Demography ==

=== Ethnicity ===
At the 2011 UK census, the City of Salford had a total population of 233,933. Of the 103,556 households in Salford, 25.4% were married or same-sex civil partnership couples living together, 36.4% were one-person households, 11.2% were co-habiting couples and 13.5% were lone parents. The figures for lone parent households were above the national average of 10.6%, and the percentage of married couples was also below the national average of 33.2%; the proportion of one person households was higher than the national average of 30.3%.

The population density was 24.1 persons per hectare (Salford covers 9,719 hectares), 117,151 (50.1%) female, and 116,782 (49.9%) male. Of those aged 16–74 in Salford, 27.1% had no academic qualifications, significantly higher than 22.5% in all of England. 11.8% of Salford&#x27;s residents were born outside the United Kingdom, lower than the national average of 13.8%. The largest minority group was recorded as Asian, at 4.1% of the population.

The number of theft from a vehicle offences and theft of a vehicle per 1,000 of the population was 21.3 and 7.9 compared to the English national average of 7.6 and 2.9 respectively. The number of sexual offences was 1.1 compared to the average of 0.9. The national average of violence against another person was 16.7 compared to the Salford average of 27.2. The figures for crime statistics were all recorded during the 2006/7 financial year. Although all were above the averages for England, Salford&#x27;s crime rate was lower than Manchester&#x27;s.

=== Population change ===
The table below details the population change since 1801, including the percentage change since the last available census data. Although the City of Salford has existed as a metropolitan borough since 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and civil parishes that would later be constituent parts of the city.

=== Religion ===

The following table shows the religious identity of residents residing in the city of Salford.

Salford is covered by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford, and the Church of England Diocese of Manchester. 

During the mid-19th century, there was an influx of Irish people into the Salford area, largely due to the famine in Ireland. In 1848, Salford Roman Catholic Cathedral was consecrated, reflecting Salford&#x27;s large Irish-born community at the time.

Of Salford&#x27;s six Grade I listed buildings, three are churches. St Augustine&#x27;s Church, Pendlebury, was built in 1874 by George Frederick Bodley. The Church of St Mary the Virgin, in Eccles, was originally built in the 13th century but was expanded in the 15th. A church has been on the site since at least the 12th century. St Mark&#x27;s Church, Worsley was built in 1846 by George Gilbert Scott. The six Grade II* listed churches are the Church of St Andrew in Eccles, the Cathedral Church of St John, the Church of St Luke in Pendleton, Monton Unitarian Church in Monton, the Church of St Philip in Salford, and the United Reformed Church.

== Economy ==

Salford Docks (also called Manchester Docks) were opened by Queen Victoria in 1894, providing docks in Manchester and Salford for the Manchester Ship Canal which linked Manchester to the sea. During the 1970s, the docks fell into decline as they proved too small for new, larger ships, and when they were abandoned in 1982 over 3,000 people lost their jobs. Salford City Council purchased the docks in 1984 and since then they underwent regeneration as a centre of tourism in Salford, which included the construction of the Lowry Centre. More than 10,000 people are employed in the Quays in jobs such as retail, construction, and e-commerce. In 2007, it was confirmed that the BBC would be moving five of its departments to a new development on Pier 9 of Salford Quays, called MediaCityUK. The move was completed in 2011.

Finance and professional services, tourism and culture, and computer and internet based services have been identified as growth industries in Greater Manchester and are concentrated in Manchester and Salford. Average house prices in the City of Salford are sixth out of all the metropolitan boroughs in Greater Manchester, 7.6% lower than the average for the county. There are, however, areas of considerable affluence, within the city, such as Broughton Park, parts of Kersal, Ellesmere Park, Worsley, parts of Swinton and Pendlebury and the ultra-modern Salford Quays.

At the 2011 UK census, Salford had 173,117 residents aged 16 to 74. 4.7% of these people were students with jobs, 4.1% looking after home or family, 6.9% permanently sick or disabled and 2.9% economically inactive for other reasons. The City of Salford has a high rate of people who are permanently sick and disabled, 70% higher than the national average of 4.0%.

In 2011, of 106,904 residents of the City of Salford in employment, the industry of employment was: 17.8% retail and wholesale; 7.6% manufacturing;13.7% health and social work; 8.7% education; 7.2% construction; 5.2% transport and storage; 6.6% accommodation and food service; 6.2% administrative and support services; 6.0% professional, scientific and technical; 5.1% public administration and defence; 4.4% financial and insurance; 3.4% information and communication; 1.6% real estate; 0.9% water supply and waste management; 0.6% energy supply; 0.1% agriculture, forestry and fishing; 0.1% mining and quarrying; and 4.7% other. This was roughly in line with national figures, except for the proportion of jobs in agriculture which is less than half the national average, reflecting the city&#x27;s suburban nature and its proximity to the centre of Manchester.

JCDecaux UK has its Manchester office in the Metroplex Business Park in Salford.

== Culture ==

===Museums and arts===
Salford Museum and Art Gallery is situated in Peel Park. Opened in 1850, the institution is devoted to the history of Salford and Victorian art and architecture. The Salford collection includes works by artists such as Christian Ludwig Bokelmann, Charles Landseer and Thomas Henry Illidge, and ceramics from Pilkington&#x27;s Lancastrian Pottery &amp; Tiles. Its extensive collection of artworks by the Salford-born painter L. S. Lowry was transferred to The Lowry in 2000. The museum also contains an indoor re-creation of a typical Victorian street, Lark Hill Place, which was built in 1957 using shop fronts that had been saved from demolition.

At the southern edge of Salford lies The Lowry arts centre, on the waterfront of Salford Quays. Opened in 2000, it is named after the artist and houses the city&#x27;s collection of Lowry artworks. Notable paintings on display there include &quot;Going to the Match&quot; (1953) and &quot;Industrial Landscape&quot; (1953). The building also contains two theatres and a drama studio, hosting drama, concerts, opera and dance events.

=== Landmarks ===
As of September 2003, the City of Salford has 6 Grade I, 14 Grade II*, and 253 Grade II listed buildings. The city has the equal second highest number of Grade I listed buildings out of the districts of Greater Manchester, behind Manchester. The Grade I listed buildings are the Church of St Augustine, the Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin, St Mark&#x27;s Church, Ordsall Hall, Wardley Hall, and a bridge over the River Irwell. Salford Cathedral, built in 1845, is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford and a Grade II* listed building. Most of Salford&#x27;s tallest buildings are mid-20th century residential tower blocks or 21st century high rise apartments. A study by Christopher Collier of the University of Salford suggested that Manchester&#x27;s drizzly climate is largely due to the multitude of high-rise blocks in Salford. Collier has proposed that they have a &quot;dramatic influence on the region&#x27;s weather patterns&quot;, and may contribute to the 8 °C (14 °F) temperature difference between Salford and its surrounding countryside.

There are three Scheduled Ancient Monuments in the city. The oldest is an Iron Age promontory fort occupied from 500 BC–200 AD. Also scheduled is Hanging Bridge on the border with Manchester, dating to the 14th century, and an underground section of the Bridgewater Canal in Swinton built in 1759.

Unauthorised absences and authorised absences from Salford secondary schools in 2006–07 were 2.0% and 7.0% respectively, both higher than the national average (1.4% and 6.4%). In 2007, the Salford LEA was ranked 127th out of 149 in the country – and ninth in Greater Manchester – based on the percentage of pupils attaining at least 5 A*–C grades at General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) including maths and English (37.8% compared with the national average of 46.7%). In 2007, Beis Yaakov High School was the most successful school in Salford at GCSE, with 90% of the pupils gaining five or more GCSEs at A*–C grade including maths and English. Bridgewater School was the most successful at A–level.

In 2007, the university received nearly 17,000 applications for 3,660 places. The university is undergoing £150M of redevelopment through investment in new facilities, including a £10M law school and a £22M building for health and social care which were opened in 2006. In 2007, the drop out rate from the university was 25%. Of the students graduating, 50% gained first class or 2:1 degrees, which is below the national average of about 55%.

== Transport ==

The city of Salford is served by nine railway stations on four routes. Eccles and Patricroft are on the northern route of the Liverpool to Manchester Line, while Irlam, in the southwest of the borough, is on the southern route. Clifton is on the line to Bolton and Preston; Swinton, Moorside and Walkden are on the Manchester to Southport Line via Wigan; and Salford Central and Salford Crescent are served by both routes. A station at Pendleton was closed in 1998 after suffering fire damage and a loss of patronage in favour of nearby Salford Crescent, opened a few years earlier. All train services are provided by Northern, though First transpennine offer occasional services during peak hours.
The Eccles line of the Manchester Metrolink runs through the City of Salford, with stations at Exchange Quay, Salford Quays, Anchorage, Harbour City, Broadway, Langworthy, Weaste, Ladywell and Eccles. The line was opened in two stages, in 1999 and 2000, as Phase 2 of the system&#x27;s development. In 2010 a new tram stop was opened at MediaCityUK, a 1 stop spur off the main Eccles line. Trams operate from here to Etihad Campus, sharing most of the route with the Eccles to Ashton line. Some Eccles and Ashton bound services also stop here, especially during peak hours. These lines provide good access for Eccles and the Quays to the rest of Greater Manchester.

There are bus stations at Pendleton and Eccles. Buses run to destinations throughout the city, across Greater Manchester and further afield: Pendleton is served by a route to Preston, Eccles Interchange is next to the Metrolink stop.

The council is responsible for the administration and maintenance of public roads and footpaths in the city.

Since 2020, electric scooters have been available for public hire in central Salford, Salford Quays, Ordsall, Pendleton and at the University of Salford. The e-scooter hire service is operated by shared micromobility company Lime.

<text>Tel Dor ( or , meaning &quot;generation&quot;, &quot;habitation&quot;) or Tell el-Burj, also Khirbet el-Burj in Arabic (lit. Tell, or Ruin, of the Tower), is an archaeological site located on the Israeli coastal plain of the Mediterranean Sea next to modern moshav Dor, about south of Haifa, and west of Hadera. Lying on a small headland at the north side of a protected inlet, it is identified with D-jr of Egyptian sources, Biblical Dor, and with Dor/Dora of Greek and Roman sources.

The documented history of the site begins in the Late Bronze Age (though the town itself was founded in the Middle Bronze Age, c. 2000 BCE), and ends in the Crusader period. The city was successively ruled by Canaanites, Sea Peoples, Phoenicians, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Jews, Romans and Byzantines. The port dominated the fortunes of the town throughout its 3,000 year history. Its primary role in all these diverse cultures was that of a commercial entrepôt and a gateway between East and West. The remains of the pre-1948 Palestinian Arab village of Tantura lie a few hundred meters south of the archaeological site. A kibbutz and the resort of Nahsholim were built on the site of the village.

==Etymology==
&quot;Dor&quot; (Hebrew: דוֹר or דאר, meaning &quot;generation&quot;, &quot;habitation&quot;), was known as Dora () to the Greeks and Romans, and as Dir in the Late Egyptian Story of Wenamun.

The city was known as Dor even before the Greeks arrived or had contact with the peoples in Israel. When the Greeks came to the city and learned its name to be Dor, they called it Dora, possibly after a Dorus said to be a son of Poseidon.

==Location and identification==
Dora of the classical period has been placed in the ninth mile from Caesarea, on the way to Ptolemais (Acre). Just at the point indicated was the small village of Tantura, probably an Arabic corruption of &quot;Dora&quot;.

==Hebrew Bible==
Many scholars doubt the historical accuracy of biblical texts relevant to times prior to the 9th century BCE. They suggest that the biblical context for such places as early Dor is more mythology than history.

In the Hebrew Bible, Dor is depicted as an ancient royal city of the Canaanites, () whose ruler was an ally of Jabin king of Hazor against Joshua, (). It appears to have been within the territory of the tribe of Manasseh, though they never managed to conquer it (; ). It was one of Solomon&#x27;s commissariat districts (; ).

==History and archaeology==

According to IAA archaeologists, the importance of Dor is that it is the only natural harbour on the Levant coast south of the Ladder of Tyre, and thus was occupied continuously from Phoenician times until the late 18th century. According to Josephus, however, its harbour was inferior to that of Caesarea.

Dor is mentioned in the 3rd-century Mosaic of Rehob as being a place exempt from tithes, seeing that it was not settled by Jews returning from the Babylonian exile in the 4th century BCE.

=== Early Iron Age ===
After the Late Bronze Age collapse, the town appears to have been settled by a migrant group called the Tjekker. In the Egyptian literary text known as the Story of Wenamun, the main character visits Dor and is received by Tjekker prince named Beder. This layer of the settlement is known archaeologically as Dor XII, and dates from c. 1150–1050 BC.

===Persian period===
In ca. 460 BCE, the Athenians formed an alliance with the Egyptian leader Inaros against the Persians. In order to reach the Nile delta and support the Egyptians, the Athenian fleet had to sail south. Athens had secured landing sites for their triremes as far south as Cyprus, but they needed a way station between Cyprus and Egypt. They needed a naval base on the coast of Lebanon or Palestine, but the Phoenician cities of Sidon and Tyre held much of the mainland coast and those cities were loyal to Persia. Fifty miles south of those cities, however, the Athenians found an isolated and tempting target for establishing a way station.

The Athenians seized Dor from Sidon. Dor had many strategic advantages for the Athenians, starting with its distance from Sidon. The Athenians had a maritime empire built on oared ships. They did not need large tracts of land and instead needed strategically situated coastal sites that had fresh water, provisions and protection from bad weather and enemy attack. Dor had an unfailing freshwater spring near the edge of the sea and to its south a lagoon and sandy beach enclosed by a chain of islets. This was precisely what the Athenian fleet needed for landing their ships and resting their crews. Dor itself was strategically situated. It stood atop a rocky promontory and was protected on its landward side by a marshy swale that formed a natural moat. Beyond the coastal lowlands was Mount Carmel. The town had Persian-built fortifications. In addition to this, the town had straight streets and Phoenician dye pits for the purpling of cloth. For these reasons, Dor became the most remote outpost of the Athenian navy.

===Hellenistic period===
During the Hellenistic period, Dor became a strategic site frequently contested by the Ptolemaic Kingdom and the Seleucid Empire, both vying for control of the region. In 219 BCE, the city, then under Ptolemaic rule, withstood an attack by Seleucid king Antiochus III. At the turn of the century, Dor, along with the regions of Judea and Phoenicia, was incorporated into Seleucid rule. In 138 BCE, Seleucid king Antiochus VII Sidetes and Jewish leader Simon Thassi besieged Dor, which was occupied by the usurper Diodotus Tryphon. This siege led to Tryphon&#x27;s flight and eventual death. The battle is corroborated by the discovery of lead sling bullets and other projectiles found near the site.

At the beginning of the reign of the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus, Dor was under the control of the tyrant Zoilus, who also ruled Straton&#x27;s Tower and Gaza. Alexander Jannaeus eventually took control of the city and incorporated it into the Jewish kingdom. In 63 BCE, the Roman general Pompey conquered Judaea and subsequently annexed Dor to the province of Syria.

=== Roman period ===
In the early 40s CE, young men in Dor placed a statue of Emperor Claudius inside a Jewish synagogue, provoking a challenge to Jewish ownership of the space. Agrippa responded by appealing to Petronius, the legate of Syria, who ordered the statue&#x27;s removal and reaffirmed Jewish rights to practice their customs freely under imperial decree. In the early phases of the Great Jewish Revolt against Rome (66–73 CE), Cestius Gallus held Jewish hostages in Dora, which was described as a city of Phoenice.

Dor&#x27;s decline seems to have started in the first century, despite evidence suggesting otherwise. Excavations have revealed numerous Roman-period structures, including a theater, public building, baths, and temples. Underwater surveys show artifacts spanning from the Herodian period to the mid-seventh century. Epigraphical evidence indicates a thriving urban life during the Roman era, with dedications to emperors and local officials. The town appears on the Tabula Peutingeriana, indicating its significance as a coastal station during the Roman period. A second-century papyrus also mentions it. Coins minted in Dora used a calendar beginning from its separation from the Jewish kingdom by Pompey in 63 BCE, with minting activities continuing into 212 CE. By Jerome&#x27;s time (340s–420 CE), the town was reportedly deserted.

=== Byzantine period ===
During the Byzantine period, Dor remained an active settlement. Archaeological findings indicate a vibrant community with evidence of economic, religious, and administrative activities. The town served as a bishopric, with bishops documented in 449 (just a few decades after Jerome described it as deserted), and again in 518 and 553. The place is mentioned in two lists from the 6th century. Additionally, a Byzantine church discovered from this period was found to remain in use into the Islamic period.

===State of Israel===
A moshav south of Tel Dor is named &quot;Dor&quot; after the ancient city.

The victims of the 1948 Tantura massacre are buried in a mass grave under a car park for the nearby Tel Dor beach.

==Excavation history==

Tel Dor (&quot;the Ruin of Dor&quot;) was first investigated in the 1920s by John Garstang, on behalf of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. J. Leibowitz excavated in the lower town around the tell in the 1950s. From 1979 to 1983, Claudine Dauphin excavated a church east of the tell. Avner Raban excavated harbour installations and other constructions mainly south and west of the mound in 1979 - 1984. Underwater surveys around the site were carried out by Kurt Raveh, Shelley Wachsman and Saen Kingsley. Ephraim Stern, of the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University, directed twenty seasons of excavations at the site between 1980 and 2000, in cooperation with the Israel Exploration Society. The eleven excavation areas opened have revealed a wealth of information about the Iron Age, Persian, Hellenistic and Early Roman periods.

==Archaeological findings==
===Purple dye production ===
As of 2001, excavations at the site have yielded an apparatus for the production of a purple dye solution, dating to the Persian and Hellenistic periods, wherein there was still a thick layer of quicklime (calcium oxide) which served, according to scholars, in helping to separate the dye from the mollusks after they had been broken and removed from their shells. These mollusks were primarily imported into the region from other places along the Mediterranean coast, and consisted of species Phorcus turbinatus, Patella caerulea, Stramonita haemastoma, Hexaplex trunculus, among other species.

=== Neolithic tsunami ===
In 2020, archaeologists discovered evidence of a tsunami that destroyed middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B coastal settlements in Tel Dor as it traveled between 3.5 and 1.5 km inland. The tsunami was approximately 16 m high. Recovery in the affected areas was slow but overall, it did not significantly affect the social development of the southern Levant. Whilst the tsunami is not identified with the Biblical flood, it is believed to contribute to the flood myths found in numerous cultures.

==Museum==
The historic &#x27;Glasshouse&#x27; museum building, located in kibbutz Nahsholim, some 500 meters south of the site itself, now houses the Center for Nautical and Regional Archaeology at Dor (CONRAD), consisting of the expedition workrooms and a museum displaying the finds from Tel Dor and its region such as documenting the city&#x27;s importance in the ancient world as a manufacturer of the prestigious azure and crimson colours from sea snails. The house is an old glass-making factory from the 19th century built by Baron Edmond James de Rothschild.

<doc id="635395" wikidata="Q512036" url="?curid=635395" title="Metropolitan Borough of Bury">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Bury is a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester in England. It is north of Manchester, to the east of Bolton and west of Rochdale. The borough is centred around the town of Bury but also includes the other towns of Ramsbottom, Tottington, Radcliffe, Whitefield and Prestwich. Bury bounds the Lancashire districts of Rossendale and Blackburn with Darwen to the north. With a population of in , it is the smallest borough in Greater Manchester.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, which covers , was created on 1 April 1974, with the transfer of functions from the County Borough of Bury and the boroughs of Prestwich and Radcliffe, along with the urban districts of Tottington and Whitefield, and part of the urban district of Ramsbottom, all previously in Lancashire.

==History==
The Metropolitan Borough of Bury was created on 1 April 1974, by the Local Government Act 1972 as one of the ten metropolitan districts of Greater Manchester. Prior to this, the area was represented by six other boroughs and districts:
* Bury (County Borough)
* Prestwich (Municipal Borough)
* Radcliffe (Municipal Borough)
* Ramsbottom (Urban District) (part)
* Tottington (Urban District)
* Whitefield (Urban District)

In 2006, facing a budget shortfall of over £10 million, Bury Metropolitan Council decided to sell its painting by L. S. Lowry called &quot;A Riverbank&quot;. The work, which depicts the River Irwell and cost £175 in 1951, was expected to fetch between £500,000 and £800,000. Between the announcement and the sale at Christie&#x27;s, the council was accused of &quot;selling off the family silver&quot;. The authority, which had the painting on display at Bury Art Museum, said it was putting its people before a picture. The painting raised £1.25 million for the authority on 17 November 2006 at the auction in London, costing the bidder £1,408,000 including commission. Consequently, the council&#x27;s membership of the Museums Association was cancelled and it was deregistered by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, a quango that was disbanded in 2011, transferring some of its duties to Arts Council England.

In July 2008 the borough was the first in Greater Manchester to hold a referendum on whether to install a directly-elected mayor. This was the result of a campaign against congestion charge plans that raised a petition with 9,460 names, well above the required five per cent of voters needed to trigger a mayoral vote. The proposal to have an elected mayor was rejected.

==Governance==
===Parliamentary constituencies===
The Metropolitan Borough of Bury currently consists of two parliamentary constituencies:
*Bury North – James Frith (Labour) 
*Bury South – Christian Wakeford (Labour)

===Council===

The borough has 17 wards, each represented by 3 councillors to form a council of 51 members. As of 2020, there were 148,595 electors, with an average of 2,914 per councillor.

At the 2023 Bury Metropolitan Borough Council election the average turnout to vote was 34.3%, varying locally from 45% in North Manor ward to only 25% in Bury East.

===Combined Authority===
The borough falls under the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, and is represented by the council leader, Eamonn O&#x27;Brien.

===Unparished areas===
The entirety of the borough is unparished.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms contains symbols representing the six constituent towns, with the design based on the arms of the old County Borough of Bury. The shield is divided diagonally by interweaving alluding to the textile industry. On the shield are a bee (representing industry) and papyrus (papermaking) from Bury; a ram&#x27;s head and a bullock&#x27;s head represent Ramsbottom and Tottington respectively. The silver field represents Whitefield, whilst the shield is supported with figures from the crests of Radcliffe and Prestwich. These represent the Radcliffe and Egerton families and wear a red rose (for Lancashire) and a cogwheel (for industry). The motto &#x27;Forward in Unity&#x27; sits on a scroll under the shield.

==Demography==
At the 2021 UK census, the Metropolitan Borough of Bury had a total population of 193,846. The population density is .

===Population and employment change===

The historical population table details the population change since 1801, including the percentage change since the last available census data. Although the Metropolitan Borough of Bury has only existed since 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and civil parishes that would later be constituent parts of the borough.

In 1971 34,980 people living in Bury were employed in manufacturing. By 2001 this had fallen to 13,690 – a decrease of 61%. During the same period the numbers of people employed in service industries increased from 34,200 to 54,227, a gain of 58.5%.

==Politics and services==
Between 1974 and 1986, the Conservative Party controlled the council. In 1986, the Labour Party gained control and continued in power, at first with an overall Labour majority and subsequently through a Labour executive running the council in a state of no overall control, until 2007. The May elections in 2007 saw the Conservative Party become the largest group on the council and the Conservative Group took control of the council and its executive. The leader of the council was named as Councillor Bob Bibby. At the 2008 local elections, the Conservatives won three more seats and took overall control of the council. In 2010, the Conservatives lost overall control with the new council having 23 Conservative, 20 Labour and 8 Liberal Democrat councillors.

The Audit Commission reported in 2006 that Bury Council continues to make good and sustained progress in improving services for local people. Overall the council was awarded &#x27;three star&#x27; status, similar to 47% of all local authorities.

The council was said to be improving well in children&#x27;s services, particularly in social care. The Audit Commission also noted that resident satisfaction was rising, reflecting improvements in the quality of the environment and services generally. Ten parks have achieved green flag status, recycling levels are above average and street cleanliness is improving. The council is on target to reach its Decent Homes target by 2010.

The assessment concluded that the council has improved the way it uses its resources to deliver its plans, improving how it manages its finances and service performance and strengthening arrangements to make sure that it achieves good value for money.
