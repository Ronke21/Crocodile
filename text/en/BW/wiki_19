<text>Old Ottawa South is an older urban neighbourhood in Capital Ward in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Old Ottawa South is a relatively small and compact neighbourhood, located between the Rideau Canal (to the north) and the Rideau River (to the south). The eastern boundary is Avenue Road. Bronson Avenue forms the western border of the residential neighbourhood. Carleton University is on the other (western) side of Bronson but the campus can be considered to be geographically within Old Ottawa South as the campus is also nestled between the river and the canal.

According to the Canada 2016 Census, the population of the neighbourhood was 6,348 

Today, Old Ottawa South is an upper-middle-class area. Proximity to the university has meant that the neighbourhood has been a haven for professors and students, although rising housing prices are driving out the latter. It is also one of Ottawa&#x27;s more politically progressive neighbourhoods and has been a stronghold for the New Democratic Party.

Many neighbourhood businesses line Bank Street, including several pubs, the Mayfair Theatre, and some Lebanese stores towards the Southern end. This section of Bank Street is also well known for its antique stores. As part of a 2004 Bank Street redesign, inlaid metal maple leaves were added to the sidewalks inscribed with the names of Canadian folk musicians. Other new features included the removal of overhead powerlines, &quot;traffic calming&quot; measures, and the addition of more brick to the sidewalks.

==History==
The area was originally settled around 1814 by American and British settlers. In those years, even after the construction of the canal the area was fairly sparsely populated. The larger community south of the Rideau River around the Billings estate exerted more influence over the fledgling community than the city of Ottawa did in those days.

Shortly after Confederation in 1867, a bridge was built over the canal increasing access from the larger city to the north. The area was tentatively called Rideauville at the time. After the turn of the century, the area grew rapidly. Rideauville was incorporated as a police village in 1905 and was annexed to Ottawa in 1907. The streetcar tracks were extended to the area around 1910, again encouraging rapid growth. The old streetcar ran along a route roughly similar to today&#x27;s bus route #7, turning around in what is now Brewer Park. Hopewell School was built around this time.

The architectural style is mostly &quot;Craftsman&quot;, with many houses in the American Foursquare style popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Many of these houses have been upgraded and added to over the years, contributing to the area&#x27;s eclectic style.
Since the 1920s, the streetcars have been replaced by buses, stores have changed, and Carleton University has been constructed on the site of an old garbage dump. Many of the streetscapes and much of the housing has been preserved however.

In the 1920s, the area opened Brighton Beach, a public swimming venue on the shore of the Rideau River. It was opened for residents of the area to conduct water sports and to take swimming lessons. Brighton Beach was officially closed in 1970 due to adherence to new City of Ottawa pollution standards.

Notable buildings include Hopewell Avenue Public School, Southminster Church, St. Margaret Mary Church, Trinity Church, the Mayfair Theatre, the former Precious Blood Convent (now the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada), and the Old Firehall (currently a community centre).

Around 300 residences and institutional buildings are included on Ottawa&#x27;s heritage reference list (an inventory of sites &amp; structures potentially considered for legal protection as cultural heritage resources) from the area.

Old Ottawa South, used to be known simply as &quot;Ottawa South&quot;. The &quot;old&quot; designation came into use in the 1990s to distinguish the community from newer suburban developments in the south of Ottawa. &quot;Old Ottawa South&quot; is quite central and close to downtown by modern (post World War II) standards. The term &quot;Ottawa South&quot; is still in use in some contexts. For example, the community newspaper is The OSCAR, which stands for Ottawa South Community Association Review. Similarly, Old Ottawa South is not to be confused with the parliamentary constituency of Ottawa South. Old Ottawa South is currently located in the federal and provincial constituencies of Ottawa Centre, although Old Ottawa South was within the Ottawa South provincial riding until 1999.

In the fall of 2007, leading up to the 100th anniversary of the annexation of Ottawa South to the City of Ottawa on December 16, 2007, a group of residents founded the Ottawa South History Project (OSHP) to research, document and present facts and anecdotes about the history of the community. The OSHP is an amateur-run historical society which regularly publishes in The OSCAR and maintains a website. The group is also active in supporting the heritage designation of the Mayfair Theatre and is a partner in the Friends of the Mayfair Theatre.

<text>Krazy was a British comic book magazine published every Monday by IPC Magazines Ltd. It ran from (issues dates) 16 October 1976 to 15 April 1978, when it merged with stable-mate &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot;. In 1977, one of the characters in the comic, Cheeky, proved popular enough to get his own comic, &quot;Cheeky&quot;, which was later merged into &quot;Whoopee!&quot;. The comic included a &quot;disguise&quot; back-cover, such as the cover of a diary or brochure, which allowed readers to hide the comic from parents or teachers (although one issue on April Fools&#x27; Day had the front cover upside down).

==Stories==
&quot;Krazy&quot; was noted for its rich content of small humorous jokes and illustrations positioned at random places among the comic strips and features. The central storyline of the comic centred around the exploits of a group of children called the Krazy Gang who lived in Krazy Town, featured in a comic strip drawn by cartoonist Ian Knox. &quot;The Krazy Gang&quot; also spawned spin-off stories within the same publication: &quot;Pongalongapongo&quot;, featuring Pongo Snodgrass, the unhygienic, bullying antagonist; and &quot;″ello, It&#x27;s Cheeky&quot;, a mischievous buck-toothed prankster and Krazy Gang member, drawn by Frank McDiarmid. Cheeky&#x27;s popularity outgrew the spin-off strip, and after a few months the character featured in his own publication, &quot;Cheeky Weekly&quot;, launched in October 1977.

Other strip artists included Robert Nixon and Terry Bave.

Regular &quot;Krazy&quot; comic strips included:

* &quot;″ello, It&#x27;s Cheeky&quot;
* &quot;Big Game Hunter (comic strip)|Big Game Hunter&quot;
* &quot;Birdman and Chicken&quot;
* &quot;Detective Fumbly&#x27;s (Nut) Case Book&quot;, a text story usually with one illustration, rather than a conventional strip
* &quot;Fit Fred and Sick Sid&quot;
* &quot;Handy Andy&quot;
* &quot;Hit Kid&quot;
* &quot;Kid Comic&quot;
* &quot;The Krazy Gang&quot;
* &quot;Micky Mimic&quot;
* &quot;Paws&quot;
* &quot;Pongalongapongo&quot;
* &quot;Ray Presto&quot;
* &quot;Over-Helpful Helen&quot;, a story about a well-meaning young lady that is always poking her nose into other people&#x27;s business
* &quot;Scaredy Cat&quot;
* &quot;The 12½p Buytonic Boy&quot;

<doc id="637660" wikidata="Q6336976" url="?curid=637660" title="KROQ Weenie Roast">
<text>KROQ Weenie Roast is a multi-artist music concert, presented annually in May by the Los Angeles, California, modern rock radio station KROQ-FM. Since its beginning in 1993, it has been traditionally held on a Saturday in May or June, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been no editions of the festival since 2019.

==Overview==
Every year, the KROQ Weenie Roast had taken place at Irvine Meadows/Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre, in Irvine, California with exception in 2000 when it was held at the Angel Stadium, then-known as the Edison International Field, in Anaheim, California. In 2016 Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre was demolished, and KROQ responded by announcing that the 2017 edition would take place at StubHub Center in Carson.

From 2006 to 2009, the event was re-branded as Weenie Roast y Fiesta with the distribution of complimentary sombreros for its festival attendees. In 2012 in conjunction with Cinco de Mayo it returned to the Weenie Roast y Fiesta name again.

Its East Coast &quot;sister&quot; concert, presented by KROQ-FM&#x27;s Baltimore/Washington, DC affiliate station WHFS, is the HFStival. Its northern California &quot;sister&quot; concert, presented by KROQ-FM&#x27;s Bay Area affiliate station KITS, is the BFD festival.

With the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre&#x27;s land lease due to expire in 2017, KROQ-FM announced that the 2016 event would be the last to be held at the venue. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were forced to cancel their headlining slot at the 2016 Weenie Roast, as singer Anthony Kiedis was rushed to the hospital prior to the band appearing on stage, due to severe stomach pain. His bandmates made the official announcement on the stage as they were due to appear. Weezer replaced them as the headlining act.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been no editions of the festival since 2019.

<doc id="637662" wikidata="Q1784748" url="?curid=637662" title="Middle Tennessee State University">
<text>Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU or MT) is a public research university in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Founded in 1911 as a normal school, the university consists of eight undergraduate colleges as well as a college of graduate studies, together offering more than 300 degree programs through more than 35 departments. It is classified among &quot;R2: Universities&quot;.

Prior to 2017, MTSU was governed by the Tennessee Board of Regents and part of the State University and Community College System of Tennessee. In 2017, governance was transferred to an institutional board of trustees. MTSU is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. MTSU athletics programs compete intercollegiately in the NCAA Division I as a member of Conference USA.

==History==
One of the earliest calls for a normal school occurred in 1855 when a Wilson County, Tennessee, politician sought to build a normal school in Lebanon, Tennessee. Education efforts collapsed shortly after the breakout of the American Civil War. Later, state superintendents and teachers traveled around the state giving speeches about the dire need for teacher preparation. In 1909, the Tennessee General Assembly moved establish three teacher-training institutions, one in each of the grand divisions of the state.
Middle Tennessee State Normal School (MTSNS or MTNS) opened on September 11, 1911, with a two-year program for training teachers. It evolved into a four-year teachers&#x27; college by 1925 with the power of granting the Bachelor of Science degree, and the institution&#x27;s name was changed for the first time to Middle Tennessee State Teachers College. The school was often abbreviated as &quot;S.T.C.&quot; In 1943, the General Assembly designated the institution a state college, changing its name for the second time to Middle Tennessee State College. This new status marked a sharp departure from the founding purpose and opened the way for expanding curricular offerings and programs. In 1965, the institution was advanced to university status, changing its name to Middle Tennessee State University. In October 2010, the Student Government Association at MTSU proposed that the university be renamed to the &quot;University of Middle Tennessee&quot;. However, approval from both the university administration and the Tennessee Board of Regents was required and was not granted.

During the progressive movement from a two-year normal to a university, several significant milestones may be identified. In 1936, the Bachelor of Arts program was added. Responding to the expressed needs of the institution&#x27;s service area, the Graduate School was established in 1951. To effect better communications and improve administrative supervision, the schools concept was introduced in 1962.

As Middle Tennessee State University developed and grew, the Doctor of Arts program was added in 1970 and the Specialist in Education in 1974. These degree programs became attractive centerpieces for other efforts to improve and enhance institutional roles. Library resources were dramatically increased and sophisticated computer services were developed to aid instruction and administration. A highly trained faculty enabled the university to continue growth in program offerings. In 1991, the university&#x27;s six schools—five undergraduate and the graduate school—became colleges. In 1998, MTSU&#x27;s Honors program became the Honors College, the first in the state. In 2002, approval was granted to redesignate three D.A. programs to Doctor of Philosophy programs. Ph.D. degree offerings now include computational sciences, mathematics, and science education, molecular biosciences, economics, English, human performance, public history, and literacy studies.

In 1986, James McGill Buchanan (&#x27;40) became the first MT alumnus to be awarded the Nobel Prize. He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his pioneering role in the development of the field of public choice, a way of studying the behavior of politicians and bureaucrats. The MTSU Honors College has named a full-tuition fellowship after James Buchanan; this honor is given to 20 students each year who take specialized courses through the Honors College.

==Colleges==


MTSU is organized into seven colleges:

*College of Basic and Applied Sciences
*College of Behavioral and Health Sciences
*College of Education
*College of Liberal Arts
*College of Media and Entertainment
*Jennings A. Jones College of Business
*University College

==Faculty==
Middle Tennessee State University employs about 1200 faculty members, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 17:1.

==Academics==

===Department of Recording Industry===

The Department of Recording Industry is within the College of Media and Entertainment. The &quot;Rolling Stone College Guide&quot; recognized MTSU as having &quot;one of the preeminent music business programs in the country.&quot;

===Department of Aerospace===

The Department of Aerospace offers an Aerospace Bachelor of Science degree with six concentrations: Aviation Management, Aerospace Technology, Flight Dispatch, Maintenance Management, Professional Pilot, and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).

The Department of Aerospace has a working agreement with the single-runway Murfreesboro Municipal Airport to provide classes on-site. A decommissioned Boeing 727 airliner (donated by FedEx) is housed at the airport as a teaching tool. American Airlines donated a 727 cockpit procedure trainer to MTSU.

The aerospace program&#x27;s training fleet is made up of Diamond DA40 single-engine aircraft featuring glass cockpits, with an assortment of other single- and multi-engine aircraft available. In 2010, the Department of Aerospace purchased ten radar simulators as well as a one-of-a-kind 360 degree control tower simulator to enhance training for its air traffic control students. These simulators allow students to experience lifelike air traffic control scenarios that will aid in preparing them for training at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City.

==Campus==
The campus, set on , features 234 permanent buildings with of space. It is from the geographic center of Tennessee and east of downtown Murfreesboro.

On November 29, 2012, MTSU announced they had accepted an invitation to the conference, and formally became a part of Conference USA on July 1, 2013. The school transferred from the Sun Belt Conference, and had participated in the Ohio Valley Conference before that.

The most prominent athletic facilities on the campus are Johnny &quot;Red&quot; Floyd football stadium, Murphy Center basketball arena, Reese Smith Jr. baseball field, and Alumni Memorial Gym volleyball court. MTSU has won two national championships: golf in 1965, and men&#x27;s doubles tennis in 2007.

<text>Blarmachfoldach (or Blàr Mac Faoilteach; Blàrmacfaoltach) is a small crofting
settlement in Lochaber, in the Highland council area of Scotland. It is located in the Mamore Hills, south of Fort William on the old military road to Kinlochleven. In past centuries, Blarmachfoldach was mainly a Clan Cameron settlement.

Historically, the area spoke Lochaber Gaelic, which had a number of distinctive features.

In the 19th century, Blarmachfoldach had a population of over 800. Reflecting the tragedy that gradually befell the Highlands as a whole, the population has gradually fallen to around 30, the last native dying in 2006. This was exacerbated by the cholera epidemic of the 19th century, when a ship in Loch Linnhe brought contaminated linen.

The Gaelic etymology of the name is not clear. &quot;Blàr&quot; typically refers to a field, often a battlefield, whereas the &quot;faoiltich&quot; are the cold early months of the year, corresponding to &quot;January&quot; (Faoilleach) in modern Gaelic.

Blàr mac Faoltaich is one of the &#x27;four blars&#x27; in the area, comprising Blàr Mac Faoltaich, Blàr a&#x27; Chaorainn, Blàr nan Cléireach, and Blàr Mac Droighnich (also spelt Mac Droighneach, Mac Druineach, and nan Druineach, and meaning the field of the wise men).

The river Cìochnis (Cìoch Innis), shown by Ordnance Survey as &quot;River Kiachnish&quot;, which originates in Lochan Lùnn dà-Bhrà, (Loch Lundavra) and passes through Blàr Mac Faoilteach, was the source of hydro-electric power for the first electric street lighting in Scotland, in nearby Fort William high street. The ruins of the turbine house and a bridge to cross the river (although dangerous to cross now) are still here to see today.

The West Highland Way passes through the clachan near one of its two endpoints.

Blar Mac Faoilteach was known locally as one of the last places to celebrate the old Highland New Year on January 12.

<text>The Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) was a specification created by W3C that used metadata to label webpages to help parents and teachers control what children and students could access on the Internet. The W3C Protocol for Web Description Resources project integrates PICS concepts with RDF. PICS was superseded by POWDER, which itself is no longer actively developed. PICS often used content labeling from the Internet Content Rating Association, which has also been discontinued by the Family Online Safety Institute&#x27;s board of directors. An alternative self-rating system, named Voluntary Content Rating, was devised by Solid Oak Software in 2010, in response to the perceived complexity of PICS.

Internet Explorer 3 was one of the early web browsers to offer support for PICS, released in 1996. Internet Explorer 5 added a feature called &quot;approved sites&quot;, that allowed extra sites to be added to the list in addition to the PICS list when it was being used.

<text>Limuru is a town in central Kenya. It serves as both a parliamentary constituency and an administrative division. As of 2004, the town&#x27;s population was approximately 4,800, which significantly increased to 159,314 by the 2019 census.

==Location==
Limuru is a town located on the eastern edge of the Great Rift Valley about , by road, northwest of Nairobi. The geographical coordinates of Limuru town are:1°06&#x27;28.0&quot;S, 36°38&#x27;34.0&quot;E (Latitude:-1.107778; Longitude:36.642778).

== History ==
The native language of most people in Limuru is Kikuyu, with Swahili and English also widely used.

Historically, Limuru served as the capital of Kiambu West District, which was part of the larger Kiambu District. It is now a sub county in Kiambu County and also the name of a parliament constituency.

Limuru encompasses areas previously known as the &quot;white highlands,&quot; a rich agricultural land south of the equator. The term &quot;white highlands&quot; derived from the British and other Europeans who realised the productive potential of this area and settled in large numbers with the support of the colonial government, establishing coffee and tea plantations, cereal farms and ranches. The town is at an altitude of about 2,500 meters and experiences temperature of 10–28 °C (75 °F) year round.

There is a railway station in Limuru town.

== Industry ==
Limuru is a key area of tea production and processing, with major factories such as Karirana Tea Estates and Mabroukie Teas Estates on the outskirts of the town.The tea plantations established around Limuru from 1903 onwards were the foundation of Kenya&#x27;s tea industry. 

The town is also home to the BATA shoe company, the largest shoe factory in East and Central Africa. In recent years, more companies have established themselves in the town, including Procter and Allan, polypipes and Fruit &#x27;n&#x27; Juice.

The Nest Children&#x27;s Home, which offers care services for children whose mothers are imprisoned, is located in Limuru town.

Limuru has a rich history tied with the railway, the tea industry (especially with major expansion from the 1920s), and the Bata shoe factory and head office.

The town also serves as a milk processing zone obtained from the small-scale dairy farming in the surrounding area.

==People==
Limuru residents rely mostly on farming and a shoe factory for employment. Early in the British colonial period (from the 1890s) Europeans settled in the area due to its proximity to Nairobi, the railway, its fertile land and pleasant weather. It is the birthplace of the African writer, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o, as well as that of Bishop Caesar Gatimu and human rights and political activist Percy Faith Fawaki (Zartaj).

==Health care==
Limuru town is served by the government-run &quot;Limuru Health Center&quot; which is located within the town limits. Other health facilities serving Limuru residents include Rwamburi Dispensary, Rironi Dispensary, Thigio Dispensary, Ndeiya Health Center and Ngecha Health Center. Tigoni District Hospital is the main government hospital and serves as the link facility between the rural health facilities and the main National referral hospital.
Health care has seen an improvement in quality of services with the collaboration of other stakeholders. Services such as cervical cancer screening by VIA/VILLI is available at all government run facilities in Limuru. The nurses working in these clinics also conduct outreach programs to ensure more women are screened. Uptake of long-term contraceptive methods such as implants and IUCDs has also improved due to intensive community education and outreach programs undertaken by the staff working in the various government health facilities. It is for this reason that &quot;Ndeiya Health Center&quot; was confirmed the center of excellence in addressing family planning and cervical cancer screening in East and Central Africa. Ndeiya Health Center has mentored other health facilities in the area including Rwamburi Dispensary with an aim of replicating the success in the same. Constituency development fund has funded the construction of three rural facilities in the area. These are: Rwamburi Dispensary, Rironi Dispensary and Ngecha Health Center. Also, there are several private hospitals in Limuru.

Community strategy has been implemented in the area and community units such as Ndiuni community unit has been conducting various community health activities. These community units are linked to their respective health facilities where they refer patients.

==Recent developments==
Due to its proximity to Nairobi and its location on the main highway linking Nairobi to other towns like Naivasha, Eldoret and Kisumu, Limuru is attracting investors and businesses. In July 2014, developers of a new shopping mall broke ground. This will be the first mall in the town. Tuskys, the number two supermarket chain in Kenya by sales, will be the anchor tenant, taking up about 50% of the rental space. The development is expected to cost KSh650 million (approx. US$7.5 million) to construct, and is expected to be ready during the second half of 2018. The number three supermarket chain in the country, naivas together with Society Stores have opened new stores in Limuru during the year 2016 &amp; 2017 respectively. The new supermarkets will join others such as &quot;Cleanshelf&quot;, the then major supermarket in the town, as at January 2015. The Great Kenyan Bake Off, the Kenyan version of The Great British Bake Off, was filmed at Limuru.

<text>The Molly Maguires was an Irish 19th-century secret society active in Ireland, Liverpool, and parts of the eastern United States, best known for their activism among Irish-American and Irish immigrant coal miners in Pennsylvania. After a series of often violent conflicts, twenty suspected members of the Molly Maguires were convicted of murder and other crimes and were executed by hanging in 1877 and 1878. This history remains part of local Pennsylvania lore and the actual facts are much debated among historians.

==Ireland==
The Molly Maguires originated in Ireland, where secret societies with names such as Whiteboys and Peep o&#x27; Day Boys were common beginning in the 18th century and through most of the 19th century. In some areas the terms &quot;Ribbonmen&quot; and &quot;Molly Maguires&quot; were both used for similar activism but at different times. The main distinction between the two appears to be that the Ribbonmen were regarded as &quot;secular, cosmopolitan, and proto-nationalist&quot;, with the Molly Maguires considered &quot;rural, local, and Gaelic&quot;.

Agrarian rebellion in Ireland can be traced to local concerns and grievances relating to land usage, particularly as traditional socioeconomic practices such as small-scale potato cultivation were supplanted by the fencing and pasturing of land (known as enclosure). Agrarian resistance often took the form of fence destruction, night-time ploughing of croplands that had been converted to pasture, and killing, mutilating, or driving off livestock. In areas where the land had long been dedicated to small-scale, growing-season leases of farmland, called conacre, opposition was conceived as &quot;retributive justice&quot; that was intended &quot;to correct transgressions against traditional moral and social codes&quot;.

The victims of agrarian violence were frequently Irish land agents, middlemen, and tenants. Merchants and millers were often threatened or attacked if their prices were high. Landlords&#x27; agents were threatened, beaten, and assassinated. New tenants on lands secured by evictions also became targets. Local leaders were reported to have sometimes dressed as women, i.e., as mothers begging for food for their children. The leader might approach a storekeeper and demand a donation of flour or groceries. If the storekeeper failed to provide, the Mollies would enter the store and take what they wanted, warning the owner of dire consequences if the incident was reported.

While the Whiteboys were known to wear white linen frocks over their clothing, the Mollies blackened their faces with burnt cork. There are similarities—particularly in face-blackening and in the donning of women&#x27;s garments—with the practice of mummery, in which festive days were celebrated by mummers who travelled from door to door demanding food, money, or drink as payment for performing. The &quot;Threshers&quot;, the &quot;Peep o&#x27; Day Boys&quot;, the &quot;Lady Rocks&quot; (deriving from Captain Rock and the Rockite movement), and the &quot;Lady Clares&quot; also sometimes disguised themselves as women. Similar imagery was used during the Rebecca Riots in Wales.

British and Irish newspapers reported about the Mollies in Ireland in the nineteenth century. Thomas Campbell Foster in &quot;The Times&quot; on 25 August 1845 traced the commencement of &quot;Molly Maguireism&quot; to Lord Lorton ejecting tenants in Ballinamuck, County Longford, in 1835. An &quot;Address of &#x27;Molly Maguire&#x27; to her children&quot; containing twelve rules was published in &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; on 7 July 1845. The person making the address claimed to be &quot;Molly Maguire&quot; of &quot;Maguire&#x27;s Grove, Parish of Cloone&quot;, in County Leitrim. The rules advised Mollies about how they should conduct themselves in land disputes and were an attempt to direct the movement&#x27;s activities:
* Keep strictly to the land question, by allowing no landlord more than fair value for his tenure.
* No Rent to be paid until harvest.
* Not even then without an abatement, where the land is too high.
* No undermining of tenants, nor bailiff&#x27;s fees to be paid.
* No turning out of tenants, unless two years rent due before ejectment served.
* Assist to the utmost of your power the good landlord, in getting his rents.
* Cherish and respect the good landlord, and good agent.
* Keep from travelling by night.
* Take no arms by day, or by night, from any man, as from such acts a deal of misfortune springs, having, I trust you have, more arms than you ever will have need for.
* Avoid coming in contact with either the military, or police; they are only doing what they cannot help.
* For my sake, then, no distinction to any man, on account of his religion; his acts alone you are to look to.
* Let bygones be bygones, unless in a very glaring case; but watch for the time to come.

==Liverpool==
The Molly Maguires were also active in Liverpool, England, where many Irish people settled in the 19th century, and many more passed through Liverpool on their way to the United States or Canada. The Mollies are first mentioned in Liverpool in an article in &quot;The Liverpool Mercury&quot; newspaper on 10 May 1853. The newspaper reported that, &quot;a regular faction fight took place in Marybone amongst the Irish residents in that district. About 200 men and women assembled, who were divided into four parties—the &#x27;Molly Maguires&#x27;, the &#x27;Kellys&#x27;, the &#x27;Fitzpatricks&#x27; and the &#x27;Murphys&#x27;—the greater number of whom were armed with sticks and stones. The three latter sections were opposed to the &#x27;Molly Maguires&#x27; and the belligerents were engaged in hot conflict for about half an hour, when the guardians of the peace interfered.&quot;

Later Liverpool newspaper articles from the same time period refer to assaults by Mollies against other Irish Liverpudlians. The &quot;Molly Maguire club&quot; or &quot;Molly&#x27;s Club&quot; was described as a &quot;mutual defence association&quot; that had been &quot;formed for the mutual assistance of the members when they got into &#x27;trouble&#x27;, each member subscribing to the funds&quot;. Patrick Flynn was the secretary of the Liverpool Molly Maguire Clubs in the 1850s and their headquarters was in an alehouse in Alexander Pope Street also known as Sawney Pope Street. The Liverpool branch of the Molly Maguires was known for its gangsterism rather than any genuine concern for the welfare of Irish people.

==United States==

The Mollies are believed to have been present in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania in the United States since at least the Panic of 1873 until becoming largely inactive following a series of arrests, trials and executions, between 1876 and 1878. Members of the Mollies were accused of murder, arson, kidnapping, and other crimes, in part based on allegations by Franklin B. Gowen and the testimony of a Pinkerton detective, James McParland (also known as &quot;James McKenna&quot;), a native of County Armagh, Ireland. Fellow prisoners testified against the defendants, who were arrested by the Coal and Iron Police. Gowen acted as a prosecutor in some of the trials.

The trusts seem to have focused almost exclusively upon the Molly Maguires for criminal prosecution. Information passed from the Pinkerton detective, intended only for the detective agency and their client—the most powerful industrialist of the region—was also provided to vigilantes who ambushed and murdered miners suspected of being Molly Maguires, as well as their families. Molly Maguire history is sometimes presented as the prosecution of an underground movement that was motivated by personal vendettas, and sometimes as a struggle between organized labour and powerful industrial forces. Whether membership in the Mollies&#x27; society overlapped with union membership to any appreciable extent remains open to conjecture.

Some historians (such as Philip Rosen, former curator of the Holocaust Awareness Museum of the Delaware Valley) believe that Irish immigrants brought a form of the Molly Maguires organization into America in the 19th century, and continued its activities as a clandestine society. They were located in a section of the anthracite coal fields dubbed the Coal Region, which included the Pennsylvania counties of Lackawanna, Luzerne, Columbia, Schuylkill, Carbon, and Northumberland. Irish miners in this organization employed the tactics of intimidation and violence used against Irish landlords during the &quot;Land Wars&quot; yet again in violent confrontations against the anthracite, or &quot;hard coal&quot;, mining companies in the 19th century.

===Historians&#x27; disagreement===
A legal self-help organization for Irish immigrants existed in the form of the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH), but it is generally accepted that the Mollies existed as a secret organization in Pennsylvania, and used the AOH as a front. However, Joseph Rayback&#x27;s 1966 volume, &quot;A History of American Labor&quot;, claims the &quot;identity of the Molly Maguires has never been proved&quot;. Rayback writes: 

Authors who accept the existence of the Mollies as a violent and destructive group acknowledge a significant scholarship that questions the entire history. In &quot;The Pinkerton Story&quot;, authors James D. Horan and Howard Swiggett write sympathetically about the detective agency and its mission to bring the Mollies to justice. They observe:

===History===
During the mid-19th century, hard coal mining came to dominate northeastern Pennsylvania, a region already deforested twice over to feed America&#x27;s growing need for energy. By the 1870s, powerful financial syndicates controlled the railroads and the coalfields. Coal companies had begun to recruit immigrants from overseas willing to work for less than the prevailing local wages paid to American-born employees, luring them with &quot;promises of fortune-making&quot;. Herded into freight trains by the hundreds, these workers often replaced English-speaking miners who, according to labour historian George Korson:

The immigrant workers:

About 22,000 coal miners worked in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. 5,500 of these were children between the ages of seven and sixteen years, who earned between one and three dollars a week separating slate from coal. Injured miners, or those too old to work at the face, were assigned to picking slate at the &quot;breakers&quot; where the coal was crushed into a manageable size. Thus, many of the elderly miners finished their mining days as they had begun in their youth. The miners lived a life of &quot;bitter, terrible struggle&quot;.

====Disaster strikes====
Wages were low, working conditions were atrocious, and deaths and serious injuries numbered in the hundreds each year. On 6 September 1869, a fire at the Avondale Mine in Luzerne County, took the lives of 110 coal miners. The families blamed the coal company for failing to finance a secondary exit for the mine.

The miners faced a speedup system that was exhausting. In its November 1877 issue, &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; published an interviewer&#x27;s comments: &quot;A miner tells me that he often brought his food uneaten out of the mine from want of time; for he must have his car loaded when the driver comes for it, or lose one of the seven car-loads which form his daily work.&quot;

As the bodies of the miners were brought up from the Avondale Mine disaster, John Siney, head of the Workingmen&#x27;s Benevolent Association (WBA), climbed onto a wagon to speak to the thousands of miners who had arrived from surrounding communities:
Siney asked the miners to join the union, and thousands did so that day. Some miners faced additional burdens of prejudice and persecution. In the 1840s, 1850s, and 1860s, some 20,000 Irish workers had arrived in Schuylkill County. It was a time of rampant beatings and murders in the mining district.

====Panic of 1873====
The period between 1873 and 1879 (see Panic of 1873) was marked by one of the worst depressions in the nation&#x27;s history, caused by economic overexpansion, a stock market crash, and a decrease in the money supply. By 1877 an estimated one-fifth of the nation&#x27;s workingmen were completely unemployed, two-fifths worked no more than six or seven months a year, and only one-fifth had full-time jobs. Labor organizers angrily watched railway directors riding about the country in luxurious private cars while proclaiming their inability to pay living wages to hungry working men.

====Mine owners move against the union====

Franklin B. Gowen, the president of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway, and of the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company and &quot;the wealthiest anthracite coal mine owner in the world&quot;, hired Allan Pinkerton&#x27;s services to deal with the Mollies. Pinkerton selected James McParland (sometimes called McParlan), a native of County Armagh, to go undercover against the Mollies. Using the alias &quot;James McKenna&quot;, he made Shenandoah his headquarters and claimed to have become a trusted member of the organization. His assignment was to collect evidence of murder plots and intrigue, passing this information along to his Pinkerton manager. He also began working secretly with a Pinkerton agent assigned to the Coal and Iron Police for the purpose of coordinating the eventual arrest and prosecution of members of the Molly Maguires. Although there had been fifty &quot;inexplicable murders&quot; between 1863 and 1867 in Schuylkill County, progress in the investigations was slow. There was &quot;a lull in the entire area, broken only by minor shootings&quot;. McParland wrote: I am sick and tired of this thing. I seem to make no progress.

The union had grown powerful; thirty thousand members—eighty-five percent of Pennsylvania&#x27;s anthracite miners—had joined. But Gowen had built a combination of his own, bringing all of the mine operators into an employers&#x27; association known as the Anthracite Board of Trade. In addition to the railroad, Gowen owned two-thirds of the coal mines in southeastern Pennsylvania. He was a risk-taker and an ambitious man. Gowen decided to force a strike and showdown.

====Union, Mollies, and Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH)====
One of the burning questions for modern scholars is the relationship between the Workingmen&#x27;s Benevolent Association (WBA), the Mollies, and their alleged cover organization, the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Historian Kevin Kenny notes that the convicted men were all members of the AOH. But &quot;the Molly Maguires themselves left virtually no evidence of their existence, let alone their aims and motivation.&quot; Relying upon his personal knowledge before commencing an investigation, McParland believed that the Molly Maguires, under pressure for their activities, had taken the new name, &quot;The Ancient Order of Hibernians&quot; (AOH). After beginning his investigation, he estimated that there were about 450 members of the AOH in Schuylkill County.

While Kenny observes that the AOH was &quot;a peaceful fraternal society&quot;, he does note that in the 1870s the Pinkerton Agency identified a correlation between the areas of AOH membership in Pennsylvania, and the corresponding areas in Ireland from which those particular Irish immigrants emigrated. The violence-prone areas of Ireland corresponded to areas of violence in the Pennsylvania coalfields. 

In his book &quot;Big Trouble&quot;, which traces McParland&#x27;s history, writer J. Anthony Lukas has written: &quot;The WBA was run by Lancashire men adamantly opposed to violence. But [Gowen] saw an opportunity to paint the union with the Molly brush, which he did in testimony before a state investigating committee ... &#x27;I do not charge this Workingmen&#x27;s Benevolent Association with it, but I say there is an association which votes in secret, at night, that men&#x27;s lives shall be taken ... I do not blame this association, but I blame another association for doing it; and it happens that the only men who are shot are the men who dare disobey the mandates of the Workingmen&#x27;s Benevolent Association.&#x27;&quot;

Of the 450 AOH members that Pinkerton Agent McParland estimated were in Schuylkill County, about 400 belonged to the union. Molly Maguireism and full-fledged trade unionism represented fundamentally different modes of organization and protest. Kenny noted that one contemporary organization, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Industrial Statistics, clearly distinguished between the union and the violence attributed to the Molly Maguires. Their reports indicate that violence could be traced to the time of the Civil War, but that in the five-year existence of the WBA, &quot;the relations existing between employers and employees&quot; had greatly improved. The Bureau concluded that the union had brought an end to the &quot;carnival of crime&quot;. Kenny notes the leaders of the WBA were &quot;always unequivocally opposed&quot; to the Molly Maguires.

Kenny notes there were frequent tensions between miners of English and Welsh descent, who held the majority of skilled positions, and the mass of unskilled Irish labourers. However, in spite of such differences, the WBA offered a solution, and for the most part &quot;did a remarkable job&quot; in overcoming such differences.
====Vigilante justice====

F.P. Dewees, a contemporary and a confidant of Gowen, wrote that, by 1873, &quot;Mr. Gowen was fully impressed with the necessity of lessening the overgrown power of the &#x27;Labor Union&#x27; and exterminating if possible the Molly Maguires.&quot; In December 1874, Gowen led the other coal operators to announce a twenty percent pay cut. The miners decided to strike on 1 January 1875.

A Pinkerton agent, Robert J. Linden, was brought in to support McParland while serving with the Coal and Iron Police. On 29 August 1875, Allan Pinkerton wrote a letter to George Bangs, Pinkerton&#x27;s general superintendent, recommending vigilante actions against the Molly Maguires: &quot;The M.M.&#x27;s are a species of Thugs... Let Linden get up a vigilance committee. It will not do to get many men, but let him get those who are prepared to take fearful revenge on the M.M.&#x27;s. I think it would open the eyes of all the people and then the M.M.&#x27;s would meet with their just deserts.&quot; On 10 December 1875, three men and two women were attacked in their home by masked men. Author Anthony Lukas wrote that the attack seemed &quot;to reflect the strategy outlined in Pinkerton&#x27;s memo&quot;.

The victims had been secretly identified by McParland as Mollies. One of the men was killed in the house, and the other two supposed Mollies were wounded but able to escape. A woman, the wife of one of the reputed Mollies, was assassinated. 

McParland was outraged that the information he had been providing had found its way into the hands of indiscriminate killers. When McParland heard details of the attack at the house, he protested in a letter to his Pinkerton supervisor. He did not object that Mollies might be assassinated as a result of his labor spying—they &quot;got their just deserving&quot;. McParland resigned when it became apparent the vigilantes were willing to commit the &quot;murder of women and children&quot;, whom he deemed innocent victims. His letter stated: There appears to be an error in the detective&#x27;s report, which also constituted his resignation letter, of the vigilante incident: he failed to convey the correct number of deaths. Two of the three men &quot;were wounded but able to escape&quot;. In the note, McParland reported that these two had been killed by vigilantes. Such notes, possibly containing erroneous or as-yet-unverified information, were forwarded daily by Pinkerton operatives. The content was routinely made available to Pinkerton clients in typed reports. Pinkerton detective reports now in the manuscripts collection at the Lackawanna County Historical Society reveal that Pinkerton had been spying on miners for the mine owners in Scranton. Pinkerton operatives were required to send a report each day. The daily reports were typed by staff, and conveyed to the client for a ten-dollar fee. Such a process was relied upon to &quot;warrant the continuance of the operative&#x27;s services&quot;.

McParland believed his daily reports had been made available to the anti-Molly vigilantes. Benjamin Franklin, McParland&#x27;s Pinkerton supervisor, declared himself &quot;anxious to satisfy [McParland] that [the Pinkerton Agency has] nothing to do with [the vigilante murders.]&quot; McParland was prevailed upon not to resign. Frank Wenrich, a first lieutenant with the Pennsylvania National Guard, was arrested as the leader of the vigilante attackers, but released on bail. Another miner, Hugh McGeehan, a 21-year-old who had been secretly identified as a killer by McParland, was fired upon and wounded by unknown assailants. Later, the McGeehan family&#x27;s house was attacked by gunfire.

====The strike fails====
The union was nearly broken by the imprisonment of its leadership and by attacks conducted by vigilantes against the strikers. Gowen &quot;deluged the newspapers with stories of murder and arson&quot; committed by the Molly Maguires. The press produced stories of strikes in Illinois, in Jersey City, and in the Ohio minefields, all inspired by the Mollies. The stories were widely believed. In Schuylkill County, the striking miners and their families were starving to death. A striker wrote to a friend: Since I last saw you, I have buried my youngest child, and on the day before its death there was not one bit of victuals in the house with six children.

Andrew Roy in his book &quot;A History of the Coal Miners of the United States&quot; noted:
After six months, the strike was defeated and the miners returned to work, accepting the 20 percent cut in pay. But miners belonging to the Ancient Order of Hibernians continued the fight. McParland acknowledged increasing support for the Mollies in his reports: Men, who last winter would not notice a Molly Maguire, are now glad to take them by the hand and make much of them. If the bosses exercise tyranny over the men they appear to look to the association for help. Lukas observes that the defeat was humiliating, and traces the roots of violence by the Mollies in the aftermath of the failed strike: Judges, lawyers, and policemen were overwhelmingly Welsh, German, or English ... When the coalfield Irish sought to remedy their grievances through the courts, they often met delays, obfuscation, or doors slammed in their faces. No longer looking to these institutions for justice, they turned instead to the Mollies... Before the summer was over, six men—all Welsh or German—paid with their lives.

Authors Richard O. Boyer and Herbert M. Morais argue that the killings were not one-sided:

====McParland penetrates the &quot;inner circle&quot;====
After months of little progress, McParland reported some plans by the &quot;inner circle&quot;. Gomer James, a Welshman, had shot and wounded one of the Mollies, and plans were formulated for a revenge killing. But the wheels of revenge were grinding slowly. And there was other violence:

A plan to destroy a railroad bridge was abandoned due to the presence of outsiders. The Irish miners had been forbidden to set foot in the public square in Mahanoy City, and a plan to occupy it by force of arms was considered and then abandoned. In the meantime, a messenger reported that [W.M.] Thomas, the would-be killer of one of the Mollies, had been killed in the stable where he worked. McParland himself had been asked to supply the hidden killers with food and whiskey, according to the detective. According to Horan and Swiggett:

Another plan was in the works, this one against two night watchmen, Pat McCarron and Benjamin Franklin Yost, a Tamaqua Borough Patrolman. Jimmy Kerrigan and Thomas Duffy were said to despise Yost, who had arrested them on numerous occasions. Yost was shot as he put out a street light, which at that time necessitated climbing the lamp pole. Before he died, he reported that his killers were Irish, but were not Kerrigan or Duffy. McParland recorded that a Mollie named William Love had killed a Justice of the Peace, surnamed Gwyther, in Girardville. Unknown Mollies were accused of wounding a man outside his saloon in Shenandoah. Gomer James was killed while tending bar. Then, McParland recorded, a group of Mollies reported to him that they had killed a mine boss named Sanger, and another man who was with him. Forewarned of the attempt, McParland had sought to arrange protection for the mine boss, but was unsuccessful.

====The trials====
When Gowen first hired the Pinkerton agency, he had claimed the Molly Maguires were so powerful they had made powerful financial sources and organized labour &quot;their puppets&quot;. When the trials of the alleged puppet masters opened, Gowen had himself appointed as special prosecutor.

The first trials were for the killing of John P. Jones. The three defendants, Michael J. Doyle, Jimmy Kerrigan and Edward Kelly, had elected to receive separate trials. Doyle went first, with his trial beginning 18 January 1876, and a conviction for first-degree murder being returned on 1 February. Before the trial was completed, Kerrigan had decided to become a state&#x27;s witness and gave details about the murders of Jones and Yost. Kelly&#x27;s trial began on 27 March, and ended in conviction on 6 April 1876.

The first trial of defendants McGeehan, Carroll, Duffy, James Boyle, and James Roarity for the killing of Yost commenced in May 1876. Yost had not recognized the men who attacked him. Although Kerrigan has since been described, along with Duffy, as hating the night watchman enough to plot his murder, Kerrigan became a state&#x27;s witness and testified against the union leaders and other miners.

However, Kerrigan&#x27;s wife testified in the courtroom that her husband had committed the murder. She testified that she refused to provide her husband with clothing while he was in prison, because he had &quot;picked innocent men to suffer for his crime&quot;. She stated that she was speaking out voluntarily, and was only interested in telling the truth about the murder. Gowen cross-examined her, but could not shake her testimony. Others supported her testimony amid speculation that Kerrigan was receiving special treatment due to the fact that McParland was engaged to his sister-in-law, Mary Ann Higgins. 

This trial was declared a mistrial due to the death of one of the jurors. A new trial was granted two months later. During that trial, Fanny Kerrigan did not testify. The five defendants were sentenced to death. Kerrigan was allowed to go free. The trial of Tom Munley for the murders of Thomas Sanger, a mine foreman, and William Uren, relied entirely on the testimony of McParland, and the eyewitness account of a witness. The witness stated under oath that he had seen the murderer clearly, and that Munley was not the murderer. Yet the jury accepted McParland&#x27;s testimony that Munley had privately confessed to the murder. Munley was sentenced to death. 

Another four miners were put on trial and were found guilty on a charge of murder. McParland had no direct evidence, but had recorded that the four admitted their guilt to him. Kelly was being held in a cell for murder, and he was reputedly quoted as saying: &quot;I would squeal on Jesus Christ to get out of here.&quot; In return for his testimony, the murder charge against him was dismissed.

In November, McAllister was convicted. McParland&#x27;s testimony in the Molly Maguires trials helped send ten men to the gallows. The defence attorneys repeatedly sought to portray McParland as an agent provocateur who was responsible for not warning people of their imminent deaths. For his part, McParland testified that the AOH and the Mollies were one and the same, and the defendants were guilty of the murders. 

In 1905, during the Colorado Labor Wars, in preparation for a trial, McParland told another witness, Harry Orchard, that &quot;Kelly the Bum&quot; not only had won his freedom for testifying against union leaders, he had been given $1,000 (~$ in ) to &quot;subsidize a new life abroad&quot;. McParland had been attempting to convince Orchard to accuse Bill Haywood, leader of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), of conspiracy to commit another murder. Unlike the Mollies, the WFM&#x27;s union leadership was acquitted. Orchard alone was convicted, and spent the rest of his life in prison.

====The executions====

On 21 June 1877, six men were hanged in the prison at Pottsville, and four at Mauch Chunk, Carbon County. A scaffold had been erected in the Carbon County Jail. State militia with fixed bayonets surrounded the prisons and the scaffolds. Miners arrived with their wives and children from the surrounding areas, walking through the night to honour the accused, and by nine o&#x27;clock &quot;the crowd in Pottsville stretched as far as one could see.&quot; The families were silent, which was &quot;the people&#x27;s way of paying tribute&quot; to those about to die. 

Thomas Munley&#x27;s aged father had walked more than from Gilberton to assure his son that he believed in his innocence. Munley&#x27;s wife arrived a few minutes after they closed the gate, and they refused to open it even for close relatives to say their final goodbyes. She screamed at the gate with grief, throwing herself against it until she collapsed, but she was not allowed to pass. Four (Alexander Campbell, John &quot;Yellow Jack&quot; Donahue, Michael J. Doyle and Edward J. Kelly) were hanged on 21 June 1877, at a Carbon County prison in Mauch Chunk (renamed Jim Thorpe in 1953), for the murders of John P. Jones and Morgan Powell, both mine bosses, following a trial later described by a Carbon County judge, John P. Lavelle, as follows:
Campbell, just before his execution, allegedly slapped a muddy handprint on his cell wall stating &quot;There is proof of my words. That mark of mine will never be wiped out. It will remain forever to shame the county for hanging an innocent man.&quot; Doyle and Hugh McGeehan were led to the scaffold. They were followed by Thomas Munley, James Carroll, James Roarity, James Boyle, Thomas Duffy, Kelly, Campbell, and &quot;Yellow Jack&quot; Donahue. Judge Dreher presided over the trials. 

Ten more condemned, Thomas Fisher, John &quot;Black Jack&quot; Kehoe, Patrick Hester, Peter McHugh, Patrick Tully, Peter McManus, Dennis Donnelly, Martin Bergan, James McDonnell and Charles Sharpe, were hanged at Mauch Chunk, Pottsville, Bloomsburg and Sunbury over the next two years. Peter McManus was the last Molly Maguire to be tried and convicted for murder at the Northumberland County Courthouse in 1878.

====Rhodes&#x27;s account of the Mollies====
Many accounts of the Molly Maguires that were written during, or shortly after, the period offer no admission that there was widespread violence in the area, that vigilantism existed, nor that violence was carried out &quot;against&quot; the miners. In 1910, industrialist and historian James Ford Rhodes published a major scholarly analysis in the leading professional history journal:

====The aftermath====
When organized labour helped elect Terence V. Powderly as mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania two years after the Molly Maguire trials, the opposition vilified his team as the &quot;Molly Maguire Ticket&quot;.

In 1979, Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp granted a posthumous pardon to John &quot;Black Jack&quot; Kehoe after an investigation by the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons. The request for a pardon was made by one of Kehoe&#x27;s descendants. John Kehoe had proclaimed his innocence until his death. The Board recommended the pardon after investigating Kehoe&#x27;s trial and the circumstances surrounding it. Shapp praised Kehoe, saying the men called &quot;Molly Maguires&quot; were &quot;martyrs to labour&quot; and heroes in the struggle to establish a union and fair treatment for workers. And &quot;... [I]t is impossible for us to imagine the plight of the 19th Century miners in Pennsylvania&#x27;s anthracite region&quot; and that it was Kehoe&#x27;s popularity among the miners that led Gowen &quot;&#x27;to fear, despise and ultimately destroy [him]&#x27;&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes novel &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; is partly based on James McParland&#x27;s infiltration of the Mollies.
* &quot;The Molly Maguires&quot;, a feature film starring Richard Harris as James McParland and Sean Connery as Molly leader Jack Kehoe was released in 1970.
* A 1965 episode of &quot;The Big Valley&quot; titled &quot;Heritage&quot; portrayed the Mollies as active at a fictitious mine in the Sierra in the 1870s, in which the Irish miners protest the use of Chinese labourers during a mine strike.
* George Korson, a folklorist and journalist, wrote several songs on the topic including his composition &quot;Minstrels of the Mine Patch&quot;, which has a section on the Molly Maguires: &quot;Coal Dust on the Fiddle&quot;.
* Irish folk band The Dubliners have a song called &quot;Molly Maguires&quot;.
* The Irish Rovers&#x27; song, &quot;Lament for the Molly Maguires&quot;, is on their album &quot;Upon a Shamrock Shore&quot;.
* They were mentioned by Dr. Donald &quot;Ducky&quot; Mallard and Special Agent Jack Sloane on The Season 17 episode of NCIS entitled &quot;Musical Chairs&quot;

<text>Amy Madison is a fictional character on the American television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; portrayed by Elizabeth Anne Allen. The character appears in every season of &quot;Buffy&quot; except the fifth.

In the show, Amy is a witch. Although initially a seemingly good-natured individual, Amy gradually begins misusing her magic, eventually becoming an enemy to Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and her friends. In the series&#x27; comic book continuation, the character is a villain.

==Appearances==

===Television===
Amy is a classmate of Buffy Summers at Sunnydale High School. In junior high, she would often go over to Willow&#x27;s house to escape her mother&#x27;s abuse. The character first appears in the first season episode &quot;Witch&quot;, when she and Buffy both try out for the cheerleading squad. At first, Amy performs poorly in the tryouts, but a series of strange injuries to other contestants move her up in the standings. Amy&#x27;s mother Catherine, a very powerful witch, has switched bodies with Amy because she wants to relive her youth. Buffy and the Scooby Gang succeed in restoring Amy to her own body and (unknown to them) trapping her mother in the cheerleading trophy she won while a cheerleader for Sunnydale High. Afterward, Amy talks to Buffy and mentions that she is now living with her father and step-mother, and that she is much happier.

The character appears as a Sunnydale student in other episodes. In the second season episode &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot;, Xander Harris discovers that Amy inherited her mother&#x27;s power. Xander blackmails Amy into helping him perform a love spell on Cordelia Chase, however, the spell goes awry and causes the entire female population of Sunnydale, except Cordelia, to become infatuated with Xander. Under the influence of her own spell, a jealous Amy invokes the goddess Hecate and temporarily turns Buffy into a rat. Eventually, Rupert Giles forces Amy to undo both spells.

In season 3, the character has joined a coven with Willow (now a practicing witch) and warlock Michael Czajak. In the episode &quot;Gingerbread&quot;, the parents of Sunnydale (under the influence of the demonic Hans and Greta) become paranoid about the supernatural&#x27;s influence on their children, and prepare to burn Amy, Buffy, and Willow at the stake. To escape her bonds, Amy turns herself into a rat, but is then unable to remove her own spell. Willow captures Rat-Amy and keeps her in a cage. Willow makes several unsuccessful attempts to return Amy to human form over the next two seasons. In the season 4 episode &quot;Something Blue&quot;, Willow accidentally turns Amy back into a human, but Willow does not notice, and accidentally changes the character back into a rat. Doug Petrie, a writer on the show, describes this series of events as &quot;as cruel and funny as anything could be&quot;.

By the sixth season, Willow has become an extremely powerful witch and permanently &quot;de-rats&quot; Amy. The two become friends again, though Amy now seems to be drastically different. The character had been involved with the warlock Rack before becoming a rat. Amy gets Willow involved, leading her to become addicted to black magic. Later, when Willow decides to give up magic, Amy casts a spell on her, causing her to magically manipulate everything she touches for a while; Willow complains that Amy&#x27;s actions are encumbering her attempts to quit magic. As a result, Willow cuts Amy out of her life entirely.

Amy&#x27;s final appearance in the television series occurs in the season 7 episode &quot;The Killer in Me.&quot; Elizabeth Anne Allen said, &quot;I think after all the things that she went through, there were a lot of reasons why she was so angry.&quot;

Having physically transformed into Warren Mears, whom she tortured and flayed in a rage over the murder of her girlfriend Tara Maclay, Willow seeks help from the UC Sunnydale Wicca Group and discovers that Amy is a member. Amy explains that she had hit &quot;rock bottom&quot;, and was doing better now. However, Amy is responsible for transforming Willow, apparently out of jealousy and spite. Allen says she would have liked to explore Amy&#x27;s struggle to overcome her anger, so that she could &quot;get a grip and come back to the fold with her friends.&quot;

===Literature===

Amy makes minor appearances in several ambiguously canon novels set before the season 3 finale, most notable &quot;The Gatekeeper (novel series)&quot;, where she helps defend Sunnydale from a horde of magical threats while Buffy and her friends are busy elsewhere.

In the first issue of the Season Eight comic book story &quot;The Long Way Home,&quot; Amy works together with the US Army to locate and attack Buffy.

Later, in &quot;Time of Your Life,&quot; Amy and Warren are shown working under direct orders from Twilight. Together they construct a missile covered in mystical runes and candles and use it to destroy a Scottish citadel, killing seven of the many Slayers residing there. When Twilight betrays Amy and Warren, she attempts to switch sides and forms a truce with Buffy in &quot;Twilight.&quot; In the final arc, &quot;Last Gleaming,&quot; Amy and Warren have fled far from the final battle scene. At its conclusion, after Buffy destroys an ancient relic and effectively brings about the end of magic on Earth, the spell keeping Warren alive breaks, and Amy watches as he suddenly turns into a pile of blood and bones.

Amy also appears in the second volume of &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot;, tying into &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten&quot;, in issue four. In the story, magic was recently restored to the world at the conclusion of &quot;Buffy Season Nine&quot;, while London in &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; was the site of a failed attempt by Whistler to restore magic which resulted in the mass mutation of locals in one borough, creating the ghetto known as &#x27;Magic Town.&#x27;

==Powers and abilities==
In the television series, Amy possesses formidable witchcraft abilities that she has inherited from her maternal lineage, and these powers undergo significant augmentation over the course of the series. Initially, Amy&#x27;s magical prowess surpasses that of Willow, as demonstrated when she casts a rat-transformation spell that initially stumps Willow&#x27;s attempts at reversal. However, in season 7, Amy concedes that Willow has eclipsed her in magical proficiency. In the comic book, &quot;Season Eight&quot;, she is significantly stronger.

==Romantic interests==
*Xander Harris - After a spell Amy casts which was supposed to make Cordelia love Xander goes wrong, she, along with every other woman in Sunnydale, falls in love with Xander (&quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot;). This attraction ends after Rupert Giles gets Amy to reverse the spell.
*Larry Blaisdell - Amy stated that she thought Larry was considering asking her to the prom, apparently unaware he was gay and the fact that the graduation of her class occurred three years before, when Larry died.
*Warren Mears - Amy&#x27;s skinless boyfriend in &quot;Season Eight&quot;. It is revealed in &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; that the two had been in a relationship since &quot;Villains&quot;; after Warren was flayed alive by Willow, Amy saved his life. Amy refers to Warren as &quot;sweetie&quot;, while he claims that &quot;her magic is my skin.&quot;

<text>Eumenes (; ; ) was a Greek general, satrap, and Successor of Alexander the Great. He participated in the Wars of Alexander the Great, serving as Alexander&#x27;s personal secretary and later on as a battlefield commander. Eumenes depicted himself as a lifelong loyalist of Alexander&#x27;s dynasty and championed the cause of the Macedonian Argead royal house.

In the Wars of the Diadochi after Alexander&#x27;s death, Eumenes initially supported the regent Perdiccas in the First Diadochi War, and later the Argead royalty in the Second Diadochi War. Despite less experience as a commander, Eumenes defeated Craterus, one of Alexander&#x27;s most accomplished generals, at the Battle of the Hellespont in 321 BC. After Perdiccas&#x27; murder in 320 BC Eumenes became a public enemy of the new Post-Alexander regime under Antipater and Antigonus. In 319 BC he was defeated by Antigonus at the Battle of Orkynia and confined to Nora.

Eumenes escaped and then allied with Polyperchon and Olympias, Alexander&#x27;s mother, against Cassander and Antigonus. From 318 BC onward he led a hard-fought campaign against Antigonus, defeating him at the Battle of Paraitakene, then being indecisively defeated later at the Battle of Gabiene. Afterward, Eumenes was betrayed by his soldiers (the Silver Shields) and given over to Antigonus. Antigonus executed him in the winter of 316–315 BC.

The Greek biographer and essayist Plutarch chose Eumenes as the focus of one of his biographies in &quot;Parallel Lives,&quot; where he was paired with Quintus Sertorius, the rebel Roman general who led a revolt against Rome in the 70s BC.

==Early career==

Eumenes was a native of Cardia in the Thracian Chersonese. His father, a prominent citizen of Cardia, was named Hieronymus. Hieronymus cultivated a friendship with Philip II of Macedon which eventually led Eumenes to be employed as a private royal secretary (&quot;grammateus&quot;) by Philip, probably in 342 BC. He may have sought refuge in Macedonia because of the tyrant Hecataeus of Cardia&#x27;s enmity toward his family.

Eumenes also impressed Alexander&#x27;s mother, Olympias, who later called him &quot;the most faithful of my friends&quot;. Despite the position of secretary being looked down on by Macedonians, Eumenes held significant authority in the office, as he oversaw all written communications and maintained a close relationship with the king.

Eumenes served as hetairos (companion and cavalry captain) and royal secretary under both Philip and Philip&#x27;s successor, Alexander the Great. After Philip&#x27;s death (336 BC) Eumenes remained loyal to Alexander and Olympias and accompanied Alexander into Asia, but for most of his reign served as royal secretary. Eumenes did not get along with Hephaestion, Alexander&#x27;s closest companion, repeatedly arguing with him over &quot;trivial matters&quot;. Plutarch also reports an anecdote of Eumenes hiding money from Alexander.

After Alexander&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, Eumenes began performing military and diplomatic missions, such as his pronouncement to Sangala in 326. He may have played a larger part in Alexander&#x27;s eastern campaign, especially in India, than the surviving accounts say. Eumenes was promoted to leader of the companion cavalry (hipparch), formerly held by Perdiccas following Hephaestion&#x27;s death in late 324 BC. Eumenes also participated in the Marriages at Susa in 324 BC with the other hetairoi. Eumenes wed Artonis, daughter of Persian satrap Artabazus II and sister of Pharnabazus III, Persian satrap of Phrygia. This was a high honour as Artonis&#x27; sister was Barsine, a mistress of Alexander and mother of his son Heracles of Macedon.

By the time Alexander had defeated the Achaemenid Persian Empire, Eumenes was the &quot;shrewd administrator&quot; and secretary for Alexander&#x27;s domain, deeply involved in day-to-day affairs. Eumenes is recorded as an author of the &quot;Ephemerides,&quot; a chronicle of Alexander the Great&#x27;s activities leading up to his illness and death.

=== After the death of Alexander the Great ===
After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, Eumenes was left with less standing, since his position depended closely on the king. Alexander had left no apparent heir. When Alexander&#x27;s leading officers (somatophylakes and others) and a mass of infantry were debating whether one of the living Argeads should ascend or a regency should be installed for Alexander&#x27;s unborn child (Alexander IV), Eumenes was present alongside the officers but did not speak. When the officers fled Babylon in the ensuing riot of the infantry, Eumenes remained in the city to make Meleager (the leader of the disgruntled infantry) come to an agreement with the officers.

Eumenes used his Cardian heritage to argue he had no personal motivation in the &quot;Macedonian&quot; struggle. The infantry were willing to listen to Eumenes because of his close association with Alexander. The officers eventually subdued Meleager and regained control over Babylon by announcing a joint kingship between Philip III Arrhidaeus and, when he was born, Alexander IV. Perdiccas became regent, effective ruler of the vast Asian section of Alexander&#x27;s Empire, and Eumenes served as his advisor. Eumenes procured Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Last Plans&quot; and gave them to Perdiccas, who read them out before the soldiers before rejecting them.

==Satrap of Cappadocia and Paphlagonia (323–319 BC)==
Alexander&#x27;s Empire was split in the Partition of Babylon (323 BC), where Cappadocia and Paphlagonia were assigned to Eumenes, but they were not yet subdued. The Achaemenid satrap Ariarathes still held Cappadocia, and the Paphlagonian tribes had renounced allegiance to the Macedonian government. Eumenes thus had to subdue these forces to actually attain his satrapy. Perdiccas used his authority as regent of the joint kings to order Leonnatus, satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, and Antigonus, satrap of Phrygia, Pamphylia and Lycia, to aid Eumenes in securing his satrapy. Eumenes left Babylon in the late summer of 323 BC.Eumenes was probably given 5000 talents of gold from Perdiccas for the reconquest of Cappadocia. Leonnatus accompanied him, but Antigonus ignored Perdiccas&#x27; order. Eumenes arrived in Cappadocia and began to hire mercenaries. Leonnatus, however, was requested by Hecataeus of Cardia to march west to relieve Antipater who was besieged at Lamia as part of the Lamian War. Leonnatus agreed to go west, as he had received letters from Cleopatra of Macedon (daughter of Olympias, sister of Alexander the Great) asking him to marry her and become king of Macedon.

Leonnatus attempted to induce Eumenes to reconcile with Hecataeus and accompany him to Macedon to share in his far-reaching designs. Eumenes refused, fearing Antipater would murder him if he returned, and felt &quot;[unwilling] to abandon his standing with Perdiccas for a mad and dangerous dash to Macedonia&quot;. He told Leonnatus he would give his answer later, then fled back to Perdiccas early in 322 BC, telling the regent of Leonnatus&#x27; plans. For this, Perdiccas elevated Eumenes to the ruling council of the Empire.

Eumenes joined Perdiccas, who installed him in Cappadocia by defeating and killing Ariarathes in the summer of 322. Eumenes reorganized his satrapy and appointed his supporters to prominent positions. The two generals traveled to Cilicia by autumn. Eumenes then returned to Cappadocia to aid Neoptolemus (satrap of Armenia) in his efforts to subdue the Satrapy of Armenia. Neoptolemus&#x27; soldiers, disgruntled with authority, refused to listen to Eumenes just as they had refused Neoptolemus. Eumenes subdued them by raising 6300 cavalry from Cappadocia, and made his satrapy peaceful and loyal by giving the Cappadocians monetary concessions. Eumenes probably successfully campaigned in Armenia throughout 322 and 321 BC.

=== The arrival of Cleopatra and war ===

In the spring of 321 BC, Nicaea (daughter of Antipater) and Cleopatra of Macedon both came to Perdiccas and offered themselves as his bride. Eumenes may have played a role in Cleopatra&#x27;s arrival; when she arrived, he championed her proposal over that of Nicaea. Eumenes&#x27; advice carried weight as the common soldiers respected him after his pacifying of Armenia.

Perdiccas married Nicaea, but when his control over Philip III was challenged by Eurydice, he sent Eumenes to Cleopatra to reopen negotiations for marriage. Antigonus fled to Macedonia, and informed Antipater of Perdiccas&#x27; intentions to divorce his daughter Nicaea and marry Cleopatra. Craterus and Antipater, having subdued most of Greece in the Lamian War, were infuriated by Antigonus&#x27; news. They suspended their plans for more campaigns in Greece and prepared to pass into Asia and depose Perdiccas.

==== Asia Minor and the Hellespont ====

Perdiccas and his government decided to attack Egypt, as Ptolemy had, through the help of a Perdiccan officer, obtained Alexander the Great&#x27;s funeral carriage. Eumenes, in turn, was given supreme command (as &quot;autokrator&quot;) in Asia Minor to beat back Antipater and Craterus who were mustering armies in Greece.

Eumenes marched to the Hellespont, following orders to defend it, and spoke to Cleopatra again at Sardis, who this time refused to marry Perdiccas, uncertain of who would win in the war to come. Antigonus, who sailed over with a fleet and landed in western Asia Minor, succeeded in winning over many satraps and cities (Asander of Caria, Menander of Lydia, among others). Eumenes narrowly escaped capture in Sardis thanks to Cleopatra&#x27;s warning. Eumenes then retreated inland as Cleitus the White defected with his fleet (allowing Craterus and Antipater to cross), and Perdiccas, hearing of these disasters, ordered Neoptolemus and Alcetas to obey him. Both of these Macedonian officers resented Eumenes, and refused to do so.

Eumenes received messages from Craterus and Antipater once they had reached Asia Minor, promising to retain him in his satrapy if he joined them. Craterus wanted to reconcile Eumenes with Antipater, while Eumenes wanted to reconcile Craterus with Perdiccas; negotiations failed however, as Eumenes stayed loyal to Perdiccas, and Craterus to Antipater. Eumenes then discovered Neoptolemus was planning to defect to Craterus and Antipater, and defeated him in battle in Phrygia, recruiting much of his army. Neoptolemus fled to Craterus and Antipater with 300 horsemen, and convinced them to march: soon after, Craterus took the majority of the Macedonian army to confront Eumenes.

Despite possessing far lower quality infantry than Craterus, Eumenes accepted the offer of battle, believing in his superior cavalry, beginning the Battle of the Hellespont. Eumenes concealed Craterus&#x27; name from his soldiers, knowing his popularity would sway their loyalty, instead claiming the Asian warlord &quot;Pigres&quot; had joined Neoptolemus and was marching against them. Eumenes also proclaimed he had received a dream that his army would be victorious. During the battle, Eumenes prevented any Macedonians from recognizing the popular Craterus through his troop placement and tactics, and as a result Craterus was killed, his flank overran by Eumenes&#x27; Cappadocian cavalry. Eumenes, leading the left flank, killed Neoptolemus in single combat, then induced the enemy infantry to surrender, winning a &quot;stunning victory&quot;.

The victory brought Eumenes the enmity of some of his men due to his foreign heritage. He attempted to compel Craterus&#x27; infantry phalanx to desert to him, but failed and the infantry hastily marched south to link up with Antipater. News of Eumenes&#x27; victory, which might have restored Perdiccas&#x27; authority, reached Egypt only one day after Perdiccas was assassinated by his men in a mutiny (320 BC).

=== After the death of Perdiccas and Triparadisus ===
After the murder of Perdiccas in Egypt, the Macedonian generals condemned Eumenes (and the other Perdiccans) to death at the Conference at Triparadisus, with Antipater assigning Antigonus as his chief executioner. Eumenes&#x27; province of Cappadocia was officially transferred to Nicanor, and Antigonus was given a large army to destroy the remaining Perdiccans in Asia. Eumenes was now in &quot;far worse circumstances than he had been at Alexander&#x27;s death&quot; as he was an outlaw and being actively hunted, but he had an experienced, loyal army and prepared for the coming conflict with Antigonus.

Following Triparadisus, Antigonus placed a bounty on the Greek general&#x27;s head of 100 talents of gold. News of this came immediately after Eumenes&#x27; financial rewards, so his officers and men were outraged and redoubled their efforts to protect their leader, assigning a large bodyguard of 1000 men to protect him at all times. He was also given the privilege of granting purple hats and cloaks to his soldiers, an honour usually only allowed for a Macedonian king. Eumenes further consolidated loyalty by arguing to his men that the joint kings had been taken by traitors to the Macedonian throne and that, in effect, he and his army were still loyalists to the Argead house.

Eumenes first travelled to Mount Ida where there was a royal stable, and took a large number of horses to replenish his Cappadocian cavalry. He took the time to file an account with the overseers of the stables despite his outlaw status. Upon hearing this, Antipater was greatly amused, however, it is clear that Eumenes made this move to show that he was acting under the law and in the service of the Argead House.

Eumenes marched to the Hellespont, where he quartered his army and plundered the locals who refused to pay his soldiers. He &quot;continued to demonstrate his prowess as a military commander,&quot; attacking Hellespontine Phrygia and Phrygia itself while Antigonus and Antipater were present (on their return trip to Macedonia). Since he would be facing a force superior in infantry, Eumenes decided to position himself in the plains of Sardis of Lydia where his advantage in cavalry would be decisive. To further guarantee the loyalty of subordinates, Eumenes also sold off the estates of Phrygia to them and provided military support to claim the purchased land from the, obviously, unwilling and disgruntled Phrygian property owners. This revenue was used to pay his soldiers.

He had also hoped to win the support of Cleopatra of Macedon, who was present in Sardis at the time. Cleopatra and Eumenes had been friends since childhood, however, Cleopatra was not willing to back what seemed to be a losing cause and implored Eumenes to leave the area lest she incur the wrath of Antipater. Eumenes obliged her and moved north into Phrygia to winter. Eumenes&#x27; plundering campaigns during this time were very successful, so much so that Antipater&#x27;s soldiers began to become disgruntled. Eumenes spent the winter of 320/319 BC in Celaenae.

In the winter, Eumenes sent messages to the other Perdiccan leaders, including Alcetas and Attalus (Perdiccas&#x27; brother-in-law), imploring them to unite their forces against Antigonus. A conference was held with the Perdiccan leaders in Celaenae: Eumenes argued that Antipater and Antigonus were unpopular, and that a united offensive would not only prove successful but also attract many deserters. Negotiations broke down, however, as neither Eumenes nor Alcetas would serve the other, and other commanders contested the chief position. Eumenes also dealt with a defection of 3500 of his men this winter; he executed the leaders and pardoned the soldiers.When Eumenes&#x27; Macedonian generals approached him about one of them taking overall command, Eumenes is said to have retorted that &quot;formalities and technicalities would not protect them from death and destruction&quot;.

==== Battle of Orkynia ====
In 319 BC, Antigonus marched his army into Cappodocia and engaged Eumenes at the Battle of Orkynia; Eumenes accepted the battle as the ground was advantageous for cavalry. Eumenes was easily defeated due to the mid-battle desertion of a mercenary cavalry officer named Apollonides, who Antigonus had bribed. Antigonus may have also used a ruse (pretending he received reinforcements) to discourage Eumenes&#x27; men before the battle. Although defeated, Eumenes swiftly acted to chase down and execute Apollonides, which restored the faith of his men.

Eumenes was put to flight, however, having lost some 8000 men, and moved toward Armenia. Antigonus pursued Eumenes and forced him to move carefully. Following the battle, Antigonus had neglected to address the dead and had immediately set off in pursuit for Eumenes. Determined to follow tradition, Plutarch reports that Eumenes made the unexpected move of returning to the battlefield so that he could construct a proper funeral pyre for the dead. This action greatly impressed Antigonus.

==== Remainder of the campaign ====
The remainder of the campaign turned into a battle of manoeuvre, with Eumenes avoiding further battle with Antigonus. At one point, Eumenes was in a position to capture the baggage of Antigonus&#x27; forces. Eumenes knew that he would not be able to prevent his soldiers from plundering this loot if they found out about it and also that doing so would decrease the essential mobility of his forces. Eumenes dispatched a private message to his old friend, the general Menander, advising him to move the baggage uphill so that its capture would be impossible. Menander immediately followed this advice. Eumenes feigned disappointment to his men and moved on. Menander and the other Antigonid officers were shocked by Eumenes&#x27; warning; only Antigonus knew of his actual motives.

Eumenes was pursued by Antigonus for several weeks until the following winter. He used guerrilla warfare to hold off Antigonus, but his men were deserting him. In the late spring of 319 BC, Eumenes disbanded his army, save for a small, crack force of 600 men and holed up in Nora, a strong and well-supplied fortress on the border between Cappadocia and Lycaonia. Antigonus arrived shortly after and decided to enter into negotiation with Eumenes instead of undergoing a lengthy siege.

Eumenes required Antigonus to send hostages to Nora before he was willing to come out and negotiate. Antigonus wanted to acquire Eumenes as his own officer and so first demanded that Eumenes address him as a superior officer. Eumenes refused, replying:

Despite their appointed role as enemies, Antigonus and Eumenes were actually old friends, and when they met they renewed their friendship, speaking amiably to one another. Eumenes&#x27; demands for surrender were that he retain Cappadocia as his satrapy and his status as outlaw be rescinded. Antigonus completed his siege constructions around Nora (blockading Eumenes in) and said he would ask the regent Antipater to confirm Eumenes&#x27; demands. Eumenes, overall unsatisfied after the long conference, was willing to hold out longer for a more favourable position in the imperial hierarchy. Antigonus departed with his army to confront the remaining Perdiccans, who were led by Alcetas and Attalus in Pisidia, whom he defeated.

Eumenes kept the morale of his besieged men high by mingling with them regularly, aided, apparently, by his friendly appearance. In the cramped city, he was forced to come up with novel solutions so that his men and horses remained in fighting shape including; emptying large rooms where men exercised on a set schedule, and creating a suspension device, likened to an ancient treadmill, on which horses could run.

Eumenes sent envoys under his friend and countryman Hieronymus of Cardia to Antipater to negotiate his surrender, probably in the late summer of 319 BC. Nothing came of this, however. Eumenes effectively held out for more than a year until the death of Antipater threw his opponents into disarray.

== The Second War of the Diadochi (319–315 BC) ==

Antipater had become regent since Triparadisus, when he acquired the joint kings from the dead Perdiccas. He had taken them to Macedonia, but after his death left the regency to his friend Polyperchon instead of his son Cassander. Cassander, therefore, allied himself with Antigonus, Lysimachus and Ptolemy as he prepared to confront Polyperchon. Following Antipater&#x27;s death, Antigonus sent generous terms to Eumenes in Nora through Hieronymus of Cardia that were nearly the same as Eumenes&#x27; initial demands. Eumenes probably agreed to the terms in 318 BC, swore loyalty to Antigonus, and left Nora. Another, less probable account says that Eumenes escaped Nora by rewriting his oath of loyalty to the joint kings instead of Antigonus.

With Macedonia in disarray, Antigonus prepared to conquer outward, revolt against the joint kings, and expand his power. Polyperchon, in order to shore up his allies in the coming conflict with Cassander, had written to Olympias requesting help; Olympias, already in contact with Eumenes, now wrote to him for advice. Eumenes told her to wait and see what would happen. Soon after, in the late summer of 318 BC, Polyperchon wrote to Eumenes himself, requesting an alliance in the name of the joint kings.

Polyperchon said Eumenes could march to Macedonia and become guardian of the kings, or stay in Asia with supreme command over the region and remain &quot;a protector of royalty&quot; abroad. Furthermore, he promised Eumenes command over the Asian treasuries (Susa and Cyinda, which would allow Eumenes to hire many mercenaries) and the allegiance of the formidable Silver Shields, highly skilled veterans who had fought with Alexander for years, if he accepted.

Eumenes decided to accept Polyperchon&#x27;s offer, either out of a wish to protect the Argead royalty and Olympias, because of his own ambition and disinclination to be subordinate to another, or a combination of both factors. Eumenes&#x27; acceptance meant the war in Asia with Antigonus would start once again.

=== Campaign in Cilicia and Syria ===
Eumenes acted quickly to muster his army and marched into Cilicia, evading an army Antigonus sent to capture him. In Cilicia he allied with Antigenes and Teutamus, the commanders of the famous Silver Shields, the same men who had once condemned him to death after Perdiccas&#x27; murder. Eumenes was able to secure control over the unruly commanders of the Silver Shields by playing on their undying loyalty to, and superstitious awe of, Alexander. He claimed that Alexander had visited him in a dream and told him that he would be present with them at every battle. Eumenes even went so far as to set up a tent for the late conqueror complete with a throne, diadem, and scepter. This &quot;ingenious stratagem&quot; consolidated Eumenes&#x27; control and placated his Macedonian officers, who felt that they were listening less to a Cardian foreigner and more to the late Alexander. As a result, Eumenes&#x27; orders were followed. Furthermore, Eumenes argued that as a Greek, a Cardian, &quot;his only concern was the defence of the royal family&quot;.

Eumenes used the royal treasury at Cyinda to recruit an army of mercenaries to add to his own troops, a process that took several months but built up a sizeable army. Propaganda attempts by Ptolemy to subvert supporters of Eumenes in Asia, military and political, failed uniformly. Antigonus attempted this as well and successfully convinced Teutamus (one of two commanders of the Silver Shields) but Antigenes, the other, stayed loyal to Eumenes, ironically because of his foreign heritage. Eumenes emerged from Antigonus&#x27; propaganda campaign with a generally greater authority among his Macedonian troops.

In the winter of 318/317 BC, Eumenes left Cilicia and marched into Syria and Phoenicia, and began to raise a naval force on behalf of Polyperchon to sail to the Aegean Sea. Ptolemy, who had recently conquered the area, did not stop him. When it was ready in early August of 317 BC, Eumenes sent the fleet west to reinforce Polyperchon, but it changed sides after meeting Antigonus&#x27;s fleet off the coast of Cilicia. Meanwhile, Antigonus had settled his affairs in Asia Minor and marched east to take out Eumenes before he could do further damage.

Polyperchon&#x27;s campaign in Macedonia was failing, leaving Eumenes isolated; Eumenes himself, now knowing Antigonus was coming and that he could not help Polyperchon in Macedonia, marched out of Phoenicia in late August/early September, eastward through Syria into Mesopotamia, with the idea of gathering support in the upper satrapies, where there was currently conflict.

===Campaign in the Upper Satrapies===
Eumenes gained the support of Amphimachus, the satrap of Mesopotamia, then marched his army into Northern Babylonia. During the march he negotiated with Seleucus, the satrap of Babylonia, and Peithon, the satrap of Media, seeking their help against Antigonus. Seleucus replied that he would not obey someone condemned to death, and Peithon was similarly unwilling. Eumenes wintered north of Babylon in 317/316 BC, during which time he sent the letters he had gotten from Polyperchon to satraps of the upper satrapies. These letters ordered the satraps, in the kings&#x27; names, to join him with all their forces. The upper satraps had already united their armies under the leadership of Peucestas, satrap of Persis, to combat the expansionism of Peithon and were willing to join Eumenes.

Eumenes left his winter quarters early in the spring of 316 BC and marched on Susa, a major royal treasury, in Susiana. Seleucus and Peithon attempted to subvert the Silver Shields while Eumenes was in Babylonia, and when they failed flooded his camp. Eumenes drained the land and escaped, and Seleucus, unable to oppose him, signed a truce for his passage.

In Susiana, Eumenes joined the already assembled army of the upper satraps. With this combined army Eumenes&#x27; could confidently match Antigonus. Peucestas, however, argued that he deserved the high command due to his high standing and large army. Eumenes&#x27; problem of divided command was exacerbated by Peucestas and his companions, but they were again placated by Eumenes&#x27; Tent of Alexander, where communal meetings would be held to direct the war against Antigonus. In late May, Eumenes reached Susa and extensively paid and rested his troops, while also paying Eudamus for the support of his war elephant corps. When Antigonus arrived in Susiana, Eumenes ordered the treasurer Xenophilus of Susa not to give anything to Antigonus.

Eumenes then marched southeastwards into Persia, where he picked up additional reinforcements. He crossed the Pasitigris, where he planned to ambush Antigonus, knowing he would be crossing blind.

==== Battle of the river Coprates ====
Antigonus, meanwhile, had reached Susa and left Seleucus there to besiege the place while he himself pursued Eumenes towards the Pasitigris. Eumenes required more troops to block the entire river, and so asked Peucestas to recruit more; Peucestas initially refused to do so, resenting Eumenes, but eventually agreed. In the late July of 316 BC, Antigonus arrived at the river Coprates (a tributary of the Pasitigris) and prepared to cross. He sent an advance force ahead in boats to ensure a beachhead on the opposite side of the river. Eumenes, who had camped nearby and placed scouts across the breadth of the river to alert him, soon heard that Antigonus had sent over men and quickly rode over with an army.

Eumenes waited until the army was mid-crossing, and then surprised Antigonus&#x27; soldiers, easily routing them, capturing 4000 men while killing some 6000 others. Antigonus, whose soldiers were already struggling with the harsh temperatures, was faced with disaster. Effectively unable to cross with Eumenes&#x27; presence and victory, Antigonus abandoned the idea and turned back northward, moving up into Media and Badace, then to Ecbatana through a damaging forced march to rest his men.

This move, &quot;a sign of just how desperate Antigonus was after this first defeat&quot;, left open a route west, to Asia Minor, for Eumenes. Eumenes and his staff wanted to march westward, cut Antigonus&#x27;s supply lines and secure Asia Minor. If Eumenes had been able to move, Antigonus and his ally Cassander&#x27;s position would have been greatly damaged, but the satraps, including Peucestas, refused to abandon their satrapies. Knowing that if he split his army off from the satraps it would be no match for Antigonus&#x27; superior force, Eumenes relented to their demands and remained in the east.

==== Stay in Persis ====
Following the Coprates, Eumenes marched southeast towards Persepolis over 24 days. As they were in Peucestas&#x27; home territory, the satrap hosted an enormous banquet and feast for all of Eumenes&#x27; army, successfully increasing his own popularity and further contesting Eumenes position as supreme commander. Eumenes, unwilling to confront the challenge to his authority openly, forged a letter reporting news from the west and had it widely circulated in his camp. Supposedly from the satrap of Armenia Orontes, the letter said that Olympias and Alexander IV had conquered Macedon, killed Cassander, and that Polyperchon was en route to Asia with a great army.

The forged letter was believed because Eumenes had composed it in Aramaic, the common language of the Persian Empire, and Orontes was a friend of Peucestas. This &quot;clever trick&quot; greatly bolstered Eumenes&#x27; position as royal general and reasserted his supreme command. Eumenes then acted against Peucestas&#x27; allies, summoning the satrap of Arachosia Sibyrtius to a show trial after seizing his baggage train, making him flee. To further assure the loyalty of his subordinates, Eumenes took large loans (400 talents total) from them &quot;in the name of the kings, thus binding them to him as anxious creditors&quot;.

Eumenes departed Persis and set out toward Antigonus when he heard Antigonus had left Ecbatana and was marching through Media. Eumenes wanted to battle Antigonus while his army had high morale, but while entertaining his troops became sick. Eumenes halted the march as his soldiers lost morale, as they regarded Eumenes as their greatest commander. He slightly recovered, but was compelled to give over supreme command to Peucestas and Antigenes to lead the army north while Eumenes himself convalesced, being carried in a litter. Antigonus hastened to battle Eumenes&#x27; army while Eumenes was ill. Eumenes recovered, however, and when the armies were within a day or so of each other resumed overall command to meet Antigonus.

==== Battle of Paraitakene ====
In the late October or early November of 316 BC, the two armies met in southern Media, beginning the Battle of Paraitakene. For five days Eumenes and Antigonus skirmished but did not engage in battle. Antigonus, on the fifth day, again attempted to subvert the Silver Shields, who again refused; Eumenes praised them for their loyalty. Eumenes then learned from deserters that Antigonus was planning to break camp and move away, and guessed Antigonus wanted to relocate to the region of Gabiene. In response to this, Eumenes bribed mercenaries to pretend to defect to Antigonus and report that he planned to attack Antigonus&#x27; camp at night. Antigonus believed the mercenaries and delayed his march, preparing for battle, while Eumenes split his army and set out immediately, gaining a six to seven hour head start on Antigonus to Gabiene.

Antigonus learned he had been deceived and force marched to pursue Eumenes. He caught up to Eumenes by riding hastily with his cavalry, and forced Eumenes to array for battle by concealing the fact that the rest of his army had not caught up yet. After Antigonus had assembled his army, he engaged Eumenes.

Eumenes positioned his elite troops on his right flank, including the Silver Shields, and led the elite cavalry himself. He placed his war elephants and light infantry in a screen ahead of his heavy infantry. The formation was defensive as Eumenes did not want to attack Antigonus uphill. Peithon, sent by Antigonus against Eumenes&#x27; right cavalry, succeeded initially in confining them. In response Eumenes transferred troops to enlarge the flank and beat back Peithon, who fled; meanwhile Eumenes&#x27; Silver Shields were sharply victorious, routing the enemy phalanx. Antigonus, though now facing &quot;annihilation&quot;, ignored advice to retreat and, observing a gap in the line between Eumenes&#x27; phalanx and his left flank cavalry, charged and routed them; Eumenes called back his victorious right flank in response.

Though both generals reformed their armies and prepared to continue the battle, it was approaching night and the armies were too tired and hungry to proceed. Eumenes wanted to stay at the battlefield and bury the dead, thus allowing him to claim victory, but his troops wanted to return to their baggage train; fearing that a refusal would give his rivals for supreme command more power, Eumenes marched away. &quot;Antigonus, however, had no such fears&quot;, and he was able to regain the battlefield and bury the dead, while proclaiming victory.

Antigonus, whose casualties were more numerous, detained Eumenes&#x27; herald to finish burning his dead and obscure their amount. He then force marched his demoralized army to safety the next night. Eumenes returned to the battlefield and buried his own dead lavishly. He then settled into Gabiene while Antigonus, indecisively defeated, reached and rested in Media.

==== Interim to Gabiene ====
During the winter of 316–315 BC, Eumenes&#x27; army camp was very widely spread, either because of insubordination or lack of supplies. He had stationed sentries on the roads, but not along the freezing desert routes into Gabiene (Dasht-i Kavir, south east of Isfahan). Antigonus, learning of this, planned to march through the desert and surprise attack Eumenes, but he was observed by some locals who reported it to his opponents.

The satraps were alarmed by this, as Antigonus was four days away and it would take at least six days to assemble their army. Peucestas advised tactical retreat and withdrew his portion of the army to a remote area of Gabiene. Eumenes, however, successfully persuaded the satraps to remain by pointing out their troops would be well-rested while Antigonus&#x27; would be tired from traversing the desert, and told them of a plan which would give them enough time to assemble the whole army.

After the conference Eumenes had his troops light numerous fires in the mountains bordering the desert every day. This made it appear as though Eumenes&#x27; entire camp was on the desert border, and Antigonus, observing this, delayed his march to rest his men for what he assumed would be another pitched battle against Eumenes&#x27; whole army.

Through this strategy Eumenes was able to delay battle and assemble his scattered army, though Antigonus did eventually learn the truth behind the fires. Eumenes success in preventing this attack raised his position and led many of the soldiers to ask him to lead them alone. Antigonus, however, was able to attack Eudamus and his elephant corps (they had been slow in leaving camp) and successfully killed many cavalry before being driven off by reinforcements sent by Eumenes.

As the forces assembled Antigenes, Teutamus, and other prominent members of Eumenes&#x27; army began plotting to kill Eumenes after Antigonus was defeated. Eudamus learned of the conspiracy and warned Eumenes, who thought of fleeing but chose not to. Eumenes, who &quot;was not a coward and obviously an individual confident in his own ability&quot;, may have believed that the battle was worth fighting, despite the risks, because of the possibilities if he was victorious. Eumenes destroyed his correspondence, wrote his will, and prepared for the coming battle.

==== Battle of Gabiene ====

A few days later both armies drew up for battle, beginning the Battle of Gabiene. In the battle, Eumenes placed himself with his elite troops on the left flank in order to face Antigonus himself, who had positioned himself on his right flank. Again, Eumenes screened his cavalry with elephants and light infantry skirmishers. Eumenes&#x27; strategy focused on his phalanx and the Silver Shields; he ordered Philip (satrap of Bactria, leading the weaker right Eumenid flank), one of his loyal supporters, not to engage the enemy. Eumenes had placed Peucestas and the other satrapal cavalry on his own flank, perhaps to ensure they followed his orders.

Antigenes sent a single horseman to the enemy phalanx who was to face the Silver Shields; the horseman shouted that &quot;[you] are sinning against your fathers, you degenerates, the men who conquered the world with Philip and Alexander!&quot; This pronouncement apparently demoralized Antigonus&#x27; infantry, and was met with a cheer from Eumenes&#x27; troops; Eumenes then sounded the charge and his army marched forward.

As the battle began, Antigonus, noticing that the movement of the troops kicked up clouds of dust that obscured sight, sent a sizeable cavalry contingent behind Eumenes&#x27; army to seize his baggage camp, and successfully did so without Eumenes noticing. After the war elephants engaged one another, Eumenes&#x27; cavalry met the cavalry of Antigonus, which was led by Antigonus&#x27; son Demetrius.

Eumenes&#x27; left cavalry was defeated due to the sudden retreat of Peucestas and the satrapal horsemen, which led to panic and another 1500 cavalry retreating with him. This cavalry defeat was disastrous for Eumenes. He continued to struggle against Antigonus, leading his cavalry forward in a charge in an attempt to meet and kill Antigonus in single combat, but failing due to his inferior number of horsemen. Facing heavy losses and being vastly outnumbered, Eumenes eventually gave way and rode over to his right flank.

The Silver Shields, however, were again victorious, routing Antigonus&#x27; phalanx and inflicting mass casualties. Eumenes, noting that the enemy phalanx had been destroyed, attempted to regather his cavalry on the right flank for a final push. He had heard his baggage had been captured, but believed that if his united cavalry joined the Silver Shields a renewed offensive would not only reclaim the lost baggage, but rout Antigonus&#x27; army and claim their baggage as well. Peucestas and the satraps refused Eumenes&#x27; orders, withdrawing further away as night approached.

Antigonus then unsuccessfully attacked the Silver Shields, who were able to retreat by forming a square and marching off of the battlefield. He prevented Eumenes&#x27; cavalry from linking up with the Silver Shields, and Eumenes was forced to withdraw.

=== Betrayal and Death ===
The Battle of Gabiene was effectively as indecisive as the previous battle at Parataikene. Although Eumenes had inflicted significantly greater casualties, he lost control of his army&#x27;s baggage; in addition to all the loot of the Silver Shields (treasure accumulated over 30 years of successful warfare including gold, silver, gems and other booty), the soldiers&#x27; women and children were taken as well.

Eumenes was now in a precarious position, as he had planned for victory or defeat, but not stalemate. He arrived at camp following the battle after the Silver Shields and satraps did, and a conference was held in the late evening. The satraps wished to retreat, but Eumenes wanted to battle again the next day, citing the fact that the cavalry were not greatly diminished and the Silver Shields&#x27; victory in the centre. Eumenes had reason to be optimistic about another engagement and may have been successful in persuading the army, but the Silver Shields themselves, though they blamed Peucestas for the inconclusive result of the battle, wished to get their baggage and families back and refused both options. The conference ended without a decision.

Teutamus, one of their commanders, then sent the request to Antigonus to trade for a return of the baggage; Antigonus responded that they give him Eumenes in return, and the Silver Shields agreed, arresting Eumenes and leading him to Antigonus. Anson believes Eumenes, though he knew of the plot against his life, believed his skills as a commander would &quot;obviously&quot; be necessary for another battle against Antigonus and was thus taken off guard when actually arraigned.

Eumenes, during his seizure, requested and was given permission to talk to the assembled army. According to Plutarch, Eumenes said:

This speech apparently garnered sympathy from most of the army, but the Silver Shields, unconvinced, continued to lead Eumenes on, and they were able to do so without challenge. The war was thus at an end. Eumenes was given to Antigonus, who placed him under guard and held councils to decide his fate that lasted several days.

Plutarch and Nepos write that Eumenes grew confused why Antigonus did not kill him or set him free; when his jailkeeper replied that if Eumenes wanted death he should have died in battle, Eumenes is said to have retorted that he had not died in battle because he had never encountered an opponent stronger than himself.

Antigonus, supported by his son Demetrius and Nearchus the Cretan, was disinclined to kill Eumenes, but most of the council and his soldiers demanded his execution and so it was decided. Antigonus starved Eumenes for three days but finally sent an executioner to strangle him when he had to move camp. Eumenes&#x27; body was given to his friends to be burnt with honour, and his ashes were conveyed in a silver urn to his wife and children.

==Legacy==
=== Generalship ===
Despite Eumenes&#x27; undeniable skills as a general, he never commanded the full allegiance of the Macedonian officers in his army and died as a result. Eumenes was disliked by many of his Macedonian companions—certainly for his successes and supposedly for his non-Macedonian (in the tribal sense) background and prior office as Royal Secretary.

Eumenes is broadly seen as an excellent commander, skilled in both tactics and strategy and Antigonus&#x27; only military equal, who did his utmost to maintain the unity of Alexander&#x27;s empire in Asia. He was also an &quot;adept propagandist&quot;, who used diplomacy and ruse to his advantage wherever possible. Eumenes&#x27; efforts were repeatedly frustrated by issues of divided command and disloyal subordinates: his &quot;most serious problem&quot; which were handicaps many of his enemies, notably Antigonus, did not have to struggle with. Anson considers it &quot;remarkable&quot; that Eumenes came so close to defeating Antigonus, ultimately only losing through betrayal, given Antigonus&#x27; notable skill as a general and the repeated issues Eumenes dealt with.

=== Impact on the Age ===
Eumenes&#x27; defeat is seen as spelling the end for the Argead loyalists and, effectively, the Argead monarchy, leaving Alexander&#x27;s Empire &quot;in the hands of men who owed no loyalty except to themselves&quot;. Bosworth believes Eumenes&#x27; duel with Antigonus &quot;did more than anything to define the shape of the Hellenistic world&quot;. Green concurs, writing that &quot;With [Eumenes] death... the fiction of the unified empire was exploded once and for all&quot;.

Romm writes that Eumenes &quot;was the last general in the field with the ability, and will, to defend [the Argeads]&quot;, and that &quot;through sheer talent Eumenes had risen through the ranks; despite his Greek origins, he had come desperately close to gaining supreme power&quot;. Eumenes has been seen as a tragic figure, a man who seemingly tried to do the right thing but was overcome by a more ruthless enemy and the treachery of his own soldiers; in essence, that he failed not due to any lack of ability, but from &quot;ill luck, bad alliances, and one very capable opponent&quot;.

Historie is a historical fiction manga series that tells the life story of Eumenes.

<doc id="637684" wikidata="Q3342530" url="?curid=637684" title="False titles of nobility">
<text>False titles of nobility or royal title scams are claimed titles of social rank that have been fabricated or assumed by an individual or family without recognition by the authorities of a country in which titles of nobility exist or once existed. They have received an increasing amount of press attention, as more schemes that purport to confer or sell such honorifics are promoted on the internet. Concern about the use of titles which lack legal standing or a basis in tradition has prompted increased vigilance and denunciation, although under English common law a person may choose to be known by any name they see fit as long as it is not done to &quot;commit fraud or evade an obligation&quot;.

==Self-styled titles==
Outside monarchies, a distinction is drawn between a legitimate historical title which may no longer be recognised by a successor state (such as a republic) but is borne or claimed by a hereditary heir, and an invented or falsely-attributed noble title that is claimed without any historical basis.

Self-assumption of a title is not necessarily illegal; it depends on the law of the place where the title is used. The bearers of some self-assumed titles do not claim that such titles have been recognized by any nation at any time. Where such titles have existed historically, the current bearer may make no claim that its use is pursuant to a hereditary grant to an ancestor by a fount of honor.

Some individuals, associations or corporations purport to grant or transmit a legal or official right to a title, honour, acknowledgement or membership in a self-styled order of chivalry simply in exchange for a payment.

==British titles==
The British peerage includes the titles of (in ascending order) baron, viscount, earl, marquess and duke. All of these titleholders, except dukes, are (if male) known by the honorific &quot;Lord&quot; (in Scotland the lowest rank in the peerage is &quot;Lord (of Parliament)&quot; rather than &quot;Baron&quot;). No peerage can be created by monetary means; such a transaction would be in breach of the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. The British embassy in the United States informs that &quot;the sale of British titles is prohibited&quot;.

Titles in the Scottish baronage are arguably the only British nobility titles that may be passed to any person, of either sex, by inheritance or conveyance.

Baronetcies are hereditary titles granted by the Crown, but are not part of the peerage. Baronets are styled &quot;Sir&quot; with the suffix &quot;Bt.&quot; or &quot;Bart.&quot; after their surname. Baronetcies can no longer be purchased, and existing ones cannot be bought or sold.

Persons who have been enrolled in an order of chivalry or dubbed are knights or dames, and are thus entitled to the prefix of &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot;. These titles cannot be bought or sold either.

The holder of a peerage, baronetcy or knighthood may not lawfully transfer those titles or any title associated with them to another individual. If a peerage is renounced, it devolves automatically upon the heir-at-law, usually based upon primogeniture. The incumbent has no right to designate a successor to the title (excluding certain Scottish titles that can nominate heirs according to the succession rules of the letters patent, such as the most able son, or non-bloodline heirs see Lord Topichen or Lord Kinloss but there are others).

===Laird===

Several websites and Internet vendors on websites such as eBay sell Scottish lairdships along with small plots of land, known as souvenir plots. However, they create no legal right of ownership or legal right of heraldry in Scots law.

The Court of the Lord Lyon (the heraldic court tasked with the award and regulation of heraldry) considers souvenir plot titles to be meaningless as the registration of numerous &quot;lairds&quot; of a single estate would pose too great an administrative burden. The opinion of the Lord Lyon has been criticised as the UK government allows the usage of Manorial Titles in British passports of the form: &quot;THE HOLDER IS THE LORD OF THE MANOR/LAIRD OF [X]&quot; (brackets added). However, as a matter of Scots property law, souvenir plots cannot competently create a real right of ownership in Scots law. The Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 forbids the registration of deeds relating to souvenir plots in the Land Register of Scotland. This means that the Buyer obtains no legal right &quot;of&quot; or &quot;to&quot; ownership of the souvenir plot in any event, so the evidence threshold required by HM Passport Office to use the Manorial Title will be unlikely to be met. Evidence of ownership of property would typically be the production of a Title Sheet to the property or a formal and valid disposition, which the souvenir plot documents are unlikely to contain.

Richard Bridgeman, 7th Earl of Bradford, estimates these sellers having an income of US$2,918,520 per acre (about US$7.2 million per hectare) of poor land, which he suggests could probably be purchased for about US$100. Some of these sellers enclose with the invalid deed a coat of arms; this is not authorised by the Lord Lyon, and so it is unlawful in Scotland to use it. The most recent advice from the Lord Lyon specifically states that the award of a coat of arms is not appropriate to the owner of a souvenir plot, such as sold in these schemes.

===Manorial lordships===
The title lord of the manor has feudal origins and is a title of property ownership that is legally capable of sale. The owner of a Lordship of the Manor is known as [personal name], Lord/Lady of the Manor of [place name]. According to the style guide Debrett&#x27;s, a person owning a Scottish Barony title is afforded a particular style, but English lordships of the manor are not mentioned.

There are three elements to a manor:
*lordship of the manor, 
*manorial land,
*manorial rights.

These three elements may exist separately or be combined; however the lordship of a manor may be held in moieties and may not be subdivided; this is prohibited by the Statute of &quot;Quia Emptores&quot; 1290, preventing subinfeudation (except in Scotland, where feudal rights resulting from subinfeudation were extinguished only with the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000). However the second and third elements can be subdivided.

In many cases, the title of lord of the manor may no longer be connected to land or other rights. In such cases, the title is known as an &quot;incorporeal hereditament&quot;. Before the Land Registration Act 2002 it was possible to register lordship titles; most did not seek to register. Since 13 October 2003 one cannot apply for first registration of a title of a manor; however, dealings in previously registered titles remain subject to compulsory registration with HM Land Registry. A frequent criticism of the lordships sold at auction is that statutory declarations are relied upon to substitute for missing historical deeds and transfer documents which would, in some cases, demonstrate that the manor in question either no longer exists, can no longer be identified definitively or is not available for sale.

According to John Martin Robinson, Maltravers Herald Extraordinary and co-author of &quot;The Oxford Guide to Heraldry&quot;, &quot;Lordship of this or that manor is no more a title than Landlord of The Dog and Duck&quot; (&quot;The Dog and Duck&quot; being a stereotypical name for a pub, with &quot;landlord&quot; being the usual term for someone who runs such an establishment). However, the journal &quot;Justice of the Peace &amp; Local Government Law&quot; advises that the position is unclear as to whether a lordship of the manor is a title of honour or a dignity, as this is yet to be tested by the courts. Technically, lords of manors are barons, or freemen; however, they do not use the term as a title. John Selden, in &quot;Titles of Honour&quot;, wrote in 1672, &quot;The word &quot;Baro&quot; (Latin for &#x27;baron&#x27;) hath been also so much communicated, that not only all Lords of Mannors have been from ancient time, and are at this day called sometimes Barons (as in the stile of their Court Barons, which is &quot;Curia Baronis, &amp;c&quot;. And I have read &quot;hors de son Barony&quot; in a barr to an Avowry for &quot;hors de son fee&quot;) But also the Judges of the Exchequer have it from antient time fixed on them.&quot;

Some companies claim to be selling manorial lordships when in fact they are actually selling nothing more than a trademark. For this reason, careful legal advice should be sought before entering into any transaction purporting to be selling a lordship of a manor.

=== Channel Islands fiefs ===
The Channel Islands have a long and storied history, with human habitation tracing back thousands of years. In 911 AD, the Viking leader Rollo was granted lands around Rouen that later evolved into the Duchy of Normandy. In the resource-scarce 10th century, land was the primary means of rewarding loyal followers.

Much like in France, the Channel Islands were organised into a feudal, pyramidal structure - with the King/Duke at the top, seigneurs (lords) in the middle, and residents/serfs at the bottom. Seigneurs held significant political, social, and economic rights over the inhabitants of their fiefs (estates).

While most feudal institutions have disappeared in the 21st century, the Channel Islands&#x27; unique system of fiefs has endured. A &quot;seigneur&quot; is the title given to the male lord of a manor, while a &quot;dame&quot; is the equivalent title for a female fief holder or the wife of a male seigneur.

Purchasing a Channel Island fief is possible for anyone, regardless of nationality or citizenship. However, this occurs infrequently, as fiefs tend to pass down within families. Conveyance requires legal representation, approval by the Royal Court of Guernsey or Jersey, and registration with the Greffier (record keeper).

The number of extant fiefs is estimated at 116 in Jersey, 73 in Guernsey, and 1 on Sark. At least 37 have been acquired by the Crown over time. Seigneurs often hold multiple fiefs - in Guernsey, 46 fiefs are held by just 24 seigneurs.

Channel Island seigneurs maintain significant rights and roles in the modern era. They can defend manorial rights in court, attend Royal Court annually to pay homage, and host traditional dinners. Fief courts, presided over by officials like the Sénéschal and Prévôt, still function with legal authority.

While smaller than English manors or Scottish baronies, Channel Island fiefs can still be substantial, with the largest (&quot;Fief le Roi&quot; in Guernsey) comprising over 800 acres. Fiefs often consisted of non-contiguous parcels across multiple parishes.

One enduring feudal institution is the &quot;congè&quot; - a tax paid upon the transfer of fief land. This tax survived in Guernsey until 1985, when it was redirected to the island government rather than the seigneur. On Sark, the congè persisted until 2006. The continued existence of this tax represents &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of the seigneurial system by the Crown.

===Changes of name===

Some companies sell individuals a title when in fact they do no more than offer them the facility to change their name. Such an individual adopts the purported title, e.g. &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot;, as a forename rather than receiving any formal title. This practice is lawful so long as no claim of noble title, knighthood etc. is made as, in British law, a person may adopt any name provided its purpose is not fraudulent. HM Passport Office is aware of this practice and will place an official observation in the individual&#x27;s passport stating that the purported title is a name rather than the person&#x27;s title.

===English feudal baronial titles===
Whether English feudal barony titles are valid is unclear.

==Continental European titles==
All of Europe&#x27;s monarchies, except Norway, recognise nobility and hereditary titles. Their royal and princely courts also allow their use as courtesy titles by persons entitled to them under former monarchical regimes, unless they are accredited (e.g., to the Court of St. James&#x27;s) in a diplomatic capacity without the use of their historical titles. Such courtesies do not imply a legal right to any title in the titleholder&#x27;s homeland, although foreign nobles may be incorporated into another realm&#x27;s nobility with a variation of the family&#x27;s original noble title upon being naturalised in some monarchies (Belgium, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands).

Many who choose to invent false titles of nobility take advantage of the pool of formerly genuine titles of nobility that derive from a time when a country, now a republic, was once a monarchy; for example Austria, Hungary and the many parts of Germany that once had princely rulers who granted noble titles. One advantage of assuming such a title, is that, contrary to the situation involving the British nobility, there is usually no longer any official arbitrator who can or will judge between two separate claimants to such a title. In some such countries, titles may nevertheless be protected by an appropriate law, such as France, or by an extension of copyright law, as in Portugal.

===Austria===
Titles were hereditary for all legal descendants in the male line, male and female; primogeniture was not usual. Austria, however, legally abolished its nobility and hereditary titles after World War I and bans the use of noble titles and nobiliary particles.

===Finland===
Finland became a republic in 1917, and issue of new titles and substantial privileges of the estates of the realm were abolished by 1920. However, the nobility was not abolished, and they retain exclusivity to their surnames by personal name laws. Claiming a false title of nobility for purposes of marriage remains a criminal offense.

===France===
Although France has been a Republic since 1870, titles are protected by law. The Departement of Justice maintains a register of titles and can deliver decrees of investiture to heirs of titles whose succession has been recognized. This investiture is needed to use a title legally, but many members of former noble families use so-called &quot;courtesy title&quot; without much sanction.

===Germany===
German royalty and nobility bore hereditary titles, noble titles being heritable to all legitimate descendants in the male line, male and female: primogeniture was not usual except in the Kingdom of Prussia. The German nobility lost its hereditary prerogatives, including rank, style and honorifics following the fall of the German Empire in 1918. Article 109 of the 1919 Weimar Constitution declared that &quot;noble ranks are regarded as part of the (sur-)name only&quot;. Persons legally adopted by former nobles, like e.g. Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, can acquire the surname (Prinz von Anhalt), but do not become members of the nobility (in this case, they do not become a prince, as such a thing has not legally existed for over a century).

===Italy===
Some vendors of fake titles claim to arrange for the customer to acquire an Italian title based on adoption or even through notarial acts ceding the titles to the customer. In Italy, where titles of nobility have not been officially recognised since 1948, and where nobility by feudal tenure was abolished in most regions during the years immediately before 1820, an adoptive child cannot succeed to his adoptive parent&#x27;s title, and no legal act can serve to renounce a hereditary title. Claims to sell titles of nobility linked to ownership of a certain estate or castle are based on equally misguided misconceptions. No Italian publication or record, not even the &quot;Consulta Araldica&#x27;s&quot; official registry (the &quot;Libro d&#x27;Oro&quot; now retained at the Central Archives of the State in Rome), is a truly complete record of Italy&#x27;s nobles and armigers.

Several legitimate titles recognised in the pre-unitary Italian states (the Two Sicilies, Tuscany, Parma, Modena, the Papal States), as well as San Marino, were not recognised in the Kingdom of Italy between 1860 and 1948. In most cases, these were small baronies, minor lordships (&quot;signorie&quot;) or untitled ennoblements (&quot;patrizi&quot; and &quot;nobili&quot;). In connection with this, some Sicilian titles could devolve to female heiresses in the absence of close male kin, and in a few instances, there are claimants (in female lines) in Spain as well as Italy, the former looking to Two Sicilies (pre-1860) legislation and the latter citing Italian (post-1860) law. Most of the parallel claims (usually by Spanish citizens) were made after 1948 when the &quot;Consulta Araldica&quot; (Italy&#x27;s heraldic authority) was suspended by the Italian constitution, which abolished recognition of titles of nobility.

With the advent of the republican constitution after the Second World War, Italy decided to include noble titles in the name. In the same constitution, in the &quot;transitional and final provisions&quot; the founding fathers decided to join the noble title to the name for living persons only and make it impossible to hand down the title even to natural children. Similar titles (such as &quot;Knight of the Republic&quot; or &quot;Cavaliere del Lavoro&quot;) can be delivered on an exclusive, non-hereditary and symbolic basis only by the President of the Republic.

===Norway===
Recognition of Norwegian noble titles was gradually abolished by the Nobility Law of 1821. Persons who in 1821 possessed such titles were allowed to keep them for their lifetimes.

There exists no law that prohibits private use of noble titles. Such privately adopted titles lack official recognition.

Noble names enjoy no particular legal protection. In accordance with the Name Law&#x27;s paragraph 3, any family name with 200 or fewer bearers is protected and may not, without all bearers&#x27; acceptance, be adopted by another.

===Poland===
Unlike other European states except Hungary, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its predecessor states did not have a noble class divided into dukes, counts, barons, etc. The privileged noble/gentleman class, the &quot;szlachta&quot;, were all theoretically equal to each other and made up 6–12% of the population. The problem of false claims to &quot;szlachta&quot; was widespread in the 16th century, Hieronim Nekanda Trepka denouncing such fakes in &quot;Liber generationis plebeanorium&quot;.

After the Partitions of Poland (1772–95) the Polish state ceased to exist. Some Polish notables received titles of Russian nobility, Prussian nobility or Austrian nobility.

Because there was no Polish state and a wide Polish diaspora, it became easy for Poles to claim to be exiled nobility, whether they had &quot;szlachta&quot; ancestors or not. The &quot;fake Polish count&quot; became a stock character in 19th- and 20th-century literature.

Fiction featuring fake Polish nobility includes: the novels &quot;The Idiot&quot;, &quot;The Green Face&quot; and &quot;The Whispering City&quot;, and the films &quot;Roberta&quot; (1935) and &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;.

Real-life people who falsely claimed to be Polish nobles include:
* Christoph Bienenfeld (Baron Hönig von Bienenfeld)
* Roger de la Burde
* Marek and Andrew Kasperski
* Casimir Markievicz, who married the Irish leader Constance Gore-Booth. She continued to be known as &quot;Countess Markievicz&quot;
* Paweł Strzelecki, although born into the szlachta, was called a &quot;Count&quot; in Australia, but it is not clear if he used the title himself.
* Józef Boruwłaski, a Polish-born dwarf and musician who settled in Durham, England, and is buried in the Cathedral there. A portrait and his clothes survive in the Town hall, and a small folly by the river is named &#x27;The Count&#x27;s House&#x27; as he was erroneously thought to have lived there.

==Irish titles==
It is unclear whether Irish feudal barony titles are valid.

<text>2575 Bulgaria, provisional designation , is a stony Florian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 4 August 1970, by Russian astronomer Tamara Smirnova at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj, on the Crimean peninsula. It was named for country Bulgaria.

== Classification and orbit ==

&quot;Bulgaria&quot; is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,225 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the SMASS taxonomy, &quot;Bulgaria&quot; has been classified as a Sr-type, which transitions from common S-type asteroids to the rather rare R-type asteroids.

&quot;Bulgaria&quot; has a rotation period of 8.6 hours and an albedo of 0.24, as assumed by the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after the European country Bulgaria. At the time of naming, it was the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria (1946–1990), a former satellite state of the Soviet Union and member of the Warsaw Pact. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 13 July 1984 ().

<text>The masu salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus masou&quot;), also known as masu () or in Japan, is a species of salmonid belonging to the genus &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot;, found in the North Pacific along Northeast/East Asian coasts from the Russian Far East (Primorsky, Kamchatka Peninsula, Sakhalin and Kuril Islands) to south through Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Although generally accepted as a salmon in the West, the fish is actually regarded as a trout in Japan (its most famous native range) as it is the most commonly seen freshwater salmonid in the Japanese archipelago.

A number of subspecies are known, including the widespread nominate subspecies &quot;yamame&quot; (&quot;O. m. masou&quot;), the critically endangered Formosan salmon (&quot;O. m. formosanus&quot;) in landlocked waters of Taiwan, the Biwa trout (&quot;O. m. rhodurus&quot;) endemic of Lake Biwa, and the anadromous &quot;amago&quot; (&quot;O. m. macrostomus&quot;) restricted to western Japan.

==Appearance==

A masu salmon which has reached sexual maturity has a darkened back, and the stripes on the body sides become bright red with crimson tinge to merge on the abdomen into one common longitudinal band of lighter color. For this reason, it was given the name cherry salmon.

As adults, masu salmon tend to weigh and measure roughly in length. The maximum size that can be attained by this species (which is in the region of Primorsky Krai) is long and in weight.

==Ecology==
On average, this salmon prefers a temperate climate around the latitude of 65–58°N, and in the sea, it prefers a depth of .

===Life cycle===

Like other Pacific salmon, masu salmon’s biological life cycle is subdivided into freshwater and marine periods; in rivers, this species lives from 1 to 3 years and can form living freshwater forms. The sea lifecycle, depending on the age of the young, continues for 2.0 to 3.5 years. In the sea, the masu salmon feeds intensely on crustaceans, less often on young fish. On attaining sexual maturity, in its third to seventh years of life, it enters rivers to spawn. Its spawning run starts earlier than that of other salmon species.

After spawning, most passing fish die, and those that remain alive (preferentially dwarf males) participate in spawning the next year, too. Emerging from the nest, the young do not travel to the sea immediately, but remain in spawning areas, in the upper reaches of rivers, and on shallows with weak currents. The young move to pools and rolls of the river core to feed on chironomids, stone flies, and may fly larvae, and on airborne insects. The masu salmon travels to the ocean in its second, or occasionally even third year of life.

==Economic importance==
This salmon, like most others, is a highly commercial species caught in fisheries, raised for aquaculture, and sought after as a game fish. It is marketed fresh and frozen and is often eaten broiled or baked.

==Subspecies and morphs==

* &quot;O. m. masou&quot; — Masu salmon, anadromous (sea-run) form; landlocked populations also called 
** &quot;O. m. ishikawae&quot; — , black-spotted form; landlocked populations also called 
** &quot;O. m.&quot; var. &quot;iwame&quot; — , recessive spotless form
* &quot;O. m. rhodurus&quot; — Biwa trout, in Lake Biwa of western Japan 
* &quot;O. m. macrostomus&quot; — Red-spotted masu salmon; endemic to western Japan
* &quot;O. m. formosanus&quot; — Formosan salmon, Lishan trout () or Slamaw trout (the Tayal name for Lishan), landlocked form endemic to mountainous central Taiwan

<text>The University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette, University of Louisiana, ULL, or UL) is a public research university in Lafayette, Louisiana, United States. It has the largest enrollment within the nine-campus University of Louisiana System and the second-largest enrollment in Louisiana, behind only Louisiana State University. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

Founded in 1898 as an industrial school, the institution developed into a four-year university during the twentieth century and became known by its present name in 1999. It offers Louisiana&#x27;s only Ph.D. in francophone studies, Louisiana&#x27;s only master&#x27;s of informatics, and Louisiana&#x27;s only industrial design degree. The university has achieved several milestones in computer science, engineering and architecture. It is also home to a distinct College of the Arts.

==History==

On July 14, 1898, the Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute (SLII) was created through state legislation: Louisiana General Assembly, Act 162, introduced by Robert Martin of St. Martin Parish. The new school needed to be located within Louisiana&#x27;s 13th State Senate district.

A number of communities sought the school, including Jeanerette and St. Martinville, but only three submitted formal bids—Lafayette, New Iberia, and Scott. Lafayette Parish voters approved a parish-wide tax of two mills for 10 years if either Lafayette or Scott was selected; neither Iberia Parish nor St. Martin Parish was able to do the same, instead passing only city-wide taxes. Lafayette&#x27;s offer—the tax proceeds, $18,000 in cash, and 25 acres of land just outside the city limits, donated by Crow and Maxim Girard—beat out New Iberia&#x27;s 5–2 in a board vote on January 5, 1900.

The first university president was Edwin Lewis Stephens. On September 18, 1901, the first buildings were opened—initially Martin Hall (named for Robert Martin), Foster Hall (named for Governor Murphy J. Foster), and a shop building. The first class was 100 students enrolled and 8 faculty, and by 1903 the first graduating class was 18 students.

By 1920, the school changed to a four-year course culminating with a bachelor of arts degree. The following year in 1921, the school was renamed Southwestern Louisiana Institute of Liberal and Technical Learning (SLI).

By 1960, the school was renamed University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL).

In 1974, the College of Sciences was officially formed. In 1984, following approval from the Board of Trustees for State Colleges and Universities (now UL System), USL officially changed its name to the University of Louisiana, which was overturned less than a month later by an act of the state legislature, although two schools had previously changed their names using the same technique without outside interference. The school was renamed in 1999, to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette).

==Campus==

The campus of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette is located in Lafayette, Louisiana, within the intrastate region of Acadiana.

===Main campus===
The historic main campus area originally consisted of only 25 acres, and its boundaries were Johnston Street, University Avenue, what is now Hebrard Blvd and to approximately Lee Hall in the Quad. By the 1930s the campus had more than doubled in size, to 60 acres, reaching to the newly constructed St Mary Street to its south, and McKinley Street to its east. This area includes such buildings/areas as: Martin Hall (Admin building), Girard Hall, Stephens Memorial, the Arcade, the Quadrangle (the Quad), Rose Garden dormitories, Judice-Rickles Halls, and Cypress Lake. Also, the two oldest extant buildings on campus are located in this area: Foster Hall (1902) and DeClouet Hall (1905).

==== The Quadrangle ====

The Quadrangle (Quad), which was completely renovated in 2015 (providing new walkways, landscaping and a fountain containing a 15-foot Fleur de Lis in its center), serves as the &#x27;heart&#x27; of the university. It is surrounded by Martin Hall/FG Mouton Hall, as well as Moody, OK Allen, Lee, Broussard, Stephens, Mouton, M. Doucet, and Foster Halls. Some of the highlights of the Quad are:
::Martin Hall: Originally called &quot;the main building&quot; was the first building constructed on campus, and was completed in September 1901. Now sometimes referred to as &quot;Old&quot; Martin Hall, it stood on campus until 1963, when it was demolished and replaced with the current &quot;New&quot; Martin Hall. It is where the university president and administrative staff for the university are located.
::The Arcade: A covered, brick walkway that both surrounds and defines the quad. Built in 1940, and consisting of 415 brick arches, It also is where the &quot;Walk of Honor&quot; begins.
::Walk of Honor: This feature honors every one of the undergraduates of the university, from 1903 onward, with a paver engraved with their name and year of graduation. Originally contained in the Arcade only, it now extends to the sidewalks within the Quad, continuing outside the Quad along Boucher Ave, and then turning onto McKinley. Future plans are that it will eventually turn onto St. Mary, heading towards Boucher Street.
::The Fountain: Located in the center of the Quad is a circular fountain, with an aluminum, 15&#x27; three-sided Fleur de Lis sculpture as its centerpiece. Designed by over 100 UL students over a five year period, the sculpture weighs over 3,000 pounds. Surrounded by benches it provides a popular gathering spot for students. Once the landscaping has fully matured, it is hoped that this will further give an oasis type feeling to the area.

==== Rose Garden Dormitory Complex ====
Located on the campus block bordered by Hebrard Blvd, University Ave and McKinley St, the original Rose Garden was surrounded by Baker-Huger, Randolph, Evangeline, and Bonin Halls, which were all female-only dormitories and designed by A. Hays Town and completed in 1950. In 2011 Baker-Huger, Evangeline and Bonin Halls were all demolished and were replaced with expanded/state of the art co-ed dormitories, named Coronna and Bonin Halls, now known as the Rose Garden complex.

==== Cypress Lake and Student Union Complex ====

::Cypress Lake and Cypress Lake Plaza: One of the most beloved features on the campus, Cypress Lake is a university landmark that is also a habitat for native irises, alligators, turtles, birds and fish, as well as a hangout for students and a point of interest for tourists visiting Lafayette, Louisiana. Cypress Lake is casually called &quot;The Swamp,&quot; which is also the nickname of the Louisiana Ragin&#x27; Cajuns football stadium, officially named Cajun Field. This ecosystem, located in the center of a university, it the only one of its kind in the United States. Many school traditions are held on/around the lake, especially during &quot;Lagniappe Day.&quot; Cypress Lake Plaza is a green space that was constructed in 2018-2019, following the removal of the former student union complex located along Hebrard Blvd. The new Plaza allows for more interaction between the students/faculty/alumni/public and Cypress Lake as well as allows Cypress Lake to be viewable from Hebrard Boulevard.
::Student Union Complex: At 128K sq feet and completed in 2015 the new &quot;U&quot; was built to wrap around Cypress Lake, and includes numerous meeting spaces for students, as well several dining options (including the main dining room located on the second floor with floor to ceiling windows offering sweeping views of the lake), SGA offices, a post office, banquet space and a movie theater (the &quot;Bayou Bijou.&quot;)

====Expansion, 1950–2024====
The decades of the 1950 to 1970s saw tremendous growth, both in the city of Lafayette as well as the university. During that period the main campus again expanded: to the east (Taft St), west (Rex St), and south (Lewis St) bringing the total amount of acreage for the main campus to an approx. 125 acres. Many new academic buildings were located in this area including Dupre Library, HL Griffin Hall (liberal arts), Billeaud Hall (biology), Madison Hall (engineering), Wharton (nursing), Angelle (music), Fletcher (art/architecture).

In 2012, and as part of the selling of its &quot;Horse Farm&quot; property to the city of Lafayette, the university acquired an additional 20 acres along the Johnston/Lewis St corridor when the Youth Park/Dog Park was added to the main campus. In fall 2018, this area was being developed as housing for upperclassmen, and is called the &quot;Heritage at Cajun Village.&quot; With the addition of these 20 acres, the total acreage for the main campus is now at 145 acres.

Law enforcement services on the campus are provided by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Police Department.

===== Fletcher Hall and Marais Press =====
The Marais Press began in the early 1990s, a printmaking shop featuring antique presses and located within Fletcher Hall and the Department of Fine Arts. The first project was a book featuring the work of the late Elemore Morgan Jr., a Louisiana artist who taught at the university and received international acclaim for his work as a painter and photographer. More than 200 visiting artists from around the world participate for a week-long residency to work on their projects at Marais Press, a teaching and research hub. Artists help train and mentor students, who get hands-on experience making lithographs, woodcuts, silkscreen, and etchings.

Marais Press is a separate entity from the UL Press, the publishing arm of UL Lafayette&#x27;s Center for Louisiana Studies.

===Health Science Campus===
Beginning in 2022, the University finalized the purchase of 2 separate properties that were formally used as Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center&#x27;s location and consists of a total of approximately 25 acres. 

Ideally located between the main campus and the University Commons (which includes the main athletic facilities) and Research Park, this purchase creates a natural bridge, helping to unite the various locations, and which is in accordance with the school&#x27;s 2012 Master Plan.

====2022 Diocese of Lafayette purchase====
In the summer of 2022 UL finalized the purchase of approximately 5.8 acres of land owned by the Diocese of Lafayette and which included several structures that were part of Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center campus. The 5.834-acre tract is located at West St. Mary Boulevard and St. Landry Street and includes several structures. 

===2023 Our Lady of Lourdes purchase===
In the spring of 2023, the university finalized the purchase of approximately 19.2 acres that were formally used as the Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center campus.

===University Commons===
Starting with the purchase of the Whittington Farm property in 1936, the university added about 175 acres just south of the main campus, along Johnston St. This area, now also consisting of the Athletic Complex and Research Park areas form a total contiguous area of over 391 acres, known today as University Commons.

====Athletic Complex====
Due to the continuing growth of the university during the 1950s, &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, all of the main athletic facilities were relocated from the main campus to the University Commons area, and is bounded roughly by Reinhardt Dr, Bertrand St, Congress St and State St. The following is a list of major buildings in the complex:

Located along Coliseum Road, the complex consists of a newly constructed Field House, as well as ~20 lighted acres of grassy fields, and convenient parking. This space enables the university the ability to offer numerous sports/activities to the student population.

===Research Park===
Bounded by Cajundome Blvd, E. Landry Road, and Congress St, the Research Park was conceived and developed to be a stimulant for innovation and economic development that serves the region, state, and nation. The following is a list of major buildings located in the park:
::University Research Park Hotel: Owned by the university, the hotel is a Hilton Garden Inn property. The 155-room hotel includes both classroom and faculty office accommodations and is collaboratively run with the UL Hospitality Management Program.
::Lafayette Primary Care Center: LPCC is a joint effort among Ochsner Lafayette General Medical Center and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The facility is owned by the university, was paid for by Lafayette General Medical Center and Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center. It is operated by Ochsner Lafayette General Medical Center and its mission is to train medical residents in family practice.
::CGI Group: CGI Group (more commonly known as CGI) is a Canadian global information technology company that offers many different IT-related services, including consulting, systems integration, outsourcing, and solutions. The company is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Currently employing 400 full-time people in its Lafayette location, that number is expected to more than double in the near future.
::Estuarine Habitats and Coastal Fisheries Center: Owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the center opened in 1998 and has numerous high-profile tenants, including: National Marine Fisheries Service, National Ocean Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Resources Conservation Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, etc.
::Louisiana Immersive Technologies Enterprise (LITE Center): A collaboration between UL and the Lafayette Economic Development Authority (LEDA), the LITE Center is housed in a $27 million, 70,000 square foot complex. The LITE Center is a comprehensive and tightly integrated data visualization and super-computing installation.

==Research==
The university is a member of the Southeastern Universities Research Association and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. In 2023, the university posted a record-breaking amount of $181 million, exceeding the previous year&#x27;s amount of $144 million and represents an astonishing 165% increase in R&amp;D spending at UL in seven years. The 2019 amount placed UL among the top 23 percent of the 647 research universities; current rankings are not yet available. It is the stated mission of UL&#x27;s Strategic Plan to reach Carnegie Classification Research 1 status and surpassing the $100 million threshold is a major step in that direction. The university receives more research money than all of the other ULS schools, combined, and is rated one of the top 100 public research universities in the nation according to a 2010 report by The Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. In 2012, it became the first Louisiana university designated as an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center. The Center for Visual and Decision Informatics is the only NSF Center in the nation that focuses on data science, big data analytics, and visual analytics.

===New Iberia Research Center===
UL&#x27;s New Iberia Research Center in New Iberia conducts basic and applied research on several species of non-human primates including macaques, grivets, capuchins and chimpanzees. Incorporated as the Gulf South Research Institute in 1965, the facility was transferred to UL in 1984. The Center houses over 6,800 non-human primates used for breeding and studies. The center is also a contract breeding and testing facility, selling animals to other laboratories and conducting experiments under contract with other parties.

In 2008, the Humane Society of the United States conducted an undercover investigation in the center which found monkeys being shot with sedation guns while in their cages, one monkey repeatedly hit by a worker in the teeth with a metal pole and another worker striking an infant monkey among other apparent AWA violations. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture cited the center for six potential violations of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) which the government alleges lead to the death of one monkey, injuries to another and the escape of five from their enclosure.

In 2016, Project Chimps, a nonprofit organization, announced a partnership with NIRC to relocate 220 of the university&#x27;s retired research chimpanzees to a sanctuary in northern Georgia.

==Campus publishing==
In the 1960s, a group of liberal arts professors at the University of Southwestern Louisiana began publishing their works under the imprint USL History Series. Then, in 1973, the Center for Louisiana Studies was established, and the organization took on the publication of these works, in addition to &quot;publications drawn from research in the Center&#x27;s Colonial Records Project, proceedings from historical associations and conferences, and works translated by Center staff&quot;. 

Over the next few decades, the center&#x27;s publications grew to include scholarship beyond the university as well as new genres, such as children&#x27;s books, photography, poetry, and fiction. In 2009, its imprint was changed to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Press, publishing as the UL Press. The Press welcomes submissions of manuscripts pertaining to all facets of Louisiana&#x27;s history, culture, art, society, politics, economics, religion, ethnicities, and environment. It also welcomes high quality works of fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction.

Today, the UL Press is the largest academic publisher of Louisiana-related works and one of the two largest academic publishers in the state. The press is an introductory member of the Association of University Presses.

==Athletics==

The Louisiana Ragin&#x27; Cajun teams participate in NCAA Division I (FBS for football) in the Sun Belt Conference. The Ragin&#x27; Cajuns compete in 16 NCAA sports teams (8 men&#x27;s, 8 women&#x27;s teams), including baseball, basketball (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), cross country (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), football, softball, women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s golf, tennis (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), and track and field (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s, indoor and outdoor).

The athletic program formally began in 1904 with a track and field program. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the softball team has been among the most successful of all Ragin&#x27; Cajun teams, having won twenty-two regular season championships, seventeen conference tournament championships, and earning six appearances in the Women&#x27;s College World Series. The baseball, men&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s basketball, and football teams have won conference championships.

In 2014, the Cajuns became the first in college football bowl history to win the same bowl game in four straight seasons. However, the university vacated all of its 2011 wins, including the New Orleans Bowl, two years later when the NCAA sanctioned the university because an assistant football coach conspired to &quot;obtain fraudulent entrance exam scores&quot; for five recruits from 2011 until 2013. The university dismissed the coach in 2014 and sued the testing company in 2016 for failing to adequately supervise their staff and testing procedures. The NCAA accepted the university&#x27;s self-imposed penalties including a two-year probation, a small fine, a small reduction in football scholarships, and recruiting restrictions.
In recent years, Ragin&#x27; Cajuns football has been on the rise, becoming nationally ranked during the 2020 and 2021 seasons with Billy Napier at the helm of the program.

==Student life==

There are over 200 student organizations.

The Louisiana Center for Cultural &amp; Eco-Tourism center&#x27;s research division houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of Cajun and Creole folklore, oral history, and folklife materials and some of the nation&#x27;s largest microfilm collections of French and Spanish colonial records.

===Residential life===
Beginning in 2011 the university began a massive program to overhaul its residential options for students. Since that time, the majority of the school&#x27;s former dormitories have been demolished and replaced with either apartment or suite style accommodations. The first phase of the initiative began in 2003, with the demolition of three of the male-only dorms: Caffery, Roy and McCullough. They were replaced with Legacy Park in 2004, an apartment-style complex that is also co-ed. (Another male-only dorm, Voorhies Hall, was also razed in 2003, but the Child Development complex was built in its place.) The final male-only dorm, Stokes Hall, was demolished in 2016, with the long-term plan of expanding Legacy Park into the area.

In 2011 the second phase of the project began when most of the traditional female-only dorms were demolished and replaced with suite-style, co-ed, units. The dorms demolished during this period included: Baker-Huger, Bonin, Evangeline, Denbo, and Bancroft. The two resulting areas are now known as the Rose Garden Complex (lower classmen), and the Taft Street Complex (upper classmen); 2018 saw the start of the third phase of the project when construction began on a new complex located at the corner of Johnston and Lewis streets. This area formerly consisted of a university-owned parking lot, as well the Youth/Dog Park, which the university acquired as part of the sale of the &quot;Horse Farm&quot; property to the City of Lafayette. Named &quot;The Heritage at Cajun Village,&quot; the new complex is designated for married students/families and graduate students. Following the completion of the complex (fall 2019) the married/family complex &quot;Cajun Village&quot; has been planned for eventual demolition and replaced with suite-style living for upper classmen.

 only three of the original dorms on campus remain standing: Randolph Hall (now functioning as a recreational center for residents), Agnes Edwards Hall (now co-ed/junior suite-style) and Harris Hall (now co-ed/traditional-style). Following the completion of Heritage, as well as Rose Garden and Taft Street complexes, the university could house close to 5,000 students on campus, achieving a goal set in the school&#x27;s master plan as of 2020.

===Greek life===
The Greek community at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette is composed of 23 organizations. In 2022, 6% of undergraduate men and 13% of undergraduate women were active in the UL&#x27;s Greek system.

==Notable firsts==

==Name==
During Rajput era the king of Chauhan dynasty Sumershah had gone to the bank of the Yamuna river in Etawah, where he saw an incredible act of nature. He saw a goat and a wolf drinking water together on the bank of the Yamuna. After seeing this incident, the king went to astrologers and consulted about the incident, who advised him to build a fort at the place where the wolf and the goat were drinking water together. According to astrological calculation, building a fort would benefit the king.When construction work of the fort started at the decided location, then, while digging foundation the laborers working there found a brick of gold and silver, which made them excited and they started shouting &quot;Eeet Mili, Eeet Mili&quot; after hearing which the place was named as &quot;Eeet Aaya&quot; which later turned into ‘Etawah’.

Etawah is still sometimes referred to as the city of bricks and both tradition and the appearance of the ground suggest that the modern city was founded on an ancient Khera or town site, so that it is not improbable that the existence of old bricks or old brick kilns may have led to its present name. According to some scholars, the region from Bateshwar in district Agra to Bhareh was known as ‘Ishtapath’ and there are a large number of temples of Lord Siva, who was ‘Isht Dev’ of the people of that region. From the word ‘Isht’ the town was given the name of Ishtkapuri a reference to which is found in Bhavishya Puran.

==History==

===Ancient era===

It is believed that the land existed right from the Bronze Age in the medieval times. It once formed part of the ancient country of Panchala which is said to have extended from the foot of the Himalayas in the north to the river Chambal in the south. This region rose into great prominence during the period of Mahabharata. Many local traditions are attached to the modern Chakar Nagar which is a tehsil nearby which most probably seems to be Ekchakra mentioned in Mahabharata. It was Ekchakra where Pandavas along with their mother Kunti spent their secret abode of one year during the period of their exile. There is a belief that the city was founded by King Bharat. During the fourth century A.D., Guptas once again established imperial unity in India. The Chinese traveler Fa-Hien also visited a city named ‘A-lo i.e. Alvi, which has been identified with modern Airwa nearly town, and spent his treat at the Dragon Shrine. Fa-Hien described it as &quot;a city near a large forest&quot; (atavi). There are the remains of Buddhist and Jain temples evidently of every ancient date in large number. In the ninth and tenth centuries, this region was under the rule of Gurjara Pratihara rulers. The conquest of Kannauj by Nagabhata II handed Pratiharas control over this region. But the place was said to be evolved as an affluent region under Mihir Bhoj, the Pratihara King.

With the coronation of Harsha as a king (in 606 AD) the city came under the Thaneshwar dynasty. Hiuen Tsang in his works has also dwelt upon the prosperity of this region.

===Medieval Era===
The defeat of Jaichandra of Kannauj in the Battle of Chandawar in 1193 A.D at the hands of Shahab-ud-din Ghori, the city passed under influence of Muslim power, which by end of the century held in different degrees of subjection the whole of North India except Malwa and some contiguous districts. Muslim rule in Etawah faced Maratha invasion for short period within their rule in Etawah. However, the local history of the city during the early years of the thirteenth century is more or less the account of the settlement and emergence of certain Rajput clans. The Gaurs occupied part of Phaphund and Bidhuna near the Kanpur boundary, both falling in turn to Chandelas of Mahoba. The Chauhans occupied the western portion of the district, with extensive tracts now in Mainpuri. During this period; however, some disturbance related to tax arouse in Nasir-ud-din Muhammad Shah&#x27;s rule, yet these issues were put to end by Tomar ruler of Gwalior in 1390. In 1400–1401 Mallu Iqbal Khan marched towards this region and was opposed by Rai Sumar Singh or Sabir of Etawah and other Zamindars of the vicinity on the banks of the Ab-i-Siyah (Kali Nadi) near Patiali. The opposing army of Rai was defeated and chased down to the confines of Etawah where they took shelter.

Etawah was associated with various important historical events like Jaunpur Campaign, reigns of rulers like Bahlul Lodi, Ibrahim Lodi, Babur, Humayun and Akbar. In the fourth year of Akbar&#x27;s reign, Bahadur Khan, a younger brother of Ali Quli Khan, was granted the Jagir of Etawah at the insistence of Maham Anka, the foster mother of the Emperor. After this, Etawah district underwent major changes during reign of Rohillas and the Oudh Government.

===Colonial Era===
The cession on 10 November 1801, the city was made over to the British Government by the Nawab Saadat Ali Khan together with the rest of the lower Doab and other tracts. This action was taken in return for a guarantee of protection, and by way of payment for the maintenance of the Oadh local forces which were ultimately stationed at Kanpur. Still for some years Etawah was threatened with Maratha inroads, while scenes occurred with the zamindars in the earlier years of the British administration which recall the experiences of the imperial officers in the 16th century, and it was not until the zamindars of Saudaus, Sahson and Kamait had been finally settled with in 1816 A.D.

===The Revolt of 1857===
On 25 December 1857, a British Column arrived in the city. Kunwar Johar Singh now surrounded and blew up the Etawah tahsil building from where Taj Khan was resisting the British advance. On 6 January 1858, the British reoccupied Etawah, but struggle was hardly crushed.

===Freedom Struggle===
In 1907 rumours were afloated in Etawah that Zorawar Singh Nigam, had organized a conspiracy to throw out the British. But on enquiry it was found baseless and a person Khalil who was responsible for the rumour, was arrested and sentenced. In 1914–15, the city came into prominence as a centre of revolutionary activity when Gendalal Dixit, a teacher at Auraiya nearby town, formed the Shivaji Samitti with object of liberating the country. Gendalal Dixit had also organized a group of young men called ‘Matri-Vedi’.

In 1920 Mahatma Gandhi launched his non-cooperation movement all over the country. In Etawah, the response of the people to this movement was enthusiastic and wide spread. In 1920–21, the district congress committee was formed with Maulana Rahamat Ullah as its president. In 1925, Jyoti Shankar Dixit of Etawah was arrested in connection with the Kakori conspiracy case but later released. In 1928, boycott of the Simon Commission; followed by; the civil disobedience movement in 1930 and Quit India Movement 1942 were started in Etawah, as in other parts of the country.

<doc id="637731" wikidata="Q2351248" url="?curid=637731" title="Linus Van Pelt">
<text>Linus Van Pelt is a fictional character in Charles M. Schulz’s comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;. He is the best friend of Charlie Brown, the younger brother of Lucy Van Pelt, and the older brother of Rerun Van Pelt. His first appearance was on September 19, 1952, but he was not mentioned by name until three days later. He was first referred to two months earlier, on July 14. Linus spoke his first words in 1954, the same year he was first shown with his security blanket. Linus is named after Schulz&#x27;s friend Linus Maurer.

The character&#x27;s creator, Charles M. Schulz, has said of the character, &quot;Linus, my serious side, is the house intellectual; bright, well-informed which, I suppose, may contribute to his feelings of insecurity.&quot; Lee Mendelson, producer of the majority of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials, has said that Linus is his favorite character: &quot;He made sucking your thumb and holding a security blanket OK. I think he&#x27;s one of the most original fictional characters of all time—blending childish behavior with great wisdom.&quot;

==Personality== 
Though young, Linus is intelligent and wise and acts as the strip&#x27;s philosopher and theologian, often quoting the Gospels. Juvenile aspects of his character are also displayed; for example, Linus is almost always depicted holding his blue security blanket, for which he is often mocked by other characters, and he often sucks his thumb. Linus is the only member of his group who believes in the Great Pumpkin, an alternative Santa Claus–like figure who, according to Linus, appears every Halloween, arising from the most &quot;sincere&quot; pumpkin patch and bearing gifts. He occasionally temporarily convinced other characters that the Great Pumpkin is real, only to stubbornly maintain his faith when they lose theirs.

In the strip from June 9, 1986, Linus claims that his birthday is in October. Lucy gives him a chair for his birthday in the November 22, 1964, Sunday strip.

==Appearance== 
Linus has brown hair and hazel eyes and normally wears a red striped shirt, black shorts, red socks, and dark brown tennis shoes. On February 5, 1962, Linus began wearing eyeglasses after being diagnosed with myopia, but after the Sunday strip of September 9, 1962, the glasses were not seen again. In an earlier strip of July 17, 1962, Linus had told Charlie Brown that his ophthalmologist said that he may not have to wear his glasses all the time, which thus explains their eventual disappearance. In a 1985 interview, Schulz said he stopped putting glasses on Linus because it interfered with his expression lines.

== Relationships ==
Linus is often bullied by his older sister, Lucy Van Pelt, to which he responds by either giving in or taking revenge. He is Charlie Brown&#x27;s best friend; Linus became sympathetic towards Charlie Brown and often gave him advice after listening to Charlie Brown&#x27;s various insecurities. 

Upon the introduction of Charlie Brown&#x27;s little sister, Sally Brown, in 1959, Linus had the desire to marry her. As the strip progressed, he outgrew this idea. Meanwhile, Sally proceeded to fall in love with Linus, calling him her &quot;Sweet Babboo,&quot; much to his displeasure. Linus, in turn, has an innocent unrequited love crush on his school teacher, Miss Othmar.

<text>A pop icon is a celebrity, character, or object whose exposure in popular culture is regarded as constituting a defining characteristic of a given society or era. The usage of the term is largely subjective since there are no definitively objective criteria. The categorization is usually associated with elements such as longevity, ubiquity and distinction. Moreover, &quot;pop icon&quot; status is distinguishable from other kinds of notability outside pop culture, such as with historic figures. Some historic figures are recognized as having reached &quot;pop icon&quot; status during their era, and such status may continue into the present. Pop icons of previous eras include Benjamin Franklin and Mozart.

==Attributes and origins==
Historians Asa Briggs and Peter Burke, explained that term &quot;iconography&quot; would pass into high culture, and later in the twentieth century, into popular culture, where &quot;icon&quot; refers to a secular celebrity like Madonna. She probably had a catalyst role, as Marcel Danesi, a professor of semiotics and linguistic anthropology at the University of Toronto cited in &quot;Language, Society, and New Media: Sociolinguistics&quot; that the word &quot;icon&quot; is a &quot;term of religious origin&quot; and arguably &quot;used for the first time in celebrity culture to describe the American pop singer Madonna&quot;. Danesi also asserts that the word &quot;is now used in reference to any widely known celebrity, male or female&quot;. Some international reference works such as &quot;Oxford Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Diccionario panhispánico de dudas&quot; have included Madonna&#x27;s name to illustrate the new meaning of &quot;icon&quot;. After &quot;The Advocate&quot; called her the &quot;greatest gay icon&quot;, Guy Babineau from &quot;Xtra Magazine&quot; stated in 2008: &quot;I&#x27;m old enough to remember when people weren&#x27;t called icons&quot;. 

===Longevity===
Usually, the pop icon status of a celebrity is contingent upon longevity of notoriety. This is in contrast to cult icons, whose notoriety or recognition may be limited to a specific subculture. Some pop icons have left a lasting and indelible mark in the area of their career, and then went on to attain a lasting place of recognition in society at large.

===Ubiquity===
A common element of pop icon status is the ubiquity of imagery and allusions to the iconic figure. It is common for the figure to be recognized and even celebrated in areas outside the original source of celebrity status. An example of this is Albert Einstein, a physicist whose image and legacy have been represented in comic strips, T-shirts, greeting cards and many other contexts.

==Distinction==
Often pop icon status implies distinguished association with a societal ideal or archetype. It is not uncommon for iconic figures to have a nickname or sobriquet that is used to emphasize this association. Sometimes the very name of such individuals is even used as a synonym for common words or ideas.

Some fictional characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, the Simpsons, Harry Potter, Goku, Sailor Moon, Alice, and Willy Wonka are regarded as pop icons. Even objects have been recognized as pop icons. 

Some figures attain transitory or context-specific &quot;pop icon&quot; status for particular events that captivate public attention, such as in the case of the O.J. Simpson trial.

<doc id="637733" wikidata="Q899456" url="?curid=637733" title="Pockels effect">
<text>In optics, the Pockels effect, or Pockels electro-optic effect, is a directionally-dependent linear variation in the refractive index of an optical medium that occurs in response to the application of an electric field. It is named after the German physicist Friedrich Carl Alwin Pockels, who studied the effect in 1893. The non-linear counterpart, the Kerr effect, causes changes in the refractive index at a rate proportional to the square of the applied electric field. In optical media, the Pockels effect causes changes in birefringence that vary in proportion to the strength of the applied electric field.

The Pockels effect occurs in crystals that lack inversion symmetry, such as monopotassium phosphate (, abbr. KDP), potassium dideuterium phosphate (, abbr. KD*P or DKDP), lithium niobate (), beta-barium borate (BBO), barium titanate (BTO) and in other non-centrosymmetric media such as electric-field poled polymers or glasses. The Pockels effect has been elucidated through extensive study of electro-optic properties in materials like KDP.

==Pockels cells==
The key component of a Pockels cell is a non-centrosymmetric single crystal with an optic axis whose refractive index is controlled by an external electric field. In other words, the Pockels effect is the basis of the operation of Pockels cells. By controlling the refractive index, the optical retardance of the crystal is altered so the polarization state of incident light beam is changed. Therefore, Pockels cells are used as voltage-controlled wave plates as well as other photonics applications. See applications below for uses. Pockels cells are divided into two configurations depending on the crystals&#x27; electro-optic properties: longitudinal and transverse.

Longitudinal Pockels cells operate with electric field applied along the crystal optic axis or along incident beam propagation. Such crystals include KDP, KD*P, and ADP. Electrodes are coated as transparent metal oxide films on crystal faces where the beam is propagating through or metal rings (usually made out of gold) coated around the crystal body. Terminals for voltage application are in contact with the electrodes. The optical retardance &quot;Δφ&quot; for longitudinal Pockels cells proportional to the ordinary refractive index &quot;n&quot;o, electro-optic constant &quot;r&quot;63 (units of m/V), and applied voltage &quot;V&quot; and inversely proportional to the incident beam wavelength &quot;λ&quot;0. For an example, the halfwave voltage is approximately 7.6 kV for a KDP crystal with a &quot;n&quot;o = 1.51, &quot;r&quot;63 = 10.6X10-12 m/V at &quot;λ&quot;0, and Δφ = π. The advantage of using longitudinal Pockels cells is that the voltage requirements for quarter wave or half wave retardance is not dependent on crystal length or diameter.

Transverse Pockels cells operate with electric field being applied perpendicular to beam propagation. Crystals used in transverse Pockels cells include BBO, LiNbO3, CdTe, ZnSe, and CdSe.
The long sides of the crystal are coated with electrodes. Optical retardance &quot;Δφ&quot; for transverse Pockels cells is similar to that of longitudinal Pockels cells but it is dependent on crystal dimensions. The quarter wave or half wave voltage requirements increase with crystal aperture size, but the requirements can be reduced by lengthening the crystal.

Two or more crystal can be incorporated into a transverse Pockels cell. One reason is to reduce the voltage requirement by extending the overall length of the Pockels cell. Another reason is the fact that KDP is biaxial and possesses two electro-optic constants, &quot;r 63&quot; for longitudinal configuration and &quot;r 41&quot; for transverse configuration. A transverse Pockels cell that uses a KDP (or one of its isomorphs) consists of two crystals in opposite orientation, which together give a zero-order waveplate when the voltage is turned off. This is often not perfect and drifts with temperature. But the mechanical alignment of the crystal axis is not so critical and is often done by hand without screws; while misalignment leads to some energy in the wrong ray (either &quot;e&quot; or &quot;o&quot; for example, horizontal or vertical), in contrast to the longitudinal case, the loss is not amplified through the length of the crystal.

Alignment of the crystal axis with the ray axis is critical, regardless of configuration. Misalignment leads to birefringence and to a large phase shift across the long crystal. This leads to polarization rotation if the alignment is not exactly parallel or perpendicular to the polarization.

=== Dynamics within the cell ===
Because of the high relative dielectric constant of εr ≈ 36 inside the crystal, changes in the electric field propagate at a speed of only &quot;c&quot;/6. Fast non-fiber optic cells are thus embedded into a matched transmission line. Putting it at the end of a transmission line leads to reflections and doubled switching time. The signal from the driver is split into parallel lines that lead to both ends of the crystal. When they meet in the crystal, their voltages add up.
Pockels cells for fiber optics may employ a traveling wave design to reduce current requirements and increase speed.

Usable crystals also exhibit the piezoelectric effect to some degree (RTP () has the lowest, BBO and lithium niobate are the highest). After a voltage change, sound waves start propagating from the sides of the crystal to the middle. This is important not for pulse pickers, but for boxcar windows. Guard space between the light and the faces of the crystals needs to be larger for longer holding times.
Behind the sound wave the crystal stays deformed in the equilibrium position for the high electric field.
This increases the polarization. Due to the growing of the polarized volume the electric field in the crystal in front of the wave increases
linearly, or the driver has to provide a constant current leakage.

=== The driver electronics ===
A Pockels cell, by design, is a capacitor, and often require high voltages to change the state of the polarization of the laser beam to effectively operate as a switchable waveplate. The voltage required depends on the type of Pockels cell, the wavelength of the light, and the size of the crystal; but typically, the voltage range is in the order of 1-10 kV. Pockels cell drivers provide this high voltage in the form of very fast pulses, which typically have rise times of less than 10 nanoseconds.

There are basically two types of drivers: a quick or Q drive which has a fast rise time, then slowly decays. A Pockels cell that uses a Q-drive is sometimes referred to as a Q-switch. The other type of driver is referred to as a regenerative or R drive. R drives will have a fast rise time and a fast fall time. The driver&#x27;s output pulse width can be from nanoseconds to microseconds long, depending on the application. The type of drive and its repetition rate will depend on the laser and the intended application.

===Applications===
Pockels cells are used in a variety of scientific and technical applications. A Pockels cell, combined with a polarizer, can be used for switching between initial polarization state and half-wave phase retardance, creating a fast shutter capable of &quot;opening&quot; and &quot;closing&quot; in nanoseconds. The same technique can be used to impress information on the beam by modulating the rotation between 0° and 90°; the exiting beam&#x27;s intensity, when viewed through the polarizer, contains an amplitude-modulated signal. This modulated signal can be used for time-resolved electric field measurements when a crystal is exposed to an unknown electric field.

Pockels cells are used as a Q-switch to generate short, high-intensity laser pulse. The Pockels cell prevents optical amplification by introducing a polarization dependent loss in the laser cavity. This allows the gain medium to have a high population inversion. When the gain medium has the desired population inversion, the Pockels cell is switched &quot;open&quot;, and a short high energy laser pulse is created. Q-switched lasers are used in a variety of applications, such as medical aesthetics, metrology, manufacturing, and holography.

Pulse picking is another application that uses a Pockels cell. A pulse picker is typically composed of an oscillator, electro-optic modulator, amplifiers, high voltage driver, and a frequency doubling modulator along with a Pockels cell. The Pockels cell can pick up a pulse from a laser induced bunch while blocking the rest by synchronized electro-optic switching.

Pockels cells are also used in regenerative amplifiers, chirped pulse amplification, and cavity dumping to let optical power in and out of lasers and optical amplifiers.

Pockels cells can be used for quantum key distribution by polarizing photons.

Pockels cells in conjunction with other EO elements can be combined to form electro-optic probes.

A Pockels cell was used by MCA Disco-Vision (DiscoVision) engineers in the optical videodisc mastering system. Light from an argon-ion laser was passed through the Pockels cell to create pulse modulations corresponding to the original FM video and audio signals to be recorded on the master videodisc. MCA used the Pockels cell in videodisc mastering until the sale to Pioneer Electronics. To increase the quality of the recordings, MCA patented a Pockels cell stabilizer that reduced the second-harmonic distortion that could be created by the Pockels cell during mastering. MCA used either a DRAW (Direct Read After Write) mastering system or a photoresist system. The DRAW system was originally preferred, since it didn&#x27;t require clean-room conditions during disc recording and allowed instant quality checking during mastering. The original single-sided test pressings from 1976/77 were mastered with the DRAW system as were the &quot;educational&quot;, non-feature titles at the format&#x27;s release in December 1978.

Pockels cells are used in two-photon microscopy to adjust the transmitted laser intensity at a time scale of microseconds.

In recent years, Pockels cells are employed at the National Ignition Facility located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Each Pockels cell for one of the 192 lasers acts as an optical trap before exiting through an amplifier. The beams from all of the 192 lasers eventually converge onto a single target of deuterium-tritium fuel in hopes to trigger a fusion reaction.

<doc id="637741" wikidata="Q939538" url="?curid=637741" title="Kennedy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>Kennedy is a fictional character in the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Portrayed by Iyari Limon in the TV series, the character was introduced in the seventh and final season of the series and goes on to appear in the comic book series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot;, which continues the story of the television series.

Kennedy is introduced as a &quot;potential Slayer&quot;: one of many girls who might become endowed with supernatural abilities, destined to battle evil creatures such as vampires and demons, like protagonist Buffy Summers. Distinctly, Kennedy is also a love interest for Willow Rosenberg; Kennedy is openly lesbian with an assertive personality, which contrasts with the shyness of Willow&#x27;s deceased girlfriend, Tara. In the series finale of &quot;Buffy&quot;, Willow magically activates the potential in all girls like Kennedy to become full-fledged Slayers, like Buffy. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named her one of the &quot;21 Most Annoying TV Characters Ever&quot;.

==Appearances==

===Television===
Kennedy only appears in the seventh and final season of the television series. Kennedy is one of the first three Potential Slayers to arrive in Sunnydale. She comes from a wealthy family in New York City and has at least one sibling—a half-sister. An out lesbian, Kennedy has known about her sexuality since the age of five (commenting that she found out watching &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;). Kennedy is immediately interested in having a romantic relationship with Willow when the two meet in the season 7 episode,&quot;Bring on the Night&quot;.

Kennedy witnessed her Watcher&#x27;s death; he was murdered by Bringers, lackeys of The First Evil. Prior to being chosen she knew of the existence of Watchers and also demonstrated understanding of how the Slayer line works, indicating that she was approached by them during her youth, similar to late Slayer Kendra Young.

Kennedy becomes Willow&#x27;s lover before she fully comprehends Willow&#x27;s magical prowess. In the episode &quot;Get It Done&quot;, she gains first-hand understanding when Willow drains a significant portion of her life force in order to reopen a portal for Buffy. This puts a strain on their relationship until they eventually reconcile.

Kennedy becomes one of the more prominent Potentials, overseeing their training in &quot;Get It Done&quot;, and giving them orders in &quot;End of Days&quot; while Buffy is absent and Faith is incapacitated. She supports Willow in her attempt to activate all Potential Slayers. After Willow&#x27;s activation spell is completed, Kennedy joins Buffy and the other Potentials in the final battle against the First Evil&#x27;s army of Turok-Han as a fully activated Slayer.

In season 5 of &quot;Angel&quot;, a year after the end of &quot;Buffy&quot;, it is mentioned that Kennedy and Willow are living in Brazil together.

===Literature===

Kennedy continues to appear in literary follow-ups to the television series. In &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; (2007–2011), an in-canon comic book series, in the story titled &quot;The Long Way Home, Part III&quot;, Buffy catches up with Willow in Scotland, after the latter&#x27;s year long absence. During this conversation, Buffy asks how Kennedy&#x27;s doing and Willow reveals that she died, though it was only a short-lived mystical death. However, this impeded her and Willow&#x27;s relationship. In the issue &quot;Anywhere but Here&quot;, a flashback recounts a conversation that reveals that Kennedy is worried that Willow keeps her away from Buffy&#x27;s inner circle because she is ashamed of her. Willow explains that she blames herself for Tara&#x27;s death because she kept her close to Buffy and therefore to danger. Willow then states that she refuses to let that happen to Kennedy. In &quot;Season Eight&quot;, Kennedy directs an army of slayers in New York, along with Vi. She and Willow finally reunite in the fourth arc of the series, &quot;Time of Your Life&quot;, in which Buffy is accidentally sent to the future and Kennedy is helping Willow in an attempt to bring her back. Over the course of the series, Willow remains distant from Kennedy, in part because she is having a sexual relationship with her magical mentor, the demon Aluwyn. Kennedy antagonizes Buffy when she learns of Buffy&#x27;s lesbian affair with the Slayer Satsu, in part fearful that Buffy will pursue Willow, and later helps Satsu get over Buffy. It becomes clear that this fear is unfounded. In &quot;Retreat&quot;, Kennedy and her unit are forced to regroup with Buffy&#x27;s main unit as the Big Bad, Twilight, closes in on them. She fights alongside the main Scoobies up until the finale &quot;Last Gleaming&quot;. In its aftermath, after Buffy&#x27;s actions have brought about the end of magic, Kennedy is dumped by Willow, who is in turmoil as a result of the loss of her powers and her connection to Aluwyn.

In &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine&quot; (2011–2013), Kennedy first appears in the &quot;Guarded&quot; story arc where it was revealed that since the disbandment of Buffy&#x27;s Slayer organization, Kennedy has established a private security firm employing Slayers to protect its high-profile clients. Buffy joins Kennedy&#x27;s organization, and before long it becomes apparent that their client—a social network founder and Internet billionaire—is on the run from the demonic law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart, who funded his website&#x27;s development and plan to use it to return from their extra-dimensional exile. Buffy and Kennedy defeat the threat and shut down the site, and though Buffy quits the job, Kennedy pays her handsomely for her services. Kennedy&#x27;s company has made her a millionaire and she sends Buffy a private jet so the trio of Buffy, Xander and Willow are able to fly from San Francisco to the Deeper Well in England in an effort to save Dawn&#x27;s life. At the conclusion of the &quot;Season Nine&quot; companion series &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot;, Faith leaves Angel in an effort to find her own direction in life and mentions Kennedy offered her a job as a trainer for the Slayer bodyguards. Kennedy next appears on a recurring basis in the second volume of &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; (2014–), as well as in crossover scenes in the first two issues of &quot;Buffy Season Ten&quot;. In the first arc, &quot;Where the River Meets the Sea,&quot; she attempts to smooth out Faith&#x27;s rough edges and help her new recruit adjust to life on the payroll, but not without difficulty—both from younger Slayers who resent Faith, and by the difficulty Faith has with the business taking on demons as clients. As Faith is about to quit, however, Kennedy offers her a mission to find Riley Finn, who has gone missing in South America. After leading a team to successfully to save Riley, his wife Sam and the woman Reese Zane who runs a pharmaceutical company, Faith quits Deepscan to work for Reese. Reese is starting to look at the ways magic altered the humans in London&#x27;s new Magic Town ghetto, taking Faith back to Angel.

<doc id="637742" wikidata="Q4735212" url="?curid=637742" title="Alphabetical Africa">
<text>Alphabetical Africa is a constrained writing experiment by Walter Abish. It is written in the form of a novel. Writing in &quot;Esquire&quot;, Harold Bloom put it on a list of 20th century novels that will endure.

A paperback edition was issued in New York by New Directions Publishing in 1974 with . It was still in print in 2004.

== The Constraint ==

The writing is restricted by a pseudo-alliterative rule of the lipogram type: the first chapter contains only words starting with the letter &quot;a&quot;, the second chapter only words starting with &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;, etc.; each subsequent chapter adds the next letter in the alphabet to the set of allowed word beginnings. This continues for the first 25 chapters, until at last Abish is (briefly) allowed to write without constraint.

In the second half of the book, through chapter 52, letters are removed in the reverse order that they were added. Thus, &quot;z&quot; words disappear in chapter 27, &quot;y&quot; in chapter 28, etc...

== Errors ==

Readers have noted that there are several places in the narrative where the constraint is violated. Most counts of these violations number them between four and six; however, up to 43 have been noted by astute readers. One point of dispute is whether the failures to meet the constraint are intentional, and therefore potentially meaningful, or are simply editing mistakes. It is said that when Abish was notified of the errors, he reacted with total surprise. Two of the errors were &quot;I&quot;&#x27;s found later in the book, situated next to the margins, most likely overlooked during editing. Similar mistakes of spelling and grammar occur in other Abish works, such as &quot;How German Is It&quot; (1980), where exact presentation is clearly a priority, and thus the mistakes come across as intentional.

<text>Tuakau () is a town in the Waikato region at the foot of the Bombay Hills, formerly part of the Franklin District until 2010, when it became part of Waikato District in the North Island of New Zealand. The town serves to support local farming, and is the residence of many employees of New Zealand Steel at Glenbrook.

==Toponymy==
The place name is believed to be a geographical reference to the high bluff nearby that offers views down the Waikato river. In Māori the word can mean &#x27;to stand&#x27; and &#x27;river bank&#x27;.

==History and culture==

===Pre-European history===

The area was first used as a trading centre for passing waka that would transport goods up and down the Waikato River.

===European settlement===

A flax mill was built in 1855.

In 1863 war broke out because the British Crown forced the Waikato people out of their lands just south of the river and the New Zealand Government stationed in Tuakau Imperial troops brought over from Great Britain. To help defend the area the Alexandra Redoubt was built as a defensive fort on the bluff near the river. The existing town which was originally intended to be built closer to the Waikato River was subsequently built in an area 2 km further inland.

The railway from Auckland reached Tuakau in 1875, when the Tuakau Railway Station was opened.

===Recent history===
By 1914 the people of Tuakau had formed their own town district which went on to achieve borough status on 1 January 1955. During its 44 years as a borough, Tuakau had seven mayors:

Amalgamations since 1989 has seen it first become part of the Franklin District governed by a district council and then in 2010 with border changes saw it became part of Waikato district when present-day Auckland Council boundaries were created.

===Marae===

Tuakau has two marae (Maori sacred or communal place), affiliated with the hapū (Māori sub-tribe or clan) of Waikato Tainui (a tribal confederation based in the Waikato Region). Ngā Tai e Rua Marae and its Ngā Tai e Rua meeting house are a meeting place Ngāti Āmaru, Ngāti Koheriki and Ngāti Tiipa. Tauranganui Marae and its Rangiwahitu meeting house are a meeting place for Ngāti Āmaru Ngati Rangiwahitu , Ngati Kaiaua and Ngāti Tiipa.

== Bridges ==

=== Tuakau Bridge ===

The town&#x27;s &#x27;Tuakau Bridge&#x27; replaced the need for a ferry from November 1902. A span of the original wooden bridge collapsed on 23 August 1929 and was replaced by the current £24,000 ($2.9m at 2015 prices), bridge from 22 June 1933, designed by Jones &amp; Adams, who also built Horotiu (1921), Te Aroha (1926), Ngamuwahine River (1930) and Fairfield bridges (1937). It was once part of State Highway 22.

=== Gas pipeline aerial crossing ===
About upstream from Tuakau Bridge, at the end of Brown Rd, the river is crossed by the First Gas 400-line gas transmission pipe, which supplies gas from the Maui gas pipeline at Rotowaro to Auckland and Northland. The pipe crosses on a , 11 pier, truss bridge, above the water, which was built in 1980 and renovated in 2007.

<doc id="637763" wikidata="Q3640984" url="?curid=637763" title="Third-degree atrioventricular block">
<text>Third-degree atrioventricular block (AV block) is a medical condition in which the electrical impulse generated in the sinoatrial node (SA node) in the atrium of the heart can not propagate to the ventricles.

Because the impulse is blocked, an accessory pacemaker in the lower chambers will typically activate the ventricles. This is known as an &quot;escape rhythm&quot;. Since this accessory pacemaker also activates independently of the impulse generated at the SA node, two independent rhythms can be noted on the electrocardiogram (ECG).
* The P waves with a regular P-to-P interval (in other words, a sinus rhythm) represent the first rhythm.
* The QRS complexes with a regular R-to-R interval represent the second rhythm. The PR interval will be variable, as the hallmark of complete heart block is the lack of any apparent relationship between P waves and QRS complexes.

==Presentation==
People with third-degree AV block typically experience severe bradycardia (an abnormally low measured heart rate), hypotension, and at times, hemodynamic instability.

==Cause==
Many conditions can cause third-degree heart block, but the most common cause is coronary ischemia. Progressive degeneration of the electrical conduction system of the heart can lead to third-degree heart block. This may be preceded by first-degree AV block, second-degree AV block, bundle branch block, or bifascicular block. In addition, acute myocardial infarction may present with third-degree AV block.

An inferior wall myocardial infarction may cause damage to the AV node, causing third-degree heart block. In this case, the damage is usually transitory. Studies have shown that third-degree heart block in the setting of an inferior wall myocardial infarction typically resolves within 2 weeks. The escape rhythm typically originates in the AV junction, producing a narrow complex escape rhythm.

An anterior wall myocardial infarction may damage the distal conduction system of the heart, causing third-degree heart block. Initially demonstrated by animal studies, this is due to a stark reduction in the Kv β-subunit of the voltage-gated K+ channels in the pacemaker cells of the atrioventricular junction, causing significantly decreased propagation of ions across gap junctions between cardiac cells and thus prolonging the PR interval. This is typically extensive, permanent damage to the conduction system, eliciting a necessity for a permanent pacemaker to be placed. The escape rhythm typically originates in the ventricles, producing a wide complex escape rhythm.

Third-degree heart block may also be congenital and has been linked to the presence of lupus in the mother. It is thought that maternal antibodies may cross the placenta and attack the heart tissue during gestation. The cause of congenital third-degree heart block in many patients is unknown. Studies suggest that the prevalence of congenital third-degree heart block is between 1 in 15,000 and 1 in 22,000 live births.

Hyperkalemia in those with previous cardiac disease and Lyme disease can also result in third-degree heart block.

=== Hypermagnesemia ===
AV block may be observed in patients with hypermagnesemia who are receiving excessive intravenous doses of magnesium sulfate.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is largely focussed on analysis of the patients 12-lead ECG. A patient with a third-degree AV block will likely have p-waves not corresponding to QRS complexes along with bradycardia.

==Treatment==
Atropine is often used as a first line treatment of a third-degree heart block in the presence of a narrow QRS which indicates a nodal block, but, may have little to no effect in an infra-nodal block. Atropine works by reducing vagal stimulation through the AV node but will not be effective in those who have had a previous heart transplant. Other drugs may be utilized such as epinephrine or dopamine which have positive chronotropic effects and may increase the heart rate. Treatment in emergency situations can involve electrical transcutaneous pacing in those who are acutely hemodynamically unstable and can be used regardless of the persons level of consciousness. Sedative agents such as a benzodiazepine or opiate may be used in conjunction with transcutaneous pacing to reduce the pain caused by the intervention.

In cases of suspected beta-blocker overdose, the heart-block may be treated with pharmacological agents to reverse the underlying cause with the use of glucagon. In the case of a calcium channel blocker overdose treated with calcium chloride and digitalis toxicity may be treated with the digoxin immune Fab.

Third-degree AV block can be treated more permanently with the use of a dual-chamber artificial pacemaker. This type of device typically listens for a pulse from the SA node via lead in the right atrium and sends a pulse via a lead to the right ventricle at an appropriate delay, driving both the right and left ventricles. Pacemakers in this role are usually programmed to enforce a minimum heart rate and to record instances of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation, two common secondary conditions that can accompany third-degree AV block. Since pacemaker correction of the third-degree block requires full-time pacing of the ventricles, a potential side effect is pacemaker syndrome, and may necessitate the use of a biventricular pacemaker, which has an additional 3rd lead placed in a vein in the left ventricle, providing more coordinated pacing of both ventricles.

The 2005 Joint European Resuscitation and Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines state that atropine is the first-line treatment especially if there were any adverse signs, namely: 1) heart rate &lt; 40 bpm, 2) systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mm Hg, 3) signs of heart failure, and 4) ventricular arrhythmias requiring suppression. If these fail to respond to atropine or there is a potential risk of asystole, transvenous pacing is indicated. The risk factors for asystole include 1) previous asystole, 2) complete heart block with wide complexes, and 3) ventricular pause for &gt; 3 seconds. Mobitz Type 2 AV block is another indication for pacing.

As with other forms of heart block, secondary prevention may also include medicines to control blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, as well as lifestyle and dietary changes to reduce risk factors associated with heart attack and stroke.

==Treatment==
Early treatment of atrioventricular blockade is based on the presence and severity of symptoms and signs associated with ventricular escape rhythm. Hemodynamically unstable patients require immediate medication and in most cases temporary pacing to increase heart rate and cardiac output.

Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, a potentially reversible cause should be evaluated and treated. If no reversible cause is identified, a permanent pacemaker is inserted. Most stable patients have persistent bradycardia-related symptoms and require identification and treatment of any reversible cause or permanent implantable pacemaker.

Reversible causes of complete AV block should be ruled out before the insertion of a permanent pacemaker, such as drugs that slow heart rate and which induce hyperkalemia.

Complete atrioventricular block in acute myocardial infarction should be treated with temporary pacing and revascularization.
Complete atrioventricular block caused by hyperkalemia should be treated to lower serum potassium levels and patients with hypothyroidism should also receive thyroid hormone.

If there is no reversible cause, the clear treatment of complete atrioventricular block is mostly permanent pacemaker placement.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of patients with complete heart block is generally poor without therapy. Patients with 1st and 2nd-degree heart block are usually asymptomatic.

<text>Morrinsville () is a provincial town in the Waikato region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. Morrinsville is a service town for the local dairy industry; the area surrounding the town has the highest concentration of dairy cattle in New Zealand.

==History and Culture==

===Pre-European settlement===
Prior to European settlement of New Zealand, the hills around present-day Morrinsville were occupied by the Ngati Werewere Māori people of the Ngati Haua Iwi, and the site of the present-day town was on or near to an old Māori route between the upper Waihou-Piako basin and the Ngāruawāhia area.

Following the arrival of Europeans, some early European traders are believed to have traversed this route prior to 1834 when the Rev. J. Morgan travelled up the Piako River to near the future town site and crossed west to Horotiu, near Ngāruawāhia. First recorded contact with European settlers in the area occurred around 1850, with John Johnson trading with the Māori from 1852.

===Post-European settlement===
The 1860s saw an influx of European settlers to the area between Te Aroha and Matamata, and on 13 December 1873 a settler from Auckland, Thomas Morrin, purchased the Kuranui No.1 Block from the local Māori and founded the Lockerbie Estate, which Morrin named after the Scottish town from which his father had emigrated. In May 1874, Morrin purchased two further blocks, Motumaoho No.1 and No.2, and his estate then totaled over . The fledgling village was to be the service centre for Morrin&#x27;s Lockerbie Estate and he built a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, manager&#x27;s house, the Jolly Cripple Hotel and general store and donated land for a school. Morrin hired Irish navvies from the gold fields to dig a network of ditches to drain the land, enabling it to be used for agriculture. In 1882 Morrin surveyed the land for the site of the town proper, and deposited plans for ten streets: Anderson, Hamilton, Studholme, Moorhouse, Lorne, Canada, Cureton, Somerville, Thames and Thorpe (the first and last three streets being named after family members).

The Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company began construction of a railway line from Morrinsville to Rotorua in 1879, and on 1 October 1884, the line from Hamilton to Morrinsville was opened. With construction progressing towards Paeroa and the line to Te Aroha opening on 1 March 1886, the town&#x27;s population was listed as 633 people. There were some proposals for lines to Matamata, Tirau, and Rotorua, which would have turned Morrinsville into an area where several lines meet, instead a railway line was built to Lichfield. In 1880 Morrinsville was a hamlet with her own school, post office, and hotel. With further expansion of the railway towards Thames and Tauranga, alongside extensive drainage of swamp land to the south and west of the town making available large areas for dairy farming. Morrinsville was declared a town district in 1908 and in 1921 was constituted as a borough.

In 1895 the first church in Morrinsville, an Anglican church, was constructed. In 1907 a police station was constructed. The resident constable also serviced Wardville, Gordon, and Waharoa.

In 1957 Morrinsville annexed land from Piako County. The expansion included land at the south-east up to the Piako River and the Waitakaruru Stream, alongside land near the Tahuna-Waharoa highway, and land around Avenue Road.

In the early 1900s a Māori canoe (waka) was discovered on a property in Tahuna. The waka, named &quot;Maungateroto&quot;, had been laying on the property under a tree for 60 years. The waka was placed outside the Morrinsville War Memorial Hall after being gifted to Morrinsville by Ngati-Paoa in 1968.

== Demographics ==
In 1881 Morrinsville had a population of 115, 30 years later it was 300. When Morrinsville was constituted as a town district in 1911 it had a population of 565. In 1971 Morrinsville&#x27;s population was 4,454.

Morrinsville covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, the town had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Morrinsville had a population of 7,761 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 768 people (11.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,158 people (17.5%) since the 2006 census. There were 2,934 households, comprising 3,699 males and 4,062 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.91 males per female, with 1,533 people (19.8%) aged under 15 years, 1,467 (18.9%) aged 15 to 29, 3,138 (40.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 1,626 (21.0%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 83.4% European/Pākehā, 18.1% Māori, 1.9% Pacific peoples, 6.9% Asian, and 1.4% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 12.7, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 52.6% had no religion, 34.5% were Christian, 0.9% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.9% were Hindu, 0.3% were Muslim, 1.5% were Buddhist and 2.2% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 747 (12.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 1,737 (27.9%) people had no formal qualifications. 924 people (14.8%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,027 (48.6%) people were employed full-time, 807 (13.0%) were part-time, and 198 (3.2%) were unemployed.

The Morrinsville East and West areas (2018 boundaries) had these census figures -

Apart from Morrinsville, the largest number of commuters go to Waihou from Morrinsville East and Tahuroa from West. In 2018 13.8% of the population of Morrinsville East and 25.1% of West were Māori.

==Education==

Morrinsville College is the town&#x27;s state secondary school, with a roll of .

Morrinsville Intermediate is the state intermediate school, with a roll of .

The town has two state primary schools for Year 1 to 6 students: Morrinsville School, with a roll of ; and David Street School, with a roll of ;

A third primary school, Motumaoho School, is located south-west of the town on State Highway 26; it has a roll of .

St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School is a state integrated Catholic primary school, with a roll of .

All these schools are co-educational. Rolls are as of 

==Economy==

Morrinsville&#x27;s economic growth is dependent on the surrounding countryside: the Piako country is one of the wealthiest farming areas in the world with the country being good for dairy cattle specifically.

Morrinsville was impacted by the Long Depression but weathered it better than other settlements due to its location on the railway line.

Morrinsville houses several factories involved in agricultural products such as a butter factory, which claims to be the first butter factory in the world to be fully automated, and a fertiliser factory.

==Transportation==
===Railway===

Historically, Morrinsville was the railway junction of the Auckland–Thames and Auckland–Rotorua lines, which subsequently became the Thames Branch and the East Coast Main Trunk Railway (Tauranga) lines. Morrinsville Railway Station was opened on 1 October 1884, to the east off Studholme Street, at the junction of the two lines. A footbridge over the track was opened in 1913, connecting the station with the town from the end of Canada Street. The station was described as consisting of &quot;two asphalt passenger platforms, and the station buildings contain a ladies&#x27; waiting room, a large general waiting room, a post office lobby with post and telegraph offices, a ticket office, and offices for the Inspector of Permanent Way. There are also large goods and engine sheds, and cattle loading yards. Five workmen&#x27;s cottages adjoin the station, and the Bank of New Zealand Estates Company has a large building connected with the siding for seed-cleaning and storage purposes.&quot; The station was moved about towards Hamilton in 1923. The original station building was demolished in 1984 and a smaller building was erected approximately 300 metres to the west off Marshall Street, which is still used by KiwiRail for freight services.

Passenger services are no longer provided to or from Morrinsville Railway Station. The Thames Branch closed on 28 June 1991 and the track subsequently lifted, although in 2004 a short shunt line – the Waitoa Industrial Line – reopened to facilitate freight trains for the Waitoa Dairy Factory. The East Coast Main Trunk Railway provided passenger services between Auckland and Rotorua – the Geyserland Express – and Auckland and Tauranga - the Kaimai Express; however, in 2001 it was announced that these services were too uneconomic to continue, and the last trains ran on 7 October 2001.

Passenger traffic reached a peak in 1944, as shown in this table and the graph -



===Road network===
Roads in Morrinsville were not metalled until the late 19th century. Roads in the town were dusty and uneven in summer and in winter they were too muddy for horses to progress at a canter. The ride from Annandale to the church in Morrinsville, which is two and a half miles, took an hour.

Transport out of Morrinsville was initially difficult with the only proper road leading to Mangateparu; however, it was quite treacherous and prone to flooding.

=== Walkways ===
A walkway runs beside Waitakaruru Stream and one of beside the Piako River. There was a plan in 2008 to combine these walkways into a route of . There are also shorter walkways on the north east edge of town.
==Notable places==
*The Nottingham Castle Hotel was originally built in 1875 as the &quot;Jolly Cripple&quot; and established as the Nottingham Castle Hotel in 1880. It burnt down in 1913 and was replaced in 1914. It is one of the oldest buildings in Morrinsville and serves a centre for the town.
===Reserves===
In 1970 a farm that bordered the Kuranui Reserve was purchased by the Piako County Council. This was gazetted as a reserve and named Roy Scott Recreation Reserve, in honour of the county chairman. In 1972 a further was added onto the reserve.

==Sports clubs==

<text>Peppermint Patty is a fictional character featured in Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Her full name, very rarely used in the strip, is Patricia Reichardt. She is one of a small group in the strip who live across town from Charlie Brown and his school friends (although in &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;, &quot;Snoopy in Space&quot;, and &quot;The Snoopy Show&quot; she, Marcie, and Franklin live in the same neighborhood and attend the same school). She has freckles and &quot;mousy-blah&quot; hair, and generally displays the characteristics of a tomboy. She made her first appearance on August 22, 1966. The following year she made her animated debut in the TV special &quot;You&#x27;re in Love, Charlie Brown&quot; and began (in the comics) coaching a baseball team that played against Charlie Brown, and thereafter had other adventures with him. Uniquely, she refers to Charlie Brown and Lucy as &quot;Chuck&quot; and &quot;Lucille&quot;, respectively. In most of her appearances, she is attracted to Charlie Brown, based on her reactions. Her birthday is October 4.

== History ==
Charles M. Schulz modeled Peppermint Patty after a favorite cousin, Patricia Swanson, who served as a regular inspiration for &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Schulz had also named his earlier character Patty after Swanson, and he coined his well-known phrase &quot;Happiness is a Warm Puppy&quot; during a conversation with her in 1959. Swanson&#x27;s roommate Elise Gallaway served as the model for Peppermint Patty&#x27;s best friend Marcie. In later years, especially after lesbian groups began identifying with Peppermint Patty, Schulz downplayed the fact that the character was based on Swanson to protect her privacy.

In one interview, Schulz stated that he coined Peppermint Patty&#x27;s name after noticing a dish of peppermint patties in his house and deciding the name was so good that he should use it before another artist thought of the same joke. He created the character design to fit the name. Peppermint Patty debuted in the strip of August 22, 1966. In 1972, Schulz introduced the character&#x27;s last name, Reichardt, which he borrowed from the last name of his secretary, Sue Reichardt, whose favorite character was Peppermint Patty.

Peppermint Patty was first voiced by Gabrielle DeFaria in the CBS television specials, then by various other child performers both male—such as Christopher DeFaria and Stuart Brotman—and female—including Donna Forman Le Tourneau (1974), Linda Ercoli (1974), Victoria Vargas (1983), Gini Holtzman (1984–1985).

== Theme song ==
Jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi composed the eponymous theme song for Peppermint Patty in 1967, making its first appearance in the television special &quot;You&#x27;re in Love, Charlie Brown&quot;. In his book &quot;Vince Guaraldi at the Piano&quot;, Guaraldi historian and biographer Derrick Bang wrote that the upbeat melody &quot;aptly conveyed her character&#x27;s feisty, tomboyish nature and just-under-the-radar feminism.&quot; Producer Lee Mendelson commented that Schulz was particularly fond of the theme Guaraldi wrote for the character.

Various renditions of Peppermint Patty&#x27;s theme song appeared in nearly every television special Guaraldi scored that the character appeared in, including &quot;He&#x27;s Your Dog, Charlie Brown&quot; (1968), &quot;It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown&quot; (1969), &quot;Play It Again, Charlie Brown&quot; (1971), &quot;There&#x27;s No Time for Love, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot; (both 1973), &quot;It&#x27;s the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown&quot; (1974) and &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Sport, Charlie Brown&quot; (1975). Unique variations of the song were commercially released on the albums &quot;Oh Good Grief!&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Charlie Brown Suite &amp; Other Favorites&quot; (recorded 1969, released 2003). It also was covered by George Winston on &quot;Linus and Lucy: The Music of Vince Guaraldi&quot; (1996) and David Benoit on &quot;It&#x27;s a David Benoit Christmas!&quot; (2020).

== Appearance ==
Peppermint Patty has chin-length hair that she describes as &quot;mousy-blah&quot;, most often depicted as a medium brown (though the color has sometimes appeared as orange-red or auburn, as in &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;), and has freckles. She wears a green, striped collared shirt, black or dark blue shorts (long pants in &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;) with two vertical white stripes on each side, and she almost always wears sandals (brown in the comic strip and merchandise; green in animated appearances except in &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;) with her toes showing. In one series of strips where she is forbidden to wear the sandals in school, it is revealed they were a gift from her father because she was &quot;a rare gem&quot;.

== Character traits ==
Peppermint Patty is noted for her persistent habit of profoundly misunderstanding basic concepts and ideas that most people would consider obvious, then blindly ignoring any counsel against her latest fixation which leads to ultimately embarrassing situations for which she blames those who warned her. For a long time, she was unaware that Snoopy was a dog, referring to him as &quot;a funny looking kid with a big nose.&quot; This was a recurrent gag in the strip until an incident (featured in a series of strips from March 1974) in which Patty declares she is through with school and plans to spend the rest of her days staying in &quot;Chuck&#x27;s guest cottage&quot; (Snoopy&#x27;s dog house). By the end of this story arc, Marcie angrily informs Peppermint Patty that the &quot;funny looking kid&quot; is actually a beagle, leaving Patty in stunned shock for several strips. In a later phone call to Charlie Brown, Patty finally accepts the truth: &quot;Let&#x27;s just say my pride had the flu, okay, Chuck?&quot;

She also thinks a school for gifted children means that enrolling will result in her receiving free gifts. She confuses a dog obedience school with a human private school, going so far as to enroll and graduate with the other dogs. Only later, when she tries to use that diploma to escape having to attend regular school, does she discover that she has publicly humiliated herself for a meaningless honor. Although initially angry with Snoopy, who had recommended the school to her, she forgives him after he rescues her from a fight with a cat named &quot;World War II&quot; (whom she mistook for Snoopy in a cat suit) that lives next door to Charlie Brown.

She is widely known for receiving a D− grade on every school assignment or exam (in 1999, the final full year of &quot;Peanuts&quot;, her teacher presents her with a certificate naming her to the &quot;D-Minus Hall of Fame&quot;). In one comic strip, Patty gets a Z−, which she calls &quot;sarcasm&quot;. In a series of strips in 1984, Peppermint Patty is held back a grade for failing all of her classes—only to be allowed to return to her old class when her old desk in front of Marcie starts to emit snoring noises, leading both students and faculty to suspect that a &quot;snoring ghost&quot; haunts the classroom.

Peppermint Patty&#x27;s bad grades are possibly exacerbated by her tendency to sleep during class due to being too insecure to sleep until her father returns home from working late. In one series of strips, Marcie suggests that Patty&#x27;s unrequited love for Charlie Brown (see below) causes her to fall asleep. At Marcie&#x27;s urging, Patty also goes to a sleep disorder treatment center to be tested for narcolepsy; it is reaffirmed that staying up too late at night, and not narcolepsy, causes Patty to sleep in class.

Peppermint Patty hires Snoopy twice to serve as her watchdog so she can sleep better at night, but both attempts are unsuccessful. The first time, Snoopy is unable to abandon her waterbed in the guest room to catch the burglars who are stealing from the house, and the second time, a girl poodle distracts him and becomes his fiancée (the engagement is called off on the day of the wedding), leading Patty to angrily call Charlie Brown late at night and order him to come to her house to replace Snoopy as watchdog. Besides guard duties, Peppermint Patty also retains Snoopy&#x27;s services in other ways, including as an attorney and as a figure skating coach.

Her full name, Patricia Reichardt, is first mentioned in the January 15, 1972, strip when she, with Snoopy acting as her attorney, openly challenges the school&#x27;s new dress code that forbids shorts and sandals.

Patty is the most &quot;tomboyish&quot; girl in the comic strip; she is a star athlete, especially in baseball where her team regularly trounces Charlie Brown&#x27;s. In the first series of strips in which Patty appeared in 1966, she actually joins &quot;Chuck&#x27;s&quot; team as its new pitcher, relegating Charlie Brown to the outfield. However, she quits in disgust after only one game; despite tossing a no-hitter and slamming five home runs, her new team loses, 37–5, because of their somewhat porous defense. On another occasion, she lets Charlie Brown throw the last pitch of the game, having pitched a no-hit game leading 50–0, only to see him lose the game 51–50.

Peppermint Patty lives with and is particularly close to her father, even though he apparently has to travel a lot. He refers to her as his &quot;rare gem&quot;, a nickname Patty loves. No siblings are ever mentioned. She has often lamented her lack of a mother to help her prepare for skating competitions and such:

:Peppermint Patty: &quot;Skating mothers are like stage mothers and swimming mothers. They grumble and complain and gossip and fuss, but you really need them!&quot;
:Marcie: &quot;How do they get that way, sir?&quot;
:Peppermint Patty: &quot;Early rising and too much coffee.&quot;

Peppermint Patty mentions her mother throughout the television special &quot;He&#x27;s Your Dog, Charlie Brown&quot;, but Schulz repeatedly stated that the situations presented in the cartoon adaptations are not canonical to the strip.

Peppermint Patty&#x27;s mother is the subject of the 2022 Apple TV+ special &quot;Snoopy Presents: To Mom (and Dad), With Love&quot;. Unhappy because everyone else has a mother to celebrate Mother&#x27;s Day with, she decides to celebrate her father instead, because he raised her by himself.

== Relationships with other characters ==
Peppermint Patty&#x27;s closest friend, Marcie, calls her &quot;sir.&quot; This trait follows one of Marcie&#x27;s prototype characters, a girl named Sophie for whom Patty was a summer camp counselor. For a long time, this was a major annoyance to Patty, who would continually snap at Marcie, &quot;Stop calling me Sir!&quot; Eventually, she got used to it; Patty&#x27;s final use of the catchphrase occurred in 1988. Marcie also called her &quot;Priscilla&quot; in &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot;; however, this is a continuation of a reference Linus had just made to Longfellow&#x27;s poem &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot; in which Standish asks John Alden to speak to Priscilla Mullins on his behalf (just as Peppermint Patty has asked Marcie to speak to Charlie Brown).

Not until a few years after she was introduced into the strip did it become apparent that Peppermint Patty had a crush on Charlie Brown, although it is pursued and received with varying degrees of projection, enthusiasm, and obliviousness, especially on the part of Charlie Brown. Peppermint Patty frequently plays lovers&#x27; games with Charlie Brown, and gets frustrated or even angry when he does not take the bait; he &quot;does&quot; like Peppermint Patty, but only as a friend (though their friendship is occasionally strained by her strong personality and bossiness toward him). Originally, Peppermint Patty played reverse psychology; she would often say, &quot;You kind of like me, don&#x27;t you, Chuck?&quot; when it was clear that it was Peppermint Patty who had the crush on Charlie Brown, while he not only did not have a crush on her, he also did not quite know what to make of her. His true love was the unattainable Little Red-Haired Girl, and having a girl actually like him was unexplored territory, although Peppermint Patty once angrily expressed her jealousy to Charlie Brown for his affection of that girl. Patty frequently denied having a crush on Charlie Brown at first, writing him off as too wishy-washy and because she &quot;could strike him out on three straight pitches&quot;, and during a game of crudely insulting him when she thought he was not listening. However, to her credit, she was shown to be visibly upset when Marcie pointed out that he had overheard her comments and apologized to him the very next day. Yet it was still obvious to Marcie that Peppermint Patty liked Charlie Brown as more than a friend, wishy-washy or not.

In one Sunday strip on July 22, 1979 (drawn as part of a storyline in which Charlie Brown was in the hospital), Peppermint Patty essentially admitted her feelings for Charlie Brown and, in the same strip, Marcie admitted loving &quot;Chuck,&quot; so far as to affirming her willingness to marry Charlie Brown. Even this strip ended in a denial of sorts; Patty brought Marcie up to the front desk of the hospital and tried to have her admitted as a patient, saying, &quot;I think she&#x27;s sicker than he is!&quot;

Peppermint Patty often tries to talk to Charlie Brown about matters of the heart (often depicted with both characters sitting under a tree) and even calls him often on the phone (usually taking up the majority of the conversation), but Charlie Brown usually manages to somehow evade the issue, often by simply playing dumb. Patty often grumbles, &quot;I hate talking to you, Chuck!&quot; whenever she tries to confide in him and he does not tell her what she wants to hear.

Peppermint Patty also developed a crush on Pig-Pen for a while in 1980, after Charlie Brown set them up on a date for a Valentine&#x27;s Day dance. Also, in the movie &quot;Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown&quot;, both she and Marcie were shown as being attracted to Pierre, the son of their host family in Paris. Pierre only returned Marcie&#x27;s affections, however, a fact to which Peppermint Patty remained oblivious even when they were holding hands right in front of her.

Peppermint Patty has a strong friendship with Snoopy, treating him like one of the children even after being told that he is a dog.

== Family ==
Peppermint Patty&#x27;s mother is never seen or mentioned. In the strip of September 27, 1973, Peppermint Patty simply says she doesn&#x27;t have a mother. The fate of her mother is never revealed in the strip.

Peppermint Patty&#x27;s father often calls Patty &quot;a rare gem&quot;. In the cartoons his voice, like those of all adults, is heard as &quot;wah-wahs&quot; (made by musician Dean Hubbard).

<text>Taumarunui is a small town in the King Country of the central North Island of New Zealand. It is on an alluvial plain set within rugged terrain on the upper reaches of the Whanganui River, 65 km south of Te Kūiti and 55 km west of Tūrangi. It is under the jurisdiction of Ruapehu District and Manawatū-Whanganui region.

It has a population of as of and is the largest centre for a considerable distance in any direction. It is on State Highway 4 and the North Island Main Trunk railway.

==Name==
The name &quot;Taumarunui&quot; is reported to be the dying words of the Māori chief Pehi Turoa – &quot;taumaru&quot; meaning screen and &quot;nui&quot; big, literally translated as Big Screen, being built to shelter him from the sun, or more commonly known to mean – &quot;The place of big shelter&quot;. There are also references to Taumarunui being known as a large sheltered location for growing kūmara.

In the 1980s publication &quot;Roll Back the Years&quot; there are some details on how Taumarunui got its name. Extract: &quot;According to Frank T Brown, who wrote in the &quot;Taumarunui Press&quot; in 1926, the name Taumarunui is closely connected with the arrival of and conquering of that portion of the King Country by the Whanganui River natives during the 18th century . . . The war party that succeeded in capturing the principal pa and taking prisoner the chief of the district was headed by &quot;Ki Maru&quot;. His warriors, to show their appreciation of his prowess and the honour of the victory, acclaimed him &quot;Tau-maru-nui&quot;, which means &quot;Maru the Great&quot;, or &quot;Maru the Conqueror&quot;, that name was taken for the district and has been used ever since.&quot;

== Locality ==
On State Highway 4 south of Taumarunui are the villages of Manunui, Piriaka, Kakahi, Ōwhango, Raurimu and then National Park. To the north are the school and truck stop of Māpiu.

==History and culture==
Taumarunui was originally a Māori settlement at the confluence of the Ongarue River with the Whanganui, important canoe routes linking the interior of the island with the lower Whanganui River settlements. Some places, notably the valley of the Pungapunga Stream, which joins the upper Whanganui near Manunui, were celebrated for the size and quality of totara, and large canoes were built there. The area is a border area between a number of iwi including Whanganui, Ngāti Maniapoto and Ngāti Tūwharetoa, who lived together in relative harmony.

Late in December 1843 Bishop Selwyn travelled from the district south of Taupō to a point on the Whanganui River about six miles downstream from Taumarunui and thence continued his journey to the coast by canoe. Towards the end of 1869 Te Kooti was at Taumarunui before his march through the western Taupō district to Tapapa. In the early 1880s the first surveys of the King Country commenced, and by the early 1890s the Crown had begun the purchase of large areas of land.

In 1874, Alexander Bell set up a trading post, and became the first European settler. The town has a road called Bell Road.

During the New Zealand Wars a resident named William Moffatt manufactured and supplied Māori with a coarse kind of gunpowder. He was afterwards expelled from the district. Despite warnings, he returned in 1880, ostensibly to prospect for gold, and was executed.

The Whanganui River long continued to be the principal route serving Taumarunui. Traffic was at first by Māori canoe, but by the late 1880s regular steamship communication was established. Taumarunui Landing (Image) was the last stop on Alexander Hatrick&#x27;s steam boat service from Wanganui. The river vessels maintained the services between Wanganui and Taumarunui until the late 1920s, when the condition of the river deteriorated.

Later, Taumarunui gained importance with the completion of the North Island Main Trunk line in 1908–09 (celebrated in the 1957 ballad &quot;Taumarunui on the Main Trunk Line&quot; by Peter Cape, about the station refreshment room). The line south of Taumarunui caused considerable problems due to the terrain, and has several high viaducts and the famous Raurimu Spiral. The Stratford–Okahukura Line to Stratford connected just north of Taumarunui. In more recent times, the town&#x27;s economy has been based on forestry and farming. It has gained in importance as a tourism centre, especially as an entry point for voyagers down the scenic Wanganui River and as the possessor of a high-quality golf course.

<text>Eugene Alfred Forsey (May 29, 1904 – February 20, 1991) served in the Senate of Canada from 1970 to 1979. He was considered to be one of Canada&#x27;s foremost constitutional experts.

==Biography==
Forsey was born on May 29, 1904, in Grand Bank in the Newfoundland Colony. He attended McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.

Forsey was a supporter of the Conservative Party led by Arthur Meighen until he went to Balliol College, Oxford, on a Rhodes Scholarship during which he was converted to democratic socialism. Upon returning to Canada, he joined the League for Social Reconstruction, and was a delegate at the founding convention of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1933 in Regina.

In 1924 Forsey was employed by Vincent Massey as a tutor for the two Massey boys at their Batterwood home near Canton, Ontario. This was an old farmhouse and property that the Masseys had bought in 1918 on rising land backed by rolling hills and facing Lake Ontario a few miles to the south.
Forsey was free to enjoy Massey&#x27;s extensive library, and also socialized with the many visitors. These included academics from the University of Toronto and politicians such as the son of Ramsay MacDonald, the British Prime Minister.
Massey at this time was about to enter public life, although his more immediate concern was the health of the family business.

From 1929 to 1941, Forsey served as a lecturer in economics and political science at McGill University. He later taught Canadian government at Carleton University in Ottawa and Canadian government and Canadian labour history at the University of Waterloo. From 1973 to 1977, he served as chancellor of Trent University.

While he had become a social progressive, he remained a &quot;Constitutional conservative&quot;, and wrote his PhD thesis on the King–Byng Affair, defending the positions of Arthur Meighen and Governor-General Lord Byng of Vimy. The thesis was published in 1943 as &quot;The Royal Power of Dissolution of Parliament&quot;. This was one of very few major works on the reserve powers of the Crown in Commonwealth of Nations countries.

Forsey was president of the CCF in Quebec in the 1930s. He spent a number of years working for the CCF, and then as research director for the Canadian Congress of Labour and its successor, the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC). He was a candidate for the party in the Ottawa area riding of Carleton in a 1948 by-election, but lost to the new Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leader George Drew. When asked why he lost he famously quipped that it was because the other candidate received more votes. He ran and lost again in the 1949 election.

In 1958, Forsey, though still a CCF member, was appointed by the Progressive Conservative government of John Diefenbaker to the Board of Broadcast Governors, the predecessor of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. He remained in that position until he resigned in 1962 because of policy differences.

Shortly after the formation of the New Democratic Party from the alliance of the CLC with the CCF, Forsey resigned from the party because of its constitutional policy which viewed Quebec as a nation within Canada. Later in the 1960s, he was attracted to the views of Pierre Trudeau on the Canadian constitution, and joined the Liberal Party of Canada upon being appointed to the Senate in 1970. He retired from the upper house on reaching the age of 75 in 1979, and turned down an offer from the Liberals to run for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. He opposed the emergence of Quebec nationalism. Québecor leaders objected that the word &quot;dominion&quot; indicated that Ottawa would have control over Quebec. Under Prime Minister Louis St-Laurent, compromises were reached that quietly, and without legislation, &quot;dominion&quot; was retired in official government names, titles and statements, usually replaced by &quot;federal&quot;. Dominion Day remained until in May 1980 when a private member&#x27;s bill to replace the name with Canada Day was unexpectedly passed in the House. In the Senate, Forsey and the Monarchist League of Canada strongly defended the traditional usage. When a Gallup poll showed 70 percent of all Canadians favoured the change, the Senate approved the bill without a recorded vote. He subsequently resigned from the Liberal Party in 1982 due to disagreements with the proposed changes to the Constitution of Canada.

In 1968, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1988. He was appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on June 10, 1985.

In his many commentaries on constitutional issues, especially the reserve powers of the Crown, Forsey was a conspicuous supporter of the action of the Governor-General of Australia, Sir John Kerr, in dismissing the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, in the 1975 constitutional crisis because his government was unable to obtain supply (approval to spend money) from the parliament and refused to call a general election.

In retirement Forsey published a study of the labour movement in 1982, &quot;Trade Unions in Canada, 1812–1902&quot;. His publication &quot;How Canadians Govern Themselves&quot; is perhaps his most enduring legacy, being a simple yet comprehensive guide to Canadian government that is continuously edited and published with posthumous credit.

Forsey&#x27;s daughter, Helen Forsey, was a candidate for the New Democratic Party in the 2006 federal election in the riding of Lanark—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington.

<text>A buccellato () is a Sicilian circular cake made from pastry dough filled with figs and nuts. In Sicily, it is traditionally associated with Christmas.

It is not to be confused with the distinct but similar traditional Lucchese cake of the same name, the &quot;buccellato di Lucca&quot;, although both are ring-shaped sweet breads that contain candied fruit peels.

<text>Arrowtown () is a historic gold mining town in the Otago region of the South Island of New Zealand. Arrowtown is located on the banks of the Arrow River (Māori: &quot;Haehaenui&quot;) approximately 7.5 km from State Highway 6. Arrowtown is located 19.5 kilometres to the east of Queenstown. As well as the route via State Highway 6 at Arrow Junction, there is also road access directly to Queenstown via Arthurs Point and a third route via the picturesque Lake Hayes.

There are many well preserved buildings that were used by the European and Chinese immigrants who settled during the town&#x27;s gold mining era.

==History==
In August 1862 Jack Tewa (known as Maori Jack) found gold in the Arrow River, and a township of 1,000 miners soon sprang up. It was initially named Fox&#x27;s, based on William Fox&#x27;s claim to have been first to find gold there, but was soon renamed Arrowtown. Chinese settlers, who first arrived in the 1870s in Arrowtown were forced to live in huts on the banks of Bush Creek. At the high point of the gold rush, the population of Arrowtown rose to over 7,000 and it became the centre of a larger municipality, which covered the new settlements of Macetown, Skippers Canyon and Bullendale (today only ghost towns).

Arrowtown was constituted as a borough in 1867 In 1874, the first mayor was elected. This was Samuel Goldston. A large fire burned down Campbell&#x27;s bakery, the Morning Star Hotel and a significant portion of Pritchard&#x27;s Store in 1896.

In 1888, the name of Arrowtown had yet to be finalised with the local post office calling the town Arrow River, while the telegraph office referring to the town as Arrowtown.

The last time this level had been reached was 2007. Arrowtown, along with Alexandra recorded the highest levels of air pollution in Otago. A combination of domestic wood burning heaters and the geography of the Arrowtown region causing temperature inversions was thought to be the problem. The issue was still present in 2019 with Arrowtown being labelled as having some of the worst air pollution in Australasia.

NIWA deployed initially 22 sensors (which increased to a total of 48 sensors) in Arrowtown in 2019 to investigate the issue. They found that the air quality in the early afternoon was excellent at all locations. Poor air quality was linked to cold winter nights with a smaller impact on the following mornings. Air quality was better in the north-west of the town and worst in the south east of the town. The air quality was consistent with the usage of where in the town that domestic wood burning heaters were being used. The Otago Regional Council has been working with homeowners to replace their domestic wood burning heaters with cleaner heating devices such as heat pumps and improving insulation in homes.

Arrowtown had 23 high pollution nights, where PM10 particulate levels exceeded the national environmental standards in winter 2021. This decreased in winter 2022 to a total of 10 nights.

<doc id="637827" wikidata="Q149007" url="?curid=637827" title="2436 Hatshepsut">
<text>2436 Hatshepsut , provisional designation , is a Hygiean asteroid from the outer asteroid belt, approximately 19 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Cornelis van Houten, Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld and Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory on 24 September 1960. It was named for pharaoh Hatshepsut.

== Orbit and characterization ==

&quot;Hatshepsut&quot; is a member of the Hygiea family (), a very large family of carbonaceous outer-belt asteroids, named after the fourth-largest asteroid, 10 Hygiea. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.9–3.5 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,072 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. Its orbit is only slightly eccentric and not much inclined to the ecliptic. The asteroid rotates around its axis every 9 hours.

== Survey designation ==

The survey designation &quot;P-L&quot; stands for &quot;Palomar–Leiden&quot;, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar&#x27;s Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand asteroid discoveries.

== Naming ==

This minor planet named after the only female pharaoh to reign over ancient Egypt, Hatshepsut. The approved naming citation was published on 22 September 1983 ().

<doc id="637842" wikidata="Q16335" url="?curid=637842" title="Ge (Cyrillic)">
<text>Ge, ghe, or he (Г г; italics: &quot;Г&quot; &quot;г&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. Most commonly, it represents the voiced velar plosive , like in &quot;gift&quot;, or the voiced glottal fricative , like in &quot;heft&quot;. It is generally romanized using the Latin letter &quot;g&quot; or &quot;h&quot;, depending on the source language.

==History==
The Cyrillic letter ge was derived directly from the Greek letter Gamma (Γ) in uncial script.

In the Early Cyrillic alphabet, its name was (&quot;glagol&#x27; &quot;), meaning &quot;speak&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, it had a numerical value of 3.

==Usage in Slavic languages==
===Belarusian, Rusyn, and Ukrainian===
From these three languages, the letter is romanized with &quot;h&quot;. Its name is &quot;he&quot; in Belarusian and Ukrainian, and &quot;hy&quot; in Rusyn.

In Belarusian (like in Southern Russian), the letter corresponds to the velar fricative and its soft counterpart .

In Ukrainian and Rusyn, it represents a voiced glottal fricative , a breathy voiced counterpart of the English .

In Ukrainian and Rusyn, a voiced velar plosive is written with the Cyrillic letter ghe with upturn (Ґ ґ). In Belarusian, the official orthography uses г for both and (which is rare), although in Taraškievica ghe with upturn is optionally used for . Ґ is transliterated with G.

In all three languages&#x27; historical ancestor Ruthenian, the sound was also represented by the digraph кг.

===Russian===
In standard Russian, ghe represents the voiced velar plosive but is devoiced to word-finally or before a voiceless consonant. It represents before a palatalizing vowel. In the Southern Russian dialect, the sound becomes the velar fricative . Sometimes, the sound is the glottal fricative in the regions bordering Belarus and Ukraine.

It is acceptable, for some people, to pronounce certain Russian words with (sometimes referred to as &quot;Ukrainian Ge&quot;): (&quot;Bog, bogatyj, blago, Gospod’&quot;). The sound is normally considered nonstandard or dialectal in Russian and is avoided by educated Russian speakers. (&quot;Bog&quot;, &quot;God&quot;) is always pronounced in the nominative case.

In the Russian nominal genitive ending , ghe represents , including in the word (&quot;today&quot;, from ).

It represents a voiceless (not ) in front of ka in two Russian words, namely, and , and their derivatives.

The Latin letter &quot;h&quot; of words of Latin, Greek, English or German origin is usually transliterated into Russian with ghe rather than kha: hero&quot; → , hamburger&quot; → , Haydn → . That can occasionally cause ambiguity, as for example English &quot;Harry&quot; and &quot;Gary&quot;/&quot;Garry&quot; would be spelled the same in Russian, e.g. Гарри Поттер). The reasons for using ghe to write &quot;h&quot; include the fact that ghe is used for &quot;h&quot; in Ukrainian, Belarusian and some Russian dialects, along with the perception that kha sounds too harsh. Nevertheless, in newer loanwords (especially from English), kha is often used. 

=== South Slavic ===
In standard Serbian, Bosnian, Montenegrin, Bulgarian and Macedonian the letter ghe represents a voiced velar plosive . But in Bulgarian and Macedonian it is devoiced to word-finally or before a voiceless consonant.

== Usage in non-Slavic languages ==
In many non-Slavic languages it can represent both and (the latter mostly in Turkic and some Finno-Ugric languages).

In Ossetian, an Indo-Iranian language spoken in the Caucasus, ⟨г⟩ represents the voiced velar stop . However, the digraph ⟨гъ⟩ represents the voiced uvular fricative .

==Related letters and other similar characters==

*H h: Latin letter H, romanized as in Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Rusyn

==Computing codes==
==Cultural references==
In Russian Empire the name of the letter, &quot;glagol&#x27; &quot; was an informal reference to the Γ-shaped gallows:
:Кругом пустыня, дичь и голь,
:А в стороне торчит глаголь, 
:И на глаголе том два тела
:Висят. Закаркав, отлетела
:Ватага чёрная ворон...
:[All around there is desert, wilderness and bareness... And a &quot;glagol&#x27; &quot; sticks out on the side, And on that &quot;glagol&#x27; &quot; two bodies hang. The gang of black crows croaked and flew off..]
::Alexander Pushkin, 1836

<doc id="637845" wikidata="Q963218" url="?curid=637845" title="Trekboers">
<text>The Trekboers ( ) were nomadic pastoralists descended from European colonists on the frontiers of the Dutch Cape Colony in Southern Africa. The Trekboers began migrating into the interior from the areas surrounding what is now Cape Town, such as Paarl (settled from 1688), Stellenbosch (founded in 1679), and Franschhoek (settled from 1688), during the late 17th century and throughout the 18th century. 

==Origins==
The Trekboers were seminomadic pastoralists, subsistence farmers who began trekking both northwards and eastwards into the interior to find better pastures/farmlands for their livestock to graze, as well as to escape the autocratic rule of the Dutch East India Company (or VOC), which administered the Cape. They believed the VOC was tainted with corruption and not concerned with the interests of the free burghers, the social class of most of the Trekboers.

Trekboers also traded with indigenous people. This meant their herds were of hardy local stock. They formed a vital link between the pool of animals in the interior and the providers of shipping provisions at the Cape. Trekboere were nomadic, living in their wagons and rarely remaining in one location for an extended period of time. A number of Trekboers settled in the eastern Cape, where their descendants became known as &quot;Grensboere&quot; (Border Farmers).

==Expansion==

Despite the VOC&#x27;s attempts to prevent settler expansion beyond the western Cape, the frontier of the Colony remained open: the authorities in Cape Town lacked the means to police the Colony&#x27;s borders. 
By the 1740s the Trekboers had entered the Little Karoo. By the 1760s they reached the deep interior of the Great Karoo.

==Independent republics==
Due to the collapse of the VOC (which went bankrupt in 1800) and inspired by the French Revolution (1789) and the American Revolution, groups of Boers rebelled against VOC rule. They set up independent republics in the town of Graaff-Reinet (1795), and four months later, in Swellendam (17 June 1795). A few months later, the newly established Batavian Republic nationalised the VOC (1 March 1796); the Netherlands came under the sway of the new post-revolution French government.

The British, who captured Cape Town in September 1795 in the course of the French Revolutionary Wars and took over the administration of Cape Colony, increased the level of government oversight the Trekboers were subject to. Tensions between the Trekboers and the British colonial administration would culminate in the Slachter&#x27;s Nek Rebellion of 1815, which was rapidly suppressed and the leaders of the rebellion executed. Eventually, due to a combination of dissatisfaction with the British administration, constant frontier wars with the Xhosa to the east, and growing shortages of land, the Trekboers eventually went on the Great Trek.

==Legacy==
Numerous Trekboers settled down to become border farmers for a few generations and later voortrekkers. But many of the group continued well into the 19th century as an economic class of nomadic pastoralists.

Many Trekboers crossed the Orange River decades before the Voortrekkers did. Voortrekkers often encountered Trekboers in Transorangia during their Great Trek of the 1830s and 1840s. In 1815, a Trekboer/trader named Coenraad (Du) Buys (a surname of French Huguenot origin) was accused of cattle theft and fled from the British. He settled in the (western) Transvaal. He allegedly contracted polygamous marriages with hundreds of indigenous women, with his descendants&#x27; populating the town of Buysplaas in the Gourits River valley. He continued having numerous wives after leaving the colony. Descendants of his second series of marriages still live in the small town of Buysdorp, near the mission station of Mara, 20 km to the west of Louis Trichardt in the modern Limpopo province. Buys eventually disappeared while traveling along the Limpopo River.

By the late 17th century, both the Trekboers and the Voortrekkers were collectively called Boers.

==Language==
The Trekboers spoke a variety of Dutch which they called &quot;die taal&quot; (lit. &#x27;the language&#x27;), which evolved into the modern-day dialect Eastern Border Afrikaans, also known as East Cape Afrikaans. The Afrikaans language as a whole generally originated from 17th- and 18th-century Dutch dialects. Over time it incorporated numerous words and expressions from French, German, Portuguese, Malay, Khoi, and later also English. Still, roughly 90% of the vocabulary is of Dutch origin and it is closer linguistically to Standard Dutch than many Dutch dialects. If Afrikaans had not been defined a separate language during the 20th century, its various dialects would have been considered dialects of Dutch.

<text>California State University, Sacramento (CSUS, Sacramento State, or informally Sac State) is a public university in Sacramento, California. Founded in 1947 as Sacramento State College, it is part of the California State University system.

The university enrolls approximately 31,500 students annually, with 31,573 enrolled in the fall of 2021. It also has an alumni base of more than 250,000 and awards 9,000 degrees annually. The university offers 151 different bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 69 master&#x27;s degrees, 28 types of teaching credentials, and 5 doctoral degrees.

The campus sits on , covered with over 3,500 trees and over 1,200 resting in the University Arboretum. The university is home to one site of the National Register of Historic Places, the Julia Morgan House.

Sacramento State is federally recognized as both a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution (AANAPISI). The institution was also recognized by the California Legislative Assembly as the first Black-Serving Institution (BSI) in the state of California. The Arbor Day Foundation officially declared the university a &quot;Tree Campus USA&quot; in 2012.

==History==
===Early years===
The efforts to get a four-year university in Sacramento date back to the 1920s; however, legislation repeatedly failed. Local supporters blamed &quot;pork barrel politics&quot; by Bay Area legislators trying to monopolize higher education. Sacramento State was formally established in 1947 through legislation by State Senator Earl D. Desmond, by playing hardball to get it done – convincing the Senate&#x27;s finance committee to withhold funding for the University of California until he had a commitment. Later on, Desmond eventually had 11 children and grandchildren graduate from the college.

Founded as Sacramento State College on September 22, 1947, during a time of intense demand for higher education after World War II, Sacramento State shared space with Sacramento Junior College. Sacramento State&#x27;s first semester of classes consisted of 235 students enrolled in 44 sections. During December 1947, the official mascot &quot;Herky&quot; (short for Hercules) the Hornet was chosen over the Elk, which wasn&#x27;t considered to be aggressive enough. The college&#x27;s colors – green and gold symbolizing the foothills and trees, were also established. The next spring, the college held its first graduation ceremony. A single student, history major John J. Collins, who had transferred from UC Berkeley, graduated. By 1948, the college was already fielding intercollegiate teams in basketball, baseball, and tennis. In spring 1949, the winning &quot;Fight Hornet Fight&quot; song was composed by Donald McDonald. The State Hornet and Statesman yearbook were first published in 1949.

Several sites for a permanent home for the college were considered. A site at 5th Street and Broadway, a site near Fruitridge and Stockton Boulevard, and a site in the Pocket Area of South Sacramento were all rejected. In 1949, the state purchased 244 acres of what was then peach farm land to be the site of the new college at $1,650 to $1,800 an acre. In December 1952, the school left the Sacramento City College property and moved to its permanent location on the banks of the American River. On February 9, 1953, the then 289-acre campus opened to approximately 2,400 students with a parade through town called &quot;GO EAST WITH WEST&quot;, in reference to President West. Parking has notoriously been a problem at the university, and since the beginning, drivers were confronted by a sea of mud. Students would simply drive as close to the buildings as they could and park.

Construction began in 1951. By 1962, 30 new structures had been built and occupied. A campus landmark was created when the Guy West Bridge was erected – a bridge modeled after the Golden Gate Bridge and named after the college&#x27;s founding president.

In 1955, the first Hornet football team scored its first victory, against Southern Oregon College. Jackrabbits were a problem in the early years and landscapers were permitted to shoot them on sight through the 1960s. In 1972, the school became California State University, Sacramento. In 2004, it formally adopted Sacramento State as its primary name; it had been used in athletics for some time. Today, Sacramento State is the only major four-year comprehensive university in the city of Sacramento.

The university underwent a major expansion in the Korean War years, with the &#x27;heart&#x27; of the campus residing in Douglass Hall, Shasta Hall, Sacramento Hall (the administration building).

In 1975, the University Union opened its doors, originally comprising . In 1981, the Sacramento State Aquatic Center was established. The Center for California Studies was established the following year. In 1986, Sacramento State established a Master Plan that called for over $100 million in growth. During that same year, the university came within hours of being deliberately flooded as officials contemplated blowing floodgates to avoid a massive levee failure in Sacramento. The 1990s saw additional growth, constructing more than 1.2 million square-feet of space. In 1992, Hornet Stadium was renovated, providing capacity for 26,000 patrons.

In 2000 and 2004, the campus hosted the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials. In 2003, Dr. Alexander Gonzalez was appointed the 11th president of the university. In his first year, he launched Destination 2010, an initiative focusing on reforming academic programs and constructing new facilities.

In 2007, the faculty overwhelmingly (77% of ballots) approved a &quot;No Confidence&quot; vote for President Alexander Gonzalez. The vote expressed anger over the President&#x27;s handling of finances, including a $6.5 million structural deficit the university is facing. They also accused him of pumping money into student recruitment and promotion rather than academic affairs. In response to the vote Gonzalez publicly replied, &quot;in the 28 years I have been a part of the California State University...I have yet to encounter the level of incivility, mean-spiritedness and outright distortion that I have found among some members of the Sacramento State community. It embarrasses and saddens me.&quot;

Similarly in 2011, then Sacramento State Police Chief Daniel Davis also received a &quot;No Confidence&quot; vote by 14 out of 15 sworn in officers. The vote came amid seven alleged sexual assaults that occurred the prior fall semester. This was also the second time the police force voiced concerns about the police chief&#x27;s mismanagement.

===Today===
Sacramento State is organized into seven academic colleges and a college of continuing education. The university is also a member of the consortium that operates Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, offering curricula in marine sciences. In keeping with its proximity to a burgeoning electronics industry, the university is developing expanded applications of technology to learn through computerized and televised instruction over a wide area of Northern California.

The university reached an important strategic milestone. Sacramento State launched Destination 2010, an initiative focused on creating excellent academic programs, new student facilities and a more welcoming campus culture and environment. During that time, the campus constructed the four-story Academic Information Research Center, Parking Structure III (which at 3,000 spaces is the largest in the CSU system), the new Hornet Bookstore, Eli and Edythe Broad Athletic Fieldhouse, and the American River Courtyard residence hall (with 600 beds).

Many new buildings and other structural improvements are currently underway or recently completed including:

*The Ernest E. Tschannen Science Complex: The science complex opened in fall 2019. A state-of-the-art building complete with a 2,500-square-foot planetarium and open-roof observatory, it is available to students and the public.
*University Union expansion: A 72,500-square-foot expansion of the University Union was completed in 2019. The renovation accommodates the growing campus population, providing informal recreation space, student offices, campus group meeting rooms, special-event space, casual seating, and a new coffee shop.
*The WELL expansion: Slated for completion in January 2020, will add square footage and renovate current spaces in both the Campus Recreation and Student Health and Counseling areas. Highlights include expanded locker room capacity, additional strength group fitness studios, lounge and free weight fitness space.
*Riverview Hall: Opened in August 2017, the $53 million residence hall is home to 416 first- and second-year students. It was built to LEED Gold specifications.
*Parking Structure 5: $42 million. Parking for 1,750 vehicles. It is one of the first in the CSU.
*Hornet Commons Residence Hall: As part of an ongoing effort to provide more on-campus housing, this $164 million housing project for upper-division students boasts 284 apartments and 1,100 beds in a six four-story buildings surrounding a swimming pool and a resident&#x27;s common building. It was completed in fall 2021.

Many prominent people have lectured or performed at Sacramento State, including Martin Luther King Jr. (1967), Jimi Hendrix (1968), Genesis (1992, &quot;largest concert ever ... the first and last to play&quot; in Hornet Stadium), Sheryl Crow (1995), Jesse Jackson (1998), Woody Harrelson (2001), Oliver Stone (2006), John Kerry (2004), Wangari Maathai (2009), Maya Soetoro-Ng (2009) and Chuck D (2010).

===Doctoral degrees===
In 1999, Sacramento State was given authority to award its first ever Doctoral degree, unique at the time in the California State University System. In the past, authority to award any sort of degree beyond Master&#x27;s in California&#x27;s higher public education was given solely to the University of California. The program would be a joint PhD in history with the University of California, Santa Barbara. However, this program later phased out due to declining enrollment.

The university was given authority again to award its first ever Doctorate in Education (Ed.D.) degree in 2007, with its first graduating class in 2010. Since its establishment, the program has branched into several focuses offering different types of degrees.

In 2012, the university was accredited to award its first Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT), with the first class entering in fall of 2012. The program is highly competitive, with over 400 applications for just 32 seats. This program eventually will fade out the Master&#x27;s in Physical Therapy by 2015, following standards set by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education.

In 2019, the university added its most recent doctoral degree, a Doctor of Audiology (Au.D). Sacramento State is one of four CSUs to receive approval of the proposed doctorate of audiology degree along with San Jose, Northridge, and Los Angeles.

===Renaming===
In 2004, the university re-branded itself as Sacramento State, or Sac State for short, though students had been referring to the school as &quot;Sac State&quot; for years. The formal name is California State University, Sacramento. The university&#x27;s marketing unit discourages the use of CSUS, Cal State Sacramento, Sacramento State University, CSU Sacramento and CS Sacramento, even though the university&#x27;s web address is csus.edu. The university also adopted a new logo and seal that replaced the previous design based on the Seal of California. In addition, the exact shades of Sacramento State&#x27;s colors of green and gold were formalized in the 2005 Style Guide.

===University Union===
The CSUS student activity center is the University Union. The University Union is unique in that it is the original building that was first structured in 1972. It has gone under major renovations throughout the years, with the first phase in 1992 that added a large ballroom and space for food vendors and meeting rooms and other extensions. In 1998, the Union underwent another major renovation again, adding another 180,000 square feet for certain University Outlets such as KSSU and Peak Adventures (which have both since moved). In 2012, the Union yet again underwent major renovations, including adding the university operated restaurant Good Eats, new flooring and stage demolition in the Redwood Room, a complete remodel of Round Table Pizza, an addition of the much requested &quot;prayer room&quot; or &quot;quiet room&quot; on the second floor, a complete remodel of the Terminal Lounge on the second floor, and tearing down the University Center Restaurant and building the new Epicure Restaurant.

Much is offered, including a large fast food court, a game room, public computers with internet access, free WiFi, conference rooms, the university&#x27;s main auditoria, a prayer room, and many offices for student organizations including the Pride Center, the State Hornet (student paper), and others.

Sac State officials have announced an expansion of The University Union will begin in the first quarter of 2017. This expansion will add 71,000 square feet of space consisting of &quot;a storefront for Peak Adventures (currently located at The WELL), a premium Starbucks venue, meeting and conference spaces for student groups and other organizations, additional restrooms, a study lounge, food-service storage, expanded casual seating, and an outdoor seating/pavilion area&quot; according to the school website. Due to lack of space and overcrowding over the years, students have requested expanding the University Union. This expansion was funded with student fees, the Union WELL Inc., and generated fees; it completed in August 2018.

==Student clubs and organizations==
Sacramento State has a wide selection of social and academic clubs and organizations. Each are dedicated to help students of similar interests bond together by common goals and aspirations. They make up a wide range of opportunities to be involved. They often represent national, international, local and regional organizations. Some also promote certain cultures or multiculturalism as well as political and recreational. Clubs and organizations are overseen by Student Organizations &amp; Leadership. In fall 2012, approximately 7% of undergraduate men (or 774 students) were part of fraternities while 5% of undergraduate women (or 725 students) were part of sororities for a total of about 1,500 Greeks (the largest class to date).

In 2014, the CSU removed recognition from certain religious organizations that had policy conflicts with a state-mandated nondiscrimination policy. The new policy stated that religious clubs must allow any student eligibility to participate as a student leader regardless of beliefs. Both CRU and Intervarsity, as of fall 2015, came to an agreement with the Chancellor that allowed them to return to campus, while allowing them to maintain their religious beliefs.

==Transportation==
University Transportation and Parking Services (UTAPS), an auxiliary of Sacramento State, operates its own buses known as the Hornet Shuttle, providing several lines around the campus running approximately 7:30 am until 5:00 pm in conjunction with Sacramento Regional Transit District. The Hornet Line serves the south end of the university, university/65th Light-Rail Station, and newly added Folsom Hall, the Green Line serves the College Town/La Riviera District and the east end of Campus, while the Gold Line runs all the way to the Fair Oaks district and the Arden Fair Mall. UTAPS also runs night shuttle for students, providing point-to-point service from dusk to 11:00 pm.

The university has a bus terminal station at the north end of campus, which serves as a major stop for Sacramento Regional Transit. RT provides bus services to downtown (Route 30), Midtown/Sutter District (Route 34), American River College/Watt (Route 82), Marconi/Arcade Light-Rail Station (Route 87), seven days a week departing approximately every 10 minutes. The university is located about 1/2-mile from University/65th Street station on the SacRT light rail system, just south of the campus.

Sacramento State students can use these resources, including LRT, for free with their student One Card.

The university also has multiple Zipcars housed on campus for students, faculty and staff to use 24-hours a day, part of the ZipCarU program.

Plans have been in the works for the university to operate its own streetcar bus rapid transit (BRT) system, looping around the perimeter of the campus and back to University/65th Street station. However this has been set back due to budget constraints. The Sacramento light rail system was originally proposed to run through the library quad, but then-president Donald Gerth vetoed the proposal over concerns for student safety.

The school is situated just north of US 50 and is accessible by two exits – 65th St. and Howe Avenue.

==Notable people==
The university has conferred over 250,000 degrees since its establishment. CSUS alumni live over all 50 states of the U.S., with over 165,000 residing in California, nearly 3,000 in Washington, 2,500 in Oregon and over 2,000 in Texas.

<text>Delta Arietis (δ Arietis, abbreviated Delta Ari, δ Ari), officially named Botein , is a star in the northern constellation of Aries, 1.8 degrees north of the ecliptic. The apparent visual magnitude is 4.35, so it is visible to the naked eye. It has an annual parallax shift of 19.22 mas; corresponding to a distance of about from the Sun.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;δ Arietis&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Delta Arietis&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

It bore the traditional name &quot;Botein&quot; which is derived from Al Bīrūnī&#x27;s &quot;Al Buṭayn&quot; (Arabic: البُطَين), the diminutive of &quot;Al Baṭn&quot;, &quot;the Belly&quot;. This is the name of a star association consisting of this star, Epsilon Arietis, Zeta Arietis, Pi Arietis, and Rho3 Arietis According to a 1971 NASA catalogue of stars, &quot;Al Buṭain&quot; was the title for five stars: Delta Arietis (listed as &quot;Botein&quot;), Pi Arietis (as &quot;Al Buṭain I&quot;), Rho3 Arietis (&quot;Al Buṭain II&quot;), Epsilon Arietis (&quot;Al Buṭain III&quot;) and Zeta Arietis (&quot;Al Buṭain IV&quot;). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Botein&quot; for this star on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

In the catalogue of stars in the &quot;Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket&quot;, this star was designated &quot;Nir al Botain&quot;, which was translated into Latin as &quot;Lucida Ventris&quot;, meaning &quot;the brightest of the belly&quot;.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Yin Force&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Delta Arietis, 63 Arietis, Zeta Arietis, Tau Arietis and 65 Arietis. Consequently, the Chinese name for Delta Arietis itself is (, .)

==Properties==
Delta Arietis is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of K2 III. It belongs to a population known as red clump giants, which means it is generating energy through the fusion of helium at its core. With close to twice the mass of the Sun, the outer envelope has expanded until it is around ten times the Sun&#x27;s radius. It shines with 45 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity at an effective temperature of 4,810 K, giving it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star. It is a suspected variable star that ranges in magnitude from 4.33 to 4.37.

<text>In human anatomy, the mesentery is an organ that attaches the intestines to the posterior abdominal wall, consisting of a double fold of the peritoneum. It helps (among other functions) in storing fat and allowing blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves to supply the intestines.

The  (the part of the mesentery that attaches the colon to the abdominal wall) was formerly thought to be a fragmented structure, with all named parts—the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid mesocolons, the mesoappendix, and the mesorectum—separately terminating their insertion into the posterior abdominal wall. However, in 2012, new microscopic and electron microscopic examinations showed the mesocolon to be a single structure derived from the duodenojejunal flexure and extending to the distal mesorectal layer. Thus the mesentery is an internal organ.

==Structure==
The mesentery of the small intestine arises from the root of the mesentery (or mesenteric root) and is the part connected with the structures in front of the vertebral column. The root is narrow, about 15 cm long, 20 cm in width, and is directed obliquely from the duodenojejunal flexure at the left side of the second lumbar vertebra to the right sacroiliac joint. The root of the mesentery extends from the duodenojejunal flexure to the ileocaecal junction. This section of the small intestine is located centrally in the abdominal cavity and lies behind the transverse colon and the greater omentum.

The mesentery becomes attached to the colon at the gastrointestinal margin and continues as the several regions of the mesocolon. The parts of the mesocolon take their names from the part of the colon to which they attach. These are the transverse mesocolon attaching to the transverse colon, the sigmoid mesocolon attaching to the sigmoid colon, the mesoappendix attaching to the appendix, and the mesorectum attaching to the upper third of the rectum.

The mesocolon regions were traditionally taught to be separate sections with separate insertions into the posterior abdominal wall. In 2012, the first detailed observational and histological studies of the mesocolon were undertaken and this revealed several new findings. The study included 109 patients undergoing open, elective, total abdominal colectomy. Anatomical observations were recorded during the surgery and on the post-operative specimens.

These studies showed that the mesocolon is continuous from the ileocaecal to the rectosigmoid level. It was also shown that a mesenteric confluence occurs at the ileocaecal and rectosigmoid junctions, as well as at the hepatic and splenic flexures and that each confluence involves peritoneal and omental attachments. The proximal rectum was shown to originate at the confluence of the mesorectum and mesosigmoid. A plane occupied by perinephric fascia was shown to separate the entire apposed small intestinal mesentery and the mesocolon from the retroperitoneum. Deep in the pelvis, this fascia coalesces to give rise to presacral fascia.

=== Flexural anatomy ===
Flexural anatomy is frequently described as a difficult area. It is simplified when each flexure is considered as being centered on a mesenteric contiguity. The ileocaecal flexure arises at the point where the ileum is continuous with the caecum around the ileocaecal mesenteric flexure. Similarly, the hepatic flexure is formed between the right mesocolon and transverse mesocolon at the mesenteric confluence. The colonic component of the hepatic flexure is draped around this mesenteric confluence. Furthermore, the splenic flexure is formed by the mesenteric confluence between the transverse and left mesocolon. The colonic component of the splenic flexure occurs lateral to the mesenteric confluence. At every flexure, a continuous peritoneal fold lies outside the colonic/mesocolic complex tethering this to the posterior abdominal wall.

===Mesocolon regions===
The transverse mesocolon is that section of the mesentery attached to the transverse colon that lies between the colic flexures.

The sigmoid mesocolon is that region of the mesentery to which the sigmoid colon is attached at the gastrointestinal mesenteric margin.

The mesoappendix is the portion of the mesentery connecting the ileum to the appendix. It may extend to the tip of the appendix. It encloses the appendicular artery and vein, as well as lymphatic vessels, nerves, and often a lymph node.

The mesorectum is that part attached to the upper third of the rectum.

=== Peritoneal folds ===
Understanding the macroscopic structure of the mesenteric organ meant that associated structures—the peritoneal folds and congenital and omental adhesions—could be better appraised. The small intestinal mesenteric fold occurs where the small intestinal mesentery folds onto the posterior abdominal wall and continues laterally as the right mesocolon. During mobilization of the small intestinal mesentery from the posterior abdominal wall, this fold is incised, allowing access to the interface between the small intestinal mesentery and the retroperitoneum. The fold continues at the inferolateral boundary of the ileocaecal junction and turn as the right paracolic peritoneal fold. This fold is divided during lateral to medial mobilization, permitting the surgeon to serially lift the right colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and retroperitoneum. At the hepatic flexure, the right lateral peritoneal fold turns and continues medially as the hepatocolic peritoneal fold. Division of the fold in this location permits separation of the colonic component of the hepatic flexure and mesocolon off the retroperitoneum.

Interposed between the hepatic and splenic flexures, the greater omentum adheres to the transverse colon along a further band or fold of peritoneum. Dissection through this allows access to the cephalad (top) surface of the transverse mesocolon. Focal adhesions frequently tether the greater omentum to the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. The left colon is associated with a similar anatomic configuration of peritoneal folds; the splenic peritoneal fold is contiguous with the left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold at the splenic flexure. Division of the latter similarly allows for the separation of the left colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and frees it from the retroperitoneum. The left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold continues distally at the lateral aspect of the mobile component of the mesosigmoid.

=== Microanatomy ===
Determination of the macroscopic structure of the mesenteric organ allowed a recent characterisation of the histological and electron microscopic properties. The microscopic structure of the mesocolon and associated fascia is consistent from ileocecal to mesorectal levels. A surface mesothelium and underlying connective tissue is universally apparent. Adipocytes lobules within the body of the mesocolon are separated by fibrous septa arising from submesothelial connective tissue. Where apposed to the retroperitoneum, two mesothelial layers separate the mesocolon and underlying retroperitoneum. Between these is Toldt&#x27;s fascia, a discrete layer of connective tissue. Lymphatic channels are evident in mesocolic connective tissue and in Toldt&#x27;s fascia.

===Development===
====Dorsal mesentery====

The primitive gut is suspended from the posterior abdominal wall by the dorsal mesentery. The gastrointestinal tract and associated dorsal mesentery are subdivided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut regions based on the respective blood supply. The foregut is supplied by the celiac trunk, the midgut is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and the hindgut is supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). This division is established by the fourth week of development. After this, the midgut undergoes a period of rapid elongation, forcing it to herniate through the navel. During herniation, the midgut rotates 90° anti-clockwise around the axis of the SMA and forms the midgut loop. The cranial portion of the loop moves to the right and the caudal portion of the loop moves toward the left. This rotation occurs at about the eighth week of development. The cranial portion of the loop will develop into the jejunum and most of the ileum, while the caudal part of the loop eventually forms the terminal portion of the ileum, the ascending colon and the initial two-thirds of the transverse colon. As the foetus grows larger, the mid-gut loop is drawn back through the umbilicus and undergoes a further 180° rotation, completing a total of 270° rotation. At this point, about 10 weeks, the caecum lies close to the liver. From here it moves in a cranial to caudal direction to eventually lie in the lower right portion of the abdominal cavity. This process brings the ascending colon to lie vertically in the lateral right portion of the abdominal cavity apposed to the posterior abdominal wall. The descending colon occupies a similar position on the left side.

During these topographic changes, the dorsal mesentery undergoes corresponding changes. Most anatomical and embryological textbooks say that after adopting a final position, the ascending and descending mesocolons disappear during embryogenesis. &quot;Embryology—An Illustrated Colour Text&quot;, &quot;most of the mid-gut retains the original dorsal mesentery, though parts of the duodenum derived from the mid-gut do not. The mesentery associated with the ascending colon and descending colon is resorbed, bringing these parts of the colon into close contact with the body wall.&quot; In &quot;The Developing Human&quot;, the author states, &quot;the mesentery of the ascending colon fuses with the parietal peritoneum on this wall and disappears; consequently the ascending colon also becomes retroperitoneal&quot;. To reconcile these differences, several theories of embryologic mesenteric development—including the &quot;regression&quot; and &quot;sliding&quot; theories—have been proposed, but none has been widely accepted.

The portion of the dorsal mesentery that attaches to the greater curvature of the stomach, is known as the dorsal mesogastrium. The part of the dorsal mesentery that suspends the colon is termed the mesocolon. The dorsal mesogastrium develops into the greater omentum.

====Ventral mesentery====
The development of the septum transversum takes part in the formation of the diaphragm, while the caudal portion into which the liver grows forms the ventral mesentery. The part of the ventral mesentery that attaches to the stomach is known as the ventral mesogastrium.

The lesser omentum is formed, by a thinning of the mesoderm or ventral mesogastrium, which attaches the stomach and duodenum to the anterior abdominal wall. By the subsequent growth of the liver, this leaf of mesoderm is divided into two parts – the lesser omentum between the stomach and liver, and the falciform and coronary ligaments between the liver and the abdominal wall and diaphragm.

In the adult, the ventral mesentery is the part of the peritoneum closest to the navel.

==Clinical significance==
Clarifications of the mesenteric anatomy have facilitated a clearer understanding of diseases involving the mesentery, examples of which include malrotation and Crohn&#x27;s disease (CD). In CD, the mesentery is frequently thickened, rendering hemostasis challenging. In addition, fat wrapping—creeping fat—involves extension of mesenteric fat over the circumference of contiguous gastrointestinal tract, and this may indicate increased mesothelial plasticity. The relationship between mesenteric derangements and mucosal manifestations in CD points to a pathobiological overlap; some authors say that CD is mainly a mesenteric disorder that secondarily affects the GIT and systemic circulation.

Thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein can cause mesenteric ischemia also known as &quot;ischemic bowel&quot;. Mesenteric ischemia can also result from the formation of a volvulus, a twisted loop of the small intestine that when it wraps around itself and also encloses the mesentery too tightly can cause ischemia.

The rationalization of mesenteric and peritoneal fold anatomy permits the surgeon to differentiate both from intraperitoneal adhesions—also called congenital adhesions. These are highly variable among patients and occur in several locations. Congenital adhesions occur between the lateral aspect of the peritoneum overlying the mobile component of the mesosigmoid and the parietal peritoneum in the left iliac fossa. During the lateral to the medial approach of mobilizing of the mesosigmoid, these must be divided first before the peritoneum proper can be accessed. Similarly, focal adhesions occur between the undersurface of the greater omentum and the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. These can be accessed after dividing the peritoneal fold that links the greater omentum and transverse colon. Adhesions here must be divided to separate the greater omentum off the transverse mesocolon, thus allowing access to the lesser sac proper.

=== Surgery ===
While the total mesorectal excision (TME) operation has become the surgical gold standard for the management of rectal cancer, this is not so for colon cancer.
Recently, the surgical principles underpinning TME in rectal cancer have been extrapolated to colonic surgery. Total or complete mesocolic excision (CME), use planar surgery and extensive mesenterectomy (high tie) to minimise breach of the mesentery and maximise lymph nodes yield. Application of this T/CME reduces local five-year recurrence rates in colon cancer from 6.5% to 3.6%, while cancer-related five-year survival rates in patients resected for cure increased from 82.1% to 89.1%.

=== Radiology ===
Recent radiologic appraisals of the mesenteric organ have been conducted in the context of the contemporary understanding of mesenteric organ anatomy. When this organ is divided into non-flexural and flexural regions, these can readily be differentiated in most patients on CT imaging. Clarification of the radiological appearance of the human mesentery resonates with the suggestions of Dodds and enables a clearer conceptualization of mesenteric derangements in disease states. This is of immediate relevance in the spread of cancer from colon cancer and perforated diverticular disease, and in pancreatitis where fluid collections in the lesser sac dissect the mesocolon from the retroperitoneum and thereby extend distally within the latter.

== History ==
Mesentery has been known for thousands of years, however it was unclear whether mesentery is a single organ or there are several mesenteries. The classical anatomical description of the mesocolon is credited to British surgeon Sir Frederick Treves in 1885, although a description of the membrane as a single structure dates back to at least Leonardo da Vinci. Treves is known for performing the first appendectomy in England in 1888; he was surgeon to both Queen Victoria and King Edward VII. He studied the human mesentery and peritoneal folds in 100 cadavers and described the right and left mesocolons as vestigial or absent in the human adult. Accordingly, the small intestinal mesentery, transverse, and sigmoid mesocolons all terminated or attached at their insertions into the posterior abdominal wall. These assertions were included in mainstream surgical, anatomical, embryological, and radiologic literature for more than a century.

Almost 10 years before Treves, the Austrian anatomist Carl Toldt described the persistence of all portions of the mesocolon into adulthood. Toldt was professor of anatomy in Prague and Vienna; he published his account of the human mesentery in 1879. Toldt identified a fascial plane between the mesocolon and the underlying retroperitoneum, formed by the fusion of the visceral peritoneum of the mesocolon with the parietal peritoneum of the retroperitoneum; this later became known as Toldt&#x27;s fascia.

In 1942, anatomist Edward Congdon also demonstrated that the
right and left mesocolons persisted into adulthood and remained separate from the retroperitoneum—extraretroperitoneal. Radiologist Wylie J. Dodds described this concept in 1986. Dodds extrapolated that unless the mesocolon remained an extraretroperitoneal structure—separate from the retroperitoneum—only then would the radiologic appearance of the mesentery and peritoneal folds be reconciled with actual anatomy.

Descriptions of the mesocolon by Toldt, Congdon, and Dodds have largely been ignored in mainstream literature until recently. A formal appraisal of the mesenteric organ anatomy was conducted in 2012; it echoed the findings of Toldt, Congdon, and Dodds. The single greatest advance in this regard was the identification of the mesenteric organ as being contiguous, as it spans the gastrointestinal tract from duodenojejunal flexure to mesorectal level.

In 2012 it was discovered that the mesentery was a single organ, which precipitated advancement in colon and rectum surgery and in sciences related to anatomy and development.

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;mesentery&quot; and its Neo-Latin equivalent &#x27; () use the combining forms &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, ultimately from ancient Greek (&#x27;), from (&#x27;, &quot;middle&quot;) + (&#x27;, &quot;gut&quot;), yielding &quot;mid-intestine&quot; or &quot;midgut&quot;. The adjectival form is &quot;mesenteric&quot; ().

=== Lymphangiology ===
An improved understanding of mesenteric structure and histology has enabled a formal characterization of mesenteric lymphangiology. Stereologic assessments of the lymphatic vessels demonstrate a rich lymphatic network embedded within the mesenteric connective tissue lattice. On average, vessels occur every , and within from the mesocolic surfaces—anterior and posterior. Lymphatic channels have also been identified in Toldt&#x27;s fascia, though the significance of this is unknown.

<text>In knowledge-based systems, agents choose actions based on the principle of rationality to move closer to a desired goal. The agent is able to make decisions based on knowledge it has about the world (see knowledge level). But for the agent to actually change its state, it must use whatever means it has available. This level of description for the agent&#x27;s behavior is the symbol level. The term was coined by Allen Newell in 1982.

For example, in a computer program, the knowledge level consists of the information contained in its data structures that it uses to perform certain actions. The symbol level consists of the program&#x27;s algorithms, the data structures themselves, and so on.

<text>Henri Belolo (; 27 November 1936 – 3 August 2019) was a French music producer and songwriter active during the disco era.

Born in Morocco, he started his career as a club DJ and A&amp;R man. In the 1970s, with his friend, composer Jacques Morali, he worked in the United States, creating The Ritchie Family as well as their most successful group, Village People.

== Life and career ==
Belolo was born to a Moroccan Jewish family in Casablanca, Morocco, and grew up there listening to music introduced by US troops as well as that of African musicians. He studied business in Casablanca, before traveling in 1956 to Paris, France, where he met record company owner and producer Eddie Barclay. Belolo worked with Barclay, importing and promoting records, and started working as a club DJ, work which he continued after returning to Casablanca.

In 1960, he was recruited by Polydor Records in Paris to work in A&amp;R and as a producer, where he worked on albums by Georges Moustaki, Serge Renée, and Jeanne Moreau. He also organized concerts in Paris by James Brown, the Bee Gees and others. He then set up his own record label, Carabine, and music publishing company, Scorpio Music, and in the early 1970s began licensing disco records.

In 1973, he moved to the US and set up Can&#x27;t Stop Productions in New York City, with an associated talent scout office in Philadelphia. He met Jacques Morali in early 1975, and the pair produced the single &quot;Brazil&quot; by the Ritchie Family, recorded in Philadelphia and arranged by Richie Rome who gave the group its name. The song became a US club hit, and then a worldwide success, in 1975, helped by promotion from DJ Frankie Crocker. Belolo and Morali continued to work together, with Belolo predominantly writing lyrics and Morali the music.

Unlike his associate Morali, Belolo was not gay; however, he visited clubs with Morali and saw the potential of appealing to the gay nightclub scene. In 1977, they created the group Village People, seeing their image of gay stereotypes as a way to embody a certain partying spirit. Belolo and Morali began working with the band and presented their demos to Neil Bogart of Casablanca Records, who agreed to release the band&#x27;s records. Belolo continued to contribute to the Village People records, including &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot;, &quot;In the Navy&quot;, and &quot;Go West&quot;, with Morali and, in some cases, the band&#x27;s lead singer Victor Willis. In 2015, Willis won a legal case against Can&#x27;t Stop Productions, successfully claiming that he and Morali had written the songs together, without any involvement from Belolo. The production company claimed that Belolo had written French lyrics that were then adapted by Willis, but this claim was rejected by the court which ruled that Belolo&#x27;s name as co-writer should be removed.

In the 1980s, Belolo and Morali introduced and produced records by Break Machine. Belolo continued to work in France as a music producer, until his death on 3 August 2019 in Paris, France.

<text>Jean-Jacques Pelletier (born 1947 in Montreal, Quebec) is a French Canadian philosophy professor and author. Pelletier was a long-time philosophy teacher with the Lévis-Lauzon post-secondary school, but is best known in several media as an author of French-language thrillers, some of which have an element of fantasy. Many of his works have received critical acclaim, as his short story &quot;La Bouche barbelée&quot; won a CBC/Radio-Canada contest in 1993.

Pelletier has had several other works published as well, and his works &quot;Blunt - Les treize derniers jours&quot; and &quot;La Chair disparue&quot; were published as serials in the popular Montreal magazine &quot;La Presse&quot; in 1997–1998.

&quot;La Chair disparue&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2005, where it was defended by pianist Alain Lefèvre.

<text>Jacques Morali (4 July 1947 – 15 November 1991) was a French disco and dance music record producer and songwriter, known for collaborating with Henri Belolo to create acts such as The Ritchie Family and Village People.

==Early life==
Morali was born in 1947 (although some sources say 1946) in Casablanca, French Morocco to a Moroccan Jewish family.

==Career==

===Beginning in France===
Morali made his start in the music business at the end of the 1960s, writing music for orchestras in Paris, for the Crazy Horse, for himself as a solo artist (he played in 1967 show &quot;Elle aime, elle n&#x27;aime pas&quot; and released a single of the same title) but also for performers like Peter Fersen. Viva Zapata (Venus VS-71451), one of his first French productions, was sung by &quot;Clint Farwood&quot; - a pseudonym for a member of King Harvest. In the early 1970s, Morali met French music producer Henri Belolo. But he thought quickly that his success in France was not as great as expected and decided to try his luck in North America. Through meeting José Eber, Elizabeth Taylor and Cher&#x27;s hairdresser, he became familiar with Philadelphia International Records. At the time, Morali proposed several projects to Belolo without convincing him.

===International===
In 1975, Morali told Belolo about his intention to adapt the song &quot;Brazil&quot; from &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; starring Carmen Miranda. The idea was to make an epic record for the clubs, sung by larger-than-life female singers. Seduced by the idea, Belolo agreed to finance a long-lasting Morali residency at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia. That was the start of their collaboration. They cast three girls (Cheryl Jacks, Cassandra Wooten and Gwendolyn Oliver) and named the band The Ritchie Family. &quot;Brazil&quot; was a solid success, the first of many that made them long-term partners (&quot;The Best Disco In Town&quot; (1976), &quot;Life Is Music&quot; (1977), &quot;African Queens&quot; (1977), &quot;Quiet Village&quot; (1977) &amp; &quot;American Generation&quot; (1978)), both as creator and author, on top of also being writer and editor (Black Scorpio Publishing).

===Mainstream===
While in New York, Morali attended a costume ball at &quot;Les Mouches&quot;, a gay disco in Greenwich Village. Seeing the types of costumes and some common ensembles worn by the party guests, the idea came to him to put together a group of singers and dancers, each one playing a different gay fantasy figure. At first, Belolo was not involved in this project, but when he saw that Morali had succeeded in signing a licensing deal with Casablanca Records (one of the more famous disco labels), Belolo decided to become his close sidekick on the project. The Village People&#x27;s songs include &quot;San Francisco (You&#x27;ve Got Me)&quot; (1977), &quot;YMCA&quot; (1978), &quot;Macho Man&quot; (1978), &quot;In the Navy&quot; (1979), &quot;Go West&quot; (1980) and &quot;Sex Over the Phone&quot; (1985) and they became one of the more successful acts of the disco era with their flamboyant concept albums.

Jacques Morali&#x27;s music was characterized by simple arrangements, a unique sense of camp, simplistic lyrics and simple catchy melodies that could be remembered easily. Between 1974 and 1982, he recorded over 65 albums. He co-wrote songs for many artists including Patrick Juvet, Régine, Dalida, Eric Russell, Cher, Patricia Norton, Julius Brown, Starlight, Diva, Dennis Parker, David London, Wayne Scott, Lova Moor and Pia Zadora. After the post-1970s disco backlash, he began collaborating with Fred Zarr, precipitating work with Break Machine and 1984&#x27;s Eartha Kitt album &quot;I Love Men&quot;.

In the late 1970s, he had a sexual relationship with singer/actor/adult film star Wade Nichols/Dennis Parker.

==Death==
Morali contracted HIV in the mid-1980s. On 15 November 1991, he died of AIDS-related causes at a hospital in Paris at the age of 44. Morali was buried in Saint-Paul-de-Vence.

<text>Eric Abetz (born 25 January 1958) is an Australian politician. He was a Senator for Tasmania from 1994 to 2022, representing the Liberal Party, and since March 2024 has been a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly for the Franklin electorate. 

He was the Minister for Employment and the Leader of the Government in the Senate in the Abbott government from 2013 to 2015. He previously also served as Special Minister of State in the Howard government from 2001 to 2006 and as Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation from 2006 to 2007.

Born in Germany, Abetz emigrated to Australia as a small child, when his father came to work for Tasmania&#x27;s Hydro Electric Commission. He was educated at the University of Tasmania and was a barrister and solicitor before entering politics. He is a former national president of the Australian Liberal Students&#x27; Federation and was state president of the Tasmanian Liberals from 1990 to 1994.

==Family and personal life==
The youngest of six children, Abetz emigrated from Germany to Australia with his parents in 1961. His father, Walter Abetz, a radio technician in the Nazi Germany armed forces who lost a leg fighting on the Russian Front, came to Australia to work for Tasmania&#x27;s Hydro Electric Commission, which had advertised for skilled workers in German newspapers.

Eric Abetz&#x27;s great uncle, Otto Abetz, was a Nazi SS officer, German ambassador to Vichy France, and a convicted war criminal. Eric&#x27;s grandfather was Karl Abetz, a professor of forestry science, who joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and became general consultant of the Reich Forestry Office in 1942.

Abetz married Michelle Oates in 1991, and they had three children. His wife died of cancer in 2019. He is a Christian.

Abetz&#x27;s brother, Peter Abetz, was the Liberal member for Southern River in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from the 2008 state election until 2017.

==Studies==
Abetz studied at Taroona High School, Hobart Matriculation College and the University of Tasmania, earning degrees in law and arts in 1981. He served as president of the University of Tasmania Liberal Club, and in 1980–1981, he became the first Tasmanian to become national president of the Australian Liberal Students&#x27; Federation, during which time he came into political conflict with Nick Sherry and Sue Mackay, both later to be Australian Labor Party senators.

==Early political career: 1993–2007 in opposition and Government==
He won preselection as a candidate for the Senate in the 1984 and 1993 elections but did not win a seat. He was then chosen to fill the casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Brian Archer in 1994, and was elected in his own right at the subsequent 1998 election and re-elected in 2004, 2010 and 2016. Abetz was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence 1998–2001 and was Special Minister of State from January 2001 until 2006.

He has served as Chairman of the Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee and Chairman of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. He also served as Chairman of the Attorney-General and Justice Government Members&#x27; Committee.

He was a member of a Parliamentary Delegation which visited France and Belgium in June and July 1997, and made an official visit to the United Kingdom in September 1999.

He was Minister for Forestry from a reshuffle of the Howard ministry in January 2006 until its defeat at the 2007 election. He commenced his portfolio by attacking the Australian Greens and environmentalists in general as anti-Australian. He described the campaign against woodchipping as &quot;akin to treason&quot; and branded the Greens an &quot;extreme left&quot; party. This allowed him to position the government&#x27;s priorities as mainstream issues which both major parties wanted action on.

Abetz is a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party.

==Later political career: 2007–2022 in opposition and government==
===2009 OzCar affair===
In mid-2009 Abetz was a central figure in the OzCar affair, which involved false allegations that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan had improperly given favourable treatment to a car dealer, John Grant, who was a friend of the Prime Minister. At a Senate inquiry on 19 June, Abetz asked a series of questions of a Treasury official, Godwin Grech, who testified that he had a &quot;recollection&quot; that a member of Rudd&#x27;s staff had sent him an email in February, asking that he provide preferential treatment to Grant. Abetz read out the text of what he said was an email, which purported to ask for preferential treatment for Grant. On 4 August 2009, Grech admitted that he had forged the email. Abetz then issued an apology, saying: &quot;I am not only sorry to Malcolm Turnbull but to the Australian people and any anguish that may have been occasioned to Kevin Rudd and other people.&quot;

===Eligibility to hold Senate office===
On 30 July 2010, Tasmanian resident John Hawkins lodged an objection to Abetz&#x27;s nomination for re-election, alleging that Abetz still held dual citizenship of both his birthplace, Germany, and Australia and thus was ineligible under Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia. Hawkins subsequently withdrew the petition to the High Court of Australia.

===Minister under the Abbott government===
In September 2013 Abetz was appointed Minister for Employment in the Abbott government and oversaw the drafting of legislation to reestablish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, the establishment of a Registered Organisations Commission following the Craig Thomson Affair, and the launching of the Royal Commission into trade union governance and corruption and Fair Work Act Review. Abetz also designed and implemented the Government&#x27;s Jobactive Employment Services Reforms.

In August 2014 Abetz received criticism from the media and politicians such as the Greens&#x27; Adam Bandt for making claims of a link between abortion and breast cancer when appearing on &quot;The Project&quot;. He had been on &quot;The Project&quot; to discuss his association with the World Congress of Families.

It was reported in May 2015 that Abetz was quoted as saying of Joe de Bruyn, national president of the SDA, the largest private sector trade union in Australia, that &quot;he is a role model of trade union officialdom. He is the type of official that gives trade unionism a good name.&quot; De Bruyn spent 36 years as National Secretary of the SDA, known for its close relationships with major employers such as Coles and Woolworths. De Bruyn had also been known for his staunch and vocal opposition to same-sex marriage.

===Dropped from ministry===
Abetz was dropped from the First Turnbull Ministry upon the ascension of the Turnbull government, with George Brandis succeeding Abetz as Leader of the Government in the Senate. In the three days where Abetz was Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull&#x27;s representative in the Senate Abetz said &quot;The King is dead, long live the King&quot; in reference to the leadership change.

Abetz is a Christian and a member of the Christian Reformed Churches of Australia. Throughout his political career he has been variously associated with conservative groups, including the Association of Christian Parent Controlled Schools, Salt Shakers, Focus on the Family, Lyons Forum, Endeavour Forum, Family Council of Victoria, Fatherhood Foundation, Australian Christian Lobby, Australian Family Association and Right to Life Australia. In October 2015, Abetz attracted controversy after referring to Justice Clarence Thomas of the U.S. Supreme Court as a &quot;negro American&quot; during a radio interview.

In 2017 when Cory Bernardi moved a motion to ban abortion on gender grounds Abetz was 1 of the 10 who voted Yes on the Motion. It was voted down with (10–36).

Abetz is a public opponent of same-sex marriage, and was one of twelve senators who voted against the &quot;Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017&quot;, which legalised same-sex marriage in Australia.

During Senate debates regarding the Nuclear Fuel Cycle (Facilitation) Bill, presented by Senator Cory Bernardi in November 2017, Abetz strongly endorsed the prospect of nuclear power in Australia. He described nuclear power as &quot;the very best source of energy production that science has to offer the world&quot; and claimed that it offered &quot;affordable and reliable energy, with no emissions at all.&quot;

===2021 alleged &quot;slut-shaming&quot; comments===

On 24 March 2021, two days after Tasmanian House of Assembly speaker Sue Hickey resigned from the Liberal Party to sit as an independent, Hickey accused Abetz in the House of making &quot;slut-shaming&quot; comments on Brittany Higgins, who allegedly had been raped by a male staffer in the Federal Parliament in Canberra. Hickey claimed that Abetz had told her at a citizenship ceremony in Hobart on 1 March:As for that Higgins girl, anybody so disgustingly drunk who would sleep with anybody could have slept with one of our spies and put the security of the nation at risk.
Hickey also alleged that Abetz had told her &quot;not to worry&quot; about the separate allegation against federal Attorney-General Christian Porter that he had raped a woman in 1988, as &quot;the woman is dead and the law will protect [Porter]&quot;. Abetz &quot;categorically denied&quot; making any of these comments and accused Hickey of &quot;trying to destroy the [Liberal] party&quot;. Hickey responded to Abetz by accusing him of &quot;grubby politics&quot; and said that she stood by her statement.

Later on 24 March, Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein wrote to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, stating that Hickey had raised the matter of Abetz&#x27;s comments with him weeks earlier and requested Morrison to &quot;consider the matters raised&quot;.

===Defeat at 2022 federal election===
Since entering the Senate, Abetz was always placed first in Liberal Party preselection for Senate elections, which all but guaranteed him winning one of the six Senate seats normally available for the state. On 8 May 2021, it was announced that, for the next federal election, he had been dropped to third place, substantially reducing his prospect of re-election. This ended up costing him his seat at the election in May 2022, as Jacqui Lambie Network candidate Tammy Tyrrell won the state&#x27;s sixth Senate seat ahead of Abetz. As a result, his Senate term ended on 30 June 2022.

On 31 August 2022, the Australian Monarchist League announced Abetz as Campaign Director of the Vote No Republic campaign.

==State politics==
On 7 January 2024, it was reported that Abetz would seek the preselection of the Liberal Party as a candidate for Franklin at the 2024 Tasmanian state election.

On 23 March 2024, Abetz was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly for the Franklin electorate. Abetz was appointed as Minister for Business, Industry and Resources and Minister for Transport in the Rockliff Government as well as leader of the House.

<doc id="637870" wikidata="Q1045889" url="?curid=637870" title="Only Yesterday (1991 film)">
<text>is a 1991 Japanese animated drama film written and directed by Isao Takahata, based on the 1982 manga &quot;Omoide Poro Poro&quot; by Hotaru Okamoto and Yuko Tone. Produced by Toshio Suzuki, it was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network and Hakuhodo, and distributed by Toho. The film follows a twenty seven year-old Taeko Okajima as she takes a holiday with her relatives in the country, during the course of her trip she reminisces about her life when she was ten. The ending theme song is a Japanese translation of Amanda McBroom&#x27;s composition &quot;The Rose&quot;.

The film was released on July 20, 1991. A surprise box office success, it attracted a large adult audience and became the highest-grossing Japanese film of 1991 in the country. It has also been well received by critics outside of Japan—maintaining a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. To celebrate the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, GKIDS released the film for the first time in an English-language format on February 26, 2016, featuring the voices of Daisy Ridley, Dev Patel, Alison Fernandez, Laura Bailey and Ashley Eckstein. A stage musical based on the film toured Japan in 2011, and a 2021 live-action sequel follows a 64-year-old Taeko with her daughter and granddaughter.

==Plot==
In 1982, Taeko Okajima lives in Tokyo as an unmarried workaholic that enjoys visiting the rural countryside. She decides to take another trip to visit her eldest sister Nanako&#x27;s in-laws to help with the safflower harvest. While traveling at night on a sleeper train to Yamagata, she begins to recall memories of herself as a ten-year-old schoolgirl in 1966, and her intense desire to go on holiday like her classmates, all of whom have family outside of the big city. This precipitates a series of memories from the same school year, including how she met her first boyfriend (a baseball star in an adjacent class), the first time she and her family ate a pineapple, and how she learned about and indirectly dealt with puberty.

When Taeko arrives, she is surprised to find that her brother-in-law&#x27;s second cousin Toshio, whom she barely knows, is the one who came to pick her up. Toshio himself moved back from the city to become a farmer and help his family, but became passionate about farming and decided to stay. Taeko continues to reflect on the memories of her ten-year-old self, and tells her family about them. When she sees her young cousin Naoko unsuccessfully ask her mother for Puma sneakers, Taeko tells her about how she once similarly wanted a purse. Her elder sister Yaeko was asked to give her an old one, the ensuing argument continues, culminating in a sulking Taeko becoming indecisive about whether to join her family to go out for food. In a moment of panic she chases her family out of the house but is slapped by her father for walking outside barefoot (an indicator of poverty in post-War Japan). Taeko reflects that she was partially in the wrong herself for begging for more things, convincing Naoko to move on.

Later, when having lunch with Toshio, Taeko recalls about how she always struggled with the concept of fractions in school, and asks him if he ever similarly struggled with something. Toshio mentions his compulsion as a farmer has troubled him due to the industry dying out, and muses how the entire rural landscape was built by farmers in spite of this. Seeing how they all connect with each other, Taeko realizes that the rural country is making her nostalgic, and that her memories are wielding a tapestry for her present self to reminisce on. With this, she recalls to Toshio and Naoko about how she once discovered a talent for acting and was nearly cast in a university play, only for her father to shut the idea down, making the rest of the family crestfallen; by high school Taeko moved on, discovering that drama was not her passion.

On the eve of Taeko&#x27;s departure, Toshio&#x27;s grandmother – sensing Taeko wishes to stay – suddenly suggests that Taeko stay in the country and marry Toshio, flustering her. As she runs out of the house to be alone, she recalls her brief encounter with an ill-mannered, working class kid. Forced to sit next to him at school, she is the only one who treats him with kindness and dignity, even as she hates being around him and her friends bad-mouth him. When he moves schools, however, she is the only person he refuses to shake hands with. Toshio soon finds Taeko in the rain, and she tells him about the same kid as he drives her back. Toshio bluntly suggests that he may have liked her, while also implying his own feelings for her. Realizing how easy it is to talk with Toshio, Taeko starts to realize her own feelings for him.

Taeko leaves the next day, promising to visit again in the winter. As she sits on the train, however, she is approached by the memories of all her classmates including her past self, who wordlessly convince her that what she really wants is to stay. She gets off the train and meets with Toshio, who drives her back as her past self looks on.

==Cast and characters==
== Production ==
The film is based on a manga by the same name written by Hotaru Okamoto and drawn by Yuko Tone. Animated by Studio Ghibli, the film&#x27;s producer Hayao Miyazaki was intrigued by the original &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; manga, believing there was potential value in depicting the type of children&#x27;s story it told. However, he felt he was not up to the task of adapting it into a film, but the idea remained in his mind as he directed other children&#x27;s films such as &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, and he eventually brought the idea to Takahata. Only those scenes set in 1966 with the 10-year-old Taeko are from the source material. Takahata had difficulty adapting the episodic manga into a feature film, and he, therefore, invented the framing narrative wherein the adult Taeko journeys to the countryside and falls in love with Toshio.

During production, Miyazaki and Takahata&#x27;s relationship was at times fraught. Artists were sometimes subject to bursts of anger, and although they later made up, Miyazaki would constantly complain that Takahata was unable to meet production deadlines. Due to Takahata&#x27;s laxity in meeting scheduled deadlines, spring screenings planned in advance of the summer release had to be cancelled. The film&#x27;s animation director was Yoshifumi Kondo. The need for more people to work on the film caused Studio Ghibli to place advertisements in &quot;Animage&quot;. In Japan&#x27;s animated film industry at the time, common practice was to pay workers per drawing or painting they did, this often led to animators earning at a lower rate than the average in society. During production of &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; Miyazaki proposed changes to the staffing of Studio Ghibli. Beginning in November 1990 full-time employment (including fixed salaries), regular recruitment, and in-house animation training programmes were initiated, doubling production costs. This required a constant stream of production, leading Miyazaki to begin working on &quot;Porco Rosso&quot; by himself before work could be finished on &quot;Only Yesterday&quot;. It was around this time that he proposed building a new studio in Koganei, Tokyo.

The story takes place within the Takase district of Yamagata City, Yamagata Prefecture. The Takase Station (and also Yamadera Station) of the JNR (currently JR East) Senzan Line is featured prominently; though it has since been rebuilt, the scenery remains mostly unchanged. During the course of the film, characters visit prominent locales, including the resort destination of Mount Zaō. In order to create an accurate picture of Yamagata, 450 colours were used in the realisation of its scenery, with the colour department taking around a year to find the correct shade of red that accurately captured the flowers during summer. Taeko recalls her childhood favorite puppet show &quot;&quot; () which was an actual puppet show that aired every weekday on NHK from 1964 to 1969. The puppet from the show seen in the film was based on a creation by Mitsuo Iso made from thick cloth, styrofoam, pencils, and sellotape.

Unlike the typical Japanese character animation style, the characters have more realistic facial muscles and expressions due to much of the dialogue being recorded first (the tradition in Japan is to record it after the animation is completed) and the animators fit the animation to the spoken dialogue. Takahata also had voice actors record some of their lines together, using footage of their performances as a guide for both design and the animation. Some changes had to be made to the film, requiring re-recording of certain parts. &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; was the first film that Toshio&#x27;s voice actor Yanagiba had dubbed, he described his reaction to the unity of voice and animation as finding it &quot;very strange&quot;. Assistant director Norihiko Sudo used an 8 mm camera and quick action recorder to study realistic movements, these images were then printed in order to deconstruct unnatural movements that were standardised in animation at the time. However, the scenes of Taeko&#x27;s childhood past were animated before the voices were recorded, subtly contrasting the anime style of her childhood and the adult &quot;reality&quot; of the framing story. Voice actress Miki Imai was the model for the adult Taeko.

== Themes ==

=== Memory and nostalgia ===
The holiday Taeko takes to the countryside is a journey of remembrance that recalls her childhood, re-discovering how her mundane feelings and memories mix with her present self, drawing on a tradition of live-action family movies in classic Japanese cinema. To Susan Napier &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; is a celebration of &quot;youth, innocence, and nostalgia for a disappearing past&quot;, which she categorises as exemplifying the &#x27;elegiac&#x27; genre mode in anime. Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc write that the transition from the city to the country reflects Taeko&#x27;s nostalgia and different visions of growing up in a changing Japan, this is achieved through both a metaphysical and literal trip, symbolised by Taeko&#x27;s train journeys. They contrast the stylised 1980s sequences with the flashback sequences&#x27; &quot;less authentic &#x27;realism&#x27;&quot;. As part of this aesthetic separation, the frame of the flashback sequences uses a softer colour palette with faded edges, while the 1980s scenes use precise lines in animating characters and environments. The film&#x27;s &quot;conservative&quot; structure embodies a perspective Napier refers to as &quot;quintessentially &#x27;Japanese&#x27;&quot;, reflecting a domestic positioning in a Japan whose international role was changing.

Nostalgic elements from the 1960s, such as the fashion and music interspersed throughout the film, are rendered wistful by Taeko&#x27;s struggle to come to terms with her past self. Leaving Taeko&#x27;s dreams unfulfilled, the film&#x27;s conclusion is left ambiguous, referring to its nostalgia as part of the adult Taeko&#x27;s personal development. Part of this nostalgia is felt through the comparison between the city and the countryside, continued urban expansion is set against a desire to live in a traditional manner. Taeko briefly takes off her gloves when handling the safflower to empathise with past generations of farmers who worked for the aesthetic luxury of women in Kyoto. Toshio places this in the wider context of the present agricultural industry. The contrast between Taeko&#x27;s personal memories and the collective history of the countryside presents two forms of nostalgia, with Taeko&#x27;s year of &quot;emotional and sexual growth&quot; being a means by which her past self can be integrated into her renewed self.

=== Environment ===
&quot;Only Yesterday&quot; gives a positive experience of country life through Taeko&#x27;s eyes. By allowing her to fulfil her childlike dream of living in the countryside, it explores the sentiment of her confined memories. To Napier, the rural Other, located next to the urban centres of postmodernity represents a successful escape to the challenges of modern life. This theme reflects Japanese state-sponsored programmes that, beginning in the mid-1980s, have encouraged people to move to the country. To Odell and Le Blanc, the opposition between Taeko&#x27;s urban and rural environments leads to a debate concerning the gap in social community between the city and the country. By the end of the film Taeko leaves behind her isolated life as a spinster in an overpopulated city to integrate into a new community environment. They compare this form of community living to that shown in Takahata&#x27;s earlier film &quot;&quot; (1968), noting that in &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; &quot;socialism is a notable but subtle subtext&quot;.

Roger Hecht in his analysis of the film utlilises the concept of from the philosophy of Watsuji Tetsuro to explain the metaphysical relationship people form with nature. This relationship being threatened by the alienation of local people from the traditions and environment of the countryside, as well as the direction of Japan&#x27;s booming economy. In this analysis he presents Taeko&#x27;s first day arriving in the countryside as a reconnection between people, work, and spirituality, highlighting how she follows her in-laws in stopping to pray during her work as the sun rises. The &quot;satoyama&quot; as a working landscape therein represents a coexistence between humans and nature, despite representing &quot;a disappearing model of sustainable stewardship.&quot; He concludes his analysis by reflecting on the family&#x27;s judgements that Taeko has internalised in her childhood memories, explaining her experience of &quot;fūdo&quot; and blooming romance with Toshio as a form of psychological recovery.

==Release==

=== Theatrical ===
The film released in Japan on July 20, 1991, by Toho in theaters. Despite the movie&#x27;s success in the Japanese box office, &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; was not released to other Western countries for over a decade. The film had an advertisement tie-in with the tomato sauce brand, Kagome. Children&#x27;s lunch sets were made and launched upon the film&#x27;s release. The film was released theatrically in Brazil on July 10, 1993.

In 2015, GKIDS announced it would release the film in theaters in North America in 2016 along with an English dub, with actors Daisy Ridley, Dev Patel, Ashley Eckstein and Alison Fernandez confirmed to lend their voices. The film premiered in New York City on January 1, 2016, with a wider North American release on February 26, 2016.

=== Home video ===
Germany was the first released the film on June 6, 2006, dubbed in the German language. Australia and the United Kingdom would follow suit in 2006 and distribute the film in their region under Madman Entertainment and Optimum Releasing respectively. In France, Belgium, and Switzerland, a DVD was released on October 31, 2007, without a French dub. In North America, the film held the longest distinction of being the only theatrical Studio Ghibli feature not yet released on home video. Walt Disney Studios, which had then owned the North American distribution rights to Studio Ghibli&#x27;s catalog, refused to release it because of its candid treatment of menstruation in the flashback sequences. In celebration of its 25th anniversary, &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; was later released on Blu-Ray and DVD on July 5, 2016, by GKIDS and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, earning $1,780,357 in sales revenue. A subtitled version of the film was aired on Turner Classic Movies in January 2006, as part of the channel&#x27;s month-long salute to Miyazaki and Ghibli.

==Music==

Takahata commissioned an image album from Katsu Hoshi (credited as &quot;Katz&quot;), releasing in December 1990, preceding the release of the film by nearly seven months. Hoshi and Takahata repurposed some of these songs for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, while also including snippets from popular Japanese rock bands (e.g. &quot;The Wild Ones&quot;), motifs from Schubert and Brahms, and international folk music. Takahata even wrote his own translation of the pop song &quot;The Rose&quot;, performed by &quot;enka&quot; singer Harumi Miyako. Takahata planned &#x27;three pillars of music&#x27; for the film, the first pillar was diegetic and non-diegetic snippets of music highlighting specific moments of Taeko&#x27;s flashbacks; the second pillar was Eastern European folk music such as the Bulgarian Women&#x27;s Chorus and &quot;Frunzuliță Lemn Adus Cântec De Nuntă&quot; (Fluttering Green Leaves Wedding Song), a Romanian folk song written by Gheorghe Zamfir, using a nai played by Zamfir himself, cimbalom and violins; the third pillar was a series of introspective compositions for the piano and a small string ensemble designed to be played over scenes of Taeko&#x27;s self-examination of her past. These &#x27;three pillars&#x27; were used by Takahata to help conceptualise the film&#x27;s structure of &#x27;quotation&#x27;.

The repeated Eastern European theme in the film, particularly in the soundtrack reflecting the peasant lifestyle still present in the area draws parallels with Japanese rural life. For instance, Hungarian music in the film such as the use of Brahms&#x27; &quot;Hungarian Dance No. 5&quot; in a scene where Taeko is eating lunch, and making references to Hungarian musicians when she is in the car with Toshio (&quot;Teremtés&quot; performed by Sebestyén Márta &amp; Muzsikás. Adaptation from a Hungarian traditional folk song). The music of Márta Sebestyén with Muzsikás is used in several scenes as well. Bulgarian folk music is also used in the soundtrack. When Taeko is on the field, one can first hear &quot;Dilmano, Dilbero&quot;, followed by &quot;Malka Moma Dvori Mete&quot;. These are typical Bulgarian folk songs and the lyrics of both are connected to topics mentioned in the film – the life of farmers and marriage.

== Reception ==

===Critical reception===
The film received widespread critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 100%, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The critical consensus states &quot;&quot;Only Yesterday&quot;″s long-delayed U.S. debut fills a frustrating gap for American Ghibli fans while offering further proof of the studio&#x27;s incredibly consistent commitment to quality.&quot; It has a score 90 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 19 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film a very favorable review in his essay regarding anime and the other work of Studio Ghibli calling it &quot;a touching, melancholy meditation on the life of the same woman at ages 10 and 27.&quot; Nicolas Rapold, of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;Mr. Takahata&#x27;s psychologically acute film, which was based on a manga, seems to grow in impact, too, as the adult Taeko comes to a richer understanding of what she wants and how she wants to live.&quot; Glenn Kenny of RogerEbert.com awarded it a similarly positive review, saying &quot;Like &quot;Kaguya&quot;, it functions as a highly sensitive and empathetic consideration of the situation of women in Japanese society—but it&#x27;s also a breathtaking work of art on its own.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
== Media ==

=== Manga ===
Written by Hotaru Okamoto and drawn by Yuko Tone, the original &quot;josei&quot; manga was published in 1982, with the first volume released in 1990. Set in the 1960s, the manga only depicts the life of Taeko as a fifth-grader. The film&#x27;s direct adaptations from the original manga are faithful.

=== Live-action special ===
A live-action special serving as a continutation of the film debuted in Japan in 2021. Set in 2020, it follows Taeko (who is now a grandmother) as she lives with her daughter and granddaughter in 2020 Tokyo. Directed by Kazutaka Watanabe and written by Koichi Yajima, it stars Keiko Matsuzaka as Taeko, and Anne Watanabe as her daughter Natsuki. Shooting took place around September 2020.

=== Stage adaptation ===
A musical adaptation of the film was announced in 2010, debuting in 2011. After opening at the Galaxy Theatre in Shinagawa ward on April 16, it played in Akita before touring the whole country in 2012. The play starred Asami Hikaru (who played Taeko) and Mori Keaki of the Takarazuka theatre group, and Mieno Aoi of the Warabiza theatre company. The director was Kuriyama Tamiya. Tickets went on sale on December 4, 2010.

<text>WGCT-CD (channel 39) is a low-power, Class A television station in Columbus, Ohio, United States, affiliated with Tri-State Christian Television (TCT). The station is owned by the Central Ohio Association of Christian Broadcasters, and is relayed on WOCB-CD in Marion, WXCB-CD in Delaware and WQIZ-LD in Ashland.

==History==
===W08BV era (1983–1998)===
In 1983, the station&#x27;s construction permit was assigned by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The station began broadcasting in 1985, under the callsign of W08BV, as the first low-power television station in the Columbus media market. In its first years on the air, it aired syndicated programming, and it also boasted an in-house sports broadcasting unit. Sports coverage on W08BV included football and basketball games involving more than 30 high schools in the area, mainly in Franklin County. It also held a contract to cover Ohio State Buckeyes women&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s gymnastics, as well as hockey and wrestling.

===WINJ-LP/WGCT-CA era (1998–2010)===
It changed its calls to WINJ-LP (&quot;We&#x27;re Into Jesus&quot;) in 1998 and WGCT-CA in 2006. Prior to the purchase by its current owners, the station showed a variety of programs, the bulk of which were old public domain movies, old cartoons, and religious programs, as well as children&#x27;s programming created by the station. Former owner Ella Flowers (1938–2017) was featured prominently in many of the musical and religious programs. The animated segments produced by Flowers would later gain some notoriety online after a few clips of the program were uploaded to YouTube back in 2007 with no context as to their production or origins, with one upload titling the show as the &quot;Pink Morning Cartoon&quot;. Eventually, the uploads of these animated segments would be brought to the attention of many on the Internet, which set forth a search for any information and more potential footage of the cartoon.

===WGCT-CD era (2010–present)===
The station switched to digital on June 13, 2010, and changed its call letters to WGCT-CD. It previously broadcast at 83 watts, but has recently increased its power to 3,000 watts.

The station is not available on any local cable systems. Even with the power increase, its signal is limited to the immediate Columbus area.

==Subchannels==
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

<text>An argus, or argus pheasant, is a member of a clade in the tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae, containing two species of bird that are closely related to peafowl.

==Description==
It has hundreds or thousands of tiny white spots on its plumage pattern, and thus its naming might have been in reference to the mythical hundred-eyed giant, Argus Panoptes. These birds have a body shape similar to that of a turkey, however the males have long wing and tail feathers. Males are over six feet long while females are just under three feet long. Their feathers are brown or tan, with black mottling. The Male Argus have round, eye-like circles on their feathers. Males have quite long tails, with some tails measuring nearly five feet long. Females choose males with the longest tails because it means they are the fastest and smartest of the other birds. This species of birds is primarily found in tropical regions, or places with lots of plant growth and rainfall. The Great Argus lives in Sumatra, Southeast Asia, and Borneo. In Asia, they primarily inhabit the Malaysian Peninsula, Thailand, and south Myanmar. Their population density depends on the region at hand. Populations in some areas are healthy and more common, while others are low and rare. The lifespan of the Argus in the wild is unknown, but zoos have reported the species living up to 20 years of age.

==Taxonomy==
Two genera of birds are considered arguses: &quot;Rheinardia&quot; and &quot;Argusianus&quot;. Within these genera there are a total of three recognized species. &quot;Argusianus&quot; has also been credited with a mysterious second species that is sometimes thought to have gone extinct, but this is most likely based on a simple genetic aberration in the established species. Both genera are thought to be sister taxa to one another and are otherwise most closely related to the peafowl (genera &quot;Pavo&quot; and &quot;Afropavo&quot;), and slightly more distantly to the genus &quot;Tropicoperdix.&quot;

==Genus and distribution==
*Genus &quot;Argusianus&quot; 
**Great argus (&quot;Argusianus argus&quot; ) 
*Genus &quot;Rheinardia&quot; 
**Vietnamese crested argus (&quot;Rheinardia ocellata&quot; )
**Malayan crested argus (&quot;Rheinardia nigrescens&quot; ()

<doc id="637881" wikidata="Q6708298" url="?curid=637881" title="Lyn Allison">
<text>Lynette Fay Allison (born 21 October 1946) is an Australian politician. She was a member of the Australian Senate from 1996 to 2008, representing the state of Victoria. she is the national president of the Australian Democrats.

== Early life and background ==
Allison was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and grew up in the suburb of Fairfield with her younger brother and sister. Her father was a fitter and turner and her mother was involved in the local church, bowls club, and school tuckshop. Allison was educated at Rosanna High School, and left briefly in year 10 to become a dental nurse, before returning to complete high school. From 1964 to 1986 she worked as an administrator. She gained a Bachelor of Education at the University of Melbourne, and from 1987 to 1991 was a high school art teacher at St Joseph&#x27;s Technical School Abbotsford and St Paul&#x27;s College in Altona North.

== Political career ==
Allison was an Independent councillor of the City of Port Melbourne from 1992 to 1994.

In 1994 Allison contested the state by-election for the Victorian Legislative Assembly district of Williamstown after the resignation of Joan Kirner, the former Premier of Victoria. Standing as the Democrat candidate, Allison gained 39% of the two-candidate preferred vote, with the seat won by Labor candidate Steve Bracks.

=== Australian Senate ===
Allison won pre-selection on the Democrats ticket, was elected to the Australian Senate in 1996, and re-elected for a second term in the 2001 federal election.

Between 1998 and 2006, Allison served on the Legislation and References Committees for Environment, Recreation (later Information Technology), Communications and the Arts; and for Community Affairs. She served as Senate Select for Superannuation (1996–98); the Victorian Casino Inquiry (1996); the Lucas Heights Reactor (2000); Medicare (2003–04); and Mental Health (2005). From 1999 to 2001 Allison chaired an inquiry into the health effects of mobile phone towers. In 2002 she was a member of the Parliamentary Delegation to New Zealand.

In August 2002 Allison, along with fellow senators Aden Ridgeway, John Cherry, and Andrew Murray, succeeded in forcing Natasha Stott Despoja to resign from leadership. The media did not portray the spill kindly, labelling them the &#x27;Gang of Four&#x27;. Allison was Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats from 2002 to 2004. On 3 November 2004, following the resignation of Andrew Bartlett after the October 2004 election, she was elected unopposed as Leader. She took over the leadership at a time when the Democrats were at their lowest ever public opinion rating since the party was founded in 1977.

On 5 December 2006, Allison introduced into the Senate a bill titled the Cluster Munitions (Prohibition) Bill 2006, which, if enacted, would prevent Australia from using, possessing and manufacturing cluster munitions. Two months earlier, she had travelled to Lebanon to survey the damage caused by cluster munition use in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War. Allison, a leading feminist in the Australian parliament, was among a cross-party group of female parliamentarians who introduced legislation into parliament in 2006 which effectively legalised the supply of the abortion pill RU486. She advocated for federal government funding for public schools and nuclear disarmament.

=== The 2007 Election ===
The 2007 federal election, including a half-Senate election, was called for 24 November, and the Democrats national campaign launched in Melbourne, Allison&#x27;s home state, on 10 November. The official slogan &#x27;bring back balance&#x27; referred to the contest for the balance of power in the Senate. Allison&#x27;s seat was up for election along with three other Democrats senators (Natasha Stott Despoja, Andrew Murray and Andrew Bartlett) and was considered vulnerable after the Democrats poor performance in the 2004 election when the last Senate seat was won by Family First and the Coalition government gained control of the Senate for the first time in over 25 years.

During the 2007 election campaign, Allison announced a national preference deal with the Greens to increase the chance of a progressive party taking the balance of power in the Senate. Allison joined Bob Brown and Kate Lundy in a joint political advertisement sponsored by GetUp! urging voters to prevent the Senate from becoming a rubber stamp for the government of the day.

Allison received the support of community and interest groups such as the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, for her support for refugees and asylum seekers; the Friends of the ABC, for promoting public broadcasting; and endorsements by prominent women and feminists such as Barbara Spalding and Anne Summers.

The Democrats failed to retain their seats in the Senate, with Allison losing her seat to the Labor Party candidate David Feeney. Allison&#x27;s term expired on 30 June 2008, leaving the Australian Democrats with no federal representation for the first time since its founding in 1977.

==Return to politics ==
Allison is a board member of eight organisations including Berry Street, Vision Australia, Alzheimer&#x27;s Australia and her local nursing home. In 2012 Lyn Allison was inducted into the Victorian Honour Roll of Women for being a member of the Australian Senate from 1996 to 2008.

On 5 October 2019, Allison became the 12th President of the Australian Democrats, resuming an active role within the party.

== Personal life ==
Allison married when she was 21 years old, and three years later they bought a home in East St Kilda for about $11,000. They later divorced. She now lives in Port Melbourne with her long-term partner.

She was Director of the Employment and Economic Development Corporation.

Allison is an atheist who spoke first for the affirmative in a 2008 Australian Radio National debate &quot;Would We Be Better Off Without Religion?&quot;.

She was awarded the Australian Humanist of the Year award in 2008 for her work in education, environment and women&#x27;s rights.

<doc id="637882" wikidata="Q62437" url="?curid=637882" title="Frank Farian">
<text>Franz Reuther (18 July 1941 – 23 January 2024), known professionally as Frank Farian, was a German record producer and singer who founded the 1970s disco-pop group Boney M., the Latin pop band No Mercy, and the pop band Milli Vanilli. He frequently created vocal groups in which the publicised members merely lip-synced to songs sung by session performers. Farian owned the record label MCI and several subsidiaries. Over the course of his career, Farian sold over 850 million records and earned 800 gold and platinum certifications.

==Early life==
Farian was born in Kirn, Germany on 18 July 1941. He and two siblings were raised by his mother, because his father was killed in World War II before his birth. He trained as a cook before discovering rock and roll, renaming himself Frank Farian, and forming a band called Frankie Boys Schatten. In 1964, they released their first single, &quot;Shouting Ghost&quot;, which was a failure.

==Career==
In April 1967, he released a cover of Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Pitiful&quot; under the name &#x27;Frankie Farian&#x27;. After signing a recording contract as a solo performer, he moved into pop and appeared on the TV programme &quot;Hitparade&quot;. In 1976, Farian&#x27;s German-language cover of Dickey Lee&#x27;s &quot;Rocky&quot; stayed at No. 1 for four weeks. His 1973 single &quot;Was kann schöner sein?&quot;, a German language cover of the Lynsey de Paul/Ron Roker song &quot;When You&#x27;ve Gotta Go&quot;, was listed as one of the Top 100 all time &quot;Schlagerlieder&quot; by German magazine &quot;Popkultur&quot;.

===Boney M.===
In late 1974, he recorded &quot;Baby Do You Wanna Bump&quot; (a remake of Prince Buster&#x27;s song &quot;Al Capone&quot; from 1967), first released in 1975 as a single and on the 1976 album &quot;Take the Heat off Me&quot; under the pseudonym Boney M. He recruited a line-up which included vocalists Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett along with a front-man, Bobby Farrell, and a female dancer, Maizie Williams. Under the name Boney M., he achieved his biggest success in Europe as well as world-wide with songs including &quot;Daddy Cool&quot;, &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot;, &quot;Rasputin&quot; and a remake of &quot;Mary&#x27;s Boy Child&quot;. As later with Milli Vanilli, Farrell did not actually sing; in performances, he lip-synced to Farian&#x27;s own vocals.

===Far Corporation===
Farian also started the supergroup Far Corporation (named after the first syllable of his last name), which featured Steve Lukather, David Paich, Bobby Kimball, Simon Phillips (all from Toto fame), and Robin McAuley. Far Corporation were the first act to chart with a cover version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;; their cover was a top 10 hit in the UK, reaching number 8 in October 1985.

===Meat Loaf===
In 1986, Farian produced and mixed the Meat Loaf album &quot;Blind Before I Stop&quot;. He also sang backing vocals on the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Mercenaries&quot;, which was credited to Meat Loaf featuring John Parr.

===Milli Vanilli===

On 14 November 1990, Farian confessed to orchestrating the events leading to the Milli Vanilli scandal. As a producer, he assembled a group of session musicians and fronted it with physically attractive dancers Robert Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan. Following a 1989 performance where a backing track error first revealed the singers had been lip-syncing, Farian later confirmed to the press that others had sung on the albums. Milli Vanilli&#x27;s 1990 Grammy Award for Best New Artist was revoked, and at least 26 lawsuits were filed in the United States under U.S. consumer fraud protection laws.

===La Bouche, Le Click, Eruption, No Mercy===
Following the Milli Vanilli controversy, Farian developed similar Eurodance groups La Bouche and Le Click. He also produced the 1997 version of &quot;Tic, Tic Tac&quot; by Chilli Feat. Carrapicho.

Some other groups and solo acts Farian was involved with are Eruption (whom he managed in 1977), singer Precious Wilson, and Latin pop band No Mercy, which was based in Germany.

===&quot;Daddy Cool&quot; musical===
On 15 August 2006, the musical &quot;Daddy Cool&quot; opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London&#x27;s West End, featuring Michelle Collins, Michael Harvey, Javine Hylton, and singer/songwriter Darvina Plante. The £3 million show was produced by Farian and Robert Mackintosh. The story, written by Stephen Plaice with Amani Naphtali, is predominantly based on the songs of Boney M., but also has songs by Milli Vanilli, Eruption, La Bouche, and No Mercy. A second show opened on 23 April 2007 in Berlin, Germany, and toured in the Netherlands from August 2011 to February 2012, Spain (Palma de Mallorca) in July 2012, Switzerland from November 2015 to January 2016, and Germany in 2016.

===Other activities===
In 2006, Farian was credited as co-writing the song &quot;Doin&#x27; Fine&quot; with British producers Nathan Thomas and Carl M. Cox. (Other writers involved in the song were Chris Rudall, Baz Qureshi, Peter Wilson, Chris Richards, and George Reyam). Described as paying tribute to the sound of Boney M., the song was essentially a new composition featuring the string arrangement from Boney M.&#x27;s 1976 number one hit &quot;Daddy Cool&quot;. It was recorded by Australian pop singer Peter Wilson. It was initially released in the UK on 16 April 2007 in its extended format, entitled &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Cool 12&quot; Mix&quot;, and reached number one on the EuroDanceHits EuroNRG Top 40 in May 2007. The original version of &quot;Doin&#x27; Fine&quot; was featured on Peter Wilson&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Follow Me&quot;, released in the UK on 8 October 2007. It was also recorded in 2008 by Amanda Lear.

==Personal life==
Later in life, Farian resided in Miami, Florida, United States. He had three daughters and a son with his former common-law wife, Chinya Onyewenjo. His daughter Yanina sang with him in 2021 on a cover of &quot;Cherish&quot; by Kool &amp; the Gang. In 2022, he announced that his life had been saved by a surgery to replace an ailing heart valve with tissue from a pig&#x27;s organ.

Farian died in Miami on 23 January 2024 at the age of 82.

== In films ==
In 2023, Farian was portrayed by Matthias Schweighöfer in the film &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot;.

On 3 September 2024, it was announced that there is a documentary series covering the life and career of Farian in pre-production by Australian film producer Kaine Harling and Kelly Hauge, titled &quot;Behind the Curtain: The Frank Farian Story&quot;.

<text>Elizabeth Rebecca Pemberton-Mitchell (born 12 July 1952) is a Jamaican-British singer, best known as one of the original singers of the 1970s disco/reggae band Boney M. Mitchell now lives in Reading, UK. 

==Early life==
Mitchell was born in the parish of Clarendon, British Jamaica. At the age of eleven, Mitchell and her family emigrated to London, England, in 1963; her childhood home was in the district of Harlesden. By the end of the decade, she auditioned for &quot;Hair&quot; and eventually moved to West Berlin to join the German cast where she replaced Donna Summer. After &quot;Hair&quot;, Mitchell joined the Les Humphries Singers for a few years and represented West Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest with the Ralph Siegel title &quot;Sing Sang Song&quot;. The band was then reduced to only six singers (Liz was not one of them) for the show (their usual line-ups consisted of 20 performers and up) and came in 15th place with only 12 points, which they regarded as their beginning of the end as a band.

==Boney M.==
A phone call from Katja Wolff agency in February 1976 persuaded Mitchell to return to West Germany to join a new group being assembled by record producer Frank Farian which would become known as Boney M. Though the group&#x27;s initial purpose was simply to lip-synch for TV and discothèque performances of Farian&#x27;s song &quot;Baby Do You Wanna Bump&quot;, Boney M. soon became a legitimate recording group with Mitchell, Marcia Barrett, and producer Farian as the vocal core. Mitchell became widely regarded as Boney M.&#x27;s lead vocalist. She remained with Boney M. until the group disbanded in 1986.

==After Boney M.==
After the group split up shortly after their 10th anniversary in 1986, fellow group member Bobby Farrell convinced Mitchell, Maizie Williams and a replacement for Marcia Barrett to re-group for a tour in 1987. A recording contract for the group was also arranged. When Farrell and the replacement singer failed to show up for the rehearsals, Mitchell and Williams recruited singer Celena Duncan and dancer Curt Dee Daran for the tour. As Williams had never sung on Boney M.&#x27;s recordings, Mitchell ended up recording the scheduled album on her own.

However, it proved difficult for Mitchell to find a record label to release the album, entitled &quot;No One Will Force You&quot;. It was released in Spain in the Autumn of 1988, supported by the singles &quot;Mandela&quot; (a re-work of Boney M.&#x27;s 1979 hit &quot;El Lute&quot;) and &quot;Niños De La Playa&quot; (Children of the Beach). The latter was also released on Mega Records in Scandinavia where the group did a tour in October. By this point, Williams had been replaced by Carol Grey.

At the same time, Simon Napier-Bell had produced a remix album of Boney M.&#x27;s greatest hits and wanted the original line-up to promote it. Mitchell reluctantly accepted the offer and Boney M. appeared together again on German and Dutch TV, even though Mitchell&#x27;s new line-up still had gigs to play.

The success of the remix album led Mitchell to sign her album for a French and Dutch release in 1989, and due to personal differences within the group, she eventually decided to focus on her solo career. Even though Madeleine Davis took her place in the group, Farian eventually called Mitchell back for a second remix album by the end of 1989 and also had her front a new Boney M. line-up for the single, &quot;Stories&quot;, as an answer-back to an unofficial Boney M. single, &quot;Everybody Wants to Dance Like Josephine Baker&quot;, recorded by the other three with Madeleine Davis, without Farian&#x27;s approval.

In 1990, Mitchell re-formed her 1988 line-up with Patricia Foster replacing Celena Duncan and kept touring the cabaret circuit. In April 1991, she released the single &quot;Mocking Bird&quot;, produced by longtime Boney M. collaborator, Helmut Rulofs to minimal attention. After three dire years, the success of Boney M. &quot;Gold - 20 Super Hits&quot; boosted the career of her line-up, entitled &#x27;Boney M. feat. Liz Mitchell&#x27;, and they were officially approved by Farian to promote the album and the accompanying singles. For the follow-up &quot;More Gold - 20 Super Hits Vol. II&quot;, Mitchell recorded four new songs. &quot;No One Will Force You&quot; with two previously unreleased tracks from 1984 was also re-released in Denmark, five years after it was recorded.

In 1996, Mitchell and her husband Thomas Pemberton built the Dove House Studios and formed Dove House Records. With a newly founded fan club, Mitchell recorded an EP with four Christmas songs as a special Christmas gift for her fans.

In November 1999, Mitchell finally released her album &quot;Share the World&quot;, which had taken three years to complete. In November 2000, she released the seasonal album &quot;Christmas Rose&quot; which consisted of partly new material, including the title track, &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; and &quot;I Want to Go to Heaven&quot; co-written by herself, part re-recordings of Boney M.&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Album&quot;.

Mitchell, now a born-again Christian, continued the inspirational path on &quot;Let It Be&quot;, her fourth solo album, released in November 2004. Just a few months later, the album &quot;Liz Mitchell Sings the Hits of Boney M.&quot;, recorded in Prague, backed by a Czech symphony orchestra, was released. A song recorded in 2006, called &quot;A Moment Of Love&quot;, can be found on the compilation album, &quot;The Magic of Boney M.&quot;.

She is still touring, billed as Boney M. featuring Liz Mitchell.

In 2014 a Federation of Reggae Music and Brent Council blue plaque was unveiled at Mitchell&#x27;s childhood home on Wrottesley Road in Harlesden, London, where her father still resided at this time. Mitchell now resides in Caversham, Reading.

Mitchell was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2024 Birthday Honours for services to music and to charity.

<text>Roberto Alfonso Farrell (6 October 1949 – 30 December 2010) was an Aruban dancer, visual performer, singer and DJ. He was a member of the 1970s R&amp;B group Boney M.

== Biography ==
=== Birth and early life ===
Farrell was born and raised on the Caribbean island of Aruba in the Dutch colony of Curaçao and Dependencies (later known as the Netherlands Antilles). He left after finishing school at age 15 and was a sailor for two years before moving to Norway. He then went to the Netherlands, where he found occasional work as a DJ before moving to Germany for better opportunities.

=== Years with Boney M. ===
In Germany, he mostly worked as a DJ, until producer Frank Farian spotted him for his new group, Boney M., and made Farrell the lone male singer in the group. In 1978, however, Farian confirmed existing rumours that Farrell made no vocal contributions to the group&#x27;s records, and Farian had performed the male parts in the studio. Liz Mitchell said it was true; only she, Marcia Barrett and Farian had sung on the hit recordings, adding that Farrell limited himself vocally to &quot;growling&quot; when performing live in some of the various incarnations of Boney M., including the main 1970s incarnation. After Farrell left the group in 1981, due to clashes with Farian, his voice was genuinely recorded for the first time on the double A-side single We Kill the World/Boonoonoonoos. He was replaced by Reggie Tsiboe, while Farrell attempted a solo career; however, he rejoined in 1984 and continued as a member until the final split in 1986. The group didn&#x27;t meet its end due to conflicts of any kind. Farian had simply planned Boney M. as a 10-year project. The German TV show &quot;10 Jahre Boney M.&quot; (10 Years of Boney M.) marked the end of the group.

Farrell&#x27;s daughter Zanillya Farrell says Farian deprived Farrell of any legal right to Boney M.&#x27;s hits, which caused her father to lose all his income after the band split.

When Dad asked Farian for 100,000 marks he was told to sign some papers. He signed away everything – image rights, royalties, the lot. My father lost everything. We had to move in with my grandmother in the Netherlands and live on welfare. After that, Dad started getting angry a lot. But Mum was very smart, and she realised, if you own the &quot;name&quot;, you can use it. Farian hadn&#x27;t registered Boney M. all over the world, so &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; why Dad could perform in certain countries.

In 1988, Farrell and the three original women reunited. Two remix albums were released, and they performed on several television shows. In France, one of their singles reached No. 1. Despite this, the reunion did not last more than a year. Soon after, Farrell started to tour with his own group, performing the band&#x27;s hits under the name Bobby Farrell&#x27;s Boney M.

He appeared as a dancer in the late-2005 Roger Sanchez music video for &quot;Turn on the Music.&quot;

=== Later years and death ===
Farrell lived for many years in Amsterdam, in the neighbourhood of Gaasperdam in the borough of Amsterdam-Zuidoost.

In 1981, he married Macedonian Romani Jasmina Shaban. They had a daughter named Zanillya in 1983, and a son named Zanin. They separated in 1995.

He died on the morning of 30 December 2010, in a hotel room in St. Petersburg, Russia, of heart failure. His agent, John Seine, said Farrell had complained of breathing problems and of a heavier pain in his chest than ever after performing with his band the prior evening. Despite his still present dynamism, he had health problems for a decade. Farrell&#x27;s body was discovered by hotel staff after he failed to respond to a wake-up call. Coincidentally, he died on the same date and in the same city as Grigori Rasputin, the subject of one of his group&#x27;s most iconic songs and whom he had dressed as in some live performances. He was buried at Zorgvlied cemetery in Amsterdam.

== In popular culture ==
In season 6, episode 5 (&quot;Demon 79&quot;) of the television series &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, British actor Paapa Essiedu portrayed Farrell through the character of Gaap, a demon who takes the likeness of Farrell as he appeared on stage in the group Boney M. during a performance of the song &quot;Rasputin&quot;.

<text>Jennifer Anne Lien (born August 24, 1974) is an American former actress known for playing the alien Kes on the television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager.&quot;

== Early life ==
Lien was born on August 24, 1974, in Illinois, the youngest of three children, and joined the Illinois Theatre Center at the age of 13.

In a 1992 interview, she said: &quot;My childhood was wild because I was very uncomfortable living where I lived (the South Side of Chicago). It was very industrial—if you didn&#x27;t fit in, you got your ass kicked. I was just my own person, and I adopted this really tough skin because I had to if I wanted to survive. A lot of my friends were into drugs, and I saw a lot of them die.&quot; In a 1993 interview, she said:
== Career ==
Lien&#x27;s first television appearance was in a bubble gum commercial playing twins. Her first appearance on a television series was as a music academy student in a 1990 episode of &quot;Brewster Place&quot;, starring Oprah Winfrey. The same year she provided her voice for the dubbed English language version of &quot;Baby Blood&quot;, a French horror film. Lien moved to New York in 1991 after she was cast as Hannah Moore on the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. She attended and graduated from the Professional Children&#x27;s School while working on this series.

In a 1992 interview, Lien said: &quot;A couple of years ago, I was trying to get an audition for a baseball movie, so I said that I could play baseball. We&#x27;d always played a lot while I was growing up, like in the backyard. But when I showed up at the audition, I was faced with these Goliath-like, testosterone women who could &quot;really&quot; play. I did survive the two days of training and auditions, but I basically pulled every muscle in my body!&quot;.

In 1993, Lien was cast as Roanne in &quot;Phenom&quot;, a sitcom starring Judith Light. She also participated in the recording of Adam Sandler&#x27;s comedy album &quot;They&#x27;re All Gonna Laugh at You!&quot; in which she played the part of the valedictorian on the track &quot;The Buffoon And The Valedictorian&quot;, as well as one of the daughters on the track &quot;Oh, mom...&quot;
In 1994, Lien was cast as Kes on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. Her character was an Ocampa, a species in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe that lives for only eight to nine years, who joins the starship&#x27;s crew after it is stranded 70,000 light-years from Earth. In the same year, Lien voiced the character Valerie Fox in the pilot episode of &quot;The Critic&quot;.

Richard Lutz wrote, &quot;The medical personnel in &quot;Star Trek&quot; best embody the humane values embedded in this franchise; the most notable of which is Kes, thanks in large part to Jennifer Lien whose remarkable performance brought to life a beautiful child-like being (Ocampa) whose short lifespan and humanity reminds us that the most important element in a life worth living is a loving connection with our fellow human beings.&quot;

The showrunners reluctantly terminated Lien&#x27;s contract as a member of &quot;Voyager&#x27;s&quot; main cast due to unresolved personal issues that affected her performance. In 2000, Lien returned as a guest actor in the episode &quot;Fury&quot;.

After &quot;Voyager&quot;, Lien appeared in the film &quot;American History X&quot; as the younger sister of Edward Norton&#x27;s character. In 1998, she appeared in &quot;SLC Punk!&quot; playing Sandy, the wild girlfriend of Matthew Lillard&#x27;s character. She also voiced Agent &quot;L&quot; for the first three seasons of &quot;Men in Black: The Animated Series&quot; (1997–1999) and the first seven episodes of the 2000 season.

=== Conventions ===
Lien has attended science fiction conventions in relation to her role as Kes when she was working on &quot;Voyager&quot; and after her film career ended. In a 1995 interview, she said about these conventions:

== Personal life ==
Lien is married to writer and filmmaker Phil Hwang; their son was born on September 5, 2002. Upon his birth, Lien retired from acting and voice-over work but was credited as executive producer on her husband&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Geek Mythology&quot;. In August 2010, Lien said she intended to work as a nutritionist after completing her studies.

===Legal issues===
Between 2015 and 2018, Lien was arrested and charged with a variety of offenses; several of these charges were later dropped. The court eventually ordered her to undergo mental health treatment.

<doc id="637901" wikidata="Q893412" url="?curid=637901" title="Border Down">
<text>Border Down is a horizontally scrolling shooter video game developed and published by G.rev. It was released in Japanese arcades in April 2003 on Sega NAOMI hardware, and was ported to the Dreamcast later that year. The story takes place in the future where humans are defending their Mars colony from an invading alien attack. The game employs a &quot;border system&quot; where each stage has three variations of different difficulty. The player starts on the easiest variation, and is lowered to a more difficult variation with each subsequent loss of a life.

Producer Hiroyuki Maruyama was heavily inspired by Taito&#x27;s shooter &quot;Metal Black&quot; (1991) and founded G.rev with ex-Taito employees specifically to develop a shooter of his own. The team of five did subcontract work to gather funding and build their skills programming NAOMI arcade hardware. Among the projects they worked on were Treasure&#x27;s &quot;Ikaruga&quot; (2001) and &quot;Gradius V&quot; (2004). Due to lack of funds, they were not able to realize all the ideas they conceptualized for the game. &quot;Border Down&quot; was released to mixed reception, but was commercially successful and continues to maintain a steady interest from shooter fans. G.rev went on to make other shoot &#x27;em ups including &quot;&quot; and &quot;Under Defeat&quot;.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Border Down&quot; is a side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up set in a futuristic setting. Centuries after humans have colonized Mars, hostile aliens begin attacking the planet. The Mars defense force mobilizes and launch a new type of unmanned aircraft. The player takes on the role of a pilot, controlling the aircraft through a remote control interface. The game&#x27;s name is derived from its &quot;border system&quot;. Each stage has three parallel variations, or &quot;borders&quot; of varying difficulty. The player starts on the easiest border (&quot;green&quot;), and if they lose a life, drop to &quot;yellow&quot;, and then finally the difficult &quot;red&quot; border. If the player loses a life in the red border, it is game over, though a continue option can be unlocked through repeated play. Each border is slightly different from the others, usually featuring other enemies and modified stage layouts and backgrounds. The final stage and ending are determined by the amount of time spent in each border during a playthrough. The Dreamcast version also features a &quot;Remix mode&quot; with new enemy attack patterns.

The ship&#x27;s main weapon can either be fired as a continuous barrage of bullets by holding down the fire button, or as a set of homing missiles by tapping it. A power meter slowly fills up over time which determines the strength of the ship&#x27;s weaponry. It can also be boosted by destroying enemies. This meter can also power a secondary laser attack, which has an additional function of canceling out any boss attack, reflecting it back at them. Using the laser comes at a cost, as it drains the meter and therefore weakens the main weapon.

==Development==
&quot;Border Down&quot; was developed and published by G.rev, a team founded by producer Hiroyuki Maruyama with the explicit purpose to develop a shoot &#x27;em up. The team consisted of five ex-Taito employees: three programmers, one designer, and Maruyama himself. After founding the company in July 2000, he first needed to build capital and give his team an opportunity to learn the skills and techniques to develop a shooter. They were able to gather most of the funds through producing their first game, &quot;Doki Doki Idol Star Seeker&quot; (2001), a puzzle game for the Sega&#x27;s NAOMI arcade board. The remaining amount was accumulated through freelance work, including subcontract work with Treasure on two shooters, &quot;Ikaruga&quot; (2001) and &quot;Gradius V&quot; (2004). &quot;Ikaruga&quot; gave G.rev the key experience of programming for NAOMI hardware.

The initial concept for &quot;Border Down&quot; took root with Maruyama before he founded G.rev. He was heavily inspired by Taito&#x27;s shooter &quot;Metal Black&quot; (1991), specifically the game&#x27;s &quot;Beam Level&quot; system. He also borrowed ideas from his experiences with producing &quot;G-Darius&quot; (1997) with Taito, particularly the game&#x27;s branching level system which inspired the border system in &quot;Border Down&quot;. With a parallel world system like this, the team would not need to develop as many distinct levels. This was one of the few parts of his original concept that was kept in the final game. For visual inspiration, Maruyama pulled from Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Red Mars&quot;. The music was composed by Yasuhisa Watanabe, who also composed the music to &quot;Metal Black&quot; and was the only member of the staff who had worked on the 1991 shooter.

The team had to cut a significant amount of material due to lack of funds. In particular Maruyama wanted to flesh out the ending and opening cinematics. They also had plans for more visual flair, including background details and explosion effects, but had to cut about a third of these ideas because of the NAOMI&#x27;s graphical limitations. They commissioned help for extra sound and design work. In Game One″s 2006 French TV documentary &quot;Japon: Histoire du Shooting Game&quot;, Maruyama said that all he wanted was to make &quot;Border Down&quot; and would have been happy if G.rev collapsed afterwards.

== Release ==
&quot;Border Down&quot; was released in Japanese arcades on 25 April 2003. It was common for NAOMI shooters to be ported to Sega&#x27;s home console, the Dreamcast, making a significant portion of the aging console&#x27;s extended output. Sega had effectively ceased support for the system in the west by this time, but some support remained in Japan. Although a Dreamcast conversion would seem like an obvious choice with it being a NAOMI game, G.rev spent time considering which console was most suitable for a home port. They decided against the PlayStation 2 because the game would have needed a complete rebuild from the ground up. As for the GameCube, they believed &quot;Border Down&quot; was not suited for the system&#x27;s audience. With these factors, along with the ease of porting NAOMI games to the Dreamcast, they chose Sega&#x27;s home console. According to &quot;Edge&quot; and &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot;, a fan petition for a Dreamcast port was another factor. The simplicity of the porting process left G.rev with more time to add the Remix mode.

The Dreamcast port was released a few months after the arcade version, on 25 September 2003. If bought through Sega Direct, the game came with a &quot;Border Down&quot; branded mouse pad. In addition to the standard version, 3000 limited edition copies were produced that came bundled with the soundtrack. The soundtrack contains tracks not included in the original game, and was also sold separately. Maruyama was prepared to fold G.rev if &quot;Border Down&quot; was not successful, but the number of customer orders at launch exceeded G.rev and Sega&#x27;s expectations, so they continued producing new copies until they felt demand was met.

&quot;Border Down&quot; has seen continued interest post-release. A second volume to the soundtrack was released on 13 May 2004 through Sega Direct, containing tracks from the Remix mode and an original track by Watanabe. By 2007, Japanese retailer Messe Sanoh was still seeing demand for the game, and so requested Sega and G.rev for another production run. Their request was granted; a second run was produced and sold exclusively through Messe Sanoh retailers beginning on 17 January 2008. Both production runs included, less than 20,000 copies were sold. It has since become one of the most coveted Japanese exclusives for Dreamcast collectors. In 2011, Maruyama said that he would consider rereleasing &quot;Border Down&quot; or his 2005 game &quot;Under Defeat&quot; on modern platforms. &quot;Under Defeat&quot; was rereleased in 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. A resin kit for the player ship from &quot;Border Down&quot; was released in February 2013.

==Reception==
Initial reactions to the arcade release were mixed. Maruyama recalled: &quot;It&#x27;s a really individualistic type of game, so when we first released it [in the arcades] it received both positive and negative reactions&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; gave the Dreamcast version a 6 out of 10, feeling that the game had all the ingredients to be an outstanding shooter, but lacked the energy to push it to that next level. They explained that &quot;Border Down&quot; lacked the intensity to frighten players, and felt that good shooters need that type of panic inducing gameplay.

In retrospect, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called &quot;Border Down&quot; &quot;arguably [G.rev&#x27;s] best game&quot;, among the likes of &quot;&quot; and &quot;Under Defeat&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; called it one of the highest regarded late-era releases for the Dreamcast. Kurt Kalata of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; wrote that the game remains popular with hardcore shoot &#x27;em up fans, but found it hard to recommend given its high price tag within secondary markets. &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; believed it to be the best horizontal shooter for the Dreamcast. Kalata and &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; agreed that the game had excellent replayability due to the border and scoring systems. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; thought the graphics were good for the game&#x27;s limited budget, and &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; agreed, but Kalata believed they were bland outside of some interesting backgrounds. Regarding the music, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; wrote that it was &quot;strong enough to stand on its own&quot;, while Kalata and &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; felt it was strange synth and techno jazz. Kalata felt gameplay similarities to the &quot;Darius&quot; series, while &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; called it a great mix of classic style shooters like &quot;R-Type&quot; and more modern manic shooters.

<text>Tretinoin, also known as all-&quot;trans&quot; retinoic acid (ATRA), is a medication used for the treatment of acne and acute promyelocytic leukemia. For acne, it is applied to the skin as a cream, gel or ointment. For acute promyelocytic leukemia, it is effective only when the RARA-PML fusion mutation is present and is taken by mouth for up to three months. Topical tretinoin is also the most extensively investigated retinoid therapy for photoaging.
Common side effects when used as a cream are limited to the skin and include skin redness, peeling, and sun sensitivity. When taken by mouth, side effects include hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, shortness of breath, headache, numbness, depression, skin dryness, itchiness, hair loss, vomiting, muscle pains, and vision changes. Other severe side effects include high white blood cell counts and blood clots. Use during pregnancy is contraindicated due to the risk of birth defects. It is in the retinoid family of medications.
Tretinoin was patented in 1957 and approved for medical use in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Tretinoin is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 238th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==

=== Skin use ===
==== Acne ====
Tretinoin is most commonly used to treat acne, both inflammatory and noninflammatory. Multiple studies support the efficacy of topical retinoids in the treatment of acne vulgaris. It is sometimes used in conjunction with other topical acne medications to enhance their penetration. In addition to treating active acne, retinoids accelerate the resolution of acne-induced postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. It is also useful as maintenance therapy for people who have responded well to their initial treatment, reducing the prolonged use of antibiotics for acne.

==== Photoaging ====
Photoaging is premature skin aging resulting from prolonged and repeated exposure to solar radiation. Features of photoaging include fine and coarse wrinkles, changes in skin pigmentation, and loss of elasticity. In human skin, topical retinoids increase collagen production, induce epidermal hyperplasia, and decrease keratinocyte and melanocyte atypia. Topical tretinoin is the most extensively investigated retinoid therapy for photoaging. Topical tretinoin can be used for mild to severe photoaging in people of all skin types. Several weeks or months of use are typically required before improvement is appreciated. Although it has only been studied for up to two years, it may be continued indefinitely. A long-term maintenance regimen with a lower concentration or less frequent application may be an alternative to continued use.

=== Leukemia ===
Tretinoin is used to induce remission in people with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who have a mutation (the t(15;17) translocation that gives rise to the PML::RARα fusion gene). It is not used for maintenance therapy.

Tretinoin is not effective for the treatment of non-APL forms of Acute Myeloid Leukemia or other forms of leukemia. Preclinical studies and clinical data analysis suggest that retinoic acid promotes the growth of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

== Side effects ==

=== Dermatology ===
Topical tretinoin is for use only on the skin and should not be applied to eyes or mucosal tissues. Common side effects include skin irritation, redness, swelling, and blistering. If irritation is a problem, a decrease in the frequency of application to every other or every third night can be considered, and the frequency of application can be increased as tolerance improves. The fine skin flaking that is often seen can be gently exfoliated with a washcloth. A non-comedogenic facial moisturizer can also be applied if needed. Delaying the application of the retinoid for at least 20 minutes after washing and drying the face may also be helpful. Topical retinoids are not true photosensitizing drugs, but people using topical retinoids have described symptoms of increased sun sensitivity. This is thought to be due to the thinning of the stratum corneum leading to a decreased barrier against ultraviolet light exposure, as well as an enhanced sensitivity due to the presence of cutaneous irritation.

=== Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia ===
The oral form of the drug has boxed warnings concerning the risks of retinoic acid syndrome and leukocytosis. Other significant side effects include a risk of thrombosis, benign intracranial hypertension in children, high lipids (hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia), and liver damage.

There are many significant side effects from this drug that include malaise (66%), shivering (63%), hemorrhage (60%), infections (58%), peripheral edema (52%), pain (37%), chest discomfort (32%), edema (29%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (26%), weight increase (23%), injection site reactions (17%), anorexia (17%), weight decrease (17%), and myalgia (14%).

Respiratory side effects usually signify retinoic acid syndrome, and include upper respiratory tract disorders (63%), dyspnea (60%), respiratory insufficiency (26%), pleural effusion (20%), pneumonia (14%), rales (14%), and expiratory wheezing (14%), and many others at less than 10%. Around 23% of people taking the drug have reported earache or a feeling of fullness in their ears. Gastrointestinal disorders include bleeding (34%), abdominal pain (31%), diarrhea (23%), constipation (17%), dyspepsia (14%), and swollen belly (11%) and many others at less than 10%.

Cardiovascular side effects include arrhythmias (23%), flushing (23%), hypotension (14%), hypertension (11%), phlebitis (11%), and cardiac failure (6%) and for 3% of patients: cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, enlarged heart, heart murmur, ischemia, stroke, myocarditis, pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension, secondary cardiomyopathy.

In the nervous system, side effects include dizziness (20%), paresthesias (17%), anxiety (17%), insomnia (14%), depression (14%), confusion (11%), and many others at less than 10% frequency.

In the urinary system, side effects include chronic kidney disease (11%) and several others at less than 10% frequency.

== Mechanism of action ==
For its use in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia, tretinoin causes the RARA:PML fusion oncogene to degrade, resulting in the loss of the key driver oncogene. This degradation allows the blasts to mature and results in dramatic responses. This response is typically short-lived as Cyp26 genes are rapidly upregulated to degrade tretinoin. The RARA:PML oncogene is not present in other cancer types, thus explaining why tretinoin and other retinoids have not been effective across hundreds of different trials.

For its use in acne, tretinoin (along with other retinoids) are vitamin A derivatives that act by binding to two nuclear receptor families within keratinocytes: the retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and the retinoid X receptors (RXR). These events contribute to the normalization of follicular keratinization and decreased cohesiveness of keratinocytes, resulting in reduced follicular occlusion and microcomedone formation. The retinoid-receptor complex competes for coactivator proteins of AP-1, a key transcription factor involved in inflammation. Retinoids also down-regulate expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, which has been implicated in the inflammatory response in acne. Moreover, tretinoin and retinoids may enhance the penetration of other topical acne medications.

The combination of the 10% benzoyl peroxide and light results in more than 50% degradation of tretinoin in about 2 hours and 95% in 24 hours. This lack of stability in the presence of light and oxidizing agents has led to the development of novel formulations of the drug. When microencapsulated tretinoin is exposed to benzoyl peroxide and light only 1% degradation takes place in about 4 hours and only 13% after 24 hours.

The biological mechanism behind triglyceride and cholesterol elevations remains under investigation.

== Synthesis ==

All-trans retinoic acid is produced by the body from dietary factors including retinol, retinyl esters or beta-carotene. The beta-carotene is first cleaved by beta-carotene 15-15&#x27;-monooxygenase to retinol which is subsequently oxidized by RDH and ALDH enzymes to produce all-trans retinoic acid (see retinoic acid). Tretinoin is produced synthetically using standard industrial practices.

== History ==
Tretinoin was co-developed for its use in acne by James Fulton and Albert Kligman when they were at University of Pennsylvania in the 1960s. Phase I trials, the first conducted on human subjects, were performed on inmates at Holmesburg Prison during a long-running regime of non-therapeutic testing on prison inmates at Holmesburg. The University of Pennsylvania held the patent for Retin-A, which it licensed to pharmaceutical companies.

Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia was first introduced at Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai by Wang Zhenyi in a 1988 clinical trial.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name &quot;tretinoin&quot; is uncertain, although several sources agree (one with probability,&lt; one with asserted certainty) that it probably comes from &quot;-&quot; + &quot; [acid]&quot; + &quot;&quot;, which is plausible given that tretinoin is the all-trans isomer of retinoic acid. The name &quot;isotretinoin&quot; is the same root &quot;tretinoin&quot; plus the prefix &quot;-&quot;. Regarding pronunciation, the following variants apply equally to both &quot;tretinoin&quot; and &quot;isotretinoin&quot;. Given that &quot;retinoic&quot; is pronounced , it is natural that is a commonly heard pronunciation. Dictionary transcriptions also include () and .

== Hair loss ==
Tretinoin has been explored as a treatment for hair loss, potentially as a way to increase the ability of minoxidil (by acting as an enzyme and accelerating the production of minoxidil sulfate) to penetrate the scalp, but the evidence is weak and contradictory.

<text>&quot;Ma Baker&quot; is a song by disco group Boney M., released as a single in 1977. It was the first single of their second album &quot;Love for Sale&quot; and their third consecutive chart-topper in Germany.

The song was a huge success in Europe and Latin America, topping the charts in many countries there. It was a number 2 hit in the UK (only surpassed by Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Love&quot;). In the US, the song only reached number 96.

==Composition and structure==
Frank Farian&#x27;s assistant Hans-Jörg Mayer discovered a popular Tunisian folkloric song, &quot;Sidi Mansour&quot; while on holiday, and rewrote the song into a disco track.

The lyrics by Fred Jay were inspired by the told story of legendary 1930s US outlaw Ma Barker, although the name was changed into &quot;Ma Baker&quot; because &quot;it sounded better&quot;. 

The story of Ma Barker is controversial, and many details on the song are based on what was told at the time, instead of recorded history. Some differences are the fact there are no records that she introduced any of her sons to crime (the opposite is more probable), and only one of them died with her. Similarly, their death didn&#x27;t happen during a bank robbery; instead, they were found in a vacation house and died on a day-long shootout with the FBI.

With a structure similar to Boney M.&#x27;s breakthrough single &quot;Daddy Cool&quot;, using the same gimmick percussion, alternating answer-back vocals, and a spoken mid-part, the song opened with a snarling &quot;Freeze, I&#x27;m Ma Baker, put your hands in the air and gimme all your money&quot;. Although it has never been officially credited, the voice was that of Linda Blake, the wife of Frank Farian&#x27;s American friend Bill Swisher, who was a soldier in Germany at the time. Bill Swisher performed the spoken mid-part, announcing a bulletin from the FBI. He was used on several later Boney M. recordings, including &quot;Rasputin&quot; and &quot;El Lute&quot;.

Farian re-recorded the song with Milli Vanilli in 1988, and reused both spoken voiceovers from the original song in the cover. Boney M.&#x27;s version was remixed the same year, 1993 and again in 1998. The song has been covered a number of times, including Banda R-15 and Knorkator. The &quot;ma ma ma ma&quot; chorus vocals were also sampled in Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Poker Face&quot;.

==1993 remix==
Following the remix of &quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot;, Farian remixed &quot;Ma Baker&quot; in 1993. While a modest club hit, it failed to enter the European charts. &quot;Borsalino&quot; and &quot;The Most Wanted Woman&quot; are two dub mixes of the track. The new remix was included in the compilation album &quot;More Gold - 20 Super Hits Vol. II&quot;.

In 1998, a new remix of &quot;Ma Baker&quot; by Sash! started to chart as a 12&quot; single. Just as the CD-single was about to follow, it was withdrawn, and a new version appeared, re-titled &quot;Somebody Scream! Ma Baker&quot; featuring Horny United. The single was a Top 30 hit in Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and even peaked at no. 6 (two weeks) in Finland and no. 10 in Sweden. When released in the UK in April, it peaked at no. 22. The accompanying video featured a young woman, kickboxing, training with a gun, the only relation to the original group being her watching the original 1977 video of &quot;Ma Baker&quot; on a TV set.

<text>Maladjusted is the sixth studio album by English singer Morrissey, released on 11 August 1997 by Island Records.

On release, the album received a lukewarm reception from fans and critics alike, and was Morrissey&#x27;s last studio album for seven years, until 2004&#x27;s &quot;You Are the Quarry&quot;.

==Content==
&quot;Maladjusted&quot; was Morrissey&#x27;s attempt to integrate the torch songs that he experimented with on &quot;Vauxhall and I&quot; with the indie rock of his earlier career. In addition to &quot;Alma Matters&quot;, the tracks &quot;Trouble Loves Me&quot;, &quot;Ammunition&quot; and &quot;Wide to Receive&quot; stand out as reminiscent of the &quot;Vauxhall and I&quot; era.

The album caused a small amount of controversy over what was to be the penultimate track. Entitled &quot;Sorrow Will Come in the End&quot;, it featured Morrissey intoning, rather than singing, over a backing of manic strings and the beat of a judge&#x27;s gavel. The song is clearly about the Mike Joyce royalties dispute, and lyrically takes the form of, essentially, an extended threatening message to him and his representatives. &quot;Don&#x27;t close your eyes/Don&#x27;t ever close your eyes/A man who slits throats/Has time on his hands/And I&#x27;m gonna get you&quot;. Island Records, Morrissey&#x27;s label at the time, dropped the track from UK versions of the album for fear of libel action. Joyce, for his part, said of the song, &quot;I just found it funny. If Lemmy had written it, I might be concerned.&quot;

On the inside sleeve of the LP is printed &quot;John Bindon 1943–1993&quot;, a reference to the English actor and bodyguard who had close links with the London underworld.

==Release==
Morrissey released &quot;Alma Matters&quot; on 21 July 1997 to support the album. The song premiered on the KROQ-FM Jed the Fish show on 4 July 1997.

&quot;Maladjusted&quot; was released on 11 August 1997 by record label Island. The follow-up singles &quot;Roy&#x27;s Keen&quot; and &quot;Satan Rejected My Soul&quot; peaked at numbers 42 and 39, respectively.

Island Records released a remastered and redesigned version of &quot;Maladjusted&quot; on 4 May 2009. It included a new album cover and track listing, several rare B-sides and the first UK release of &quot;Sorrow Will Come in the End&quot;. However, two songs (&quot;Roy&#x27;s Keen&quot; and &quot;Papa Jack&quot;) were left off the new track list. In the initial press release, &quot;Ambitious Outsiders&quot; was incorrectly listed as &quot;Ambitious Lovers&quot;. It was released on the Polydor label.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Maladjusted&quot; received a mixed-to-unfavourable response from critics.

Matt Hendrickson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;despite his predictability, &quot;Maladjusted&quot; is Morrissey&#x27;s strongest musical effort since his 1988 solo debut, &quot;Viva Hate&quot;.&quot;

<text>Weber State University (pronounced ) is a public university in Ogden, Utah, United States. It was founded in 1889 as Weber Stake Academy and earned its current name in 1991.

As of fall 2023, the student population reached 30,536 students, consisting of 16,020 undergraduate students, 1,002 graduate students and 13,514 concurrent enrollment students, making it the third-largest public university in the state. Weber State University has over 225 degree programs and seven colleges, including the Dr. Ezekiel R. Dumke College of Health Professions and the College of Engineering, Applied Science &amp; Technology. Weber State is regionally accredited through the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, and many programs are accredited through national organizations.

As of fall 2023, students who identify as Hispanic or Latino make up 13% of the full-time equivalent undergraduate student body. The university is working to become an emerging Hispanic-Serving Institution, a designation given when 15% of students identify as Hispanic or Latino. The university&#x27;s athletic teams, the Wildcats, compete in the Big Sky Conference as an NCAA Division I institution.

== History ==
Weber State University was founded by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the Weber Stake Academy in 1889. &quot;Weber&quot; comes from the name of the county where the university is located. Weber County was named after John Henry Weber, an early fur trader. The university opened for students in 1889 with 98 students enrolled for classes The first principal of Weber Stake Academy was Louis F. Moench; he served from 1889 to 1892 and again from 1894 to 1902. In the latter year, Moench was succeeded as principal by David O. McKay, who served in that position until 1908. From 1914 to 1917, James L. Barker was the principal of the Weber Stake Academy.

In the early 20th century, the school underwent multiple name changes: Weber Stake Academy from its founding in 1889, Weber Academy in 1902, Weber Normal College in 1918, and Weber College in 1922. By the late 1920s, however, the college was in financial difficulty, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints faced four choices—transfer the college to a partnership of the city of Ogden and Weber County, transfer it to the University of Utah as a branch campus, transfer it to the state of Utah as a junior college, or shut it down. In 1931, the Utah Legislature passed a law providing for the acquisition of Weber College and Snow College from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In 1933, Weber College became a state-supported junior college. In 1954, the college moved from its downtown location in Ogden to a spacious and scenic area in the southeast bench area of the city. The school became Weber State College in 1962, and in 1964 became a four-year college. It was a charter member of the Big Sky Conference The first graduate program (accounting), was added and it gained university status on

<doc id="637927" wikidata="Q3992952" url="?curid=637927" title="Tompkinsville, Staten Island">
<text>Tompkinsville is a neighborhood in northeastern Staten Island in New York City. Named for Daniel D. Tompkins, sixth Vice President of the United States (1817–1825), the neighborhood sits on the island&#x27;s eastern shore, along the waterfront facing Upper New York Bay, between St. George on the north and Stapleton on the south; however, it is considered part of the North Shore by the island&#x27;s residents.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Tompkinsville, located in the Town of Castleton, was the site where early European explorers replenished their fresh water supplies and was known in colonial times as the &quot;Watering Place&quot;. It was opposite the Watering Place that the then largest British expeditionary force, with 450 ships and 32,000 soldiers, arrived in Upper New York Bay and landed in advance of the American Revolutionary War. In 1799, the New York state government took along the waterfront, upon which it established the New York Marine Hospital (also &quot;The Quarantine&quot;), a contagious disease hospital and quarantine station.

In 1815, a settlement was established by New York state governor, Daniel D. Tompkins, in the neighborhood next to the hospital. He was elected Vice President the following year. In 1817 Tompkins built a dock at the foot of present-day Victory Boulevard and began offering steam ferry service to Manhattan. Angry residents burned down the Quarantine in 1858 in a series of attacks known as the Staten Island Quarantine War. Although there were no deaths as a result of the attack, the arsonists completely destroyed the hospital compound.

=== 20th century ===

In the early 1900s, the telephone exchange that served Staten Island&#x27;s eastern North Shore was named after the neighborhood; the name of this exchange was changed to &quot;Saint George&quot; in the mid-1920s, and to &quot;Saint George 7&quot; when New York Telephone upgraded telephone service throughout New York City in December 1930. Converted for All-Number Calling, &quot;727&quot; still exists on the island today. It is the sole surviving number of the designations of the 1920s.

Tompkinsville was the site of a Naval Frontier Base of the US Navy for many years. The base was particularly active during the US engagement with World War I. On July 8, 1919, a delegation consisting of Vice President Thomas R. Marshall; Josephus Daniels, the Secretary of the Navy; Carter Glass, the Secretary of the Treasury; William B. Wilson, the Secretary of Labor; Newton D. Baker, the Secretary of War; Franklin K. Lane, the Secretary of the Interior; and Senator Champ Clark came aboard the USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) for a cruise back to New York with President Wilson.

The Lyons Pool Recreation Center, one of several public swimming pools built as part of a Works Progress Administration project, opened in Tompkinsville in 1936. During World War II, it was designated Tompkinsville, SI, New York.

=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century, Tompkinsville became a racially mixed area, and a little Sri Lanka had developed. There is also a large population of Italian-Americans, African Americans and Mexicans. In 2014, black Staten Island resident Eric Garner was killed by police in Tompkinsville, in an incident that received widespread media coverage.

In 2019, the section of Bay Street in Tompkinsville was rezoned to allow for a higher concentration of residential, commercial, and office space along the street. The plan was controversial, as the vast majority of Staten Island Community Board 1 members had rejected the plan, as did many residents of Tompkinsville, and the commissioners of the New York City Planning Commission had mixed opinions.

== Culture ==

Tompkinsville contains an enclave of Sri Lankans. The neighborhood also hosts a number of live music and art venues, including Everything Goes Book Café, Deep Tanks Studio, Coyle Cavern, Ink Chyx Tattoo &amp; Art Gallery, and the Staten Island LGBT Community Center, all of which take part in the north shore&#x27;s monthly Second Saturday art walk. As with much of the north shore, the area is decidedly more urban than is typical of Staten Island, evinced in the architecture (predominantly tall brick buildings) and numerous retail stores and eateries. Unlike many other North Shore communities (and like Port Richmond), the neighborhood has no public housing projects. Its housing stock is dominated by single-family homes built in the first few decades of the 20th century.

== Demographics ==

The neighborhood is mixed commercial and residential. Like many areas of the northeastern part of the island, it suffered a decline following the construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 1964, which shifted the commercial activity of the island towards its interior. Recent plans have called for the redevelopment of the harbor front area. The population is racially diverse, primarily made up of African-Americans, Hispanics, and Whites, with recent arrivals including immigrants from such countries as Albania. Tompkinsville also contains a Little Sri Lanka, one of the largest Sri Lankan communities outside of the country of Sri Lanka itself.

== Transportation ==

The Tompkinsville station of the Staten Island Railway is one stop south of the terminus at St. George. Unlike at the majority of the railway&#x27;s stations, a MetroCard or OMNY must be used to enter or exit at Tompkinsville. Faregates were installed at the station in 2009 to deter fare avoiders who would exit at the station to avoid paying the fare at St. George.

<text>Peter Rabbit is a fictional animal character in various children&#x27;s stories by English author Beatrix Potter. A mischievous, adventurous young rabbit who wears a blue jacket, he first appeared in &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; in 1902, and subsequently in five more books between 1904 and 1912. The six books by Potter featuring Peter Rabbit have sold over 150 million copies. Spin-off merchandise includes dishes, wallpaper, painting books, board games and dolls. In 1903, Peter Rabbit was the first fictional character to be made into a patented stuffed toy, making him the oldest licensed character. 

Peter Rabbit appears as a character in several adaptations, including the television series &quot;The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends&quot; (1992–1998) and &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; (2012–2016), and the live-action/animated films &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; (2018) and &quot;Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway&quot; (2021).

== Background ==
The rabbits in Potter&#x27;s stories are anthropomorphic and wear human clothes: Peter wears a blue jacket with brass buttons and shoes. Peter, his widowed mother, Mrs. Rabbit, as well as his younger sisters, Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail (with Peter the eldest of the four little rabbits) live in a rabbit hole that has a human kitchen, human furniture, as well as a shop where Mrs. Rabbit sells various items. Peter&#x27;s relatives are his cousin Benjamin Bunny and Benjamin&#x27;s father, Mr. Benjamin Bouncer.

Peter Rabbit was named after a pet rabbit whom Beatrix Potter had as a child, and whom she called Peter Piper. The first Peter Rabbit story, &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, was created in 1893 initially as a letter to Noel Moore, the five-year-old son of Potter&#x27;s former governess, Annie Moore. The boy was ill, and Potter wrote him a picture and story letter to help him pass the time and to cheer him up. The letter included sketches illustrating the narrative.

In June 1903, a trade edition of the tale was published by Frederick Warne &amp; Co, and by the end of the year, 28,000 copies were in print. Over the years, &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, and as of 2008, the Peter Rabbit series of six books has sold more than 150 million copies in 35 languages.

== Books ==
Peter Rabbit made his first appearance in 1902 in &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; where Peter disobeys his mother&#x27;s orders and sneaks into Mr. McGregor&#x27;s garden (where his father had once had &quot;an accident&quot; involving his being put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor). He eats as many vegetables as he can before Mr. McGregor spots and chases him. Peter manages to escape, but not before losing his jacket and shoes, which Mr. McGregor uses to dress a scarecrow. Peter returns home weary, ill, and naked and is put to bed with a dose of chamomile tea.

In &quot;The Tale of Benjamin Bunny&quot;, first published in 1904, Peter&#x27;s cousin Benjamin Bunny brings him back to Mr. McGregor&#x27;s garden and they retrieve the clothes Peter lost in &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;. However, after they gather onions to give to Peter&#x27;s mother, they are captured by Mr. McGregor&#x27;s cat. Bouncer arrives and rescues them, but also punishes Peter and Benjamin for going into the garden by whipping them with a switch. In this tale, Peter displays some trepidation about returning to the garden.

In &quot;The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies&quot;, first published in 1909, Peter has a small role and appears only briefly. He is grown up and his sister Flopsy is now married to their cousin Benjamin. The two are the parents of six little Flopsy Bunnies. Peter and his mother keep a nursery garden, and the bunnies come by asking him for spare cabbage.

In &quot;The Tale of Mr. Tod&quot;, first published in 1912, Benjamin and Flopsy&#x27;s children are kidnapped by notorious badger Tommy Brock. Peter helps Benjamin chase after Brock, who hides out in the house of the fox, Mr. Tod. Mr. Tod finds Brock sleeping in his bed, and as the two get into a scuffle, Peter and Benjamin rescue the children.

Peter makes cameo appearances in two other tales. In &quot;The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle&quot;, first published in 1905, Peter and Benjamin are customers of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, a hedgehog washerwoman. The two rabbits are depicted in one illustration peeping from the forest foliage. In &quot;The Tale of Ginger and Pickles&quot;, first published in 1909, Peter and other characters from Potter&#x27;s previous stories make cameo appearances in the artwork, patronising the shop of Ginger and Pickles.

To mark the 110th anniversary of the publication of &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, Frederick Warne &amp; Co. commissioned British actress Emma Thompson to write &quot;The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, in which Peter ends up in Scotland after accidentally hitching a ride on Mr. and Mrs. McGregor&#x27;s wagon. The book was released on September 18, 2012. In autumn 2012, it was reported that Thompson would write more Peter Rabbit books. Her next tale, &quot;The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, was released in 2013, followed by &quot;The Spectacular Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; in 2014.

On 27 May 2021, a reboot of Peter Rabbit was released, entitled &quot;Peter Rabbit Head Over Tail&quot;, written by Rachel Bright and illustrated by Nicola Kinnear, followed by &quot;Peter Rabbit Hide and Seek&quot; in 2022, then is &quot;Peter Rabbit Up and Away&quot; in 2024.

== Merchandising ==

Potter created a soft doll depicting Peter Rabbit and a Peter Rabbit board game shortly after the tale&#x27;s first publication. The character has been depicted in a multitude of spinoff merchandise such as porcelain figurines, painting books and dishes. 

Peter Rabbit was the first soft toy to be patented, in 1903, making Peter the oldest licensed character. The following year they went on sale and were mass produced by Steiff. Harrods department store in London has been selling it since at least 1910, when toys of Potter characters first appeared in their catalogues. The British publisher Frederick Warne &amp; Co owns the trademark rights of the Beatrix Potter characters. 

The Peter Rabbit (rather than other Beatrix Potter characters) stories and merchandise are very popular in Japan: many Japanese tourists visit the Lake District after becoming familiar with Potter&#x27;s work at an early age at school. There is an accurate replica of Potter&#x27;s house and a theme park in Japan, and a series of Mr. McGregor&#x27;s gardens in one of the largest banks. Merchandisers in Japan estimate that 80% of the population have heard of Peter Rabbit.

== Commemoration ==
A statue of Peter Rabbit is located on the grounds of Lingholm country house just outside the village of Portinscale in the Lake District, north west England, where Potter spent her summer holidays (between 1885 and 1907) and where she drew inspiration for her Peter Rabbit books. She credited the Lingholm kitchen garden as her original inspiration for Mr. McGregor&#x27;s garden in &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;. Lingholm was listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England in 2013.

In 2016, Peter Rabbit and other Potter characters featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Beatrix Potter&#x27;s birth. The same year, Peter Rabbit and other Potter characters appeared on a small number of collectors&#x27; 50p British coins.

== Adaptations ==
In 1936, Walt Disney expressed interest in making a &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; film. He proposed his idea of a feature-length film to Beatrix Potter, but she refused and did not give him the rights.

Peter Rabbit appears in the 1971 ballet film, &quot;The Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot;. He also was featured in HBO&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Storybook Musical&quot; adaptation of &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, narrated by Carol Burnett. Several of the stories featuring Peter Rabbit were also animated for the 1992 BBC anthology series, &quot;The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends&quot; and two edutainment titles published by Mindscape &quot;The Adventures of Peter Rabbit &amp; Benjamin Bunny&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Beatrix Potter: Peter Rabbit&#x27;s Math Garden&quot; in 1996. An animated children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; premiered on Nickelodeon and CBeebies in December 2012, with Colin DePaula voicing Peter in its first season (American version) and L. Parker Lucas taking over the role for the second season, respectively.

An animated/live-action adaptation, &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; produced by Sony Pictures Animation, was released on 8 February 2018. James Corden voices Peter Rabbit with Domhnall Gleeson and Rose Byrne starring in the live-action role of the lead female named Bea (based on Potter herself). Other cast members include Margot Robbie, Daisy Ridley and Elizabeth Debicki. Will Gluck directed and produced the film, and Zareh Nalbandian also produced, while Lauren Abrahams oversaw the project for Sony Pictures Animation. A sequel &quot;Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway&quot; (2021) reunited most of the cast of the previous film.

<doc id="637946" wikidata="Q6643305" url="?curid=637946" title="List of things named after Ronald Reagan">
<text>Ronald Reagan (1911–2004) was an American politician who served as the 40th president of the United States. Many places both within and outside the United States have been named after Reagan.

The &quot;Ronald Reagan Legacy Project&quot; is an organization founded by Americans for Tax Reform, president Grover Norquist seeks to name at least one notable public landmark in each U.S. state and all 3067 counties after Reagan. The &quot;Ronald Reagan Legacy Project&quot;&#x27;s most prominent achievement would be persuading the U.S. Congress to pass a law renaming Washington National Airport as Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in 1998.

Ronald Reagan Boulevard in Warwick, New York built and dedicated in 1981 by real estate developer Frank J. Fazio was the first road to be named after Reagan. The first highway to be named after Reagan was Ronald Reagan Cross County Highway in Cincinnati.

<doc id="637948" wikidata="Q2959094" url="?curid=637948" title="Charles Foster Kane">
<text>Charles Foster Kane is a fictional character who is the subject of Orson Welles&#x27; 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Welles played Kane (receiving an Academy Award nomination), with Buddy Swan playing Kane as a child. Welles also produced, co-wrote and directed the film, winning an Oscar for writing the film.

==Inspiration==
The general consensus is that publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst is the primary inspiration behind Charles Foster Kane.

In the film, Kane is given the line &quot;You provide the prose poems; I&#x27;ll provide the war,&quot; undeniably similar to &quot;You furnish the pictures, and I&#x27;ll furnish the war,&quot; a quotation widely attributed to Hearst. Also, an overhead shot of Hearst&#x27;s ranch is shown in the film as Xanadu, the lavish estate where Kane resides.

In addition, Kane&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to make his second wife an opera star parallels Hearst&#x27;s effort to make his mistress Marion Davies a serious dramatic movie actress despite critics&#x27; complaints that she was miscast and better in light comedy roles. The connection with Hearst is strengthened by the fact that Welles&#x27;s co-writer, Herman J. Mankiewicz, was a frequent guest of Davies at Hearst Castle.

Some biographies of Welles posit that Welles himself was a source of inspiration for the character. Some of the character&#x27;s dialogue on how to run a newspaper are direct quotes from Welles&#x27;s comments on how to make a motion picture (though this was his first). Mankiewicz included dialogue about Kane&#x27;s voracious appetite, also a reference to Welles.

Later news media figures including Sumner Murray Redstone, Rupert Murdoch, Ted Turner, and Elon Musk have been compared to Kane.

==Fictional character biography==
&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; explores the life of the titular character. We are given an overview of his public career in the pastiche &quot;News on the March&quot; newsreel, with some parts then shown in more detail through the flashback recollections of those who knew him.

===Early years===
Kane is born of humble origins in the fictional settlement of Little Salem, Colorado, in 1862 or 1863. A supposedly worthless mine given to his mother in 1868—to settle a bill for room and board by Fred Graves—is discovered to be rich in gold, making the family suddenly fabulously wealthy. In 1871, in return for an annual income of $50,000, Kane&#x27;s mother puts her son and the money under the guardianship of New York City banker Walter Parks Thatcher, who raises Kane in luxury. Kane resents Thatcher for ripping him away from his family, and spends most of his early adult life rebelling against him. He attends prestigious colleges such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell and a college in Switzerland—and gets himself expelled from all of them.

At the age of 25 Kane acquires control of the money, the world&#x27;s sixth-largest private fortune. He returns from a trip abroad to take control of the &quot;New York Daily Inquirer&quot;, a struggling newspaper acquired on his behalf by Thatcher as a result of a foreclosure on a debt, saying in a telegram that &quot;it would be fun to run a newspaper&quot;. He takes up full-time residence in the newspaper office (the sitting editor resigning in protest) and in the first edition publishes a &quot;declaration of principles&quot; stating his duty to be truthful to his readers and to campaign on behalf of the poor and underprivileged. His best friend Jedediah Leland, the &quot;Inquirer&quot;″s drama critic, asks to keep the text of the declaration, feeling it might one day be an important document.

To Thatcher&#x27;s fury, Kane campaigns against slum landlords, &quot;copper robbers&quot; and &quot;traction trusts&quot; (monopoly control of railways), including companies in which he himself is a major shareholder. To finance the fledgling &quot;Inquirer&quot;, Kane uses his personal resources, reasoning that this would allow him to operate it, even at a million-dollar annual loss, for 60 years. Over a period of six years, Kane also hires staff members away from the rival &quot;Chronicle&quot; newspaper, regarding them as collectibles. However, he uses yellow journalism tactics to blow stories out of proportion and encourage a war with Spain in 1898.

===Political career===
Kane, whose party affiliation is never explicitly specified, is shown to be a supporter of Theodore Roosevelt, joining him on a whistle stop train tour. &quot;One President at least&quot; owes his election to the support of Kane&#x27;s newspapers.

Kane eventually marries Emily Monroe Norton, the niece of a President of the United States. Their marriage takes place at the White House. The marriage sours because of Kane&#x27;s egomania, obsession with his newspapers and attacks on her uncle&#x27;s administration. Their marital problems reach the point that they are barely on speaking terms, with Charles ignoring Emily as she reads the rival &quot;Chronicle&quot; newspaper at breakfast.

Kane opposes US entry into World War I.

As his popularity increases, Kane, who regards himself and is widely seen as a future President, runs as a &quot;fighting liberal&quot; for Governor of New York in 1916, against corrupt boss James &quot;Jim&quot; W. Gettys. He addresses a packed rally at Madison Square Gardens, promising to have Gettys arrested and sent to prison. An election victory is almost certain until Gettys reveals evidence of Kane&#x27;s affair with a young singer named Susan Alexander. Gettys blackmails Kane, meeting with him and his wife at Susan&#x27;s apartment, but Kane refuses to drop out of the race despite Gettys&#x27; leverage. The scandal goes public and Kane loses the election decisively.

The night of Kane&#x27;s loss, a drunk and disillusioned Leland asks him for a transfer to the Chicago paper. He accuses Kane of treating &quot;the working man&quot; he claims to fight for as a possession, and says that, for all his talk of helping the less fortunate, the only person Kane really cares about is himself. Kane allows him to transfer to Chicago, effectively ending their friendship.

Emily divorces Kane shortly afterward, and dies two years later, along with their son, in a car accident.

===Later life===
Two weeks after his first divorce, Kane marries Susan in a small ceremony at the City Hall in Trenton, New Jersey. He forces her into a doomed and humiliating career as an opera singer, building an opera house in Chicago specially for her. Leland, now a drama critic for the &quot;Chicago Inquirer&quot;, refuses to toe the company line by praising Alexander&#x27;s performances. Leland becomes too drunk at the difficult task of writing a truthful review against Kane&#x27;s wishes, and falls into a stupor. Kane visits the paper&#x27;s newsroom and finishes the review with Leland&#x27;s negative tone intact, intending to prove that he still has integrity; he then fires Leland. In retaliation, Leland refuses his severance package and mails back the torn-up check with the original copy of Kane&#x27;s &quot;declaration of principles&quot;, which Kane angrily destroys.

After Susan attempts suicide, Kane releases her from her disastrous operatic career and spends most of his time at Xanadu, his gigantic Gothic chateau, full of &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; which he has acquired over the decades, and built on an artificial mountain on his vast estate in Florida. By 1925 Kane is being denounced as a &quot;communist&quot; by the aged Thatcher to a congressional committee, and in the same month as an enemy of the working man and a &quot;fascist&quot; by a speaker at a public rally in Union Square, Manhattan. He insists that he is simply &quot;an American&quot;. The business downturns of the Great Depression—as well as Kane&#x27;s excessive spending habits on the crumbling and unfinished Xanadu—forces him to downsize his media empire. He is also forced to hand over financial management of his businesses, although not operational control of his newspapers, to the aged Thatcher. Susan is unable to stand the monotonous routine inside the cavernous mansion and Kane&#x27;s increasingly domineering nature, and eventually leaves him.

Kane continues to travel and meet with world leaders. He returns from an aeroplane trip to Europe in 1935, declaring that he has met with the leaders of &quot;England, France, Germany and Italy&quot; and that &quot;there will be no war&quot;. He initially supports Adolf Hitler, with whom he appears on a balcony, but later denounces him. He also meets with but denounces Francisco Franco.

===Death===
Kane eventually becomes a recluse at Xanadu, living alone and estranged from all his friends and no longer wielding much influence over politics. Most of his giant estate is now overgrown, with most of the animals gone from its zoos. He dies alone in his bedroom one night in 1941, after uttering his last word, &quot;Rosebud.&quot;

The death of the &quot;Great Yellow Journalist&quot; is a national news event and is the lead story in many newspapers. His own &quot;Inquirer&quot; chain devotes the entire front page to him, praising him for his &quot;lifetime of service&quot; and stating that the &quot;entire nation mourns&quot;. The rival &quot;Chronicle&quot; is less complimentary, recalling his &quot;stormy career&quot; and stating that &quot;few … will mourn&quot; him. The &quot;Chicago Globe&quot; also mentions his &quot;stormy career&quot; and denounces him as &quot;US Fascist No 1&quot;; the last two papers run unflattering photographs of him. The &quot;Minneapolis Record Herald&quot; praises him as the &quot;Sponsor of Democracy&quot;, the &quot;Detroit Star&quot; as &quot;Leader of [the] News World&quot; and a &quot;Man of Destiny&quot;, but the &quot;El Paso Journal&quot; accuses him of having &quot;Instigated War for Profit&quot;. His death is also covered in the French, Japanese and Russian press.

Reporter Jerry Thompson is assigned to find out what &quot;Rosebud&quot; means. Despite interviewing all of Kane&#x27;s living acquaintances, he never finds out what it is. After the reporters depart, his staff start burning in an incinerator those of his possessions which they see as trash. The viewer sees that the word &quot;Rosebud&quot; was written on the sled Kane&#x27;s parents gave him as a young boy, and left behind at his mother&#x27;s boarding house when he was sent away to live with Thatcher. It is implied earlier in the film that Kane found the sled in a warehouse, where he had been looking over his late mother&#x27;s possessions, around the time he first met Susan.

==Relationships==
===Susan Alexander===
Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) was Kane&#x27;s second wife. She was 21 when they first met in the mid-1910s (Kane would have been at least 50); she is evidently low class and is in charge of the sheet music at a shop. Kane was attracted to her because she liked him for himself, despite not knowing he was a public figure. Kane sets her up in a larger and more comfortable apartment with an African American maid, which Gettys describes as a &quot;Love nest&quot; to implicate her as Kane&#x27;s mistress; the film does not make it clear whether she really was. However, a mere two weeks after his first wife divorced him in 1916, Kane married Susan.

Susan enjoyed singing when she and Kane first met, but knows she is not particularly talented. Despite this, Kane tried to force her into a career as an opera singer, even building an opera house specifically for her, in which she performs the leading role in a fictional opera &quot;Salammbo&quot;. Her weak voice and poor acting attract the derision of the audience and of the stage hands. Kane&#x27;s Xanadu estate was built at least in part to please her. Susan is the last of Kane&#x27;s friends to leave him as well as the original owner of the snow globe he drops after saying &quot;rosebud&quot;. As of 1941, she is still living, but is an alcoholic. Despite having &quot;lost all her money&quot; she is running a run-down nightclub (&quot;El Rancho&quot;) in Atlantic City, which is where Jerry Thompson interviews her.

===Jedediah Leland===
Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) was a close friend of Kane, having met him in college. According to Mr. Bernstein, he came from a wealthy family that lost all their money. He is generally acknowledged to represent the morality and idealism Kane himself loses as the film progresses. During Kane&#x27;s campaign for Governor, he is seen addressing a small audience in the street shortly before Kane&#x27;s speech. In disgust at Kane&#x27;s throwing away of the election, he moves to Chicago to work as drama critic for the &quot;Inquirer&quot; in that city; by the time he writes his bad review of Susan Alexander&#x27;s operatic debut, he and Kane have not spoken in a number of years. In 1941 Jedediah lives in a nursing home in Manhattan, where Jerry Thompson interviews him.

===Walter Thatcher===
Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris) is a New York banker. He becomes Kane&#x27;s legal guardian in 1871. Kane resents him and, when he comes into control of his fortune in the late 1880s, uses the &quot;Inquirer&quot; to harass him. Thatcher, clearly getting on in years by the 1890s, initially regards Kane as mentally &quot;still the college boy&quot; and urges him to greater financial prudence. In a scene in the newsreel in 1925, Thatcher, described as the &quot;grand old man of Wall Street&quot;, tells a congressional investigation that Kane is a Communist. Thatcher is still alive, presumably at least in his nineties, after the Crash of 1929, and takes control of Kane&#x27;s failing business empire, although allowing Kane to retain &quot;a considerable measure of control&quot; over his newspapers and reassuring Kane that the Depression is merely temporary and that he might yet die richer than him. When Thatcher asks Kane what he would have liked to have been, Kane replies &quot;Everything you hate&quot;. He is dead by 1941, his unpublished memoirs kept in a vault.

===Mr. Bernstein===
Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane) is a business executive and by 1941 is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Kane&#x27;s business interests. Having served as Kane&#x27;s personal assistant since at least when he took over the &quot;Inquirer&quot;, Bernstein proved the most loyal to the man. He is on good enough terms to visit and leave a present for Kane&#x27;s infant son, to Mrs. Kane&#x27;s irritation. Bernstein willingly participated in indulging Kane&#x27;s obsession in his wife&#x27;s operatic career even though it was ill-considered by everyone else. However, he has scruples such as advising his employer not to make promises he cannot keep in his Declaration of Principles.

==Wealth and empire==
Apart from the &quot;New York Inquirer&quot;, Kane publishes similar &quot;Inquirer&quot; newspapers in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and other major American cities. The &quot;News on the March&quot; newsreel at the beginning of the film also states that Kane controls two newspaper syndicates and a radio network; it also mentions that Kane has other business interests in real estate, logging, shipping, and food retailing. However, Kane&#x27;s empire largely collapses at the onset of the Great Depression, and he is forced to hand financial control of his remaining holdings (although not operational control of his newspapers) to Thatcher. Kane has enough wealth to build Chicago&#x27;s opera house, as well as his unfinished mansion, Xanadu.

The mansion contains Kane&#x27;s vast collection of classical sculptures and art, and the newsreel states that portions of Xanadu were taken from other famous palaces overseas.

<text>The State Emergency Service (SES) is the name used by a number of separate civil defence organisations in Australia that provide assistance during and after major incidents. Specifically, the services deal with floods, storms and tsunamis, but can also assist in other emergencies, such as vertical rescue and road crash rescues, missing persons searches, and medical evacuations. In other scenarios the SES may provide a support role to other agencies, particularly police and fire. The SES is operational 24 hours a day. The SES is constituted as separate organisations operating in the various Australian states and territories. Eight of the SES organisations co-ordinate through the Australian Council of State and Territory Emergency Services (ACSES).

== History ==
During World War II the National Emergency Service was created on 1 February 1939 to provide air raid wardens. The organisation was disbanded six months after the end of the war.

The Civil Defence Service began in Australia in 1955. It was formed as a precaution to any potential attacks on Australian soil. The name was changed to the &quot;State Emergency Service&quot; (abbreviated to &quot;SES&quot;) during the 1970s, to reflect a change of emphasis into providing emergency help related to floods, storms and other natural emergencies. Every state and territory in Australia has its own State (or Territory) Emergency Service, and there are 43,000 volunteers spread across the country. Each state or territory is broken into &quot;regions&quot;, then &quot;units&quot;, and finally &quot;groups&quot; or &quot;teams&quot;.

The SES is one of many public safety organisations using AIIMS (Australasian Inter-Service Incident Management System). Typically, small (Level 1) incidents are assigned to a &#x27;unit&#x27; and dealt with by a &#x27;team&#x27; while larger and/or more complex (Level 2 or 3) incidents are coordinated at the regional level.

== Agency Executives ==
Each State Emergency Service has an Executive appointed by the Minister responsible for each state.
==Functions==
The SES provides assistance to local communities in times of need. Because every community is different, every SES Unit has a slightly different set of roles and activities. Depending on the needs of the local community, a Unit may perform only some or all of these roles:

==Funding==
In addition to funds provided through legislation to the SES by state and local governments, SES groups also supplement their financial resources with donations made by individuals and businesses, and through other government grants. These donations typically contribute to purchasing or maintaining group equipment, such as vehicles and tools, or to improvement of SES property and facilities.

<doc id="637954" wikidata="Q857512" url="?curid=637954" title="Smacker video">
<text>Smacker video is a video file format (with the &quot;.SMK&quot; file extension) developed by Epic Games Tools, and primarily used for full-motion video in video games. Smacker uses an adaptive 8-bit RGB palette. RAD&#x27;s format for video at higher color depths is Bink Video. The Smacker format specifies a container format, a video compression format, and an audio compression format. Since its release in 1994, Smacker has been used in over 2300 games. Blizzard used this format for the cinematic videos seen in its games &quot;Warcraft II&quot;, &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Diablo I&quot;. 

The format has been reverse engineered and implemented in libavcodec. A non-commercial SourceForge project &quot;libsmacker&quot; released an open source decoder in 2013.

==Technical details==

===File format (container)===
Smacker defines its own container format. A Smacker file can contain a Smacker video track and up to seven audio tracks. Each audio track can have either one channel (mono) or two channels (stereo) with a bit depth of either 8-bit or 16-bit. The audio can either be uncompressed PCM, compressed in the Smacker Audio format, or, in newer versions of Smacker, compressed in the Bink Audio format.

===Video===
Smacker video supports 256 colors, but no transparency support. While being a palette-based format, which is inherently limited to having not more than 256 colors in each frame, Smacker videos may still contain more colors in total due to &quot;palette rotation&quot;, whereby the palette is updated on a per-frame basis. This usually results in SMK files that look better if the source video has more than 256 colors. The compression rate depends on the content. The encoding of a video consisting of still or barely moving frames is after the first frame practically free. Frames with random colors might more than double the raw size.

In Smacker video, a frame is split into 4×4 blocks in raster-scan order. Each block can be coded in one of six coding modes: skip, fill, mono, and three full modes. Each mode can be signaled for multiple blocks in a run-length encoding scheme. In skip mode, the current block is copied from the previous frame in a conditional replenishment fashion. In fill mode, the current block is filled with a single color. In mono mode, the palette is locally reduced from 256 colors to two colors. Both colors are written to the bitstream and one bit per pixel is used to indicate which of the two colors a pixel should be. The mono mode can be interpreted as vector quantization, where a three-dimensional vector with the components red, green, and blue is quantized using an adaptive codebook with two entries. There are three full modes, one was specified in version 2 of the Smacker format, while the other two were added in version 4. In the original full mode, 16 colors are transmitted, one for each pixel, equivalent to raw uncompressed PCM. The two full modes added in version 4 use 4 and 8 colors in a block, respectively. In the 4-color mode, the 4×4 block is split into four 2×2 blocks, each of which is filled with a solid color. In the 8-color mode, the 4×4 block is split into eight 1×2 blocks, each of which is filled with a solid color.

Further compression is achieved by entropy coding using Huffman coding of the various bitstream elements that result from the process above. There are four separate Huffman tables, each with 16-bit entries: one for mode decision, run-length, and fill color in fill color mode, one for the color indices in mono mode, one for the bitmap in mono mode, and one for all data in the full mode. Each table is adaptive and transmitted once per file in the header. The Huffman tables in the header are themselves compressed: the 16 bit values in the leaves of the code tree are split into a high byte and a low byte. Each byte is compressed using a Huffman table that is also contained in the header.

===Audio===
Smacker audio is one of the audio formats that can be used in the Smacker container. For compression, Differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) is used. The difference between two successive samples is compressed using Huffman coding. The Huffman tables are adapted once per audio frame.

<text>The Fenelon Place Elevator (also known as the Fourth Street Elevator) is a narrow gauge funicular railway located in Dubuque, Iowa, United States. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It was included as a contributing property in the Cathedral Historic District in 1985, and in the Fenelon Place Residential Historic District in 2015.

==History==

A predecessor to the Fourth Street Elevator was built in 1882 for the private use of local banker and former state senator J.K. Graves. The funicular was opened to the public in 1884, charging 5 cents per ride. After several fires, the existing funicular was rebuilt in 1893 on the footprint of the 1882 incline; the 1893 funicular inaugurated the use of the cable car technology that continues in use.

==Location==
The upper station of the elevator is located at 512 Fenelon Place, while the lower station is located at the western end of Fourth Street. At the top, there are two observation decks, which offer a commanding view of the downtown Dubuque area. The states of Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin can all be seen from the observation decks.

==Function==
The funicular is long, and angles up at 41 degrees with a vertical elevation of . The two cars start at opposite ends, passing each other at the midpoint of the elevator. The two cars counterbalance each other, drawing motive power from an engine in the station house at the top of the hill. The engine only needs to overcome inertia and friction and compensate for the varying weight of the passengers in the cars.

The Fourth Street Elevator is run from April 1 to November 30. The hours are from 8 am to 10 pm.

<doc id="637958" wikidata="Q1474005" url="?curid=637958" title="Western Illinois University">
<text>Western Illinois University (WIU) is a public university in Macomb, Illinois, United States. It was founded in 1899 as Western Illinois State Normal School. As the normal school grew, it became Western Illinois State Teachers College. Once Western Illinois started offering graduate degrees, it again changed its name to Western Illinois State College. Western Illinois has an additional campus in Moline.

==History==
Western Illinois University was founded on April 24, 1899. The land for the university was donated by Macomb&#x27;s Freemasons (Illinois Lodge #17). Macomb was in direct competition with Quincy, Aledo, Monmouth, La Harpe, and Rushville, as candidates for the site of a &quot;western&quot; university. The Illinois legislature selected Macomb as the location. University administrators uncovered evidence of the Freemasons&#x27; efforts on Macomb&#x27;s behalf when they opened Sherman Hall&#x27;s (the administration building) cornerstone during centennial celebrations. Named after legislative leader L.Y. Sherman.

Classes first began on campus on September 23, 1902 with 229 students enrolled. Founders’ Day is celebrated on campus every September 23 to mark this event.

The university&#x27;s name has changed three times since its foundation as the Western Illinois State Normal School in 1899: the school was first renamed Western Illinois State Teachers College in 1921 and then to Western Illinois State College in 1947 and finally Western Illinois University in 1957.

Sherman Hall was the university&#x27;s primary facility for many years, but as the university and its programs expanded, a need surfaced for further expansion. Today, the Macomb campus consists of 53 buildings over . Sherman Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Western&#x27;s presence in the Quad Cities spans more than 40 years. In Fall 1960, the university offered its first undergraduate course in the Quad Cities.

In 2016 and 2017, WIU saw a major downsizing and exodus of faculty and staff as a consequence of state budget cuts and declining undergraduate enrollment.

==Academics==
Western Illinois University is composed of four academic colleges: 
*Arts &amp; Sciences
*Business &amp; Technology
*Education &amp; Human Services
*Fine Arts &amp; Communication 
In addition Western Illinois also offers an Honors College and the School of Extended Studies, which includes nontraditional programs. In 2023, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the university #39 (tie) out of 167 Regional Universities Midwest and, as a Midwest Regional University, #17 in Best Colleges for Veterans (tie), #51 in Best Value Schools, #38 in Top Performers on Social Mobility (tie), and #9 in Top Public Schools (tie).

The university offers 69 undergraduate majors, over 51 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs and 13 pre-professional degrees at the undergraduate level. At the graduate level, 42 degree and certificate programs are offered. 95% of all courses are taught by full-time faculty. The university offers a Doctorate of Education in Educational Leadership (Ed. D.), which was established in 2005.

Western&#x27;s Cost Guarantee Plan is a four-year fixed rate for tuition, fees, room and board that remains in place as long as students are continuously enrolled. Western was one of the first institutions in America, and the first state university in Illinois, to offer the guarantee. Western Illinois also offers the Cost Guarantee for graduate students enrolled in a degree program, as well as to transfer students earning an associate degree. Those students who transfer to WIU the following semester upon completing their associate degree will receive the previous year&#x27;s cost guarantee rates.

===Rankings===

===Library system===
Four libraries make up the WIU Libraries system. Completed in November 1975, Leslie F. Malpass Library (formerly Memorial Library) is the main branch of the library system. Designed by Gyo Obata, Malpass Library stands at six levels high and 222,000 square feet. Other WIU libraries include the Music Library, Physical Sciences Library, Curriculum Library, and the WIU-Quad Cities Library (Moline, Illinois) that was opened in the late 1990s to support WIU&#x27;s growing presence in the Quad Cities.

Western Illinois University Libraries house several archives and special collections that aid in documenting the history of the west-central Illinois region. The libraries are the home for the Center for Hancock County History, the Center for Icarian Studies, the Civil War Collection (documenting the western Illinois experience in the war), the Decker Press Collection and the Mormon Collection.

In August of 2024 university leaders announced their intentions to fire all of the library faculty, 8 tenured librarians and one on the tenure track. From 2013 to 2024, the number of library faculty at the university diminished from 16 to 9 and the number of semiprofessional and clerical staff diminished from 41 to 20.

===Centennial Honors College===

===Western Illinois University Quad Cities===

Western Illinois University Quad Cities (WIU-QC) is located in the Quad Cities metropolitan area, a region of cities in northwest Illinois and southeast Iowa, and is located along the Mississippi River in Moline, Illinois. Western Illinois has been in the Quad Cities dating back to 1912 when they first began offering extension classes in Moline and Rock Island. WIU-QC was previously an upper-division commuter site located on John Deere Road in Moline, Illinois. The branch began a move to the Moline riverfront in 2012, and has expanded to serve all levels of the college experience, from the freshman year to professional development. WIU-QC offers classes at the undergraduate, graduate, doctoral, and post-baccalaureate levels.

Riverfront Hall, built in 2012 on the site of the former John Deere Tech Center, houses the College of Business and Technology, including the School of Engineering formerly located in the Caxton Building in downtown Moline. In 2014, the Quad Cities Complex was added, three connected buildings which house the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Education and Human Services, and Fine Arts and Communications, as well as the library, student services, and administration.

<text>The municipalities of modern-day New York City just before consolidation, excluding [[Administrative divisions of New York (state)#Village|village]]s. [[City of Greater New York|[[New York County]] and [[Bronx County]]:]] [[City of Greater New York|[[Kings County, New York|Kings County]]:]] [[City of Greater New York|[[Queens County, New York|Queens County]]:]] [[City of Greater New York|[[Richmond County, New York|Richmond County]]:]]

The City of Greater New York was the consolidation of the City of New York
with Brooklyn, western Queens County, and Staten Island, which took effect on January 1, 1898. New York had already annexed the Bronx (west of the Bronx River in 1874, east of the Bronx River in 1895), so the consolidated city sprawled across five counties, which became the five Boroughs of modern New York. Eastern Queens County was excluded and later became Nassau County.

==Background==
New York City had been founded in the 1620s by the Dutch as New Amsterdam at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan. The English conquered the territory and established the original twelve counties of the province of New York in 1683; one of these was the City and County of New York. A 1691 law defined New York City to be the entirety of Manhattan, while Manning&#x27;s Island (now Roosevelt Island), the Barn Islands (now Randalls and Wards Islands), and the Oyster Islands (now Liberty Island, Ellis Island and Black Tom) were New York County. Towns had been established in the rest of the province by 1691, and were reincorporated after the American Revolution in 1788.

Brooklyn had been chartered by the Dutch in 1646; the Town of Brooklyn was one of the towns incorporated by 1691 and reestablished in 1788. It was located within Kings County, another county established by the English in 1683. It was incorporated as a village in 1814 and as a city in 1834. Originally comprising what is now Downtown Brooklyn, it annexed its surroundings through the 19th century and grew to encompass all of Kings County in 1895. By the 1890 United States census it had become the largest city in the United States.

Since the late 1820s, there had been some discussion of a unified city. In 1857, the New York State Legislature resolved that the region surrounding New York City should become one body, to improve harbor facilities and link the systems of trade. They attempted to do so by government vote, but distrust of large projects killed the plans.

==Consolidation==
The consolidation movement was the work of local, city, and state politicians, most prominently Andrew Haswell Green, the president of the &quot;Greater New-York Commission&quot; and &quot;The Father of Greater New York&quot;. Green was a member of the Board of Commissioners of Central Park, which provided him a platform to push his views.
The next challenge to the independence of the boroughs was a self-promoted and government-appointed commission. The commission led the &quot;Vote for Greater New York&quot; movement. Some opponents derided the effort as &quot;Andy Green&#x27;s hobby&quot;, but eventually they were proven wrong. The center of the plan was the consolidation of the twin cities of New York and Brooklyn, whose fire departments had been merged into a Metropolitan Fire District in 1865. The addition of Long Island City and various rural areas anticipated future development of those areas. With Republicans historically more powerful in Brooklyn and Democrats elsewhere, partisan politics played a role: each major political party hoped to dominate the consolidated city.
The plan required a referendum in all affected areas, though the organizers of the referendum clearly had a bias towards the consolidation. They even released a full-page advertisement in &quot;The New York Times&quot; before the vote took place, urging them to vote &quot;For Consolidation&quot;. An argument for consolidation was that the unconsolidated city would soon be surpassed by Chicago as the most populous city in the United States.

Opposition, concentrated in Brooklyn and other outlying districts, focused on loss of local control and fears of ethnic and racial minorities. Independence-minded Brooklynites did not want their regional identity to be overtaken by New York. Some newspapers such as the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; argued that consolidation would destroy the mostly homogeneous, Protestant character of the city. Opposing newspapers were accused of seeking to retain the revenues of official advertising, while opposing politicians were accused of graft. Concerns over how Brooklyn&#x27;s water supply would be maintained and how future financial backing would be possible were legitimate. Considerations of finance and water supply prevailed, and the people of Brooklyn voted by a narrow margin to consolidate.

The term &quot;City of Greater New York&quot; was never a legal or official designation; both the original charter of 1898 and the newer one of 1938 use the name of &quot;City of New York&quot;. It is used today only to refer to the time period when the consolidation took place.

Each consolidated county remained a county in relation to the state, but also became a borough within the city. The Bronx reunited to form a fifth borough that shared New York County with Manhattan. A separate Bronx County was established in 1914, making the present New York County co-extensive with the Borough (but not the island) of Manhattan.

== Consolidation referendum results ==
On December 14, 1894, the State Board of Canvassers released the official tally of the referendums, along with other races. The options listed on the ballot were &quot;For Consolidation&quot; and &quot;Against Consolidation&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported the results:
== Subsequent history ==
Since the enlarged city contained the majority of the state of New York&#x27;s population, and the enlargement increased the city&#x27;s already enormous power within the state, the state legislature established certain oversight powers within the city. For example, some issues of taxation and changes in governmental procedures require state approval or granting of specific home rule powers.

Conversely, the State Constitution was amended to provide that no city could elect the majority of the State Assembly, a provision later struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964 as violating the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The New York City Board of Estimate, created in the consolidation charter with equal votes for each borough, was struck down on similar grounds in 1989.

===Attempted Staten Island secession===
Staten Island is geographically the most distant of the five boroughs, linked to the other four only by a single bridge, the Staten Island Ferry, and one NYC Ferry route. It is also not connected to the New York City Subway. In 1993, it held a non-binding referendum on the issue of seceding from New York City to become an independent city and county. Many Staten Island politicians, including Senator John J. Marchi and Assemblyman Eric N. Vitaliano supported the movement. Vote Yes, Inc. was formed as a nonpartisan, grass-roots organization in January 1990. Its initial purpose was to secure a &quot;yes&quot; vote for the November 1990 referendum on Staten Island secession. Ultimately, 65% of Staten Island residents voted to secede, through the approval of a new city charter making Staten Island an independent city, but implementation was blocked in the State Assembly. The Staten Island secession movement was defused by the election of Rudy Giuliani as New York City mayor, who fulfilled two of the borough&#x27;s biggest demands: making the Staten Island Ferry free in 1997 and closing the Fresh Kills Landfill in 2001.

<doc id="637985" wikidata="Q16986863" url="?curid=637985" title="Washington, D.C., Special Flight Rules Area">
<text>An air defense identification zone (ADIZ) has existed since February 10, 2003, around the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area to restrict air traffic near Washington, D.C.

The ADIZ was established as a precursor to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. It has been erroneously connected to the September 11 attacks as a temporary measure to prevent further attacks. It was made permanent in 2008.

Despite efforts by the Federal Aviation Administration to inform pilots of the ADIZ, there are still many unauthorized incursions by unsuspecting pilots. A pilot who violates the boundaries may be intercepted by military aircraft and escorted to the nearest airport.

==Creation==
The ADIZ (now known by its components, the Flight Restricted Zone and Special Flight Rules Area) was created by the FAA in response to demands by a working group that became formalized as the National Capital Region Coordination Center. The U.S. Congress has never legitimized these restrictions, and any consideration of opposing the Executive Branch&#x27;s actions became politically unpalatable in the wake of two mishaps that led to the evacuation of the Capitol. One involved a plane carrying Ernie Fletcher, the Governor of Kentucky, which led to an evacuation in 2004. The other, almost a year later, involved a Cessna 150 flown by a student pilot accompanied by a pilot who was not familiar with the ADIZ rules, using an outdated chart.

==Location==
The original Washington ADIZ was roughly co-extensive with the Class B airspace around Washington. On August 30, 2007, the dimensions of the ADIZ were changed to a circle centered on the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) VOR/DME (located at ), with a small triangular cutout for Leesburg Executive Airport (JYO). This change reduced the size of the ADIZ by and removed 33 airports from its coverage.

===Flight Restricted Zone===
Within the ADIZ is an even more sensitive zone designated the &quot;Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area Flight Restricted Zone&quot; (DC FRZ). The DC FRZ extends approximately around the DCA VOR/DME. Flight within the FRZ is restricted to governmental, certain scheduled commercial and a limited set of waivered flights. Two general aviation airports (known as the &quot;Maryland 3&quot; or the &quot;DC 3&quot;) are located inside the DC FRZ: College Park Airport (CGS) and Potomac Airport (VKX). Washington Executive/Hyde Field (W32) closed permanently in 2022.

==Public opposition==
Pilots&#x27; groups, led by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), have argued that the ADIZ is unnecessary and has a harmful effect on the economy of small airports and aviation-related businesses in and near the ADIZ. Pilots involved in law enforcement have described the ADIZ as a &quot;major, unnecessary burden on pilots and air traffic controllers with almost no increased security benefit.&quot; AOPA and other groups are hoping to persuade Congress to lift or ease the ADIZ restrictions from Washington airspace – or at the very least to dramatically improve its operational aspects.

In 2006, the FAA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) docket number 17005 concerning making the temporary rules permanent. Over 20,000 responses were received, the vast majority of them in opposition to making the temporary rules permanent. There were two public hearings held by the FAA in the Washington D.C. area on the NPRM. All speakers were opposed to making the NPRM permanent . The FAA published transcripts of the public hearings. The transcripts were later withdrawn from the public as they were alleged to contain Sensitive Security Information, but were returned following review.

==Subsequent changes==
On August 30, 2007, the FAA implemented new rules for air traffic controllers and issued revised NOTAMs for pilots flying in the ADIZ. Although the NOTAMs and FAA procedures state that no radar services will be provided to pilots unless requested, air traffic controllers at Potomac TRACON are providing such services. This is due to a memorandum from the Potomac TRACON Air Traffic Manager to air traffic controllers stating that a certain paragraph (2-1-2) of the Air Traffic Control handbook (7110.65) is still applicable when providing ATC Security Services.

Effective February 9, 2009, any pilots flying VFR within a radius centered on the ADIZ are required to complete training about the ADIZ. This training can be completed online through a course called &quot;Navigating the New DC ADIZ&quot; (now &quot;DC Special Flight Rules Area&quot;). Pilots may also complete the required training by attending a seminar offered at a Flight Standards District Office. Pilots must obtain a certificate which proves that the training has been completed. This certificate is not required to be carried with the pilot, but must be produced when requested from law enforcement or other agencies. Pilots flying IFR are not subject to this requirement.

On February 17, 2009, the status of the ADIZ was scheduled to change from a temporary flight restriction to a permanent special flight rules area. On February 6, 2009, White House officials declined a request to postpone the implementation.

In February 2012, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 required a joint plan to be submitted in 180 days by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, in consultation with the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense.

&quot;The plan shall outline specific changes to the D.C. Metropolitan Area Special Flight Rules Area that will decrease operational impacts and improve general aviation access to airports in the National Capital Region that are currently impacted by the zone.&quot;

In June 2014, Leesburg airport traffic was granted authority to perform local traffic pattern practice without a SFRA plan filed while operating under tower control without departing the pattern.

==Laser warning system==
In May 2005, NORAD started using a laser warning system to warn pilots that cross into restricted airspace. The bright laser beams, which flash red-red-green, are easily seen, even during daylight. The laser beams can be seen away. Other pilots are unlikely to see the lasers because, when activated, the directional beams are pointed at the aircraft that has crossed into restricted airspace. Multiple lasers could be activated. These lasers do not harm the eyes of aircrew or passengers.
