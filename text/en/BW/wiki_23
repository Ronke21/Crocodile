<text>Strasserism () is an ideological strand of Nazism which adheres to revolutionary nationalism and to economic antisemitism, which conditions are to be achieved with radical, mass-action and worker-based politics that are more aggressive than the politics of the Hitlerite leaders of the Nazi Party. Named after brothers Gregor and Otto Strasser, the ideology of &quot;Strasserism&quot; is a type of Third Position, right-wing politics in opposition to Communism and to Hitlerite Nazism.

In his political career, Otto Strasser led an ultranationalist faction within the Nazi Party, but resigned from the Party in 1930; he later established the Combat League of Revolutionary National Socialists (the Black Front) to rival the Nazi Party. Consequent to his politics, Otto Strasser fled Germany in 1933 and returned to West Germany after the end of World War II in 1953. In the intramural politics of the Nazi Party, &quot;Strasserism&quot; had many supporters among the troops of the Sturmabteilung (SA), which led to Hitler&#x27;s purging the Strasserist faction and killing their leader, Gregor Strasser, as well as Ernst Röhm, the head of the SA, during the Night of the Long Knives in July 1934.

In the 1980s, the revolutionary nationalism and the economic anti-Semitism of &quot;Strasserism&quot; reappeared in the politics of the National Front in the United Kingdom.

== Strasser brothers ==
=== Gregor Strasser ===

Gregor Strasser (1892–1934) began his career in ultranationalist German politics by joining the &quot;Freikorps&quot; after soldiering in the First World War (1914–1918). He participated in the Kapp Putsch (13 March 1920) and formed his own &quot;völkischer Wehrverband&quot;, a “popular defense union” that Strasser later merged into the Nazi Party in 1921. Initially a loyal supporter of Hitler, as such, Strasser participated in the Beer Hall Putsch (8–9 November 1923) and held high-level offices in the Nazi Party; however, Strasser became a strong advocate of the radical wing of the Nazi Party, arguing that the nationalist revolution should act to resolve the poverty imposed upon post-war Germany and should seek the political support of the German working class.

After Hitler became Chancellor, Ernst Röhm, who headed the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), the principal paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, called for a second, national-socialist revolution to remove the business, social, and political elites from positions of power in the government, the economy, and the politics of Germany. Strasser and Röhm&#x27;s proposed revolution was opposed by the conservatives, military and Hitlerite Nazis who preferred an ordered authoritarian régime for Germany to the politically disruptive programs proposed by the Strasserist radicals of the Nazi Party.

=== Otto Strasser ===

Otto Strasser (1897–1974) had also been a member of the &quot;Freikorps&quot;, but he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany and fought against the Kapp Putsch. Strasser joined the Nazi Party in 1925, where he kept promoting the importance of &quot;socialism&quot; in &quot;National Socialism&quot;. Considered more of a radical than his brother, Strasser was expelled by the Nazi Party in 1930 and set up the Black Front, his own dissident group which called for a specifically German nationalist form of &quot;socialist&quot; revolution. Strasser fled Germany in 1933 to live firstly in Czechoslovakia and then Canada before returning to West Germany in later life, all the while writing prolifically about Hitler and what he saw as his betrayal of Nazism&#x27;s ideals.

== Ideology ==

The name &quot;Strasserism&quot; came to be applied to the form of Nazism associated with the Strasser brothers. Although they had been involved in the creation of the National Socialist Program of 1920, both men called on the party to commit to &quot;breaking the shackles of finance capital&quot;. This opposition to what Nazis termed &quot;Finanzkapitalismus&quot; (finance capitalism) and &quot;raffendes Kapital&quot; (which translates roughly to &quot;money-grubbing capitalism&quot;, and was implied to mean &quot;Jewish capitalism&quot;), which they contrasted to producerism or what was termed &quot;productive capitalism&quot;, was shared by Adolf Hitler, who borrowed it from Gottfried Feder.

This populist form of economic antisemitism was espoused by Otto Strasser in &quot;Nationalsozialistische Briefe&quot;, published in 1925, which discussed notions of class conflict, wealth redistribution and a possible alliance with the Soviet Union. His 1930 follow-up &quot;Ministersessel oder Revolution&quot; (&quot;Cabinet Seat or Revolution&quot;) attacked Hitler&#x27;s betrayal of the socialist aspect of Nazism as well as criticizing the notion of the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;. Whilst Gregor Strasser echoed many of the calls of his brother, his influence on the ideology was lower, owing to his remaining in the Nazi Party longer and to his early death. Meanwhile, Otto Strasser continued to expand his argument, calling for the break-up of large estates and the development of something akin to a guild socialism, and the related establishment of a &quot;Reich&quot; cooperative chamber to take a leading role in economic planning.

It is disputed whether Strasserism was a distinct form of Nazism. According to historian Ian Kershaw, &quot;the leaders of the SA [which included Gregor Strasser] did not have another vision of the future of Germany or another politic to propose&quot;. The Strasserites advocated the radicalization of the Nazi regime and the toppling of the German elites, calling Hitler&#x27;s rise to power a half-revolution which needed to be completed.

Otto Strasser was also strongly Pan-European, even going as far as to praise Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi for his efforts advocating Pan-European unity.

Among the policies of Third Reich of which Otto Strasser was most critical was the German involvement in the Spanish Civil War. He even called on both the S.S., S.A. and the Reichswehr to revolt against Hitler on the slogan of &quot;No German blood for Spain, Hail Germany&quot;.

It has been said Otto Strasser claimed that he was a dissenting Nazi regarding racial policies.

== Influence ==
=== In 1930s Finland ===
Finnish politician Yrjö Ruutu founded the National Socialist Union of Finland (SKSL) in 1932, which was one of several Finnish Nazi parties at the time. Ruutu&#x27;s ideas included the nationalization of large companies and other assets vital for national interests, a self-sufficient planned economy, a parliament controlled by trade unions and the appointment of technocrats as ministers. Ruutu&#x27;s party remained on the fringes of Finnish politics and never gained any seats in parliament, but it is considered to have had a considerable influence on the ideology of the Academic Karelia Society and president Urho Kekkonen. In 1944, all Nazi parties in Finland were dissolved as contrary to Article 21 of the Moscow Armistice, which forbade fascist parties. Some former members of Ruutu&#x27;s party, such as Yrjö Kilpeläinen and Unto Varjonen, became prominent figures in the right-wing faction of the post-war Social Democratic Party of Finland. Another prominent former member, Vietti Nykänen, became the vice chairman of the Radical People&#x27;s Party. Early SKSL member Ensio Uoti was a presidential candidate in 1956 elections. He gained some support and was endorsed by Yleisö newspaper. Member of the board of the party Heikki Waris later became Minister of Social Affairs in the Von Fieandt Cabinet in 1957.

=== In post-war Germany ===

During the 1970s, the ideas of Strasserism began to be mentioned more in European far-right groups as younger members with no ties to Hitler and a stronger sense of economic antisemitism came to the fore. Strasserite thought in Germany began to emerge as a tendency within the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) during the late 1960s. These Strasserites played a leading role in securing the removal of Adolf von Thadden from the leadership and after his departure the party became stronger in condemning Hitler for what it saw as his move away from socialism in order to court business and army leaders.

Although initially adopted by the NPD, Strasserism soon became associated with more peripheral extremist figures, notably Michael Kühnen, who produced a 1982 pamphlet &quot;Farewell to Hitler&quot; which included a strong endorsement of the idea. The People&#x27;s Socialist Movement of Germany/Labour Party, a minor extremist movement that was outlawed in 1982, adopted the policy. Its successor movement, the Nationalist Front, did likewise, with its ten-point programme calling for an &quot;anti-materialist cultural revolution&quot; and an &quot;anti-capitalist social revolution&quot; to underline its support for the idea. The Free German Workers&#x27; Party also moved towards these ideas under the leadership of Friedhelm Busse in the late 1980s.

The flag of the Strasserite movement Black Front and its symbol of a crossed hammer and a sword has been used by German and other European neo-Nazis abroad as a substitute for the more infamous Nazi flag which is banned in some countries such as Germany.

=== In the United Kingdom ===
Strasserism emerged in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and centred on the National Front (NF) publication &quot;Britain First&quot;, the main writers of which were David McCalden, Richard Lawson and Denis Pirie. Opposing the leadership of John Tyndall, they formed an alliance with John Kingsley Read and ultimately followed him into the National Party (NP). The NP called for British workers to seize the right to work and offered a fairly Strasserite economic policy. Nonetheless, the NP was short-lived. Due in part to Read&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm for Strasserism, the main exponents of the idea drifted away.

The idea was reintroduced to the NF by Andrew Brons in the early 1980s when he decided to make the party&#x27;s ideology clearer. However, Strasserism was soon to become the province of the radicals in the Official National Front, with Richard Lawson brought in a behind-the-scenes role to help direct policy. This Political Soldier wing ultimately opted for the indigenous alternative of distributism, but their strong anti-capitalist rhetoric as well as that of their International Third Position successor demonstrated influences from Strasserism. From this background emerged Troy Southgate, whose own ideology and those of related groups such as the English Nationalist Movement and National Revolutionary Faction were influenced by Strasserism.

=== Elsewhere ===
Third Position groups, whose inspiration is generally more Italian in derivation, have often looked to Strasserism, owing to their strong opposition to capitalism based on economic antisemitic grounds. This was noted in France, where the student group &quot;Groupe Union Défense&quot; and the more recent &quot;Renouveau français&quot; both extolled Strasserite economic platforms.

Attempts to reinterpret Nazism as having a left-wing base have also been heavily influenced by this school of thought, notably through the work of Povl Riis-Knudsen, who produced the Strasser-influenced work &quot;National Socialism: A Left-Wing Movement&quot; in 1984.

In the United States, Tom Metzger, a white supremacist, had some affiliation to Strasserism, having been influenced by Kühnen&#x27;s pamphlet. Also in the United States, Matthew Heimbach of the former Traditionalist Worker Party identifies as a Strasserist. Heimbach often engages primarily in anti-capitalist rhetoric during public speeches instead of overt antisemitism, anti-Masonry or anti-communist rhetoric. Heimbach was expelled from the National Socialist Movement due to his economic views being seen by the group as too left-wing. Heimbach stated that the NSM &quot;essentially want it to remain a politically impotent white supremacist gang&quot;.

<text>Operation Commando Hunt was a covert U.S. Seventh Air Force and U.S. Navy Task Force 77 aerial interdiction campaign that took place during the Vietnam War. The operation began on 15 November 1968 and ended on 29 March 1972. The objective of the campaign was to prevent the transit of People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) personnel and supplies on the logistical corridor known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese) that ran from southwestern North Vietnam through the southeastern portion of the Kingdom of Laos and into South Vietnam.

== Interdiction (1964–1968) ==

Systematic U.S. aerial operations against the Ho Chi Minh Trail had begun on 14 December 1964 with Operation Barrel Roll. With the onset of Operation Rolling Thunder, the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam in April 1965, the U.S. also expanded its interdiction effort in Laos by dividing the &quot;Barrel Roll&quot; area into two sections on 3 April. The former operation would continue in northeastern Laos while Operation Steel Tiger was initiated in the southern panhandle. The American headquarters in Saigon requested, and received, authorization to control bombing in the area adjacent to South Vietnam&#x27;s northern provinces in Operation Tiger Hound on 3 December 1965.

The U.S. Air Force had already begun to up the ante in its anti-infiltration campaigns by unleashing B-52 Stratofortress bombers against the trail in December 1965. From April through June 1966 there were 400 B-52 anti-infiltration sorties against the system. The PAVN countered this effort by concentrating more anti-aircraft artillery weapons within its logistical network. Between 1964 and the end of 1967 there were 103,148 tactical air sorties launched against the trail, including 1,718 B-52 strikes. During the same timeframe 132 U.S. aircraft or helicopters were shot down over Laos.

So matters stood until the massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a tactical victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) were stunned by the size and ferocity of the offensive. The light at the end of the tunnel had been extinguished, if it had ever existed at all. The president, in an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; on 11 November 1968.

This effectively shifted the bombing campaign towards the southwest, in the direction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The interdiction campaign against the enemy logistics corridor was massively expanded due to the increased number of U.S. aircraft (approximately 500 planes) made available by the closure of &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;. By November 1968 bombing missions over southern Laos had climbed by 300 percent, from 4,700 sorties in October to 12,800 in November. By the end of the conflict, U.S. and South Vietnamese aircraft would drop over three million tons of ordnance on Laos, three times the total tonnage dropped on North Vietnam. The new campaign against the trail was unprecedented, and not just due to the numbers sorties flown or munitions expended. The U.S. was going to field its latest technology in its attempt to prevent the North Vietnamese from toppling the South Vietnamese government in Saigon.

== Igloo White ==
As early as 1966 Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara had become increasingly disenchanted with the bombing of the north. No amount of pressure, it seemed, could either drive Hanoi to the negotiating table or slow the flow of PAVN supplies and men to the south. He then began to consider an alternative in the form of a physical strongpoint/electronic barrier to infiltration that would stretch below the Demilitarized Zone from the coast to the Laotian frontier (and possibly beyond). This was the origin of the so-called &quot;McNamara Line.&quot;

The physical barrier was to be backed up by air-dropped and hand-emplaced acoustic and seismic sensors that would provide both warning and location of enemy movements. A scientific group was established to find or develop the technology for what was initially titled &quot;Practice Nine&quot;. On 17 June 1967 the title of the program was altered to &quot;Illinois City&quot; and on 15 July to &quot;Dyemarker&quot;, the electronic barrier portion of which was designated &quot;Muscle Shoals&quot;. In June 1968 it was renamed for the last time, becoming Operation Igloo White.

&quot;Igloo White&quot; consisted of three interrelated parts. The battery-operated sensors would be monitored by an airborne command and control center (ABCCC), which would relay the information to an infiltration surveillance center (ISC), located at Nakhon Phanom Air Base, Thailand. Computers at the ISC would collate and analyze the data and then relay target coordinates to the ABCCC which would, in turn, direct strike aircraft to the targets. The hand emplacement of sensors and bomb damage assessment missions were to be carried out by the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG), which already operated &quot;over the fence&quot; in Laos. Construction began on the ISC on 6 July 1967 and was completed within three months.

The anti-infiltration effort would be supported by MSQ-77 &quot;Combat Skyspot&quot;, a ground-based radar bombing system first introduced in Southeast Asia in 1966 to direct B-52 strikes in poor weather or in complete darkness. This system was utilized to direct one-quarter of all strike missions conducted by U.S. aircraft during the conflict. Combat Skyspot was complemented by expanding the radio-based LORAN system utilized by other strike aircraft.

A shakedown of the system took place during the first two weeks of November 1967 and it seemed to work. The PAVN siege of the U.S. Marines at the Khe Sanh Combat Base, in western Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, provided the opportunity for an operational test. The American command in Saigon launched Operation Niagara, the largest tactical and B-52 operation thus far in the conflict, to support the Marines at Khe Sanh. By the end of January 1968, &quot;Muscle Shoals&quot; had emplaced 316 sensors in 44 strings to detect PAVN troop movements in the vicinity of the combat base. The operation was deemed a success, but locating and targeting enemy troops moving toward a fixed location like Khe Sanh was not the same as doing it on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

And there were already problems with the system. The anti-personnel portion of the program had already failed. The presence and movements of enemy troops were to be detected by the utilization of small, wide-area Gravel mines that were to alert the acoustic sensors. The mines rapidly deteriorated in the heat and humidity of Laos, nullifying their effectiveness. The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks was about to begin.

== 1968 ==
The immediate result of 11 November bombing halt was that the average daily sortie rate over southern Laos rose to 620 per day before the new campaign had even begun. The freeing of aircraft (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) that had previously been participating in &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;, when combined with those from &quot;Steel Tiger&quot; and &quot;Tiger Hound&quot; (which were both superseded by &quot;Commando Hunt&quot;), promised to create an interdiction effort of unprecedented scale. The new sensor-directed effort would see, for the first time, continuous round-the-clock bombing of the communist logistical system. During daylight, the missions would be performed by propeller-driven and jet fighter-bombers and B-52s. At night, fixed-wing gunships would prowl for prey. The new effort would also be supported by aerial defoliation missions (Operation Ranch Hand) and the cloud seeding weather modification effort known as Operation Popeye (see Ho Chi Minh Trail). On 15 November 1968 the Seventh Air Force was granted authorization for launch of &quot;Commando Hunt&quot;.

It was decided to divide &quot;Commando Hunt&quot; into numerically designated phases that reflected the seasonal weather patterns in southern Laos. Odd numbered campaigns took place during PAVN&#x27;s high activity period, which occurred during the dry season (November–May). Even numbered campaigns took place during the more dormant wet season (June–October). It was never assumed that the campaigns would halt the North Vietnamese logistical effort, so the goals of the campaigns were limited. They were to have two objectives:
First, to reduce the enemy&#x27;s logistical flow by &quot;substantially increasing the time needed to move supplies from North Vietnam to the south;&quot; second, &quot;to destroy trucks and supply caches along the roads, pathways, and streams and in the truck parks and storage areas along the Trail.&quot;Due to the failure of the anti-personnel portion of the system, the targets of &quot;Commando Hunt&quot; were trucks, the infrastructure of the trail (truck parks, supply caches, POL storage, etc.), the terrain itself (by creating landslides to destroy sections of the system), and finally, the ever-increasing numbers of North Vietnamese anti-aircraft weapons.

It was a daunting challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) consisted of a labyrinth of dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.

== 1969 ==
By the end of &quot;Commando Hunt I&quot;, the first dry season offensive of the campaign (15 November 1968 to 20 April 1969), the Air Force estimated that 7,322 enemy trucks had been destroyed. At the rate of attrition claimed in December, however, the PAVN transportation network should have been destroyed in only a month and a half. It also claimed that 20,723 enemy had been killed by air, 15 percent of the total number believed to have been travelling on, operating, or defending the trail.&quot; 56 allied aircraft were shot down during the operation by an estimated 600 communist anti-aircraft weapons. The end of &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;, it seemed, had freed up not only U.S. aircraft, but also allowed more PAVN anti-aircraft units to move south to defend the trail. During the year the North Vietnamese began deploying longer-ranged and radar-directed 85 and 100 mm guns.

For the U.S. program there were teething troubles. There was a lack of sufficient numbers of sensor strings and controlling the number of aircraft available for the missions proved problematic. These difficulties could be remedied. &quot;Commando Hunt II&quot; (1 May through 31 October 1969), however, was thrown off track by phenomena that the Air Force could do absolutely nothing about. The first wet season offensive was hampered by atrocious weather, especially heavy rain (48 inches of rain in July alone).

The real problem for U.S. planners was a lack of sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer than 14 times during the same time period.

The Air Force&#x27;s computing of communist personnel losses, according to Air Force historian Bernard Nalty was &quot;based on so many assumptions that the end product represented an exercise in metaphysics rather than mathematics.&quot; He was seconded by historian Earl Tilford who explained that
Americans expected progress, or at least quantifiable measures of success...It is in their nature to do so. &quot;Commando Hunt&quot; provided the figures that sated that appetite. Productivity epitomized what the war had become: an exercise in management effectiveness.

It was, however, difficult for the Air Force to do otherwise. Observation of the trail from the air was difficult at best. Human intelligence was provided by CIA-backed Laotian irregulars and Thai volunteers operating from the western side of the system while the eastern side was covered by SOG. The depth of penetration by these reconnaissance efforts was hampered by the same man who had the last word in the bombing effort, Ambassador William H. Sullivan in Vientiane. The ambassador (with the full backing of the State Department and the CIA) maintained a firm hold over all military operations conducted within the supposedly &quot;neutral&quot; Kingdom of Laos. All targets had to be pre-approved either by Sullivan himself or by the air attaché within &quot;Project 404&quot;, the understaffed U.S. military operations center within the embassy.

By the end of the year the Americans felt that they were better prepared to deliver destruction to the trail system. During &quot;Commando Hunt III&quot; (1 November 1969 to 30 April 1970), the Air Force claimed that 6,428 enemy trucks destroyed and another 3,604 damaged. 60 aircraft were shot down during this phase of the campaign by an estimated 743 anti-aircraft weapons. This increased number of aircraft losses forced the Air Force to decree that flak suppression missions would accompany the bombers on missions over the trail. Armed with cluster bomb units (CBUs), the fighter bombers were poised to pounce upon any enemy anti-aircraft positions identified by other aircraft.

On the other side of the fence, the North Vietnamese transported and/or stored 70,000 tons of supplies in 3,000 trucks with a net loss of 13.5 percent during the year. During the same period about 80,000 PAVN troops made the trip south. A new North Vietnamese logistical effort, discovered by U.S. intelligence in late 1968, was a petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) pipeline running southwest from the North Vietnamese city of Vinh. By early the following year the pipeline had crossed the Laotian frontier and by summer it had reached Muong Nong and the approaches to the A Sầu Valley. The plastic line, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, could transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all in the same pipe.

== 1970 ==

From October 1969 until April 1970 (probably anticipating the loss of their Cambodian supply conduit) the North Vietnamese launched &quot;probably their most intense logistical effort of the whole war.&quot; The motivating factor became evident in April, when U.S. and South Vietnamese ground forces launched an incursion into the PAVN base areas lining the eastern border of Cambodia. Thousands of tons of food and munitions, including 7,000 tons of rice and weapons, were destroyed; as a result, PAVN operations were set back by an estimated 15 months. However, the U.S. also assumed an abiding responsibility for the survival of the Lon Nol regime, which remained dependent on US air support.

Missions conducted by CIA-backed Laotian irregulars and Thai volunteers operating on the western flank of the trail (and the Lon Nol coup in Cambodia) prompted PAVN to launch offensives in Laos to protect and expand their system. As a result, the North Vietnamese seized the towns of Saravane, Paksong, and Attopeu. Although fighting continued in these areas, what had once been a wide logistical corridor was now expanded to . Meanwhile, PAVN was also expanding its other methods of logistical transportation.

In 1967 U.S. recon photographs uncovered an unusual sight. POL barrels were spotted floating in the waters of the Kong River south of Ban Bak, Laos. Soon, PAVN was making use of the Banghiang River which flowed southwestward from the Demilitarized Zone all the way to the Mekong River, for the same purposes. The watertight drums were launched en masse from tributary streams into the main channel, floated downstream, and were recovered by systems of nets and booms. The Kaman River was added to the system in 1969. By 1970 the North Vietnamese were making intense use of streams and rivers to supplement their logistical route, especially in the rainy season, when the water levels rose and the roadways became impassable mires. During one two and one-half-month period during 1969, over 10,000 POL barrels were spotted in the waterways of southeastern Laos.

The Air Force estimated that during the year there were 3,375 trucks working the trail system in southern Laos, yet it claimed that 12,368 enemy trucks were destroyed during the year. During the same time frame, the CIA estimated that only 6,000 trucks existed in the entire North Vietnamese inventory. The buildup of PAVN anti-aircraft defenses continued to increase. During &quot;Commando Hunt III&quot; the Seventh and Thirteenth Air Force estimated that 700 23-mm and 37 mm weapons, most of them radar-guided, were defending the trail system in southern Laos.

Beginning in 1967 the Air Force had fielded a whole series of fixed-wing, side-firing gunships for nighttime interdiction missions. This evolution in aircraft was a &quot;dynamic reaction between opposing forces which led to a refinement of the tactics of employing round the clock interdiction and prompted development of specialized night attack systems.&quot;

As the operation progressed, newer technologies (low-light television cameras, infrared vision devices, side-looking radars, radar jamming equipment, and computer-directed fire control systems) were also fielded to improve the performance of these aircraft. The apex of these developments was reached by the deployment of the AC-130E &quot;Spectre&quot;, a conversion of the venerable C-130 Hercules cargo transport, in February 1968. By 1970 the &quot;Spectre&quot; had become the most formidable weapon platform fielded by the Air Force in its war against trucks. The PAVN 377 Air Division&#x27;s history notes &quot;Just one hour when AC-130s did not operate over our chokepoints was both precious and rare.&quot;

== 1971 ==

During &quot;Commando Hunt V&quot; (10 October 1970 to 30 April 1971) Air Force intelligence claimed 16,266 trucks destroyed and another 7,700 damaged during the dry season offensive. The Seventh Air Force headquarters in Saigon, chagrined by the enormity of the figures, recomputed them and lowered the estimate to 11,000 destroyed and 8,000 damaged. In fact, there were only 2,500–3,000 PAVN trucks operating on the trail during 1970–1971, each carrying approximately four tons of materiel.

77,000 combat sorties were flown during the offensive while the number of communist anti-aircraft weapons defending it reached 1,500. Although only 11 aircraft were brought down by air defense fire during the dry season, this lower level of destroyed aircraft was not the result of any U.S. countermeasures. The lower figures were attributed to the fact that many PAVN air defense units had been moved to the Tchepone area to support the counteroffensive against the South Vietnamese Operation Lam Son 719.

The interdiction effort during &quot;Commando Hunt VI&quot; (15 May through 31 October 1971) was thrown off by Lam Son 719 during April and May. During the offensive, 80 percent of all U.S. aerial sorties were directed to support it. This highlighted what was now rapidly becoming a dual dilemma for the Air Force: First, the gradual withdrawal of U.S. forces from Southeast Asia meant that there were fewer and fewer air assets available with which to conduct more and more missions. During &quot;Commando Hunt&quot;, for example, 1,777 aircraft were utilized during the campaign. By the time of the opening of &quot;Commando Hunt VI&quot;, that figure had decreased to 1,199 aircraft and this number dropped to 953 before that phase was completed; Second, this state of affairs was exacerbated by the withdrawal of sorties to conduct missions for Operation Freedom Deal in Cambodia.

During the year the North Vietnamese transported or stored 60,000 tons of supplies with a net loss rate of 2.07 percent. During the same period, 195,000 PAVN replacements moved through the system to the southern battlefields. As during the previous year, PAVN continued to expand the system. By the end of May the North Vietnamese had occupied Muong Phalane, Ban Houei Sai, and Paksong. They also retook Attopeu, Saravane, and Ban Thateng, cementing their hold on the strategic Bolovens Plateau of south central Laos. &quot;Commando Hunt VI&quot;, launched during the wet season, was hampered by heavy rain and the arrival of two typhoons which threw off both the PAVN logistical effort and U.S. attempts to interdict it.

== 1972 ==

Air Force planners believed that Operation Commando Hunt VII (1 November 1971 to 29 March 1972) would be the most fruitful of the entire campaign. During this dry season phase, the U.S. averaged 182 attack fighters, 13 fixed-wing gunships, and 21 B-52 sorties per day. As a result of this all-out effort, U.S. intelligence analysts claimed 10,689 North Vietnamese trucks were destroyed and credited AC-130E Spectres alone with 7,335 of these kills. During the campaign, however, ominous signs appeared in the mountains of Laos. On 10 January 1972, a U.S. O–1 observation aircraft, flying near the Mu Gia Pass, dodged the first surface-to-air missile(SAM) launched from Laotian soil. This event, and others like it, were compounded by the crossing into Laotian airspace of North Vietnamese MiG fighters. Both of these threats tended to force off B-52 and tactical air strikes. During the campaign, ten American aircraft were lost to SAMs (mostly SA-2 Guidelines) and another thirteen were lost to more conventional weapons.

One new innovation that took place during the campaign was renewed interest in personnel infiltration. This aspect of the PAVN effort had been virtually ignored since the initiation of the &quot;Commando Hunt&quot; in 1968. An intelligence collection and technical reassessment effort invited the Air Force to make another attempt to force the North Vietnamese pay for their effort in blood instead of in imported supplies and trucks. The result was &quot;Island Tree&quot; the launching of a personnel anti-infiltration effort during &quot;Commando Hunt VII.&quot; However, it was too little and far too late.

American analysts were elated when they discovered that the number of trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate that the enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the &quot;Nguyen Hue Offensive&quot; (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive), they probably reflected anticipated losses.

&quot;Commando Hunt VII&quot; came to a close with the launching of the PAVN offensive mentioned above. This conventional attack, backed by armor, heavy artillery, and anti-aircraft units (including SAMs) rolled over the two northernmost provinces of South Vietnam while two smaller offensives were launched in central and southern parts of the country. All U.S. and South Vietnamese air assets were diverted to first slowing, and then halting the onslaught. They were then utilized in the first sustained bombing of North Vietnam since late 1968 (see Operation Linebacker). Interdiction missions were then diverted to carry out an even heavier aerial offensive against the north (see Operation Linebacker II). The end was nigh for &quot;Commando Hunt&quot;. With the signing of the Paris Peace Accord in March 1973, the Vietnam War finally came to an end for the U.S.

== Conclusion ==
The goal of the &quot;Commando Hunt&quot; campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to make the North Vietnamese pay too heavy a price for their effort. Corollary to this was the destruction of as much of their logistical system as possible and to tie down as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign&#x27;s failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure of an enormous amount of ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure was never going to be sufficient to deter Hanoi from its goal.

This failure had three sources. First, there were the political constraints imposed by Washington that limited the entire American effort in Southeast Asia (the continued fiction of Laotian and Cambodian &quot;neutrality&quot;, failure to disrupt the trail with U.S. ground forces when it would have made a difference, etc.) The second source of the failure was the utilization of what Colonel Charles Morrison has called &quot;over-sophisticated methods&quot; against &quot;elemental systems.&quot; The primitive logistical needs of the North Vietnamese (at least until the final phase of the conflict) allowed them to slip under the radar of their more technologically sophisticated enemy. Finally, all of the above were exacerbated by the communists&#x27; enviable ability to adapt their doctrine and tactics and to turn weaknesses into strengths.

The interdiction effort (like the entire American effort in Vietnam) became focused on statistics as a measure of success and &quot;devolved from considered tactics to meaningless ritual.&quot; At the end of the &quot;Commando Hunt&quot; campaigns the Air Force intelligence service claimed that 51,000 trucks and 3,400 anti-aircraft guns were destroyed in all seven operations. Statistics, however, proved no substitute for strategy and, &quot;for all the perceived success in that numbers game, the Air Force succeeded only in fooling itself into believing that &quot;Commando Hunt&quot; was working. Regardless of the constant American belief that its enemy was on the verge of collapse, PAVN maintained and expanded its logistical flow to combat units in the field and managed to launch major offensives in 1968 and 1972 and a counteroffensive in 1971. The North Vietnamese built, maintained, and expanded, under a deluge of bombs, over 3,000 kilometers of roads and paths through the mountains and jungles while only two percent of the troops sent south were killed by the American effort to halt their infiltration into South Vietnam.

<text>The Equal Rights Party was a Canadian political party that ran candidates in elections in Ontario in 1890 and 1891.

It ran a joint Liberal-Equal Rights candidate in the 1890 Ontario general election.

The party nominated two candidates in the 5 March 1891 federal election.

Samuel Grandy, running in Durham East riding in Ontario, won 1,685 of the 3,431 votes cast (49.11% of the popular votes), losing narrowly to Conservative Party candidate Thomas Dixon Craig, who collected 1,746 votes.

The other Equal Rights Party candidate, W.H. Lewis, was less successful, collecting only 770 of the 9,450 votes cast (8.15% of the popular vote) in the City of Ottawa riding, which was a two-member constituency.

The Equal Rights party may have been associated with Dalton McCarthy, leader of the McCarthyites, a group of 10 candidates who ran in the 1896 election.

<text>The Santal (or Santhal) are an Austroasiatic-speaking Munda ethnic group of the Indian subcontinent. Santals are the largest tribe in the Jharkhand and West Bengal in terms of population and are also found in the states of Odisha, Bihar, Assam and Tripura. They are the largest ethnic minority in northern Bangladesh&#x27;s Rajshahi Division and Rangpur Division. They have a sizeable population in Nepal. The Santals speak Santali, the most widely spoken Munda languages of Austroasiatic language family.

== Etymology ==
Santal is most likely derived from an exonym. The term refers to inhabitants of in erstwhile Silda in Medinapore region in West Bengal. The Sanskrit word &quot;Samant&quot; or Bengali &quot;Saont&quot; means plain land. Their ethnonym is (&quot;child of human&quot;).

==History==
=== Origins ===
According to linguist Paul Sidwell, Austro-Asiatic language speakers probably arrived on coast of Odisha from Indochina about 4,000–3,500 years ago ( BCE). The Austroasiatic speakers spread from Southeast Asia and mixed extensively with local Indian populations.

Due to the lack of significant archaeological records, the original homeland of the Santhals is not known with certainty. The folklore of the Santhals claims they came from , which scholars have identified as Ahuri in Hazaribagh district. From there, they claim, they were pushed onto Chhota Nagpur Plateau, then to Jhalda, Patkum and finally Saont, where they settled for good. According to Dalton, where they were renamed to Santal from cluster name Kharwar. This legend, which has been cited by several scholars, has been used as evidence that the Santals once had a significant presence in Hazaribagh. Colonial scholar Colonel Dalton claimed in Chai there was a fort formerly occupied by a Santal raja who was forced to flee when the Delhi Sultanate invaded the territory.

=== British Era ===
In the latter half of the 18th century, the Santals entered the historical record in 1795 when they are recorded as &quot;Soontars&quot;. During the Bengal Famine of 1770, the drier western and southwestern parts of Bengal, especially the Jungle Mahals region, were some of the worst-hit areas and were significantly depopulated. This depopulation resulted in a significant loss of revenue for the East India Company. Therefore, when the Permanent Settlement was enacted in 1790, the Company looked for agriculturalists to clear the lands. British officials turned their attention to Santals, who were ready to clear the forest for the practice of settled agriculture. In 1832, a large number of area of the Raj Mahal hills demarcated as Damin-i-koh. Santal from Cuttack, Dhalbhum, Birbhum, Manbhum, Hazaribagh migrated and started cultivating these lands as peasants sponsored by landowners and the British who were desperate for labour. Under British direction, Santals took loans from non-Santal moneylenders to buy iron tools, seed grain and oxen as individuals and families, rather than groups as was their custom for working the land.

When they arrived in Damin-i-koh (present day Santal Pargana), the British provided no protection for the Santals against the preexisting Mal Paharias, who were against destruction of forest, were known raiders of the plains areas and had only recently been partially &quot;pacified&quot;. Eventually, the Santals, with their better technology and ability to match the Paharia&#x27;s guerrilla attacks, managed to drive them out. They clear the forest tracts and started cultivation in these areas. Their settlement took place between the 1830s and 1850s: in 1830, the area was home to only 3,000 Santals, but by the 1850s, 83,000 Santals had settled in the land and had turned it into paddy fields. This resulted in a 22 times increase in Company revenue from the area.

However, as they became more agricultural, the Santals were exploited by the zamindars. Unlike the Santals, the British valued individual competition instead of cooperation, and had a rigid system of laws very different from the relatively relaxed norms of the village council, the highest form of government most Santals knew. Mahajans from Bengal and Baniyas from Bihar began selling goods from elsewhere, and many Santals, seeing them as exotic, were tricked into debt to buy them, usually with a mortgage on their land. When the Santals were unable to pay the moneylenders back, they became owners of the land and the Santals became dispossessed landless peasants. The Baniya merchants and other outsiders also began to treat Santals as outcastes in a Brahminical system.

Eventually, these acts of exploitation, combined with British tax policies and corrupt tax collectors, deteriorated to the point where Santals grew discontented. In 1855, they revolted in the Santal rebellion, better known as the . 30,000 Santals, led by Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, attacked the zamindars and other outsiders () who had made their lives so miserable, as well as the British authorities. Eventually, around 10,000 British troops managed to suppress the rebellion. Although the rebellion&#x27;s impact was largely overshadowed by that of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the impact of the Santhal Rebellion lives on as a turning point in Santhal pride and identity. This was reaffirmed, over a century and a half later with the creation of the tribal province in the Republic of India, Jharkhand. Following the rebellion, the British satisfied all Santhal demands, due to their importance as a tax-paying group. The British created a 5000 km2 area, called Santal Parganas, where the normal procedures of British India did not apply. Administration of the community was primarily made the responsibility of the village headman, or pradhan, who was also given the power to collect taxes. It was made illegal for Santals to transfer land to non-Santals, allowing them to have legal rights over their land.

After the British Crown formally took control over India in 1858, the Santals continued their system of government and traditions. Newly established Christian missions brought education, and many Santals moved to the tea plantations in Assam, North Bengal, where they still remain today. However, most continued with their old life, but were still not prosperous. In addition, secular education did not become widespread until after Indian independence.

In the late 19th century, many Santals migrated from the Santal Parganas to the districts of Bihar and North Bengal such as Purnia, Malda and Dinajpur. The Santals still faced retaliation after the Santal Hul and were invited by zamindars to cultivate many parts of north Bengal, which had become scrubland, land which the Santals specialized in farming. By the 1930s, their numbers in this region the Santals had become two lakh. Most were settled on wasteland where the rent was cheaper than the more fertile wet lands. However they faced heavy taxation from the zamindars, and were oppressed by moneylenders, upper castes, and the bureaucracy in general. In 1924, several Santal sardars, influenced by Gandhian ideology and led by Jitu Sardar, began to lead agitations against the oppressive double system of elite Bengalis and British government. Santals stopped paying rent to the zamindars, beat up revenue inspectors, and led agitations against the moneylenders. In 1928, the Santals stopped paying the chaukidari tax and led protests in Thakurgaon in 1929. In 1932, several Santals attempted to organise their own state with Jitu Sardar as head, initially based on Gandhi&#x27;s Ram Rajya but quickly criticised Gandhi when he did not help them. In 1933, a British commissioner was appointed to look into the grievances of Santals of North Bengal.

=== Post-independence ===
The Santal community, like the others of the region, was split between West Bengal in India and East Bengal in Pakistan during Partition. After independence, the Santals were made one of the Scheduled Tribes in India. In East Pakistan, there were some regions in the west where Santals were still in significant numbers. There and in neighbouring West Bengal, the Santals provided significant support to the Tebhaga movement. After the Pakistani military crushed the uprising and burned many Santal homes, many fled across the border to Malda in India.

In northern West Bengal, tribal peasants participated in Naxalbari uprising led by a Santal communist leader Jangal Santhal. The impoverishment has led to the Guevarist inspired Naxalite insurgency in what is often termed as the Red Corridor.

After Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar in 2000, the Santal Parganas was made a separate division of the state. These Santals have also agitated for recognition of their traditions in the census as a separate religion, &quot;sarna dharam&quot;, for which Jharkhand assembly passed a resolution in 2020. Many still face poverty and exploitation, and in Bangladesh, theft of their lands is common. Although spread out over a large area, they now consider the Santal Parganas as their cultural heartland.

== Society ==
The base of Santal society is a division between &quot;sibling&quot; () and &quot;guest&quot; (), a divide found in many other tribal societies of central and eastern India. Children of the same father (sometimes grandfather), known as , often live next to each other and own adjacent pieces of land. Those in the closest form of brotherhood, called (&quot;people of one house&quot;) in Singhbhum, cannot marry each other and propitiate the same deity, since the house refers to a common ancestor from which all the families are believed to descend. Only marriages are severely stigmatised. Another brotherhood is membership of a clan, which are exogamous. The last form of brotherhood is , a ritual friendship with members of other ethnic groups. Children of brothers consider themselves as brothers, and they attend each other&#x27;s main lifecycle events, such as weddings or funerals, as . They also give help in times of hardship.

Those who do not have brotherhood are referred to as , or guests. Members of other communities, especially those not speaking Santali, are excluded from this grouping, except for communities such as the Karmakar, Mahali or Lohar of their locality, who are enmeshed in Santal society. Those with this relationship can marry, and attend major festivals as guests. People related by marriage, although , have special roles in life-cycle events. Women perform special welcome rituals for when they visit. Those related by marriage can have one of two relationships. They can be , a relationship exemplified by the couple&#x27;s parents, or , between cross-siblings of a couple.

Santal society has much less stratification and is more egalitarian than adjacent caste Hindu society, but still has some status differences. The most important marker of a person when interacting with others in Santal society is their standing as (&quot;senior&quot;) or (&quot;junior&quot;). This standing is evaluated by relation: for example, is someone is greeting their father&#x27;s elder brother&#x27;s son, they would be the junior irrespective of age. Similarly, when someone greets their elder brother&#x27;s wife, the wife would be . However, for strangers or guests with no clear kin connections, the question of or is decided by age. The ritual greeting ( in Santali) of someone is given much importance and is done in the courtyard of a house when a visits. The greeting differs by gender, and whether the person is junior or senior to the one being greeted. The greeting rituals given by a involve an &quot;offering&quot; () of respect, while a &quot;receives&quot; this respect. This greeting should not be done hastily, and correct practice of it is encouraged in children from a young age. However the - distinction does not apply to or , who instead greet each other as if greeting a .

The Santals also have totemistic clans, known as . These 12 clans are divided into two ranks: 7 senior and 5 junior. The senior clans are believed to originate from the 7 sons and daughters of the first man and woman, and in order of seniority they are: (goose), (Nilgai), (&quot;Ischaemum rugosum&quot;), (kingfisher), (Pleiades), (betel palm) and (owl). The junior clans are Baskey or Baske (stale rice), (falcon), Chorey or Chonre (lizard), Pauria or Pawria (pigeon) and Bediya. Members of a senior clan do not marry members of a junior clan, and there are some forbidden marriages as well, such as between Marandi and Kisku. In addition, Besras are sometimes treated differently due to their perceived low status, but other than the context of marriage, they play no role in social life. The clans also avoid harming their clan totem, lest evil befall them.

The Santals have another social organisation important for rituals, called , or in south Chota Nagpur. The term refers to descendants of a common ancestor, no more than a few generations back, that live nearby. The is identified by some distinguishing feature of the ancestor, such as , people who wear a thread on their chest in worship. In many cases, all the people of a live in their ancestral village, but some members may have migrated to neighbouring villages.

== Culture ==
=== Festivals ===
Sohrai is the principal festival of Santal community. Besides that Baha, Karam, Dashain, Sakrat, Mahmore, Rundo and Magsim are important festivals. They traditionally accompany many of their dances during these festivals with two drums: the Tamak‘ and the Tumdak’.


Chadar Badar, a form of puppetry known also as Santal puppetry, is a folk show involving wooden puppets placed in a small cage which acts as the stage.

Local affairs are handled by a village council, led by a &quot;&quot;.

The walls of traditional Santal homes are ornamented with carved designs of animals, hunting scenes, dancing scenes, and geometric patterns. Santal bridal palanquins are also finely carved.
=== Marriage ===
There are seven kinds of marriage recognized in the Santal community, each with its own degree of social acceptance. The most elaborate kind of marriage is the , or ancestor&#x27;s marriage, but the most widely practiced is . In this form of marriage, a boy and girl who wish to marry decide to go to the groom&#x27;s house and stay there a while. When the girl&#x27;s family are made aware of their situation, the of the girl&#x27;s village arrives at the house of the headman of the boy&#x27;s village to discover the couple&#x27;s intentions. The couple are summoned to the village headman and the bride is asked whether she wishes to set a date for . If she replies &#x27;no&#x27;, the boy&#x27;s family will have to pay a small fine to the of the girl&#x27;s village, who would take the girl back to her father. If she assents, the boy&#x27;s family is consulted for the best day for the . The bride and groom are not bound by any obligation to marry. During this time, the stays in the village to give all the information he can to the bride&#x27;s father: both in determining what would be a good bride price to demand and whether the marriage might end in a short time.

On the day of the ceremony, a group of men from the bride&#x27;s village, including the , headman, village elders, and the bride&#x27;s father and some relations, arrives at the bride&#x27;s village. They are seated at the headman&#x27;s house with respect and organized by or status. Meanwhile, the groom&#x27;s family gathers to discuss the bride price the groom&#x27;s father should pay. The two parties then meet and the fathers negotiate the bride price to be paid. The groom is first asked whether he wishes the marriage to continue. As a symbolic marriage contract, the groom&#x27;s father gives a small amount of cash and gives (rice-beer) to the guests. The negotiations for bride-price continue between the fathers exclusively until an amount is reached. Although this is nowadays in cash, livestock or other goods are not uncommon. The bride price is generally light and it is seen wrong to stop two young people from marrying because of a disagreement about bride price. After an agreement is reached, celebrations ensue and festive drinking continues into the night.

A short time afterwards, a relative of the groom along with the of the groom&#x27;s village hand over the bride price to the bride&#x27;s family. Afterwards the couple arrive in the bride&#x27;s natal village. The bride arriving first carrying a pot with white clay, the symbol of a woman returning to her natal village as a guest. The bride greets her mother first and neighbours are invited to share reserved for (), while getting acquainted with the husband. When the couple leaves the bride&#x27;s village, the bride pays her respects to the headman in his courtyard. At the , the bride thanks the headman for all he has done and gives a symbolic gift. The headman then blesses the couple and wishes the bride strength, good luck and many strong sons. The couple then leaves for the groom&#x27;s village to start their new life.

Marriages done by involve very little ritual: Santal society has clearly defined roles for marriage, and the choice of the couple is respected. Decisions by the families are done in a spirit of consensus rather than adversarially, and marriage is seen just as important for the entire village as for the couple.

== Religion ==
The Santal are granted Scheduled Tribe status in five states: Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Tripura, where they account for a total population of 6,570,807 according to the 2011 Census of India. Of this population, 63.15% are reported as Hindu, 23% as Sarna, 7.28% as Sari Dharam (all in West Bengal), and 5.46% as Christian. Other minor religious affiliations include Bidin (27,602), Muslim (13,014), Santal (4,771), Sumra Sandhi (2,059), Sarvdharm (1,625), Buddhist (1,121), Adi Bassi (1,100), Sikh (987), Kharwar (385), Sant (356), Saran (352), Jain (348), Achinthar (273), Sarin (185), Marangboro (167), Saranath (157), Seran (125), Adi (84), and Alchichi (78). Additionally, 102 were &quot;Atheist&quot;, 331 were believers of &quot;Tribal religion&quot;, 1,123 followed other unclassified religions, and 16,974 did not state any religious affiliation.

According to the doctrine of Sari Dharam (a religion based on truths), the Santals are broadly divided into three categories: &quot;Um-hor&quot;, followers of Christianity; &quot;Saka-hor&quot;, followers of Hinduism; and &quot;Bonga-hor&quot;, followers of Sari Dharam. While Sari Dharam is predominantly observed in West Bengal, Santals in other states commonly identify their religious practices under the framework of Sarna Dharam, an umbrella term for tribal religions. Historically, the Santals practiced their autonomous religious beliefs without assigning specific nomenclature to their faith. From the beginning of census operations in India, they mobilized into various religious-political movements, identifying under names such as &quot;Santal&quot;, &quot;Adibasi&quot;, &quot;Jaher&quot;, &quot;Sohrai&quot;, &quot;Sari&quot;, and &quot;Sarna&quot;, to distinguish themselves from the prevalent religions of India, such as Hinduism and Christianity. Although, those beliefs denomination were administratively clubbed together as Animism in the colonial census. Post-independence, the census publishes macro-level &quot;de facto&quot; data, specifically for the scheduled communities; thus, there has been a tendency toward revivalism and unification of diverse religious identities among them, with many Santals aligning under the banners of Sarna Dharma, except for the Santals of West Bengal. They regarded it as having more political motives than religious ones and adhered to their own developed religion, named Sari Dharma, based on their ancestral ethics, values, and beliefs. In fact, in the 1961 census, except for Hinduism, most Santals identified their religion by their own ethnic identity, &quot;Santhal&quot;, while others identified with various beliefs, including Sari and Sarna Dharma. Later, in the 1971 census, the Santhal religion was replaced by Sarna Dharma, a religious identity that only a few Santals had identified with in previous censuses, and the shift was primarily attributed to the Jharkhand statehood movement. However, while all those terms differ in nomenclature from a religio-political perspective, in practice, they reflect a synthesis of ancestral autonomous beliefs and elements of dominant religions like Hinduism and Christianity. 

In the religious beliefs of Santals, the core of reverence falls on a court of spirits (), who handle different aspects of the world and who are placated with prayers and offerings. These benevolent spirits operate at the village, household, ancestor, and sub-clan level, along with evil spirits that cause disease and can inhabit village boundaries, mountains, water, tigers, and the forest. The are intermediaries between (visible world) and (the invisible reality), the abode of a Creator. This creator is variously called &quot;Marang Buru&quot; (Supreme Deity or literally The Great Mountain) or (life giver), and is the &quot;cause of all causes,&quot; making the Santal religion, in a deep sense, monotheistic as well as pantheistic.

There are several ranks of : the most important are associated intimately with Marang Buru and are worshipped by all Santals. These include , and . Other , who are held to be less powerful, are the spirits of important people of the village who have since been deified. There is also another class of who are feared as bringers of evil. These spirits are not placated by a priest but by a medicine-man called . In the present-day, belief in these malignant is eroding due to the penetration of modern medical science. The lack of a separate name for malignant caused many early colonial scholars to present Santal religion as wholly focused on the appeasement of evil spirits or as representing bongas as exclusively harmful. However in itself simply means a supernatural force in the world and has no specific connotation with good or evil. Moreover, these bongas do not refer to specific objects but to the invisible force that governs or is associated with those objects.

The Santal creation story holds that originally the world was water, and Marang Buru and some lesser deities were the only inhabitants. When some spirits requested permission to make humans, Marang Buru asked to create the human bodies. When she had finally succeeded, she was told by Marang Buru to use the human spirits that were high on the rafters of his hut. She could not reach the human spirit, and took the bird spirit instead. When Marang Buru integrated the spirits with the bodies, they flew away and asked for a place to build a nest. Marang Buru could not get anyone else to bring land to the surface, and so the tortoise volunteered and pushed the Earth onto his back. The birds then gave birth to a boy and a girl called and . These two had seven sons and seven daughters, but the couple soon had a quarrel and separated. Pilchu Haram and his sons became great hunters, and on a time came upon the daughters, who had become maidens and were unrecognisable. They became introduced and made love. Looking for his sons, Pilchu Haram discovered an old woman and asked for fire, and upon talking to her more, he discovered his wife and reconciled with her. Another version tells how Pilchu Budhi was in fact in tears at her daughters&#x27; disappearance, but Marang Buru reassured her that they were all safe and brought her to reconcile with her husband. When their sons found out they had married their sisters, they were very angry and would have killed their parents if Marang Buru had not hidden them in a cave, where they stayed for the rest of their days. The children of these seven couples became the progenitors of the Santal clans.

A characteristic feature of a Santal village is a sacred grove (known as ) on the edge of the village where many spirits live and where a series of annual festivals take place. This grove is set aside in the founding of the village and left undisturbed except at times of festival. Inside is set a series of natural (uncut) stones which represent the bongas, but are not substitutes except during festival. The , a raised mound of earth covered with a thatched roof outside the headman&#x27;s house, is where the Majhi&#x27;s ancestors&#x27; spirits live. During the summer, a jug of water is placed there so the spirits can drink. Here the most important decisions of the village are made, including judgements.

A yearly round of rituals connected with the agricultural cycle, along with life-cycle rituals for birth, marriage and burial at death, involves petitions to the spirits and offerings that include the sacrifice of animals, usually birds. Religious leaders are male specialists in medical cures who practice divination and witchcraft (the socio-historic meaning of the term, used here, refers to the ritual practice of magic and is not pejorative). Similar beliefs are common among other tribes on the Chota Nagpur Plateau like the Kharia, Munda, and Oraon.

Smaller and more isolated tribes often demonstrate less articulated classification systems of the spiritual hierarchy described as animism or a generalised worship of spiritual energies connected with locations, activities, and social groups. Religious concepts are intricately entwined with ideas about nature and interaction with local ecological systems. As in Santal religion, religious specialists are drawn from the village or family and serve a wide range of spiritual functions that focus on placating potentially dangerous spirits and co-ordinating rituals.

=== Schedule Tribe status ===

The Santhal people are constitutionally designated as Scheduled Tribes only in Fifth Schedule areas, such as Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, and Tripura. While the Santals, who migrated from Fifth Schedule areas to Sixth Schedule areas, specifically to Assam as tea garden laborers during the British Raj, are not considered Scheduled Tribes. Instead, they are classified as Other Backward Class in Assam, and the remaining population living in other states is considered part of the general population. The inclusion in Schedule Tribe list have been opposed by respective states and tribal activists organization following Sixth Scheduled autonomy, such as the Coordination Committee of Tribal Organizations of Assam (CCTOA). The organisation feared up that granting Scheduled Tribe status to the Santal and other 40 migrated tribal communities will squeeze up the benefits of natives, the &quot;original tribal people&quot; of the state.

=== Religion status ===

The Santhal people believe in nature worship, and their place of worship is in sacred groves known as &quot;Jaher&quot; and &quot;Sarna&quot;, in contrast to Hindu places of worship in temples. They also perform animal sacrifices to honor their gods and accept flesh, including beef and pork, practices that are generally prohibited in Hinduism. Thus they consider themselves believers of Sari and Sarna religion rather than Hinduism. Although there is overlap of ideology, belief, culture and practices in between Sarnasim and Hinduism.

<text>Spy Hunter is a vehicular combat game developed by Bally Midway and released for arcades in 1983. The game draws inspiration from the James Bond films and was originally supposed to carry the James Bond brand. The object of the game is to drive down roads in the technologically advanced &quot;Interceptor&quot; car and destroy various enemy vehicles with a variety of onboard weapons. &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; was produced in both sit-down and standard upright versions with the latter being more common. The game&#x27;s controls consist of a steering wheel in the form of a futuristic aircraft-style yoke with several special-purpose buttons, a two-position stick shift (offering &#x27;low&#x27; and &#x27;high&#x27; gears), and a pedal used for acceleration.

&quot;Spy Hunter&quot; was a commercial success in American arcades, where it was one of the top five highest-grossing arcade games of 1984 and 1985. It was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit computers, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Apple II, ColecoVision, MS-DOS, Nintendo Entertainment System, and BBC Micro. &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; was followed by &quot;Spy Hunter II&quot;, which added a 3D view and two-player split-screen play, a pinball tie-in, and a successor series of games bearing the &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; name. In addition, the NES received a sequel titled Super Spy Hunter.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Spy Hunter&quot; is a vertical scrolling driving game with the player in the role of a spy driving an armed sportscar. The object of the game is to travel the freeway destroying as many enemy vehicles as possible while protecting civilian vehicles. The game uses a top-down perspective. Controls consist of a two-position gearshift lever, a floor-mounted accelerator pedal, and a steering yoke with five buttons, and the cabinet also includes a dashboard with status lights.

The game begins with the player driving the fictitious G-6155 Interceptor, using the yoke, pedal, and gearshift to steer and control speed. The car is equipped with a machine gun that has unlimited ammunition and can be fired by pressing and holding the corresponding button on the yoke. 

Various enemy vehicles try to destroy the player&#x27;s car or force it off the road, including a helicopter that drops bombs from overhead. A counter increments the score while the car is moving and on the road. Additional points are earned by destroying enemy vehicles using weapons or forcing them off the road. After an initial lead-in time during which the player has an unlimited supply of cars, the player must earn extra cars by reaching score thresholds. Destroying non-enemy cars halts the score counter for a short while, and no points are scored whenever the player&#x27;s car is off the road. The car can be destroyed by a hard collision with another vehicle, if it is hit by an enemy weapon (including the craters blasted into the road by the helicopter&#x27;s bombs), or by running far enough off the roadway (or waterway).

Following periodic forks in the road, the player can enter new regions with different terrain or weather conditions. The player can also acquire special weapons by entering a weapons van, which appears in each new territory and can be periodically summoned by pressing its button on the yoke when its dashboard light is flashing. Available special weapons consist of oil slicks, smoke screens, and surface-to-air missiles; each is controlled by a different button, and the dashboard lights indicate which ones are available at any given time. Special weapons have a limited ammunition supply and are lost whenever the player&#x27;s car is destroyed.

At certain points, the player will have the option to convert the car into a speedboat for a brief time by driving through a boathouse; at others, the player will be forced to make the transition. Enemy boats can attack from in front or behind, and the helicopter can drop bombs from above. While in speedboat mode, the oil slick becomes a flamethrower, while the smoke screen and missiles remain unchanged. 

The game has no ending, and play continues until the player has lost all cars.

==Development==
Game designer George Gomez drew inspiration for the game from listening to an audio cassette tape of music from James Bond films. He designed the game with Tom Leon, with whom he had worked on &quot;Tron&quot;. Gomez sketched out the in-game road map on a long scroll of drawing paper and also came up with the idea of the weapons van. Originally the game was to be based directly on James Bond and have the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; as in-game music, but the license could not be acquired. Instead, an electronic arrangement of Henry Mancini&#x27;s theme to &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; plays throughout.

==Reception==

In the United States, it topped the &quot;RePlay&quot; upright arcade cabinet charts for four months during 1984, in April, September, October and November. It also topped the &quot;Play Meter&quot; dedicated cabinet charts for street locations in July 1984 and November 1984. It was listed by AMOA as one of America&#x27;s top five highest-grossing arcade games of 1984, with AMOA later giving it the award for &quot;most played&quot; arcade video game of 1985 in the United States. In 1995, Flux magazine ranked the arcade version 29th on their Top 100 Video Games. They praised the game music, controls and gameplay.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; scored the ColecoVision version 80% in 1989.

==Legacy==

A pinball table based on &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; was released in 1984 by Bally.

The arcade game was ported to the ColecoVision in January 1985.

The original &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; was followed by an arcade sequel, &quot;Spy Hunter II&quot; in 1987. It retained the &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; music and incorporated a cooperative two-player mode, but the top-down view was replaced with a perspective from behind and above the car.

After Japanese video game developer Sunsoft ported &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; to the Nintendo Entertainment System, the company created &quot;Battle Formula&quot; with similar gameplay. Sunsoft America signed a deal with Bally Midway to release it outside Japan as Super Spy Hunter.

The series was reprised in 2001 with &quot;SpyHunter&quot; developed by Paradigm Entertainment and published by Midway Games for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Microsoft Windows. A sequel developed by Angel Studios was released in 2003. Another reboot of the series was developed by TT Fusion for the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita and released by Warner Bros. Interactive in October 2012.

&quot;Spy Hunter&quot; was cloned as &quot;Major Motion&quot;, released by Microdeal for the Atari ST in 1986. &quot;Agent Intercept&quot; (2019) for Apple Arcade is an homage to &quot;Spy Hunter&quot;.

In the 2015 toys-to-life video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, the Midway Arcade level pack includes a buildable Lego G-6155 Interceptor. A playable emulation of the arcade version is also included as part of the pack. The player character from &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; also appears as part of a sidequest where the player has to destroy 20 cars in the Super Sprint racetrack.

The 2022 video game &quot;Gotham Knights&quot; includes a playable emulated version of the game as an easter egg.

===Re-releases===
&quot;Spy Hunter&quot; was included in &quot;Midway&#x27;s Greatest Arcade Hits: Volume 1&quot; for Nintendo 64; &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;, a 2003 compilation of arcade games available for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows; &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play&quot; for PlayStation Portable; and &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot;, a 2012 compilation available for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

===In popular culture===
* In the &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; episode titled &quot;Hit, Run and Homicide&quot;, Jessica realizes the solution to the episode&#x27;s mystery while playing &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; in the Cabot Cove grocery store.
* &quot;Dev Hunter&quot;, a game made in the style of &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; is included as an Easter egg in the first release of Microsoft Excel 2000. It requires DirectX to work. Shortly after Excel 2000&#x27;s release, Microsoft officially banned Easter eggs from its non-game software.
* In the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;Dragon Nuts&quot;, a spoof of &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; is featured in the sketch &quot;Omaha&#x27;s Number 1 News Team&quot;. The news station&#x27;s traffic copter films two police cruisers in pursuit of the sports car from &quot;Spy Hunter&quot;, which failed to yield for a routine traffic stop. The sports car causes the cruisers to crash using its smoke screen generator, boards the weapon truck, equips itself with its surface-to-air missile launcher, uses it to destroy a helicopter, and the driver, tailed by several more police cruisers, escapes in a speedboat.
* &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; is parodied in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode &quot;Video Game References&quot;, as when it is Cyborg&#x27;s turn to use the virtual reality system, he goes inside an arcade game called &quot;Pie Hunter&quot;, whose name is a reference to &quot;Spy Hunter&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
In the summer of 2003, Universal Pictures acquired the rights to the arcade game &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; from Midway Games. The following September, Universal signed actor Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson to star in the film adaptation based on the game. Screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas were hired to write the screenplay, though a director had not been decided at the time. &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; was slated to begin its budgeted $90 million production in spring 2004 in time for a summer 2005 release. In January 2004, screenwriters Mark Swift and Damian Shannon replaced the original writing duo to rewrite the script, with production slated for June. By May, Universal Pictures acquired director John Woo to helm the project. In the same month, the previous screenwriters were replaced by screenwriter Zak Penn to rewrite the script once more. By August, production had been delayed, pushing &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; back to be released in summer 2006. In April 2005, Penn was replaced by screenwriter Stuart Beattie to rewrite the script. By May, however, director John Woo left the project due to scheduling conflicts. In August, Johnson said the film was still developing without a director. Pre-production work was underway with designs such as the morphing Interceptor vehicle driven by Alex Decker. Production was eventually halted for the time being, and Dwayne Johnson was detached from the project.

In May 2007, Paul W. S. Anderson was hired to replace Woo as the director with an all-new script unrelated to &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot;. He left the project a year later due to his commitment to &quot;Death Race 2&quot; as a producer. In February 2013, Warner Bros. – the current theatrical distribution rights holders – announced that Ruben Fleischer was brought on board to direct from a screenplay by Carter Blanchard. In November 2015, Blanchard was replaced with the duo Neal Greaves and Sam Chalsen while Dan Lin and Roy Lee were set to produce the film. Whether Fleischer was still on board to direct remains to be seen.

<text>Benjamin Williams Leader (12 March 1831 – 22 March 1923) was a British landscape painter.

==Life and work==

===Early years and training===

Leader was born in Worcester as Benjamin Leader Williams, the son, and third child of eleven children, of notable civil engineer Edward Leader Williams (1802–79) and Sarah Whiting (1801–88). His father was described as a &quot;non-conformist dissenter&quot; and his mother was a Quaker – their marriage in an Anglican church resulted in them being disowned by the Society of Friends.

Leader&#x27;s father was a keen amateur artist – a friend of John Constable – and Benjamin would often accompany him on sketching trips along the banks of the River Severn. His brother, also Edward Leader Williams, later became a notable civil engineer who was knighted for his work, and is now mainly remembered for designing Manchester Ship Canal – which was to become the theme of Leader&#x27;s largest painting. The family eventually came to reside at &quot;Diglis House&quot; – now a hotel.

Leader was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, and initially worked at his father&#x27;s office as a draughtsman while studying art in the evenings at the Worcester School of Design. In his free time he also did a lot of &quot;open air&quot; landscape painting.

In 1854, at the age of 23, he was admitted as a student to the Royal Academy Schools in London, and, unusually, in his first year, had a picture accepted for exhibition there, &quot;Cottage children blowing bubbles&quot;, which was subsequently sold to an American buyer for £50 – a large sum in those days. Subsequently, his work appeared in every summer exhibition at the academy until 1922, when Leader was 91 years old. He also had some early works exhibited at the National Institution of Fine Arts, Portland Place in 1857–58.

===Career===

The inspiration for these early works was the countryside around Worcester itself, &quot;the cottages, farmhouses, lanes, hedgerows and churches, so exceedingly picturesque and beautiful&quot;. However, Leader did not finish his course of studies at the R. A, nor did he need to – his paintings proved to be in great demand by wealthy buyers and he achieved an enviable degree of commercial success within only a few years of his first sale.

In 1857 he changed his name to Benjamin Williams Leader to distinguish himself from the many other painters with the surname Williams. In autumn of that year he travelled to Scotland, and painted &quot;A Quiet pool in Glen Falloch&quot; – exhibited at the R. A. in 1859. That year was his most successful yet with four paintings hung at the Academy and all sold, one of the buyers being the art dealer Agnew&#x27;s who bought much of his work during his lifetime. Such was the demand that much of his best work now went to private galleries and was never publicly exhibited.

For the next 10 years, Leader divided his time painting between the Severn Valley, Worcestershire, and Wales, producing many canvases. Amongst them, &quot;Autumn&#x27;s last Gleam&quot; was regarded as the best landscape in the Royal Academy&#x27;s 1865 exhibition. In 1862 he moved home from Worcester to nearby Whittington (where he lived until 1889) which became a favourite sketching ground. In 1863, his work &quot;The Churchyard at Bettwys-y-Coed&quot; was purchased by the Prime Minister himself, William Gladstone.

In August 1876, Leader married fellow artist Mary Eastlake (born c. 1852) and they went on to have 6 children – the first, Benjamin Eastlake Leader (1877–1916), also an artist, was killed in action during World War I.

In 1881, &quot;February Fill Dyke&quot; was exhibited at the Royal Academy to great acclaim and Leader was made an associate (ARA) in 1883, becoming a Royal Academician (RA) in 1898.&#x27;

===Later life===

In 1889, the family moved to &quot;Burrows Cross&quot;, Shere near Guildford, Surrey, a large mansion designed by Norman Shaw RA – Leader lived here until the end of his life. In that same year he was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, an honour secured on the recommendation of French artist Meissonier. In 1914 he was made an Honorary Freeman of the City of Worcester in recognition of his services (as a director of Royal Worcester Porcerlain and a native of the city).

Apart from his native Worcestershire and Wales, Leader also painted in other parts of Britain including Devon and Surrey and on the continent in Germany, Switzerland, France and Belgium. He died in Surrey in 1923.

===Work===

Leader&#x27;s early works bore the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites with their attention to fine detail and emphasis on painting from nature &quot;en plein air&quot;. In his later years he adopted a looser style which was more impressionistic rather than being an exact copy of nature and this proved to be more popular.

Critic James Dafforne, writing in 1871 in &quot;The Art Journal&quot; said of Leader&#x27;s style:

According to &quot;The Art Journal&quot; of 1901, amongst Leader&#x27;s most popular works during his lifetime were, &quot;In Autumn there shall be light&quot;, &quot;February Fill Dyke&quot; and &quot;The Valley of the Llugwy&quot;. And amongst his best works at the time it considered: &quot;Romantic Tintern – dreaming in the moonlight&quot;, &quot;In the evening it shall be light&quot; and &quot;The Old Holyhead road through North Wales&quot;.

Leader&#x27;s paintings are currently exhibited publicly at the Victoria and Albert Museum and Tate Gallery in London, Huddersfield Art Gallery, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, and in Worcester (the largest collection of his works in Britain by far), Manchester and other regions in Britain. The Cambridge gallery in Santa Monica, US, also has several of his works, and he is included in the collection of the Chazen Museum of Art in Madison, Wisconsin. Many are also held by private collectors. There is a memorial, designed by Ella Naper to Leader in St Buryan&#x27;s Church in Cornwall. In 2003, &quot;A Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; (1888) sold at auction for £168,000 at Sotheby&#x27;s.

<text>Sidhu Murmu and Kanhu Murmu were Indian freedom fighters and brothers who led the Santhal Rebellion (1855–1856), an uprising that took place in present-day Jharkhand and parts of Bengal, including Purulia, Birbhum, and Bankura, in eastern India. The rebellion was aimed at resisting British colonial rule and the exploitative zamindari system.
==Rebellion==

Santals lived in and depended on forests. In 1832, the British demarcated the Damin-i-koh region in present-day Jharkhand and invited Santhals to settle in the region. Due to promises of land and economic amenities a large numbers of Santhals came to settle from Cuttack, Dhalbhum, Manbhum, Hazaribagh, Midnapore etc. Soon, mahajans and zamindars as tax-collecting intermediaries deployed by British dominated the economy. Many Santals became victims of corrupt money lending practices. They were lent money at exorbitant rates when they never could repay then their lands were forcibly taken, they were forced into bonded labour. This sparked the Santal rebellion.

On 30 June 1855, two Santal rebel leaders, Sido Murmu and Kanhu Murmu (related as brother) along with Chand and Bairab, mobilized about 10,000 Santals and declared a rebellion against British colonists. The Santals initially gained some success but soon the British found out a new way to tackle these rebels. Instead, they forced them to come out of the forest. In a conclusive battle which followed, the British, equipped with modern firearms and war elephants, stationed themselves at the foot of the hill. When the battle began, the British officer ordered his troops to fire without loading bullets. The Santals, who did not suspect this trap set by the British war strategy, charged with full potential. This step proved to be disastrous for them. As soon as they neared the foot of the hill, the British army attacked with full power and this time they were using bullets. Although the revolution was suppressed, it marked a great change in the colonial rule and policy. The day is still celebrated among the Santal community.

==Legacy==
Sido Kanhu Murmu University is named upon them. Indian post also issued a ₹ 4 stamp in 2002 honouring them. There is also a Sido Kanhu Memorial Park in Ranchi, named in their honour. The Sido-Kanho Dahar at Esplanade in Central Kolkata is named after them.

Indian Institute of Management Ranchi honored the heroes in 2024 by renaming two buildings in its central academic &amp; administrative area as Sidhu Block &amp; Kanhu Block. These blocks, now integral to IIM Ranchi’s landscape, embody not only architectural significance but serve as perpetual reminders of the enduring spirit of India’s freedom fighters.

<text>Douglas Athon &quot;Dag&quot; Rossman (July 4, 1936 – July 23, 2015) was a U.S. herpetologist specializing in garter snakes. He studied at the University of Florida, where he was awarded a Ph.D. in 1961.

He was a professor of zoology at the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

He co-authored &quot;The Amphibians and Reptiles of Louisiana&quot; (), and also &quot;The Garter Snakes: Evolution and Ecology&quot; ().

His wife, Nita Jane Rossman (born 1936), also has an interest in herpetology and even had a subspecies named after her: &quot;Thamnophis saurita nitae&quot;, a subspecies of the eastern ribbon snake. She had collected the holotype for this subspecies on a field trip with her husband for his dissertation research, and he named it in her honor.

Rossman also wrote &quot;The Nine Worlds: A Dictionary of Norse Mythology&quot; (1983), &quot;Where Legends Live: A Pictorial Guide to Cherokee Mythic Places&quot; (1988), and several other works related to Norse mythology.

Douglas Rossman is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Mexican garter snake, &quot;Thamnophis rossmani&quot;.

<text>is a region of Mars located in the Phoenicis Lacus quadrangle, between Valles Marineris and the Tharsis upland. The region is notable for its maze-like system of deep, steep-walled valleys. The valleys and canyons of this region formed by faulting and many show classic features of grabens, with the upland plain surface preserved on the valley floor. In some places the valley floors are rougher, disturbed by landslides, and there are places where the land appears to have sunk down into pit-like formations. It is thought that this faulting was triggered by volcanic activity in the Tharsis region. Research described in December 2009 found a variety of minerals, including clays, sulfates, and hydrated silicas, in some of the layers.

Noctis Labyrinthus is located in the heart of Tharsis at the western end of the Valles Marineris, manifesting as a network of graben that extends in a spider-like network before coalescing into a coherent, relatively shallow graben swarm that curves in a semicircular fashion towards the south into the Claritas Rise. The graben are known as the Claritas Fossae beyond this point.

==Geology==

The Noctis Labyrinthus fracture zone is centered at the heart of the Tharsis Rise, dividing a plateau of Hesperian-Noachian age that is understood to be of a basaltic composition. The valleys of Noctis Labyrinthus fractured into three distinct trends (NNE/SSW, ENE/WSW, WNW/ESE) in an interlinked pattern that has been compared to the terrestrial fault systems that have formed over terrestrial domes. The formation of the fracture zone have been dated to the Late Hesperian based on crater counting age dates, concurrent with the formation of the lava plains of the adjacent Syria Planum province. Some researchers have modeled the formation of such chasmata on Mars on the propagation of simple graben underlain with dikes. As the underlying magma body drains, the chamber&#x27;s pressure decreases and it begins to deflate. A chain of crater-like depressions forms, where the extent of the collapse dictated by how deeply the magma body is located. Noctis Labyrinthus is estimated to have experienced collapses from the drainage of magma chambers up to 5 km below the chasmata floors. In Noctis Labyrinthus in particular, some researchers have speculated that the fracture zone&#x27;s corridors may connect deeper intrusive structures, forming a plumbing network more akin to the terrestrial Thulean mantle plume, which was responsible for the formation of the North Atlantic Igneous Province. In the chasmata of Noctis Labyrinthus, these pit crater chain collapse zones propagate directionally with a V-shaped tip, and can be used as an indicator of the direction into which magma withdraws from its underlying chamber. These V-tipped morphologies are generally found to propagate away from the center of the Tharsis Rise.

Other authors have proposed an alternate origin for Noctis Labyrinthus, linking its formation to the Valles Marineris and likening its initial formation to the expansion and collapse of a dense lava tube network. Supporters of the lava tube hypothesis note that no evidence of lateral lava flows from the chasmata have been observed, suggesting against the notion that dikes must be required to underlie the surface of the modern-day collapse features as there is no evidence that such a near-surface intrusion has breached the surface in the Noctis Labyrinthus region. Critics of a purely tectonic hypothesis have also noted that although pit crater chains (central to the diking hypothesis) are generally aligned and coincident with graben, they are occasionally found to bifurcate and to cross coeval graben in a perpendicular direction in the vicinity of Noctis Labyrinthus. Some authors have also proposed that Noctis Labyrinthus&#x27; chasmata may have formed due to extensional faulting in weakened rocks composed of interlayered tuff and lava flows, known to produce pit crater chains parallel to graben.

Other authors have suggested that phreatomagmatic processes were associated with the formation of the Noctis Labyrinthus chasmata. This hypothesis is not widely favored because chaos terrain morphology, proposed to form from this mechanism, is not found in the Noctis Labyrinthus fracture network. Chasmata and pit crater chains like those of Noctis Labyrinthus are likewise also not observed near areas where phreatomagmatic activity is strongly believed to have occurred, such as the Sisyphi Montes. Others have proposed that the chasmata of Noctis Labyrinthus are collapse features of a karstic nature, in which constituent carbonate rock is dissolved by meteoric water that has been acidified by acids originating in volcanic gases. This hypothesis has been challenged because carbonate spectral signatures have not been detected in the Noctis Labyrinthus network.

The walls of the valleys of Noctis Labyrinthus have been widened significantly by slumps that have canvassed the valley floors with debris taking the form of mudflows and boulders. Some authors have attributed the steady collapse of the valley walls to creep tied to thermal cycling, which could cause the repeated freezing and thawing of ground ice. Because of its location at the center of the Tharsis uplift, the melting associated with this creep could have been facilitated by increased heat flow to this area during periods of increased magmatic activity. No evidence of fluvial or aeolian erosion is observed in this region.

===Mineralogical diversity===

An unnamed depression near the southernmost extent of the Noctis Labyrinthus system, near the divide of Syria Planum and Sinai Planum and at the western end of the Valles Marineris, was found to be one of the most mineralogically diverse sites yet observed on the planet. These deposits, dated to the late Hesperian, post-date most Martian deposits of hydrated minerals. Based on CRISM spectral imagery, authors studying this depression have interpretatively identified the presence of:
*iron-rich minerals such as hematite and goethite
*Polyhydrated iron sulfates (copiapite and coquimbite), monohydrated iron sulfates (szomolnokite and possibly kieserite), hydroxylated iron sulfates (melanterite and hydronium jarosite), and possibly anhydrous iron sulfates (mikasaite).
*aluminum phyllosilicates (kaolinites like hydrated halloysite/endeillite, or perhaps a combination of kaolinite and montmorillonite)
*iron smectites (nontronite)
*opaline silica (opal-A to the diagenetically-altered opal-CT), found to be comparable in spectral signature to some Icelandic volcanic glass lapilli

Of the hydrated iron sulfate minerals observed in the basin, some of them - such as ferricopiapite - are not stable in modern Martian conditions. However, researchers have suggested that they appear to coexist because the different deposits may have been exposed to the open atmosphere at different times, and some of these minerals do only fully dehydrate under Martian conditions over the course of many years. Furthermore, opaline silica deposits observed within this depression display spectra that may occasionally suggest interpersal with the iron sulfate mineral jarosite and the phyllosilicate mineral montmorillonite. The latter material is interpreted as such from an unusual doublet shape resolved on its spectra.

The minerals in this basin were most likely formed as a result of an initially acidic hydrothermal alteration of basaltic terrain, with the dissolution of plagioclase and calcium-rich pyroxenes increasing the pH steadily and causing the other minerals to precipitate. In this basin in particular, the mafic smectite layer overlays sulfates, aluminum phyllosilicate clays, and opaline silica deposits. The order of this layering is unique to the unnamed depression and is typically reversed in most Martian contexts, with the mafic smectites forming the bottom Noachian-age layer. Some researchers have counterproposed that rather than a sequentially reversed depositional event, this basin formed in a single, highly heterogeneous event. This is not necessarily indicative of a global alterational phenomenon, but is most likely tied to a localized heat source such as a volcano or an impact crater. In 2024, scientists Pascal Lee and Sourabh Shubham found evidence from CRISM, the HiRISE camera, and the Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter that this heat source was a volcano near the northeast end of the labyrinthus that they dubbed Noctis Mons, which would be the seventh-highest mountain on Mars at , and that the eastern part of its base was home to multiple glaciers with potential for hosting life, which could make it a highly valuable candidate target for astrobiology missions.

Calcium-rich pyroxenes have been spectrally observed elsewhere in the northern reaches of the Noctis Labyrinthus fracture zone.

==Observational history==

In 1980, Philippe Masson of the University of Paris-Sud offered an integrated interpretation of the structural geochronology of Valles Marineris, Noctis Labyrinthus, and Claritas Fossae in light of imagery from Mariner 9 and the Viking Orbiter.

In 2003, Daniel Mège (Pierre and Marie Curie University), Anthony C. Cook (University of Nottingham and the Smithsonian Institution), Erwan Garel (University of Maine in France), Yves Lagabrielle (University of Western Brittany), and Marie-Hélène Cormier (Columbia University) proposed a model for rifting on Mars initiated by the deflation of magma chambers, forming pit crater chains tracking directionally with simple graben. The researchers offered the first theoretical explanation as to how the chasmata of Noctis Labyrinthus formed.

In 2012, a collaboration of French researchers Patrick Thollot, Nicolas Mangold, Véronique Ansan, and Stéphan Le Mouélic (University of Nantes), along with a cadre of American researchers including John F. Mustard (Brown University), Ralph E. Milliken (University of Notre Dame), and Scott Murchie (Applied Physics Laboratory) reported on an unnamed basin in southeastern Noctis Labyrinthus showing an extremely wide assemblage of minerals known to form across a wide range of pH and water availability conditions. The pit is the only one of its kind in Noctis Labyrinthus and has a greater variability than almost any other location yet observed on the planet. Using CRISM spectral data on HiRISE visual images for context, the researchers proposed that the variability of this pit is a result of hydrothermal alteration, with the dissolution of extant calcium-rich minerals (e.g. plagioclase) diminishing the acidity and thus kinds of minerals observed. The variability was explained without evoking a global warm and wet Martian climatic condition for the period.

<doc id="638709" wikidata="Q718268" url="?curid=638709" title="The Island of Doctor Moreau">
<text>The Island of Doctor Moreau is an 1896 science fiction novel by English author H. G. Wells. It was published on 1 January 1896. The novel is set between 21 January 1887 to 5 January 1888. The text of the novel is the narration of Edward Prendick, a shipwrecked man rescued by a passing boat. He is left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, a mad scientist who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection. The novel deals with a number of themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, human interference with nature, and the effects of trauma. Wells described it as &quot;an exercise in youthful blasphemy.&quot;

&quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; is a classic work of early science fiction and remains one of Wells&#x27;s best-known books. The novel is the earliest depiction of the science fiction motif &quot;uplift&quot; in which a more advanced race intervenes in the evolution of an animal species to bring the latter to a higher level of intelligence. It has been adapted to film and other media on many occasions.

==Plot==
Edward Prendick is an Englishman with a scientific education who survives a shipwreck of his boat, the Lady Vain, in the southern Pacific Ocean. A passing ship called &quot;Ipecacuanha&quot; takes him aboard and a man named Montgomery revives him. Prendick also meets a grotesque bestial native named M&#x27;ling who appears to be Montgomery&#x27;s manservant. The ship is transporting a number of animals which belong to Montgomery, most strangely a puma. As they approach the island which is Montgomery&#x27;s destination, the captain demands Prendick leave the ship with Montgomery. Montgomery explains that he will not be able to host Prendick on the island. Despite this, the captain leaves Prendick in a dinghy and sails away. Seeing that the captain has abandoned Prendick, Montgomery takes pity and rescues him. As ships rarely pass the island, Prendick will be housed in an outer room of an enclosed compound.

The island belongs to Dr. Moreau. Prendick remembers that he has heard of Moreau, formerly an eminent physiologist in London whose gruesome experiments in vivisection had been publicly exposed, and who fled Great Britain as a result of his exposure.

The next day, Moreau begins working on the puma, eventually revealed as being experimented into a woman. Prendick gathers that Moreau is performing a painful experiment on the animal and its anguished cries drive Prendick out into the jungle. While he wanders, he comes upon a group of people who seem human but have an unmistakable resemblance to swine. As he walks back to the enclosure, he suddenly realises he is being followed by a figure in the jungle. He panics and flees, and the figure gives chase. As his pursuer bears down on him, Prendick manages to stun him with a stone and observes that the pursuer is a monstrous hybrid of animal and man. When Prendick returns to the enclosure and questions Montgomery, Montgomery refuses to be open with him. After failing to get an explanation, Prendick finally gives in and takes a sleeping draught.

Prendick awakes the next morning with the previous night&#x27;s activities fresh in his mind. Seeing that the door to Moreau&#x27;s operating room has been left unlocked, he walks in to find a humanoid form lying in bandages on the table before he is ejected by a shocked and angry Moreau. He believes that Moreau has been vivisecting humans and that he is the next test subject. He flees into the jungle where he meets an Ape-Man who takes him to a colony of similarly half-human/half-animal creatures including a Sloth-Man. Their leader is a large grey unspecified creature named the Sayer of the Law who has him recite a strange litany called the Law that involves prohibitions against bestial behaviour and praise for Moreau:


Suddenly, Dr. Moreau bursts into the colony looking for Prendick, but Prendick escapes to the jungle. He makes for the ocean where he plans to drown himself rather than allow Moreau to experiment on him. Moreau explains that the creatures called the Beast Folk were not formerly men, but rather animals. Prendick returns to the enclosure where Moreau explains that he has been on the island for eleven years and has been striving to make a complete transformation of an animal to a human. He explains that while he is getting closer to perfection, his subjects have a habit of reverting to their animal form and behaviour. Moreau regards the pain he inflicts as insignificant and an unavoidable side effect in the name of his scientific experiments. He also states that pain is an animalistic instinct that one who is truly human cannot have, cutting his thigh with a penknife with no apparent reaction, to further prove his point.

One day, Prendick and Montgomery encounter a half-eaten rabbit. Since eating flesh and tasting blood are strong prohibitions, Dr. Moreau calls an assembly of the Beast Folk and identifies the Leopard-Man (the same one that chased Prendick the first time he wandered into the jungle) as the transgressor. Knowing that he will be sent back to Dr. Moreau&#x27;s compound for more painful sessions of vivisection, the Leopard-Man flees. Eventually, the group corners him in some undergrowth, but Prendick takes pity and shoots him to spare him from further suffering. Prendick also believes that although the Leopard-Man was seen breaking several laws, such as drinking water bent down like an animal, chasing men (Prendick), and running on all fours, the Leopard-Man was not solely responsible for the deaths of the rabbits. It was also the Hyena-Swine, the next most dangerous Beast Man on the island. Dr. Moreau is furious that Prendick killed the Leopard-Man but can do nothing about the situation.

As time passes, Prendick becomes inured to the grotesqueness of the Beast Folk. However one day, the half-finished puma woman rips free of her restraints and escapes from the lab. Dr. Moreau pursues her, but the two end up fighting each other, leading to their mutual deaths. Montgomery breaks down and decides to share his alcohol with the Beast Folk. Prendick resolves to leave the island, but later hears a commotion outside in which Montgomery, his servant M&#x27;ling, and the Sayer of the Law die after a scuffle with the Beast Folk. At the same time, the compound burns down because Prendick has knocked over a lamp. With no chance of saving any of the provisions stored in the enclosure, Prendick realizes that Montgomery has also destroyed the only boats on the island during the night.

Prendick lives with the Beast Folk on the island for months after the deaths of Moreau and Montgomery. As the time goes by, the Beast Folk increasingly revert to their original animal instincts, beginning to hunt the island&#x27;s rabbits, returning to walking on all fours, and leaving their shared living areas for the wild. They cease to follow Prendick&#x27;s instructions. Eventually, the Hyena-Swine kills Prendick&#x27;s faithful Dog-Man companion created from a St. Bernard. With help from the Sloth Creature, Prendick shoots the Hyena-Swine in self-defence.

Prendick&#x27;s efforts to build a raft have been unsuccessful. Luckily for him, a lifeboat that carries two corpses drifts onto the beach (Perhaps the captain of the ship that picked Prendick up and a sailor). Prendick uses the boat to leave the island and is picked up three days later. When he tells his story, he is thought to be mad. So he feigns amnesia.

Upon his return to England, Prendick is no longer comfortable in the presence of humans, all of whom seem to him to be about to revert to an animal state. He leaves London and lives in near-solitude in the countryside, devoting himself to chemistry and astronomy in the studies of which he finds some peace.

* Montgomery – Dr. Moreau&#x27;s assistant and Prendick&#x27;s rescuer. A physician who enjoyed a measure of happiness in England, he is an alcoholic who feels some sympathy for the Beast Folk.

===Beast Folk===
The Beast Folk are animals which Moreau has experimented upon, giving them human traits via vivisection for which the surgery is extremely painful. They include:

* M&#x27;ling – Montgomery&#x27;s servant who does the cooking and cleaning. Moreau combined a bear, a dog, and an ox to create him. As Prendick describes M&#x27;ling, he states that M&#x27;ling is a &quot;complex trophy of Moreau&#x27;s skill, a bear, tainted with dog and ox, and one of the most elaborately made of all the creatures&quot;. He has glowing eyes and furry ears. M&#x27;ling later dies protecting Montgomery from the other Beast Folk on the beach.
* Sayer of the Law – A large, grey-haired animal of unspecified combinations (though Edward notices its gray hair is similar to that of a Skye Terrier as well as sporting talons) that recites Dr. Moreau&#x27;s teachings about being men to the other Beast Folk. The Sayer of the Law serves as a governor and a priest to the Beast Folk. He is later killed in an unseen scuffle between Montgomery, M&#x27;ling, and the Beast Folk.
* Ape-Man – An unspecified ape that considers himself equal to Prendick and refers to himself and Prendick as &quot;Five Men&quot;, because they both have five fingers on each hand, which is uncommon among the Beast Folk. He is the first Beast Man other than M&#x27;ling to whom Prendick speaks. The Ape-Man has what he refers to as &quot;Big Thinks&quot; which on his return to England, Prendick likens to a priest&#x27;s sermon at the pulpit.
* Sloth Creature – A small, pink sloth-based creation described by Prendick as resembling a flayed child. He is one of the more relatively benign creatures and helps Prendick kill the Hyena-Swine before fully regressing.
* Hyena-Swine – A carnivorous hybrid of a spotted hyena and a pig who becomes Prendick&#x27;s enemy in the wake of Dr. Moreau&#x27;s death. He is later killed by Prendick in self-defence.
* Leopard-Man – An African leopard-based rebel who breaks the Law by running on all fours, drinking from the stream, and chasing Prendick. The Leopard-Man is killed by Prendick to spare him further pain, much to the dismay of Dr. Moreau.
* Ox-Men – A group of gray ox-based creatures who appear twice, first when Prendick is introduced to the Beast Folk and then again after Montgomery&#x27;s death.
* Satyr-Man – A hybrid of a goat and an ape. Prendick describes him as unsettling and &quot;Satanic&quot; in form.
* Swine-Men and Swine-Woman – A group of pig-based Beast Folk who appear during Prendick&#x27;s introduction to the Beast Folk.
* Mare-Rhinoceros Creature – A hybrid between a horse and a Sumatran rhinoceros who appeared during Prendick&#x27;s introduction to the Beast Folk.
* Wolf-Men and Wolf-Women – A group of wolf-based Beast Folk who appear during Prendick&#x27;s introduction to the Beast Folk.
* Bear-Bull Man - A hybrid of a bear and a male bovine who appeared during Prendick&#x27;s introduction to the Beast Folk.
* Dog-Man – A Beast Man created from a St. Bernard who, near the end of the book, becomes Prendick&#x27;s faithful companion. He is so like a domestic dog in character that Prendick is barely surprised when he reverts to a more animalistic form. The Dog-Man is later killed by the Hyena-Swine.
* Fox-Bear Woman – A female hybrid of a fox and a bear who passionately supports the Law. Prendick quickly takes a dislike to her and described her as being evil-smelling.
* Wolf-Bear Man - A hybrid of a wolf and a bear who was mentioned during the hunt for the Leopard-Man as hunting his fellow Beast-Folk a wee-bit too much.
* Half-Finished Puma-Woman – The last beast-person created by Moreau. She is halfway through her process of being turned into one of the Beast Folk, but was in so much pain from the surgery that she uses her strength to break free of her restraints and escape. Moreau then chases after her with a revolver. He and the creature fight each other which ends in a mutual kill.
* Ox-Boar Man - A hybrid of an ox and a wild boar who appeared briefly following the death of Moreau.
* Ocelot-Man – A Beast Man created from an ocelot and one of the smaller creatures which briefly appears after Moreau&#x27;s death. He is shot by Montgomery during his scuffle with the Beast Folk on the beach.

==Historical context==
At the time of the novel&#x27;s publication in 1896, there was growing discussion in Europe of the possibility of the degeneration of the human race. Increasing opposition to animal vivisection led to formation of groups like the National Anti-Vivisection Society in 1875, and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection in 1898. &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; reflects the ethical, philosophical, and scientific concerns and controversies raised by these themes and the ideas of Darwinian evolution which were so disrupting to social norms in the late 1800s.

In his preface to The Works of H.G. Wells, Volume 2, The Atlantic Edition (1924), Wells explains that &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; was inspired by the trial of Oscar Wilde.

==The Island of Doctor Moreau in popular culture==

The novel has been adapted to films and other media on multiple occasions. In addition, the novel has influenced many fictional works. The following are some of the works which are related to the character of Dr. Moreau and his story:

===In literature===
* Maurice Renard&#x27;s 1908 French novel &quot;Le Docteur Lerne, sous-dieu&quot; was inspired by &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;, and dedicated to H. G. Wells by its author.
* In Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s novel &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot; (1925) a Moscow surgeon, Dr. Preobrazhensky, transplants human organs into the body of a homeless dog. As a result, the animal transforms into the man Poligraf Poligrafovich Sharikov. In the end of the novel Preobrazhensky performs another operation to return him to the dog&#x27;s state.
* The popular novel of horror and mystery &quot;The Strange Tale of Panorama Island&quot; (1926) by the author Ranpo Edogawa, was inspired by Wells novel.
* The title figure in Argentinian writer Adolfo Bioy Casares novel &quot;The Invention of Morel&quot; (1940), a scientific genius of questionable morality, alludes to Wells&#x27;s Moreau.
* In chapter 1 of Daniel Pinkwater&#x27;s novel &quot;Lizard Music&quot; (1976), Victor watches a late-night film on TV which is identified in chapter 2 as &quot;The Island of Dr Morbo&quot;.
*&quot;Moreau&#x27;s Other Island&quot; (1980) by Brian Aldiss is an updating of the original to a near-future setting. US Under-Secretary of State Calvert Madle Roberts is cast ashore on the eponymous island where he discovers the cyborgised Thalidomide victim Mortimer Dart carrying on Moreau&#x27;s work. It transpires that Dart&#x27;s work is intended to produce a &#x27;replacement&#x27; race that can survive a post-nuclear environment, and that Roberts approved Dart&#x27;s funding.
*The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories and Other Stories (1980) by Gene Wolfe
* &quot;JLA: Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; (2002) is a one-shot tale where Dr. Moreau creates an animal version of the Justice League. As in the novel they start returning to their animal behavior.
* &quot;Dr. Franklin&#x27;s Island&quot; (2002) by Ann Halam is a loose adaptation of the story, in which the eponymous scientist performs transgenic experiments upon the narrator and two other survivors of a plane crash, transforming them into mostly-animal hybrids.
* In &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II&quot; (2002-2003), Moreau is relocated to the South Downs by the British Government, where he continues his experiments, creating a number of children&#x27;s characters, such as Rupert Bear, Mr. Toad and Peter Rabbit. He is also stated to be the uncle of the painter Gustave Moreau.
* In &quot;Moon Over Soho&quot; (2011) by Ben Aaronovitch, the investigation into the Faceless Man uncovers a deserted sex parlor which the malign wizard&#x27;s predecessor had operated in the 1970s.

* &quot;The Madman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; trilogy (2013) by Megan Shepherd tells the story of Dr. Moreau&#x27;s daughter Juliet. Each book is based on a different classic novel: the first book is based on this novel by Wells, the second one on Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; (1886), and the final book is based on Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818).
* In chapter 61 of &quot;The Fallen&quot; (2013), book five of Charlie Higson&#x27;s post-apocalyptic horror series, The Enemy, the expedition party from the museum encounters a strange set of malformed children at the biomedical company Promithios, who recite the Litany of the Law.
* &quot;The Isles of Dr Moreau&quot; (2015) in Heather O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Daydreams of Angels&quot; tells of a grandfather who, when he was young, meets an eccentric, albeit humane scientist named Dr Moreau on &quot;the Isle of Noble and Important and Respectable Betterment of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and Their Consorts&quot;. Moreau&#x27;s experiments involve combining animal DNA with human DNA and the story unfolds as the grandfather meets (and dates) several of these humanoid creatures.
* In &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; Chapter 76 (2016), Greek goddess Aphrodite is reading a book with the title &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot;.
* &quot;The Strange Case of the Alchemist&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2017) by Theodora Goss features the half-finished puma woman from &quot;The Island of Dr Moreau&quot; as one of its main characters, Catherine.
* &quot;The Daughter of Doctor Moreau&quot; (2022) by Silvia Moreno-Garcia is a novel billed as &quot;a dreamy reimagining of &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; set against the backdrop of nineteenth-century Mexico.&quot;

===In music===

* In 2017, Big Finish Productions adapted the story into a two-hour audio drama starring Ronald Pickup as Doctor Moreau with John Heffernan as Edward Prendick and Enzo Cilenti as Montgomery.

===In television===
* The American animated TV show &quot;South Park&quot; features a recurring character ‘Dr. Alphonse Mephesto’ (from 1997) who seems to be based on the 1996 Brando portrayal of Dr. Moreau, a mad scientist who experiments on animals and is even the president of the North American Marlon Brando Lookalike Association (NAMBLA).
* The &quot;Thriller Bark&quot; (2008) story arc in the anime series &quot;One Piece&quot; draws heavily from the novel. It includes a surgeon named Dr. Hogback who disappears from the public eye and begins work on animal-human hybrid zombies as well as several characters who are direct references to the Beast Folk from the novel like Absalom who has the snout of a lion, the skin of an elephant, and the combined muscles of a bear and a gorilla.
* The Canadian cartoon series &quot;Spliced&quot; (2009–2010) is a lighthearted take on the concept. 
* In &quot;Orphan Black&quot; (2013–2017), a BBC America sci-fi/thriller series, the book plays an important role beginning in the third season. An old copy of the book contains Professor Duncan&#x27;s cryptic key to human cloning. The fourth season establishes an island similar to Moreau&#x27;s, called Westmoreau, referred to in the series as simply &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau.&quot; On the island, a Dr. Moreau type figure, P.T. Westmoreland, is the reclusive head of a mysterious and powerful scientific elite who performs experiments on human subjects. Much of the fifth season is set on the island.
* The 2020 Japanese anime series &quot;&quot; appears to have been influenced by the novel with the concept of a place inhabited by human-animal hybrids with lab experiments about the biology of the human-animal hybrids.
* The 2025 cartoon &quot;StuGo&quot; features Dr. Lullah (voiced by Lorraine Toussaint) who had created mutant creatures out of animals amidst other creations that live on her island. Her personal assistant Mr. Okay (voiced by Jake Green) was created from a Scottish Terrier that stowed away on a cargo ship that arrived on her island.

====In television episodes====
* In the episode &quot;What&#x27;s Michelangelo Good For?&quot; (1990) of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, Dr. Lesseau is a scientist who creates hybrids.
* The &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Tyger, Tyger&quot; (1992) borrows heavily from the story where a mad scientist named Dr. Emile Dorian (voiced by Joseph Maher) creates the cat-like artificial lifeform Tyger (voiced by Jim Cummings), spliced the DNA of a human and a gorilla to create his henchman Garth (also voiced by Jim Cummings), and turns Selina Kyle into an actual cat woman.
* The third-season &quot;Sliders&quot; episode &quot;This Slide of Paradise&quot; (1997) features an island where a scientist (played by Michael York, co-star of the 1977 film adaptation) has created human-animal hybrids.
* In the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;The Begotten&quot; (1997), changeling policeman Odo deplores the experimental investigation of his physiology during infancy by his teacher Doctor Mora.
* In the episode &quot;Brainwashed&quot; (1998) of &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, Snowball guides the protagonists to the lair of Dr. Mordaux.
* The &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; episode &quot;The Island of Mrs. Morceau&quot; (2002) features a scientist named Dr. More (voiced by Jennifer Hale) who turns people into animal hybrids where she turns Johnny into a hamster hybrid.
* The &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; episode &quot;Klub Katz&quot; (2000) is a spoof on the novel, but the victims are turned into machines instead of animals.
* &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; annual Halloween special adapted the novel as a segment in their &quot;Treehouse of Horror XIII&quot; episode (2002) called &quot;The Island of Dr. Hibbert&quot;, in which the doctor invites unsuspecting Springfield residents to his island resort, and turns them into human-animal hybrids including Homer to a walrus, Marge to a panther (in a reference to Lota from the original Island of Lost Souls movie), Lisa to a hawk, Bart to a spider, Maggie to a giant anteater, Mr. Burns to a fox, Waylon Smithers into a flamingo, Chief Wiggum to a pig, Groundskeeper Willie to an orangutan, Ned Flanders to a cow-centaur, and Comic Book Guy to a faun-themed parody of the Sayer of the Law.
* In &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; episode &quot;Mutants&quot; (2004), the zoo animals are mysteriously disappearing, and we discover that Bainbridge and Bob Fossil have been splicing the animals together in a secret lab.
* The episode &quot;Venture Libre&quot; (2013) of &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; features an island that Dr. Venture visits filled with, among other strange creatures, animal-human hybrids resulting from unethical experiments performed by unscrupulous scientists.
* In the anime and manga series &quot;Vanitas no Carte&quot; there&#x27;s an antagonistic character named Dr. Moreau, a mad scientist inspired in the same Moreau from the novel.

===In cinema===
* &quot;Ile d&#x27;Epouvante&quot; (1913, &quot;The Island of Terror&quot;), a French silent film (also spelled &quot;L&#x27;Ile d&#x27;Epouvante&quot; and &quot;Isle d&#x27;epouvante&quot;). The 23-minute, two-reel film, directed by Joe Hamman in 1911 was then released in 1913. By late 1913, the film had been picked up by US distributor George Kleine and renamed &quot;The Island of Terror&quot; for its release in Chicago.
* &quot;Die Insel der Verschollenen&quot; (1921), a German silent adaption directed by Urban Gad.
* &quot;Island of Lost Souls&quot; (1932), with Charles Laughton as Doctor Moreau, and Bela Lugosi as the Sayer of the Law. In the film, Dr. Moreau creates his Beast Folk through &quot;plastic surgery, blood transfusions, gland extracts, and ray baths&quot;. In addition, the Sayer of the Law is depicted as a wolf-like humanoid. Another addition is Lota (Kathleen Burke), a woman Moreau derived from a panther, set upon to mate with Edward (Richard Arlen), so Moreau can find out whether or not she can bear human-children. Lota was not a character from the original novel (the closest is a half-finished puma woman), but filmmakers of future adaptations apparently loved her so much, they included a feline love interest in their adaptations, which include Barbara Carrera as Maria in the 1977 version, and Fairuza Balk as Aissa in the 1996 version. 
* &quot;Terror Is a Man&quot; (1959), with Francis Lederer, Greta Thyssen, and Richard Derr. This Filipino film, directed by Gerardo de Leon, was re-released in the United States years later as &quot;Blood Creature&quot;.

* &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; (1996), a New Line-produced film with Marlon Brando, Val Kilmer, David Thewlis, Fairuza Balk, and Ron Perlman. In this film, Dr. Moreau introduces human DNA into the animals in his possession to make them more human. The film&#x27;s version of the Sayer of the Law is depicted as a blind sheep/goat-like hybrid. Unlike the books and earlier films, the Sayer of the Law survives the ordeal and sees off the main protagonist.
* The sequel &quot;Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams&quot; (2002), a lunatic scientist named Romero (portrayed by Steve Buscemi) creates miniature hybrid animals on a mysterious island where technology fails to work. Unfortunately, some of them grow upon being discovered to an experimental growth formula, causing Romero to remain in his lab to avoid being eaten. These creations include Spider Monkeys (a half-monkey half-spider creature with a drider-like appearance), Slizards (a lizard with a snake head and neck), Sporks (a pig/stork variation of a flying pig), Turtleroos (a creature with the head and shell of a turtle and the body of a kangaroo), Bullfrogs (a cattle with the hindquarters of a frog), Catfish (a cat with the head and tail of a fish), Horse-Flies (a horse with the head and wings of a house fly), Sheepdogs (a sheep with the head and legs of a bulldog), and Tiger Sharks (a tiger with the head and back fin of a bull shark). After having been briefly captured by Donnagan Giggles, Romero is confronted by his creations who don&#x27;t eat him as he had feared. The hybrids help thwart Donnagan&#x27;s plot to use the Transmooker, where the Spork snatches it and a Slizzard eats it.
* The film &quot;Dr. Moreau&#x27;s House of Pain&quot; (2004), made by cult horror studio Full Moon Pictures, is billed as a sequel to the novel.
* The 2013 film &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&quot; shares similarities with the novel.
* Christopher Lambert plays Dr. Moreau in the 2018 Italian horror film &quot;La Voce del Lupo&quot;.

===In gaming===
* In the 1997 video game &quot;Fallout&quot;, a grossly mutated human by the moniker of &quot;Master&quot; shares similar characteristics with Doctor Moreau, including his original surname.
* &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; has an antagonist named Frantisek Markov who lives on an isle in &quot;Ravenloft&quot; (1983–2021) where he experiments on animals to make them human.
* The 2000 video game &quot;Metal Slug 3&quot;&#x27;s first mission is an island called &quot;Pallas Island&quot; which was also called &quot;Dr. Moreau&#x27;s Island&quot; featuring mutated animals albeit as a result of nuclear experimentation.
* The 2003 strategy video game &quot;Impossible Creatures&quot;, centered around creating armies out of animal hybrids, was largely inspired by the novel.
* &quot;&quot; is a Ukrainian developed first-person shooter game released in the CIS in 2005 and later in the rest of Europe in 2006. The game is heavily inspired by the novel, originally developed as a Duke Nukem title.
* The video game &quot;Champions Online&quot; (2009) features Dr. Phillippe Moreau, the grandson of Dr. Henry Moreau and member of the terrorist organization VIPER (short for Venomous Imperial Party of the Eternal Reptile). Phillippe used his technology to perfect his father&#x27;s work where he created the Manimals.
* Doctor Merlot, the main villain of the 2016 game &quot;RWBY: Grimm Eclipse&quot;, is heavily inspired by Doctor Moreau.
* &quot;Resident Evil Village&quot; (2021) features as one of its primary antagonists a mutant named Salvatore Moreau. In-game journal entries describe his experiments on other human subjects with the same parasitic organism that caused his grotesque transformation.
* &quot;Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves&quot; (2005) features Dr. M as the game’s main antagonist, who has turned the island housing the Cooper Vault into a private fortress, complete with mutant animal guards patrolling the island. Dr. M is himself an anthropomorphic mandrill, who has grafted his own body with cybernetic machinery to allow him to control his mutant creations. 
* In &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot; (2015) Tomas Moreau, a character in the game, attempts to reverse witcher mutations on his son. Instead, the experiments strengthen the mutations, making Jerome less human.
* In the &quot;Mass Effect 3: Citadel&quot; DLC (2013), pilot Jeff &quot;Joker&quot; Moreau makes a reference to the book in a fictional story he tells about defeating a number of soldiers, in which he says &quot;You just landed on the island of Dr. Me!&quot;
* In &quot;&quot;, the character Ruan Mei is a scientist who creates life forms to try and find the origin of life and her creations would eventually form their own civilisation in Seclusion Zone in Herta Space Station.

==Scientific plausibility==
In the short essay &quot;The Limits of Individual Plasticity&quot; (1895), H.G. Wells expounded upon his firm belief that the events depicted in &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; are entirely possible should such vivisective experiments ever be tested outside the confines of science fiction. Until recently, modern medicine has shown that non-human animals lack the necessary brain structure to emulate human faculties like speech. In addition, immune responses to foreign tissues make transplantation within one species very complicated, let alone between species. However, a team of researchers at Stanford University have successfully transplanted a cluster of living human brain cells from a dish in the lab to the brain of a newborn rat to study neurological conditions such as autism, ADHD, and schizophrenia.

<text>Southeast Missouri State University (Southeast or SEMO) is a public university in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. In addition to the main campus, the university has four regional campuses offering full degree programs and a secondary campus housing the Holland College of Arts and Media. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

Enrolling 9,677 students, Southeast offers more than 175 undergraduate degree programs and 75 graduate programs. Originally founded in 1873 as a normal school, the university has a traditional emphasis on teacher education. Five academic units make up the university: the Holland College of Arts and Media; the Harrison College of Business and Computing; the College of Education, Health, and Human Studies; College of Humanities and Social Sciences; and the College of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. The university&#x27;s thirteen athletics teams compete in the Ohio Valley Conference of NCAA Division I and are known as the Redhawks. The football team competes in the Football Championship Subdivision of Division I. SEMO’s Board of Governors announced on February 13, 2025 that Dr. Brad Hodson, Executive Vice-President at Missouri Southern State University, has been named President Designate and will begin duties on July 1, 2025, after Dr. Carlos Vargas’ term ends.

==History==
Southeast Missouri State University was founded in 1873 when a group of businessmen and politicians successfully lobbied the State of Missouri to designate Cape Girardeau as the home of the Third District Normal School. Originally known as Southeast Missouri State Normal School, the first classes were taught at the nearby Lorimier School until April 1875, when the first university building was completed.

The university has had five names in its history:
*Southeast Missouri State Normal School, 1873–1881
*Missouri State Normal School—Third District, 1881–1919
*Southeast Missouri State Teachers College, 1919–1946
*Southeast Missouri State College, 1946–1973
*Southeast Missouri State University, 1973–present

The Normal building was described in 1883 by Mark Twain in &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; as &quot;a bright new edifice, picturesquely and peculiarly towered and pinnacled—a sort of gigantic casters, with the cruets all complete.&quot; It burned down on April 8, 1902, and was replaced in 1906 by Academic Hall, the school&#x27;s domed landmark building. Academic Hall was designed by Jerome Bibb Legg, who also designed the St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall, and it includes light fixtures from the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair. Academic Hall today stands at the center of campus and houses administrative offices, classrooms, and an auditorium.
In the 1950s, Southeast Missouri State College had an enrollment of approximately 1,600 students. Enrollment steadily increased to more than 7,000 students in the 1970s. The college moved away from its focus on training teachers and began to offer courses of study in business, nursing, and the liberal arts. The size campus grew rapidly in this same period. In 1956, the institution had ten buildings on campus. By 1975, the number had increased to twenty-two buildings.

In 1998, the university acquired the former St. Vincent&#x27;s Seminary located in downtown Cape Girardeau on the Mississippi River. This property has been redeveloped as the River Campus, which opened in Fall 2007 and houses the Earl and Margie Holland School of Visual and Performing Arts. The construction of the River Campus began to shift the institution&#x27;s focus towards the visual and performing arts, which today forms the basis of the university&#x27;s statewide reputation.

Missouri State Normal School Third District President John Sephus McGhee established the University Schools on June 15, 1896. This allowed prospective teachers to gain real-world teaching experience while earning their degrees. As the university expanded its curriculum and extra-curricular activities, so did the University Schools. In 1903, as recent construction allowed for more space for university classes, the training school was able to expand its class sizes as well. The University Schools consisted of an elementary, junior high, and high school. The University Schools closed at the end of the 1986–1987 school year due to increasing costs.

== Campus ==
=== River Campus ===
The River Campus is home to the Earl and Margie Holland School of Visual and Performing Arts. The facilities incorporate two buildings: the Seminary Building and the Cultural Arts Center. These buildings contain the Donald C. Bedell Performance Hall, the Rosemary Berkel and Harry L. Crisp II Museum, the John and Betty Glenn Convocation Center, the Wendy Kurka Rust Flexible Theatre, the Robert F. and Gertrude L. Shuck Music Recital Hall, and the River Campus Art Gallery. It is home to the departments of Art, Music, Theater and Dance. The River Campus hosts many performance series: the Theater and Dance Series, the Symphony Series, the Southeast Ensemble Series, the Jazz Series, the Faculty Recital Series and Sundays at Three chamber music Series. The Rosemary Berkel and Harry L. Crisp II Museum and Art Gallery features rotating touring exhibitions.

=== Regional campuses ===
Southeast and Three Rivers Community College in Poplar Bluff agreed in 2004 to share higher education facilities at three locations in southeast Missouri: Sikeston, Kennett, and Malden. In spring 2005, Southeast eliminated Three Rivers courses from those centers, citing failure of the community college to pay approximately $10,000 in facilities-use fees. Southeast took over all course offerings at the centers, which have subsequently been named regional campuses of Southeast Missouri State University. Three Rivers Community College filed a lawsuit in March 2005 against Southeast. The lawsuit was subsequently dropped, and Southeast and Three Rivers recently announced plans to develop a joint bachelor&#x27;s degree program in social work. Southeast now operates four regional campuses, at Kennett, Malden, Sikeston, and Perryville.

==Athletics==

Southeast Missouri State has been a member of NCAA Division I (Division I FCS for football) since moving up from Division II in 1991. As a result of the promotion in classifications, Southeast Missouri State left the Division II athletic conference Mid–America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) and joined the Division I Ohio Valley Conference (OVC).

==List of fraternities and sororities==
There are numerous fraternities and sororities affiliated with the school.

==&quot;Arrow&quot; student newspaper==
The &quot;Arrow&quot; is the university&#x27;s student newspaper. The second editor of the &quot;Capaha Arrow&quot; was Rush Limbaugh Sr. who became a nationally recognized Missouri attorney and practiced law in Cape Girardeau until just before his passing at the age of 104 in 1996; he was the grandfather of the media personality Rush Limbaugh. After the university changed its mascot from Indians/Otahkians to Redhawks, the newspaper dropped &quot;Capaha&quot; and is now known as simply &quot;The Arrow.&quot; It is still run by students in the Department of Mass Media and publishes a biweekly newspaper distributed throughout campus. Microfilm and print copies of the &quot;Capaha Arrow&quot; dating back to the first issue are available at Kent Library and Special Collections and Archives, and some stories are also put on &quot;The Arrow&quot; website.

<text>The large emerald (&quot;Geometra papilionaria&quot;) is a moth which is the type species for the family Geometridae. It is found throughout the Palearctic region and the Near East in and around deciduous forests, heathlands, marshland and in settlements close to woodland. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;.

==Description==
This is a large and attractive moth, which, as the specific name suggests, is very butterfly like. It has a wingspan of 50–65 mm. Newly emerged adults are distinctive pale green with slightly darker green and, especially, white fascia, though the green colouration fades after a few days. The characteristic white fascia take the form of three jagged, broken lines of white spots on the forewings, of which two semicircular rows continue over the hindwings.

==Technical description and egg, larva and pupa==
Bright green, the forewing usually with two lunulate-dentate white lnes, the hindwing with one, the lunules in the submedian area of forewing the thickest; both wings usually in addition with a faintly darker green cell-mark and some indistinct white intraneural spots distally to the postmedian
line. Under surface similarly but more weakly marked, with no antemedian line.- ab. &quot;herbacearia&quot; Men. is a form in which both the lines are obsolete. It was originally described, from Amurland, and as a separate species - ab. &quot;cuneata&quot; Burr, is characterized by a large wedge-shaped white spot adjoining the discal mark proximally in addition to the usual markings.-ab. &quot;subcaerulescens&quot; Burr, is of a bluer green ground-colour than the normal, but is probably scarcely worth naming.- ab. &quot;deleta&quot; Burr, is another unimportant aberration, in which the distal series of white spots is entirely obsolete - in ab. &quot;subobsoleta&quot; Burr. the antemedian line of the fore-wing is likewise obsolete. — ab. &quot;alba&quot; Gillm. is entirely white, above and beneath., slightly tinged with yellowish. The egg of is approximately oval, broader at one end and here flattened; it is strong and heavy looking, the surface sculptured, with strongly marked cells, the micropyle shown by a shallow, circular rayed pit. The larva feeds on birch and alder, and has been closely studied for its beautiful protective adaptations. It is rather stout, rugose, the surface shagreened, the head slightly notched, the setae mostly with enlarged summits. The larva hibernates small, and is at this time brown in colour, protectively assimilated to the tiny twigs. In the spring many become green, and they are wonderfully like the birch catkins among which they feed, various small protuberances and projecting edges of segments enhancing the resemblance. The pupa is cylindrical, tapering regularly from the fourth abdominal segment to the anal extremity; spiracles and tubercles distinct, the latter dark-coloured, bearing short curved setae; anal armature consisting of 8 hooks; the generalolour is pale green, the wing-cases tinged with brown.
==Similar species==
&quot;Hemistola chrysoprasaria&quot;, &quot;Thetidia smaragdaria&quot;, &quot;Campaea margaritata&quot;, &quot;Comibaena bajularia&quot;, &quot;Hemithea aestivaria&quot; and &quot;Hylaea fasciaria&quot; All lack the white, interrupted, jagged spot line on the wings.


==Biology==
It flies at night from June to August and is attracted to light.
The hibernating larva is a reddish brown colour matching dead leaves. It turns green after hibernation to match spring leaves. It feeds mainly on birch though it has also been recorded on alder, beech, hazel and rowan. The chrysalis, enclosed in a flimsy silken web among the dead leaves, usually on the ground, is of a delicate green colour, dotted with buff on the back, and shaded with buff on the wing cases.
==Subspecies==

*&quot;G. p. herbacearia&quot; Ménétries, 1859 West Siberia - Southeast Siberia, Korea

<text>The [[Tortricidae]] are a family of moths, commonly known as tortrix moths or leafroller moths, in the order Lepidoptera. This large family has over 11,000 species described, and is the sole member of the superfamily Tortricoidea, although the genus &quot;Heliocosma&quot; is sometimes placed within this superfamily. Many of these are economically important pests. [[Olethreutinae|Olethreutidae]] is a junior synonym. The typical resting posture is with the wings folded back, producing a rather rounded profile.

Notable tortricids include the codling moth and the spruce budworm, which are among the most well-studied of all insects because of their economic impact.

==Description==
Tortricid moths are generally small, with a wingspan of 3 cm or less. Many species are drab and have mottled and marbled brown colors, but some diurnal species are brightly colored and mimic other moths of the families Geometridae and Pyralidae.

==Life cycle and behavior==
Tortricid eggs are often flattened and scale-like.

Larvae in the subfamilies Chlidanotinae and Olethreutinae usually feed by boring into stems, roots, buds, or seeds. Larvae in the subfamily Tortricinae, however, feed externally and construct leaf rolls. Larvae in the subfamily Tortricinae tend to be more polyphagous than those in Chlidanotinae and Olethreutinae. Tortricinae also possess an anal fork for flicking excrement away from their shelters.

==Some common tortricids==
The tortricids include many economically important pests, including:
*Summer fruit tortrix moth (&quot;Adoxophyes orana&quot;)
*Fruit tree tortrix moth (&quot;Archips podana&quot;)
*Rose leaf roller (&quot;Archips rosana&quot;)
*&quot;Argyrotaenia ljungiana&quot;, a pest on vines, maize, and fruit trees
*Peach moth (&quot;Cydia molesta&quot;)
*Codling moth (&quot;Cydia pomonella&quot;)
*Plum fruit moth (&quot;Cydia funebrana&quot;)
*Pea moth (&quot;Cydia nigricana&quot;)
*Chestnut and acorn moth (&quot;Cydia splendana&quot;)
*Light brown apple moth (&quot;Epiphyas postvittana&quot;)
*Hemp borer (&quot;Grapholita delineana&quot;)
*Oriental fruit moth (&quot;Grapholita molesta&quot;)
*Cherry fruitworm (&quot;Grapholita packardi&quot;)
*European grapevine moth (&quot;Lobesia botrana&quot;)
*Barred fruit tree tortrix moth (&quot;Pandemis cerasana&quot;)
*Grape berry moth (&quot;Paralobesia viteana&quot;)
*Long-palped tortrix or vine leaf roller (&quot;Sparganothis pilleriana&quot;)
*Bud moth (&quot;Spilonota ocellana&quot;)
*False codling moth (&quot;Thaumatotibia (Cryptophlebia) leucotreta&quot;)
*Spruce budworm (Genus &quot;Choristoneura&quot;)

===A typical tortricid – the codling moth===
The Tortricidae are considered to be the single most important family of insects that feed on apples, both economically and in diversity of feeding found on fruit, buds, leaves, and shoots. In New York, no fewer than seventeen species of Tortricidae have gained pest status in regards to apple production.

The codling moth &quot;Cydia pomonella&quot; causes worm-holes in apples. It has been accidentally spread from its original range in Europe and is now found in North and South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, wherever apples are grown. Control has required the use of the harshest available insecticides – historically lead arsenate and DDT were used for control. These chemicals brought considerable environmental dangers, and in any case the insect gradually developed resistance to them. Currently, organophosphate sprays are favored and are timed carefully to catch the hatching larvae before they can bore into the fruit.

<doc id="638722" wikidata="Q2160037" url="?curid=638722" title="United Provinces of Agra and Oudh">
<text>The United Provinces of Agra and Oudh was a province of India under the British Raj, which existed from 22 March 1902 to 1937; the official name was shortened by the Government of India Act 1935 to United Provinces (UP), by which the province had been commonly known, and by which name it was also a province of independent India until 1950.

It corresponded approximately to the present-day Indian states of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Uttarakhand. Allahabad served as the administrative headquarters and the capital of the province. Two years after the annexation of Oudh State in 1856, &quot;i.e.&quot; after 1858 and until 1902, the region had existed as North-Western Provinces and Oudh, Oudh being a Chief Commissionership.

Lucknow became its capital some time after 1921. Nainital was the summer capital of the province.

==History==

By the 18th century, the once vast Mughal Empire was collapsing, undone by internal dissension and by expansion of the Marathas from the Deccan, the British from Bengal, and the Afghans from Afghanistan. By the middle of the century, present-day Uttar Pradesh was divided between several states: Oudh in the centre and east, ruled by a Nawab who owed allegiance to the Mughal Emperor but was &quot;de facto&quot; independent; Rohilkhand in the north, ruled by Afghans; the Marathas, who controlled the Bundelkhand region in the south, and the Mughal Empire, which controlled the entire Doab (the tongue of land between the Ganges and Yamuna rivers) as well as the Delhi region.

In 1765, the combined forces of Awadh and the Mughal Emperor met the British at the Battle of Buxar. The British won, but they did not take any territory; the whole of Awadh was restored to the Nawab, and the Mughal emperor Shah Alam was restored the subahs of Allahabad and Kora in the lower Doab, with a British garrison in the fort of Allahabad. Governor-General Warren Hastings later augmented the territory of Awadh by lending the nawab a British army to conquer Rohilkhand in the Rohilla War, and by giving Allahabad and Kora to Awadh on the ground that Shah Alam had placed himself in the power of the Marathas. At the same time the British received the province of Benares from Awadh.

Subsequently, no great change took place until the arrival of Lord Wellesley (Governor-General 1797–1805) who acquired a very large accession of territory in two instalments. In 1801 he obtained from the Nawab of Oudh the cession of Rohilkhand, the lower Doab, and the Gorakhpur division, thus enclosing Awadh on all sides except the north. In 1804, as the result of Lord Lake&#x27;s victories in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, part of Bundelkhand and the rest of the Doab, including Agra and the guardianship of the old and blind emperor, Shah Alam, at Delhi, were obtained from Scindia. In 1815 the Kumaon division was acquired after the Gurkha War, and a further portion of Bundelkhand from the Maratha Peshwa in 1817. These new acquisitions, known as the ceded and conquered provinces, continued to be administered by the governor-general as part of Bengal. In 1833 an act of Parliament was passed to constitute a new presidency (province), with its capital at Agra. But this scheme was never fully carried out, and in 1835 another statute authorised the appointment of a lieutenant-governor for the North-Western Provinces, as they were then known.

The North-Western Provinces included the Delhi and Gurgaon territories, transferred later, after the Revolt of 1857 to the Punjab; and also (after 1853) the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories, which in 1861 became part of the Central Provinces. Awadh remained under its nawab, who was permitted to assume the title of king in 1819. Awadh was annexed in 1856 and constituted a separate chief commissionership. Then followed the Revolt of 1857, when all signs of British rule were for a time swept away throughout the greater part of the two provinces. The lieutenant-governor died when shut up in the fort at Agra, and Oudh was reconquered only after several campaigns lasting for eighteen months.

In 1877 the offices of Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces and Chief Commissioner of Oudh were combined in the same person; the formula was common in British imperial administration, and was known as &#x27;double-hatting&#x27;. In 1902, when the new name of United Provinces of Agra and Oudh was introduced, the title of chief commissioner was dropped, though Oudh still retained some marks of its former independence. On 1 April 1937, the official name of the province was shortened to the United Provinces (UP).

The United Provinces became a province of the newly independent India in 1947. After the political integration of India and upon the coming into force of the new Constitution of India on 26 January 1950, three former princely states, Rampur, Benares, and Tehri Garhwal was added to it and it was renamed Uttar Pradesh.

==Geography==
The provinces were bounded on the north by Tibet, and on the north-east by Nepal; on the east and south-east by the Champaran, Saran, Shahabad, and Palamau
Districts of Bengal; on the south by two of the Chota Nagpur States in the Central Provinces, Rewah and some small States in the Central India kanpur technical augor District in the Central Provinces; on the west by the States of Gwalior, Dholpur, and Bharatpur, the Districts of Gurgaon, Delhi, Karnal, and Ambala in the Punjab, and the Punjab States of Sirmur and Jubbal. The Jumna river formed part of the western boundary, the Ganges part of the southern, and the Gandak part of the eastern; other boundaries are artificial. According to the District surveys the areas of the two Provinces are, in square miles: Agra, 83,198; Oudh, 23,966; total, 107,164.9044
Including some river-beds which form District boundaries and are excluded from the District details, 041 the total area amounts to . The area of the two Native States in the Provinces (Rampur and Tehri) is more.

A Presidency of Agra was first formed in 1834, and the area had until then separated had been included in the Presidency of Bengal, sometimes called the Western Provinces. The United Provinces included four distinct tracts of country namely, portions of the Himalayas, the sub-Himalayan tracts, the great Gangetic plain, and portions of the hill systems of Central India.

==Dyarchy (1920–37)==
The Government of India Act 1919 expanded the United Provinces Legislative Council to 123 seats, including more elected Indian members. The reforms also introduced the principle of diarchy, whereby certain responsibilities such as agriculture, health, education, and local government, were transferred to elected ministers. However, the important portfolios like finance, police and irrigation were reserved with members of the Governor&#x27;s Executive Council. Some of the prominent members and ministers in the United Provinces were Mohammad Ali Mohammad Khan (Home Member), C. Y. Chintamani (Minister of Education and Industries) and Jagat Narain Mulla (Minister of Local &amp; Self Government).

<text>Kauravi (, ), also known as Khaṛībolī, is a dialect of Hindustani descended from Shauraseni Prakrit that is mainly spoken in northwestern Uttar Pradesh, outside of Delhi.

Modern Hindi and Urdu are two standard registers of Hindustani, descending from Old Hindi, originally called Hindavi and Delhavi which gained prestige when it was accepted along with Persian as a language of the courts. Before that, it was only a language the Persianate states (like Delhi Sultanate) spoke to their subjects in, and later as a sociolect of the same ruling classes.

Modern Kauravi contains some features, such as gemination and pitch accent, which give it a distinctive sound and differentiates it from Braj and Awadhi. Old Hindi developed into Hindustani and then into today&#x27;s Hindi and Urdu registers.

==Geographical distribution==

Khariboli is spoken in the rural surroundings of Delhi and northwestern Uttar Pradesh, as well as in some neighbouring areas of Haryana and Uttarakhand. The geography of this part of North India is traditionally described as &quot;doabs&quot;.

In Haryana, the following districts are Khari-speaking:
*Eastern parts of Yamunanagar
*Northern parts of Faridabad
*Eastern parts of Karnal, Sonepat, Panipat

In Uttar Pradesh, the following districts of the Yamuna-Ganges &quot;doab&quot; are Khari-speaking:

*Saharanpur
*Muzaffarnagar
*Shamli
*Baghpat
*Meerut
*Ghaziabad
*Hapur
*Northern parts of Bulandshahr
*Northern parts of Gautam Buddha Nagar

In the trans-Ganges area, it is spoken in the following districts of Rohilkhand region in Uttar Pradesh:
*Moradabad
*Rampur
*Sambhal
*Amroha
*Bijnor

In Uttarakhand, the following districts of the Yamuna-Ganges &quot;doab&quot; are partially Khari-speaking:
*Haridwar
*Dehradun

In the trans-Ganges area, it is partially spoken in the following districts of Uttarakhand:

*Nainital only in the Terai region.
*Udham Singh Nagar

==Khariboli in Hindustani popular culture==
Khariboli is often seen as rustic by speakers of Standard Hindustani, and elements of it were used in &quot;Hum Log&quot;, India&#x27;s first television soap opera, where the main family was depicted as having roots in Western Uttar Pradesh.

As the two main Hindustani dialects of Western Uttar Pradesh and the areas surrounding Delhi, Khariboli and Braj Bhasha are often compared. One hypothesis of how Khariboli came to be described as (standing) asserts that it refers to the &quot;stiff and rustic uncouthness&quot; of the dialect compared to the &quot;mellifluousness and soft fluency&quot; of Braj Bhasha. On the other hand, Khariboli supporters sometimes pejoratively referred to Braj Bhasha and other dialects as &quot;Pariboli&quot; (, ).

==Kauravi and Sankrityayan&#x27;s proposal==
Although most linguists acknowledge that Modern Standard Hindustani descended from Khariboli, the precise mechanism of dialectical changes from Khari to the prestige dialect (such as the loss of gemination which is so prevalent in Khari) lacks consensus. There are also variations within Khari itself across the area in which it is spoken. In the mid-twentieth century, Indian scholar and nationalist, Rahul Sankrityayan, proposed a redrawing of the linguistic map of the Hindustani zone. Drawing a distinction between the Khari of Old Delhi and the Khari of the extreme western parts of Western Uttar Pradesh, he advocated that the former retain the name &quot;Khariboli&quot; while the latter be renamed to &quot;Kauravi&quot;, after the Kuru Kingdom of ancient India. Although the term &quot;Khariboli&quot; continues to be applied as it traditionally was, some linguists have accepted the term &quot;Kauravi&quot; as well, applying to the language spoken in the linguistic arc running from Saharanpur to Agra (i.e. the close east and northeast of Old Delhi). Sankrityayan postulated that this &quot;Kaurvi&quot; dialect was the parent of Old Delhi&#x27;s specific Khari dialect. Sankrityayan had also advocated that all Hindustani be standardized on the Devanagari script and Perso-Arabic entirely is abandoned.

==Other dialects of Hindustani==
Khariboli is related to four registers of Hindustani, the lingua franca of northern India and Pakistan: Standard Hindi, Standard Urdu, Dakhini and Rekhta. Standard Hindi (also High Hindi, Manak Hindi) is the language of the government and is one of the official languages of India, Standard Urdu is the state language and national language of Pakistan, Dakhini is the historical literary dialect of the Deccan region, and Rekhta the &quot;mixed&quot; Hindustani of medieval poetry. These registers, together with Sansiboli, form the Hindustani dialect group.

==Early influences==
The area around Delhi has long been the center of power in northern India, and naturally, the &quot;Khari Boli&quot; dialect came to be regarded as urbane and of a higher standard than the other surrounding languages. This view gradually gained ground over the 19th century; before that period, other languages such as Awadhi, Braj Bhasha, and Sadhukaddi were preferred by littérateurs.
Standard Hindustani first developed with the migration of Persian Khari Boli speakers from Delhi to the Awadh region—most notably Amir Khusro, mixing the &#x27;roughness&#x27; of Khari Boli with the relative &#x27;softness&#x27; of Awadhi to form a new language which became called &quot;Hindavi.&quot; This also became referred to as Hindustani, which was adopted as Hindi and Urdu by India and Pakistan after partition.

Although as a dialect, Khari Boli belongs to the Upper Doab, &quot;Hindavi&quot; developed in the cultural spheres of Allahabad and Varanasi.

===Rise as the basis for Standard Hindustani===

The earliest examples of Khariboli can be seen in the compositions of Amir Khusro (1253–1325).

Before the rise of Khariboli, the languages adopted by the Bhakti saints: Braj Bhasha (Krishna devotees), Awadhi (adopted by the Rama devotees) and Maithili (Vaishnavites of Bihar). However, after the Bhakti movement became ritualistic, these languages came to be regarded as rural and unrefined. Khariboli, on the other hand, was spoken in the urban area surrounding the Mughal courts, where Persian was the official language. The Persian-influenced Khariboli thus gradually came to be regarded as a prestige dialect, although hardly any literary works had been written in Khariboli before the British period in India.

The European administrators in India and the Christian missionaries played an important role in the creation and promotion of the Khariboli-based modern Hindustani. In 1800, the British East India Company established a college of higher education at Calcutta named the Fort William College. John Borthwick Gilchrist, a president of that college, encouraged his professors to write in their native tongue; some of the works thus produced were in the literary form of the Khariboli dialect. These books included &quot;Premsagar&quot; by Lallu Lal, &quot;Nasiketopakhyan&quot; by Sadal Mishra; &quot;Sukhsagar&quot; by Sadasukh Lal of Delhi and &quot;Rani Ketaki Ki Kahani&quot; by Inshallah Khan. More developed forms of Khariboli can also be seen in some mediocre literature produced in the early 18th century. Examples are &quot;Chand Chhand Varnan Ki Mahima&quot; by Ganga Bhatt, &quot;Yogavashishtha&quot; by Ram Prasad Niranjani, &quot;Gora Badal Ki Katha&quot; by Jatmal, &quot;Mandovar Ka Varnan&quot; by Anonymous, a translation of Ravishenacharya&#x27;s &quot;Jain Padmapuran&quot; by Daulat Ram (dated 1761). With government patronage and literary popularity, the Khariboli flourished, even as the use of previously more literary tongues such as Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili declined in the literary vehicles. The literary works in Khariboli gained momentum from the second half of the 19th century onwards. A prominent Indian historian Raja Sivaprasad was a promoter of the Hindi language, in particular the Khariboli version. Gradually, in the subsequent years, Khariboli became the basis for standard Hindustani, which began to be taught in schools and used in government functions.

Urdu, the heavily Persianised version of Khariboli, replaced Persian as the official language of local administration in North India in the early 19th century. However, the association of the Persian script with Muslims prompted Hindus to develop their own Sanskritised version of the dialect, leading to the formation of Hindi. After India became independent in 1947, the Khariboli-based dialect was officially recognised as the Hindi language, which was declared as one of the official languages for central government functioning.

<doc id="638725" wikidata="Q6827912" url="?curid=638725" title="Micah Wright">
<text>Micah Ian War Dog Wright (born 1969) is an American writer who has worked in film, television, animation, video games and comic books. He is an enrolled member of the Muscogee Creek Nation.

==Early life==
Wright was born in Lubbock, Texas. He graduated from the University of Arizona with degrees in political science and creative writing. While in college, Wright was involved in a weekly sketch comedy show where he started out as a writer and eventually became a performer.

==Career==
===Animation and comics===
After graduating and moving to Los Angeles, Wright started interning at Nickelodeon, before becoming script supervisor and eventually a staff writer on &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot;. In early 2000, a number of writers working on Nickelodeon cartoons contacted the Writers Guild of America to renegotiate the contracts on their behalf and organize a union. At the time, Wright, who also took part in the union drive, was writing and producing the pilot for his own show, &quot;Constant Payne&quot;, a steampunk science fiction series following a family of adventurers co-produced with Madhouse, with an aesthetic inspired by anime, pulp magazines and early Soviet propaganda posters. The show, which would have been Nickelodeon&#x27;s first action adventure offering, was not ordered to series due to the network&#x27;s fears of violent programming in the wake of the September 11 attacks as well as Nickelodeon&#x27;s suspicions that Wright was one of the figureheads in the union organizing effort. Wright has since tried pitching &quot;Constant Payne&quot; to Warner Bros. Animation and to foreign studios as an animated feature-length film but the project remains uncompleted. During his time at Nickelodeon, Wright became friends with Jay Lender, with whom he would collaborate as a writing partner on numerous projects across various media.

At San Diego Comic Con in 2001, Wright, who has been a fan of comics since childhood, was introduced to some of the editors of DC Comics&#x27; Wildstorm imprint through his friend, artist John Cassaday. Wright pitched his idea for a creator-owned &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;-type series, hoping to publish it through the Homage sub-imprint. The editors liked the concept but asked Wright to rework it to fit into the Wildstorm Universe, and the project was eventually developed into a new version of one of the imprint&#x27;s founding titles, &quot;Stormwatch&quot;. &quot;&quot; with art by Whilce Portacio, debuting in July 2002 under the &quot;mature readers&quot; sub-imprint Eye of the Storm, featured a UN-sanctioned team consisting primarily of human soldiers, created in response to the growing superhuman presence in the political areas of the Wildstorm Universe, particularly the events depicted in Mark Millar&#x27;s run on &quot;The Authority&quot;. Despite consistent critical acclaim throughout its run, &quot;Stormwatch&quot;, like other Eye of the Storm titles, suffered from low sales and was ultimately cancelled few issues shy of Wright&#x27;s planned 26-issue storyline. Shortly before the cancellation, the series took part in the line-wide crossover &quot;Coup d&#x27;Etat&quot; which saw The Authority take over the United States, forcing Team Achilles to go on the run.

Soon after the launch of &quot;Stormwatch: Team Achilles&quot;, Wright and artist Mark Robinson created a pitch for the revival of another Wildstorm property, &quot;DV8&quot;, which was rejected due to the low sales of the series&#x27; previous iteration and the creators&#x27; relatively unknown status. In 2003, Wright teamed up with artist Rick Remender to pitch a series focusing on the exploits of a low-ranking member of Advanced Idea Mechanics, a villainous organization operating within the Marvel Universe. The proposal, titled &quot;Joe A.I.M.&quot; and submitted for publication under Marvel&#x27;s briefly revived Epic imprint, was rejected, prompting Wright to share his dissatisfaction with the Epic editorial on his Delphi message board, which resulted in a public dispute between him and Marvel&#x27;s then-Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada. In an interview later that year, Wright expressed regret for making the issue public. Other unproduced projects include &quot;American Cross&quot; with artist Niko Henrichon, a revenge story that takes place during the American Revolution, &quot;Lifer&quot; with artist Steve Pugh, a four-issue military sci-fi series described by Wright as &quot;&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; meets &quot;Catch-22&quot;&quot;, &quot;Los Diablos&quot; with art by Taesoo Kim, a rejected weird western anime pitch repurposed into a comic book series. and &quot;Thunderhead!&quot;, an adult-oriented animated series co-created by Wright and Jay Lender.

===Controversy and fallout===
Outside of his work in animation and comics, Wright gained online popularity with a series of satirical military propaganda posters that combined the imagery of the World War II-era propaganda posters and the modern anti-war messages as slogans. Shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, some of the posters were collected into a book, &quot;You Back the Attack, We&#x27;ll Bomb Who We Want&quot;, with a foreword by Kurt Vonnegut and an introduction by Howard Zinn. Early printings of the book featured another introduction, where Wright described his experiences as a sergeant in the United States Army Rangers who had seen active combat in the 1989 invasion of Panama, a claim he had previously made discussing his military-themed series &quot;Stormwatch: Team Achilles&quot; in various interviews as well as responding to the criticism of his poster work online, and further elaborated upon while promoting &quot;You Back the Attack&quot; with a radio interview on &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; and a profile in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Wright&#x27;s credentials were then questioned by actual Rangers, prompting them to contact &quot;The Post&quot; profile&#x27;s author Richard Leiby, who began researching Wright&#x27;s background. In April 2004, after Wright learned that Leiby was writing an exposé questioning his military service, he confessed that he had never been a Ranger, having only participated in the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps, and apologized online.

The revelation resonated across the comic book industry, attracting responses from a number of industry figures including writers Steven Grant, Jeff Parker, Kurt Busiek and Mark Millar, as well as journalists Tom Spurgeon and Rich Johnston. According to Johnston, the mini-series &quot;Vigilante&quot;, which was supposed to be Wright&#x27;s writing debut in the DC Universe, was already causing internal concern at the company due to the direction and tone of the title, as the titular character eschewed taking down street criminals or organized crime in favor of corporate criminals, and the controversy made it easier to take Wright off the book. Wright responded by stating that the quality of his work was not an issue. Meanwhile, Seven Stories Press, the publisher of &quot;You Back the Attack&quot;, removed Wright&#x27;s introduction from the subsequent printings of the book and cancelled its follow-up volume, &quot;If You&#x27;re Not a Terrorist... Then Stop Asking Questions&quot;, but eventually published the third collection of his poster work in 2006. That same year, the &quot;Vigilante&quot; mini-series, which was never officially confirmed as cancelled, was published with a new creative team and plotline. In a 2012 interview, Wright stated that following the controversy, he was privately told by the representatives of Marvel and DC that he has been blacklisted at both companies.

===Video games and WGA===
Since 2004, Wright has worked primarily in the field of video game writing, often with his long-time writing partner Jay Lender. The pair&#x27;s shared credits include &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; for Electronic Arts, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: Return of the General Lee&quot; for Ubisoft, &quot;Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon&quot; and its sequel for THQ, as well as &quot;Robocalypse&quot; for Vogster. Wright is a member of the Writers Guild of America West, where he is the chair of the Video Game Writers Caucus. In 2007, Wright and Lender were cited as being &quot;instrumental&quot; in creating the WGA&#x27;s first ever Video Game Writing Award as part of the traditional film and television Writers Guild Awards. In 2011, the Video Game Writing Award attracted criticism from various video game websites for being too exclusive, prompting Wright to address the issue online.

In addition to his work at WGA&#x27;s Video Game Writers Caucus, Wright co-founded the Native American and World Indigenous Writers Committee and was elected to be a part of the Guild Negotiating Committee for 2014.

===2010s===
In 2012, Wright returned to comics with the launch of a Kickstarter campaign for &quot;Duster&quot;, a graphic novel he co-created with Jay Lender. The story, initially developed as a film script, depicts the life of a recently widowed female cropduster pilot at the end of World War II and her battle against a group of Nazi soldiers who crash-landed near her farm in West Texas. The graphic novel was eventually published in 2015. That same year, Wright worked as a consultant on HTC Vive&#x27;s virtual reality game &quot;TheBlu&quot;, which led to his interest in VR technology and eventually a position as a teacher of the virtual reality filmmaking course at the Los Angeles branch of Emerson College. In 2016, Wright and Lender made their directorial debut with the feature film &quot;They&#x27;re Watching&quot;, a found footage horror comedy distributed by Amplify.

Between 2017 and 2019, Wright served as the Chief Content Manager of the Native American broadcast television network First Nations Experience, overseeing the creation of first original programming in the network&#x27;s history.

<text>Wilford Daniel White (born February 9, 1952) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback and punter for 13 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He was the third major franchise quarterback in Cowboys history, following Roger Staubach and Don Meredith. White was 62–30 as a starter, was a second team All-Pro selection in 1982, and led the Cowboys to five playoff appearances, with three consecutive appearances in the NFC Championship game from 1980 to 1982. White was also among the last Cowboys quarterbacks in the Tom Landry era, alongside 1988 starter Steve Pelluer.

Upon his retirement, White coached in the Arena Football League (AFL). He has been the color commentator for Cowboys games on Compass Media Networks&#x27; America&#x27;s Team Radio Network since the 2011 season. He played college football for the Arizona State Sun Devils.

==Early life==
A graduate of Westwood High School in Mesa, Arizona, White did not receive a lot of notice while being the starter at quarterback, due to his perception as a better baseball prospect.

Frank Kush, then the football head coach at Arizona State University, helped convince Bobby Winkles, the school&#x27;s baseball coach, to sign White to a scholarship with the provision that he would also play punter for the football team. During those early years Kush gave him a chance to improve his skills as a quarterback, which eventually would lead him to become the starter midway through his sophomore season, ending up throwing for six touchdowns in a game against the University of New Mexico.

White went on to have a stellar career as a quarterback and punter, compiling a 32–4 record, winning three Fiesta Bowls, setting seven NCAA passing records and being named an All-American in 1973, when he led the nation&#x27;s second rated total offense. He finished with 6,717 passing yards, 64 touchdowns, 42 interceptions and averaged 41.7 yards per punt.

Besides having his jersey retired, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, the State of Arizona Sports Hall of Fame, and the Arizona State University Athletics Hall of Fame. In 2000, he was named Arizona Athlete of the Century by the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;. He also was an inaugural member of Dunham and Miller Hall of Fame.

On October 29, 2010, White was honored, along with other Sun Devil Quarterbacks, at a Legends Luncheon hosted by the Arizona State University Alumni Association and Sun Devil Club. Other honorees included John F. Goodman, Andrew Walter, and Jake Plummer.

==Professional career==

===Memphis Southmen===
The Dallas Cowboys selected him in the third round (53rd overall) of the 1974 NFL draft, but were mainly interested in him as a punter, so he chose to sign with the World Football League&#x27;s Memphis Southmen for a better offer.

White shared the quarterback position with John Huarte, helping his team reach the semifinals as a rookie and a second-place finish in 1975. During these two years, he passed for 2,635 yards and 21 touchdowns in 30 games, and also led the league in punting his last year.

===Dallas Cowboys===
In 1976, he signed with the Dallas Cowboys after the World Football League folded. Through 1979, White was the Cowboys&#x27; punter and the backup to the team&#x27;s star quarterback Roger Staubach. After Staubach&#x27;s retirement following the end of that season, White became the Cowboys&#x27; starting quarterback. Until 1984, he continued to serve as the team&#x27;s punter, making him one of the last starting quarterbacks in NFL history to also start at a different position. He punted for the last time in his career once in 1985.

In a memorable 1980 playoff game against the Atlanta Falcons, White led the Cowboys to a come-from-behind 30–27 victory. He also played in one of the Cowboys&#x27; most painful playoff losses against the San Francisco 49ers in the 1981 NFC Championship Game, famous for the Joe Montana-to-Dwight Clark game-winning play, which would simply come to be known as &quot;The Catch&quot;. White threw for 173 yards, 2 TDs and 1 INT, and his passer rating in the game was actually higher than Montana&#x27;s, 98.1 vs. 81.4. He received Pro Bowl and second-team All-Pro honors in 1982.

White led the Cowboys to three consecutive NFC Championship Games (1980–1982). The Cowboys were favored to win all three games even though they played on the road against the NFC&#x27;s top seeded team in each game - even, oddly, in 1982 when the Cowboys&#x27; and Redskins&#x27; regular season records were 6-3 and 8-1 respectively. White received criticism, some unfairly, after the Cowboys lost all three games. White was criticized during the 1982 NFL Players Strike by teammate Tony Dorsett for crossing the picket line citing financial reasons, though Dorsett himself was criticized for crossing the picket line with his own financial concerns soon after. Fans and teammates alike began to show support for him to be replaced as the Cowboys quarterback by Gary Hogeboom, who had thrown two touchdowns in the 1982 NFC Championship Game (which they lost to the archrival Washington Redskins) after White was knocked out of the game with a concussion. Even his statistically career-best 1983 season failed to silence the critics, after ending it with consecutive blowout losses to the Redskins (at home) and the 49ers after a 12–2 start. To add insult to injury, the Cowboys lost the NFC Wildcard Playoff game to the Los Angeles Rams. That apparently was enough for him to lose his starting job to Hogeboom at the start of the 1984 season. Under Hogeboom, the Cowboys looked impressive with a 4–1 start, but then a loss to division rival St. Louis and ineffective plays by Hogeboom convinced coach Tom Landry to reinstate White as his starter. The Cowboys finished 9–7, but missed the playoffs in 1984 for the first time in a decade; but with White as quarterback, the Cowboys made it back in 1985 with a 10–6 record. However, they lost again to the Los Angeles Rams in the playoffs.

In 1986, the Cowboys started 6–2, had the #1 offense in the NFL, were tied for the lead in the NFC Eastern Division and White was also the number one rated passer in the NFC at that point in the season. During an away game against Bill Parcells&#x27;s New York Giants, however, a blind-side sack by Giants linebacker Carl Banks broke White&#x27;s throwing wrist and tore ligaments, knocking him out of the game and ending his season. Dallas lost the game, 17–14, and without him the team faded badly, finishing the year 7–9 and the Cowboys first losing season since 1965.

White returned as the starter at the beginning of 1987, but after inconsistent play, he was benched in favor of Steve Pelluer for 4 of the final 6 games. In 1988, Pelluer won the starting job in training camp, relegating White as a backup. White appeared briefly in only two games, and in his second game he suffered a season-ending knee injury. An option on his contract was not picked up in April 1989 and he announced his retirement on July 12, 1989, paving the way for the recently drafted Troy Aikman to take the reins of the by-then struggling franchise.

White had 1,761 completions on 2,950 attempts for 21,959 yards, 155 touchdowns, and 132 interceptions in his career. He also gained 482 yards and scored 8 touchdowns rushing. Unusual for a quarterback, he had two pass receptions for touchdowns, both from a halfback option pass. On special teams he punted 610 times for 24,509 yards, an average of 40.4 yards per punt, with 144 punts inside the 20 and 77 touchbacks. His record as the Cowboys&#x27; starting quarterback was 62–30 (.659 winning percentage) during the regular season, and 5–5 in the playoffs.

Being Roger Staubach&#x27;s successor and never reaching a Super Bowl as a starting quarterback contributed to White&#x27;s being an unappreciated player, even considering all of the successes he achieved for the Cowboys and the NFL during the decade of the eighties. &quot;I don&#x27;t think anybody could have followed Roger and done as well as Danny&quot;, Coach Tom Landry remarked, &quot;Danny was a solid winner.&quot;

==Coaching career==
White&#x27;s career as a coach began shortly after his playing days ended. This is appropriate considering that, while an active player, he was widely regarded—like Staubach before him—as knowledgeable of the game and as something of a coach on the field. He also began working as a broadcast commentator during his coaching career, which was possible because he coached Arena football, which is played during the outdoor game&#x27;s off-season.

White served as the head coach of the Arizona Rattlers from 1992 to 2004, winning the ArenaBowl championship in 1994 and 1997. White&#x27;s contract was not renewed by the new Rattlers ownership after the 2004 season following three consecutive ArenaBowl losses. He was named the head coach of the Arena Football League expansion Utah Blaze, which began play in 2006. He led his teams to the playoffs in 10 of 11 seasons, including two championships (1994 and 1997), finishing with a 162–95 record as a head coach.

In 2002, he was inducted into the Arena Football League Hall of Fame in recognition for his coaching success.

===Head coaching record===
==Personal life==
White&#x27;s father, Wilford &quot;Whizzer&quot; White (no relation to Byron White, who also was nicknamed &quot;Whizzer&quot; and played American football), was the first Arizona State University All-American football player and still ranks third in school history with 1,502 rushing yards in a season (1950), he also played halfback for the Chicago Bears from 1951 to 1952.

In 1983, White briefly recorded as a country music artist for the Grand Prix label. His only single, &quot;You&#x27;re a Part of Me&quot;, a duet with Linda Nail, reached #85 on the Hot Country Songs charts.

White and his wife, JoLynn, have four children, Ryan (d. 2015), Geoff, Heather and Reed, and sixteen grandchildren. He now makes corporate appearances and motivational speeches. JoLynn died on August 15, 2016. White is currently married to Linda L. Bang. In recent years he has been seen on TV doing ADT security infomercials.

White is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

<doc id="638733" wikidata="Q235476" url="?curid=638733" title="Blanche of Navarre, Queen of France">
<text>Blanche of Navarre (; 1331 – 5 October 1398) was a Navarrese infanta who was briefly Queen of France as the second wife of King Philip VI from 29 January until 22 August 1350.

Blanche d&#x27;Évreux was intended to become the bride of John, Duke of Normandy, heir of the throne of France — whose first wife had just died of the Black Death— but eventually married his father, King Philip. Only a few months after their wedding, Philip died prematurely and Blanche found herself a widow.

After giving birth in 1351 to a posthumous daughter, Blanche refused to remarry King Peter of Castile and retired to the large dower lands that were granted by her late husband. Despite her widowhood, she played an essential role in 1354 by attempting to reconcile her brother Charles II of Navarre with John II of France. In 1389, she organized the coronation of Isabeau of Bavaria, the wife of King Charles VI of France.

==Life==
Born around 1331, Blanche was the third daughter of King Philip III and Queen Joan II of Navarre; by both her paternal and maternal ancestry, she belonged to the House of Capet.

Blanche was engaged on 19 August 1335 to Andrew, only son and heir of the Dauphin Humbert II of Viennois, but the project was abandoned after the premature death of her fiancé two months later. Then, on 15 March 1340, a marriage contract was signed between Blanche and Louis of Male, only son and heir of Louis I, Count of Flanders, which provided for payment of a dowry of 50,000 livres for the Infanta of Navarre. The engagement was nullified on 6 June 1347 by the marriage of Louis of Male to Margaret, daughter of John III, Duke of Brabant. Finally, on 1 July 1345, while still officially engaged with the heir of Flanders, a marriage contract was drawn up between Blanche and Peter, son and heir of King Alfonso XI of Castile. Nevertheless, it was almost immediately abandoned by the Castilian court in favor of a marriage with Joan, daughter of King Edward III of England.

==Queenship==
On 29 January 1350 at Brie-Comte-Robert, Blanche married King Philip VI of France, forty years her senior. Initially, she was intended to marry John, Duke of Normandy, heir of the throne of France. However, King Philip VI became captivated by her beauty and decided to marry her instead; explaining her reputation as one of the most beautiful princesses of her time and her nickname &quot;Beautiful Wisdom&quot; (). The Duke of Normandy was married to Blanche&#x27;s first cousin Joan I, Countess of Auvergne. As the chronicler Jean Le Bel recounts:

Due to the Black Death that spread throughout the kingdom, the new Queen of France was not crowned after the wedding ceremony. Blanche&#x27;s union with King Philip VI only lasted six months before he suddenly died on 22 August 1350. According to some chroniclers, his death was due to exhaustion from constantly fulfilling his conjugal duties. Pregnant by her late husband, Blanche gave birth to her daughter Joan in May 1351. 

Since the announcement of the death of King Philip VI, Pope Clement VI considered the remarriage of Blanche with her former fiancé, King Peter of Castile, to strengthen the links between the Kingdoms of Castile and France. After discussing it with Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz, Archbishop of Toledo, and Pedro, Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, the Pope wrote on this subject on 5 October 1350 to Blanche&#x27;s brother, King Charles II of Navarre, who had encouraged her marriage to Philip VI a few months before. The marriage plan was temporarily put on hold due to Blanche&#x27;s pregnancy, but the Pope insisted that she be married after she gave birth. However, she refused to consider a second marriage and is said to have even declared, &quot;The Queens of France do not remarry&quot; (). Tenacious, the pontiff wrote in March 1352 to Joan of Évreux —Blanche&#x27;s paternal aunt and also Dowager Queen of France— in order to make her change her mind, but the widow of Philip VI resolutely rejected the papal proposal.
==Retirement==
Once widowed, Blanche retired to the residence of Neaufles-Saint-Martin, located near Gisors, which her husband had granted her as her dower land. She devoted herself to the education of her daughter Joan, whose marriage contract with Infante John, Duke of Girona, son and heir of King Peter IV of Aragon, was signed on 16 July 1370; unfortunately, the princess died on 16 September 1371 in Béziers on her way to Perpignan to celebrate her wedding. Blanche&#x27;s retirement did not prevent her from temporarily returning to the court of King John II, whom she tried to bring closer to her brother King Charles II of Navarre. Thus, after the assassination of Charles de la Cerda on 8 January 1354, she persuaded the French monarch to sign the Treaty of Mantes with the King of Navarre on 22 February of the same year.

Blanche had an influential presence under the reign of King Charles VI of France. On 2 October 1380, she attended the proclamation of the end of the regency of the young sovereign at the Palais de la Cité, and on 18 July 1385, she welcomed his new wife Isabeau of Bavaria at Creil. Blanche was charged with teaching the new Queen the traditions and etiquette of the French court. On 22 August 1389, she organized the Joyous Entry of Queen Isabeau in Paris, which preceded her coronation the next day. During the coronation ceremony in Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, Blanche attended on Charles VI, along with her cousin Princess Blanche of France, Duchess of Orleans, youngest daughter of King Charles IV of France and Joan of Évreux. After this ceremony, Blanche withdrew to Neaufles-Saint-Martin and died on 5 October 1398, aged 67. She was buried in the royal necropolis at the Basilica of Saint-Denis next to her daughter. Her tomb, like many other royal ones, was desecrated on 17 October 1793 by the revolutionaries.

<text>Qom (; ) is a city in the Central District of Qom County, Qom province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district. It is the seventh largest metropolis and also the seventh largest city in Iran. The city is to the south of Tehran, and on the banks of the Qom River.

Qom is considered holy in Shi&#x27;a Islam, as it is the site of the shrine of Fatimah bint Musa, sister of Imam Ali ibn Musa Rida (Persian: &quot;Imam Reza&quot;; 789–816). The city is the largest center for Shi&#x27;a scholarship in the world and is a significant destination of pilgrimage, with around twenty million pilgrims visiting the city every year, the majority being Iranians but also other Shi&#x27;a Muslims from all around the world. 

Qom has developed into a lively industrial center owing, in part, to its proximity to Tehran. It is a regional center for the distribution of petroleum and petroleum products, and a natural gas pipeline from Bandar Anzali and Tehran and a crude oil pipeline from Tehran run through Qom to the Abadan refinery on the Persian Gulf. Qom gained additional prosperity when oil was discovered at Sarajeh near the city in 1956 and a large refinery was built between Qom and Tehran.

==Etymology==
Some researchers have considered the word &quot;Kom&quot; (in the ancient name of Komidan (Komiran)) to mean &quot;city&quot; and believe that there is a lexical connection between the words &quot;Komiran&quot;, &quot;Shemiran (near Tehran)&quot;, &quot;Tehran&quot;, &quot;Chamran (in Saveh areas)&quot; and &quot;Iran&quot;, and they considered the old name of Qom to be &quot;Komiran&quot; (in the meaning of &quot;Iran city&quot;).

==History==

The present town of Qom in Central Iran dates back to ancient times. Its pre-Islamic history can be partially documented, although the earlier epochs remain unclear. Excavations at Tepe Sialk indicate that the region had been settled since ancient times (Ghirshman and Vanden Berghe), and more recent surveys have revealed traces of large, inhabited places south of Qom, dating from the 4th and 1st millennium BC. While nothing is known about the area from Elamite, Medes, and Achaemenid times, there are significant archeological remains from the Seleucid and Parthian epochs, of which the ruins of Khurha (about southwest of Qom) are the most famous and important remnants. Their dating and function have instigated long and controversial debates and interpretations, for they have been interpreted and explained variously as the remains of a Sasanian temple, or of a Seleucid Dionysian temple, or of a Parthian complex. Its true function is still a matter of dispute, but the contributions by Wolfram Kleiss point to a Parthian palace that served as a station on the nearby highway and was used until Sasanian times.

The recently published results of the excavations carried out in 1955 by Iranian archeologists have, however, revived the old thesis of a Seleucid religious building. Besides Khurha, which is already mentioned as Khor Abad at Qomi in the 9th century, the region has turned up a few other remnants from this epoch, including the four Parthian heads found near Qom, now kept in the National Museum of Iran in Tehran. Qomi names Parthian personalities as founders of villages in the Qom area. The possible mention of Qom in the form of Greek names in two ancient geographical works (the Tabula Peutingera and Ptolemy&#x27;s geographical tables) remains doubtful.
The Sasanian epoch offers many archeological findings and remnants, besides the fact that various sources mention Qom. The most interesting building from an archeological point of view is the Qalʿa-ye Doḵtar in Qom itself, which was long thought to have served religious purposes, while more recent research points to an administrative use. The wider surroundings of Qom also contain numerous traces from palaces, religious, military and administrative buildings. Some of these are mentioned by Qomi, who also names many more fire temples in the urban area of present Qom and its region, of which no archeological traces are left although the location of one fire temple can probably be equated with today&#x27;s Masjed-e Emām in the city. According to Qomi, the most important fire temple of the area stood in the nearby village of Dizijan.

Tāriḵ-e Qom and some other sources also speak of genuine historical figures of the Sasanian epoch in connection with Qom and its region. They shed new light on the time of the seizure of power by the first Sasanian king Ardashir I, who fought his decisive battles near Qom, and the collapse of the Sasanian empire, which is extensively reported by Ebn Aʿṯam Kufi and the Nehāyat al-Erab and names a certain Šērzād as the satrap of the region. The existence of an urban settlement in the Sasanian epoch is furthermore verified by Middle Persian sources (literary sources, inscriptions, and seals) that mention in the time of Shapur I and Kawād I the names Godmān/Gomān and Ērān Win(n)ārd Kawād, both of which could be identified as Qom. Altogether one can assume that Qom functioned as a small administrative unit throughout the whole Sasanian era. Probably the urban structure of the Sasanian settlement of Qom can be compared with the type of city of Ctesiphon (Or. Madāʾen) and consisted of several villages and little towns with Abaraštejān, Mamajjān and Jamkarān as the bigger settlements that were loosely connected by defense installations.

It is difficult to decipher the actual process of the Arab conquest of Qom from the extant Arabic sources. According to Balāḏori, the first tentative conquest of Qom took place in 23/644 by Abu Musa Ashaari after a few days of fighting (although Abu Musa&#x27;s route through Western Persia, as narrated by Balāḏori, appears somewhat confusing). It remains unclear who the defenders of Qom were; probably fleeing Sasanian nobles and local soldiers returning from the great battles against the Arabs formed the core of the resistance. The area remained largely untouched for 60 years after the initial conquest and was probably administered from Isfahan.

The first permanent settlement of Arab settlers in Qom took place during the revolts of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi and Moṭarref b. Moḡira b. Šaʿba in 66–77/685–96, when small groups of refugees moved there and Qom itself was affected by the fighting between the Umayyad state power and the rebels

The decisive step for the later urban development of Qom occurred when a group of Ashaari Arabs came to the area. These Ashaaries originated in Yemen and the first important figure among them was the first conqueror of the area of Qom, the above-mentioned Abu Musa Ashaari. ʿAbd-Allāh b. Saʿd and Aḥwaṣ b. Saʿd were grandsons of Abi Musa&#x27;s nephew and led the group of Ashaaries that emigrated from Kufa to the region of Qom. It is not exactly clear why they migrated, but it might have also been a general opposition to the Umayyad dynasty. A central element was the early contact with the leading local Zoroastrian Persian noble Yazdanfadar.

As the Arabs required a great deal of pasture for their large herds of cattle and were much wealthier than the local Persians, they slowly started to buy land and take over more villages. The decisive step for controlling the area was the elimination of the local Persian noble class that took place after the death of Yazdanfadar in 733. 
Although a few names of governors and their tax assessments are known from the time after the administrative independence, the death of Fātimah bint Mūsā, the sister of the eighth Imam of Shias Ali al-Ridha in the city in 201/816–17 proved to be of great importance for the later history of Qom. Fātimah bint Mūsā died while following her brother to Khorasan, a region in northern Iran. The place of her entombment developed from 869–70 into a building that was transformed over time into today&#x27;s magnificent and economically important sanctuary.

In 825–26, a major rebellion against the tax regulations of the caliphate broke out in Qom. It was caused by the refusal of the caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun to lower the yearly tax assessment as he had done in Ray. The revolt was led by an Ashaari named Yahya ibn Emran, maintaining that taxes should not be paid to an unlawful ruler. Yahya was killed by troops sent by the caliph and the citizens were severely punished; the taxes were raised from 2 million to 7 million dirhams. Two years later the taxes were again raised by 700,000 dirham by the Ashaari governor Ali ibn Isa, who was subsequently deposed because he was strongly rejected by the inhabitants of Qom. But in 833 Ali returned to the post of governor (wali) and forcefully collected tax debts that were laid upon him by the caliph. He destroyed parts of Qom and handed over a wanted rebel to caliphal authorities under Al-Moʿtasem. Between 839–42 two contradicting tax assessments were carried out under turbulent circumstances which amounted to a sum of 5 million dirhams. The names of those involved have survived.

The move of a Hadith transmitter from Kufa to Qom, which took place probably in the middle of the 9th century, indicates the increased importance of Qom as a center of Shia learning. At about the same time another military attack on the city occurred in 254/868, when Mofleḥ, the Turkish officer of the caliph Al-Mostaʿin, executed some of its inhabitants because of the city&#x27;s refusal to pay taxes. Mofleḥ became governor of Qom and lasted in that position for at least five years. During his governorship important Alids moved to Qom and there are references to close contacts between the representative of the 11th Shia&#x27;s Imam, Hassan al-Askari, in Qom and other Qomis. The representative Aḥmad b. Esḥāq was at the same time administrator of the Fāṭema sanctuary and the agent (wakil) responsible for the pensions of the Alids.

The first Friday mosque in Qom was built in 878–79 on the site of a fire temple, although there are also confusing reports concerning a possible earlier Friday mosque. In 881–82 Qom was occupied by the Turkish military leader Edgu Tegin (Arabic: Yadkutakin b. Asātakin or Aḏkutakin), who tried to collect the tax arrears for seven years which partially ruined the guarantors (some of whom are known) of these taxes. At about the same time the early orthodox Shias achieved their victory in the town. In 893–94, at the latest, all extremists (ḡolāt) were driven out of town by the leading Shia shaikh of Qom, Aḥmad b. Moḥammed b. Isa Ashaari. Probably one year later, in 1895, the famous Islamic mystic Ḥosayn b. Manṣur Ḥallaj stayed in Qom, where he was arrested.

From 895–96 onwards the history of Qom was connected with a family of Turkish military leaders from the army of the caliph Al-Mu&#x27;tadid, including the governor Berun (Birun). In the same year, Berun destroyed a big and probably still active fire temple located on the territory of the evolving city and probably opposite today&#x27;s sanctuary of Fātimah bint Mūsā. In these unstable political times, Qom was visited by the vizier of Al-Moʿtazed, Obayd-Allah ibn Solayman, and two tax assessments were organized. An administrative peculiarity of Qom was put to an end at about the same time, to wit the independent appointment of judges through the Arab inhabitants of Qom until the time of al-Moktafi, which, together with the dispatch of a joint Arab-Persian delegation to the vizier Ḥamid ibn Abbas indicate the end of the elevated position of the Arabs in Qom. The period of the governor Abbas ibn Amr Ganawi (292–96/904–09) is remarkable for the presence of non-Twelver Shias in Qom and the establishment of the office of the jahbaḏ (financial officer) as the tax broker for the city, which fostered local self-determination.

In 909 Hosayn ibn Hamdan ibn Hamdun was appointed governor of Qom and Kāšān by the caliph Al-Moqtader and had to assist the caliph&#x27;s army against the Saffarids in Fars. Altogether he stayed in power only for two years before he had to return to Baghdad. In the years 301/913–14 to 315/927, the people of Qom had, besides another tax assessment (meanwhile the eighth), a caliphal intervention that resulted in the appointment of a governor to stabilize the administrative grip over the region. This move caused more unrest and affected the balance of power in an area that was disputed between the powers of the time (Daylamites, Samanids). Beginning in 316/928 Qom fell into the sphere of interest of Daylami warlords and was relieved from the direct authority of the caliph, although it changed hands several times between 928 and 943. The Daylamites brutally exploited the city through harsh taxes. With the firm establishment of Buyids control from 340/951–52 on, the political circumstances were less troubled than before, although the economic situation deteriorated.

No outstanding events are reported for the relatively stable political period until 988–89, but Qom seems to have been isolated inside Persia because of its Shia creed. At the same time, the Fatima sanctuary was enlarged and the number of sayyeds residing in Qom reached a considerable number. In 373/984, Qom and its environs were impacted by the revolt of the Kurdish Moḥammad Barzikāni against the Buyid Fakr-Al-Dawla.

The population amounted to 50,000 inhabitants at the most and consisted of Persians and Arabs who had adopted the Persian of the time as their language and many social customs from the Persians, whose proportion was probably smaller than the Arabs. The Kurds lived in the countryside to the west. The Twelver Shia constituted the great majority of the population and many important Shia scholars of the time came from Qom or lived there. As many as 331 male Alids lived in Qom in 988–89, and they produced a good number of community leaders and there is also mention of one prominent female ʿAlid besides Fātimah bint Mūsā. These Alids descended from the Imams and were supported by pensions.

Apart from the Shia mainstream, other Shia sects existed in the city and one can also assume the presence of Sunnies. Ḏemmis, or followers of other revealed religions (Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians) must have lived in the city, too, as the payment of poll tax (jezya) indicates, although their number can only be very roughly estimated at a few thousand at the end of the 9th century and must have shrunk drastically in the 10th century. The majority of these non-Muslims were Zoroastrians, who made their living mostly as farmers. Jews must have lived in Qom as well, but information on them is scant. It is striking that the formerly dominant Ashaaries had lost their leading positions by the end of the 10th century. This points at a new social situation that allowed assimilated Persians to join the local establishment.

The city&#x27;s topography in the 10th century still reflected the evolutionary merging of the original six villages; these were still separated by fields. The town center was located in the village of Mamajjān, which was connected to other parts of the city on the other side of the river by four bridges. There were about eight squares whose function is not clear and three mosques within the city. There is almost no information about madrasas. The sanctuary must have still been quite small as only two cupolas are mentioned. A bazaar and bathhouses must have existed, too, as well as certain administrative buildings (prison, mint). Five bigger and eight smaller roads indicate good traffic connections, which were supported by at least three or maybe even nine city gates.

Qom was then in a difficult economic and social position. Many houses inside the city as well as bridges and mills were ruined, and the roads and agriculture were suffering from an insecure situation. This has to be attributed to difficult social circumstances and excessive taxation. The water supply seems to have been satisfactory and the Ashaaries seem to have undertaken continuous renovation works on the irrigation channels between 733 and 900. The Ašʿaris were also the proprietors of the water rights, which were safeguarded in the water authority (divān-e āb) that regulated the water shares. The system made the Ašʿaris the wealthiest inhabitants of Qom and stayed in place until 347/958–59 when they were expropriated by the Buyids, which consequently brought about a decline in the whole system of irrigation. Although there were attempts at restoration in 371/981–82, only three of originally twenty-one channels had flowing water which meant enough drinking water was supplied for the population, but the available amount could not have been adequate for agricultural purposes.

Altogether the state of cultivation in Qom seems to have resembled that of the other regions of Persia, although the thirty different crops and plants are only indirectly mentioned in connection with the tax assessments. The soil is reported to have good quality and produced big quantities of food. Little is known about animal husbandry in the region, but the considerable number of fifty-one mills existed, of which a fifth was in decay. Legends speak of mineral deposits and mines of silver, iron, gold and lead, while Kurds seem to have produced salt from a lake nearby (see Qom Lake). The production of chairs, textiles, and saddle equipment indicates craftsmanship.

The city&#x27;s taxation has to be distinguished between the more proper rule of the Abbasid tax bureaucracy and the time of the Deylamid warlords where rules were bent arbitrarily. A stunning diversity of taxes is known (often meant to serve the Abbasid bureaucracy and the Deylamid and Buyid war machinery) but the Karaj (land tax), which was composed of many different separate sums, was the most important single tax existing in Qom at least since post-Sasanian times. Within the known 18 tax figures ranging over 160 years there are great differences and the tax figures vary from 8 million to 2 million dirhams with a mean value at around 3 million. In taxation Qom always followed the solar calendar with its own local variation, starting from the death of the Sasanian Yazdegerd III. A highly differentiated tax administration existed and is known in great detail; 24 tax collectors (ʿommāl) are listed from 189/804–05 to 371/981–82 plus two jahabaḏa who acted as mediators after the attempt to enforce collective responsibility by the taxpayers had failed. The information in the Tāriḵ-e Qom on taxation also mention by name 21 tax districts (rasātiq) in the region with 900 villages.

Little is known about the time until the period of Seljuki dominance. In 387/997, Qom became involved in internal Buyid quarrels and was subsequently unsuccessfully besieged. In 418/1027–28, Qom fell under the rule of Šahryuš from the Kakuyid dynasty and a few years later (1030–40) it became part of the Ghaznavid domain. The Seljuki did not occupy Qom at once but left the town and Jebāl in Kakuyid hands for ten years. From 442/1050–51 on, the city was under Seljuk rule and nothing is known about its fate until 487/1094. Afterwards the growing instability of the Seljuk empire involved Qom in the power struggles between the competing Seljuk factions in Jebāl and the city changed hands many times. The most stable period seems to have been the 14 years (513–27/1119–33) when Qom lay in Sanjar&#x27;s sphere of power and witnessed the construction of a second Friday mosque.

Qom enjoyed relative prosperity in its economy in the Seljuk period. The rigidly Sunni Seljuks seem to have practiced a pragmatic policy and one of the main sources of this time (ʿAbd-al-Jalil Qazvini) speaks of good relations between the famous vizier Nizam al-Mulk and Seljuk sultans on the one hand, and members of the local nobility on the other. Sultans reportedly visited the sanctuary (although no specific sultan is mentioned by name) and in general no religiously motivated punitive action against Qom is known to have taken place. Under Seljuk rule a considerable number of religious buildings were erected. At least ten madrasas are known by name. Two Friday mosques seem to have existed in Seljuk times: the old one was renovated and a new one, located outside of the town area, was built in 528/1133–34 by the order of Sultan Togrel II (&quot;Persian:&quot; ). Qom must have expanded during this period, but precise reasons for its prosperity are not known. A family of Ḥosaynid Alids was influential and provided a number of community leaders. Another important Shia family was that of the Daʿwidār (&quot;Persian:&quot; ), whose members were judges (&quot;Arabic:&quot; ) in town, which indicates the transformation of Qom from a town governed by the Sunnis to a completely Shai domain.

The following epochs of the Eldiguzids and Khawrazmshahs lasted for almost 30 years and brought different systems of rule in quick succession. The two noteworthy events of this period are the execution of ʿEzz-al-Din Yaḥyā, the naqib of the Shias, by the Tekesh in 592/1196 and the work on the tiles of the sanctuary (probably in 605–13/1208–17), which indicate a certain economic prosperity at a time of unstable political conditions. From 614/1217–18 until the Mongol attack, Qom remained under Muhammad II of Khwarezm.

The Mongol invasion led to the total destruction of Qom by the armies of the Mongol generals, Jebe and Sübedei, in 621/1224 and left the city in ruins for at least twenty years, when the sources (Jovayni) tell of the levying of taxes. Twenty years later, reconstruction and repair works, probably sponsored by some wealthy inhabitants, were being done on the mausoleums of Shia saints in the city, which contradict those sources, such as Ḥamd-Allāh Mostawfi, that describe Qom as a ruined and depopulated city throughout the Ilkhanid period. Besides, the fact that the Ilkhanid vizier Šams-al-Din Jovayni took refuge in the Fātimah bint Mūsā sanctuary in 683/1284, indicates that the city must have experienced at least a modest comeback. The city walls were probably rebuilt and, moreover, four graves of saints are known to have been constructed between 720/1301 and 1365. Additionally, some fine tiles are known from this period. Nothing is known about the irrigation systems of the town, but nearby a dam was built in the Ilkhanid period and the local administration must have functioned again, as the name of a judge shows. The agricultural situation is described as flourishing with a variety of cultivated plants and a good supply of water, and legends indicate the use of deposits of mineral resources. Information exists concerning taxes for the post-Mongolian period. Qom paid 40,000 dinars, but more remarkable is the fact that some of the surrounding rural districts paid as much as Qom or even more, which suggests that the whole administrative structure of districts had also changed.

In the late 14th century, the city was plundered by Tamerlane and the inhabitants were massacred. Qom gained special attention and gradually developed due to its religious shrine during the Saffavid dynasty. By 1503, Qom became one of the important centers of theology in relation to Shia Islam and became a significant religious pilgrimage site and pivot.

The city suffered heavy damage again during the Afghan invasions, resulting in consequent severe economic hardships. Qom further sustained damage during the reign of Nader Shah and the conflicts between the two households of Zandieh and Qajariyeh in order to gain power over Iran. Finally in 1793 Qom came under the control of Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar. On being victorious over his enemies, the Qajar Sultan Fath Ali Shah was responsible for the repairs done on the sepulchre and Holy Shrine of Hæzræt Mæ&#x27;sume, as he had made such a vow.

The city of Qom began another era of prosperity in the Qajar era. After Russian forces entered Karaj in 1915, many of the inhabitants of Tehran moved to Qom due to reasons of proximity, and the transfer of the capital from Tehran to Qom was even discussed. But the British and Russians defeated prospects of the plan by putting Ahmad Shah Qajar under political pressure. 

As a center of religious learning Qom fell into decline for about a century from 1820 to 1920 but had a resurgence when Shaykh Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi accepted an invitation to move from Sultanabad (now called Arak, Iran), where he had been teaching, to Qom.

In 1964–65, before his exile from Iran, the Ayatollah Khomeini led his opposition to the Pahlavi dynasty from Qom. On 19 February 2020, the Iranian Students News Agency reported that the first two cases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran were detected in Qom.

==Demographics==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 957,496 in 241,827 households. The following census in 2011 counted 1,074,036 people in 299,752 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 1,201,158 people in 356,976 households.

==Geography==
Qom, the capital of Qom province, is located 125 kilometers south of Tehran, on a low plain. The shrine of Fatimeh Masumeh, the sister of Imam Reza, is located in this city, which is considered by Shiʿa Muslims holy. The city is located in the boundary of the central desert of Iran (&quot;Kavir-e Markazi&quot;). At the 2011 census its population was 1,074,036, comprising 545,704 males and 528,332 females.

Qom is a focal center of the Shiʿah. Since the revolution, the clerical population has risen from around 25,000 to more than 45,000 and the non-clerical population has more than tripled to about 700,000. Substantial sums of money in the form of alms and Islamic taxes flow into Qom to the ten &quot;Marja&#x27;-e taqlid&quot; or &quot;Source to be Followed&quot; that reside there. The number of seminary schools in Qom is now over fifty, and the number of research institutes and libraries somewhere near two hundred and fifty.

Its theological center and the Fatima Masumeh Shrine are prominent features of Qom. Another very popular religious site of pilgrimage formerly outside the city of Qom but now more of a suburb is called Jamkaran. Qom&#x27;s proximity to Tehran has allowed the clerical establishment easy access to monitor the affairs and decisions of state. Many Grand Ayatollahs possess offices in both Tehran and Qom; many people simply commute between the two cities as they are only apart. Southeast of Qom is the ancient city of Kashan. Directly south of Qom lie the towns of Delijan, Mahallat, Naraq, Pardisan City, Kahak, and Jasb. The surrounding area to the west of Qom is populated by Tafresh, Saveh, and Ashtian and Jafarieh. Arak city (Industrial Capital of Iran) is in the southwest of Qom.
===Climate===
Qom has a hot desert climate bordering a cold desert climate based on Köppen climate classification (&quot;BWh&quot; bordering on &quot;BWk&quot;) and has an arid climate based on Trewartha climate classification (&quot;BW&quot;), with low annual rainfall due to remoteness from the sea and being situated in the vicinity of the subtropical anticyclone aloft. Summer weather is very hot and essentially rainless, whilst in winter weather can vary from warm to – when Siberian air masses are driven south across the Alborz Mountains by blocking over Europe – frigid. An example of the latter situation was in January 2008 when minima fell to on the 15th, whilst earlier similar situations occurred in January 1964 and to a lesser extent January 1950, January 1972 and December 1972.

The highest recorded temperature was on 11 July 2010 and the lowest recorded temperature was on 15 January 2008.

==Governance==
Authority for the city lies with the mayor, who is elected by a municipal board. The municipal board is periodically elected by the city&#x27;s residents. The municipal central office is located on Saheli Street. The current mayor of Qom is Mohammad Delbari.

==Educational institutions==

Qom is well known for its many religious seminaries and institutes that offer advanced religious studies, which made this city the largest center for Shia scholarship in the world. There are an estimated 50,000 seminarians in the city coming from 80 countries, including Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Pakistan. Qom has seminaries for women and some non-Shia students. Most of the seminaries teach their students modern social sciences and Western thought as well as traditional religious studies.

===Hawzah &#x27;Ilmiyya Qom (Qom Seminary)===
The Hawzah (a short form of al-Hawzah al-Ilmiyya), which presently consists of over 200 education and research centres and organisations, catering for over 40,000 scholars and students from over 80 sovereign states. The modern Qom hawza was revitalized by Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi and Grand Ayatollah Borujerdi and is barely a century old. There are nearly 300,000 clerics in Iran&#x27;s seminaries.

===Fordow uranium enrichment facility===

The Fordow uranium enrichment facility is located 20 miles north east of Qom. In January 2012 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that Iran had started producing uranium enriched up to 20% for medical purposes and that material &quot;remains under the agency&#x27;s containment and surveillance.&quot; Iranian authorities state the facility is built deep in a mountain because of repeated threats by Israel to attack such facilities, which Israel believes can be used to produce nuclear weapons. However, attacking a nuclear facility so close to a city considered so holy in Shia Islam brings concern of a potential risk of a Shiite religious response.

==Transportation==
The city has a number of streets and roadways.

It will be served by Qom International Airport which is under construction.

<text>The West Coast offense is an offense in American football that places a greater emphasis on passing than on running.

There are two similar but distinct National Football League (NFL) offensive strategic systems that are commonly referred to as &quot;West Coast offenses&quot;. Originally, the term referred to the Air Coryell system popularized by Don Coryell with the San Diego Chargers. Following a journalistic error, however, it now more commonly refers to the offensive system devised by Bill Walsh while he was the offensive coordinator of the Cincinnati Bengals. The offense is characterized by short, horizontal passing routes in lieu of running plays to &quot;stretch out&quot; defenses, opening up the potential for long runs or long passes. It was popularized when Walsh was the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.

== History and use of the term ==

The term &quot;West Coast offense&quot;, though most often associated with Cincinnati Bengals quarterback coach and, later, San Francisco 49ers head coach Bill Walsh, may actually derive from a remark made by then New York Giants coach Bill Parcells after the Giants defeated the 49ers 17–3 in the 1985 NFL Playoffs. Parcells—a believer in &quot;old-school&quot; tough defense over finesse-oriented offense featuring frequent, high-percentage passing— derided the 49ers&#x27; offense with the statement: &quot;What do you think of that West Coast Offense now?&quot; In 1993, a Bernie Kosar quotation used to describe the 1993 Dallas Cowboys&#x27; offense as &quot;West Coast offense&quot; was publicized by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Paul Zimmerman (&quot;Dr. Z&quot;). Originally, Kosar had meant a comparison with the &quot;Air Coryell&quot; system used by West Coast teams in the 1970s, the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders in particular. A reporter mistakenly applied Kosar&#x27;s statement to the 1980s-era attack of Walsh&#x27;s 49ers.

Initially, Walsh resisted having the term misapplied to his own distinct system and was especially incensed by the use of the word &quot;finesse&quot; in reference to his sophisticated offensive schemes. Zimmerman notes that an article of his so misapplying the term provoked a phone call from an upset Walsh: &quot;He called me up... (saying) that wasn&#x27;t his offense&quot;. Still, the moniker stuck. Now the term is commonly used to refer to a range of pass-oriented offenses that may not be closely related to either the Air Coryell system or Walsh&#x27;s pass-strategy.

The origins of the offensive system devised by Walsh go back to Paul Brown, coach of the Cleveland Browns and later the Cincinnati Bengals. Under Brown&#x27;s tenure, Walsh was tasked with devising an offensive plan suited to Bengal quarterback Virgil Carter, who had an accurate but relatively weak arm. In response, Walsh created a system based on short, high-percentage passes, favoring straight and direct ten- to fifteen-yard strikes over forty- to fifty-yard &quot;bombs&quot; - the very opposite of the thrust of the long pass oriented later Air Coryell system. This system compensated for any weakness in the quarterback&#x27;s arm, as it allowed the ball to be thrown to short and intermediate routes where receivers with running ability could attempt to make up for any shortage in yards after catch.

Walsh&#x27;s system immediately paid off, as Virgil Carter led the league in passing percentage in 1971. Strong-armed Ken Anderson, initially a &quot;project&quot; of Walsh&#x27;s, replaced Carter as Cincinnati&#x27;s starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful in his execution of Walsh&#x27;s complicated, versatile patterns, leading the Bengals to a division title in his first year as starting quarterback. In 1975, he brought widespread recognition to the West Coast offense in a nationally televised Monday-night contest between the Bengals and the Buffalo Bills, whose offense was built around league-leading rusher O. J. Simpson. Anderson&#x27;s 447 passing yards were enough to overshadow Simpson&#x27;s 197 yards on the ground in a Bengals win that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the &quot;old&quot; ground game of defense-oriented football and the new game envisioned by Walsh—a game of higher scores, more action, and much air travel.

At the end of the 1975 season, Bengals head coach Paul Brown would retire, and he appointed Bill Johnson as his successor instead of Walsh. Ambitious and anxious to become a head coach, Walsh resigned from the Bengals and left Cincinnati for the West Coast, taking along his films of Ken Anderson running his offensive schemes to serve as a teaching aid for quarterback Dan Fouts after Walsh had been hired as an assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers. Next, after two years of success as head coach at Stanford University, Walsh received and accepted the call to be head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. He would soon transform the 49ers from a mediocre team to a perennial league powerhouse, recalling the dominance of Vince Lombardi&#x27;s Green Bay Packer teams of the 1960s, and of Chuck Noll&#x27;s Pittsburgh Steelers of the 1970s. His versatile offensive schemes, along with his high percentage passing game and emphasis on ball control, complemented the skills of Joe Montana, who implemented Walsh&#x27;s visionary system with great success as the 49ers&#x27; starting quarterback. The West Coast offense was then passed on by Walsh&#x27;s disciples, and its principles still remain in use today.

===Vertical===
Bernie Kosar used the term “West Coast offense” to describe the offense formalized by Sid Gillman with the AFL 
Chargers in the 1960s and later by Don Coryell&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals and Chargers in the 1970s and 1980s. Al Davis, an assistant under Gillman, also carried his version to the Oakland Raiders, where his successors John Rauch, John Madden, and Tom Flores continued to employ and expand upon its basic principles. This is the &quot;West Coast offense&quot; as Kosar originally used the term. It is now commonly referred to as the &quot;Air Coryell&quot; system, however, and instead the term West Coast offense is usually used to describe Walsh&#x27;s system.

The offense uses a specific naming system, with the routes for wide receivers and tight ends receiving three digit numbers, and routes for backs having unique names. For example, a pass play in 3 digit form might be &quot;Split Right 787 check swing, check V&quot;. (see Offensive Nomenclature). This provides an efficient way to communicate many different plays with minimal memorization. Conversely, the Walsh &quot;West Coast offense&quot; could in theory have more freedom, since route combinations are not limited by 0-9 digits, but at the price of much more memorization required by the players.

==Walsh&#x27;s West Coast offense==
Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of mentor Paul Brown. Bengals quarterback Virgil Carter would be the first player to successfully implement Walsh&#x27;s system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971. Ken Anderson later replaced Carter as Cincinnati&#x27;s starting QB, and was even more successful. In his 16-year career in the NFL, Anderson made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981 (and also appeared in Super Bowl XVI that year), and set what was then the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 (70.66%).

Walsh installed a modified version of this system when he became head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, serving as the team&#x27;s coach from 1979 to 1988. Walsh&#x27;s 49ers won three Super Bowls during this period, behind the passing abilities of legendary quarterback Joe Montana. Besides the 3 Super Bowl wins, Walsh won 6 NFC West division titles and compiled a 92–59–1 regular season record, with a 10–4 mark in the NFL playoffs. As a result, Walsh&#x27;s version has come to be known as the &quot;West Coast offense&quot;. Montana thrived for many years as the starting QB for the 49ers. He captured 4 Super Bowl titles (three of them under Walsh), 3 Super Bowl MVP awards, and 2 AP NFL MVP titles while in San Francisco in the 1980s. Montana and Walsh have both been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==Walsh&#x27;s coaching tree==
Several members of Bill Walsh&#x27;s coaching tree went on to successfully implement his West Coast Offense system.

George Seifert succeeded Walsh as San Francisco&#x27;s head coach in 1989, and won two Super Bowls with the 49ers; once with Joe Montana at quarterback in 1989, and later with fellow Hall of Famer Steve Young in 1994.

Paul Hackett was another former assistant coach who once served under Walsh. He served as a 49ers assistant from 1983 to 1985, coaching quarterbacks and wide receivers. During this time, Hackett helped San Francisco win Super Bowl XIX. He next served as offensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys under Tom Landry from 1986 to 1988. Hackett would later teach his version of Walsh&#x27;s offense to several coaches, including former Green Bay Packers head coach Mike McCarthy. McCarthy, who was the Packers head coach from 2006 until December 2018, would go on to win a Super Bowl himself with the use of the West Coast offense in 2010, with the help of superstar quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

Mike Holmgren is another prominent member of Bill Walsh&#x27;s coaching tree. When Holmgren first came to San Francisco as an assistant coach, he started as Walsh&#x27;s quarterbacks coach from 1986 to 1988. Holmgren then served as offensive coordinator for the 49ers under Seifert from 1989 to 1991. From 1992 to 1998, Holmgren was the head coach of the Green Bay Packers. He won a Super Bowl with the Packers in 1996 behind the quarterbacking of 3-time NFL MVP Brett Favre. He then returned to the Super Bowl in 1997, but the Packers lost to the Denver Broncos, who were coached by Mike Shanahan. Holmgren later became head coach of the Seattle Seahawks, leading them from 1999 to 2008. They played in Super Bowl XL after the 2005 season. The Seahawks, however, lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Holmgren is credited for helping mold successful quarterbacks such as Montana, Young, Favre and Matt Hasselbeck. As a head coach, he compiled an overall 174–122 record in the NFL: 161–111 in the regular season, along with a 13–11 playoff record, 3 Super Bowl appearances and 1 Super Bowl title.

One of Holmgren&#x27;s former assistants, Jon Gruden, has had reasonable success running the West Coast offense in his own right. He started his head coaching career with the Oakland Raiders, leading them from 1998 to 2001, and turned the Raiders into a strong playoff contender. Gruden then went on to become head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, winning Super Bowl XXXVII after the 2002 season. Gruden coached the Buccaneers from 2002 to 2008. After several years as a color commentator on ESPN Monday Night Football, he signed a deal to return to the Raiders as head coach for the 2018 NFL season. Gruden served as Raiders head coach from 2018 to 2021.

Another one-time member of Holmgren&#x27;s coaching staff, Andy Reid, has successfully utilized the West Coast offense during his tenure as a head coach for both the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs. From 1999 to 2012, Reid served as Eagles head coach. Since 2013, he has served as head coach of the Chiefs. Over the course of Andy Reid&#x27;s long and highly successful head coaching career, both the Eagles and Chiefs enjoyed many winning seasons under his watch. Reid coached the Eagles to 5 NFC Championship Game appearances (4 straight seasons from 2001 to 2004, and again in 2008). During his Eagles days, his teams were mostly led by QB Donovan McNabb. Then, from 2018 to 2023, Reid coached the Chiefs to 6 straight AFC Championship Game appearances. Since 2018, he has been helped by superstar QB Patrick Mahomes. Reid has appeared in the Super Bowl 5 times as a head coach: Super Bowl XXXIX with the Eagles, and Super Bowls LIV, LV, LVII and LVIII with the Chiefs. He has won all of his 3 Super Bowl titles with the Chiefs. As of the end of the 2023 NFL season, Reid has won 26 NFL playoff games, and he trails only Bill Belichick (31) for most postseason wins by an NFL head coach.

Two of Reid&#x27;s former assistants, John Harbaugh and Doug Pederson, have also succeeded in both reaching and winning a Super Bowl as head coaches. Harbaugh served as an Eagles assistant under Reid from 1999 to 2007. Since 2008, Harbaugh has enjoyed a largely successful run as head coach of the Baltimore Ravens. He guided the Ravens to victory in Super Bowl XLVII. Baltimore defeated the San Francisco 49ers, who were coached by John&#x27;s younger brother, Jim Harbaugh. Pederson first worked for the Eagles under Reid from 2009 to 2012, and then served as the Chiefs&#x27; offensive coordinator under Reid from 2013 to 2015. Pederson became head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles in 2016 and installed his own version of the West Coast offense. The following year, despite losing rising star quarterback Carson Wentz to a torn ACL, Pederson was still able to guide his team to a world championship. The Eagles, with the help of backup QB and Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles, defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII. Pederson served as head coach of the Eagles from 2016 to 2020.

Mike Shanahan is another NFL head coach who has had success running the West Coast offense. He first started his NFL coaching career with the Denver Broncos in the 1980s, coaching receivers and then serving as offensive coordinator under Dan Reeves from 1984 to 1987. It was Shanahan&#x27;s work with the Broncos offense, particularly rising star quarterback John Elway, that earned him the head coaching job of the Los Angeles Raiders for the 1988 season. His career as head coach initially got off to a rocky start, as he couldn&#x27;t co-exist with the Raiders&#x27; maverick owner Al Davis. Shanahan only compiled an 8–12 record in Los Angeles, and was fired early in the 1989 season. After again serving as an assistant for the Broncos from 1990 to 1991, he rebuilt his solid reputation working as offensive coordinator of the 49ers under George Seifert from 1992 to 1994, helping the team win Super Bowl XXIX. Shanahan then enjoyed a strong, lengthy tenure as head coach of the Broncos from 1995 to 2008. During his time as head coach, he won two Super Bowls with the Broncos in 1997 &amp; 1998, utilizing John Elway&#x27;s passing skills and leadership. Shanahan&#x27;s run-heavy variation of the offense, under the leadership of offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak, is also known for utilizing previously unheralded running backs, including 1998 NFL MVP Terrell Davis, and developing them into league-leading rushers behind small, yet powerful, Zone Blocking offensive lines. Hall of Fame players from the Broncos&#x27; Super Bowl-winning teams in &#x27;97 &amp; &#x27;98 that played on offense include Elway, Davis, and tight end Shannon Sharpe.

Shanahan also served as head coach of the Washington Redskins from 2010 to 2013, but his time in Washington was significantly less successful than his tenure with the Broncos. Despite guiding the Redskins to the NFC East division title in 2012, along with a trip to the NFL playoffs, he only compiled a 24–40 record over 4 seasons with an 0–1 playoff mark. Overall, Mike Shanahan accumulated an overall record of 178–144: 170–138 in the regular season, with an 8–6 postseason record that included 2 Super Bowl victories. He has also developed what seems to be a promising, impressive coaching tree.

Gary Kubiak has had a stellar career as an NFL head coach in his own right. After working as Shanahan&#x27;s offensive coordinator on the Broncos from 1995 to 2005, Kubiak served as the head coach of the Houston Texans from 2006 to 2013. After serving as the Baltimore Ravens&#x27; offensive coordinator in 2014, he became head coach of the Broncos in the 2015 season, and won Super Bowl 50.

Although Mike Shanahan&#x27;s tenure as Washington Redskins head coach wasn&#x27;t completely successful, his tenure did produce 3 rising star head coaches: Matt LaFleur, Sean McVay, and his son, Kyle Shanahan. Kyle Shanahan has been the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers since 2017. Despite often leading teams plagued by injuries, Shanahan has molded the 49ers into a physical, hard-nosed team with a potent run-first version of the West Coast offense. Matt LaFleur has been the head coach of the Green Bay Packers since 2019. LaFleur has led the Packers to 3 straight NFC North division titles, thanks to the passing skills of Aaron Rodgers. Sean McVay has served as the head coach of the Los Angeles Rams since 2017, and has already built a strong track record as a winning coach, guiding Los Angeles to 2 Super Bowl appearances. His Rams lost Super Bowl LIII to the New England Patriots. However, McVay won Super Bowl LVI, when the Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals. It was the team&#x27;s first Super Bowl title since returning to Los Angeles from St. Louis.

==Similar college offenses==
LaVell Edwards and Dewey Warren created an offensive system similar to the West Coast offense at Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1973.

One reason for the success of this version of the offense was in its simplicity. Norm Chow said the offenses had around 12 basic pass plays and 5 basic run plays that were run from a variety of formations, with only some plays tagged for extra versatility, so that the players knew the offense by the second day of practice.

The highpoint of the BYU offense was an NCAA Division I-A national football championship in 1984 and a Heisman Trophy for Ty Detmer in 1990. BYU broke over 100 NCAA records for passing and total offense during Edwards&#x27; tenure. Several coaches and players associated with BYU&#x27;s football program had success with this offense at BYU and elsewhere, including Virgil Carter, Mike Holmgren, Andy Reid, Brian Billick, Ted Tollner, Doug Scovil, Norm Chow, Jim McMahon, Steve Young, Ty Detmer, and Steve Sarkisian.

The University of Washington Huskies were among the first of the Pac-10 teams and in 1970, under coach Jim Owens and quarterback Sonny Sixkiller, used a variation of what would later come to be known as the West Coast offense with great success. Years later in 2002, under coach Keith Gilbertson and quarterback Cody Pickett, the Huskies ran a variation of Walsh&#x27;s West Coast offense to a conference championship and a top four passing attack averaging 352.4 yards per game. Today, the West Coast offense no longer only resides on the west coast, but can be found in schools across the nation, including Boise State, and Vanderbilt. Former Pittsburgh and Stanford head coach Walt Harris also used a variation of the West Coast offense during his stint at Pittsburgh.

==Theory==
The popular term &quot;West Coast Offense&quot; is more of a philosophy and an approach to the game than it is a set of plays or formations. Traditional offensive thinking argues that a team must establish its running game first, which will draw the defense in and open up vertical passing lanes downfield; &quot;i.e.&quot;, passing lanes that run perpendicular to the line of scrimmage.

Bill Walsh&#x27;s West Coast Offense differs from traditional offense by emphasizing a short, horizontal passing attack to help stretch out the defense, thus opening up options for longer running plays and longer passes that can achieve greater gains. The West Coast Offense as implemented under Walsh features precisely run pass patterns by the receivers that make up about 65% to 80% of the offensive scheme. With the defense stretched out, the offense is then free to focus the remaining plays on longer throws of more than 14 yards and mid to long yard rushes.

===Desired outcome===
Walsh&#x27;s West Coast Offense attempts to open up running and passing lanes for the backs and receivers to exploit, by causing the defense to concentrate on short passes.

Since most down and distance situations can be attacked with a pass or a run, the intent is to make offensive play calling unpredictable and thus keep the defense&#x27;s play &quot;honest&quot;, forcing defenders to be prepared for a multitude of possible offensive plays rather than focusing aggressively on one likely play from the offense.

Beyond the basic principle of passing to set up the run, there are few rules that govern Walsh&#x27;s West Coast Offense. Originally the offense used two split backs, giving it an uneven alignment in which five players aligned to one side of the ball and four players aligned on the other side (with the quarterback and center directly behind the ball). This imbalance forced defenses to abandon their own favored, conventional formations. Although Walsh-influenced teams now commonly use formations with more or fewer than two backs, the offense&#x27;s unevenness is still reflected in its pass protection philosophy and continues to distinguish it from single back passing offenses. Throughout the years, coaches have added to, adjusted, modified, simplified, and enhanced Bill Walsh&#x27;s original adaptation of the Paul Brown offense. Formations and plays vary greatly, as does play calling.

Another key part of the Walsh implementation was &quot;pass first, run later&quot;, It was Walsh&#x27;s intention to gain an early lead by passing the ball, then run the ball on a tired defense late in the game, wearing them down further and running down the clock. The San Francisco 49ers, under both Bill Walsh and George Seifert, often executed this strategy very effectively.

Another key element in Walsh&#x27;s attack was the three step dropback instead of traditional seven step drops or shotgun formations. The three step drop helped the quarterback get the ball out faster resulting in far fewer sacks. &quot;WCO&quot; plays unfold quicker than in traditional offenses and are usually based on timing routes by the receivers. In this offense the receivers also have reads and change their routes based on the coverages presented to them. The quarterback makes three reads and if no opportunity is available after three reads, the QB will then check off to a back or tight end. Five step and even 7 step dropbacks are now implemented in modern-day WCO&#x27;s because defensive speed has increased since the 80&#x27;s. Some modern WCO&#x27;s have even used shotgun formations (e.g. Green Bay &#x27;06-present, Atlanta &#x27;04-&#x27;06, Philadelphia &#x27;04-present).

===Typical plays===
The majority of West Coast routes occur within 15 yards of the line of scrimmage. 3-step and 5-step drops by the quarterback take the place of the run and force the opposing defense to commit their focus solely on those intermediate routes. Contrary to popular belief, the offense also uses the 7-step drop for shallow crosses, deep ins and comebacks. For instance, past Michigan Wolverines offenses utilized the 5- and 7-step drops about 85% of the time with West Coast pass schemes implemented by then-quarterbacks coach Scot Loeffler. Because of the speed of modern defenses, only utilizing the 3- and 5-step pass game would be ineffective since the defense could squat and break hard on short-to-intermediate throws with no fear of a down field pass.

The original West Coast Offense of Sid Gillman uses some of the same principles (pass to establish the run, quarterback throws to timed spots), but offensive formations are generally less complicated with more wideouts and motion. The timed spots are often farther down field than in the Walsh-style offense, and the system requires a greater reliance on traditional pocket passing.

Another aspect that makes the West Coast one of the most difficult to master is that it requires a deeper connection between quarterback and receiver, and an ability to communicate mid-play. On any given route, a receiver has as many as three options; a hitch, a slant and a fly, depending on what the defense is showing. The quarterback is responsible for recognizing the defense and the reaction of the receiver to it and adjusting the route if needed. This explains the communication mistakes that commonly occur on West Coast offensive plays where the quarterback throws to a spot that the receiver is running away from.

===Scripted plays===
A Walsh innovation was scripting the first 15 offensive plays of the game. Walsh went as far as to script the first 25 plays but most teams stop at 15. Since the offensive team knew that the first 15 plays would be run as scripted no matter what, they could practice those plays to perfection, minimizing mistakes and penalties. By ignoring situational play-calling and increasing the game tempo, scripted plays also served to confuse the defense and induce early penalties. Executing these plays successfully could establish momentum and dictate the flow of the game. It also gave the coaching staff an opportunity to run test plays against the defense to gauge their reactions in game situations. Later in the game, an observed tendency in a certain situation by the opposing defense could be exploited.

==Requirements and disadvantages==
The West Coast offense requires a quarterback who throws extremely accurately, and often blindly, very close to opposing players. In addition, it requires the quarterback to be able to quickly pick the best one of five receivers to throw to, certainly much more quickly than in previously used systems. Often, the quarterback has no time to think about the play and must act reflexively, executing the play exactly as instructed by the offensive coordinator, who calls the plays for him.

This is in contrast to the roles quarterbacks were required to perform in other systems, which were to be an adept game manager with a strong arm. Many people reasoned that Johnny Unitas, a strong-armed field general would not have fared well in being subservient to the offensive coordinator, and that his long but sometimes wobbly passes would not have worked in the West Coast system. The West Coast offense caused a split still evident today among quarterbacks; those who were more adept at the West Coast style: Joe Montana, Steve Young, Brett Favre, Tom Brady, and Matt Hasselbeck; and those more in tune with the old style: Dan Marino, Jim Kelly, and Peyton Manning. Rich Gannon is a good example of a quarterback who fared better in one system than the other. Gannon struggled in the old style system but found great success with the Oakland Raiders and the West Coast system run by head coaches Jon Gruden and Bill Callahan.

The West Coast offense requires sure-handed receivers who are comfortable catching in heavy traffic, and the system downplays speedy, larger receivers who are covered easily in short yardage situation. One result has been the longevity of receivers in the West Coast system such as Jerry Rice, because familiarity with the system and clear signalling is of greater importance than systems that require a receiver to &quot;stretch the field&quot; where any loss of speed is a major liability. &quot;WCO&quot; systems also rely on agile running backs that catch the ball as often as they run. Roger Craig was a leading receiver for the 49ers for many years and was a 1,000 yard rusher and 1,000 yard receiver in the 1985 season. Finally, receivers must follow precise, complicated routes as opposed to improvisation, making meticulous, intelligent players more valued than independent, pure athletes. Jerry Rice&#x27;s unique skill-set made him a reliable and durable asset in both Walsh&#x27;s and Seifert&#x27;s versions of the West Coast Offense, and he was able to break numerous NFL receiving records over the course of his career. Rice, who earned induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010, recorded 1,549 receptions, 22,895 receiving yards, and 208 total touchdowns, more than any other NFL player in all three categories.

Another aspect of the West Coast offense is the use of fast running quarterbacks. In blitz or short-yardage situations, many of the West Coast offense&#x27;s strengths are negated by defenses blocking running and passing lanes. A running quarterback can compensate by acting as a runner himself, paralyzing an overly aggressive defense. Quarterbacks such as Randall Cunningham and Michael Vick have been successful runners in this offense, as well as other notable scrambling quarterbacks such as Jake Plummer, Donovan McNabb, Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson and Tyrod Taylor. The west coast offense also utilizes play-action passes to fool the defense in order to get receivers open, which is usually successful with running quarterbacks.

Although not related to the West Coast offense, the similar &quot;dink-and-dunk&quot; offense has also helped quarterbacks that are more adept to older systems. Kurt Warner (a disciple of a variation of Air Coryell) and Ben Roethlisberger (a traditional gunslinger) are notable examples of non-West Coast quarterbacks that found a degree of late-career success in the &quot;dink-and-dunk&quot; system.

<text>The Central Provinces and Berar was a province of British India and later the Dominion of India which existed from 1903 to 1950. It was formed by the merger of the Central Provinces with the province of Berar, which was territory leased by the British from the Hyderabad State. Through an agreement signed on 5 November 1902, 6th Nizam Mahbub Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VI leased Berar permanently to the British for an annual payment of 25 lakhs rupees. Lord Curzon decided to merge Berar with the Central Provinces, and this was proclaimed on 17 September 1903.

The Central Provinces was formed in 1861 by the merger of the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories and Nagpur Province. Administration of the Berar region of the Hyderabad princely state was assigned to the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces in 1903, and for administrative purposes, Berar was merged with the Central Provinces to form the Central Provinces and Berar on 24 October 1936. After Indian Independence in 1947, a number of princely states were merged into the Central Provinces and Berar, which, when the Constitution of India went into effect in 1950, became the new Indian state of Madhya Bharat, merged with Madhya Pradesh in 1956, also meaning &quot;Central Province.&quot;

As its name suggests, the province was situated in the center of the Indian peninsula. It comprised large portions of the broad belt of hill and plateau which interposes between the plains of the Ganges and the Deccan Plateau. The Central Provinces and Berar were bounded on the north and northeast by the Central India Agency, including the Bundelkhand and Bagelkhand agencies, and along the northern edge of Saugor District by the United Provinces; on the west by the princely states of Bhopal, Gwalior &amp; Indore and by the Khandesh District of Bombay Presidency; on the south by Hyderabad State, and on the east by Orissa (till 1936, a part of Bihar and Orissa Province) and the Eastern States Agency.

== History ==

=== British India ===
The Central Provinces comprised 19th-century British conquests from the Mughals and Marathas in central India, and covered much of present-day Chhattisgarh with portions of Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra states. Its capital was Nagpur.

After the defeat of the Marathas in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the territories north of the Satpura Range ceded in 1817 by the Maratha Peshwa (parts of Saugor and Damoh) and in 1818 by Appa Sahib, were in 1820, formed into the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories under an agent to the governor-general. In 1835 the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories were included in the newly formed North-Western Provinces (which later became the United Provinces of Agra &amp; Oudh). In 1842, in consequence of an uprising, they were again placed under the jurisdiction of an agent to the governor-general. They were restored to the North-Western Province in 1853.

In 1818, the Maratha Bhonsle Maharajas of Nagpur submitted to British sovereignty. In 1853, on the death of Raghoji III without heirs, Nagpur was annexed by the British under the doctrine of lapse. Until the formation of the Central Provinces in 1861, Nagpur Province, which consisted of the Nagpur Division, Chhindwara and Chhattisgarh, was administered by a commissioner under the central colonial government. 

The Saugor and Nerbudda Territories were joined with the Nagpur province to constitute the new Central Provinces in 1861. on 1 October 1903 Berar was placed under the administration of the commissioner of the Central Provinces. In October 1905, most of Sambalpur and the princely states of Bamra, Rairakhol, Sonpur, Patna, and Kalahandi were transferred from the Central Provinces and Berar to Bengal, while the Hindi-speaking Chota Nagpur States of Chang Bhakar, British Korea, Surguja, Udaipur, and Jashpur were transferred from Bengal to the Central Provinces &amp; Berar.

In 1903, the Marathi-speaking Berar region of the Hyderabad princely state was placed under the administration of the Governor of the Central Provinces, although it officially remained part of Hyderabad, leased in perpetuity by the Government of India. In 1905, most of Sambalpur district and the princely states of Bamra, Rairakhol, Sonpur, Patna, and Kalahandi were transferred to Bengal Province and the princely states of Changbhakar, Korea, Surguja, Udaipur, and Jashpur were transferred from Bengal to the Central Provinces.

The Government of India Act 1912 permitted the creation of legislative councils for provinces under a chief commissioner, and on 8 November 1913, the Central Provinces Legislative Council was formed. The Government of India Act 1919 changed the administrator of the province from a chief commissioner to a governor, and enlarged the legislative council and expanded the voting franchise.

The first elections for the Legislative Council under the 1919 Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms were in November and December 1920. The Council consisted of 71 members - 53 elected members, 2 ex-officio members (members of Executive Council), and 16 official and non-official nominated members (Zamindar owners declared as backward, Depressed Classes, Europeans and Anglo-Indians). Out of the 53 elected members, 40 came from general constituencies (30 rural and 10 urban), 7 communal constituencies and 6 special constituencies (Central Provinces &amp; Berar Mining Association, Central Provinces &amp; Berar Commerce &amp; Industry Association, Berar Commerce &amp; Industry, and Central Provinces &amp; Berar Landholders). The Indian National Congress had decided at its Calcutta Conference to boycott the elections as part of the Non-cooperation Movement, and many prominent nationalist leaders, including Ravishankar Shukla, E. Raghavendra Rao, B. S. Moonje, Daulat Singh, Makhan Lal Chaturvedi, and Vishnudutta Shukla, either decided not to run, or withdrew their candidacies. The legislative seats went mostly to Liberals and Loyalists. Gangadhar Rao Chitnavis was nominated as the President of the Council.

The Montagu-Chelmsford reforms also introduced the principle of dyarchy, whereby certain responsibilities such as agriculture, health, education, and local government, were transferred to elected ministers but some responsibilities such as home, finance and revenue were reserved with the Members of the Executive Council of the Governor. Some of the Indians who served as members of the Governor&#x27;s Executive Council were Moropant Vishvanath Joshi (Home) and E. Raghavendra Rao.

By 1923, the nationalists had decided to participate in the legislative elections, and in the November and December 1923 election, and the Swaraj Party, which advocated Indian independence, won 41 of the 54 elected seats. 4 seats went to independents who generally allied with the Swarajists, four to the Liberals, and five to independents allied with the Liberals. The Swarajists were led by B. S. Moonje from Vidarbha, E. Raghavendra Rao from Mahakoshal, and S. B. Tambe and B. G. Khaparde of Berar. S. M. Chitnavis was leader of the Liberals. Despite winning a majority of seats, the Swarajists, consistent with the party&#x27;s policy of obstruction and non-acceptance of office, refused to form a government, and Governor Frank Sly selected Chitnavis and Syed Hifazat Ali, a Muslim independent, as ministers.

In the 1926 election, the Swarajists split, with one faction continuing with the policies of obstruction and non-acceptance of office, while the Responsive Cooperation Party which chose to participate in government. After the election B. S. Moonje formed a ministry by uniting Responsive Cooperation, Independent Congress, Liberal, and independent legislators into a National Party, with 33 members.

The ministry collapsed in 1933 due to infighting among the ministers and a new ministry was formed under Raghavendra Rao with Muhammad Yusuf Shareef and V. B. Choubal as ministers. This ministry collapsed in 1934 and a new ministry was formed with B. G. Khaparde as Chief Minister and K. S. Naidu as the other minister. This ministry remained in office till 1937.

In 1933, the princely states in Chhattisgarh Division were transferred to the Eastern States Agency, and Makrai to the Central India Agency. On 24 October 1936, the Central Provinces became the Central Provinces and Berar when it was fully merged with Berar Division, although it remained under the nominal sovereignty of Hyderabad.

In 1935, the Government of India Act was passed by the British Parliament. This act provided for the election of a provincial assembly, with an electorate made up of men with a minimum of financial resources, and excluding women and the poor. Supervisory powers over the enclaved and attached Princely States were reserved to the Governor and removed from the authority of the popular provincial governments. Elections were held in 1937, and the Indian National Congress took a majority of the seats but declined to form the government. A minority provisional government was formed under E. Raghavendra Rao.

The Congress reversed its decision and resolved to accept office in July 1937. Therefore, the Governor invited N. B. Khare to form the government in August 1937.

Khare resigned in 1938, and Ravi Shankar Shukla next became Premier. In 1939, along with Congress leaders from other provinces, Shukla resigned in protest of the Governor-General&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany without consulting with Indian leaders, and the Central Provinces &amp; Berar came under Governor&#x27;s Rule. Another round of elections were held in 1946, yielding another Congress majority, and Shukla again became Premier.

=== After Indian independence ===
India became independent on 15 August and the Central Provinces &amp; Berar became a province of the Dominion of India. The princely states, which were under the Central Provinces before 1936, were merged into the province, and organized into new districts. When the Constitution of India went into effect in 1950, the Central Provinces &amp; Berar was reorganized with territorial changes as the state of Madhya Pradesh, which name also means &quot;Central Province.&quot;

On 1 November 1956, Madhya Bharat, together with the states of Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal State, was merged into Madhya Pradesh. In 1956, strong demand due to linguistic similarity from Marathi Irredentists, the Berar and Nagpur divisions were transferred to Bombay State. In 1960, the Bombay State was partitioned into Maharashtra &amp; Gujarat. In 2000, the eastern portion of Madhya Pradesh was split off to become the new state of Chhattisgarh.

<text>Vidarbha (Pronunciation: ) is a geographical region in the west Indian state of Maharashtra. Forming the eastern part of the state, it comprises Amravati and Nagpur divisions. As per the 2011 Census, the region had a population of 23,003,179. The region occupies 31.6% of the total area and is home to 21.3% of the total population of Maharashtra. Situated in central India, it borders the state of Madhya Pradesh to the north, Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to the south and Marathwada and Uttar Maharashtra regions of Maharashtra to the west. 

According to the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Rukmini, the wife of lord Krishna, was born to Bhishmaka, the king of the Vidarbha kingdom. Vidarbha was part of the Satavahana Empire during 1st to 2nd century CE). The coins and inscriptions from the period of Paramara king Jagadeva, the son of the Udayaditya (reigned c. 1060–1086) have been found in the northern parts the region. According to the &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot;, the region was part of Berar Subah, in the Medieval period. In 1680, the region was captured by Sambhaji, the son of Shivaji, who was the founder of Maratha empire. In 1724, Asaf Jah, who later became the Nizam of Hyderabad, declared independence and brought most of the region under his nominal rule. The administration and right of collecting taxes were held by the Marathas. In 1803, following the defeat of the Marathas, the region came under the rule of British East India Company. Later, the British Empire took control of the region from the British East India Company in 1857, and the region was part of Berar and Central Provinces. After Indian Independence in 1947, the region was part of the Bombay State. After the Re-organization of Indian states, majority of the region became part of Maharashtra in 1960. 

The GDP of the region is estimated to be 2022-23. The economy of the region is largely dependent on agriculture with oranges and cotton being the major crops. The region also holds considerable mineral resources and forest cover. The region is economically under developed compared to the rest of Maharashtra with considerable poverty and malnutrition. Agriculture is largely dependent on seasonal monsoons and the region receives very less rainfall due to its location in the rain shadow region of the Western Ghats. Droughts and famines are common with more than 1.4 lakh farmer suicides in the period 1997 to 2006.

The largest and major city in the region is Nagpur and other major towns include Amravati, Akola, Chandrapur and Gondia. Varhadi and Zadi dialects of Marathi is widely spoken. There have been demands for a separate state of Vidarbha, due to perceived neglect from the Government of Maharashtra. While the demand is supported by major political parties BJP and Congress, it is opposed by Shiv Sena, one of the major regional political parties in the state.

== History ==
According to the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and other &quot;Puranic&quot; scriptures, princess Rukmini considered to be an incarnation of the goddess Lakshmi and the wife of lord Krishna, was born to Bhishmaka, the king of the Vidarbha kingdom. Vidarbha was part of the Satavahana Empire during 1st to 2nd century CE), ascertained by the Satavahana coins found in Pauni.

The coins and inscriptions from the period of Paramara king Jagadeva have been found in the northern parts the region. An inscription discovered at Jainad names Jagadeva as the son of the Paramara king Udayaditya (reigned c. 1060–1086). Scholar M. H. Krishna argued that the Chalukya king Someshvara was known by the title &quot;Jagadeva&quot; (&quot;Lord of the world&quot;) in the northern part of his kingdom, and it was he who issued these coins. However, all the known Chalukya coins featured Kannada script, while the coins of Jagadeva featured the Nagari script used by the Paramaras.

According to the &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot;, the region was part of Berar Subah, known as the Gulshan-e-Berar in the Medieval period. In 1680, the region was captured by Sambhaji, the son of Shivaji who was the founder of Maratha empire. In 1724, following a battle at Buldana, Asaf Jah defeated the Mughal governor and declared independence. Most of the region came under the nominal rule of Jah, who later became the Nizam of Hyderabad, though the administration and right of collecting chauth were held by the Marathas. In 1803, following the defeat of the Marathas, the region came under the rule of British East India Company.

Later, the British Empire took control of the region from the British East India Company in 1857. After Indian Independence in 1947, the region was part of the Bombay State. After the States Reorganisation Act, which re-organized state boundaries, majority of the region became part of Maharashtra.

The Vidarbha movement started in the 1930s demanding a separate state of Vidarbha. The demand has been raised at times due to perceived neglect of the region by the Government of Maharashtra. While the demand is supported by major political parties BJP and Congress, it is opposed by Shiv Sena, one of the major regional political parties in the state. Political economist Shrikant Jichkar opposed the separation of the region from Maharashtra, stating that it was not sustainable. He noted that income from available natural resources would not be able to balance the subsidies given by the government, whose cooperation would be vital to any development and that the division introduces societal risks due to dividing of the Marathi-speaking state.

<text>Mothers (formerly the Carlton Ballroom) was a club in the Erdington district of Birmingham, England, during the late 1960s and early 1970s. It opened above an old furniture store in Erdington High Street on 9 August 1968. The club, run by John Singer, John &#x27;Spud&#x27; Taylor and promoter Phil Myatt, closed its doors on 3 January 1971. Between those dates more than 400 acts performed there, many of whom went on to great success.

Well-known live recordings made in Mothers include those released by Pink Floyd on &quot;Ummagumma&quot;, recorded on 27 April 1969, and parts of &quot;Facelift&quot; by Soft Machine, released on &quot;Third&quot;, recorded on 11 January 1970.

Rory Gallagher&#x27;s band Taste played regularly, The Who performed their rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot; there. Traffic&#x27;s debut took place at the club, and fledgling heavy metal bands like Deep Purple, Judas Priest (whose vocalist Rob Halford mentions Mothers in a song on his 2000 solo album &quot;Resurrection&quot;) and Black Sabbath played some of their earliest gigs there.

Some of the other well-known rock bands and artists to play Mothers include: Family, Fleetwood Mac, John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers, Eclection, Edgar Broughton Band, Free, Roy Harper, Blodwyn Pig, Strawbs, Quintessence, Steppenwolf, the Deviants, Jethro Tull, Jon Hiseman&#x27;s Colosseum, Skid Row (with Gary Moore), the Nice, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Elton John, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin, The Chicago Transit Authority, Moby Grape, Canned Heat (there is a reference to the club in the sleeve notes of their 1969 compilation &quot;Canned Heat Cookbook&quot;), Grateful Dead, Moody Blues and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band.

While returning home to London from a performance at Mothers on 12 May 1969, Fairport Convention&#x27;s van crashed on the M1 motorway, killing drummer Martin Lamble, 19, and Jeannie Franklyn, guitarist Richard Thompson&#x27;s girlfriend. The rest of the band suffered injuries of varying severity.

Mothers was voted the number one rock venue in the world by America&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. John Peel, a regular DJ at the club, was quoted as saying: &quot;People are amazed to hear that for a few years the best club in Britain was in Erdington.&quot;

Roy Harper later told &quot;Brum Beat&quot; magazine:

A blue plaque was unveiled at the former Mothers building on 13 July 2013.

<doc id="638756" wikidata="Q2241726" url="?curid=638756" title="Ima (BT album)">
<text>Ima (; stylized as 今 ima; Japanese for &quot;now&quot;) is the debut studio album by American electronic musician BT, released on October 9, 1995, through Perfecto Records. The album is considered a major stepping stone in trance music, popularizing a more progressive approach. The album includes the 1995 single &quot;Embracing the Future&quot;, which reached number one on the UK Dance Chart, as well as &quot;Loving You More&quot; featuring Vincent Covello. Following its release, &quot;Ima&quot; appeared on the UK Albums Chart for four weeks, peaking at 45. In 1996, the album was released in the United States in a double disc format, with the US Dance number one single &quot;Blue Skies&quot; featuring Tori Amos.

==Background==
Brian Transeau (BT) released his debut single, &quot;Embracing the Future&quot; in 1993 through MusicNow Records in the United States, where it failed to chart. However, Welsh DJ Sasha performed the song in the United Kingdom where it saw success, and he paid for Transeau to relocate to the country. Transeau brought an IBM Personal System/2 computer from the US, which the album was recorded on.

==Composition==

In an interview with &quot;Musik Magazine&quot;, Transeau spoke about the composition of the album. He cited that &quot;Nocturnal Transmission&quot; and &quot;Quark&quot; were inspired by nature, after he was taken hiking by British DJ Guy Oldhams in Cumbria, North England. On the topic of the album&#x27;s composition, Transeau stated: 

The album&#x27;s fourth track, &quot;Sasha&#x27;s Voyage of &quot;Ima&quot;&quot;, is a DJ mix by Sasha, comprising the three former tracks in addition to mixes of &quot;Embracing the Future&quot;, &quot;Loving You More&quot; and &quot;Deeper Sunshine&quot;. Explaining the inclusion of the mix on the album, Transeau stated that &quot;I wanted some tracks to stand out for themselves, but I also wanted Sasha to show how he interprets songs. He makes every individual record more than just the sum of its parts&quot;.

&quot;Loving You More&quot; was composed as a challenge for Transeau to create a vocal track; of which the vocals were provided by Vincent Covello. The final track, &quot;Divinity&quot;, was composed after Transeau recorded himself overtone singing.

==Release==
&quot;Ima&quot; was released on October 9, 1995, through Perfecto Records in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it was released in 1996 in a double disc format, featuring the single &quot;Blue Skies&quot;, featuring Tori Amos, as well as its remix, &quot;Blue Skies (The Delphinium Days Mix)&quot;. &quot;Blue Skies&quot; was previously featured in edited form on the soundtrack for the TV show &quot;Party of Five&quot;. This version also includes several singles released prior to the album, as well as the B-sides to &quot;Embracing the Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Nocturnal Transmission&quot;. A portion of &quot;Nocturnal Transmission&quot; is featured in the film &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;, for which BT also composed the score.

The cover art is a photograph of &quot;Christ of the Abyss&quot;, a submerged bronze statue of Jesus Christ in the Mediterranean Sea.

<doc id="638764" wikidata="Q232619" url="?curid=638764" title="Hooded pitohui">
<text>The hooded pitohui (Pitohui dichrous) is a species of bird in the genus &quot;Pitohui&quot; found in New Guinea. It was long thought to be a whistler (Pachycephalidae) but is now known to be in the Old World oriole family (Oriolidae). Within the oriole family, this species is most closely related to the variable pitohuis in the genus &quot;Pitohui&quot;, and then the figbirds.

A medium-sized songbird with reddish-brown and black plumage, this species is one of the few known poisonous birds, containing a range of batrachotoxin compounds in its skin, feathers and other tissues. These toxins are thought to be derived from their diet and may function both to deter predators and to protect the bird from parasites. The close resemblance of this species to other unrelated birds also known as pitohuis which are also poisonous is an example of convergent evolution and Müllerian mimicry. Their appearance is also mimicked by unrelated non-poisonous species, a phenomenon known as Batesian mimicry. The toxic nature of this bird is well known to local hunters, who avoid it. It is one of the most poisonous species of pitohui, but the toxicity of individual birds can vary geographically.

The hooded pitohui is found in forests from sea level up to but is most common in hills and low mountains. A social bird, it lives in family groups and frequently joins and even leads mixed-species foraging flocks. Its diet is made up of fruits, seeds and invertebrates. This species is apparently a cooperative breeder, with family groups helping to protect the nest and feed the young. The hooded pitohui is common and is currently not at risk of extinction, with its numbers being stable.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The hooded pitohui (&quot;Pitohui dichrous&quot;) was described by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850. Bonaparte placed it in the genus &quot;Rectes&quot; which had been erected in the same year by Ludwig Reichenbach as an alternative name for the genus &quot;Pitohui&quot;, which had been described by René Lesson in 1831. No explanation was given for the preference of the newer name over the established older one, but it was common to prefer Latin names over non-Latin names, and to provide Latin names to those without. Richard Bowdler Sharpe encapsulated that attitude when he wrote in 1903 &quot;&quot;Pitohui&quot; is doubtless an older name than &quot;Rectes&quot;, but can surely be laid aside as a barbarous word&quot;. Eventually however the principle of priority, which favours the first formal name given to a taxon, was applied, and &quot;Rectes&quot; was suppressed as the junior synonym of &quot;Pitohui&quot;.

The hooded pitohui was placed in the genus &quot;Pitohui&quot; with five other species, and the genus was thought to reside within the Australasian whistler family (Pachycephalidae). A 2008 examination of the genus, however, found it to be polyphyletic (meaning that the genus contained unrelated species), with some purported members of the genus not actually falling within the whistlers. The hooded pitohui and the closely related variable pitohui were both found to be related to the Old World orioles (Oriolidae). A 2010 study by the same team confirmed that the hooded pitohui and variable pitohui were orioles and indeed were sister species, and that together with the figbirds they formed a well defined basal clade within the family. As the variable pitohui was the type species for the genus &quot;Pitohui&quot;, the hooded pitohui was retained in that genus and the four remaining species were moved to other genera.

The hooded pitohui is monotypic, lacking any subspecies. Birds in the south east of New Guinea are sometimes separated into a proposed subspecies, &quot;P. d. monticola&quot;, but the differences are very slight and the supposed subspecies are generally regarded as inseparable.

Pitohui, the common name for the group and the genus name, is a Papuan term for &quot;rubbish bird&quot;, a reference to its inedibility. The specific name &quot;dichrous&quot; is from the Ancient Greek word , meaning . Alternate names for the hooded pitohui include the black-headed pitohui and lesser pitohui.

==Physiology and description==

The hooded pitohui is long and weighs . The adult has a black , head, chin, throat and upper breast and a black tail. The rest of the plumage is a reddish brown. The bill and legs are black, and the irises are either reddish brown, dark brown or black. Both sexes look alike. Juvenile birds look like adults, except that the of the tail and of the wing are tinged with brown.

===Toxicity===

In 1990 scientists preparing the skins of the hooded pitohui for museum collections experienced numbness and burning when handling them. It was reported in 1992 that this species and some other pitohuis contained a neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of batrachotoxin, in their tissues. This made them the first documented poisonous birds, other than some reports of coturnism caused by consuming quail (although toxicity in quails is unusual), and the first bird discovered with toxins in the skin. The same toxin had previously been found only in Central and South American poison dart frogs from the genera &quot;Dendrobates&quot;, &quot;Oophaga&quot; and &quot;Phyllobates&quot; (family Dendrobatidae). The batrachotoxin family of compounds are among the most toxic compounds by weight in nature, being 250 times more toxic than strychnine. Later research found that the hooded pitohui had other batrachotoxins in its skin, including batrachotoxinin-A &quot;cis&quot;-crotonate, batrachotoxinin-A and batrachotoxinin-A 3′-hydroxypentanoate. 

Bioassays of their tissue found that the skins and feathers were the most toxic, the heart and liver less toxic, and the skeletal muscles the least toxic parts of the birds. Of the feathers, the toxin is most prevalent in those covering the breast and belly. Microscopy has shown that the toxins are sequestered in the skin in organelles analogous to lamellar bodies and are secreted into the feathers. The presence of the toxins in muscle, heart and liver shows that hooded pitohuis have a form of insensitivity to batrachotoxins. A bird has been estimated to have up to 20 μg of toxins in its skin and up to 3 μg in its feathers. This can vary dramatically geographically and by individual, and some have been collected with no detectable toxins.

The poisonous pitohuis, including the hooded pitohui, are not thought to create the toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from their diet. The extent of the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range and also across the range of the unrelated blue-capped ifrit, another New Guinean bird found with toxic skin and feathers. Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from the diet. The presence of the toxins in the internal organs as well as the skins and feathers rules out the possibility that the toxins are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.

One possible source has been identified in the forests of New Guinea: beetles of the genus &quot;Choresine&quot; (family Melyridae), which contain the toxin and have been found in the stomachs of hooded pitohui. An alternative explanation, that the birds and beetles both get the toxin from a third source, is considered unlikely as the blue-capped ifrit is almost exclusively insectivorous.

==Ecology==
The function of the toxins to the hooded pitohui has been the source of debate and research since its discovery. The initial suggestion was that the toxins acted as a chemical deterrent to predators. Some researchers cautioned this suggestion was premature, and others noted that the levels of batrachotoxins were three orders of magnitude lower than in the poison dart frogs that do use it in this way.

Another explanation for the purpose of the toxins is to mitigate the effects of parasites. In experimental conditions chewing lice were shown to avoid toxic feathers of hooded pitohui in favour of feathers with lower concentrations of toxin or no toxins at all. Additionally lice that did live in the toxic feathers did not live as long as control lice, suggesting that the toxins could lessen both the incidence of infestation and the severity. A comparative study of the tick loads of wild birds in New Guinea would seem to support the idea, as hooded pitohuis had considerably fewer ticks than almost all the 30 genera examined. The batrachotoxins do not seem to have an effect on internal parasites such as &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; or the malaria-causing &quot;Plasmodium&quot;.
A number of authors have noted that the two explanations, as a chemical defence against predators and as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists to suggest that the toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.

One argument in favour of the toxin acting as a defence against predators is the apparent Müllerian mimicry in some of the various unrelated pitohui species, which all have similar plumage. The species known as pitohuis were long thought congeneric, due to their similarities in plumage, but are now spread through three families, the oriole, whistlers and Australo-Papuan bellbirds. The similarity in appearance therefore presumably evolved as a shared aposematic signal to common predators of their distasteful nature. This signal is reinforced by the species&#x27; strong sour odor. There is also evidence that some other birds in New Guinea have evolved Batesian mimicry, where a non-toxic species adopts the appearance of a toxic species. An example of this is the non-toxic juvenile greater melampitta, which has plumage similar to the hooded pitohui.

There have also been experiments to test pitohui batrachotoxins on potential predators. They have been shown to irritate the buccal membranes of brown tree snakes and green tree pythons, both of which are avian predators in New Guinea. The unpalatability of the species is also known to local hunters, who otherwise hunt songbirds of the same size.

The existence of resistance to batrachotoxins and the use of those toxins as chemical defences by several bird families have led to competing theories as to its evolutionary history. Jønsson (2008) suggested that it was an ancestral adaptation in Corvoidea songbirds, and that further studies would reveal more toxic birds. Dumbacher (2008) argued instead that it was an example of convergent evolution.

==Distribution and habitat==

The hooded pitohui is endemic to the islands of New Guinea. It is found widely across the main island, and also on the nearby island of Yapen. It inhabits rainforest, forest edge habitats and secondary growth, and sometimes mangrove forests. It is most commonly found in hills and low mountains, between , but is found locally down to sea-level and up to . It typically occurs at higher elevations than the lowland variable pitohui and lower than the (unrelated) black pitohui, although there is some overlap.

==Behaviour==

===Calls===

The hooded pitohui makes a variety of calls, mostly forms of whistles. Its song is a variable collection of three to seven whistles, which can slur up or down with hesitant pauses in between. Usually the song begins with two similar notes followed by an upslur. It also makes an &quot;tuk tuk w’oh tuw’uow&quot; call, two whistled &quot;woiy, woiy&quot; notes, two downslurred whistled &quot;tiuw tow&quot; notes, and three whistles &quot;hui-whui-whooee&quot;, which increase in volume.

===Diet and feeding===

The diet of the hooded pitohui is dominated by fruit, particularly figs of the genus &quot;Ficus&quot;, grass seeds, some insects and other invertebrates, and possibly small vertebrates. Among the invertebrates found in their diet are beetles, spiders, earwigs, bugs (Hemiptera, including the families Membracidae and Lygaeidae), flies (Diptera), caterpillars and ants. They feed at all levels of the forest, from the forest floor to the canopy, and are reported to do so in small groups, presumably of related birds. The species also regularly joins mixed-species foraging flocks, and on Yapen and between above sea-level it will often act as the flock leader. This leadership role, and indeed their participation in mixed flocks, is not true across all of their range however.

===Breeding===

Little is known about the breeding biology of the hooded pitohui and its relatives due to the difficulties of studying the species high in the canopy of New Guinea. Nests with eggs of the hooded pitohui have been found from October through to February. The nest that has been described was off the ground. The nest is a cup of vine tendrils, lined with finer vines and suspended on thin branches.

The clutch is one to two eggs, , which are creamy or pinkish with brown to black spots and blotches and faint grey patches; in one egg all the markings with at the larger end. The incubation period is not known, but the species is thought to be a cooperative breeder, as more than two birds in a group have been observed defending the nest from intruders and feeding the young. Young birds, which are covered in white down as nestlings before developing their adult plumage, have been observed being fed acorn-shaped red berries and insects. Young birds will make a threat display when approached in the nest, rising up and erecting their head feathers. As chicks develop directly into adult plumage, it has been suggested that this display may be signalling its identity as a toxic species, even though young birds have not developed toxicity at that age.

==Relationship with humans==

The toxic and unpalatable nature of the hooded pitohui has long been known to local people in New Guinea, and this knowledge has been recorded by Western scientists as far back as 1895. In spite of this, and reports of toxicity in birds going back to classic antiquity, before the discovery that the hooded pitohui was toxic, toxicity was not a trait that scientists attributed to birds. The discovery of toxicity in birds, triggered by this species, sparked interest in the subject and a re-examination of older accounts of unpalatability and toxicity in birds, although the field is still understudied.

===Status and conservation===

Common and widespread throughout New Guinea, the hooded pitohui is evaluated as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In one study of the effects of small subsistence gardens, populations of hooded pitohui were lower in disturbed agricultural habitat in the lowlands, compared to undisturbed forest, but actually increased in disturbed habitat higher in the mountains.

<doc id="638766" wikidata="Q2627082" url="?curid=638766" title="Bombay State">
<text>Bombay State was a large Indian state created in 1950 from the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, with other regions being added to it in the succeeding years. Bombay State (British India, roughly equating to the present-day Indian state of Maharashtra, excluding Marathwada) and Vidarbha) was merged with the princely states of Baroda, Western India and Gujarat (the present-day Indian state of Gujarat) and the Deccan States (which included parts of the present-day Indian states of Maharashtra and Karnataka). 

On 1 November 1956, Bombay State was re-organized under the States Reorganisation Act on linguistic lines, absorbing various territories including the Saurashtra and Kutch States, which ceased to exist. On 1 May 1960, Bombay State was dissolved and split on linguistic lines into the two states of Gujarat, with Gujarati speaking population and Maharashtra, with Marathi speaking population.

==History==

During the British Raj, portions of the western coast of India under direct British rule were part of the Bombay Presidency. After Indian independence in 1947 and when India was partitioned, Bombay Presidency remained part of India, while Sind province became part of Pakistan. The territory retained by India was restructured into Bombay State when India became a republic in 1950. It included princely states such as Kolhapur in Deccan, and Baroda and the Dangs in Gujarat, which had former parts of Deccan States Agency and Baroda, Western India and Gujarat States Agency.
===Expansion of the state===
As a result of the States Reorganisation Act on 1 November 1956, the Kannada-speaking districts of Belgaum (except Chandgad taluka), Bijapur, Dharwar, and North Canara were transferred from Bombay State to Mysore State. 
but the State of Bombay was significantly enlarged, expanding eastward to incorporate the Marathi-speaking Marathwada region of Hyderabad State, the Marathi-speaking Vidarbha region of southern Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarati-speaking Saurashtra and Kutch states. The Bombay state was being referred to by the local inhabitants as &quot;Maha Dwibhashi Rajya&quot;, meaning, &quot;the great bilingual state&quot;.

In 1956, the States Reorganisation Committee, against the will of Jawaharlal Nehru, recommended a bilingual state for Maharashtra-Gujarat with Bombay as its capital, whereas in &quot;Lok Sabha&quot; discussions in 1955, the Congress party demanded that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state. In the 1957 elections, the Samyukta Maharashtra movement opposed these proposals, and insisted that Bombay be declared the capital of Maharashtra.

===Dissolution of Bombay state===
Bombay State was finally dissolved with the formation of Maharashtra and Gujarat states on 1 May 1960.

Following protests of Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, in which 107 people were killed by police, Bombay State was reorganised on linguistic lines. Gujarati-speaking areas of Bombay State were partitioned into the state of Gujarat following Mahagujarat Movement. Maharashtra State with Bombay as its capital was formed with the merger of Marathi-speaking areas of Bombay State, eight districts from Central Provinces and Berar, five districts from Hyderabad State, and numerous princely states enclosed between them.

===Chief ministers===
Bombay State had three chief ministers after the independence of India:
*Balasaheb Gangadhar Kher was the first chief minister of Bombay (1946–1952)
*Morarji Desai (1952–1956)
*Yashwantrao Chavan (1956–1960)

===Governors===

Upon the split of Bombay State in 1960, the designation of the &quot;Governor of Bombay&quot; was renamed to the Governor of Maharashtra.

<text>Hutatma Chowk (&quot;Martyrs&#x27; Square, officially, Hutatma Smarak Chowk, &quot;Martyrs Memorial Square&quot;) is a square in South Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The square hosts Flora Fountain and was known by that name until 1961 when it was officially renamed in memory of the members of Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti, who died when police fired upon their peaceful demonstration in 1956. A statue of a &quot;Martyr with a Flame&quot; stands next to Flora Fountain.

==History==
Hutatma Chowk is located in the busy financial district of Fort. It derives its present name from an incident in 1956 when a peaceful demonstration by the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti (United Maharashtra Committee) was fired upon by the police resulting in 106 deaths. The incident was part of ongoing struggles of the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti, amongst others, for the creation of the State of Maharashtra. The shooting proved to be a major impetus for the creation of Maharashtra on 1 May 1960.

The Hutatma Chowk square is lined on all sides by buildings constructed during the British Raj. An ornate fountain surrounded by delicately carved figures forms the center of the huge square. This was the Flora Fountain.

The fountain itself was built in 1864 and represents the Roman Goddess Flora, the Goddess of Abundance. Today it is a heritage structure. It cost Rs. 47,000 to build, a large sum at the time, and was constructed by the Agri-Horticultural Society of Western India. Cursetjee Fardoonjee Parekh donated Rs.20,000 towards the construction of this fountain. The fountain was carved from stone that was imported from Portland. It was built in honour of Sir Bartle Frere, who was the Governor of Bombay at the time. Sir Bartle was responsible for dismantling Bombay Fort and shaping much of modern Mumbai. Initially it was to be named after the Governor but the name was changed before the fountain was unveiled. When it was constructed it was in the middle of the city. Flora fountain stands in exactly the same place where the original Churchgate of Bombay Fort stood. The area around Flora Fountain is the business center of Mumbai and is surrounded by offices, banks, colleges and shops.

<text>Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, () commonly known as the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti, was an organisation in India that advocated for a separate Marathi-speaking state in Western India and Central India from 1956 to 1960.

The Samiti demanded the creation of a new state from Marathi-speaking areas of the State of Bombay, a Marathi state, with the city of Bombay as its capital. The Samiti achieved its goal when the state of Maharashtra was created as a Marathi linguistic state on 1 May 1960. Members continued to advocate for the inclusion of Marathi-speaking areas in northern Karnataka such as Belgaum, Karwar, and Bidar into Maharashtra, and the newly annexed state of Goa and Damaon until the 1967 Goa Opinion Poll rejected merger with Maharashtra.

==History==
The Samyukta Maharashtra Movement organisation was founded on 6 February 1956, at Tilak Smarak Mandir in Pune. The Samiti declared its Executive Council. Shripad Amrit Dange as the President. T. R.Naravane as Vice President and S. M. Joshi as General Secretary were selected. Many of the Prominent activists of Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti were leftists such as S. M. Joshi, Shripad Amrit Dange, Narayan Ganesh Gore, Nana Patil and Uddhavrao Patil. Other leaders included Annabhau Sathe, Maina Gawankar, Walchand Kothari, Pralhad Keshav Atre, Keshav Sitaram Thackeray, Pandurang Mahadev Bapat, Bhausaheb Raut, and Amar Shaikh, G. T. Madkholkar, Madhu Dandavate, Y. K. Souni. As a part of the campaign, Pralhad Keshav Atre used his Maratha newspaper to criticise Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Morarji Desai (then chief minister of Bombay state) and S.K. Patil, the Mumbai Congress party politician who favored separation of Mumbai city from a linguistically reconstituted Maharashtra or Gujarat.

The Indian National Congress had pledged to introduce linguistic states prior to Independence. However, after Independence, Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel were adamantly opposed to linguistic states. They perceived linguistic states as a threat to the integrity of India. For the first time and perhaps the only time, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its chief Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar supported Nehru and Patel against redrawing of the map along linguistic lines. The catalyst to the creation of a States Re-organization Commission was the fasting death of Telugu nationalist Potti Sriramulu. In 1956, the SRC (States Re-organisation Committee) recommended creation of linguistic states of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka but recommended a bi-lingual state for Maharashtra-Gujarat, with Bombay as its capital but Vidarbha outside Maharashtra. Further, they recommended the creation of Vidharba state to unite the Marathi-speaking people of former Hyderabad state with Marathi-speaking areas of Central Provinces and Berar state. On 21 November 1955, demonstrators were fired upon by the police at Flora Fountain in the capital city of Bombay. Flora Fountain was subsequently renamed Hutatma Chowk or &quot;Martyr&#x27;s Crossroad&quot; in their memory. It is estimated that in a total of 106 people were shot by security forces during the period of agitation and at different places. Morarji Desai, who was the then chief minister of Bombay State was later removed and replaced by Yashwantrao Chavan as a result of criticism related to the 21 November incident. Nehru&#x27;s speech dissenting with the SRC led C. D. Deshmukh, the then Finance Minister of the Nehru Cabinet to resign his post in January 1956. This led to the creation of the predecessor movement Sanyukta Maharashtra Parishad, inaugurated on 1 November 1956, causing a great political stir and, under the leadership of Keshavrao Jedhe, a whole party meeting was held in Pune and Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti was founded on 6 February 1956. In the second general election of 1957, the Samiti defeated the stalwarts of Congress by securing 101 seats out of 133, including 12 from Bombay. The Congress party could form a government only with the support of Gujarat, Marathwada and Vidharba.

The Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti achieved its goal on 1 May 1960, when the State of Bombay was partitioned into the Marathi-speaking State of Maharashtra and the Gujarati-speaking State of Gujarat. However Goa (then a Portuguese colony), Belgaum, Karwar and adjoining areas, which were also part of the Maharashtra envisaged by the Samiti, were not included in Maharashtra state. Prominent leaders of the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti decided to quit the organization after 1 May 1960, but the then chairman of the Samiti, Udhavrao Patil, continued his fight for the 862 Marathi-speaking villages of Karnataka that were excluded in 1960.

<text>A satellite city or satellite town is a smaller municipality or settlement that is part of (or on the edge of) a larger metropolitan area and serves as a regional population and employment center. It differs from mere suburbs, subdivisions and especially bedroom communities in that it has employment bases sufficient to support its residential population, and conceptually, could be a self-sufficient community outside of its larger metropolitan area. However, it functions as part of a metropolis and experiences high levels of cross-commuting (that is, residents commuting out of and employees commuting into the city).
==Satellite cities versus other types of settlement==
Satellite cities are different from and are sometimes confused with the following related patterns of development.

===Suburbs===
Satellite cities differ from suburbs in that they have distinct employment bases, commuter sheds, and cultural offerings from the central metropolis, as well as an independent municipal government. Satellite cities are not bedroom communities.

===Edge cities===
Satellite cities differ from edge cities, which are suburbs with large employment bases and cultural offerings, in that satellite cities must have a true historic downtown, a distinct independent municipal government, existed as a city prior to becoming interconnected with the larger metropolitan core, and are surrounded by a belt of rural land between themselves and the central city.

Conceptually, both satellite cities and some types of edge cities could be (and once were) self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas but have become interconnected due to the suburban expansion of the larger metropolis. However, while edge cities may have their own government and share many characteristics with satellite cities, they are much more physically integrated with the core city and would not exist in anything like their present form if not for the suburban expansion of their larger neighbor. Edge cities are activity nodes within a metro area, not miniature metro areas themselves.

Some satellite cities that are particularly close or well connected to their larger neighbors and/or have their own historic downtown may also qualify as the &quot;uptown&quot; variety of edge cities, but the terms are not synonymous.

===Multi-polar cities===
In some cases, large metropolitan areas have multiple centers of close-to-equal importance. These multi-polar cities are often referred to as twin cities. Multi-polar cities differ from satellite cities in the following ways:
*Satellite cities are clearly much less important than the larger central city around which they are located, while the various nodes of multi-polar cities are much closer to each other in importance.
*Satellite cities are often separated from the central city by a substantial belt of rural or suburban territory, while twin cities may be fully integrated in physical form.

For example, Fort Worth, Texas is a twin of Dallas, Texas because though Fort Worth is somewhat smaller, it is proportionally close enough and physically integrated enough with Dallas to be considered a twin rather than a satellite. However, Waco, Texas is a satellite town of both cities. Generally speaking, cities that are listed as being part of the same urbanized area should be considered twins, rather than one having a satellite relationship to the other.

===Metropolitan areas===
Conceptually, satellite cities are miniature metro areas on the fringe of larger ones. Satellite cities are sometimes listed as part of the larger metro area and sometimes listed as totally independent. In the United States, satellite cities are often (but not always) listed as independent Metropolitan Statistical Areas within a single Combined Statistical Area that is unified with the larger metropolis.

<doc id="638795" wikidata="Q3141642" url="?curid=638795" title="Bursatella leachii">
<text>Bursatella leachii, whose common name is the ragged sea hare or shaggy sea hare, is a species of large sea slug: a marine gastropod mollusk in the sea hare family Aplysiidae. It has an almost pantropical distribution, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, but excluding the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. Its long planktonic larval period and short life cycle make able to colonise new areas and increase dramatically in number if food supplies are favourable. 

== Taxonomy ==
After &quot;Bursatella leachii&quot; was described in 1817 by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, numerous other species were added to the genus. In 1935 Eales and Engel synonymised these all with &quot;B. leachii&quot;, proposing six subspecies; one more was added by Bebbington in 1969, at which point &quot;Bursatella&quot; was considered a monotypic genus with a nearly pantropical distribution, containing the following subspecies:
* &quot;Bursatella leachii africana&quot; (South Africa)
* &quot;Bursatella leachii guineensis&quot; (Ghana)
* &quot;Bursatella leachii laniculata&quot; (Brazil)
* &quot;Bursatella leachii leachii&quot; (Indo-Pacific)
* &quot;Bursatella leachii pleii&quot; (West Indies)
* &quot;Bursatella leachii rosea&quot; (West Africa)
* &quot;Bursatella leachii savigniana&quot; (Red Sea)
These subspecies were supposedly distinguishable by &quot;wooliness&quot;, their background colour, and the colour of their eyespots, though other observers found these traits varied within local populations and few consistent differences could be seen.

A 2020 molecular analysis by Bazzicalupo &quot;et al&quot;. found no consistent genetic differences between &quot;B. leachii&quot; subspecies, and recommended that this classification scheme be abandoned. In their view, &quot;B. leachii&quot; is a morphologically variable species with a pantropical distribution and limited gene flow between Indo-Pacific and Atlantic populations. Bazzicalupo &quot;et al&quot;. resurrected the name &quot;Bursatella ocilligera&quot; (Bergh 1902) for genetically-distinct specimens from the Philippines, and that same year Nimbs and Wilson described &quot;B. hirsuta&quot; from southern and western Australia, making three species in the genus &quot;Bursatella&quot;.

==Distribution==
This species is more widely-distributed than any almost other species of heterobranch sea slug, being found in coastal areas of the Atlantic down to South Africa and parts of the Indo-West Pacific ocean. Although it spans 20,000 km of tropical waters from the Caribbean to Japan, it is absent from the central and eastern Pacific. It has been hypothesised that the Atlantic and Indian-Pacific populations could be intermittently linked by the Agulhas Current around the tip of South Africa, explaining the small divergence in genetic sequence between the two populations.

This species colonised the Mediterranean Sea in about the mid-20th century. It was first noted in the 1950s on the Levantine coast and Italy, reaching Morocco, southern Spain, and France in the 2000s. Because it was first noted from the eastern Mediterranean, the population was assumed to have originated in the Red Sea via the Suez Canal, but genetic sequencing revealed Mediterranean and Atlantic populations had almost identical haplotypes, meaning the species probably arrived from the Atlantic. Rather than being carried in ballast water like many other species invading the Mediterranean, &quot;B. leachii&quot; probably arrived naturally as sea surface temperatures that would normally prevent it entering the Strait of Gibraltar have shifted north with climate change.

==Description==

&quot;Bursatella leachii&quot; is green to greenish brown. It has a broad and short head. Its mantle is covered with e (finger-like outgrowths), which give it a thorny aspect. The mantle has a network-like pattern with blue eyespots (ocelli) in black spots and green areas. It moves slowly on a broad foot. There is short, sharp tail. The short parapodia (fleshy, winglike outgrowths) are fused on their rear end.

The maximum recorded length is 120 mm.

==Ecology==
The species is usually found in protected marine bays and estuaries, tidal pools, occurring in the intertidal zone and down to at least 10 m. It is a benthic detritivore which grazes for food on muddy or sandy bottoms. Populations in the wild have been observed feeding on a range of macroalgae including the green alga &quot;Enteromorpha,&quot; as well as the cyanobacteria &quot;Calothrix crustacea&quot;, forming large populations in response to bacterial blooms.

This sea hare may be found in dense concentrations or singly; it follows a daily rhythm, assembling in groups at sunset and dispersing in the morning. These patterns are also followed in captivity, with copulation predominantly in the morning and feeding in the afternoon. The species lays egg ribbons in long green stringy tangles. After hatching the veliger larvae grow rapidly and reach full size at 15 days, and are able to metamorphose to adult form aged just 19 days (the shortest larval period reported for sea slugs), but can live as plankton for up to three months. Larvae metamorphose on cyanobacteria, taking 1–2 days, discarding their shell when they reach 2.5–3.0 mm long. Adults grow relatively quickly, attaining maturity at the age of 2 or 3 months after hatching.

<text>The head of navigation is the farthest point above the mouth of a river that can be navigated by ships. Determining the head of navigation can be subjective on many streams, as the point may vary greatly with the size or the draft of the ship being contemplated for navigation and the seasonal water level. On others, it is quite objective, being caused by a waterfall, a low bridge that is not a drawbridge, or a dam without navigation locks. Several rivers in a region may have their heads of navigation along a line called the fall line. 

Longer rivers such as the River Thames may have several heads of navigation depending on the size of the vessel. In the case of the Thames, that includes London Bridge, which historically served as the head of navigation for tall ships; Osney Bridge in Oxford, which has the lowest headroom of any bridge on the Thames that generally restricts navigation to smaller vessels such as narrowboats and cabin cruisers, and the long reach above St John&#x27;s Lock, the first lock downstream of the river’s source, on the outskirts of Lechlade, where the river can become treacherously narrow and shallow for anything but small motorboats and human-powered vessels.

In the United States, the entirety of a navigable waterway up to the head of navigation is subject to federal jurisdiction. The government recognizes that the &quot;upper limit&quot; of navigability will &quot;often be the same point traditionally recognized as the head of navigation&quot; but may under some circumstances lie &quot;yet farther upstream.&quot;

<text>Rennell and Bellona is one of the nine provinces of Solomon Islands, comprising two inhabited raised coral atolls, Rennell and Bellona, or &#x27; and &#x27; respectively in Rennellese (a Polynesian language), as well as the uninhabited Indispensable Reef. Rennell and Bellona are both Polynesian-inhabited islands within the predominantly Melanesian Solomons. They are thus considered Polynesian outliers. The first known European to sight the islands was Mathew Boyd of Camberwell, London, commander of the merchant ship, &quot;Bellona&quot;, in 1793. The province has a combined population of 3,041 (2009 census), the least populous province of Solomon Islands. The Samoic language of the islands is, in English texts, called Rennellese. The province&#x27;s capital is Tigoa, on Rennell Island.

==History==
In 1793, Bellona Island was named after a passing British ship, the Bellona. Rennell Island may have been named for the oceanographer James Rennell, FRS (1742–1830). In 1799, according to a chart, both islands were named Bellona Island. In 1816 the islands were referred to as Rennell&#x27;s Isles.

The names the islanders used for self-reference are (Bellona) and (Rennell), meaning &#x27;small mountain&#x27; and &#x27;large island&#x27; respectively ( meaning &#x27;island&#x27; or &#x27;mountain&#x27;, meaning &#x27;small&#x27;, and meaning &#x27;large&#x27;). Young people on both islands sometimes use the name for both islands.

According to oral traditions, the islands were originally inhabited by a people of another culture before the ancestors of present-day Polynesians arrived in canoes from their homeland, ‘Uvea Gago (probably Ouvéa in the Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia). On their voyage, they arrived at ‘Uvea Matangi (probably East ‘Uvea, or Wallis Island, in Wallis and Futuna), and finally reached Rennell Island, where they found no inhabitants. They were told by a medium, Tahasi, that there was another island yet to be sighted and they left Rennell in search of it. They subsequently arrived at Bellona, where they found people, the Hiti, living in caves on the island near the shore. The Hiti were dark-skinned, short people with long hair reaching to their knees and spoke a language intelligible to the invaders, who gradually killed off the indigenous inhabitants. The oral traditions of Rennell and Bellona relate that the first invaders consisted of seven married couples who each founded a clan (), of which five became extinct. Ancestors of the two remaining clans, Kaitu’u and Iho, still inhabit the islands.

In oral traditions, narrators tell of scattered and singular voyages to and from other inhabited places in the Western Pacific. Just after settling, some men returned to East ‘Uvea (Wallis Island) to fetch precious turmeric root stocks that were used for ritual dyeing and anointment. In following generations two men went to Mungua (probably Woodlark Island, also known as Murua) and returned with place names and new kinds of yams and bananas. Another oral tradition details the arrival of a New Caledonian ship with tobacco and steel adzes. Other oral traditions state that poultry was brought to Rennell before the first Christian missionaries to the island were killed in 1910. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, Bellonese and Rennellese people were taken to Queensland by Blackbirders to work in the sugar plantations. One Rennellese man is known to have returned, bringing home with him Western goods such as axes, cotton cloth, umbrellas, and guns.

Initially, the two islands were contacted only sporadically by Europeans and Americans up to the later part of the nineteenth century. In 1910 the first three Christian missionaries were killed on Rennell, and the islands were left to themselves until preachers from the Seventh-day Adventists (SDA), the Church of England and the South Seas Evangelical Mission (SSEM) arrived in 1936. They took a group of Rennellese men to mission stations in other parts of Solomon Islands. In 1938, the Seventh Day Adventist Church became dominant on Rennell, followed by Bellona, which gradually converted all the inhabitants to Christianity. They destroyed all their heathen temples and built Christian churches all over the Islands.

Not until after World War II (1945) did Westernization slowly influence the two islands. A closer contact with the rest of Solomon Islands sped up the modernization process. More regular shipping was initiated, and children were sent to mission schools on other islands. In the 1950s health clinics and wireless contact were established on both islands. Regular air service to both islands was established in the beginning of the 1970s.

On July 7, 1978, Solomon Islands gained its independence from Great Britain, and Rennell and Bellona became part of the newly created country. About fifteen years later, Rennell and Bellona became a province of their own. &lt;br&gt;At the turn of the millennium the different churches began losing their power, especially over the younger generation. Sports, music and home brewing became leisure-time interests, and education and vocational training rose in importance.

In 2005, there were reports that the people of Rennell and Bellona province were determined to secede from the country following a lack of infrastructure investment.

The history and linkage of the Rennellese people with the Māori are explored in a documentary entitled the &quot;Mystery of the Lost Waka (canoe)&quot;, made by Maori TV in 2007.

==Provincial government==
In 1993, Rennell and Bellona became a province of Solomon Islands, becoming the only Polynesian province in the predominantly Melanesian country. The province is also a single constituency, Rennell and Bellona Constituency, represented in parliament by a single Member of Parliament. Today, the current Member of Parliament for Rennell and Bellona is Hon. Tautai Kaitu&#x27;u, an Australian-based doctor from Rennell Island.

The provincial government is made up of 10 wards (provincial equivalent of a constituency) represented by 10 elected members known in the provincial assembly as Members of the Provincial Assembly (MPAs). Rennell Island, the larger of the two islands, has six wards and Bellona only has four, namely wards seven to ten.
Rennell and Bellona Province is sub-divided into the following wards. Population is noted as of the 2009 census:

* Rennell-Bellona Province (3,041)
** East Tenggano (367)
** West Tenggano (378)
** Lughu (362)
** Kanava (239)
** Te Tau Gangoto (569)
** Mugi Henua (117)
** Matangi (144)
** East Gaongau (265)
** West Gaongau (350)
** Sa&#x27;aiho (250) 
&lt;br&gt;
Note: These figures changed every four years as more voters turned 18. The total number is not the total population of the Islands as they only take into account those eligible to vote in the National General Election and provincial elections.

==Geography==

===Climate===

The islands are subject to tropical storms and cyclones, with the tropical cyclone season running from 1 November to 30 June. In recent history, substantial damage was caused by Cyclone Esau and Cyclone Nina in 1992, Cyclone Fergus in 1996, Cyclone Drena in 1997, Cyclone Beni in 2003, Cyclone Ului in 2010 and Cyclone Freda in 2012.

<doc id="638809" wikidata="Q1514075" url="?curid=638809" title="Godzilla vs. Destoroyah">
<text>is a 1995 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Takao Okawara, with special effects by Kōichi Kawakita. Distributed by Toho and produced under their subsidiary Toho Pictures, it is the 22nd installment in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, and is the seventh and final film in the franchise&#x27;s Heisei period. The film features the fictional monster characters Godzilla, Godzilla Junior and Destoroyah, and stars Takuro Tatsumi, Yōko Ishino, Yasufumi Hayashi, Sayaka Osawa, Megumi Odaka, Masahiro Takashima, Momoko Kōchi and Akira Nakao, with Kenpachiro Satsuma as Godzilla, Hurricane Ryu as Godzilla Junior, and Ryo Hariya as Destoroyah.

In the film, Godzilla&#x27;s heart, which acts as a nuclear reactor, is nearing a nuclear meltdown which threatens the Earth. Meanwhile, a colony of mutated creatures known as Destoroyah emerge from the sea, changing form and terrorizing Japan, forcing the Japanese Self-Defense Forces to devise a plan to eliminate both threats.

&quot;Godzilla vs. Destoroyah&quot; received global publicity following an announcement by Toho that the film would feature the death of Godzilla. It was the final film starring actress Momoko Kōchi, produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka, and scored by composer Akira Ifukube before their deaths, though Ifukube&#x27;s themes would continue to be used in subsequent films. The film was released theatrically in Japan on December 9, 1995 and received a direct-to-video release in the United States in 1999 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. It was the last &quot;Godzilla&quot; film to be produced by any studio until the 1998 film &quot;Godzilla&quot;, and was the last &quot;Godzilla&quot; film produced by Toho until the 1999 film &quot;Godzilla 2000&quot;.

==Plot==
One year after the defeat of SpaceGodzilla by the hands of Godzilla and JSDF&#x27;s mecha M.O.G.U.E.R.A., Miki Saegusa of the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center (UNGCC) travels to Baas Island to monitor Godzilla and his son Little, only to find the entire island destroyed and both monsters missing as the island was ingulfed in an explosion of nuclear fission. Godzilla, now covered in lava-like rashes, subsequently appears in Hong Kong and destroys great swathes of the city with an empowered version of his atomic breath. The JSDF hires college student Kenkichi Yamane, a grandson of Dr. Kyohei who had encountered the first Godzilla, to unravel the mystery of Godzilla&#x27;s condition. Yamane suspects that Godzilla&#x27;s heart, which acts as a nuclear reactor, is undergoing a nuclear meltdown as a result of the monster absorbing the energy released from a volcanically triggered uranium deposit on Baas Island. Yamane theorizes that when Godzilla&#x27;s temperature reaches , he will lead to a thermonuclear explosion with enough energy to melt the Earth down to its core.

The JSDF deploys the Super X III, an aerial combat vehicle outfitted with ultra-low temperature lasers, in an attempt to reverse Godzilla&#x27;s self-destruction. While Godzilla&#x27;s meltdown is not stopped, it is halted long enough to render Godzilla unconscious temporarily. Meanwhile, a colony of Precambrian organisms mutated by the Oxygen Destroyer used to defeat the original Godzilla are awoken during the construction of the Tokyo Bay Aqua Line. The organisms combine into several human-sized crab-like monsters and engage the JSDF in several deadly skirmishes. The monsters, dubbed &quot;Destoroyah,&quot; are revealed to be vulnerable to subzero temperatures and are temporarily held at bay with low-temperature lasers. Destoroyah respond to the threat by merging into its larger form, which destroys the lasers and takes to the skies in its flying form.

Godzilla awakens, his condition having worsened to the point that his meltdown could potentially destroy the Earth through a China syndrome-like incident. Miki locates now grown-up Little, redubbed as Godzilla Junior, and telepathically lures it to Tokyo, hoping that Godzilla will follow and be killed by Destoroyah. Junior arrives and battles Destoroyah, who absorbs his DNA before being seemingly defeated. Godzilla arrives at Haneda Airport and reunites with Junior, only for Destoroyah, bolstered by Junior&#x27;s DNA, drops Junior onto the Ariake Coliseum and blasting Micro-Oxygen beam into Junior, killing him, causing Godzilla manages to drive off his adversary.

After unsuccessfully attempting to revive Junior, Godzilla&#x27;s bereavement accelerates his temperature increases. In the ensuing battle with Destoroyah, Godzilla&#x27;s temperature reaches a critical state, allowing him to wound Destoroyah. As the injured Destoroyah tries to retreat, the JSDF fires its low-temperature lasers at its wings, causing it to plummet onto the superheated ground, destroying Destoroyah in the process.

As Godzilla goes into meltdown, the JSDF is able to minimize the damage with its low-temperature weapons. While successful in preventing Earth&#x27;s destruction, Godzilla slowly dies from his meltdown, which renders Tokyo uninhabitable. After the radiation in Tokyo abruptly decreases to background levels, Junior&#x27;s lifeless body had absorbed Godzilla&#x27;s radiation, resurrecting him and transforming him into the new Godzilla.

==Cast==
==Production==
After &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot; and &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot; failed to match the attendance figures of the highly successful &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot;, producer Shogo Tomiyama announced in the summer of 1995 that the next &quot;Godzilla&quot; movie would be the series&#x27; final installment. Screenwriter Kazuki Ōmori initially proposed a story treatment entitled &quot;Godzilla vs. Ghost Godzilla&quot;, in which the current Heisei Godzilla would have faced off against the ghost of the original 1954 Godzilla. While this idea was scrapped, it was decided to maintain the reference to the original film by reintroducing the Oxygen Destroyer, the weapon that killed the original Godzilla 40 years earlier. In the original script, the final battle was to have taken place in the then still under construction World City, a development project costing $2.35 billion, though Tokyo governor Yukio Aoshima scrapped the project on account of its unpopularity with taxpayers. Toho began promoting the movie via large placards featuring the &quot;kanji&quot; text ゴジラ死す (&quot;Godzilla dies&quot;).

In conceptualizing Godzilla&#x27;s final adversary, screenwriter Kazuki Ōmori initially proposed having the Heisei Godzilla battle the ghost of the original 1954 Godzilla. Instead, the filmmakers settled on a new monster that was a by-product of the Oxygen Destroyer. The character was initially going to be named &quot;Barubaroi&quot;, though this was rejected on account of it sounding too similar to Berber, and thus could have been considered offensive. The Barubaroi designs were more chimeric, in the style of the creature from &quot;The Thing&quot;, than the finalized Destoroyah look, though they shared Destoroyah&#x27;s trait of surpassing Godzilla in height.

All of Destoroyah&#x27;s forms were designed by Minoru Yoshida, who&#x27;d been instructed to make the creature a crustacean. His design for Destoroyah&#x27;s final form was given to illustrator Noriyoshi Ohrai, who incorporated it into the movie poster. Ohrai&#x27;s depiction was later used as the basis for the 3D model used in constructing the creature&#x27;s suit.

Five days prior to the film&#x27;s release, a large bronze sculpture of Godzilla was erected on the Hibiya cinema district. After the film&#x27;s release, Toho studios was bombarded by letters of protest demanding Godzilla&#x27;s resurrection, and several mourners gathered at the bronze statue to leave ¥10-100 coins and tobacco. One Japanese travel agency commemorated Godzilla&#x27;s demise by hosting tours of various locations destroyed by Godzilla throughout its 40-year tenure. Toho representatives assured the public that Godzilla&#x27;s death was not permanent, though they were not planning to revive him until the 21st century due to TriStar Pictures&#x27; plans to adapt the character in a film trilogy. However, after the first film was poorly received, Toho returned to the series in 1999 with the first film of the &quot;Millennium Era&quot;, &quot;Godzilla 2000: Millennium&quot;.

===Special effects===
Effects artist Koichi Kawakita originally envisioned Godzilla being luminescent, and coated a Godzilla suit with luminescent paint and reflective tape, though this was deemed to look too unnatural. The final product was the result of placing 200 small orange light bulbs on the suit previously used for &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot; and covering them with semitransparent vinyl plates. The resulting suit proved difficult for suit actor Kenpachiro Satsuma to perform in, as the cable powering the light bulbs added extra weight to the suit, and the carbonic acid gas emitted by the costume nearly suffocated him six times. For Godzilla&#x27;s confrontation with the Super-X III, the now-expendable suit previously used for &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot; was used, as it was predicted that it would have suffered irreparable damage from the liquid nitrogen used during the scene.

Godzilla Junior and Destoroyah were also portrayed via traditional suitmation techniques, though because the Junior suit was almost the same size as the main Godzilla one, a small animatronic prop was used in scenes where Junior interacts with his father for the purpose of proper scaling. During the scene where the JSDF bombards the immature Destoroyahs, the creatures were realized with Bandai action figures. Kawakita made greater use of CGI than in previous installments, having used it for the Super-X III&#x27;s freezing of Godzilla, shots showing helicopters, computer schematics showing the outcome of Godzilla&#x27;s meltdown, and Godzilla&#x27;s death.

===Music===
Composer Akira Ifukube, who had previously declined to compose the score of &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot;, agreed to work on &quot;Godzilla vs. Destoroyah&quot;&#x27;s soundtrack since he &quot;felt that since [he had] been involved in Godzilla&#x27;s birth, it was fitting for [him] to be involved in his death.&quot; For Destoroyah&#x27;s theme, Ifukube had initially wanted to give each of Destoroyah&#x27;s forms their own motif, though he subsequently chose to give them all the same theme. He chose not to use the Oxygen Destroyer theme from the original 1954 film, as he felt that the theme expressed the tragedy of the weapon&#x27;s creator, and thus was inappropriate for a monster. He also deliberately avoided using Godzilla&#x27;s death theme from the original film, as he wanted to focus more on the dark side of humanity rather than on Godzilla itself. In describing his composition of Godzilla&#x27;s death theme, he stated that it was one of the most difficult pieces he had ever composed, and that he approached it as if he were writing the theme to his own death.

The Japanese heavy metal band Destroya derived its name from the character Destoroyah.

==Merchandise==
Various video games based on the film were released, all published by Sega and released in 1995. &quot;&quot; for Sega Game Gear, &quot;Godzilla: Heart-Pounding Monster Island&quot; for Sega Pico, and &quot;Godzilla: Rettoushinkan&quot; for Sega Saturn.

&quot;Rettoushinkan&quot; was well known for being a first real-time tactics video game to be released on 32-Bit Consoles, by 11 month before the PlayStation port of . as well as the only real-time tactics video game for the system, as the Sega Saturn version of Syndicate Wars was being cancelled in March 1997, with Bullfrog&#x27;s head of conversions, Steve Metcalf, explaining that the Saturn market was not large enough to cover development costs.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film opened at number one at the Japanese box office and went on to sell approximately 4 million tickets in Japan for a gross of total of (). It earned ¥2 billion in distribution income (around ). It was the number one domestic film at the box office in Japan by distribution income for 1996 and Fourth Place overall behind &quot;Twister&quot;, &quot;SE7EN&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

===Critical response===
 Rotten Tomatoes ranked the film #6 out of all entries in the franchise.

Toho Kingdom said, &quot;With an elegant style, a powerful plot, brilliant effects, and believable acting, this entry is definitely a notch above favorites from all three timelines, and its impact on the series is challenged by only a handful of competitors.&quot; Michael Hubert of Monster Zero praised the &quot;spectacular monster battles&quot;, adding: &quot;Even for non-Godzilla fans, this movie might help dispel some of the preconceptions you have about Godzilla&#x27;s &#x27;cheese factor&#x27;.&quot; Japan Hero called the film &quot;a work of art&quot; and &quot;a must see for anyone who loves Godzilla&quot; that features &quot;something for everyone&quot;.

Stomp Kaiju gave the film a score of 4 out of 5, saying &quot;This is one of the biggest productions the big G ever had. The new Super-X III, looking black and stealth-bombery, is a great addition, and the return of Lt. Sho Kuroki (Masashiro Takashima) from Godzilla vs Biollante as its pilot is a nice touch [...] It&#x27;s nice to see a company handle its property, beloved by millions, with a little respect and knowledge of that property&#x27;s history.&quot; Tim Brayton of &quot;Alternate Ending&quot; called it &quot;A Godzilla movie of particular grandeur and seriousness&quot;, saying &quot;it&#x27;s the best Godzilla film of the VS era: visually robust, focused on great heaving gestures and emotions that work so much better in this franchise than the attempts at human-scaled storytelling that some of the more recent sequels gestured towards.&quot;

Mike Bogue of American Kaiju felt the film suffered from &quot;several visual weaknesses&quot; and a &quot;disappointing editing&quot;, but that &quot;the positive aspects of the visuals outweigh the negatives&quot;, and praised the film for &quot;treating Godzilla with the same awe, majesty, and terror as [the original 1954 &quot;Godzilla&quot;]&quot;. A mixed review came from DVD Talk, saying that &quot;Although it benefits from having an honest-to-goodness storyline with some continuity from the previous Godzillas (going back to the earliest films), Destoroyah&#x27;s portentous pacing, cardboard-thin characters and cheeseball effects apparently served as a primer on what not to do when Hollywood picked up the franchise.&quot;

&quot;Complex&quot; listed the character as No. 3 on its &quot;The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time&quot; list. Journalist and film historian Steve Ryfle called Destoroyah a &quot;nearly immobile Predator-meets-SpaceGodzilla clone&quot;, stating the character is &quot;more laughable than menacing, and should be placed alongside Megalon and Gigan in the back rooms of the Toho monster gallery.&quot;

===Home media===
The film has been released on DVD by Columbia/Tristar Home Entertainment on February 1, 2000, along with &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot;.

It was released on blu-ray in &quot;The Toho Godzilla Collection&quot; by Sony on May 6, 2014, along with &quot;Godzilla vs. Megaguirus&quot;.

==History==

In 1817, the territory now comprising Thane district was taken over by the British from the Peshwa and it became a part of North Konkan district, with its headquarters in Thana. Since then, it has undergone considerable changes in its boundaries. In 1830, the North Konkan district was expanded by adding parts of South Konkan district and in 1833 was renamed Thane District. In 1853, the three sub-divisions of Pen, Roha and Mahad together with Underi and Revadanda agencies of Kolaba were formed into the sub-collectorate of Kolaba, under Thana, and ultimately were separated to become an independent Kolaba district in 1869 (now known as Raigad district).

Back in 1866, the administrative sub-divisions of Thane were reorganised and renamed: Sanjan as Dahanu, Kolvan as Shahapur and Nasrapur as Karjat. Vada petha was upgraded to the level of a taluka. Uran Mahal was separated from Salsette in 1861 and was placed under Panvel. Panvel, together with its mahals of Uran and Karanja, was transferred to Kolaba district in 1883 and Karjat was transferred in 1891. A new mahal with Bandra as headquarters was created in 1917 and in 1920 Salsette was divided into two talukas — North Salsette and South Salsette. South Salsette consisting of 84 villages was separated from Thana District and included in the newly created Bombay Suburban district (present Mumbai Suburban district). North Salsette was made a mahal under Kalyan taluka in 1923 and renamed as Thane in 1926. Kelve-Mahim was renamed as Palghar. 33 villages of the Bombay Suburban district were transferred to Thana district in 1945 and 14 of them were re-transferred to the Bombay Suburban district in 1946 when the Aarey Milk Colony was constituted.

After Independence, in 1949, the Koli princely state of Jawhar was merged with Thana district and became a separate taluka. As many as twenty-seven villages and eight towns from Borivali taluka and one town and one village from Thana taluka were transferred to the Bombay Suburban district in 1956 when the limits of Greater Bombay were extended northwards in Salsette. In 1960, following the bifurcation of the bilingual Bombay State, 47 villages, and three towns in the taluka of Umbargaon were transferred to Surat district in Gujarat and its remaining twenty-seven villages were first included in Dahanu and later in 1961 made into a separate mahal, Talasari. In 1969, the taluka of Kalyan was divided into two talukas, Kalyan and Ulhasnagar.

==Geography==
The district is the northernmost part of the Konkan lowlands of Maharashtra. It comprises the wide amphitheatre like Ulhas basin on the south and hilly Vaitarna valley on the north together with plateaus and the slopes of Sahyadri. From the steep slopes of the Sahyadri in the east, the land falls through a succession of plateaus in the north and centre of the district to the Ulhas valley in the south. These lowlands are separated from the coast by a fairly well-defined narrow ridge of hills that runs north–south to the east of the Thane creek, parallel to the sea, keeping a distance of about 6 to 10 km from the shores. Isolated hills and spurs dot the district area.

=== Rivers and hot springs ===
The two main rivers flowing through the district are the Ulhas and the Vaitarna. The Ulhas originates from the north of Tungarli near Lonavala, flows for a short distance before descending near Bor ghat, and meets the sea at Vasai Creek. The Ulhas River is 135 km long. The river has many tributaries; the two most important of them (within the boundaries of this district) are the Barvi and the Bhatsa. The Vaitarna, the largest of the Konkan rivers, rises in the Tryambak Hills in Nashik district, opposite to the source of the Godavari. The river flows across Shahapur, wada and Palghar talukas and enter the Arabian Sea through a wide estuary off Arnala. The Vaitarna River is 154 km long and has a drainage area that practically covers the entire northern part of the district. It has a number of tributaries; the most important of them are the Pinjal, Surya, Daherja and Tansa.

Many small creeks are found all along the western coast, in which tidal waters flood upstream and fill up much low ground. In many cases human interference has helped in converting them into mud flats. The bigger creeks are Bhiwandi, Chinchani, and Dahanu Creeks. The Thane Creek is not a creek in the true sense, but a depression engulfed by the sea.

The northern part of the Salsette Island is part of Thane District, which is separated from the mainland by the Ulhas estuary and the Thane Creek but is connected through reclaimed land with the island city of Mumbai. Arnala Island is located in Vasai taluka, at the entrance to the Vaitarna estuary.

The district has no natural lakes. Artificial lakes have been constructed mainly to supply drinking water to Mumbai. The Tansa Lake formed across the Tansa River in the hills north of Bhiwandi behind the dam completed in 1892 CE. The Modak Sagar (Lower Vaitarna) Lake on the river Vaitarna formed behind a dam completed in 1957 CE. In the upper reaches of the same river, the Upper Vaitarana Lake formed behind another dam built in 1972 CE. The Bhatsa Lake has been formed in the upper Bhatsa, north of Shahapur behind a dam built in 1981 CE.
Tourism
Nature lovers proudly call Thane as a “Lake City” or &quot;city of lakes&quot;.

They are near Akloli, Ganeshpuri and Vajreshwari villages. There are some more examples: Kokner (Maswan tal-Palghar) and Sativali (Saphale tal:-Palghar). The water temperatures are in the range of 42°-55 °C.

===Climate===

The district has four seasons. Winter is from December to February, followed by summer from March to June. The southwest monsoon season is from June to September. October and November months constitute the post-monsoon season, which is hot and humid in the coastal areas.

In the coastal area, the average daily maximum temperature in summer is 32.9 °C (maximum recorded at Dahanu is 40.6 °C on 19 April 1955) and in winter average mean daily minimum temperature is 16.8 °C (minimum recorded at Dahanu is 8.3 °C on 8 January 1945). But in the interior parts of the district, the average daily minimum temperature is slightly lower in the winter season and the average daily maximum temperature is higher in the summer.

The average annual rainfall in the district is 2293.4 mm. The rainfall in the district increases from the coastal areas to the interior. The rainfall varies from 1730.5 mm at Mahim on the coast to 2588.7 mm at Shahapur in the interior. The rainfall during the southwest monsoon season, June to September, constitutes about 94% of the annual rainfall. July is the wettest month with a rainfall of about 40% of the annual total. The variation in the annual rainfall from year to year in the district is not large. The highest rainfall recorded in 24 hours at any station in the district was 481.1 mm at Dahanu on 1 September 1958 CE.

For a number of years up until 2013, it was proposed that the Thane district be divided and a separate Jawhar District carved out of the existing Thane district with the inclusion of the northern tribal talukas of Thane district which include Palghar, Vada, Vikramgad, Jawhar, Mokhada, Dahanu and Talasari talukas in the proposed Jawhar district. The last Princely Ruler of Jawhar State at Indian independence was His Highness Maharaja Patangshah V (Yashwantrao Martandrao) Mukne. Jawhar was the cultural capital of this rural part of Thane District which was previously known as Jawhar State ruled by Kolis. However, in June 2014, the Maharashtra State government decided to add an eighth taluka Vasai, which was previously part of Thane district to the other seven talukas, and decided that the new District would be headquartered in Palghar.
In June 2014, the State Cabinet approved the bifurcation of the district into two districts - Thane and Palghar. The new Palghar district comprises the seven talukas which it had been proposed to comprise in the putative Jawhar District, with the addition of Vasai taluka. The effective date for bifurcation was 1 August 2014.

<doc id="638824" wikidata="Q1541162" url="?curid=638824" title="Interrupt handler">
<text>In computer systems programming, an interrupt handler, also known as an interrupt service routine or ISR, is a special block of code associated with a specific interrupt condition. Interrupt handlers are initiated by hardware interrupts, software interrupt instructions, or software exceptions, and are used for implementing device drivers or transitions between protected modes of operation, such as system calls.

The traditional form of interrupt handler is the hardware interrupt handler. Hardware interrupts arise from electrical conditions or low-level protocols implemented in digital logic, are usually dispatched via a hard-coded table of interrupt vectors, asynchronously to the normal execution stream (as interrupt masking levels permit), often using a separate stack, and automatically entering into a different execution context (privilege level) for the duration of the interrupt handler&#x27;s execution. In general, hardware interrupts and their handlers are used to handle high-priority conditions that require the interruption of the current code the processor is executing.

Later it was found convenient for software to be able to trigger the same mechanism by means of a software interrupt (a form of synchronous interrupt). Rather than using a hard-coded interrupt dispatch table at the hardware level, software interrupts are often implemented at the operating system level as a form of callback function.

Interrupt handlers have a multitude of functions, which vary based on what triggered the interrupt and the speed at which the interrupt handler completes its task. For example, pressing a key on a computer keyboard, or moving the mouse, triggers interrupts that call interrupt handlers which read the key, or the mouse&#x27;s position, and copy the associated information into the computer&#x27;s memory.

An interrupt handler is a low-level counterpart of event handlers. However, interrupt handlers have an unusual execution context, many harsh constraints in time and space, and their intrinsically asynchronous nature makes them notoriously difficult to debug by standard practice (reproducible test cases generally don&#x27;t exist), thus demanding a specialized skillset—an important subset of system programming—of software engineers who engage at the hardware interrupt layer.

== Interrupt flags ==
Unlike other event handlers, interrupt handlers are expected to set interrupt flags to appropriate values as part of their core functionality.

Even in a CPU which supports nested interrupts, a handler is often reached with all interrupts globally masked by a CPU hardware operation. In this architecture, an interrupt handler would normally save the smallest amount of context necessary, and then reset the global interrupt disable flag at the first opportunity, to permit higher priority interrupts to interrupt the current handler. It is also important for the interrupt handler to quell the current interrupt source by some method (often toggling a flag bit of some kind in a peripheral register) so that the current interrupt isn&#x27;t immediately repeated on handler exit, resulting in an infinite loop.

Exiting an interrupt handler with the interrupt system in exactly the right state under every eventuality can sometimes be an arduous and exacting task, and its mishandling is the source of many serious bugs, of the kind that halt the system completely. These bugs are sometimes intermittent, with the mishandled edge case not occurring for weeks or months of continuous operation. Formal validation of interrupt handlers is tremendously difficult, while testing typically identifies only the most frequent failure modes, thus subtle, intermittent bugs in interrupt handlers often ship to end customers.

== Execution context ==
In a modern operating system, upon entry the execution context of a hardware interrupt handler is subtle.

For reasons of performance, the handler will typically be initiated in the memory and execution context of the running process, to which it has no special connection (the interrupt is essentially usurping the running context—process time accounting will often accrue time spent handling interrupts to the interrupted process). However, unlike the interrupted process, the interrupt is usually elevated by a hard-coded CPU mechanism to a privilege level high enough to access hardware resources directly.

== Stack space considerations==
In a low-level microcontroller, the chip might lack protection modes and have no memory management unit (MMU). In these chips, the execution context of an interrupt handler will be essentially the same as the interrupted program, which typically runs on a small stack of fixed size (memory resources have traditionally been extremely scant at the low end). Nested interrupts are often provided, which exacerbates stack usage. A primary constraint on the interrupt handler in this programming endeavour is to not exceed the available stack in the worst-case condition, requiring the programmer to reason globally about the stack space requirement of every implemented interrupt handler and application task.

When allocated stack space is exceeded (a condition known as a stack overflow), this is not normally detected in hardware by chips of this class. If the stack is exceeded into another writable memory area, the handler will typically work as expected, but the application will fail later (sometimes much later) due to the handler&#x27;s side effect of memory corruption. If the stack is exceeded into a non-writable (or protected) memory area, the failure will usually occur inside the handler itself (generally the easier case to later debug).

In the writable case, one can implement a sentinel stack guard—a fixed value right beyond the end of the legal stack whose value &quot;can&quot; be overwritten, but never will be if the system operates correctly. It is common to regularly observe corruption of the stack guard with some kind of watch dog mechanism. This will catch the majority of stack overflow conditions at a point in time close to the offending operation.

In a multitasking system, each thread of execution will typically have its own stack. If no special system stack is provided for interrupts, interrupts will consume stack space from whatever thread of execution is interrupted. These designs usually contain an MMU, and the user stacks are usually configured such that stack overflow is trapped by the MMU, either as a system error (for debugging) or to remap memory to extend the space available. Memory resources at this level of microcontroller are typically far less constrained, so that stacks can be allocated with a generous safety margin.

In systems supporting high thread counts, it is better if the hardware interrupt mechanism switches the stack to a special system stack, so that none of the thread stacks need account for worst-case nested interrupt usage. Tiny CPUs as far back as the 8-bit Motorola 6809 from 1978 have provided separate system and user stack pointers.

== Constraints in time and concurrency ==
For many reasons, it is highly desired that the interrupt handler execute as briefly as possible, and it is highly discouraged (or forbidden) for a hardware interrupt to invoke potentially blocking system calls. In a system with multiple execution cores, considerations of reentrancy are also paramount. If the system provides for hardware DMA, concurrency issues can arise even with only a single CPU core. (It is not uncommon for a mid-tier microcontroller to lack protection levels and an MMU, but still provide a DMA engine with many channels; in this scenario, many interrupts are typically &quot;triggered&quot; by the DMA engine itself, and the associated interrupt handler is expected to tread carefully.)

A modern practice has evolved to divide hardware interrupt handlers into front-half and back-half elements. The front-half (or first level) receives the initial interrupt in the context of the running process, does the minimal work to restore the hardware to a less urgent condition (such as emptying a full receive buffer) and then marks the back-half (or second level) for execution in the near future at the appropriate scheduling priority; once invoked, the back-half operates in its own process context with fewer restrictions and completes the handler&#x27;s logical operation (such as conveying the newly received data to an operating system data queue).

== Divided handlers in modern operating systems ==
In several operating systemsLinux, Unix, macOS, Microsoft Windows, z/OS, DESQview and some other operating systems used in the pastinterrupt handlers are divided into two parts: the First-Level Interrupt Handler (FLIH) and the Second-Level Interrupt Handlers (SLIH). FLIHs are also known as &quot;hard interrupt handlers&quot; or &quot;fast interrupt handlers&quot;, and SLIHs are also known as &quot;slow/soft interrupt handlers&quot;, or Deferred Procedure Calls in Windows.

A FLIH implements at minimum platform-specific interrupt handling similar to &quot;interrupt routines&quot;. In response to an interrupt, there is a context switch, and the code for the interrupt is loaded and executed. The job of a FLIH is to quickly service the interrupt, or to record platform-specific critical information which is only available at the time of the interrupt, and schedule the execution of a SLIH for further long-lived interrupt handling.

FLIHs cause jitter in process execution. FLIHs also mask interrupts. Reducing the jitter is most important for real-time operating systems, since they must maintain a guarantee that execution of specific code will complete within an agreed amount of time. To reduce jitter and to reduce the potential for losing data from masked interrupts, programmers attempt to minimize the execution time of a FLIH, moving as much as possible to the SLIH. With the speed of modern computers, FLIHs may implement all device and platform-dependent handling, and use a SLIH for further platform-independent long-lived handling.

FLIHs which service hardware typically mask their associated interrupt (or keep it masked as the case may be) until they complete their execution. An (unusual) FLIH which unmasks its associated interrupt before it completes is called a reentrant interrupt handler. Reentrant interrupt handlers might cause a stack overflow from multiple preemptions by the same interrupt vector, and so they are usually avoided. In a priority interrupt system, the FLIH also (briefly) masks other interrupts of equal or lesser priority.

A SLIH completes long interrupt processing tasks similarly to a process. SLIHs either have a dedicated kernel thread for each handler, or are executed by a pool of kernel worker threads. These threads sit on a run queue in the operating system until processor time is available for them to perform processing for the interrupt. SLIHs may have a long-lived execution time, and thus are typically scheduled similarly to threads and processes.

In Linux, FLIHs are called &quot;upper half&quot;, and SLIHs are called &quot;lower half&quot; or &quot;bottom half&quot;. This is different from naming used in other Unix-like systems, where both are a part of &quot;bottom half&quot;.

<doc id="638826" wikidata="Q462270" url="?curid=638826" title="Sylvia Townsend Warner">
<text>Sylvia Nora Townsend Warner (6 December 1893 – 1 May 1978) was an English novelist, poet and musicologist, known for works such as &quot;Lolly Willowes&quot;, &quot;The Corner That Held Them&quot;, and &quot;Kingdoms of Elfin&quot;. Her paternal grandfather, The Reverend George Townsend Warner was headmaster of Newton Abbot Proprietary College in Devon where he had taught Arthur Quiller Couch, Bertram Fletcher Robinson and Percy Fawcett.

==Life==
Sylvia Townsend Warner was born at Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex, the only child of George Townsend Warner and his wife Eleanor &quot;Nora&quot; Mary (née Hudleston). Her father was a house-master at Harrow School and was, for many years, associated with the prestigious Harrow History Prize which was renamed the Townsend Warner History Prize following his death in 1916. As a child, Warner was home-schooled by her father after being kicked out of kindergarten for mimicking the teachers. She was musically inclined, and, before World War I, planned to study in Vienna under Schoenberg. She enjoyed a seemingly idyllic childhood in rural Devonshire, but was strongly affected by her father&#x27;s death. She moved to London and worked in a munitions factory at the outbreak of World War I.

In 1923, she met T. F. Powys, whose writing influenced her own and whose work she in turn encouraged. The two became friends, and her debut novel, &quot;Lolly Willowes,&quot; was published shortly after in 1926. From her first work, it was clear that Warner&#x27;s focus was on subverting societal norms; she would later heavily use the themes of rejecting the Church, a need for female empowerment, and independence in her works. It was at Powys&#x27; home that Warner first met Valentine Ackland, a young poet; the two women fell in love, moving in together in 1930 and eventually settling at Frome Vauchurch, Dorset, in 1937. Her relationship with Ackland inspired many of Warner&#x27;s works, and the couple collaborated on a collection of poems, &quot;Whether a Dove or a Seagull&quot;, published in 1933. Warner and Ackland&#x27;s relationship was tumultuous in part due to Ackland&#x27;s infidelity, which included an affair with fellow writer Elizabeth Wade White. Alarmed by the growing threat of fascism, they were active in the Communist Party, and Marxist ideals found their way into Warner&#x27;s works. Warner participated in the II International Congress of Writers for the Defence of Culture, held in Valencia between 4 and 17 July 1937, while serving in the Red Cross during the Spanish Civil War. After the war, Warner and Ackland permanently returned to England, living together until Ackland&#x27;s death in 1969. In 1950 and 1951 they rented Great Eye Folly at Salthouse, where Warner wrote her final novel, &quot;The Flint Anchor&quot; (published 1954).

After Warner&#x27;s death in 1978, her ashes were buried with Ackland&#x27;s at St Nicholas, Chaldon Herring, Dorset.

==Work==
Early in her career Warner researched 15th and 16th century music. From 1917 she was in regular employment as one of the editors of &quot;Tudor Church Music&quot;, ten volumes published by Oxford University Press in the 1920s with the support of the Carnegie UK Trust. The lead editor was initially Sir Richard Terry, who as the Master of Music at Westminster Cathedral, had been a pioneer in the revival of Tudor vocal repertoire. Warner obtained the work as the protegee of her lover and music teacher Sir Percy Buck, who was on the editorial committee.

Warner was involved in travelling to study source material and in transcribing the music into modern musical notation for publication. Warner wrote a section on musical notation for the &quot;Oxford History of Music&quot; (it appeared in the introductory volume of 1929).

Her first published book was the 1925 poetry collection &quot;The Espalier&quot;, which was praised by A. E. Housman and Arthur Quiller-Couch. She was encouraged to write fiction by David Garnett. Warner&#x27;s novels included &quot;Lolly Willowes&quot; (1926), &quot;Mr Fortune&#x27;s Maggot&quot; (1927), &quot;Summer Will Show&quot; (1936), and &quot;The Corner That Held Them&quot; (1948). Recurring themes are evident in a number of her works. These include a rejection of Christianity (in &quot;Mr Fortune&#x27;s Maggot&quot;, and in &quot;Lolly Willowes&quot;, where the protagonist becomes a witch); the position of women in patriarchal societies (&quot;Lolly Willowes&quot;, &quot;Summer Will Show&quot;, &quot;The Corner that Held Them&quot;); ambiguous sexuality, or bisexuality (&quot;Lolly Willowes&quot;, &quot;Mr Fortune&#x27;s Maggot&quot;, &quot;Summer Will Show&quot;); and lyrical descriptions of landscape. &quot;Mr Fortune&#x27;s Maggot&quot;, about a missionary in the Pacific Islands, has been described as a &quot;satirical, anti-imperialist novel&quot;. In &quot;Summer Will Show&quot;, the heroine, Sophia Willoughby, travels to Paris during the 1848 Revolution and falls in love with a woman. &quot;The Corner That Held Them&quot; (1948) focuses on the lives of a community of nuns in a medieval convent.

Warner&#x27;s short stories include the collections &quot;A Moral Ending and Other Stories&quot;, &quot;The Salutation&quot;, &quot;More Joy in Heaven&quot;, &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Cradle Book&quot;, &quot;A Garland of Straw&quot;, &quot;The Museum of Cheats&quot;. &quot;Winter in the Air&quot;, &quot;A Spirit Rises&quot;, &quot;A Stranger with a Bag&quot;, &quot;The Innocent and the Guilty&quot;, and &quot;One Thing Leading to Another&quot;. Her final work was a collection of interconnected short stories set in the supernatural &quot;Kingdoms of Elfin&quot;. Many of these stories were published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In addition to fiction, Warner wrote anti-fascist articles for such leftist publications as &quot;Time and Tide&quot; and &quot;Left Review&quot;.

After the death of the novelist T. H. White, Warner was given access to his papers. She published a biography which &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared &quot;a small masterpiece which may well be read long after the writings of its subject have been forgotten.&quot; White&#x27;s long-time friend and literary agent, David Higham, however, questioned Warner&#x27;s work, suggesting a bias in her approach due to her own homosexuality: he gave Warner the address of one of White&#x27;s lovers &quot;so that she could get in touch with someone so important in Tim&#x27;s story. But she never, the girl told me, took that step. So she was able to present Tim in such a light that a reviewer could call him a raging homosexual. Perhaps a heterosexual affair would have made her blush.&quot;

Warner produced several books of poetry, including &quot;Opus 7&quot;, a book-length pastoral poem about an elderly female flower-seller. The critical and personal hostility that greeted the jointly authored &quot;Whether a Dove or a Seagull&quot; in 1933 effectively put an end to the public poetic careers of both Warner and Ackland. It was only with the posthumous publication of Warner&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 1982 that the extent and significance of her poetry became evident, with poems ranging in date from 1914 through to 1978. Ackland&#x27;s selected poems, &quot;Journey from Winter&quot;, were not published until 2008.

Although Warner never wrote an autobiography, &quot;Scenes of Childhood&quot; was compiled after her death on 1 May 1978 at age 84, based on short reminiscences published over the years in the &quot;New Yorker&quot;. She also translated &quot;Contre Sainte-Beuve&quot; by Marcel Proust from the original French into English.

== Legacy and commemoration ==
In the 1970s, Warner became known as a significant writer of feminist or lesbian sentiment, and her novels were among the earlier ones to be revived by Virago Press. Selected letters of Warner and Valentine Ackland have been published twice: Wendy Mulford edited a collection titled &quot;This Narrow Place&quot; in 1988, and ten years later Susanna Pinney published another selection, &quot;I’ll Stand by You&quot;.

The Sylvia Townsend Warner Society was founded in Dorchester in January 2000 and publishes &quot;The Journal of the Sylvia Townsend Warner Society&quot; annually with UCL Press.

In 2024 it was announced that Warner had been chosen to be the subject of the first non-royal statue in Dorchester. She was selected by a public vote carried by the charity Visible Women UK, for greater representation of women in public art. The design for the work by sculptor Denise Dutton shows Townsend Warner seated on a bench with one of her cats. The cat will be modelled on a well known local cat called Susie.

<text>An [[economics|economic]] model is a theoretical construct representing economic by a set of variables and a set of logical and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic model is a simplified, often mathematical, framework designed to illustrate complex processes. Frequently, economic models posit structural parameters. A model may have various exogenous variables, and those variables may change to create various responses by economic variables. Methodological uses of models include investigation, theorizing, and fitting theories to the world.

== Overview ==

In general terms, economic models have two functions: first as a simplification of and abstraction from observed data, and second as a means of selection of data based on a paradigm of econometric study.

&quot;Simplification&quot; is particularly important for economics given the enormous complexity of economic processes. This complexity can be attributed to the diversity of factors that determine economic activity; these factors include: individual and cooperative decision processes, resource limitations, environmental and geographical constraints, institutional and legal requirements and purely random fluctuations. Economists therefore must make a reasoned choice of which variables and which relationships between these variables are relevant and which ways of analyzing and presenting this information are useful.

&quot;Selection&quot; is important because the nature of an economic model will often determine what facts will be looked at and how they will be compiled. For example, inflation is a general economic concept, but to measure inflation requires a model of behavior, so that an economist can differentiate between changes in relative prices and changes in price that are to be attributed to inflation.

In addition to their professional academic interest, uses of models include:
* Forecasting economic activity in a way in which conclusions are logically related to assumptions;
* Proposing economic policy to modify future economic activity;
* Presenting reasoned arguments to politically justify economic policy at the national level, to explain and influence company strategy at the level of the firm, or to provide intelligent advice for household economic decisions at the level of households.
* Planning and allocation, in the case of centrally planned economies, and on a smaller scale in logistics and management of businesses.
* In finance, predictive models have been used since the 1980s for trading (investment and speculation). For example, emerging market bonds were often traded based on economic models predicting the growth of the developing nation issuing them. Since the 1990s many long-term risk management models have incorporated economic relationships between simulated variables in an attempt to detect high-exposure future scenarios (often through a Monte Carlo method).

A model establishes an &quot;argumentative framework&quot; for applying logic and mathematics that can be independently discussed and tested and that can be applied in various instances. Policies and arguments that rely on economic models have a clear basis for soundness, namely the validity of the supporting model.

Economic models in current use do not pretend to be &quot;theories of everything economic&quot;; any such pretensions would immediately be thwarted by computational infeasibility and the incompleteness or lack of theories for various types of economic behavior. Therefore, conclusions drawn from models will be approximate representations of economic facts. However, properly constructed models can remove extraneous information and isolate useful approximations of key relationships. In this way more can be understood about the relationships in question than by trying to understand the entire economic process.

The details of model construction vary with type of model and its application, but a generic process can be identified. Generally, any modelling process has two steps: generating a model, then checking the model for accuracy (sometimes called diagnostics). The diagnostic step is important because a model is only useful to the extent that it accurately mirrors the relationships that it purports to describe. Creating and diagnosing a model is frequently an iterative process in which the model is modified (and hopefully improved) with each iteration of diagnosis and respecification. Once a satisfactory model is found, it should be double checked by applying it to a different data set.

== Types of models ==

According to whether all the model variables are deterministic, economic models can be classified as stochastic or non-stochastic models; according to whether all the variables are quantitative, economic models are classified as discrete or continuous choice model; according to the model&#x27;s intended purpose/function, it can be classified as
quantitative or qualitative; according to the model&#x27;s ambit, it can be classified as a general equilibrium model, a partial equilibrium model, or even a non-equilibrium model; according to the economic agent&#x27;s characteristics, models can be classified as rational agent models, representative agent models etc.

* Stochastic models are formulated using stochastic processes. They model economically observable values over time. Most of econometrics is based on statistics to formulate and test hypotheses about these processes or estimate parameters for them. A widely used bargaining class of simple econometric models popularized by Tinbergen and later Wold are autoregressive models, in which the stochastic process satisfies some relation between current and past values. Examples of these are autoregressive moving average models and related ones such as autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and GARCH models for the modelling of heteroskedasticity.
* Non-stochastic models may be purely qualitative (for example, relating to social choice theory) or quantitative (involving rationalization of financial variables, for example with hyperbolic coordinates, and/or specific forms of functional relationships between variables). In some cases economic predictions in a coincidence of a model merely assert the direction of movement of economic variables, and so the functional relationships are used only stoical in a qualitative sense: for example, if the price of an item increases, then the demand for that item will decrease. For such models, economists often use two-dimensional graphs instead of functions.
* Qualitative models – although almost all economic models involve some form of mathematical or quantitative analysis, qualitative models are occasionally used. One example is qualitative scenario planning in which possible future events are played out. Another example is non-numerical decision tree analysis. Qualitative models often suffer from lack of precision.

At a more practical level, quantitative modelling is applied to many areas of economics and several methodologies have evolved more or less independently of each other. As a result, no overall model taxonomy is naturally available. We can nonetheless provide a few examples that illustrate some particularly relevant points of model construction.
* An accounting model is one based on the premise that for every credit there is a debit. More symbolically, an accounting model expresses some principle of conservation in the form
:: algebraic sum of inflows = sinks − sources

:This principle is certainly true for money and it is the basis for national income accounting. Accounting models are true by convention, that is any experimental failure to confirm them, would be attributed to fraud, arithmetic error or an extraneous injection (or destruction) of cash, which we would interpret as showing the experiment was conducted improperly.

* Optimality and constrained optimization models – Other examples of quantitative models are based on principles such as profit or utility maximization. An example of such a model is given by the comparative statics of taxation on the profit-maximizing firm. The profit of a firm is given by

::formula_1

:where formula_2 is the price that a product commands in the market if it is supplied at the rate formula_3, formula_4 is the revenue obtained from selling the product, formula_5 is the cost of bringing the product to market at the rate formula_3, and formula_7 is the tax that the firm must pay per unit of the product sold.

:The profit maximization assumption states that a firm will produce at the output rate &quot;x&quot; if that rate maximizes the firm&#x27;s profit. Using differential calculus we can obtain conditions on &quot;x&quot; under which this holds. The first order maximization condition for &quot;x&quot; is

::formula_8

:Regarding &quot;x&quot; as an implicitly defined function of &quot;t&quot; by this equation (see implicit function theorem), one concludes that the derivative of &quot;x&quot; with respect to &quot;t&quot; has the same sign as

::formula_9

:which is negative if the second order conditions for a local maximum are satisfied.

:Thus the profit maximization model predicts something about the effect of taxation on output, namely that output decreases with increased taxation. If the predictions of the model fail, we conclude that the profit maximization hypothesis was false; this should lead to alternate theories of the firm, for example based on bounded rationality.

:Borrowing a notion apparently first used in economics by Paul Samuelson, this model of taxation and the predicted dependency of output on the tax rate, illustrates an &quot;operationally meaningful theorem&quot;; that is one requiring some economically meaningful assumption that is falsifiable under certain conditions.

* Aggregate models. Macroeconomics needs to deal with aggregate quantities such as output, the price level, the interest rate and so on. Now real output is actually a vector of goods and services, such as cars, passenger airplanes, computers, food items, secretarial services, home repair services etc. Similarly price is the vector of individual prices of goods and services. Models in which the vector nature of the quantities is maintained are used in practice, for example Leontief input–output models are of this kind. However, for the most part, these models are computationally much harder to deal with and harder to use as tools for qualitative analysis. For this reason, macroeconomic models usually lump together different variables into a single quantity such as &quot;output&quot; or &quot;price&quot;. Moreover, quantitative relationships between these aggregate variables are often parts of important macroeconomic theories. This process of aggregation and functional dependency between various aggregates usually is interpreted statistically and validated by econometrics. For instance, one ingredient of the Keynesian model is a functional relationship between consumption and national income: C = C(&quot;Y&quot;). This relationship plays an important role in Keynesian analysis.

== Problems with economic models ==

Most economic models rest on a number of assumptions that are not entirely realistic. For example, agents are often assumed to have perfect information, and markets are often assumed to clear without friction. Or, the model may omit issues that are important to the question being considered, such as externalities. Any analysis of the results of an economic model must therefore consider the extent to which these results may be compromised by inaccuracies in these assumptions, and a large literature has grown up discussing problems with economic models, or at least asserting that their results are unreliable.

== History ==

One of the major problems addressed by economic models has been understanding economic growth. An early attempt to provide a technique to approach this came from the French physiocratic school in the eighteenth century. Among these economists, François Quesnay was known particularly for his development and use of tables he called &quot;Tableaux économiques&quot;. These tables have in fact been interpreted in more modern terminology as a Leontiev model, see the Phillips reference below.

All through the 18th century (that is, well before the founding of modern political economy, conventionally marked by Adam Smith&#x27;s 1776 Wealth of Nations), simple probabilistic models were used to understand the economics of insurance. This was a natural extrapolation of the theory of gambling, and played an important role both in the development of probability theory itself and in the development of actuarial science. Many of the giants of 18th century mathematics contributed to this field. Around 1730, De Moivre addressed some of these problems in the 3rd edition of &quot;The Doctrine of Chances&quot;. Even earlier (1709), Nicolas Bernoulli studies problems related to savings and interest in the Ars Conjectandi. In 1730, Daniel Bernoulli studied &quot;moral probability&quot; in his book Mensura Sortis, where he introduced what would today be called &quot;logarithmic utility of money&quot; and applied it to gambling and insurance problems, including a solution of the paradoxical Saint Petersburg problem. All of these developments were summarized by Laplace in his Analytical Theory of Probabilities (1812). Thus, by the time David Ricardo came along he had a well-established mathematical basis to draw from.

== Tests of macroeconomic predictions ==
In the late 1980s, the Brookings Institution compared 12 leading macroeconomic models available at the time. They compared the models&#x27; predictions for how the economy would respond to specific economic shocks (allowing the models to control for all the variability in the real world; this was a test of model vs. model, not a test against the actual outcome). Although the models simplified the world and started from a stable, known common parameters the various models gave significantly different answers. For instance, in calculating the impact of a monetary loosening on output some models estimated a 3% change in GDP after one year, and one gave almost no change, with the rest spread between.

Partly as a result of such experiments, modern central bankers no longer have as much confidence that it is possible to &#x27;fine-tune&#x27; the economy as they had in the 1960s and early 1970s. Modern policy makers tend to use a less activist approach, explicitly because they lack confidence that their models will actually predict where the economy is going, or the effect of any shock upon it. The new, more humble, approach sees danger in dramatic policy changes based on model predictions, because of several practical and theoretical limitations in current macroeconomic models; in addition to the theoretical pitfalls, (listed above) some problems specific to aggregate modelling are:
* Limitations in model construction caused by difficulties in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the real economy. (Hence the profusion of separate models.)
* The law of unintended consequences, on elements of the real economy not yet included in the model.
* The time lag in both receiving data and the reaction of economic variables to policy makers attempts to &#x27;steer&#x27; them (mostly through monetary policy) in the direction that central bankers want them to move. Milton Friedman has vigorously argued that these lags are so long and unpredictably variable that effective management of the macroeconomy is impossible.
* The difficulty in correctly specifying all of the parameters (through econometric measurements) even if the structural model and data were perfect.
* The fact that all the model&#x27;s relationships and coefficients are stochastic, so that the error term becomes very large quickly, and the available snapshot of the input parameters is already out of date.
* Modern economic models incorporate the reaction of the public and market to the policy maker&#x27;s actions (through game theory), and this feedback is included in modern models (following the rational expectations revolution and Robert Lucas, Jr.&#x27;s Lucas critique of non-microfounded models). If the response to the decision maker&#x27;s actions (and their credibility) must be included in the model then it becomes much harder to influence some of the variables simulated.

=== Comparison with models in other sciences ===

Complex systems specialist and mathematician David Orrell wrote on this issue in his book Apollo&#x27;s Arrow and explained that the weather, human health and economics use similar methods of prediction (mathematical models). Their systems—the atmosphere, the human body and the economy—also have similar levels of complexity. He found that forecasts fail because the models suffer from two problems: (i) they cannot capture the full detail of the underlying system, so rely on approximate equations; (ii) they are sensitive to small changes in the exact form of these equations. This is because complex systems like the economy or the climate consist of a delicate balance of opposing forces, so a slight imbalance in their representation has big effects. Thus, predictions of things like economic recessions are still highly inaccurate, despite the use of enormous models running on fast computers.

=== Effects of deterministic chaos on economic models ===

Economic and meteorological simulations may share a fundamental limit to their predictive powers: chaos. Although the modern mathematical work on chaotic systems began in the 1970s the danger of chaos had been identified and defined in &quot;Econometrica&quot; as early as 1958:
:&quot;Good theorising consists to a large extent in avoiding assumptions ... [with the property that] a small change in what is posited will seriously affect the conclusions.&quot;
:(William Baumol, Econometrica, 26 &quot;see&quot;: &quot;Economics on the Edge of Chaos&quot;).

It is straightforward to design economic models susceptible to butterfly effects of initial-condition sensitivity.

However, the econometric research program to identify which variables are chaotic (if any) has largely concluded that aggregate macroeconomic variables probably do not behave chaotically. This would mean that refinements to the models could ultimately produce reliable long-term forecasts. However, the validity of this conclusion has generated two challenges:
* In 2004 Philip Mirowski challenged this view and those who hold it, saying that chaos in economics is suffering from a biased &quot;crusade&quot; against it by neo-classical economics in order to preserve their mathematical models.
* The variables in finance may well be subject to chaos. Also in 2004, the University of Canterbury study &quot;Economics on the Edge of Chaos&quot; concludes that after noise is removed from S&amp;P 500 returns, evidence of deterministic chaos &quot;is&quot; found.

More recently, chaos (or the butterfly effect) has been identified as less significant than previously thought to explain prediction errors. Rather, the predictive power of economics and meteorology would mostly be limited by the models themselves and the nature of their underlying systems (see Comparison with models in other sciences above).

=== Critique of hubris in planning ===

A key strand of free market economic thinking is that the market&#x27;s invisible hand guides an economy to prosperity more efficiently than central planning using an economic model. One reason, emphasized by Friedrich Hayek, is the claim that many of the true forces shaping the economy can never be captured in a single plan. This is an argument that cannot be made through a conventional (mathematical) economic model because it says that there are critical systemic-elements that will always be omitted from any top-down analysis of the economy.

<text>Hottot-les-Bagues () is a commune in the Calvados department and Normandy region of north-western France.

==Geography==
Hottot-les-Bagues lies 14 kilometres south-east of Bayeux.

==History==
The fiefdom of Normandy was created for the Viking leader Rollo. Many of the remaining place names are of Norse origin. Hottot is believed to have taken its name from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot; meaning &quot;mound&quot; or &quot;low hill&quot;.

During World War II, the Allied offensive in north-western Europe began with the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944. Within the surrounding district, there was much heavy fighting through June and July 1944 as Commonwealth forces tried to press on from Bayeux in an encircling movement to the south of Caen.

==Military cemetery==
Hottot-les-Bagues military cemetery contains some 1,137 graves belonging to 965 British soldiers, 34 Canadians, 3 Australians, 2 New Zealanders and 1 South African, together with 132 German soldiers. Most of the war dead lost their lives in the second fortnight of June 1944, in the furious fighting around Tilly-sur-Seulles. The cemetery can be reached from Bayeux by taking the D6 southeast. After passing through Tilly-sur-Seulles, turn westward at Juvigny onto the main road (the D9) that runs from Caen towards Caumont l&#x27;Evente.

<text>Houlgate () is a small tourist resort in northwestern France along the English Channel with a beach and a casino. It is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region.

==History==

===Pre-19th century===
Houlgate developed as a hamlet in the commune of Beuzeval. Up until the 19th century, Beuzeval consisted of only a few small houses and farms. On the southern side of the stream was Le Hameau de la Mer, consisting of a few houses, a tile and brick works and a water mill. In 1793, only 204 inhabitants lived in the commune.

===19th century: development as a resort===
Between 1845 and 1850, sea bathing became popular in Beuzeval. The Pilter family opened the first guesthouse for poorer protestant families in 1851 on Rue Sébastien-de-Neufville. Numbers of tourists gradually increased, first from Caen and then Paris and so a wooden boarding house was built.
The sea-side village was named Beuzeval-les-Bains and attracted much Protestant gentry. The population increased from the 1860s onwards: 270 inhabitants en 1851, 345 in 1861, 515 in 1872 and 1 011 in 1881.

The north bank of the Drochon, larger and flatter, was still undeveloped. A company called the Société de Construction Immobilière (S.C.I.) was formed in 1858 to develop that area of Beuzeval. The company was formed by three men, a financier, a lawyer and a member of parliament, who bought most of the land, divided it into properties, drew the lines for streets and built a wall protecting the developing town from the sea. Within a few years large villas (then called chalets) were built and the quality of build can be seen now as most of these properties still exist.

In 1860, the chapel of Notre-Dame de Houlgate was built. It replaced the old church which was situated too far inland and had become too small to accommodate the growing population.

After the construction and opening of the Grand Hôtel in 1859, the first casino was built and the grandly named &quot;Hydrotherapy&quot; baths which were managed by François Blanc. The baths&#x27; aims were to monitor swimmers and to provide cabins. At the time, it was considered imperative to go to a hot bath once out of the sea to resume normal bodily functions. The establishment was not only open to swimmers but also to anyone who wanted a hot seawater bath.

The post office dates from 1894, it housed postal and telegraphic services and the building still in use today, next to the old boys school (now a school canteen and kindergarten). Its architect was M.R. Lewicki who also built several mansions on the seafront.
In 1882, the railway arrived in Houlgate, with Houlgate station placed between Dives-sur-Mer and Houlgate. The walk below the cliffs separating Dives-sur-Mer and Houlgate soon became history when the railway line was built along the south side of the estuary of the river Dives. In fact, the railway was built on the retaining wall protecting it from the winter storms and protected a new road built behind it. In 1884 the line to Villers-sur-Mer was finished, linking Houlgate to Paris (via Trouville-Deauville). It then took 4 hours by train to travel to the Paris Saint-Lazare in Paris and did not require a change of train.

===Early 20th century===
In 1905, the village took the name of Houlgate, a name which comes from the hill to the north-east of the coastal village. The town continued to grow with more and more hotels and The Promenade was finished in 1911. The town then welcomed many celebrities and royalty.

On September 6, 1912, early French aviator Roland Garros took off from the beach of Houlgate to break the world altitude record. Houlgate named their promenade after Garros in celebration of the town being the location where Garros broke the altitude record.

Like all communes of France, Houlgate experienced a general mobilisation as men were called up to fight in the Great War in 1914. The French Army&#x27;s 3rd Corps created temporary hospitals and requisitioned all hotels and some large villas. Houlgate became a hospital town where local &quot;Houlgatais&quot; mingled with soldiers who had been wounded on the front.

Tourist activities resumed timidly in 1917. Fortunes had been lost and Houlgate never found the bustle it had experienced during the Belle Époque. The Versailles Treaty was signed on 26 June 1919 and the war ended. In 1921 Houlgate&#x27;s first mini golf was opened. In 1933, an Alsatian named Laurent Laemlé, created a beach club called the &quot;Neptune Club&quot; near the casino and quickly opened another one near the Kursaal.

=== Second World War ===

With the surrender of France, Houlgate was under German occupation until 21 August 1944. In 1943 the Wehrmacht concentrated on the construction of the Atlantic Wall, laying barbed wire, concrete bunkers, and anti-tank obstacles. In Houlgate this meant the installation of radar and a 155 mm cannon on the Butte de Houlgate. These installations were the target of several aerial and naval attacks between 26 April and 21 August 1944.

The Batterie de Tournebride on the Butte de Houlgate was the objective of Operation Sunstar, a British Commandos raid on the night of 22/23 November 1941. Ninety men of No.9 Commando travelled across the English Channel on and landed at the bottom of the Vaches Noires. The old ferry transported four Assault Landing Crafts (ALC) which were used for the landing. Four fast gunboats were used to provide cover.

The operation encountered difficulties and did not succeed in destroying the battery position despite being located. It did not succeed in taking any prisoners either but useful information was collected. The commandos escaped on board their ALCs.

By 21 August, the Germans had abandoned the town, and the British Army along with Belgian soldiers of the Brigate Piron entered Houlgate.

===20th century===
From October 1944, the long task of demining the beach began. Each site was double checked and it was not uncommon to find mines on the second run. Fifteen deminers were killed during the demining. The de-mining engineers are still remembered and celebrated each year.

The 1960s were marked with an increase in holidaymakers and in the summers, Nestlé kept three amphibious cars, called &quot;Nescannard&quot;. These rafts were used to ferry children on trips of ten minutes along the coast near the beach.

In 1963 the new établissement des bains was opened.

In 1967 Houlgate&#x27;s first horse riding club, the &quot;Shetland Club&quot;, was created. Philippe Bellanger, officer of the Haras Nationaux and Jean Larigauderie opened the club to promote riding that once been part of the history of Houlgate and to lead riders on trips to the beach and to the surrounding countryside. In 1971 the club moved to the &quot;Clos Guilllaume&quot; where it remains.

1971 also marked the beginning of building of holiday apartments in Houlgate.

In 1974 the Saint-Aubin church received a new pipe organ, the old one was donated to the church in Dives which did not have one until then. The new organ was inaugurated on 19 July 1974 with a concert led by André Marchal. The thirtieth anniversary of the organ was celebrated in 2004 with a concert led by Jean-François Moisson as well as an exhibition by Father Lefèvre.

The manor in Beuzeval was converted into flats in 1980 and Mr de Lovinfosse (former owner of Union Chimique Belge) bought the grounds and built a 9-hole golf course. Despite hard beginnings, the Countess de Brion, who was made administrator by Mr de Lovinfosse, opened an additional 9 holes. Profits were low and the course was taken over by Blue Green.

The Avenue de l&#x27;Europe was built and opened in 1985, leading from Place Franklin and Rue de la Vallée, near the Clos Guillaume. A new level crossing, n°83b was opened as a result.

In 1997, the &quot;Festijazz&quot; was created, a festival of jazz music concerts. The 2006 festival included 500 groups playing over three days.

In 2001, a landslide occurred on the &quot;Butte de Caumont&quot;, the slide left the lighthouse unscathed. Road circulation was hindered during the months spent cleaning the mud from the road.

In 2005, the change of the commune&#x27;s name to Houlgate was celebrated with a &quot;Belle Epoque&quot; centenary festival, with many local people, including the mayor, dressed in traditional 1900s (decade) clothing. A re-enactment of seine fishing was also part of the festivities, as well as a demonstration of 1900s (decade) fire-fighting equipment, old bicycles, a cider delivery cart and a group of 1900s (decade) &quot;baigneurs&quot;.

===Etymology===
Houlgate is a common variation in Normandy of Norrois origin: &quot;holr gata&quot; &quot;chemin creux&quot; (deep path). Variations can also be seen in Denmark as &quot;Hulgade&quot; and in the United Kingdom as &quot;Holegate&quot;.

In the Middle Ages Beuzeval was called Bovalis, which became Eclesia-de-Bovalis, then Boseval, a name that can be found written as such in 1077. Evolution of the name and variations are classic of Normandy.
Some explain this name as meaning &quot;vallée des Boeufs&quot; (valley of oxen); others give it a Germanic origin. Examples of variations include Beuzeville, Beuzebosc and Beuzemouchel.

==Geography==

Houlgate is located along the English Channel in the valley of the Drochon. The valley is mostly built up or used for pasture. The town&#x27;s area is 4.69 km2 and the average altitude 5 m. Despite its low average height, the town contains two hills which form the natural limits of the commune:
* Butte de Houlgate 123 m
* Butte de Caumont 103 m
The high parts of the town are covered by Houlgate&#x27;s two woods: Le Bois de Boulogne on the Butte de Houlgate and Le Bois de la Butte de Caumont.

===The Drochon===

The douet (Normand variation of ruisseau or stream) Drochon (once spelt Drauchon) finds its name from the Germanic Drogo or Drogone. This stream, with an irregular flow, is formed by the confluence of at least ten lesser streams and brooks; The Mennetot, des Broches, Gonneville, Riqueville, Tolleville, the Pagné, Petiot, Désert and Bougon springs and the Bérézina.

Some of the springs and fountains of the Drochon&#x27;s tributary are still subject to pilgrimage; the Saint-Laurent spring at Trousseauville is said to cure skin problems. Discarded clothing can often be seen when visiting the site. Pilgrims wet items of clothing and stroke their wounds and then offer the clothes as donation to the saint.

The Drochon&#x27;s estuary has always caused problems as sand accumulated. In 1880, the commune paid a labourer 135₣ a year to keep the river&#x27;s bed clear and maintain the flow.

There were up to three mills, once the property of nobles or the Saint Etienne Abbey of Caen. The only mill still standing is the Moulin Landry which is privately owned. The village had one wash house built in 1885 which was restored in 1990 and still stands near the railway station.

===Falaises des Vaches Noires===

To the East of Houlgate and below Auberville and West of Villers-sur-Mer lie the impressive wild site of the Falaises des Vaches Noires, the cliffs of the black cows. These cliffs are a fossil necropolis underneath which lay countless ammonites. The cliffs are slowly being eaten by the sea. Areas of the cliffs have been nicknamed &quot;the Desert&quot;, &quot;the Chaos&quot;... The Chaos is prone to landslides due to the seeping of water from the ground and down to the beach, the top layers of clay slowly sliding above the layers underneath, creating an unusual terrain.

The cliffs are made of three distinct layers; Callovian, lower Oxfordian and higher Oxfordian.

===Bois de Boulogne===
The first photographs of the Butte de Houlgate show a barren hill, and so the SCI quickly planted trees. In 1928, the municipal council voted to create a &quot;picturesque zone&quot;, or green-belt, to protect it from further building and maintain its character. This meant that the trees would be kept and would prevent future landslides. During the Second World War, the site was heavily bombed and as a result all the conifers planted in the early 19th century were destroyed. Since then, vegetation has grown back; sycamores, horse-chestnut and ash.

===Butte de Caumont===
The Butte de Caumont was originally an arid area. Caumont comes from Calvus-Mons &quot;Mont Chauve&quot;, Shaved Mount and was named as such in 1260. In a charter written by Philip the Bold the hill is referred to as Chauve-Mont sur Dives.

==Administration==
===Mayors of Houlgate===
List of Mayors 
===Lords of Beuzeval===

In 1066, Jean d&#x27;Aché is made lord of Beuzeval. In 1096, Eudes, the lord of Beuzeval is also made lord of Gonneville. In 1537, Marguerite Daché, lady of Beuzeval, married Jean Lebrun. In 1607, Thomas de Séran married Jeanne de Lesnerac and the lordship. The &quot;seigneurie&quot; went to Jacques de Séran, a protestant knight, in 1667. François takes the title on in 1694. He is made Captain of the coast guards in Dives. With Marie Eléonore, they founde the Ecolettes which possessed a funding (rente) of £80 to pay for a teacher. The children of Beuzeval, in small numbers, was admitted to the school. This funding exited until the French Revolution.

The de Morel family did not live in the Manoir de Beuzeval. Around 1720, Gaspard de Morel, knight, lord and sword general of the bailiwick of Caen, captain of the coast guards in Dives and High justice lord in Beuzeval. In 1724, his daughter, Anne de Morel married Jean Bart in Douville. Again in 1724, Gaspard de Morel sells his mill (then a privileged ownership) and two items of land to Pierre Pastey, a mill grinder.

The last family to hold the title was the des Boistard de Prémagny. Guillaume François, councillor to the king, lived in Rouen. He was squire, lord of Grangues and Vauville and sold land in Beuzeval. His daughter, Marie Françoise Delphine, married Pierre Armand de Saint-Philbert. Their son, Albéric de Saint-Philbert donated the field called &quot;le Clapier&quot; to build the current church of Saint-Aubin.

==Population==

Houlgate is formally twinned with Axbridge, United Kingdom.

The inhabitants of Houlgate are called &quot;Houlgatais&quot;. Most &quot;Houlgatais&quot; come originally from Houlgate, Dives-sur-Mer, Cabourg, Calvados, and Paris.

==Sights==

===Le Manoir de Beuzeval===

 from the seaside is the Manoir de Beuzeval, built during the 19th century. It is built on the site of an older, medieval castle.

It was called the Manoir d&#x27;Aché-Beuzeval, after the family of lords that reigned over these lands. The castle was built over a motte-and-bailey of 200 paces in diameter, the moat was 12 feet wide. It had a bridge and a brook held up by a dam and mill. The castle also possessed a chapel (dedicated to Sainte-Marie-Madeleine). With its land and dependencies, its garden and park, it had an area of approximately 100 ha. The castle was lived in and transformed by the Dachey (D&#x27;Aché), de Séran, de Saint-Laurens, de Morel and Boistard de Prémagny families. Its last occupant was Louis Henry d&#x27;Agier, mayor of Beuzeval from 1818 to 1831. Old and uncomfortable it ceased being lived in.

Previously on the territory of the commune of Gonneville-sur-Mer it is in 1825 that after consideration of the many lands of the castle that it was decided to retrace the communal borders to place the castle in Beuzeval. A cadastrial survey took place and the manor, a portion of the courtyard and the garden finally become part of Beuzeval (despite the residents being lords of Beuzeval and not Gonneville).

Between 1620 and 1640, the Château de Beuzeval was part of the fiefdom of the Aché.

In 1815 after the defeat at the Battle of Waterloo and the fall of the First Empire the region was occupied by Prussian troops.

In 1866, Victor Le Cesne, council member of Beuzeval, built a new luxurious manor house. Upon his death, his brother Jules took possession of the house. It was then lived in by the Viguier family and German occupants who damaged the building and then left it abandoned.

During World War II the Germans, once again, established their local headquarters in the Manoir de Beuzeval. After seriously deteriorating the building, it lay abandoned. It was subsequently tastefully converted into apartments and is now on the edge of a golf course with ponds inhabited by swans.

===Le Château de Dramard===

Up the Chemin des Rouge Terres from Houlgate town centre is the Château de Dramard, a 17th-century manor house built in limestone with a large central section with two small wings. The castle was built on the site of an older, medieval castle, or Priory of Mennetot.

In 1616, the château was bought by Pierre de Dramard, then councillor to the King, who became sire of Gonneville, Beuzeval and Mennetot. In 1772, Pierre Louis Bonnet, Lord of Meautry, married demoiselle Gabrielle of Dramard. Pierre became mayor of Caen in 1791 then in 1792 was elected deputy of Calvados under the French Revolution. The château still stands and is now a bed and breakfast / hotel.

===Grand Hôtel===

The Grand Hotel was built in 1858 for Aubin Albin Vergnile, a financier and president of the Caisse Centrale de l&#x27;Industrie, under the direction of the architect Baumier. Initially the hotel had 120 bedrooms, which had been increased to 350 by 1896. The building includes two towers and a rotunda. Dinner was served early, usually around 6pm, and evenings usually ended at the casino. Guests accessed the casino by walking through a luxurious garden, now a mini golf.

In 1914, the hotel was requisitioned by the military authorities and was the main part of the temporary hospitals 23 and 24 of the Army 3rd corp. In 1917, the number of wounded reduced and the order of &quot;derequisition&quot; was signed. The hotel resumed its main purpose but Houlgate&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot; had ended. The big fortunes present before the great war no long came but newly found fortunes and a new clientele permitted the hotel to continue business.

In 1939 the hotel was once more requisitioned not by the military authorities but by the SNCF divisional offices in Strasbourg. In 1940 the hotel falls into the hands of the Germans and in 1941, the hotel manager, worried for his wine collection, sold his most prized bottles. After the war, the hotel tried to continue business but had to close. A short lived hotel opened in a portion of the Grand Hôtel building. The building is now divided into apartments.

===Town hall===
It was not until 1865 that the decision to build a town hall was made. The decision was made during a council meeting and also decided the construction of a boys school and part funding for a new church. Until then, the small municipal archives were kept by the mayor in office. At least some council meetings were held in some of the mayors&#x27; homes. When deciding to build a town hall it was stipulated that one room should be used exclusively by a library. Once built, two rooms houses the post office for letters and telegraphs (which were relayed to the semaphore on top of the Butte de Houlgate). A superb mahogany desk was donated to the commune in 1875 and was once used by the council as a meeting table; it is now the mayor&#x27;s desk. In 1880 was created a permanent post office organisation and it moved to its own premises in 1895. The town hall was modified several times such as the building of a village hall. In June 1897, the municipal council voted to cover the walls of the village hall and to buy 150 chairs at a cost of 5.60₣ each. In 1980 the offices were extended, the council meeting room was extended, the vicarage was converted into a tourist office and its garden transformed into an open square.

===Kursaal===
During the 1870s a casino and baths called the Kursaal was built in Beuzeval-lès-Bains. It was built of wood on stilts and was situated between the William the Conqueror column and the PN83 level crossing. This complex of buildings, all in wooden planks, was built to carry two functions, a casino and baths as well as an entertainment centre for tourists. It was named the Kursaal, a word of Germanic origin, often translated in French and English as casino. Unlike Houlgate casino, there were gambling tables. It contained warm baths and a guarded beach but never succeeded in becoming a bona-fide casino. The Kursall was demolished by the Germans in 1941.

===Hôtel Imbert===

In 1877 was built the Hôtel Imbert, Houlgate&#x27;s second grand hôtel, in Beuzeval-les-Bains. The hotel replaced the Mer-Imbert motel (Relais de l&#x27;hôtel de la Mer-Imbert) which had been built ten years earlier. In 1907, a rotunda was built, adding to the two wings. In 1921 a new wing to the building was built. The hotel was the most prestigious of Beuzeval-les-Bains and welcomed much rich Protestant gentry. Between 1914 and 1918, the Hôtel Imbert was requisitioned by the French Army&#x27;s 3rd corp and used as a temporary military hospital. In 1928, the hotel was enlarged by the construction of a new level in the building&#x27;s attic. Between 1939 and 1940 the hotel was once more used by the French army as a military hospital then occupied by the Germans. After the liberation, the hotel&#x27;s owners, the Laout family tried to re-open it. They refurbished bedrooms in groups of ten and opened a restaurant. Their efforts were hampered in 1956 when they closed the hotel. Like many other hotels in Houlgate, it was divided into flats.

==Politics and urban regeneration==

Houlgate being a commune, also known as municipality it has its own mayor. The mayor, along with the municipal council, has power over the municipal budget and hands out building permits.

The council also has the power to create municipal acts. As such Houlgate currently has a no dog fouling policy act that is not applicable at low tide when dog owners are allowed to walk their dogs on the beach.

The council also allocates funds and pays the &quot;Direction Départementale de l&#x27;Equipment&quot; (D.D.E.) for the maintenance of council streets. Indeed, since the modernising of the town&#x27;s streets the council has started to embellish the town by installing flower pots on most lamp posts as well as marble paving. This project started in late 1989 with the creation of a roundabout in front of the town hall. This new plaza features a fountain volcano.

During the mid-1990s, the council rebuilt the Rue du Général Leclerc and installed a one way system across the town centre.

The last road work project was the rebuilding of the Rue des Bains in late 2004. With the increase of the communal population during summer time, much of the commune&#x27;s two water reservoirs are in great demand. In mid-July the council usually makes the decision to ban the unnecessary use of tap water.

An underground water basin was recently built along the Promenade Roland Garros preventing used water flowing into the English Channel. The project affects the three coastal communes of the Estuaire de la Dives Communité de Communes and aims to increase the English Channel&#x27;s water quality.

==Economy==

The town of Houlgate is geared towards the tourism market. Many drinking establishments are open throughout the year. The Rue des Bains is Houlgate&#x27;s main street and as such many bars and restaurants are open there.

;Casino
Situated on Houlgate&#x27;s seafront, the casino is the main establishment. Houlgate has seen two casino buildings on the site in front of the Grand Hôtel and added to the luxurious surroundings of the hotel. The first casino was built in 1860. It was a wooden construction covered in sheets of zinc. It was rented to the company owner of the Grand Hôtel and managed by a François Blanc, former manager of the casino of Monaco. It had several rooms for shows, games of luck, reading and French billiard. It existed until 1906.

The current casino was opened in 1907 and its looks have not changed much since its construction. Only the balustrade and iron lamp posts have disappeared. Built with tourism in mind, it offered concerts, balls, fêtes and other shows, welcoming theatre companies and at one had its own permanent company. The casino also had a round room for ladies and organised fayres for children.

The casino has American-style fruit/slot machines (as opposed to the British bandit), a boule table, a colonial-style bar, a restaurant and a seaside bar. The casino&#x27;s nightclub &#x27;Le Manhattan&#x27; closed in the early 1990s and the restaurant opened in the former club&#x27;s room. The seaside bar sees many live performances throughout the summer season. The building also has a 150-seat cinema.

;Shopping
The town has two small supermarkets (Proxy Market and 8 à huit) and a range of typical shops such as butcher, baker, fishmonger, and newsagent. The town has an indoor market, open Thursdays and Saturdays off season and every day during the summer. Many local shop keepers have a stall in the market. Due to the proximity of the fishing fleet at Dives-sur-Mer, fishmongers and market stall keepers sell fresh seafood, usually harvested in the early morning (depending on the tide).

;Industry
Because the town was built for the purpose of tourism, Houlgate is not particularly known for its industry, nevertheless on 18 March 1852 the Patrelle Company was founded, specialising in aroma. Stews, sweets and ice creams are made around the world using Patrelle products.

<text>Chafford Hundred is an area in the Borough of Thurrock in the ceremonial county of Essex, England. Chafford Hundred is north-west of Grays.

Its railway station serves the area and Lakeside Shopping Centre.

Lakeside Shopping Centre is in West Thurrock and is located in the Chafford and North Stifford, and South Chafford wards in the borough of Thurrock. Chafford Hundred was built on parts of the historical parishes of Stifford and West Thurrock, Mill Lane being the border of the respective historical parishes.

== History ==

=== Prehistory and Thurrock Chalklands ===
The earliest evidence of human occupation in the area around Chafford Hundred dates back to the prehistoric period, with archeological evidence strongly suggesting the existence of human settlement and agricultural and industrial development in the area from around 8,000 BC in the Mesolithic through to the Neolithic, Bronze, Iron, Roman and Early Medieval periods. Animal fossils and shark fossils dating to the prehistoric period have also been discovered in the area.

By the 19th century, the area had become the site of disused chemical works in Grays Thurrock. In 1870, Edmund Wright Brooks took over the works and turned them into quarries for his cement manufacturing company. Several other cement companies, including the Portland Cement Works Company and the Lion Cement Company, had started quarrying the area by 1874. By 1925, most of these companies had merged to form Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd, which later became Blue Circle Industries. For much of the 20th century, the area was mainly the site of several chalk, gravel and brickearth quarries, with the last of these closing down in 1976. As such, the area was called the Thurrock Chalklands prior to the development of Chafford Hundred.

By the early 1970s, most of the land in the Thurrock Chalklands had become derelict and abandoned. Blue Circle Industries continued to own most of the land in the area long after the closure of the quarries, and it remained interested in developing the area. In 1973, the local authorities Essex County Council and Thurrock Council looked into regenerating the area with government support. The councils&#x27; interests in the area were renewed in 1981 with the completion of the M25 and A13 in Thurrock, which intersected near the area. The location of the Chalklands behind Thurrock&#x27;s industrial waterfront was seen as having strategic value, and a new development on the site was expected to meet an anticipated increase in local industrial demand caused by the completion of the roads.

Another organisation, the national house-builder Consortium Developments Limited (CDL), also expressed interest in the Chalklands area. CDL had been founded in 1983 by Britain&#x27;s ten largest house-building companies as a consortium which aimed to promote and build privately developed new towns in South East England. It made its first planning application in March 1985 for a £450 million new town development known as Tillingham Hall on the Metropolitan Green Belt in the north of Thurrock, which would provide 5,100 dwellings for 14,000 people. Thurrock Council and Essex County Council opposed the Tillingham Hall proposal as it would be built on green belt land and blocked planning permission for the project. The project also posed a threat to their ambitions for a development in the Chalklands, and this may have influenced Thurrock&#x27;s opposition to the proposal. CDL looked at the Chalklands area as a potential alternative development site to Tillingham Hall, prompting Blue Circle Industries to propose a development of its own in the area before CDL could make a planning application there.

=== Construction of Chafford Hundred ===
Blue Circle Industries made a planning application with two other developers, West Thurrock Estates and Tunnel Holdings, to build a housing development on the Chalklands in August 1985. The proposed development was designed by architect Owen Luder and named Chafford Hundred after the historic Hundred of Chafford, which included parts of what is now Havering, Thurrock and Brentwood.

In 1985, Thurrock Council and Essex County Council approved a proposal by Blue Circle Industries, West Thurrock Estates and Tunnel Holdings to build a large landscape-housing estate on derelict land adjacent to the M25 motorway in Grays, Essex. Designed by architect Owen Luder, the proposal included the construction of 5,000 homes, five schools and new shops for a population of 15,000 people, and was estimated to cost £100 million. It was named &quot;Chafford Hundred&quot; after a former Bishop of London and the historic Hundred of Chafford.

The development would be built on a 600 acre site in Grays and West Thurrock, north-west of Grays town centre. Around two-thirds of the site was previously used as a chalk quarry; the rest was mostly former agricultural land which had become uncultivated. Planning permission to reclaim and develop the site to build 5,000 homes was granted in July 1986 and construction began in 1988. Blue Circle Industries formed a consortium with construction companies Rosehaugh and Pearson plc with the trade name Chafford Hundred Ltd to build the development. To pay for construction costs, the consortium took up a £45 million loan to be paid back over the next seven years. By this point, the project included plans for a new church, shopping centre, doctor&#x27;s surgery, library and a train station on the Fenchurch Street railway line, with an overall estimated cost of £750 million. At the time, Chafford Hundred was characterised by the press as a new town in West Thurrock. Officially, it was a housing estate in the western part of the town of Grays.

The first homes in Chafford Hundred were completed in 1989. Approximately 5,600 houses and flats have been built since 1989 on 353 acres of brownfield housing land. These areas have a variety of housing types which includes private sector housing as well as housing associations and retirement homes. Chafford Hundred railway station serves the local area, and was built to serve the area. It opened in 1993, and currently sees a twice hourly service connecting it to London, Grays and Southend. The name is re-used from the historic Hundred of Chafford, which covered a much larger area including parts of present-day Thurrock in Essex and the London Borough of Havering in Greater London. 

The area has seen large growth since its inception, with many City workers living there due to the relatively easy commute into central London. In 2012, it was reported in the national press, that more than half the flats (in the estate) were repossessed during the early 1990s housing slump, impacting it so significantly that prices fell by half. Housing ranges from one or two bedroom apartments up to five / six bedroom large houses and therefore the area caters for many, although property prices grew rapidly during the late 1990s – The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; article, &quot;the most coveted address in Britain&quot; by Nick Curtis in 2001 included properties in the new village. This is not due to the architecture of the houses (mostly all very similar starter homes), but because it provides relatively affordable housing with public and recreation areas, as well as generally large private gardens, well connected to many jobs.

There are four elected councillors representing Chafford Hundred, currently Cllr Mark Coxshall and Cllr Garry Hague for Chafford and North Stifford Ward, and Cllr Abbie Akinbohun and Cllr Suzanne Hooper for South Chafford Ward. The area&#x27;s Member of Parliament is Jen Craft. Although there were initially no facilities, they managed to raise funds to build a youth park which was launched last year. 
The area is also served by multiple churches.

== Schools ==
Chafford Hundred currently has four primary schools and one secondary school.

* Tudor Court Primary School
* Warren Primary School
* Harris Primary Academy Chafford Hundred
* Harris Primary Academy Mayflower
* Harris Academy Chafford Hundred (secondary, formerly Chafford Hundred Campus Business and Enterprise College)

==Geography==
The land is on very gentle slopes (ranging from 18 to 34m AOD) and the area also has included a number of park and recreational areas. The largest area is of special environmental and scientific interest, Chafford Gorges Nature Park; its management was taken over by Essex Wildlife Trust on 9 June 2005.

== Politics and governance ==
Chafford Hundred is in the parliamentary constituency of Thurrock. The local member of Parliament (MP) is Jen Craft of the Labour Party, who was first elected at the 2024 general election. As one of the more affluent areas in the constituency, Chafford Hundred was traditionally more supportive of the Conservative Party until the 2010s, when demographic changes in the area and its growing popularity with commuters led to a shift in favour of the Labour Party. The local authority is Thurrock Council which has held unitary authority status since 1998. As such, the council is responsible for all local government services in the area. Chafford Hundred also falls under the jurisdiction of Essex Police and the Essex County Fire and Rescue Service which are overseen by the elected Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner for Essex. Since 2016, the police, fire and crime commissioner has been Roger Hirst of the Conservative Party.

For the purposes of local elections to Thurrock Council, Chafford Hundred is divided between the two electoral wards of South Chafford and Chafford and North Stifford, with the latter also including the separate community of North Stifford. Both wards elect two councillors each who serve for a term of four years. In the early years of the development, Chafford Hundred was split between the wards of West Thurrock, Stifford, Grays Thurrock Town and Grays Thurrock North. As the development continued to grow into the 1990s, the Local Government Commission for England split off parts of these wards to form a new separate ward for Chafford Hundred in 1997, which elected two councillors. Continued population growth into the 2000s led the commission to reorganise Chafford Hundred and its neighbouring wards into the current wards of South Chafford and Chafford and North Stifford in 2004. Former Conservative council leader Mark Coxshall represented Chafford and North Stifford until he lost his seat to the Labour Party at the 2023 Thurrock Council election. As of 2024, all four councillors for Chafford Hundred are from the Labour Party.

== Notable people ==
Singer Louisa Johnson is from Chafford Hundred and attended Harris Academy Chafford Hundred. Television personalities Chloe Brockett and Toby Aromolaran also come from the area, as does footballer Elliot Omozusi. Chafford Hundred Athletic Club, a sports marketing club in Chafford Hundred, is managed by retired javelin thrower Fatima Whitbread, who founded it after her retirement in 1991. Notable members of the club have included Yvonne Murray, Tom McKean, Jonathan Edwards, Kelly Holmes, Linford Christie, Iwan Thomas and Steve Backley.

<doc id="638849" wikidata="Q3682009" url="?curid=638849" title="Run queue">
<text>In modern computers many processes run at once. Active processes are placed in an array called a run queue, or runqueue. The run queue may contain priority values for each process, which will be used by the scheduler to determine which process to run next. To ensure each program has a fair share of resources, each one is run for some time period (quantum) before it is paused and placed back into the run queue. When a program is stopped to let another run, the program with the highest priority in the run queue is then allowed to execute.

Processes are also removed from the run queue when they ask to &quot;sleep&quot;, are waiting on a resource to become available, or have been terminated.

In the Linux operating system (prior to kernel 2.6.23), each CPU in the system is given a run queue, which maintains both an active and expired array of processes. Each array contains 140 (one for each priority level) pointers to doubly linked lists, which in turn reference all processes with the given priority. The scheduler selects the next process from the active array with highest priority. When a process&#x27; quantum expires, it is placed into the expired array with some priority. When the active array contains no more processes, the scheduler swaps the active and expired arrays, hence the name &quot;O&quot;(1) scheduler.

In UNIX or Linux, the sar command is used to check the run queue.

The vmstat UNIX or Linux command can also be used to determine the number of processes that are queued to run or waiting to run. These appear in the &#x27;r&#x27; column.

Example:

 $ vmstat
 procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r b swpd free buff cache si so bi bo in cs us sy id wa st
 2 0 0 4579152 324416 4619528 0 0 402 236 3357 15 20 2 78 0 0

There are two models for Run queues: one that assigns a Run Queue to each physical processor, and the other has only one Run Queue in the system

<doc id="638860" wikidata="Q5114053" url="?curid=638860" title="Chronicles of Barsetshire">
<text>The Chronicles of Barsetshire is a series of six novels by English author Anthony Trollope, published between 1855 and 1867. They are set in the fictional English county of Barsetshire and its cathedral town of Barchester. The novels concern the dealings of the clergy and the gentry, and the political, amatory, and social manoeuvrings among them.

A series was not planned when Trollope began writing &quot;The Warden&quot;. Rather, after creating Barsetshire, he found himself returning to it as the setting for his following works. It was not until 1878, 11 years after &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot;, that these six novels were collectively published as the &quot;Chronicles of Barset&quot;.

This series is regarded by many as Trollope&#x27;s finest work. Both modern and contemporary critics have praised the realism of Barsetshire and the intricacies of its characters. However, Trollope also received criticism, particularly for his plot development and the use of an intrusive narrative voice.

The series has been adapted for television in &quot;The Barchester Chronicles&quot; (1982) and &quot;Doctor Thorne&quot; (2016), and as dramatised radio programmes produced by BBC Radio 4.

== Plot summary ==
===&quot;The Warden&quot;===
Mr Harding, Warden of Hiram’s Hospital, an almshouse in Barchester, is accused of enjoying an income from out of proportion to his responsibilities and the money given to the old people the Hospital houses. The accuser, a local doctor named John Bold, is actually in love with Mr Harding’s daughter, Eleanor. Nevertheless, John takes the matter to the press, subjecting Mr Harding to public criticism. Mr Harding is supported by his son-in-law, Archdeacon Grantly, who insists that he maintain his innocence. Finally, following an ultimatum from Eleanor, John drops the case and apologises. Eleanor and John get married and Mr Harding resigns as Warden of Hiram&#x27;s Hospital to become Rector of St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Church on a much reduced income.

===&quot;Barchester Towers&quot;===
Following the death of Bishop Grantly, Dr Proudie is appointed as the new Bishop instead of Archdeacon Grantly (son of the Bishop), who had hoped for the post. Dr Proudie is supported by his imperious wife Mrs Proudie, and his chaplain, Mr Slope, both of whom want to steer the church away from traditional Anglican values. To fill the position of Warden at Hiram&#x27;s Hospital, Mrs Proudie insists Mr Slope backs Mr Quiverful for the role. However, Mr Slope is infatuated with widowed Eleanor Bold, and instead secretly supports the reappointment of her father Mr Harding, as do the Archdeacon and Mr Arabin of Oxford University. Mr Slope eventually proposes to Eleanor, and in doing so, exposes his dealings with both sides. In the end, he is ostracised by the cathedral community, while Mr Arabin marries Eleanor and Mr Quiverful is appointed Warden of Hiram&#x27;s Hospital.

===&quot;Doctor Thorne&quot;===
After the Gresham family has taken mortgages on the Greshamsbury estate to support itself, Frank Gresham, heir to the Greshamsbury estate, is being pressed by his family to marry a woman of wealth, such as Miss Dunstable. However, Frank is in love with Mary Thorne, niece of the Greshams&#x27; family physician, Doctor Thorne. While Mary appears to have no fortune, she is actually the illegitimate niece of the millionaire Sir Roger Scatcherd, a fact known only to Doctor Thorne. Following the death of Roger and his son Louis, Mary, being the eldest niece, receives Roger’s inheritance. Despite having already consented to their marriage, Frank’s family are far more welcoming of Mary after hearing she now has the wealth to restore the estate&#x27;s fortune.

===&quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;===
In an attempt to make connections with high society, young vicar Mark Robarts foolishly guarantees a loan to a corrupt member of Parliament, Nate Sowerby. When Mr Sowerby does not repay the loan, Mark’s friend Lord Lufton eventually steps in and saves Robarts from financial disaster. Mark’s sister Lucy has moved to Framley and falls in love with Lord Lufton. However, Lucy rejects Lord Lufton’s proposal, knowing that his mother, Lady Lufton, would refuse to accept a woman of her status as a potential wife for her son. Lady Lufton is adamant her son should marry Griselda Grantly, daughter of the Archdeacon. However in the end, Lady Lufton changes her attitude and asks Lucy to accept her son’s proposal, after witnessing Lucy care selflessly for the poor Mrs Crawley. Meanwhile, Mrs Proudie re-ignites a feud with the Archdeacon and his wife. Another subplot features the marriage of Doctor Thorne and the wealthy Miss Dunstable, who was initially the choice of Frank Gresham’s family.

===&quot;The Small House at Allington&quot;===
Sisters Bell and Lily Dale live with their widowed mother in the &quot;Small House&quot; in the village of Allington. The squire, Christopher Dale, wants Bell to marry his nephew Bernard, who is heir to the estate. Bernard introduces Lily Dale to Adolphus Crosbie, who later proposes to her. However upon learning that Lily Dale is not due to receive any significant inheritance, Crosbie also proposes to Lady Alexandrina of the prominent de Courcy family, leaving Lily Dale heartbroken. Upon hearing this, Johnny Eames, lifelong admirer of Lily Dale, beats up Crosbie in an act of which promotes him to local hero. Yet despite his devotion, Lily Dale, still emotionally devastated, rejects his proposal and chooses instead to live with her mother. In the end, Bell marries a local doctor. Crosbie and Lady Alexandrina marry, but their life is unhappy, and they decide to separate.

===&quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot;===
The main storyline follows the impoverished Rev. Josiah Crawley, introduced in &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;, who is ostracised after being wrongly accused of stealing money. Meanwhile, Major Grantly, son of the Archdeacon, falls for the disgraced clergyman&#x27;s daughter, Grace Crawley. The Archdeacon, initially objecting to the marriage, eventually consents after Mr Crawley&#x27;s innocence is confirmed. John Eames continues his unsuccessful pursuit of Lily Dale, while the beloved former Warden, Mr Harding, dies of old age. Mrs Proudie also reappears, and demands that her husband, Bishop Proudie, ban Mr Crawley from holding services. However, being a proud man, Mr Crawley refuses to comply, before Mrs Proudie dies of a heart attack.
== Conception and publication ==

While working at the General Post Office, Trollope travelled through the English countryside, witnessing the conventions of rural life and the politics surrounding the church and the manor house. On one particular trip to the cathedral city of Salisbury in 1852, Trollope developed his ideas for &quot;The Warden&quot;, which centred on the clergy. In doing so, the county of Barsetshire was born. Trollope did not begin writing &quot;The Warden&quot; until July 1853 – a year after his trip to Salisbury. Upon completion, he sent the manuscript to Longman for publishing, with the first copies released in 1855. While it was not a huge success, Trollope felt he had received more recognition than for any of his previous works.

While &quot;The Warden&quot; was intended as a one-off work, Trollope returned to Barsetshire for the setting of its sequel &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;. It was published in 1857, again by Longman, finding a similar level of success to its predecessor.

However, Trollope&#x27;s greatest literary success, based on copies sold, came in the third Barsetshire instalment, &quot;Doctor Thorne&quot;. It was published by Chapman &amp; Hall in 1858. Trollope credited his brother Tom for developing the storyline.

Following this, &quot;The Cornhill&quot; magazine approached Trollope to commission a novel to be released in serial parts. Trollope began what became &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;. In his autobiography, he explained that by &quot;placing Framley Parsonage near Barchester, I was able to fall back upon my old friends&quot;, hence forming the fourth &quot;Chronicle of Barsetshire&quot;. The novel was released by &quot;The Cornhill&quot; in 16 monthly instalments, from January 1860 to April 1861, and later published as a three-volume work by Smith, Elder &amp; Co.

Now at the height of his popularity, Trollope wrote the fifth novel in the series, &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot;. It was also published in serial form, between September 1862 and April 1864 in &quot;The Cornhill&quot;, and then published as a 2-volume novel by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. in 1864. Some have suggested that the character of Johnny Eames was inspired by Trollope&#x27;s image of his younger self. Finally came the &quot;Last Chronicle of Barset&quot;, which Trollope claimed was &quot;the best novel I have written&quot;. He took inspiration from his father when creating protagonist Josiah Crawley, while reflecting his mother, a successful author in later life, in the character of Mrs Crawley. It was released serially between 1866 and 1867 and published as a 2-volume work in 1867 by Smith, Elder &amp; Co.

There is little to suggest that Anthony Trollope ever planned to write these six novels collectively as the &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot;. Rather, after developing the county of Barsetshire in &quot;The Warden&quot;, Trollope found himself frequently returning, often in response to the request of publishers. In doing so, prominent characters like Mrs Proudie and the Archdeacon could be reintroduced. It was not until he wrote &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot; that Trollope began to envision these works as a collective series. In his autobiography, he notes that after releasing &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot;, he wished for a &quot;combined republication of those tales which are occupied within the fictitious county of Barsetshire&quot;. However, due to copyright issues, the six works were not formally republished as the &quot;Chronicles of Barset&quot; until 1878, 11 years after the &quot;Last Chronicle&quot; appeared. It was published by Chapman &amp; Hall, who had published &quot;Doctor Thorne&quot;.

== Reception ==
===As a series===
The &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot; are widely regarded as Anthony Trollope&#x27;s most famous literary works. In 1867, following the release of &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot;, a writer for &quot;The Examiner&quot; called these novels &quot;the best set of sequels in our literature&quot;. Even today, these works remain his most popular. Modern critic Arthur Pollard writes: &quot;Trollope is and will remain best known for his Barsetshire series&quot;, while P. D. Edwards offers a similar insight: &quot;During his own lifetime, and for long afterwards, his reputation rested chiefly on the Barsetshire novels&quot;.

Despite a series not initially being intended, few have argued against the importance of appreciating each novel as part of the &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot;. As R. C. Terry writes, &quot;the ironies embedded in the novel achieve their full effect only when one considers the entire Barsetshire series&quot;. Mary Poovey suggests that even before they were formally published as a series, reviewers understood their collective value. As &quot;The Examiner&quot; (1867) wrote, &quot;the public should have these Barsetshire novels extant, not only as detached works, but duly bound, lettered, and bought as a connected series&quot;.

Discussion has also surrounded the extent to which Trollope’s literary prowess is displayed throughout the &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot;. R.C. Terry argues that the series does &quot;not reveal all of Trollope’s skills&quot; while A. O. J. Cockshut believes it is &quot;simple in conception&quot; and &quot;not fully characteristic of his genius&quot;. However, in his response to Cockshut, Miguel Ángel Pérez Pérez argues that &quot;Trollope disguises many of his own opinions&quot; throughout the series, and therefore they &quot;are not so simple in conception, since they allow for different readings&quot;.

===Praise===
Trollope was praised for the characters he developed throughout the series. &quot;The London Review&quot; (1867) stated &quot;we have thoroughly accepted the reality of their existence&quot;, while &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; (1867) wrote, &quot;if the reader does not believe in Barsetshire and all who live therein […] the fault is not in Mr Trollope, but in himself&quot;. Most reviewers, like &quot;The Examiner&quot; (1867), agreed that reintroducing characters into the later instalment was Trollope &quot;realiz[ing these characters] more and more completely&quot;. Mary Poovey similarly believes that such repetition meant the characters &quot;seemed to live outside the pages of the novels&quot;. However, in contrast, the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; (1861) wrote that Trollope&#x27;s practice of &quot;borrowing from himself&quot; was &quot;at best a lazy and seductive artifice&quot;.

A writer for &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; (1864) compared Trollope’s work to that of Jane Austen, arguing that in &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot;, Trollope does &quot;what Miss Austen did, only that he does it in the modern style, with far more detail and far more analysis of character&quot;.

Trollope was also praised for the creation of Barsetshire, with critics like Arthur Pollard writing &quot;“&quot;He has created a recognisable world&quot;. Similarly, Nathaniel Hawthorne claimed it was &quot;as if some giant had hewn a great lump out of the earth and put it under a glass case, with all its inhabitants going about their daily business&quot;. Contemporary reviewers like &quot;The Examiner&quot; (1858) also praised the realism of his fictitious world; &quot;Trollope invites us, not to Barchester, but into Barsetshire&quot;. However, while inspired by real English counties, Barsetshire was, as P. D. Edwards writes, &quot;explicitly his own creature&quot;.  Andrew Wright saw this union of the real and imaginary as being &quot;conjured up out of an imagination that is at once fantastic and domestic&quot;. Moreover, Arthur Pollard argues that setting these novels within &quot;the clerical community&quot; was &quot;a brilliant choice&quot; as it was &quot;the central concern in the eyes of the nation&quot;.

The Chronicles of Barsetshire were also commended by other authors. Margaret Oliphant called the series &quot;the most perfect art […] a kind of inspiration&quot;, while Virginia Woolf wrote: &quot;We believe in Barchester as we believe in the reality of our own weekly bills&quot;. 

===Criticism===
The series has been subject to criticism regarding its plot development. &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; (1861) wrote that &quot;[T]he plot of &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot; is really extremely poor&quot;, going so far as to say &quot;Mr Trollope is not naturally a good constructor of plots&quot;. Similarly, critic Walter Allen claimed that Trollope has &quot;little skill in plot construction&quot;, while Stephen Wall suggested the outcome of &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot; &quot;is visible early on&quot;.

Trollope was also criticised, particularly by contemporary reviewers, for his intrusive narrative voice throughout the series. In her essay, Mary Poovey draws on an example from &quot;The Warden&quot;, where Trollope offers his own insight into the character of Archdeacon Grantly – &quot;our narrative has required that we should see more of his weakness than his strength&quot;. &quot;The Saturday Review (1861)&quot; refers to this as his &quot;petty trick of passing a judgment on his own fictitious personages&quot;, while &quot;The Leader&quot; (1855) argued that because of such judgement &quot;the &#x27;illusion of the scene&#x27; is invariably perilled&quot;. Similarly, Henry James referred to Trollope as having a &quot;suicidal satisfaction in reminding the reader that the story he was telling was only, after all, make-believe&quot;. However, Andrew Wright notes that at the time, it was not uncommon for authors to incorporate their own voice into their stories, and thus criticism such as that of James took issue not with the &quot;intrusiveness, but arbitrariness&quot; of Trollope&#x27;s voice. As these novels started being appreciated as a series however, Mary Poovey notes a shift away from this point of criticism. She suggests this was both &quot;a response to changes in Trollope&#x27;s novelistic practice&quot; and &quot;a departure from an earlier critical consensus&quot; regarding the use of a personal, narrative voice.

== Adaptations ==
===TV series===
In 1982, the BBC released &quot;The Barchester Chronicles&quot; – a television adaptation of &quot;The Warden&quot; and &quot;Barchester Towers&quot; directed by David Giles. The cast featured Nigel Hawthorne as the Archdeacon, Donald Pleasence as Mr Harding, Geraldine McEwan as Mrs Proudie and Alan Rickman as Mr Slope. The series consisted of 7 episodes, released originally on BBC 2 between 10 November and 22 December 1982. The first two episodes primarily covered &quot;The Warden&quot; while the remaining five covered &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;. In 1983, it received the BAFTA award for Best Design and was nominated for seven others, including Best Drama Series.

In 2016, &quot;Doctor Thorne&quot; was adapted for television as a 3-part mini-series. In the UK, it was released on ITV between 6–20 March 2016. It was directed by Niall MacCormick and written by Julian Fellowes.
===Radio===
In 1993, &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot; was released as a dramatised radio programme on BBC Radio 4. It was created by Martin Wade and directed by Cherry Cookson. Each character was played by a voice actor, with the story being accompanied by music and sound effects. Following its success, the other five novels were also adapted to this form and released between December 1995 and March 1998 as &quot;The Chronicles of Barset&quot;.

BBC Radio 4 released another radio adaptation titled &quot;The Barchester Chronicles&quot; in 2014. This programme was created by Michael Symmons Roberts, and also covered all six Barsetshire novels.

===Inspired works===
Between 1933 and 1961, author Angela Thirkell published 29 novels set in the county of Barsetshire. While Thirkell introduced her own characters, she also incorporates members of Trollope&#x27;s Barsetshire families, including the Crawleys, Luftons, Grantlys and Greshams. A writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; (2008) suggested that &quot;Unlike Trollope, Thirkell is uninterested in money and politics&quot; but is instead, &quot;interested in love&quot;.

Another early sequel was &quot;Barchester Pilgrimage&quot;, by the renowned priest, novelist and theologian Ronald Knox, following the children and grandchildren of Trollope&#x27;s characters. 

Author M. R. James also used Barchester for the setting of his 1910 short story &quot;The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral&quot;.

<text>Panlong (; lit. &quot;coiled dragon&quot;) is an aquatic dragon resembling a &quot;jiaolong&quot; 蛟龍 &quot;river dragon; crocodile&quot; in Chinese mythology, an ancient motif in Chinese art, and a proper name.


==Word==
The Chinese compound &quot;panlong&quot; combines &quot;pan&quot; &quot;coiling; curling; curving; bending; winding; twisting&quot; and &quot;long&quot; or &quot;dragon&quot;. &quot;Longpan&quot; &quot;dragon coiling&quot;, the reverse of &quot;panlong&quot;, is a literary metaphor for &quot;person of unrecognized talent&quot; (see the &quot;Fayan&quot; below).

&quot;Panlong&quot; &quot;coiled dragon&quot; can be written or , using &quot;pan&quot; &#x27;s homophonous variant Chinese character &quot;pan&quot; or &quot;tray; plate; dish&quot;. Another example of this graphic interchangeability is &quot;panrao&quot; or &quot;twine round; surround; fill&quot;. Two Classical Chinese &quot;panlong&quot; idioms are &quot;panlongpi&quot; (&quot;coiling dragon habit&quot;) &quot;gambling addiction&quot; (alluding to 5th-century gambler Liu Yi or Liu Panlong of Eastern Jin ) and &quot;panlong-wohu&quot; (lit. &quot;coiling dragon crouching tiger&quot;) &quot;talented people remaining concealed&quot;. In Fengshui and Four Symbols theory, the Dragon and Tiger are symbolic opposites. Take for instance, &quot;longtan-huxue&quot; (&quot;dragon&#x27;s pond and tiger&#x27;s cave&quot;) &quot;dangerous places&quot; or &quot;Wohu canglong&quot; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

==Textual usages==

Chinese classic texts began using &quot;panlong&quot; in the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). The (2nd century BCE) &quot;Huainanzi&quot; first records &quot;panlong&quot; as a decorative style on Chinese bronzes. 
Great bells and tripods, beautiful vessels, works of art are manufactured. The decorations cast on these have been superb. The mountain dragon, or pheasant, and all animals of variegated plumage, the aquatic grass, flamboyants and grains of cereals were engraven on them, one symbol interwoven with another. The sleeping rhinoceros and crouching tiger, the dragon, wreathed in coils, were wrought.
The later term &quot;panlongwen&quot; &quot;coiled-dragon pattern/design (on bronzes, pillars, etc.)&quot; compares with &quot;panchiwen&quot; (see &quot;chilong&quot; ) and &quot;panqiuwen&quot; (see &quot;qiulong&quot; ). Another &quot;Huainanzi&quot; context lists &quot;longshepan&quot; (lit. &quot;dragon snake coiling&quot;) &quot;serpentine passage&quot; as a good ambush location. 
An exiguous pass, a ferry pontoon, a great mountain, a serpentine defile, a cul-de-sac, a dangerous pitfall, a narrow ravine, full of winding ways like the intestines of a sheep, a hole like a fisher&#x27;s net, which admits, but from which there is no exit, are situations in which one man can hold back a thousand. 

The materialist philosopher Yang Xiong (53 BCE – 18 CE) used both &quot;panlong&quot; and &quot;longpan&quot;. His &quot;Fangyan&quot; &quot;Regional Speech&quot; dictionary defined &quot;panlong&quot; &quot;coiled/curled dragon&quot;, &quot;Dragons which do not yet ascend to heaven [cf. &quot;tianlong&quot; &quot;heavenly dragon&quot;] are called &quot;p&#x27;an-lung&quot;.&quot; His &quot;Fayan&quot; &quot;Words to Live By&quot; anthology coined the metaphor &quot;longpan&quot; (lit. &quot;dragon coiling&quot;) &quot;person of unrecognized talent&quot;, &quot;&#x27;a dragon coiled in the mud will be insulted by a newt,&#x27; meaning &#x27;a sage will be ridiculed by a fool&#x27;.&quot;

The (2nd century CE) &quot;Shangshu dazhuan&quot; commentary to the &quot;Classic of History&quot; parallels &quot;panlong&quot; and &quot;jiaoyu&quot; (or &quot;jiaolong&quot; ), &quot;the &#x27;coiled dragon&#x27; was greatly trusted in its lair, the &#x27; dragon; crocodile&#x27; leaped in its pool.&quot;

The (12th century CE) Song dynasty &quot;Biji manzhi&quot; &quot;Random Jottings from the Green Rooster Quarter&quot; by Wang Zhuo describes using &quot;panlong&quot; dragons in sympathetic magic for rainfall, &quot;where a mirror, adorned on the backside with a &quot;coiled dragon&quot;, &quot;p&#x27;an lung&quot;, , is said to have been worshipped (rather used in a magical way) in order to cause rain.&quot;

==Proper names==

In addition to the ancient decorative style mentioned above, &quot;Panlong&quot; or &quot;Coiled Dragon&quot; is used in several names. 
*&quot;Panlong&quot; or , pen name of Huan Xuan
*&quot;Panlongmu&quot; or , Pelycosaur (from Greek &quot;bowl lizard&quot;)
*&quot;Panlongqu&quot; or , Panlong District in Kunming Prefecture, Yunnan
*&quot;Panlongjiang&quot; or , Panlong River in Kunming City, Yunnan
*&quot;Panlongxia&quot; or , Panlong Gorge (with a famous waterfall) in Zhaoqing, Guangdong
*&quot;Panlongcheng&quot; or , Panlongcheng archeological site of Erligang culture in Hubei
*&quot;Panlongzhen&quot; a township on the Panlong table hill (蟠龙山) in Shaanxi. 
The Japanese language borrowed &quot;banryū&quot; or &quot;coiled dragon&quot; as a loanword from Chinese &quot;panlong&quot;. Banryu names a Taikyoku shogi chess-piece and a Bakufu schooner warship &quot;Banryū&quot;.

<text>George de Mestral () was a Swiss electrical engineer who invented the hook and loop fastener which he named Velcro.

==Biography==
He was born to Albert de Mestral, an agronomist engineer, and Marthe de Goumoëns in Saint Saphorin sur Morges, near Lausanne, Switzerland. De Mestral designed a toy airplane at age twelve and patented it. He attended the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). After graduation in 1930, he worked in the machine shop of an engineering company. He went for his favorite hobby of hunting and when he came back he discovered that his dog was covered with burs that had attached themselves to its fur. He then worked on inventing hook and loop fasteners for ten years starting in 1948. In 1955, he successfully patented hook and loop, eventually selling 60 million yards (about 55,000 km) a year through a multimillion-dollar company.

=== Marriage ===
De Mestral was married three times: in 1932 to Jeanne Schnyder (two sons: Henri and François), in 1949 to Monique Panchaud de Bottens, onetime fiancée of James Bond creator Ian Fleming (one son: Charles), and Helen Mary Dale. On his father&#x27;s death in 1966, de Mestral inherited the family home in Saint Saphorin sur Morges, château Saint-Saphorin-sur-Morges (Mestral Castle).

=== Death ===

De Mestral died in Commugny, Switzerland, where he is buried. The municipality posthumously named an avenue, L&#x27;avenue George de Mestral, in his honour.

== Honors and awards ==
He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1999 for inventing hook and loop fasteners. 
* He was made &quot;Bourgeois d&#x27;Honneur&quot; of Commugny.
* Honorary Member of the &quot;Société Vaudoise des Ingénieurs et Architectes&quot; 
* Recipient of the French medal &quot;Société d&#x27;Encouragement au Progrès&quot;

==Invention of hook and loop==
De Mestral first conceptualised hook and loop after returning from a hunting trip with his dog in the Alps in 1941. After removing several of the burdock burrs (seeds) that kept sticking to his clothes and his dog&#x27;s fur, he became curious as to how it worked. He examined them under a microscope, and noted hundreds of &quot;hooks&quot; that caught on anything with a loop, such as clothing, animal fur, or hair. He saw the possibility of binding two materials reversibly in a simple fashion, if he could figure out how to duplicate the hooks and loops.

Initially people refused to take him and his idea seriously. He took his idea to Lyon, which was then a centre of weaving, where he did manage to gain the help of one weaver, who made two cotton strips that worked. However, the cotton wore out quickly, so de Mestral turned to synthetic fibres. He settled on nylon as being the best synthetic after, through trial and error, he eventually discovered that nylon forms hooks that were perfect for the hook side of the fastener when sewn under hot infrared light. Though he had figured out how to make the hooks, he had yet to figure out a way to mechanise the process, and to make the looped side. Next he found that nylon thread, when woven in loops and heat-treated, retains its shape and is resilient, however, the loops had to be cut in just the right spot so that they could be fastened and unfastened many times. On the verge of giving up, a new idea came to him. He bought a pair of shears and trimmed the tops off the loops, thus creating hooks that would match up perfectly with the loops.

Mechanising the process of the weave of the hooks took eight years, and it took another year to create the loom that trimmed the loops after weaving them. In all, it took ten years to create a mechanised process that worked. He submitted his idea for patent in Switzerland in 1951 and the patent was granted in 1955. De Mestral expected a high demand immediately. After receiving patents, he subsequently opened shops in Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada. In 1957, he branched out to the textile centre of Manchester, New Hampshire in the United States.

De Mestral gave the name Velcro, a portmanteau of the French words velours (&quot;velvet&quot;), and crochet (&quot;hook&quot;), to his invention as well as his company, which continues to manufacture and market the fastening system.

However, hook and loop&#x27;s integration into the textile industry took time, partly because of its appearance. Hook and loop in the early 1960s looked like it had been made from left-over bits of cheap fabric, an unappealing aspect for clothiers. The first notable use for Velcro® brand hook and loop came in the aerospace industry, where it helped astronauts manoeuvre in and out of bulky space suits. Eventually, skiers noted the similar advantages of a suit that was easier to get in and out of. Scuba and marine gear followed soon after.

<doc id="638868" wikidata="Q7961540" url="?curid=638868" title="Waldo, Kansas City">
<text>Waldo is a neighborhood located on the southside of Kansas City, Missouri, that has continued to maintain its own unique character, even though it was annexed by Kansas City in 1909. Waldo&#x27;s boundaries are Gregory Boulevard on the north to 91st Street on the south, and Troost Avenue on the east to State Line on the west.

==History==
In 1841, David Waldo of Gasconade County, Missouri, was convinced by some friends to purchase land in Jackson County, Missouri. Waldo purchased that ran from what is now Gregory to 91st Street and State Line to Holmes.

In 1860, a rail line was established between Westport and Dodson, and a main stop was located in Waldo. When the rail line was converted to street cars in 1907, a brick station was built at the Waldo location, and it became known as the Grand Central Station of Waldo. Waldo was annexed by Kansas City in 1909, which pushed the southern city limit from 49th Street to 77th Street. Business began to grow around the station, including Elmer Family Grocery and Milen Drygoods. As the growth continued, the Waldo area became a main traffic artery of south Kansas City. Houses on Wornall Road south to 75th Street made way for continued business expansion in the 1930s.

The Waldo Water Tower, located near 75th and Holmes, is a local landmark and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Alexander Majors House is another local landmark listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

==Education==
Waldo has a lending library, a branch of the Kansas City Public Library.

St. Elizabeth School is a parochial catholic school located in Waldo. It was founded in 1922, and serves students from pre-school through 8th grade.

Hale Cook Elementary is a Kansas City public school located in Waldo. It was founded in 1912 and closed in 2009, but reopened as a neighborhood school in 2014. It serves students from pre-school through 6th grade.

Kansas City Academy is an independent school serving students in 6th through 12th grade located in Waldo.

<doc id="638875" wikidata="Q190336" url="?curid=638875" title="Minzu University of China">
<text>The Minzu University of China (MUC) is a national public university in Beijing, China. It is affiliated with the National Ethnic Affairs Commission of China. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

Minzu University ranked first in China among universities for ethnic minority studies. It aims to be one of the best universities of its kind in the world for inheriting and promoting the excellent culture of all ethnic groups. With the strong support of Chinese government, it has developed rapidly over the years. MUC is one of the most prestigious universities in China in ethnology, anthropology, ethnic economies, regional economics, religion studies, history, dance, and fine arts.

==Name==

The Chinese name has the meaning &quot;central ethnic university&quot;, suggesting a national-level university focused on serving minority ethnic groups. The old English name translated the ethnic term as &quot;nationalities&quot;, based on the term used in German and Russian language Marxist texts. On 20 November 2008, the university changed its official English name, apparently citing concerns that &quot;central&quot; might imply a location in the geographical centre of China (as it does in South-Central University for Nationalities), and the old name did not sound good. The name change of Renmin University has been cited as a precedent. The new name obscures the university&#x27;s ethnic character, although student opinion has focused more on the fact that it makes obsolete the university&#x27;s nickname, &quot;the village&quot;. The Chinese word for village () has a Hanyu pinyin spelling similar to the English abbreviation &quot;CUN&quot;. In mainland Chinese culture, villages have homely connotations.

==Rankings==
In 2001, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; described CUN as &quot;China&#x27;s top academy for ethnic studies.&quot; Minzu University is ranked first by Shanghai Ranking in China among universities that originated as &quot;ethnic minorities&quot;.

The university&#x27;s emphasis on arts and humanities programs, particularly those majors related to ethnic minorities, has resulted in a relatively lower standing in global university rankings.

It also ranked 301-350th in Asia by the QS Asia University Rankings and 271-280th among BRICS countries by the QS BRICS University Rankings.

Internationally, Minzu University of China was ranked amongst top 2000 in the world by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Global Universities Ranking, the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR), the RUR World University Rankings, Scimago Institutions Rankings and University Ranking by Academic Performance.

==History==

The Chinese Communist Party first established a Nationalities Institute in its Civil War stronghold of Yan&#x27;an, in central China, in October 1941. In 1950-1952, this was merged with other ethnolinguistic and sociological departments, including elements of Peking University and Tsinghua University. The result was the Central Institute for Nationalities, which was established in 1951 and officially opened on 11 June 1952. The institute was assigned a large area of parkland on the outskirts of Beijing as its campus.

Both the Yan&#x27;an and Central institutes were intended to train cadres (officials) for ethnic minority areas, as well as providing a liberal arts education for promising students from the minorities. The cadres were to be trained so they could serve as liaisons between their minority communities and the Chinese government. Their research was and is intended to support the policies of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission. In its early years, the institute was caught up in the sensitive issue of classifying China&#x27;s vast population into official ethnic groups, until the Cultural Revolution made conventional education almost impossible.

In 1999, it was granted &quot;key university&quot; status, as part of Project 211, which was supposed to identify 100 Chinese universities that would play leading roles in the 21st century. Since 2004, the university has been a participant in Project 985, a major national programme to raise 39 universities to world-class status. The campus has been almost completely reconstructed as part of this programme.

Meanwhile, Haidian has continued to develop as Beijing&#x27;s main university district. CUN is now adjacent to the National Library of China and Zhongguancun, which local media refer to as &quot;China&#x27;s silicon valley.&quot; In 2006 a large site was acquired in Beijing&#x27;s Fengtai district, and it is likely that a second campus will be constructed there.

==Admissions==

To ensure that members of the 56 recognized minority groups are admitted the school has fixed quotas for each group. As of 2011, Minzu University accepts National Higher Education Entrance Examination (&quot;Gaokao&quot;) scores with a minimum in the mid-400s, or below the 50th percentile. Out of the Beijing universities, this has one of the lowest acceptance requirements.

In China a university may admit a student whose score is barely below the cutoff score at its discretion. Sometimes minimum score levels were lowered to ensure that students from among the least-accepted minority groups would be permitted entry. The school offers remedial courses, including a one-year tutorial course that reviews the final year of senior secondary school and remedial Chinese courses to assist minority students to enroll.

The university has bridging programs to select minority students at Chinese secondary schools who are high achieving so they can attend Minzu University to prepare them for entering the highest ranked universities in Beijing. The government pays tuition for these programs.

<text>In graph theory, a path in a graph is a finite or infinite sequence of edges which joins a sequence of vertices which, by most definitions, are all distinct (and since the vertices are distinct, so are the edges). A directed path (sometimes called dipath) in a directed graph is a finite or infinite sequence of edges which joins a sequence of distinct vertices, but with the added restriction that the edges be all directed in the same direction.

Paths are fundamental concepts of graph theory, described in the introductory sections of most graph theory texts. See e.g. , , or . cover more advanced algorithmic topics concerning paths in graphs.

== Definitions ==
=== Walk, trail, and path ===

* A walk is a finite or infinite sequence of edges which joins a sequence of vertices.
: Let be a graph. A finite walk is a sequence of edges for which there is a sequence of vertices such that &quot;Φ&quot;(&quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;) = {&quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; + 1} for . is the &quot;vertex sequence&quot; of the walk. The walk is &quot;closed&quot; if &quot;v&quot;1 = &quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and it is &quot;open&quot; otherwise. An infinite walk is a sequence of edges of the same type described here, but with no first or last vertex, and a semi-infinite walk (or ray) has a first vertex but no last vertex.
* A trail is a walk in which all edges are distinct.
* A path is a trail in which all vertices (and therefore also all edges) are distinct.

If is a finite walk with vertex sequence then &quot;w&quot; is said to be a &quot;walk from&quot; &quot;v&quot;1 &quot;to&quot; &quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Similarly for a trail or a path. If there is a finite walk between two &quot;distinct&quot; vertices then there is also a finite trail and a finite path between them.

Some authors do not require that all vertices of a path be distinct and instead use the term simple path to refer to such a path where all vertices are distinct.

A weighted graph associates a value (&quot;weight&quot;) with every edge in the graph. The &quot;weight of a walk&quot; (or trail or path) in a weighted graph is the sum of the weights of the traversed edges. Sometimes the words &quot;cost&quot; or &quot;length&quot; are used instead of weight.

=== Directed walk, directed trail, and directed path ===
* A directed walk is a finite or infinite sequence of edges directed in the same direction which joins a sequence of vertices.
: Let be a directed graph. A finite directed walk is a sequence of edges for which there is a sequence of vertices such that for . is the &quot;vertex sequence&quot; of the directed walk. The directed walk is &quot;closed&quot; if &quot;v&quot;1 = &quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and it is &quot;open&quot; otherwise. An infinite directed walk is a sequence of edges of the same type described here, but with no first or last vertex, and a semi-infinite directed walk (or ray) has a first vertex but no last vertex.
* A directed trail is a directed walk in which all edges are distinct.
* A directed path is a directed trail in which all vertices are distinct.

If is a finite directed walk with vertex sequence then &quot;w&quot; is said to be a &quot;walk from&quot; &quot;v&quot;1 &quot;to&quot; &quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Similarly for a directed trail or a path. If there is a finite directed walk between two &quot;distinct&quot; vertices then there is also a finite directed trail and a finite directed path between them.

A &quot;simple directed path&quot; is a path where all vertices are distinct. 

A weighted directed graph associates a value (&quot;weight&quot;) with every edge in the directed graph. The &quot;weight of a directed walk&quot; (or trail or path) in a weighted directed graph is the sum of the weights of the traversed edges. Sometimes the words &quot;cost&quot; or &quot;length&quot; are used instead of weight.

== Examples ==
* A graph is connected if there are paths containing each pair of vertices.
* A directed graph is strongly connected if there are oppositely oriented directed paths containing each pair of vertices.
* A path such that no graph edges connect two nonconsecutive path vertices is called an induced path.
* A path that includes every vertex of the graph without repeats is known as a Hamiltonian path.
* Two paths are &quot;vertex-independent&quot; (alternatively, &quot;internally disjoint&quot; or &quot;internally vertex-disjoint&quot;) if they do not have any internal vertex or edge in common. Similarly, two paths are &quot;edge-independent&quot; (or &quot;edge-disjoint&quot;) if they do not have any edge in common. Two internally disjoint paths are edge-disjoint, but the converse is not necessarily true.
* The distance between two vertices in a graph is the length of a shortest path between them, if one exists, and otherwise the distance is infinity.
* The diameter of a connected graph is the largest distance (defined above) between pairs of vertices of the graph.

== Finding paths ==
Several algorithms exist to find shortest and longest paths in graphs, with the important distinction that the former problem is computationally much easier than the latter.

Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm produces a list of shortest paths from a source vertex to every other vertex in directed and undirected graphs with non-negative edge weights (or no edge weights), whilst the Bellman–Ford algorithm can be applied to directed graphs with negative edge weights. The Floyd–Warshall algorithm can be used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in weighted directed graphs.

== The path partition problem ==
The k-path partition problem is the problem of partitioning a given graph to a smallest collection of vertex-disjoint paths of length at most &quot;k&quot;.

<doc id="638898" wikidata="Q42661" url="?curid=638898" title="Javanese cat">
<text>The Javanese, also known as the Colorpoint (or Colourpoint) Longhair in some registries (though that name has other meanings), is a variety of purebred domestic cat.

In the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA), it is an offshoot of the Balinese breed, out-crossed to Siamese, Colorpoint Shorthair, and Balinese cats. Individuals have medium-longhair and non-traditional point coloration (lynx/tabby point, tortoiseshell point or red/cream point). The variety was developed in North America; its name is derived from the tradition of naming Oriental-type cats after Southeast Asian places.

Depending on the cat registry in question, the Javanese may be treated as a stand-alone breed, considered a Javanese division of the Balinese, or subsumed with the Himalayan into a merged breed called simply Colourpoint. In others, the cats considered non-traditional colored Balinese cats by the CFA, are also accepted as Balinese cats. Confusingly, some registries refer to what other registries refer to as the &quot;Oriental Longhair&quot; as &quot;Javanese&quot;. 

==Origin==
The term &quot;Javanese cat&quot; was coined by a Helen Smith of MerryMews Cattery circa 1950, but for a different variety she was working on. It is unknown if she had ever traveled to Indonesia. The name was derived from the tradition of using the names of the countries and islands of south-east Asia for Oriental cat breeds.

Around 1978, breeders of Balinese cats in Canada and the United States, affiliated primarily with the clubs Balinese Internationale and Balinese Breeders and Fanciers of America, sought acceptance from the US-headquartered, international Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) of their &quot;new colors&quot; (variations on the traditional point-colored Balinese). The cats were accepted for registration but not competition into the CFA in 1979, but only as a new breed rather than as a division of Balinese; the name &quot;Javanese&quot; (independent of Helen Smith&#x27;s use of it in the 1950s) was selected by looking at a map and picking Java, an island near Bali. CFA awarded &quot;Provisional&quot; status in 1984, and the CFA Javanese gained full &quot;Championship&quot; status in the organization in 1986.

The Javanese, under CFA definitions, was merged back into Balinese as the Javanese Division in 2008, to be more consistent with other registries&#x27; coat-color rules.

==Classification==

In the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association, the Javanese, now a sub-breed, is a generally Balinese-ancestry cat with a coat that does not follow the traditional and strictly defined point coloration patterns of the Balinese. Only &quot;traditional&quot; colored seal, blue, chocolate, and lilac solid colorpoints fall under the Balinese cat in CFA, and thus referring to all lynx (tabby), tortoiseshell and other point colourations in Balinese cats as Javanese. Well into the 1990s, it was still permissible to back-cross Javanese to Balinese, Siamese, and Colorpoint Shorthairs for genetic diversity within the Javanese line. Under current CFA rules, and after intervening breed redefinitions, only &quot;certain limited outcrossing&quot; is allowed (by special permission from CFA), and only to the Oriental Longhair (a related breed that has the same broad color range but body-wide, lacking the colorpoint pattern). All outcrossing will stop at the end of 2025.

Such Balinese with non-traditional colors are, in some other registries, named Colorpoint Longhair, though this term is ambiguous, and can refer to different breeds in some registries. In the World Cat Federation (WCF) scheme, cats that would be classified in other registries as Javanese or Colorpoint Longhair have been merged with Himalayan into a single breed, Colourpoint. In most registries aside from the WCF, the Himalayan cat is a separate breed, a cross between the Balinese and the Persian, limited to traditional Balinese/Siamese colors. To complicate matters further, some registries have instead applied the name &quot;Javanese&quot; to what other registries call the Oriental Longhair, which has no point coloration.

==Features==

The Javanese breed has a long, silky coat in a variety of colors (unlike the actual native domestic cats of Java which have short hair). It is a single coat, in contrast to the double coat (with guard hairs) found in most long-haired breeds; as a result, it lies close to the skin, and produces a longer, sleeker look than is typical for long-haired cats. Like the Colorpoint Shorthair, the Javanese has point coloration (with a pale body and darker face and extremities), but is permitted to have coat colors and patterns not found in the Balinese or Siamese. These may range from dark brown to near white, and may be ruddy to bluish, tabby, lynx point, cream point, tortoiseshell (tortie), tortie point, and others, including unusual combinations (&quot;blue-cream point&quot;, &quot;cinnamon-tortie lynx point&quot;, etc.). In total, CFA defines 24 Javanese-division color combinations in addition to the four Balinese basics. Standard Javanese always have blue eyes.

==Behavior==
It is noted as an intelligent cat and tends to vocalize, often for no apparent reason; this is also a trait of the Siamese ancestor. They are notably fond of play, jumping and human contact, vocalizing, and getting into whatever their owners are doing and can become depressed if not regularly entertained by humans or other pets. They are reportedly good mouse hunters.

==Genetic disorders==
Common genetic disorders are shared with the Balinese and Siamese breeds. These include: dental issues, Amyloidosis, IBD, HCM and eye issues.

<doc id="638899" wikidata="Q1304193" url="?curid=638899" title="Vertex (graph theory)">
<text>In discrete mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a vertex (plural vertices) or node is the fundamental unit of which graphs are formed: an undirected graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges (unordered pairs of vertices), while a directed graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of arcs (ordered pairs of vertices). In a diagram of a graph, a vertex is usually represented by a circle with a label, and an edge is represented by a line or arrow extending from one vertex to another.

From the point of view of graph theory, vertices are treated as featureless and indivisible objects, although they may have additional structure depending on the application from which the graph arises; for instance, a semantic network is a graph in which the vertices represent concepts or classes of objects.

The two vertices forming an edge are said to be the endpoints of this edge, and the edge is said to be incident to the vertices. A vertex &quot;w&quot; is said to be adjacent to another vertex &quot;v&quot; if the graph contains an edge (&quot;v&quot;,&quot;w&quot;). The neighborhood of a vertex &quot;v&quot; is an induced subgraph of the graph, formed by all vertices adjacent to &quot;v&quot;.

==Types of vertices==

The degree of a vertex, denoted 𝛿(v) in a graph is the number of edges incident to it. An isolated vertex is a vertex with degree zero; that is, a vertex that is not an endpoint of any edge (the example image illustrates one isolated vertex). A leaf vertex (also pendant vertex) is a vertex with degree one. In a directed graph, one can distinguish the outdegree (number of outgoing edges), denoted 𝛿 +(v), from the indegree (number of incoming edges), denoted 𝛿−(v); a source vertex is a vertex with indegree zero, while a sink vertex is a vertex with outdegree zero. A simplicial vertex is one whose neighbors form a clique: every two neighbors are adjacent. A universal vertex is a vertex that is adjacent to every other vertex in the graph.

A cut vertex is a vertex the removal of which would disconnect the remaining graph; a vertex separator is a collection of vertices the removal of which would disconnect the remaining graph into small pieces. A k-vertex-connected graph is a graph in which removing fewer than &quot;k&quot; vertices always leaves the remaining graph connected. An independent set is a set of vertices no two of which are adjacent, and a vertex cover is a set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of each edge in the graph. The vertex space of a graph is a vector space having a set of basis vectors corresponding with the graph&#x27;s vertices.

A graph is vertex-transitive if it has symmetries that map any vertex to any other vertex. In the context of graph enumeration and graph isomorphism it is important to distinguish between labeled vertices and unlabeled vertices. A labeled vertex is a vertex that is associated with extra information that enables it to be distinguished from other labeled vertices; two graphs can be considered isomorphic only if the correspondence between their vertices pairs up vertices with equal labels. An unlabeled vertex is one that can be substituted for any other vertex based only on its adjacencies in the graph and not based on any additional information.

Vertices in graphs are analogous to, but not the same as, vertices of polyhedra: the skeleton of a polyhedron forms a graph, the vertices of which are the vertices of the polyhedron, but polyhedron vertices have additional structure (their geometric location) that is not assumed to be present in graph theory. The vertex figure of a vertex in a polyhedron is analogous to the neighborhood of a vertex in a graph.

<doc id="638903" wikidata="Q7118447" url="?curid=638903" title="PBS News Hour">
<text>PBS News Hour, previously stylized as PBS NewsHour, is the news division of PBS and an American daily evening television news program broadcast on over 350 PBS member stations since October 20, 1975. It airs seven nights a week, and is known for its in-depth coverage of issues and current events. Since January 2, 2023, the one-hour weekday editions have been anchored by Amna Nawaz and Geoff Bennett. The 30-minute weekend editions that premiered on September 7, 2013, branded as PBS News Weekend, have been anchored by John Yang since December 31, 2022.

The broadcasts are produced by PBS member station WETA-TV in Washington, D.C., and originates from its studio facilities in Arlington County, Virginia. Since 2019, news updates inserted into the weekday broadcasts targeted for viewers in the Western United States, online, and late at night have been anchored by Stephanie Sy, originating from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University. Additional production facilities for the program are based in San Francisco and Denver. The program is a collaboration between WETA-TV and PBS member station WNET in New York City, along with KQED in San Francisco, KETC in St. Louis, and WTTW in Chicago.

The program debuted in 1975 as The Robert MacNeil Report before being renamed The MacNeil/Lehrer Report one year later. It was anchored by Robert MacNeil from WNET&#x27;s studios and Jim Lehrer from WETA&#x27;s studios. In 1983, the show was rebranded as The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, and then The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer following MacNeil&#x27;s departure in 1995. It was then renamed to its current &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; title in 2009, two years before Lehrer left in 2011. Originally, the program only aired on weekdays before weekend editions began in 2013. Production of the weekend broadcasts were solely produced by WNET, before the New York City station transferred all of its &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; involvement to WETA in April 2022.

==History==
=== Ownership ===
In September 1981, production of the program was taken over by MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, a partnership between Robert MacNeil, Jim Lehrer, and Gannett; the latter sold its stake in the production company in 1986. John C. Malone&#x27;s Liberty Media bought a 67% controlling equity stake in MacNeil/Lehrer Productions in 1994, but MacNeil and Lehrer retained editorial control. In 2014, &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer Productions&quot;, owned by MacNeil, Lehrer, and Liberty Media announced its donation, as &quot;NewsHour Productions LLC&quot;, to WETA-TV as a nonprofit subsidiary.

===&quot;The Robert MacNeil Report&quot; and &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer Report&quot; (1975–1983)===
In 1973, Robert MacNeil (a former NBC News correspondent and then-moderator of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Washington Week in Review&quot;) and Jim Lehrer teamed up to cover the United States Senate&#x27;s Watergate hearings for PBS. They earned an Emmy Award for their unprecedented gavel-to-gavel coverage.

This recognition led to the creation of &quot;The Robert MacNeil Report&quot;, a half-hour local news program on WNET, which debuted on October 20, 1975; each episode of the program covered a single issue in depth. On December 1, 1975, the program began to air on PBS stations nationwide. It was renamed &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer Report&quot; on September 6, 1976. Most editions employed a two-anchor, two-city format, with MacNeil based in New York City and Lehrer at WETA&#x27;s studios in Arlington, Virginia. Charlayne Hunter-Gault joined the series as a correspondent in 1977, serving as a substitute host for MacNeil and Lehrer whenever either had the night off. She became the series&#x27; national correspondent in 1983.

===&quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot; and &quot;The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer&quot; (1983–2009)===
Having decided to start competing with the nightly news programs on ABC, CBS and NBC instead of complementing them, the program expanded to one hour on September 5, 1983, incorporating other changes, such as the introduction of &quot;documentary reportage from the field&quot;; it became known at that time as &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot;. Lester Crystal was its founding executive producer. MacNeil/Lehrer Productions twice planned to launch late-night newscasts in 1995 and 1999; in both instances, the proposed expansions—which, respectively, were to have involved production and newsgathering partnerships with Wall Street Journal Television and &quot;The New York Times&quot;—were canceled mid-development.

MacNeil retired from the program on October 20, 1995, leaving Lehrer as the sole anchor. Accordingly, the program was renamed &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot; on October 23. (Hunter-Gault left in June 1997.) On January 16, 1996, &quot;The NewsHour&quot; announced the creation of its official website at PBS Online. &quot;The NewsHour&quot; won a Peabody Award in 2003 for the feature report &quot;Jobless Recovery: Non-Working Numbers&quot;. On May 17, 1999, &quot;The NewsHour&quot; adopted a new graphics package with refreshed music from 1983, plus the new studio with a blue globe in the middle. On October 4, 1999, Gwen Ifill and Ray Suarez joined &quot;The NewsHour&quot; team as new correspondents. Ifill was a female anchor of a national nightly news program on broadcast television. Effective January 17, 2000, &quot;The NewsHour&quot; added &quot;America Online Keyword: PBS&quot; to its ending screen for a three-year agreement through April 22, 2003. For only the website, the program took effect on April 23, 2003. On March 3, 2003, the program added dates from the 1999 graphics in the beginning. On November 17, 2003, &quot;The NewsHour&quot; added music in the beginning with dates.

On May 17, 2006, the program underwent its first major change in presentation in years, adopting a new graphics package and a reorchestrated version of its theme music (originally composed by Bernard Hoffer). On December 17, 2007, the &quot;NewsHour&quot; became the second nightly broadcast network newscast to begin broadcasting in high definition (after &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; on March 26, 2007), with broadcasts in a letterboxed format for viewers with standard-definition television sets watching via either cable or satellite television. The program also introduced a new set and converted its graphics package to HD.

===&quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;===
====Departure of Jim Lehrer and switch to co-anchors (2009–2013)====

On May 11, 2009, PBS announced that the program would be revamped on December 7 of that year under a revised title, the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;. In addition to increased integration between the &quot;NewsHour&quot; website and nightly broadcast, the updated production returned to a two-anchor format. Lehrer described the overhaul as the first phase in his move toward retirement.

On September 27, 2010, &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; was presented with the Chairman&#x27;s Award at the 31st News &amp; Documentary Emmy Awards, with MacNeil, Lehrer, Crystal, and former executive producer Linda Winslow receiving the award on the show&#x27;s behalf.

Lehrer formally ended his tenure as a regular anchor of the program on June 6, 2011. He continued to occasionally anchor on Fridays, when he usually led the political analysis segment with syndicated columnist Mark Shields and &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist David Brooks, until December 30, 2011. &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; continues with various anchors until September 6, 2013.

====Transfer of production, expansion to weekends and the west (2013–present)====

On August 6, 2013, Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff were named co-anchors and co-managing editors of the &quot;NewsHour&quot;. They shared anchor duties on the Monday through Thursday editions, with Woodruff anchoring solo on Fridays due to Ifill&#x27;s duties as host of the political discussion program &quot;Washington Week,&quot; which was also produced Friday evenings.

For much of its history, the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; aired only Monday through Friday, but in March 2013, plans to expand the program to include Saturday and Sunday editions were under development. On June 17, 2013, &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; announced that the weekend editions of the program would premiere on September 7, 2013, with Hari Sreenivasan serving as anchor. Although they aired for a half-hour, the weekend broadcasts were branded with a modified program name, &quot;PBS NewsHour Weekend&quot;. This program is based on the duration of WNET&#x27;s involvement with the program. From the weekend broadcasts&#x27; debut until the March 27, 2022 edition, the Saturday and Sunday editions originated from the Tisch/WNET Studios at Lincoln Center in Manhattan, as opposed to the program&#x27;s main production facilities at the Arlington, Virginia, studios of WETA-TV.

MacNeil/Lehrer Productions announced in a letter to the show&#x27;s staffers on October 8, 2013, that it had offered to transfer ownership in the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; to WETA. In the letter, Lehrer and MacNeil cited their reduced involvement with the program&#x27;s production since their departures from anchoring, as well as &quot;the probability of increasing our fundraising abilities.&quot; WETA&#x27;s board of trustees approved the transfer on June 17, 2014, and it took effect on July 1. At that time, NewsHour Productions, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of WETA, took over production of the program. WETA also acquired MacNeil/Lehrer Productions&#x27; archives, documentaries, and projects, though not the company&#x27;s name. &quot;PBS NewsHour Weekend&quot; was not affected by the ownership transfer and continued to be produced by WNET.

On July 20, 2015, the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; introduced an overhauled visual appearance for its weekday broadcasts, debuting a new minimalist set designed by Eric Siegel and George Allison that heavily incorporates PBS&#x27;s longtime &quot;Everyman&quot; logo. The program also introduced a new graphics package by Troika Design Group and original theme music by Edd Kalehoff, which incorporates a reorchestration of the nine-note &quot;Question and Answer&quot; musical signature that has been featured in the program&#x27;s theme since its premiere in 1975 and a musical signature originally incorporated into the Kalehoff-composed theme for the &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot; used from 2002 to 2010. &quot;PBS NewsHour Weekend&quot; retained its original graphics package and the theme music by David Cebert and Bernard Hoffer until August 29, 2015, when it transitioned to the same theme music and a reworked version of the graphics package used for the weekday broadcasts.

Ifill took brief breaks from her &quot;NewsHour&quot; anchor duties in the late spring and in November 2016 (and was also absent from the program&#x27;s presidential election coverage on November 8), as she had been undergoing treatment for advanced stage breast and endometrial cancer. After her death was announced on November 14, 2016, that evening&#x27;s edition of the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; was dedicated to Ifill and her influence on journalism, featuring tributes from Woodruff, Sreenivasan, former colleagues and program contributors (news content was relegated to the standard news summary, which aired during the second half-hour). Although the program initially featured guest anchors on some editions between January and March 2017, Woodruff went on to become sole anchor.
In 2018, &quot;The Plastic Problem&quot; aired, which then went on to win a Peabody Award, presented at the 2019 awards ceremony.

On October 14, 2019, &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; launched &quot;&quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; West&quot;, a Western United States bureau at Arizona State University&#x27;s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication in Phoenix. Anchored by Stephanie Sy, the bureau produces its own news summary with up-to-date information on events that develop after the original broadcast. A version of the program with this summary is shown to viewers in the Western United States and to online and East Coast viewers watching re-broadcasts.

On April 2, 2022, WETA assumed production responsibilities for the &quot;NewsHour&quot;s Saturday and Sunday editions, which concurrently began originating from the studio at the station&#x27;s Washington facility used for the weekday broadcasts. The broadcasts were retitled &quot;PBS News Weekend&quot;, omitting &quot;NewsHour&quot; in view of their shorter duration. NewsHour Productions transferred production of the weekend broadcasts from WNET in a move to streamline the program&#x27;s production and news-gathering resources, allowing the weekday and weekend &quot;NewsHour&quot; broadcasts to have the same pool of correspondents and to share resources with &quot;Washington Week&quot; (which is also produced by WETA-TV). Coinciding with the move, the weekend editions began carrying feature segments covering culture and the arts. Sreenivasan (who remains a New York-based correspondent for the weekday broadcasts and serves as a contributor for the PBS late-night news program &quot;Amanpour &amp; Company&quot;) was replaced as weekend anchor by former NBC News and MSNBC correspondent Geoff Bennett. Then on December 8, 2022, &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; announced that John Yang will become an anchor in the weekend editions on December 31, 2022 (New Year&#x27;s Eve).

On May 13, 2022, Woodruff announced to &quot;NewsHour&quot; staffers that she would step down as anchor at the end of the year, though she intends to continue reporting longer pieces for the program while doing projects and specials for WETA through the 2024 United States presidential election at the earliest. Amna Nawaz and Geoff Bennett were named Woodruff&#x27;s successors. Woodruff made her final broadcast as anchor on December 30, 2022. Nawaz and Bennett anchored their first broadcast as co-anchors on January 2, 2023.

On December 15, 2023, PBS premiered &quot;PBS News Weekly&quot;, a digital-only half-hour weekly summary series of &quot;News Hour&quot; stories from the week, initially hosted by Nick Schifrin and broadcast on Fridays.

On June 10, 2024, &quot;PBS News Hour&quot; introduced a new logo and the new studio (still at WETA), now featuring the current PBS logo, and the logo and program&#x27;s text and graphics rendered in the system&#x27;s proprietary PBS Sans typeface family introduced in 2019. At the same time, the program&#x27;s longstanding use of camel case in its name was discontinued, with &quot;NewsHour&quot; becoming two words by one space, &quot;News Hour&quot;, in conjunction with the network&#x27;s rebranding of the news operation as PBS News.

==Production and ratings==

The program is notable for being shown on public television. There are no interruptions for advertisements (though like most public television programs, there are &quot;corporate image&quot; advertisements at the beginning and end of each broadcast, as well as barker interruptions asking viewers to donate to their local PBS member station or member network during locally produced pledge drives, which are replaced by encore presentations of a selected story segment from the past year for stations that are not holding a drive during that time).

The program has a more deliberate pace than the news broadcasts of the commercial networks it competes against, allowing for deeper detail in its story packages and feature segments. At the start of the program, the lead story is covered in depth, followed by a news summary that lasts roughly between six and eight minutes, briefly explaining many of the top national and international news headlines; international stories often include excerpts of reports filed by ITN correspondents. This is usually followed by three or four longer news segments, typically running six to twelve minutes, which explore a few of the events mentioned in the headline segment in depth and include discussions with experts, newsmakers, and/or commentators. The program formerly included a reflective essay on a regular basis, but these have been curtailed in recent years; since Woodruff and Ifill became anchors, these essays have mainly aired as part of the end-of-show segment &quot;Brief, but Spectacular&quot;.

On Fridays, the program features political analysis and discussion between two regular contributors, one from each of the Republican and Democratic parties, and one host from among the senior correspondents. Since January 2021, the usual participants have been &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Jonathan Capehart and &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist David Brooks. Analysts who fill in when Capehart or Brooks are absent have included David Gergen, Thomas Oliphant, Rich Lowry, William Kristol, Ramesh Ponnuru, Ruth Marcus, Michael Gerson, David Corn and E. J. Dionne. On Mondays, a similar segment, &quot;Politics Monday&quot;, features analysis and discussion of political issues with contributors Amy Walter, national editor of &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot;, and Tamara Keith, Washington, D.C. correspondent for NPR.

The program&#x27;s senior correspondents are Woodruff and Jeffrey Brown (Arts, Culture &amp; Society). Essayists have included Anne Taylor Fleming, Richard Rodriguez, Clarence Page and Roger Rosenblatt. Correspondents have been Tom Bearden, Betty Ann Bowser, Susan Dentzer, Elizabeth Farnsworth, Kwame Holman, Spencer Michels, Fred de Sam Lazaro, the economics correspondent Paul Solman (&quot;Making Sen$e&quot;), Malcolm Brabant and others.

Lehrer and Ifill were frequent moderators of U.S. political debates. By November 2008, Lehrer had moderated more than ten debates between major U.S. presidential candidates. In 2008, Ifill moderated a debate between U.S. vice presidential candidates Joe Biden and Sarah Palin; in 2004, she moderated a debate between candidates Dick Cheney and John Edwards.

According to Nielsen ratings at the program&#x27;s website, 2.7 million people watch the program each night, and 8 million watch in the course of a week.

On March 31, 2003, after the U.S.–led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the &quot;PBS News Hour&quot; began what it called its &quot;Honor Roll&quot;, a short segment displaying in silence the picture, name, rank, and hometown of U.S. military personnel killed in Iraq. On January 4, 2006, military personnel killed in Afghanistan were added to the segment. &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; aired the final honor roll segment on August 30, 2021, after the end of War in Afghanistan.

==Availability==

The &quot;PBS News Hour&quot; is broadcast on more than 350 PBS member stations and member networks, making it available to 99% of the viewing public, and audio from the program is broadcast by some NPR radio stations. It is also rebroadcast twice daily in late night via American Public Television&#x27;s World digital subchannel service. Broadcasts of the &quot;PBS News Hour&quot; are also made available worldwide via satellites operated by various agencies such as the Voice of America.

A limited number of PBS member stations and regional member networks do not clear the &quot;PBS News Hour&quot; on their schedules due to existing carriage on a &quot;primary&quot; PBS member station, a pool mainly confined to &quot;secondary&quot; stations (most of which participate in the service&#x27;s Program Differentiation Plan) that share certain media markets with a &quot;primary&quot; member outlet. These include the NJ PBS network in New Jersey (as WNET, which co-manages NJ PBS and WLIW, carries the program in the New York City area, the latter airing the program live, while WHYY-TV does so in the Philadelphia market); KVCR-DT in San Bernardino, California; KCET in Los Angeles (KOCE-TV in Huntington Beach, which shares ownership with KCET through parent Public Media Group of Southern California and is the primary PBS member in the region, serves as the program&#x27;s carrier in the Los Angeles market); and WYIN in Gary, Indiana (WTTW, the primary PBS station for the Chicago DMA that includes WYIN&#x27;s Northwest Indiana service area, serves as the program&#x27;s carrier in the Chicago market). In Boston, WGBH-TV airs the program live each weeknight (with a simulcast online), while its secondary station WGBX rebroadcasts the weekday editions later the same evening, and the weekend editions live; a similar case exists in New York City but in reverse, where WLIW airs the weekday and weekend editions of the &quot;PBS News Hour&quot; live while WNET airs them on a tape delay (delayed by one hour on weekday editions and by a half-hour on weekends). KQED in San Francisco airs the program each weeknight in simulcast with its radio sister at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time (6:00 p.m. Eastern Time), in addition to airing the Western Edition on television at 6:00 p.m. PT. Unusually for many years, the secondary station of Milwaukee PBS, WMVT, carried the program as part of an early-evening news block with the &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot; (which was the lead-in to &quot;News Hour&quot; on many member stations until that program ceased production in December 2019), and half-hour international newscasts from Deutsche Welle and BBC World News, due to an expanded schedule of PBS Kids and local-interest programming on WMVS; this has since been rectified with the launch of the all-hours PBS Kids subchannel network.

Archives of shows broadcast after February 7, 2000, are available in several streaming media formats (including full-motion video) at the program&#x27;s website. The show is available to overseas military personnel on the American Forces Network. Audio from selected segments is also released in podcast form, available through several feeds on the &quot;PBS News Hour&quot;″s subscriptions page with link to a FeedBurner website (for free mp3 download) and through podcast services such as Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, and among others.

===Livestreaming===

The &quot;PBS News Hour&quot; is streamed live on the program&#x27;s YouTube channel at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time each weeknight, with the Western edition also streaming live at 9:00 p.m. ET (6:00 p.m. Pacific Time). &quot;PBS News Weekend&quot; is also streamed on the YouTube channel live Saturdays and Sundays at 5:00 p.m. ET. Full episodes are available later on the &quot;PBS News&quot; YouTube channel and on the program&#x27;s dedicated page on PBS&#x27;s website.

The &quot;News Hour&quot; was also livestreamed on Ustream until IBM Watson Media discontinued free livesteraming on the platform on September 17, 2018. The &quot;News Hour&quot; has also provided livestreaming of special events, most notably streaming the January 2017 inauguration of Donald Trump on the program&#x27;s Twitter account.

==&quot;PBS News Hour&quot; editorial guidelines==
On December 4, 2009, when introducing the new &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; format, Lehrer read a list of guidelines for what he called &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer journalism&quot;:
* &quot;Do nothing I cannot defend.&quot;
* &quot;Cover, write, and present every story with the care I would want if the story were about me.&quot;
* &quot;Assume there is at least one other side or version to every story.&quot;
* &quot;Assume the viewer is as smart and as caring and as good a person as I am.&quot;
* &quot;Assume the same about all people on whom I report.&quot;
* &quot;Assume personal lives are a private matter until a legitimate turn in the story absolutely mandates otherwise.&quot;
* &quot;Carefully separate opinion and analysis from straight news stories, and clearly label everything.&quot;
* &quot;Do not use anonymous sources or blind quotes except on rare and monumental occasions.&quot;
* &quot;No one should ever be allowed to attack another anonymously.&quot;
* &quot;And finally, I am not in the entertainment business.&quot;

== Criticism and reception ==
In 1992, radio broadcaster David Barsamian called the &quot;NewsHour&quot; &quot;stenographers to power&quot;, accusing them and other news media of having a pro-establishment bias.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;PBS News Hour&quot; has received generally positive reviews from television critics and parents of young children. Patrick Kevin Day of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are making history on PBS.&quot; David Leonard and Micah Schwalb of &quot;The Denver Post&quot; wrote, &quot;One of the most trusted news programs on television.&quot; Phil Owen of &quot;TheWrap&quot; wrote, &quot;The least partisan analysis.&quot; Tim Surette of &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote, &quot;The calm and credible information we need.&quot; Jennifer Gerson of &quot;The 19th&quot; wrote, &quot;Nawaz is stepping into history.&quot;

In 2003, UCLA political scientist Tim Groseclose and Missouri economist Jeff Milyo evaluated various media programs based on &quot;think tank&quot; citations to map liberal versus conservative media slants and published a study alleging liberal media bias in general. Based on their research, &quot;PBS News Hour&quot; is the most centrist news program on television and the closest to a truly objective stance. However, their methodology has been questioned.

===FAIR study===
In October 2006, the media criticism group Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) accused the &quot;PBS News Hour&quot; of lacking balance, diversity, and viewpoints of the general public, and for presenting corporate viewpoints. FAIR found that the &quot;PBS News Hour&quot;″s guest list from October 2005 to March 2006 had Republicans outnumbering Democrats 2–1, and minorities accounting for 15 percent of U.S.-based sources. FAIR also protested in 1995 when Liberty Media purchased a majority of the program, citing Liberty&#x27;s majority owner, John Malone, for his &quot;Machiavellian business tactics&quot; and right-wing sentiments.

&quot;News Hour&quot; executive producer Linda Winslow responded to many aspects:

She also accused FAIR of counting sound bites as interviews, thereby skewing their numbers toward the political party holding a majority (at the time of FAIR&#x27;s report, Republican Party).

==Partnership with NPR==
The &quot;PBS News Hour&quot; partnered with NPR for the broadcast of the Republican and Democratic National Conventions of 2016, in a strategy to prepare for the election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

<text>Merthyr Tydfil Football Club was a Welsh football club based at the Penydarren Park ground in Merthyr Tydfil. In 2010 the club was liquidated and reformed under the name Merthyr Town, which was accepted into Division One of the Western League.

==History==

The club was formed in 1945, and joined the Welsh League. In their first season, they finished as runners-up, and joined the Southern League. The club were immensely successful in their first few seasons, winning the championship in 1947–48, 1949–50, 1950–51, 1951–52 and 1953–54. In the 1947–48 championship-winning season, Merthyr only dropped one point at home (against Colchester United) and only lost four games all season. However, despite their success, the club failed to be elected to the English Football League. The 1950–51 season ended with Merthyr winning the Southern League, the Welsh Cup, the Southern League Cup and the Welsh Challenge Cup.

After bouncing between the various Southern League divisions during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the club finally won their sixth championship in 1988–89, making them joint Southern League title record-holders together with Southampton. This time, winning the championship meant promotion to the Football Conference, the fifth level of English football. The club finished ninth in their first two seasons, and then fourth. However, they then went into decline, and were relegated back to the Southern League in 1995, where they remained until reforming in 2010. They should have been relegated a season earlier, but were reprieved when Northern Premier League champions Marine failed to meet the stadium criteria for the league.
The club&#x27;s best FA Cup performance was reaching the second round, which they managed in 1946–47 (losing 3–1 to Reading), 1954–55 (losing 7–1 to Bradford City), 1973–74 (losing 3–0 to Hendon), 1979–80 (losing 3–1 in a replay with Chesham United) and 1990–91 (losing 5–1 to Woking). The only time the club managed to defeat a Football League club in the FA Cup was in the first round of the 1946–47 cup, when they beat Bristol Rovers 3–1.

The club were considerably more successful in the Welsh Cup, which they won on three occasions: 1949 (beating Swansea Town 2–0), 1951 (beating Cardiff City 3–2 in a replay) and 1987 (beating Newport County 1–0 in a replay). In addition, the club finished as runners-up in 1947 and 1952.

After winning the final in 1987, the club were allowed to enter the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, at a time when English clubs were banned from European competition. In the first round, they were drawn against the Italian club Atalanta. The club managed a win in the first leg at home, beating the Italians 2–1. However, the return leg was lost 2–0, and the club was eliminated from the competition.
