<text>Hombres G (&quot;G-Men&quot;) is a Spanish pop rock band, formed in Madrid in 1983. They are widely considered one of Spain&#x27;s most prominent pop groups of the 1980s and early 1990s. The band consists of lead vocalist and bassist David Summers, lead guitarist Rafael Gutierrez, rhythm guitarist and pianist Dani Mezquita, and drummer Javi Molina 

Hombres G made their live debut at Madrid&#x27;s Rock-Ola in 1983. Their sound was influenced by the early Beatles and the British new wave movement. They found commercial success with the release of &quot;Hombres G&quot; (1985) and the song &quot;Devuélveme a mi chica&quot;. The youthful and adolescent nature of their music attracted a large audience, both at home and abroad – thousands covered the Gran Vía Madrileña during the release of their two films and Lima&#x27;s Jorge Chávez International Airport was nearly closed due to the 20,000 fans that congregated on the landing runway during their first visit to Perú.

The group&#x27;s sound began to expand and show more adult concerns with the albums &quot;Voy a pasármelo bien&quot; (1989) and &quot;Ésta es tu vida&quot; (1990). Hombres G went on hiatus after the release of their 1992 album, &quot;Historia del bikini&quot;. David pursued a solo career, Rafa and Dani remained involved in the music industry, and Javi devoted time to his bar in Madrid.

The group reconvened in 2002 and released &quot;Peligrosamente Juntos&quot;, a collection of new material, demos, and hits. Hombres G also embarked on an international tour. In 2003, a variety of groups paid tribute to them – &quot;Voy a pasármelo bien, un tributo a Hombres G&quot; was released in Europe and &quot;¿Qué te pasa? Estás borracho: Un tributo a Hombres G&quot; in the Americas.

&quot;Todo esto es muy extraño&quot; (2004) was the first studio album released after the end of their hiatus. The following year they completed a sold-out tour with the Spanish pop rock band El Canto del Loco. Their next album, &quot;10&quot; (2007), received a nomination at the 2008 Latin Grammy Awards. Since then, they&#x27;ve released &quot;Desayuno continental&quot; (2010), &quot;En la playa&quot; (2011), &quot;30 años y un día&quot; (2015), y &quot;Resurrección&quot; (2019).

==History==

===Formation and the first singles (1982–1983)===

Rafael Gutiérrez Muñoz and David Summers Rodríguez met in the hallways of Televisión Española by mere coincidence in 1982; they were participants in the show &quot;Aplauso&quot;.

Rafael&#x27;s brother, Felipe, played bass in the rock band Tequila, but they&#x27;d recently dissolved. Rafa saw no definite role in the groups he had been part of: Plástico (a group formed with Toti Árboles and Eduardo Benavente, who later became involved with Alaska y los Pegamoides), , and Los Zombies de Bernardo Bonezzi.

David knew how to play clarinet, an instrument he studied due to his admiration for clarinetist Benny Goodman. Rafa asked David to play clarinet in the new group he was forming with his brother Felipe.

However, David was already committed to forming a group with his two childhood friends, Daniel Mezquita Hardy and Francisco Javier de Molina Burgos. The three were classmates at the Facultad de Ciencias de la Información de Madrid. They&#x27;d been playing months prior under the names &quot;Los Residuos&quot; and &quot;La Burguesía Revolucionaria&quot;. 
David welcomed Rafa&#x27;s invitation to play music together, but instead asked him to play guitar with him, Dani, and Javi. Rafa accepted. They discarded their first idea of a name, &quot;Bonitos Redford&quot;, and found inspiration in the 1935 James Cagney crime film &quot;G Men&quot;, which in Spain aired as &quot;Contra el imperio del crimen&quot;. In the film, the G-Men were agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Hombres G joined the independent recording company, Lollipop, who in 1983 released their first two singles: &quot;Milagro en el Congo / Venezia&quot; and &quot;Marta tiene un marcapasos / La cagaste, Burt Lancaster&quot;. Assisting in the recording process were Fernando Cabello (sax) and two friends of the group, Eva Dalda and Lydia Iovanne.

The group&#x27;s early sound was reminiscent of La Movida Madrileña and shared similarities with , Los Ejecutivos Agresivos, Los Nikis, and Alaska y los Pegamoides. The rhythm and speed of the group&#x27;s songs was also inspired by the sound of the American rock band, The Ramones.

===Live debut, a new recording contract, and the first album (1984)===
Hombres G made their live debut at Madrid&#x27;s Rock-Ola in 1983. Lollipop encountered financial difficulties and was unable to support the band beginning in early 1984.

Not long after, the group was interviewed by Radio España with the purpose of promoting one of their performances. That is where they met Paco Martín, recent founder of the recording company, Twins. Ricardo Chirinos, vocalist of Pistones, had suggested the group to Martín. After listening to the interview and viewing the concert later that night, Martín was convinced that Hombres G was the group that he and fellow founder Pepe Escribano were looking for. He talked with the group after the show and the contract was set to be signed the next day.

Recording on their debut album, &quot;Hombres G&quot;, commenced two weeks later at Trak studios under producer Paco Trinidad. Included in the album were a new version of &quot;Venezia&quot; and &quot;Devuélveme a mi chica&quot;. The album featured two covers: &quot;No lloraré&quot;, based on &quot;I Never Cry&quot; by Alice Cooper, and &quot;Sin Ti&quot;, a remake of the song &quot;Reality&quot; by Romanian composer Vladimir Cosma. The album contained a very accessible pop sound, enjoyable lyrics, and youthful romanticism. The front cover is a still from the 1963 American science fiction comedy, &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;.

A few weeks later, it seemed &quot;Hombres G&quot; was not going to enjoy commercial success. Escribano became impatient and abandoned the company. Two weeks later, radio support and album sales increased. Six months later, the album reached 50,000 copies and a year later: 150,000. Sales eventually reached the millions.

===Popularity and promotion (1985)===
Hombres G experienced increasing popularity. Their first performance at the Gran Musical de la Cadena SER was scheduled for noon, as was the tradition. However, fans began to congregate at the front door beginning at 4 in the morning.

The group made over 100 performances in 1985, in addition to television appearances and promotion in youth magazines. Many of their fans were female adolescents and the group found itself increasingly pressured, for they could no longer stroll through the streets of any Spanish city without hordes of girls following them.

===The second album and distribution throughout the Americas (1986)===
The group returned to Trak studios in February 1986 to begin recording their second album, &quot;La cagaste... Burt Lancaster&quot; (You Fucked Up... Burt Lancaster; named after one of their first songs). 60,000 copies of the album were ordered a month before its release. Hombres G salvaged one of the songs from the Lollipop era, &quot;Marta tiene un marcapasos&quot; – the single went on to top the sales charts in Spain. The album&#x27;s sound has been described as less punk and more new wave than its predecessor. It made use of ska rhythms (&quot;Visite Nuestro Bar&quot;) and was influenced by the slow sounds of the 1960s (&quot;Te quiero&quot; &amp; &quot;Un par de palabras&quot;). The cover of the album featured an image of the American actor, Burt Lancaster, continuing Hombres G&#x27;s string of references to American cinema.

Their second album was even more successful than the first. The group began to receive proclamations of love, letters written in blood, and others in which the senders threatened suicide if they couldn&#x27;t have a date with the group. One fan from Zaragoza sent more than 200 individually numbered letters.

That summer, Hombres G went on tour, which included a performance at the Madrilenian bull arena Las Ventas, where the public began to congregate outside the venue beginning at 8 in the evening of the day before.

With a consolidated market in Spain, Paco Martín placed his bet on taking the group to the Americas. He sent copies of their albums to companies across the American continent, receiving the first response from the Peruvian offices of CBS. &quot;Hombres G&quot; was edited in Peru in mid-1986, and in a few weeks, the album surpassed 50,000 copies. &quot;La cagaste… Burt Lancaster&quot; was published later, but received a similar response. The next phone call was from the central offices of CBS in New York, to distribute Hombres G throughout all of America. Hombres G found success in Mexico and Venezuela, where their albums obtained gold and platinum certification. Following the summer of 1986, sales of their first two albums reached nearly a million copies in Spain.

In December 1986, the group was invited to attend the gala of the Bravo Awards. The group was nominated in three categories and won &quot;Mejor Agrupación de Habla Hispana&quot; (Best Spanish Speaking Group).

===Release of the first film and third album (1986–1987)===

David&#x27;s father, Manuel Summers, was one of the most popular comedy film directors in Spain. The group received the offer to star in an autobiographic film. The result was &quot;Sufre mamón&quot;, a movie filmed in Ibiza and Madrid, and which was set to premiere in March 1987.

Once filming was finished, Hombres G began to work on their third album. The group didn&#x27;t have much time to write new compositions, but the fast and tight lifestyle that they&#x27;d recently experienced served as inspiration. David isolated himself for a week at a cottage his family owned in Huelva, writing 12 compositions. For the next 15 days, the group finished work on the songs. A week later, Hombres G left for Manchester with Chilean producer Carlos Narea, and recorded &quot;Estamos locos... ¿o qué?&quot; (Are We Crazy... Or What?). The album featured a variety of sounds, including songs based on very rapid rhythms (such as &quot;No, no… no&quot;) and more traditional rock influences (such as &quot;Y cayó la bomba (fétida)&quot; ). The themes of the lyrics concerned romance, intimacy, and masochistic tendencies.

The release of the album coincided with the release of their first film. When the film premiered, it caused the collapse of the Gran Via Madrileña, where nearly 10,000 fans crowded the streets. When the group arrived, dozens of journalists and graphic reporters attempted to obtain snapshots. For security reasons, the four found themselves obligated to remain inside one room for several hours, and were unable to view the film until much later. Their assistants faced a similar scenario: even though they were able to gain entrance to the screening, they were unable to hear it due to the deafening murmur originating from the street and the constant singing of the fans watching the film.

===Tours in Spain and the American continent (1987)===
Endorsed by the fervor of their popularity, the group embarked on a tour of 60 performances across the bull rings and soccer stadiums of the most important Spanish cities. That summer, nearly one million people saw Hombres G live.

In October, the group performed in America for the very first time, touring Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia, the United States, and Mexico. When they arrived in Peru, the airplane windows revealed a crowd of more than 20,000 people spread across the landing runway of the Jorge Chávez International Airport. The plane commander refused to open the doors until he knew what was happening. Banners welcoming Hombres G could be seen everywhere.

The group was protected by four security guards at every hotel they lodged in, in order to prevent fans from seeping into their rooms – though one fan managed to accomplish the feat.

After visiting Peru and Chile, Hombres G visited Ecuador. They performed twice for audiences of 40,000 at each show. Their stay in the Americas amounted to two months of intense promotional activity.

===A break, the second film, and the fourth album (1988)===
Hombres G enjoyed their first break in three years at the end of 1987. David took advantage of the tranquility of Christmas to compose new material.

A new film project was launched under Manolo Summers in 1988. Filming began in March. Locations included Spain, Acapulco, and Puerto Vallarta. The movie was to be titled &quot;La cagaste Burt Lancaster&quot; but the actor Burt Lancaster threatened legal action; the name was changed to &quot;Suéltate el pelo&quot;. One of the film&#x27;s actresses was Mexican singer Tatiana Palacios, and it is rumored that she and Gutiérrez dated while the movie was being filmed.

Hombres G recorded &quot;Agitar antes de usar&quot; (Shake Before Using) between February and March 1988. The music on the album fit the categories of pop rock, rock and roll, and ballad and spawned the commercially successful single, &quot;Suéltate el pelo&quot;.

Both the movie and album were released almost simultaneously, right before the summer season. Hombres G toured Spain and the American continent once again, placing special emphasis on Mexico. At this time, sales of all their albums totaled more than 2 million copies in Mexico. Sales in the smaller Spanish market were half of that figure, but Hombres G had already become the best selling band of the decade.

In September 1988, the group performed at the &quot;Concierto de Conciertos&quot; in Bogotá, Colombia. The show was a mega concert that spanned several days and featured a variety of artists. Among the performers were Miguel Mateos, Franco de Vita, Los Prisioneros, Timbiriche, José Feliciano, and Los Toreros Muertos. It was there that a radio announcer baptized Hombres G as the Latin Beatles.

===An evolving sound and a farewell (1989–1992)===
&quot;Voy a pasármelo bien&quot; (I&#x27;m Going to Have A Good Time) was released in 1989. The group felt less pressured when composing songs for the album and their music showed a departure from the adolescent concerns of their previous works. Their image began to reflect a more adult world. The album continued the group&#x27;s pop rock sound, but showed new influences. The song &quot;Aprendiendo a caer&quot;, made use of bossa nova and &quot;Madrid, Madrid&quot; has been compared to Frank Sinatra&#x27;s music. The group toured both sides of the Atlantic with a new perspective.

Hombres G recorded &quot;Ésta es tu vida&quot; (This Is Your Life) in the summer of 1990 in Madrid and London. Their sixth studio album contained more profound lyrics and a more sophisticated sound; it featured music performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. During this period Summers and Mezquita composed several songs for artist Luz Casal, including the ballad &quot;Te Dejé Marchar&quot;.

That same year, Dani Mezquita married Elena Portables. On January 18, 1992, Summers married his longtime girlfriend, Marta Madruga.

Hombres G bid farewell on May 20, 1992, with their seventh album, &quot;Historia del bikini&quot; (History of the Bikini). Production was completed by Colin Fairley, whose experience included working with artists Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe.

===Hiatus (1992–2002)===
Following the release of their seventh album were various compilation records such as &quot;Los singles 1984–1993&quot; and &quot;Las Baladas&quot;, but they never offered new material.

Over the following years, all members of the group remained involved in music. Summers pursued a solo career, touring Spain and the Americas and releasing four albums. Manuel Summers died before the release of &quot;David Summers&quot;; as a result, the album was dedicated to him. Rafa performed with other musicians and participated in the first album by Ella Baila Sola. He also formed a group called &quot;Rafa &amp; Co.&quot; who released a self-titled album in 1996. Dani became a marketing director for the record company DRO East West. Javier cared for his Pop&#x27;n&#x27;Roll bar in Madrid, playing drums now and then for the groups he invited to perform.

===Career comeback and tributes (2002–2004)===
After their extended break, Hombres G returned with new material. In 2002 they released &quot;Peligrosamente Juntos&quot; (Dangerously together), an album that included hits, demos, and five new songs. The version released in America contained the new songs &quot;Lo noto&quot; and &quot;En otro mundo&quot;. The European version contained the mentioned songs and also contained &quot;Intimidad&quot;, &quot;No te escaparás&quot; and &quot;Te vi&quot;.

At the end of 2003, Spanish pop groups such as El Canto del Loco, , Antonio Vega, Los Secretos, Mikel Erentxun, , Álex Ubago and , united to make a tribute album to Hombres G. The album &quot;Voy a pasármelo bien, un tributo a Hombres G&quot; (I&#x27;m going to have a good time, a tribute to Hombres G), contained cover versions of classic Hombres G singles. Another tribute was made in America with groups such as División Minúscula, Moderatto and La Quinta Estación.

In 2004, their first two films were released in DVD format in a pack called &quot;Hombres G – Las películas&quot; (Hombres G – The Movies), also including extras. That same year, Hombres G released &quot;El año que vivimos peligrosamente&quot; (The year that we lived dangerously). It included live versions of songs from their &quot;Peligrosamente Juntos&quot; tour.

===&quot;Todo esto es muy extraño&quot; and tour (2004–2007)===
For the first time in over twelve years, Hombres G released a new studio album entitled &quot;Todo esto es muy extraño&quot; (This is all very strange) in 2004. The album was produced by Nigel Walker and contained 11 new songs. The release marked the return of Hombres G to the music scene. The first single off the album was &quot;¿Por qué no ser amigos?&quot; which featured the frontman from the Spanish pop/rock band El canto del loco. &quot;No lo sé&quot; and &quot;¿Qué soy yo para tí?&quot; were the other singles released off the album.

Hombres G embarked on numerous tours throughout Spain, Latin America, and the United States in support of this album. The album had minimal diffusion in the Americas.

===&quot;10&quot; and tour (2007–2009)===
On September 18, 2007, Hombres G released their tenth album &quot;10&quot;, which contained 11 new songs. The album spawned two singles: &quot;Me Siento Bien&quot; and &quot;Hombre Real&quot;.

&quot;10&quot; is described as tuning into the &quot;raw energy of early rock&quot; and hinting at Euro-rock and at the &quot;atmospheric aesthetic favored by Coldplay and the legendary U2&quot; by AllMusic.

Hombres G toured Spain and the Americas in support of &quot;10&quot;. One of their performances included a benefit show for the victims of the 2007 Peruvian earthquake.

The album was nominated for &quot;Best Pop Album By A Duo or Group With Vocal&quot; at the 2008 Latin Grammy Awards.

===New Phase and &quot;Desayuno Continental&quot; (2009–present)===
Hombres G finished off support for their tenth album and announced the beginning of a new phase in which Internet technology would play a major role in their music. Instead of immediately releasing a traditional album, Hombres G released a single and music video entitled &quot;Separados&quot;, exclusively through their official website. Furthermore, they performed the songs &quot;Desayuno Continental&quot; and &quot;No Puedo Soportar Perderte&quot;, in addition to &quot;Separados&quot;, to a small audience at their own Pop&#x27;n&#x27;Roll bar in Madrid.

Hombres G&#x27;s transition into modern Internet technology was also marked by their acquisition of Facebook and Twitter accounts and their use of those as main information outlets. The Spanish website Popes80 christened them &quot;Hombres G 2.0&quot;. In addition, &quot;Separados&quot; attained the number one spot on Popes80&#x27;s Top 20 Hits chart on the week of October 6, 2009.

The name of Hombres G&#x27;s new studio album was announced on September 23, 2010: &quot;Desayuno Continental&quot;. They presented it on November 9, 2010, at la Riviera de Madrid. The first single released from the album was &quot;El Secreto de Vivir&quot;. In 2018, the group announced a joint US tour with the Argentinian band Enanitos Verdes.

<text>John Harington Gubbins (24 January 1852 – 23 February 1929) was a British linguist, consular official and diplomat. He was the father of Sir Colin McVean Gubbins.

==Education==
Gubbins attended Harrow School and would have gone on to Cambridge University, had family finances allowed.

==Career==

Gubbins was appointed a student interpreter in the British Japan Consular Service in 1871. He was English Secretary to the Conference at Tokyo for the Revision of the Treaties, after Ernest Satow left Japan in 1883. On 1 June 1889, he was appointed Japanese Secretary in Tokyo.

He was employed in London at the Foreign Office from February to July 1894 in the Aoki-Kimberley negotiations which resulted in the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation (16 July 1894). He was appointed CMG in the 1898 Birthday Honours.

He was, especially in retirement, a close friend of Satow. He was elected the first President of the newly founded Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch in 1900.

Despite having no university degree, Gubbins was awarded an honorary master&#x27;s degree from Balliol College and was made Lecturer in Japanese language at Oxford University (1909–12). Lack of pupils led to his position being terminated.

==Family==
Gubbins frequently visited Colin Alexander McVean at his residence in Yamato Yashiki, Tokyo in the 1870s, and met McVean&#x27;s daughter Helen. After McVean returned to Scotland and settled down on the Isle of Mull, Gubbins visited the McVean family and met Helen again. 41-year-old Gubbins and 24-year-old Helen fell in love and were married in Newington, Scotland, in 1894, then lived in Japan. They had four children, who spent much time with the McVeans on the Isle of Mull. The second son was Colin McVean Gubbins, later chief of the Special Operations Executive.

<doc id="656154" wikidata="Q706679" url="?curid=656154" title="Duchy of Bar">
<text>The County of Bar, later Duchy of Bar, was a principality of the Holy Roman Empire encompassing the &quot;pays de Barrois&quot; and centred on the city of Bar-le-Duc. It was held by the House of Montbéliard from the 11th century. Part of the county, the so-called &quot;Barrois mouvant&quot;, became a fief of the Kingdom of France in 1301 and was elevated to a duchy in 1354. The &quot;Barrois non-mouvant&quot; remained a part of the Empire. From 1480, it was united to the imperial Duchy of Lorraine.

Both imperial Bar and Lorraine came under the influence of France in 1735, with Bar ceded to the deposed king of Poland, Stanisław Leszczyński. According to the Treaty of Vienna (1738), the duchy would pass to the French crown upon Stanisław&#x27;s death, which occurred in 1766.

==County (1033–1354)==
The county of Bar originated in the frontier fortress of Bar (from Latin &quot;barra&quot;, barrier) that Duke Frederick I of Upper Lorraine built on the bank of the river Ornain around 960. The fortress was originally directed at the counts of Champagne, who had made incursions into Frederick&#x27;s allodial lands. Frederick also confiscated some lands from the nearby Abbey of Saint-Mihiel and settled his knights on it. The original &quot;Barrois&quot; was thus a mixture of the duke&#x27;s allodial lands and confiscated church lands enfeoffed to knights. On the death of Duke Frederick III in 1033, these lands passed to his sister, Sophia (died 1093), who was the first person to associate the comital title with Bar, styling herself &quot;Countess of Bar&quot;.

Sophia&#x27;s descendants, of the House of Montbéliard, expanded Bar &quot;by usurpation, conquest, purchase, and marriage&quot; into a &quot;de facto&quot; autonomous state perched between France and Germany. Its population was francophone and culturally French, and the counts were involved in French politics. Count Reginald II (died 1170) married Agnes, a sister of the queen of France, Adele. His son, Henry I, died on the Third Crusade in 1190. From 1214 to 1291 Bar was ruled by Henry II and Theobald II, who secured the western frontier with Champagne by granting fiefs to French nobles and buying their homage.

In 1297 King Philip IV of France invaded the Barrois because Count Henry III had given aid to his father-in-law, Edward I of England, when the latter intervened against France in the Franco-Flemish War. In the Treaty of Bruges of 1301 Henry was forced to recognise all of his county west of the river Meuse as a fief of France. This was the origin of the &quot;Barrois mouvant&quot;: a territory that was turned into a fief was said to have &quot;moved&quot; and entered the &quot;mouvance&quot; of its suzerain. It was subject to the Parliament of Paris. The Treaty of Bruges did not represent any expansion of French territory. The territory to the west of the Meuse was French since the Treaty of Verdun of 843, but in 1301 it became a direct fief of the crown, including its allodial parts.


==Medieval duchy (1354–1508)==
In 1354 the Count of Bar took the ducal title and was thereafter recognised as a Peer of France. Père Anselme (died 1694) believed that Count Robert had been created a duke by King John II of France in preparation for the count&#x27;s marriage to John&#x27;s daughter, Mary. The rulers of Bar were not created dukes by imperial appointment. The only title Count Robert received by imperial grant in 1354 was that of Margrave of Pont-à-Mousson. This margraviate was frequently bestowed by the Dukes of Bar on their heirs apparent. In that same year the emperor raised the County of Luxembourg into a duchy and Bar fell between two duchies, Luxembourg and Upper Lorraine. The ducal title was eventually accepted by the emperors, however, and the imperial tax register of 1532 records the &quot;Duchy on the Meuse&quot; () as a voting member of the .

In 1430 the last duke of the male line of the ruling house, Louis, died. Bar passed to his great-nephew, René I, who was married to Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine. In 1431 the couple inherited Lorraine. On René&#x27;s death in 1480, Bar passed to his daughter Yolanda and her son, René II, who was already Duke of Lorraine. In 1482 he conquered the of Virton, a part of the Duchy of Luxembourg, and annexed it to Bar. In 1484 Peter II, Duke of Bourbon, regent for King Charles VIII of France, formally installed him in the Duchy of Bar. In his final testament published in 1506, René decreed that the two duchies of Bar and Lorraine should never be separated. The two duchies remained joined in personal union permanently.

==Modern duchy (1508–1766)==
On 2 October 1735 the preliminary Treaty of Vienna between France and the Empire was drawn up, ending the War of the Polish Succession and granting Bar and Lorraine to the deposed king of Poland, Stanislaus Leszczynski. It was agreed that he should receive Bar immediately, but for Lorraine he had to wait until the death of Grand Duke Gian Gastone of Tuscany (which took place on 9 July 1737), so that the deposed duke of Lorraine could inherit Tuscany. In January 1736, Stanislaus formally renounced his claim to the Polish throne (although he was allowed to retain the royal title). In August, France and the Empire finalized their agreement concerning the exchange of territories. The emperor renounced his suzerainty over Bar and Lorraine.

On 30 September 1736, Stanislaus signed a convention, known as the Declaration of Meudon, whereby the French king would appoint the governor of Lorraine. On 8 February 1737, Stanislaus took possession of Bar and on 21 March of Lorraine. On 18 November 1738, the final Treaty of Vienna was signed. Stanislaus turned over the incomes from Bar and Lorraine to the French crown in exchange for a generous pension, which he used to fund construction projects in the duchies. On his death on 23 February 1766 the duchies passed to the royal domain of France as per the treaty.

<text>Henry (Portuguese: &quot;Henrique&quot;, French: &quot;Henri&quot;; 1066 – 22 May 1112), Count of Portugal, was the first member of the Capetian House of Burgundy to rule Portugal and the father of the country&#x27;s first king, Afonso Henriques.

== Biographical sketch ==

===Family relations ===
Born in about 1066 in Dijon, Duchy of Burgundy, Count Henry was the youngest son of Henry, the second son of Robert I, Duke of Burgundy. His two older brothers, Hugh I and Odo I, inherited the duchy. No contemporary record of his mother has survived. She was once thought to have been named Sibylla based on an undated obituary reporting the death of &quot;Sibilla, mater ducus Burgundie&quot; (Sibylla, mother of the Duke of Burgundy), under the reasoning that she was not called duchess herself and hence must have been the wife of Henry, the only father of a duke who never himself held the ducal title, yet this was probably a reference to her daughter-in-law, Sibylla, mother of the then-reigning Hugh II. Historian Jean Richard suggested that she might instead have been called Clémence. Whatever her name, her son Henry was kinsman (&quot;congermanus&quot;) of his brother-in-law, Raymond of Burgundy, and this relationship may have come through either, or both, of their mothers, who are both of undocumented parentage. It has been suggested that Henry&#x27;s mother may have been the daughter of Reginald I, which would make her the maternal aunt of Raymond who would then be Henry&#x27;s first cousin. This solution is problematic, as Henry&#x27;s brother Odo I, Duke of Burgundy married Raymond&#x27;s sister, Sibylla, and though marriages between close kin sometimes took place through dispensation, the prohibition against first-cousin marriages in church law makes it likely that the relationship between Odo and Sibylla, and hence that between Henry and Raymond, was more distant. Based on the relationship between Henry and Raymond and the apparent introduction of the byname &quot;Borel&quot; into the family of the dukes of Burgundy through this marriage, genealogist Szabolcs de Vajay suggested Henry&#x27;s mother was a daughter of Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Barcelona, and his wife Guisla de Lluçà.

One of his paternal aunts was Constance of Burgundy, the wife of Alfonso VI of León, and one of his great-uncles was Hugh, Abbot of Cluny, one of the most influential and venerated personalities of his time. Count Henry&#x27;s family was very powerful and governed many cities in France such as Chalon, Auxerre, Autun, Nevers, Dijon, Mâcon and Semur.

=== Reconquista ===

After the defeat of the Christian troops in the Battle of Sagrajas in October 1086, in the early months of the following year, King Alfonso VI appealed for aid from Christians at the other side of the Pyrenees. Many French nobles and soldiers heeded the call, including Raymond of Burgundy, Odo I (Henry&#x27;s brother), and Raymond of St. Gilles. Not all of them arrived at the same time in the Iberian Peninsula and it is most likely that Raymond of Burgundy came in 1091. Although some authors claim that Count Henry came with the expedition which arrived in 1087, even though &quot;documentary evidence here is much more slight&quot;, his presence is confirmed only as of 1096 when he appears confirming the &quot;forais&quot; of Guimarães and Constantim de Panoias.

Three of these French nobles married daughters of King Alfonso VI: Raymond of Burgundy married &quot;infanta&quot; Urraca, later Queen Urraca of León; Raymond of St. Gilles married Elvira; and Henry of Burgundy married Teresa of León, illegitimate daughter, as her sister Elvira, of the king and his mistress Jimena Muñoz.

=== Pact with his cousin Raymond of Burgundy ===
Between the years 1096 and 1105, count Raymond, seeing that his influence in the &quot;curia regis&quot; was diminishing, reached an agreement with his cousin Henry of Burgundy. The birth of King Alfonso&#x27;s only son, Sancho Alfónsez, was also perceived as a threat by the two cousins. They agreed to share power, the royal treasury, and to support each other. Under this agreement, which counted with the blessings of their relative, the Abbot of Cluny, Raymond &quot;promised his cousin under oath to hand him over the Kingdom of Toledo and one third of the royal treasury upon the death of King Alfonso VI&quot;. If he could not deliver Toledo, he would give him Galicia. Henry, in turn, promised to help Raymond &quot;obtain all the dominions of King Alfonso and two thirds of the royal treasury&quot;.

Historians who date the pact closer to 1096 surmise that news of this agreement might have reached the king who, in order to counter the initiative of his two sons-in-law, appointed Henry governor of the region extending &quot;a flumine mineo usque in tagum&quot; (from the Minho river to the banks of the Tagus). Until then, this region had been governed by count Raymond who saw his power limited to just Galicia, thereby nullifying the terms of the pact.

Other historians however have showed that the pact could not have been made before 1103, several years after the two counts had been granted their respective title, implying that their alliance must have prevailed over their hypothetical rivalry.

=== After the death of Alfonso VI ===

After Raymond&#x27;s death, Queen Urraca (Teresa&#x27;s half-sister) married Alfonso the Battler for political and strategic reasons. Henry took advantage of the family conflicts and political unrest to serve on both sides and aggrandize his domains at the cost of the squabbling royal couple.

Caught under siege in Astorga by the King of Aragon, then at war with Urraca, Henry held the city with the help of his sister-in-law. Henry died on 22 May 1112, from wounds received during the siege. His remains were transferred, following his previous orders, to Braga where he was buried in a chapel at Braga Cathedral, the building of which he had promoted. After his death, his widow ruled alone.

=== Legacy ===

Count Henry was the leader of a group of gentlemen, monks, and clerics of French origin who exerted great influence in the Iberian Peninsula, promoted many reforms and introduced several institutions from the other side of the Pyrenees, such as the customs of Cluny and the Roman Rite. They occupied relevant ecclesiastical and political positions which provoked a strong backlash during the last years of the reign of King Alfonso VI.

=== Marriage and issue ===
He married Teresa of León around 1095. From Teresa, Henry had the following issue:

* Urraca Henriques ( 1095 – 1173), the wife of Bermudo Pérez de Traba, tenente in Trastámara, Viseu, Seia, and Faro in A Coruña;
* Sancha Henriques ( 1097 – 1163), married firstly Sancho Nunes de Celanova, with issue. After becoming a widow, married secondly Fernando Mendes de Bragança, with no issue from this marriage;
* Teresa Henriques (born c. 1098);
* Afonso Henriques (1109 – 1185). He was named after his maternal grandfather, King Alfonso VI, perhaps &quot;as a way of remembering that the blood of the Emperor of all Hispania also ran through his veins&quot;. Afonso became Count of Portugal in 1112 and King of Portugal in 1139.

<text>The second USS &quot;Dale&quot; was a &quot;Bainbridge&quot; class destroyer in the United States Navy.

==Construction==
&quot;Dale&quot; was launched on 24 July 1900 by William R. Trigg Company, Richmond, Virginia; sponsored by Miss M. H. Wilson; placed in reserve commission on 24 October 1902, Lieutenant Harry E. Yarnell in command; outfitted at Norfolk, Virginia; and commissioned in full on 13 February 1903.

==Pre-World War I==
Assigned to the North Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Dale&quot; cruised with the First Torpedo Flotilla on the Atlantic coast, taking part in a fleet search problem conducted off Maine, and passing before President Theodore Roosevelt in review off Oyster Bay, New York, on 17 August 1903.

The First Torpedo Flotilla - convoyed by - cleared Norfolk on 12 December 1903 and sailed to the Asiatic Station by way of the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Arriving at Cavite, Philippine Islands, on 14 April 1904, &quot;Dale&quot; cruised in the islands and on the coast of China until placed out of commission in reserve at Cavite on 5 December 1905. Recommissioned on 10 July 1907, she remained on duty with the Asiatic Fleet, cruising to Japan and China, engaging in torpedo and battle practice and maneuvers with the flotilla, guarding and inspecting the target range at Cavite, and transporting mail and passengers.

==World War I==
After the United States entered World War I, &quot;Dale&quot; patrolled the entrance to Manila Bay from 30 June – 1 August 1917, then sailed to join US Patrol Squadrons based on Gibraltar, arriving there on 20 October. She patrolled and escorted convoys in the eastern Mediterranean until the end of the war. Clearing Gibraltar on 8 December 1918, &quot;Dale&quot; arrived at Charleston, South Carolina on 12 January 1919, was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 9 July 1919, and sold to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company on 3 January 1920.

==Noteworthy commanding officers==
* Lieutenant Harry E. Yarnell (24 October 1902 – 13 February 1903) (Later Admiral)
* Lieutenant Hutchinson I. Cone (13 February 1903 – 27 April 1904) (Later Rear Admiral)

<text>O2 Academy Birmingham is a music venue located in Birmingham, West Midlands, England.

==Venue==
The original O Academy Birmingham was located at Dale End (the venue is now known as Forum Birmingham). In September 2009, the O2 Academy moved to the site of the former Dome II Nightclub located on Horsefair, Bristol Street. The decision to move to a brand new venue was decided twofold. The former venue was unsuitable for the needs of a modern music venue and the building complex it resided in, along with the Oasis Centre above, was scheduled for demolition as part of a project called Martineau Galleries.

At the new venue in Bristol Street, local band Editors headlined the opening night followed by further gigs the following nights by The Twang, The Streets and Ocean Colour Scene. For these gigs, commemorative wristbands were given out as part of a marketing campaign by members of the marketing team known as O angels.

Like the former Academy venue, the new venue has a multi-room operation with the main room having a capacity of 3,009 (of which there is a dedicated 600 capacity seated area) and two other rooms, the O Academy 2 with 600 and O Academy 3 with 250. However, in an improvement to the Dale End site, the new venue was designed to allow all three venues to be in use at the same time. A dedicated queuing system and box office is also in operation for each room. Therefore, the venue has a full capacity of 3,859.

To coincide with the launch of the Bristol Street venue, the club night Propaganda moved from the Gatecrasher venue in Birmingham to the Academy on Friday 18 September 2009. This is now a club night spread over all three academy rooms, playing a variety of indie/pop music. Subculture, a well known metal/rock club which was hosted at the Dale End Academy, moved to the new venue on 26 September 2009.

==Facilities==
===Arenas===
The O2 Academy Birmingham has three performance areas.

====Main room====
The main room, simply known as the &quot;Academy&quot; is by far the largest performance area in the complex, with a total capacity of 3,009 of which 2,409 is standing room in the stalls. Above the main stalls there is a tiered-seated balcony with a capacity of 600. This area has its own entrance, bar, toilets and cloakroom facilities.

====Academy 2====
&quot;Academy 2&quot; is a smaller room which caters for audiences of up to 600. In the Academy 2 there is standing room only, although there is a raised disabled viewing area.

====Academy 3====
&quot;Academy 3&quot; is the smallest of the three stages, with a total all-standing capacity of 250.

<doc id="656167" wikidata="Q2162876" url="?curid=656167" title="Forgiven, Not Forgotten">
<text>Forgiven, Not Forgotten is the debut studio album by Irish pop rock group the Corrs. It was released by Atlantic Records on 26 September 1995 across the world. The album was primarily produced by David Foster, with additional production by Jim Corr. In January 1997, a special tour edition of the album was released in Australia and New Zealand and featured a bonus disc containing live and rare tracks which were recorded from their Forgiven, Not Forgotten World Tour.

The title track and the band were featured in an episode of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; called &quot;Turn Back the Clock&quot;. The band performed the song at a New Year&#x27;s Eve party at the Peach Pit After Dark. The album spawned five official single releases.

==Background==
Before signing to Atlantic Records the band began recording in a makeshift-home-studio Jim rented out in their hometown of Dundalk. The band recorded on an eight-track and began making demo tapes, &quot;I remember it being very cold... We had fruit boxes on the wall for soundproofing&quot; Caroline remembered. After performing in Whelan&#x27;s bar in Dublin, the band caught the eye of Jean Kennedy Smith who invited the band to perform at the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Boston.

Once in America they met Jason Flom, Atlantic Records&#x27;s head of A&amp;R: &quot;When they walked into my New York office, I was immediately taken by their beauty, their obvious grace and style. They played me a cassette with &quot;Love to Love You&quot; and &quot;Closer&quot; on it, then they told me they played all the instruments themselves and wrote the songs. Man, I thought I&#x27;d died and gone to heaven.&quot; However Flom knew the band needed someone to produce their album so suggested they meet David Foster, a Canadian musician, producer, composer and arranger. While in New York, two days before the band were scheduled to head home, they crashed a recording session at The Hit Factory, a recording studio in New York City. Foster invited the band upstairs to perform around a piano, where they sang &quot;Forgiven, Not Forgotten&quot; live. Sharon would go on to say &quot;I think he was taken back by how polished we sounded even then&quot;.

==Tour==
On 26 April 1996, the Corrs embarked on their Forgiven, Not Forgotten World Tour that started in Ennis, Ireland, before then travelling to Europe, Australia, Asia, America and Canada, ultimately lasting the better part of two years.

<text>Richard Dale (November 6, 1756 – February 26, 1826) was an American naval officer who fought in the Continental Navy under John Barry and was first lieutenant for John Paul Jones during the naval battle off of Flamborough Head, England against in the celebrated engagement of September 23, 1779. He became one of the six original commodores of the permanent United States Navy, and commanded a blockade of Tripoli in 1801 during the First Barbary War of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s presidency.

==Early years==
Richard Dale was born in Portsmouth parish, Norfolk County, Virginia, the eldest son of Winfield Dale, shipwright and merchant, and Ann Sutherland. His father died when Dale was ten years old. Two years later, Dale signed on with a merchant vessel owned by an uncle that took him to Liverpool, England. Upon his return to Virginia, Dale became apprenticed to a ship-owner, through whom he made several journeys to the West Indies. Within five years, he achieved the rank of chief mate on a valuable brig. He remained in the merchant service until the spring of 1776.

==Revolutionary War==
Dale&#x27;s record during the Revolutionary War proved eclectic. After departing the merchant service in 1776 he signed on as a lieutenant in the navy of the colony of Virginia. His tenure proved brief, since he was captured shortly thereafter by a tender of the frigate . He knew many of the men in the ship&#x27;s crew from his time as a merchant, and they persuaded Dale to sign up for the British cause. He served for Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia.
While fighting for the British, Dale received his first battle wounds when he was caught in a confrontation with American pilot boats. During his convalescence in Norfolk, Virginia, he determined that he would return to the patriot cause at his first opportunity. En route to Jamaica, the British vessel upon which Dale traveled was captured by the American Captain John Barry on his ship . Dale volunteered to serve on the American ship, and entered their service with the rank of Midshipman.
He continued on with &quot;Lexington&quot; after Barry was replaced as captain by William Hallock, who promoted Dale to Master&#x27;s Mate. Unfortunately for Dale, the ship was captured by the British frigate . Select officers from &quot;Lexington&quot; were taken onto &quot;Pearl&quot; as prisoners, Dale included, although a sudden gale permitted the rest of the America crew to escape. In January 1777, Dale was released in a prisoner exchange and returned to &quot;Lexington&quot;, now under yet another captain, Henry Johnston. &quot;Lexington&quot; joined a squadron that caused some destruction on the coast of Ireland, which compelled the British to chase and, eventually, capture the brig and its crew. They were taken to Plymouth, England and the crew imprisoned in Mill Prison in September 1777.

===Mill Prison===

Charged with high treason against the crown, Johnston, Dale and the rest of the crew were treated harshly in the prison. A lack of sufficient food compelled them at one point to kill and eat a dog for survival. Their conditions improved only after sympathetic British civilians collected enough money to supply them with the bare necessities for sustenance. Still, the American sailors were unprepared to wait out the remainder of the war in prison, and dug a tunnel under the wall through which they attempted to make their escape. Dale and a colleague were re-captured as they attempted to board a ship from London to Dunkirk, and were returned to Mill Prison. As punishment for their escape attempt, they were both subjected to forty days of solitude in the &quot;Black Hole.&quot;

While in prison, Dale obtained a journal wherein he used his time constructively. He continued the education he had not completed in his youth. He taught himself the multiplication table, different weights and measures, multiplication and division, as well as fractions. He also examined the rules of barter, stocks and interest, and created a glossary of different naval commands necessary to captain a ship.

After a captivity at Mill Prison that lasted over a year, Dale finally managed to successfully escape in February, 1779. He walked out of the prison gates without creating suspicion, wearing the uniform of a British officer. He never recorded how he had obtained the uniform. He also obtained the necessary papers in London to leave England and make his escape to L&#x27;Orient, France.

===&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;===

In L&#x27;Orient, Dale signed on as Master&#x27;s Mate with John Paul Jones on , which was a French East Indiaman that had been converted to a warship. He received a promotion to First Lieutenant in short order. The ship cruised along the west coast of Ireland and brought the war into British waters. Through the capture or destruction of many vessels, he contributed to the disruption of British trade, and made many residents impatient for the war to end.

On September 23, 1779, &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; met HMS &quot;Serapis&quot; off the coast of Flamborough Head, near Yorkshire. Described as being somewhat reckless in his bravery, Dale commanded the forward guns in the close fighting of the battle. When rumors that &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; was sinking reached him from below decks, and that the crew was prepared to surrender, Dale went to ascertain the damage. Upon his assessment that the ship would not yet sink, he inspired the crew to persist in the fight. He compelled his British prisoners to man the pumps to keep the ship afloat while the battle continued above.

After Captain Richard Pearson of &quot;Serapis&quot; struck his flag and declared the battle an American victory, Dale, as second in command of &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, was the first American to board the British vessel. He then arranged for Pearson to meet with Jones to arrange the surrender of &quot;Serapis&quot;. Once his duties had been fulfilled, Dale realized that he had been wounded in the melee. A large splinter had resulted in a serious injury to Dale&#x27;s foot and ankle. The pain from the wound caused him to collapse and faint.

When the damage done to &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; proved irreparable, the Americans boarded HMS &quot;Serapis&quot; and departed the scene. Although he required some time to convalesce, Dale remained as Jones&#x27; first lieutenant for two more years, first on , then on USS . When &quot;Ariel&quot; arrived at the port of Philadelphia on the 14th of April, 1781, it was the first time Dale had been on American soil in four years. The rank of first lieutenant that Jones bestowed upon Dale was, to this point, recognized only by the French government that had financed Jones&#x27; privateer ventures. In recognition for his services, the American Continental Congress now officially recognized his rank as well, and made him a first lieutenant in the Continental Navy.

===Continental Navy===

When Congress appointed John Paul Jones as commander of the not-yet-built 74-gun ship-of-the line , Jones asked Dale to remain in his service. Dale declined Jones&#x27; offer, concerned that he would be kept away from sea too long during construction of the ship. His decision proved astute, since Congress ultimately gave the ship to the French government in payment of a debt, rather than to Jones to captain. Instead, Dale signed on as lieutenant for Captain Nicholson of , for the Continental Navy. Almost immediately after its departure from Philadelphia, &quot;Trumbull&quot; was confronted by a British frigate during a severe storm. Dale was wounded, then captured in the ensuing fight and taken to New York City. New York had been occupied by British forces since 1776, and Dale was again a prisoner of war.

This time, his imprisonment was comparatively short. Continental agents negotiated an early release for Dale. Within two months&#x27; time, he was free again. He signed on as the first officer on the American privateer , a large merchant ship for which the Continental Congress approved a letter of marque. This gave &quot;Queen of France&quot; the authority to attack British vessels in the name of the Continental Navy. When Dale received command of the ship, he was able to use it to advantage and captured a number of the enemy&#x27;s vessels.

Dale returned to Philadelphia in February 1783. When the war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in September of that year, the Continental Navy was officially disbanded. Along with all the other Continental officers, Dale&#x27;s commission ended and he became a civilian for the first time in eight years.

In 1783, Dale became an original member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati.

==Merchant and family==

Dale got involved in the China Trade after the war, both as an investor and as a seaman. He became a successful captain and merchant during his commercial ventures between the United States and seaports in the Far East, in both China and India. When he was stateside, he often found himself in Philadelphia, the capital of the new country during the years 1790 through 1800. He used this time to visit his former commander and lifelong friend, John Barry. On one visit, Dale met the cousin of Barry&#x27;s wife Sarah, Dorethea Crathorne. Richard and Dorethea were married on September 15, 1791, at Christ Church in Philadelphia. Their first child was born the next year, while they lived at their first home together at 49 Pine Street. Seven more children were to follow. During their lives together in Philadelphia, the Dales also lived at 69 Pine, 271 Chestnut, 69 Spruce, and 296 Walnut Streets. The first ten years of their marriage often found Dale at sea as the captain of different vessels, either commanding merchant ships or in the newly established United States Navy.

== United States Navy ==

In 1794, President George Washington established the United States Navy through order of Congress, ostensibly to protect American merchant vessels from the threat of privateers from the Barbary Nations, who took advantage of the new country&#x27;s lack of a strong military presence in the Mediterranean Sea. Secretary of War Henry Knox selected six men, the elite of the country&#x27;s naval command, to become the first commanders in the new branch of the American military. Richard Dale was selected as one of those six. Dale accepted the appointment and traveled to Norfolk, Virginia, for his first assignment: to supervise construction on the frigate . Due to the signing of a peace treaty with Algiers, one of the Barbary nations, which created some stability in the Mediterranean, construction on the frigate was halted. Dale requested and received a temporary furlough from the Navy and resumed business in the China trade. He was called back into the Navy in 1796 because of tensions that had developed between the United States and France, in what was known as the Quasi-War. As captain of the modified merchant ship , which was hastily equipped for military service, Dale gained the distinction of being the first man to command a ship at sea on behalf of the United States Navy. &quot;Ganges&quot; was used to protect the American coastline during the conflict and did not see any fighting.

A conflict of another kind caused Dale to request a second furlough after hostilities with France were redressed. Dale and some of the other five naval leaders became engaged in a dispute over their proper ranks. While government officials considered their concerns, Dale resumed the Far East trade. He commanded the Indiaman &quot;Canton&quot;, returning to Delaware Bay 11 April, 1800. Upon his return to Philadelphia, the issue had been settled to his satisfaction, and Dale accepted his orders. He was to command a small fleet assigned to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean Sea. American ships were no longer safe against the privateers of the North African nation-states.

=== Barbary War ===

During the First Barbary War with North Africa Commodore Dale sailed in the flagship with Captain James Barron and a fleet of four other ships. In 1801, President Thomas Jefferson assigned them to blockade the city of Tripoli, where government-sanctioned pirates seized European and American merchant ships and enslaved their crews. The United States government reluctantly paid tribute to the leaders of Tripoli, Tunis and Algiers for a number of years to ensure the protection of American interests. Regardless, the Barbary pirates continued to sporadically seize American property and sailors. During the years 1801 and 1802, while Dale and his fleet regulated these waters, American ships remained unthreatened. Dale maintained the blockade until a lack of provisions and rampant illness among the crews of his ships compelled him to return to his base in Virginia.

Dale received new orders to return to the Mediterranean after his return to the States; however, he was dissatisfied with the conditions of his assignment. He resigned his commission in the United States Navy when he discovered that there would be no captain on his flagship. He considered it a dishonor for him to assume the responsibilities of a captain while serving as a commodore. Instead. he returned to Philadelphia as a civilian, and lived the remainder of his life on land, with his wife and family.

== Retirement and death ==

Dale had done well for himself as a merchant seaman. Upon his return to Philadelphia, he changed the focus of his career and became a director of the Insurance Company of North America. Six months later, he shifted allegiance to the Union Insurance Company, and remained there as one of its directors for over twenty years. He served as its president from September 1824 to July 1825.

Back in 1785, George Washington signed a certificate that admitted Dale into the Society of the Cincinnati, which honored officer veterans of the Revolutionary War. Dale remained an active member for the rest of his life, and became involved in the effort to construct a monument dedicated to George Washington in Philadelphia, which ultimately never materialized. He was also active in the Society for the Relief of Poor and Distressed Masters of Ships, Their Wives and Children (est. 1765), and served in the Washington Benevolent Society of Pennsylvania. During the War of 1812, he was a member of the General Committee, formed to protect Philadelphia from potential attack by the British military.
A Protestant Episcopalian, he devoted himself to the religious affairs of the church in Philadelphia. In 1816, he served as president of the Marine Bible Association of the City of Philadelphia, founded by the Philadelphia Bible Society with the intention to further the spiritual welfare of American merchant seamen. He was a co-founder of the Mariner&#x27;s Church, a non-denominational church located right off the docks of the city port to cater to traveling seamen. Designed by William Strickland, it was one of the largest churches in the city at the time. He also served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Diocese, a Trustee of the Episcopate Fund, and participated in various conventions dedicated to the perpetuation of the Episcopalian message. He closely followed the construction and affairs of the St. Stephens Church in Philadelphia during its construction and until his death. Dale was sixty-nine when he died in Philadelphia. Originally laid to rest in the Christ Church Burial Ground, and followed by Dorethea with her death four years later, they were both reinterred in the Laurel Hill Cemetery in 1888.

<text>The Third Anglo-Afghan War was a short war which began on 3 May and ended on 8 August 1919. The new Amir of the Emirate of Afghanistan Amanullah Khan declared a Jihad against the British in the hope to proclaim full independence, as well as to strengthen his own legitimacy. Amanullah&#x27;s forces invaded British India on three fronts taking advantage of the unrest in India, in an effort to seize the old Afghan provinces west of the River Indus.

Initial victories saw the Afghans invade across the border, defeating the British and occupying Bagh. The British retaliated, leading a counterattack that routed the Afghans. Conflict continued in Kurram, which saw the British overwhelmed. Taking their own initiative, the British seized Spin Boldak in the south, while an Afghan offensive in Thal was contained, with the British occupying Dacca in turn by the end of May. The Royal Air Force were also used in bombing and strafing attacks on the frontier tribes as well as targets within Afghanistan, including Kabul and Jalalabad. Although small in scale, it was a contributing force for Amanullah to call for an armistice in June.

The Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed on 8 August which resulted in the Afghans re-gaining dejure control of foreign affairs from Britain, and the Afghans recognizing the Durand Line as the border. The conflict however, incited numerous uprisings in Waziristan that lasted until the end of the British Raj.

==Background==
The root cause of the Third Anglo-Afghan War took hold long before fighting commenced. For the British in India, Afghanistan was seen as a threat. The British worried about Russian intentions, concerned that an invasion of India could be launched by Tsarist forces through Afghanistan. This period became known as the Great Game. In an effort to negate this threat, the British made numerous attempts at imposing their will upon Kabul, and over the course of the 19th century fought two wars: the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–1842) and the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–1880).

The end of the Second Afghan War in 1880, marked the beginning of almost 40 years of good relations between Britain and Afghanistan, under the leadership of Abdur Rahman Khan and Habibullah Khan, during which time the British attempted to manage Afghan foreign policy through the payment of a large subsidy. While the country ostensibly remained independent, under the Treaty of Gandamak (1879) it accepted that in external matters it would &quot;...have no windows looking on the outside world, except towards India&quot;. Though in reality, this was not enforced, and Afghanistan continued diplomatic interactions with other nations outside of British approval.

In 1901, the death of Emir Abdur Rahman Khan led indirectly to the war that began 18 years later. His successor, Habibullah, was a pragmatic leader who sided with Britain or Russia depending on Afghan interests. Despite considerable resentment over not being consulted on the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 (Convention of St. Petersburg), Afghanistan remained neutral during the First World War (1914–1918), resisting increasing pressure from the Ottoman Empire, which entered the conflict on the side of the Central Powers; the Ottoman sultan (as titular leader of Islam) called for a holy war against the Allies.

Despite remaining neutral in the conflict, Habibullah did in fact accept a Turkish-German mission in Kabul and military assistance from the Central Powers as he attempted to play both sides of the conflict for the best deal. Through continual prevarication, he resisted numerous requests for assistance from the Central Powers, but failed to keep in check troublesome tribal leaders, intent on undermining British rule in India, as Turkish agents attempted to foment trouble along the frontier. The British had long seen Afghanistan as the only capable state of invading India, which remained a serious threat. The departure of a large part of the British Indian Army to fight overseas and news of British defeats at the hands of the Ottomans aided Ottoman agents in their efforts at sedition, and in 1915 there was unrest amongst the Mohmands and then the Mahsuds. Notwithstanding these outbreaks, the frontier generally remained settled at a time when Britain could ill afford trouble.

The Turko-German mission left Kabul in 1916. By that time, however, it had successfully convinced Habibullah that Afghanistan was an independent nation and that it should be beholden to no one. With the end of the First World War, Habibullah sought to obtain rewards from the British government for his assistance during the war. Looking for British recognition of Afghanistan&#x27;s independence in foreign affairs, he demanded a seat at the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919. This request was denied by the viceroy, Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford, on the grounds that attendance at the conference was confined to the belligerents. Further negotiations were scheduled, but before they could begin Habibullah was assassinated on 19 February 1919.

This resulted in a power struggle as Habibullah&#x27;s brother Nasrullah Khan proclaimed himself as Habibullah&#x27;s successor, while in Kabul, Amanullah, Habibullah&#x27;s third son (from his second wife), had also proclaimed himself amir. The Afghan army suspected Amanullah&#x27;s complicity in the death of his father. Needing a way of cementing his power, upon seizing the throne in April 1919, Amanullah posed as a supporter of democratic ideals, promising governmental reforms. He stated that there should be no forced labour, tyranny, or oppression, and that Afghanistan should be free and independent and no longer bound by the Treaty of Gandamak.

Amanullah had his uncle Nasrullah arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for Habibullah&#x27;s murder. Nasrullah had been the leader of a more conservative element in Afghanistan, and his treatment rendered Amanullah&#x27;s position as Amir somewhat tenuous. By April 1919, Amanullah realised that if he could not find a way to placate the conservatives, he would be unlikely to maintain his hold on power. Looking for a diversion from the internal strife in the Afghan court and sensing advantage in the rising civil unrest in India following the Amritsar massacre, Amanullah decided to invade British India. Lee states that Afghan historians typically represent the Third Anglo-Afghan War as a war of independence, while in reality, it was a Jihad. Upon his accession, Amanullah had already declared Afghanistan independent, and the British were incapable of stopping it. Additionally, Mahmud Tarzi, Amanullah&#x27;s father-in-law, was appointed foreign minister in provocation to the British prohibition that barred Afghanistan from establishing direct relations with foreign states. Recent research suggests that Amanullah launched the war to safeguard Afghanistan&#x27;s independence after it was unofficially &quot;secured&quot; following World War I.

===Afghan forces===
In 1919, the Afghan regular army was not a very formidable force, and was only able to muster some 50,000 men. These men were organised into 21 cavalry regiments and 75 infantry battalions, with about 280 modern artillery pieces, organised into 70 batteries, in support. In addition to this, however, in a boost to the army&#x27;s strength, the Afghan command could call upon the loyalty of up to 80,000 frontier tribesmen and an indeterminate number of deserters from local militia units under British command. In reality, the Afghan regular army was not ready for war. As in past years, the upper levels of the officer corps were riddled with political intrigue. In his book on the campaign, Lieutenant-General George Molesworth gave the following evaluation of the Amir&#x27;s army:

Afghan regular units...were ill-trained, ill-paid, and probably under strength. The cavalry was little better than indifferent infantry mounted on equally indifferent ponies. Rifles varied between modern German, Turkish and British types, to obsolete Martinis and Snyders. Few infantry units had bayonets. Artillery was ponydrawn, or pack, and included modern 10 cm Krupp howitzers, 75 mm Krupp mountain guns and ancient 7 pounder weapons. There were a few, very old, four-barrel Gardiner machine guns. Ammunition was in short supply and distribution must have been very difficult. For the artillery much black powder was used, both as a propellent and bursting charge for shells. The Kabul arsenal workshops were elementary and mainly staffed by Sikh artificers with much ingenuity but little real skill. There was no organised transport and arrangements for supply were rudimentary.
In support of the regulars, the Afghan command expected to call out the tribes, which could gather up to 20,000 or 30,000 Afridi fighters in the Khyber region alone. In stark contrast to the regulars, the tribal lashkars were probably the best troops that the Afghans had, being of excellent fighting quality, well armed, mainly with weapons that they had made themselves or stolen from the garrisons and with plenty of ammunition.

===British and Indian forces===
In meeting this threat, the British could call on a much larger force. In May 1919, the British and British Indian Army, not including frontier militia, totalled eight divisions, as well as five independent brigades of infantry and three of cavalry. However, of this force, the entire North-West Frontier Province had three infantry divisions and two cavalry brigades, although there was also GHQ India&#x27;s central reserve of one infantry division and one cavalry brigade. From this, they formed a striking force of two infantry divisions and two cavalry brigades for offensive operations on the Kyber front with the possibility of using it also in the Tochi and Kurram areas. One infantry division and a so-called &quot;mounted&quot; brigade were also detailed for operations on the Baluchistan–Zhob front. There were also three frontier brigades as well as a number of frontier militia and irregular corps.

Artillery was also in short supply, and the three frontier divisions each had a British field artillery brigade of the Royal Field Artillery with two batteries of 18-pounders and one battery of 4.5-inch howitzers, and an Indian mountain brigade with two batteries of 2.75-inch mountain guns. There were also two batteries of tractor-drawn 6-inch howitzers and two British mountain batteries of the Royal Garrison Artillery, which were reinforced with 3.7-inch mountain howitzers. However, most batteries had only four guns. Finally, there were also 15 pounder guns of the Frontier Garrison Artillery.
Machine guns, at least on the Khyber front, were old .303 Maxims. The British gained a command and control advantage with their use of motor transport and wireless communications, while armored cars and RAF detachments increased their firepower and reach, the latter being demonstrated to the Afghans by a bombing raid on Kabul itself. They could also direct the fire of the 60-pounders. The RAF squadrons involved were No. 31 Squadron and No. 114 Squadron.

The main problem for the British was discontent among their soldiers. The troops in India were no longer as uncritical as they had been when considering what they were being asked to do. Like other units of the British Army, many of the troops considered the war over and looked forward to being demobilised. The Indian Army had been heavily committed to the First World War and had suffered a large number of casualties. Many of its units still had not returned from overseas, and those that had had begun the process of demobilisation. As such, many regiments had lost almost all of their most experienced men. Likewise, the British Army in India had been gutted. Prior to 1914 there had been 61 British regiments serving in India. However, of these, all but ten (two cavalry and eight infantry) had been withdrawn in order to fight in Europe or the Middle East. In their place, units of the Territorial Force (TF), part-time soldiers usually only intended for home defence but who had volunteered for overseas service, had been sent in order to release regular units for the fighting in France. After four years of mundane garrison duty, away from their families and disaffected, most of these men were really only interested in demobilisation and returning to Britain to get on with their lives. They were in no way prepared for a hard-fought campaign on the Indian frontier.

===Preparations===
Amanullah Khan raised three armies planned for his invasion of British India through a three-pronged attack. The raised force in Nangarhar led by Saleh Muhammad Khan commanded mostly Mohmand and Afridi tribesmen. His intention was to attack through the Khyber Pass and seize Peshawar. This would also coincide with a planned uprising in Peshawar sponsored by Mahmud Tarzi and other Indian revolutionaries.

The second army was led by Nadir Khan, who began raising an army in Khost. His objective was to invade Waziristan and advance as far as Kurram, which were former territories of Afghanistan that were ceded during the creation of the Durand Line. Nadir Khan faced initial difficulties toward raising an army due to an uprising in Gardez, and lack of support toward the war across the border. Nadir Khan&#x27;s suppression of a tribal uprising a decade before had left many in doubt of joining the war directly, holding sentiments to refuse both an Afghan, or British army to cross through the territory of the frontier tribes.

The third army was led by &#x27;Abd al-Quddus Khan, who was beginning to raise an army in Kandahar. His objective was to advance into Balochistan and seize control of Chaman, Gulistan, Pishin, and establish complete control over the Khojak Pass. However, &#x27;Abd al-Quddus&#x27;s late arrival saw a revolt by religious leaders which he had to suppress with the aid of Ali Ahmad Khan. This was followed by a complete massacre of the Afghan Qizilbash in Kandahar. When &#x27;Abd al-Quddus was finally capable of marching into Balochistan, the armistice was already signed and the war had come to an end.

==War==
===Afghan invasion – 1st Bagh===
The conflict began on 3rd May 1919 when Afghan troops crossed the frontier at the western end of the Khyber Pass and captured the town of Bagh. Bagh was strategically important to the British and Indians as it provided water to Landi Kotal, which was at the time garrisoned by just two companies of troops from the British Indian Army. Although initially considered a minor border infraction, this attack was actually part of the wider invasion plan. For whatever reason the attack had been launched ahead of schedule, however, for Amanullah had intended initially for it to coincide with an uprising that was being planned in Peshawar for 8th May. This served to alert the British Chief Commissioner of the North West Frontier, Sir George Roos-Keppel, who had become aware of the plan and as a result he was able to successfully convince the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, of the need to respond to the occupation of Bagh before it led to further unrest in Peshawar.

In response to this the British Indian government declared war upon Afghanistan on 6th May and ordered a general mobilisation of the British and Indian forces. It was decided next that the two companies of Sikhs and Gurkhas that had been sent to Landi Kotal needed to be reinforced, however, the mobilisation process had only just begun and at that stage there was only one battalion available for this, so on 7th May the 2nd Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry were brought up clandestinely through the Khyber Pass aboard a convoy of 37 lorries.

Meanwhile, a cordon was thrown around Peshawar and demands were made for the population to hand over the uprising&#x27;s ringleaders. Amid threats that the city&#x27;s water supply would be cut, the inhabitants complied and by dawn on 8th May the situation in the city was under control and the threat of an uprising abated.

===2nd Bagh and British counterattack===
By this stage more reinforcements were available and the garrison at Landi Kotal grew to brigade-size, with the arrival of the rest of the 1st Infantry Brigade under Brigadier G.D. Crocker. On 9 May the British and Indian troops launched an attack on the Afghans that had seized Bagh the previous week. The attack, however, failed when the brigade commander decided to split his forces and detach almost half his force to protect his flank and as a result was unable to achieve the necessary concentration of force to capture all of his objectives. Coinciding with this, three BE2c aircraft from the Royal Air Force carried out a bombing raid on Dacca in Afghanistan, attacking a group of hostile tribesmen.
Following this the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades of the 1st Infantry Division were dispatched from Nowshera and Abbottabad, concentrating at Jamrud and Kacha Garhi. At the same time, the 6th Brigade from the 2nd Infantry Division moved up to Peshawar from Rawalpindi to help quell the unrest there. Two days later, on 11 May, a second attack was made on Bagh by the 1st and 2nd Infantry Brigades, under Major General Fowler, and this time it proved successful. Supported with 22 machine guns and 18 artillery pieces, the attack was preceded by a thirty-minute preparation bombardment before being carried by the 2nd Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment and two battalions from the 11th Gurkhas, who charged into the Afghan positions with bayonets fixed and drove them into the Lower Khyber, where they were subjected to further indirect fire from mountain guns that had been set up in ambush.

As the Afghans were forced back over the border, the RAF followed them across and carried out a number of bombing runs. The rout was total and tribesman that might have otherwise have been expected to counterattack in support of the Afghans decided against doing so, instead turning their efforts to looting the battlefield and gathering the arms and ammunition that the retreating Afghans had left behind. Casualties during the battle, later known as the Second Battle of Bagh, amounted to 100 Afghans killed and 300 wounded, while the British and Indian forces lost eight killed and 31 wounded.

Although Amanullah continued to profess that he had no untoward intentions, Roos-Keppel decided that it was prudent to continue the advance and ordered the army to pursue the Afghans across the border. On 13 May British and Indian troops seized control of the western Khyber without opposition and occupied Dacca, however, the British camp was poorly sited for defence and as a consequence they came under an intense long-range artillery barrage from Afghan artillery before Amanullah launched an infantry assault on them. This assault was defeated and the British launched a counter-attack the following day, however, they were unable to consolidate their position, and as a result it was not until 17 May that the area was secured and the Afghans withdrew.

===&#x27;Stonehenge Ridge&#x27;===
Meanwhile, the previous day, British and Indian forces had launched an attack on &#x27;Stonehenge Ridge&#x27;, where an Afghan force of about 3,000 men had established themselves with a number of artillery pieces and machine guns. Under cover of a preliminary bombardment to soften up the Afghan defences, men from the 11th Sikh Regiment had launched the initial assault, however, they were forced to stop their attack when they ran out of ammunition at 08.00 hours, and although a resupply was effected at 10.30 hours, it was not until 14.00 hours that the attack was resumed. By this time the troops were exposed to the heat of the day; nevertheless, after another barrage was called down, the Sikhs assaulted the Afghan line despite the heat and the attack was carried to the top of the ridge. Upon reaching the escarpment they found that the Afghans had fled the battlefield, leaving most of their equipment, artillery and a number of standards. During the assault the British and Indian forces lost 22 killed and 157 wounded, while Afghan losses were estimated at around 200 killed and 400 wounded.

At this time, however, trouble struck in the British rear along their line of communications through the Khyber where the Khyber Rifles began to become disaffected by the situation and began to desert en masse. As a result, it was decided to disarm and disband the regiment in an effort to stop the spread of similar sentiment to other regiments. Following this Lord Chelmsford decided that the situation could be resolved by continuing the advance further into Afghanistan and gave the order for the brigade in Dacca to march towards Jalalabad, but this order could not be carried out as fighting broke out further to the south and in the eastern Khyber.

===Kurram and Spin Baldek===
As part of the attack on the Khyber, secondary attacks had been planned on Quetta and Kurram, in the north in Chitral state and in the south in Baluchistan and the Zhob Valley. On 23rd May the British posts around the Kurram Valley had to be abandoned. The following day Handley Page bombers attacked Kabul; however, it did little to stem the tide, and the supply situation in Landi Kotal grew worse.

On 27th May the British commander in Quetta decided to attack the Afghan fortress at Spin Baldak, capturing it (the last time the British Army used an escalade) and, in the process, seized the initiative in the south; however, the situation in the centre of the war zone, around Kurram, remained desperate for the British. The Afghan forces in this area were under the command of General Nadir Khan and he possessed a force of some 14 battalions. Against this, the British at Thal, under Brigadier General Alexander Eustace, possessed only four battalions. To make matters worse, the only troops protecting the upper Tochi Valley were the disaffected North Waziristan Militia. Concerned that they would rise up against him if left to their own devices, Eustace gave the order to abandon the militia outposts, but in doing so, precipitated the desertion of many of the militiamen. This disaffection spread and the South Waziristan Militia in Wana turned on their officers and any men who had remained loyal and attacked them. The survivors, under Major Russell, the commandant, were forced to fight their way out to a column of the North Zhob Militia which had been sent out to relieve them.

===Thal===
Seeing that the situation was deteriorating for the British and seeing an opportunity, Nadir Khan decided to attack Thal. As the Frontier Constabulary had abandoned their posts, on the night of 28th/29th May the Afghans were able to occupy a tower from the fort and from there they were able to set fire to a number of food stores. This made the situation in the fort dire, as the supply situation had already been low. Other factors also stacked up against the British. Eustace&#x27;s force was outnumbered and outgunned. He possessed no regular British infantry and his four battalions were inexperienced Indian units, consisting mainly of young recruits. After repelling an infantry assault on 29th May, the following day the garrison was subjected to a heavy bombardment from Afghan guns. As a result of this, the British decided to bring the 16th Infantry Division, consisting of the 45th and 46th Infantry Brigades, up to Peshawar from Lahore, for the purpose of advancing on Jalalabad and have it move up to Kurram. While part of the division was detached to defend Kohat, the 45th Infantry Brigade under Brigadier General Reginald Dyer—who had been at the centre of the Amritsar massacre—set out to relieve Eustace&#x27;s force at Thal. Dyer&#x27;s force consisted of only one British battalion, the 1st/25th London Regiment, as well as Dogras, Punjabis and Gurkhas. Short of rations and possessing no transport, they were forced to march through intense heat to relieve Thal.

Despite the conditions, however, the British and Indian troops under Dyer&#x27;s command rose to the occasion and covered the last in under 12 hours and on 1st June they ran into a blocking force of tribesman that barred both the northern and southern approaches to Thal. Dyer attacked both ends with his artillery, while sending his infantry against the southern approach. Unable to withstand the attack, the tribesmen retreated and as a result the way through to Eustace&#x27;s garrison was cleared. During the siege, the British suffered 94 casualties, of which eight were killed, four died of wounds and 82 were wounded.

===Importance of British airpower===

Although limited in numbers and quality, airpower proved to be one of the greatest assets that the British possessed during this conflict. Not only did it allow them to extend their reach beyond the border and bomb Kabul, but it also enabled them to harass the retreating enemy and to break up tribesmen as they attempted to form larger groups prior to launching an attack. The ability of the British to project airpower, even small scale raids, had considerable psychological effects. For example, the single-plane raid on the palace which took place on 24th May 1919, although producing little actual damage, nevertheless greatly affected the morale of Afghan citizens and contributed to bringing Amanullah to request an armistice.

Indeed, as a result of the war and the lessons that were learned about the potential of airpower in the region, following the war, the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Hugh Trenchard, proposed controlling the frontier by air power alone. This plan had proven highly successful in Mesopotamia, Aden and the Transjordan, however, due to the uniqueness of the North-West Frontier and also due to inter-service politics the plan was not accepted until later. In 1937, it was eventually decided that should another war break out with Afghanistan, or in the event of a major tribal uprising, the RAF would take the offensive, while the ground forces would act defensively. During the course of the conflict, British aircraft losses included at least one plane crashed and two shot down.

King Amanullah objected to the British about the air raids on Kabul, citing British condemnation of the German Zeppelin attacks on London. In his letter to the British government he said, &quot;It is a matter of great regret that the throwing of bombs by Zeppelins on London was denounced as a most savage act and the bombardment of places of worship and sacred spots was considered a most abominable operation, while now we see with our own eyes that such operations were a habit which is prevalent amongst all civilized people of the West.&quot;

===Ceasefire===
On 29 May Amanullah requested for an armistice which, despite some protests, his Afghan commanders reluctantly agreed to. This was sent to the British Indian government on 31 May.

On 2 June, at dawn Dyer&#x27;s brigade launched an attack on the Afghan regulars that were positioned away to the west of Thal. As this attack went in Nadir Khan sent out an envoy to deliver a message to the brigade commander. The message told Dyer that Amir Amanullah had ordered Nadir Khan to cease hostilities and Nadir Khan asked Dyer to acknowledge that he would honour the armistice. Unaware that this request had been made, and uncertain as to whether the message and request for a cease fire was a ruse on Nadir Khan&#x27;s part, Dyer decided that he would not take any chances and sent the reply: &quot;My guns will give an immediate reply, but your letter will be forwarded to the Divisional Commander&quot;.

After this Dyer continued his attack and as Nadir Khan&#x27;s force withdrew from the area, Dyer followed them up with cavalry and armoured cars from the 37th Lancers, while the RAF, using machine guns and iron bombs, attacked and dispersed about 400 tribesmen that were in the area and which posed a threat of counterattack.

On 3 June, the Afghan camp at Yusef Khel was seized by two platoons from the 1st/25th London and two troops from the 37th Lancers supported by a section of guns from the 89th Battery. Following this Dyer received a telegram ordering to break off his pursuit as an armistice came into effect that day.

==Outcome and negotiation==
Although the war did not proceed as the Afghans had wished, by the end of the war the Afghans had diplomatically secured their independence. Ludwig states that the British did not win the war as both sides had controlled enemy territory, and no decisive battles had occurred to establish that anybody was decisively defeated. In repulsing the invasion, the British were either considered tactically victorious, with the Afghans suffering a military defeat, or having ended the war in a military stalemate. However, other sources state the Afghans won a political and diplomatic victory by asserting their main goal, independence, and the right to conduct their own foreign affairs.

After the aerial bombings of Kabul and the prospect of Jalalabad and Kandahar being occupied by the British, the Afghans requested an armistice in May 1919. The war had lasted exactly one month, though sporadic conflict continued until the Armistice was signed in June after Afghans were pushed back from the Indian territory. The Afghan government&#x27;s propaganda also attempted to portray it as having brought Britain to the negotiating table through their victories in order to justify the decision to cease fire. Jonathan L. Lee notes that the Afghan army &quot;had been soundly defeated on two fronts&quot; despite the propaganda from the Afghan government to portray the war as a larger success, with Spin Boldak having occupied by the British. Nonetheless, Nadir Khan&#x27;s campaign had instilled a significant uprising across the Baluchistan, which lingered until the summer of 1919. Lee characterizes the Afghan army as &quot;barely fit for purpose&quot; as it was defeated &quot; not just by the superior technology and discipline of the British army, but by lightly armed and untrained tribal levies.&quot;

Although an armistice had been agreed upon, British forces were regularly harassed by raiding tribes, and the British hoped that the beginning of peace negotiations would see the resistance dissipate. &#x27;Abd al-Quddus had further instigated tribal raids unto the British supply lines. The British were intent on a quick peace deal due to fears of unrest and the rise of Communism. Even then there were disagreements between officials on what approach to consider, the British officials who wanted to restore the closed frontier policy and enforce strict control over Afghanistan&#x27;s foreign affairs included Curzon and Denys Bray, while the belief that the Amir would adopt a more conciliatory tone after his defeat was held by officials such as Viceroy Chelmsford and Henry Dobbs. The Afghan delegation first met with the British on 26 July, headed by Ali Ahmad Khan. Grant emphasized the needless war, and relayed that the tribes harassing British forces during the armistice made negotiations impossible to continue. Ali Ahmad responded, believing the British responsible for the war, and attempting to portray the British as the ones who wished for peace, while relating the threat of the Soviet Union. In further meetings, Grant wished for Afghanistan to remain in the British fold, which Ali Ahmad adamantly rejected and held on independence as a core demand. This was likely supported by the fact that the Afghans wished to transfer the caliphate to Afghanistan. Grant was given permission to give an ultimatum to the Afghans to accept British demands, although not to breach the armistice. 

The Afghans initially declined the ultimatum on 31 July, before agreeing to them on 4 August with modifications to the treaty. The Afghans wished to eliminate any wording that blamed them for the start of the conflict, which Grant accepted. Grant was ready to make important concessions, and believed it was time to do so to the Afghans had it been demanded, but was worried about risking his own authority. On 5 August, the British government affirmed that if the British did not retain control of Afghanistan&#x27;s foreign affairs, the subsidy given to them would be ended. On 6 August, the final rendition of the treaty was given to the Afghans, which dictated that peace would be established, guns could not be imported through British India, the ending of subsidy payments by the British to the Afghans, the acceptance of the British of an Afghan mission to restore relations, and the affirmation of the Durand line. Although, the cabinet had indirectly recognised Afghanistan&#x27;s independence with the phrase &#x27;Independent Afghan Government&#x27; as the title in the agreement. The mentions of Afghanistan as an &#x27;independent&#x27; or &#x27;free&#x27; nation were omitted in the actual clauses. A personal letter by Grant to Amir assured that the contents of the agreement did not interfere in Afghanistan&#x27;s internal or foreign affairs.

Thus, the treaty of Rawalpindi was concluded on 8th August 1919. As a result of the peace treaty that was negotiated, the British ceased payment of the Afghan subsidy, and thus ended their claim to direct Afghan foreign policy, which had been the &quot;quid pro quo&quot; of the Emir accepting the subsidy. While the Afghan government had &quot;effectively capitulated&quot;, Amanullah received little but a letter personally addressed to him that indirectly recognised Afghanistan&#x27;s independence, with Afghan government propaganda trying to conceal it by claiming the war was a complete victory. The government propaganda maintained that it had won the war because &quot;Britain had tacitly recognized Afghanistan&#x27;s independence,&quot; although the treaty did not &quot;explicitly recognise Afghan independence&quot; and it took until 1922 for independence by treaty to be formally recognized. The British also made some political gains, most notably the reaffirmation of the Durand Line – which had long been a contentious issue between the two nations – as a border separating Afghanistan from the North-West Frontier, and the undertaking that the Afghans made to stop interference on the British side of the line. Grant also attempted to justify the concessions to the Afghans, believing it was impossible to control Afghanistan&#x27;s foreign affairs unless by having to fully subjugate the country. Lee states that the treaty blamed &quot;Afghan aggression&quot; for the war, mooting all previous treaties. The treaty was defined more as a personal arrangement with the Amir than with the Afghan state. 

The British believed in the negotiations that by letting Afghanistan become independent, it would still be reliant on British military and economic aid, and thus accepted the treaty and the recognition of Afghanistan as an independent state. Despite this, British and Afghan diplomats often snubbed each other as a result of the war, which the British did not forget. In one occasion, as the Afghans attempted to open diplomatic ties to Italy, the British informed the Italians that they had to recognize the British influence in the country. Afghan diplomats in Kabul in retaliation attempted to humiliate British diplomats there who were negotiating a treaty, which resulted in Afghan delegations to London being refused. British diplomatic mail and letters were rejected, and the British government refused to refer to Amanullah Khan as &quot;Your Majesty&quot; demanding that they wanted to see &quot;some evidence of goodwill&quot; on his part before granting such recognition and letters to George V were intentionally left unanswered.

The British had traditionally wanted Afghanistan as a buffer state between India and the Russian Empire. In 1919, the Russian Civil War was raging and any threat from Russia to India at the time was potential rather than real. Moreover, the British were by far the largest supporters of the White movement in the Russian Civil War with the British contributing more arms to the Whites than all other nations combined. It was assumed in London that if the Whites won the Civil War, a new era in Anglo-Russian relations might possibly open as the victorious Whites might be grateful for British support, rendering the need for a buffer state in Central Asia irrelevant. The British also stopped arms sales from India to Afghanistan. But, as British influence declined, the Afghans were able to gain control of their own foreign affairs and in the aftermath emerged as a fully independent state.

The circumstances behind the war were complicated as was the final settlement. In going to war in 1919 against British India, Amir Amanullah&#x27;s war aims were complicated. Even up against a depleted British Indian Army, a tactical victory was unlikely; however, the war served the dual purpose of deflecting domestic criticism and also offering the opportunity for strategic political gains. Lee observes that government was &quot;so successful&quot; in hiding the true terms of the treaty that, Amanullah Khan was hailed as a hero across Muslim world, with some even calling for him to become the new Caliph. Amanullah Khan&#x27;s intentions for Jihad however, failed. Lee elaborates that Amanullah Khan was &quot;no general&quot; and had no active role in the war.

Casualties during the conflict amounted to approximately 1,000 Afghans killed in action, with hundreds more dying from wounds. The British and Indian forces on the other hand suffered 236 killed in action and 615 wounded. Additionally there were 566 deaths from cholera and 344 deaths from other causes; for a total of 1,751 dead or wounded.

Lee states that through unprovoked aggression towards the British, Amanullah antagonized Afghanistan&#x27;s key ally in the region, prompting British officials to consider Afghanistan a hostile neighbor and his rule something to subvert. Lee argues that if he had negotiated with them following his declaration of independence, rather than waging war, they would likely have conceded some form of conditional independence, as they had previously conveyed the same to his father. Although the fighting concluded in August 1919, its effects continued to be felt in the region for some time afterwards. The nationalism and disruption that it had sparked stirred up more unrest in the years to come, particularly in Waziristan, which saw an uprising that was long encouraged by Nadir Khan. The tribesmen, always ready to exploit governmental weakness, whether real or perceived, banded together in the common cause of disorder and unrest. They had become well-armed as a result of the conflict, from which they benefitted greatly from the weapons and ammunition that the Afghans had left behind and from an influx of manpower in large numbers of deserters from the militia that had joined their ranks. With these additions they launched a campaign of resistance against British authority on the North-West Frontier that was to last until the end of the Raj.
===Decorated Afghan soldiers===
Soldiers decorated by the authority of Ghazi Amanullah Khan:
* Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan, a National Hero of Afghanistan who was decorated with 4 medals, being the &quot;Lōy Khan&quot; (Grand Khan), &quot;Wafa&quot;, (Loyalty), &quot;Sedāqat&quot; (Honesty), and &quot;Khedmat&quot; (Service)
* Nisar Muhammad Yousafzai, a War Hero decorated with the &quot;Order of Gallantry of the Emirate of Afghanistan&quot; for wartime bravery

===Battle honours, British Indian army===

British and Indian infantry units that participated in the conflict received the battle honour &quot;Afghanistan 1919&quot;. No other battle honours for individual engagements were issued. Additionally, unlike the first two Anglo-Afghan wars where individual campaign ribbons were issued for separate engagements, no campaign medal was struck for this conflict. Instead, participation in this conflict was recognised by a clasp to the India General Service Medal (1908–1935).

The award of the battle honour was made in four separate Army and Governor General&#x27;s orders. The earliest, Army Order 97/24, granted the honour to 14 British units. Governor General&#x27;s Order 193/26 made awards to Indian Army Corps. Governor General&#x27;s Order 1409/26 made awards to Indian States Forces and finally a further Governor General&#x27;s Order in 1927 made awards to a further three Gurkha regiments.

The Army Order was unusual in that a mistake was made in awarding the Afghanistan 1919 battle honour to The Hampshire Regiment and the 21st Lancers. This was subsequently rectified and the award to these two units was withdrawn.

Many of these units did not exist at the time of the war but were formed as part of the reorganisation of the Indian Army in 1922; however, the decision was made to award the battle honour to the successor units of those involved in the war. The honour was not awarded to regiments that had been disbanded, e.g. 11th Gurkha Rifles, and not all units that took part in the war were awarded the battle honour, e.g. 1/5th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment.

<text>The Second Anglo-Afghan War (Dari: جنگ دوم افغان و انگلیس, ) was a military conflict fought between the British Raj and the Emirate of Afghanistan from 1878 to 1880, when the latter was ruled by Sher Ali Khan of the Barakzai dynasty, the son of former Emir Dost Mohammad Khan. The war was part of the Great Game between the British and Russian empires.

The war was split into two campaigns – the first began in November 1878 with the British invasion of Afghanistan from India. The British were quickly victorious and forced the Amir – Sher Ali Khan to flee. Ali&#x27;s successor Mohammad Yaqub Khan immediately sued for peace and the Treaty of Gandamak was then signed on 26 May 1879. The British sent an envoy and mission led by Sir Louis Cavagnari to Kabul, but on 3 September this mission was massacred and the conflict was reignited by Ayub Khan which led to the abdication of his brother Yaqub.

During this period, Abdur Rahman Khan, an opponent of the British, began distinguishing himself as a possible successor candidate to become the Amir of Afghanistan through his exploits in northern Afghanistan. Eventually after moving on Kabul, he was crowned and then later recognized by the British as the ruler of Afghanistan.

The second campaign began when Ayub Khan, the governor of Herat, rebelled in July 1880 and marched on Kandahar, defeating the British at the battle of Maiwand. The campaign ended in September 1880 when the British decisively defeated Ayub Khan outside Kandahar. Abdur Rahman Khan, now the sole ruler, created the buffer the British wanted between the Raj and the Russian Empire. British and Indian soldiers then withdrew from Afghanistan.

==Background==
A significant political group in Afghanistan at the time were the Afzalids. The Afzalids were originally supporters of Mohammad Afzal Khan to the throne of Afghanistan during the civil war on Dost Mohammad&#x27;s succession. The Afzalids were eventually defeated by Sher Ali Khan but many fled in exile to Samarkand in the Russian Empire under the authority of Abdur Rahman Khan, who was actively given asylum by the Russian government and brought worries to the British about a future pro-Russian claimant to the throne of Afghanistan.

On one such occasion, the Bukharans aided Muhammad Ishaq Khan, a son of Mohammad Azam Khan. He occupied Aqcha, but was later defeated. Following his defeat, the Afghan governor of Balkh, Muhammad Khan, purged much of the province of Afzalid supporters, seizing lands and exacting imprisonment and execution on those thought to be sympathizers. Districts that had aided the rebellion faced hefty fines, and the rulers of the Chahar Wilayat were mandatorily forced to re-affirm their allegiance to Sher Ali Khan by traveling to Kabul every year. In 1875, Husain Khan, the ruler of Maimana, refused to honour his oath and executed several government officials, declaring allegiance under the ruler of Bukhara. The rebellion was quelled, however when the leaders of the insurrection were brought before Sher Ali, he refused to execute them in honour of their former oaths, and instead had Muhammad Khan killed. These circumstances of events brought further support to the Afzalids in Samarkand, with many Amirs of the Chahar Wilayat beginning to correspond with Abdur Rahman Khan and the Afzalid faction.

After tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 Congress of Berlin, Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan, tried unsuccessfully to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878, and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too. The British informed Sher Ali that a British mission would arrive in Kabul as well with or without his consent. However, as news of this arrived, Sher Ali&#x27;s son and heir, Abdullah Jan had died. With mourning and the funeral taking place, nobody wished to show Sher Ali the British message. Eventually the message was revealed by his chamberlain. In a condolence message to Sher Ali, the British informed Sher Ali that the mission would leave Peshawar for Kabul in September.

Lord Lytton, the viceroy of India, ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the Khyber Pass. A deadline was established for 20 November, where if a response was not given by the Afghan government, war would be declared. A day before the deadline, Sher Ali sent a messenger to Peshawar but failed to arrive on time, and turned away after news of the British invasion began.

==War==
===First phase===
The first campaign began in November 1878 when a British force of about 50,000 fighting men, mostly Indians, was distributed into three military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. The British victories at the battles of Ali Masjid and Peiwar Kotal meant that the approach to Kabul was left virtually undefended by Afghan troops.

An alarmed Sher Ali left for Mazar-i-Sharif. This was done in hopes of the British overstretching their armies in Afghanistan, and make it difficult for the British to occupy parts of southern Afghanistan for an indefinite period of time, as well as that the Afghan tribes would eventually rise up. Further drawing off of Dost Mohammad Khan and Wazir Akbar Khan&#x27;s tactics in the First Anglo-Afghan War. Mazar-i-Sharif was safe as well, with winter already ongoing, the British would be unable to pass the snow littered Hindu Kush. Alongside this, over 15,000 Afghan soldiers were present in Afghan Turkestan, which Sher Ali began preparing to assemble more men across Afghanistan. Sher Ali also attempted to appeal in person to the Russian Tsar for assistance, but he wasn&#x27;t allowed to enter Russian territory, and their insistence was that he should seek terms of surrender from the British. He returned to Mazar-i-Sharif, where his health began to suffer, leading to his death on 21 February 1879.

Before leaving for Afghan Turkestan, Sher Ali released the surviving governors of the Chahar Wilayat that he had previously imprisoned. Upon Sher Ali&#x27;s arrival to Mazar-i-Sharif, Sher Ali promised them the return of their states if they had assisted against the British in the war to come. Many of the governors, having been imprisoned for longer than a decade, all due to similar oaths being broken. As a result, seeing an opportunity to declare independence, Muhammad Khan, the former governor of Sar-I-Pul, alongside Husain Khan, the former governor of the Maimana Khanate, all declared independence against Afghan rule, rallying their own armies and expelling Afghan garrisons. A wave of Turkmen raids also began into Afghan Turkestan as a result, seeing some 6,000 women being enslaved, with forces from Sher Ali to repel the raids being defeated.

With Sher Ali&#x27;s death, a tumultuous period began over his succession. One of his sons, Muhammad Ali Khan, attempted to seize Takhtapul, however the garrison mutinied, forcing him to move south towards Dai Zangi, where he began assembling an army against Yaqub Khan.

Yaqub Khan was declared the new Amir, with many sardars that were thought to have ties with the Afzalid faction were imprisoned. In Mazar-i-Sharif, Yaqub Khan&#x27;s son, Muhammad Musa, assembled a force and seized Takhtapul, sending the leader of the mutineers to Kabul, where he was executed. Ayub Khan, supporting his brother&#x27;s succession, did not oppose him. However, much of the military forces and officers in Balkh and Herat instead supported the Afzalids. Ayub Khan began facing anarchy in Herat, with much of the forces from the expelled from Maimana demanding payment. Ayub Khan sent numerous requests to Mazar-i-Sharif, imminently requesting aid in cash. Despite receiving funds, the troops began rioting, and were turned away by Ayub Khan towards Yaqub Khan, stating he would be capable of paying them.

===Treaty===
With British forces occupying Kabul, Sher Ali&#x27;s son and successor, Yaqub Khan, signed the Treaty of Gandamak on 26 May 1879. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to Britain. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, and their control was extended to the Khyber and Michni passes, and Afghanistan ceded various North-West Frontier Province areas and Quetta to Britain, including the strategic fort of Jamrud. Yaqub Khan also renounced all rights to interfering in the internal affairs of the Afridi tribe. In return, Yaqub Khan only received an annual subsidy of 600,000 rupees, with the British pledging to withdraw all forces from Afghanistan excluding Kandahar.

However, on 3 September 1879 an uprising in Kabul led to the slaughter of Sir Louis Cavagnari, the British representative, along with his guards, and staff – provoking the next phase of the Second Afghan War.

===Second phase===
Major General Sir Frederick Roberts led the Kabul Field Force over the Shutargardan Pass into central Afghanistan, defeated the Afghan Army at Charasiab on 6 October 1879, and occupied Kabul two days later. Ghazi Mohammad Jan Khan Wardak, and a force of 10,000 Afghans, staged an uprising and attacked British forces near Kabul in the Siege of the Sherpur Cantonment in December 1879. The rebellion collapsed after the failure of a direct attack on Roberts&#x27; force on 23 December. Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub&#x27;s brother Ayub Khan on the throne, but also looked to install his cousin Abdur Rahman Khan (half nephew of the former Sher Ali) as Amir instead.

===Exploits of Abdur Rahman Khan===
Abdur Rahman Khan meanwhile had been in exile in Turkestan. Upon the death of Sher Ali Khan he requested from the Russians to enter Afghanistan as a claimant of the throne. This request was denied. However, following Yaqub Khan&#x27;s abdication, as well as the British occupation of Kabul, the Russians allowed Abdur Rahman Khan to re-enter Afghanistan. Abdur Rahman made way for Badakhshan, whose ruler he had marriage ties with. While on route, he did a pilgrimage to the shrine of Khwaja Ahrar, taking his banner after claiming he had a vision that ensured victory. The ruler of Badakhshan did not permit Abdur Rahman to ford the Amu Darya, to which Abdur Rahman did so further downstream. He then crossed a mountain pass while it snowed, arriving at Rostaq, where its garrison defected. With the fall of Rostaq, Abdur Rahman met the Mir of Badakhshan in battle, forcing him to flee to Chitral while Abdur Rahman annexed Badakhshan.

Abdur Rahman requested from Sultan Murad of Kunduz for military access so he could advance on Kabul. This request was denied. However, Ghulam Haidar Khan, Yaqub&#x27;s governor of Balkh, attacked Kunduz, occupying it, and forcing Sultan Murad to flee to Fayzabad. Sultan Murad then aligned with Abdur Rahman, and encouraged rebellion against Ghulam Haidar, with the commander of Takhtapul declaring for Abdur Rahman. Ghulam Haidar fled across the Amu Darya, leaving the entirety of Afghan Turkestan under Abdur Rahman&#x27;s control.

The British, eyeing for a suitable candidate to be the ruler of Afghanistan, scouted Abdur Rahman Khan, and began negotiating with him. Abdur Rahman was reluctant to accept such a proposal, as he considered himself an opponent of the British, with his own men wishing for Jihad against them. While negotiations continued, the British considered numerous political solutions, including dividing Afghanistan into numerous kingdoms. The British were seeking to a quick conclusion to the war due to the resignation of Lytton, with his successor, the Marquis of Ripon, wishing to withdraw all British troops from Afghanistan as quickly as possible. With this, the British no longer wished to uphold a British envoy in Afghanistan. However, both sides continued to differ, with the British wishing to keep Kandahar under their control with Sardar Sher Ali as governor, while Abdur Rahman saw it imperative as a part of Afghanistan.

Believing that the British might withdraw, Abdur Rahman Khan arrived in Charikar sometime in July 1880, where religious leaders from regions such as Panjshir, Kohistan, and Tagab welcomed his arrival. On 19 July, the British informed Abdur Rahman that they were prepared to recognize him as the ruler of Afghanistan, inviting him to Kabul for a ceremony. Abdur Rahman called a Jirga, with many tribal leaders declaring for him, while Abdur Rahman was declared the Amir of Kabul.

===Ayub Khan&#x27;s rebellion===

Ayub Khan, who had been serving as governor of Herat, rose in revolt, defeated a British detachment at the Battle of Maiwand in July 1880 and besieged Kandahar. Roberts then led the main British force from Kabul and decisively defeated Ayub Khan on 1 September at the Battle of Kandahar, bringing his rebellion to an end.

==Aftermath==

With Ayub Khan defeated, the war was officially over with Abdur Rahman Khan ruling as Amir, he was seen as the real victor of the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Despite attempts by the British to hold on to Kandahar, they decided to return it to Afghanistan. Rahman confirmed the Treaty of Gandamak, whereby the British took control of the territories ceded by Yaqub Khan. The provocative policy of maintaining a British resident in Kabul was abandoned, but instead British Indian Muslim agents were to be left to smooth liaison between the governments. Britain would also handle Afghanistan&#x27;s foreign policy in exchange for protection and a subsidy. The Afghan tribes maintained internal rule and local customs, and provided a continuing buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire. Ironically many of these policies had been desired by Sher Ali Khan, and war could have been prevented had they been implemented earlier.

The war was expensive for Britain, spending some 17 million pounds during the war, which was three times the estimated cost. The costs rose just before the British left in March 1881, estimating to be around 19.5 million pounds.

Rudyard Kipling may have been thinking of what some of the British survivors of the Anglo-Afghan wars had faced when he wrote in &quot;The Young British Soldier&quot;:
Despite attempts from the British to dissuade Afghanistan from Russian influence, Abdur Rahman Khan adopted an autocratic government similar to the Tsars of Russia, inspired by Peter the Great from his time in exile in Turkestan. Alongside this, despite the British attempting to prop up Afghanistan as a key ally, Abdur Rahman Khan often acted against the British, with atrocities horrifying even Queen Victoria, and he became known as the &#x27;Iron Amir&#x27;. He also refused to give information regarding his troops, with his own autobiography criticizing British policy, while also violating the Lyall agreement by instead of allowing the British to oversee his diplomatic affairs, held them himself with numerous countries including Iran, the Ottoman Empire, and the German Empire. Abdur Rahman also wrote in pamphlets, encouraging Jihad against the British and the Russians, claiming both wished to end Afghanistan as a state. Senior British officials found it extremely difficult to further cooperate with Abdur Rahman Khan and Afghanistan due to the Turkestan atrocities, as well as his actions against the Hazaras. The British believed they had no other alternative but to support Abdur Rahman Khan, scoring a diplomatic victory for him.

Despite this, no further trouble resulted between Afghanistan and British India during Rahman&#x27;s period of rule. The Russians kept well out of Afghan internal affairs, with the exception of the Panjdeh incident three years later, resolved by arbitration and negotiation after an initial British ultimatum.

In 1893, Mortimer Durand was dispatched to Kabul by British India to sign an agreement with Rahman for fixing the limits of their respective spheres of influence as well as improving diplomatic relations and trade. On November 12, 1893, the Durand Line Agreement was reached. This led to the creation of a new North-West Frontier Province.

<text>Cursuses are monumental Neolithic enclosure structures comprising parallel banks with external ditches or trenches. Found only in the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, relics within them indicate that they were built between 3400 and 3000 BC, making them among the oldest monumental structures on the islands. The name &#x27;cursus&#x27; was suggested in 1723 by William Stukeley, the antiquarian, who compared the Stonehenge cursus to a Roman chariot-racing track, or circus.Cursuses range in length from to almost . The distance between the parallel earthworks can be up to . Banks at the terminal ends enclose the cursus. Over fifty have been identified via aerial photography while many others have doubtless been obliterated by farming and other activities.

The Stonehenge Cursus is a notable example within sight of the more famous Stonehenge stone circle. Other examples are the four cursuses at Rudston in Yorkshire, that at Fornham All Saints in Suffolk, the Cleaven Dyke in Perthshire and the Dorset cursus. The Bures cursus and the Metlands cursus are in Bures St Mary, Suffolk, and were detected from cropmarks. They are situated just above the floodplain of the north bank of the River Stour, Suffolk. On 21 December each year the sun rises over Lodge Hills, Wormingford, and shines down the length of the Metlands cursus.

In the summer of 2023 excavation began at a cursus discovered near Drumadoon in the Isle of Arran in 2019. It is believed to be the only complete example in Britain. Archaeologists from Glasgow University co-led by Dr Kenneth Brophy and local volunteers began excavating at the site in August. Brophy judged the Arran cursus the most significant he had seen in his career.

== Function ==

It has been conjectured that they were used in rituals connected with ancestor veneration, that they follow astronomical alignments or that they served as buffer zones between ceremonial and occupation landscapes. More recent studies have reassessed the original interpretation and argued that they were used for ceremonial competitions. Finds of arrowheads at the terminal ends suggest archery and hunting were important to the builders and that the length of the cursus may have reflected its use as a proving ground for young men involving a journey to adulthood. Anthropological parallels exist for this interpretation.

Contemporary internal features are rare and it has been traditionally thought that the cursūs were used as processional routes. They are often aligned on and respect the position of pre-existing long barrows and bank barrows and appear to ignore difficulties in terrain. The Dorset Cursus, the longest known example, crosses a river and three valleys along its course across Cranborne Chase and is close to the henge monuments at Knowlton.

The present-day Tynwald day ceremony on the Isle of Man involves the procession of parliament along a cursus-like structure, which is sometimes suggested as a related or continual folk tradition with the Neolithic cursus. Larger scale modern ceremonial analogs might include the National Mall in Washington, and The Mall, London.

==Identification by aerial photography==
Numerous examples of cursus are known and the discipline of aerial archaeology is the most effective method of identifying such large features following thousands of years of weathering and plough damage. Some cursus have only been identified through a first sighting of cropmarks visible from aerial reconnaissance; for example, the cropmarks at Fetteresso were the first indication of a cursus at that location in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

== Etymology ==

&#x27;Cursus&#x27; (plural &#x27;cursūs&#x27; or &#x27;cursuses&#x27;) was a name given by early British archaeologists such as William Stukeley to the large parallel lengths of banks with external ditches which they thought were early Roman athletic courses, after the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;course&quot;.

<text>Seth E. Lover (January 1, 1910, in Kalamazoo, Michigan – January 31, 1997, in Garden Grove, California) was a designer of amplifiers and musical instrument electronics and effects. He is most famous for developing the Gibson humbucker or hum-cancelling electric stringed instrument pickup, most often used on the electric guitar.

==Life and career==

Seth Lover began working with electronics as a child, and continued working with them during and after his first service with the US Army in the 1930s. He then worked in an electronics shop in Kalamazoo, repairing radios and building amplifiers. In the 1940s he worked for Gibson Guitars before joining the service a second time during World War II. During the rest of the 1940s and 1950s, his career fluctuated between working for Gibson and the US Navy. He developed the humbucking pickup for Gibson in 1955, and designed the first fuzztone distortion device, called the Maestro, in 1961. He stayed with Gibson until 1967 when he took a designing job with Fender Musical Instruments. He retired to the Southern California town of Garden Grove.

Lover died on January 31, 1997, at the age of 87 after a brief illness. He was survived by his wife, his two sons, and his three grandchildren.

==Designs with Gibson, Fender, and Seymour Duncan==
===With Gibson===
Lover&#x27;s most famous humbucker design was the P.A.F. (Patent Applied For) designed while working for Gibson in 1955. This pickup was utilized in a range of Gibson guitars, most notably the Les Paul model.

Before Lover, electric guitarists were forced to cope with the 60-cycle hum received by single coil pickups. It was in the mid-&#x27;50s, while working as an amplifier designer at Gibson Guitars, that Lover figured out how to wire two coils electrically out of phase and with reversed magnetic polarities. The effect was to cancel the hum before it reached the amp and the result was the birth of the humbucking pickup.

Lover applied for the patent on the humbucking pickup in 1955 and it was finally granted in 1959 (). During this five-year period, Gibson adhered a &quot;Patent Applied For&quot; sticker to the underside of their humbucker pickups. These &quot;P.A.F.&quot; pickups are among the most collectable and desirable pickups today, fetching upwards of $1,000 each among vintage guitar collectors.

While working under Ted McCarty at Gibson, Lover was also involved in guitar design. He liked to tell how he helped contribute to the design of the famous &quot;Flying V.&quot; Lover said that he thought up the design as a way to lean the guitar against a wall without it tipping over.

Lover worked for Gibson from 1952 to 1967 as a design engineer.

===With Fender===

From 1967 to 1975 Lover worked for Fender Musical Instruments as a project engineer. He authored three patents during that time: two for loudspeaker cabinets and one for an electric piano pickup.

Lover designed the Fender Wide Range humbucking pickup (WRHP), which was used in the three Telecaster models (Deluxe, Custom, and Thinline) produced by Fender in the 1960–1970s. The Wide Range pickup was also used in the Fender Starcaster.

===With Seymour Duncan===

Seymour W. Duncan, a guitar pickup designer and manufacturer, considered Lover his &quot;humbucker mentor&quot;. The two were associated for nearly 20 years. In 1994, Duncan and Lover jointly produced the Seth Lover Model pickup, a re-creation of the &quot;Patent Applied For&quot; humbucker. After numerous full-page ads, NAMM Show appearances, and magazine interviews, Lover became a minor celebrity at age 84. During his final years, Lover was a regular member of the Seymour Duncan NAMM-team.

<doc id="656186" wikidata="Q2350335" url="?curid=656186" title="Talk on Corners">
<text>Talk on Corners is the second studio album by Irish family pop rock band the Corrs. It was released on 17 October 1997 by 143, Lava and Atlantic Records. Preceded by lead single &quot;Only When I Sleep&quot;, which became a top ten hit internationally, the album was an immediate commercial success in several territories, including Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Its commercial performance elsewhere was initially modest, however.

The Corrs&#x27; entire concert from the Royal Albert Hall was broadcast live the following year on BBC One on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, where they were joined during their performance of &quot;Dreams&quot; by Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood. This event did much to raise the band&#x27;s international profile. A remixed version of &quot;Dreams&quot; went on to become their first top ten hit on the UK Singles Chart. The record was reissued the following month to include the song as a bonus track. This would be the first of several different editions of &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; to be released over the album&#x27;s two-year-long promotional cycle.

Over this period, the band released a string of increasingly successful hit singles, culminating with a Tin Tin Out remix of &quot;Runaway&quot; peaking at number two in the UK. The Corrs also toured extensively to promote the record: the Talk on Corners World Tour saw them perform almost 160 concerts across twelve separate legs. The album spent ten weeks at number one in the UK. It ended its run as the highest-selling album of the year, and remains one of the best-selling albums of all time there, as well as the highest-selling album ever by an Irish act.

==Background and recording==
The Corrs began work on new material in California in July 1996, initially under the supervision of producer David Foster. Lead vocalist Andrea Corr has described the making of &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; as being &quot;a struggle&quot;, with the band put under pressure by Atlantic Records to deliver a successful follow-up to their 1995 debut album &quot;Forgiven, Not Forgotten&quot;. Their manager John Hughes cited second album syndrome as a common source of pressure for all recording artists, but said further demands came from the label, who were concerned that none of the songs they were being presented with seemed like potential hit singles. The label disliked &quot;What Can I Do&quot; and &quot;So Young&quot;, particularly the latter, and the band had to fight hard for their inclusion on the album.

Additional co-writers and producers were brought in to help improve the album&#x27;s hit potential, including Carole Bayer Sager, Glen Ballard, Oliver Leiber, Rick Nowels and Billy Steinberg. The use of different producers on different tracks introduced further difficulties: the band found it hard to achieve consistency throughout the entire album, although this would be remedied by the Corrs using over forty hours of studio time to record overdubs. In May 1997, the finalised album was delivered to Atlantic, who were unimpressed by the material and ordered the band to continue recording new tracks. When they refused, the label threatened to sue the band for breach of contract. This dispute was only resolved when John Hughes signed a contract guaranteeing future album sales, with the manager being held personally liable if &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; failed to yield a profit for Atlantic.

==Composition and style==
&quot;Talk on Corners&quot; is predominantly a pop rock album, although it also incorporates elements of Celtic and traditional Irish music. Andrea Corr was the album&#x27;s primary lyricist, co-writing numerous songs with established composers and producers: she co-wrote &quot;Queen of Hollywood&quot; with Glen Ballard, best known for co-writing Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; (1987) as well as for co-writing and producing the Alanis Morissette album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995). &quot;Intimacy&quot; was co-written by Pat Benatar guitarist Neil Giraldo, and Billy Steinberg—the writer of hit singles including Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984) and &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; by the Bangles (1989). Several songs on the record were co-written and produced by Oliver Leiber, the son of composer Jerry Leiber, who, alongside Mike Stoller, co-wrote some of the biggest hits of the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s, including Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot; (1953) and &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; (1957) as well as Ben E. King&#x27;s &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1961). Their cover of the Jimi Hendrix song &quot;Little Wing&quot; features Irish folk collective the Chieftains. The album&#x27;s title is derived from a lyric in the song &quot;Queen of Hollywood&quot;.

==Critical reception==
The record received generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic writer Becky Byrkit rated it four stars out of five and praised the band for their vocal harmonies, as well as the album&#x27;s consistency, writing that &quot;each and every cut sounds wired for radio play&quot;. She highlighted their cover of &quot;Little Wing&quot; as being the album&#x27;s &quot;best and most spirited Celtic cut&quot;. Stephen Segerman of South African music magazine &quot;Rock&quot; rated the album eight out of ten, and complimented it for incorporating a &quot;fuller and rockier atmosphere [than &quot;Forgiven, Not Forgotten&quot;]&quot;. He also praised the record for containing &quot;generous sprinklings of traditional Irish sounds and touches&quot;, which he said helped enhance the material.

The special edition of the album received mixed reviews from the American music press. James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticised Ballard&#x27;s production on &quot;Queen of Hollywood&quot; for &quot;forcing an Alanis-like edge where it&#x27;s unneeded&quot;, and called the David Foster-produced tracks &quot;goofy&quot;, but said that, &quot;otherwise, this is a high-flying reintroduction to some blue chip popsters.&quot; A writer for &quot;People&quot; was critical of the re-release, as well as the remixed tracks, calling it &quot;A collection of pretty, pop-lite tunes that could use more Celtic flavoring and less studio gloss, the album is best when harking back to the sounds of the Old Sod: reeling fiddles, soaring harmonies and the haunting tin whistle played by sister Andrea. Her lead vocals are as pretty to listen to as she and her sisters are to look at, but the string-sweetened arrangements are as bland and flat as a Dublin car park.&quot;

British rock magazine &quot;NME&quot; have retrospectively been highly critical of the album, placing it at number three in their 2014 list of &quot;25 unfathomably popular albums of the 90&#x27;s&quot;. The album also appeared in a 2016 article titled &quot;8 of the all-time best-selling albums in the UK [which] have no redeeming features whatsoever&quot;. In contrast, &quot;The Independent&quot; included it in their 2024 list of 20 most underrated albums ever at number 10, comparing it favourably to &quot;Come On Over&quot; (1997) by Shania Twain.

==Release and commercial performance==
The original edition of the album was released internationally on 17 October 1997, and was an immediate commercial success in several territories. Within five months of release, &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; had sold over a million copies worldwide, and was certified sextuple platinum in their home country, as well as double platinum in Australia and Spain, platinum in Denmark and New Zealand, and gold in both Japan and Sweden. Its commercial success elsewhere was initially modest, however, with the album debuting at number 23 in France and at number 56 in Germany. In the UK, it debuted at number 7, but would fall out of the top forty there within a month of release. &quot;Only When I Sleep&quot; and &quot;I Never Loved You Anyway&quot; were released as the album&#x27;s first two singles, with the former becoming a top ten hit in Ireland, while both songs peaked within the top forty of the Australian Singles Chart. &quot;What Can I Do&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single, and also went on to be a top forty hit in Ireland. All three singles failed to reach the top forty of the UK Singles Chart.

Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood joined the band at their concert in the Royal Albert Hall on 17 March 1998 during their performance of &quot;Dreams&quot;, which the band had recently contributed to the album &quot;Legacy: A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Rumours&quot;. The entire concert was broadcast live on BBC One as part of that organisation&#x27;s coverage of Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, and the event did much to raise the band&#x27;s profile. The cover would become the Corrs&#x27; first top forty hit in the UK, after it peaked at number six. The following month, &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; was reissued in numerous territories with &quot;Dreams&quot; included as a bonus track, and the album finally peaked at number one in the UK on 21 June 1998, its 35th week on the chart. This edition of the album was the first to be released in the United States. It was released on 5 May, and peaked at number 17 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers Albums. &quot;The Corrs: Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; was released in August.

===&quot;Talk on Corners: Special Edition&quot;===
A special edition of the record was released internationally on 9 November 1998. This revised edition contained five remixed tracks, several of which were then released or re-released as singles. The previously released remix of &quot;Dreams&quot; by Todd Terry was included, along with a previously unreleased K-Klass remix of &quot;So Young&quot;, as well as an alternate mix of &quot;I Never Loved You Anyway&quot;. English electronic music duo Tin Tin Out remixed a further two tracks: &quot;What Can I Do&quot; (which has been released as a single) and &quot;Runaway&quot;—a song from their debut album. Tin Tin Out enlisted European string ensemble the Duke Quartet to provide orchestration for both tracks. The former would go on to become the Corrs&#x27; first top three hit in the UK when it was released as a single, while the remix of &quot;Runaway&quot; became their highest-peaking single yet, after it peaked at number two behind Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;. &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;So Young&quot; have been certified silver by the BPI for sales in excess of 200,000 copies each, while &quot;What Can I Do&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot; were certified gold for sales of over 400,000 copies each. As of 2017, &quot;What Can I Do&quot; had sold 351,000 copies in the UK.

Following the success of the album in Europe and Australasia, an abridged version of the special edition was released in the US on 16 February 1999, and peaked at number 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. To promote this edition, the band performed as the opening act on several dates of The Rolling Stones&#x27; No Security Tour, as well as their own national concert tour and appearances on numerous talk shows: including &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. &quot;The Corrs: Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; was repeatedly aired on PBS.

This edition was the highest-selling incarnation of the album in several territories. &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; would go on to spend a total of ten weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart. On its final week atop the chart there, on the chart dated 4 April 1999, &quot;Forgiven, Not Forgotten&quot; reached a new peak of number two.

<text>Toby Spence (born 22 May 1969, London) is a British tenor active internationally on the concert platform, in the opera house and in recordings across a wide range of classical music.

==Early life and studies==
Spence was born into a musical family that had once owned the London piano manufacturer Squire Pianos. His father was a doctor, and his mother a pianist who worked as an archivist at the Royal College of Music. She had also been personal assistant to Walter Legge and Yehudi Menuhin, and artists and musicians were regular lunch guests at the family home. He was educated at Uppingham School and gained an honours degree in music at New College, Oxford, where he was a choral scholar and his teachers included Edward Higginbottom. He continued his vocal studies at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he studied with David Pollard with whom he has continued vocal studies. While still a student at Guildhall Spence appeared as Normanno in the Dorset Opera &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; in Sherborne in 1993.

==Career==
Spence&#x27;s professional debut was in 1995 as Idamante in Welsh National Opera&#x27;s production of &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras; he repeated the role later the same year in Munich after only one day of rehearsal. Other early engagements included &quot;La Calisto&quot; with René Jacobs in Brussels, Mitridate in &quot;Mitridate Rè di Ponto&quot; under Roger Norrington at the Mozart week in Salzburg, and subsequently at the Salzburg Summer Festival, Almaviva in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; at the English National Opera, and David in &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; under Antonio Pappano at La Monnaie in Brussels. At the same time he was performing on the concert platform in repertoire ranging from Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; to &quot;Saint François d&#x27;Assise&quot; by Messiaen.

Toby Spence has on-going connections with English National Opera (ENO), and is a strong believer of the policy of singing in English. He appeared in successive seasons at the Opéra National de Paris and also at the Bavarian State Opera (Bayerische Staatsoper). He was the first Ferdinand in Thomas Adès&#x27; opera &quot;The Tempest&quot; at Covent Garden, and reprised the role in the work&#x27;s American premiere production at Santa Fe Opera. He has since performed the role of Antonio in the same opera. Following &quot;The Tempest&quot; he has been invited back regularly to Covent Garden in operas by Rossini, Janáček and Wagner.

He made his Proms debut in 1997, in a performance of the Schubert Mass No. 5 in A flat, following this with Nielsen&#x27;s &quot;Springtime on Funen&quot; in 1999, the Bach St John Passion and &quot;Parsifal&quot; in 2000, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; in 2001, &quot;Les Troyens à Carthage&quot; in 2003, &quot;Les noces&quot; in 2004, the &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; in 2005, Delius &quot;A Song of the High Hills&quot; in 2009, Beethoven&#x27;s Choral Symphony in 2011, Ivor Novello songs and the Berlioz Requiem in 2012, Britten War Requiem in 2014, and Elgar &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; in 2015.

During 2005 and 2006 his stage roles ranged from Tamino in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; at the Teatro Real in Madrid and at ENO, to the Madwoman in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Curlew River&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival, Count Almaviva in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; at Covent Garden and Tom Rakewell in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;. The latter role was one Spence was keen to play from the start of his career, and he has sung it in several productions around the world.

Although he sang in some recitals at the beginning of his professional career, he was dissatisfied with the result and set song to one side for several years. When he resumed recitals his repertoire included Poulenc, Brahms and Britten, as well as the original version of &quot;Les nuits d&#x27;été&quot; with piano.

In an interview for the Paris Opera in 2008, Spence named Arsène Wenger as his non-musical hero. A man of keen and wide interests, he regularly visits galleries and is a keen concert and cinema goer. He enjoys travelling and in 2003 spent four weeks backpacking around Iran, visiting several cities. His marriage ended in divorce in 2001. In December 2011, he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and underwent surgery in February 2012 to remove his glands and lymph nodes. In May 2012, he received the award for Singer of the Year from the Royal Philharmonic Society, and that August sang in public at the Edinburgh Festival for the first time since his operation.

He made his debut as Aschenbach in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Death in Venice&quot; in 2021 (filmed) for the Opéra national du Rhin in Strasbourg, described by one critic as &quot;...powerfully voiced Aschenbach... disintegrate impressively, each utterance of &quot;I, Aschenbach&quot; refrain increasingly more wretched.&quot;

In 2012, Toby and his brother, Magnus Spence, founded a festival of song at Wardsbrook, a farm in East Sussex where Magnus lives with his family. Since its inauguration they have presented recitals by Stéphane Degout, Sarah Connolly, Sir Thomas Allen, Christiane Karg, Felicity Lott, Ian Bostridge and Gyula Orendt. The aim of Wardsbrook is to promote the art of song and raise much needed funds for St Michael&#x27;s Hospice in St Leonard&#x27;s, Hastings, which provides palliative care for the community. In the first two years they raised nearly £60,000 for the establishment and running costs of a service that providing home-care for the elderly.

==Recordings==
Toby Spence has participated in many varied recordings, including songs by Liza Lehmann, Robert Schumann and Arthur Bliss, the Duo de l&#x27;ouvreuse de l&#x27;Opéra-Comique et de l&#x27;employé du Bon Marché by Chabrier, and in Volumes 32 &amp; 35 of the Hyperion Schubert edition.

Other recordings included Parry&#x27;s &quot;Job&quot;, Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot;, &quot;Paroles tissées&quot; by Lutosławski, Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Vert-Vert&quot;, Berlioz&#x27;s Grande Messe des Morts, Op. 5 and &quot;Les Troyens,&quot;Handel&#x27;s La Resurrezione, HWV47, Finzi&#x27;s &quot;Dies natalis&quot;, Op. 8, &quot;La Rondine&quot;, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, Britten&#x27;s Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, Op. 31, Bantock&#x27;s &quot;Omar Khayyám&quot;, the title role in Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and Philip, Lord of Mirlemont in Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Beauty Stone&quot;.

<doc id="656192" wikidata="Q470800" url="?curid=656192" title="Anthony, Duke of Brabant">
<text>Anthony, Duke of Brabant, also known as Antoine de Brabant, Antoine de Bourgogne and Anthony of Burgundy (August 1384 – 25 October 1415), was Count of Rethel (1402–1406), Duke of Brabant, Lothier and Limburg (1406–1415), and Co-Duke of Luxemburg (1411-1415). He was killed at the battle of Agincourt.

== Biography ==
Anthony was the son of Philip II, Duke of Burgundy, and Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, and brother of John the Fearless. When his great-aunt Joanna died childless in 1406, Anthony inherited the Duchy of Brabant, Lothier, and Limburg.

The Duke of Brabant arrived late to the Battle of Agincourt, and in his eagerness to reach the field, he dressed in improvised armour and wore a surcoat made from a trumpeter&#x27;s flag. He fought valiantly but was captured by some English archers. He was executed along with the rest of the prisoners ordered by Henry V of England, the English being unaware of his high status and ransom value.

The execution was carried out as the much smaller English force found itself stretched to its limits, guarding prisoners with the battle still not won. A counterattack on the King&#x27;s baggage train (guarded only by women and children) is thought to have driven King Henry to the decision, thinking he was being attacked from the rear and some chroniclers have given Brabant&#x27;s belated charge as this very cause, adding to the Duke&#x27;s chivalric but tragic final story. Subsequently the executions stopped immediately when the attack was seen to falter.

== Marriages and family ==
Anthony married at Arras on 21 February 1402 Jeanne of Saint-Pol (d. 1407), daughter of Waleran III of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny and Saint-Pol. They had:
*John IV, Duke of Brabant (1403–1427)
*Philip of St. Pol (1404–1430), Duke of Brabant

Anthony married again at Brussels, on 16 July 1409, Elisabeth of Görlitz, duchess of Luxembourg (November 1390 – 8 August 1451), daughter of John, Duke of Görlitz. They had no children.

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Oakland Athletics (1985), Milwaukee Brewers (1987–90), New York Mets (1990–93), Atlanta Braves (1994–95), Toronto Blue Jays (1996–97), Chicago White Sox (1998), Anaheim Angels (1998–99) and Montreal Expos (2000).

O&#x27;Brien was a solid defensive catcher and a modest right-handed batter. He is best remembered for pioneering the hockey-style catcher&#x27;s mask, which he created while with the Blue Jays. During his tenure with the Braves, O&#x27;Brien was notable for being the personal catcher for Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Greg Maddux.

==Amateur career==
O&#x27;Brien grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, beginning to play baseball as a catcher at the age of 5. While growing up in Tulsa, O&#x27;Brien attended and graduated from Bishop Kelley High School. The Texas Rangers drafted O&#x27;Brien in the 14th round of the 1978 MLB draft, but did not sign him. O&#x27;Brien attended Wichita State University, where he played college baseball for the Wichita State Shockers baseball team. The Seattle Mariners drafted O&#x27;Brien in the 21st round of the 1981 MLB draft, but O&#x27;Brien did not sign, returning to college for his senior year.

In his senior year, O&#x27;Brien set school records, hitting 25 home runs and driving in 116 runs as the Shockers reached the finals of the 1982 College World Series. The Oakland Athletics drafted O&#x27;Brien in the fifth round of the 1982 MLB draft, and signed him. O&#x27;Brien made his MLB debut with the Athletics on June 2, 1985.

==Professional career==
The Athletics traded O&#x27;Brien with Steve Kiefer and minor leaguers Mike Fulmer and Pete Kendrick to the Milwaukee Brewers for Moose Haas. He batted .324 with 15 home runs and 74 RBI with the El Paso Diablos of the Class AA Texas League in 1986.

The Brewers traded O&#x27;Brien and a player to be named later (minor leaguer Kevin Carmody) to the New York Mets with players to be named later (Julio Machado and Kevin Brown) in August 1990. He began the 1991 season as the starting catcher, ahead of Mackey Sasser and served as a backup to Todd Hundley when the latter was promoted.

O&#x27;Brien agreed to a $370,000 contract for the 1992 season. He was granted free agency for the 1993 season, and he signed with the Atlanta Braves on a two-year contract worth $1.1 million. He was a member of the 1995 World Series champions, and hit a key home run for the Braves during the 1995 National League Championship Series.

After the 1995 season, O&#x27;Brien became a free agent and signed with the Toronto Blue Jays on a two-year contract. He signed with the Chicago White Sox for the 1998 season in order to share the catching position with Chad Kreuter, but was traded to the Anaheim Angels for minor leaguers Brian Tokarse and Jason Stockstill in July 1998. The Angels released O&#x27;Brien on August 6, 1999, replacing him with Benjie Molina. Now 40, O&#x27;Brien signed with the Montreal Expos for the 2000 season, but his success at preventing stolen bases had diminished. The Expos released O&#x27;Brien on June 22, 2000.

Over the course of his career, O&#x27;Brien caught eleven different Cy Young Award winners: Frank Viola, Dwight Gooden, Bret Saberhagen, David Cone, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Pat Hentgen, Roger Clemens, Chris Carpenter and Jack McDowell. However, he only caught three of these pitchers during Cy Young seasons—Clemens, Hentgen &amp; Maddux. During Maddux&#x27;s 1994 and 1995 seasons when he posted ERA&#x27;s of 1.56 and 1.63 respectively, O&#x27;Brien generally served as Maddux&#x27;s personal catcher. O&#x27;Brien later testified at Clemens&#x27; perjury trial. He is one of the few players to play both major league Canadian teams, the Toronto Blue Jays and the Montreal Expos.

After getting hit in his mask by two consecutive foul-tip balls in a game, O&#x27;Brien had the idea for a new catcher&#x27;s mask while watching a hockey game. He then worked with Van Velden Mask Inc., of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, to develop his idea. The new design, called the &quot;All-Star MVP&quot;, was approved in 1996 by Major League Baseball.

In his 15-year career, O&#x27;Brien batted .221 with 56 home runs and 261 runs batted in.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Brien is an avid deer hunter.

<doc id="656218" wikidata="Q137937" url="?curid=656218" title="Souterrain">
<text>Souterrain (from French &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;subterrain&quot;, is a name given by archaeologists to a type of underground structure associated mainly with the European Atlantic Iron Age.

These structures appear to have been brought northwards from Gaul during the late Iron Age. Regional names include earth houses, fogous and Pictish houses. The term &quot;souterrain&quot; has been used as a distinct term from &quot;fogou&quot; meaning &#x27;cave&#x27;. In Cornwall the regional name of &quot;fogou&quot; (Cornish for &#x27;cave&#x27;) is applied to souterrain structures. The design of underground structures has been shown to differ among regions; for example, in western Cornwall the design and function of the fogou appears to correlate with a larder use.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;souterrain&quot; comes from the French language (&quot;sous-terrain&quot; or &quot;souterrain&quot;), in which it means &quot;underground passageway&quot; or refers to subterranea in general. In languages other than English, it is sometimes used to mean &quot;basement&quot;, especially in warehouses, or semi-basement.

== Construction and suggested purpose ==

Souterrains are underground galleries and, in their early stages, were always associated with a settlement. The galleries were dug out and then lined with stone slabs or wood before being reburied. In cases where they were cut into rock this was not always necessary. They do not appear to have been used for burial or ritual purposes and it has been suggested that they were food stores or hiding places during times of strife, although some of them would have had very obvious entrances.

==Examples==
=== Brechin ===
An example of a wood-lined Iron Age souterrain with a possible water tank was excavated in 2016 at Brechin Farm, Angus by Headland Archaeology. It was in total length and was constructed in a &#x27;C&#x27; shape with two distinct chambers. A linear ditch was located immediately adjacent to the souterrain and was connected to the southwest chamber by a tunnel. This tunnel sloped gently downwards towards the chamber and its edges were iron-panned, indicating that water had run through it for a significant amount of time. This indicates the southwest chamber was used as some kind of water collection and storage system. The soil into which the souterrain was dug was soft sand that would have been impossible to maintain without a lining; the presence of stake holes along the edge of the northeast chamber and the lack of stones means that the walls would have been wood-lined. Radiocarbon dating suggests occupation between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD.

=== Rosal ===
An example of an excavated souterrain is the site at Rosal, Strathnaver, Sutherland. In this excavation, no artefacts or other finds were made inside the structure and the roof may have been only partially covered with stones, a timber roof being present on part of it. It was suggested that the souterrain could have been used as a byre or barn and it was associated with an abandoned settlement.

=== Castle Bloody ===
An example of a partially explored souterrain in northern Scotland, on Shapinsay in the Orkney Islands is Castle Bloody, situated near the seacoast. Another example has been excavated in Perthshire near Alyth.

In Scotland some souterrains may be connected with the same people who built brochs.

=== Newtownbalregan ===
A well-illustrated account of a souterrain excavated at Newtownbalregan, County Louth, one of the many souterrains discovered during a road-building project in Ireland, may be found in &quot;Archaeology Ireland&quot; Winter 2003 issue.

=== Farrandreg ===
A full report on the excavation of a three-level souterrain at Farrandreg, County Louth, in 1998 gives references for the 14 souterrains previously excavated in this souterrain-rich county. Finds included a rotary quern-stone (a grinding stone), a bone comb, a copper-alloy stick pin, three bone needles and the greater part of a tub-shaped pottery vessel in ‘Souterrain ware.’ Based on the finds, the excavator concluded the souterrain had been closed up in the 12th century.

=== Other Irish souterrains ===
Souterrains often are referred to in Ireland simply as ‘caves.’ A. T. Lucas, a folklorist and director of the National Museum of Ireland in the 1960s, published a series of articles on the references to souterrains in the early Irish annals. Donaghmore Souterrain, discovered in County Louth in 1960, and Drumlohan Souterrain in County Waterford are the only souterrains to be an Irish National Monument.

In Ireland, souterrains often are found inside or in close proximity to a ringfort and as such are thought to be mainly contemporary with them, making them somewhat later in date than in other countries. This date is reinforced by many examples where ogham stones dating to around the 6th century have been reused as roofing lintels or door posts, most notably at the widened natural limestone fissure at the ‘Cave of the Cats’ in Rathcrogan. The distribution of souterrains is very uneven in Ireland, with the greatest concentrations occurring in north Louth, north Antrim, south Galway, and west Cork and Kerry. Lesser numbers are found in counties Meath, Westmeath, Mayo, north Donegal, and Waterford. Other counties, such as Limerick, Carlow, and Wexford, are almost completely lacking in examples.

An article by Warner on the archaeology of souterrains, although published years ago, still is possibly the best general overview of the subject.

The most comprehensive study of Irish souterrains is M. Clinton&#x27;s 2001 work, containing chapters on distribution, associated settlements, function, finds, chronology and 13 appendices on various structural aspects of souterrains.

A short summary account of souterrains in Ireland appeared in the quarterly magazine &quot;Archaeology Ireland&quot; in 2004.

<doc id="656221" wikidata="Q765780" url="?curid=656221" title="Augusta National Golf Club">
<text>Augusta National Golf Club, sometimes referred to as Augusta National, Augusta, or the National, is a golf club in Augusta, Georgia, United States. Unlike most private clubs which operate as non-profits, Augusta National is a for-profit corporation, and it does not disclose its income, holdings, membership list, or ticket sales.

Founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts, the course was designed by Jones and Alister MacKenzie and opened for play in 1932. Since 1934, the club has played host to the annual Masters Tournament, one of the four men&#x27;s major championships in professional golf, and the only major played each year at the same course. It was the top-ranked course in &quot;Golf Digest&quot;″s 2009 list of America&#x27;s 100 greatest courses and was the number ten-ranked course based on course architecture on &quot;Golfweek Magazine&quot;″s 2011 list of best classic courses in the United States.

In 2019, the course began co-hosting the Augusta National Women&#x27;s Amateur with Champions Retreat Golf Club.

==History==
Augusta National was founded in 1932 by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts on the 365-acre site of a former nursery/antebellum plantation called Fruitland (later Fruitlands). Jones sought to create a world-class winter golf course in his native state of Georgia. During the first decade of the club&#x27;s existence, membership was low and finances were short due to the Great Depression and the relatively remote location of Augusta, forcing the duo to scrap future plans for a &quot;ladies&#x27; course&quot;, squash and tennis courts, and various estates.

Its first club professional was Ed Dudley, who served in the role until 1957; Dudley was one of the top tournament professionals of his era, with 15 wins on the PGA Tour.

The Masters was first held in 1934 in an attempt to attract crowds and players. Roberts persuaded Jones, then retired, to return to play in the tournament. (Jones initially was against the name &quot;Masters&quot;.)

In 1948, Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife Mamie were personally invited to Augusta by Roberts. Eisenhower took a liking to the club, becoming a member, and hired Roberts as his executor and financial advisor, who had a house (Eisenhower Cabin) constructed for Eisenhower on the grounds. During his presidency, Eisenhower visited Augusta National 29 times.

==Facilities and grounds==

Augusta is renowned for its well-maintained impeccable appearance: pine needles are imported, bird sounds are played on inconspicuous speakers, and even the ponds were once dyed blue. The club is famed for its azaleas and dogwoods.

Rules and policies imposed on employees, club members, and visitors (referred to internally as &quot;patrons&quot;) are notoriously strict. No cell phones or other electronic devices are permitted (except in the press building—spot checks are performed elsewhere); no running or loud talking is allowed; and spectators are not allowed to cheer when a player makes a mistake. Security guards enforce these rules, and are traditionally provided by Pinkerton. Rule-breakers are permanently banned, if not prosecuted when possible.

Other notable facilities include Butler Cabin, near hole 18, where tournament winners are presented with a green jacket; the clubhouse, near hole 1, which dates to the 1850s and has a well-stocked wine cellar; and a practice range. Three large cabins on the property are reserved for tournament sponsors—as of 2020, Mercedes-Benz, IBM, and AT&amp;T.

The club&#x27;s on-site press building has television studios, a complimentary restaurant and snack options, staffed bathrooms, and leather chairs. Cameras placed throughout the course are directly connected to the press building&#x27;s studios via underground cables.

===Berckmans Place===
Berckmans Place, sometimes called Berckmans or BP, is a 90,000-sq.-ft. non-public shopping and dining complex built in 2012. It operates for one week each year, during the Masters. Entry passes for the week cost $10,000 (up from $6,000) and require Augusta National&#x27;s approval; there is a 10-ticket limit. As in the rest of the club, neither cell phones nor photography are allowed. The price includes free dining at Berckmans&#x27; five full-service restaurants, each of which can seat hundreds of guests: Augusta&#x27;s Seafood, Calamity Jane&#x27;s, Ike&#x27;s Place, MacKenzie&#x27;s Pub, and the Pavilion. Bathroom stalls are attended and cleaned after each use. There is a pro shop and four putting greens dubbed the &quot;Putting Experience&quot;: three slightly smaller replicas of holes 7, 14, and 16; and a &quot;composite course&quot;. BP customers can use an exclusive parking lot and entryway (Gate 9). The complex is located near hole 5.

Berckmans Place is named after Belgian Louis Mathieu Berckmans, whose family owned the land the club is built on from 1858 to 1910.

===Course===

The course was formerly a plant nursery, and each hole on the course is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated. Several of the holes on the first nine have been renamed, as well as hole #11.



Lengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:
Unlike most other private or public golf courses in the US, Augusta National has never been rated. During the 1990 Masters Tournament, a team of USGA raters, organized by &quot;Golf Digest&quot;, evaluated the course and gave it an unofficial rating of 76.2. It was re-evaluated in 2009 and given an unofficial rating of 78.1.

The course&#x27;s greens are meticulously maintained to provide a fast and hard golfing surface. This firmness is assisted by an underground irrigation and ventilation system known as the SubAir System, developed and installed in 1994 by course superintendent Marsh Benson. SubAir soon evolved into its own company in nearby Graniteville, South Carolina, designing and installing similar automatic water suction systems in venues such as Pebble Beach, East Lake, Citi Field, and Citizens Bank Park.

The bunkers are filled not with traditional sand but with granulated quartz (known as &quot;Spruce Pine sand&quot; and SP55) which is produced as a byproduct during work at feldspar mines in the Spruce Pine Mining District in and around Spruce Pine, North Carolina. Augusta has been using Spruce Pine sand to fill its forty-four bunkers since the early 1970s, when Clifford Roberts visited Linville Golf Club in Linville, North Carolina, which used the material at the time. Since the mining company providing the sand refused payment, in exchange Roberts offered to host the company owner at Augusta at any time, and later gifted him six Masters passes.

The golf course architecture website GolfClubAtlas.com has said, &quot;Augusta National has gone through more changes since its inception than any of the world&#x27;s twenty or so greatest courses. To call it a MacKenzie course is false advertising as his features are essentially long gone and his routing is all that is left.&quot; The authors of the site also add that MacKenzie and Jones were heavily influenced by the Old Course at St Andrews, and intended that the ground game be central to the course. Almost from Augusta&#x27;s opening, Roberts sought to make changes to minimize the ground game, and effectively got free rein to do so because MacKenzie died shortly after the course&#x27;s opening and Jones went into inactivity due to World War II and then a crippling illness. The authors add that &quot;[w]ith the ground game gone, the course was especially vulnerable to changes in technology, and this brought on a slew of changes from at least 15 different &#x27;architects&#x27;.&quot; Golf Course Histories has an aerial comparison of the architectural changes for Augusta National Golf Club for the year 1938 versus 2013.

Among the changes to the course were several made by architect Perry Maxwell in 1937, including an important alteration involving the current 10th hole. When Augusta National originally opened for play in January 1933, the opening hole (now the 10th) was a relatively benign par 4 that played just in excess of 400 yards. From an elevated tee, the hole required little more than a short iron or wedge for the approach. Maxwell moved the green in 1937 to its present location—on top of the hill, about 50 yards back from the old site—and transformed it into the toughest hole in Masters Tournament history. Ben Crenshaw referred to Maxwell&#x27;s work on the 10th hole as &quot;one of the great strokes in golf architecture&quot;.

For the 1999 tournament, a short rough was instated around the fairways. Referred to as the &quot;second cut&quot;, it is substantially shorter than the comparable primary rough at other courses, with an average length of . It is meant to reduce a player&#x27;s ability to control the ball coming out of this lie, and encourage better accuracy for driving onto the fairway.

====Amen Corner====
The second shot at the 11th, all of the 12th, and the first two shots at the 13th hole at Augusta are nicknamed &quot;Amen Corner&quot;. This term was first used in print by author Herbert Warren Wind in his April 21, 1958, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article about the Masters that year. In a &quot;Golf Digest&quot; article in April 1984, 26 years later, Wind told about its origin. He said he wanted a catchy phrase like baseball&#x27;s &quot;hot-corner&quot; or American football&#x27;s &quot;coffin-corner&quot; to explain where some of the most exciting golf had taken place (the Palmer-Venturi rules issue at twelve, over an embedded ball ruling and how it was handled, in particular). Thus &quot;Amen Corner&quot; was born. He said it came from the title of a jazz record he had heard in the mid-1930s by a group led by Chicago&#x27;s Mezz Mezzrow, &quot;Shouting in that Amen Corner&quot;.

In a &quot;Golf Digest&quot; article in April 2008, writer Bill Fields offered new updated information about the origin of the name. He wrote that Richard Moore, a golf and jazz historian from South Carolina, tried to purchase a copy of the old Mezzrow 78 RPM disc for an &quot;Amen Corner&quot; exhibit he was putting together for his Golf Museum at Ahmic Lake, Ontario. After extensive research, Moore found that the record never existed. As Moore put it, Wind, himself a jazz buff, must have &quot;unfortunately bogeyed his mind, 26 years later&quot;. While at Yale, he was no doubt familiar with, and meant all along, the popular version of the song (with the correct title, &quot;Shoutin&#x27; in that Amen Corner&quot; written by Andy Razaf), which was recorded by the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra, vocal by Mildred Bailey (Brunswick label No. 6655) in 1935. Moore told Fields that, being a great admirer of Wind&#x27;s work over the years, he was reluctant, for months, to come forth with his discovery that contradicted Wind&#x27;s memory. Moore&#x27;s discovery was first reported in &quot;Golf World&quot; magazine in 2007, before Fields&#x27; longer article in &quot;Golf Digest&quot; in 2008.

In 1958, Arnold Palmer outlasted Ken Venturi to win the tournament with heroic escapes at Amen Corner. Amen Corner also played host to Masters moments such as Byron Nelson&#x27;s birdie-eagle at 12 and 13 in 1937, and Sam Snead&#x27;s water save at 12 in 1949 that sparked him to victory. On the flip side of fate, Jordan Spieth&#x27;s quadruple bogey on 12 during Sunday&#x27;s final round in 2016 cost him his 2-stroke lead and ultimately the championship.

====&quot;The Big Oak Tree&quot;====
&quot;The Big Oak Tree&quot; is on the golf course side of the clubhouse and was planted in the 1850s.

====Eisenhower Tree====
Also known as the &quot;Eisenhower Pine&quot;, a loblolly pine was located on the 17th hole, about from the Masters tee. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, an Augusta National member, hit the tree so many times that, at a 1956 club meeting, he proposed that it be cut down. Not wanting to offend the president, the club&#x27;s chairman, Clifford Roberts, immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request. In February 2014, the Eisenhower Tree was removed after suffering extensive damage during an ice storm.

====Ike&#x27;s Pond====
During a visit to Augusta National, then-General Eisenhower returned from a walk through the woods on the eastern part of the grounds, and informed Clifford Roberts that he had found a perfect place to build a dam if the club would like a fish pond. Ike&#x27;s Pond was built for Eisenhower to fish in and named after him; the dam is located just where Eisenhower said it should be.

Roberts died of suicide next to Ike&#x27;s Pond on September 29, 1977.

====Rae&#x27;s Creek====
Rae&#x27;s Creek cuts across the southeastern corner of the Augusta National property. Rae&#x27;s Creek runs in front of No. 12 green, has a tributary evident at No. 13 tee, and flows at the back of No. 11 green. This is the lowest point in elevation of the course. The Hogan and Nelson Bridges cross the creek after the 12th and 13th tee boxes, respectively. The creek was named after former property owner John Rae, who died in 1789. It was Rae&#x27;s house which was the farthest fortress up the Savannah River from Fort Augusta. The house kept residents safe during Indian attacks when the fort was out of reach.

====Sarazen Bridge====
The Sarazen Bridge was the first to be named for a player. It is a flat stone footbridge covering the dam to the left of the pond in front of the 15th green, the scene of Gene Sarazen&#x27;s &quot;shot heard round the world&quot; in the 1935 Masters Tournament. There is a plaque on the bridge, that reads: &quot;Erected to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the famous &quot;double eagle&quot; scored by Gene Sarazen on this hole, April 7, 1935, which gained him a tie for first place with Craig Wood and in the play-off won the second Masters Tournament. Dedicated April 6, 1955.&quot;

===Real estate===
Over the decades, Augusta National has bought and redeveloped nearby land. From 1999 to 2019, the club spent about $200 million to buy 100 separate properties totaling over 270 acres, some more than a mile distant from the club proper. Most purchases are arranged via LLCs connected to Augusta National in order to obfuscate the transaction&#x27;s details. More than a dozen of these LLCs are known to exist, and up to five may be involved in a single purchase. Augusta National ultimately purchases each LLC, acquiring its land holdings and keeping the real estate price away from public records. Non-disclosure agreements are also commonly employed.

Augusta National has acquired, demolished, and redeveloped entire strip centers and residential blocks. The organization helped finance a project to re-route Berckmans Road. The club also built a large tunnel underneath Washington Road connecting to a Global Communication Center that was first used in the 2021 Masters Tournament. The tunnel was built without ever impeding traffic on Washington Rd above, and is large enough for an 18 wheeler to drive through.

Because Augusta National has spent so much to acquire land, homeowners in Richmond County have had to apply for special property tax assessments in order to negate the effects of the club&#x27;s activities. Investors have also begun to purchase property and condos next to Augusta National.

==Membership==
Augusta National Golf Club has about 300 members at any given time. Membership is strictly by invitation: there is no application process. In 2004, &quot;USA Today&quot; published a list of all the current members. Membership is believed to cost between $100,000 and $300,000 and annual dues were estimated in 2020 to be less than $30,000 per year. Club members are sometimes referred to as &quot;green jackets&quot;.

For decades, the club barred membership to African Americans. &quot;As long as I&#x27;m alive,&quot; said co-founder Roberts, who subsequently served as the club&#x27;s chairman, &quot;all the golfers will be white and all the caddies will be black.&quot;

Augusta invited and accepted its first African-American member, television executive Ron Townsend, in 1990 after Shoal Creek Golf and Country Club, an all-white golf club in Alabama, refused membership to African-Americans. The club also faced demands that the PGA Championship not be held there because of racist comments by the club&#x27;s founder.

In his 2012 pre-Masters press conference, Chairman Billy Payne declined to discuss the club&#x27;s refusal to admit women. He defended the club&#x27;s position by noting that in 2011, more than 15% of the non-tournament rounds were played by women who were guests or spouses of active members. However, on August 20, 2012, Augusta National admitted its first two female members: Condoleezza Rice and Darla Moore.

Chairmen serve for an indefinite amount of time. The chairman is the only person officially authorized to publicly discuss the Masters.

In 1966, the governing board of Augusta National passed a resolution honoring founder Bobby Jones with the position of President in Perpetuity.

===2002 membership controversy===
Augusta National and its then-Chairman Hootie Johnson are widely known for their disagreement, beginning in 2002, with Martha Burk, then chair of the Washington-based National Council of Women&#x27;s Organizations; the dispute arose over Augusta National&#x27;s refusal to admit female members to the club. Burk said she found out about the club&#x27;s policies in a &quot;USA Today&quot; column published April 11, 2002. She then wrote a private letter to Johnson, saying that hosting the Masters Tournament at a male-only club constituted sexism. Johnson characterized Burk&#x27;s approach as &quot;offensive and coercive&quot;. The club hired consulting firm WomanTrend, which ran a survey and found that &quot;Augusta National&#x27;s membership policies were not topmost on the list of women&#x27;s concerns&quot;; the poll was called &quot;unethical&quot; by Burk. Responding to efforts to link the issue to sexism and civil rights, Johnson maintained that the issue had to do with the rights of any private club:
Burk, whose childhood nickname was also Hootie, claimed to have been &quot;called a man hater, anti-family, lesbian, all the usual things.&quot; Johnson was portrayed as a Senator Claghorn type—&quot;a blustery defender of all things Southern&quot;.

Following the discord, two club members resigned: Thomas H. Wyman, a former CEO of CBS, and John Snow, when President George W. Bush nominated him to serve as Secretary of the Treasury. Pressure on corporate sponsors led the club to broadcast the 2003 and 2004 tournaments without commercials. The controversy was discussed by the International Olympic Committee when re-examining whether golf meets Olympic criteria of a &quot;sport practiced without discrimination with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play&quot;. Augusta National extended membership to Condoleezza Rice and Darla Moore on August 20, 2012.

In 2018, chairman Fred Ridley announced that the club would establish the Augusta National Women&#x27;s Amateur Championship in 2019, a 54-hole event for the world&#x27;s top amateur players.

==Green jacket==
Every member of Augusta National receives a green sport coat with the club&#x27;s logo on the left breast. Members are required to wear them during the tournament, and the jackets are not allowed to be removed from the grounds. The idea of the green jacket originated with club co-founder Clifford Roberts. Many believe it was because he wanted patrons visiting during the tournament to be able to readily identify members. Since Sam Snead&#x27;s victory in 1949, the winner of each year&#x27;s Masters Tournament has received a green jacket, although he does not receive membership. The jacket is presented to the new winner by the winner of the previous tournament. If the previous champion is either unavailable or has won consecutive tournaments, then the current chairman acts as the presenter. Until 1967, the jackets were manufactured by Brooks Brothers and since have been made by Hamilton of Cincinnati, Ohio, with the imp wool produced at the Victor Forstmann plant in Dublin, Georgia.

The current Masters champion is the only owner of a green jacket permitted to remove it from the grounds of Augusta National, and only for a period of one year. Before this time limit was in place, the jacket of a few long-past Masters champions had been sold, after their deaths, to collectors. Consequently, the members of Augusta National have gone to great lengths to secure the remaining examples. Now, two jackets remain outside the grounds of Augusta National with the club&#x27;s permission. When Gary Player first won the Masters in 1961, he brought his jacket home to South Africa. For years the board insisted that Player return the jacket but Player kept &quot;forgetting&quot; or coming up with humorous creative excuses why he did not return the jacket. After becoming something of a running joke, Augusta National&#x27;s members allowed him to keep it, where it is on display in his personal museum. The second jacket belongs to 1938 champion Henry Picard. Before the traditions were well established, the jacket was removed by Picard from Augusta National. It is now currently on display in the &quot;Picard Lounge&quot; at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio. Along with Snead, the nine previous winners were also awarded green jackets in 1949, and these became known as the &quot;original ten&quot; jackets.

Horton Smith&#x27;s jacket, awarded for his wins in 1934 and 1936, sold at auction in September 2013 for over $682,000; the highest price ever paid for a piece of golf memorabilia. Smith died at age 55 in 1963 and it had been in the possession of his brother Ren&#x27;s stepsons for decades.

The trademarked green shade is specified as Pantone 342.

==Caddies==
Augusta National employs a staff of caddies to assist members, guests, and professionals. Augusta&#x27;s caddie staff wears trademark white jumpsuits year-round.

Before 1983, staff caddies were assigned to players at the Masters. All four majors and some tour events required the use of the host club&#x27;s caddies well into the 1970s—the U.S. Open had this policy through 1975—but by 1980, only the Masters and the Western Open near Chicago retained the requirement. Well-known caddies during this time period include Nathaniel &quot;Iron Man&quot; Avery, Carl Jackson, and Willie &quot;Pappy&quot; Stokes.

More unusually, Augusta employed only black men as caddies. Club co-founder Clifford Roberts once said, &quot;As long as I&#x27;m alive, all the golfers will be white and all the caddies will be black.&quot; Roberts killed himself at Augusta in 1977; five years later, in November 1982, chairman Hord Hardin announced that players were henceforth permitted to use their regular caddies at the Masters. The announcement arrived seven months after the 1982 tournament, during which many caddies, confused by a Thursday rain delay, failed to show up at the proper time on Friday morning; Hardin received scathing complaint letters from two-time champion Tom Watson and others. In 1983, 12 players employed club caddies, including then-five-time champion Jack Nicklaus, defending champion Craig Stadler, and future two-time champion Ben Crenshaw.

The first female caddie at Augusta was George Archer&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth in 1983, her 21st event carrying the bag for her father. Archer, the 1969 champion, tied for twelfth, one of his better finishes at Augusta. Today, female caddies remain rare at Augusta and on the PGA Tour; most of the women caddies are professional golfers&#x27; regular caddies, such as Fanny Sunesson, who has caddied for several players at the Masters, most notably three-time champion Nick Faldo, and in 2019, Henrik Stenson.

During the pre-tournament events in 2007, Golf Channel&#x27;s Kelly Tilghman caddied for Arnold Palmer in the par-3 contest. Fuzzy Zoeller&#x27;s daughter Gretchen was his caddie for his last year as a competitor in the tournament in 2009. Tennis pro Caroline Wozniacki, then-fiancée of Rory McIlroy, caddied for him in the par-3 contests of 2013 and 2014.

Crenshaw won his 1984 and 1995 Masters titles with Augusta National caddie Carl Jackson.

==Incidents==
On October 22, 1983, Charles Harris, an unemployed local man, crashed his Dodge pickup truck through Gate 3 while President Ronald Reagan was on the golf course. Armed with a .38 caliber revolver, Harris took six people hostage in the pro shop, four employees and two White House staffers. Police and Secret Service agents placed a phone call to Harris in the pro shop and put the president on the line, but Harris thought it was a trick and hung up. Once Reagan had been evacuated from the club, Harris surrendered. He was later convicted of false imprisonment and sentenced to five years in prison. He claimed he meant no harm to the president and had only wanted to speak with him about unemployment issues.

==Appearances in video games==
Augusta National Golf Club is featured in the Japan-exclusive video game franchise &quot;&quot;, which started in 1989. The games were produced by T&amp;E Soft. One of its last titles &quot;Masters &#x27;98: Haruka Naru Augusta&quot; was released for the Nintendo 64.

Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters Tournament are also featured in the video game &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12: The Masters&quot;, and has subsequently featured in later iterations of the game. This was the first time that the course has been officially used in the &quot;Tiger Woods&quot; franchise. In 2021, EA Sports and Augusta National Golf Club announced plans to revive their PGA Tour series, which would once again feature Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters Tournament. In addition, EA also announced that the new game, &quot;EA Sports PGA Tour,&quot; will feature the other three majors—the PGA Championship, Open Championship, and the U.S. Open.

Augusta National was also previously used in the 1986 computer game &quot;Mean 18&quot;, published by Accolade.

<doc id="656222" wikidata="Q6489113" url="?curid=656222" title="Large burgh">
<text>Large burgh was a type of municipal structure in Scotland, which existed from 1930 to 1975.

==History==
When county councils had been established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, there were 26 burghs which were excluded from county council control. Many other burghs were within the area controlled by county councils, having various functions as lower-tier authorities. The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 made extensive reforms to the structure of local government, including bringing all but four burghs under the control of a county council; the exceptions were Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow, which were all classed as counties of cities.

The burghs under county council control after 1930 were then classed as either small burghs or large burghs. Whilst the county councils provided some services in large burghs (notably education), the large burghs retained extensive responsibilities. The list of large burghs substantially overlapped with the list of burghs which had been outside county council control prior to 1930.

The large burghs were:

*Airdrie
*Arbroath
*Ayr
*Clydebank
*Coatbridge
*Dumbarton
*Dumfries
*Dunfermline
*East Kilbride (made a large burgh in 1967)
*Falkirk
*Greenock
*Hamilton
*Inverness
*Kilmarnock
*Kirkcaldy
*Motherwell and Wishaw
*Paisley
*Perth
*Port Glasgow
*Rutherglen
*Stirling
Of the large burghs created in 1930, only four had not been previously independent from a county council, being Clydebank, Coatbridge, Falkirk, and Rutherglen. Conversely, there were six burghs which had previously been independent but were not made large burghs in 1930, being Brechin, Elgin, Forfar, Galashiels, Hawick, and Montrose.

All burghs in Scotland were abolished in 1975 and replaced with the uniform system of districts and regions, which is itself now defunct. (See Subdivisions of Scotland for the modern units of local government in the country.)

<doc id="656230" wikidata="Q28216" url="?curid=656230" title="Boxer (armoured fighting vehicle)">
<text>The Boxer is family of armoured fighting vehicles designed by an international consortium to accomplish a number of operations through the use of installable mission modules. The governments participating in the Boxer programme have changed as the programme has developed. The Boxer vehicle is produced by the ARTEC GmbH (&quot;armoured vehicle technology&quot;) industrial group, and the programme is being managed by OCCAR (Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation). ARTEC GmbH is based in Munich; its parent companies are KNDS Deutschland GmbH &amp; Co and Rheinmetall Land Systeme GmbH on the German side, (with Australian factory) and Rheinmetall Defence Nederland B.V. for the Netherlands. Overall, Rheinmetall has a 64% stake in the joint venture.

A distinctive and unique feature of the vehicle is its composition of a drive module and interchangeable mission modules which allow several configurations to meet different operational requirements. The drive module has been produced in the following build configurations: A0, A1, A2, A3 and an A2/A3 hybrid. These configuration changes are the result of improvements resulting primarily from the mission in Afghanistan, and modifications required by some users. The main changes are in protection levels (increased), uprated suspension to account for a weight increase, and the powerpack.

Other names in use or previously used for Boxer are GTK (&#x27;; &quot;armoured transport vehicle&quot;) Boxer andMRAV&quot;&#x27; (&quot;Multi-Role Armoured Vehicle&quot;). GTK is the official Bundeswehr designation for Boxer. Confirmed Boxer customers as of February 2025 are Germany, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Australia, the UK, Ukraine, and Qatar. 

==Production history==
&quot;With exceptions for style and ease of reading, the following development and production history is presented in as near-chronological order as possible.&quot;

The Boxer started in 1993 as a joint venture design project between Germany and France, with the UK joining the project in 1996. In November 1999, a £70 million contract for eight prototype vehicles (four each, Germany and the UK) was awarded. France left the programme in 1999 to pursue its own design, the Véhicule Blindé de Combat d&#x27;Infanterie (VBCI). In February 2001, the Netherlands joined the programme and an additional four prototypes were built for the Netherlands. Boxer, then known as GTK/MRAV/PWV, was unveiled on 12 December 2002. The name Boxer was announced when the second prototype appeared. At this time the first production run was to have been 200 for each country.

The UK Ministry of Defence announced its intention to withdraw from the Boxer programme and focus on the Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) in July 2003. In October 2003, the first Dutch prototype was delivered. In October 2006 the Netherlands confirmed the procurement of 200 Boxers to replace the M577 and the support variants of the YPR-765 in the Royal Netherlands Army. Deliveries were scheduled to run from 2013 through to 2018, and within the RNLA the baseline Boxer is called the &quot;Pantserwielvoertuig&quot; (PWV), “Armour[ed] Wheel[ed] Vehicle“.

On 13 December 2006 the German parliament approved the procurement of 272 Boxers for the German Army, to replace some of its M113 and TPz 1 Fuchs vehicles, although as of Q2 2024 no TPz 1 Fuchs have been replaced by delivered Boxer. Production of Boxers had been scheduled to commence in 2004, but production was delayed and the first production example was delivered to the German Army in September 2009. Over seven years, prototypes accrued over 90,000 km of reliability trials and over 90,000 km of durability trials. At this time there were three confirmed production facilities for Boxer, one in the Netherlands (Rheinmetall) and two in Germany (Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall). The original German Boxer order covered 125 APC, 65 command vehicles, 72 ambulance, and 12 driver training vehicles.

=== 2010s ===

In December 2015 it was announced that Germany had ordered an additional 131 Boxers worth EUR476 million and that Lithuania had selected the Boxer.

In August 2016 a EUR385.6 million production contract was placed by Lithuania for the supply of 88 Boxers, and at this time it was stated that 53 Boxers would be manufactured by KMW and the remaining 35 by Rheinmetall, with deliveries running 2017–2023. In Lithuanian service, the vehicle is designated as Vilkas (Wolf). The precise mix/number of Lithuanian vehicles was initially unclear but according to Janes, Lithuania would receive 91 Boxers in the A2 configuration, 89 as variants of the baseline IFV configuration, plus two driver-training vehicles. The exact breakdown being 55 squad-leader, 18 platoon-leader, 12 company-leader, and 4 command-post vehicles. A single IFV would be used for maintenance training. The first two vehicles (driver training configuration) were delivered in December 2017. The first two Boxer in IFV configuration were delivered in June 2019 and at this time the Lithuanian MoD stated that 15 vehicles would be delivered in 2019 and that all 89 IFV variants would be delivered by the end of 2023.

Most of the original German Army Boxer order was delivered in the A1 configuration. 40 APC and 16 command posts, however, were delivered in the A0 configuration; these were subsequently upgraded to the A1 configuration. In June 2017 it was announced that the Bundeswehr&#x27;s Boxer A1 fleet would be upgraded to A2 standard. The first A2 Boxer was delivered in June 2015. The differences between A1 and A2 configurations are relatively minor electrical and mechanical engineering changes. The A2 standard resulted from operations in Afghanistan and incorporates changes in the drive and mission modules that include preparation for the integration of a driver vision system, changes to the stowage concept in both modules, changes to the gearbox, integration of a fire suppression system, modification of the RCWS, interface for an IED jammer, satellite communication system and other minor modifications.&quot; The latest Boxer variant is the A3. The British were the first customer of the A3 in its entirety.

In July 2017 ARTEC awarded the then Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles (RMMV) a €21 million contract to upgrade 38 Bundeswehr Boxer command vehicles to A2 configuration with work scheduled for completion in mid-2020. At this time the Bundeswehr also had 124 Boxer APCs, 72 ambulances and twelve driver training vehicles to upgrade to A2 status, with this work scheduled to conclude during 2024.

In February 2018 it was announced that Slovenia had selected the Boxer as the basis for two new mechanised infantry battle groups. In November it was revealed that pricing issues had impacted the Slovenian procurement timeline and that a new proposal from industry was pending. According to the Slovenian MoD&#x27;s initial release on the subject, funding had been allocated for the procurement of 48 vehicles in 2018-2020 for the first battle group, which was expected to become operational by 2022, followed by the second in 2025. The desired total was reported to be 112 Boxer (96 IFV, 16 mortar) plus a small number of driver training vehicles. It was reported mid-2019 that the planned Boxer procurement had been suspended, the MoD deciding to conduct research and draw up a new comprehensive tactical study relating to the formation of a medium infantry battalion group, this likely to affect the procurement of 8×8 wheeled armoured vehicles. The ministry will then re-examine options available and make a decision on how to build a medium infantry battalion group capability.

In July 2016 it had been announced that the Boxer was one of two vehicle types (from four) down-selected to take part in the 12-month Risk Mitigation Activity for Australia&#x27;s Land 400 Phase 2 project, and in March 2018 it was announced that Rheinmetall Defense Australia (RDA) had been selected as the preferred tenderer for that project which at the time called for 211 vehicles, with a roll-out of initial vehicles by 2021 and deliveries scheduled to be complete by 2026. In Australian Army service the Boxer is replacing an ageing fleet of 257 Australian Light Armoured Vehicles (ASLAV) that reached their life-of-type around 2021. Under Rheinmetall&#x27;s offering, the first batch of 20 to 25 vehicles were to be built in Germany with Australians embedded into teams to learn the necessary skills before transferring back to Australia for the build of the remaining vehicles. RDA&#x27;s Military Vehicle Centre of Excellence (MILVEHCOE) in Ipswich, Queensland, is the hub for the production of the majority of the vehicles, the local build programme including about 40 local suppliers. These industrial opportunities were stated to create up to 1,450 jobs across Australia, The acquisition and sustainment of the vehicles is costed at AUD15.7 billion (US$12.2 billion), acquisition worth AUD5.2 billion, the remaining AUD10.5 billion costed for sustainment over the vehicles&#x27; 30-year life. During Boxer&#x27;s selection process, protection received a higher priority than lethality. Lethality was followed by mobility, then by sustainability and C4ISR considerations.

In March 2018 it was announced by the UK government that it was re-joining the Boxer programme, and in April 2018 it was announced that Boxer had been selected by the British Army to meet its Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV) requirement. No details relating to quantity, cost, timeline or any contractual status were given. It was first reported in October 2016 that the British Ministry of Defence had taken its first formal step towards government-to-government acquisition of Boxers. At DSEI 2017, a Boxer in a Union Jack paint scheme was shown by Rheinmetall to promote the vehicle for the MIV requirement. In November 2017, a company of German Army mechanised infantry equipped with 11 Boxers exercised with British Army units in the Salisbury Plain Training Area. British Army sources denied that the exercise was linked to any decision on a procurement process for its MIV project. In February 2018 it was reported that ARTEC had signed agreements with UK suppliers, this contributing to the fact that 60% by value of the MIV contract will be done in Britain, along with final assembly of the MIVs at facilities already owned by the consortium.

In July 2018 there were three Boxer-related announcements made over a period of three days. On 17 July the Dutch MoD announced that the last Dutch Boxer had rolled off the production line, this being a cargo variant. On 18 July the Lithuanian MoD announced that the country&#x27;s first two Boxer prototypes had entered trials in Germany. On 19 July 2018 the UK MoD disclosed its intent to order between 400 and 600 Boxers in four variants plus driver training vehicles, reference vehicles and support, with the first vehicles then to be in-service by 2023. The contract would contain options to increase the quantity of vehicles by up to an additional 900.

In March 2019 the Australian Ambassador to Germany inspected the first Boxer being delivered to the Australian Government under the Land 400 Phase 2 programme prior to its shipping to Australia, and in July 2019 the first two of the 25 Boxer being built in Germany arrived in Australia. The 25 vehicles delivered from Germany were split 12 reconnaissance platforms and 13 multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs). The 13 MPVs are classified as military off-the-shelf (MOTS), while the 12 reconnaissance are classified as MOTS Plus. Once in Australia, these vehicles received a number of Australia specific modifications prior to final delivery to the Army. The first vehicles were in use for training purposes by October 2020, with an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) declared in October 2022. Rheinmetall&#x27;s contract calls for the delivery of 211 Boxers to the Australian Army, and in service Boxers will fill seven different roles on the battlefield: reconnaissance, command and control, joint fires, surveillance, multi-purpose, battlefield repair and recovery. The reconnaissance variant will account for 133 of the 211 vehicles and is equipped with Rheinmetall&#x27;s Lance Medium Calibre Turret, previously known as the Lance Modular Turret System (MTS), which has a 30 mm automatic cannon.

Also in July 2019 the first two Boxer (Vilkas) IFVs ordered by Lithuania were officially handed over to the MoD. The MoD stated that 15 Vilkas would be delivered in 2019 and all 89 vehicles would be delivered by the end of 2023.

In September 2019 there were three Boxer-related announcements. On 10 September it was revealed that the target date for the UK&#x27;s MIV programme to receive its main gate approval was 22 October 2019. It was reported that the business case for the purchase of an initial batch of 508 vehicles, valued at about GBP1.2 billion (US$1.48 billion), was currently under scrutiny by financial, commercial, and technical experts before receiving final approval by ministers. UK MoD officials submitted their final business case for the purchase of the Boxer MIVs on 9 September 2019 to meet the British Army&#x27;s target of getting its first Boxer in service by 2023. At the 2019 Defence and Security Equipment International exhibition (DSEI 2019) in London, Germany&#x27;s Flensburger Fahrzeugbau Gesellschaft (FFG) presented an armoured recovery mission module (ARM) for the Boxer Christoph Jehn, FFG&#x27;s project manager, stated the ARM was developed as a private venture from 2017. The company noticed Boxer users struggling to recover stranded vehicles with the aid of other Boxers and so decided to develop the bespoke mission module for the purpose. The ARM has an approximate weight of 13 tonnes, is manned by two personnel and connects to the Boxer using standard mechanical interfaces. Other Boxer repair and recovery solutions are being developed. On 24 September 2019 it was announced that the first Boxer for the Australian Army had formally been handed over. The turretless vehicle was the first of 25 Boxers – 13 multipurpose and 12 reconnaissance variants – that were being manufactured in Germany through to 2021 to meet an early Australian capability requirement for familiarisation and training purposes. Production of the other 186 platforms began in late 2020/early 2021 at a Military Vehicle Centre of Excellence (MILVEHCOE) constructed by Rheinmetall at Ipswich, southwest of Brisbane, that formally opened in October 2020. This is the company&#x27;s largest facility outside Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane&#x27;s Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 GTK/MRAV/PWV (Boxer) Wheeled Armoured Vehicle Programme&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also in September 2019 reports emerged that Algeria had selected the Boxer and that production would commence shortly. As of Q3 2024 this had not been confirmed by ARTEC.

In November 2019 the UK Ministry of Defence awarded ARTEC a GBP2.3 billion (US$2.97 billion) contract to deliver 523 Boxer in three main configurations, these encompassing nine sub-configurations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane&#x27;s Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2021 GTK/MRAV/PWV (Boxer) Wheeled Armoured Vehicle Programme&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2020s ===
In January 2020 in an interview with Shaun Connors of Janes, Stefan Lischka, MD of ARTEC, stated that only 8% of UK Boxers (the original 523) would be manufactured in Germany with the remainder being assembled at and delivered from two sites in the UK, Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL) at Telford and KMW subsidiary WFEL at Stockport. Production began in early 2023.

In November 2020 it was announced that ARTEC consortium partners Rheinmetall Landsysteme and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) had awarded two separate subcontracts to Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL) and WFEL respectively for the local production of Boxers for the UK. RBSL and WFEL were selected by Rheinmetall and KMW respectively to be the UK Tier 1 suppliers and operate one Boxer production line each. The value of KMW&#x27;s initial contract has not been announced, but is known to involve at least 480 drive modules being produced by WFEL in the UK, with under half of them being assembled by WFEL into full vehicles covering the Infantry Carriers, Specialist Carriers and Ambulance variants. The remaining drive modules being produced by WFEL will be shipped to RBSL to construct the other full vehicles in a number of variants, including the Specialist Carrier. Rheinmetall&#x27;s initial contract with RBSL is worth US$1.15 billion (GPB860 million) and involves the manufacture of 262 Boxer vehicles at RBSL&#x27;s assembly line in Telford, UK. All of these vehicles will either be the Specialist Carrier or Command vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane&#x27;s Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2020-2021 GTK/MRAV/PWV (Boxer) Wheeled Armoured Vehicle Programme Jan 2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (, BAAINBw) awarded Rheinmetall a contract at the end of January 2021 to upgrade 27 more Boxer command vehicles to the A2 standard, this award bringing all the Bundeswehr&#x27;s Boxer command vehicles up A2 standard.

In December 2019 Germany&#x27;s BAAINBw ordered 10 Boxer in C-UAS (Counter UAS) configuration, these later designated Extended All Arms Air Defence (EAAAD). By June 2020 all elements of the system had reportedly passed the critical design review and live firing had been conducted. The first systems were to be delivered to the Bundeswehr by the close of 2020. Boxers with the C-UASs were stated to be used to protect the NATO Response Force Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) which Germany took leadership of in 2023. In 2023 it was stated that deliveries of these C-UAS configured Boxer would occur 2023–2024.

In June 2020 the Bundeswehr repeated an earlier statement that it would replace the Wiesel weapon carrier with a mission module bringing the combination of a 30 mm cannon and Spike-LR anti-tank guided missile to the wheeled platform. This requirement would develop to become the Schwerer Waffenträger Infanterie (sWaTrg Inf) HWC infantry vehicle.

In September 2021 OCCAR announced a new reconnaissance vehicle mission module for the Bundeswehr known as the Joint Fire Support Team (Heavy) differentiating it from the smaller Fennek scout car. The new variant will be centred around a sensor mast known as the Panoramic Above Armour Gimbal (PAAG) and built by Thales Group, with imaging sensors for visible to thermal infrared spectra and rangefinding and targeting lasers. Two prototypes were ordered in 2021, with delivery expected during 2024–2026, with full production of 20 vehicles that will operate in pairs to follow in between 2028 and 2031.

On 8 April 2022 it was disclosed that British Army would receive an additional 100 Boxers, bringing the order total to 623. No variant breakdown or other details was provided at the time. In 2023 it was disclosed that inclusive of the additional 100 Boxer ordered in 2022, RBSL is now contracted to manufacture 272 Boxers in the Specialist Carrier Vehicle (SCV) and Command Post configurations, this total including 10 Boxer from the 100-Boxer award. RBSL will manufacture 234 Boxer, with 117 vehicles to be built in Germany. The German contingent includes the bulk of the 100 vehicles ordered in the second contract, which are being manufactured to ensure that the programme is able to meet the British Army&#x27;s plans to achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in 2025, and Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2032. Details of UK Boxer breakdown and designations can be found in Operators.

In June 2022, a tracked Boxer concept was shown by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) at the Eurosatory defence exhibition. The vehicle remains a concept and is covered in Other variants including prototypes, concepts and developmental platforms.

In April 2023 the Lithuanian Ministry of National Defence (MND) revealed it planned to purchase more than 120 additional Boxers, and that a contract could be signed as soon as Q4 2023. In July 2024 it was announced that Lithuania would in fact procure tracked IFVs to complement a planned new tank battalion, but some additional Boxers will still be acquired to serve as engineering vehicles, command posts, and reserve.

During the Future Armoured Vehicles Survivability (FAVS) conference held in November 2023, a representative from the German Army explained that the service intended to field four medium brigades. These brigades were planned to be equipped with new Boxer variants, including a Boxer variant referred to as Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicle (AIFV). Like the Boxer Heavy Weapons Carrier, this AIFV variant was expected to be based on or around the Australian Boxer Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV). Rheinmetall and KNDS Deutschland are understood to have proposed different turret options, with the former understood to have offered its two-person Lance turret as fitted to the Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV) and Schwerer Waffenträger Infanterie (sWaTrg Inf) HWC infantry vehicle, with KNDS Deutschland proposing its Remote Controlled Turret 30 mm (RCT30).

By late 2023, ARTEC had five disclosed Boxer assembly lines in operation which have the capacity to produce 200 vehicles per year beginning in 2024. These facilities are located in Brisbane, Ede, Kassel, Munich and Telford.

Lithuania confirmed in January 2024 that at the end of 2023 it had completed the procurement of the original 91 Boxer. Also in January 2024 it was reported that the UK had plans to order some additional Boxer variants, although quantities were not revealed. With an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) of the end of the decade, the first priority is to order Armoured Vehicle Launched Bridge, Repair and Recovery, and Armoured Mortar Vehicle configurations in 2024. Serpens Deep Find radar, Mounted Close Combat Overwatch (MCCO) anti-tank vehicles, and a C-UAS capability could then follow.

In February 2024 the Bundeswehr ordered its first specialised versions of the Boxer with a batch of Skyranger 30 air-defence systems from Rheinmetall. Under a €595 million contract, Rheinmetall was to deliver a prototype at the end of 2024, followed by 18 production vehicles, with an option for 30 more. The Skyranger 30 will be a key component of the Bundeswehr&#x27;s Nah- und Nächstbereichsschutz (short- and very-short-range air defence: NNbS), for which a Rheinmetall Electronics, Diehl Defence, and Hensoldt Sensors Arbeitsgemeinschaft (ARGE) working group was awarded a contract in January 2023. The turret will be equipped with a 30 × 173 mm KCE revolver gun firing programmable ABM, two Stinger surface-to-air missiles, and a sensor suite. The latter will comprise a Hensoldt Spexer X-band radar with three panels each providing 120° azimuth coverage integrated into the turret and an electro-optical tracking sensor with a thermal camera, day camera, and laser rangefinder for target identification and tracking. The turret will also be equipped with Rheinmetall&#x27;s Rapid Obscuring System (ROSY) smoke grenade launchers. As of Q3 2024, series production was scheduled to commence in April 2026, and was expected to be completed in March 2028.

On 10 April 2024 Rheinmetall Defence Australia and the Australian government signed a production agreement for 103 Schwerer Waffenträger Infanterie (sWaTrg Inf) HWC infantry vehicles. The deal is valued at €1.95 billion, and includes a €746.9 million service and maintenance contract. Germany&#x27;s parliament approved the deal on 20 March, and the order was placed by the Bundeswehr on 21 March. The sWaTrg Inf is based on the Australian Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV), this fitted with Rheinmetall&#x27;s Lance turret. For the sWaTrg Inf the turret will additionally be armed with the Mehrrollenfähiges leichtes Lenkflugkörper-System (Multirole-capable Light Missile System: MELLS), this the Bundeswehr&#x27;s designation for the Spike LR.

The Bundeswehr will acquire up to 123 Schwerer Waffenträger Infanterie (sWaTrg Inf) HWC infantry vehicles in total between 2025 and 2028. The first 20 units are scheduled for delivery during 2025, and these will be manufactured in Germany at Rheinmetall&#x27;s Unterluess and Kassel plants. The following 103 units will be exported from Australia, having been manufactured at Rheinmetall&#x27;s Military Vehicle Centre of Excellence (MILVEHCOE) in Queensland between 2026 and 2030.
The sWaTrg Inf will replace the Wiesel 1 tracked tactical direct fire-support weapon carrier in Bundeswehr service, and will equip the Army&#x27;s new medium forces. As of Q2 2024, the sWaTrg Inf vehicle is expected to begin fielding in 2027.

On 24 April 2024, the UK announced its selection of the Boxer-based Remote-Controlled Howitzer 155mm (RCH 155) for the British Army&#x27;s Mobile Fires Platform programme, as a successor for the AS90. The vehicles will be built in both Germany and the UK with over 100 UK-based suppliers manufacturing components. The platform will be in service with the Royal Artillery by the end of the decade.

While not confirmed, it was reported in May 2024 that the Bundeswehr had selected the RCT30 turret option for the 148 Boxer it had identified it required for its new medium forces. The choice is understood to have been role-driven, the RCT30 turret permitting the transport of a fully equipped grenadier squads, while the Lance turret-equipped sWaTrgInf Heavy Weapons Carrier does not, this vehicle optimised for direct tactical fire in support of infantry forces, not as a transport for them. The project was scheduled for German parliamentary approval during Q4 2024, with sources suggesting at the time that the Netherlands could also order a batch of RCT30-fitted Boxer. The Lance and RCT30 turrets are both fitted with Rheinmetall&#x27;s 30 mm cannon. The RCT30 turret is essentially that fitted to the PSM Puma IFV.

In September 2024 it was confirmed that the Dutch would acquire the RCT30 Boxer. The Dutch 13th Light Brigade announced on September 17 that its two infantry battalions would be reinforced with Boxer RCT30 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs). No contract, acquisition timeline details or similar were given. Also in September 2024, Rheinmetall in partnership with Patria presented a Boxer with a NEMO 120 mm mortar turret. The concept demonstrator was built in response to the Armoured Mortar requirement from the British Army and was shown using an existing British Army drive module.

In October 2024 it was announced by OCCAR that the Lithuanian Army would receive 27 additional Boxer. Few details beyond a statement that the agreement included a new engineering variant of Boxer directly integrating engineering equipment (such as that used for mine clearance) into the existing Lithuanian Infantry Fighting Vehicle configuration were released at the time.

In January 2025 at International Armoured Vehicles 2025 (IAV2025) the first British-manufactured Boxer was unveiled. The vehicle was manufactured by RBSL, the joint venture between Rheinmetall and BAE Systems, and under licence from the ARTEC consortium of KNDS and Rheinmetall. At the time of the unveiling RBSL had manufactured four Boxers, with another four then undergoing factory acceptance tests. An additional 48 platforms are scheduled to be manufactured over the course of 2025 in command post, special carrier, ambulance and infantry carrier variants. At IAV 2025 it was also revealed that an order for 222 Boxer RCT30 had been delayed to Q2 or Q3 2025 by the German national elections, these scheduled for 23 February. Of the 222, 150 are for Germany&#x27;s new medium forces, and 72 are for the Netherlands. Also in January 2025, the first of 54 RCH 155 wheeled howitzers was handed over to the Ukraine by KNDS. January also saw the confirmation of the delivery of nine Boxer RCT30 IFVs to Ukraine, these designated AiTO30 FDC and equipped with systems specifically designed for counter-drone operations to protect artillery units from aerial threats.

In February 2025 Rheinmetall announced the delivery in late-January of the first Boxer Skyranger 30 air defence vehicle (the verification model) to the Bundeswehr. Trials commencing in spring 2025 are scheduled to be followed by serial deliveries during 2027-2028.

== Design ==
The Boxer is an eight-wheeled multirole vehicle that at the time of its development easily exceeded most comparable vehicles in weight and dimensions. In recent years the size/weight differences between Boxer and its contemporaries has reduced considerably, with Boxer quoted to have a combat weight of 36.5 tonnes in 2016 in A1 and A2 configurations, while vehicles such as ST Kinetics&#x27; Terrex 3 had a quoted combat weight of 35 tonnes, and Nexter&#x27;s VBCI, Patria&#x27;s AMV and General Dynamics&#x27; Piranha V all weighing in around the 32 to 33 tonne mark. Current combat weight of the Boxer in A3 configuration is quoted as up to 38.5 tonnes. However, ARTEC conducted trials in December 2021 with a Boxer weighing 41 tonnes. The vehicle, which was ballasted and without a mission module, traversed gaps up to 2.2 m, climbed a 60° slope, and surmounted a 1 m vertical step during trials. ARTEC managing director Stefan Lischka stated that there was no actual customer requirement for such a heavy Boxer at this time. The heaviest current version is the remote-controlled howitzer (RCH) version at 39 tonnes.

The Boxer consists of two key elements: the platform/drive-line (the drive module) and the removable mission module.

===Drive module===

The drive module is also known as the platform or the drive-line module. It consists of the hull mounting the drive axles, and is enclosed over the frontal arc where the powerpack and driver is located. The A (Alteration) iterations applied to the Boxer are specific to the drive module. Initial production examples were A0 and fewer than 60 were delivered. Initial production was A1, followed in 2015 by A2. Current production standard depending on user is either A2 or A3. Australia is receiving an A2/A3 hybrid, in that it will receive the latest A3 drive module (rated at 38,500 kg) but with the A2 standard engine rating of 

The drive module locates the driver front right (right-hand drive), with the powerpack to the left. The powerpack can be replaced under field conditions in about 30 minutes and can, if required, be run outside of the vehicle for test purposes.

==== Specifications ====
===Mission module===

The mission module contains the mission-specific elements, such as weapons, equipment or crew. It is a key (and unique) feature of the Boxer. Mission modules are interchangeable pod-like units that are fitted to drive modules to form a complete mission variant vehicle. Mission modules are attached by four points and can be swapped within an hour under field conditions. The driver can access their compartment through the mission module or in an emergency via the large single-piece power-operated hatch above this position.

Internal protected volume of the baseline mission module is 14m³, this increasing to 17.5 m3 for higher roof configurations such as an ambulance configuration. While variable depending on protection levels and equipment fit/configuration, payload is stated to be 13.5 tonnes.
=== Armament ===

In service Boxers are fitted with a variety of armament ranging from a 7.62 mm light machine gun in a remote weapon station to a 30 mm cannon in a turret. Numerous other armament options are offered and these include missiles, mortars, a 105 mm main gun, and a 155 mm howitzer.

Most in-service Boxers are equipped with a remote weapon station for self-defense. Dutch vehicles are fitted with the Protector M151 RWS from Kongsberg fitted with a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun. German vehicles are usually fitted with the FLW-200 from KMW, which can be fitted with either a 7.62 mm MG3 machine gun, a 12.7 mm M3M HMG or a 40 mm GMW automatic grenade launcher. The FLW-200 has dual-axis stabilization and incorporates a laser rangefinder and a thermal imager. The Bundeswehr&#x27;s Joint Fire Support Team, schwer (heavy), programme Boxers will be fitted with Kongsberg&#x27;s Protector RS4 RWS, as will the C-UAS Boxer&#x27;s if delivery occurs. British vehicles will also be fitted with Kongsberg&#x27;s Protector RS4 RWS, the £180 million contract award announced in February 2021.

Lithuanian Boxers are fitted with the Israeli-made RAFAEL Advanced Defense Systems Samson Mk II RCT turret, mounting a fully stabilised Orbital ATK Mk 44 30 mm dual-feed cannon, 7.62 mm co-axial MG, and Spike-LR missiles. The turret is fitted with an independent commander&#x27;s sight with both commander and gunner provided with thermal and daylight channels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane&#x27;s Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2020-2021 GTK/MRAV/PWV (Boxer) Wheeled Armoured Vehicle Programme July 2024&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Boxers are fitted with either Rheinmetall Defense&#x27;s Lance Medium Calibre Turret or a EOS Defence Systems R400S-Mk2 D-HD RWS. 133 Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV) Reconnaissance variants will be fitted with the Lance 30 mm two-man turret, this armed with the Rheinmetall Mauser (air-bursting munition) dual-feed stabilised cannon and 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun. Turret traverse is all electric through a full 360° with weapon elevation from -15° to +45°. A Rheinmetall computerised fire-control system is installed, which allows stationary and moving targets to be engaged. The gunner has a Rheinmetall Stabilised Electro-Optical Sighting System (SEOSS), which typically has day/thermal channels and an eye-safe laser rangefinder. The commander has a Rheinmetall SEOSS panoramic sighting system, which allows hunter/killer target engagements to take place. The 121 Block II CRV Reconnaissance manufactured in Australia will be equipped with 2 turret-mounted Spike LR2 missiles and the Iron Fist APS (Active Protection System) from Elbit. It is intended that the original 12 Block I vehicles will be upgraded to Block II standard. Weapons&#x27; fit for the 82 R400S-Mk2 D-HD RWS ordered has yet to disclosed.

Germany will also receive Boxer fitted with the Skyranger 30 air defence system turret mission module. The Skyranger 30 turret is fitted with a modified version of the Oerlikon KCA 30 mm cannon. Rate of fire of is 1,200 rounds per minute and the gun has the ability to elevate 85° to combat terminal diving targets. 252 ready rounds are carried. The gun fires a 30 mm airburst munition based on the 35 mm AHEAD ammunition carrying 160 tungsten cylinders, each weighing 1.25 grams for a total payload of 200 grams, which is time-programmed upon leaving the muzzle to open up in front of a target to form a lethal cone. The system is capable of integrating a selection of very short range missiles, and for Germany these will be the FIM-92 Stinger.

=== Protection ===
The Boxer is constructed from rolled all-welded steel armour to which the AMAP-B module-based appliqué armour kit can be fitted as required by mission threat estimates. AMAP-B modules are taken from the IBD Diesenroth (now Rheinmetall Protection Systems GmbH) AMAP modular armour package and are fitted to the vehicle with shock absorbing mountings.
Exact details of Boxer protection levels have now been classified. According to ARTEC, the vehicle will withstand anti-personnel and large anti-tank mines of an undisclosed type under the wheel, platform or side attack. It has previously been stated that Boxer&#x27;s baseline armour is all-round resistant to 14.5 mm armour-piercing ammunition in accordance with STANAG 4569 Level 4.

To increase survivability in case of armour penetration, the crew compartment is completely covered by an AMAP-L spall liner. The spall liner stops most of the fragments of the armour and projectile brought about by hull penetration. To further enhance crew protection, the seats are decoupled from the floor, this preventing the shock of a mine-detonation being directly transmitted to the crew. The roof armour of the Boxer is designed to withstand artillery fragments and top attack weapons such as bomblets fitted with a High-Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) warhead.

The Boxer drive module A1 (as designated by the German BWB) is an upgraded version of the baseline A0 version of the Boxer drive module, with the primary difference being the installation of a mine protection package fitted to the belly and wheel stations of the vehicle. The vehicle is fitted an additional armour package focused on protecting against side and underbody blast threats. This consists of the AMAP-M and AMAP-IED packages. An unspecified electronic countermeasure (ECM) system was also fitted to counter IEDs. These changes result in a 1,058 kg weight increase for the A1 over the baseline A0 APC variant. For the A2 and A3 Boxer protection is reported to have been increased further.

=== Mobility and transport===

The powerpack of the Boxer consists of a MTU 8V199 TE20 water-cooled diesel engine developing (originally) 720 hp and coupled to an Allison HD4070 fully automatic transmission with seven forward and three reverse gears. The powerpack can be replaced under field conditions in approximately 30 minutes. The MTU 8V199 TE20 engine is a militarised development of the Mercedes-Benz OM 500 truck engine, modified by MTU to produce increased power via changes to the turbocharger, fuel injection and cooling systems. To maintain mobility levels at increased weights, the 8V199 TE20 is now available developing either or , and when the drive module is fitted with the 600 kW version of this engine it is designated A3. The Boxer is fitted with three fuel tanks containing a total of 562 litres, divided between a 280-litre front tank, 238-litre rear tank, and a 44-litre reserve tank.

Boxer has full-time 8×8 drive with differential locks on all axles and the front four wheels steer. Tyres are 415/80R 27 Michelin XML on German and Dutch Boxers. The Land 400 prototypes were fitted with 415/80R 685 Michelin XForce 2 tyres, these having a 500 kg per wheel greater load rating than the XML and being more &#x27;all-terrain&#x27; in design than the rocks/mud-optimised XML.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane&#x27;s Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2017-2018 GTK/MRAV/PWV (Boxer) Wheeled Armoured Vehicle Programme January 2018&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Standard tyre fit for Australian and UK Boxers will be 415/80R 685 Michelin XForce ZL rated to carry 5,600 kg each. 
A central tire inflation system (CTIS) is fitted, and run-flat inserts allow for 30 km travel at up to 50 km/h in the event of a puncture. Braking is provided by Knott pneumatic ABS on all wheels with main braking power actuated on the front two axles. Suspension is fully independent double wishbone with coil springs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane&#x27;s Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2016-2017 GTK/MRAV/PWV (Boxer) Wheeled Armoured Vehicle Programme May 2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boxer can be transported in the Airbus A400M tactical airlifter, albeit not in one piece. With a capacity of around 32-tonnes, the loading ramp of an A400M cannot accommodate a complete Boxer so the drive and mission modules need to be separated for transport. Two Boxers can be transported by three A400Ms, two for the drive modules and a third for the mission modules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane&#x27;s Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2020-2021 GTK/MRAV/PWV (Boxer) Wheeled Armoured Vehicle Programme May 2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boxer variants and mission modules overview==
As of April 2022 ARTEC had outlined 23 mission module configurations for the Boxer, and suggested that two more would soon be introduced. Of the 23, 10 were stated to be delivered or being delivered, five contracted, and the remaining eight at prototype/concept stage. By 2023 ARTEC had outlined 31 mission module configurations for Boxer. Any modules developed independently of ARTEC are not included in the 31 figure, these including RBSL and other developments.

ARTEC can in some instances define the same mission module function as separate mission module types/configurations, one example of several such instances being Ambulance modules which are currently designated Ambulance A, Ambulance B, and Ambulance C. These account for three of the 31 outlined module configurations, but as ARTEC generally does not identify which mission module configuration from official literature have been supplied to any specific user for any specific role, which of the three designated Ambulance mission module configurations is used by the three individual known users is unclear. Users will also designate their specific modules as per individual naming protocols, and not retain ARTEC designations. An example here, the UK order includes a batch of C2-Utility (C2U) Vehicle configuration, but no source confirms the ARTEC mission module designation/configuration for these.

Module nomenclature has also changed over time, and there is a limited degree of inconsistency in the reporting of which user has which exact module.

At the Defence iQ International Armoured Vehicles 2020 conference, Stefan Lishka, MD of ARTEC commented that the term &quot;configuration&quot; had superseded variant for Boxers, and Boxer mission modules. The reason for this was that some current/planned variants (build configurations) are/would be interchangeable by crew members.

The following bullet point list of mission modules is based on current ARTEC literature, with the more detailed following sub-sections (in no specific order) detailing mission module and overall Boxer configuration user information by the varying designation methods available. Where any information is unclear, this fact is noted. The running order of the list is as per ARTEC literature, hence the occasional apparent listing anomaly.

=== Armoured Personnel Carrier ===
The armoured personnel carrier (APC) variant can be considered a baseline configuration for Boxer. The German Army received 125 APC modules as part of the initial 272-vehicle order. All 131 vehicles from the second German Army order are in a new configuration of the armoured personnel carrier (Gepanzertes Transportfahrzeug).

=== Command Post ===
The command post variants of the Boxer are used for command and control in theatre, acting as a centre for tactical communications. Secured communication, displays for situational awareness and instruments for network-enabled warfare are key characteristics of this variant. There are currently four designated Command Post configurations, A, B, C and D. In standard configuration the command post module offers room for four workstations and the vehicle crew consists of driver, commander/weapon operator, two staff officers, one staff assistant and one additional crew member.

The German Army received 65 command post modules as part of the initial 272-vehicle order; the Dutch Army ordered 60 command post modules originally, but later reduced this to 36 modules. Australia and the UK will also receive command post variants of the Boxer. Lithuania&#x27;s command post variants will be based around the IFV.

The UK requirement calls for a total of 212 mission modules in five configurations for command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) applications.

As part of Land 400 Phase 2 deliveries, Australia will receive 15 CRV-C2 (Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle - C2) as part of Block II deliveries. These have a crew of seven. Will be fitted with a R400S-MK2-D-HD RWS remote weapon station mounting an unspecified weapon. Four of the additional 12 mission modules ordered will be in CVR-C2 configuration.

=== Ambulance ===
The German Army received 72 ambulance modules as part of the initial 272-vehicle order; the Dutch Army ordered 52 ambulance modules. The German and Dutch Boxer ambulance variant utilise a mission module with a raised roofline providing an internal height of 1.85 m and volume of 17.5 m. In Dutch service the Boxer ambulance replaced the YPR-765 prgwt variant of the AIFV (&quot;Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle&quot;) casualty transport and it can accommodate seven casualties that are seated or three lying down on stretchers, or one of the following combinations: three seated and two lying down, or four seated and a single casualty lying down. The crew consists of driver, commander and a single medic. The Dutch vehicle, a medical evacuation vehicle, differs from the German medical treatment vehicle. The UK has ordered ambulance modules, and Australia has an option for 11 of these.

=== Geniegroep/CRV-MPV (Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle - Multi-Purpose Vehicle) ===
The Boxer Geniegroep (GNPR) was originally a Dutch-specific engineering and logistics support vehicle that is deployed for the transport of troops and engineer group equipment. It provides seating for six dismounts with space available for their personal equipment and an additional separate stowage section for munitions. It may be deployed as a support vehicle with other units or used for independent assignments such as route clearance, or as a protected work location during mine clearance or demolition operations. The Boxer GNGP replaces the YPR-765 prgm/PRCO-C3 variant of the AIFV (&quot;Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicle&quot;). The Royal Netherlands Army initially ordered 53 GNPR, this later revised to 92, and has subsequently converted 12 of the 92 GNGP vehicles ordered to &quot;Boxer Battle Damage Repair&quot; (BDR) configuration. The BDR variant is able to accommodate the special equipment, tools, expendable and non-expendable supplies needed to carry out diagnoses, maintenance and minor repairs if required. Crew consists of an engineer commander, driver, observing commander, gunner, and five engineers.

As part of Land 400 Phase 2 deliveries, Australia received 13 CRV-MPV (Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle - Multi-Purpose Vehicle) as part of Block 1 deliveries. These are based on the GNGP Engineer Vehicle of the Netherlands Army, and were manufactured in Germany. Will be fitted with a R400S-MK2-D-HD RWS remote weapon station mounting an unspecified weapon

=== Cargo ===
The Boxer Cargo is a Dutch-specific variant that replaced the YPR-765 prv variant of the AIFV (&quot;Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle&quot;). It is equipped with a special loading floor to secure cargo during transport and can transport a maximum of two standard one tonne army pallets (max. load 2,5 t). The interior design of the vehicle allows adaptation as necessary for different kinds of missions. For conducting peace-keeping missions or other peacetime operations the set of vehicle equipment can be changed and tailored to suit as required. Crew consists of commander/gunner and driver. 27 cargo examples were originally ordered, this later revised to 12. A cargo variant was the final Dutch Boxer produced.

=== Driver Training Vehicle ===
This driver training vehicle (DTV) variant is equipped with a training module. The driver sits in the conventional driver&#x27;s station and the instructor is seated in an elevated position in the driver training cabin. Active occupant protection is designed to protect the crew sitting exposed in the driver training cabin. In the event of a roll-over accident, the instructor and upper occupant seats are electronically retracted into the Driver Training Module. In normal use, the instructor can monitor the trainee driver via a duplicated control and display unit and override gear selector, brake and accelerator pedal of the driver&#x27;s station. Steering override is available as an option. Crew consists of a trainee driver, instructor, plus up to two additional trainee passengers. The Australian, Dutch (8), German (10) and Lithuanian (2) armies all ordered driver training vehicles.

=== Repair and Recovery ===
ARTEC outlines a Recovery and repair mission module, and separate Repair and Recovery mission modules.

As part of Land 400 Phase 2 deliveries, Australia will receive 11 CRV-REP (Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle - Repair) and 
10 CRV-REC (Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle - Recovery). The repair variant will be fitted with a crane, the recovery variant a winch. The recovery variant will be fitted with a R400S-MK2-D-HD RWS remote weapon station mounting an unspecified weapon. Both variants have a crew of three. Of the additional 12 mission modules ordered, one will be in repair configuration, and two in recovery. Australia&#x27;s choice of separate repair and recovery modules is believed to be due to the difficulties of achieving the required lift (crane) and pull (winch) capabilities required within module size and weight constraints of a single module.

The UK will receive 60 modules in Engineer Section Vehicle (ESV) configuration, and 50 in ES Repair (Rep) configuration. Germany is evaluating recovery options for Boxer.

=== Skyranger 30 ===
Boxer was first shown fitted with the Skyranger 30 air defence system turret mission module in March 2021. The Skyranger 30 turret has an autocannon firing time fuzed 30 x 173 mm ammunition and two short range missiles like Stinger or Mistral. It has five AESA radar arrays for 360 degrees coverage and a day and night electro-optical sight for target engagement. Skyranger 30 was ordered by the Bundeswehr in 2024 and will be a key component of the Bundeswehr&#x27;s Nah- und Nächstbereichsschutz (short- and very-short-range air defence: NNbS).

=== IFV RCT30 (PuBo) ===
KNDS offers a Boxer fitted with a RCT30 unmanned turret mission module. This configuration is also referred to as PuBo (Puma Boxer) as the turret is essentially that fitted to the German Army&#x27;s Puma infantry vehicle. It is reported that a RCT30 turret was the initial choice for Lithuania&#x27;s Boxer IFV, with the decision later reversed on cost grounds. At DIMDEX 2024 a RCT30-equipped Boxer was shown, the vehicle also fitted with a passive radio frequency sensor that is intended to shoot down small unmanned aerial vehicles. Qatari armed forces are reportedly in the process of receiving 10 Boxers with the RCT30. This turret may also be fitted to 148 vehicles required by the Bundeswehr, and for which a decision on procurement is expected later this year (2024), and will reportedly be fitted to the additional Boxers that are required by the Dutch Army&#x27;s 13th Light Brigade.

=== Remote-Controlled Howitzer 155 mm (RCH 155) ===
The Boxer Remote-Controlled Howitzer 155 mm (RCH 155) mounts a version of the KMW Artillery Gun Module (AGM). This is a further development of the tracked Panzerhaubitze 2000 155 mm 52-calibre artillery system. The system was originally developed to meet potential requirements of export customers for a wheeled base platform as this has greater strategic mobility than the tracked and heavier PzH 2000-type system. In December 2020 the then Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) announced in a press release that it planned to begin developmental testing of the Remote Controlled Howitzer (RCH) 155 mm gun in 2021, this a remotely controllable version of the original RCH 155. In September 2022, 18 RCH 155 were announced as a purchase from Ukraine through a German aid fund at a cost of €216 million. A further 18 RCH 155 were ordered on 18 February 2024, and in June 2024 it was stated that the total RCH 155 for Ukraine was 54, with initial deliveries no earlier than the end of 2024. In April 2024 the UK MoD became the second confirmed user of the type when it announced the selection of the RCH 155 for the British Army&#x27;s Mobile Fires Platform programme, this a successor for the AS90.

=== Joint Fire Support ===
There are two Joint fire support mission module configurations offered by ARTEC, and they are simply designated Joint fire support A and Joint fire support B.

The Bundeswehr&#x27;s Joint Fire Support Team (JFST) contract was awarded in September 2021 and renderings shown by the company show Boxer (designated Joint Fire Support Team schwer (JFSTsw)) fitted with a mission module based around current in-service JFST/German Army equipment, and another fitted with equipment outlined in a JFST contract award to Thales in 2022. In November 2022, Lieutenant Colonel Karlheinz Boehnke, Multi-Role Armoured Vehicle (MRAV) representative in the German Army Concepts and Capabilities Development Centre, said he expected the two JFSTsw prototypes ordered in September 2021 to be delivered in 2024–2026, followed by 20 vehicles, which will operate in pairs, in 2028–2031.

As part of Land 400 Phase 2 deliveries, Australia will receive 29 CRV-JFS (Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle - Joint Fire Support) as part of Block II deliveries. These have a crew of six. Will be fitted with a R400S-MK2-D-HD RWS remote weapon station mounting an unspecified weapon. Five of the additional 12 mission modules ordered will be in CVR-JFS configuration.

=== Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV) Reconnaissance variant ===
The Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV) is a development of the baseline Boxer designed to fulfil the Australian Land 400 Phase 2 requirement. The chassis selected is rated at a GVW of 38.5-tonnes and is a hybrid of Boxer A2 and A3 configurations.
The Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV) Reconnaissance variant, or simply &quot;reconnaissance&quot; is the main CRV variant, 133 of the 211 vehicles ordered in this configuration. The Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV) Reconnaissance variant is fitted with the Rheinmetall Defense Lance Medium Calibre Turret.

The first twelve Boxer CRV Reconnaissance were delivered as Block 1 vehicles from Germany, the turret on these only equipped with the MK 30-2/ABM cannon, but it will eventually be upgraded to the Block II configuration. The other, 121 CRV Reconnaissance are being manufactured in Australia, and will be equipped with 2 Spike LR2 missile in the redesigned turret and the Iron Fist APS (Active Protection System) from Elbit.

The 123 Schwerer Waffenträger Infanterie (sWaTrg Inf) HWC infantry vehicles ordered by the German Army in a deal valued at €1.95 billion are based on the Australian Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV) Reconnaissance variant.

=== Vilkas (&quot;Wolf&quot;)/IFV Samson ===
Vilkas/Wolf is a Lithuanian designation for Boxer fitted with a Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Samson Mk II RCT turret. ARTEC refer to this configuration as IFV Samson. 89 of 91 Lithuania&#x27;s Vilkas/Wolf order are fitted with the Samson Mk II RCT turret, this mounting a fully stabilised Orbital ATK Mk 44S 30 mm dual-feed cannon, 7.62 mm co-axial MG, and Spike-LR missiles. A range of turret options were bid including the unmanned turret from the PSM Puma IFV. Lithuania received four variants of the IFV, 55 IFV squad leader, 18 IFV platoon leader; 12 IFV company leader; 4 IFV command post. Variants vary by mission fit primarily in the areas of additional voice and data communication equipment as well as modified BMS.

===Mortar 120 mm NEMO===
At Defence Vehicles Dynamics (DVD) 2024, Rheinmetall in partnership with Patria displayed as a concept demonstrator a Boxer with a NEMO 120 mm mortar turret. The configuration was developed in response to the British Army&#x27;s Armoured Mortar requirement. The mission module was designed and built by Rheinmetall in the UK and was shown mounted on a British Army drive module. Compared to a standard mission module, for the NEMO configuration the roofline is higher, this to allow crew egress from beneath the turret basket. The turret is also located to the left of the hull, this enabling the driver to leave the vehicle to the rear.

==Other variants including prototypes, concepts and developmental platforms==
&quot;This section, which is listed in no particular order, includes a variety of Boxer developments that include company/OEM prototypes, plus official ARTEC configurations that are not known to have entered serial production, but for which outline data is available.&quot;

* Boxer JODAA - Boxer JODAA (Joint Operational Demonstrator for Advanced Applications) is a technology demonstrator used by the German Army and Rheinmetall Landsysteme to carry out R&amp;D studies around potential Boxer improvements. It is based on the Boxer armoured medical treatment vehicle variant and is regularly refitted for a range of purposes and roles. 
* Boxer Skyranger 35 - Boxer has been shown fitted with the Oerlikon Skyranger 35 air defence system turret. This is armed with Rheinmetall&#x27;s 35mm x 228 calibre Revolver Gun, this having the option of a dual ammunition feeding system that allows the choice of two types of shell. It would primarily fire the 35 mm Advanced Hit Efficiency And Destruction (AHEAD) ammunition, which although optimised for the air defence role is also effective against ground targets including lightly protected vehicles. The secondary nature would be Frangible Armour-Piercing Discarding Sabot (FAPDS) ammunition. The gun has a cyclic rate of fire of 1,000 rounds a minute, with a typical aerial target being engaged by a burst of 20 to 24 rounds. Skyranger 35 is heavier than the Skyranger 30 variant which has been ordered by Germany.
* Boxer IFV Demonstrator/RCT30 - In addition to the Boxer fitted with the Lance turret there is also a Boxer offered fitted with a KNDS Deutschland RCT30 turreted mission module. The Boxer RCT30 IFV is a technology demonstrator used by KNDS Deutschland. The RCT30 is the latest development of the turret fitted to the German Army&#x27;s PSM Puma IFV.
* Boxer Armoured Recovery Module (ARM) - The Boxer ARM is a repair and recovery mission module developed by FFG to provide Boxer users with a recovery and maintenance capability as well as an operational means to mount mission modules onto drive modules. The ARM was first shown in 2019. Lieutenant Colonel Karlheinz Boehnke, Multi-Role Armoured Vehicle (MRAV) Boxer representative in the German Army Concept and Capabilities Development Centre, stated in 2023 that he expected plans for a Boxer recovery vehicle to be approved by the end of 2024. Other repair and recovery options are being developed/explored in addition to the FFG ARM. 
* Boxer, direct fire support - In April 2020 John Cockerill Defense revealed that it was supplying a C3105 two-person turret armed with 105 mm rifled gun to KMW so that it could be incorporated onto Boxer. The company stated that the development was funded by internal R&amp;D budgets. ARTEC&#x27;s mission module range includes a Main gun 105 mm configuration.
* Boxer WFEL bridging module concept/Bridge system 14 m and Bridge system 22 m - The Boxer WFEL bridging module concept is a configuration designed by WFEL and KMW as a private venture, to meet the need to integrate the Leguan bridging system onto medium-sized vehicles. The module which can deploy either a heavy 14 m or a lighter 22 m bridge was shown in September 2021. The 14 m bridge can handle military load class (MLC) 80 or 100, and the 22 m bridge MLC 50. The 14 and 22 m bridge options are listed as separate mission modules according to ARTEC&#x27;s outlined examples.
* Boxer ARTHUR - At the 2020 Omega Future Indirect Fires/Mortar Systems conference in the UK Saab displayed a concept of its ARTHUR Mod D mounted onto the mission module of a Boxer. Saab said ARTHUR Mod D was its “answer to the requirements for a highly mobile, agile, and long range WLR, supporting high tempo brigade and divisional manoeuvre operations. The technology is drawing on [both] existing and evolutions of Saab in-house sensor technologies”, and can be seen “as a spiral development” of ARTHUR.
* Boxer Mobile LWS - The Boxer Mobile LWS (laser weapon system) demonstrator was a version of the Boxer armoured medical treatment vehicle that was fitted with a RWS coupled to a Rheinmetall RMG 12.7 mm HMG, integrated with an unmanned protected turret and fitted with a fully-automated MANTIS turret. No further development or production has taken place.
*Boxer Mortar Mission Module - RBSL has developed to prototype stage a Mortar Mission Module, this successfully test-fired in September 2022. ARTEC also offers two mortar mission modules, these designated Mortar 120 mm, and Mortar 120 mm NEMO. Rheinmetall in partnership with Patria presented a NEMO 120 mm mortar turret on a Boxer in September 2024.
* Boxer Overwatch - RBSL has stated the company intends to develop and market its own mission modules to existing Boxer customers, one of these being Boxer Overwatch. A demonstrator of a Boxer Overwatch was unveiled at the Defence Vehicle Dynamics (DVD) event held at the Millbrook Proving Ground on 21 and 22 September 2022. Boxer Overwatch is equipped with a mission module for launching Brimstone missiles and this variant was developed by RBSL in collaboration with MBDA to show how the companies may be able to meet British Army requirements for a Mounted Close Combat Overwatch (MCCO) system. This is intended to be capable of engaging armoured targets at greater stand-off ranges than the retired Swingfire anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) mounted on the FV102 Striker tracked armoured vehicle. It forms part of the wider Battle Group Organic Anti-Armour (BGOAA) initiative to refresh the British Army&#x27;s anti-armour capabilities. In its concept form, the Boxer Overwatch mission module carries a single eight-cell launcher for 53 kg Brimstone 3 missiles facing towards the left side of the vehicle. The launcher is lowered to a horizontal position for travelling and raised before a fire mission. RBSL suggested that if the system receives a production contract it could be brought into service concurrently with other British Army Boxer variants since it would not require an extensive development cycle. Lockheed Martin UK is also competing for the MCCO requirement with a concept for a Boxer module referred to as the &#x27;Future Armoured Vertical Launcher&#x27;. The design features a vertical launch system for 16 x 50 kg class missiles (likely JAGMs), a loading arm, and an integrated sensor mast. Connected via NATO&#x27;s link-16, the British Army&#x27;s MORPHEUS and Lockheed&#x27;s own SkyKeeper system, the launcher could easily integrate with other platforms such as the RAF&#x27;s F-35Bs for providing targeting data.
* Boxer Knifefish - In 2023 it was disclosed that Germany and the Netherlands plan a Boxer jamming variant. The Boxer Knifefish jamming variant would exist in two versions – ultra-high frequency (UHF)/very high frequency (VHF) and high frequency (HF). Delivery of at least one Boxer jamming prototype is planned by 2028.
* Boxer (tracked) - Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) presented a tracked version of the Boxer armoured vehicle at the Eurosatory defence exhibition being held in Paris from 13 to 17 June 2022. The version on display at Eurosatory was armed with a KMW RCT120 mission module featuring a remote-controlled turret armed with a 120 mm smoothbore gun with an automatic loader, two Spike LR launchers, Trophy hard-kill APS, a remote weapon station, with a 30mm coaxially mounted autocannon as an option. This configuration still retains the capability to transport dismounts; up to 6, unless an optional extended autoloader magazine is optioned. Compared to the wheeled Boxer, the maximum weight of the tracked Boxer increases to 45 tonnes.
* Boxer C-UAS - As of 2024 ARTEC does not list a Counter UAS mission module configuration as an option for Boxer. However, previously in December 2019 Germany&#x27;s BAAINBw ordered 10 Boxer C-UAS (Counter UAS) systems, placing contracts with Kongsberg and Hensoldt, with delivery to be completed within 24 months. The vehicle was stated to be equipped with combination of Kongsberg&#x27;s Protector RWS armed with 40 mm grenade launcher with airburst ammunition and Hensoldt&#x27;s Spexer 2000 3D radar. Delivery of the first systems to the Bundeswehr was scheduled by the close of 2020, with these used to protect the NATO Response Force Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) when Germany took leadership of the service in 2023. As of early 2024 there is no evidence this requirement came to fruition, despite a May 2023 statement by Lieutenant Colonel Karlheinz Boehnke, Multi-Role Armoured Vehicle (MRAV) Boxer representative in the German Army Concept and Capabilities Development Centre, that deliveries would occur 2023–2024. Some sources now suggest that the ordered Skyranger 30 variant will fulfill the C-UAV role.
*Mine clearance - Mine clearing versions of Boxer are planned, this confirmed by Lieutenant Colonel Karlheinz Boehnke, Multi-Role Armoured Vehicle (MRAV) Boxer representative in the German Army Concept and Capabilities Development Centre, at SAE Media Group&#x27;s Future Armoured Vehicles Survivability (FAVS) 2023 conference held in London during November 2023. Lithuania will receive a Boxer engineering variant that it is reported will &quot;directly integrate engineering equipment, such as that used for mine clearance, into the existing Lithuanian Infantry Fighting Vehicle configuration.&quot;

 Australian Army (211 vehicles)

Under Land 400 Phase II Australia will receive 211 Boxer designated Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV), with deliveries expected until at least 2026.

The first 25 CRVs were manufactured in Germany through to 2021 to meet an early Australian capability requirement for familiarisation and training. The first CRVs were formally handed over to the Australian Army in September 2019. Prior to delivery the Boxers were modified locally with Australian-specific communications and battlefield management systems and fitted temporarily with the Kongsberg Protector RWS that previously equipped Australian ASLAVs deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Training with the first-delivered vehicles commenced by October 2020. The first 25 &#x27;Block I&#x27; vehicles consisted of 13 in Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV) configuration and 12 in CRV Reconnaissance configuration.

Production of the remaining 186 Block II platforms was scheduled to begin in late 2022 at RDA&#x27;s Military Vehicle Centre of Excellence (MILVEHCOE) at Ipswich in Queensland, Rheinmetall&#x27;s biggest facility outside Germany. Australia&#x27;s Boxer CRV is scheduled to be fitted with the Israeli Spike-LR2 anti-tank missile.

The 186 Block II CRVs are made up of 121 in the Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV) Reconnaissance variant, 29 in a joint fires support configuration (CRV-JFS), 15 in a command and control configuration (CRV-C2), 10 in a repair configuration (with crane) (CRV-REP), and 11 in a recovery configuration (with winch) (CRV-REC). Also included are 12 additional mission modules: 5 CRV-JFS; 4 CRV-C2; 2 CRV-REC; 1 CRV-REP. Also included are 20 frames for mission modules that allow these to be transported by truck, and within ISO dimensions. The contract includes an option for 11 ambulance mission modules.

 German Army (551 ordered in total as of January 2025)

The original German Army order consisted of 272 drive modules and 272 accompanying mission modules. Configurations ordered were 125 in armoured personnel carrier (APC) configuration, 72 in 72 armoured medical treatment vehicle configuration (ambulance), 65 in command configuration, and 12 driver training vehicles. First production example delivered in 2009.

The second order called for all 131 vehicles ordered to be of a revised A2 APC new configuration. Order placed in 2015 with deliveries concluding in 2021.

The third German order is for a Joint Fire Support Team (JFST) configuration, the contract award dating to 2021. Two JFST prototypes have been ordered and these will be delivered 2024–2026.

The fourth German order was placed in 2024 and calls for 19 Boxer Skyranger 30. The €595 million contract calls for a prototype at the end of 2024, followed by 18 production vehicles, with an option for 30 more.

The fifth German Boxer order calls for 123 Boxer based on the Australian CRV-variant and these were ordered in March 2024, with deliveries from 2025 to 2030.

The above information accounts for 547 of the 551 total provided by ARTEC at IAV 2025, the assumption being the unidentified four examples are developmental and/or prototype vehicles.

 Lithuanian Land Force (91, 27 on order) 

Lithuania ordered 91 Boxer A2 in 2016 for €385.6 million, with deliveries from 2017 to 2023. Two driving training vehicles (DTVs) were delivered in December 2017, these followed by 89 Infantry Fighting Vehicles &quot;Vilkas&quot; of which two prototypes were tested in 2018, with deliveries following from 2019 to 2023. The 89 IFVs are split: 55 squad leader vehicles; 18 platoon leaders vehicles; 12 company leader vehicles; 4 command posts vehicles. Following these deliveries Lithuania indicated a desire to acquire a small additional quantity of Boxer in specialist configurations and in October 2024 an order for 27 additional Boxer was announced. Details were limited but deliveries will include an engineering variant that will directly integrate engineering equipment (such as that used for mine clearance) into the existing Lithuanian IFV configuration.

 Royal Netherlands Army (200)

The original prototype was delivered to the Dutch Army for evaluation in October in 2003, and the contract for the procurement of 200 Boxer was disclosed in December 2006 at a value of €1.2 billion (€1.429 billion end cost). Deliveries ran from 2013 to 2018. The order called for 92 engineering section vehicles (including battle damage repair vehicles), 52 ambulance, 36 command post, 12 cargo carriers, and eight driver training vehicles.

 Ukrainian ground forces (63)

In September 2022 it was announced that Ukraine would purchase 18 Boxer RCH-155 for €216m, funded from German aid.
In February 2024, 18 additional RCH-155 were decided as additional support from Germany to Ukraine.
In June 2024, KNDS revealed that 54 were on order in total for Ukraine, meaning that 18 additional RCH-155 had been ordered. The first RCH 155 delivery took place in January 2025, and that same month the delivery of nine Boxer RCT30 IFVs designated AiTO30 FDC and equipped with systems specifically designed for counter-drone operations to protect artillery units from aerial threats was confirmed.

===Future operators===
 British Army (623 from 2024 confirmed)

In November 2019 the UK Ministry of Defence awarded ARTEC a GBP2.3 billion (US$2.97 billion) contract to deliver 523 Boxer in three main configurations, these encompassing nine sub-configurations. In April 2022 it was announced that a further 100 Boxer would be ordered, bringing the total to 623. The British Army plans to achieve a Boxer Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in 2025, and Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2032.

The UK MoD breaks its Boxer order down by Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV) variant, by Build configuration, and by Role. A MIV variant can have more than one Build configuration, and any number of Roles, making interrogation of quantities difficult. The current totals are broken out by Role only and are given for 523/623 order quantities.
* 85/146 Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV)
* 60/60 Engineer Section Vehicle (ESV) 
* 62/62 Recce/Fire Support Vehicles (Recce/FSV) 
* 28/28 Mortar Carrying Variant (MCV)
* 50/50 Equipment Support/ES Repair (Rep)
* 123/158 Command-and-Control (C2V) and C2 Utility (C2U)
* 19/19 Observation Post Vehicle (OPV)
* 24/24 Beyond-Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) observation platforms
* 11/11 Electronic Warfare and SIGINT (ESWI) platforms
* 61/65 Ambulance 

There is also an unknown quantity of Boxer RCH-155 to add to these totals (96 planned in the Mobile Fire Platform Programme).

 Qatar (10 during 2024)

The Qatari Army is reportedly (as of Q1 2023) in the process of receiving 10 Boxer fitted with a RCT30 unmanned turret and a passive radio frequency sensor for the purpose of protecting against small unmanned aerial vehicles.

In September 2024, it was reported that Germany has approved the sale of the RCH 155 for Qatar in exchange for 12 PzH 2000s, which will be transferred to Ukraine.

=== Potential orders ===

 Australian Army (11)

The option exists to purchase 11 ambulances.

 German Army 

168 (up to) RCH 155: According to some sources selected for &quot;ZukSysIndF program&quot; (artillery future system, indirect fire, longer range).

Up to 30 additional Boxer for the &quot;NNbS program (Nah- und Nächstbereichs-schutz),&quot; equipped with the Skyranger 30 turret, for command and control of SHORAD air-defence&quot;.&quot; Prototype + 18 ordered in 2024. Prototype/verification vehicle delivered Q1 2025.

The German Army intends to field four medium brigades and these brigades are planned to be equipped with new Boxer variants, including the Boxer Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicle (AIFV). While not confirmed, it was reported in May 2024 that the Bundeswehr had selected the RCT30 turret option for the AIFV Boxer. Sources suggested that the Netherlands could also order a batch of RCT30-fitted Boxer. The German project was scheduled for parliamentary approval in Q4 2024, with reports in January 2025 stating that the German order for 150 Boxer AIFV and a batch of 72 for the Netherlands have been delayed to Q2 or Q3 2025 by the German national elections, these to be held on 23 February.

Other projects include:

* 79 JFST production vehicles
* Boxer GBF (Geschützte Bewegliche Führungseinrichtung), a command vehicle, unknown quantity.

 Royal Netherlands Army (82)

10 Boxer for electronic warfare missions to replace the TPZ Fuchs EloKa are planned to be purchased by the Netherlands Army., and 72 Boxer RCT30 (PuBo) infantry fighting vehicles are planned to be purchased for the 13th Light Brigade. As of Q1 2025 no contractual details for either acquisition had been announced, but it was disclosed that as it was tied in with a German order (for economies of scale) that the acquisition of 72 RCT30-fitted Boxer had been delayed to Q2 or Q3 2025 by the German national elections, these to be held on 23 February.

 British Army

The UK will likely order additional mission modules which include:

* &quot;Mobile Fires Platform (MFP)&quot;
* &quot;Serpens Deep Find Radar:&quot; The UK plans to procure the GM 200 MM/C as part of the &quot;Serpens Project&quot;. The radar systems might be installed on mission modules for the Boxer.
* &quot;SHORAD Boxer&quot; include: 
** &quot;Command and Control&quot;
** &quot;Forward Repair Team&quot;
** &quot;Active Sensor&quot;
** &quot;Counter-Small Aerial Targets (C-SAT)&quot;
** &quot;SHORAD Mounted variants.&quot;

=== Cancelled orders ===
 Slovenian Army

In March 2018, Slovenia announced the selection of the Boxer, with 48 vehicles planned in a configuration close to the Lithuanian variant Vilkas IFV. Following an initial postponement, in May 2022, Slovenia signed a contract with ARTEC to procure 45 Boxer. In September 2022, the Slovenian government announced the cancellation of the Boxer contract.

=== Competitions lost / potential sales not concluded ===
 Bulgarian Land Forces

In 2017, Bulgaria invited companies to submit offers for a future IFV and other combat support vehicles (reconnaissance, combat engineering, ambulance) based on a 8×8 armoured vehicles. Over time, several offers were made by various competitors and in September 2023 General Dynamics Land Systems was awarded the contract for Stryker.

 Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force

Japan requested information regarding Boxer to succeed to the 8×8 Type 96 APC, especially as the Komatsu proposal collapsed, there was an opportunity to join the ARTEC collaboration, but in 2019 the type was not one of three preselected bidders for this program, with Patria&#x27;s AMVXP selected in December 2022.

 Spanish Army

In 2015, a program to replace the VEC-M1, the BMR-M1 and part of the M113 fleet was launched by the Spanish Army. Competitors included Boxer, and in September 2015 GDELS&#x27; Piranha V was selected. In December 2019, the program was cancelled and relaunched, and in August 2020 the Piranha V was again announced as winner.

 Swiss Army

Starting in 2022 the Swiss Army conducted a program to select successor to the M109 KAWEST WE as part of the &quot;Artillerie Wirkplattform und Wirkmittel 2026&quot; program, with RCH 155 mounted on either the Boxer A3 or the Mowag Piranha IV 10×10 and the BAE Bofors Archer participating in the competition. In November 2024 Mowag Piranha IV mounted RCH 155 was selected.

<text>Borrowed Heaven is the fourth studio album by Irish rock band The Corrs, released through Atlantic Records on 31 May 2004. The album was produced by Olle Romo.

The band released three singles from this album: &quot;Summer Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, and &quot;Long Night&quot;. A remix version of &quot;Goodbye&quot; was released as a download-only single in 2006. Other notable tracks include the title track &quot;Borrowed Heaven&quot;, which featured an appearance from Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and &quot;Time Enough for Tears&quot;, which was penned by U2&#x27;s Bono and featured in the 2002 film &quot;In America&quot;, for which it was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. The acoustic performances for this album&#x27;s Electronic Press Kit were recorded at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. The album would be their last album of original material until 2015&#x27;s &quot;White Light&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Borrowed Heaven&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, the album has garnered a score of 58 over 100, based on 7 mainstream critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.

<text>Paul Ben-Haim (or Paul Ben-Chaim, Hebrew: פאול בן חיים) (5 July 1897 – 14 January 1984) was an Israeli composer. Born Paul Frankenburger in Munich, Germany, he studied composition with Friedrich Klose and he was assistant conductor to Bruno Walter and Hans Knappertsbusch from 1920 to 1924. He served as conductor at Augsburg from 1924 to 1931, and afterwards devoted himself to teaching and composition, including teaching at the Shulamit Conservatory in Tel Aviv, Israel. 

Ben-Haim emigrated to the then British Mandate of Palestine in 1933 and lived in Tel Aviv, near Zina Dizengoff Square. He Hebraized his name, becoming an Israeli citizen upon that nation&#x27;s independence in 1948. He composed chamber music, works for choir, orchestra and solo instruments, and songs. He championed a specifically Jewish national music: his own compositions are in a late Romantic vein with Middle Eastern overtones, somewhat similar to Ernest Bloch.

His students include Eliahu Inbal, Henri Lazarof, Ben-Zion Orgad, Ami Maayani, Shulamit Ran, Miriam Shatal, Rami Bar-Niv and Noam Sheriff. [] Ben-Haim won the Israel Prize for music in 1957.

The archive of Ben-Haim is preserved in the National Library of Israel.

<text>This is a list of television stations in Canada licensed to broadcast by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), all having call signs which begin with the letter C.

A blue background indicates a station that continues to broadcast exclusively via an analogue transmission in lieu of a conversion to digital broadcasting. A dark blue background indicates a station that acts as the flagship of a television network (CBC, Ici Radio-Canada, TVA, CTV, Citytv and Global) or a television system (CTV 2, CBC North and Omni).

Note that in recent years most Canadian television stations affiliated with a network are generally no longer identified by their call letters on air for the purposes of branding. For example, CFQC-DT in Saskatoon is branded as &quot;CTV Saskatoon&quot; and so on.

<doc id="656249" wikidata="Q2607421" url="?curid=656249" title="Central Bank of Jordan">
<text>The Central Bank of Jordan () is the central bank of Jordan whose main duties include the release and distribution of the Jordanian currency and the maintenance of a national reserve of gold and foreign currencies. The bank also maintains and insures the safety of the banking environment in Jordan.

==Foundation==
Jordan set out preparations to establish the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) in the late 1950s. The Law of the CBJ was enacted in 1959. Thereafter, its operational procedures were commenced on the first day of October 1964. The CBJ succeeded the Jordan Currency Board which had been established in 1950. The capital of the CBJ, which is totally owned by the government, was increased gradually, from one million to 18 billion Jordanian Dinars. The CBJ enjoys the status of an independent and autonomous corporate body, although its capital is owned entirely by the government.

== Objectives and functions==
The law establishing the CBJ stipulates that &quot;the objectives of the Central Bank shall be to maintain monetary stability in the Kingdom, to ensure the convertibility of the Jordanian Dinar, and to promote the sustained growth of the Kingdom&#x27;s economy in accordance with the general economic policy of the government.&quot;

To achieve these objectives, the CBJ&#x27;s functions include:

=== Issuing and regulating bank notes and coins===
The CBJ is the sole issuer of the Jordanian currency. The CBJ ensures the availability of bank notes and coins to meet the needs of the national economy, and maintains an adequate inventory of these bank notes and coins. The CBJ also re-issues the Jordanian currency and replaces damaged, soiled, and mutilated bank notes. In addition, the CBJ issues commemorative coins.

=== Maintaining and managing the Kingdom&#x27;s reserves of gold and foreign exchange===
The CBJ is responsible for determining the suitable investment opportunities as well as setting ratios and components of reserves to ensure their safety, liquidity, and profitability, as these reserves constitute a cornerstone in the stability of the Jordanian Dinar exchange rate. To fulfil this task, the CBJ adopts a flexible investment policy that is compatible with the ongoing developments in foreign exchange and international financial markets.

=== Acting as a banker and fiscal agent to the government and public institutions===
The CBJ acts as a banker and fiscal agent to the government and public institutions, as it maintains their revenue and expenditure accounts, makes transfers, opens letters of credit, manages and implements loan and trade agreements, and extends credit to the treasury. In addition, the CBJ issues and manages public debt securities on behalf of the government and public institutions in Jordan. Likewise, the CBJ administers, on behalf of the government, Jordan&#x27;s subscriptions in international and regional financial institutions, and manages and implements payment agreements between the government and other countries.

=== Acting as a banker to banks and specialized credit institutions===
The CBJ maintains banks’ deposits, extends credit to them through advances and rediscounts, and furnishes banks with credit risk information, custody, and electronic clearing services. Besides, the CBJ, sells to and buys from banks, both treasury bills and foreign exchange necessary to cover their external payment needs. Furthermore, the CBJ issues licenses authorizing banks to operate and branch in Jordan.

=== Maintaining the safety of the banking system===
The CBJ supervises the banking system to ensure its soundness, and protects depositors and shareholders. In doing so, the CBJ focuses on increasing the paid up capital, improving the capital adequacy ratio, and expanding the scope of the application of international auditing and accounting standards related to solvency, assets, profitability, liquidity and management. Moreover, the CBJ stresses the importance of continuous education and training of banks’ employees so that they keep up to date with developments in the financial market. Furthermore, the CBJ performs on-site and off-site surveillance of licensed banks.

=== Advising the government on the formulation and implementation of fiscal and economic policies===
The CBJ proposes, upon its initiative or upon government request, specific suggestions and recommendations related to the prevailing economic, financial and monetary conditions. Besides, it participates in the formulation of economic policies, particularly, in relation to economic development plans. Furthermore, the CBJ has a distinctive role in the regular consultations between Jordanian authorities and international financial organizations, in particular, those related to economic and structural adjustment programs adopted since 1989.

=== Managing monetary problems and participating in containing local economic problems===
The CBJ, pursuant to its legal powers, adopts procedures and measures to deal with economic problems to avoid their adverse effects on the Jordanian economy.

=== Regulating credit===
The CBJ regulates the quantity, quality, and cost of credit to meet the requirements of economic development and monetary stability. Monetary policy tools available to the CBJ to regulate credit include open market operations, the reserve requirement ratio and the discount rate.

=== Other roles===
In addition to the above-mentioned functions, the CBJ has effectively participated in the establishment of a number of financial institutions and corporations, such as Amman Stock Exchange, Jordan Mortgage Refinance Company, Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation, Deposit Insurance Corporation, all of which have played an evident role in supporting economic development efforts in Jordan.

LaChapelle as postmaster. In 1912, two surveyors staying at the home of resident Frank Barton, laid out a town around the lake, sold lots, and named the town for Barton. The name of the post office was changed to Barton City on April 1, 1912.

<text>Malcolm-Jamal Warner (born August 18, 1970) is an American actor. He rose to prominence for his role as Theodore Huxtable on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1984–1992), which earned him a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series at the 38th Primetime Emmy Awards. He is also known for his roles as Malcolm McGee on the UPN sitcom &quot;Malcolm &amp; Eddie&quot; (1996–2000), and Dr. Alex Reed in the sitcom &quot;Reed Between the Lines&quot; (2011, 2015).

Warner also became an executive producer for the PBS Kids series &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot;, which is also produced by Nelvana, Scholastic, and South Carolina Educational Television. In 2015, he received a Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance for the song &quot;Jesus Children&quot; alongside Robert Glasper Experiment and Lalah Hathaway. He later appeared as Al Cowlings on the FX limited series &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot;. Warner formerly played Dr. AJ Austin on the FOX medical drama &quot;The Resident&quot;.

==Early life==
Warner was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. He was raised by his mother, Pamela, who served as his manager. He was named after Malcolm X and jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal. At the age of nine, he demonstrated an interest in show business that led to enrollment in acting schools. His career as a child performer later led him to graduate high school from The Professional Children&#x27;s School in New York City, New York.

==Career==
With appearances and roles on many television shows and films, he landed his most successful role as Theo Huxtable, the only son of Heathcliff Huxtable, who was played by Bill Cosby on the NBC sitcom, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; from 1984 to 1992. Warner auditioned for the role on the final day of the nationwide search and was chosen by Cosby himself.

During his tenure on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, Warner turned his hand to directing, making music videos including New Edition&#x27;s &quot;N.E. Heart Break&quot; (1989), rapper Special Ed&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m the Magnificent&quot; (1989), and British R&amp;B group Five Star&#x27;s &quot;I Love You For Sentimental Reasons&quot; (1994). He has directed episodes of many sitcoms, including &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;All That&quot;, &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;, and &quot;Malcolm &amp; Eddie&quot;. In addition, Warner directed the acclaimed, teen-oriented public health video &quot;Time Out: The Truth About HIV, AIDS, and You&quot; (1992), which featured Arsenio Hall and Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson discussing the realities of HIV and AIDS and the best ways to prevent its spread.

He went on to star in &quot;Jeremiah&quot;, was the voice of The Producer character on &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; and co-starred with comedian Eddie Griffin for four years on the UPN sitcom &quot;Malcolm &amp; Eddie&quot;. Warner continued his career on the CBS sitcom &quot;Listen Up&quot; with Jason Alexander and was the host of the literacy-promoting children&#x27;s show &quot;CBS Storybreak&quot;. He guest-starred on an episode of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; playing the role of Hilary&#x27;s boyfriend. In 1995, Warner appeared as a homeless man on &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;.

In 2011 and 2012, he guest starred in four episodes of the NBC series &quot;Community&quot; as Andre, the ex-husband of Shirley Bennett (Yvette Nicole Brown). His character subtly referenced his &quot;Cosby Show&quot; past by wearing a &quot;Cosby sweater&quot; that he stated was from his dad.

He is a bass guitar player and a performance poet, and has performed at the National Black Theatre Festival since 2003, in addition to hosting its Poetry Jam.

Warner has co-starred in BET&#x27;s scripted comedic television series &quot;Reed Between the Lines&quot;.

The couple had three children: Kaci and Kenan Reynolds, Carla&#x27;s children from a previous relationship, and Alexis Reed, their child together. The show highlighted the couple&#x27;s ups and downs together as a blended family. In 2012, Warner was nominated for Outstanding Actor in a comedy series at the NAACP Image awards for his role in &quot;Reed Between the Lines&quot;. In the spring of 2015, it was announced that Warner would be playing the part of Al Cowlings in the crime series &quot;American Crime Story&quot;, based on the events of the O. J. Simpson trial.

Warner played prison counselor Julius Rowe on the sixth season of USA network&#x27;s &quot;Suits&quot;. On the TNT series &quot;Major Crimes&quot;, he portrays Lt. Chuck Cooper, a member of the LAPD&#x27;s Special Investigation&#x27;s Section (SIS) and the love interest of the Major Crime Division&#x27;s Detective Amy Sykes. He also played the role of parole officer James Bagwell on Amazon Prime&#x27;s show &quot;Sneaky Pete&quot; and as Dr. AJ &quot;The Raptor&quot; Austin on FOX&#x27;s &quot;The Resident&quot;.

<doc id="656262" wikidata="Q55098" url="?curid=656262" title="Fontvieille, Monaco">
<text>Fontvieille (; ) is the southernmost ward in the Principality of Monaco. It was developed by Italian engineer Gianfranco Gilardini and designed by architect Manfredi Nicoletti, between the 1970s and the 1990s.

== History ==
In contrast to the other city districts Monaco-Ville, Monte Carlo and La Condamine, Fontvieille was constructed, after Italian engineer Gianfranco Gilardini&#x27;s design, almost entirely on artificially reclaimed land and thus represents one of the younger parts of the principality. In order to combat the chronic land shortage in the extremely densely populated principality, the work was begun in 1966 to create new land in the Mediterranean Sea southwest of &quot;le rocher&quot;. In 1981, Albert II, then Crown Prince, laid the cornerstone for the new city quarter.

The existence of Fontvieille, and its many public works projects, relates substantially to former Prince of Monaco, Prince Rainier III&#x27;s reputation as the Builder Prince.

Plans announced in late 2009 to extend Fontvieille by the Department of Urban Development are currently being overseen by Prince Albert. The plan is to build a small aura on the west side of the rock, currently planned to be finished by 2015.

The new area will include three to four new hotels, corporate businesses, shops and apartments for between 600 and 800 newcomers.

Despite not being the highest-priced part of Monaco, flats are also very expensive. For example, a 65 m2 (700 ft²) one bedroom apartment with one bathroom and one car parking space was offered at €3,200,000 in May 2015.

<doc id="656263" wikidata="Q200613" url="?curid=656263" title="Symphony No. 4 (Prokofiev)">
<text>Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 is actually two works, both using material created for &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; ballet. The first, Op. 47, was completed in 1930 and premiered that November; it lasts about 22 minutes. The second, Op. 112, is too different to be termed a &quot;revision&quot;; made in 1947, it is about 37 minutes long, differs stylistically from the earlier work, reflecting a new context, and differs formally as well in its grander instrumentation.

==Symphony No. 4, Op. 47==

===Context and genesis===
As a concert pianist, Prokofiev travelled worldwide, and toured the United States during the 1925-26 season. In early 1927, he went on a two-month concert tour of the Soviet Union. He planned to return in 1928, but those plans fell through. In 1929, another planned Soviet tour was cancelled, this time because of a hand injury Prokofiev suffered in a car accident.
Throughout this time as a touring virtuoso, Prokofiev also continued to compose. Symphony No. 2 in D minor premiered in Paris under the baton of Serge Koussevitzky in the summer of 1925, to tepid critical response. At the same time, Sergei Diaghilev, the ballet impresario, suggested that Prokofiev write a ballet on a Soviet subject. The resulting piece was &quot;Le pas d&#x27;acier&quot; (&quot;The Steel Step&quot;), Prokofiev&#x27;s third ballet for Diaghilev, which premiered in Paris in the summer of 1927. He had also been working on an opera entitled &quot;The Fiery Angel&quot;, of which several premieres had been cancelled. He decided to salvage some of the material from the opera, and turned it into his Symphony No. 3 in C minor. In late 1928, with the aforementioned Soviet tour cancelled, Prokofiev decided to accept another ballet commission from Diaghilev. This piece, rather than being on futurist themes like &quot;Le pas d&#x27;acier&quot;, was based on a Biblical story: &quot;L&#x27;enfant Prodigue&quot; (Parable of the Prodigal Son from the Bible). The moralistic, Biblical subject matter was not an anomaly; such subjects were popular in the Parisian ballet scene in the late 1920s.

As Prokofiev was composing &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; in early 1929, he found that many of the themes he was creating would work better in a more developmental symphonic context, rather than the more episodic layout of a ballet. So, he began composing a new symphony, alongside the ballet. The two works share much of the same material, although one does not specifically borrow from the other: they were composed mostly concurrently. The ballet, &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, premiered in Paris in the summer of 1929, to great critical acclaim. It would be the last collaboration between Diaghilev and Prokofiev, because Diaghilev died just months later, in August.

The symphony that resulted, Symphony No. 4, Op. 47, began from material originally written for the ballet&#x27;s fourth number. Prokofiev expanded the material into a sonata form, and the resulting music is the first movement of Symphony No. 4. The rest of the symphony draws on material that appears in the ballet, or that Diaghilev rejected as not fitting his vision for the ballet.

Koussevitzky had been discussing a commission for the fiftieth anniversary of the Boston Symphony Orchestra with Prokofiev in 1929. Prokofiev&#x27;s response was the Symphony No. 4. However, because the commission fee was lower than Prokofiev was willing to accept, Prokofiev only allowed the Boston Symphony to purchase the manuscript of the work, rather than commission it. This meant that Prokofiev received less money, and the Boston Symphony did not get the prestige of a commission. Prokofiev worked on the symphony on the long train rides he had to take during a tour of the United States in early 1930. However, because of disagreements with Koussevitzky, he returned to Paris in March, before the symphony&#x27;s premiere in Boston in November.

===Instrumentation===

* Woodwinds: Piccolo - 2 Flutes - 2 Oboes - English Horn - 2 Clarinets in B-flat and A - Bass Clarinet - 2 Bassoons - Contrabassoon
* Brass: 4 horns in F - 2 Trumpets in C - 3 Trombones - Tuba
* Percussion: Timpani - Bass Drum - Snare Drum - Cymbals - Suspended cymbal
* Strings: Violins (1st and 2nd) - Violas - Cellos - Double Basses

===Analysis===

====Andante assai - Allegro eroico====

The first movement is in sonata form, beginning with an introduction and ending with a Coda. The introduction, exposition, development, recapitulation, and Coda are clearly distinguished by different tempo markings and time signatures. Though the movement begins and ends in C major the tonal center is ambiguous as it is constantly shifting.

The opening of the movement begins with a slow, newly composed introduction, a warm melody played by the woodwinds (ex.1). This melody also appears in the second movement.

This introduction then leads to the main section, marked allegro eroico. The vigorous, hard-edged theme is taken from the fourth number of the ballet. The excitement of the music is created by the constant 16th-note rhythm played by strings (ex.2). This &quot;machine music&quot; ostinato provides an important part of the texture. The second subject is a lyrical counter-theme, marked Piu tranquillo, introduced by the flute. Following the principles of tripartite first-movement form, the earlier material is developed, and then returns in a varied recapitulation.

====Andante tranquillo====

The second movement is in C major, based on the final episode of the ballet. The serene, glowing theme contains the most memorable melody in the work. Prokofiev exalts the moment with the simplest of the flute melodies (ex.3), blending itself with the strings.

The form of this movement is ABCB1A1DXA2, with A being the glowing melody and X a reminiscence of the symphony&#x27;s introduction. The BCB1 component can be considered a ternary episode. B suggests a sonata transition, while the C material arrives with the weight of a sonata second subject. In a purported sonata allegro scheme, the B1 section would inaugurate the development, given its more active texture and return to the main key of C. The A theme is developed next, with canonic imitations in E-flat major, after which surface the mysterious B-major chords of section D. These two sections (D and X) shatter the proposed sonata scheme, and in place of a recapitulation, the movement closes with another reprise of the lyrical A theme.

====Moderato, quasi allegretto====
The form of this movement is Scherzo and Trio. This elegant and spirited movement is the only movement that Prokofiev borrowed completely from the ballet, including the third number as the main body, and the fifth as the ending.
The music of the ballet&#x27;s third number proceeds up to the last four bars, when it switches to a reprise of the ballet&#x27;s fifth number.

At the Scherzo, Prokofiev indulges in new delicacies of orchestration, giving a sinuous dance theme to the strings (ex.4), and decorating it on its return. The angular unisons framing the Trio section benefit from a touch of counterpoint in the trumpet and horn parts, and the ballet dance&#x27;s form lends itself perfectly to a classically proportioned scherzo.

====Allegro risoluto====
The fourth movement draws on material from numbers 1, 2, 5, and 9 of the ballet, and is in sonata form. The first theme (in C major) is formed of a combination of the toccata-like opening of the ballet&#x27;s first number with the lyrical melody from the ballet&#x27;s second number. These elements are altered both as a unit and as separate elements throughout the movement. The transition to the second theme consists of a quick sequence of variations on the lyrical portion of the first theme, modulating quite a distance (to G-flat major at one point). The second subject is newly composed for the symphony, and is a minor third away, in A major.

The development consists primarily of a large section from the ballet&#x27;s fifth number, dominated by horns and tuba. The toccata-like material from the first theme is also subjected to heavy development. The recapitulation is prefaced by a jarring statement of the theme from the fifth number in B-flat major, followed by a blaring diminished-seventh fanfare. The recapitulation begins with the newly composed second theme, and transitions to the Coda through some variations of the fanfare motive from the end of the development. The coda consists of a push and pull between C major and C minor, with the major key winning, based largely on material from the ballet&#x27;s ninth number.

===Early reception===

In addition to Prokofiev, other reputable composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Paul Hindemith, and Arthur Honegger were also commissioned to write music for Boston in the 1930-1931 season. The Fourth Symphony was premiered on November 14, 1930 in Symphony Hall in Boston with Serge Koussevitzky conducting in the composer&#x27;s absence. This symphony would be his third and final symphony to be composed outside of the Soviet Union.

Prokofiev finished the Fourth Symphony well before the deadline, and was optimistic about the work. Koussevitzky on the other hand was skeptical of Prokofiev&#x27;s reworking of ideas from the ballet, and the premiere received a lukewarm reception. Music critics began accusing Prokofiev of running dry of ideas after several unsuccessful performances of the work. Prokofiev consequently provided a statement to a Soviet magazine protesting these accusations.

The European premiere of the Fourth Symphony occurred on December 18, 1930 in Brussels under Pierre Monteux. The program at this premiere would prove to be problematic, because Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor (which was first on the program) was a triumphant success, and overshadowed the Fourth Symphony, which immediately followed. The Fourth Symphony also received little to no positive attention at its Soviet premiere on October 30, 1933 at the Bolshoy Theater. Prokofiev persevered despite this trend of disappointment, and later in 1937 he performed the Fourth Symphony at a festival celebrating the 20th anniversary of the October Revolution. At this concert, Israel Nestyev states that the Fourth Symphony &quot;was received coldly.&quot; These poor receptions not only hindered Prokofiev&#x27;s confidence, but also drew negative attention from the Soviet Committee of Arts and Affairs.

==Symphony No. 4, Op. 112==

===Context and Genesis===

In 1932, Joseph Stalin created the Union of Soviet Composers, and laid out a doctrine of &quot;socialist realism&quot; in art. This meant that for art to be supported by the regime, it had to be relevant to everyday people, and it needed to glorify the best of socialism. In reality, this led to bans of material disliked, or deemed &quot;formalist&quot;, by the regime.

In the summer of 1936, after many recent trips and performances in the Soviet Union, the Prokofiev family moved there. Prokofiev had been promised many privileges, including the freedom to move freely, which were eventually curtailed. As Prokofiev was considering a return to the Soviet Union, he believed that the direction his music was taking at the time (a simpler, more straightforward style) would allow him to excel there.

Starting in 1946, there was an even more extreme crackdown on Soviet musicians, led by Andrei Zhdanov. Many works and composers were banned and warned, including Prokofiev himself, although he had been relatively successful and popular in the Soviet Union up until that time. In the winter of 1946-1947, he finished work on Symphony No. 6 in E-flat minor. Prokofiev was also working on his opera &quot;War and Peace&quot;, the second part of which would be subject to cancellation in the summer of 1947 by the authorities, due to the composer&#x27;s refusal to cut certain controversial scenes.

In early 1947, Prokofiev was presented with the idea of revising his Symphony No. 4 Op. 47. The idea appealed to him for several reasons. First, the original version had never had much success (especially in the Soviet Union), but Prokofiev believed that the material had great potential. Second, he had just had great success with his Symphony No. 5 in B-flat major, and he hoped to reshape No. 4 in its image. Symphony No. 5 in B-flat major had been in the style of socialist realism, so many of the changes in the revision lent the new work a more expansive and heroic feel. The revision altered the original so thoroughly that Prokofiev felt that it was a new work; thus the new opus number, 112. In the summer of 1947, when the revisions took place, he also orchestrated Symphony No. 6 and wrote two propaganda pieces: Festive Poem and Flourish, O Mighty Land, both works for large forces.

===Instrumentation===

These are the additional instruments that are added

* Woodwinds: E-flat Clarinet
* Brass: 1 trumpet
* Keyboard: Piano
* Percussion: Triangle, Tambourine, and Wood blocks
* Strings: Harp

===Analysis===
====Andante - Allegro eroico====
In this revised first movement, the augmentation of the original material doubles the length of the movement. The orchestration of this movement is also thicker than the original, and more closely resembles the orchestration of Prokofiev&#x27;s Fifth and Sixth. The combination of a heavier use of brass and the use of piano and harp adds a unique timbre to the piece, further distancing it from the original neoclassical idiom. The different sections are not as clearly identified by tempi as is the original symphony. In the introduction a new theme is added (ex.5) that precedes the original first theme.

Apart from this new theme, the introduction is essentially the same. The main difference in this revision is the heavily expanded development section. Prokofiev expands the sound palette with string Tremolos and dissonant chords in the brass. This movement also includes many more key changes and expands the machine-like ostinati from the first version. Prokofiev also utilizes more transitional material before introducing and underscoring the new subjects.

====Andante tranquillo====
To fit the larger scale of a socialist realist symphony, the second movement&#x27;s revision basically doubles its length. It is extended primarily by repeating many thematic statements that only appeared once in Opus 47.

In this movement, the four-measure introduction is extended by four measures and supplemented with
striking new harmonies. There are other such expansions: the B theme is doubled by alternating its sub-phrases with new material of a &quot;ticking clock&quot; quality. Later on, the A theme is also doubled in size: first it is played in E-flat major and then in B major. Consequently, there is a modulation to G major. At the 3/4, the melody in the oboes and English horn appears as in Opus 47, but here this passage leads to a reminiscence of the original introduction theme. After the appearance of the introduction theme, following a reappearance of theme A, Prokofiev moves quickly back to the original, restrained ending, taken from the ballet.

====Moderato, quasi allegretto====
In this movement, Prokofiev adds to the Scherzo and Trio a new introduction, extends the coda, and inserts material at the main transition points that further develop the subjects.

The introduction begins with a light touch, presenting motifs that anticipate the later themes. The newly added coda has a serious character created by the somber harmony and the momentary appearance of a chorale-like texture. Such serious, weighty passages place the original, lighter material in figurative quotation marks, almost mocking them as unserious or unworthy.

====Allegro risoluto====
The finale is the movement that underwent the most alteration in the revision process. It is no longer in sonata form, but instead it is a series of thematic areas that are developed somewhat chaotically, followed by a triumphant apotheosis. It is similar in form to the finale of the Sixth Symphony in this way. An introduction is added, which takes the toccata-like material from the ballet&#x27;s first number, and slows it to half the speed, and emphasizes the martial character by adding pounding timpani and bass drum (ex.6). The first theme and transition from Opus 47 follow, but then the second theme is deleted entirely.

Instead of the second theme, the transition moves into a dark and moody section in E-flat major and in 6/8 meter, resembling some kind of somber procession. After a somewhat abrupt end to this section, the original development from Opus 47 proceeds unaltered. Because the second theme from Opus 47 has been removed, there is no recapitulatory gesture. Instead, a new coda follows, with a quick, dancing theme. Prokofiev described this cancan-like material as &quot;thievish.&quot; This theme is abruptly interrupted by the new, slowed-toccata idea from the introduction blaring out triumphantly, a victory cry for the people. The piece ends on this jarring, incongruous note.

===Reception and performance history===
In early 1948, shortly after the revisions of Opus 112 were completed, the Union of Soviet Composers issued commands that Prokofiev&#x27;s music (among others) be banned from concert halls, amid accusations of &quot;formalism.&quot; The revised Symphony No. 4 was thus not performed in the Soviet Union until 1957, after the composer&#x27;s death.
Symphony No. 4 Op. 112 had three significant premiere performances. The first premiere was Sir Adrian Boult conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra in a radio broadcast on March 11, 1950. The concert premiere was Gennadi Rozhdestvensky conducting the U.S.S.R. State Symphony Orchestra on January 5, 1957 at the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory. Finally, the first performance of the Symphony No. 4 Op. 112 in the western hemisphere was by the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of Eugene Ormandy on September 27, 1957.

In a review of Neeme Järvi&#x27;s recordings of Prokofiev&#x27;s Third and Fourth Symphonies, Robert Cummings states that:
Opinion among musicologists and critics has tended to favor the earlier work, but
conductors have shown a marked preference for the expanded version in both
the concert hall and recording studio.
This statement is substantiated by the fact that there are twice as many recordings available of Opus 112 as there are of Opus 47. Robert Layton offers another perspective on the relationship between the two versions in his review of the Fourth Symphony. It provides some insight into the relative neglect that Opus 47 has felt, in comparison to the more monumental Opus 112:


It is generally agreed that the transformation from dance to symphony in the Fourth is accomplished with less success than is the metamorphosis from The Flaming Angel to the Third Symphony, and whether in reworking the 1930 version Prokofiev wholly succeeded remains open to question. Let us hope that the appearance of these scores presages a resurgence of interest in Prokofiev&#x27;s Paris years, for works such as the now neglected Quintet, Op. 39, and the almost forgotten Divertissement for orchestra, Op. 43, deserve a far more prominent place in the repertory.

It was not until the mid-1980s that both Opus 47 and Opus 112 were presented in complete recordings of Prokofiev symphonies. Neeme Järvi was the first conductor to do this, in 1988, and presented them both as masterpieces worthy of attention. Opus 47 was subsequently deleted from the catalog, shortly after the album&#x27;s release. It was not until Valery Gergiev released a Prokofiev complete symphonic recording in 2006 that Russia and the western world were again able to hear both versions. Mstislav Rostropovich has also presented both versions in a complete symphonic collection. In 2002, the first study score for Opus 47 was finally published.

<text>Pierre-Jean-Mathias Loras (August 30, 1792 – February 19, 1858) was a French Catholic priest and slave owner in the United States who served as the first Bishop of Dubuque, in what would become the state of Iowa. He was the first president of Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama, from 1830 to 1832, and is the founder of what is now known as Loras College in Dubuque.

==Early life and ministry==
Pierre-Jean-Mathias Loras was born to an aristocratic family in Lyon, France, on August 30, 1792. He was a descendant of a French noble of the robe family. During the Reign of Terror in France, Loras&#x27; father and 16 other members of his family were put to death by guillotine.
As a young man, he studied for the priesthood, along with St. John Vianney (the &quot;Curé d&#x27;Ars&quot;). He was ordained a priest around 1817 by Cardinal Joseph Fesch for the Archdiocese of Lyon. He soon became the Superior of the ecclesiastical Seminary of Largentière. He subsequently resigned from this position to join a group of priests conducting parish missions in the Archdiocese of Lyon.

Bishop-elect Michael Portier of the Diocese of Mobile had gone to France to recruit priests for his diocese. On November 1, 1829, he left with Portier for Alabama. They reached New Orleans on Christmas Eve. Upon arrival at Mobile on January 3, Loras assisted with Portier&#x27;s installation. Loras was appointed vicar general for the Diocese of Mobile and assigned the task of completing the training of the seminarians who had accompanied Portier to America. He was also named rector of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Mobile, and held these positions for seven years, helping Portier recruit priests to serve the diocese. From 1830 to 1832 he served as the first president of Spring Hill College.

==Bishop of Dubuque==

In 1837, the third Provincial Council of Baltimore recommended to the pope that new dioceses be created due to the expansion of the United States. Pope Gregory XVI established the Diocese of Dubuque on July 28, 1837, and Loras was named its first bishop. He was consecrated on December 10, 1837, by Portier in Mobile. The principal co-consecrator was the bishops Antoine Blanc of New Orleans, assisted by John Stephen Bazin of Vincennes.

Loras knew little of his new diocese and wrote to Joseph Rosati of St. Louis to inquire what he might find there. Rosati, whose diocese the territory was taken from, probably knew little as the territory was mostly wilderness. The diocese probably had fewer than 3,000 people in its area that were Catholic. There were three parishes, an Indian mission, and one priest, Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli. The diocesan territory consisted of present-day Iowa, most of Minnesota, and North and South Dakota east of the Missouri River. On July 4, 1838, the area would become the Iowa Territory. Loras named Mazzuchelli vicar general and administrator of the diocese because Loras was not traveling to his new diocese just yet.
Loras traveled to France to recruit missionaries and gather funds for his diocese. Upon returning, he spent the late winter and early spring in St. Louis waiting for more favorable conditions to travel to Dubuque. There he met notable explorer Joseph Nicolas Nicollet who gave Loras insights on his new diocese. On April 19, 1839, Loras arrived in Dubuque for the first time. He brought with him Joseph Crétin, who was consecrated first Bishop of St. Paul in 1851, Jean-Antoine-Marie Pelamourgues, who would spend his career in the diocese based at St. Anthony&#x27;s Church in Davenport, and seminarians Augustin Ravoux who would become a noted missionary among the Native Americans, Lucien Galtier, Remigius Petiot, and James Causse who were pioneer priests in Minnesota. Later that year, he consecrated St. Raphael&#x27;s Church, Iowa&#x27;s first church congregation of any denomination, as his cathedral.

His connections and influence in Europe had enabled him to secure necessary financial assistance from the Society for the Propagation of the Faith of Lyons, France, the Leopoldine Society of Vienna, Austria, and the Foreign Mission Society of Munich, Bavaria. In 1846 when Loras discovered German Catholic immigrants thirty miles west of Dubuque, he convinced them to name their community New Vienna in honor of the Austrian capital and home of one of his benefactors.

Over the next 19 years, Loras guided the Dubuque Diocese during its formative years. He established several missions among the Native American tribes. Loras also established several schools, as well as parishes in every populated area of the diocese. In 1839 he established St. Raphael&#x27;s Seminary, a forerunner of Loras College. Mother Mary Frances Clarke and the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary came to Dubuque in 1843. Loras visited Mount Melleray Abbey in Ireland in 1849 and expressed his desire to have the Trappists establish a monastery in his diocese. Clement Smyth and six monks came to Dubuque County that same year and established New Melleray Abbey. When they had completed the first buildings, another 16 monks arrived to join them.

Not satisfied with St. Raphael&#x27;s Seminary in Dubuque, Loras moved the school south of Dubuque to an area known today as Key West. The new school, renamed St. Bernard&#x27;s College and Seminary, was plagued with financial problems but managed to survive until Loras&#x27; death.

Loras also encouraged immigrants to come to Iowa from the more crowded conditions in the eastern U.S. Soon, Dubuque had growing Irish and German populations. Even though he welcomed immigrants to the area, tensions between immigrant groups caused Loras some of his greatest difficulties.

The Germans felt that Loras had not done enough to give them clergy of German descent. The Irish felt slighted when Loras provided the Germans with their parish, Holy Trinity (now Saint Mary&#x27;s). Some immigrants threatened to withhold contributions to the church. Loras fled the city on two occasions and threatened to withdraw all the clergy from the city. However, tempers eventually cooled, and neither side followed through on their threats.
On July 19, 1850, Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of Saint Paul. The Diocese of Dubuque had been reduced to the boundaries of the state of Iowa, which had been established in 1846.

In the 1850s, under the direction of Loras, the present cathedral church was begun. This was the third building for St.Raphael&#x27;s parish, and it was over three times the size of the old cathedral. Loras did not live long enough to see this cathedral completed, but he could offer the first mass in this new structure at Christmas, 1857.

By the late 1850s, Loras found that his health was failing. He asked the Holy See to name a coadjutor bishop to assist him. On January 9, 1857, Clement Smyth, prior at New Melleray, was appointed as coadjutor bishop.
As the Dubuque Diocese grew in size Loras wrote to Pope Pius IX in May 1857, and in the letter stated that he was considering asking for the Dubuque Diocese to be divided, with Keokuk as the See city for the new diocese. However this was not done in his lifetime.

Although he had been sick for some time, Loras&#x27; death still came suddenly on Friday, February 19, 1858, in Dubuque at 65. Before his death, Loras had been seriously ill but had seemed to be recovering well, even up to the evening of February 18. At about 8:30 on the 18th, he informed his staff that he was retiring for the evening. He ordered them not to disturb him unless necessary, as the divine office he wanted to pray was long, and he wanted to make sure he finished. Around 11:00 PM, his housekeeper heard Loras moaning and informed Father McCabe, who proceeded to the Bishop&#x27;s room and found him collapsed on the floor. During the night, his condition worsened steadily, and sometime between five and six in the morning on February 19, he died.

A funeral Mass was held the following Sunday at 9:00 am. The body of Loras was taken from the old cathedral to the new cathedral for a full service led by Smyth. After the Mass, Loras was buried within the mortuary chapel of the cathedral.

At the time of his death, the Diocese of Dubuque had grown to 54,000 Catholics, in 60 parishes, served by 48 priests in a territory that now only covered the state of Iowa.

==Legacy==
Bishop Loras is still remembered as one of the pioneers of the Catholic Church in Iowa. The college run by the archdiocese in Dubuque, which had numerous name changes in its history, was named after Loras in 1939. Loras Boulevard in Dubuque was also named in his memory. In 2020, his statue was removed from Loras Boulevard after evidence surfaced that Loras had funded some of his missionary work using money earned from the labor of an enslaved person he owned in Alabama.

<text>Bath is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Clinton County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located in Bath Charter Township. As of the 2010 census, the CDP had a population of 2,083.

The community of Bath was listed as a newly-organized census-designated place for the 2010 census, meaning it now has officially defined boundaries and population statistics for the first time.

American supercentenarian Irene Dunham was born in Bath.

===Bath School disaster===
On May 18, 1927, in what became known as the Bath School disaster, Andrew Kehoe, a farmer and local school board member angry over losing an election for town clerk and under notice for foreclosure, killed his wife, detonated bombs in his house and farm buildings, and at the same time set off a bomb in the consolidated school. He drove to the school in a truck rigged with more explosives, which he detonated next to the school superintendent. In all, Kehoe killed 44 people, 38 of them children, and himself, in the worst school mass murder in U.S. history. Only half of the of explosives set under the school went off, probably greatly lowering the death toll. Thirty-eight of the 314 students, three teachers, the superintendent, the postmaster, and a local farmer assisting at the scene were killed. Most of the deceased were students from second to sixth grade. Fifty-eight others were injured.

==Geography==

<text>A European commissioner is a member of the 27-member European Commission. Each member within the Commission holds a specific portfolio. The commission is led by the president of the European Commission. In simple terms they are the equivalent of government ministers.

==Appointment==
Commissioners are nominated by member states in consultation with the commission president, who then selects a team of commissioners. This team of nominees are then subject to hearings at the European Parliament, which questions them and then votes on their suitability as a whole. If members of the team are found to be inappropriate, the president must then reshuffle the team or request a new candidate from the member state or risk the whole commission being voted down. As parliament cannot vote against individual commissioners there is usually a compromise whereby the worst candidates are removed but minor objections are put aside, or dealt with by adjusting portfolios, so the commission can take office. Once the team is approved by the parliament, it is formally put into office by the European Council ().

Although members of the commission are allocated between member states, they do not represent their states. Instead, they are supposed to act in European interests. Normally, a member state will nominate someone of the same political party as that which forms the current government. There are exceptions, such as Member of the Commission Richard Burke (of Fine Gael), who was nominated by Taoiseach Charles Haughey (of Fianna Fáil). In the past, when the larger states had two seats, they often went to the two major parties, such as in the United Kingdom.

Twelve of the current 27 members are women. The first female commissioners were Christiane Scrivener and Vasso Papandreou in the 1989 Delors Commission. Peter Mandelson (2004 to October 2008) was the first openly gay commissioner.

European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek proposed in 2010 that commissioners be directly elected, by member states placing their candidate at the top of their voting lists in European elections. That would give them individually, and the body as a whole, a democratic mandate.

===Oath===
Each member is required to take an oath before the Court of Justice of the European Union, officially the &quot;Solemn Declaration before the Court of Justice of the European Union&quot;. The Charter of Fundamental Rights gained legal force on 1 December 2009. Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding subsequently proposed that commissioners should swear to uphold it also. The second Barroso Commission went to the Court of Justice on 3 May 2010 for the first such oath alongside their usual oath. The oath taken by the members of the Barroso Commission was:

==History==
Until 2004, the larger member states (Spain upwards) nominated two commissioners and the smaller states nominated one. As the size of the body was increasing with enlargement, the larger states lost their second commissioner after the 2004 enlargement with the new Barroso Commission being appointed under the Treaty of Nice.

Nice also specified that once the number of members reached 27 then the number of commissioners should be reduced to &quot;less than the number of Member States&quot;. The exact number of commissioners would have to be decided by a unanimous vote of the European Council and membership would rotate equally between member states. Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007, this clause took effect for the following commission (appointed after the 2009 European elections).

The failed European Constitution first mandated that the number of commissioners should equal two-thirds of the member states. This could be changed by a vote in the European Council, in case the number was still too high in the future. The constitution failed ratification but this change was brought in with the Treaty of Lisbon. However, as Lisbon was being ratified the Irish electorate voted against it with one reason being the fear of losing a commissioner. The Irish then voted again, in favour of the treaty on a number of conditions; one being that they kept their commissioner.

In 2009, in what was known as the 26+1 formula, it was proposed that (in order to comply with the Nice Treaty provision that there should be fewer commissioners than members) instead of a commissioner one member state should fill the post of high representative. An idea floated in 2007 was the creation of junior members for smaller states. In 2004, there was a proposal to create a &quot;super-commissioner&quot; who would be vice president of the Commission and would &quot;be able to intervene in all decisions concerning EU projects that have an impact&quot; on the economic performance of the EU.

Another change Lisbon brought, as hinted above, was the creation of the role of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy by merging the post of European Commissioner for External Relations with the council&#x27;s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The new more powerful high representative became &quot;ex-officio&quot; Vice-President of the Commission and would chair the Council of the European Union when foreign ministers were meeting.

==Accountability==
In addition to its role in approving a new Commission, the European Parliament has the power at any time to force the entire Commission to resign through a vote of no confidence. This requires a vote that makes up at least two-thirds of those voting and a majority of the total membership of the Parliament. While it has never used this power, it threatened to use it against the Commission headed by Jacques Santer in 1999 over allegations of corruption. In response, the Santer Commission resigned &quot;en masse&quot; of its own accord, the only time a Commission has done so.

==Salaries==
A commissioner&#x27;s basic monthly salary is fixed at 112.5% of the top civil service grade. As of June 2023, this works out to be €25,910.19 per month. The president is paid at 138% (€27,436.90 per month), vice-presidents at 125% (€24,852.26 per month) and the High Representative at 130% (€25,846.35 per month). There are further allowances on top of these figures, including household allowance, child allowance, and a substantial expatriation allowance (where applicable).

==Portfolios==

The make-up and distribution of portfolios are determined by the Commission president and do not always correspond with the commission&#x27;s departments (directorates-general). While some have been fairly consistent in make-up between each Commission, some have only just been created or are paired with others. With a record number of members in 2007, the portfolios have become very thin even though the responsibilities of the commission have increased.

==Civil service==
A commissioner can come under a great deal of influence from the staff under their control. The European Civil Service is permanent whereas a commissioner is in office usually for just five years. Hence it is the service which know the workings of the commission and have longer term interests. Strong leadership from a commissioner, who knows the workings of their portfolio, can overcome the power of the service. An example would be Pascal Lamy; however, the best people are usually kept by their national governments, leading to less solid candidates getting the job.

==Politicisation==

Commissioners are required to remain above national politics while exercising their duties in the Commission During the Prodi Commission, Anna Diamantopoulou (Employment and Social Affairs) took leave from the commission to participate in the 2004 Greek elections and resigned when she won a seat despite her party losing. Romano Prodi campaigned in the 2001 Italian elections while still president.

Louis Michel (Development &amp; Humanitarian Aid) announced that he would go on unpaid leave to take part in the 2007 Belgian elections. Although he positioned himself so as not to be elected, the European Parliament&#x27;s development committee asked the Parliament&#x27;s legal service to assess if his participation violated the treaties. Michel claimed that politicisation of this manner is part of reconnecting the Union with its citizens. The Commission revised its code of conduct for commissioners allowing them to &quot;be active members of political parties or trade unions&quot;. To participate in an election campaign they are required to &quot;withdraw from the work of the Commission for the duration of the campaign&quot;.

This does throw their independence in doubt, where a politician leaves their national scene for one or two terms and returns to it for a new job. Most in essence owe their positions to nomination and support from national party leaders and parties they have been aligned to; usually seeking to return to the party-political fray.

Politicisation has even gone so far as commissioners backing national candidates, with Neelie Kroes (Competition) backing Angela Merkel in the 2005 German elections and Margot Wallström (Institutional Relations &amp; Communication Strategy) backing Ségolène Royal in the 2007 French elections. Wallström defended this, claiming that the EU has to get more political and controversial as being a vital role in communicating the commission. Wallström has been notable for engaging in debate and politics: she was the first commissioner to start her own blog .

However their political nature can also cause problems in their habit of leaving the job early in the final years of the commission to take up new national posts. In seeking to secure their post-Commission job, they can undermine the work of the commission. Following elections in Cyprus, Commissioner Kyprianou left to become Cypriot Foreign Minister. Likewise, Commissioner Frattini left to do the same following elections in Italy. During the previous Prodi Commission, Pedro Solbes left to become the Spanish finance minister, Michel Barnier left to become French foreign minister, Erkki Liikanen left to become head of the Bank of Finland and Anna Diamantopoulou also resigned early. Even President Prodi started campaigning in the Italian elections before his term as head of the commission was over.

Appointment to the commission has the effect of removing a political figure from a country for a period of years, and this has been compared to the ancient Athenian practice of ostracism.

Thierry Breton resigned as European Commissioner on 16 September 2024, accusing Ursula von der Leyen of undermining him and disrupting the EU’s power transition.

<text>Leszek Henryk Balcerowicz ( ; born 19 January 1947) is a Polish economist, statesman, and Professor at Warsaw School of Economics. He served as Chairman of the National Bank of Poland (2001–2007) and twice as Deputy Prime Minister of Poland (1989–1991, 1997–2001).

In 1989, he became Minister of Finance in Tadeusz Mazowiecki&#x27;s first non-communist government and led the free-market economic reforms, proponents of which say they have transformed Poland into one of Europe&#x27;s fastest growing economies, but which critics say were followed by a large increase in unemployment. In 2007, he founded the Civil Development Forum (Forum Obywatelskiego Rozwoju) think-tank and became the chairman of its council.

== Biography ==
In 1970 he graduated with distinction from the Foreign Trade faculty of the Central School of Planning and Statistics in Warsaw (currently: SGH Warsaw School of Economics). Balcerowicz received his MBA from St. John&#x27;s University in New York, in 1974 and doctorate from the Central School of Planning and Statistics in 1975.

He was a member of the Polish communist party (Polish United Workers&#x27; Party) from 1969 until the declaration of martial law in Poland, in 1981. In the late 1970s he participated in an economic-advisory team associated with the prime minister of People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. In 1978–1980 he worked at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism. Later he became an economics expert in the pro-democracy independent trade union Solidarity (NSZZ &quot;Solidarność&quot;).

From 1989 to 1991 and also between 1997 and 2000 he was the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Poland. Between 1995 and 2000 he was the chairman of Freedom Union, a centrist free-market political party. On 22 December 2000 he became the Chairman of the National Bank of Poland. He was also a columnist for &quot;Wprost&quot;, a Polish news magazine.

On 11 November 2005, the President of Poland, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, awarded L. Balcerowicz with the Order of the White Eagle for his &quot;contribution to Poland&#x27;s economic transformation&quot;. In 2006 he was elected member of &quot;Galeria Chwały Polskiej Ekonomii&quot;, a hall of fame for &quot;outstanding Polish economists&quot;.

Balcerowicz was a member of the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor, an independent initiative hosted by the UNDP and the first global initiative to focus specifically on the link between exclusion, poverty and the law. He is also a member of the influential Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty, and is a board member of renowned Washington, D.C. think-tank the Peterson Institute. Fellow of Collegium Invisibile.

Since 11 June 2008 Balcerowicz has been a member of the board of Bruegel, the Brussels-based think tank on international economics.

Since 2007, he has led the Civil Development Forum (Polish: &quot;Forum Obywatelskiego Rozwoju&quot;), a think-tank with a mission of &quot;increasing active support of the society for a wide range of individual freedoms (especially economic freedom), and – what goes with it – for strengthening the rule of law in the country&quot;.

In 2016, he was appointed as representative of the Ukrainian President in the Cabinet of ministers.

He is a recipient of the Chilean Order of Merit.

== Balcerowicz Plan ==

The Balcerowicz Plan was a series of reforms, which brought the end to hyperinflation, dismantled inefficient economic structures, and balanced the national budget. The prices of most consumer goods were freed and caps for annual increases established in state-sector employees&#x27; wages. Poland&#x27;s currency, the zloty, was made convertible within the country&#x27;s borders. This resulted in a substantial increase in prices and had forced state-owned companies while making them economically competitive. This amounted to a two-year shock to the Polish economy. Among other actions included in the plan was the negotiation of a significant reduction (approximately 50%) of the debts inherited from the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. In 1998, Balcerowicz was awarded the Euromoney Finance Minister of the Year Award for his accomplishments as a finance minister.

The severity of the reforms was controversial and made Balcerowicz an object of criticism by some politicians in Poland. The reforms impoverished and vanished economic opportunities of already struggling social groups such as low-educated, rural and low-income workers. This resulted in Poland becoming a deeply divided and polarized society. This led to the rise of populist movements that gained popularity through dissatisfaction with the reforms - this included the left-wing agrarian Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (which became known for its slogan &quot;Balcerowicz must go!&quot;), far-right League of Polish Families, and later Law and Justice. The plan was decried as &quot;economic genocide&quot; by the leader of Self-Defence, Andrzej Lepper. A slowly on-going rise in discontent continued into the 2000s, and in 2002, when asked about the Balcerowicz Plan, 78% of Poles described their economic situation as bad, and nearly 40% preferred to live in socialist Poland - amongst rural residents and skilled workers, this figure rose to 50%.

On the other hand, neoliberal economists and experts such as Krzysztof Sobczak, Jeffrey Sachs (who personally advised Balcerowicz), and Jacek Rostowski agree that without introducing such radical changes, Poland&#x27;s economic success and steady economic growth would not have been possible. Other economists and political scientists criticized the plan - Adam Przeworski described Balcerowicz Plan as a &quot;a pure trickle-down model of reforms&quot;, and argued that Balcerowicz neglected the social costs of the reform, focusing only on growth. The economic growth produced by the reforms did not trickle down to average citizen.

Polish economist Tadeusz Kowalik argues that Balcerowicz&#x27;s reforms were a failure, stating that the good economic performance of Poland in comparison to other post-communist Poland was caused by much better initial economic conditions. Kowalik accuses Balcerowicz of squandering a unique opportunity of creating a fair and egalitarian socio-economic system, instead creating a system &quot;whose trademarks became mass and permanent unemployment, for many years the highest in Central Europe and then the highest in the EU; one of the highest income disparities; the dismantling of the welfare state. Added to this was the breaking down of workers&#x27; negotiating power. The shock operation meant consenting to the introduction of the worst variety of capitalism into Poland.&quot;

Balcerowicz was also criticized by Polish economist and former Finance Minister Grzegorz Kołodko, who described Balcerowicz Plan as &quot;shock without therapy&quot;. Kołodko notes that Balcerowicz promised only a slight increase in unemployment and poverty, while in reality Polish GDP fell by 20% and rendered millions of Poles unemployed. According to Kołodko, &quot;Balcerowicz is praised only by people from the same camp as him - representatives of Polish neoliberalism&quot;. Kołodko notes the excessive scale of reductions in household incomes (including real wages), as after two months of the reforms, real wages in Poland fell by over 40%. He also adds that since the reforms resulted in the industrial production falling by over 30%, that cost alone makes the reform impossible to be regarded as successful, regardless the future stabilization. Lastly, Kołodko believes that Balcerowicz acted irrationally, as the plan did not manage to eliminate inefficient companies, but instead blindly discriminated against state-owned companies, denying them investment loans and granting them to private companies instead, regardless of their economic performance. Kołodko concludes that the Balcerowicz Plan was &quot;creative destruction&quot;.

==Criticism==
High unemployment remained a problem for some two decades after the implementation of the reforms, leaving certain poverty-stricken regions with structural unemployment. Reducing unprofitability of the state-owned companies required significant layoffs. Even though over 2 million Poles emigrated from Poland since its entry into the EU, until 2010s, the unemployment level remained at 13%. Populist politician Andrzej Lepper, the leader of the populist Self-Defense &quot;(Samoobrona)&quot; party, created the slogan: &quot;Balcerowicz must go&quot; (&quot;Balcerowicz musi odejść&quot;), echoing the disgruntlement felt by some Poles with Balcerowicz&#x27;s plan. However, since 2013, the unemployment rate has not exceeded 10% and in 2019 has reached the record low of 3.8%.

==The BELLS==
During the Eurozone crisis Balcerowicz has been an outspoken supporter for fiscal discipline and has been frequently dubbed the anti-Bernanke for his scorn of distortionary fiscal stimulus. In various articles he has developed a comparison between the fiscally-profligate PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain) and the fiscally-disciplined BELLs (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). Responsible fiscal policy brings about better growth outcomes, claims Leszek Balcerowicz. He has many followers among East European economists, most prominently Simeon Djankov, Deputy prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Bulgaria between 2009 and 2013.

==Private life==
Balcerowicz was a competitive athlete in his youth. In 1966, he became Poland&#x27;s youth champion in cross country at the distance of 1500 meters. Since 1977, he has been married to Ewa Balcerowicz, an economist. He has three children.

<text>Paul William Richards (born May 20, 1964 in Scranton, Pennsylvania) is an American engineer and a former NASA astronaut. He flew aboard one Space Shuttle mission in 2001.

==Education==
Richards graduated from Dunmore High School, Dunmore, Pennsylvania, in 1982. He received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from Drexel University, where he was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity in 1987. He was awarded a master of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1991.

Richards is a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, National Society of Professional Engineers, American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics, American Society of Naval Engineers, United States Naval Reserves.

==Early career==
Department of the Navy, Naval Ship Systems Engineering Station, 1983–1987. Transferred to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in 1987. Worked in the Verification Office, Electromechanical Branch, Robotics Branch, Guidance and Controls Branch, all within the Engineering Directorate. Senior EVA Tool Development Engineer for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Servicing Project. Project Manager for HST EVA crew aids and tools. Program Manager for HST EVA Hardware. Responsibilities included the budget, schedule, design, analysis, fabrication, test, and integration for breadboard, WETF/NBS, engineering, and flight hardware, documentation, and review process. Additional duties included systems engineering support for the HST WETF/NBS Servicing Mission Simulations as a utility diver and EMU suited subject. Richards is the inventor of the Pistol Grip Tool (PGT). The PGT is a self-contained, computer- controlled, battery-powered 3/8 inch drive power tool with a pistol-style handle. Numerous torque, speed and turn limits can be programmed into the tool for mission-specific applications. A light emitting diode display on the tool tells the astronaut what torque he or she is applying, at what speed, and how many turns the motor has made. It also displays error messages. The motorized torque ranges from 2 to 25 foot-pounds, the speed from 5 to 60 rotations per minute, and the number of turns from 0 to 999. In manual mode, the Pistol Grip Tool can apply 38 foot-pounds of torque. The specifications for every fastener are preprogrammed into the PGT before each mission and the PGT then logs the actual data during EVA. The PGT has been used on every NASA spacewalk (EVA), since 1996.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in April 1996, Richards reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. Having completed two years of training and evaluation, he was qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Richards was initially assigned to the Computer Branch working on software for the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. He next served in the Astronaut Office Shuttle Operations Branch assigned to support Payload and General Support Computers (PGSCs) and the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL). Richards flew on STS-102 and has logged over 307 hours in space, including 6.4 EVA hours. He was assigned as a back-up crew member for ISS Expedition-7. Richards retired from NASA in February 2002 to pursue private interests.

In 2004 Richards returned to NASA GSFC as the Observatory Manager for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R Series). The GOES-R series is the next-generation of advanced weather satellites being developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in partnership with NASA. In 2014, he was promoted to Deputy Project Manager for the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) Project. LCRD will
demonstrate the next-generation of satellite communication using laser technology. In 2018 Richards was detailed to NASA HQ as a Program Executive for NASA’s Satellite Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program. He retired from NASA in 2019.

===Spaceflights===
STS-102 &quot;Discovery&quot; (March 8–21, 2001) was the eighth Shuttle mission to visit the International Space Station. Mission accomplishments included the delivery of the Expedition-2 crew and the contents of the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, the return to Earth of the Expedition-1 crew, as well as the return of &quot;Leonardo&quot;, the reusable cargo carrier built by the Italian Space Agency. Richards performed an EVA totaling 6 hours and 21 minutes. Mission duration was 307 hours and 49 minutes.

<text>James Francis Reilly II (born March 18, 1954) is an American geologist, retired astronaut, and honorary United States Marshal who served as the 17th Director of the United States Geological Survey from 2018 to 2021. He flew on three Space Shuttle missions with the NASA Astronaut Corps: STS-89, STS-104 and STS-117.

==Early life and education==
Reilly was born at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, on March 18, 1954, though considers his hometown to be Mesquite, Texas. He graduated from Lake Highlands High School in Dallas, Texas in 1972. He has received three degrees in geosciences from the University of Texas at Dallas: a Bachelor of Science in 1977, a Master of Science 1987, and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1995.

==Career==

During graduate school, Reilly was selected to participate in the 1977–1978 scientific expedition to Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica, as a research scientist specializing in stable isotope geochronology. In 1979, he started work as an exploration geologist with Santa Fe Minerals, in Dallas. From 1980 to the time he was selected for the astronaut program, Reilly was employed as an oil and gas exploration geologist for Enserch Exploration, in Dallas, rising to the position of Chief Geologist of the Offshore Region. At the same time, he was involved in applying new imaging technology for industrial applications in deep water engineering projects and biological research. Reilly spent approximately 22 days in deep submergence vehicles operated by Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution and the U.S. Navy.

NASA selected Reilly for the astronaut program in December 1994. He reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995 and completed a year of training and evaluation, and qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Initially, he was assigned to work technical issues for the Astronaut Office Computer Support Branch. Reilly flew on STS-89 in 1998 and STS-104 in 2001. He has logged over 517 hours in space, including three spacewalks totaling 16 hours and 30 minutes. He has worked both on the ISS and Mir space stations. Reilly was next assigned as the Astronaut Office lead on Shuttle training. In 2007 was a member of the crew of STS-117. Concurrent with his crew assignment he is designated as Payloads and Procedures Operations lead for the Astronaut Office ISS Branch.

From January 2010 to May 2014, Reilly worked as the American Public University System&#x27;s Dean of the School of Science and Technology.

In January 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Reilly to be the director of the U.S. Geological Survey. The U.S. Senate confirmed him in April 2018.

After leaving government service in 2020, Reilly later joined defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton the following year as an executive adviser.

==Organizations==
Officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve. Member, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Naval Reserve Association, Tailhook Association, Reserve Officers Association, Association of Space Explorers.

==Special honors==
*US Navy ROTC scholarship, 1972
*Antarctic Service Medal, 1978
*Seventh Honorary U.S. Marshal, 2001

==Criticism==

After James Reilly was appointed by President Trump to lead the U.S. Geological Survey he then instructed his office to abandon the traditional practice of using climate models that stretch to the end of the century and instead to only use climate models projecting the impact of climate change through 2040. 

His statements on the National Climate Assessment focused on scientific uncertainties rather than directly stating concurrence with opinions expressed by some scientists.

<text>A postgraduate diploma (PgD, PgDip, PGDip, PG Dip., PGD, Dipl. PGD) is a postgraduate at the level of a master&#x27;s degree, awarded after a university degree, which supplements the original degree and awards them with a graduate diploma. The minimum requirement of completing a bachelor&#x27;s degree is necessary to start the postgraduate course. The duration of a postgraduate course can vary from 1 year to 2 years. 

Countries that award postgraduate diplomas include but are not limited to Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Spain, Kenya, South Africa, Sudan, India, Israel, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Republic of Panama the Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Pakistan, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago and Zimbabwe. Level of education and recognition differ per issuing country.

==Australia and New Zealand==

The Australian equivalent of a postgraduate diploma is called a Graduate Diploma (GDip or GradDip), situated at AQF (Australian Qualifications Framework) level eight. New Zealand universities offer postgraduate diplomas (PostGradDip). NZQA level of post graduate diploma is also eight. A postgraduate diploma (or Australian graduate diploma) indicates master&#x27;s-level studies; a Graduate Diploma is generally equivalent to the first year of a two-year master&#x27;s degree. Admission is typically based on past study such as via a university degree, although other factors can be taken into account.

== Bangladesh ==
In Bangladesh, both public and private sector institutions offer Postgraduate Diploma (PGD) programmes across various fields. In the public sector, Bangladesh Institute of Management (BIM) provides a range of Postgraduate Diploma courses, notably in Management, aimed at developing managerial skills for mid-career professionals. In the private sector, institutions like Bangladesh Institute of Management Studies (BiMS) offer Postgraduate Diplomas, with programmes designed to enhance practical and theoretical knowledge for professionals across disciplines.

==Canada==

In Canada, a postgraduate certificate program consists of two to three semesters, which can be completed in less than one year in some instances. A university&#x27;s degree or a master&#x27;s degree is required to be accepted in this type of program. It offers the advantage of not requiring to write a thesis and to focus on a concise subject. It is recommended for students wishing to enhance their professional skills as it concentrates on a more practical application in order to enter the labor market. Depending on the province, the title can vary: Post-Graduate Diploma, Graduate Diploma, Post-Graduate Certification, Post-Baccalaureate or D.E.S.S. (Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Diplômes d&#x27;études supérieures spécialisées&quot;). See links to the Canadian education system, as the various regions can be quite different.

==India==
In India, there are a number of institutes and universities offering postgraduate diploma programs (PG Diploma). These post-graduate diploma programs are mainly one-year programs that are divided into two to four semesters, depending on hands-on training, field work, and credit requirements. These are master&#x27;s level programs that only cover the essentials. These programs are mainly targeted to offer professional education and training to the candidates for the better employment opportunity and industry readiness. It is designed to provide in-depth exposure to concepts, scientific principles, implementation methodology of new approaches. Post-graduate diplomas in Management, Post-graduate diploma in Banking &amp; Finance, Remote Sensing &amp; GIS, Robotics, Industrial Maintenance Engineering and Advanced Manufacturing Technology, are examples of courses offered in India. Certain institutes provide postgraduate diploma programs which satisfies the credit requirement for a master&#x27;s program with increased number of lower credit courses for 2 years, these programs are provisionally considered equivalent to a master&#x27;s level. Postgraduate diploma programs are meant for those with a bachelor&#x27;s degree to gain an advanced technical grasp and to those with a master&#x27;s degree to enhance their interdisciplinary/translation grasp.

==Ireland==
Commonly referred to as PgD, the postgraduate diploma (Gaeilge: &quot;Dioplóma Iarchéime&quot;) has been awarded by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (also known as QQI, Quality Qualifications Ireland, Gaeilge: &quot;Dearbhú Cáilíochta agus Cáilíochtaí Éireann&quot;), since June 2005 in institutions associated with and accredited by the council. This postgraduate qualification is awarded for a wide range of programmes in the sciences, engineering, and humanities, among others. Entry requirement is a Level 8 Honours Degree in line with EQF standards, including Bachelor&#x27;s degree or vocational degrees, such as the &quot;Meister&quot; or &quot;Staatlich Geprüfter Betriebswirt&quot; in Germany. Most institutions operate under the Recognition of Prior Experiential Learning (RPEL) scheme meaning applicants who do not meet the normal academic requirements may be considered based on publications, relevant work or research experience, which will usually involve an assessment centre or interview process. In Ireland, the vast majority of postgraduate diplomas require the same duration and level of studies as a Master&#x27;s degree, namely EQF Level 9, yet additional coursework or an independent research project replace the thesis. While progression to doctoral study is only possible at selected universities in Ireland, the Irish postgraduate diploma is widely accepted for entry to EQF Level 8 doctoral degree&#x27;s in most countries.

==Portugal==

In Portugal a postgraduate diploma (in Portuguese &quot;Pós-graduação&quot;) can be awarded under two circumstances: 1) as part of an independent program of studies; 2) after the completion of the first year of study in a masters program.

==Singapore==
The postgraduate diploma is a postgraduate academic qualification taken after a bachelor&#x27;s degree. It is usually awarded by a university or a graduate school. It usually takes two or more study terms to complete, a wide variety of courses are offered. It is also possible for graduate diploma holders to progress to a master&#x27;s degree. Only postgraduate diplomas that are registered with the Ministry of Education (Singapore) are recognised by the industry.

==Spain==
The postgraduate diploma (PgDip) is awarded by a variety of Spain universities and follows the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) grading system.

For example, Pablo de Olavide University offers an English-language PgDip in the Integral Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Social Activists in cooperation with Protection International. The University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) offers an English-language PgDip in International Election Observation and Electoral Assistance, run in cooperation with many organisations in the field of election monitoring, such as The Carter Center, Electoral Reform International Services (ERIS), International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), National Democratic Institute (NDI), the Organization of American States (OAS) and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR).

==Sri Lanka==
In Sri Lanka, a postgraduate diploma is a postgraduate academic qualification taken after a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

==United Kingdom==

There is a vast number of postgraduate diplomas available in England and Wales. This could be a vocational course studied after an academic degree, such as the Legal Practice Course or the Bar Vocational Course; the resulting diplomas allow the student to enter legal training, relevant to either the solicitor or barrister professions, respectively. Postgraduate diplomas allow a graduate student to study a more advanced programme than at the bachelor&#x27;s level. It is contrasted with a graduate diploma, where a student studies a new academic subject at degree level, but in a short space of time, such as the Graduate Diploma in Law (also known as the Common Professional Exam), which allows a postgraduate student to study the seven foundation subjects of a three-year undergraduate law degree, in a period of nine months. The City and Guilds of London Institute awards a post graduate diploma 9210 in engineering subjects that are endorsed by the professional engineering institutions, and count toward qualifying as a Chartered Engineer.

In the U.K. a postgraduate diploma is a postgraduate qualification at the level of a master&#x27;s degree (level 7 of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, level 11 of the Framework for Qualification of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland). They are considered by the National Qualification Framework (NQF) to be at a comparable level to a master&#x27;s degree, however, they require fewer study credits to achieve (120 credits) when compared to a full master&#x27;s degree (180 credits). They are typically classified into Distinction, Merit, and Pass, similar to most master&#x27;s courses. Many schools of architecture commonly operate a 1 or 2-year postgraduate diploma course providing ARB part 3 education in this fashion.

A postgraduate diploma is commonly awarded to students who have completed the master&#x27;s programme and continuing a one-year advanced course similar to the first year of a PhD program.

A postgraduate diploma typically represents 120 credits of postgraduate courses (whereas a full master&#x27;s degree is usually 180 credits). Postgraduate diplomas are usually abbreviated as PGDip, PG Dip, PgD, PgDip, and, similar to a PgCert, diploma holders are permitted to use &#x27;PgDip&#x27; or &#x27;PgD&#x27; as a post-nominal, which is usually listed after all other academic degrees in ascending order, but before any professional qualifications.

==Nigeria==

In Nigeria PGD is used as a required supplement for students seeking to apply for another postgraduate program (e.g. PhD, master&#x27;s degree etc.) who have a Higher National Diploma (HND), other lower degrees, a degree in a course that is not connected to that which one seeks a postgraduate admission for, or graduated with very low score from a university.

<text>The View is an American far-left talk show created by broadcast journalist Barbara Walters. Currently in its 28th season, the show has aired on ABC as part of the network&#x27;s daytime programming block since August 11, 1997. It features a multi-generational panel of women, who discuss the day&#x27;s &quot;Hot Topics&quot;, such as sociopolitical and entertainment news. In addition to the conversation segments, the panel also conducts interviews with prominent figures, such as celebrities and politicians. Production of the show was held in ABC Television Studio 23 in New York City until 2014, when it relocated to the adjacent ABC Broadcast Center, where it stayed until September 2024, when production relocated to ABC Studio B, also in New York City.

Throughout its run, &quot;The View&quot; has had 24 permanent &quot;co-hosts&quot; of varying characteristics and ideologies, with the number of contracted permanent co-hosts ranging between four and eight women per season. The original panel comprised Walters, broadcast journalist Meredith Vieira, lawyer Star Jones, television host Debbie Matenopoulos, and comedian Joy Behar, while the current lineup consists of Behar, entertainer Whoopi Goldberg, lawyer Sunny Hostin, television host Sara Haines, television personality Ana Navarro, and political strategist Alyssa Farah Griffin. In addition, the show often makes use of male and female guest panelists.

&quot;The View&quot; has won Daytime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Talk Show, Outstanding Informative Talk Show, and Outstanding Talk Show Host. The show has received praise from the Associated Press, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, as well as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which deemed it &quot;the most important political TV show in America&quot;. Beginning in its tenth season, the series became subject to on-air controversies and media criticism involving its panel. It was transferred from the helm of ABC&#x27;s entertainment division to that of ABC News in 2014 following a decline in ratings. By 2021, &quot;The View&quot; had become the most-viewed news and talk program in daytime television.

==Format==
The original opening credits for &quot;The View&quot; featured a voice-over from the show&#x27;s creator and executive producer, broadcast journalist Barbara Walters, explaining the show&#x27;s premise as well as its co-hosts&#x27; credentials:
Walters described it as &quot;a talk show featuring four or five women &#x27;of different backgrounds, different generations, and different opinions,&#x27; who would discuss the topics of the day, mixing humor with intelligent debate.&quot; The show begins with a segment that features the panel engaging in a discussion pertaining to subjects ranging from politics to social issues as well as pop culture, commonly referred to as &quot;Hot Topics&quot;. Every episode features multiple &quot;Hot Topics&quot; segments, which take up to most–if not all–of the day&#x27;s show. The discussions are frequently followed by interviews with guests. The show also periodically conducts audience giveaways, which often accompanies deal-of-the-day presentations for the home audience under the branding of &quot;View Your Deal&quot;. Every broadcast concludes with the closing remarks: &quot;Have a great day, everyone, and take a little time to enjoy the view.&quot;

The 12th season of &quot;The View&quot; heavily focused on the events surrounding the 2008 United States presidential election and featured politicians John McCain, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama as guests. Its 13th season saw the introduction of male guest moderators; among them were television personality Tom Bergeron, actor D. L. Hughley, journalist Bryant Gumbel, and television host Joe Scarborough. Male personalities have since begun serving as guests more frequently, specifically on Fridays, dubbed &quot;Guy Day Friday&quot;. In 2013, the show was speculated to be &quot;trying to become less political.&quot; It began refocusing on politics leading to the 2016 United States presidential election and has reincorporated it back into &quot;Hot Topics&quot; discussions since. During the 25th season, the series introduced weekly episodes that each feature a former co-host as a guest, titled &quot;Flashback Fridays&quot;.

==Co-hosts==
===Timeline===
===Seasons 1–10 (1997–2007)===

&quot;The View&quot; premiered with four co-hosts: Meredith Vieira as moderator, Star Jones, Debbie Matenopoulos, and Barbara Walters. Joy Behar, who filled in as the fourth co-host when Walters was unavailable, soon became a full-time co-host. The five women were the first group that auditioned for the panel, with Behar describing them as having immediately clicked. Following Matenopoulos&#x27;s firing in December 1998, broadcast journalist Lisa Ling was brought on as a new co-host in 1999. Ling departed the show in December 2002 to host the series &quot;National Geographic Explorer&quot;. Former &quot;&quot; castaway Elisabeth Hasselbeck replaced Ling beginning November 24, 2003, after Hasselbeck, television personality Rachel Campos-Duffy, and actress Erin Hershey Presley each received a week-long on-air tryout.

In 2006, Vieira left the show to become co-anchor of the NBC morning program &quot;Today&quot;; her final episode aired on June 9. That same month, Jones also left the show. Her departure, originally scheduled for July, was brought forward by Walters, publicly feeling &quot;betrayed&quot; by Jones for unexpectedly announcing her departure two days ahead of schedule. She also said ABC executives had decided not to renew Jones&#x27;s contract due to diminished approval for Jones through their market research. Jones later claimed the decision to leave was not hers and that producers informed her that they would not be renewing her contract in April.

During the 33rd Daytime Emmy Awards in April 2006, entertainer Rosie O&#x27;Donnell was introduced as a co-host for the show&#x27;s tenth season; she made her debut on September 5. After a string of controversies O&#x27;Donnell left the show in April 2007 due to failed renewal negotiations. The following month, ABC stated that O&#x27;Donnell had asked to be let out of her contract three weeks before its expiration and that she had been granted permission to depart immediately.

===Seasons 11–18 (2007–2015)===

In August 2007, Walters replaced O&#x27;Donnell with actress Whoopi Goldberg for season 11. Goldberg debuted during the season premiere on September 4. Actress Sherri Shepherd joined as a permanent co-host beginning September 10. Hasselbeck went on maternity leave from October 2007 to January 2008 and again from August to October 2009, with rotating guest co-hosts filling in during the latter. In August 2009, Walters, Behar, Hasselbeck, Goldberg, and Shepherd won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host. Walters took a hiatus after undergoing open-heart surgery in May 2010 and returned on September 7 during the season 14 premiere broadcast.

In 2013, Behar left the series at the end of season 16. That same month, Hasselbeck was reported to be departing alongside Behar due to market research finding both of their views too &quot;polarizing&quot;, which Walters denied. Despite Walters&#x27; earlier denial, Hasselbeck indeed departed the show on July 10 to join the Fox News morning program &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;. Behar&#x27;s final episode, a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;-style tribute to her, aired on August 9. Actress Jenny McCarthy became a co-host the following season and debuted on its premiere broadcast on September 9.

Walters retired in on May 16, 2014. Shepherd and McCarthy departed the following month and made their final appearances on August 11.

After making guest appearances during the previous season, actress Rosie Perez as well as former White House Communications Director Nicolle Wallace permanently joined the series in its 18th season, establishing Perez as the series&#x27; first Latina co-host; the two debuted alongside O&#x27;Donnell, who permanently returned, and Goldberg during the season premiere on September 15, 2014. Perez took a hiatus at the end of the year to rehearse for her role in the play &quot;Fish in the Dark&quot; and returned on February 3, 2015. That same month, representatives for O&#x27;Donnell confirmed that she would once again exit the panel due to &quot;personal reasons&quot;; her final appearance aired on February 12. Actress Raven-Symoné joined the series full-time in June after frequently guest co-hosting, and the following month, comedian Michelle Collins, who had been a frequent guest, was permanently added for the following season. Perez and Wallace exited at the conclusion of the 18th season in August.

===Seasons 19–28 (2015–present)===

The 19th season saw the return of Behar as well as the addition of actress Candace Cameron Bure and broadcast journalist Paula Faris as co-hosts alongside Goldberg, Raven-Symoné, and Collins, the lattermost of whom departed in June 2016. The following season began with eight rotating co-hosts: Behar, Goldberg, Raven-Symoné, Bure, Faris, television host Sara Haines, lawyer Sunny Hostin, and television personality Jedediah Bila. Additionally, Behar began moderating on Fridays in Goldberg&#x27;s place. On October 27, Raven-Symoné left the show to star in a spin-off of the sitcom &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;. On December 8, Bure left the program, citing the commute between coasts and her commitments to other television projects as reasons; her final episode as co-host aired the following day.

While Goldberg initially considered leaving after season 20, she remained as moderator for season 21, with Behar, Faris, Haines, Hostin, and Bila all returning as co-hosts. On September 18, 2017, Bila exited the show on air. Television personality Meghan McCain subsequently joined the show after leaving her position at Fox News, debuting as co-host on October 9. After giving birth to a daughter in December 2017, Haines returned from maternity leave in March 2018. Faris departed in July. In the same month, Haines left the show to co-host ABC&#x27;s new third hour of its morning program &quot;Good Morning America&quot;; she made her final appearance during the season&#x27;s penultimate broadcast on August 2.

Broadcast journalist Abby Huntsman joined the panel in season 22, making her debut during the season premiere on September 4, 2018. Following an absence due to the death of her father, McCain returned on October 8. Television personality Ana Navarro joined the show as a weekly guest co-host the following month. Goldberg began a hiatus from co-hosting on February 7, 2019, due to pneumonia and sepsis, and returned on March 14. Huntsman took maternity leave beginning in May. Behar, Goldberg, Hostin, McCain, and Huntsman all returned for the 23rd season, which premiered on September 3. In January 2020, Huntsman departed to become a senior advisor to her father&#x27;s 2020 Utah gubernatorial election campaign; she made her final appearance as co-host on January 17.

Haines returned as a guest co-host beginning in March 2020 and permanently rejoined the panel for the 24th season. McCain gave birth to a daughter in September 2020 and returned in January 2021 after a three-month maternity leave. After four years on the series, McCain departed at the end of the 24th season. She attributed her decision to her desire to raise her daughter in Washington D.C., to which she had relocated. McCain later cited the &quot;toxic, direct and purposeful hostility&quot; she experienced at the show as the reason for her exit. In April 2022, Goldberg took an extended hiatus from co-hosting to film the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;Anansi Boys&quot;. Starting in season 26, Navarro, who has been a weekly guest co-host since 2018, and political strategist Alyssa Farah Griffin joined the show permanently. With the additions, the panel comprises six co-hosts.

==Production==
During its first 17 seasons, &quot;The View&quot; was filmed in ABC Television Studio 23 in New York City. The original set for the first four seasons was a leftover set from canceled soap opera &quot;The City&quot;. The panelists conduct discussions around a table or on a sofa and wear IFB earpieces through which producers communicate with them. Bill Geddie, Barbara Walters&#x27; longtime producing partner, and Mark Gentile respectively served as showrunner and director for 17 years. Walters remained an executive producer until her death.

&quot;The View&quot;″s 18th season brought significant changes in a &quot;creative overhaul&quot; as well as a &quot;new direction&quot; for the show. In August 2014, ABC named Bill Wolff, who had served as vice president of primetime programming at MSNBC and as executive producer of the news and opinion program &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;, the new executive producer, replacing Bill Geddie. Production of the show relocated to the ABC Broadcast Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. During the season premiere on September 15, 2014, the series unveiled its new studio featuring a coffee table-style desk with low-arm chairs, a large video wall, in-the-round audience seating, and an on-camera social media station. Subsequent tweaks included a glass desk and high stools at center stage, as well as color adjustments in backgrounds and graphics.

In October 2014, ABC shifted production oversight on &quot;The View&quot; from ABC&#x27;s daytime entertainment division to Lincoln Square Productions, an ABC News subsidiary, where the show will be grouped under the division&#x27;s non-fiction programming umbrella. The move allowed the show to leverage ABC News&#x27; resources toward news-related segments. In August 2015, former late-night talk show &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; producer Brian Teta joined the show as co-executive producer. Later in the month, executive producer Wolff departed the show. In February 2016, along with the show&#x27;s 20th season renewal, Candi Carter was promoted to executive producer after serving as interim showrunner for season 19, becoming the first African-American executive producer in the show&#x27;s history.

During the 20th-season premiere on September 6, 2016, the show debuted an updated set design with muted colors, retooled opening titles with footage of the co-hosts in a loft-like space, as well as a new theme song entitled &quot;World&#x27;s Gone Crazy&quot;, written by Diane Warren and performed by Mary J. Blige. Hilary Estey McLoughlin was named senior executive producer in January 2017 after she was brought on as a consultant for season 19. In September, Teta was promoted to executive producer ahead of the 21st-season premiere. Sarah de la O serves as director, as of September 2019. In March 2020, the series began airing without a live studio audience as a precaution in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Carter departed that same month to become the showrunner of the daytime talk show &quot;Tamron Hall&quot;. During the pandemic, the co-hosts broadcast from different locations, with Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg, Sunny Hostin, Meghan McCain, and Ana Navarro filming remotely, while Sara Haines remained in the studio, where Teta also still produced. McLoughlin exited in February 2021.

For the series&#x27; 25th season, which began in September 2021, the co-hosts returned to filming in front of a live studio audience for the first time since March 2020. The show also presented a new theme song entitled &quot;For My Girls&quot;, written by Warren and performed by Brandy Norwood and Nicole Scherzinger.

Season 28 relocated from the ABC Broadcast Center to a new facility; Disney constructed a new New York facility in the Hudson Square neighborhood, to succeed the ABC Broadcast Center and Times Square Studios. Season 28 premiered from the new facility&#x27;s &quot;Studio B&quot;, on September 3, 2024.

==Notable episodes==

In 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama appeared as a guest on the show during the July 29 broadcast, marking the first appearance on a daytime talk show by a sitting U.S. president. The episode also saw the return of Barbara Walters following her open heart surgery in May before she resumed her hiatus. On February 22, 2012, Star Jones came on as a guest and discussed her contentious exit from the show, marking her first appearance since said exit in 2006. On February 7, 2014, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell returned as a guest for the first time since quitting the show in 2007. All eleven co-hosts in the show&#x27;s history appeared during Walters&#x27; penultimate episode as co-host on May 15 to celebrate her retirement. Walters&#x27; final appearance as co-host aired the following day; it featured several guests, including Hillary Clinton and television host Oprah Winfrey.

On March 27, 2015, the show celebrated its 4,000th broadcast, with Walters and Joy Behar returning for the celebration. On September 5, 2016, prior to the premiere of Season 20, ABC aired a documentary entitled &quot;The View: 20 Years in the Making&quot;, which featured notable moments from the show and several personalities involved in its history, hosted by Behar. On November 8, Behar, Jedediah Bila, Candace Cameron Bure, Sara Haines, and Sunny Hostin hosted a primetime Election Night special of the show, which aired on Lifetime. On November 11, the series aired a &quot;Flashback Friday&quot; episode, which featured the original panel of co-hosts comprising Behar, Jones, Meredith Vieira, and Debbie Matenopoulos as well as a Veteran&#x27;s Day tribute.

In March 2017, the show had its first remote broadcast from Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Five episodes were filmed in front of the Tree of Life at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom, featuring pre-recorded segments with Behar, Bila, Haines, Hostin, Paula Faris, and Whoopi Goldberg exploring Epcot, Magic Kingdom, and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios. Film director James Cameron came on as a guest on March 9, giving a preview of the themed area Pandora – The World of &quot;Avatar&quot;. Other guests included Sherri Shepherd, Tom Bergeron, actresses Ariel Winter, Audra McDonald, and Mandy Moore, actors John Stamos and Eric Stonestreet, and chefs Masaharu Morimoto and Art Smith, with musical performances by singer Andy Grammer and rock band Train.

On August 11, 2017, ABC re-aired the first episode of &quot;The View&quot;, which originally aired on the same date 20 years prior. On November 7, 2019, the series celebrated the airing of its 5,000th episode, with Bill Geddie, businessman Donald Trump Jr., and television personality Kimberly Guilfoyle appearing as guests. The following month, singer Darlene Love performed her song &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; alongside singer Jason Derulo on the December 20 broadcast, which Love has done annually since 2015. On March 11, 2020, the series aired its first broadcast without a live studio audience since its debut due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On September 24, 2021, Hostin and Ana Navarro were removed from the show mid-broadcast due to testing positive for COVID-19 before a planned in-person interview with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. The rest of the episode saw Behar and Haines answering audience questions and Harris appearing from a separate room in the studio building via a video stream during the last ten minutes. Hostin and Navarro returned the following week and said further testing indicated the two had received false positive results.

On June 2, 2022, the show aired a taped segment of Behar, Matenopoulos, Jones, and Vieira reuniting to reminisce at Essex Hall, where the original auditions for co-hosts took place. On January 3, 2023, the show aired a tribute special for Walters following her death on December 30, 2022. Former co-hosts Matenopoulos, Shepherd, and Ling appeared live on the show with former co-hosts Jones and Hasselbeck appearing virtually and Vieira calling into the show. The series aired its 6,000th episode in July 2024.

===Controversies===

The show&#x27;s tenth season was embroiled in controversies, such as O&#x27;Donnell &quot;speaking in mock Chinese&quot; as well as her public feud with businessman and later U.S. president Donald Trump. On May 17, 2007, O&#x27;Donnell sparked accusations of &quot;equating American soldiers with terrorists&quot; in relation to the Iraq War by asking, &quot;655,000 Iraqi civilians are dead. Who are the terrorists?&quot; Following frequent debates involving O&#x27;Donnell and Elisabeth Hasselbeck, a confrontation ensued between the two on May 23 due to O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s issue with Hasselbeck&#x27;s lack of willingness to defend her right to criticize the war. O&#x27;Donnell also stated that the media would portray her as &quot;big, fat, lesbian, loud Rosie attacking innocent, pure, Christian Elisabeth&quot; and that Republican pundits were mischaracterizing her statements; Hasselbeck responded by telling O&#x27;Donnell to defend her own insinuations. O&#x27;Donnell exited the series two days later, three weeks earlier than scheduled. She later attributed her early exit to the use of a split screen during the confrontation.

During a discussion about the 89th Miss America pageant on September 14, 2015, Michelle Collins called contestant Kelley Johnson&#x27;s monologue about her occupation as a registered nurse &quot;hilarious&quot;, stating that Johnson &quot;read her emails out loud&quot;, while Behar referenced Johnson&#x27;s attire and questioned why she had on &quot;a doctor&#x27;s stethoscope&quot;. The remarks resulted in an immediate social media backlash from the nursing profession, including the hashtag #NursesUnite. Two days later, Collins and Behar addressed the controversy on air. Consequently, pharmaceutical corporation Johnson &amp; Johnson and egg company Eggland&#x27;s Best pulled their sponsorships from the series, later followed by food company McCormick &amp; Company, laundry brand Snuggle, and party store chain Party City.

On February 13, 2018, while analyzing television personality Omarosa&#x27;s comments in regards to U.S. Vice President Mike Pence&#x27;s religiosity, Behar stated: &quot;It&#x27;s one thing to talk to Jesus, it&#x27;s another thing when Jesus talks to you. That&#x27;s called mental illness, if I&#x27;m not correct, hearing voices.&quot; Content analysis organization Media Research Center subsequently launched a campaign demanding an apology from Behar and urging viewers to do the same, resulting in 40,000 calls to ABC as well as 6,000 complaints to the show&#x27;s advertisers. Pence himself responded and accused the show of expressing &quot;religious intolerance&quot;. The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger later stated that Behar has directly apologized to Pence. On March 13, Behar issued an apology on air and said: &quot;I think Vice President Pence is right; I was raised to respect everyone&#x27;s religious faith, and I fell short of that. I sincerely apologize for what I said.&quot;

In February 2022, president of ABC News Kim Godwin suspended Goldberg from the show for two weeks after she stated during an episode that the Holocaust was &quot;not about race&quot;.

==Other media==
In 2016, VH1 picked up &quot;Daytime Divas&quot;, a television series adaptation of Star Jones&#x27; book &quot;Satan&#x27;s Sisters&quot;, which revolves around a fictional daytime talk show named &quot;The Lunch Hour&quot; featuring five female co-hosts. Jones, who was also one of the series&#x27; executive producers, and then-&quot;View&quot; co-hosts Joy Behar, Jedediah Bila, Sara Haines, and Sunny Hostin all made guest appearances on the series. It was canceled in 2017 after one season.

In September 2018, &quot;The View&quot; began a podcast that saw the release of each episode in the show after its original televised broadcast. In September 2021, the series launched a companion podcast titled &quot;Behind the Table&quot;, which features conversations between former and current co-hosts. ABC began releasing episodes of &quot;Behind the Table&quot; daily in September 2023.

In April 2019, Thomas Dunne Books published a non-fiction book entitled &quot;Ladies Who Punch&quot; by journalist Ramin Setoodeh, which chronicles the entire history of the show. It features interviews with various current and former &quot;View&quot; co-hosts. The book is set to be adapted into a television miniseries.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
A &quot;New York Times&quot; review, published ten days after the show premiered, describes what critic Caryn James thought was distinctive about the show:
In a 2001 profile of Barbara Walters for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, James Wolcott called &quot;The View&quot; a &quot;genius bit of television.&quot; The following year, Virginia Heffernan of &quot;Slate&quot; complimented the chemistry between Walters, Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, and Joy Behar, writing that the women &quot;have eased completely into the stock sensibility of middle-aged talk shows, embracing the imperatives that one be healthy, careful, temperate, charitable, and moderately cutesy while at the same time skeptical, ribald, and world-weary.&quot; Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the show in 2007, writing that it &quot;does for daytime what &quot;The Daily Show&quot; does for nighttime: It reflects the pent-up frustrations, pleasures, and hostilities its audience has toward pop and political culture.&quot;

Despite being credited for helping the show achieve higher ratings, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell received criticism from &quot;viewers and interest groups&quot; that disagreed with her viewpoints. &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s Kevin O&#x27;Keefe deemed O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s hiring as moderator &quot;somewhat curious&quot; due to her being &quot;such an outspoken individual&quot;. Conversely, Helena Andrews of &quot;Politico&quot; praised O&#x27;Donnell for making the show &quot;actually watchable—something no longer relegated to the ether of TiVo or sneaked through head phones at work when we should be watching CNN.&quot; In 2014, Michael Schulman of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; highlighted O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s first tenure, elaborating that she &quot;pushed the limits of what cheery daytime chatter could sustain, and &quot;The View&quot; became more heated and more interesting as a result.&quot;

Jenny McCarthy&#x27;s appointment as a co-host attracted backlash due to her anti-vaccination views. Writing as a senior science editor for &quot;HuffPost&quot;, David Freeman referenced science communicator Bill Nye&#x27;s concern that McCarthy would &quot;encourage parents to prevent their kids from getting vaccinated&quot; as well has his hope that her views would be &quot;discredited.&quot; Alex Pareene of &quot;Salon&quot; criticized the decision, writing that McCarthy &quot;isn&#x27;t just quirky—she spreads lies that hurt people.&quot; Jill Filipovic remarked on &quot;The Guardian&quot; that McCarthy &quot;has no record of political activism or even serious engagement with the world&quot; other than her anti-vaccination stance. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Michael Specter asserted that ABC executives &quot;should be ashamed of themselves for offering McCarthy a regular platform on which she can peddle denialism and fear to the parents of young children who may have legitimate questions about vaccine safety&quot; and that her hiring was a &quot;strike against reason and progress and hope.&quot;

Following Walters&#x27; retirement, the show became known for constant changes in its lineup of co-hosts, including the brief tenures of O&#x27;Donnell, McCarthy, Rosie Perez, Nicolle Wallace, and Michelle Collins. In July 2015, Daniel D&#x27;Addario of &quot;Time&quot; suggested that it was time for ABC to end &quot;The View&quot;, citing the show&#x27;s inability to sustain a consistent panel as a factor. The following year, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;″s Lisa de Moraes wrote that the series was &quot;gaining a reputation as one of the riskier gigs for on-air talent.&quot;

In 2017, David Bauder of the Associated Press attributed the series&#x27; resurgence in viewership to its political discussions. &quot;HuffPost&quot;″s David Hinckley opined that &quot;The View&quot; has been successful in implementing its original premise and maintaining &quot;a balance in areas like ethnicity and ideology&quot; in regards to its co-hosts. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in May 2019, Amanda FitzSimons cited the fascination with the co-hosts as what sets the show apart from other entertainment and news programs and noted that it &quot;remains one of the few places on TV where audiences can watch authentic human drama.&quot; Lorraine Ali of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the series for being &quot;one of the few places left on TV where liberal, conservative and moderate voices pose questions that real folks might ask&quot; and generating &quot;raw moments that are as authentic as they are viral.&quot; In July 2021, &quot;Variety&quot; columnist Daniel D&#x27;Addario found that the show had lost its &quot;crackling electricity&quot; and that the co-hosts had &quot;veered into a place that wasn&#x27;t even good TV&quot; due to the limitations of taping remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===U.S. television ratings===
The tenth season of &quot;The View&quot; averaged 3.5 million viewers per episode, with the season premiere being the series&#x27; most watched at 4.4 million viewers.

<text>Mario Runco Jr. is a former United States Naval officer and NASA astronaut. He was selected as an astronaut with in 1987. He flew three Space Shuttle missions, performed a spacewalk on his second mission, and is now retired both from NASA and the U.S. Navy.

== Early life and education ==
Mario Runco, Jr. was born on January 26, 1952, in The Bronx, New York, to Mario and Filomena Ragusa Runco. Raised in the Highbridge neighborhood of The Bronx, his family moved to Yonkers, New York, in his early teen years. Runco graduated from Sacred Heart School, in the Bronx, NY in 1966 and Cardinal Hayes High School, the Bronx, NY in 1970. He earned a bachelor of science degree in meteorology and physical oceanography from the City College of New York in 1974 and a master of science degree in meteorology from Rutgers University in 1976. He played intercollegiate ice hockey on the City College of New York and Rutgers University teams.

== Special honors ==
He was awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, NASA Exceptional Service Medal, Navy Achievement Medal and Navy Pistol Expert Medal. He was also awarded three NASA Space Flight Medals (STS-44, STS-54 and STS-77), two Navy Sea Service Ribbons (USS NASSAU [LHA-4] and USNS CHAUVENET [T-AGS-29]), and the Navy Battle Efficiency Ribbon (USS NASSAU [LHA-4]). He received a Rotary National Space Achievement Stellar Team Award (2002) for his work on the International Space Station’s (ISS’s) Science Window and the Window Observational Research Facility (WORF), He was also the recipient of the City College of New York&#x27;s Townsend Harris Medal (1993), and the Cardinal Hayes High School Cardinal Francis Joseph Spellman Award (1993). As an undergraduate, he received the City College of New York Class of 1938 Athletic Service Award and is believed to be the first person of Italian origin to fly in space, being decorated accordingly by the president of Italy in 1999. He received an honorary doctor of science degree from the City College of New York in 1999. 

== Early career ==
Working at various positions even through his school years, Runco worked continuously from age nine until his retirement on December 31, 2017, eventually accumulating 57 years of continuous employment and almost 48 years of federal service with four different federal agencies (USPOD/USPS, USGS, USN, and NASA). After graduating from Rutgers University, he worked for a year as a research hydrologist conducting ground water surveys for the United States Geological Survey on Long Island, New York. In 1977, he joined the New Jersey State Police and, after completing training at the State Police Academy, he worked as a New Jersey State Trooper until he entered the United States Navy in June 1978. Upon completion of Navy Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island, in September 1978, he was commissioned and assigned to the Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Research Laboratory then known as the Naval Environmental Prediction Research Facility (NEPRF) in Monterey, California, as a research meteorologist. From April 1981 to December 1983, he served as the Meteorological Officer aboard the amphibious assault ship USS NASSAU [LHA-4]. It was during this tour of duty that he earned his designation as a Naval Surface Warfare Officer. From January 1984 to December 1985, he worked as a laboratory instructor at the Naval Postgraduate School, specifically the Geophysics Technical Readiness Laboratory, in Monterey, California. From December 1985 to December 1986, he served as Commanding Officer of Oceanographic Unit 4 embarked in the naval survey vessel USNS CHAUVENET [T-AGS-29], conducting hydrographic and oceanographic surveys of the Makassar and Sunda Straits and the Flores and Java Seas, Indonesia. His last assignment within the Navy before being assigned to NASA was as Fleet Environmental Services Officer at the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command&#x27;s Naval Western Meteorology and Oceanography Center, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. He joined NASA in 1987 and remained on active duty as a NASA astronaut until 1994 after which he continued his NASA career as a civilian astronaut until his retirement.

== NASA tenure ==
Selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in June 1987, Runco qualified for assignment as an astronaut mission specialist in August 1988. A veteran of three space flights (STS-44 in 1991, STS-54 in 1993, and STS-77 in 1996), Runco has logged over 551 hours in space which includes a 4.5 hour spacewalk during his STS-54 mission. His technical assignments included serving in Operations Development, where he assisted in the design, development and testing of the Space Shuttle crew escape system after the Challenger (Orbiter Vehicle {OV}-099) accident; in Mission Support, at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL, OV-095) as a SAIL Commander, performing test and evaluation of Space Shuttle mission-specific flight software; at the Kennedy Space Center, as an Astronaut Support Person (ASP or &quot;cape Crusader&quot;), where he assisted in preparing Space Shuttle missions for launch supporting missions STS-81, 82, 83, 84, 94, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, &amp; 91, and in the Johnson Space Center&#x27;s Mission Control Center as a Capsule (Spacecraft) Communicator (CAPCOM) supporting missions STS-60, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 92, 93, 96, 97, 98, 99, 101, 104, 105, 106, &amp; 109 as the Lead CAPCOM for the last Hubble Space Telescope repair mission. He was served as an Earth and planetary scientist and the lead for Spacecraft Window Optics and Utilization for the International Space Station&#x27;s (ISS&#x27;s) windows, including the U.S. Laboratory Destiny Module Nadir Science Window, the Window Observational Research Facility (WORF), and the ISS&#x27;s Cupola windows, all of which he helped design.

=== Spaceflight ===
==== STS-44 ====
On his first flight, Runco served as a Mission Specialist (MS-3) on the crew of STS-44 aboard the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS (OV-104) which launched from the Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s (KSC&#x27;s) launch pad 39A on the night of November 24, 1991. The primary mission objective was accomplished with the successful deployment of a Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite. In addition, the crew conducted two Military Man-in-Space Earth Observation experiments (M88-1, on which he was the lead, and Terra Scout), three radiation monitoring experiments, and numerous life sciences experiments in support of long duration space flights. STS-44 was originally scheduled as a 10-day mission; however, the oxygen loading for the mission was not sufficient to last 10 days due to the weight of the primary payload so the crew would need to drastically conserve power to be able to make the oxygen last through the full mission duration. The crew’s power conservation efforts paid off on flight day 6 when it appeared there finally was enough oxygen to last the rest of the mission; however, the mission was cut short as Minimum Duration Flight (MDF) when a second navigational Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was powered up for redundancy and immediately failed and (CAPCOM) and fellow classmate Jan Davis dejectedly called the Commander Fred Gregory with the bad news, &quot;“Fred, we’ve run out of ideas on IMU-2. We see problems both with the attitude and the velocity. We have declared IMU-2 failed.” ATLANTIS (OV-104) returned with only 2 of 3 IMU’s (#&#x27;s 1 and 3) operating to a contingency landing the next day on lakebed runway 05 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 1, 1991, completing 110 orbits of the Earth.

==== STS-54 ====

Even before launching for his first mission, Runco was assigned as a Mission Specialist (MS1) to his second flight, STS-54, which would fly on the Space Shuttle ENDEAVOUR (OV-105). STS-54 launched from KSC’s launch pad 39B launch pad 39B on January 13, 1993, and landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) runway 33 at KSC in Florida on January 19, 1993, completing 96 orbits of the Earth. The six-day mission’s primary objective was accomplished with his deployment of a NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-F) on flight day 1. Also carried in the payload bay was the Diffuse X-Ray Spectrometer (DXS). This astronomical instrument for studying stellar evolution scanned the local vicinity of our Milky Way galaxy and recorded the low-energy X-ray emanations believed to originate from the plasma remnants of an ancient supernova. Crewmate Greg Harbaugh (EV1) and Runco (EV2) also became the 47th and 48th Americans to walk in space during a 4.5-hour spacewalk designed to evaluate the limits of human performance during extravehicular activities (EVA) in anticipation of the construction of the ISS. Included in these EVA evaluations was the first and only attempt thus far at ingressing a personal foot restraint (PFR) without the use of handholds, which Runco accomplished successfully and is still the only person to have done so. Of Runco, his spacewalking crew mate commented, “Mario was the most naturally skilled EVA guy I ever saw. He moved with ease and was able to accomplish everything he was challenged to do. He ingressed the Personal Foot Restraint (PFR) without handholds, a task ground controllers were taking bets on as to whether it could be accomplished or not, look like he’d done it his whole life, and even did it a second time when disbelieving ground controllers asked him to do it again, which he did. Early in the EVA, he even caught a small tool case when it came loose after my tether hook failed to close (that’s my story and I’m sticking to it) as we were transferring the tool items we needed to take with us from the payload bay’s EVA tool box or Personnel Support Assembly (PSA) to our portable mini-work stations. Mario had large strong hands, which are a huge asset for EVA, and he was a hockey player so he had tremendous endurance. I find it curious that he never got a chance to display his skills on HST or ISS.” Lastly, in what was called the &quot;Physics of Toys In Space&quot;, which has since become a popular children&#x27;s educational video, the crew also demonstrated how everyday toys behave in space to an interactive audience of elementary school students across the United States. Mission duration was 5 days, 23 hours and 38 minutes.

==== STS-77 ====
On his last mission he served as a Mission Specialist (MS-3) on the crew of STS-77 aboard the Space Shuttle ENDEAVOUR (OV-105). Launching from KSC’s launch pad 39B on May 19, 1996, STS-77 carried a number of technology development experiments as well as a suite of microgravity science experiments. STS-77 also featured the fourth flight of a SpaceHab module, in this case a double module, as an experiment laboratory carried in ENDEAVOUR’s payload bay. The technology development experiments included two deployable satellites both of which were deployed by Runco. For the deploy of the Shuttle Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for Astronomy (SPARTAN)-207/Inflatable Antenna Experiment Runco was the Remote Manipulator System (Robotic Arm) operator. The other deployable was a small Satellite Test Unit (STU) which was designed to use the drag from the rarified atmosphere present in low Earth orbit and the Earth’s magnetic field for attitude control and stabilization. His foresight in having high resolution and low light level photography equipment and a high intensity spotlight added to the mission’s suite of photography equipment and insisting that a second overhead window rather than a blank be installed in the second of the twin SpaceHab modules, salvaged this experiment when its laser Attitude Measuring System (AMS), also installed in the payload bay, failed shortly after deploy of the satellite. He used these assets and his photographic expertise to capture video of the STU as Endeavour tracked and flew astern of it for several days. Principal investigators were able to use the video retrieved by Runco in lieu of the AMS data to complete their evaluations. A clip from this video of the STU have even been posted on the internet as proof of the existence of UFO’s. He also captured some additional &quot;Physics of Toys&quot; scenes for a sequel to the original STS-54 educational video and subsequently made several appearances on the children’s television show Sesame Street (Episodes 3696**, 3698, 3731, 3776, and 3785) in 1998 for the “Slimey to the Moon” series during Season 29 (1997-98). STS-77 landed at KSC’s SLF runway 33 on May 29, 1996, completing 161 orbits of the Earth. Mission duration was 10 days and 39 minutes.

=== Post-spaceflight ===
Upon leaving the astronaut office, Runco became the JSC lead for spacecraft window optics and utilization endeavouring to have optical quality windows installed in the ISS and all future spacecraft. As such, he assisted with the design of the ISS’s U.S. Laboratory Destiny Module Nadir Science Window and Cupola Windows. He also was a key designer of the WORF installed over the Destiny science window and was a co-principal investigator on the University of North Dakota’s ISS Agricultural Camera (ISS AgCam/ISSAC), which operated from the WORF. In addition, he helped with the design and facilitated the integration of several other WORF payloads including EarthKAM, IMAX for the filming of Toni Myers’ last film, “A Beautiful Planet&quot;, Nanoracks, ISS SERVIR Environmental Research and Visualization System (I-SERV), and Chiba University’s (Japan) “Meteor” observation study.

==Personal life==
Runco married the former Susan Kay Friess of Sylvania, Ohio. They have two children. He is also a former New Jersey state trooper and USGS research hydrologist.

<text>The Los Angeles Westside is an urban region in western Los Angeles County, California, United States. It has no official definition, but sources like &quot;LA Weekly&quot; and the Mapping L.A. survey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; place the region on the western side of the Los Angeles Basin south of the Santa Monica Mountains.

==Geography==
===&quot;LA Weekly&quot;===

According to the &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, there are different perspectives on where the Westside ends and the Eastside begins. Generally, the Westside is the area south of the Santa Monica Mountains and Sepulveda Pass, and west of either:

* Downtown Los Angeles – a historic definition supported by UCLA urban and cultural historian Eric Avila. Most of the number streets and big boulevards get a “west” before their names west of Main Street and an east if they are “east” of Main Street.
* The 110 Freeway
* La Cienega Boulevard
* The 405 Freeway

===Mapping L.A. boundaries===

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; readers submitted more than 300 maps, with borders ranging from Lincoln to La Brea and beyond. The most common east/west dividing lines were: Downtown, La Cienega Boulevard (the most common street cited), and the 405 freeway (the most common answer).

The &quot;Times&quot; analyzed the results and no one definition approached a majority. Ultimately, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Mapping Project settled on a definition comprising , encompassing not only districts in the city of Los Angeles but also two unincorporated neighborhoods, plus the cities of Beverly Hills, Culver City, and Santa Monica, but excluding all of the city of West Hollywood – even areas west of La Cienega Boulevard.

==Neighborhoods and districts==

According to the Mapping L.A. survey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; the Westside includes all of the below neighborhoods that are part of the city of Los Angeles:
*Bel Air
*Beverly Crest
*Beverlywood
*Beverly Grove
*Brentwood
*Century City
*Del Rey
*Cheviot Hills
*Mar Vista
*Marina Peninsula
*Pacific Palisades
*La Cienega Heights
*Palms
*Pico-Robertson
*Playa Vista
*Rancho Park
*Sawtelle
*Venice
*West Los Angeles
*Westwood
===Other cities===

*Beverly Hills
*Culver City
*Malibu
*Santa Monica

===Unincorporated areas===
*Ladera Heights
*Marina del Rey
*Alsace

==Population==
In the 2000 census, the Westside (as defined by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Mapping Project) had a population of 529,427. In 2000, non-Hispanic whites made up 63% of the population. The areas within the city of Los Angeles that &quot;Los Angeles Almanac&quot; recognized as part of the Westside had a population of 413,351.

==Education==
Fifty-three percent of West Los Angeles residents aged 25 and older had earned a 4-year degree (or higher) by 2000, according to Census Bureau figures quoted by the &quot;Los Angeles Times.&quot; They included 89,620 people with master&#x27;s degrees or higher and 117,695 with bachelor&#x27;s degrees. In addition, 95,187 people in that age range had some college experience. There were 46,823 with high school diplomas but 40,451 who had dropped out before graduating. As of 2019, the median income of the neighborhood was about $96,300.

The Westside is home to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), a public research university in the Westwood neighborhood. It is the second-oldest of the ten campuses of the University of California system. UCLA is considered a flagship campus of the University of California system, along with UC Berkeley. It offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a wide range of disciplines. With an approximate enrollment of 28,000 undergraduate and 12,000 graduate students, UCLA is the university with the largest enrollment in the state of California and the most popular university in the United States by number of applicants.

Other post-secondary schools in the Westside are as follows:
*Otis College of Art and Design
*Santa Monica College, first opened in 1929 as Santa Monica Junior College. Current enrollment is over 30,000 students in more than 90 fields of study.
*West Los Angeles College, which offers associate degrees, vocationally oriented programs and transfer programs to four-year universities.

<text>Winston Elliott &quot;Win&quot; Scott (born August 6, 1950) is a retired United States Navy Captain and former NASA astronaut. He served as a mission specialist on STS-72 in 1996 and STS-87 in 1997 logged a total of 24 days, 14 hours and 34 minutes in space, including three spacewalks totaling 19 hours and 26 minutes. Often known by his nickname of &quot;Win&quot;, he was also a Naval Aviator and initially flew helicopters and later transitioned to fighter aircraft.

==Education==
Scott attended George Washington Carver Senior High School until integration occurred in Dade County Schools. He entered Coral Gables Senior High School, from which he graduated in 1968. He was a member of the Coral Gables High band and is remembered as one of the school&#x27;s best trumpet players. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music from Florida State University in 1972, where he joined Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1980.

==Experience==
Scott entered Naval Aviation via Aviation Officer Candidate School after graduating from Florida State University in December 1972. He completed flight training in fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and was designated a Naval Aviator in August 1974. He then served a four-year tour of duty with Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 33 (HSL-33) at the Naval Air Station North Island, California, flying the SH-2F Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopter.

In 1978 Scott was selected to attend the Naval Postgraduate School at Monterey, California, where he earned his master of science degree in aeronautical engineering with an emphasis in avionics.

After completing jet training in the TA-4J Skyhawk, Scott served a tour of duty with Fighter Squadron 84 (VF-84) at NAS Oceana, Virginia, flying the F-14 Tomcat. In June 1986 he was designated an Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer (AEDO). He then served as a production test pilot at Naval Aviation Depot Jacksonville at NAS Jacksonville, Florida, flying the F/A-18 Hornet and the A-7 Corsair II aircraft. He was also assigned as Director of the Product Support (engineering) Department. He was next assigned as the Deputy Director of the Tactical Aircraft Systems Department at the Naval Air Development Center at Warminster, Pennsylvania. As a research and development project pilot, he flew the F-14, F/A-18 and A-7 aircraft.

Scott has accumulated more than 5,000 hours of flight time in 20 different military and civilian aircraft, and more than 200 shipboard landings.

Additionally, Scott was an associate instructor of electrical engineering at Florida A&amp;M University and Florida Community College at Jacksonville. He currently serves as the Vice President of Florida Institute of Technology.

==NASA career==
Scott was selected by NASA in April 1992, and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He served as a mission specialist on STS-72 in 1996 and STS-87 in 1997, and logged a total of 24 days, 14 hours and 34 minutes in space, including three spacewalks totaling 19 hours and 26 minutes.

Scott retired from NASA and the U.S. Navy at the end of September 1999 to accept a position at his alma mater, Florida State University, as Vice President for Student Affairs. He then served as Executive Director of the Florida Space Authority. His responsibilities included the development of space-related industry and economic initiatives. He represented the State of Florida&#x27;s interests in the development of space policies and programs and advised the governor and lieutenant governor on all civil, commercial and military space matters. Scott urged then-Governor Jeb Bush to combine the three state space organizations; the Florida Space Authority, the Florida Aerospace Finance Corp and the Florida Space Research Institute, into a single organization. The combination became what is now Space Florida. 

Scott subsequently served as the dean of the College of Aeronautics and senior vice president for External Relations and Economic Development at the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, FL. Scott is semi-retired and of this writing serves as the senior advisor to the president of the university.

==Spaceflight experience==
STS-72 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (January 11, 1996 – January 20, 1996) was a nine-day flight during which the crew retrieved the Space Flyer Unit satellite (launched from Japan 10-months earlier), deployed and retrieved the OAST-Flyer satellite, and conducted two spacewalks to demonstrate and evaluate techniques to be used in the assembly of the International Space Station. The mission was accomplished in 142 orbits of the Earth and traveled 3.7 million miles. Scott logged a total of 214 hours and 41 seconds in space on the mission, including his first EVA of 6 hours and 53 minutes.

STS-87 &quot;Columbia&quot; (November 19, 1997 – December 5, 1997) was the fourth US microgravity payload flight, and focused on experiments designed to study how the weightless environment of space affects various physical processes, and on observations of the Sun&#x27;s outer atmospheric layers. Scott performed two spacewalks; the first, a 7-hour 43 minute EVA, featured the manual capture of a Spartan satellite, in addition to testing EVA tools and procedures for future Space Station assembly. The second spacewalk lasted five hours and also featured space station assembly tests. Testing of the AERCam Sprint was conducted during his EVA. The mission was accomplished in 252 Earth orbits, traveling 6.5 million miles in 376 hours and 34 minutes.

Scott has written a book about his experiences in space, &quot;Reflections From Earth Orbit&quot;, published by Apogee Books.

==Organizations==
Scott belongs to the American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics, National Naval Officers Association, Naval Helicopter Association, Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity, Shotokan Karate Association, Association of International Tohgi Karate-Do, and Bronze Eagles Association of Texas.

In 2007, he received an honorary degree from Michigan State University for his work in space, which is regarded as a case study in leadership and expert communications. He also spoke at the 2007 commencements at Michigan State, encouraging students to believe in themselves and follow their dreams.

==Personal life==
Scott was born August 6, 1950, in Miami (Coconut Grove), Florida. He is married to the former Marilyn K. Robinson; they have two children, one of whom has followed in his footsteps as a Naval Aviator and currently serves as the commander of Carrier Air Wing Two. Scott enjoys martial arts and holds a second-degree black belt in Shotokan karate. He also enjoys music, and plays trumpet with a Houston-based big band. In addition to flying general aviation aircraft, he is an electronics hobbyist.

<doc id="656329" wikidata="Q906862" url="?curid=656329" title="Pseudo-Geber">
<text>Pseudo-Geber (or &quot;Latin pseudo-Geber&quot;) is the presumed author or group of authors responsible for a corpus of pseudepigraphic alchemical writings dating to the late 13th and early 14th centuries. These writings were falsely attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan (died 816, latinized as Geber), an early alchemist of the Islamic Golden Age.

The most important work of the Latin pseudo-Geber corpus is the  (&quot;The Height of the Perfection of Mastery&quot;), which was likely written slightly before 1310. Its actual author has been tentatively identified as Paul of Taranto. The work was influential in the domain of alchemy and metallurgy in late medieval Europe. The work contains experimental demonstrations of the corpuscular nature of matter that were still being used by seventeenth-century chemists such as Daniel Sennert, who in turn influenced Robert Boyle. The work is among the first to describe nitric acid, aqua regia, and aqua fortis.

The existence of Jabir ibn Hayyan as a historical figure is itself in question, and most of the numerous Arabic works attributed to him are, themselves, pseudepigrapha dating to c. 850–950. It is common practice among historians of alchemy to refer to the earlier body of Islamic alchemy texts as the or Jabirian Corpus, and to the later, 13th to 14th century Latin corpus as pseudo-Geber or Latin pseudo-Geber, a term introduced by Marcellin Berthelot. The &quot;pseudo-Geber problem&quot; is the question of a possible relation between the two corpora. This question has long been controversially discussed. It is now mostly thought that at least parts of the Latin pseudo-Geber works are based on earlier Islamic authors such as Abu Bakr al-Razi (c. 865–925).

==Corpus==
The following set of books is called the &quot;pseudo-Geber Corpus&quot; (or the &quot;Latin Geber Corpus&quot;). 
The works were first edited in the 16th century, but had been in circulation in manuscript form for roughly 200 years beforehand. 
The stated author is &quot;Geber&quot; or &quot;Geber Arabs&quot; (Geber the Arab), and it is stated in some copies that the translator is &quot;Rodogerus Hispalensis&quot; (Roger of Hispania).
The works attributed to Geber include:
* (&quot;The Height of the Perfection of Mastery&quot;).
* (&quot;Book of Furnaces&quot;),
* (&quot;On the Investigation of Perfection&quot;), and
* (&quot;On the Discovery of Truth&quot;).

Being the clearest expression of alchemical theory and laboratory directions available until then—in a field where mysticism, secrecy, and obscurity were the usual rule—pseudo-Geber&#x27;s books were widely read and influential among European alchemists.

The in particular was one of the most widely read alchemy books in western Europe in the late medieval period. 
Its author assumed that all metals are composed of unified sulfur and mercury corpuscles and gave detailed descriptions of metallic properties in those terms. 
The use of an elixir for transmuting base metals into gold is explained (see philosopher&#x27;s stone) and a lengthy defense is given defending alchemy against the charge that transmutation of metals was impossible.

The practical directions for laboratory procedures were so clear that it is obvious the author was familiar with many chemical operations. It contains early recipes for producing mineral acids. It was not equaled in chemistry until the 16th century writings of chemist Vannoccio Biringuccio, mineralogist Georgius Agricola and assayer Lazarus Ercker.

The next three books on the list above are shorter and are, to a substantial degree, condensations of the material in the .

Two further works, and , are &quot;absolutely spurious, being of a later date [than the other four]&quot;, as Marcellin Berthelot put it, and they are usually not included as part of the pseudo-Geber corpus. 
Their author is not the same as the others, but it is not certain that the first four have the same author either.

==Authorship==
Arabic alchemy was held in high esteem by 13th century European alchemists, and the author adopted the name of an illustrious predecessor, as was usual practice at the time. 
The authorship of Geber (Jabir ibn Hayyan) was first questioned in the late 19th century by the studies of Kopp, Hoefer, Berthelot, and Lippmann. The corpus is clearly influenced by medieval Islamic writers (especially by Abu Bakr al-Razi, and to a lesser extent, the eponymous Jabir). 
The identity of the author remains uncertain. 
He may have lived in Italy or Spain, or both. Some books in the Geber corpus may have been written by authors that post-date the author of the , as most of the other books in the corpus are largely recapitulations of the . Crosland (1962) refers to Geber as &quot;a Latin author&quot; while still emphasizing the identity of the author being &quot;still in dispute&quot;.
William R. Newman has argued that the author of the may have been Paul of Taranto, a tentative identification which is often accepted as likely.

The estimated date for the first four books is 1310, and they could not date from much before that because no reference to the is found anywhere in the world before or during the 13th century. For example, there is no mention in the 13th century writings of Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon.

The degree of dependence of the corpus from actual Islamic sources is somewhat disputed:
Brown (1920) asserted that the pseudo-Geber Corpus contained &quot;new and original facts&quot; not known from Islamic alchemy, specifically mention of 
nitric acid, , oil of vitriol and silver nitrate. Already in the 1920s, Eric John Holmyard criticized the claim of pseudo-Geber being &quot;new and original&quot; compared to medieval Islamic alchemy, arguing for direct derivation from Islamic authors. 
Holmyard later argued that the then-recent discovery of Jabir&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Seventy&quot; diminished the weight of the argument of there being &quot;no Arabic originals&quot; corresponding to pseudo-Geber, 
By 1957, Holmyard was willing to admit that &quot;the general style of the works is too clear and systematic to find a close parallel in any of the known writings of the Jabirian corpus&quot; and that they seemed to be &quot;the product of an occidental rather than an oriental mind&quot; while still asserting that the author must have been able to read Arabic and most likely worked in Moorish Spain.

With Brown (1920), Karpenko and Norris (2002) still assert that the first documented occurrence of is in pseudo-Geber&#x27;s . By contrast, Ahmad Y. Al-Hassan (2005) claimed that Islamic texts dated to before the 13th century, including the works of Jabir and Abu Bakr al-Razi, did in fact contain detailed descriptions of substances such as nitric acid, , vitriol, and various nitrates,
and Al-Hassan in 2009 argued that the pseudo-Gerber Corpus was a direct translation of a work originally written in Arabic, pointing to a number of Arabic Jabirian manuscripts which already contain much of the theories and practices that Berthelot previously attributed to the Latin corpus.

<doc id="656335" wikidata="Q1371840" url="?curid=656335" title="Richard A. Searfoss">
<text>Richard Alan &quot;Rick&quot; Searfoss (June 5, 1956 – September 29, 2018) was an American aviator who was United States Air Force colonel, NASA astronaut and test pilot.

==Early life==
Searfoss was born on June 5, 1956, in Mount Clemens, Michigan, but had considered Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to be his hometown. Growing up, he became an Eagle Scout.

After graduating from Portsmouth Senior High School, Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1974, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the United States Air Force Academy in 1978, and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautics from the California Institute of Technology on a National Science Foundation Fellowship in 1979. In the Air Force, he attended Squadron Officer School, Air Command and Staff College, and Air War College.

==Air Force service==
Searfoss graduated in 1980 from Undergraduate Pilot Training at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. From 1981 to 1984, he flew the F-111F operationally at RAF Lakenheath, England, followed by a tour at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, where he was an F-111A instructor pilot and weapons officer until 1987. In 1988 he attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, Patuxent River, Maryland, as a USAF exchange officer. He was a flight instructor at the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, when selected for the astronaut program.

He has logged over 6,000 hours flying time in 77 different types of aircraft and over 939 hours in space. He also holds FAA Airline Transport Pilot, glider, and flight instructor ratings.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in January 1990, Searfoss became an astronaut in July 1991. Initially assigned to the Astronaut Office Mission Support Branch, Searfoss was part of a team responsible for crew ingress/strap-in prior to launch and crew egress after landing. He was subsequently assigned to flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL). Additionally, he served as the Astronaut Office representative for both flight crew procedures and Shuttle computer software development. He also served as the Astronaut Office Vehicle System and Operations Branch Chief, leading a team of several astronauts and support engineers working on Space Shuttle and International Space Station systems development, rendezvous and landing/rollout operations, and advanced projects initiatives.

Searfoss served as STS-58 pilot on the seven-person life science research mission aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, launching from the Kennedy Space Center on October 18, 1993, and landing at Edwards Air Force Base on November 1, 1993. The crew performed neurovestibular, cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and musculoskeletal medical experiments on themselves and 48 rats, expanding our knowledge of human and animal physiology both on earth and in space flight. In addition, the crew performed 16 engineering tests aboard the Orbiter Columbia and 20 Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project experiments. The mission was accomplished in 225 orbits of the Earth.

Searfoss flew his second mission as pilot of STS-76 aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis, which launched at night on March 22, 1996. During this 9-day mission the STS-76 crew performed the third docking of an American spacecraft with the Russian space station Mir. In support of a joint U.S./Russian program, the crew transported to Mir nearly two tons of water, food, supplies, and scientific equipment, as well as U.S. Astronaut Shannon Lucid to begin her six-month stay in space. STS-76 included the first-ever spacewalk on a combined Space Shuttle-Space Station complex. The flight crew also conducted scientific investigations, including European Space Agency sponsored biology experiments, the Kidsat earth observations project, and several engineering flight tests. Completed in 145 orbits, STS-76 landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 31, 1996.

Searfoss commanded a seven-person crew on the STS-90 Neurolab mission which launched on April 17, 1998. During the 16-day Spacelab flight the crew served as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. STS-90 was the last and most complex of the twenty-five Spacelab missions NASA has flown. Neurolab&#x27;s scientific results will have broad applicability both in preparing for future long duration human space missions and in clinical applications on Earth. Completed in 256 orbits, STS-90 landed at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on May 3, 1998.

A veteran of three space flights, Searfoss logged over 39 days in space. He retired from the Air Force and left NASA in 1998. He became a commercial transport pilot for Southwest Airlines for a brief period and then returned to the space program by serving as the chief of safety for United Space Alliance at Kennedy Space Center. For the next few years, he continued to work as a contract research test pilot at NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center. For the year and a half immediately prior to his death, he was a T-38 instructor pilot at Edwards Air Force Base.

== Civilian space ==
After leaving NASA, Searfoss served as a judge for the Ansari X-Prize, where he officially declared SpaceShipOne to have won the competition on October 4, 2004, after completing two flights within a two-week period.

Searfoss was a test pilot instructor at the National Test Pilot School at the Mojave Spaceport.

In 2008, he was a featured guest in a Volkswagen commercial, where he argued with a black Beetle about who has more engineers between Volkswagen and NASA.

From the mid-2000s until the company closed, Searfoss worked with XCOR Aerospace in the development of their rocket-powered aircraft. , he was Chief Test Pilot at XCOR. He flew the flight tests and envelope expansion of the EZ-Rocket. He also served as XCOR&#x27;s only test pilot for a rocket-powered prototype racing aircraft. He made a total of 52 rocket-powered flights and was the world&#x27;s only tri-qualified rocket pilot (Space Shuttle, EZ Rocket, Rocket Racer prototype).

* working Remote Manipulator System (RMS) issues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch
* supporting Orbiter software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL)
* Chief of Astronaut Appearances
* Science Support Group Lead
* Space Station integration team
* Astronaut Representative to the Space Station Science and Utilization Advisory Board (primarily an external board for NASA).

From November 1994 to March 1995, Sega was the NASA Director of Operations, Star City, Russia (The Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center) responsible for managing NASA activities at Star City. These activities involved building an organization and infrastructure to support astronaut and cosmonaut mission and science training for flight on the Russian Space Station Mir. He also participated in training on Russian Space Systems and was the first American to train in the Russian EVA suit (Orlan) in their underwater facility (Hydrolaboratory). A veteran of two space flights (STS-60 in 1994 and STS-76 in 1996), Sega logged over 420 hours in space.

====Space flight experience====

STS-60 was the first joint United States/Russian Space Shuttle mission. Launched on February 3, 1994, STS-60 was the second flight of the Space Habitation Module-2 (Spacehab-2), and the first flight of the Wake Shield Facility (WSF-1). During the 8-day flight, the crew of &quot;Discovery&quot; conducted a wide variety of biological, materials science, earth observation, and life science experiments. Sega was the flight engineer for ascent and entry on this mission, performed several experiments on orbit, and operated the robotic arm, berthing the Wake Shield onto its payload bay carrier on four separate occasions. Following 130 orbits of the Earth in 3,439,705 miles, STS-60 landed at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 11, 1994. With the completion of his first space flight, Sega logged 8 days, 7 hours, 9 minutes in space.
STS-76, the third docking mission to the Russian space station Mir, launched at night on March 22, 1996, with a crew of six aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Following rendezvous and docking with Mir, a NASA astronaut transferred to Mir for a five-month stay to begin a continuous presence of U.S. astronauts aboard Mir for the next two years. Sega was the payload commander for this mission and lead on Biorack, a small multipurpose laboratory located in the Spacehab module carried in the Shuttle payload bay. Biorack was used to technology development, fundamental biology (research into plant and animal cellular function), and environment characterization. He was responsible for planning and on-orbit operations, including extensive transfer of logistics and science, including 4800 pounds of science and mission hardware, food, water and air to Mir, and returning over 1100 pounds of U.S. and ESA science and Russian hardware. Following 144 orbits of the Earth, &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed with a crew of five at Edwards Air Force Base in California on March 31, 1996. Mission duration was 9 days, 5 hours, 15 minutes.

===Post-NASA career===
Sega left NASA on July 1, 1996, to become Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. In 2001, he became acting Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Programs.

Sega served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, from August 2001 through August 2005.

The Defense Research and Engineering was made by Paul Wolfowitz the key compliance officer regarding, among others, the protection of human subjects in DoD supported research.

In the same period, he also served as the Reserve Assistant to the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff JCS. According to the Senate Armed Services Committee Report of the Inquiry into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody, The Joint Chiefs were involved in the approval of the controversial interrogation program both the DoD and the CIA engaged.

In January 2004, during Sega&#x27;s tenure as director, a DoD-wide review of human subjects protection policies was initiated by Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&amp;E).

On November 14, 2006, A Navy presentation at a DoD Training Day said the review found the Navy &quot;not in full compliance with Federal policies on human subjects protection.&quot; It was pointed out that the Navy had &quot;no single point of accountability for human subject protections.&quot;

In 2005 he became Under Secretary of the Air Force, thus serving as Department of Defense Executive Agent and Milestone Decision Authority for Space.
Starting in 2007, he worked at the Colorado State University, where Sega has &quot;served as Vice President of Energy and the Environment for the Colorado State University Research Foundation, a private, non-profit advocacy organization for the university, and as the Woodward Professor of Systems Engineering in the College of Engineering&quot;. 
In September 2010, Colorado State University and The Ohio State University collaborated to create a shared position called the Vice President and Enterprise Executive for Energy and the Environment. In this position, Sega &quot;will help the institutions work together to identify and lead potential national initiatives and economic development opportunities and will also look for opportunities for collaboration between the universities.&quot;

<text>Wanda at Large is an American sitcom starring Wanda Sykes; Sykes also created the series alongside Bruce Helford, Les Firestein, and Lance Crouther. The series aired for two seasons on Fox from March 26 to November 7, 2003.

==Synopsis==
Sykes starred as Wanda Hawkins, a former government worker who decides to become a stand-up comedian. Through her friend Keith (Dale Godboldo), Wanda is tapped by WHDC-TV head Roger to become a new editorial correspondent for the low-rated political talk show &quot;The Beltway Gang&quot; . She is immediately seen as unprofessional and inexperienced by the show&#x27;s moderators, Bradley (Phil Morris) and Rita (Ann Magnuson), whose conservative politics clash with Wanda&#x27;s liberal views. At home, she must deal with her sister-in-law Jenny (Tammy Lauren), a widow raising Wanda&#x27;s niece Holly (Jurnee Smollett) and nephew Barris (Robert Bailey Jr.), whom Wanda finds irritating. As the show progresses, Wanda begins to bond with her family and win over her colleagues, with some hinted attraction to Bradley.

==Cast==
* Wanda Sykes as Wanda Hawkins
* Dale Godboldo as Keith Townsend
* Phil Morris as Bradley Grimes
* Tammy Lauren as Jenny Hawkins
* Jurnee Smollett as Holly Hawkins
* Robert Bailey Jr. as Barris Hawkins

===Recurring===
* Jason Kravitz as Roger
* Ann Magnuson as Rita Bahlberg

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (2003)===
===Season 2 (2003)===
&quot;Note&quot;: The unaired second-season episodes were aired for the first time on TV One on July 4, 2006, during the 4th of July launch marathon of the series.

==Production and cancellation==

Fox premiered it on March 26, 2003. Fox renewed the show for a second season. The show returned with new episodes in September 2003, but in the so-called Friday night death slot at 8:00pm. It was canceled on November 7, along with the new Fox comedy series &quot;Luis&quot;.

During an interview with the &quot;Urbanite&quot; magazine at Georgia State University, Sykes explained that the show was only supposed to be on Friday night for an interim basis. According to Sykes, &quot;We were told if the new night didn&#x27;t work out, we would be moved to another timeslot. But, that&#x27;s part of the game television execs play.&quot; She also admitted in a January 2004 interview that she wished that the series would have launched on UPN instead of Fox.

==Broadcast and syndication==
Reruns began airing regularly on July 5, 2006 on American cable channel TV One. A marathon aired on July 4 as part of the channel&#x27;s &quot;Power to the People&quot; July 4 weekend celebration.

In 2022, the series is made available for streaming online on Fox Corporation&#x27;s Tubi.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
&quot;Wanda at Large&quot; premiered on Fox on March 26, 2003, following &quot;American Idol&quot;. It gradually decreased in the ratings, premiering with 14.3 million viewers, and diminishing to 10 million by the season finale. It still averaged 12.2 million for the six-episode season, however, making it the fourth highest-rated show on Fox that year out of 26, and leading Fox to renew the show. In September, the show returned with new episodes in the Friday night death slot at 8:30pm.

<doc id="656350" wikidata="Q1063060" url="?curid=656350" title="XLink">
<text>XML Linking Language, or XLink, is an XML markup language and W3C specification that provides methods for creating internal and external links within XML documents, and associating metadata with those links.

==The XLink specification==
XLink 1.1 is a W3C recommendation and the successor of XLink 1.0, which was also a W3C recommendation.

==Linking with XLink==
XLink defines a set of attributes that may be added to elements of other XML namespaces. XLink provides two kinds of hyperlinking for use in XML documents. Simple links connect only two resources, similar to HTML links. Extended links can link an arbitrary number of resources.

===Simple links===
A simple link creates a unidirectional hyperlink from one element to another via a URI. Example:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;document xmlns=&quot;http://example.org/xmlns/2002/document&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;
 &lt;heading id=&quot;someHeading&quot;&gt;Some Document&lt;/heading&gt;
 &lt;para&gt;Here is &lt;anchor xlink:type=&quot;simple&quot; xlink:href=&quot;#someHeading&quot;&gt;a link&lt;/anchor&gt; to the header.&lt;/para&gt;
 &lt;para&gt;It is an anchor that points to the element with the id &quot;someHeading&quot; on the current page.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/document&gt;

===Extended links===
Extended links allow multiple resources, either remote or local, to be connected by multiple arcs. An arc is information about the origin, destination and behavior of a link between two resources. The origin and destination resources are defined by labels. By using one or more arcs, an extended link can achieve specific sets of connections between multiple resources.

For example, if all resources in an extended link were given the label A, then an arc within that link declaring codice_1 would form connections between all resources.

Extended links do not need to be contained in the same document as the elements they link to. This makes it possible to associate metadata or other supplementary information with resources without editing those resources.

XLink also supports richer information about link types and the roles of each resource in an arc.

==Support for XLink==

===Within other specifications===

====SVG====
Hypertext links in Scalable Vector Graphics can currently be defined as simple XLinks. The working draft of SVG 1.2 proposes using extended XLinks as well. In the SVG 2 specification, XLink was deprecated in favor of non-namespaced equivalent attributes.

====RDDL====
The Resource Directory Description Language, an extension to XHTML Basic that is used to describe XML Namespaces, uses simple XLinks.

====XBRL====
The eXtensible Business Reporting Language has used simple and extended XLinks since the XBRL 2.0 specification was published in 2001. Most large XBRL taxonomies contain extensive linkbases. As of 2009, XBRL is probably the most extensive use of XLink in production systems.

====METS====
The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard, supported and maintained by the Library of Congress for describing file aggregations, uses simple XLinks in pointing to file locations as well as linkbases which describe relationships among external files (though these restrict codice_2 and codice_3 attributes to type IDREF instead of NMTOKEN).

====GML====
Geography Markup Language uses simple XLinks to implement referencing. In particular, GML uses xlink:href to support a graph model for geospatial information. GML&#x27;s graph model is essentially the same as RDF, on which early versions of GML were based. The GML specification constrains the semantics of XLinks to be essentially the same as rdf:resource (from the RDF/XML syntax) i.e. the referent can logically be placed in-line and the data is still valid.

===Implementations===

====Mozilla Firefox====
Mozilla Firefox has supported simple XLinks since version 1.5, but only for SVG and MathML documents. It is unsupported in other XML documents. Only the codice_4, codice_5, codice_6 and codice_7 attributes are supported.

====Prince====
Prince supports simple XLinks.

<text>There are 19 [[Municipalities of Switzerland|municipalities]] in the [[Canton of Uri]] in Switzerland.
== Mergers of municipalities ==
The 19 municipalities of the Canton of Uri were mentioned in the cantonal constitution and any merger had to be approved by a cantonal referendum that would change the constitution accordingly. A referendum in 2013 approved with 57%, the removal of the names of the 19 municipalities from the constitution, thus allowing municipalities&#x27; mergers without the need of a cantonal referendum. The municipalities of Seedorf and Bauen were the first that voluntarily decided to merge. The merger took place on 1 January 2021, after approval by the population of both municipalities in a referendum in October 2019; the population of both Seedorf and Bauen voted in favor of the merger with 80% and 69% respectively

Recipient of the Victor A. Prather Award in 1985 for performance during an EVA.

==Experience==
After graduation from West Point in 1967, Spring served two tours of duty in Vietnam. The first was from 1968 to 1969 with the 101st Airborne Division. The second tour, 1970–1971, came immediately after flight school, where he served as a helicopter pilot with the 1st Cavalry Division. Upon return, he received fixed wing training en route to a master&#x27;s degree program with the University of Arizona in 1974. After a short tour at Edwards Air Force Base, California as a flight test engineer, he attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. He then returned to the army&#x27;s Flight Test Facility at Edwards AFB to complete four years as an experimental test pilot.

He has military and civilian experience in 25 types of airplanes and helicopters and has logged more than 3,500 hours flying time—including over 1,500 hours in jet aircraft.

==NASA career==
Spring was selected as an astronaut in May 1980. His technical assignments have included software verification at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory and Flight Simulation Laboratory; vehicle and satellite integration at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, for STS-5, 6, 7, 8, and 9; Astronaut Office EVA (Extra-vehicular activity) expert; and Space Station construction, EVA maintenance, and design. Spring served as a mission specialist on STS-61-B which flew November 26, 1985, through December 3, 1985. During that mission, he was responsible for launching three communications satellites and performed two EVAs. During the EVAs, which totaled more than 12 hours, Spring investigated Space Station construction techniques, large structure manipulation while on the end of the remote arm, and a time and motion study for comparison between Earth training and space performance, with the EASE/ACCESS experiment. With the completion of STS-61-B, he has logged a total of 165 hours in space. After the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; accident, Spring participated in the Kennedy Space Center Tiger Team for accident investigation, then led the Astronaut Office EVA (Extra Vehicle Activity) program until 1988.

==Post-NASA career==
Following his retirement from NASA in August 1988, Spring spent the next five years directing the Army Space Program Office in Washington, D.C. He retired from the army in July 1994, and worked as a contractor on Defense and Intelligence programs in the Washington, D.C. area. He is currently a professor at the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) and lives in San Diego, California.

<doc id="656355" wikidata="Q286672" url="?curid=656355" title="ABBA (album)">
<text>ABBA is the third studio album by the Swedish pop group ABBA. It was originally released on 21 April 1975 through Polar Music and featured the hits &quot;SOS&quot;, &quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do&quot; and &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;.

== Overview ==
Following the Eurovision success of &quot;Waterloo&quot;, &quot;ABBA&quot; saw the band gaining worldwide recognition. &quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do&quot; topped the charts in Australia, as did &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; shortly after. &quot;SOS&quot; and &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; became hits in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The album saw ABBA dabble with reggae on &quot;Tropical Loveland&quot; and includes a grand, pseudo-classical keyboard instrumental in the traditions of Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman with &quot;Intermezzo No. 1&quot; (early working title: &quot;Mama&quot;).

&quot;ABBA&quot; was first released on CD in Japan in 1986 by Polydor Records. This release contains a slightly different mix of &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; not found on any subsequent CD pressing and thus is highly sought after by collectors. &quot;ABBA&quot; was released on CD throughout Europe in 1987 also by Polydor, with five songs added from the &quot;Waterloo&quot; and &quot;Ring Ring&quot; albums, which were not available on CD until 1990. &quot;ABBA&quot; was released on CD in Sweden by Polar Music in 1988, featuring the original 11 tracks only. The album has been reissued in digitally remastered form several times: in 1997 as part of &quot;The ABBA Remasters&quot; series with two bonus tracks, in 2001 with updated cover artwork incorporating their ambigram, first used for their next album &quot;Arrival&quot;, in 2005 as part of &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set, and most recently in 2012 as a &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot;. 

On the original UK cassette release of the album, &quot;Bang-A-Boomerang&quot; was split in two parts, being faded during the second verse at the end of side one and continued at the beginning of side two.

On 19 November 2012, &quot;ABBA&quot; was reissued as part of the Deluxe Edition series with a 2-disc package. The first disc, a CD with special remastered audio, featured the original album with three bonus tracks. The second one, a DVD, contained 60 minutes of previously unreleased TV performances, including: the complete 41-minute &quot;ABBA In Australia&quot; 1976 television special, in which the band performed twelve songs; performances of &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;, &quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do&quot;, and &quot;So Long&quot; from the SVT 1975 special &quot;Made In Sweden – For Export&quot;; a 1975 performance of &quot;SOS&quot; from the &quot;Seaside Special&quot;; a 1976 performance of &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; from &quot;Top of the&quot; &quot;Pops&quot;; two television commercials for &quot;The Best of ABBA&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;; and the &quot;International Sleeve Gallery&quot;. A 24-page illustrated booklet with an essay on the making of the album was also included.

Jude Rogers of the BBC said that, with this deluxe reissue of the album, &quot;ABBA doubters will be pleasantly surprised to find the band&#x27;s desire to experiment here&quot; and that &quot;long-term fans will enjoy the accompanying DVD, and be reminded of an interesting juncture in the quartet&#x27;s career&quot;.

<text>Desjardins () was a regional county municipality in the Chaudière-Appalaches region of Quebec, Canada. It and Les Chutes-de-la-Chaudière Regional County Municipality were formed from the division of Lévis County in the 1980s. Desjardins ceased to exist when most of it, along with most of Les Chutes-de-la-Chaudière RCM, amalgamated into the expanded city of Lévis on January 1, 2002.

==Subdivisions==
Desjardins RCM consisted of:
* Lévis (in its pre-amalgamation borders)
* Pintendre
* Saint-Henri
* Saint-Joseph-de-Lévy

==Dissolution==
When Desjardins RCM was dissolved, nearly all of its components amalgamated into the newly expanded Lévis:

* Lévis, Pintendre, Saint-Joseph-de-Lévy amalgamated into the newly expanded Lévis and comprised the Desjardins borough of that city.
* Saint-Henri remained independent and joined Bellechasse Regional County Municipality.

<text>Robert Clyde Springer (born May 21, 1942) is a retired American astronaut and test pilot who flew as a mission specialist on two NASA Space Shuttle missions in 1989 and 1990. A decorated aviator in the United States Marine Corps, Springer also flew more than 500 combat sorties during the Vietnam War. He has logged over 237 hours in space and 4,500 hours flying time, including 3,500 hours in jet aircraft.

==Pre-spaceflight experience==
Springer was born May 21, 1942, in St. Louis, Missouri. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second-highest rank, Life Scout. He graduated from Ashland High School in Ashland, Ohio in 1960. He received a commission in the U.S. Marine Corps following his 1964 graduation from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland with a Bachelor of Science degree in Naval Science. Springer attended The Basic School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia before reporting to the Naval Air Training Command for flight training at Pensacola, Florida and Beeville, Texas.

Upon receiving his aviator wings in August 1966, he was assigned to VMFA-513 at the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina. There Springer flew F-4 Phantom II fighters. He was subsequently assigned to VMFA-115 at Chu Lai in South Vietnam, where he completed 300 F-4 combat missions. In June 1968, Springer served as an advisor to the South Korean Marine Corps units in Vietnam and flew 250 combat missions in O-1 Bird Dogs and UH-1 Iroquois &quot;Huey&quot; helicopters.

Springer returned to the United States to attend the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, receiving a Master of Science degree in Operations Research and Systems Analysis in 1971. In March 1971 he was assigned to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at MCAS El Toro, California, where he became Wing operations analysis officer.

He flew UH-1Es in 1972 while with HML-267 at Camp Pendleton, California and then went to Okinawa in Japan to fly UH-1Es with HML-367, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. Springer flew F-4 Phantom II fighters as an aircraft maintenance officer with VMFA-451 in Beaufort, South Carolina and also attended what was then called Navy Fighter Weapons School (&quot;TOPGUN&quot;).

A 1975 graduate of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, he served as Head of the Ordnance Systems branch and as a test pilot for more than 20 different types of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. In this capacity, he performed the first flights in the AH-1T helicopter. He graduated from the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia in 1978, and was assigned to Headquarters Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic, where he assumed responsibility for joint operational planning for Marine Forces in NATO and the Middle East. He was serving as aide-de-camp for the Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic, when advised of his selection by NASA in May 1980.

==NASA experience==
Springer became an astronaut in August 1981. His technical assignments included support crew for STS-3, concept development studies for the Space Operations Center, and the coordination of various aspects of the final development of the Remote Manipulator System (&quot;Canadarm&quot;) for operational use. He worked at Mission Control in the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center as the CAPCOM for seven flights between 1984 and 1985.

Springer was responsible for Astronaut Office coordination of Design Requirements Reviews and Design Certification Reviews. These review efforts encompassed the total recertification and reverification of the Shuttle prior to STS-26 return to flight status. He flew as a mission specialist on STS-29 in 1989, and STS-38 in 1990.

Springer retired from NASA and the U.S. Marine Corps in December 1990.

===STS-29===
Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; (March 13–18, 1989) was launched from Kennedy Space Center. During 80 orbits of the Earth on this highly successful five-day mission, the crew deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, and performed numerous secondary experiments, including a Space Station &quot;heat pipe&quot; radiator experiment, two student experiments, a protein crystal growth experiment, and a chromosome and plant cell division experiment. In addition, the crew took over 4,000 photographs of the Earth using several types of cameras, including the IMAX 70 mm movie camera. Mission duration was 119 hours and concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

===STS-38===
Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; (November 15–20, 1990) was launched at night from Kennedy Space Center. During the five-day mission the crew conducted Department of Defense operations. After 80 orbits of the Earth, &quot;Atlantis&quot; and her crew landed back at the Kennedy Space Center, in the first Shuttle recovery in Florida since 1985.

==Awards and honors==
Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star, Air Medal (21st award), Navy Commendation Medal (2nd award), Navy Achievement Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, NASA Space Flight Medal, Presidential Unit Citation, Navy Unit Citation, and various Vietnam Campaign ribbons and service awards.
