<text>The transverse Mercator map projection (TM, TMP) is an adaptation of the standard Mercator projection. The transverse version is widely used in national and international mapping systems around the world, including the Universal Transverse Mercator. When paired with a suitable geodetic datum, the transverse Mercator delivers high accuracy in zones less than a few degrees in east-west extent.

==Standard and transverse aspects==

The transverse Mercator projection is the transverse aspect of the standard (or &quot;Normal&quot;) Mercator projection. They share the same underlying mathematical construction and consequently the transverse Mercator inherits many traits from the normal Mercator:
* Both projections are cylindrical: for the normal Mercator, the axis of the cylinder coincides with the polar axis and the line of tangency with the equator. For the transverse Mercator, the axis of the cylinder lies in the equatorial plane, and the line of tangency is any chosen meridian, thereby designated the &quot;central meridian&quot;.
* Both projections may be modified to secant forms, which means the scale has been reduced so that the cylinder slices through the model globe.
* Both exist in spherical and ellipsoidal versions.
* Both projections are conformal, so that the point scale is independent of direction and &quot;local&quot; shapes are well preserved;
* Both projections have constant scale on the line of tangency (the equator for the normal Mercator and the central meridian for the transverse).

Since the central meridian of the transverse Mercator can be chosen at will, it may be used to construct highly accurate maps (of narrow width) anywhere on the globe. The secant, ellipsoidal form of the transverse Mercator is the most widely applied of all projections for accurate large-scale maps.

==Spherical transverse Mercator==
In constructing a map on any projection, a sphere is normally chosen to model the Earth when the extent of the mapped region exceeds a few hundred kilometers in length in both dimensions. For maps of smaller regions, an ellipsoidal model must be chosen if greater accuracy is required; see next section. The spherical form of the transverse Mercator projection was one of the seven new projections presented, in 1772, by Johann Heinrich Lambert. (The text is also available in a modern English translation.) Lambert did not name his projections; the name &quot;transverse Mercator&quot; dates from the second half of the nineteenth century. The principal properties of the transverse projection are here presented in comparison with the properties of the normal projection.

===Normal and transverse spherical projections===

==Ellipsoidal transverse Mercator==
The ellipsoidal form of the transverse Mercator projection was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1822 and further analysed by Johann Heinrich Louis Krüger in 1912.

The projection is known by several names: the &quot;(ellipsoidal) transverse Mercator&quot; in the US; Gauss conformal or Gauss–Krüger in Europe; or Gauss–Krüger transverse Mercator more generally. 
Other than just a synonym for the ellipsoidal transverse Mercator map projection, the term Gauss–Krüger may be used in other slightly different ways:
* Sometimes, the term is used for a particular computational method for transverse Mercator: that is, how to convert between latitude/longitude and projected coordinates. There is no simple closed formula to do so when the earth is modelled as an ellipsoid. But the &quot;Gauss–Krüger&quot; method gives the same results as other methods, at least if you are sufficiently near the central meridian: less than 100 degrees of longitude, say. Further away, some methods become inaccurate.
* The term is also used for a particular set of transverse Mercator projections used in narrow zones in Europe and South America, at least in Germany, Turkey, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Argentina. This &quot;Gauss–Krüger&quot; system is similar to the universal transverse Mercator system, but the central meridians of the Gauss–Krüger zones are only 3° apart, as opposed to 6° in UTM.

The projection is conformal with a constant scale on the central meridian. (There are other conformal generalisations of the transverse Mercator from the sphere to the ellipsoid but only Gauss-Krüger has a constant scale on the central meridian.) Throughout the twentieth century the Gauss–Krüger transverse Mercator was adopted, in one form or another, by many nations (and international bodies); in addition it provides the basis for the Universal Transverse Mercator series of projections. The Gauss–Krüger projection is now the most widely used projection in accurate large-scale mapping.

The projection, as developed by Gauss and Krüger, was expressed in terms of low order power series which were assumed to diverge in the east-west direction, exactly as in the spherical version. This was proved to be untrue by British cartographer E. H. Thompson, whose unpublished exact (closed form) version of the projection, reported by Laurence Patrick Lee in 1976, showed that the ellipsoidal projection is finite (below). This is the most striking difference between the spherical and ellipsoidal versions of the transverse Mercator projection: Gauss–Krüger gives a reasonable projection of the &quot;whole&quot; ellipsoid to the plane, although its principal application is to accurate large-scale mapping &quot;close&quot; to the central meridian.

===Features===
*Near the central meridian (Greenwich in the above example) the projection has low distortion and the shapes of Africa, western Europe, the British Isles, Greenland, and Antarctica compare favourably with a globe.
* The central regions of the transverse projections on sphere and ellipsoid are indistinguishable on the small-scale projections shown here.
*The meridians at 90° east and west of the chosen central meridian project to horizontal lines through the poles. The more distant hemisphere is projected above the north pole and below the south pole.
*The equator bisects Africa, crosses South America and then continues onto the complete outer boundary of the projection; the top and bottom edges and the right and left edges must be identified (i.e. they represent the same lines on the globe). (Indonesia is bisected.)
*Distortion increases towards the right and left boundaries of the projection but it does not increase to infinity. Note the Galapagos Islands where the 90° west meridian meets the equator at bottom left.
*The map is conformal. Lines intersecting at any specified angle on the ellipsoid project into lines intersecting at the same angle on the projection. In particular parallels and meridians intersect at 90°.
*The point scale factor is independent of direction at any point so that the shape of a &quot;small&quot; region is reasonably well preserved. The necessary condition is that the magnitude of scale factor must not vary too much over the region concerned. Note that while South America is distorted greatly the island of Ceylon is small enough to be reasonably shaped although it is far from the central meridian.
*The choice of central meridian greatly affects the appearance of the projection. If 90°W is chosen then the whole of the Americas is reasonable. If 145°E is chosen the Far East is good and Australia is oriented with north up.

In most applications the Gauss–Krüger coordinate system is applied to a narrow strip near the central meridians where the differences between the spherical and ellipsoidal versions are small, but nevertheless important in accurate mapping. Direct series for scale, convergence and distortion are functions of eccentricity and both latitude and longitude on the ellipsoid: inverse series are functions of eccentricity and both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; on the projection. In the secant version the lines of true scale on the projection are no longer parallel to central meridian; they curve slightly. The convergence angle between projected meridians and the &quot;x&quot; constant grid lines is no longer zero (except on the equator) so that a grid bearing must be corrected to obtain an azimuth from true north. The difference is small, but not negligible, particularly at high latitudes.

===Implementations of the Gauss–Krüger projection===
In his 1912 paper, Krüger presented two distinct solutions, distinguished here by the expansion parameter:
* Krüger–&quot;n&quot; (paragraphs 5 to 8): Formulae for the direct projection, giving the coordinates &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, are fourth order expansions in terms of the third flattening, &quot;n&quot; (the ratio of the difference and sum of the major and minor axes of the ellipsoid). The coefficients are expressed in terms of latitude (&quot;φ&quot;), longitude (&quot;λ&quot;), major axis (&quot;a&quot;) and eccentricity (&quot;e&quot;). The inverse formulae for &quot;φ&quot; and &quot;λ&quot; are also fourth order expansions in &quot;n&quot; but with coefficients expressed in terms of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot;.
* Krüger–&quot;λ&quot; (paragraphs 13 and 14): Formulae giving the projection coordinates &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are expansions (of orders 5 and 4 respectively) in terms of the longitude &quot;λ&quot;, expressed in radians: the coefficients are expressed in terms of &quot;φ&quot;, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot;. The inverse projection for &quot;φ&quot; and &quot;λ&quot; are sixth order expansions in terms of the ratio , with coefficients expressed in terms of &quot;y&quot;, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot;. (See Transverse Mercator: Redfearn series.)

The Krüger–&quot;λ&quot; series were the first to be implemented, possibly because they were much easier to evaluate on the hand calculators of the mid twentieth century.
*Lee–Redfearn–OSGB: In 1945, L. P. Lee confirmed the &quot;λ&quot; expansions of Krüger and proposed their adoption by the OSGB but Redfearn (1948) pointed out that they were not accurate because of (a) the relatively high latitudes of Great Britain and (b) the great width of the area mapped, over 10 degrees of longitude. Redfearn extended the series to eighth order and examined which terms were necessary to attain an accuracy of 1 mm (ground measurement). The Redfearn series are still the basis of the OSGB map projections.
*Thomas–UTM: The &quot;λ&quot; expansions of Krüger were also confirmed by Paul Thomas in 1952: they are readily available in Snyder. His projection formulae, completely equivalent to those presented by Redfearn, were adopted by the United States Defence Mapping Agency as the basis for the UTM. They are also incorporated into the GEOTRANS coordinate converter made available by the United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s Office of Geomatics.
*Other countries: The Redfearn series are the basis for geodetic mapping in many countries: Australia, Germany, Canada, South Africa to name but a few. (A list is given in Appendix A.1 of Stuifbergen 2009.)
*Many variants of the Redfearn series have been proposed but only those adopted by national cartographic agencies are of importance. For an example of modifications which do not have this status see Transverse Mercator: Bowring series). All such modifications have been eclipsed by the power of modern computers and the development of high order &quot;n&quot;-series outlined below. The precise Redfearn series, although of low order, cannot be disregarded as they are still enshrined in the quasi-legal definitions of OSGB and UTM etc.

The Krüger–&quot;n&quot; series have been implemented (to fourth order in &quot;n&quot;) by the following nations.
*France
*Finland
*Sweden
*Japan

Higher order versions of the Krüger–&quot;n&quot; series have been implemented to seventh order by Engsager and Poder and to tenth order by Kawase. Apart from a series expansion for the transformation between latitude and conformal latitude, Karney has implemented the series to thirtieth order.

===Exact Gauss–Krüger and accuracy of the truncated series===
An exact solution by E. H. Thompson is described by L. P. Lee. It is constructed in terms of elliptic functions (defined in chapters 19 and 22 of the NIST handbook) which can be calculated to arbitrary accuracy using algebraic computing systems such as Maxima. Such an implementation of the exact solution is described by Karney (2011).

The exact solution is a valuable tool in assessing the accuracy of the truncated &quot;n&quot; and λ series. For example, the original 1912 Krüger–&quot;n&quot; series compares very favourably with the exact values: they differ by less than 0.31 μm within 1000 km of the central meridian and by less than 1 mm out to 6000 km. On the other hand, the difference of the Redfearn series used by GEOTRANS and the exact solution is less than 1 mm out to a longitude difference of 3 degrees, corresponding to a distance of 334 km from the central meridian at the equator but a mere 35 km at the northern limit of an UTM zone. Thus the Krüger–&quot;n&quot; series are very much better than the Redfearn λ series.

The Redfearn series becomes much worse as the zone widens. Karney discusses Greenland as an instructive example. The long thin landmass is centred on 42W and, at its broadest point, is no more than 750 km from that meridian while the span in longitude reaches almost 50 degrees. Krüger–&quot;n&quot; is accurate to within 1 mm but the Redfearn version of the Krüger–&quot;λ&quot; series has a maximum error of 1 kilometre.

Karney&#x27;s own 8th-order (in &quot;n&quot;) series is accurate to 5 nm within 3900 km of the central meridian.

==Formulae for the spherical transverse Mercator==

===Spherical normal Mercator revisited===

The normal cylindrical projections are described in relation to a cylinder tangential at the equator with axis along the polar axis of the sphere. The cylindrical projections are constructed so that all points on a meridian are projected to points with formula_1 (where formula_2 is the Earth radius) and formula_3 is a prescribed function of formula_4. For a tangent Normal Mercator projection the (unique) formulae which guarantee conformality are:
:formula_5
Conformality implies that the point scale, &quot;k&quot;, is independent of direction: it is a function of latitude only:
:formula_6
For the secant version of the projection there is a factor of &quot;k&quot; on the right hand side of all these equations: this ensures that the scale is equal to &quot;k&quot; on the equator.

===Normal and transverse graticules===
The figure on the left shows how a transverse cylinder is related to the conventional graticule on the sphere. It is tangential to some arbitrarily chosen meridian and its axis is perpendicular to that of the sphere. The &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-axes defined on the figure are related to the equator and central meridian exactly as they are for the normal projection. In the figure on the right a rotated graticule is related to the transverse cylinder in the same way that the normal cylinder is related to the standard graticule. The &#x27;equator&#x27;, &#x27;poles&#x27; (E and W) and &#x27;meridians&#x27; of the rotated graticule are identified with the chosen central meridian, points on the equator 90 degrees east and west of the central meridian, and great circles through those points.
The position of an arbitrary point (&quot;φ&quot;,&quot;λ&quot;) on the standard graticule can also be identified in terms of angles on the rotated graticule: &quot;φ′&quot; (angle M′CP) is an effective latitude and −&quot;λ′&quot; (angle M′CO) becomes an effective longitude. (The minus sign is necessary so that (&quot;φ′&quot;,&quot;λ′&quot;) are related to the rotated graticule in the same way that (&quot;φ&quot;,&quot;λ&quot;) are related to the standard graticule). The Cartesian (&quot;x′&quot;,&quot;y′&quot;) axes are related to the rotated graticule in the same way that the axes (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) axes are related to the standard graticule.

The tangent transverse Mercator projection defines the coordinates (&quot;x′&quot;,&quot;y′&quot;) in terms of −&quot;λ′&quot; and &quot;φ′&quot; by the transformation formulae of the tangent Normal Mercator projection:
:formula_7
This transformation projects the central meridian to a straight line of finite length and at the same time projects the great circles through E and W (which include the equator) to infinite straight lines perpendicular to the central meridian. The true parallels and meridians (other than equator and central meridian) have no simple relation to the rotated graticule and they project to complicated curves.

===The relation between the graticules===
The angles of the two graticules are related by using spherical trigonometry on the spherical triangle NM′P defined by the true meridian through the origin, OM′N, the true meridian through an arbitrary point, MPN, and the great circle WM′PE. The results are:
:formula_8

===Direct transformation formulae===
The direct formulae giving the Cartesian coordinates (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) follow immediately from the above. Setting &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y′&quot; and &quot;y&quot; = −&quot;x′&quot; (and restoring factors of &quot;k&quot; to accommodate secant versions)
:formula_9
The above expressions are given in Lambert and also (without derivations) in Snyder, Maling and Osborne (with full details).

===Inverse transformation formulae===
Inverting the above equations gives
:formula_10

===Point scale===
In terms of the coordinates with respect to the rotated graticule the point scale factor is given by &quot;k&quot; = sec &quot;φ′&quot;: this may be expressed either in terms of the geographical coordinates or in terms of the projection coordinates:
:formula_11
The second expression shows that the scale factor is simply a function of the distance from the central meridian of the projection. A typical value of the scale factor is &quot;k&quot; = 0.9996 so that &quot;k&quot; = 1 when &quot;x&quot; is approximately 180 km. When &quot;x&quot; is approximately 255 km and &quot;k&quot; = 1.0004: the scale factor is within 0.04% of unity over a strip of about 510 km wide.

===Convergence===
The convergence angle &quot;γ&quot; at a point on the projection is defined by the angle measured &quot;from&quot; the projected meridian, which defines true north, &quot;to&quot; a grid line of constant &quot;x&quot;, defining grid north. Therefore, &quot;γ&quot; is positive in the quadrant north of the equator and east of the central meridian and also in the quadrant south of the equator and west of the central meridian. The convergence must be added to a grid bearing to obtain a bearing from true north. For the secant transverse Mercator the convergence may be expressed either in terms of the geographical coordinates or in terms of the projection coordinates:
:formula_12

* Exact (closed form) transverse Mercator projection: Transverse Mercator: exact solution
* Fourth order Redfearn series by concise formulae (example): Transverse Mercator: Bowring series

==Coordinates, grids, eastings and northings==
The projection coordinates resulting from the various developments of the ellipsoidal transverse Mercator are Cartesian coordinates such that the central meridian corresponds to the &quot;x&quot; axis and the equator corresponds to the &quot;y&quot; axis. Both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are defined for all values of &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;ϕ&quot;. The projection does not define a grid: the grid is an independent construct which could be defined arbitrarily. In practice the national implementations, and UTM, do use grids aligned with the Cartesian axes of the projection, but they are of finite extent, with origins which need not coincide with the intersection of the central meridian with the equator.

The true grid origin is always taken on the central meridian so that grid coordinates will be negative west of the central meridian. To avoid such negative grid coordinates, standard practice defines a false origin to the west (and possibly north or south) of the grid origin: the coordinates relative to the false origin define eastings and northings which will always be positive. The false easting, &quot;E&quot;0, is the distance of the true grid origin east of the false origin. The false northing, &quot;N&quot;0, is the distance of the true grid origin north of the false origin. If the true origin of the grid is at latitude &quot;φ&quot;0 on the central meridian and the scale factor the central meridian is &quot;k&quot;0 then these definitions give eastings and northings by:
: formula_13
The terms &quot;eastings&quot; and &quot;northings&quot; do not mean strict east and north directions. Grid lines of the transverse projection, other than the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; axes, do not run north-south or east-west as defined by parallels and meridians. This is evident from the global projections shown above. Near the central meridian the differences are small but measurable. The difference between the north-south grid lines and the true meridians is the angle of convergence.

<doc id="639246" wikidata="Q1967968" url="?curid=639246" title="Benham-class destroyer">
<text>The &quot;Benham&quot; class of ten destroyers was built for the United States Navy (USN). They were part of a series of USN destroyers limited to 1,500 tons standard displacement by the London Naval Treaty and built in the 1930s. The class was laid down in 1936–1937 and all were commissioned in 1939. Much of their design was based on the immediately preceding and s. Like these classes, the &quot;Benham&quot;s were notable for including sixteen torpedo tubes, the heaviest torpedo armament ever on US destroyers. They introduced a new high-pressure boiler that saved space and weight, as only three of the new boilers were required compared to four of the older designs.

The class served extensively in World War II in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific theaters, including Neutrality Patrols in the Atlantic 1940–1941. &quot;Sterett&quot; received the United States Presidential Unit Citation for the Battle of Guadalcanal and the Battle of Vella Gulf, and the Philippine Republic Presidential Unit Citation for her World War II service. Two of the class were lost during World War II, three were scrapped in 1947, while the remaining five ships were scuttled after being contaminated from the Operation Crossroads atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific.

==Design==
The ten &quot;Benham&quot;s were part of a series of three classes with similar characteristics laid down 1935-1937. The other two were the &quot;Gridley&quot; class (4 ships) and the &quot;Bagley&quot; class (8 ships). All three featured four dual purpose guns (anti-surface and anti-aircraft) and sixteen torpedo tubes in four quadruple mounts as built, the largest number of torpedo tubes on any US destroyers. Although all had only one stack, they differed primarily in their machinery. The &quot;Benham&quot;s were a Gibbs &amp; Cox design with a new high-pressure boiler design that allowed a reduction from four boilers to three, with an efficient turbine arrangement resembling the s&#x27;. The &quot;Bagley&quot;s were a Navy design that duplicated the machinery of the preceding long-range &quot;Mahan&quot; class; this led to their prominent boiler uptakes around the single stack that were their main recognition feature. The &quot;Gridley&quot;s were designed by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Company with advanced high-pressure boilers (also built by Bethlehem) but turbines generally similar to the earlier , which limited their range.

===Engineering===
Except for the 1850-ton , the &quot;Benham&quot;s&#x27; propulsion plant was the most advanced yet installed in US destroyers. A new Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler design was used that allowed a reduction from four boilers to three, saving considerable space and weight. Steam pressure was increased from to (one reference says 565 psi), superheated to as in the &quot;Gridley&quot;s. Features that improved fuel economy included boiler economizers, double reduction gearing, and cruising turbines. Range was somewhat less than in the &quot;Bagley&quot;s at versus , possibly due to a smaller fuel capacity of 484 tons versus 504 tons. The main turbines developed on &quot;Benham&quot;&#x27;s trials and were manufactured by Westinghouse.

===Armament===
The &quot;Benham&quot;s had the same armament as the &quot;Gridley&quot;s and &quot;Bagley&quot;s: four 5-inch/38 caliber dual purpose guns (anti-surface and anti-aircraft (AA)) in single mounts and sixteen 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in quadruple mounts. The Mark 15 torpedo was equipped. This was the heaviest armament in torpedoes ever on US destroyers. Compared with the &quot;Mahan&quot;s, they sacrificed one gun for four additional torpedo tubes. It was suggested that these ships could use &quot;curved ahead fire&quot;, using the adjustable post-launch gyro angle of their torpedoes to launch a sixteen-torpedo spread ahead of the ship. One reason for the heavy destroyer torpedo armament was that, alone among the major navies, the last nine of the seventeen US Treaty cruisers built in the 1920s and 1930s lacked torpedoes; eventually all of the US Treaty cruisers&#x27; torpedoes were removed in 1941 in favor of additional heavy AA guns.

As with most other US destroyers of this period, the 5-inch guns featured all-angle power loading and were director controlled, making them as effective as the technology allowed against aircraft. By late 1942, radio proximity fuses (VT fuses) made them much more effective. As in the last two &quot;Maury&quot;s, the two forward 5-inch guns were in enclosed mounts, while the after guns were open. However, in the &quot;Benham&quot;s, the after two mounts were a Mark 30 Mod 1 base-ring type with an integral ammunition hoist fed from a handling room below each gun, as in an enclosed mount. This allowed some of the class to be fitted with an enclosure for No. 4 gun and an open-top shield for No. 3 gun while on Neutrality Patrol in the Atlantic in 1941; but the shields were removed later to save weight for light anti-aircraft armament. In common with all US surface combatants in the 1930s, the as-built light AA armament was weak; only four .50 caliber machine guns (12.7 mm) were equipped. It was apparently felt that the heavy AA armament would shoot down most incoming aircraft in all situations, but the attack on Pearl Harbor showed that this was not true.

While on Neutrality Patrol, some of the class landed their after torpedo tube mounts and .50-caliber machine guns so that their Depth charge and light AA batteries could be increased; photographs show six Oerlikon 20 mm cannon were added along with four K-gun depth charge throwers and, reportedly, a Y-gun on some ships. These ships later received two twin 40 mm Bofors mounts on their after deckhouses before being transferred to the Pacific. In 1945, &quot;Lang&quot;, &quot;Sterett&quot;, and &quot;Wilson&quot; also landed their remaining torpedo tubes and after 5-inch gun shields in favor of a total of four 40 mm twin mounts and four 20 mm twin mounts.

==Service==
This class, except &quot;Benham&quot; and &quot;Ellet&quot;, served on Neutrality Patrols in the Atlantic and escort duty in the Atlantic and Mediterranean as Destroyer Squadron 8 (with as flagship) from April 1940 to December 1941. &quot;Benham&quot; and &quot;Ellet&quot; were at sea in the Pacific on 7 December 1941 with and of the &quot;Mahan&quot; class as Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 12 (part of Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 6, with as flagship). Later, this four-ship division escorted the aircraft carrier during the Doolittle Raid on Japan.

In June 1942, while DesDiv 15 (&quot;Lang&quot;, &quot;Stack&quot;, &quot;Sterett&quot; and &quot;Wilson&quot;) escorted the aircraft carrier to the Pacific, DesDiv 16 (&quot;Mayrant&quot;, &quot;Trippe&quot;, &quot;Rhind&quot;, and &quot;Rowan&quot;) remained in the Atlantic, supporting the Operation Torch landings in North Africa in December 1942. In 1943 they served off Italy, where &quot;Mayrant&quot; was badly damaged by a German air attack off Palermo and &quot;Rowan&quot; sunk by an E-boat (torpedo boat) attack off Salerno.

Meanwhile, the six Pacific destroyers operated in the Solomon Islands (where &quot;Ellet&quot; was ordered to sink the Australian heavy cruiser after the Battle of Savo Island), and were on hand for the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 13–15 November 1942, in which &quot;Sterett&quot; was badly damaged and &quot;Benham&quot; sunk. &quot;Lang&quot;, &quot;Sterett&quot;, and &quot;Stack&quot; formed division &quot;A-2&quot; at the Battle of Vella Gulf in 1943 and, thereafter, all five remaining ships accompanied the advance through the Marshalls and Marianas. Reassigned as DesDiv 4 of DesRon 2, the former DesDiv 15 ships were at Leyte and later Okinawa; &quot;Ellet&quot; was at Iwo Jima. In April 1945, &quot;Sterett&quot; and &quot;Wilson&quot; were both damaged in &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks while on radar picket duty; &quot;Wilson&quot; remained in service while &quot;Sterett&quot; returned to service as the war ended. &quot;Sterett&quot;, &quot;Ellet&quot;, and &quot;Lang&quot; were scrapped in 1947. The others, contaminated as targets in the Operation Crossroads atomic bomb tests, were decommissioned and scuttled in deep water off Kwajalein in 1948.

 earned 12 battle stars, the United States Presidential Unit Citation for the Battle of Guadalcanal and the Battle of Vella Gulf, and the Philippine Republic Presidential Unit Citation for her World War II service.

<text>&quot;Master Mind&quot; was a comic strip in the British comic magazine &quot;Buster&quot;. It made its first appearance in the issue dated 8 November 1980, and ran until 1983 when it was replaced with &quot;Cliff Hanger&quot;. It was written and drawn by Jack Edward Oliver.

Alf Witt was a boy who lived in the town of Flittem, and was not very clever. After falling into a hole, he met a wizard called Madness Madnesson (a reference to Magnus Magnusson, who hosted the television show &quot;Mastermind&quot; at this time) who gave him super powers. By getting into a telephone booth and saying the mystic word &quot;Pass&quot;, Alf Witt would transform into a superhero called Master Mind.

In the strip he would come across a supervillain and ask the readers for help on how to defeat him, this would usually involve puzzles such as anagrams, join the dots, and many others. Master Mind also had a dog that would accompany him, called Bones.

<text>The triens ( trientes) was an Ancient Roman bronze coin produced during the Roman Republic valued at one-third of an as (4 unciae). The most common design for the triens featured the bust of Minerva and four pellets (indicating four unciae) on the obverse and the prow of a galley on the reverse. It was not a common denomination and was last struck c. 89 BC.

Later, in Frankish Gaul, the term &quot;triens&quot; was often used for the tremissis, since both terms meant &quot;a third&quot;.

<doc id="639253" wikidata="Q16973472" url="?curid=639253" title="Williamsport Crosscutters">
<text>The Williamsport Crosscutters are a collegiate summer baseball team of the MLB Draft League. They are located in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and play their home games at Journey Bank Ballpark at Historic Bowman Field. From 1994 to 2020, they were a Minor League Baseball team of the Class A Short Season New York–Penn League until MLB&#x27;s reorganization of the minors after the 2020 season. Prior to this, they were affiliates of the Chicago Cubs (1994–1998), Pittsburgh Pirates (1999–2006), and Philadelphia Phillies (2007–2020).

==History==
Through 1993, the club was the Geneva Cubs, playing in Geneva, New York. For the 1994 season, the club moved to Williamsport, occupying a historic facility that had not been used for professional baseball for the previous two seasons. The club became known as the Williamsport Cubs, a Class A short season affiliate of the Chicago Cubs, retaining that name through 1998. In 1999, the team switched affiliations from the Chicago Cubs to the Pittsburgh Pirates and the team name became &quot;the Crosscutters&quot;. At the end of the 2006 season, the team became an affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies, with the Pittsburgh affiliation switching to the State College Spikes.

The Crosscutters shared the New York–Penn League championship with the Brooklyn Cyclones in 2001, after losing the first game of the series. Both teams were declared champions after the remainder of the series was canceled in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Crosscutters again made the playoffs in 2002 but were eliminated in the first round. However, the team returned to win the championship series, against the Cyclones, in 2003.

The name &quot;Crosscutters&quot; reflects the logging heritage of Williamsport, once known as the &quot;Lumber Capital of the World.&quot; The city, historically having the largest amount of millionaires per capita, is on the West Branch Susquehanna River, and logging barons once lived in mansions along Fourth Street, which became known as &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Row&quot;. To this day, sports teams at Williamsport Area High School are known as the Millionaires.

The 2015 season saw the Williamsport Crosscutters clinch their first Pinckney Division Championship since 2001.

On September 18, 2017, the Crosscutters announced that its Player Development Contract (PDC) had been extended by the Phillies through the 2020 season. In 2017, the team’s total attendance at Bowman Field was 61,082.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minors after the 2020 season, Williamsport left Minor League Baseball and became a collegiate summer baseball team of the newly created MLB Draft League, which is a showcase for draft-eligible players.

==Championships==
In 2001, the Crosscutters and Brooklyn Cyclones were declared the New York–Penn League&#x27;s co-champions. The Crosscutters lost the first game of the best of three championship series, and the rest of the series was cancelled after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

In 2003, the Crosscutters won the New York–Penn League championship outright, defeating the Cyclones in two games to sweep the series.

In 2015, the Crosscutters won the New York-Penn League Pinckney Division, posting a league best record of 46-30. The Crosscutters would be eliminated from the playoffs by the West Virginia Black Bears two games to one. The Black Bears would go on to win the 2015 New York Penn League Championship.

In 2022, the Crosscutters won the 2nd Half Championship of the MLB Draft League. The Crosscutters would go on to the MLB Draft League Championship Game, but would fall to the West Virginia Black Bears.

In 2024, the Crosscutters won the 1st Half Championship of the MLB Draft League and would host the League Championship Game. Williamsport would go on to win the 2024 MLB Draft League Championship.

==Logos and uniforms==

The official colors of the Williamsport Crosscutters are Phillies red, navy blue, gray, dark tan, and ivory. The team most recently changed its brand prior to the 2008 season, one year following an affiliation change from the Pittsburgh Pirates to the Philadelphia Phillies. The colors resemble the red, white, and blue scheme of the Phillies, but with some additional colors and minor tweaks. The former colors were burgundy and black.

The Crosscutters wear a red cap with the W-shaped saw cap logo in dark tan and ivory for home games, and a navy blue cap with a logo depicting a capital &quot;C&quot; superimposed over a tree stump. The home uniforms include sleeveless, white jerseys with traditional red piping and the &quot;Cutters&quot; wordmark in grey and red, outlined in navy blue. The number on the back is in navy blue with white and red outline. The undershirts are red, with the secondary logo centered on the left sleeve. The socks and belts are also red. The away uniforms are grey, but otherwise the same as the homes.

<doc id="639256" wikidata="Q4951307" url="?curid=639256" title="Bowman Field">
<text>Historic Bowman Field is a minor league baseball stadium in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is home to the Williamsport Crosscutters, a collegiate summer baseball team of the MLB Draft League. The official seating capacity is 2,366. Opened in 1926, Bowman Field is the second-oldest ballpark in minor league baseball. Bowman Field is also the home field for the Wildcats of the Pennsylvania College of Technology for more than a decade. A new field project for the Penn College Wildcats was planned to be completed by 2022, but has since been delayed.

Named for local businessman J. Walton Bowman in 1929, Bowman Field had the official designation &quot;Historic&quot; added in 2000.

Since 2017, Bowman Field has been used for a regular-season Major League Baseball (MLB) game, the MLB Little League Classic, held each August while the Little League World Series is underway in nearby South Williamsport.

In 2012, Airmen Pond, an outdoor ice hockey rink, was built at Bowman Field. It served as home ice for the Williamsport Outlaws of the Federal Hockey League until the team folded in January 2013.

==History==
===Ballparks in Williamsport before Bowman Field===
Williamsport has hosted minor league baseball since the late 19th century. The various teams played at differing sites in Williamsport. The earliest ballfield was near the West Branch Susquehanna River. It has long since been replaced by a levee and U.S. Route 220, U.S. Route 15 and Interstate 180. A second and more permanent facility was built in the Vallamont neighborhood. Cochran Elementary School sits on the former site of the ballpark. The Williamsport Bills and later Williamsport Grays played the seasons at Williamsport High School&#x27;s athletic field on West 3rd Street. It too is long since gone; this property is currently home of the Pennsylvania College of Technology.

===Construction and opening===
Bowman Field was completed in 1926 to host the city&#x27;s entry as an original franchise in the New York–Pennsylvania League called the Williamsport Grays. The Grays were a charter member of the New York–Pennsylvania league which was established in 1923. Two of the most important boosters and financial backers of the team were J. Walton Bowman for whom the stadium was named and Thomas Gray, the Lycoming County sheriff, for whom the Grays were named.

The Grays had previously been playing their home games on the athletic field of Williamsport High School. This facility proved to be much too small. A larger and more permanent stadium was needed. A group of civic leaders and baseball boosters lead the drive to construct a new stadium for the Grays on the western side of Williamsport on the banks of Lycoming Creek. An agreement between the Grays and the city was reached in July, 1925 to build what was then known as Memorial Field, which was named for the municipal park in which it is located. J. Walton Bowman headed an 11-member holding company that financed and managed the construction of the ballpark at a cost of $75,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Ground was broken in the fall of 1925 and the stadium opened in time for the beginning of the 1926 New York–Pennsylvania League season.

The original dimensions of Bowman Field were quite large compared to the dimensions of modern baseball fields. Bowman Field measured to the right field foul pole, to dead center field and to the left field foul pole. Another unusual feature of the stadium was a terrace that was located on left field near the fence.

The first game to be played at Bowman Field took place on April 22, 1926, when the Grays hosted the team of nearby Bucknell University in an exhibition. The first professional opponent to appear at Bowman Field was the Harrisburg Colored Giants. The Grays lost two games to the Giants on April 27 and 29. The first New York–Pennsylvania League game took place on May 4. The Grays beat the Shamokin Indians 5-1.

===Eastern League===
The Eastern League was at Bowman off and on for nearly 70 years. The Williamsport Grays started play in 1926 in Bowman Field. The final Eastern League team to call the park home was the 1991 Williamsport Bills. That team moved to Binghamton, New York, the next season and became the Binghamton Mets.

The Grays began playing in the forerunner of the Eastern League, the old New York–Pennsylvania League in 1923. The Class B league was made entirely of teams from New York and Pennsylvania. It kept this name until 1938 when the Scranton Miners move to Hartford, Connecticut. Williamsport was a member of the league for 46 years between 1923 and 1991. The teams were known as the Grays, Tigers, A&#x27;s, Mets, Tomahawks and Bills. Williamsport had affiliations with the Philadelphia A&#x27;s for three periods, Pittsburgh Pirates, Detroit Tigers, Washington Senators, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets, Cleveland Indians for two separate periods, and Seattle Mariners.

The Phillies played a mid season exhibition game at Bowman Field on July 31, 1962, when the team lost to the Williamsport Grays, the Phillies&#x27; Eastern League affiliate.

====The potato incident====
Dave Bresnahan was catching for the 1987 Williamsport Bills, who were in seventh place in an eight-team league, playing the last-place Reading Phillies in late-August game. With a runner on third base, Bresnahan switched catcher&#x27;s mitts and put on a glove in which he had secreted a shaved-down potato. When the pitch came in, Bresnahan fired the white potato down the third-base line, enticing the runner to sprint home. Bresnahan then tagged the runner with the baseball, prompting the umpire to award the runner home plate for Bresnahan&#x27;s deception, even though he clearly had been tagged out with the ball.

Bresnahan is a distant relative of Hall of Famer Roger Bresnahan and was released by the team the day after the incident.&quot; However, the citizens of Williamsport applauded Bresnahan for his ingenuity, eventually prompting the club to retire his number 59. At the retirement ceremony in 1998, Bresnahan was quoted as saying, &quot;Lou Gehrig had to play in 2,130 consecutive games and hit .340 for his number to be retired, and all I had to do was bat .140 and throw a potato.&quot;

===New York–Penn League===
For the 1994 season, baseball returned to Bowman with the New York–Penn League&#x27;s Williamsport Cubs. The club became the Crosscutters, a Pittsburgh Pirates farm team, in 1999. Significant stadium upgrades took place prior to the 2002 season. The club became a farm team of the Philadelphia Phillies in 2006. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minors after the 2020 season, Williamsport left the New York–Penn League and became a collegiate summer baseball team of the newly created MLB Draft League, which is a showcase for draft-eligible players.

===Ice hockey–Federal Hockey League===

On July 24, 2012, Williamsport mayor Gabriel J. Campana announced that the Williamsport Outlaws of the Federal Hockey League (FHL) would play their 2012–2013 season at an outdoor ice rink built at Bowman Field. The Outlaws were the FHL champions their previous (and first) season, which they played in Wayne, New Jersey, as the &quot;New Jersey Outlaws&quot;. On August 1 the Crosscutters and Outlaws agreed to terms regarding restoration of the baseball diamond after the removal of the ice rink at the end of the hockey season, though beer sales at Outlaws games were still an issue (as the Crosscutters hold the liquor license for the stadium). Construction of the ice rink, named Airmen Pond after a local sponsor, began in early October. The rink was also open for public skating and use by local amateur teams.

The ice rink officially opened on October 18, and the first home game of the Outlaws&#x27; 60-game season on October 24 drew over 3,000 fans, an FHL record. The Dayton Demonz beat the Outlaws 5–2; temperatures were over for much of the game. Williamsport Ice Arena, a local non-profit group headed by FHL commissioner Don Kirnan, operated the ice rink and rented it to the Outlaws and other users. In November 2012, the non-profit filed an injunction seeking to prevent the rink&#x27;s builder, Rink Specialists of Naples, Maine, from repossessing it for late payments; both sides alleged breach of contract. The FHL All Star Game was scheduled to be played at Bowman Field on January 2, 2013.

===Renovation project===
On May 26, 2016, Mayor Gabriel Campana, Peter Freund, Crosscutters principal owner, Crosscutters staff, and other stakeholders broke ground for a first base deck where fans can interact while enjoying food and refreshments. This deck is part of a $3 million project to upgrade one of the oldest baseball parks in the country. The newly announced renovations are being made possible by a $1.25 million RACP Grant by the state. , the renovation decreased the capacity to 2,366.

===MLB Little League Classic===
On March 9, 2017, Major League Baseball announced that the first MLB Little League Classic would take place on August 20 of that year, during the Little League World Series. In a statement, Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred said that the league&#x27;s &quot;greatest responsibility is to ensure that today&#x27;s youth become active participants in our game as players and fans.&quot; The St. Louis Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Pirates were selected to play in that game. Tickets to the game were reserved for those involved in the Little League World Series, as well as a limited number of residents of Lycoming County on a lottery basis. The game was televised by ESPN as its weekly &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; game. Two members of the Cardinals had played in Williamsport during past Little League World Series; outfielder Randal Grichuk for the Lamar Little League team in and , and pitcher Lance Lynn for the Brownsburg Little League team in . Over the last few weeks before the game, the field was renovated to conform to MLB&#x27;s standards. The outfield dimensions were changed to to right field, to center field, and to left field; prior to this the dimensions measured from right to left.

===Names===
The stadium was known as Memorial Field from 1926 until 1929. It was renamed Bowman Field on June 26, 1929, to honor J. Walton Bowman, the president of the Grays at the time. Bowman had a large role in the effort to fund and construct the stadium. He was also honored by the players of the team with a Swiss watch, and his granddaughter was given the honor of hoisting a pennant in center field bearing the name &quot;Bowman Field&quot;. In 2000, the name was changed to Historic Bowman Field.

In 2014, Susquehanna Bank entered into a naming rights agreement with the city, which then added the bank&#x27;s name to the stadium&#x27;s name. In 2016, that sponsor was purchased by a larger bank, BB&amp;T, and the stadium updated its name accordingly. When that deal expired in 2020, the city looked for a new sponsor, but there was only one offer, from Muncy Bank and Trust. The six-year contract paid the city nothing for the first year and $32,500 annually for the next five years. Muncy Bank and Trust merged with another bank in 2023 to form Journey Bank, and the name of the sponsor for Bowman Field changed again to reflect that.

<text>Shining Force is a 1992 turn-based tactical role-playing game for the Sega Genesis console. It is the second entry of the &quot;Shining&quot; series of video games, following &quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot;. While primarily a traditional fantasy-themed game, it contains some science fiction elements.

The game has been repeatedly re-released: in Sega Smash Pack Volume 1 for the Dreamcast and Sega Smash Pack 2 for Microsoft Windows, in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and as a standalone game for the Wii Virtual Console and Microsoft Windows via Steam. Additionally, in 2004 a remake was released for the Game Boy Advance under the title Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon and in 2010 the game was released for iOS but was discontinued in 2015. It was re-released again on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2021.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Shining Force&quot; is a turn-based tactical role-playing game. Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, do not count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit&#x27;s agility score and a random seed.

As is most common for the RPG genre, units become stronger by fighting enemies or by performing other actions in battle, such as healing allies. These actions give the units experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels.

In &quot;Shining Force&quot;, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series. Although there are no &quot;generic&quot; units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.

Each allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character&#x27;s level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted to a higher level.

Battle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies&#x27; leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player&#x27;s leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle&#x27;s outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player&#x27;s army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max&#x27;s death results in the player losing half of their money.

&quot;Shining Force&quot; also possesses an exploration mode that occurs outside of battle. This gameplay mode is essentially a Japanese-style traditional RPG, along the lines of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, although there are no labyrinths and only a few puzzles to solve. In this mode, the player&#x27;s army is represented by Max, who is able to walk around, interact with people, find treasure, buy equipment and items, outfit the army, and choose which of the army&#x27;s members will be used in battle.

==Plot==
The game opens in the Kingdom of Guardiana, in the land of Rune. The protagonist, Max, is sent on a mission to prevent the evil Kane, who commands the hordes of Runefaust, from opening the Shining Path and resurrecting Dark Dragon. Along the way, Max recruits a number of allies to join the Shining Force. They eventually find that both Kane and King Ramladu are under the control of the manipulative Darksol. Darksol ultimately succeeds in reviving Dark Dragon, but Max seals the creature away using the power of the Chaos Breaker, a sword created by merging a sword of light with Kane&#x27;s sword of darkness.

==Development and release==
Despite being the sequel to the successful &quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot;, Sega allotted only a minimal budget to the development of &quot;Shining Force&quot;. Contrary to popular assumption, &quot;Shining Force&quot; was not influenced by archetypal tactical RPG &quot;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot;. In fact, when asked about the game, lead &quot;Shining Force&quot; developer Hiroyuki Takahashi remarked: &quot;The tempo of that title was so bad that it wasn&#x27;t something I even wanted to play.&quot; Takahashi recalled that &quot;Shining Force&quot; was chiefly inspired by &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. Asking himself how he and the rest of the development team could &quot;take the battles from &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and make them more fun&quot;, he drew inspiration from an obscure Japanese PC game called &quot;Silver Ghost&quot;, &quot;a simulation action type of game where you had to direct, oversee and command multiple characters&quot;. The game was released for Wii via Virtual Console in Japan on July 10, 2007, in North America on July 23, 2007, and on August 3, 2007.

==Reception==

In Japan, it topped the &quot;Famitsu&quot; sales chart in April 1992. Power Unlimited gave the game a score of 89% &quot;Shining Force is a fantastic RPG in itself, with a great story, good graphics and a sublime battle mode, but the special thing is that the game is much more accessible than most RPGs.&quot;

The game was well received. &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at #33 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.

===Retrospective===
In 2004, readers of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; voted this &quot;truly unique RPG masterpiece&quot; 86th top retro game, with the staff additionally calling it &quot;one of the greatest Megadrive games of all time and a definite office favourite.&quot;

==Remake==
The game was remade in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance under the title &quot;Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon&quot;. The changes included an expanded plot, three new playable characters, three new battles, ramping difficulty system and some tweaks in the gameplay. One of the new characters can use &quot;cards&quot; in battle, and turn order is determined solely by a unit&#x27;s speed stat and can be checked at any time from a list, allowing the player to plan out battles with greater certainty. The remake features a ramping difficulty system: every time a playthrough is successfully completed, a player earns a star and all enemies get a boost in stats for the next playthrough. The game has also had a rerelease for iOS, which has been removed from the App Store by Sega.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Resurrection of the Dark Dragon&quot; the best Game Boy Advance game of July 2004.

<text>The sextans was an Ancient Roman bronze coin produced during the Roman Republic valued at one-sixth of an as (2 unciae). An as was roughly 324 grams in weight, thus leaving the sextans at about 54 grams. However, the effects of the Second Punic War on the Republic&#x27;s economy resulted in a reduction in weight, where the as reduced to about 50 grams, resulting in the sextans weighing about 8 grams. The most common design for the sextans was the bust of Mercury and two pellets (indicating two unciae) on the obverse and the prow of a galley on the reverse. Earlier types depicted a scallop shell, a caduceus, or other symbols on the obverse.

<text>The Viru Valley is located in La Libertad Region on the north west coast of Peru.

==The Viru Valley Project==
In 1946 the first attempt to study settlement patterns in the Americas took place in the Viru Valley, led by Gordon Willey. Rather than examine individual settlement sites, Willey wanted to look at the valley as a whole and the way that each village interacted with the others. The study showed that villages were located in places which reflected their relationship with the wider landscape and their neighbours. The project emphasised the importance for archaeologists of viewing sites holistically and to take into account the economic, environmental, social and political factors acting on past societies.

Willey&#x27;s groundbreaking study stimulated the work of a number of subsequent archaeologists in the valley. From 1992 to 1998 Dr. Thomas A. Zoubek embarked on a study of the earliest mid and upper valley sites in Viru concentrating specifically at the sites of Huaca El Gallo/La Gallina of Virú culture, in the El Nino Quebrada. These excavations and later ones in the Susanga region completely redefined our knowledge of the earliest agricultural societies in the valley and resulted in the discovery of the earliest ceramics found in coastal Peru that have been dated to c.2400 BCE.

<doc id="639269" wikidata="Q266429" url="?curid=639269" title="Tom Holkenborg">
<text>Tom Holkenborg (born 8 December 1967), also known as Junkie XL, is a Dutch composer, multi-instrumentalist, DJ, producer, and engineer. Originally known for his trance productions, he has moved to producing electronica and big beat music and film scores. His remix of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; became a worldwide hit in 2002.

In film scores, he has worked with Hans Zimmer and his company Remote Control Productions on &quot;Man of Steel&quot; and &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, as well as composing the scores for &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;, &quot;Divergent&quot;, &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;, &quot;Deadpool&quot;, &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (and its sequels), &quot;Scoob!&quot;, &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, &quot;Army of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Three Thousand Years of Longing&quot; and &quot;Rebel Moon - Part 1&quot; as well as &quot;Rebel Moon - Part 2&quot;.

==Early life==
Holkenborg was born in Lichtenvoorde, Gelderland, Netherlands. Classically trained by his mother – herself an accredited music teacher – Holkenborg started playing piano when he was three years old, drums when he was eight, and guitar at 12. Influenced by the psychedelic pop of Pink Floyd and King Crimson, he took up the bass by age 14. After moving to Leeuwarden, at the age of 17, he decided to take a job at a local music store selling keyboards and other digital gear, and began to have an appreciation for the combination of electronic and organic sounds. It was shortly after he discovered synthesizers that he joined the Dutch new wave ensemble Weekend at Waikiki as a multi-instrumentalist and producer, touring extensively with the band, including through Poland and parts of the Soviet Union, from 1988 to 1991. He also produced and played on their 1994 album, &quot;Sputnik&quot;. In 1993, Holkenborg produced &quot;Almost a Dance&quot; by Dutch metal band The Gathering, and later that year went on to form the industrial rock band Nerve with Phil Mills. After signing with label Play It Again Sam in 1992 and releasing two LPs – &quot;Cancer of Choice&quot; (1993) and &quot;Blood &amp; Gold&quot; (1994) – he continued as a producer, working with hardcore punk and metal bands like Sepultura, Fear Factory, and Dog Eat Dog, while simultaneously licensing some of his instrumental electronic tracks for racing video games like &quot;The Need For Speed&quot; and &quot;Test Drive 5&quot;. It was during this time that he also began scoring the Dutch feature film &quot;Siberia&quot;, which would be released by Warner Bros. Netherlands.

==Career==
===1997–99: &quot;Saturday Teenage Kick&quot; and &quot;Big Sounds of the Drags&quot;===
In 1997, Holkenborg released &quot;Saturday Teenage Kick&quot;, his first album under the &quot;Junkie XL&quot; moniker. Featuring singles such as &quot;Billy Club&quot;, &quot;Def Beat&quot;, and &quot;Dealing with the Roster&quot;, the album combined pounding breakbeat rhythms with elements of rock and psychedelia. Much of the album&#x27;s songs featured lyrics and vocals by Patrick &quot;Rude Boy&quot; Tilon, vocalist for the Dutch rap rock band Urban Dance Squad. After a brief tour with The Prodigy and festival dates at Fuji Rock and Roskilde, Holkenborg made a name for himself in the upcoming U.S. rave scene. His second LP, &quot;Big Sounds of the Drags&quot;, was released in 1999, once again with Tilon providing vocal work to most of the album&#x27;s songs, as in &quot;Action Radius&quot;, &quot;Power of Big Slacks&quot;, &quot;Zerotonine&quot;, &quot;Love Like Razorblade&quot;, &quot;Legion&quot;, and &quot;Next Plateau&quot;. &quot;Future in Computer Hell (Part 2)&quot;, the last track on the album, was featured prominently on Welsh DJ and producer Sasha&#x27;s mix album &quot;Global Underground 013: Ibiza&quot;.

===2002: &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot;===
While making inroads as a film composer – contributing to movies like &quot;Blade&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Beach&quot; (2000) – Holkenborg was asked to remix Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1968 single &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; (with three different music videos) for a 2002 Nike World Cup commercial, titled &quot;Secret Tournament&quot;. The occasion marked the first time Presley&#x27;s estate had granted permission for any of Presley&#x27;s material to be remixed. The song reached No. 1 in 24 countries, including the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and Mexico, and was released as a single under the name &quot;Elvis vs. JXL&quot;. The song was also featured as the title song to the NBC TV series &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, and in feature films like &quot;Shark Tale&quot;, &quot;Next&quot;, &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot;, &quot;MegaMind&quot;, and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;.

===2003: &quot;Radio JXL: A Broadcast from the Computer Hell Cabin&quot;===
The success of &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; set the stage for his 2003 double-disc album, &quot;Radio JXL: A Broadcast from the Computer Hell Cabin&quot;. The name &quot;Computer Hell&quot; referred to Holkenborg&#x27;s Amsterdam studio and headquarters. Loosely based around the concept of a fictitious pirate radio station, the album&#x27;s 3PM side features collaborations with The Cure&#x27;s Robert Smith, Depeche Mode&#x27;s Dave Gahan, Peter Tosh, Chuck D from Public Enemy, Gary Numan, Solomon Burke, and Saffron, along with the said Elvis Presley remix. The 3AM side consists mostly of progressive house instrumentals, including &quot;Breezer&quot;, a collaboration with Sasha. The album was to be launched simultaneously with a fully functioning internet radio station at www.RadioJXL.com, which was to feature exclusive shows and mixes with top EDM producers and DJs, but the undertaking proved to be too expensive and time-consuming to continue. Subsequently, two downloadable albums were released from the site: &quot;7AM Ambient&quot; and &quot;7AM Dance&quot;.

===2004–08: &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Booming Back at You&quot;===

Holkenborg decided to relocate to Los Angeles in 2003, and in April 2006, released his fourth full-length album, &quot;Today&quot;, an album that reflected the personal and professional changes that were occurring in his life. &quot;Today&quot; features only one guest vocalist, Nathan Mader, and reverts to the more guitar-based sound of his first two albums. His fifth album, &quot;Booming Back at You&quot;, saw Holkenborg cultivate a stronger club sound punctuated by tracks like &quot;1967 Poem&quot;, featuring Steve Aoki. Many of the lyrics on the album were written in collaboration with Electrocute&#x27;s Nicole Morier, who appears in &quot;Mad Pursuit&quot;, &quot;Not Enough&quot;, and &quot;New Toy&quot;. The album was released on Artwerk Music, a joint venture between Nettwerk Music and video game company Electronic Arts, and peaked at 11 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Electronic Album chart. It was the first Junkie XL full-length to chart in the U.S., and featured the hit single, &quot;More&quot;, with Lauren Rocket. Rocket also contributed vocals to the Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; cover &quot;Cities in Dust&quot;.

===2012: &quot;Synthesized&quot;===
On 27 November 2012, Junkie XL released his sixth full-length album, entitled &quot;Synthesized&quot;. The album was preceded by a single EP for &quot;Molly&#x27;s E&quot;, which was released on 6 September and features remixes by Azari &amp; III and Canblaster. A second single, &quot;Gloria&quot; (with Fredrik Saroea of Datarock), was released on 23 October. Stylistically, &quot;Synthesized&quot; strikes a balance between the introspective sound of &quot;Today&quot; and the club-heavy sound of &quot;Booming Back at You&quot;, and features collaborations with Isis Salam (&quot;Off The Dancefloor&quot;), Tears for Fears&#x27; Curt Smith (&quot;When Enough is Not Enough&quot;), and Tommie Sunshine (&quot;Love Machine&quot;). The album also features a spoken word excerpt from Timothy Leary&#x27;s &quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot;, read by Leary, on the song &quot;Leave Behind Your Ego&quot;. A video for &quot;Off the Dancefloor&quot; was created by Japanese electro-pop band Trippple Nippples. The videos for &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Leave Behind Your Ego&quot; were directed by John Christopher Pina for Clean Sweep.

===Composing for film===
In collaboration with Harry Gregson-Williams, he contributed additional music to the Tony Scott film &quot;Domino&quot; (2005), and served as the composer for the Dutch film &quot;Blind&quot;, which was nominated for Best Original Music Score at the Netherlands Film Festival in 2007 and received the Grand Prix award for Best Original Music Score at the 2008 Aubagne International Film Festival. Holkenborg continues to work in the film and television industry, collaborating with composer Hans Zimmer as a sequencer programmer on Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;. The film marks the fourth scoring collaboration between Holkenborg and Zimmer, including &quot;Megamind&quot; (2010), &quot;Inception&quot; (2010) and &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (2012). Since moving into Zimmer&#x27;s Remote Control Productions studio, the two have worked together on many other musical projects, including &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, the reboot of the Superman franchise, and a remix of that year&#x27;s Academy Awards theme song. Holkenborg has provided music for the films &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Domino&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Shark Tale&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury&quot;, &quot;The Animatrix&quot;, and &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, and has had his original music featured in a number of major motion pictures, including &quot;Blade&quot; (&quot;Dealing with the Roster&quot;) and &quot;The Beach&quot; (&quot;Synaesthesia&quot;). In 2013, he composed the music for the Relativity Media film &quot;Paranoia&quot;. Shortly after, he was brought in by Zack Snyder, the producer of &quot;300: Rise of an Empire&quot;, to create the score for the film. He is credited as the composer for the 2014 film &quot;Divergent&quot;, with Hans Zimmer credited as &quot;Executive Producer&quot; for the soundtrack. He is a member of the Magnificent Six, a collaborative group of five other musicians, consisting of Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams, Johnny Marr (from The Smiths), Michael Einziger (from Incubus), Andrew Kawczynski, and Steve Mazzaro. The &quot;supergroup&quot; of artists ranging from diverse backgrounds teamed up to compose the score for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;. He was the primary composer for the 2015 film &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; and the 2016 film &quot;Deadpool&quot;, and was co-composer for the film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, along with Zimmer (who still wrote all the main themes, including the music for &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; which was later used in the film of the same name). Holkenborg was set to compose the music for the Snyder&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;Justice League&quot;, but was replaced by Danny Elfman when director Joss Whedon was brought on to finish the film. Holkenborg composed the scores for the 2018 film &quot;Mortal Engines&quot;, the 2019 films &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, the 2020 films &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Scoob!&quot;, the 2021 releases &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League, Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, and &quot;Army of the Dead&quot;, and the 2022 releases &quot;The 355&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, and &quot;Three Thousand Years of Longing&quot;.

===Composing for video games===
To go along with his numerous artist albums and EPs, Holkenborg has been creating original music for video games since the mid-1990s. In addition to composing the soundtrack for Xbox racing games &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot; and &quot;Quantum Redshift&quot;, Holkenborg is responsible for the &quot;SSX Blur&quot; soundtrack. He has also licensed a number of his album tracks for video game use. &quot;Future in Computer Hell (Part 2)&quot;, &quot;Synasthesia&quot;, and &quot;Dance USA&quot;—all taken from his album &quot;Big Sounds of the Drags&quot;—were licensed to the racing video game &quot;TD Overdrive: The Brotherhood of Speed&quot; (2002). The title track for &quot;Today&quot; is featured on the soundtrack for the video games &quot;Burnout Legends&quot; and &quot;Burnout Revenge&quot;, while &quot;More&quot;—taken from his fifth album, &quot;Booming Back at You&quot;—is featured on the soundtrack to EA Games&#x27; &quot;Need for Speed: ProStreet&quot;, which also includes a full score from Holkenborg. His cover of Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; &quot;Cities in Dust&quot; is featured on Electronic Arts&#x27; &quot;Burnout Paradise&quot;. He has written additional music for and licensed music to &quot;The Matrix: Path of Neo&quot;, &quot;Destroy All Humans!&quot;, &quot;The Sims 2: Nightlife&quot;, &quot;The Sims 3&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed: High Stakes&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed: Carbon&quot;, &quot;FIFA 08&quot;, and &quot;FIFA Street 3&quot;, among others. He composed the soundtrack for EA&#x27;s &quot;Darkspore&quot;.

===Remixes===

Holkenborg had made remixes—for both A-list pop superstars and lesser known artists. Highlights include work for Scissor Sisters (&quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;Land of a Thousand Words&quot;), Depeche Mode (&quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;), U.N.K.L.E. (&quot;Burn My Shadow&quot;), Justin Timberlake (&quot;What Goes Around&quot;), Fatboy Slim (&quot;Weapon of Choice&quot;), Coldplay (&quot;Talk&quot;), Bloc Party (&quot;Sunday&quot;), Michael Bublé (&quot;Sway&quot;), Avril Lavigne (&quot;Girlfriend&quot;), Daft Punk (&quot;The Grid&quot;), Madonna (&quot;4 Minutes&quot;), Fischerspooner (&quot;Emerge&quot;), and Hans Zimmer (&quot;Inception&quot; and &quot;Bombers Over Ibiza&quot;). His remix for Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Outrageous&quot; was used in the 2004 film &quot;Catwoman&quot;, and his remix of &quot;And Then We Kiss&quot; was featured on Spears&#x27; 2005 remix album &quot;B in the Mix: The Remixes&quot;. In 2008, he was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for his remix of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;4 Minutes&quot;. His remix of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; has gone to No. 1 in 24 countries.

===Commercial work===
Holkenborg&#x27;s music has also been featured in a number of international ad campaigns for major brands like Nike, Adidas, Heineken, and Cadillac. His remix of Eagles of Death Metal&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; was used in the 2008 Nike &quot;Take it to the Next Level&quot; commercial, which was directed by Guy Ritchie. &quot;Today&quot; was featured on ESPN commercials for Major League Soccer, while &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; provided the soundtrack to Nike&#x27;s 2002 World Cup campaign.

In 2003, Holkenborg created the musical theme of Dutch television channel Nederland 3.

==Personal life==
Holkenborg is an associate professor at the ArtEZ Conservatorium, one of the major art institutes in the Netherlands, where he teaches producing, remixing, and music composition. He resides in Tarzana, Los Angeles, California.

He uses the name JXL in cases where the term &quot;Junkie&quot; might cause offense. One example of this was with his biggest hit, a remix of the song &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; which was performed by Elvis Presley, a singer who toward the end of his life was addicted to prescription drugs and whose death in 1977 at the age of 42 was at least partially caused by them. Holkenborg says of his name: &quot;I called myself Junkie XL from the point of view that once you&#x27;re completely overworked, you never want to go there again. The &#x27;XL&#x27; stands for expanding limits; broadening up your vision.&quot;

<doc id="639274" wikidata="Q5908690" url="?curid=639274" title="Shining (video game series)">
<text>The series is a name of role-playing video games published by Sega, who owns the property. The first game, &quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot;, was a first-person dungeon crawler with randomly encountered, turn-based battles (comparable to &quot;Wizardry&quot; and &quot;Might and Magic&quot;). The next game released in the series was &quot;Shining Force&quot;, which was a turn-based strategy style tactical role-playing game with battle scenes acted out with sprites (comparable to &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;). Other directions include &quot;Shining Soul&quot;, a dungeon crawl action role-playing game with roguelike elements, and a number of traditional Japanese role-playing games. &quot;Shining Resonance Refrain&quot; was released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Steam PC and Nintendo Switch worldwide across 2018.

==Dungeon crawler titles==
In the dungeon crawler titles of the series (&quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot; and &quot;Shining the Holy Ark&quot;), the player takes control of an adventuring party. Battles work very similarly to those of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, and the fellow Sega RPG series &quot;Phantasy Star&quot;, in that they are first person and the player is placed in a position where the hero and team mates would be. &quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot; is the first game in the &quot;Shining&quot; series, and is a very simple labyrinth exploration game, with a simplified non explorable town and world map, where choices are made through a cursor system. &quot;Shining the Holy Ark&quot; was released immediately prior to &quot;Shining Force III&quot;, and while it is also a dungeon crawler, it features a far more expanded gameplay world over the first title.

==Strategy titles==
For the strategy games of the series (&quot;Shining Force&quot;, &quot;Shining Force Gaiden&quot;, &quot;Shining Force Gaiden 2&quot;, &quot;Shining Force II&quot;, &quot;Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict&quot;, &quot;Shining Force CD&quot;, &quot;Shining Force III&quot; and &quot;Shining Force Feather&quot;), the player takes charge of a party in large-scale, strategic battles. The games generally limit the number of characters who can enter any one battle at a time to about a dozen. The player controls unique characters with their own stats, as opposed to generic unit types.

==Action role-playing titles==
The third broad category of &quot;Shining&quot; games is the action role-playing game set of titles. This incorporates: &quot;Shining Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Shining Soul&quot;, &quot;Shining Soul II&quot;, &quot;Shining Force Neo&quot;, &quot;Shining Tears&quot;, &quot;Shining Force EXA,&quot; &quot;Shining Wind, Shining Force Cross and Shining Resonance&quot;. The games it incorporates do not necessarily have any noticeable similarity in gameplay. For instance, while &quot;Shining Tears&quot; uses similar mechanics to &quot;Shining Soul II&quot;, it has less in common with &quot;Shining Wisdom&quot; than it does with any of the strategy RPG titles of the series.

On 3 December 2009, &quot;Shining Force Cross&quot; was released as an arcade game for Sega&#x27;s RingEdge system board. It is a multiplayer role-playing game with support for up to eight players, both online and offline. Within one month, nearly 2,400 &quot;Shining Force Cross&quot; machines had been sold to arcade operators by December 31, 2009. A sequel has been released for the RingEdge arcade system in 2012, &quot;Shining Force Cross Illusion&quot;.

==Connections between games==
Each game in the series has a standalone story, meaning that it is not required to play its predecessors to better understand its storyline. Nevertheless, most installments of the series prior to &quot;Shining Soul I&quot; often reference each other or have characters carried over. For example, in &quot;Shining Wisdom&quot;, the elf-cleric Sarah and elf-mage Kazin from &quot;Shining Force II&quot; make an important appearance. &quot;Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict&quot; and &quot;Shining Force II&quot; are two of the most related games, having the largest number of characters and locations in common.

From &quot;Shining Soul I&quot; onward, installments of the series tend to have less significant connections. For instance, in &quot;Shining Tears&quot; a character mentions the Klantol Kingdom (the setting for &quot;Shining Soul II&quot;) and tells its geographic location, but there is no interaction with any of the characters or plot events of &quot;Shining Soul II&quot;. However, &quot;Shining Wind&quot; and &quot;Shining Tears&quot; are some of the most closely connected pair of games in the series, since the former is a direct sequel to the latter and features return appearances by nearly all of the major characters.

== Development history and reboot ==

=== Early history ===
Game producer Hiroyuki Takahashi left Enix with fellow &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; developer Kan Naito in April 1990 to found the game development studio Climax Entertainment. Under a production contract with Sega, Climax developed &quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot;, which was released for the Mega Drive in March 1991. With funding from Sega to continue work on the &quot;Shining&quot; series, Takahashi would register the studio Sonic! Software Planning as a subsidiary of Sega. Sonic supported Climax in the development of &quot;Shining Force&quot; and afterward become the primary developer of the series with credits for &quot;Shining Force II, Shining Force CD&quot;, and the Game Gear games &quot;Shining Force Gaiden&quot;, &quot;Shining Force Gaiden II&quot;, and &quot;Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict&quot;.

Hiroyuki Takahashi&#x27;s brother, Shugo Takahashi, founded Camelot Software Planning as an independent studio in April 1994 in order to develop games for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation, but Camelot would also provide development support to Sonic for &quot;Shining Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Shining the Holy Ark&quot;, and &quot;Shining Force III&quot;. By 1998, Sonic had ceased operations, and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Shining&quot; brand would not be used for any new games until 2002.

=== Reboot by Sega ===
After Sega quit the hardware market, it was decided to reboot the &quot;Shining&quot; franchise. In charge of the so called &quot;Shining Project&quot; was Sega employee Tadashi Takezaki who joined marketing in 1993 and in 2004 was not only in charge of the &quot;Shining&quot; series, but also the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; franchise and the official Japanese Sega website. According to Takezaki, when you think of Sega RPG&#x27;s, you think of &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; and &quot;Shining&quot;. While Phantasy Star never strictly had a V entry, it was rebooted in the form of &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;. The Shining series never had an entry on the Dreamcast, due to various developers being busy with other projects and it being thought that it would be better to launch a new RPG instead, among other reasons. However, looking at the Japanese video game market, RPG&#x27;s have the largest marketshare, so Sega decided to go ahead and restart the franchise, with a long-term plan, which included providing one game a year. This was new for Sega, people across different departments came together in 2001 to form what was called the &quot;Shining Committee&quot;. The Committee included Takezaki himself, but also Youichi Shimosato who produced &quot;Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon&quot; and &quot;Shining Force Neo&quot;, and also Tsuyoshi Sawada who produced &quot;Shining Tears&quot;. While the &quot;Force&quot; games were meant to harken back to the earlier titles, Tears was made from a completely blank slate for a modern audience, and looked at the &quot;Shining&quot; series from a new angle, much like &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; did.

==Games==
==Cancelled games==
==Reception==
The &quot;Shining Force&quot; installments of the series were the first tactical role-playing games to have significant success in the U.S.

In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the Genesis and Sega CD entries of the series (but not &quot;Shining Wisdom&quot; or any of the Game Gear installments) collectively as number 77 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. They lauded the series for replacing the then-standard generic RPG encounters with story-based battles, using an exciting character class system, and having brilliant pacing that keeps the games from ever dragging.

<text>The Principality or, from 1253, Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, also known as the Kingdom of Ruthenia or Kingdom of Rus&#x27;,also Kingdom of Halych–Volhynian was a medieval state in Eastern Europe which existed from 1199 to 1349. Its territory was predominantly located in modern-day Ukraine, with parts in Belarus, Poland, Moldova, and Lithuania. Along with Novgorod and Vladimir-Suzdal, it was one of the three most important powers to emerge from the collapse of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

Roman the Great united the principalities of Galicia and Volhynia at the turn of the 13th century. Following the destruction wreaked by the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; (1239–1241), Prince Daniel of Galicia and the other princes of Rus&#x27; pledged allegiance to Batu Khan of the Golden Horde in 1246. The Polish conquest of the kingdom in 1349 led to it being fully absorbed by Catholic Poland. Upon annexing it in 1349, Polish king Casimir III the Great adopted the title of King of Poland and Ruthenia, and the territory was transformed into the Ruthenian Voivodeship () in 1434.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The Principality of Volhynia may have emerged as early as the late 10th century, with Vsevolod, a son of Vladimir I of Kiev, mentioned as a prince of the city of Volodymyr. Igor Yaroslavich reportedly briefly reigned as the prince of Volodymyr in the 1050s. Iaroslav Sviatopolkovich () was the only prince in Kievan Rus&#x27; to oppose Vladimir II Monomakh&#x27;s reign on the grounds of agnatic seniority, but after Vladimir ousted him in 1118, his Monomakhovichi descendants established a local dynastic branch. Roman Mstislavich, the great-great-grandson of Monomakh, inherited the throne of Volhynia in 1170.

The Principality of Galicia was formed in the years 1124–1144 by Vladimirko Volodarovich&#x27;s unification of the principalities of Zvenyhorod, Peremyshl, and Terebovlia. Since the 1080s or 1090s, all three had been ruled by sons of prince Rostislav of Tmutarakan, who may or may not also have been a prince in Volhynia and Galicia 1054/1060 to 1067.

Both Volhynia and Galicia had experienced a remarkable economic development in the 12th century due to their commercial advantages. In part, this was because land trade routes in Asia Minor were severely disrupted due to the Byzantine–Seljuk wars (1046–1243), diverting numerous merchants coming from the east heading for Constantinople via Alexandria in Egypt, while others circumvented Anatolia via the port of Sudak (Sougdaia) in Crimea. The flourishing of the latter commercial hub soon attracted Kievan Rus&#x27; traders, who rerouted some of the would-be Byzantine goods (occasionally through itinerant Jewish merchants) to Poland, Hungary, Bohemia and Germany, via the towns of Volhynia and Galicia.

Their new status as transit hubs for commerce between the northern Black Sea ports and central Europe brought Galicia and Volodimer-in-Volhynia tremendous wealth and increasing political power in the late 12th century. Trade and salt mining in particular empowered the boyar class of Galicia, who were able to challenge and undermine the authority of the Rostislavichi princes. Galicia and Volhynia merged around 1198 or 1199 into the principality of Galicia–Volhynia. This happened when the local Galician branch of the Rostislavichi clan died out, and Roman Mstislavich of Volhynia also took possession of Galicia, establishing a dynastic union.

=== Reign of Roman the Great (1199–1205) ===
Galicia–Volhynia was created following the death in 1198 or 1199 (and without a recognized heir in the paternal line) of the last Prince of Galicia, Vladimir II Yaroslavich. Roman acquired the Principality of Galicia and united his lands into one state. He did so upon the invitation of the boyars of Galician boyars, who expected that Roman would be an &quot;absentee&quot; Volhynian prince ruling from afar so that they could increase their own power. On the contrary, Roman curbed their power, expelled any boyar who opposed him, and increased the influence of the urban and rural populace.

In Roman&#x27;s time Galicia–Volhynia&#x27;s principal cities were Halych and Volodymyr. Roman was allied with Poland, signed a peace treaty with Hungary and developed diplomatic relations with the Byzantine Empire. The grand prince of Kiev, Rurik Rostislavich (Rurik II), forged a coalition of Rus&#x27; princes and attacked Galicia-Volhynia, but Roman defeated them and captured Kiev in 1200. However, because the old capital of Kievan Rus&#x27; was no longer a strong power centre by that time, Roman kept the prosperous Halych as his capital and appointed subordinates to administer Kiev in his name. He then mounted two successful campaigns against the Cumans, in 1201–2 and 1203–4. In 1203 Roman also extended his rule to the Principality of Pereyaslavl. During his absence, Rurik II retook and heavily sacked Kiev in 1203 with the help of Polovtsians and Chernihivians. In 1204 Roman recaptured Kiev once more, marking the height of his reign: he briefly became the most powerful of the Rus&#x27; princes. He married the niece of the Byzantine emperor Alexios III, for whom Galicia was the main military ally against the Cumans. The relation with Byzantium helped to stabilize Galicia&#x27;s relations with the Rus&#x27; population of the Lower Dniester and the Lower Danube.

=== War of succession (1205–1245) ===

In 1205, Roman&#x27;s alliance with the Poles broke down, leading to a conflict with Leszek the White and Konrad of Masovia. Roman was subsequently killed by Polish forces in the Battle of Zawichost (1205), triggering a war of succession, while his dominion entered a period of rebellion and chaos that lasted almost 40 years. In this time, the Galician boyars made efforts to prevent the establishment of a hereditary princely dynasty, especially by Roman&#x27;s son Daniel, and instead put all sorts of puppets on the throne which they could easily control. Thus weakened by war between Galician boyars and some appanage princes, Galicia–Volhynia also became an arena of rivalry between Poland and Hungary, which intervened in the region several times. Roman&#x27;s successors would mostly use Halych (Galicia) as the designation of their combined kingdom. King Andrew II of Hungary styled himself &quot;&quot;, Latin for &quot;king of Galicia and Vladimir [in-Volhynia]&quot;, a title that was later adopted by the House of Habsburg.

After Roman&#x27;s death, the Galician boyars first drove Roman&#x27;s widow Anna-Euphrosyne and two sons Daniel and Vasylko from the region. From 1206 to 1212, the Principality of Galicia was controlled by the three sons of the Novgorod-Seversk prince Igor Svyatoslavich: Vladimir III Igorevich, Svyatoslav III Igorevich, and Roman II Igorevich. They were defeated by Galician boyars, and the boyar assumed the throne of Galicia in 1213 or 1214, the only non-Rurikid ever to rule any of the Rus&#x27; principalities. After he was removed, a compromise agreement was concluded in 1214 between Hungary and Poland, who partitioned the Galician lands. The throne of Galicia–Volhynia was given to Andrew&#x27;s son, Coloman of Lodomeria, who had married Leszek the White&#x27;s daughter, Salomea.

In 1221, Mstislav Mstislavich, son of Mstislav Rostislavich (descendant of the princes of Novgorod), liberated Galicia–Volhynia from the Hungarians and Poles. During Mstislav&#x27;s 1221–1228 reign, the Galician and Volhynian armies participated in the Battle of the Kalka River (1223) against the Mongols, but in 1228 the boyars expelled him and transferred the Principality of Galicia to the king of Hungary. It was Daniel of Galicia, son of Roman, who formed a real union of Volhynia and Galicia. Daniel first established himself in Volhynia. After failing to retake his father&#x27;s other throne in 1230–1232 and 1233–1235, Daniel succeeded upon his third attempt and conquered Galicia in 1238, reunited Galician and Volhynia, and ruled for a quarter century. In March 1238, he defeated the Teutonic Knights of the Order of Dobrzyń in the . Daniel captured Kiev in 1239,
just before the Mongols besieged, conquered and sacked the city in late 1240. On 17 August 1245, Daniel and his brother Vasylko defeated the Polish and Hungarian forces (weakened by the first Mongol invasion of Poland and the first Mongol invasion of Hungary in early 1241) in the (Jarosław), taking full control of Galicia–Volhynia. The brothers also crushed their ally Rostislav Mikhailovich, son of the prince of Chernigov.

=== Reign of Daniel (1245–1264) ===

Daniel strengthened his relations with Batu Khan by traveling to his capital Sarai and acknowledging, at least nominally, the supremacy of the Mongol Golden Horde. After meeting with Batu Khan in 1246, Daniel reorganized his army along Mongol lines and equipped it with Mongolian weapons, although Daniel himself maintained the traditional attire of a Rus&#x27; prince. According to Vernadsky (1970), Daniel&#x27;s alliance with the Mongols was merely tactical; he pursued a long-term strategy of resistance to the Mongols. On the other hand, Magocsi (2010) argued that Daniel submitted to the Mongols, citing the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot;, which decried Daniel &#x27;is now on his knees and is called a slave&#x27; and called this event &#x27;the greatest disgrace&#x27;. Magocsi stated that, &#x27;although he never acknowledged it&#x27;, Daniel was a Mongol vassal, who collected the Mongol tribute, and generally helped &#x27;establishing Mongol administrative control over eastern Europe in cooperation with those Rus&#x27; princes who could be made to see the advantages of the new Pax Mongolica.&#x27; According to Magocsi, Daniel&#x27;s submission to the Mongols ensured the strength and prosperity of Galicia–Volhynia. He did renew his alliances with Hungary, Poland and Lithuania, making plans to forge an anti-Mongol coalition with them to wage a crusade against the Khan; although these were never carried out, it would eventually lead to Daniel&#x27;s royal coronation by papal legate in 1253. This brought Galicia–Volhynia into the orbit of the western European feudal order, and the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1245, Pope Innocent IV allowed Daniel to be crowned king. Daniel wanted more than recognition, commenting bitterly that he expected an army when he received the crown. Although Daniel promised to promote recognition of the Pope to his people, his realm continued to be ecclesiastically independent from Rome. Thus, Daniel was the only member of the Rurik dynasty to have been crowned king. Daniel was crowned by the papal legate Opizo de Mezzano in Dorohochyn 1253 as the first King of Ruthenia (&quot;Rex Russiae&quot;; 1253–1264). In 1256, Daniel succeeded in driving the Mongols out of Volhynia, and a year later he defeated their attempts to capture the cities of Lutsk and Volodymyr. Upon the approach of a large army under the Mongolian general Boroldai in 1260; however, Daniel was forced to accept their authority and to raze the fortifications he had built against them.

Under Daniel&#x27;s reign, the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia was one of the most powerful states in east central Europe, and it has been described as a &#x27;golden age&#x27; for Galicia–Volhynia. Literature flourished, producing the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot;. Demographic growth was enhanced by immigration from the west and the south, including Germans and Armenians. Commerce developed due to trade routes linking the Black Sea with Poland, Germany, and the Baltic basin. Major cities, which served as important economic and cultural centers, included Lviv (where the royal seat would later be moved by Daniel&#x27;s son), Volodymyr, Halych, Kholm (Daniel&#x27;s capital), Peremyshl, Dorohychyn, and Terebovlya. Galicia–Volhynia was important enough that in 1252, Daniel was able to marry his son Roman to Gertrude of Babenberg, heiress of the Duchy of Austria, in the vain hope of securing the latter for his family. Another son, Shvarn, married a daughter of Mindaugas, Lithuania&#x27;s first king, and briefly ruled that land from 1267 to 1269. At the peak of its expansion, the Galician–Volhynian state contained not only south-western Rus lands, including Red Ruthenia and Black Ruthenia, but also briefly controlled the Brodnici on the Black Sea.

=== Reign of Leo I (1264–1301) ===

After Daniel&#x27;s death in 1264, he was succeeded by his son Leo, who moved the capital from Chełm to Lviv in 1272 and for a time maintained the strength of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. Unlike his father, who pursued a Western political course, Leo worked closely with the Mongols, in particular cultivating a close alliance with the Tatar Khan Nogai. Together with his Mongol allies, he invaded Poland. However, although his troops plundered territory as far west as Racibórz, sending many captives and much booty back to Galicia, Leo did not ultimately gain much territory from Poland. Leo also attempted, unsuccessfully, to establish his family&#x27;s rule over Lithuania. Soon after his brother Shvarn ascended to the Lithuanian throne in 1267, he had the former Lithuanian ruler Vaišvilkas killed. Following Shvarn&#x27;s loss of the throne in 1269, Leo entered into conflict with Lithuania. From 1274 to 1276 he fought a war with the new Lithuanian ruler Traidenis but was defeated, and Lithuania annexed the territory of Black Ruthenia with its city Navahrudak. In 1279, Leo allied himself with king Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and invaded Poland, although his attempt to capture Kraków in 1280 ended in failure. That same year, Leo defeated Hungary and annexed part of Transcarpathia, including the city of Mukachevo. In 1292, he defeated fragmented Poland and added Lublin with surrounding areas to the territory of his kingdom.

=== Decline (1301–1340) ===

After Leo&#x27;s death in 1301, a period of decline ensued. Leo was succeeded by his son Yuri I, who ruled for only seven years. Although his reign was largely peaceful and the Galicia–Volhynia flourished economically, Yuri I lost Lublin to the Poles in 1302. From 1308 to 1323, Galicia–Volhynia was jointly ruled by Yuri I&#x27;s sons Andrew and Leo II, who proclaimed themselves to be the kings of Galicia–Volhynia. The brothers forged alliances with King Władysław I of Poland and the Teutonic Order against the Lithuanians and the Mongols, but the Kingdom was still tributary to the Mongols and joined the Mongol military expeditions of Uzbeg Khan and his successor, Janibeg Khan. The brothers died together in 1323, in battle, fighting against the Mongols, and left no heirs.

After the extinction of the Rurikid dynasty in Galicia–Volhynia in 1323, Volhynia passed into the control of the Lithuanian prince Liubartas, while the boyars took control over Galicia. They invited the Polish prince Yuri II Boleslav, a grandson of Yuri I, to assume the Galician throne. Boleslaw converted to Orthodoxy and assumed the name Yuri II. His encouragement of foreign colonization led to conflicts with the boyars, who then poisoned him in 1340 and offered the throne to Liubartas, within the same year Casimir III of Poland attacked Lviv.

=== Final years and aftermath (1341–1392) ===

In winter 1341 Tatars, Ruthenians led by Detko, and Lithuanians led by Liubartas were able to defeat the Poles, although they were not so successful in summer 1341. Finally, Detko was forced to accept Polish overlordship, as a &quot;starost&quot; of Galicia. After Detko&#x27;s death, Casimir III mounted a successful invasion, capturing and annexing Galicia in 1349.The Romanovichi (branch of the Rurikid) dynasty of Daniel of Galicia attempted to gain support from Pope Benedict XII and broader European powers for an alliance against the Mongols, but ultimately proved unable to compete with the rising powers of the centralised Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland. Only in 1349, after the occupation of Galicia–Volhynia by an allied Polish-Hungarian force, was Galicia–Volhynia finally conquered and incorporated into Poland. This ended the vassalage of Galicia–Volhynia to the Golden Horde.From 1340 to 1392, the civil war in the region transitioned into a power struggle between Lithuania, Poland, and Hungary. The first stage of conflict led to the signing of a treaty in 1344 that secured the Principality of Peremyshl for the Crown of Poland, while the rest of the territory belonged to a member of the Gediminid dynasty of Liubartas. Eventually by the mid-14th century, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania divided up the region between them: King Casimir III took Galicia and Western Volhynia, while the sister state of Eastern Volhynia together with Kiev came under Lithuanian control, 1352–66.

Following the death of Casimir the Great in 1370, Galicia–Volhynia was ruled by Vladislaus II of Opole in 1372–1379 and 1385–1387, as Lord of Ruthenia (&quot;Terre Russie Domin&quot;), being a descendant of princes of Belz and a subject of King Louis I of Hungary. Vladislaus strongly contributed to the establishment of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv as part of Polish Catholicisation.

==Geography==
Geographically, western Galicia–Volhynia extended between the rivers San and Wieprz in what is now south-eastern Poland, while its eastern territories covered the Pripet Marshes (now in Belarus) and the upper reaches of the Southern Bug river in modern-day Ukraine. During its history, Galicia-Volhynia was bordered by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Principality of Turov-Pinsk, the Principality of Kiev, the Golden Horde, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Kingdom of Poland, Moldavia and the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights.

== Historical role ==

The &quot;Galician-Volhynian Chronicle&quot; reflected the political programme of the Romanovich dynasty ruling Galicia–Volhynia. Galicia–Volhynia competed with other successor states of Kievan Rus&#x27; (notably Vladimir-Suzdal) to claim the Kievan inheritance. According to the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot;, King Daniel was the last ruler of Kiev preceding the Mongolian invasion and thus Galicia–Volhynia&#x27;s rulers were the only legitimate successors to the Kievan throne. Until the end of Galician-Volhynian state, its rulers advanced claims upon &quot;all the land of Rus&#x27;.&quot; The seal of King Yuri I contained the Latin inscription &quot;domini georgi regis rusie.&quot;

In contrast to their consistent secular or political claims to the Kievan inheritance, Galicia&#x27;s rulers were not concerned by religious succession. This differentiated them from their rivals in Vladimir-Suzdal, who sought to, and attained, control over the Kievan Church. Rather than contest Vladimir-Suzdal&#x27;s dominance of the Kievan Church, the Ruthenian rulers merely asked for and obtained a separate Church from Byzantium.

Galicia–Volhynia also differed from the northern and eastern principalities of the former Kievan Rus&#x27; in terms of its relationship with its western neighbors. King Danylo was alternatively an ally or a rival with neighboring Slavic Poland and partially Slavic Hungary. According to historian George Vernadsky (1970), the kingdoms of Ruthenia, Poland and Hungary belonged to the same psychological and cultural world. The Roman Catholic Church was seen as a neighbor and there was much intermarriage between the princely houses of Galicia and those of neighboring Catholic countries. In contrast, the Westerners faced by Alexander, prince of Novgorod, were the Teutonic Knights, and the northeastern Rus experience of the West was that of hostile crusaders rather than peers.

In Ukrainian historiography, the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia played an important role, uniting the western and southern branches of East Slavs and consolidating their identity, and becoming a new center of political and economic life after the decline of Kiev.

<text>The Ages of Man are the historical stages of human existence according to Greek mythology and its subsequent Roman interpretation.

Both Hesiod and Ovid offered accounts of the successive ages of humanity, which tend to progress from an original, long-gone age in which humans enjoyed a nearly divine existence to the current age of the writer, in which humans are beset by innumerable pains and evils. In the two accounts that survive from Ancient Greece and Rome, this degradation of the human condition over time is indicated symbolically with metals of successively decreasing value (but increasing hardness).

==Hesiod&#x27;s Five Ages==


The Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) outlined his Five Ages in his poem &quot;Works and Days&quot; (lines 109–201). His list is:
* Golden Age – The Golden Age is the only age that falls within the rule of Cronus. Created by the immortals who live on Olympus, these humans were said to live among the gods and freely mingled with them. Peace and harmony prevailed during this age. Humans did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to very old age but with a youthful appearance and eventually died peacefully. Their spirits live on as &quot;guardians&quot;. Plato in Cratylus (397e) recounts the golden race of men who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean men literally made of gold, but good and noble. He describes these men as daemons upon the Earth. Since δαίμονες (&quot;daimones&quot;) is derived from δαήμονες (&quot;daēmones&quot;, meaning knowing or wise), they are beneficent, preventing ills, and guardians of mortals.
* Silver Age – The Silver Age and every age that follows fall within the rule of Cronus&#x27;s successor and son, Zeus. Men in the Silver Age lived for one hundred years under the dominion of their mothers. They lived only a short time as grown adults, and spent that time in strife with one another. During this Age, men refused to worship the gods and Zeus destroyed them for their impiety. After death, humans of this age became &quot;blessed spirits&quot; of the underworld.
* Bronze Age – This age is also sometimes known as the &quot;Copper Age&quot; or Brazen Age. Men of the Bronze Age were hardened and tough, as war was their purpose and passion. Zeus created these humans out of the ash tree. Their armor was forged of bronze, as were their homes and tools. The men of this Age were undone by their own violent ways and left no named spirits; instead, they dwell in the &quot;dark house of Hades&quot;. This Age came to an end with the flood of Deucalion.
* Heroic Age – The Heroic Age is the one age that does not correspond with any metal. It is also the only age that improves upon the age it follows. It was the heroes of this Age who fought at Thebes and Troy. This race of humans died and went to Elysium.
* Iron Age – Hesiod finds himself in the Iron Age. During this age, humans live an existence of toil and misery. Children dishonor their parents, brother fights with brother, and the social contract between guest and host (xenia) is forgotten. During this age, might makes right, and bad men use lies to be thought good. At the height of this age, humans no longer feel shame or indignation at wrongdoing; babies will be born with gray hair and the gods will have completely forsaken humanity: &quot;there will be no help against evil.&quot;

==Ovid&#x27;s Four Ages==
The Roman poet Ovid (1st century BC – 1st century AD) tells a similar myth of Four Ages in Book 1.89–150 of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. His account is similar to Hesiod&#x27;s, with the exception that he omits the Heroic Age. Ovid emphasizes that justice and peace defined the Golden Age. He adds that in this age, men did not yet know the art of navigation and therefore did not explore the larger world. Further, no man had knowledge of any arts but primitive agriculture. In the Silver Age, Jupiter introduces the seasons, and men consequently learn the art of agriculture and architecture. In the Bronze Age, Ovid writes, men were prone to warfare, but not impiety. Finally, in the Iron Age, men demarcate nations with boundaries; they learn the arts of navigation and mining; they are warlike, greedy, and impious. Truth, modesty, and loyalty are nowhere to be found.

==Related usage==
These mythological ages are sometimes associated with historical timelines. In the chronology of Saint Jerome, the Golden Age lasts c. 1710 to 1674 BC, the Silver Age 1674 to 1628 BC, the Bronze Age 1628 to 1472 BC, the Heroic Age 1460 to 1103 BC, while Hesiod&#x27;s Iron Age was considered as still ongoing by Saint Jerome in the fourth century AD.

Modern historical periodisation such as the Three-age system has reappropriated the terms Bronze Age and Iron Age to describe archaeological periods following the Stone Age based on predominant metallurgical practices. Congruently, the term Golden Age is used to describe a civilization during a historical highpoint, for example the Golden Age of India, Islamic Golden Age and the Han and Tang dynasties of China.

<text>The Goseck Circle (German: &quot;Sonnenobservatorium Goseck&quot;) is a Neolithic structure in Goseck in the Burgenlandkreis district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. 

Its construction is dated to approximately 4900 B.C., and appears to have remained in use until about 4700 B.C. Thus, it may be the oldest and best known of the circular enclosures associated with the Central European Neolithic. Currently, the site is presented officially by the state archaeologists and the local association that looks after it as a ritual or cult structure. 

The circle consists of a concentric ditch 75 metres (246 feet) across and two palisade rings containing entrances in places aligned with sunrise and sunset on the winter solstice days and smaller entrances aligned with the summer solstice. Marketing materials have described the site as one of the oldest &quot;Solar observatories&quot; in the world, but sunrise and sunset during winter and summer solstices are the only evident astronomical alignments emphasized in the remains of the structure. 

The existence of the site was made public in August 2003. It was opened for visitors in December 2005.

==Geography==
===Location===
The site is located on farmland near Goseck, in the &quot;Burgenlandkreis&quot; of Saxony-Anhalt, between Naumburg and Weißenfels. The circle sits on a piece of land that gradually rises toward the south, not far from where the Unstrut flows into the Saale, at the border of the region known as Leipzig Bay.

==History==

=== Discovery and excavation ===
The circle was discovered in 1991 by Otto Braasch on an aerial survey photograph that showed circular ridges under a wheat field. The cropmarks were easy to see in a season of drought. The structure&#x27;s visibility also indicated an advanced state of erosion. 

To preserve the endangered remains, the &quot;Landesamt für Denkmalpflege und Archäologie Sachsen-Anhalt&quot; decided to conduct an excavation. It cooperated with the Institute for Prehistoric Archaeology of the University of Halle-Wittenberg. 

François Bertemes and Peter Biehl began a major excavation of the site in 2002. When archaeologists combined the evidence with GPS observations, they noticed that the two southern openings marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstices.

Radiocarbon dating places the construction of the site close to 4900 B.C., while the style of the pottery shards associate it with the stroke-ornamented ware culture of ca. 4700 B.C., suggesting that the site remained in use throughout two or three centuries.

Excavators also found the remains of what may have been ritual fires, animal and human bones, and a headless skeleton near the southeastern gate, that could be interpreted as evidence of a specific burial ritual or of human sacrifice. 

Bertemes and Biehl continued the excavation for a few weeks each year. In 2004, a group from the University of California, Berkeley joined the ongoing dig. 

Since the end of the excavation, the site has been reconstructed. Archaeologists and state officials have rebuilt the wooden palisade of the circle using 1,675 oak poles with a height of 2.5 m. Woodworkers worked with hand tools so that the wooden posts would look authentic. The site was opened to the public on 21 December 2005, the day of the winter solstice.

==Description==

The site is surrounded by a circular v-shaped moat of up to 1.8 m depth. The soil was used to create a rampart on the outside. The diameter of the moat is 75 m, measured from its external border. A double wooden palisade stood inside the moat. No traces of internal buildings were found. Entry to the site was via three symmetrical main entrances to the north, southwest, and southeast. In addition there were small gaps in the palisades allowing access. The moat followed the three main entries outward (see diagram). The entrances in the inner palisade were narrower than those in the outer, which in turn, were narrower than the gap in the moat.

The southwestern and southeastern entrances face the direction of sunset and sunrise around the date of the winter solstice. Two of the smaller breaks in the wall face toward the equivalent direction on the summer solstice.

There is no sign of fire or of other destruction. Why the site was abandoned is unknown. Later villagers built a defensive moat following the ditches of the old enclosure.

==Astronomical alignment and interpretation==

The Goseck ring is one of the best preserved and extensively investigated of the many similar structures built around the same time. Approximately 140 of these structures, known as circular enclosures, have been found. Although they all have unique features, they follow a basic architectural principle. Few of them have been excavated.

During a ceremony at the first opening of this site to the public, state archaeologist Harald Meller called it &quot;a milestone in archaeological research&quot;.

Its construction is dated to approximately 4900 B.C., and it seems to have remained in use until about 4700 B.C. This corresponds to the transitional phase between the Neolithic Linear Pottery and Stroke-ornamented ware cultures. The site is one of a larger group of circular enclosures in the Elbe and Danube region, most of which show similar solstice alignments.

There has been some debate about whether the site was used to monitor the sun throughout the year or only on specific notable days, and thus about whether calling the site a &quot;solar observatory&quot; is appropriate. It has been suggested that the inaccurate name was adopted primarily for marketing purposes.
Archaeologist Ralf Schwarz suggests the structures at the site allowed coordinating an easily judged lunar calendar with the more demanding measurements of a solar calendar through calendar calculations.

==Today==
The reconstructed site is open to the public. An information point has been opened at nearby &quot;Schloss Goseck&quot;, featuring an exhibit and information on the excavations. The site is maintained by the &quot;Verein Gosecker Sonnenobservatorium e.V.&quot;.

Goseck is a stop on the tourist route, &quot;Himmelswege&quot;, linking archaeological sites in Saxony-Anhalt.

<text>The Parti républicain/Republican Party was a Quebec-based Canadian political party that nominated two candidates in federal by-elections in 1971. None were elected.

The party nominated two candidates in by-elections held on 31 May 1971. In Chambly riding, leader Claude Longtin won 396 votes, (1.6% of the total), and in Trois-Rivières, Joseph Thibodeau won 170 votes (0.6%).

In June 1971, the party merged with the Parti de la Démocratisation Économique. Longtin later ran as an independent in the 1972 federal election in the riding of Chambly, receiving 474 votes (0.9%).

In 2021, Rob Carbone adopted the name for his own unregistered political party during the 2019 federal election, a group previously known as the Progressive Party.

<text>You Got Served is a 2004 American dance drama film written and directed by Chris Stokes, who was also the business manager of the performers who were the film&#x27;s main characters: recording artist Marques Houston and the boy band B2K. The plot follows a group of dancers who take part in a street dancing competition. &quot;You Got Served&quot; was produced by Marcus Morton, Cassius Vernon Weathersby, Billy Pollina, and Kris Cruz Toledo, and filming took place Between May 1, 2003, and June 25, 2003. The Sony Pictures division Screen Gems released the film on January 30, 2004—the weekend of Super Bowl XXXVIII. It opened at #1 at the box office during its opening weekend, and grossed $16 million in its first week.

Despite negative reviews from critics, the film was a financial success, grossing over $50 million against an $8 million budget. It was followed by one sequel, &quot;You Got Served: Beat the World&quot; (2011).

==Plot==

In Los Angeles, California, Elgin and David lead their promising dance crew in street dancing battles at a warehouse owned by Mr. Rad, where they defeat another crew led by Vick (Raz-B). David and Elgin&#x27;s crew consists of notably: Rico (J-Boog), Rashaan (Lil&#x27; Fizz), and Sonny (Young Rome). Rico takes care of a little kid he knows named Teshawn, whom the crew calls &quot;Lil Saint&quot;.

To earn money for the battles, David and Elgin deliver for a drug lord named Emerald. They are challenged by Wade, a rich kid from Orange County, for $5,000. After winning another battle, David and Elgin tell their crew about the challenge they received from Wade. They mention that the 2 of them will put up the whole $5,000, and if their team wins, Elgin and David will split $3,000 and the other members of the crew will split the remaining $2,000. Their crew member Sonny is not fond of this idea and believes that because it is a team performance, the entire team should split the $5,000 evenly. All of the other members disagree with Sonny and understand that because Elgin and David are the ones putting up the money in the first place, it makes sense that they get a bigger cut of the profits.

Later on while Elgin, David and their crew are playing basketball, Wade and his best friend Max show up to the court and tell Elgin that they&#x27;re surprised that he accepted their challenge. Elgin declares that the battle will be held a week later, but Wade and Max laugh at him and bait him in, claiming it&#x27;s pathetic that Elgin and his crew needs an entire week to practice and that the battle should be held that night. Feeling prideful and not wanting to back down, Elgin accepts the challenge to compete that night, even though he and David they only have $3,500 at the moment. Thus, Elgin decides to borrow the remaining $1,500 from his grandmother for the battle.

Due to the amount of money on the line, Mr. Rad announces there will be no fighting during the battle and hires an off duty LAPD officer named Mr. Chuck to stop any potential ruckus. Upon arriving at the venue, David and Elgin realize that Sonny is not there, and he is also not picking up his cell phone. A few minutes later, Sonny arrives but he betrays the team and walks over to Wade and Max&#x27;s side of the dance floor, revealing that he&#x27;s now on their team. A fight breaks out after David and Elgin realize their opponent has stolen their dance set and that Sonny taught their opponents the routine, effectively “selling them out.” Crowing over his success, Wade delivers the titular line, &quot;You&#x27;re just mad... &#x27;cause tonight you suckers got served!&quot;

As the days go on, David has been getting romantically closer to Liyah, Elgin&#x27;s sister. While discussing their loss to Wade on the basketball court, Elgin and David decide that they have to pick up some extra shifts for Emerald to recoup their losses. Vick arrives and asks to join their crew and says that his crew disbanded after repeatedly losing battles. David leaves the court and tells Elgin that instead of picking him up so that they can go to Emerald&#x27;s spot that night, David will meet him up there separately, as he has something to do at the moment. That &quot;something to do&quot; turns out to be going on a date with Liyah. While on a date, David gets excessive calls from his friends, to the annoyance of Liyah. Elgin gets a call from Emerald for a delivery of drugs and says that he and David need to come in earlier. When Elgin tries to call David, Liyah turns off David&#x27;s phone before David can see who&#x27;s calling, leaving Elgin to do the job himself. Elgin is ambushed by local thugs who take Emerald&#x27;s money, leaving Elgin hospitalized, in trouble with Emerald, and furious at David for not showing up on time. The friends split up and form their own crews. Elgin forbids Liyah to see David, ignoring her and David&#x27;s desire to help him.

Rico tells David and Elgin about the &quot;Big Bounce&quot;, a $50,000 dance competition purportedly sponsored by MTV, which will provide the winning crew the opportunity to perform in a Lil&#x27; Kim video. Elgin sees this as a way to pay back Emerald and his grandmother. Attempts to bring Elgin and David together, particularly by Liyah and Rico, are unsuccessful. Later on, Emerald and his guards approach Elgin at his grandmother&#x27;s home and throw Elgin inside the car. Emerald fires Elgin from ever working for him again and gives Elgin a few weeks to return his money to him, warning Elgin that if he doesn&#x27;t pay him back, he “won&#x27;t walk, let alone dance again”. Emerald reveals that he usually gives people only 24 hours to return any stolen money from him, but he decided to give Elgin a few weeks because David called Emerald and begged him not to hurt Elgin.

At the Big Bounce Competition, many crews impress the judges in the qualifying rounds, including Wade&#x27;s crew. Liyah talks with Mr. Rad about David and Elgin&#x27;s problems, and Mr. Rad reveals that he has already taken care of the situation with Emerald (it is not revealed what he did exactly to fix it, he only mentions that he and his LAPD friend Mr. Chuck &quot;took care of that already&quot;). David&#x27;s crew is eliminated after two slip-ups, while Elgin&#x27;s crew makes it to the finals.

David and Liyah are then in a diner talking about David being eliminated from the competition. Rashann runs in to tell them that Lil Saint has been shot and they need to find Rico to tell him the news and head to the hospital. At the hospital, the crew finds out that Lil Saint has died after being shot in a drive-by. The next day, Rico tells Elgin that they should reunite the crew in honor of Lil&#x27; Saint. David arrives a few minutes later, asked by Liyah to try to end the feud, but explains that by the rules of the competition, they must compete with their initial crews and are not allowed to add members. David and Elgin still refuse to forgive each other.

Elgin&#x27;s crew, renamed &quot;The Lil&#x27; Saints&quot;, compete at the Big Bounce finals, hosted by Wade Robson and Lil&#x27; Kim. After multiple crews perform their routine, the winner is revealed to be a tie between &quot;The Lil&#x27; Saints&quot; and &quot;Wade&#x27;s Crew&quot;. Both crews refuse a tie, and Lil&#x27; Kim (advised by Mr. Rad), declares a head-to-head battle competition, with no rules. The no-rules effect allows other people to join the battling crews. David asks to join Elgin&#x27;s crew, and although Elgin initially refuses, Rico responds by saying &quot;Look, it&#x27;s either David and all of us, or it&#x27;s none of us&quot;. Elgin then forgives and allows David on his team.

They battle Wade&#x27;s crew, dedicating the battle to Lil&#x27; Saint, and win after receiving the crowd&#x27;s loudest approval. Elgin gives his blessing for David and Liyah to be together. Wade and Max confront the winners saying that David and Elgin got lucky by winning. David replies, &quot;Y&#x27;all just mad, &#x27;cause today, &quot;you&quot; suckas got served.&quot; As the crowd chants &quot;served&quot;, Wade and Max leave in shame and David and Elgin celebrate their victory with their friends and family while holding their $50,000 check.

<doc id="639328" wikidata="Q1939191" url="?curid=639328" title="Stevie Wonder's Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;">
<text>Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot; is an album by Stevie Wonder, originally released on the Tamla Motown label on October 30, 1979. It is the soundtrack to the documentary &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;, directed by Walon Green, which was based on the book of the same name by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird. It contains two singles that reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts: &quot;Send One Your Love&quot; (No. 4) and the minor hit &quot;Outside My Window&quot; (No. 52). The single &quot;Black Orchid&quot; reached No. 63 in the UK.

== Production ==
Wonder created the film score by having Michael Braun, the film&#x27;s producer, describe each visual image in detail, while the sound engineer, Gary Olazabal, specified the length of a passage. This information was processed to a four-track tape (with the film&#x27;s sound on one of the tracks), leaving Wonder space to add his own musical accompaniment. Wonder attempted to translate the complex information of the book and film into song lyrics. &quot;Same Old Story,&quot; for example, tries to convey the scientific findings of Jagadish Chandra Bose, who developed instruments to measure plants&#x27; response to stimuli, and the breakthroughs of African-American agriculturalist George Washington Carver. While written mostly by Stevie Wonder, some songs were collaborations with Syreeta Wright, Yvonne Wright, and Michael Sembello.

&quot;Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;&quot; contained new synthesizer combinations, including the first use of a digital sampling synthesizer, the Computer Music Melodian, used in most tracks of this album. &quot;Journey&quot; is an early digital recording, released three months after Ry Cooder&#x27;s &quot;Bop till You Drop&quot;, generally believed to be the first digitally recorded popular music album, with this album being the second. Stevie Wonder was an early adherent of the technology and used it for all his subsequent recordings. The music was recorded onto U-matic video tapes using a Sony PCM-1600 digital PCM adaptor, and edited with a digital controller also from Sony.

== Packaging ==
Tamla/Motown originally released the album as a double LP in a tri-fold sleeve. The front cover was embossed, and following Wonder&#x27;s recent trend of printing Braille messages on his albums, the cover illustration was captioned below in Braille for blind readers:
⠄⠁⠃⠧ ⠯ ⠔⠎⠊⠙⠑ ⠮ ⠑⠍⠃⠕⠎⠎⠫ ⠎⠟⠥⠜⠑ ⠊⠎ ⠮ ⠳⠞⠇⠔⠑ ⠷ ⠁ ⠋⠇⠪⠻ ⠾ ⠧⠑⠔⠫ ⠇⠂⠧⠑⠎⠲&lt;br&gt;⠠⠌⠑⠧⠊⠑ ⠠⠺⠕⠝⠙⠻⠄⠎ ⠄⠚⠳⠗⠝⠑⠽ ⠄⠐⠹ ⠠⠮ ⠠⠎⠑⠉⠗⠑⠞ ⠠⠇⠊⠋⠑ ⠷ ⠠⠰⠏⠇⠁⠝⠞⠎⠲&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Above and inside the embossed square is the outline of a flower with veined leaves. Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Journey Through The Secret Life of Plants.&quot;
Initial pressings of the album were also scented with a floral perfume.

== Release ==
After Stevie Wonder&#x27;s previous albums &quot;Innervisions&quot; (1973), &quot;Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale&quot; (1974), and &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; (1976) all won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, his next project was highly anticipated, and Motown marketed it aggressively. Although the &quot;Secret Life of Plants&quot; documentary film never received a wide release, Wonder&#x27;s soundtrack album went all the way up to number four in the Rock and R&amp;B &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1979 and was also certified platinum by Productores de Música de España, while the single &quot;Send One Your Love&quot; also reached number four. However, sales tapered off quickly, and label head Berry Gordy reportedly complained that the one million copies he pressed turned out to be 900,000 too many.

==Promotion==
Wonder supported the album in late 1979 with a six-city tour, performing nearly the entire album live with his band Wonderlove and the National Afro-American Philharmonic Orchestra (conducted by James Frazier Jr.). Reflecting the orchestra&#x27;s presence and the album&#x27;s atmospheric tone, the tour venues included concert halls and opera houses. The shows began with the &quot;Plants&quot; music (partially accompanied by film projections), followed by a second half spanning his career hits.

== Reception ==
&quot;Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;&quot; has sometimes been considered a &quot;vague&quot; and &quot;overambitious&quot; album; it has been called &quot;goofy&quot;, &quot;nerdy&quot;, &quot;odd&quot;, &quot;pointless&quot; and &quot;foolish&quot;, and for listeners and critics it was seen as too much of a departure from his string of melodic albums. However, some critics have also described it as &quot;courageous&quot;, &quot;achingly sweet&quot;, and &quot;bafflingly beautiful&quot;. Stephen Holden in a review for the &quot;Village Voice&quot; remarked that the album has &quot;the painful awkwardness of a barely literate sidewalk sermon&quot;, though Wonder &quot;manages to transform even the worst of this drivel into a spiritual jargon that&#x27;s virtually a different language; his very in-articulateness clears the way for us to tune in to the ineffable, nonrational flow that&#x27;s his obsession.&quot;

Wonder remarked in 2004 that the album &quot;was an experimental project with me scoring and doing other things I like: challenging myself with all the things that entered my mind from the Venus&#x27;s Flytrap to Earth&#x27;s creation to coming back as a flower.&quot;

The cover of the album was selected by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1991 for their list of 100 Classic Album Covers as a memorable example of album art.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said &quot;Outside My Window&quot; was a &quot;truly joyous, pastoral love song, utilizing the universal image of the flower to lyrically represent all that is fair and beautiful in nature.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said of it that &quot;A deep, dense bassline is mixed alongside Wonder&#x27;s uplifting vocals on this mid-tempo track.&quot;

Solange Knowles named it as an influence on her 2019 album &quot;When I Get Home&quot;.

KAINA covered the song &quot;Come Back as a Flower&quot; on her 2022 album &quot;It Was a Home&quot;.

<text>Ohrid ( ) is a city in North Macedonia and is the seat of the Ohrid Municipality. It is the largest city on Lake Ohrid and the eighth-largest city in the country, with the municipality recording a population of over 42,000 inhabitants as of 2002. Ohrid is known for once having 365 churches, one for each day of the year, and has been referred to as the &quot;Jerusalem of the Balkans&quot;. The city is rich in picturesque houses and monuments, and tourism is predominant. It is located southwest of Skopje, west of Resen and Bitola. In 1979 and in 1980, respectively, Ohrid and Lake Ohrid were accepted as Cultural and Natural World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Ohrid is one of only 40 sites that are part of UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage that are Cultural as well as Natural sites.

== Name ==
In antiquity the city was known under the ancient Greek name of Λυχνίς (&quot;Lychnis&quot;) and Λυχνιδός (&quot;Lychnidos&quot;) and the Latin &quot;Lychnidus&quot;, probably meaning &quot;city of light&quot;, literally &quot;a precious stone that emits light&quot;, from λύχνος (&quot;lychnos&quot;), &quot;lamp, portable light&quot;. Polybius, writing in the second century BC, refers to the town as Λυχνίδιον - &quot;Lichnidion&quot;.

The evolution of the ancient toponym &quot;Lychnidus&quot; into &quot;Oh(ë)r(id)&quot; required a long-standing period of Tosk Albanian–Eastern South Slavic bilingualism, or at least contact, resulting from the Tosk Albanian rhotacism &quot;-n-&quot; into &quot;-r-&quot; and Eastern South Slavic l-vocalization &quot;ly-&quot; into &quot;o-&quot;.

It became capital of the First Bulgarian Empire in the early medieval period, and was often referred to by Byzantine writers as &quot;Achrida&quot; (Ἄχριδα, Ὄχριδα, or Ἄχρις). By 879 AD, the town was no longer called Lychnidos but was referred to as &quot;Ohrid&quot;.

In Macedonian and the other South Slavic languages, the name of the city is &quot;Ohrid&quot; (Охрид). In Albanian, the city is known as &quot;Ohër&quot; or &quot;Ohri&quot; and in modern Greek &quot;Ochrida&quot; (Οχρίδα, Ωχρίδα) and &quot;Achrida&quot; (Αχρίδα). The name of the city in Aromanian is .

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
The earliest inhabitants of the wider Lake Ohrid region were the Illyrian tribes of Enchele and Dassaretii. According to a tradition the town was founded by Cadmus, the Phoenician king of Thebes, who fled to Enchele after being banished from Boeotia. In addition to Ohrid, called Lychnidos () in classical antiquity, he is said to have founded Budva in Montenegro. Lychnidos was the capital city of the Illyrian Dassaretii.

According to recent excavations, this was a town as early as of the era of king Philip II of Macedon. They conclude that Samuil&#x27;s Fortress was built on the site of an earlier fortification, dated to the 4th century BC. In 210 BCE, Philip V of Macedon raided a number of southern Illyrian communities. He maintained a garrison at Lychnidos but lost control of the settlement in 208 BCE, when its commander joined local leader Aeropus and invited the Dardani in the region.

During the Roman conquests, towards the end of 3rd and the beginning of 2nd century BC, Lychnidus is mentioned as a town near or within Dassaretia. In Roman times, it was located along the &quot;Via Egnatia&quot;, which connected the Adriatic port Dyrrachion (present-day Durrës) with Byzantium. Archaeological excavations (e.g., the Polyconch Basilica from the 5th century) prove an early adoption of Christianity in the area. Bishops from Lychnidos participated in multiple ecumenical councils.

=== Middle Ages ===

The South Slavs began to arrive in the area during the 6th century AD. By the early 7th century, it was colonized by a Slavic tribe known as the Berziti. Bulgaria conquered the city around 840.

The name &quot;Ohrid&quot; first appeared in 879. The Ohrid Literary School, established in 886 by Clement of Ohrid, became one of the two major cultural centres of the First Bulgarian Empire. Between 990 and 1015, Ohrid was the empire&#x27;s capital and stronghold.

From 990 to 1018, Ohrid was also the seat of the Bulgarian Patriarchate. After the Byzantine reconquest of the city in 1018 by Basil II, the Bulgarian Patriarchate was downgraded to an Archbishopric of Ohrid, and placed under the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.

The higher clergy after 1018 was almost invariably Greek, including during the period of Ottoman domination, until the abolition of the archbishopric in 1767. At the beginning of the 16th century, the archbishopric reached its peak, subordinating the Sofia, Vidin, Vlach and Moldavian eparchies, part of the former medieval Serbian Patriarchate of Peć, (including Patriarchal Monastery of Peć itself), and even the Orthodox districts of Italy (Apulia, Calabria and Sicily), Venice and Dalmatia.

As an episcopal city, Ohrid was a cultural center of great importance for the Balkans. Almost all surviving churches were built by the Byzantines and by the Bulgarians, with the rest dating back to the short time of Serbian rule during the late Middle Ages.

Bohemond, leading a Norman army from southern Italy, took the city in 1083. The Byzantines regained it in 1085. Albanian ruler Golem of Kruja (~1250) likely had had control over Ohrid but it was later ceded to the Byzantine Empire by negotiation. In the 13th and 14th century, the city changed hands between the Despotate of Epirus, the Bulgarian, Byzantine and Serbian Empires, and Albanian rulers. In the mid-13th century, Ohrid was one of the cities ruled by Pal Gropa, a member of the Albanian noble Gropa family. 
In a text by Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos, there is mention of nomadic Albanians present in the vicinity of Ohrid at around 1328. The presence of the Turkish community dates from their settlement in Ohrid during 1451–81.

In 1334, the city was captured by Stefan Uroš IV Dušan and incorporated in the Serbian Empire. After Dusan&#x27;s death, the city came under the control of Andrea Gropa. After his death, Prince Marko incorporated it in the Kingdom of Prilep.

In the early 1370s, Marko lost Ohrid to Pal II Gropa, another member of the Gropa family, and unsuccessfully tried to recapture it in 1375 with Ottoman assistance. 
In 1395, the Ottomans under Bayezid I captured the city, which became the seat of the newly established Sanjak of Ohrid. Some time after Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg had liberated Krujë to begin his rebellion, his troops—in coordination with Gjergj Arianiti and Zaharia Gropa (of the local Albanian Gropa noble family)—liberated Ohrid and the castle of Svetigrad.

From 14–15 September 1464, 12,000 Albanian troops of the League of Lezhë and 1,000 of the Republic of Venice defeated a 14,000-man Ottoman force near the city in the Battle of Ohrid. When Mehmed II returned from Albania after his actions against Skanderbeg in 1466, he dethroned Dorotheos, the Archbishop of Ohrid, and expatriated him—together with his clerks and boyars and considerable number of citizens of Ohrid—to Istanbul, probably because of their anti-Ottoman activities during Skanderbeg&#x27;s rebellion amid which many citizens of Ohrid, including Dorotheos and his clergy, supported Skanderbeg and his fight.

=== Ottoman period ===
During the 16th century, Ohrid was located in the Sanjak of Ohrid. In the years 1529–1536, Sanjak of Ohrid had 33,271 households (32,648 Christians and 623 Muslims), with 1331 widows and 3392 unmarried singles. There were 859 settlements and 10 cities, with an average of 28.7 houses per settlement. Ohrid itself had 337 Christian families, 44 unmarried singles, 12 widows and 93 Muslim families. In 1583, the Sanjak of Ohrid was made up of several Kazas, including the Kaza of Ohrid, which were in turn made of Nahiyes; the Ottoman Defter recorded, within the Nahiya of Ohrid, 2,920 Christian homes, 627 unmarried singles and 465 Muslim families within a total of 107 settlements.

In 1889, according to a French research, the city had 2.500-3.000 houses and approximately 12.000 individuals, of which 2/3 were Bulgarians and Vlachs and the rest 1/3 were Albanophone Muslims with 20-25 Slavophone Greek families. The Christian population declined during the first centuries of Ottoman rule. In 1664, there were only 142 Christian households. The situation changed in the 18th century when Ohrid emerged as an important trade center on a major trade route. At the end of this century it had around five thousand inhabitants.

Towards the end of the 18th century and in the early part of the 19th century, Ohrid region, like other parts of European Turkey, was a hotbed of unrest. In the 19th century the region of Ohrid became part of the Pashalik of Scutari, ruled by the Bushati family.

After the Christian population of the bishopric of Ohrid voted on a plebiscite in 1874 overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Bulgarian Exarchate (97%), the Exarchate became in control of the area. In 1889, Gustav Weigand discovered in Ohrid the important Codex Dimonie, a collection of Aromanian-language religious texts. In statistics gathered by Vasil Kanchov in 1900, the city of Ohrid was inhabited by 8000 Bulgarians, 5000 Turks, 500 Muslim Albanians, 300 Christian Albanians, 460 Vlachs and 600 Romani. The Bulgarian researcher Vasil Kanchov wrote in 1900 that many Albanians declared themselves as Turks. Ohrid, the population that declared itself Turkish &quot;was of Albanian blood&quot;, but it &quot;had been Turkified after the Ottoman invasion, including Skanderbeg&quot;, referring to Islamization.

The majority of the Christian inhabitants of the city were under the supremacy of the Bulgarian Exarchate. According to &quot; La Macédoine et sa Population Chrétienne &quot;, statistics of the secretary of the exarchate Dimitar Mishev on the Christian population in Macedonia, in 1905 the Christian population of Ohrid consisted of 7,768 Exarchist Bulgarians, 168 Greek Patriarchal Bulgarians, 56 Serboman Patriarchal Bulgarians, 660 Vlachs and 6 Albanians. In the city there is 1 secondary and 5 primary Bulgarian schools and 1 primary Greek, Serbian and Wallachian school each.

Modern Albanian study claims that in 1903 the Cartographic Society of Sofia registered incorrectly 8,893 households of Albanian or Vlach ethnicity in the Kaza of Ohrid. There were supposedly 2,610 households registered in Ohrid, but after further analysis of the documents by Dervishi et al., it was discovered that the city actually had 3,700 households; there were 2,100 Albanian Muslim households, 150 Albanian Christian households, 900 Bulgarian households, 300 Vlach households, 210 Serb households and 39 Greek households. The Cartographic Society of Sofia also incorrectly registered many villages - that were in fact inhabited entirely or mostly by Albanians (both Christians and Muslims) - as Bulgarian. 14 villages were registered as Albanian with 991 households, but further investigation by Dervishi et al. revealed that the number was actually 2,400. Therefore, with those corrections, the Kaza of Ohrid had 5,336 Albanian households, 4,347 Slavic households, 1,549 mixed household and 125 Vlach households that were mainly spread across two villages. By the end of Ottoman rule, the Kaza of Ohrid itself numbered to 38,000 Albanian inhabitants and 36,500 non-Albanian (Bulgarian, Serbs, Vlachs and Orthodox Albanians who recognised the exarch and were therefore classed as Bulgarians) inhabitants as indicated by statistics gathered from the Ottoman authorities.

=== Modern ===
Before 1912, Ohrid was a township center bounded to Monastir sanjak in Manastir Vilayet (present-day Bitola). The city remained under Ottoman rule until 29 November 1912, when the Serbian army took control of the city during the Balkan Wars and later made it the capital of Ohrid district. In Ohrid, Serbian forces killed 150 Bulgarians and 500 people consisting of Albanians and Turks. In September 1913 local Albanian and pro-Bulgarian Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization leaders rebelled against the Kingdom of Serbia. It was occupied by Kingdom of Bulgaria between 1915 and 1918 during World War I.

Bulgarian ethnographer Yordan Ivanov, professor at the University of Sofia, wrote in 1915 that Albanians, since they did not have their own alphabet, lacked a consolidated national consciousness and were being influenced by foreign propaganda, declared themselves as Turks, Greeks and Bulgarians, depending on which religion they belonged to. Albanians in Ohrid were losing their mother tongue.

During Kingdom of Yugoslavia Ohrid continued to be as an independent district (&quot;Охридски округ&quot;) (1918–1922), then it became a part of Bitola Oblast (1920–1929), and then from 1929 to 1941, Ohrid was part of the Vardar Banovina. It was occupied again by Bulgaria between 1941 and 1944 during World War II. Since the days of SFR Yugoslavia Ohrid has been the municipal seat of Municipality of Ohrid (Општина Охрид). Since 1991 the town was part of the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia).

On 20 November 1993, Avioimpex Flight 110 crashed near Ohrid, killing all 116 people on board. It is the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in North Macedonia.

The oldest inhabitants of Ohrid are a few families that reside in the Varoš neighbourhood. Other Macedonians have settled in Ohrid and originate from the villages of the Kosel, Struga, Drimkol, Debarca, Malesija and Kičevo regions and other areas from southern Macedonia. Albanians in Ohrid originate from Albanian villages located on the western and southern areas of Lake Ohrid. There is a sizeable amount of Turkified Albanians in Ohrid who originate from the cities of Elbasan, Durrës and Ulcinj. The local Romani population in Ohrid originates from Podgradec and speaks the southern Tosk Albanian dialect.

The earliest presence of the Aromanian population in Ohrid dates to 1778 arriving from Moscopole, others from Kavajë (late 18th century), from the Myzeqe region, Elbasan, Llëngë and Mokër region (mid. 19th century) and also from Gorna Belica and Malovišta (late 19th century). A large part of Ohrid&#x27;s Aromanian population has emigrated to Trieste, Odessa and Bucharest. Orthodox Albanians are also present and settled in Ohrid during the second half of the 19th century and originate from Pogradec, Lin, Çërravë and Peshkopi.

All Turks from the village of Peštani after selling properties and land moved to Ohrid by 1920 and today those few families are known as &quot;Peştanlı&quot;. In 1949, additional families from Aegean Macedonia settled in Ohrid.

In Yugoslav censuses, Albanophone Ohrid Romani mainly declared as Albanians. As tensions between Albanians and the state increased over numbers regarding community size and sociopolitical rights, Romani identity became politicized and contested from the 1990s onward. Ohrid Albanophone Romani refused identification as &quot;Albanians&quot; seeing it as a result of Albanisation (or to be called &quot;Gypsies&quot;) and with encouragement from Macedonian circles now refers to itself as &quot;Egyptians&quot; whose ancestors migrated from Egypt many centuries ago. The Albanian language is considered by Ohrid Albanophone Romani as only an idiom of the home and not a mother tongue. Turkish speaking Romani reside in Ohrid that during the Yugoslav period self declared themselves mainly as Turks, while within independent Macedonia they identify as Egyptians.
In the latter decades of the 20th century, some Albanian speaking Muslim Romani from the villages of Krani and Nakolec have migrated to Ohrid.

<text>Brazilian Portuguese (; ) is the set of varieties of the Portuguese language native to Brazil. It is spoken by almost all of the 203 million inhabitants of Brazil and spoken widely across the Brazilian diaspora, today consisting of about two million Brazilians who have emigrated to other countries. With a population of over 203 million, Brazil is by far the world&#x27;s largest Portuguese-speaking nation and the only one in the Americas.

Brazilian Portuguese differs, particularly in phonology and prosody, from varieties spoken in Portugal and Portuguese-speaking African countries. In these latter countries, the language tends to have a closer connection to contemporary European Portuguese, partly because Portuguese colonial rule ended much more recently there than in Brazil, and partly due to the heavy indigenous and diasporic African influence on Brazilian Portuguese. Despite this difference between the spoken varieties, Brazilian and European Portuguese barely differ in formal writing and remain mutually intelligible. However, due to the two reasons mentioned above, the gap between the written, formal language and the spoken language is much wider in Brazilian Portuguese than in European Portuguese.

In 1990, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), which included representatives from all countries with Portuguese as the official language, reached an agreement on the reform of the Portuguese orthography to unify the two standards then in use by Brazil on one side and the remaining Portuguese-speaking countries on the other. This spelling reform went into effect in Brazil on 1 January 2009. In Portugal, the reform was signed into law by the President on 21 July 2008 allowing for a six-year adaptation period, during which both orthographies co-existed. All of the CPLP countries have signed the reform. In Brazil, this reform has been in force since January 2016. Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries have since begun using the new orthography.

Regional varieties of Brazilian Portuguese, while remaining mutually intelligible, may diverge from each other in matters such as vowel pronunciation and speech intonation.

==History==



===Portuguese language in Brazil===

The existence of Portuguese in Brazil is a legacy of the Portuguese colonization of the Americas. The first wave of Portuguese-speaking immigrants settled in Brazil in the 16th century, but the language was not widely used then. For a time Portuguese coexisted with Língua Geral, a lingua franca based on Amerindian languages that was used by the Jesuit missionaries, as well as with various African languages spoken by the millions of slaves brought into the country between the 16th and 19th centuries. By the end of the 18th century, Portuguese had affirmed itself as the national language. Some of the main contributions to that swift change were the expansion of colonization to the Brazilian interior, and the growing numbers of Portuguese settlers, who brought their language and became the most important ethnic group in Brazil.

Beginning in the early 18th century, Portugal&#x27;s government made efforts to expand the use of Portuguese throughout the colony, particularly because its consolidation in Brazil would help guarantee to Portugal the lands in dispute with Spain (according to various treaties signed in the 18th century, those lands would be ceded to the people who effectively occupied them). Under the administration of the Marquis of Pombal (1750–1777), Brazilians started to favour the use of Portuguese, as the Marquis expelled the Jesuit missionaries (who had taught Língua Geral) and prohibited the use of Nhengatu, or Lingua Franca.

The failed colonization attempts, by the French in Rio de Janeiro during the 16th century and the Dutch in Recife during the 17th century, had negligible effects on Portuguese. The substantial waves of non-Portuguese-speaking immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (mostly from Italy, Spain, Germany, Poland, Japan and Lebanon) were linguistically integrated into the Portuguese-speaking majority within a few generations, except for some areas of the three southernmost states (Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul), in the case of Germans, Italians and Slavics, and in rural areas of the state of São Paulo (Italians and Japanese).

Nowadays the overwhelming majority of Brazilians speak Portuguese as their mother tongue, with the exception of small, insular communities of descendants of European (German, Polish, Ukrainian, and Italian) and Japanese immigrants, mostly in the South and Southeast as well as villages and reservations inhabited by Amerindians. And even these populations make use of Portuguese to communicate with outsiders and to understand television and radio broadcasts, for example. Moreover, there is a community of Brazilian Sign Language users whose number is estimated by &quot;Ethnologue&quot; to be as high as 3 million.

===Loanwords===
The development of Portuguese in Brazil (and consequently in the rest of the areas where Portuguese is spoken) has been influenced by other languages with which it has come into contact, mainly in the lexicon: first the Amerindian languages of the original inhabitants, then the various African languages spoken by the slaves, and finally those of later European and Asian immigrants. Although the vocabulary is still predominantly Portuguese, the influence of other languages is evident in the Brazilian lexicon, which today includes, for example, hundreds of words of Tupi–Guarani origin referring to local flora and fauna; numerous West African Yoruba words related to foods, religious concepts, and musical expressions; and English terms from the fields of modern technology and commerce. Although some of these words are more predominant in Brazil, they are also used in Portugal and other countries where Portuguese is spoken.

Words derived from the Tupi language are particularly prevalent in place names (&quot;Itaquaquecetuba,&quot; &quot;Pindamonhangaba,&quot; &quot;Caruaru&quot;, &quot;Ipanema&quot;, &quot;Paraíba&quot;). The native languages also contributed the names of most of the plants and animals found in Brazil (and most of these are the official names of the animals in other Portuguese-speaking countries as well), including &quot;arara&quot; (&quot;macaw&quot;), &quot;jacaré&quot; (&quot;South American caiman&quot;), &quot;tucano&quot; (&quot;toucan&quot;), &quot;mandioca&quot; (&quot;cassava&quot;), &quot;abacaxi&quot; (&quot;pineapple&quot;), and many more. However, many Tupi–Guarani toponyms did not derive directly from Amerindian expressions, but were in fact coined by European settlers and Jesuit missionaries, who used the &quot;Língua Geral&quot; extensively in the first centuries of colonization. Many of the Amerindian words entered the Portuguese lexicon as early as in the 16th century, and some of them were eventually borrowed into other European languages.

African languages provided hundreds of words as well, especially in certain semantic domains, as in the following examples, which are also present in Portuguese: 
* Food: &quot;quitute&quot;, &quot;quindim&quot;, &quot;acarajé&quot;, &quot;moqueca&quot;; 
* Religious concepts: &quot;mandinga&quot;, &quot;macumba&quot;, &quot;orixá&quot; (&quot;orisha&quot;), &quot;axé&quot;; 
* Afro-Brazilian music: &quot;samba&quot;, &quot;lundu&quot;, &quot;maxixe&quot;, &quot;berimbau&quot;; 
* Body-related parts and conditions: &quot;banguela&quot; (&quot;toothless&quot;), &quot;bunda&quot; (&quot;buttocks&quot;), &quot;capenga&quot; (&quot;lame&quot;), &quot;caxumba&quot; (&quot;mumps&quot;); 
* Geographical features: &quot;cacimba&quot; (&quot;well&quot;), &quot;quilombo&quot; or &quot;mocambo&quot; (&quot;runaway slave settlement&quot;), &quot;senzala&quot; (&quot;slave quarters&quot;); 
* Articles of clothing: &quot;miçanga&quot; (&quot;beads&quot;), &quot;abadá&quot; (&quot;capoeira or dance uniform&quot;), &quot;tanga&quot; (&quot;loincloth, thong&quot;); 
* Miscellaneous household concepts: &quot;cafuné&quot; (&quot;caress on the head&quot;), &quot;curinga&quot; (&quot;joker card&quot;), &quot;caçula&quot; (&quot;youngest child,&quot; also &quot;cadete&quot; and &quot;filho mais novo&quot;), and &quot;moleque&quot; (&quot;brat, spoiled child,&quot; or simply &quot;child,&quot; depending on the region).

Although the African slaves had various ethnic origins, by far most of the borrowings were contributed (1) by Bantu languages (above all, Kimbundu, from Angola, and Kikongo from Angola and the area that is now the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), and (2) by Niger-Congo languages, notably Yoruba/Nagô, from what is now Nigeria, and Jeje/Ewe, from what is now Benin.

There are also many loanwords from other European languages, including English, French, German, and Italian. In addition, there is a limited set of vocabulary from Japanese.

Portuguese has borrowed a large number of words from English. In Brazil, these are especially related to the following fields (note that some of these words are used in other Portuguese-speaking countries): 
* Technology and science: &quot;app&quot;, &quot;mod&quot;, &quot;layout&quot;, &quot;briefing&quot;, &quot;designer&quot;, &quot;slideshow&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;forward&quot;, &quot;revolver&quot;, &quot;relay&quot;, &quot;home office&quot;, &quot;home theater&quot;, &quot;bonde&quot; (&quot;streetcar, tram,&quot; from 1860s company bonds), &quot;chulipa&quot; (also &quot;dormente&quot;, &quot;sleeper&quot;), &quot;bita&quot; (&quot;beater,&quot; railway settlement tool), &quot;breque&quot; (&quot;brake&quot;), &quot;picape/pick-up&quot;, &quot;hatch&quot;, &quot;roadster&quot;, &quot;SUV&quot;, &quot;air-bag&quot;, &quot;guincho&quot; (&quot;winch&quot;), &quot;tilburí&quot; (19th century), &quot;macadame&quot;, &quot;workshop&quot;;
* Commerce and finance: &quot;commodities&quot;, &quot;debênture&quot;, &quot;holding&quot;, &quot;fundo hedge&quot;, &quot;angel&quot;, &quot;truste&quot;, &quot;dumping&quot;, &quot;CEO&quot;, &quot;CFO&quot;, &quot;MBA&quot;, &quot;kingsize&quot;, &quot;fast food&quot; (), &quot;delivery service&quot;, &quot;self service&quot;, &quot;drive-thru&quot;, &quot;telemarketing&quot;, &quot;franchise&quot; (also &quot;franquia&quot;), &quot;merchandising&quot;, &quot;combo&quot;, &quot;check-in&quot;, &quot;pet shop&quot;, &quot;sex shop&quot;, &quot;flat&quot;, &quot;loft&quot;, &quot;motel&quot;, &quot;suíte&quot;, &quot;shopping center/mall&quot;, &quot;food truck&quot;, &quot;outlet&quot;, &quot;tagline&quot;, &quot;slogan&quot;, &quot;jingle&quot;, &quot;outdoor&quot;, &quot;outboard&quot; (), &quot;case&quot; (advertising), &quot;showroom&quot;;

Many of these words are used throughout the Lusosphere.

French has contributed to Portuguese words for foods, furniture, and luxurious fabrics, as well as for various abstract concepts. Examples include &quot;hors-concours&quot;, &quot;chic&quot;, &quot;metrô&quot;, &quot;batom&quot;, &quot;soutien&quot;, &quot;buquê&quot;, &quot;abajur&quot;, &quot;guichê&quot;, &quot;içar&quot;, &quot;chalé&quot;, &quot;cavanhaque&quot; (from Louis-Eugène Cavaignac), &quot;calibre&quot;, &quot;habitué&quot;, &quot;clichê&quot;, &quot;jargão&quot;, &quot;manchete&quot;, &quot;jaqueta&quot;, &quot;boîte de nuit&quot; or &quot;boate&quot;, &quot;cofre&quot;, &quot;rouge&quot;, &quot;frufru&quot;, &quot;chuchu&quot;, &quot;purê&quot;, &quot;petit gâteau&quot;, &quot;pot-pourri&quot;, &quot;ménage&quot;, &quot;enfant gâté&quot;, &quot;enfant terrible&quot;, &quot;garçonnière&quot;, &quot;patati-patata&quot;, &quot;parvenu&quot;, &quot;détraqué&quot;, &quot;enquête&quot;, &quot;equipe&quot;, &quot;malha&quot;, &quot;fila&quot;, &quot;burocracia&quot;, &quot;birô&quot;, &quot;affair&quot;, &quot;grife&quot;, &quot;gafe&quot;, &quot;croquette&quot;, &quot;crocante&quot;, &quot;croquis&quot;, &quot;femme fatale&quot;, &quot;noir&quot;, &quot;marchand&quot;, &quot;paletó&quot;, &quot;gabinete&quot;, &quot;grã-fino&quot;, &quot;blasé&quot;, &quot;de bom tom&quot;, &quot;bon-vivant&quot;, &quot;guindaste&quot;, &quot;guiar&quot;, &quot;flanar&quot;, &quot;bonbonnière&quot;, &quot;calembour&quot;, &quot;jeu de mots&quot;, &quot;vis-à-vis&quot;, &quot;tête-à-tête&quot;, &quot;mecha&quot;, &quot;blusa&quot;, &quot;conhaque&quot;, &quot;mélange&quot;, &quot;bric-brac&quot;, &quot;broche&quot;, &quot;pâtisserie&quot;, &quot;peignoir&quot;, &quot;négliglé&quot;, &quot;robe de chambre&quot;, &quot;déshabillé&quot;, &quot;lingerie&quot;, &quot;corset&quot;, &quot;corselet&quot;, &quot;corpete&quot;, &quot;pantufas&quot;, &quot;salopette&quot;, &quot;cachecol&quot;, &quot;cachenez&quot;, &quot;cachepot&quot;, &quot;colete&quot;, &quot;colher&quot;, &quot;prato&quot;, &quot;costume&quot;, &quot;serviette&quot;, &quot;garde-nappe&quot;, &quot;avant-première&quot;, &quot;avant-garde&quot;, &quot;debut&quot;, &quot;crepe&quot;, &quot;frappé&quot; (including slang), &quot;canapé&quot;, &quot;paetê&quot;, &quot;tutu&quot;, &quot;mignon&quot;, &quot;pince-nez&quot;, &quot;grand prix&quot;, &quot;parlamento&quot;, &quot;patim&quot;, &quot;camuflagem&quot;, &quot;blindar&quot; (from German), &quot;guilhotina&quot;, &quot;à gogo&quot;, &quot;pastel&quot;, &quot;filé&quot;, &quot;silhueta&quot;, &quot;menu&quot;, &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot;, &quot;bistrô&quot;, &quot;chef&quot;, &quot;coq au vin&quot;, &quot;rôtisserie&quot;, &quot;maiô&quot;, &quot;bustiê&quot;, &quot;collant&quot;, &quot;fuseau&quot;, &quot;cigarette&quot;, &quot;crochê&quot;, &quot;tricô&quot;, &quot;tricot&quot; (&quot;pullover, sweater&quot;), &quot;calção&quot;, &quot;culotte&quot;, &quot;botina&quot;, &quot;bota&quot;, &quot;galocha&quot;, &quot;scarpin&quot; (ultimately Italian), &quot;sorvete&quot;, &quot;glacê&quot;, &quot;boutique&quot;, &quot;vitrine&quot;, &quot;manequim&quot; (ultimately Dutch), &quot;machê&quot;, &quot;tailleur&quot;, &quot;echarpe&quot;, &quot;fraque&quot;, &quot;laquê&quot;, &quot;gravata&quot;, &quot;chapéu&quot;, &quot;boné&quot;, &quot;edredom&quot;, &quot;gabardine&quot;, &quot;fondue&quot;, &quot;buffet&quot;, &quot;toalete&quot;, &quot;pantalon&quot;, &quot;calça Saint-Tropez&quot;, &quot;manicure&quot;, &quot;pedicure&quot;, &quot;balayage&quot;, &quot;limusine&quot;, &quot;caminhão&quot;, &quot;guidão&quot;, &quot;cabriolê&quot;, &quot;capilé&quot;, &quot;garfo&quot;, &quot;nicho&quot;, &quot;garçonete&quot;, &quot;chenille&quot;, &quot;chiffon&quot;, &quot;chemise&quot;, &quot;chamois&quot;, &quot;plissê&quot;, &quot;balonê&quot;, &quot;frisê&quot;, &quot;chaminé&quot;, &quot;guilhochê&quot;, &quot;château&quot;, &quot;bidê&quot;, &quot;redingote&quot;, &quot;chéri(e)&quot;, &quot;flambado&quot;, &quot;bufante&quot;, &quot;pierrot&quot;, &quot;torniquete&quot;, &quot;molinete&quot;, &quot;canivete&quot;, &quot;guerra&quot; (Occitan), &quot;escamotear&quot;, &quot;escroque&quot;, &quot;flamboyant&quot;, &quot;maquilagem&quot;, &quot;visagismo&quot;, &quot;topete&quot;, &quot;coiffeur&quot;, &quot;tênis&quot;, &quot;cabine&quot;, &quot;concièrge&quot;, &quot;chauffeur&quot;, &quot;hangar&quot;, &quot;garagem&quot;, &quot;haras&quot;, &quot;calandragem&quot;, &quot;cabaré&quot;, &quot;coqueluche&quot;, &quot;coquine&quot;, &quot;coquette&quot; (&quot;cocotinha&quot;), &quot;galã&quot;, &quot;bas-fond&quot; (used as slang), &quot;mascote&quot;, &quot;estampa&quot;, &quot;sabotagem&quot;, &quot;RSVP&quot;, &quot;rendez-vous&quot;, &quot;chez...&quot;, &quot;à la carte&quot;, &quot;à la ...&quot;, &quot;forró, forrobodó&quot; (from 19th-century &quot;faux-bourdon&quot;).

Brazilian Portuguese tends to adopt French suffixes as in &quot;aterrissagem&quot; (Fr. &quot;atterrissage&quot; &quot;landing [aviation]&quot;), differently from European Portuguese (cf. Eur.Port. &quot;aterragem&quot;). Brazilian Portuguese (BP) also tends to adopt culture-bound concepts from French. That is the difference between BP &quot;estação&quot; (&quot;station&quot;) and EP &quot;gare&quot; (&quot;train station,&quot; Portugal also uses &quot;estação&quot;). BP &quot;trem&quot; is from English &quot;train&quot; (ultimately from French), while EP &quot;comboio&quot; is from Fr. &quot;convoi&quot;. An evident example of the dichotomy between English and French influences can be noted in the use of the expressions &quot;know-how&quot;, used in a technical context, and &quot;savoir-faire&quot; in a social context. Portugal uses the expression &quot;hora de ponta&quot;, from French &quot;l&#x27;heure de pointe&quot;, to refer to the &quot;rush hour,&quot; while Brazil has &quot;horário de pico, horário de pique&quot; and &quot;hora do rush&quot;. Both &quot;bilhar&quot;, from French &quot;billiard&quot;, and the phonetic adaptation &quot;sinuca&quot; are used interchangeably for &quot;snooker.&quot;

Contributions from German and Italian include terms for foods, music, the arts, and architecture.

From German, besides strudel, pretzel, bratwurst, kuchen (also &quot;bolo cuca&quot;), sauerkraut (also spelled &quot;chucrute&quot; from French &quot;choucroute&quot; and pronounced ), wurstsalat, sauerbraten, Oktoberfest, biergarten, &quot;zelt&quot;, Osterbaum, Bauernfest, Schützenfest, &quot;hinterland&quot;, &quot;Kindergarten&quot;, &quot;bock&quot;, &quot;fassbier&quot; and &quot;chope&quot; (from &quot;Schoppen&quot;), there are also abstract terms from German such as &quot;Prost&quot;, &quot;zum wohl&quot;, &quot;doppelgänger&quot; (also &quot;sósia&quot;), &quot;über&quot;, &quot;brinde&quot;, &quot;kitsch&quot;, &quot;ersatz&quot;, &quot;blitz&quot; (&quot;police action&quot;), and possibly &quot;encrenca&quot; (&quot;difficult situation,&quot; perhaps from Ger. &quot;ein Kranker&quot;, &quot;a sick person&quot;). &quot;Xumbergar&quot;, &quot;brega&quot; (from marshal Friedrich Hermann Von Schönberg), and &quot;xote&quot; (musical style and dance) from &quot;schottisch&quot;. A significant number of beer brands in Brazil are named after German culture-bound concepts and place names because the brewing process was brought by German immigrants.

Italian loan words and expressions, in addition to those that are related to food or music, include &quot;tchau&quot; (&quot;ciao&quot;), &quot;nonna&quot;, &quot;nonnino&quot;, &quot;imbróglio&quot;, &quot;bisonho&quot;, &quot;entrevero&quot;, &quot;panetone&quot;, &quot;colomba&quot;, &quot;è vero&quot;, &quot;cicerone&quot;, &quot;male male&quot;, &quot;capisce&quot;, &quot;mezzo&quot;, &quot;va bene&quot;, &quot;ecco&quot;, &quot;ecco fatto&quot;, &quot;ecco qui&quot;, &quot;caspita&quot;, &quot;schifoso&quot;, &quot;gelateria&quot;, &quot;cavolo&quot;, &quot;incavolarsi&quot;, &quot;pivete&quot;, &quot;engambelar&quot;, &quot;andiamo via&quot;, &quot;tiramisu&quot;, &quot;tarantella&quot;, &quot;grappa&quot;, &quot;stratoria&quot;. Terms of endearment of Italian origin include &quot;amore&quot;, &quot;bambino/a&quot;, &quot;ragazzo/a&quot;, &quot;caro/a mio/a&quot;, &quot;tesoro&quot;, and &quot;bello/a&quot;; also &quot;babo&quot;, &quot;mamma&quot;, &quot;baderna&quot; (from &quot;Marietta Baderna&quot;), &quot;carcamano&quot;, &quot;torcicolo&quot;, &quot;casanova&quot;, &quot;noccia&quot;, &quot;noja&quot;, &quot;che me ne frega&quot;, &quot;io ti voglio tanto bene&quot;, and &quot;ti voglio bene assai&quot;.

Fewer words have been borrowed from Japanese. The latter borrowings are also mostly related to food and drink or culture-bound concepts, such as &quot;quimono&quot;, from Japanese kimono, &quot;karaokê&quot;, &quot;yakisoba&quot;, &quot;temakeria&quot;, &quot;sushi bar&quot;, &quot;mangá&quot;, &quot;biombo&quot; (from Portugal) (from &quot;byó bu sukurín&quot;, &quot;folding screen&quot;), &quot;jó ken pô&quot; or &quot;jankenpon&quot; (&quot;rock-paper-scissors,&quot; played with the Japanese words being said before the start), &quot;saquê&quot;, &quot;sashimi&quot;, &quot;tempurá&quot; (a lexical &quot;loan repayment&quot; from a Portuguese loanword in Japanese), &quot;hashi&quot;, &quot;wasabi&quot;, &quot;johrei&quot; (religious philosophy), &quot;nikkei&quot;, &quot;gaijin&quot; (&quot;non-Japanese&quot;), &quot;issei&quot; (&quot;Japanese immigrant&quot;), as well as the different descending generations &quot;nisei&quot;, &quot;sansei&quot;, &quot;yonsei&quot;, &quot;gossei&quot;, &quot;rokussei&quot; and &quot;shichissei&quot;. Other Japanese loanwords include racial terms, such as &quot;ainoko&quot; (&quot;Eurasian&quot;) and &quot;hafu&quot; (from English &quot;half&quot;); work-related, socioeconomic, historical, and ethnic terms limited to some spheres of society, including &quot;koseki&quot; (&quot;genealogical research&quot;), &quot;dekassegui&quot; (&quot;dekasegi&quot;), &quot;arubaito&quot;, &quot;kaizen&quot;, &quot;seiketsu&quot;, &quot;karoshi&quot; (&quot;death by work excess&quot;), &quot;burakumin&quot;, &quot;kamikaze&quot;, &quot;seppuku&quot;, &quot;harakiri&quot;, &quot;jisatsu&quot;, &quot;jigai&quot;, and &quot;ainu&quot;; martial arts terms such as &quot;karatê&quot;, &quot;aikidô&quot;, &quot;bushidô&quot;, &quot;katana&quot;, &quot;judô&quot;, &quot;jiu-jítsu&quot;, &quot;kyudô&quot;, &quot;nunchaku&quot;, and &quot;sumô&quot;; terms related to writing, such as &quot;kanji&quot;, &quot;kana&quot;, &quot;katakana&quot;, &quot;hiragana&quot;, and &quot;romaji&quot;; and terms for art concepts such as &quot;kabuki&quot; and &quot;ikebana&quot;. Other culture-bound terms from Japanese include &quot;ofurô&quot; (&quot;Japanese bathtub&quot;), &quot;Nihong&quot; (&quot;target news niche and websites&quot;), &quot;kabocha&quot; (type of pumpkin introduced in Japan by the Portuguese), &quot;reiki&quot;, and &quot;shiatsu&quot;. Some words have popular usage while others are known for a specific context in specific circles. Terms used among Nikkei descendants include &quot;oba-chan&quot; (&quot;grandma&quot;); &quot;onee-san&quot;, &quot;onee-chan&quot;, &quot;onii-san&quot;, and &quot;onii-chan&quot;; toasts and salutations such as &quot;kampai&quot; and &quot;banzai&quot;; and some honorific suffixes of address such as &quot;chan&quot;, &quot;kun&quot;, &quot;sama&quot;, &quot;san&quot;, and &quot;senpai&quot;.

Chinese contributed a few terms such as &quot;tai chi chuan&quot; and &quot;chá&quot; (&quot;tea&quot;), also in European Portuguese.

The loan vocabulary includes several calques, such as &quot;arranha-céu&quot; (&quot;skyscraper,&quot; from French &quot;gratte-ciel&quot;) and &quot;cachorro-quente&quot; (from English &quot;hot dog&quot;) in Portuguese worldwide.

===Other influences===

Use of the reflexive &quot;me&quot;, especially in São Paulo and the South, is thought to be an Italianism, attributed to the large Italian immigrant population, as are certain prosodic features, including patterns of intonation and stress, also in the South and Southeast.

Other scholars, however, notably Naro &amp; Scherre, have noted that the same or similar processes can be observed in the European variant, as well as in many varieties of Spanish, and that the main features of Brazilian Portuguese can be traced directly from 16th-century European Portuguese. In fact, they find many of the same phenomena in other Romance languages, including Aranese Occitan, French, Italian and Romanian; they explain these phenomena as due to natural Romance drift.

Naro and Scherre affirm that Brazilian Portuguese is not a &quot;decreolized&quot; form, but rather the &quot;nativization&quot; of a &quot;radical Romanic&quot; form. They assert that the phenomena found in Brazilian Portuguese are inherited from Classical Latin and Old Portuguese.
According to another linguist, vernacular Brazilian Portuguese is continuous with European Portuguese, while its phonetics are more conservative in several aspects, characterizing the nativization of a koiné formed by several regional European Portuguese varieties brought to Brazil, modified by natural drift.

==Written and spoken languages==

The written language taught in Brazilian schools has historically been based by law on the standard of Portugal and until the 19th century, Portuguese writers often were regarded as models by some Brazilian authors and university professors. However, this aspiration to unity was severely weakened in the 20th century by nationalist movements in literature and the arts, which awakened in many Brazilians a desire for a national style uninfluenced by the standards of Portugal. Later, agreements were reached to preserve at least an orthographic unity throughout the Portuguese-speaking world, including the African and Asian variants of the language (which are typically more similar to EP, due to a Portuguese presence lasting into the second half of the 20th century).

On the other hand, the spoken language was not subject to any of the constraints that applied to the written language, and consequently Brazilian Portuguese sounds different from any of the other varieties of the language. Brazilians, when concerned with pronunciation, look to what is considered the national standard variety, and never to the European one. This linguistic independence was fostered by the tension between Portugal and the settlers (immigrants) in Brazil from the time of the country&#x27;s de facto settlement, as immigrants were forbidden to speak freely in their native languages in Brazil for fear of severe punishment by the Portuguese authorities. Lately, Brazilians in general have had some exposure to European speech, through TV and music. Often one will see Brazilian actors working in Portugal and Portuguese actors working in Brazil.

Modern Brazilian Portuguese has been highly influenced by other languages introduced by immigrants through the past century, specifically by German, Italian and Japanese immigrants. This high intake of immigrants not only caused the incorporation and/or adaptation of many words and expressions from their native language into local language, but also created specific dialects, such as the German &quot;Hunsrückisch&quot; dialect in the South of Brazil.

==Orthography==

The written Brazilian standard differs from the European one to about the same extent that written American English differs from written British English. The differences extend to spelling, lexicon, and grammar. However, with the entry into force of the Orthographic Agreement of 1990 in Portugal and in Brazil since 2009, these differences were drastically reduced.

Several Brazilian writers have been awarded with the highest prize of the Portuguese language. The Camões Prize awarded annually by Portuguese and Brazilians is often regarded as the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in Literature for works in Portuguese.

Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, João Guimarães Rosa, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Graciliano Ramos, João Cabral de Melo Neto, Cecília Meireles, Clarice Lispector, José de Alencar, Rachel de Queiroz, Jorge Amado, Castro Alves, Antonio Candido, Autran Dourado, Rubem Fonseca, Lygia Fagundes Telles and Euclides da Cunha are Brazilian writers recognized for writing the most outstanding work in the Portuguese language.

===Spelling differences===

The Brazilian spellings of certain words differ from those used in Portugal and the other Portuguese-speaking countries. Some of these differences are merely orthographic, but others reflect true differences in pronunciation.

Until the implementation of the 1990 orthographic reform, a major subset of the differences related to the consonant clusters &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;cç&quot;, &quot;ct&quot;, &quot;pc&quot;, &quot;pç&quot;, and &quot;pt&quot;. In many cases, the letters &quot;c&quot; or &quot;p&quot; in syllable-final position have become silent in all varieties of Portuguese, a common phonetic change in Romance languages (cf. Spanish &quot;objeto&quot;, French &quot;objet&quot;). Accordingly, they stopped being written in BP (compare Italian spelling standards), but continued to be written in other Portuguese-speaking countries. For example, the word &quot;acção&quot; (&quot;action&quot;) in European Portuguese became &quot;ação&quot; in Brazil, European &quot;óptimo&quot; (&quot;optimum&quot;) became &quot;ótimo&quot; in Brazil, and so on, where the consonant was silent both in BP and EP, but the words were spelled differently. Only in a small number of words is the consonant silent in Brazil and pronounced elsewhere or vice versa, as in the case of BP &quot;fato&quot;, but EP &quot;facto&quot;. However, the new Portuguese language orthographic reform led to the elimination of the writing of the silent consonants also in the EP, making now the writing system virtually identical in all of the Portuguese-speaking countries.

However, BP has retained those silent consonants in a few cases, such as &quot;detectar&quot; (&quot;to detect&quot;). In particular, BP generally distinguishes in sound and writing between &quot;secção&quot; (&quot;section&quot; as in &quot;anatomy&quot; or &quot;drafting&quot;) and &quot;seção&quot; (&quot;section&quot; of an organization); whereas EP uses &quot;secção&quot; for both senses.

Another major set of differences is the BP usage of &quot;ô&quot; or &quot;ê&quot; in many words where EP has &quot;ó&quot; or &quot;é&quot;, such as BP &quot;neurônio&quot; / EP &quot;neurónio&quot; (&quot;neuron&quot;) and BP &quot;arsênico&quot; / EP &quot;arsénico&quot; (&quot;arsenic&quot;). These spelling differences are due to genuinely different pronunciations. In EP, the vowels &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; may be open (&quot;é&quot; or &quot;ó&quot;) or closed (&quot;ê&quot; or &quot;ô&quot;) when they are stressed before one of the nasal consonants &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot; followed by a vowel, but in BP they are always closed in this environment. The variant spellings are necessary in those cases because the general Portuguese spelling rules mandate a stress diacritic in those words, and the Portuguese
diacritics also encode vowel quality.

Another source of variation is the spelling of the sound before &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;. By Portuguese spelling rules, that sound can be written either as &quot;j&quot; (favored in BP for certain words) or &quot;g&quot; (favored in EP). Thus, for example, we have BP &quot;berinjela &quot;/ EP &quot;beringela&quot; (&quot;eggplant&quot;).

==Language register – formal vs. informal ==

The linguistic situation of the BP informal speech in relation to the standard language is controversial. There are authors (Bortoni, Kato, Mattos e Silva, Bagno, Perini) who describe it as a case of diglossia, considering that informal BP has developed, both in phonetics and grammar, in its own particular way.

Accordingly, the formal register of Brazilian Portuguese has a written and spoken form. The written formal register (FW) is used in almost all printed media and written communication, is uniform throughout the country and is the &quot;Portuguese&quot; officially taught at school. The spoken formal register (FS) is essentially a phonetic rendering of the written form. (FS) is used in very formal situations, such as speeches or ceremonies or when reading directly out of a text. While (FS) is necessarily uniform in lexicon and grammar, it shows noticeable regional variations in pronunciation.

===Characteristics of informal Brazilian Portuguese===

The main and most general (i.e. not considering various regional variations) characteristics of the informal variant of BP are the following. While these characteristics are typical of Brazilian speech, some may also be present to varying degrees in other Lusophone areas, particular in Angola, Mozambique and Cabo Verde, which frequently incorporate certain features common to both the South American and European varieties. Although these characteristics would be readily understood in Portugal due to exposure to Brazilian media (and because they are observable in Portugal to some extent as well), other forms are preferred there (except the points concerning &quot;estar&quot; and &quot;dar&quot;).
* dropping the first syllable of the verb &quot;estar&quot; (&quot;[statal/incidental] to be&quot;) throughout the conjugation (&quot;ele tá&quot; (&quot;he&#x27;s&quot;) instead of &quot;ele está&quot; (&quot;he is&quot;), &quot;nós táva(mos/mo)&quot; (&quot;we were&quot;) instead of &quot;nós estávamos&quot; (&quot;we were&quot;)); 
* dropping prepositions before subordinate and relative clauses beginning with conjunctions (&quot;Ele precisa que vocês ajudem&quot; instead of &quot;Ele precisa de que vocês ajudem&quot;);
* replacing &quot;haver&quot; when it means &quot;to exist&quot; with &quot;ter&quot; (&quot;to have&quot;): &quot;Tem muito problema na cidade&quot; (&quot;There are many problems in the city&quot;) is much more frequent in speech than &quot;Há muitos problemas na cidade.&quot;
* lack of third-person object pronouns, which may be replaced by their respective subject pronouns or omitted completely (&quot;eu vi ele&quot; or even just &quot;eu vi&quot; instead of &quot;eu o vi&quot; for &quot;I saw him/it&quot;) 
* lack of second-person verb forms (except for some parts of Brazil) and, in various regions, plural third-person forms as well. For example &quot;tu cantas&quot; becomes &quot;tu canta&quot; or &quot;você canta&quot; (Brazilian uses the pronoun &quot;você&quot; a lot but &quot;tu&quot; is more localized. Some states never use it, but in some places such as Rio Grande do Sul, Ceará and Paraíba &quot;você&quot; is almost never used in informal speech, with &quot;tu&quot; being used instead, using both second and third-person forms depending on the speaker)
* lack of the relative pronoun &quot;cujo/cuja&quot; (&quot;whose&quot;), which is replaced by &quot;que&quot; (&quot;that/which&quot;), either alone (the possession being implied) or along with a possessive pronoun or expression, such as &quot;dele/dela&quot; (&quot;A mulher cujo filho morreu&quot; (&quot;the woman whose son died&quot;) becomes &quot;A mulher que o filho [dela] morreu&quot; (&quot;the woman that [her] son died&quot;))
* frequent use of the pronoun &quot;a gente&quot; (&quot;people&quot;) with 3rd p. sg verb forms instead of the 1st p. pl verb forms and pronoun &quot;nós&quot; (&quot;we/us&quot;), though both are formally correct and &quot;nós&quot; is still much used.
* obligatory in all cases (always &quot;me disseram&quot;, rarely &quot;disseram-me&quot;), as well as use of the pronoun between two verbs in a verbal expression (always &quot;vem me treinando&quot;, never &quot;me vem treinando&quot; or &quot;vem treinando-me&quot;)
* contracting certain high-frequency phrases, which is not necessarily unacceptable in standard BP (&quot;para&quot; &gt; &quot;pra&quot;; &quot;dependo de ele ajudar&quot; &gt; &quot;dependo &#x27;dele&#x27; ajudar&quot;; &quot;com as&quot; &gt; &quot;cas&quot;; &quot;deixa eu ver&quot; &gt; &quot;xo vê/xeu vê&quot;; &quot;você está&quot; &gt; &quot;cê tá&quot; etc.)
* preference for &quot;para&quot; over &quot;a&quot; in the directional meaning (&quot;Para onde você vai?&quot; instead of &quot;Aonde você vai?&quot; (&quot;Where are you going?&quot;))
* use of certain idiomatic expressions, such as &quot;Cadê o carro?&quot; instead of &quot;Onde está o carro?&quot; (&quot;Where is the car?&quot;) 
* lack of indirect object pronouns, especially &quot;lhe&quot;, which are replaced by &quot;para&quot; plus their respective personal pronoun (&quot;Dê um copo de água para ele&quot; instead of &quot;Dê-lhe um copo de água&quot; (&quot;Give him a glass of water&quot;); &quot;Quero mandar uma carta para você&quot; instead of &quot;Quero lhe mandar uma carta&quot; (&quot;I want to send you a letter&quot;)) 
* use of &quot;aí&quot; as a pronoun for indefinite direct objects (similar to French &#x27;en&#x27;). Examples: &quot;fala aí&quot; (&quot;say it&quot;), &quot;esconde aí&quot; (&quot;hide it&quot;), &quot;pera aí&quot; (&quot;espera aí&quot; = &quot;wait a moment&quot;); 
* impersonal use of the verb &quot;dar&quot; (&quot;to give&quot;) to express that something is feasible or permissible. Example: &quot;dá pra eu comer?&quot; (&quot;can/may I eat it?&quot;); &quot;deu pra eu entender&quot; (&quot;I could understand&quot;); &quot;dá pra ver um homem na foto&quot; instead of &quot;pode ver-se um homem na foto&quot; (&quot;it&#x27;s possible to see a man in the picture&quot;)
*though often regarded as &quot;uneducated&quot; by language purists, some regions and social groups tend to avoid &quot;redundant&quot; plural agreement in article-noun-verb sequences in the spoken language, since the plural article alone is sufficient to express plurality. Examples: &quot;os menino vai pra escola&quot; (&quot;the[plural] boy goes to school&quot;) rather than &quot;os meninos vão para a escola&quot; (&quot;the boys go to school&quot;). Gender agreement, however, is always made even when plural agreement is omitted: &quot;os menino esperto&quot; (the smart boys) vs. &quot;as menina esperta&quot; (the smart girls).
* Use of a contraction of the imperative form of the verb &quot;to look&quot; (&quot;olhar&quot; = olha = ó) suffixed to adverbs of the place &quot;aqui&quot; and &quot;ali&quot; (&quot;here&quot; and &quot;there&quot;) when directing someone&#x27;s attention to something: &quot;Olha, o carro dele &#x27;ta ali-ó&quot; (Look, his car&#x27;s there/that&#x27;s where his car is). When this is spoken reproduced in subtitles for audiovisual media, it is usually written in the non-contracted form (&quot;aqui olha&quot;), modern pronunciation notwithstanding.

==Grammar==

===Syntactic and morphological features===

====Topic-prominent language====

Modern linguistic studies have shown that Brazilian Portuguese is a topic-prominent or topic- and subject-prominent language. Sentences with topic are extensively used in Portuguese, perhaps more in Brazilian Portuguese most often by means of turning an element (object or verb) in the sentence into an introductory phrase, on which the body of the sentence constitutes a comment (topicalization), thus emphasizing it, as in &quot;Esses assuntos eu não conheço bem,&quot; literally, &quot;These subjects I don&#x27;t know [them] well&quot; (although this sentence would be perfectly acceptable in Portugal as well). In fact, in the Portuguese language, the anticipation of the verb or object at the beginning of the sentence, repeating it or using the respective pronoun referring to it, is also quite common, e.g. in &quot;Essa menina, eu não sei o que fazer com ela&quot; (&quot;This girl, I don&#x27;t know what to do with her&quot;) or &quot;Com essa menina eu não sei o que fazer&quot; (&quot;With this girl I don&#x27;t know what to do&quot;). The use of redundant pronouns for means of topicalization is considered grammatically incorrect, because the topicalized noun phrase, according to traditional European analysis, has no syntactic function. This kind of construction, however, is often used in European Portuguese. Brazilian grammars traditionally treat this structure similarly, rarely mentioning such a thing as &quot;topic&quot;. Nevertheless, the so-called anacoluthon has taken on a new dimension in Brazilian Portuguese. The poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade once wrote a short &quot;metapoema&quot; (a &quot;metapoem&quot;, i. e., a poem about poetry, a specialty for which he was renowned) treating the concept of &quot;anacoluto&quot;:

In colloquial language, this kind of &quot;anacoluto&quot; may even be used when the subject itself is the topic, only to add more emphasis to this fact, e.g. the sentence &quot;Essa menina, ela costuma tomar conta de cachorros abandonados&quot; (&quot;This girl, she usually takes care of abandoned dogs&quot;). This structure highlights the topic, and could be more accurately translated as &quot;As for this girl, she usually takes care of abandoned dogs.&quot;

The use of this construction is particularly common with compound subjects, as in, e.g., &quot;Eu e ela, nós fomos passear&quot; (&quot;She and I, we went for a walk&quot;). This happens because the traditional syntax (&quot;Eu e ela fomos passear&quot;) places a plural-conjugated verb immediately following an argument in the singular, which may sound unnatural to Brazilian ears. The redundant pronoun thus clarifies the verbal inflection in such cases.

====Progressive====

Portuguese makes extensive use of verbs in the progressive aspect, almost as in English.

Brazilian Portuguese seldom has the present continuous construct estar a&quot; + infinitive, which, in contrast, has become quite common in European over the last few centuries. BP maintains the Classical Portuguese form of continuous expression, which is made by estar&quot; + gerund.

Thus, Brazilians will always write &quot;ela está dançando&quot; (&quot;she is dancing&quot;), not &quot;ela está a dançar&quot;. The same restriction applies to several other uses of the gerund: BP uses &quot;ficamos conversando&quot; (&quot;we kept on talking&quot;) and &quot;ele trabalha cantando&quot; (&quot;he sings while he works&quot;), but rarely &quot;ficamos a conversar&quot; and &quot;ele trabalha a cantar&quot; as is the case in most varieties of EP.

BP retains the combination &quot;a&quot; + infinitive for uses that are not related to continued action, such as &quot;voltamos a correr&quot; (&quot;we went back to running&quot;). Some varieties of EP [namely from Alentejo, Algarve, Açores (Azores), and Madeira] also tend to feature &quot;estar&quot; + gerund, as in Brazil.

====Personal pronouns====

=====Syntax=====

In general, the dialects that gave rise to Portuguese had quite a flexible use of the object pronouns in the proclitic or enclitic positions. In Classical Portuguese, the use of proclisis was very extensive, while, on the contrary, in modern European Portuguese the use of enclisis has become indisputably predominant.

BP normally places the object pronoun before the verb (proclitic position), as in &quot;ele me viu&quot; (&quot;he saw me&quot;). In many such cases, the proclisis would be considered awkward or even grammatically incorrect in EP, in which the pronoun is generally placed after the verb (enclitic position), namely &quot;ele viu-me&quot;. However, formal BP still follows EP in avoiding starting a sentence with a proclitic pronoun, so both will have &quot;Deram-lhe o livro&quot; (&quot;They gave him/her the book&quot;) instead of &quot;Lhe deram o livro&quot;, though it will seldom be spoken in BP (but would be clearly understood). The first-person singular proclitic pronoun frequently occurs at the beginning of a phrase in informal BP when it precedes an imperative, for example, &quot;Me olha&quot; (&quot;Look at me&quot;), &quot;Me avisa quando vocês chegarem em casa&quot; (&quot;Let me know when you (pl.) get home&quot;).

In complex verbal predicates, BP normally has the object pronoun intervening between the auxiliary verb and the main one (&quot;ela vem me pagando&quot; but not &quot;ela me vem pagando&quot; or &quot;ela vem pagando-me&quot;). In some cases, in order to adapt this use to the standard grammar, some Brazilian scholars recommend that &quot;ela vem me pagando&quot; should be written &quot;ela vem-me pagando&quot; (as in EP), in which case the enclisis could be totally acceptable if there were no factor of proclisis. Therefore, this phenomenon may or not be considered improper according to the prescribed grammar, since, according to the case, there could be a factor of proclisis that would not permit the placement of the pronoun between the verbs (e.g. when there is a negative particle near the pronoun, in which case the standard grammar prescribes proclisis: &quot;ela não me vem pagando&quot; and not &quot;ela não vem-me pagando&quot;). Nevertheless, nowadays it is becoming perfectly acceptable to use a clitic between two verbs without linking it with a hyphen (as in &quot;poderia se dizer&quot;, or &quot;não vamos lhes dizer&quot;), and this usage (known as &quot;pronome solto entre dois verbos&quot;) can be found in modern(ist) literature, textbooks, magazines and newspapers like Folha de S.Paulo and O Estadão (see in-house style manuals of these newspapers, available on-line, for more details).

=====Contracted forms=====

BP rarely uses the contracted combinations of direct and indirect object pronouns which are sometimes used in EP, such as &quot;me&quot; + &quot;o&quot; = &quot;mo&quot;, &quot;lhe&quot; + &quot;as&quot; = &quot;lhas&quot;. Instead, the indirect clitic is replaced by preposition + strong pronoun: thus BP writes &quot;ela o deu para mim&quot; (&quot;she gave it to me&quot;) instead of EP &quot;ela deu-mo&quot;; the latter most probably will not be understood by Brazilians, being obsolete in BP.

=====Mesoclisis=====

The mesoclitic placement of pronouns (between the verb stem and its inflection suffix) is viewed as archaic in BP, and therefore is restricted to very formal situations or stylistic texts. Hence the phrase &quot;Eu dar-lhe-ia&quot;, still current in EP, would be normally written &quot;Eu lhe daria&quot; in BP. Incidentally, a marked fondness for enclitic and mesoclitic pronouns was one of the many memorable eccentricities of former Brazilian President Jânio Quadros, as in his famous quote &quot;Bebo-o porque é líquido, se fosse sólido comê-lo-ia&quot; (&quot;I drink it [liquor] because it is liquid, if it were solid I would eat it&quot;)

===Preferences===

There are many differences between formal written BP and EP that are simply a matter of different preferences between two alternative words or constructions that are both officially valid and acceptable.

====Simple versus compound tenses====

A few synthetic tenses are usually replaced by compound tenses, such as in:

:future indicative: &quot;eu cantarei&quot; (simple), &quot;eu vou cantar&quot; (compound, &quot;ir&quot; + infinitive)
:conditional: &quot;eu cantaria&quot; (simple), &quot;eu iria/ia cantar&quot; (compound, &quot;ir&quot; + infinitive)
:past perfect: &quot;eu cantara&quot; (simple), &quot;eu tinha cantado&quot; (compound, &quot;ter&quot; + past participle)

Also, spoken BP usually uses the verb &quot;ter&quot; (&quot;own&quot;, &quot;have&quot;, sense of possession) and rarely &quot;haver&quot; (&quot;have&quot;, sense of existence, or &quot;there to be&quot;), especially as an auxiliary (as it can be seen above) and as a verb of existence.

:written: &quot;ele havia/tinha cantado&quot; (he had sung)
:spoken: &quot;ele tinha cantado&quot;

:written: &quot;ele podia haver/ter dito&quot; (he might have said)
:spoken: &quot;ele podia ter dito&quot;

This phenomenon is also observed in Portugal.

==Differences in formal spoken language==

===Phonology===

In many ways, Brazilian Portuguese (BP) is conservative in its phonology. This is also true of Angolan and São Tomean Portuguese, as well as other African dialects. Brazilian Portuguese has eight oral vowels, five nasal vowels, and several diphthongs and triphthongs, some oral and some nasal.

====Vowels====

* In vernacular varieties, the diphthong is typically monophthongized to , e.g. &quot;sou&quot; &gt; .
* In vernacular varieties, the diphthong is usually monophthongized to , depending on the speaker, e.g. &quot;ferreiro&quot; &gt; .

The reduction of vowels is one of the main phonetic characteristics of Portuguese generally, but in Brazilian Portuguese the intensity and frequency of that phenomenon varies significantly.

Vowels in Brazilian Portuguese generally are pronounced more openly than in European Portuguese, even when reduced. In syllables that follow the stressed syllable, ⟨o⟩ is generally pronounced as , ⟨a⟩ as , and ⟨e⟩ as . Some varieties of BP follow this pattern for vowels &quot;before&quot; the stressed syllable as well, whereas most varieties have the following five vowels before a stressed syllable: , , , and .

In contrast, speakers of European Portuguese pronounce unstressed ⟨a⟩ primarily as , and they elide some unstressed vowels or reduce them to a short, near-close near-back unrounded vowel , a sound that does not exist in BP. Thus, for example, the word &quot;setembro&quot; is in BP, but in European Portuguese.

The main difference among the dialects of Brazilian Portuguese is the frequent presence or absence of open vowels in unstressed syllables. In dialects of the South and Southeast, unstressed ⟨e⟩ and ⟨o⟩ (when they are not reduced to and ) are pronounced as the close-mid vowels and . Thus, &quot;operação&quot; (operation) and &quot;rebolar&quot; (to shake one&#x27;s body) may be pronounced and . Open-mid vowels can occur only in the stressed syllable. An exception is in the formation of diminutives or augmentatives. For example, &quot;cafézinho&quot; (demitasse coffee) and &quot;bolinha&quot; (little ball) are pronounced with open-mid vowels although these vowels are not in stressed position.

Meanwhile, in accents of the Northeast and North, in patterns that have not yet been much studied, the open-mid vowels and can occur in unstressed syllables in a large number of words. Thus, the above examples would be pronounced and .

Another difference between Northern/Northeastern dialects and Southern/Southeastern ones is the pattern of nasalization of vowels before ⟨m⟩ and ⟨n⟩. In all dialects and all syllables, orthographic ⟨m⟩ or ⟨n⟩ followed by another consonant represents nasalization of the preceding vowel. But when the ⟨m⟩ or ⟨n⟩ is syllable-initial (i.e. followed by a vowel), it represents nasalization only of a preceding &quot;stressed&quot; vowel in the South and Southeast, as compared to nasalization of &quot;any&quot; vowel, regardless of stress, in the Northeast and North. A famous example of this distinction is the word &quot;banana&quot;, which a Northeasterner would pronounce , while a Southerner would pronounce .

Vowel nasalization in some dialects of Brazilian Portuguese is very different from that of French, for example. In French, the nasalization extends uniformly through the entire vowel, whereas in the Southern-Southeastern dialects of Brazilian Portuguese, the nasalization begins almost imperceptibly and then becomes stronger toward the end of the vowel. In this respect it is more similar to the nasalization of Hindi-Urdu (see Anusvara). In some cases, the nasal archiphoneme even entails the insertion of a nasal consonant such as (compare ), as in the following examples:

* &quot;banco&quot; 
* &quot;tempo&quot; 
* &quot;pinta&quot; 
* &quot;sombra&quot; 
* &quot;mundo&quot; 
* &quot;fã&quot; 
* &quot;bem&quot; 
* &quot;vim&quot; 
* &quot;bom&quot; 
* &quot;um&quot; 
* &quot;mãe&quot; 
* &quot;pão&quot; 
* &quot;põe&quot; 
* &quot;muito&quot; 

====Consonants====

===== Palatalization of /di/ and /ti/ =====

One of the most noticeable tendencies of modern BP is the palatalization of and by most regions, which are pronounced and , respectively, before . The word &quot;presidente&quot; &quot;president,&quot; for example, is pronounced in these regions of Brazil but in Portugal. 

The pronunciation probably began in Rio de Janeiro and is often still associated with this city but is now standard in many other states and major cities, such as Belo Horizonte and Salvador, and it has spread more recently to some regions of São Paulo (because of migrants from other regions), where it is common in most speakers under 40 or so. 

It has always been standard in Brazil&#x27;s Japanese community since it is also a feature of Japanese. The regions that still preserve the unpalatalized and are mostly in the Northeast and South of Brazil by the stronger influence from European Portuguese (Northeast), and from Italian and Argentine Spanish (South).

===== Palatalization of /li/ and /ni/ =====

Another common change that differentiates Brazilian Portuguese from other dialect groups is the palatalization of and followed by the vowel , yielding and . &quot;menina&quot;, &quot;girl&quot; ; &quot;Babilônia&quot;, &quot;Babylon&quot; ; &quot;limão&quot;, &quot;lemon&quot; ; &quot;sandália&quot;, &quot;sandal&quot; .

===== Epenthetic glide before final /s/ =====

A change that is in the process of spreading in BP and perhaps started in the Northeast is the insertion of after stressed vowels before at the end of a syllable. It began in the context of (&quot;mas&quot; &quot;but&quot; is now pronounced in most of Brazil, making it homophonous with &quot;mais&quot; &quot;more&quot;). 

Also, the change is spreading to other final vowels, and at least in the Northeast and the Southeast, the normal pronunciation of &quot;voz&quot; &quot;voice&quot; is . Similarly, &quot;três&quot; &quot;three&quot; becomes , making it rhyme with &quot;seis&quot; &quot;six&quot; ; this may explain the common Brazilian replacement of &quot;seis&quot; with &quot;meia&quot; (&quot;half&quot;, as in &quot;half a dozen&quot;) when pronouncing phone numbers.

=====Epenthesis in consonant clusters=====

BP tends to break up consonant clusters, if the second consonant is not , , or , by inserting an epenthetic vowel, , which can also be characterized, in some situations, as a schwa. The phenomenon happens mostly in the pretonic position and with the consonant clusters &quot;ks&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;bj&quot;, &quot;dj&quot;, &quot;dv&quot;, &quot;kt&quot;, &quot;bt&quot;, &quot;ft&quot;, &quot;mn&quot;, &quot;tm&quot; and &quot;dm&quot;: clusters that are not very common in the language (&quot;afta&quot;: ; &quot;opção&quot; : &gt; ).

However, in some regions of Brazil (such as some Northeastern dialects), there has been an opposite tendency to reduce the unstressed into a very weak vowel so &quot;partes&quot; or &quot;destratar&quot; are often realized similarly to and . Sometimes, the phenomenon occurs even more intensely in unstressed posttonic vowels (except the final ones) and causes the reduction of the word and the creation of new consonant clusters (&quot;prática&quot; ; &quot;máquina&quot; ; &quot;abóbora&quot; ; &quot;cócega&quot; ).

=====L-vocalization and suppression of final r=====

The syllable-final is pronounced , and the syllable-final rhotic is the hard in the North and Northeast, while the state of São Paulo and the South conserve the tap . This, along with other adaptations, sometimes results in rather striking transformations of common loanwords. 

The brand name &quot;McDonald&#x27;s,&quot; for example, is rendered , and the word &quot;rock&quot; (the music) is rendered as . Given that historical and no longer appear in syllable-final position (having been replaced by nasalization of the preceding vowel), these varieties of BP have come to strongly favor open syllables.

A related aspect of BP is the suppression of the phrase-final rhotic, even in formal speech, except before a word-initial vowel. Compare &quot;matar&quot; &#x27;to kill&#x27; with &quot;matar o tempo&quot; &#x27;to kill time&#x27;. The same suppression also happens occasionally in EP, but much less often than in BP. (&quot;Compare: linking r in non-rhotic English dialects&quot;).

=====Nasalization=====

Nasalization is very common in many BP dialects and is especially noticeable in vowels before or in the syllable onset. For the same reason, open vowels (which are not normally under nasalization in Portuguese) cannot occur before or in BP, but can in EP. This nasalization sometimes affects the spelling of words. For example, &quot;harmónico&quot; &quot;harmonic&quot; is &quot;harmônico&quot; in BP. It also can affect verbal paradigms: Portuguese distinguishes &quot;falamos&quot; &quot;we speak&quot; from &#x27;falámos&#x27; &quot;we spoke,&quot; but in BP, it is written and pronounced &quot;falamos&quot; for both.

Related is the difference in pronunciation of the consonant represented by &quot;nh&quot; in most BP dialects. It is always in Portuguese, but in some regions of Brazil, it represents a nasalized semivowel , which nasalizes the preceding vowel as well: &quot;manhãzinha&quot; (&quot;early morning&quot;).

=====Palatalization of the syllable-final sibilants=====

European Portuguese consistently realizes the syllable-final sibilants as palatal (depending on the voicing of the following sound), while most dialects of BP maintain them as dentals. Whether such a change happens in BP is highly variable according to dialect. Rio de Janeiro and a few states in the Northeast are particularly known for such pronunciation; São Paulo, on the other hand, along with most other Brazilian dialects, is particularly known for lacking it. 

In the Northeast, it is more likely to happen before a consonant than word-finally, and it varies from region to region. Some dialects (such as that of Pernambuco) have the same pattern as Rio, while in several other dialects (such as that of Ceará), the palatal replace only before the consonants and .

=====Other phonetic changes=====

Several sound changes that historically affected European Portuguese were not shared by BP. Consonant changes in European Portuguese include the weakening of , , and to fricatives , , and , while in BP these phonemes are maintained as stops in all positions. A vowel change in European Portuguese that does not occur in BP is the lowering of to before the palatals () and in the diphthong &quot;em&quot; , which merges with the diphthong &quot;ãe&quot; normally, but not in BP.

==Differences in the informal spoken language==

There are various differences between European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese, such as the dropping of the second-person conjugations (and, in some dialects, of the second-person pronoun itself) in everyday usage and the use of subject pronouns () as direct objects.

===Grammar===

Spoken Brazilian Portuguese usage differs from Standard Portuguese usage. The differences include the placement of clitic pronouns and, in Brazil, the use of subject pronouns as objects in the third person. Nonstandard verb inflections are also common in colloquial Brazilian Portuguese.

====Affirmation and negation====

Spoken Portuguese rarely uses the affirmation adverb sim (&quot;yes&quot;) in informal speech. Instead, the usual reply is a repetition of the verb of the question (as in the Celtic languages):

BP: 
:&quot; — Você foi na/à/pra biblioteca?&quot;
:&quot; — Fui.&quot;
or
:&quot; — Tu foste/foi na/à/pra biblioteca?&quot;
:&quot; — Fui.&quot;

Translation
:&quot;Have you gone to the library yet?&quot;
:&quot;Yes, I went there.&quot;

In BP, it is common to form a yes–no question as a declarative sentence followed by the tag question &quot;não é?&quot; (&quot;isn&#x27;t it?&quot;), contracted in informal speech to &quot;né?&quot; (compare English &quot;He is a teacher, isn&#x27;t he?&quot;). The affirmative answer to such a question is a repetition of the verb &quot;é&quot;:

BP:

— &quot;Ele não fez o que devia, né?&quot; (&quot;He didn&#x27;t do what he should have, did he?&quot;)

— &quot;É.&quot; (&quot;Right, he didn&#x27;t.&quot;)

or

— &quot;Ela já foi atriz, né?&quot; (&quot;She had already been an actress, hadn&#x27;t she?&quot;)

— &quot;É.&quot; (&quot;She already had.&quot;) Or – &quot;É, sim, ela já foi.&quot; (If a longer answer is preferred.)

It is also common to negate statements twice for emphasis, with &quot;não&quot; (&quot;no&quot;) before and after the verb:

BP: 
:&quot; — Você fala inglês?&quot;
:&quot; — Não falo, não.&quot;
:&quot;Do you speak English?&quot;
:&quot;I don&#x27;t speak [it], no.&quot;

Sometimes, even a triple negative is possible:

:&quot; — Você fala inglês?&quot;
:&quot; — Não. Não falo, não&quot;
:&quot;Do you speak English?&quot;
:&quot;No. I don&#x27;t speak it, no.&quot;

In some regions, the first &quot;não&quot; of a &quot;não...não&quot; pair is pronounced .

In some cases, the redundancy of the first &quot;não&quot; results in its omission, which makes BP a likely example of Jespersen&#x27;s Cycle:

BP:

&quot; — Você fala inglês?&quot;
:&quot; — Falo não.&quot; (&quot;[I] speak not&quot;)

Translation
:&quot;Do you speak English?&quot;
:&quot;No, I don&#x27;t.&quot;

====Imperative====

Standard Portuguese forms a command according to the grammatical person of the subject (who is ordered to do the action) by using either the imperative form of the verb or the present subjunctive. Thus, one should use different inflections according to the pronoun used as the subject: &quot;tu&quot; (&#x27;you&#x27;, the grammatical second person with the imperative form) or &quot;você&quot; (&#x27;you&#x27;, the grammatical third person with the present subjunctive):

:&quot;Tu és burro, cala a boca! (cala-te)&quot;
:&quot;Você é burro, cale a boca! (cale-se)&quot;
:&quot;You are stupid, shut your mouth! (shut up)&quot;

Currently, several dialects of BP have largely lost the second-person pronouns, but even they use the second-person imperative in addition to the third-person present subjunctive form that should be used with &quot;você&quot;:

:BP: &quot;Você é burro, cale a boca!&quot; OR

:BP: &quot;Você é burro, cala a boca!&quot; (considered grammatically incorrect, but completely dominant in informal language)

Brazilian Portuguese uses the second-person imperative forms even when referring to &quot;você&quot; and not &quot;tu&quot;, in the case of the verb &quot;ser&quot; &#x27;to be (permanently)&#x27; and &quot;estar&quot; &#x27;to be (temporarily)&#x27;, the second-person imperative &quot;sê&quot; and &quot;está&quot; are never used; the third-person subjunctive forms &quot;seja&quot; and &quot;esteja&quot; may be used instead.

The negative command forms use the subjunctive present tense forms of the verb. However, as for the second person forms, Brazilian Portuguese traditionally does not use the subjunctive-derived ones in spoken language. Instead, they employ the imperative forms: &quot;Não anda,&quot; rather than the grammatically correct &quot;Não andes.&quot;

As for other grammatical persons, there is no such phenomenon because both the positive imperative and the negative imperative forms are from their respective present tense forms in the subjunctive mood: &quot;Não jogue papel na grama&quot; (Don&#x27;t throw paper on the grass); &quot;Não fume&quot; (Don&#x27;t smoke).

====Deictics====

In spoken Brazilian Portuguese, the first two adjectives/pronouns usually merge:

:&quot;Esse&quot; &#x27;this (one)&#x27; [near the speaker] / &#x27;that (one)&#x27; [near the addressee]
:&quot;Aquele&quot; &#x27;that (one)&#x27; [away from both]

Example:

:&quot;Essa é minha camiseta nova.&quot; (BP)
:This is my new T-shirt.

Perhaps as a means of avoiding or clarifying some ambiguities created by the fact that &quot;este&quot; ( &gt; ) and &quot;esse&quot; have merged into the same word, informal BP often uses the demonstrative pronoun with some adverb that indicates its placement in relation to the addressee: if there are two skirts in a room and one says, &quot;Pega essa saia para mim&quot; (Take this skirt for me), there may be some doubt about which of them must be taken so one may say &quot;Pega essa aí&quot; (Take this one there near you&quot;) in the original sense of the use of &quot;essa&quot;, or &quot;Pega essa saia aqui&quot; (Take this one here).

====Personal pronouns and possessives====

=====&quot;Tu&quot; and &quot;você&quot;=====

In many dialects of BP, você (formal &quot;you&quot;) replaces tu (informal &quot;you&quot;). The object pronoun, however, is still te (). Also, other forms such as &quot;teu&quot; (possessive), ti (postprepositional), and contigo (&quot;with you&quot;) are still common in most regions of Brazil, especially in areas in which &quot;tu&quot; is still frequent.

Hence, the combination of object &quot;te&quot; with subject &quot;você&quot; in informal BP: &quot;eu te disse para você ir&quot; (I told you that you should go). In addition, in all the country, the imperative forms may also be the same as the formal second-person forms, but it is argued by some that it is the third-person singular indicative which doubles as the imperative: &quot;fala o que você fez&quot; instead of &quot;fale o que você fez&quot; (&quot;say what you did&quot;).

In areas in which você has largely replaced tu, the forms &quot;ti/te&quot; and &quot;contigo&quot; may be replaced by &quot;você&quot; and &quot;com você&quot;. Therefore, either &quot;você&quot; (following the verb) or &quot;te&quot; (preceding the verb) can be used as the object pronoun in informal BP. 

A speaker may thus end up saying &quot;I love you&quot; in two ways: &quot;eu amo você&quot; or &quot;eu te amo&quot;. In parts of the Northeast, most specifically in the states of Piauí and Pernambuco, it is also common to use the indirect object pronoun &quot;lhe&quot; as a second-person object pronoun: &quot;eu lhe amo&quot;.

In parts of the South, in most of the North and most of the Northeast, and in the city of Santos, the distinction between semi-formal &#x27;você&#x27; and familiar &#x27;tu&#x27; is still maintained, and object and possessive pronouns pattern likewise. In the Paraná state capital, Curitiba, &#x27;tu&#x27; is not generally used.

In Rio de Janeiro and minor parts of the Northeast (interior of some states and some speakers from the coast), both &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;você&quot; (and associated object and possessive pronouns) are used interchangeably with little or no difference (sometimes even in the same sentence). In Salvador, tu is never used and is replaced by você.

Most Brazilians who use &quot;tu&quot; use it with the third-person verb: &quot;tu vai ao banco.&quot; &quot;Tu&quot; with the second-person verb can still be found in Maranhão, Pernambuco, Piauí, Santa Catarina, and in the Amazofonia dialect region (e.g. Manaus, Belém). 

A few cities in Rio Grande do Sul (but in the rest of the state speakers may or may not use it in more formal speech), mainly near the border with Uruguay, have a slightly different pronunciation in some instances (&quot;tu vieste&quot; becomes &quot;tu viesse&quot;), which is also present in Santa Catarina and Pernambuco. In the states of Pará and Amazonas, &quot;tu&quot; is used much more often than &quot;você&quot; and is always accompanied by a second-person verb (&quot;tu queres&quot;, tu &quot;viste&quot;).

In São Paulo, the use of &quot;tu&quot; in print and conversation is no longer very common and is replaced by &quot;você&quot;. However, São Paulo is now home to many immigrants of Northeastern origin, who may employ &quot;tu&quot; quite often in their everyday speech. &quot;Você&quot; is predominant in most of the Southeastern and Center Western regions; it is almost entirely prevalent in the states of Minas Gerais (apart from portions of the countryside, such as the region of São João da Ponte, where &quot;tu&quot; is also present) and Espírito Santo, but &quot;tu&quot; is frequent in Santos and all coastal region of São Paulo state as well as some cities in the countryside.

In most of Brazil &quot;você&quot; is often reduced to even more contracted forms, resulting &quot;ocê&quot; (mostly in the Caipira dialect) and, especially, &quot;cê&quot; because &quot;vo-&quot; is an unstressed syllable and so is dropped in rapid speech.

The table for 2nd person singular conjugation in Brazilian Portuguese is presented below:
=====Third-person direct object pronouns=====

In spoken informal registers of BP, the third-person object pronouns &#x27;o&#x27;, &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;os&#x27;, and &#x27;as&#x27; are virtually nonexistent and are simply left out or, when necessary and usually only when referring to people, replaced by stressed subject pronouns like &quot;ele&quot; &quot;he&quot; or &quot;isso&quot; &quot;that&quot;: &quot;Eu vi ele&quot; &quot;I saw him&quot; rather than &quot;Eu o vi&quot;.

=====&quot;Seu&quot; and &quot;dele&quot;=====

When &quot;você&quot; is strictly a second-person pronoun, the use of possessive &quot;seu/sua&quot; may turn some phrases quite ambiguous since one would wonder whether seu/sua refers to the second person &quot;você&quot; or to the third person &quot;ele/ela&quot;.

BP thus tends to use the third-person possessive &#x27;seu&#x27; to mean &quot;your&quot; since &quot;você&quot; is a third-person pronoun and uses &#x27;dele&#x27;, &#x27;dela&#x27;, &#x27;deles&#x27;, and &#x27;delas&#x27; (&quot;of him/her/them&quot; and placed after the noun) as third-person possessive forms. If no ambiguity could arise (especially in narrative texts), &quot;seu&quot; is also used to mean &#x27;his&#x27; or &#x27;hers&#x27;.

Both forms (&#x27;seu&#x27; or &#x27;dele(s) /dela(s)&#x27;) are considered grammatically correct in Brazilian Portuguese.

=====Definite article before possessive=====

In Portuguese, one may or may not include the definite article before a possessive pronoun (&quot;meu livro&quot; or &quot;o meu livro&quot;, for instance). The variants of use in each dialect of Portuguese are mostly a matter of preference: it does not usually mean a dialect completely abandoned either form.

In Southeastern Brazilian Portuguese, especially in the standard dialects of the cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, the definite article is normally used as in Portugal, but many speakers do not use it at the beginning of the sentence or in titles: &quot;Minha novela&quot;, &quot;Meu tio matou um cara&quot;. 

In Northeastern BP dialects and in Central and Northern parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro (starting from Niterói), rural parts of Minas Gerais, and all over Espírito Santo State, speakers tend to but do not always drop the definite article, but both &quot;esse é o meu gato&quot; and &quot;esse é meu gato&quot; are likely in speech.

Formal written Brazilian Portuguese tends, however, to omit the definite article in accordance with prescriptive grammar rules derived from Classical Portuguese even if the alternative form is also considered correct, but many teachers consider it inelegant.

=====Syntax=====

Some of the examples on the right side of the table below are colloquial or regional in Brazil. Literal translations are provided to illustrate how word order changes between varieties.

Word order in the first Brazilian Portuguese example is frequent in European Portuguese. Similar to the subordinate clauses like &quot;Sabes que eu te amo&quot; &quot;You know &quot;that I love you,&quot;&quot; but not in simple sentences like &quot;I love you.&quot; 

However, in Portugal, an object pronoun would never be placed at the start of a sentence, as in the second example. The example in the bottom row of the table, with its deletion of &quot;redundant&quot; inflections, is considered ungrammatical, but it is nonetheless dominant in Brazil throughout all social classes.

====Use of prepositions====

Just as in the case of English, whose various dialects sometimes use different prepositions with the same verbs or nouns (&quot;stand in/on line, in/on the street&quot;), BP usage sometimes requires prepositions that would not be normally used in Portuguese for the same context.

=====&quot;Chamar de&quot;=====

&quot;Chamar&quot; &#x27;call&#x27; is normally used with the preposition &quot;de&quot; in BP, especially when it means &#x27;to describe someone as&#x27;:

:&quot;Chamei ele de ladrão.&quot; (BP)
:I called him a thief.

=====&quot;Em&quot; with verbs of movement=====

When movement to a place is described, BP uses &quot;em&quot; (contracted with an article, if necessary):

:&quot;Fui na praça.&quot; (BP)
:I went to the square. [temporarily]

In BP, the preposition &quot;para&quot; can also be used with such verbs with no difference in meaning:

:&quot;Fui para a praça.&quot; (BP)
:I went to the square. [definitively]

== Dialects ==

Brazil, due to its continental size and the immigration to Brazil that colonized and populated the country for centuries, has different dialects throughout the national territory, even so it is perfectly possible for a Brazilian to understand a different dialect from the other end of the country, because writing is the same, and often the pronunciation is the same, just changing the sound of some letter or group of letters, like what happens too in the different Regions of the United States. And as for Portuguese from Portugal, it is the same thing about the difference in accent between English from United States and English from United Kingdom.

# &quot;Caipira&quot; — Spoken in the states of São Paulo (mostly in the countryside and rural areas); southern Minas Gerais, northern Paraná and southeastern Mato Grosso do Sul. Depending on the vision of what constitutes &quot;caipira&quot;, Triângulo Mineiro, border areas of Goiás and the remaining parts of Mato Grosso do Sul are included, and the frontier of &quot;caipira&quot; in Minas Gerais is expanded further northerly, though not reaching metropolitan Belo Horizonte. It is often said that &quot;caipira&quot; appeared by decreolization of the língua brasílica and the related língua geral paulista, then spoken in almost all of what is now São Paulo, a former lingua franca in most of the contemporary Centro-Sul of Brazil before the 18th century, brought by the &quot;bandeirantes&quot;, interior pioneers of Colonial Brazil, closely related to its northern counterpart Nheengatu, and that is why the dialect shows many general differences from other variants of the language. It has striking remarkable differences in comparison to other Brazilian dialects in phonology, prosody and grammar, often stigmatized as being strongly associated with a substandard variant, now mostly rural.
# &quot;Cearense&quot; or &quot;Costa norte&quot; — is a dialect spoken more sharply in the states of Ceará and Piauí. The variant of Ceará includes fairly distinctive traits it shares with the one spoken in Piauí, though, such as distinctive regional phonology and vocabulary (for example, a debuccalization process stronger than that of Portuguese, a different system of the vowel harmony that spans Brazil from &quot;fluminense&quot; and &quot;mineiro&quot; to &quot;amazofonia&quot; but is especially prevalent in &quot;nordestino&quot;, a very coherent coda sibilant palatalization as those of Portugal and Rio de Janeiro but allowed in fewer environments than in other accents of &quot;nordestino&quot;, a greater presence of dental stop palatalization to palato-alveolar in comparison to other accents of &quot;nordestino&quot;, among others, as well as a great number of archaic Portuguese words).
# &quot;Baiano&quot; — Found in Bahia. Similar to &quot;nordestino&quot;, it has a very characteristic syllable-timed rhythm and the greatest tendency to pronounce unstressed vowels as open-mid and .
# &quot;Fluminense&quot; — A broad dialect with many variants spoken in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and neighbouring eastern regions of Minas Gerais. &quot;Fluminense&quot; formed in these previously &quot;caipira&quot;-speaking areas due to the gradual influence of European migrants, causing many people to distance their speech from their original dialect and incorporate new terms. &quot;Fluminense&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;carioca&quot;, however &quot;carioca&quot; is a more specific term referring to the accent of the Greater Rio de Janeiro area by speakers with a &quot;fluminense&quot; dialect.
# &quot;Sulriograndense or Gaúcho&quot; — in Rio Grande do Sul, similar to &quot;sulista&quot;. There are many distinct accents in Rio Grande do Sul, mainly due to the heavy influx of European immigrants of diverse origins who have settled in colonies throughout the state, and to the proximity to Spanish-speaking nations. The &quot;gaúcho&quot; word in itself is a Spanish loanword into Portuguese of obscure Indigenous Amerindian origins. 
# &quot;Mineiro&quot; — Minas Gerais in center, east and southeast regions. As the &quot;fluminense&quot; area, its associated region was formerly a sparsely populated land where &quot;caipira&quot; dialect was briefly spoken, but the discovery of gold and gems made it the most prosperous Brazilian region, which attracted Portuguese colonists and commoners - called &quot;emboabas&quot; - from other parts of Brazil along with their African slaves. In the beginning of the 18th Century, the &quot;caipiras&quot; fled from Minas Gerais after the War of the Emboabas, which lasted for two years (1707 to 1709). Central Minas Gerais, then, developed an autochthonous and endemic accent, spoken nowadays by half of its population. Southern and western areas of the state have a distinctive accent, &quot;caipira&quot;, and the northern area has an accent called &quot;geraizeiro&quot;. The sociolect of prestige of &quot;mineiro&quot; spoken in the state capital, Belo Horizonte, is the accent from Brazilian Portuguese that is the nearest to the artificial accent called Standard Brazilian Portuguese, in Portuguese named &quot;dialeto neutro&quot;. Standard Brazilian Portuguese is used in media (radio and television), like Received English and American Standard English. A 2023 study, conducted by a language learning app, showed that &quot;mineiro&quot; is the most charming dialect of Brazilian Portuguese.
# &quot;Nordestino&quot; — more marked in the Sertão (7), where, in the 19th and 20th centuries and especially in the area including and surrounding the &quot;sertão&quot; (the dry land after Agreste) of Pernambuco and southern Ceará, it could sound less comprehensible to speakers of other Portuguese dialects than Galician or Rioplatense Spanish, and nowadays less distinctive from other variants in the metropolitan cities along the coasts. It can be divided in two regional variants: one that includes the northern Maranhão and southern of Piauí and another that goes from Ceará to Alagoas.
# &quot;Nortista&quot; or &quot;Amazofonia&quot; — Most of Amazon Basin states i.e. Northern Brazil. Before the 20th century, most people from the &quot;nordestino&quot; area fleeing the droughts and their associated poverty settled here, so it has some similarities with the Portuguese dialect there spoken. The speech in and around the cities of Belém and Manaus has a more European flavor in phonology, prosody and grammar.
# &quot;Paulistano&quot; — Variants spoken around Greater São Paulo in its maximum definition and more easterly areas of São Paulo state, as well perhaps &quot;educated speech&quot; from anywhere in the state of São Paulo (where it coexists with &quot;caipira&quot;). &quot;Caipira&quot; is the hinterland sociolect of much of the Central-Southern half of Brazil, nowadays conservative only in the rural areas and associated with them, that has a historically low prestige in cities as Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, Belo Horizonte, and until some years ago, in São Paulo itself. Sociolinguistics, or what by times is described as &#x27;linguistic prejudice&#x27;, often correlated with classism, is a polemic topic in the entirety of the country since the times of Adoniran Barbosa. Also, the &quot;Paulistano&quot; accent was heavily influenced by the presence of immigrants in the city of São Paulo, especially the Italians.
# &quot;Sertanejo&quot; — Center-Western states, and also much of Tocantins and Rondônia. It is closer to &quot;mineiro&quot;, &quot;caipira&quot;, &quot;nordestino&quot; or &quot;nortista&quot; depending on the location.
# &quot;Sulista&quot; — The variants spoken in the areas between the northern regions of Rio Grande do Sul and southern regions of São Paulo state, encompassing most of southern Brazil. The city of Curitiba does have a fairly distinct accent as well, and a relative majority of speakers around and in Florianópolis also speak this variant (many speak &quot;florianopolitano&quot; or &quot;manezinho da ilha&quot; instead, related to the European Portuguese dialects spoken in Azores and Madeira). Speech of northern Paraná is closer to that of inland São Paulo.
# &quot;Florianopolitano&quot; — Variants heavily influenced by European Portuguese spoken in Florianópolis city (due to a heavy immigration movement from Portugal, mainly its insular regions) and much of its metropolitan area, Grande Florianópolis, said to be a continuum between those whose speech most resemble &quot;sulista&quot; dialects and those whose speech most resemble &quot;fluminense&quot; and European ones, called, often pejoratively, &quot;manezinho da ilha&quot;.
# &quot;Carioca&quot; — Not a dialect, but sociolects of the &quot;fluminense&quot; variant spoken in an area roughly corresponding to Greater Rio de Janeiro. It appeared after locals came in contact with the Portuguese aristocracy amidst the Portuguese royal family fled in the early 19th century. There is actually a continuum between vernacular countryside accents and the &quot;carioca&quot; sociolect, and the educated speech (in Portuguese &quot;norma culta&quot;, which most closely resembles other Brazilian Portuguese standards but with marked recent Portuguese influences, the nearest ones among the country&#x27;s dialects along &quot;florianopolitano&quot;), so that not all people native to the state of Rio de Janeiro speak the said sociolect, but most &quot;carioca&quot; speakers will use the standard variant not influenced by it that is rather uniform around Brazil depending on context (emphasis or formality, for example).
# &quot;Brasiliense&quot; — used in Brasília and its metropolitan area. It is not considered a dialect, but more of a regional variant – often deemed to be closer to &quot;fluminense&quot; than the dialect commonly spoken in most of Goiás, &quot;sertanejo&quot;.
# &quot;Arco do desflorestamento&quot; or &quot;serra amazônica&quot; — Known in its region as the &quot;accent of the migrants,&quot; it has similarities with &quot;caipira&quot;, &quot;sertanejo&quot; and often &quot;sulista&quot; that make it differing from &quot;amazofonia&quot; (in the opposite group of Brazilian dialects, in which it is placed along &quot;nordestino&quot;, &quot;baiano&quot;, &quot;mineiro&quot; and &quot;fluminense&quot;). It is the most recent dialect, which appeared by the settlement of families from various other Brazilian regions attracted by the cheap land offer in recently deforested areas.
# &quot;Recifense&quot; — used in Recife and its metropolitan area.

==Diglossia==

According to some contemporary Brazilian linguists (Bortoni, Kato, Mattos e Silva, Perini, and most recently, with great impact, Bagno), Brazilian Portuguese may be a highly diglossic language. This theory claims that there is an L-variant (termed &quot;Brazilian Vernacular&quot;), which would be the mother tongue of most Brazilians, and an H-variant (standard Brazilian Portuguese) acquired through schooling.

L-variant represents a simplified form of the language (in terms of grammar, but not of phonetics) that could have evolved from 16th-century Portuguese, influenced by Amerindian (mostly Tupi) and African languages, while H-variant would be based on 19th-century European Portuguese (and very similar to Standard European Portuguese, with only minor differences in spelling and grammar usage).

Mário A. Perini, a Brazilian linguist, even compares the depth of the differences between L- and H- variants of Brazilian Portuguese with those between Standard Spanish and European Portuguese. However, his proposal is not widely accepted by either grammarians or academics. Milton M. Azevedo wrote a chapter on diglossia in his monograph: &quot;Portuguese language (A linguistic introduction)&quot;, published by Cambridge University Press in 2005.

===Usage===

From this point of view, the L-variant is the spoken form of Brazilian Portuguese, which should be avoided only in very formal speech (court interrogation, political debate) while the H-variant is the written form of Brazilian Portuguese, avoided only in informal writing (such as song lyrics, love letters, intimate friends correspondence). Even teachers which teach Portuguese as a subject frequently use the L-variant while explaining students the structure and usage of the H-variant; in essays, nevertheless, all students are expected to use H-variant.

The L-variant may be used in songs, movies, soap operas, sitcoms and other television shows, although, at times, the H-variant is used in historic films or soap operas to make the language used sound more &#x27;elegant&#x27; or &#x27;archaic&#x27;. The H-variant used to be preferred when dubbing foreign films and series into Brazilian Portuguese, but nowadays the L-variant is preferred, although this seems to lack evidence. Movie subtitles normally use a mixture of L- and H-variants, but remain closer to the H-variant.

Most literary works are written in the H-variant. There would have been attempts at writing in the L-variant (such as the masterpiece &quot;Macunaíma&quot; by Brazilian modernist Mário de Andrade and &quot;Grande Sertão: Veredas&quot; by João Guimarães Rosa), but, presently, the L-variant is claimed to be used only in dialogue. Still, many contemporary writers like using the H-variant even in informal dialogue. This is also true of translated books, which never use the L-variant, only the H one. Children&#x27;s books seem to be more L-friendly, but, again, if they are translated from another language (&quot;The Little Prince&quot;, for instance) they will use the H-variant only.

===Prestige===

This theory also posits that the matter of diglossia in Brazil is further complicated by forces of political and cultural bias, though those are not clearly named. Language is sometimes a tool of social exclusion or social choice.

Mário A. Perini, a Brazilian linguist, has said:

&quot;There are two languages in Brazil. The one we write (and which is called &quot;Portuguese&quot;), and another one that we speak (which is so despised that there is not a name to call it). The latter is the mother tongue of Brazilians, the former has to be learned in school, and a majority of population does not manage to master it appropriately... Personally, I do not object to us writing Portuguese, but I think it is important to make clear that Portuguese is (at least in Brazil) only a written language. Our mother tongue is not Portuguese, but Brazilian Vernacular. This is not a slogan, nor a political statement, it is simply recognition of a fact... There are linguistic teams working hard in order to give the full description of the structure of the Vernacular. So, there are hopes, that within some years, we will have appropriate grammars of our mother tongue, the language that has been ignored, denied and despised for such a long time.&quot;

According to Milton M. Azevedo (Brazilian linguist):

&quot;The relationship between Vernacular Brazilian Portuguese and the formal prescriptive variety fulfills the basic conditions of Ferguson&#x27;s definition [of diglossia]...[...] Considering the difficulty encountered by vernacular speakers to acquire the standard, an understanding of those relationships appears to have broad educational significance. The teaching of Portuguese has traditionally meant imparting a prescriptive formal standard based on a literary register (Cunha 1985: 24) that is often at variance with the language with which students are familiar. As in a diglossic situation, vernacular speakers must learn to read and write in a dialect they neither speak nor fully understand, a circumstance that may have a bearing on the high dropout rate in elementary schools...&quot;

According to Bagno (1999), the two variants coexist and intermingle quite seamlessly, but their status is not clear-cut. Brazilian Vernacular is still frowned upon by most grammarians and language teachers. Some of this minority, of which Bagno is an example, appeal to their readers by their ideas that grammarians would be detractors of the termed Brazilian Vernacular, by naming it a &quot;corrupt&quot; form of the &quot;pure&quot; standard, an attitude which they classify as &quot;linguistic prejudice&quot;. Their arguments include the postulate that the Vernacular form simplifies some of the intricacies of standard Portuguese (verbal conjugation, pronoun handling, plural forms, etc.).

Bagno denounces the prejudice against the vernacular in what he terms the &quot;8 Myths&quot;:

# There is a striking uniformity in Brazilian Portuguese
# A large number of Brazilians speak Portuguese poorly while in Portugal people speak it very well
# Portuguese is difficult to learn and speak
# People that have had poor education can&#x27;t speak anything correctly
# In the state of Maranhão people speak a better Portuguese than elsewhere in Brazil
# We should speak as closely as possible to the written language
# The knowledge of grammar is essential to the correct and proper use of a language
# To master Standard Portuguese is the path to social promotion

In opposition to the &quot;myths&quot;, Bagno counters that:

# The uniformity of Brazilian Portuguese is just about what linguistics would predict for such a large country whose population has not, generally, been literate for centuries and which has experienced considerable foreign influence, that is, this uniformity is more apparent than real.
# Brazilians speak Standard Portuguese poorly because they speak a language that is sufficiently different from Standard Portuguese so that the latter sounds almost &quot;foreign&quot; to them. In terms of comparison, it is easier for many Brazilians to understand someone from a Spanish-speaking South American country than someone from Portugal because the spoken varieties of Portuguese on either side of the Atlantic have diverged to the point of nearly being mutually unintelligible.
# No language is difficult for those who speak it. Difficulty appears when two conditions are met: the standard language diverges from the vernacular and a speaker of the vernacular tries to learn the standard version. This divergence is the precise reason why spelling and grammar reforms happen every now and then.
# People with less education can speak the vernacular or often several varieties of the vernacular, and they speak it well. They might, however, have trouble in speaking Standard Portuguese, but this is due to lack of experience rather than to any inherent deficiency in their linguistic mastery.
# The people of Maranhão are not generally better than fellow Brazilians from other states in speaking Standard Portuguese, especially because that state is one of the poorest and has one of the lowest literacy rates.
# It is the written language that must reflect the spoken and not vice versa: it is not the tail that wags the dog.
# The knowledge of grammar is intuitive for those who speak their native languages. Problems arise when they begin to study the grammar of a foreign language.
# Rich and influential people themselves often do not follow the grammatical rules of Standard Portuguese. Standard Portuguese is mostly a jewel or shibboleth for powerless middle-class careers (journalists, teachers, writers, actors, etc.).

Whether Bagno&#x27;s points are valid or not is open to debate, especially the solutions he recommends for the problems he claims to have identified. Whereas some agree that he has captured the feelings of the Brazilians towards Brazil&#x27;s linguistic situation well, his book (&quot;Linguistic Prejudice: What it Is, How it is done&quot;) has been heavily criticized by some linguists and grammarians, due to his unorthodox claims, sometimes asserted to be biased or unproven.

==Impact==

The cultural influence of Brazilian Portuguese in the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world has greatly increased in the last decades of the 20th century, due to the popularity of Brazilian music and Brazilian soap operas. Since Brazil joined Mercosul, the South American free trade zone, Portuguese has been increasingly studied as a foreign language in Spanish-speaking partner countries.

Many words of Brazilian origin (also used in other Portuguese-speaking countries) have also entered into English: samba, bossa nova, cruzeiro, milreis and capoeira. While originally Angolan, the word &quot;samba&quot; only became famous worldwide because of its popularity in Brazil.

After independence in 1822, Brazilian idioms with African and Amerindian influences were brought to Portugal by returning Portuguese Brazilians (&quot;luso-brasileiros&quot; in Portuguese).

==Language codes==

codice_1 is a language code for &quot;Portuguese&quot;, defined by ISO standards (see ISO 639-1 and ISO 3166-1 alpha-2).

There is no ISO code for spoken or written Brazilian Portuguese.

codice_2 is a language code for the &quot;Brazilian Sign Language&quot;, defined by ISO standards (see ISO 639-3).

codice_3 is a language code for the &quot;Brazilian Portuguese&quot;, defined by Internet standards (see IETF language tag).

<text>Garçon à la Pipe (English: Boy with a Pipe) is an oil on canvas painting by Pablo Picasso. It was painted in 1905 when Picasso was 24 years old, during his Rose Period, soon after he settled in the Montmartre area of Paris. The painting depicts a Parisian adolescent boy who holds a pipe in his left hand and wears a garland of flowers on his head, surrounded by two floral decorations. The subject was a local boy named &quot;P’tit Louis&quot; who died at a young age. The painting is listed as one of the most expensive paintings, after being sold at Sotheby&#x27;s auction for $104 million on 5 May 2004. It is currently the fifth highest selling painting by Picasso.

== Background ==
In 1905, Picasso was still a struggling artist and had settled in Montmartre in Paris. He was living in poverty in a dilapidated artist building at 13 rue Ravignan known as Le Bateau-Lavoir. Picasso had made the transition from his earlier pessimistic Blue Period and was now in a new, more optimistic phase known as his Rose Period. 

== Description ==
&quot;Garçon à la Pipe&quot; depicts a teenage boy who is in a seated position surrounded by two bouquets of flowers. He is dressed in blue overalls and wears a garland of roses on his head. He holds a pipe in his left hand the wrong way round. André Salmon, a friend of Picasso, described in 1912 how Picasso had created the painting, &quot;after a delightful series of metaphysical acrobats, dancers like priestesses of Diana, delightful clowns and wistful Harlequins&quot;. In place of this, Picasso was now focusing on a simple image of a young Parisian boy, dressed in blue denim.

The boy depicted in this painting was known as &quot;P’tit Louis&quot;, or &quot;Little Louis&quot;. He was described by Picasso as, &quot;one of the “local types, actors, ladies, gentlemen, delinquents” who frequented the studios in the Bateau-Lavoir. The harsh life of a street boy resulted in the subject dying at a young age.

Preliminary studies for this painting show the boy in a variety of different poses, including standing, sitting, leaning against a wall, lighting a pipe or holding it in his hands. Picasso eventually chose to depict his model in the seated position shown in the finished painting, which he painstakingly worked on in a preparatory study. The studies differ from the final painting by changing the subject from a young boy to a more mature adolescent. The final effect is a depiction of a mysterious figure surrounded by masses of flowers that is reminiscent of Odilon Redon&#x27;s work.

André Salmon described how Picasso had transformed what was originally a study from life to the current artwork in a sudden flash of inspiration. One night, Picasso abandoned the company of his friends and their intellectual chit-chat. He returned to his studio, took the canvas he had abandoned a month before and crowned the figure of the little apprentice lad with roses. He had made this work a masterpiece thanks to a sublime whim.Picasso&#x27;s rendering of &quot;P&#x27;tit Louis&quot; has elements of classical art. He was particularly inspired by the work of the French Neoclassical painter Ingres. Like Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Young Girl with a Flower Basket&quot;, which was painted in the same year, &quot;Garçon à la Pipe&quot; conveys conflicting imagery of innocence and experience. Picasso described the boy as an &quot;evil angel&quot;. In this painting, the boy wears a garland of roses on his head to symbolise the blood of the Eucharist, a reference to the transition from youth to maturity. Picasso also depicts the contrast between the harsh street life that Louis endured and the innocence of his youth.

The peculiar position of the pipe in the boy&#x27;s hand has been the subject of interpretation. As the pipe was commonly used as a symbol of intellectual reflection in nineteenth- and twentieth-century painting, the pipe&#x27;s position gains particular significance. The pipe appears as though being held from outside the painting, rather than from inside, thus suggesting a fusion of realities, where the boy is a reflection of Picasso himself.

John Richardson suggested that the painting could have been inspired by a poem entitled &quot;A Crime of Love&quot; by Paul Verlaine. One of the most poetic Rose period images is the &quot;Boy with a Pipe&quot;. It conjures up Verlaine’s poem ‘Crimen Amoris,’ about a palace in Ecbatana where ‘adolescent satans’ neglect the five senses for the seven deadly sins, except for the most handsome of all these evil angels, who is sixteen years old under his wreath of flowers… and who dreams away, his eyes full of fire and tears.

==Claim for restitution and provenance==
Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy probably acquired the painting c.1910. Shortly before his death in 1935, he wrote a will bequeathing it to his non-Jewish wife, Countess Else Mendelssohn-Bartholdy Kesselstett (née Lavergne-Paguilhen) who sold it to Walter Feilchenfeldt in 1949. Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney then acquired the painting on 13 January 1950 for $30,000.

In 2004, Professor Julius H Schoeps challenged the 1949 sale of &quot;Boy with a Pipe&quot; due to circumstances related to the Nazi persecution of the Jewish owner and his attempts to shield the painting from seizure via his non-Jewish wife.

On 5 May 2004 the painting was sold for $104,168,000 at Sotheby&#x27;s auction in New York City. Sotheby’s did not name the buyer though sources say that it was Guido Barilla, co-owner of the Barilla Group. At the time, it broke the record for the amount paid for an auctioned painting (when inflation is ignored). The amount, $104 million, includes the auction price of $93 million plus the auction house’s commission of about $11 million. The painting was given a pre-sale estimate of $70 million by the auction house.

== Significance and legacy ==
In 2004, Charles Moffet, co-director of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby&#x27;s remarked on the painting&#x27;s significance as a masterpiece.It has a haunting ambiguity that has ensured its status as one of Picasso&#x27;s most celebrated images of adolescent beauty. It is, without question, one of the most beautiful of the artist&#x27;s Rose Period paintings and one of the most important early works by Pablo Picasso.

== Reception ==
&quot;Garçon à la Pipe&quot; has been described as a masterpiece, yet its sale at auction in 2004 for the price of $104 million caused some controversy amongst art critics. Picasso expert Pepe Karmel described the work as a &quot;minor painting&quot; and considered that its high sale price showed, &quot;how much the marketplace is divorced from the true values of art&quot;. Blake Gopnik for &quot;The Washington Times&quot; opined that, &quot;Though the word &quot;masterpiece&quot; was much bandied about in the buildup to the auction, it&#x27;s unlikely there&#x27;s a single art historian who would rate this Rose Period picture.&quot;

In contrast, &quot;The New York Sun&quot; remarked that, &quot;&#x27;Boy with a Pipe&#x27; is a thrilling painting whose beauty would take a lifetime to exhaust&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Calvin Harris&#x27; 2017 song &quot;Slide&quot; contains the lyrics &quot;I might empty my bank account and buy that boy with a pipe&quot;. Vocalist Frank Ocean explained that it is an allusion to, “a Picasso painting that sold for so much money&quot;.

<text>Diane Eve Warren (born September 7, 1956) is an American songwriter. She has won an Academy Honorary Award, Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, two Golden Globe Awards and three consecutive &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards for Songwriter of the Year from 1997 to 1999. She first gained recognition for her work on DeBarge&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot;. By the late 1980s, she joined the record label EMI, where she became the first songwriter in the history of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine to have written seven hit songs, each recorded by different artists, prompting EMI&#x27;s UK Chairman Peter Reichardt to call her &quot;the most important songwriter in the world&quot;. 

Warren has written nine number-one songs and 33 top-10 songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 including &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; (Cher, 1989), &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; (Celine Dion, 1996), &quot;How Do I Live&quot; (LeAnn Rimes, 1997) and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot; (Aerosmith, 1998). Two of the top 13 hits in the Hot 100&#x27;s 57-year history were composed by Warren. She has been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She has been rated the third most successful female artist in the UK, leading her to win the Ivor Novello Award and Special International Award in 2008. Warren has received 16 competitive Academy Award nominations without a win; she received an honorary Oscar at the Governors Awards in November 2022.

She founded the publishing company Realsongs, through which she holds the masters of her work. Her debut studio album was released on August 27, 2021.

==Early life==
Warren, the youngest of three daughters, was born to David, an insurance salesman, and Flora Warren, in the Los Angeles community of Van Nuys, where she said she felt misunderstood and &quot;alienated&quot; as a child growing up. Her family&#x27;s surname &quot;Warren&quot; was originally &quot;Wolfberg&quot;, but her father changed the name because he wanted it to sound less Jewish. Warren says she was rebellious as a child and told NPR&#x27;s Scott Simon that she got into trouble and ran away as a teen but returned because she missed her cat.

As a child, Warren loved listening to and dreamed of performing on the radio herself. She was also influenced by music her parents and her sisters would play. She began writing music when she was 11 but took a more serious approach at 14, commenting &quot;music saved me.&quot; Warren has said that her mother asked her to give up her dream of a songwriting career and take a secretarial job. However, her father continued to believe in her and encouraged her. In addition, he bought her a 12-string guitar and a metal shed for her to practice and took her to music auditions. She wrote Celine Dion&#x27;s 1996 song &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; as a tribute to her father for his encouragement.

She attended Los Angeles Pierce College and graduated from California State University, Northridge in 1978, but largely considered her education a waste as she focused most of her time on improving her songwriting skills instead of on her education.

On the February 12, 2016, edition of &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, Warren said that she had been molested at age 12 and had later experienced sexual harassment and assault by a sound engineer during her working career.

==Career==
Warren&#x27;s first hit was &quot;Solitaire&quot;, which Laura Branigan took to No. 7 in the US pop charts in 1983.

The original name for her publishing company, Realsongs, was &quot;Warren Piece&quot; because &quot;War and Peace&quot; was already taken. In 1998, Realsongs and its international partner, EMI Music Publishing, distributed &quot;A Passion For Music&quot;, a six-CD box set showcasing her music. EMI Music&#x27;s London office assisted in distributing 1,200 copies of the box set primarily to the film and television industry for consideration in soundtracks and other commercial endeavors. It was not marketed to consumers. , Warren&#x27;s music has appeared in the soundtracks of over sixty films. She was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2001.

The Diane Warren Foundation, in conjunction with the ASCAP Foundation and the VH1 Save the Music Foundation created a joint initiative, beginning in 2000, called Music in the Schools. The initiative provides sheet music, band arrangements, folios, and method books to each of the schools that are already recipients of musical instruments from the VH1 Save the Music Foundation.

In 2004, Warren released a compilation album of love songs titled &quot;Diane Warren Presents Love Songs&quot;, which includes several of her hits.

Warren continues to write hit songs for and with artists of all mainstream genres, including Bette Midler, Stevie B., Celine Dion, Cheap Trick, En Vogue, Whitney Houston, Belinda Carlisle, Taylor Dayne, Britney Spears, Marcia Hines, Alice Cooper, Christina Aguilera, Beyoncé, TLC, Aaliyah, Heart, Agnetha Fältskog, Elton John, Cher, Tina Turner, Bryan Adams, Selena, Jessica Simpson, Air Supply, Olivia Newton-John, Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack, Roy Orbison, Trisha Yearwood, Patti LaBelle, Michael Bolton, NSYNC, Rene Froger, Gloria Estefan, Reba McEntire, Enrique Iglesias, Paloma Faith, Russell Watson, Rod Stewart, RBD, Aerosmith, The Cult, Kiss, Ricky Martin, Monica, Faith Hill, Michael W. Smith, Meat Loaf, Sugababes, Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton, Exposé, Leigh Nash of Sixpence None the Richer, LeAnn Rimes, Gavin DeGraw, Kierra Sheard, Mandy Moore, Hilary Duff, Haylie Duff, Lindsay Lohan, Lady Gaga, Chrissy Metz, Claire Richards, Starship, and Westlife, producing some of the songs as well. Her songs have been covered by artists including Joe Cocker, Weezer, Edwin McCain, Milli Vanilli, Mark Chesnutt, and Sara Evans.

Warren wrote three songs for Carrie Underwood&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Some Hearts&quot; (2005) that were &quot;Lessons Learned&quot;, &quot;Whenever You Remember&quot; and the title track, originally written for Marshall Crenshaw.

In 2009, Warren co-wrote the United Kingdom&#x27;s entry in the Eurovision Song Contest with Andrew Lloyd Webber. The song &quot;It&#x27;s My Time&quot; was sung by Jade Ewen and achieved 5th place, the best for the UK since 2002.

In 2010, Warren partnered with Avon Products as a celebrity judge for Avon Voices, Avon&#x27;s global online singing talent search for women and songwriting competition for men and women. For the contest, Warren wrote a special anthem which was recorded by the finalists and produced by Humberto Gatica.
Warren has been recognized six times as ASCAP Songwriter of the Year and four times as Billboard&#x27;s Songwriter of the Year.

In 2012, Warren wrote the song &quot;Counterfeit&quot; for Tulisa&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;The Female Boss&quot;.

Warren wrote Paloma Faith&#x27;s 2014 song &quot;Only Love Can Hurt Like This&quot;.

Warren&#x27;s success in the US has been paralleled in the UK, where she has been rated the third most successful female artist. Peter Reichardt, former chairman of EMI Music Publishing UK, credited her as &quot;the most important songwriter in the world.&quot;

Warren is the first songwriter in the history of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine to have seven hits, all by different artists, on the singles chart at the same time. Warren has had nine of her compositions hit No. 1 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, all by different artists, and overall 33 of her songs have hit the US top ten. Additionally, two of the top 13 hits in the Hot 100&#x27;s 57-year history were written by her - &quot;How Do I Live&quot; (number four) and &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot; (number 13). She has had even more success on the US Adult Contemporary charts, where sixteen of her songs have gone to No. 1, and overall more than 40 songs have hit the top ten on that chart. Warren has had three No. 1 hits in the UK and more than 20 top ten hits. She has been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Warren&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Diane Warren: The Cave Sessions Vol. 1&quot;, was released on August 27, 2021, via Di-Namic Records and BMG. Its first single, &quot;Times like This&quot; with Darius Rucker, was released on November 10, 2020. The second single, &quot;She&#x27;s Fire&quot; with G-Eazy and Carlos Santana, was released on July 13, 2021. The single &quot;Seaside&quot; with Rita Ora, Sofía Reyes, and Reik was released on the same day as the album.

In October 2023, &quot;Say Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, a song Warren wrote with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift in 2013, was released as part of Swift&#x27;s album &quot;1989 (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot;. Debuting at #5, the song marked the first time a song written by Warren hit the top ten of the US Hot 100 in 22 years.

The soundtrack single &quot;Gonna Be You&quot; from the movie &quot;80 for Brady&quot; was released January 20, 2023. The song was written by her and performed by Dolly Parton, Belinda Carlisle, Cyndi Lauper, Debbie Harry and Gloria Estefan. The official music video shows Parton, Carlisle, Lauper, and Estefan performing while wearing football jerseys similar to the ones worn by the women in the film, interspersed with clips from the film.

==Personal life==
Warren has never married, and does not think of herself as a person of commitment. In interviews, she has said that she believes that her lack of a romantic life makes her more peculiar as a songwriter. She was in a relationship with songwriter and record producer Guy Roche&lt;ref name=&quot;flickr/louisepalanker/41066543351&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that ended in 1992 and claims she has not had another relationship since, commenting &quot;I&#x27;ve never been in love like in my songs. I&#x27;m not like normal people. I&#x27;m no good at relationships. I draw drama to me—it&#x27;s the Jew in me&quot;. Warren considers herself to be cynical regarding romance, but she does not let this affect her songwriting and prefers to write alone rather than co-writing, commenting &quot;When I write with other people, the experience is different. You have to compromise, which I have problems with. I&#x27;d rather listen to my own mind&quot;.

In a 2000 interview, Warren explained that she never let go of music despite experiencing rejections, depression and poverty. In 1994, Warren&#x27;s house was damaged by the Northridge earthquake, causing her to be miserable and homeless, drifting from hotels to rental houses. She lost another home in 2025 when it burned down during the Southern California wildfires. She has said that therapy helped her with songwriting. She has also revealed that she works 12–16 hours a day, always takes her keyboard whenever she travels and is &quot;...more crazy and intense than I was at 20...&quot;

Warren does not usually allow anyone into her Hollywood Hills office, which she describes as a &quot;cluttered, airless room&quot;. In 2012, Warren said that nothing in her office had been cleaned or moved for 17 years because she is superstitious; she prefers to think of that room as her &quot;secret world&quot;. In that room, Warren records melodies with a tape recorder on which she plays them again and chooses the songs she likes the most. Warren did allow part of a 2016 interview with &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; correspondent Ben Tracy to be taped in the office.

Warren is autistic and believes being neurodivergent has made her a better songwriter.

==Legacy==
A jukebox musical is planned to be written by Joe DiPietro and directed by Kathleen Marshall, titled &quot;Obsessed, The Story of Diane Warren...so far&quot;. Warren has composed nine No. 1 and 33 top-10 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in a career spanning 40 years.

<doc id="639347" wikidata="Q7137461" url="?curid=639347" title="Parisian (department store)">
<text>Parisian Inc. (, ) was an American chain of upmarket department stores founded and headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Competing mainly through the 1980s against Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and Gus Mayer, Parisian underwent a series of restructurings and mergers during its 130-year history, and was taken over by Proffitt’s, Inc. in 1996. In September 2006, Belk purchased Parisian from Saks for $285 million with twenty-four locations later becoming Belk by September 2007. Belk sold four stores in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio to The Bon-Ton in October 2006. Bon-Ton operated these stores individually under the Parisian name until 2013 when the exclusive marketing rights to operate under the Parisian name expired, marking the end of this upmarket department store brand.

==History==

===Early history===
Parisian was founded in Birmingham, Alabama in 1877 by Estella and Bertha Sommers. The sisters sold it to Carl Hess and William Holiner in the 1920s. Hess&#x27;s son Emil and Holiner&#x27;s son-in-law, Leonard Salit, bought the chain in 1950 and established its first credit program. After Salit died, Hess&#x27;s family took over the chain.

Parisian opened stores in several shopping malls throughout Birmingham in the 1970s, including Eastwood Mall (now Eastwood Village). In the 1960s, it began opening stores outside Birmingham, first with a store in Gateway Shopping Center in Decatur, Alabama and then Parkway City Mall in Huntsville, University Mall in Tuscaloosa, Bel Air Mall in Mobile, and Eastdale Mall and Montgomery Mall in Montgomery. By the mid-1980s, Parisian had 13 stores in Alabama. Its first two stores outside the state were both in Florida at Cordova Mall in Pensacola and Sarasota Square Mall (now Westfield Sarasota Square) in Sarasota. Australian-based real estate firm LJ Hooker bought Parisian, Bonwit Teller, and B. Altman in 1988, but sold its share in Parisian back to the Hess family a year later after filing for bankruptcy. By the early 1990s, Parisian had opened its first stores outside the Southeastern United States in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. In the mid 1990s, two new stores opened in Florida at Seminole Towne Center and The Avenues.

===Acquisition by Proffitt&#x27;s in 1996===
In 1996, Proffitt&#x27;s Inc. bought 38-store Parisian for $200 million and assumed Parisian&#x27;s $250 million debt. Proffitt&#x27;s, which had acquired Younkers and McRae&#x27;s two years before, also acquired G.R. Herberger&#x27;s in 1996. In 1997, Proffitt&#x27;s included five brands: 19 Proffitt&#x27;s stores, mostly in Tennessee; 29 McRae&#x27;s stores in Alabama and Mississippi; 48 Younkers stores, mostly in Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan; 40 Parisian stores; and 39 Herberger&#x27;s stores, concentrated in the Midwest.

Proffitt&#x27;s continued to make acquisitions, buying the Carson Pirie Scott chain of 52 stores in the Midwest in 1997 and Brody&#x27;s in North Carolina in 1998. Proffitt&#x27;s bought Saks Fifth Avenue for $2.1 billion in 1998, which included 100 Saks stores and 40 discount Off 5th outlet stores, and changed its own name from Proffitt&#x27;s, Inc. to Saks Incorporated.

At its height, Saks Incorporated operated more than 250 medium to high-end department stores under its Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises group, the Parisian division, the Northern Department Store Group (Younkers, Herberger&#x27;s, Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner&#x27;s, Boston Store), and its Southern Department Store Group (Proffitt&#x27;s and McRae&#x27;s) — plus more than 50 Club Libby Lu specialty shops.

===Sale of Parisian to Belk in 2006===
Belk, Inc., a privately held department store chain based in Charlotte, North Carolina purchased the Proffitt&#x27;s and McRae&#x27;s stores from Saks on March 8, 2006, and immediately converted them to Belk. On August 2, 2006, Belk announced the $285 million purchase of Parisian from Saks with Belk later announcing plans for twenty-four Parisian locations to become Belk by September 12, 2007. With the Parisian transaction complete, Belk operates 315 stores in 19 states.
That transaction included 38 Parisian department stores, a administrative/headquarters facility in Birmingham, Alabama, and a distribution center in Steele, Alabama.

===Bon-Ton agreement===
On October 25, 2006 Belk announced the $22 million ($ in ) sale of four Parisian locations and the rights for the construction of a fifth store to The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. Under the agreement, Bon-Ton was allowed to operate the four locations under the Parisian nameplate for an agreed amount of time. Despite the agreement, Parisian ceased to exist in 2006, and the remaining stores operated as Bon-Ton Stores using the Parisian. The stores were located in:

* Livonia, Michigan – Laurel Park Place – .
* Rochester Hills, Michigan – The Village of Rochester Hills – .
* Beavercreek, Ohio – The Mall at Fairfield Commons – . – became an Elder-Beerman. The store was consolidated to a separate store at the mall by Elder-Beerman in 2014, and the structure will be torn down in 2015 to make room for new restaurant construction.
* Indianapolis, Indiana – Circle Centre – . – former site of the L. S. Ayres flagship store – Became Carson Pirie Scott. Store closed in Spring 2018.
* Clinton Township, Michigan – The Mall at Partridge Creek – . (opened October 18, 2007; first Parisian opened under Bon-Ton)

By 2012, stores located in Laurel Park Place in Livonia, The Mall at Partridge Creek in Clinton Township, and The Village of Rochester Hills in Rochester Hills, continued to operate under the Parisian name. In January 2013, Bon-Ton&#x27;s exclusive rights to operate the stores as Parisian expired, marking the end of this upscale department store brand.

<doc id="639353" wikidata="Q6988888" url="?curid=639353" title="Neil M. Gunn">
<text>Neil Miller Gunn (8 November 1891 – 15 January 1973) was a prolific Scottish novelist, critic, and dramatist who emerged as one of the leading lights of the Scottish Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s. With over twenty novels to his credit, Gunn was arguably the most influential Scottish fiction writer of the first half of the 20th century (with the possible exception of Lewis Grassic Gibbon, the pen name of James Leslie Mitchell).

Like his contemporary, Hugh MacDiarmid, Gunn was politically committed to the ideals of both Scottish nationalism and socialism (a difficult balance to maintain for a writer of his time). His fiction deals primarily with the Highland communities and landscapes of his youth, though the author chose (&quot;contra&quot; MacDiarmid and his followers) to write almost exclusively in English rather than Scots or Gaelic but was heavily influenced in his writing style by the language.

==Early life==

Neil Miller Gunn was born in the village of Dunbeath, Caithness. His father was the captain of a herring boat, and Gunn&#x27;s fascination with the sea and the courage of fishermen can be traced directly back to his childhood memories of his father&#x27;s work. His mother would also provide Gunn with a crucial model for the types of steadfast, earthy, and tradition-bearing women that would populate many of his works.

Gunn had eight siblings, and when his primary schooling was completed in 1904, he moved south to live with his older sister Mary and her husband Dr. Keiller, the local GP at Kenbank in St John&#x27;s Town of Dalry, Kirkcudbrightshire. He continued his education there with tutors including the local schoolmaster, and the writer and poet J.G.Carter &quot;Theodore Mayne&quot;. He sat the Civil Service exam in 1907. This led to a move to London, where the adolescent Gunn was exposed to both the exciting world of new political and philosophical ideas as well as to the seamier side of modern urban life. In 1910 Gunn became a Customs and Excise Officer and was posted back to the Highlands. He would remain a customs officer throughout the First World War and until he was well established as a writer in 1937.

==Marriage==
Gunn married Jessie Dallas Frew in 1921 and they settled in Inverness, near his permanent excise post at the Glen Mhor distillery.

==Beginnings as a writer==

During the 1920s Gunn began to publish short stories, as well as poems and short essays, in various literary magazines. He also wrote a number of plays. His &quot;The Ancient Fire&quot; was staged at the Lyric Theatre in Glasgow in 1929. His writing brought him into contact with other writers associated with the budding Scottish Renaissance, such as Hugh MacDiarmid, James Bridie, Naomi Mitchison, Eric Linklater, Edwin Muir, Lewis Grassic Gibbon, and George Blake.

Blake and George Malcolm Thomson were running the Porpoise Press, whose mission was to reestablish a national publishing industry for Scotland, by now an imprint of Faber &amp; Faber, and they became Gunn&#x27;s publisher in the early 1930s. The first novels Gunn published were &quot;The Grey Coast&quot; in 1926 and &quot;The Lost Glen&quot; in 1928. During this period, Gunn was active in the National Party of Scotland, which formed part of what became the Scottish National Party.

==The professional writer==

Following the publishing success of &quot;Highland River&quot; (for which he was awarded the 1937 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction), Gunn was able to resign from the Customs and Excise in 1937 and become a full-time writer. He rented a farmhouse near Strathpeffer and embarked on his most productive period as a novelist and essayist. &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Broom&quot; and &quot;The Silver Darlings&quot; are historical novels dealing with the Highland Clearances. &quot;Young Art and Old Hector&quot; and &quot;The Green Isle of the Great Deep&quot; are both fantasies based on Scottish folklore. Gunn&#x27;s later works in the 1940s and into the 1950s became concerned with issues of totalitarianism.

==The Highland Zen master==
Gunn&#x27;s final full-length work was a discursive autobiography entitled &quot;The Atom of Delight&quot;. This text showed the influence which a reading of Eugen Herrigel&#x27;s &quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&quot; had upon Gunn. His utilisation of these ideas was not so much mystical as providing a view of the individual in a &quot;small self-contained community, with a long-established way of life, with actions and responses known and defined&quot;. He took the playing of fiddle reels as an example: &quot;how a human hand could perform, on its own, truly astonishing feats – astonishing in the sense that if thought interfered for a moment the feat was destroyed&quot;. This thought-free state could be a source of delight.Zen in the art of Neil Gunn

In his later years, Gunn was involved in broadcasting and also published in diverse journals such as &quot;Anarchy Magazine&quot; in London, &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot; (USA), &quot;Saltire Review&quot;, &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Scots Review&quot;, and &quot;Point&quot; magazine in Leicester.

In his later years Gunn lived on the Black Isle. He died in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness on 15 January 1973, aged 81.

==Legacy==
Gunn is commemorated in Makars&#x27; Court, outside the Writers&#x27; Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. Selections for Makars&#x27; Court are made by the Writers&#x27; Museum; the Saltire Society; the Scottish Poetry Library. The Neil Gunn Trust was established in 1986, and in October 1987 a monument to the writer was unveiled on the Heights of Brae, Strathpeffer.

The Neil Gunn Writing Competition was established in 1988 by Ross &amp; Cromarty District Council (later becoming the Highland Council) and the Trust. The competition is now organised by High Life Highland and the Trust.

<doc id="639356" wikidata="Q326234" url="?curid=639356" title="Rube Waddell">
<text>George Edward &quot;Rube&quot; Waddell (October 13, 1876 – April 1, 1914) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). A left-hander, he played for 13 years, with the Louisville Colonels, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Chicago Orphans in the National League, as well as the Philadelphia Athletics and St. Louis Browns in the American League. Born in Bradford, Pennsylvania, and raised in Prospect, Pennsylvania, Waddell was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946.

Waddell is best remembered for his highly eccentric behavior, and for being a remarkably dominant strikeout pitcher in an era when batters were expert at making contact. He had an excellent fastball, a sharp-breaking curveball, a screwball, and superb control; his strikeout-to-walk ratio was almost 3-to-1, and he led the major leagues in strikeouts for six consecutive years.

==Early life==
Waddell was born on October 13, 1876, just outside Bradford, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Prospect, Pennsylvania. Biographer Alan Levy wrote that Waddell was &quot;a decidedly different sort of child&quot;. At the age of three, he wandered over to a local fire station and stayed there for several days. He did not attend school very often. He was left-handed and strengthened his arm as a child by throwing rocks at birds he encountered while working on his family&#x27;s land. He also worked on mining and drilling sites as a youngster, which helped his conditioning.

==Early baseball career==
Waddell&#x27;s career wound through a number of teams. He was notably unpredictable; early in his career, he once left in the middle of a game to go fishing. He also had a longstanding fascination with fire trucks and ran off the field to chase after them during games on multiple occasions. He would disappear for months at a time during the offseason, and it was not known where he went until it was discovered that he was wrestling alligators in a circus. He was easily distracted by opposing fans who held up puppies, which caused him to run over to play with them, and shiny objects, which seemed to put him in a trance. An alcoholic for much of his short life, he reportedly spent his entire first signing bonus on a drinking binge; as a pun of the baseball term &quot;southpaw&quot; denoting a left-handed pitcher, the &quot;Sporting News&quot; dubbed him a &quot;sousepaw&quot;. His eccentric behavior led to constant battles with his managers and scuffles with bad-tempered teammates.

Waddell&#x27;s first professional contract was for $500 with Louisville, where he pitched two league games and a couple of exhibitions with the team at the end of the 1897 season. When the season ended, he was loaned to the Detroit Tigers of the Western League to gain professional experience. After defaulting on rent and being fined by owner George Vanderbeck, he left Detroit in late May to pitch in Canada before eventually returning to Homestead, Pennsylvania, to pitch semi-pro baseball there. However, Louisville retained his rights and he was lent to Columbus of the Western League in 1899, continued with them when the franchise moved to Grand Rapids mid-season, and finished with a record of 26–8. He rejoined Louisville in the final month of the 1899 season and won seven of nine decisions. When the National League (NL) contracted to eight teams for the 1900 season, Louisville ownership bought the Pittsburgh franchise and the Louisville franchise was terminated. Louisville&#x27;s top players, including Waddell, Honus Wagner, and Fred Clarke, were transferred to Pittsburgh.

Waddell debuted with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1900, leading the National League in ERA. However, his erratic behavior led manager Fred Clarke to suspend him. After he pitched in semi-pro ball in small towns such as Punxsutawney, Milwaukee Brewers manager Connie Mack learned of his availability. With Pittsburgh&#x27;s approval, Mack convinced Waddell to pitch for Milwaukee for several weeks in the summer of 1900. Milwaukee was in the newly named American League (AL), formerly known as the Western League, which was not yet directly competing with the NL. On August 19, Waddell pitched the first game of a doubleheader for Milwaukee, winning in the 17th inning on his own triple. Mack offered Waddell a three-day fishing vacation if he agreed to pitch the second game. After Waddell threw a complete-game shutout for the victory, he headed to Pewaukee Lake to go fishing. Pittsburgh&#x27;s management quickly recognized Waddell&#x27;s talent and asked for his return.

==Dominant seasons==
Waddell had worn out his welcome in Pittsburgh by 1901, and his contract was sold to the Chicago Cubs, then managed by Tom Loftus. Despite his previous successes managing Waddell in Columbus/Grand Rapids, Loftus was not given the latitude to cope with Waddell&#x27;s problems as the Cubs manager. When problems led to his suspension, Waddell left the Cubs to pitch for semi-pro teams in northern Illinois, as well as Racine and Kenosha, Wisconsin. Frank Chance and Joe Cantillon then invited Waddell to join a barnstorming team that traveled to California, where he was persuaded to stay and joined the Los Angeles Loo Loos in a league that a year later would become the Pacific Coast League.

Connie Mack, then in Philadelphia, was desperate for pitching; when he learned that Waddell was pitching in California, he dispatched two Pinkerton agents to sneak Waddell back to Philadelphia, where he led the Philadelphia Athletics to the 1902 American League crown. Much later, Mack described Waddell as &quot;the atom bomb of baseball long before the atom bomb was discovered&quot;. On July 1, 1902, Waddell became the second major-league pitcher to throw an immaculate inning, striking out all three batters on nine total pitches in the third inning of a 2–0 win over the Baltimore Orioles (the present-day New York Yankees).

Shortly after the 1902 baseball season, reports indicated Waddell would play for Connie Mack&#x27;s Athletics football team. However, he never played for the football Athletics. Mack later said, &quot;There was a little fellow from Wanamaker&#x27;s who asked for the job of quarterback. I don&#x27;t think he weighed more than 140 [lbs]. Well, the first practice Waddell tackled him and broke his leg. It was the first inkling John [Shibe] and I had that players could be badly hurt in football. We got Rube out of there without delay. He was supposed to be pretty good, but we never found out.&quot; Waddell returned to his family&#x27;s home in Pennsylvania and played with local football clubs there. He played with various football teams in his later years and had a brief stint as a goalkeeper in the St. Louis Soccer League.

In his prime, Waddell was the game&#x27;s premier power pitcher, with 302 strikeouts in 1903, 115 more than runner-up Bill Donovan. According to baseball historian Lee Allen in &quot;The American League Story&quot;, Waddell began the 1903 season &quot;sleeping in a firehouse at Camden, New Jersey, and ended it tending bar in a saloon in Wheeling, West Virginia. In between those events, he won 22 games for the Philadelphia Athletics; [...] toured the nation in a melodrama called &quot;The Stain of Guilt&quot;; courted, married, and became separated from May Wynne Skinner of Lynn, Massachusetts; saved a woman from drowning; accidentally shot a friend through the hand; and was bitten by a lion.&quot; His performance in &quot;The Stain of Guilt&quot; was notable in that his co-stars, who had realized that he was incapable of memorizing his lines, allowed him to improvise his lines for every show; the play was critically acclaimed and was much discussed for a scene in which Waddell lifted the actor playing the villain and threw him across the stage with ease. Waddell used his newfound stardom as an actor to negotiate a higher wage for his baseball career.

In Eliot Asinof&#x27;s 1963 account of the 1919 World Series fix &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; (later made into a film of the same name), mention is made of Waddell being bribed not to pitch in the 1905 World Series against the New York Giants. Further discussion of the 1905 World Series has taken place at SABR. Waddell followed that season with 349 strikeouts in 1904, 110 more than runner-up Jack Chesbro. No other pitcher compiled consecutive 300-strikeout seasons until Sandy Koufax in 1965 and 1966. Waddell was the opposing pitcher for Cy Young&#x27;s perfect game on May 5, 1904, and hit a flyball for the final out. Waddell&#x27;s 349 strikeouts represented the modern-era season record for more than 60 years, and remains sixth on the modern list. In 1946, it was initially believed that Bob Feller&#x27;s 348 strikeouts had broken Waddell&#x27;s single-season mark, but research into his 1904 season box scores revealed uncounted strikeouts that lifted him back above Feller. Waddell still holds the AL single-season strikeout record by a left-handed pitcher.

In 1905, Waddell won a Triple Crown for pitching. He finished with a 27–10 win–loss record, 287 strikeouts, and a 1.48 earned run average (ERA). It was Waddell&#x27;s fourth consecutive season to finish with 20 or more wins. Around this time, he was sharing a room with teammate Ossee Schreckengost, as was customary during the era; Schreckengost later refused to share the room until a contract clause was created which would bar Waddell from eating crackers in bed. Waddell also gained more fame for saving the lives of people inside a department store when he picked up a burning oil stove that had overturned and carried it out of the building before it could start a fire.

==Later career==
Waddell&#x27;s drinking problem was exacerbated by a tumultuous marriage to May Wynne Skinner, his second of three wives, and a series of injuries in 1905 and 1906. Skinner threatened to prosecute Rube for bigamy because she did not recognize the divorce granted Rube in St. Louis. But the divorce, granted by the circuit court on February 9, 1910, was legal, so the former Mrs. Waddell had no case.

On April 8, 1908, &quot;The Scranton Republican Newspaper&quot; published an interview with Waddell entitled &quot;Unkissed Girl Sought by Rube Waddell&quot;. This article provided yet another example of Waddell&#x27;s progressing instability. Waddell&#x27;s intent was to use the article as an advertisement for his desire to find himself another wife.

Ken Burns&#x27; later documentary &quot;Baseball&quot; claimed Waddell had even lost track of how many women he had married. In time, his alcohol use began to erode his relationships with his Athletics teammates. Schreckengost, a one-time friend who regularly fetched alcohol and fishing poles for Waddell, squabbled with both Waddell and Mack for being treated differently for the same offenses.

Waddell&#x27;s increasingly erratic behavior included an incident in which he got into a fistfight on a cross-country train after making fun of a teammate&#x27;s straw hat. Complaints from teammates forced Mack to send Waddell to the St. Louis Browns for $5,000 in early 1908 despite his continued success. Recent commentators such as Bill James have suggested that Waddell suffered from a developmental disability, mental retardation, autism, or attention deficit disorder (ADD). Not much was known about these mental conditions, or their diagnoses, at the time. Though eccentric and childlike, Waddell was not illiterate as some sources have claimed.

To make sure he stayed out of trouble during the off-season, Browns owner Robert Hedges hired him as a hunter over the winters of 1908 and 1909. He set the league record for strikeouts in a game with 16 in 1908. Further drinking and marital problems with his third wife, Madge Maguire, plagued Waddell; he passed out in the middle of a game against New York in 1909. These incidents led to his release in 1910. He finished the season pitching with Joe McGinnity for Newark in the Eastern League and never played another major league game. His career stats were 193–143, 2,316 strikeouts, and a 2.16 earned run average, with 50 shutouts and 261 complete games in 2961.1 innings pitched.

==Pitching style==
Waddell&#x27;s pitching repertoire usually consisted of only two pitches: one of the fastest fastballs in the league and a hard curve. However, he had command of many more pitches, including slow curves, screwballs, &quot;fadeaways&quot; and even a &quot;flutterball&quot;. Mack once said that Waddell&#x27;s curve was &quot;even better than his speed... [He] had the fastest and deepest curve I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;.

Waddell enjoyed waving his teammates off the field and then striking out the side. He actually did so only in exhibition games, since official baseball rules prohibit playing with fewer than nine men on the field in regulation play. But in a league game in Detroit, Waddell actually had his outfielders come in close and sit down on the grass to watch him strike out the side. Once the stunt almost backfired. Pitching an exhibition game in Memphis, he took the field alone with his catcher, Doc Powers, for the last three innings. With two out in the ninth, Powers dropped the third strike, allowing the batter to reach first. The next two hitters blooped pop flies that fell just behind the mound. Despite running himself ragged, Waddell subsequently struck out the last man.

==Final years==
After his major league career was over, Waddell pitched for parts of three more years in the minor leagues, including a 20-win season for the Minneapolis Millers in 1911. In addition to pitching for the Millers, he pitched for the Minneapolis Rough Riders and with the Virginia Ore Diggers of the Northern League in 1913. By that season, however, his health had declined to such an extent that he no longer resembled the muscular, long-limbed hero of the prior decade. While in spring training with the Millers, Waddell helped save the city of Hickman, Kentucky, from a devastating flood in the spring of 1912. Catching pneumonia, he lost much of the vitality that had sustained him, and a second flood in Hickman and another ensuing case of pneumonia in 1913 took the rest. That same year, while in Minneapolis, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and moved to live with his sister in San Antonio, Texas. His health never recovered, and he was placed in a sanitarium in nearby Elmendorf until he died at the age of 37 on April 1, 1914.

==Honors==

Waddell was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 by the Veterans Committee that looked to enshrine a number of players from his era and the previous century who had contributed to the growth of the game. One of Waddell&#x27;s contributions was that he was perhaps the greatest drawing card in the first decade of the century, a man whose unique talents and personality drew baseball fans around the country to ballparks.

In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. Under what they called &quot;the Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome&quot;, they argued in favor of including players of truly exceptional talent whose career was curtailed by injury (or, in Waddell&#x27;s case, substance abuse), despite not having had career statistics that would quantitatively rank them with the all-time greats. In this case, fans and peers recognized Waddell as a baseball great long before Ritter and Honig did.

<doc id="639371" wikidata="Q2464579" url="?curid=639371" title="Wrangler (University of Cambridge)">
<text>At the University of Cambridge in England, a &quot;Wrangler&quot; is a student who gains first-class honours in the Mathematical Tripos competition. The highest-scoring student is the Senior Wrangler, the second highest is the Second Wrangler, and so on. By contrast, the person who achieves the lowest exam marks while still earning a third-class honours degree (that is, while still earning an honours degree at all) is known as the wooden spoon.

==History==
Until 1909, the university made the rankings public. Since 1910, it has publicly revealed only the class of degree gained by each student. An examiner reveals the identity of the Senior Wrangler &quot;unofficially&quot; by tipping his hat when reading out the person&#x27;s name, but other rankings are communicated to each student privately. Therefore, the names of only some 20th-century Senior Wranglers (such as Crispin Nash-Williams, Christopher Budd, Frank P. Ramsey, Donald Coxeter, Kevin Buzzard, Jayant Narlikar, George Reid and Ben J. Green) have become publicly known.

Another notable was Philippa Fawcett. She was educated at Newnham College, Cambridge, which had been co-founded by her mother. In 1890, Fawcett became the first woman to obtain the top score in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams. Her score was 13 per cent higher than the second-highest score. When the women&#x27;s list was announced, Fawcett was described as &quot;above the senior wrangler&quot;, but she did not receive the title of senior wrangler, as at that time only men could receive degrees and therefore only men were eligible for the Senior Wrangler title. The results were always highly publicised, with the top scorers receiving great acclaim. Women had been allowed to take the Tripos since 1881, after Charlotte Angas Scott was unofficially ranked as eighth wrangler.

It was recorded that &quot;virtually every high wrangler (for whom records exist) participated in some form of regular physical exercise to preserve his strength and stamina.&quot;

Obtaining the position of a highly ranked Wrangler created many opportunities for the individual&#x27;s subsequent profession. Such individuals would often become Fellows initially, before moving on to other professions. Throughout the United Kingdom and the British Empire, university mathematics professors were often among the top three Wranglers.

The order of Wranglers was widely publicised and shaped the public perception of mathematics as being the most intellectually challenging of all subjects. According to Andrew Warwick, author of &quot;Masters of Theory&quot;, the term &quot;Senior Wrangler&quot; became &quot;synonymous with academic supremacy&quot;.

==Past wranglers==
Top marks in the Cambridge mathematics exam did not always guarantee the Senior Wrangler success in life; the exams were largely a test of speed in applying familiar rules, and some of the most inventive and original students of Mathematics at Cambridge did not come top of their class. Lord Kelvin was second, William Henry Bragg was third, Augustus De Morgan and G. H. Hardy were fourth, Adam Sedgwick fifth, Bertrand Russell seventh, Thomas Robert Malthus ninth, John Maynard Keynes twelfth, and some fared even worse: Klaus Roth was not even a wrangler.

Joan Clarke, who helped to break the Nazi Enigma code at Bletchley Park, was a wrangler at Cambridge and earned a double first in mathematics, although she was prevented from receiving a full degree based on the university&#x27;s policy of awarding degrees only to men. That policy was abandoned in 1948.

The present Astronomer Royal, Martin Rees, a wrangler, went on to become one of the world&#x27;s leading scientists, also holding the illustrious posts of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and President of the Royal Society, and being a member of the Order of Merit.

== Optimes ==
Students who achieve second-class and third-class mathematics degrees are known as Senior Optimes (second-class) and Junior Optimes (third-class). Cambridge did not divide its examination classification in mathematics into 2:1s and 2:2s until 1995 but now there are &quot;Senior Optimes Division 1&quot; and &quot;Senior Optimes Division 2&quot;.

== In fiction ==
*&quot;The Senior Wrangler&quot; is a member of the faculty of Unseen University in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Discworld series of novels.
* Roger Hamley, a character in Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot;, achieved the rank of Senior Wrangler.
* Vivie Warren, the headstrong heroine of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; (1893) and daughter of the play&#x27;s infamous madam, tied with the Third Wrangler, settling for that place because she recognized that &quot;it was not worth [her] while to face the grind&quot; because she did not intend an academic career for herself.
*&quot;Wrangler&quot; is a jargon term applied to codebreakers in some of John Le Carré&#x27;s spy novels, such as &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;.
* Thomas Jericho, the main character of Robert Harris&#x27;s book &quot;Enigma&quot;, was Senior Wrangler in 1938.
* In Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s &quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot;, reference is made to the fact that Christopher Tietjens left Cambridge as &quot;a mere Second Wrangler&quot;.
* In Rumer Godden&#x27;s &quot;In This House of Brede&quot;, Dame Agnes is noted to have been Eighth Wrangler before entering the abbey.
* In C S Forester&#x27;s book, &quot;The General&quot;, a member of the main character&#x27;s staff (the deputy assistant quartermaster-general, Spiller) is described as a Second Wrangler.
* In Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;The Judge&#x27;s House&quot;, the main character Malcom Malcomson is looking for a quiet place to stay whilst preparing his Mathematical Tripos examinations. Mrs Witham, the inn&#x27;s landlady, warns Malcom about the judge&#x27;s house, but the charwoman, Mrs Dempster, dispels these fears – explaining she is not afraid of &#x27;bogies&#x27; because they are only rats. Malcom replies: &quot;Mrs. Dempster, [...] you know more than a Senior Wrangler! And let me say, that, as a mark of esteem for your indubitable soundness of head and heart, I shall, when I go, give you possession of this house, and let you stay here by yourself for the last two months of my tenancy, for four weeks will serve my purpose.&quot;

<doc id="639377" wikidata="Q6619654" url="?curid=639377" title="List of fictional doctors">
<text>This is a list of fictional doctors (characters that use the appellation &quot;doctor&quot;, medical and otherwise), from literature, films, television, and other media.

Shakespeare created a doctor in his play Macbeth (c 1603) with a &quot;great many good doctors&quot; having appeared in literature by the 1890s and, in the early 1900s, the &quot;rage for novel characters&quot; included a number of &quot;lady doctors&quot;. Solomon Posen had collected a list of books with &quot;a doctors as a principal figure&quot; which he says resulted in a list of over 10,000 works as of 2005.

Early cinematic and television representations of doctors typically characterized the practice of medicine as being &quot;in safe (male) hands,&quot; with 90% of doctors on television through 1989 being male.

<doc id="639379" wikidata="Q334391" url="?curid=639379" title="Charles Abbot, 1st Baron Colchester">
<text>Charles Abbot, 1st Baron Colchester PC, FRS (14 October 1757 – 8 May 1829) was a British barrister and statesman. He served as Speaker of the House of Commons between 1802 and 1817.

==Background and education==
Abbot was born at Roysse Court, Abingdon, to Dr John Abbot, headmaster of Abingdon School and rector of All Saints, Colchester, and, by his mother&#x27;s second marriage, step-brother of Jeremy Bentham. From Westminster School he passed to Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 14 June 1775. There he gained the chancellor&#x27;s prize for Latin verse as well as the Vinerian Scholarship. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 14 October 1768 and was called to the Bar on 9 May 1783.

Abbot was granted a BCL in 1783 and a DCL in 1793. On 14 February 1793, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Legal and political career==
In 1795, after having practised twelve years as a barrister, and having published a treatise proposing the incorporation of the judicial system of Wales with that of England, he was appointed to the office previously held by his brother of clerk of the rules in the King&#x27;s Bench; and in June of the same year he was elected Member of Parliament for Helston, through the influence of the Duke of Leeds.

In 1796 Abbot commenced his career as a reformer in Parliament by obtaining the appointment of two committees: one to report on the arrangements which then existed as to temporary laws or laws about to expire; and the other to devise methods for the better publication of new statutes. It was thanks to the work of the latter committee, and of a second committee which he proposed some years later, that copies of new statutes were subsequently routinely sent to all magistrates and municipal bodies. At a local level, he and Henry Richards (the other member returned for Helston) raised 200 guineas for the demolishing and rebuilding of the Helston coinage hall.

Abbot&#x27;s efforts also effected the establishment of the Record Commission; the reform of the system which had allowed the public money to lie for some time at long interest in the hands of the public accountants, by charging them with payment of interest; and, most important of all, the act for taking the first census of the United Kingdom, that of 1801. On the formation of the Addington ministry in March 1801, Abbot became Chief Secretary for Ireland and also Keeper of the Privy Seal of Ireland. In the February of the following year he was appointed Speaker of the House of Commons: at this point he stood down as Chief Secretary for Ireland, but he remained Keeper of the Privy Seal until his death. He served as Speaker until 1817, when an attack of erysipelas compelled him to retire. The House of Commons Library traces its origins to his time as Speaker. He objected to the Lay College at Maynooth, leading to its suppression in 1814.

In response to an address of the Commons, Abbot was raised to the peerage as Baron Colchester, of Colchester in the County of Essex on 1 June 1817, with a pension of £4,000, of which £3,000 was to be continued to his heir. His speeches against the Roman Catholic claims were published in 1828.

==Family==
In 1796, he had married, in London, Elizabeth Gibbes (1760–1847), the elder daughter of Sir Philip Gibbes, 1st Baronet, of Springhead, Barbados, by whom he had two sons. He was succeeded by his elder son Charles, Postmaster General in 1858, and subsequently by his grandson Reginald Abbot, 3rd Baron Colchester, on whose death in 1919 the title became extinct.

<text>The place names of the Maghreb come from a variety of origins, mostly Arabic and Berber, but including a few derived from Phoenician, Latin, and several other languages. This is well illustrated by the three largest cities of Algeria, for instance: Algiers from Arabic &quot;al-jazâ&#x27;ir&quot; &quot;the islands&quot;, Oran from Wahran from Berber &quot;wa-iharan&quot; &quot;place of lions&quot;, and Constantine (Arabic Qasantina قسنطينة) from the Latin name of the emperor Constantine.

<text>Policy analysis or public policy analysis is a technique used in the public administration sub-field of political science to enable civil servants, nonprofit organizations, and others to examine and evaluate the available options to implement the goals of laws and elected officials. People who regularly use policy analysis skills and techniques on the job, particularly those who use it as a major part of their job duties are generally known by the title policy analyst. The process is also used in the administration of large organizations with complex policies. It has been defined as the process of &quot;determining which of various policies will achieve a given set of goals in light of the relations between the policies and the goals.&quot;

Policy analysis can be divided into two major fields:

* Analysis existing policy, which is analytical and descriptive – it attempts to explain policies and their development 
* Analysis new policy, which is prescriptive – it is involved with formulating policies and proposals (for example: to improve social welfare)
One definition states that:

The areas of interest and the purpose of analysis determine what types of analysis are conducted. A combination of two kinds of policy analyses together with program evaluation is defined as &quot;policy studies&quot;. Policy analysis is frequently deployed in the public sector, but is equally applicable elsewhere, such as nonprofit organizations and non-governmental organizations. Policy analysis has its roots in systems analysis, an approach used by United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in the 1960s.

==Approaches==
Various approaches to policy analysis exist. The analysis &quot;for&quot; policy (and analysis &quot;of&quot; policy) is the central approach in social science and educational policy studies. It is linked to two different traditions of policy analysis and research frameworks. The approach of analysis &quot;for&quot; policy refers to research conducted for actual policy development, often commissioned by policymakers inside the bureaucracy (e.g. civil servants) within which the policy is developed. Analysis &quot;of&quot; policy is more of an academic exercise, conducted by academic researchers, professors and think tank researchers, who are often seeking to understand why a particular policy was developed at a particular time and assess the effects, intended or otherwise, of that policy when it was implemented.

There are three approaches that can be distinguished: the analysis-centric, the policy process, and the meta-policy approach.

===Analysis-centric===
The analysis-centric (or &quot;analycentric&quot;) approach focuses on individual problems and their solutions. Its scope is the micro-scale and its problem interpretation or problem resolution usually involves a technical solution. The primary aim is to identify the most effective and efficient solution in technical and economic terms (e.g. the most efficient allocation of resources).

===Policy process===

The policy process approach puts its focal point onto political processes and involved stakeholders; its scope is the broader meso-scale and it interprets problems using a political lens (i.e., the interests and goals of elected officials). It aims at determining what processes, means and policy instruments (e.g., regulation, legislation, subsidy) are used. As well, it tries to explain the role and influence of stakeholders within the policy process. &quot;Stakeholders&quot; is defined broadly to include citizens, community groups, non-governmental organizations, businesses and even opposing political parties. By changing the relative power and influence of certain groups (e.g., enhancing public participation and consultation), solutions to problems may be identified that have more &quot;buy in&quot; from a wider group. One way of doing this follows a heuristic model called the &quot;policy cycle&quot;. In its simplest form, the policy cycle, which is often depicted visually as a loop or circle, starts with the identification of the problem, proceeds to an examination of the different policy tools that could be used to respond to that problem, then goes on to the implementation stage, in which one or more policies are put into practice (e.g., a new regulation or subsidy is set in place), and then finally, once the policy has been implemented and run for a certain period, the policy is evaluated. A number of different viewpoints can be used during evaluation, including looking at a policy&#x27;s effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, value for money, outcomes or outputs.

===Meta-policy===
The meta-policy approach is a systems and context approach; i.e., its scope is the macro-scale and its problem interpretation is usually of a structural nature. It aims at explaining the contextual factors of the policy process; i.e., what the political, economic and socio-cultural factors are that influence it. As problems may result because of structural factors (e.g., a certain economic system or political institution), solutions may entail changing the structure itself.

==Methodology==
Policy analysis uses both qualitative methods and quantitative methods. Qualitative research includes case studies and interviews with community members. Quantitative research includes survey research, statistical analysis (also called &quot;data analysis&quot;) and model building. A common practice is to define the problem and evaluation criteria; identify and evaluate alternatives; and recommend a certain policy accordingly. Promotion of the best agendas are the product of careful &quot;back-room&quot; analysis of policies by assessment and &#x27; evaluation.

Several methods used in policy analysis are:
*Cost–benefit analysis
*Management by objectives (MBO)
*Operations research
*Decision-making based on analytics
*Program evaluation and review technique (PERT)
*Critical path method (CPM).

===Dimensions for analyzing policies===
There are six dimensions to policy analysis categorized as the effects and implementation of the policy across a period of time. Also collectively known as &quot;Durability&quot; of the policy, which means the capacity in content of the policy to produce visible 

Effects
Implementation
The strategic effects dimensions can pose certain limitations due to data collection. However the analytical dimensions of effects directly influences acceptability. The degree of acceptability is based upon the plausible definitions of actors involved in feasibility. If the feasibility dimension is compromised, it will put the implementation at risk, which will entail additional costs. Finally, implementation dimensions collectively influence a policy&#x27;s ability to produce results or impacts.

===Five-E approach===
One model of policy analysis is the &quot;five-E approach&quot;, which consists of examining a policy in terms of:
;Effectiveness: How well does it work (or how well will it be predicted to work)?
;Efficiency: How much work does or will it entail? Are there significant costs associated with this solution, and are they worth it?
;Ethical considerations: Is it ethically and morally sound? Are there unintended consequences?
;Evaluations of alternatives: How good is it compared to other approaches? Have all the relevant other approaches been considered?
;Establishment of recommendations for positive change: What can actually be implemented? Is it better to amend, replace, remove, or add a policy?

===Framework===
Policies are viewed as frameworks with the potential to optimize the general well-being. These are commonly analyzed by legislative bodies and lobbyists. Every policy analysis is intended to bring an evaluative outcome. A systemic policy analysis is meant for in depth study for addressing a social problem. Following are steps in a policy analysis:
# Defining the problem assessed by the policy.
# Assessing policy objectives and its target populations.
# Studying effects of the policy.
# Policy implications: distribution of resources, changes in services rights and statuses, tangible benefits. 
# Alternative policies: surveying existing and possible policy models that could have addressed the problem better or parts of it which could make it effective.

==Evidence-based models==
Many models exist to analyze the development and implementation of public policy. Analysts use these models to identify important aspects of policy, as well as explain and predict policy and its consequences. Each of these models are based upon the types of policies.

===Types===
* Government (e.g. federal, provincial, municipal)
* Policies adopted within public institutions (e.g. hospitals, child care centers, schools)
* Workplace (e.g. policies that govern employees and employee-manager relations)

===Governments===

Public policy is determined by a range of political institutions, which give policy legitimacy to policy measures. In general, the government applies policy to all citizens and monopolizes the use of force in applying or implementing policy (through government control of law enforcement, court systems, imprisonment and armed forces). The legislature, executive and judicial branches of government are examples of institutions that give policy legitimacy. Many countries also have independent, quasi-independent or arm&#x27;s length bodies which, while funded by government, are independent from elected officials and political leaders. These organizations may include government commissions, tribunals, regulatory agencies and electoral commissions.

====Process model====
Policy creation is a process that typically follows a sequence of steps or stages:
* Identification of a problem (also called &quot;problem definition&quot;) and demand for government action. Different stakeholders may define the same issue as different problems. For example, if homeless people are using illegal drugs such as heroin in a city park, some stakeholders may define this as a law enforcement issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if police presence in the park is stepped up and if the individuals using illegal drugs are arrested and punished); on the other hand, other stakeholders may view this as a poverty and public health issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if public health nurses and government medical doctors and substance abuse counsellors were sent to the park to do outreach with the drug-using individuals, and encourage them to voluntarily enter &quot;detoxification&quot; or rehabilitation programs).
* Agenda setting
* Formulation of policy proposals by various parties (e.g., citizen groups, congressional committees, think tanks, interest groups, lobby groups, non-governmental organizations).
* Policy selection/adoption and legal enactment of a selected policy by elected officials and/or houses of representatives. At this stage, policy legitimation is conferred upon the selected policy solution(s).
* Policy implementation, which involves civil servants putting the selected policy option into practice. Depending on the choice made by the executive or legislative branch, this could involve creating new regulation (or removing existing regulations), creating new laws, creating a new government program or service, creating a new subsidy or grant, etc.
* Policy evaluation. After the policy has been in place for a year or several years, civil servants or an independent consulting firm assesses the policy, to see if the goals were achieved, if the policy was implemented effectively, etc.

This model, however, has been criticized for being overly linear and simplistic. In reality, stages of the policy process may overlap or never happen. Also, this model fails to take into account the multiple factors attempting to influence the process itself as well as each other, and the complexity this entails.

===For public institutions===

One of the most widely used model for public institutions is one developed by Herbert A. Simon, the &quot;father of rational models&quot;; tt is also used by private corporations. However, many criticise the model due to some of its characteristics being impractical and relying on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined, and inter-dependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extraordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings.

====Rational planning model====
The rational planning model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy-making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”. The model makes a series of assumptions, such as: &quot;The model must be applied in a system that is stable&quot;; &quot;The government is a rational and unitary actor and that its actions are perceived as rational choices&quot;; &quot;The policy problem is unambiguous&quot;; &quot;There are no limitations of time or cost&quot;.

In the context of the public sector, policy models are intended to achieve maximum social gain, and may involved the following steps to achieve rational decisions:

#Intelligence gathering — A comprehensive organization of data; potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed.
#Identifying problems — Accounting for relevant factors.
#Assessing the consequences of all options — Listing possible consequences and alternatives that could resolve the problem and ranking the probability that each potential factor could materialize in order to give a correct priority to said factor in the analysis.
#Relating consequences to values — With all policies there will be a set of relevant dimensional values (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and a set of criteria for appropriateness, against which performance (or consequences) of each option being responsive can be judged.
#Choosing the preferred option — The policy is brought through from fully understanding the problems, opportunities, all the consequences &amp; the criteria of the tentative options and by selecting an optimal alternative with consensus of involved actors.

The Rational planning model has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, there are some who criticize the rational model due to the major problems which can be faced &amp; which tend to arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around. Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real-world context.

Further criticism of the rational model include: leaving a gap between planning and implementation, ignoring of the role of people, entrepreneurs, leadership, etc., the insufficiency of technical competence (i.e. ignoring the human factor), reflecting too mechanical an approach (i.e. the organic nature of organizations), requiring of multidimensional and complex models, generation of predictions which are often wrong (i.e. simple solutions may be overlooked), and incurring of cost (i.e. costs of rational-comprehensive planning may outweigh the cost savings of the policy).

However, Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that &quot;we ought to be trying for rational decision-making&quot;.

====Incremental policy====
An incremental policy model relies on features of incremental decision-making such as: satisficing, organizational drift, bounded rationality, and limited cognition, among others. Such policies are often called &quot;muddling through&quot; and represent a conservative tendency: new policies are only slightly different from old policies. Policy-makers are too short on time and other resources to make totally new policies; thus, past policies are accepted as having some legitimacy. When existing policies have sunk costs which discourage innovation, incrementalism is an easier approach than rationalism, and the policies are more politically expedient because they do not necessitate any radical redistribution of values. Such models necessarily struggle to, improve the acceptability of public policy.

Criticisms of such a policy approach include: challenges to bargaining (i.e. not successful with limited resources), downplaying useful quantitative information, obscuring real relationships between political entities, an anti-intellectual approach to problems (i.e. the preclusion of imagination), and a bias towards conservatism (i.e. bias against far-reaching solutions).

===For workplaces===

There are many contemporary policies relevant to gender and workplace issues. Actors analyze contemporary gender-related employment issues ranging from parental leave and maternity programs, sexual harassment, and work/life balance to gender mainstreaming. It is by the juxtaposition of a variety of research methodologies focused on a common theme the richness of understanding is gained. This integrates what are usually separate bodies of evaluation on the role of gender in welfare state developments, employment transformations, workplace policies, and work experience.

===Other===
There are several other major types of policy analysis, broadly groupable into competing approaches:

*Empirical versus normative policy analyses
*Retrospective versus prospective analyses
*Prescriptive versus descriptive analyses.

==Evaluation==
The success of a policy can be measured by changes in the behavior of the target population and active support from various actors and institutions involved. A public policy is an authoritative communication prescribing an unambiguous course of action for specified individuals or groups in certain situations. There must be an authority or leader charged with the implementation and monitoring of the policy with a sound social theory underlying the program and the target group. Evaluations can help estimate what effects will be produced by program objectives/alternatives. However, claims of causality can only be made with randomized control trials in which the policy change is applied to one group and not applied to a control group and individuals are randomly assigned to these groups.

To obtain compliance of the actors involved, the government can resort to positive sanctions, such as favorable publicity, price supports, tax credits, grants-in-aid, direct services or benefits; declarations; rewards; voluntary standards; mediation; education; demonstration programs; training, contracts; subsidies; loans; general expenditures; informal procedures, bargaining; franchises; sole-source provider awards...etc.

===Steps for conducting a policy evaluation===
Policy evaluation is used to examine content, implementation or impact of the policy, which helps to understand the merit, worth and the utility of the policy. Following are National Collaborating Centre for Healthy Public Policy&#x27;s (NCCHPP) 10 steps:

; Planning:
* Clarify the policy
* Engage stakeholders
* Assess resources and evaluability
* Determine your evaluation questions
* Determine methods and procedures
* Develop evaluation plan

; Implementation:
* Collect data
* Process data and analyze results

; Utilization:
* Interpret and disseminate the results 
* Apply evaluation findings

Details of such a plan may vary by institution and context. For example, a Public Health Ontario revision of the above replaces the first three steps with &quot;describe the program&quot;, &quot;identify and engage partners&quot;, and &quot;determine timelines and available resources&quot;, while otherwise retaining the model.

===Rapid evaluation and assessment methods===
There is sometimes a need for policy assessment to be conducted at speed, using rapid evaluation and assessment methods (REAM).

Characteristics of REAM include setting clear and targeted objectives at the start of a policy cycle, participation and interdisciplinary teamwork, simultaneous collection and analysis of data, and the staged reporting of findings. These require front-loaded effort: consulting with funders and achieving buy-in from informants who will face competing demands during implementation phases. They also blur the distinction between evaluation and implementation, as interim findings are used to adapt and improve processes.

Rapid methods can be used when there is a short policy cycle. For instance, they are often used in international development to assess the impact of aid policies in response to natural disasters. It has been suggested that rapid assessment methods may be necessary to evaluate energy and climate policies in the context of the climate emergency.

=== Value to policymakers ===

Policy analysis affects policymakers&#x27; decisions by introducing them to new ideas to consider, through the work of policy analysts summarizing ideas and frameworks found in the relevant literature.

Policymakers tend to value policy analysis more depending on the cause of a policy problem. Evidence of a purposeful cause for a problem can compel policy decisions more than unguided causes.

<text>Humphrey IV of Toron ( 1166 – 1198) was a leading baron in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. He inherited the Lordship of Toron from his grandfather, Humphrey II, in 1179. He was also heir to the Lordship of Oultrejourdan through his mother, Stephanie of Milly. In 1180, he renounced Toron on his engagement to Isabella, the half-sister of Baldwin IV of Jerusalem. The king, who had suffered from leprosy, allegedly wanted to prevent Humphrey from uniting two large fiefs. Humphrey married Isabella in Kerak Castle in autumn 1183. Saladin, the Ayyubbid sultan of Egypt and Syria, laid siege to Kerak during the wedding, but Baldwin IV and Raymond III of Tripoli relieved the fortress. 

Baldwin IV made his young nephew, Baldwin V, his successor before his death, but Baldwin V also died in the summer of 1186. The barons, who did not want to acknowledge the right of Baldwin V&#x27;s mother, Sybilla, and her husband, Guy of Lusignan, to inherit the kingdom, decided to proclaim Humphrey and his wife king and queen. However, Humphrey, who did not want to reign, deserted them and did homage to Sybilla and Guy. He was captured in 1187 at the Battle of Hattin, where Saladin imposed a crushing defeat on the united army of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. His mother offered the surrender of the fortresses of Oultrejordain to Saladin in exchange for Humphrey&#x27;s release. Although the garrisons of Kerak and Montréal refused to surrender, Saladin set Humphrey free. Kerak only fell to Saladin&#x27;s troops in late 1188, Montréal in early 1189.

After Queen Sybilla&#x27;s death in the autumn of 1190, most barons of the realm (including Isabella&#x27;s stepfather, Balian of Ibelin) wanted to give Isabella in marriage to Conrad of Montferrat, a successful military leader. The marriage of Humphrey and Isabella was annulled, although they protested the decision. Humphrey joined the retinue of King Richard I of England during his crusade in 1191–1192. Since Humphrey was fluent in Arabic, he conducted negotiations with Saladin&#x27;s brother, Al-Adil, on Richard&#x27;s behalf.

==Early life==

Humphrey was born in about 1165, the son of Humphrey, heir to Humphrey II of Toron, and Stephanie of Milly. Humphrey was a child when his father died around 1173. His mother soon inherited the Lordship of Oultrejourdan. She married Miles of Plancy, Seneschal of Jerusalem, who was murdered in October 1174. The following year she married Raynald of Châtillon. Humphrey inherited the Lordship of Toron from his grandfather who died of wounds received at the Battle of Banyas on 22 April 1179.

Baldwin IV of Jerusalem&#x27;s eight-year-old half-sister, Isabella, was betrothed to Humphrey in October 1180. His stepfather, Raynald of Châtillon, and Isabella&#x27;s stepfather, Balian of Ibelin, were prominent figures of the two groups of barons in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The two baronial groups had been competing for the control of state administration, because the king who suffered from leprosy could not rule alone. According to the marriage contract, Humphrey renounced his inherited domains (Toron, Banias and Chastel Neuf) in favor of Baldwin IV, in exchange for a money fief of 7,000 &quot;bezant&quot;s. This provision of the marriage contract suggests that the king wanted to prevent Humphrey from uniting two large fiefs, Toron and Oultrejourdan. Baldwin IV granted Toron or its usufruct to his mother, Agnes of Courtenay, around 1183.

Saladin, who had united Egypt and Syria under his rule, invaded the Kingdom of Jerusalem in September 1183. Humphrey commanded the forces of Oultrejourdain, dispatched by Raynald of Châtillon to join the united army of the kingdom. Saladin&#x27;s soldiers ambushed and almost annihilated his troops at Mount Gilboa. Saladin&#x27;s campaign ended with his withdrawal on 7 October, because he could not persuade the main army to join battle.

==Marriage==

Humphrey married Isabella in Kerak Castle in the autumn of 1183. During the wedding, Saladin laid siege to the fortress to take revenge for Raynald of Châtillon&#x27;s plundering raid on the Red Sea in February. According to a version of Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle, Humphrey&#x27;s mother convinced Saladin not to bombard the tower in which the newly married young couple were lodged, although he continued to besiege the rest of the fortress. Kerak was eventually relieved on 4 December by Baldwin IV and Raymond III of Tripoli.

The dying Baldwin IV, who had disinherited his sister Sybilla and her husband Guy of Lusignan in favor of her six-year-old son, Baldwin V, in March 1183, nominated Raymond of Tripoli regent to his successor. The High Court of Jerusalem also decreed that if Baldwin V died, the pope, the Holy Roman emperor, and the kings of France and England were to decide whether Sybilla or Isabella was entitled to succeed him. Baldwin IV died in March 1185, Baldwin V the next summer.

==Unwilling claimant==

Sybilla&#x27;s maternal uncle, Joscelin III of Courtenay, persuaded Raymond of Tripoli to leave Jerusalem to hold an assembly in Tiberias for the barons of the realm. After the regent departed to Tiberias, Joscelin invited Sybilla and Guy of Lusignan to Jerusalem. As soon as Raymond realized that Joscelin had deceived him, he summoned the High Court to Nablus. All the barons of the realm (including Humphrey) hurried to Nablus, except Humphrey&#x27;s stepfather, Raynald of Châtillon, who went to Jerusalem. The barons sent messengers to Jerusalem to remind Sybilla, Guy of Lusignan, and their supporters, of the High Court&#x27;s decision on the matter of the succession of Baldwin V. Ignoring their messages, Heraclius, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, crowned Sybilla queen, and she in turn placed the crown on her husband&#x27;s head. Before long, acting on Raymond of Tripoli&#x27;s proposal, the barons at Nablus decided to proclaim Isabella and Humphrey queen and king against Sybilla and Guy.

Raymond and his supporters were willing to march against Jerusalem, but Humphrey had no desire for the crown. He secretly left Nablus during the night and rode to Jerusalem to meet Sybilla. She refused him initially, but after Humphrey told her of his intention, she accompanied him to her husband. Humphrey swore fealty to Guy, putting an end to the conspiracy for Humphrey&#x27;s and Isabella&#x27;s coronation. All the barons except Raymond of Tripoli and Baldwin of Ramleh hurried to Jerusalem to do homage to Sybilla and Guy. Guy granted Toron and Chastel Neuf (two domains that Humphrey had abandoned in 1180) to Joscelin of Courtenay in 1186, stipulating that should he restore the two estates to Humphrey, he would receive the compensation that Humphrey had received for them.

==Battle of Hattin==

Humphrey&#x27;s stepfather, Raynald of Châtillon, plundered a caravan moving from Egypt to Syria in early 1187, claiming that the truce between the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Saladin did not cover his Lordship of Oultrejourdan. After Guy of Lusignan failed to persuade Raynald to pay compensation, Saladin proclaimed a jihad (holy war) against the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Saladin&#x27;s army crushed the united forces of the kingdom in the Battle of Hattin on 4 July 1187.

Humphrey also participated in the battle. He was captured on the battlefield like most of the commanders of the Christian army. With the exception of Raynald (whom he personally beheaded) and the knights of the Military Orders (who were massacred by fanatics), Saladin spared their lives. Saladin sent his prisoners to Damascus and conquered the Christian towns and fortresses one after another.

Two castles in Oultrejordan – Kerak and Montréal – were among the few fortresses that resisted. In October, Humphrey&#x27;s mother, Stephanie of Milly, promised to persuade the garrisons at the two fortresses to surrender if Saladin released Humphrey. Saladin accepted her offer and allowed Humphrey to join her. However, the defenders refused to surrender and Humphrey returned to Damascus. Before long, Saladin set Humphrey free again without demanding ransom. Saladin&#x27;s troops were unable to seize Kerak until the end of 1188, and Montréal some months later.

==Annulment of marriage==

Humphrey and his wife were present at the camp of the crusaders who besieged Acre when Queen Sybilla and her two daughters died in 1190. Most barons of the realm regarded Humphrey&#x27;s wife as Sybilla&#x27;s lawful heir, stating that Guy had lost his claim to rule after his wife and their children died. However, they also felt Humphrey was unsuitable to rule the kingdom, especially because he had refused to claim the throne against Sybilla and Guy in 1186. They preferred Conrad of Montferrat, a crusader leader who had prevented Saladin from occupying Tyre.

Isabella&#x27;s stepfather, Balian of Ibelin, was one of Conrad&#x27;s supporters. He and his partisans decided that the marriage of Isabella and Humphrey should be annulled. The marriage was childless. The contemporaneous &quot;Itinerarium Regis Ricardi&quot; describes Humphrey, around 1190, as &quot;more like a woman than a man, gentle in his dealings and with a bad stammer&quot;. Isabella&#x27;s mother, Maria Comnena, entered Isabella&#x27;s tent, and forced her to leave her husband.

Maria Comnena swore that Baldwin IV had forced her daughter to marry Humphrey at the age of eight. Ubaldo Lanfranchi, Archbishop of Pisa (who was Papal legate), and Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais, annulled Humphrey&#x27;s marriage to Isabella. During an inquiry ordered by Pope Innocent III into the prelates&#x27; decision, a group of knights who were present at the proceedings stated that both Isabella and Humphrey had protested the annulment. Before he died, Baldwin of Forde, the archbishop of Canterbury, forbade Isabella to marry Conrad, stating that both Isabella and Conrad would commit adultery if they married. Ignoring the archbishop&#x27;s ban, Conrad of Montferrat married Isabella on 24 November 1190.

==Last years==

Humphrey was among the barons who accompanied Guy of Lusignan, who did not renounce the kingdom, to meet King Richard I of England in Limassol in Cyprus in May 1191. Both men did homage to Richard. Richard dispatched Humphrey, who was fluent in Arabic, to open negotiations with Saladin&#x27;s brother, Al-Adil, in Lydda (now Lod in Israel). No agreement was reached, although Richard offered the hand of his sister, Joan, to Al-Adil and the Holy Land as her dowry. 

Two men murdered Conrad of Montferrat in Tyre on 28 April 1192. Although one of them confessed that Rashid ad-Din Sinan, head of the Assassins, had sent them to kill him, Humphrey was one of the suspects accused by contemporaneous sources of hiring them. Modern historians are unanimous in saying that Humphrey was innocent, pointing out that his &quot;career was not notable for displays of initiative in any case&quot;. The widowed Isabella married Count Henry II of Champagne in Acre on 5 May 1192. 

Humphrey died in 1198, shortly after Isabella, who had again been widowed, married Aimery of Lusignan, King of Cyprus. In 1229, Humphrey&#x27;s patrimony, Toron, was restored to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in accordance with the treaty of Al-Kamil, sultan of Egypt, and the Holy Roman emperor, Frederick II. The domain was seized by Maria of Antioch, who was the great-granddaughter of Humphrey&#x27;s sister, Isabella of Toron.

<text>Hamzah Fansuri (Jawi: حمزه فنسوري ; also spelled Hamzah Pansuri, d. 1590 ?) was a 16th-century Sumatran Sufi writer, and the first writer known to write mystical panentheistic ideas in the Malay language. He wrote poetry as well as prose. He has been called the &quot;first Malay poet&quot; and the first known poet to have written in the Malay poetic form &quot;syair&quot;. 

==Life==

Information on Hamzah&#x27;s life comes largely from the &quot;takhallus bait&quot; (pen-name stanza) that ends his poetry (&quot;syair&quot;), as well as from the work of his disciple Hasan Fansuri and commentaries on Hamzah&#x27;s poems. However, many of his biographical details are uncertain. His name indicates that he may be from Barus (also known as Fansur to the Arabs), or have spent a large part of his life there. A link to the Siamese Ayutthaya (&quot;Shahr-i-Naw&quot;) has also been proposed, although it may be that he travelled to Ayutthaya rather than that being his birthplace. He was inducted into a Sufi order and it is thought that he may have worked at the court of the Aceh Sultanate.

Hamzah travelled widely, and was known to have visited the Malay Peninsula, Mughal India, Mecca and Medina, and Baghdad. He was one of the earliest Southeast Asians to have completed the hajj during the early 16th century. The date of his death is generally assumed to be around 1590 or earlier, although a later date during the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda has also been proposed. However, an inscription on a gravestone found in Mecca for a Shaykh Hamza b. Abd Allah al-Fansuri recorded a date of April 11, 1527, although that identification has been challenged. Such an early date, if confirmed, may suggest that Hamzah did not live or work in Aceh, rather he was in Barus before leaving for Mecca where he died.

==Panentheism==
Hamzah Fansuri&#x27;s panentheism was derived from the writings of the medieval Islamic scholars. He was influenced by Ibn Arabi&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;Waḥdat al-Wujūd&quot; popular in Persia and Mughal India during the 16th century. Ibn Arabi taught that all reality is one and everything that exists is part of the divine. He perceived God as immanent within all things, including the individual, and sought to unite one&#x27;s self with the indwelling spirit of God. He employed the doctrine of seven stages of emanation (&quot;martabat&quot;) in which God manifests Himself in this world, ending in the Perfect Man, a doctrine widespread in Indonesia at the time. His teachings were promoted by Aceh theologian Shamsuddin al-Sumatrani.

However, his views were later deemed heretical by Nuruddin ar-Raniri for not conforming to the Islamic belief that God remained unchanged by His creation. Nuruddin travelled to Aceh and under his influence, the Sultana Taj ul-Alam attempted to eradicate Hamzah&#x27;s works and name, and his writings were burnt.

== Works ==
The poetry, &quot;syair&quot; or &quot;ruba&#x27;i&quot;, of Hamzah Fansuri are usually not more than 13-15 stanzas, but some may be up to 21. 32 of his poems have survived, and Hamzah included in each poem his name and information about himself in the last stanza (&quot;takhallus bait&quot;). Scholars have commented on his technical skill and mastery in his rhymes, the effective blending Arabic words into Malay poetic structure. They also noted a fondness for pun in his works that displays his humour and poetical flair. He also wrote prose, and his three surviving works in prose are:
* &quot;Sharab al-&#x27;ashiqin&quot; (&quot;The Lovers&#x27; Beverage&quot;)
* &quot;Asrar al-&#x27;arifin&quot; (&quot;The Secrets of the Gnostics&quot;)
* &quot;Kitab al-Muntahi&quot; (&quot;The Adept&quot;) – a collection of Arabic and Persian quotations with discussions in Malay.
He was the first writer to write about Sufi doctrines poetically in the Malay language, or indeed any other languages of the Malay archipelago.

<doc id="639399" wikidata="Q33281" url="?curid=639399" title="Chavacano">
<text>Chavacano or Chabacano () is a group of Spanish-based creole language varieties spoken in the Philippines. The variety spoken in Zamboanga City, located in the southern Philippine island group of Mindanao, has the highest concentration of speakers. Other currently existing varieties are found in Cavite City and Ternate, located in the Cavite province on the island of Luzon. Chavacano is the only Spanish-based creole in Asia. The 2020 Census of Population and Housing counted 106,000 households generally speaking Chavacano.

The one responsible for this Spanish creole was Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, then governor of Panama, who was also responsible for settling Zamboanga City by employing Peruvian soldiers and colonists. There was an Asian-American route, which led to traders and adventurers carrying silver from Peru through Panama to reach Acapulco, Mexico before sailing to Manila, Philippines using the famed Manila galleons.

The different varieties of Chavacano differ in certain aspects like vocabulary but they are generally mutually intelligible by speakers of these varieties, especially between neighboring varieties. While a majority of the lexicon of the different Chavacano varieties derive from Spanish, their grammatical structures are generally similar to other Philippine languages. Among Philippine languages, it is the only one that is not an Austronesian language, but like Malayo-Polynesian languages, it uses reduplication.

The word &quot;&quot; is derived from Spanish, roughly meaning &quot;poor taste&quot; or &quot;vulgar&quot;, though the term itself carries no negative connotations to contemporary speakers.

== Distribution and variants ==

===Varieties===
Linguists have identified at least six Spanish creole varieties in the Philippines. Their classification is based on their substrate languages and the regions where they are commonly spoken. The three known varieties of Chavacano with Tagalog as their substrate language are the Luzon-based creoles of which are Caviteño (spoken in Cavite City), Bahra or Ternateño (spoken in Ternate, Cavite) and Ermiteño (once spoken in the old district of Ermita in Manila and is now extinct).

There are a number of theories on how these different varieties of Chavacano have evolved and how they are related to one another. According to some linguists, Zamboangueño Chavacano is believed to have been influenced by Caviteño Chabacano as evidenced by prominent Zamboangueño families who descended from Spanish Army officers (from Spain and Latin America), primarily Caviteño mestizos, stationed at Fort Pilar in the 19th century. When Caviteño officers recruited workers and technicians from Iloilo to man their sugar plantations and rice fields to reduce the local population&#x27;s dependence on the Donativo de Zamboanga, the Spanish colonial government levied taxes on the islanders to support the fort&#x27;s operations. With the subsequent migration of Ilonggo traders to Zamboanga, the Zamboangueño Chavacano was infused with Hiligaynon words as the previous migrant community was assimilated.

Most of what appears to be Bisaya words in Zamboangueño Chavacano are actually Hiligaynon. Although Zamboangueño Chavacano&#x27;s contact with Bisaya began much earlier when Bisaya soldiers were stationed at Fort Pilar during the Spanish colonial period, it was not until closer to the middle of the 20th century that borrowings from Bisaya accelerated from more migration from the Visayas as well as the current migration from other Visayan-speaking areas of the Zamboanga Peninsula.

Zamboangueño (Chavacano) is spoken in Zamboanga City, Basilan, parts of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, and Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay and Zamboanga del Norte. Zamboangueño Chavacano is the most dynamically spoken language of Philippine Creole Spanish. It is used as a lingua franca between both Muslim and Christians in the Southwestern Mindanao and Basilan Islands communities. Its influence has spread to other islands in the west, such as the Jolo Islands, as well as to Cotabato and Davao in Mindanao. The other varieties of Chavacano with Cebuano as their primary substrate language are the Mindanao-based creoles of which are Castellano Abakay or Chavacano Davaoeño (spoken in some areas of Davao), influenced by Hokkien Chinese and Japanese, and divided into two varieties, &quot;Castellano Abakay Chino&quot; and &quot;Castellano Abakay Japón&quot;, and Cotabateño (spoken in Cotabato City). Both Cotabateño and Davaoeño are very similar to Zamboangueño.

===Characteristics===
The Chavacano languages in the Philippines are creoles based on Mexican Spanish, southern peninsular Spanish and possibly, Portuguese. In some Chavacano languages, most words are common with Andalusian Spanish, but there are many words borrowed from Nahuatl, a language native to Central Mexico, which aren&#x27;t found in Andalusian Spanish. Although the vocabulary is largely Mexican, its grammar is mostly based on other Philippine languages, primarily Ilonggo, Tagalog and Bisaya. By way of Spanish, its vocabulary also has influences from the Native American languages Nahuatl, Taino, Quechua, etc. as can be evidenced by the words &quot;chongo&quot; (&quot;monkey&quot;, instead of Spanish ), &quot;tiange&quot; (&quot;mini markets&quot;), etc.

In contrast with the Luzon-based dialects, the Zamboangueño variety has the most borrowings and/or influence from other Philippine Austronesian languages including Hiligaynon and Tagalog. Words of Malay origin are present in the Zamboangueño variety; the latter is included because although not local in Philippines, it was the lingua franca of maritime Southeast Asia and is still spoken in Muslim areas of Mindanao. As the Zamboangueño variety is also spoken by Muslims, the variety has some Arabic loanwords, most commonly Islamic terms. In spite of this, it&#x27;s difficult to trace whether these words have their origin in the local population or in Spanish itself, given that Spanish has about 6,000 words of Arabic origin. Chavacano also contains loanwords of Persian origin which enter Chavacano via Malay and Arabic; both Persian and Spanish are Indo-European languages.

===Demographics===
The highest number of Chavacano speakers are found in Zamboanga City and in the island province of Basilan. A significant number of Chavacano speakers are found in Cavite City and Ternate. There are also speakers in some areas in the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga del Norte, Davao, and in Cotabato City. According to the official 2000 Philippine census, there were altogether 607,200 Chavacano speakers in the Philippines in that same year. The exact figure could be higher as the 2000 population of Zamboanga City, whose main language is Chavacano, far exceeded that census figure. Also, the figure doesn&#x27;t include Chavacano speakers of the Filipino diaspora. All the same, Zamboangueño is the variety with the most number of speakers, being the official language of Zamboanga City whose population is now believed to be over a million; is also an official language in Basilan.

Chavacano speakers are also found in Semporna and elsewhere in Sabah via immigration to Sabah during the Spanish colonial period and via Filipino refugees who escaped from Zamboanga Peninsula and predominantly Muslim areas of Mindanao like Sulu Archipelago.

A small number of Zamboanga&#x27;s indigenous peoples and of Basilan, such as the Tausugs, the Samals, and the Yakans, majority of those people are Sunni Muslims, also speak the language. In the close provinces of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi areas, there are Muslim speakers of the &quot;Chavacano de Zamboanga&quot;, all of them are neighbors of Christians. Speakers of the &quot;Chavacano de Zamboanga&quot;, both Christians and Muslims, also live in Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. Christians and Muslims in Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat, Cotabato, South Cotabato, Cotabato City, and Saranggani speak &quot;Chavacano de Zamboanga&quot;. Take note that Zamboanga Peninsula, Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-tawi, Maguindanao, Cotabato City, Soccsksargen (region that composed of Sultan Kudarat, Cotabato, South Cotabato, and Saranggani) and Davao Region became part of short-lived Republic of Zamboanga, which chose Chavacano as official language. As a result of Spanish colonization, according to a genetic study written by Maxmilian Larena, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States, the Philippine ethnic groups with the highest amount of Spanish/European descent are the Chavacanos, with 4 out of 10 Chavacanos having detectable Spanish descent, followed by Bicolanos, with 1–2 out of 10, while most of the lowland urbanized Christian ethnic groups have some Spanish descent.

===Social significance===

Chavacano has been primarily and practically a spoken language. In the past, its use in literature was limited and chiefly local to the geographical location where the particular variety of the language was spoken. Its use as a spoken language far exceeds its use in literary work in comparison to the use of Spanish in the Philippines which was more successful as a written language than a spoken language. In recent years, there have been efforts to encourage the use of Chavacano as a written language, but the attempts were mostly minor attempts in folklore and religious literature and few pieces of written materials by the print media. In Zamboanga City, while the language is used by the mass media, the Catholic Church, education, and the local government, there have been few literary work written in Zamboangueño and access to these resources by the general public isn&#x27;t readily available; Bibles of Protestant Christians are also written in standard Chavacano. As Chavacano is spoken by Muslims as second language not only in Zamboanga City and Basilan but even in Sulu and Tawi-tawi, a number of Qur&#x27;an books are published in Chavacano.

The Zamboangueño variety has been constantly evolving especially during half of the past century until the present. Zamboangueño has been experiencing an infusion of English and more Tagalog words and from other languages worldwide in its vocabulary and there have been debates and discussions among older Chavacano speakers, new generation of Chavacano speakers, scholars, linguists, sociologists, historians, and educators regarding its preservation, cultivation, standardization, and its future as a Spanish-based creole. In 2000, The Instituto Cervantes in Manila hosted a conference entitled &quot;Shedding Light on the Chavacano Language&quot; at the Ateneo de Manila University. Starting school year 2012–13, the Zamboangueño variant has also been taught at schools following the implementation of the Department of Education&#x27;s policy of Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE). It serves as a medium of instruction from kindergarten to grade 3 and as a separate subject (Mother Tongue) from grades 1 to 3.

Because of the grammatical structures, Castilian usage, and archaic Spanish words and phrases that Chavacano (especially Zamboangueño) uses, between speakers of both contemporary Spanish and Chavacano who are uninitiated, both languages appear to be non-intelligible to a large extent. For the initiated speakers, Chavacano can be intelligible to some Spanish speakers, and while most Spanish words can easily be understood by Chavacano speakers, many would struggle to understand a complete Spanish sentence.

==Terminology==
The term Chavacano or Chabacano originated from the Spanish word &quot;&quot; which literally means &quot;poor taste&quot;, &quot;vulgar&quot;, &quot;common&quot;, &quot;of low quality&quot;, or &quot;coarse&quot;. Chavacano has since evolved into a word of its own in different spellings with no negative connotation, but to simply being the name of the language itself (Banquicio, 2021).

During the Spanish colonial period, what is today called &quot;Chavacano&quot; was also called by the Spanish-speaking population as the &quot;&quot;lenguaje de la calle&quot;, &quot;lenguaje de parian&quot; (language of the street), or &quot;lenguaje de cocina&quot;&quot; (language of the kitchen) to refer to the Chabacano spoken by the people of Manila, particularly in Ermita) to distinguish it from the Spanish language spoken by those of the upper class, which consisted of Spaniards and educated Natives.

Linguists use the term Philippine Creole Spanish which can be further divided into two geographic classifications: Manila Bay Creoles (which includes Ternateño and Caviteño) and Mindanao Creole (including Zamboangueño). The varieties of the language are geographically related. The Manila Bay Creoles have Tagalog as their substrate language while The Mindanao Creoles have Visayan (mostly Cebuano, Tausug, and Hiligaynon), Subanon, and Sama as their substrate language(s).

Chavacano/Chabacano speakers themselves have different preferences on whether to spell the language with a V or a B. They emphasise the difference between their variety and others using their own geographical location as a point of reference. Language speakers in Ternate also use the term Bahra to refer to their language and their city. Chavacano varieties usually have their area name attached to the language.

In Zamboanga City, most people are using the V in spelling the language as Chavacano. In the three-day Chavacano Orthography Congress held on Nov 19–21, 2014, wherein it included the presentation by researchers on Chavacano, mostly results from surveys conducted among selected respondents in the city, the newly organized Chavacano Orthography Council met with the officials of the Department of Education and agreed among others that the language is to be spelled with the V. Most people in support of this move would like to distance their language Chavacano to the word Chabacano which also means ‘vulgar” in Spanish.

==Historical background==

There is no definite conclusion on the precise history of how these different varieties of Chavacano developed.

Prior to the formation of what is today the Philippines, what existed were a collection of various islands and different ethnolinguistic groups inhabiting them. The Spanish colonisation of the Philippine islands had led to the presence of the Spanish language in the islands. Though Spanish was the language of the government, the various languages originating and found in the islands remained the mother tongue of the various inhabitants. Instead of using Spanish to spread Christianity, Spanish missionaries preferred to learn the various local languages. With over 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, the Spanish language came to influence the various Philippine languages to varying degrees by way of aspects like new loanwords and expressions.

Creole languages (such as French-based creoles) have formed at various points in time around the world due to colonialism. As a result of contact between speakers of two mutually non-intelligible languages, creole languages have evolved in some cases to facilitate communication. This usually involves taking the vocabulary of another language and grammatical features of the native language. In contrast to the numerous French-based creole languages, only three creole languages have been found to be Spanish-based or heavily influenced: Papiamento, Palenquero, and Chavacano. In the Philippines, a major difficulty in tracing the development of Chabacano is the confusion attributed to in accounts of travelers to the Philippines between a coherent creole language, `broken Spanish&#x27;, and fluent Spanish. The earliest believed attestation of a coherent creole language spoken in Cavite City comes from the Augustinian priest Martínez de Zúñiga who in his 1803 accounts of his travels in the Philippines, &quot;Estadismos de las Islas Filipinas&quot;, notes that &quot;In Cavite and in its suburb of San Roque, a very corrupted Spanish is spoken, whose phraseology is entirely taken from the language of the country&quot;. Mentions of a vernacular referred to as &quot;kitchen Spanish&quot; and &quot;language of the market&quot; (referring to the Manila variety), or other terms are found in a number of texts of the 19th century. However, the kind of vernacular referred to by these terms are imprecise and these terms may refer to a fully fledged creole or to a Spanish-pidgin spoken by Chinese and Filipino merchants.

The manner of formation of this type of speech found in a number of communities around the Philippines remains unclear today. A sample of what is today called &quot;Chabacano&quot; may be found in dialogues contained in chapters 18 (&quot;Supercherías&quot;) and 28 (&quot;Tatakut&quot;) of Filipino writer José Rizal&#x27;s 1891 work &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot;. The dialogue found in chapter 18 is:

In the 1883 work of German linguist Hugo Schuchardt &quot;Uber das Malaiospanische der Philippinen&quot;, he presents fragments of texts and comments of what he calls &quot;Malayo-Spanish&quot;. However, the first to give a general study and investigation of the varieties of Chavacano as a group was by Keith Whinnom in his 1956 work &quot;The Spanish Contact Vernaculars in the Philippine Islands &quot;. Whinnom gives an overall view of the history and grammar of what he calls &quot;Ermitaño&quot; of Ermita in Manila, &quot;Caviteño&quot; of Cavite and &quot;Zamboangueño&quot; of Zamboanga. In it, he also postulates his monogenetic theory on the origin of these vernaculars.

Linguists are unsettled about how these vernaculars formed and how they connect to one another, if any. There are many theories, but the two main theories of the origin of Chavacano are Whinnom&#x27;s &quot;monogenetic theory&quot; and a &quot;parallel-development&quot; theory proposed by Frake in 1971.

===Monogenetic theory===

According to the monogenetic theory or one-way theory advanced by Whinnom, all varieties of Chavacano result from a single source, and all such varieties are related to each other.

===Parallel-development theory===

The parallel development theory or two-way theory as advocated by Frake in 1971, the variants found in Luzon and Mindanao had evolved autonomously from each other.

===Zamboangueño===

On 23 June 1635, Zamboanga City, which was part of the Subanon people&#x27;s ancestral land, became a permanent foothold of the Spanish government with the construction of the San José Fortress. Bombardment and harassment from pirates and raiders of the sultans of Mindanao and Jolo and the determination to spread Christianity further south (as Zamboanga was a crucial strategic location) of the Philippines forced the Spanish missionary friars to request reinforcements from the colonial government.

The military authorities decided to import labour from Luzon and the Visayas. Thus, the construction workforce eventually consisted of Spanish, Mexican and Peruvian soldiers, masons from Cavite (who comprised the majority), sacadas from Cebu and Iloilo, and those from the various local tribes of Zamboanga like the Samals and Subanons.

Language differences made it difficult for one ethnic group to communicate with another. To add to this, work instructions were issued in Spanish. The majority of the workers were unschooled and therefore did not understand Spanish but needed to communicate with each other and the Spaniards. A pidgin developed and became a full-fledged creole language still in use today as a lingua franca and/or as an official language, mainly in Zamboanga City.

When the Sultanate of Sulu gave up its territories in Sulu Archipelago to Spain within late 1700s (Sulu Sultanate gave up Basilan to Spain in 1762, while Sulu and Tawi-tawi were not given up by sultanate because the Sulu Sultanate only recognised partial Spanish sovereignty to Sulu and Tawi-tawi), Spanish settlers and soldiers brought the language to the region until Spain, Germany, and United Kingdom signed an agreement named the Madrid Protocol of 1885 that recognised Spanish rule of Sulu Archipelago. Chavacano becomes a lingua franca of Sulu Archipelago (composing of Sulu, Tawi-tawi, Basilan), as these were formerly part of Western Mindanao (presently named Zamboanga Peninsula), only Isabela City (Basilan&#x27;s capital) remained part of Zamboanga Peninsula; although North Borneo (now Sabah) is not included on the Spanish East Indies area as stated on the Protocol and control by the United Kingdom, Chavacano has still a little impact in Semporna.

From then on, constant Spanish military reinforcements as well as increased presence of Spanish religious and educational institutions have fostered the Spanish creole.

===Caviteño/Ternateño===
The Merdicas (also spelled Mardicas or Mardikas) were Catholic natives of the islands of Ternate and Tidore of the Moluccas in the vicinity of New Guinea, converted during the Portuguese occupation of the islands by Jesuit missionaries. The islands were later captured by the Spanish who vied for their control with the Dutch. In 1663, the Spanish garrison in Ternate was forced to pull out to defend Manila against an impending invasion by Koxinga, the new ruler of Kingdom of Tungning in Formosa (Taiwan) (sacrificing the Moluccas to the Dutch in doing so). A number of Merdicas volunteered to help, eventually being resettled in a sandbar near the mouth of the Maragondon river (known as the &quot;Barra de Maragondon&quot;) and Tanza, Cavite, Manila.

The invasion did not occur as Koxinga fell ill and died. The Merdicas&#x27; community eventually integrated into the local population. Today, the location of the community is called Ternate after the island of Ternate in the Moluccas, and the descendants of the Merdicas continue to use their Spanish creole (with Portuguese influence), which has come to be known as Caviteño or Ternateño Chavacano.

===Ermiteño===

:En la dulzura de mi afán,
:Junto contigo na un peñon
:Mientras ta despierta
:El buan y en
:Las playas del Pasay
:Se iba bajando el sol.

:Yo te decía, &quot;gusto ko&quot;
:Tu me decías, &quot;justo na&quot;
:Y de repente
:¡Ay nakú!
:Ya sentí yo como si
:Un asuáng ta cercá.

:Que un cangrejo ya corré,
:Poco a poco na tu lao.
:Y de pronto ta escondé
:Bajo tus faldas, ¡amoratáo!

:Cosa que el diablo hacé,
:Si escabeche o kalamáy,
:Ese el que no ta sabé
:Hasta que yo ya escuché
:Fuerte-fuerte el voz: ¡Aray!

The following is a sample of Ermitaño taken from the April 1917 publication of &quot;The Philippine Review&quot;. The poem was written by the Filipino Spanish-language writer Jesús Balmori (who also wrote other texts in Ermitaño), and it is entitled &quot;Na Maldito Arena&quot;:

Ta sumí el sol na fondo del mar, y el mar, callao el boca. Ta jugá con su mana marejadas com&#x27;un muchacha nerviosa con su mana pulseras. El viento no mas el que ta alborota, el viento y el pecho de Felisa que ta lleno de sampaguitas na fuera y lleno de suspiros na dentro...

According to Keith Whinnom&#x27;s &quot;Spanish contact vernaculars in the Philippine Islands&quot; (1956), there were reportedly still an estimated 12,000 speakers in 1942 of Ermitaño. After World War II, much of Manila was destroyed and its citizens displaced. This variety is considered to be virtually extinct.

===Caviteño/Ternateño===

;Nisós ya pidí pabor cun su papáng.
:Spanish: Nosotros ya pedimos un favor de tu padre.
:(We have already asked your father for a favor.)
Ternateño follows a pronominal system of three different pronouns, including subjects, objects and possession. The system follows the same pattern as Spanish, including both singular and plural conjugations based on what the speaker is explaining. For example &quot;yo (Spanish singular) becomes bo (Ternateño),&quot; whereas nosotros (Spanish plural) becomes mihótro (&quot;Ternateño).&quot; Additionally Ternateño incorporates alternate language forms for different participles to denote the relationship with the individual being the speaker as well as the listener. This includes polite as well as casual foundations of speech, for example, yo (casual) versus (éle).

====Another sample of Caviteño Chavacano====

Caviteño Chavacano:

Puede nisós hablá: que grande nga palá el sacrificio del mga héroes para niso independencia. Debe nga palá no niso ulvida con ilos. Ansina ya ba numa? Debe hací niso mga cosa para dale sabí que ta aprecia niso con el mga héroes. Que preparáo din niso hací sacrificio para el pueblo. ¿Qué laya? ¿Escribí mga novela como José Rizal?

Spanish:

Nosotros podemos decir qué grandes sacrificios ofrecieron nuestros héroes para obtener nuestra independencia. Entonces, no nos olvidemos de ellos. ¿Cómo lo logramos? Necesitamos hacer cosas para que sepan que apreciamos a nuestros héroes; que estamos preparados también a sacrificarnos por el pueblo. ¿Cómo lo haremos? ¿Hay que escribir también novelas como José Rizal?

English:

We can say what great sacrifices our heroes have done to achieve our independence. We should therefore not forget them. How do we do that? We should do things to let it be known that we appreciate the heroes; that we are prepared to make sacrifices for our people. How? Should we write novels like José Rizal?

==Vocabulary==

===Forms and style===

Chavacano (especially Zamboangueño) has two registers or sociolects: The common, colloquial, vulgar or familiar and the formal register/sociolects. Broadly speaking, the formal register is closer to Spanish, and the colloquial register to the local Austronesian languages.

In the common, colloquial, vulgar or familiar register/sociolect, words of local origin or a mixture of local and Spanish words predominate. The common or familiar register is used ordinarily when conversing with people of equal or lower status in society. It is also used more commonly in the family, with friends and acquaintances. Its use is of general acceptance and usage.

In the formal register/sociolect, words of Spanish origin or Spanish words predominate. The formal register is used especially when conversing with people of higher status in society. It is also used when conversing with elders (especially in the family and with older relatives) and those in authority. It is more commonly used by older generations, by Zamboangueño mestizos, and in the barrios. It is the form used in speeches, education, media, and writing. The formal register used in conversation is sometimes mixed with some degree of colloquial register.

The following examples show a contrast between the usage of formal words and common or familiar words in Chavacano:

==Writing system==
Chavacano is written using the Latin script. As Chavacano has mostly been a spoken language than a written one, multiple ways of writing the different varieties of Chavacano exist. Most published Chavacano texts utilize spelling systems nearly identical to Spanish, adjusting certain spellings of words to reflect how they are pronounced by native Chavacano speakers. Since the propagation of the usage of the Filipino language in education and the media as the national language, Filipino&#x27;s orthography has affected how certain persons might spell Chavacano, especially since recent generations have grown unfamiliar with Spanish orthography; Most published works, and the general media, however, more often retain Spanish-based spelling systems.

The kind of writing system used to write Chavacano may differ according to the writer of the text. Writing may be written using a Spanish-derived writing system, where all words (including words of local origin) are spelled adhering to basic Spanish orthographic rules; it may also be written &quot;phonetically&quot;, similar to the modern orthography of Filipino; another writing style uses a mixture of the two, spelling words based on an etymological approach, using phonetic spelling for words of Filipino origin and Spanish spelling rules for words of Spanish origin.

in Zamboanga, an etymological-based approach was formally recently endorsed by the local city government and this is the system used in public schools as part of the mother-tongue policy of the Department of Education for kindergarten to grade 3. In principle, words of Spanish origin are to be spelled using Spanish rules while Chavacano words of local origin are spelled in the manner according to their origin. Thus, the letter &quot;k&quot; appear mostly in words of Austronesian origin or in loanwords from other Philippine languages (words such as &quot;kame&quot;, &quot;kita&quot;, &quot;kanamon&quot;, &quot;kaninyo&quot;).
It is uncommon in modern written works to include the acute accent and the trema in writing except in linguistic or highly formalized texts. Also, the letters &quot;ñ&quot; and &quot;ll&quot; are sometimes replaced by &quot;ny&quot; and &quot;ly&quot; in informal texts.

===Alphabet===

The Chavacano alphabet has 30 letters, including , , , and :

a, b, c, ch, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, ll, m, n, ñ, o, p, q, r, rr, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z

====Letters and letter names====

Other letter combinations include &quot;rr&quot; (erre), which is pronounced or , and &quot;ng,&quot; which is pronounced . Another combination was &quot;ñg,&quot; which was pronounced but is now obsolete and is only written as &quot;ng&quot;.

Some sounds are not represented in the Chavacano written language. These sounds are mostly in words of Philippine and foreign origin. Furthermore, the pronunciation of some words of Spanish origin have become distorted or Philippinized in modern Chavacano. Some vowels have become allophonized (&#x27;e&#x27; and &#x27;o&#x27; becomes &#x27;i&#x27; and &#x27;u&#x27; in some words) and some consonants have changed their pronunciation. (i.e. &quot;escoger&quot; became &quot;iscují&quot; in informal speech; &quot;tiene&quot; ; &quot;Dios&quot; ; &quot;Castilla&quot; became instead of ).

Glottal stops, as in Filipino languages, are not also indicated (â, ê, î, ô, û). These sounds are mainly found in words of Philippine origin and are only indicated in dictionaries (i.e. jendê = not; olê = again) and when they are, the circumflex accent is used.

Other pronunciation changes in some words of Spanish origin include:

: f ~ 
: j, g (before &#x27;e&#x27; and &#x27;i&#x27;) ~ (in common with dialects of Caribbean and other areas of Latin America and southern Spain)
: ch ~ 
: rr ~ 
: di, de ~ (when followed or preceded by other vowels: Dios ~ /jos/; dejalo ~ /jalo/)
: ti, te ~ (when followed or preceded by other vowels: tierra ~ /chehra/; tiene ~ /chene/)
: ci, si ~ (when followed or preceded by other vowels: conciencia ~ /konʃenʃa/)

, which are pronounced as fricatives in other Spanish dialects when between vowels, are uniformly pronounced as stops in Chavacano.

===Other sounds===

: -h (glottal fricative in the final position); sometimes not written
: -g ; sometimes written as just -k
: -d ; sometimes written as just -t
: -kh []; only in loanwords of Arabic origin, mostly Islamic terms

===Sounds from English===

: “v” pronounced as English “v” (like: vase) (vi)
: “z” pronounced as English “z” (like: zebra) (zi)
: “x” pronounced as English “x” (like: X-ray) (ex/eks)
: “h” like: house (/eitsh/); sometimes written as &#x27;j&#x27;

===Diphthongs===

==Grammar==

===Simple sentence structure (verb–subject–object word order)===

Chavacano is a language with the verb–subject–object sentence order. This is because it follows the Hiligaynon or Tagalog grammatical structures. However, the subject–verb–object order does exist in Chavacano but only for emphasis purposes (see below). New generations have been slowly and vigorously using the S-V-O pattern mainly because of the influence of the English language. These recent practices have been most prevalent and evident in the mass media particularly among Chavacano newswriters who translate news leads from English or Tagalog to Chavacano where the &quot;who&quot; is emphasized more than the &quot;what&quot;. Because the mass media represent &quot;legitimacy&quot;, it is understood by Chavacano speakers (particularly Zamboangueños) that the S-V-O sentence structure used by Chavacano journalists is standardized.

====Declarative affirmative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====

Chavacano generally follows the simple verb–subject–object or verb–object–subject sentence structure typical of Hiligaynon or Tagalog in declarative affirmative sentences:

:Ta comprá (verb) el maga/mana negociante (subject) con el tierra (object).
:Ta comprá (verb) tierra (object) el maga/mana negociante (subject).
::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) ang mga manogbaligya (subject) sang duta (object).
::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) sang duta (object) ang mga manogbaligya (subject).
::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ang mga negosyante (subject) ng lupa (object).
::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ng lupa (object) ang mga negosyante (subject).
:::(‘The businessmen are buying land.’)

The subject always appears after the verb, and in cases where pronominal subjects (such as personal pronouns) are used in sentences, they will never occur before the verb:

:Ya andá yo na iglesia enantes.
::(‘I went to church a while ago.’)

====Declarative negative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====

When the predicate of the sentence is negated, Chavacano uses the words hindê (from Tagalog ’hindi’ or Hiligaynon &#x27;indi&#x27; which means ’no’; the Cebuano uses &#x27;dili&#x27;, which shows its remoteness from Chavacano as compared to Hiligaynon) to negate the verb in the present tense, no hay (which literally means ’none’) to negate the verb that was supposed to happen in the past, and hindê or nunca (which means ’no’ or ’never’) to negate the verb that will not or will never happen in the future respectively. This manner of negating the predicate always happens in the verb–subject–object or verb–object–subject sentence structure:

Present Tense

:Hindê ta comprá (verb) el maga/mana negociante (subject) con el tierra (object).
:Hindê ta comprá (verb) tierra (object) el maga/mana negociante (subject).
::(Eng: The businessmen are not buying land. Span: Los hombres de negocios no están comprando tierras)

Past Tense

:No hay comprá (verb) el maga/mana negociante (subject) con el tierra (object).
:No hay comprá (verb) tierra (object) el maga/mana negociante (subject).
::(Eng: The businessmen did not buy land. Span: Los hombres de negocios no compraron tierras)

Future Tense

:Ay hindê comprá (verb) el maga/mana negociante (subject) con el tierra (object).
:Ay hindê comprá (verb) tierra (object) el maga/mana negociante (subject).
::(Eng: The businessmen will not buy land. Span: Los hombres de negocios no comprarán tierras)
:Nunca ay/Ay nunca comprá (verb) el maga/mana negociante (subject) con el tierra (object).
:Nunca ay/Ay nunca comprá (verb) tierra (object) el maga/mana negociante (subject).
::(Eng: The businessmen will never buy land. Span: Los hombres de negocios nunca comprarán tierras)

The negator hindê can appear before the subject in a subject–verb–object structure to negate the subject rather than the predicate in the present, past, and future tenses:

Present Tense

:Hindê el maga/mana negociante (subject) ta comprá (verb) con el tierra (object) sino el maga/mana empleados.
::(Eng: It is not the businessmen who are buying land but the employees. Span: No son los hombres de negocios los que están comprando tierras, sino los empleados)

Past Tense

:Hindê el maga/mana negociante (subject) ya comprá (verb) con el tierra (object) sino el maga/mana empleados.
::(Eng: It was not the businessmen who bought the land but the employees. Span: No fueron los hombres de negocio los que compraron tierras, sino los empleados)

Future Tense

:Hindê el maga/mana negociante (subject) ay comprá (verb) con el tierra (object) sino el maga/mana empleados.
:Ay hindê comprá (verb) el maga/mana negociante(s) (subject) con el tierra (object) sino el maga/mana empleados.
::(Eng: It will not be the businessmen who will buy land but the employees. Span: No serán los hombres de negocios los que compren tierras, sino los empleados)

The negator nunca can appear before the subject in a subject–verb–object structure to strongly negate (or denote impossibility) the subject rather than the predicate in the future tense:

Future Tense

:Nunca el maga/mana negociante (subject) ay comprá (verb) con el tierra (object) sino el maga/mana empleados.
:Nunca ay comprá (verb) el mana/maga negociante (subject) con el tierra (object) sino el maga/mana empleados.
::(Eng: It will never be the businessmen who will buy land but the employees. Span: Nunca serán los hombres de negocios los que compren tierras, sino los empleados)

The negator no hay and nunca can also appear before the subject to negate the predicate in a subject–verb–object structure in the past and future tenses respectively. Using nunca before the subject to negate the predicate in a subject–verb–object structure denotes strong negation or impossibility for the subject to perform the action in the future:

Past Tense

:No hay el maga/mana negociante (subject) comprá (verb) con el tierra (object).
::(Eng: The businessmen did not buy land. Span: Los hombres de negocios no compraron tierras)

Future Tense

:Nunca el maga/mana negociante (subject) ay comprá (verb) con el tierra (object).
::(Eng: The businessmen will never buy land. Span: Los hombres de negocios nunca comprarán tierras)

===Nouns and articles===

The Chavacano definite article el precedes a singular noun or a plural marker (for a plural noun). The indefinite article un stays constant for gender as &#x27;una&#x27; has almost completely disappeared in Chavacano, except for some phrases like &quot;una vez&quot;. It also stays constant for number as for singular nouns. In Chavacano, it is quite common for el and un to appear together before a singular noun, the former to denote certainty and the latter to denote number:

:el cajón (’the box’) – el maga/mana cajón(es) (’the boxes’)
:un soltero (’a bachelor’) – un soltera (’a spinster’)
:el un soltero (’the bachelor’) – el un soltera (’the spinster’)

Nouns in Chavacano are not always preceded by articles. Without an article, a noun is a generic reference:

:Hindê yo ta llorá lagrimas sino sangre.
::(’I do not cry tears but blood’.)
:Ta cargá yo palo.
::(’I am carrying wood’).

Proper names of persons are preceded by the definite article si or the phrase un tal functioning as an indefinite article would:

:Un bonita candidata si Maria..
::(’Maria is a beautiful candidate’.)
:un tal Juancho
::(’a certain Juancho’)

====Singular nouns====

Unlike in Spanish, Chavacano nouns derived from Spanish do not follow gender rules in general. In Zamboangueño, the article &#x27;el&#x27; basically precedes every singular noun. However, this rule is not rigid (especially in Zamboangueño) because the formal vocabulary mode wherein Spanish words predominate almost always is the preferred mode especially in writing. The Spanish article &#x27;la&#x27; for feminine singular nouns does exist in Chavacano, though it occurs rarely and mostly in the formal medium of writing, such as poems and lyrics. When accompanying a Spanish feminine noun, the &#x27;la&#x27; as the article is more tolerated than acceptable. Among the few exceptions where the &#x27;la&#x27; occurs is as a formal prefix when addressing the Blessed Virgin Mary, perhaps more as an emphasis of her importance in Christian devotion. But the real article is still the &#x27;el&#x27;, which makes this use of a &quot;double article&quot; quite unique. Thus it is common to hear the Blessed Virgin addressed in Chavacano as &#x27;el La Virgen Maria&#x27; (the &quot;L&quot; of the &#x27;la&#x27; capitalized to signify its permanent position within the noun compound). In general, though, when in doubt, the article &#x27;el&#x27; is always safe to use. Compare:

And just like Spanish, Chavacano nouns can have gender but only when referring to persons. However, they are always masculine in the sense (Spanish context) that they are generally preceded by the article &#x27;el&#x27;. Places and things are almost always masculine. The -o is dropped in masculine nouns and -a is added to make the noun feminine:

Not all nouns referring to persons can become feminine nouns. In Chavacano, some names of persons are masculine (because of the preceding article &#x27;el&#x27; in Spanish context) but do not end in -o.

:Examples: el alcalde, el capitan, el negociante, el ayudante, el chufer

All names of animals are always masculine—in Spanish context—preceded by the article &#x27;el&#x27;.

:Examples: el gato (gata is uncommon), el puerco (puerca is uncommon), el perro (perra is uncommon)

Names of places and things can be either masculine or feminine, but they are considered masculine in the Spanish context because the article &#x27;el&#x27; always precedes the noun:

:el cocina, el pantalón, el comida, el camino, el trapo, el ventana, el mar

====Plural nouns====

In Chavacano, plural nouns (whether masculine or feminine in Spanish context) are preceded by the retained singular masculine Spanish article &#x27;el&#x27;. The Spanish articles &#x27;los&#x27; and &#x27;las&#x27; have almost disappeared. They have been replaced by the modifier (a plural marker) &#x27;maga/mana&#x27; which precedes the singular form of the noun. Maga comes from the native Hiligaynon &#x27;maga&#x27; or the Tagalog &#x27;mga&#x27;. The formation of the Chavacano plural form of the noun (el + maga/mana + singular noun form) applies whether in common, familiar or formal mode. It may be thought of as roughly equivalent to saying in English, &quot;the many (noun)&quot; instead of &quot;the (noun)s&quot;, and in fact &quot;the many (noun)s&quot; is used more in Philippine English than elsewhere.

There are some Chavacano speakers (especially older Caviteño or Zamboangueño speakers) who would tend to say &#x27;mana&#x27; for &#x27;maga&#x27;. &#x27;Mana&#x27; is accepted and quite common, especially among older speakers, but when in doubt, the modifier &#x27;maga&#x27; to pluralize nouns is safer to use.

Again, this rule is not rigid (especially in the Zamboangueño formal mode). The articles &#x27;los&#x27; or &#x27;las&#x27; do exist sometimes before nouns that are pluralized in the Spanish manner, and their use is quite accepted:

:los caballeros, los dias, las noches, los chavacanos, los santos, las mañanas, las almujadas, las mesas, las plumas, las cosas

When in doubt, it is always safe to use &#x27;el&#x27; and &#x27;maga or mana&#x27; to pluralize singular nouns:

:el maga/mana caballero(s), el maga/mana día(s), el maga/mana noche(s), el maga/mana chavacano(s), el maga/mana santo(s), el maga/mana día(s) que viene (this is a phrase; &#x27;el maga/mana mañana&#x27; is uncommon), el maga/mana almujada(s), el maga/mana mesa(s), el maga/mana pluma(s)

In Chavacano, it is common for some nouns to become doubled when pluralized (called &quot;Reduplication&quot;, a characteristic of the Malayo-Polynesian family of languages):

:el maga cosa-cosa (el maga cosa/s is common), el maga casa casa (el maga casa is common), el maga gente gente (el maga gente is common), el maga juego juego (el maga juego is common)

But note that in some cases, this &quot;reduplication&quot; signifies a difference in meaning. For example, &#x27;el maga bata&#x27; means &#x27;the children&#x27; but &#x27;el maga bata-bata&#x27; means one&#x27;s followers or subordinates, as is a gang or mob.

In general, the suffixes -s, -as, -os to pluralize nouns in Spanish have also almost disappeared in Chavacano. However, the formation of plural nouns with suffixes ending in -s, -as, and -os are accepted. Basically, the singular form of the noun is retained, and it becomes plural because of the preceding modifier/plural marker &#x27;maga&#x27; or &#x27;mana&#x27;:

:el maga/mana caballeros (accepted)
:el maga/mana caballero (correct)
:el maga/mana días (accepted)
:el maga/mana día (correct)

Adding the suffix -es to some nouns is quite common and accepted. Nouns ending in -cion can also be pluralized by adding the suffix -es:

:el maga meses, el maga mujeres, el maga mayores, el maga tentaciones, el maga contestaciones, el maga naciones, el maga organizaciones

However, it is safer to use the general rule (when in doubt) of retaining the singular form of the noun preceded by the modifier/plural marker &#x27;maga&#x27; or &#x27;mana&#x27;:

:el maga mes, el maga mujer, el maga mayor, el maga tentación, el maga contestación, el maga nación, el maga organización

===Pronouns===

Chavacano pronouns are based on Spanish and native sources; many of the pronouns are not used in either but may be derived in part.

In contrast to the other varieties of Chavacano, the variety spoken in Zamboanga uses more pronouns derived from a native Philippine language (I.e. Hiligaynon) in addition to Spanish. In Zamboangueño, there are three different levels of usage for certain pronouns depending on the level of familiarity between the speaker and the addressee, the status of both in family and society, or the mood of the speaker and addressee at the particular moment: &quot;common&quot;, &quot;familiar&quot;, and &quot;formal&quot;. The common forms are, particularly in the second and third person plural, derived from Cebuano while most familiar and formal forms are from Spanish. The &quot;common forms&quot; are used to address a person below or of equal social or family status or to someone is who is acquainted. The common forms are used to regard no formality or courtesy in conversation. Its use can also mean rudeness, impoliteness or offensiveness. The &quot;familiar forms&quot; are used to address someone of equal social or family status. It indicates courteousness, and is commonly used in public conversations, the broadcast media, and in education. The &quot;formal forms&quot; are used to address someone older and/or higher in social or family status. It is the form used in writing.

Additionally, Zamboangueño is the only variety of Chavacano which distinguishes between the inclusive we (&quot;kita&quot;) – including the person spoken to (the addressee) – and the exclusive we (&quot;kame&quot;) – excluding the person spoken to (the addressee) – in the first person plural except in the formal form where &quot;nosotros&quot; is used for both.

====Personal (nominative/subjective case) pronouns====

Below is a table comparing the personal pronouns in three varieties of Chavacano.

====Possessive pronouns (Zamboangueño Chavacano, Castellano Abakay)====

The usage modes also exist in the possessive pronouns especially in Zamboangueño. &quot;Amon&quot;, &quot;aton&quot;, &quot;ila&quot; and &quot;inyo&quot; are obviously of Hiligaynon but not Cebuano origins, and when used as pronouns, they are of either the common or familiar mode. The inclusive and exclusive characteristics peculiar to Zamboangueño appear again in the 1st person plural. Below is a table of the possessive pronouns in the Chavacano de Zamboanga:

===Verbs===

In Zamboangueño, Chavacano verbs are mostly Spanish in origin. In contrast with the other varieties, there is rarely a Zamboangueño verb that is based on or has its origin from other Philippine languages. Hence, verbs contribute much of the Spanish vocabulary in Chavacano de Zamboanga.

Generally, the simple form of the Zamboangueño verb is based upon the infinitive of the Spanish verb, minus the final /r/. For example, &quot;continuar&quot;, &quot;hablar&quot;, &quot;poner&quot;, &quot;recibir&quot;, and &quot;llevar&quot; become &quot;continuá&quot;, &quot;hablá&quot;, &quot;poné&quot;, &quot;recibí&quot;, and &quot;llevá&quot; with the accent called &quot;acento agudo&quot; on the final syllable.

There are some rare exceptions. Some verbs are not derived from infinitives but from words that are technically Spanish phrases or from other Spanish verbs. For example, &quot;dar&quot; (give) does not become &#x27;da&#x27; but &quot;dale&quot; (give) (literally in Spanish, to &quot;give it&quot; [verb phrase]). In this case, &quot;dale&quot; has nothing to do with the Spanish infinitive &quot;dar&quot;. The Chavacano &quot;brinca&quot; (to hop) is from Spanish &quot;brincar&quot; which means the same thing.

====Verb tenses – simple tenses====

Chavacano of Zamboangueño uses the words &quot;ya&quot; (from Spanish &quot;ya&quot; [already]), &quot;ta&quot; (from Spanish &quot;está&quot; [is]), and &quot;ay&quot; plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of past, present, and future respectively:

Caviteño uses the words &quot;ya&quot;, &quot;ta&quot;, and &quot;di&quot; plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of past, present, and future respectively:

While Bahra uses the words &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ta&quot;, and &quot;di&quot; plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of past, present, and future respectively:
Unlike in the Zamboangueño, Caviteño, and Bahra, Castellano Abakay (Davaoeño) doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;ya&quot; and &quot;ta&quot; prefix. The infinitives and their conjugations are somehow retained, and there are some that have simplified conjugations:
=====Perfect constructions=====

In Zamboangueño, there are three ways to express that the verb is in the present perfect. First, &quot;ya&quot; can appear both before and after the main verb to express that in the present perspective, the action has already been completed somewhere in the past with the accent falling on the final &quot;ya&quot;. Second, &quot;ta&quot; and &quot;ya&quot; can appear before and after the verb respectively to express that the action was expected to happen in the past (but did not happen), is still expected to happen in the present, and actually the expectation has been met (the verb occurs in the present). And third, a verb between &quot;ta&quot; and &quot;pa&quot; means an action started in the past and still continues in the present:

The past perfect exists in Zamboangueño. The words &quot;antes&quot; (before) and &quot;despues&quot; (after) can be used between two sentences in the simple past form to show which verb came first. The words &quot;antes&quot; (before) and &quot;despues&quot; (after) can also be used between a sentence in the present perfect using &quot;ya&quot; + verb + &quot;ya&quot; and another sentence in the simple past tense:

Zamboangueño Chavacano uses a verb between &quot;hay&quot; and &quot;ya&quot; to denote the future perfect and past perfect respectively:

Zamboangueño Chavacano also uses a verb between &quot;ta&quot; and &quot;ya&quot; to denote the present perfect:

====Passive and active voice====

To form the Zamboangueño Chavacano active voice, Zamboangueños follow the pattern:

El maga soldao ya mata con el criminal
The soldiers killed the criminal.

As illustrated above, active (causative) voice is formed by placing the doer &quot;el maga soldao&quot; before the verb phrase &quot;ya mata&quot; and then the object &quot;el criminal&quot; as indicated by the particle &quot;con&quot;

Traditionally, Zamboangueño does not have a passive construction of its own.

==Archaic Spanish words and false friends==

Chabacano has preserved plenty of archaic Spanish phrases and words in its vocabulary that modern Spanish no longer uses; for example:

:&quot;En denantes&quot; which means &#x27;a while ago&#x27; (Spanish: &quot;hace un tiempo&quot;). Take note that &quot;En denantes&quot; is an archaic Spanish phrase. Modern Spanish would express the phrase as &quot;hace poco tiempo&quot; or &quot;hace un tiempo&quot;, but Chabacano still retains this archaic Spanish phrase and many other archaic Spanish words. This word is still being used in some areas of southern Spain.

:&quot;Masquen&quot;/&quot;Masquin&quot; means &#x27;even (if)&#x27; or &#x27;although&#x27;. In Spanish, &quot;mas que&quot; is a somewhat out of fashion Spanish phrase meaning &#x27;although&#x27;, nowadays replaced by the Spanish word &quot;aunque&quot; most of the time.

:In Chavacano, the Spanish language is commonly called &quot;castellano&quot;. Chavacano speakers, especially older Zamboangueños, call the language as &quot;castellano&quot; implying the original notion as the language of Castille while &quot;español&quot; is used to mean a Spaniard or a person from Spain.

:The pronoun &quot;vos&quot; is alive in Chavacano. While &quot;vos&quot; was used in the highest form of respect before the 16th century in classical Spanish and is quite archaic nowadays in modern Spanish (much like the English &quot;thou&quot;), in Chavacano it is used at the common level of usage (lower than tu, which is used at the familiar level) in the same manner of the works of Miguel de Cervantes and in the same manner as in certain Latin American countries such as Argentina (informally and in contrast with usted, which is used formally). Chavacano followed the development of vos in same manner as in Latin America – (the voseo) or, incidentally, as with English &quot;thou&quot; vs. &quot;you&quot;.

:&quot;Ansina&quot; means &#x27;like that&#x27; or &#x27;that way&#x27;. In modern Spanish, &quot;así&quot; is the evolved form of this archaic word. The word &quot;ansina&quot; can still be heard among the aged in Mexico and is the only way of expressing this meaning in Ladino.

On the other hand, some words from the language spoken in Spain have evolved or have acquired totally different meanings in Chavacano. Hence, for Castillian speakers who would encounter Chavacano speakers, some words familiar to them have become false friends. Some examples of false friends are:

:&quot;Siguro&quot;/&quot;Seguro&quot; means &#x27;maybe&#x27;. In Spanish, &quot;seguro&quot; means &#x27;sure&#x27;, &#x27;secure&#x27;, or &#x27;stable&#x27;, although it could imply probability as well, as in the phrase, &quot;Seguramente vendrá&quot; (Probably he will come).

:&quot;Siempre&quot; means &#x27;of course&#x27;. In Spanish, &quot;siempre&quot; means &#x27;always&#x27;.

:&quot;Firmi&quot; means &#x27;always&#x27;. In Spanish, &quot;firme&quot; means &#x27;firm&#x27; or &#x27;steady&#x27;.

<doc id="639401" wikidata="Q1079369" url="?curid=639401" title="CONFIG.SYS">
<text>CONFIG.SYS is the primary configuration file for the DOS and OS/2 operating systems. It is a special ASCII text file that contains user-accessible setup or configuration directives evaluated by the operating system&#x27;s DOS BIOS (typically residing in IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS) during boot. CONFIG.SYS was introduced with DOS 2.0.

== Usage ==
The directives in this file configure DOS for use with devices and applications in the system. The CONFIG.SYS directives also set up the memory managers in the system. After processing the CONFIG.SYS file, DOS proceeds to load and execute the command shell specified in the SHELL line of CONFIG.SYS, or COMMAND.COM if there is no such line. The command shell in turn is responsible for processing the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

CONFIG.SYS is composed mostly of name=value directives which look like variable assignments. In fact, these will either define some tunable parameters often resulting in reservation of memory, or load files, mostly device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs), into memory.

In DOS, CONFIG.SYS is located in the root directory of the drive from which the system was booted.

The filename is also used by (DCP), an MS-DOS derivative by the former East-German VEB Robotron.

Some versions of DOS will probe for alternative filenames taking precedence over the default CONFIG.SYS filename if they exist:

While older versions of Concurrent DOS 3.2 to 4.1 did not support CONFIG.SYS files at all, later versions of Concurrent DOS 386 and Concurrent DOS XM, as well as Multiuser DOS, System Manager and REAL/32 will probe for CCONFIG.SYS (with &quot;C&quot; derived from &quot;Concurrent&quot;) instead of CONFIG.SYS. Some versions of Multiuser DOS use a filename of CCONFIG.INI instead, whereas REAL/32 is known to look for MCONFIG.SYS. These operating systems support many additional and different configuration settings (like INIT_INSTALL) not known under MS-DOS/PC DOS, but they are stored in the binary repository named CCONFIG.BIN rather than in CCONFIG.INI. Both files are typically modified through a configuration utility named CONFIG.EXE only.

Under DR DOS 3.31, PalmDOS 1.0, Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01, and DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, a file named DCONFIG.SYS (with &quot;D&quot; derived from &quot;DR DOS&quot;), if present, will take precedence over CONFIG.SYS. Since DR DOS 6.0 this was used in conjunction with disk compression software, where the original boot drive C: would become drive D: after loading the compression driver (and the &quot;D&quot; in the file name came in handy as well), but it is commonly used to help maintain multiple configuration files in multi-boot scenarios.
In addition to this, OpenDOS 7.01 and DR-OpenDOS 7.02 will look for a file named ODCONFIG.SYS, whereas some issues of DR-DOS 7.02 and higher will instead also look for DRCONFIG.SYS.
Further, under DR DOS 6.0 and higher, the codice_1 command can be used to change the default file extensions. For example, with codice_2 the written Volume Boot Record would look for a renamed and modified IBMBIO.703 system file (instead of the default IBMBIO.COM) and the IBMBIO.703 would look for IBMDOS.703 and [D]CONFIG.703 (instead of IBMDOS.COM and [D]CONFIG.SYS), so that multiple parallel sets of files can coexist in the same root directory and be selected via a boot-loader like LOADER, supplied with Multiuser DOS and DR-DOS 7.02/7.03. The SHELL directive is enhanced to provide means to specify alternative AUTOEXEC.BAT files via /P[:filename.ext] and in this specific scenario, COMMAND.COM will accept file extensions other than &quot;codice_3&quot; as well (both features are also supported by 4DOS). Under DR DOS 6.0 and higher, the CONFIG.SYS directive CHAIN=filespec can be used to continue processing in the named file, which does not necessarily need to reside in the root directory of the boot drive. DR-DOS 7.02 and higher optionally support an additional parameter as in CHAIN=filespec,label to jump to a specific :label in the given file.
DR-DOS 7.03 and higher support a new codice_4 parameter in order to copy the corresponding CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files along with the system files.

FreeDOS implements a similar feature with its FDCONFIG.SYS configuration file. RxDOS 7.24 and higher use RXCONFIG.SYS instead. PTS-DOS uses CONFIG.PTS.

Both CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT can be found included in the root folder of Windows 95, and Windows 98 boot drives, as they are based on DOS. Typically, these files are left empty, with no content.

Windows Me does not even parse the CONFIG.SYS file during the Windows boot process, loading environment variables from the Windows Registry instead:
: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\Environment

Under FlexOS, CONFIG.SYS is a binary file defining the resource managers and device drivers loaded.

== Example ==

An example CONFIG.SYS for MS-DOS 5:

DOS=HIGH,UMB
DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM
DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS
FILES=30

== Issues ==
The system can still boot if this file is missing or corrupted. However, this file, along with AUTOEXEC.BAT, is essential for the complete bootup process to occur with the DOS operating system. These files contain information that is used to customize the operating system for personal use. They also contain the requirements of different software application packages. A DOS system would require troubleshooting if either of these files became damaged or corrupted.

If CONFIG.SYS does not contain a SHELL directive (or the file is corrupt or missing), DOS typically searches for COMMAND.COM in the root directory of the boot drive. If this is not found, versions of DOS before 6.0 will not start up. MS-DOS 6.0/PC DOS 6.1 and Novell DOS 7 and higher will instead display a prompt to enter the path and filename of a command processor. This recovery prompt is also displayed when the primary command processor is aborted due to faults or if it is exited deliberately. (In the case of COMMAND.COM, the internal codice_7 command is disabled only when the shell was started with codice_8.) This also provides limited means to replace the shell at runtime without having to reboot the system.
Since the MS-DOS 7.0 and higher COMMAND.COM executable is incompatible with DR-DOS, but typically resides in the root of drive C: in dual-boot scenarios with DR-DOS, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher no longer allow to bypass SHELL directives in (+)// &quot;skip&quot;/&quot;trace&quot;/&quot;step&quot; modes. (Some later issues added (+) to reinvoke the former &quot;skip&quot; behaviour in order to allow recovery from problems with invalid SHELL arguments as well.) Also, if no SHELL directive could be found when skipping CONFIG.SYS processing via (+) (and also with (+)/, when the default file extension has been changed with codice_9), the user is prompted to enter a valid shell file name &quot;before&quot; trying to load COMMAND.COM from the root. Pressing without specifying a file will assume the former default.

Depending on the version, the size of the CONFIG.SYS file is limited to a few kilobytes under MS-DOS/PC DOS (up to 64 KB in most recent versions), whereas the file&#x27;s size is unlimited under DR-DOS. This is because the former operating systems (since DOS 3.0) will compile the file into some tokenized in-memory representation before they sort and regroup the directives to be processed in a specific order (with device drivers always being loaded before TSRs), whereas DR-DOS interprets the file and executes most directives line-by-line, thereby giving full control over the load order of drivers and TSRs via DEVICE and INSTALL (for example to solve load order conflicts or to load a program debugger before a device driver to be debugged) and allowing to adapt the user interaction and change the flow through the file based on conditions like processor types installed, any type of keys pressed, load or input errors occurring, or return codes given by loaded software. This becomes particularly useful since INSTALL can also be used to run non-resident software under DR-DOS, so that temporary external programs can be integrated into the CONFIG.SYS control flow.

In MS-DOS/PC DOS 2.0 through 4.01, the length of the SHELL line was limited to 31 characters, whereas up to 128 characters are possible in later versions. DR-DOS even accepts up to 255 characters. CONFIG.SYS directives do not accept long filenames.

== Dual booting DOS and Windows 9x ==
When installing Windows 95 over a preexisting DOS/Windows install, CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT are renamed to CONFIG.DOS and AUTOEXEC.DOS. This is intended to ease dual booting between Windows 9x and DOS. When booting into DOS, they are temporarily renamed CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. Backups of the Windows 95 versions are made as CONFIG.W40 and AUTOEXEC.W40 files.

When Caldera DR-DOS 7.02/7.03 is installed on a system already containing Windows 95, Windows&#x27; CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT retain those names. DR-DOS&#x27; startup files are installed as DCONFIG.SYS (a name already used in earlier versions of DR DOS) and AUTODOS7.BAT.

== OS/2 / Windows NT ==
OS/2 uses the CONFIG.SYS file extensively for setting up its configuration, drivers and environment before the graphical part of the system loads.

In the OS/2 subsystem of Windows NT, what appeared as CONFIG.SYS to OS/2 programs was actually stored in the registry.

There are many undocumented or poorly documented CONFIG.SYS directives used by OS/2.

CONFIG.SYS continues to be used by the OS/2 derivatives eComStation and ArcaOS.

<text>The districts of Pakistan () are the third-level administrative divisions of Pakistan, below provinces and divisions, but forming the first-tier of local government. In total, there are 166 districts in Pakistan, including the Capital Territory, and the districts of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. These districts are further divided into &quot;tehsils and union councils&quot;.

==History==
In 1947, when Pakistan gained independence there were 124 districts. In 1969, 2 new districts (Tangail and Patuakhali) in East Pakistan were formed, bringing the total to 126. With the Independence of Bangladesh, Pakistan lost 20 of its districts and so there were 106 districts. In 2001, the number was reduced to 102 by the merger of the 5 districts of Karachi Central, Karachi East, Karachi South, Karachi West and Malir to form Karachi District. The number of districts rose to 106 again in December 2004, when four new districts were created in the province of Sindh of which one (Umerkot) had existed until 2000 and three districts (Kashmore, Qambar and Jamshoro) were newly created. The new districts were carved out of Mirpur Khas, Jacobabad, Larkana and Dadu Districts respectively. In May 2005, the Punjab provincial government created a new district by raising the status of Nankana Sahib from a tehsil of Sheikhupura District to a district in its own right. On 11 July 2011, the Sindh Government restored again the districts of Karachi South, Karachi East, Malir, Karachi West and Karachi Central, then later in 2013, the district of Korangi was carved out of Karachi East District. In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a second-tier of government was formed from three administrative divisions into ten districts. In Gilgit–Baltistan, there are ten districts divided between the two regions of Gilgit and Baltistan. In 2018, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and FATA agencies were converted into districts.

Chagai is the largest district of Pakistan by area while Lahore District is the largest by population with a total population of 11,126,285 at the 2017 census. Quetta is the largest district of Balochistan by population with a total population of 2,275,699 at the 2017 census. Bahawalpur is the largest district of Punjab by area. Chitral is the largest by area and Peshawar is the largest by population from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with the population of 4,269,079 at the Census 2017. Sindh&#x27;s largest district by area is Tharparkar and by population its Karachi West with a population of 3,914,757 at the 2017 Census. The combined population of the six districts of Karachi division is over 16 million at the 2017 census, giving an average population for these six districts of Karachi division of over 2.675 million each. Neelum and Kotli are the largest districts of Azad Kashmir by area and population respectively. Gilgit is the largest by area and population both for Gilgit-Baltistan.

==Administration==
===Deputy commissioner===
A deputy commissioner (popularly abbreviated to &quot;DC&quot;) is the executive head of the district. Deputy commissioners are appointed by the government from the Pakistan Administrative Service.

===District council===
A district council (or &quot;zila council&quot;) is a local government body at the district level.

The functions of a district council include construction and maintenance of roads, and bridges, building hospitals and dispensaries, schools and educational institutions, health facilities and sanitation, tube wells for drinking water, rest houses, and coordination of activities of the Union &quot;councils&quot; within the district.

<text>Seeadler Harbor, also known as Port Seeadler, is located on Manus Island, Admiralty Islands, Papua New Guinea and played an important role in World War II. In German, &quot;Seeadler&quot; means sea eagle, pointing to German colonial activity between 1884 and 1919 in that area. The bay was named in 1900 after the German cruiser SMS &quot;Seeadler&quot;.

==History==
On 29 February 1944, General Douglas MacArthur led Operation Brewer to take the islands from the Japanese who had occupied them beginning in 1942. The islands were secured by the Americans on 19 March 1944, who then built a large base at Seeadler Harbor including wharves and an airbase, Manus Naval Base. This US Naval Advance Base served as a staging area for further World War II operations in New Guinea and the Philippines.

 exploded accidentally while moored in Seeadler Harbor on 10 November 1944. The ship was carrying ammunition and the tremendous explosion caused 432 fatalities, 371 wounded, damage to surrounding ships and base from debris and sinking or severely damaging 22 smaller craft.

A Japanese Mitsubishi A6M reconnaissance aircraft reported &quot;two large aircraft carriers&quot; at Seeadler Harbor on 22 April 1945, which were actually the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Large Auxiliary Floating Dry Docks USS ABSD-2 and USS ABSD-4. Two Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers attacked the floating drydocks five nights later. Both were hit but received only moderate damage to a single pontoon each.

The wrecks of the sections of large auxiliary floating drydock USS ABSD-4 and an Imperial Japanese ship amongst others are located within the harbor.

<text>Spinal anaesthesia (or spinal anesthesia), also called spinal block, subarachnoid block, intradural block and intrathecal block, is a form of neuraxial regional anaesthesia involving the injection of a local anaesthetic or opioid into the subarachnoid space, generally through a fine needle, usually long. It is a safe and effective form of anesthesia usually performed by anesthesiologists that can be used as an alternative to general anesthesia commonly in surgeries involving the lower extremities and surgeries below the umbilicus. The local anesthetic with or without an opioid injected into the cerebrospinal fluid provides locoregional anaesthesia: true anaesthesia, motor, sensory and autonomic (sympathetic) blockade.
Administering analgesics (opioid, alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist) in the cerebrospinal fluid without a local anaesthetic produces locoregional analgesia: markedly reduced pain sensation (incomplete analgesia), some autonomic blockade (parasympathetic plexi), but no sensory or motor block.
Locoregional analgesia, due to mainly the absence of motor and sympathetic block may be preferred over locoregional anaesthesia in some postoperative care settings.
The tip of the spinal needle has a point or small bevel. Recently, pencil point needles have been made available (Whitacre, Sprotte, Gertie Marx and others).

==Indications==
Spinal anaesthesia is a commonly used technique, either on its own or in combination with sedation or general anaesthesia. It is most commonly used for surgeries below the umbilicus, however recently its uses have extended to some surgeries above the umbilicus as well as for postoperative analgesia. Procedures which use spinal anesthesia include:
* Orthopaedic surgery on the pelvis, hip, femur, knee, tibia, and ankle, including arthroplasty and joint replacement
* Vascular surgery on the legs
* Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair
* Hernia (inguinal or epigastric)
* Haemorrhoidectomy
* Nephrectomy and cystectomy in combination with general anaesthesia
* Transurethral resection of the prostate and transurethral resection of bladder tumours
* Hysterectomy in different techniques used
* Caesarean sections
* Pain management during vaginal birth and delivery
* Urology cases
* Examinations under anaesthesia

Spinal anaesthesia is the technique of choice for Caesarean section as it avoids a general anaesthetic and the risk of failed intubation (which is probably a lot lower than the widely quoted 1 in 250 in pregnant women). It also means the mother is conscious and the partner is able to be present at the birth of the child. The post operative analgesia from intrathecal opioids in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also good.

Spinal anesthesia may be favored when the surgical site is amenable to spinal blockade for patients with severe respiratory disease such as COPD as it avoids the potential respiratory consequences of intubation and ventilation. It may also be useful in patients where anatomical abnormalities may make tracheal intubation relatively difficult.

In pediatric patients, spinal anesthesia is particularly useful in children with difficult airways and those who are poor candidates for endotracheal anesthesia such as increased respiratory risks or presence of full stomach.

This can also be used to effectively treat and prevent pain following surgery, particularly thoracic, abdominal pelvic, and lower extremity orthopedic procedures.

==Contraindications==
Prior to receiving spinal anesthesia, it is important to provide a thorough medical evaluation to ensure there are no absolute contraindications and to minimize risks and complications. Although contraindications are rare, below are some of them:
* Patient refusal
* Local infection or sepsis at the site of injection
* Bleeding disorders, thrombocytopaenia, or systemic anticoagulation (secondary to an increased risk of a spinal epidural hematoma)
* Severe aortic stenosis
* Increased intracranial pressure
* Space occupying lesions of the brain
* Anatomical disorders of the spine such as scoliosis (although where pulmonary function is also impaired, spinal anaesthesia may be favored)
* Hypovolaemia e.g. following massive haemorrhage, including in obstetric patients
* Allergy

Relative Contraindication
* Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, or other disorders causing resistance to local anesthesia

==Risks and complications==
Complications of spinal anesthesia can result from the physiologic effects on the nervous system and can also be related to placement technique. Most of the common side effects are minor and are self-resolving or easily treatable while major complications can result in more serious and permanent neurological damage and rarely death. These symptoms can occur immediately after administration of the anesthetic or be delayed.

Common and minor complications include:
* Mild hypotension
* Bradycardia
* Nausea and vomiting
* Transient neurological symptoms (lower back pain with pain in the legs) 
* Post-dural-puncture headache or post-spinal headache – Associated with the size and type of spinal needle used. A 2020 meta analysis recommended use of the 26G atraumatic spinal needle to lower the risk of PDPH – specifically, the Braun Atraucan 26G needle.

Serious and permanent complications are rare but are usually related to physiologic effects on the cardiovascular system and neurological system or when the injection has been unintentionally at the wrong site. The following are some major complications:
* Nerve injuries: Cauda equina syndrome, radiculopathy
* Cardiac arrest
* Severe hypotension
* Spinal epidural hematoma, with or without subsequent neurological sequelae due to compression of the spinal nerves.
* Epidural abscess
* Infection (e.g. meningitis)

==Technique==
Regardless of the anaesthetic agent (drug) used, the desired effect is to block the transmission of afferent nerve signals from peripheral nociceptors. Sensory signals from the site are blocked, thereby eliminating pain. The degree of neuronal blockade depends on the amount and concentration of local anaesthetic used and the properties of the axon. Thin unmyelinated C-fibres associated with pain are blocked first, while thick, heavily myelinated A-alpha motor neurons are blocked moderately. Heavily myelinated, small preganglionic sympathetic fibers are blocked last. The desired result is total numbness of the area. A pressure sensation is permissible and often occurs due to incomplete blockade of the thicker A-beta mechanoreceptors. This allows surgical procedures to be performed with no painful sensation to the person undergoing the procedure.

Some sedation is sometimes provided to help the patient relax and pass the time during the procedure, but with a successful spinal anaesthetic the surgery can be performed with the patient wide awake.

=== Anatomy ===
In spinal anesthesia, the needle is placed past the dura mater in subarachnoid space and between lumbar vertebrae. In order to reach this space, the needle must pierce through several layers of tissue and ligaments which include the supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, and ligamentum flavum. Because the spinal cord (conus medullaris) is typically at the L1 or L2 level of the spine, the needle should be inserted below this between L3 and L4 space or L4 and L5 space in order to avoid injury to the spinal cord.

=== Positioning ===
Patient positioning is essential to the success of the procedure and can affect how the anesthetic spreads following administration. There are three different positions which are used: sitting, lateral decubitus, and prone. The sitting and lateral decubitus positions are the most common.

Sitting – The patient sits upright at the edge of the exam table with their back facing the provider and their legs hanging off the end of the table and feet resting on a stool. Patients should roll their shoulders and upper back forward.

Lateral decubitus – In this position, the patient lies on their side with their back at the edge of the bed and facing the provider. The patient should curl their shoulder and legs and arch out their lower back.

Prone – The patient is positioned face down and their back facing upwards in a jackknife position.

=== Limitations ===
Spinal anaesthetics are typically limited to procedures involving most structures below the upper abdomen. To administer a spinal anaesthetic to higher levels may affect the ability to breathe by paralysing the intercostal respiratory muscles, or even the diaphragm in extreme cases (called a &quot;high spinal&quot;, or a &quot;total spinal&quot;, with which consciousness is lost), as well as the body&#x27;s ability to control the heart rate via the cardiac accelerator fibres. Also, injection of spinal anaesthesia higher than the level of L1 can cause damage to the spinal cord, and is therefore usually not done.

===Differences with epidural anaesthesia===

Epidural anaesthesia is a technique whereby a local anaesthetic drug is injected through a catheter placed into the epidural space. This technique is similar to spinal anaesthesia as both are neuraxial, and the two techniques may be easily confused with each other. Differences include:
* A spinal anaesthetic delivers drug to the subarachnoid space and into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), allowing it to act on the spinal cord directly. An epidural delivers drugs outside the dura (outside CSF), and has its main effect on nerve roots leaving the dura at the level of the epidural, rather than on the spinal cord itself.
* A spinal gives profound block of all motor and sensory function below the level of injection, whereas an epidural blocks a &#x27;band&#x27; of nerve roots around the site of injection, with normal function above, and close-to-normal function below the levels blocked.
* The injected dose for an epidural is larger, being about 10–20 mL compared to 1.5–3.5 mL in a spinal.
* In an epidural, an indwelling catheter may be placed that allows for redosing injections, while a spinal is almost always a one-shot only. Therefore, spinal anaesthesia is more often used for shorter procedures relative to procedures which require epidural anaesthesia.
* The onset of analgesia is approximately 25–30 minutes in an epidural, while it is approximately 5 minutes in a spinal.
* An epidural often does not cause as significant a neuromuscular block as a spinal, unless specific local anaesthetics are also used which block motor fibres as readily as sensory nerve fibres.
* An epidural may be given at a cervical, thoracic, or lumbar site, while a spinal must be injected below L2 to avoid piercing the spinal cord.

===Injected substances===
Bupivacaine (Marcaine) is the local anaesthetic most commonly used, although lidocaine (lignocaine), tetracaine, procaine, ropivacaine, levobupivicaine, prilocaine, or cinchocaine may also be used. Commonly opioids are added to improve the block and provide post-operative pain relief, examples include morphine, fentanyl, diamorphine, and buprenorphine. Non-opioids like clonidine or epinephrine may also be added to prolong the duration of analgesia (although Clonidine may cause hypotension). In the United Kingdom, since 2004 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section is supplemented with intrathecal diamorphine and this combination is now the modal form of anaesthesia for this indication in that country. In the United States, morphine is used for cesareans for the same purpose since diamorphine (heroin) is not used in clinical practice in the US.

Baricity refers to the density of a substance compared to the density of human cerebrospinal fluid. Baricity is used in anaesthesia to determine the manner in which a particular drug will spread in the intrathecal space. Usually, the hyperbaric, (for example, hyperbaric bupivacaine) is chosen, as its spread can be effectively and predictably controlled by the Anaesthesiologist, by tilting the patient. Hyperbaric solutions are made more dense by adding glucose to the mixture.

Baricity is one factor that determines the spread of a spinal anaesthetic but the effect of adding a solute to a solvent, i.e. solvation or dissolution, also has an effect on the spread of the spinal anaesthetic. In tetracaine spinal anaesthesia, it was discovered that the rate of onset of analgesia was faster and the maximum level of analgesia was higher with a 10% glucose solution than with a 5% glucose spinal anaesthetic solution. Also, the amount of ephedrine required was less in the patients who received the 5% glucose solution. In another study this time with 0.5% bupivacaine the mean maximum extent of sensory block was significantly higher with 8% glucose (T3.6) than with 0.83% glucose (T7.2) or 0.33% glucose (T9.5). Also the rate of onset of sensory block to T12 was fastest with solutions containing 8% glucose.

==History==
The first spinal analgesia was administered in 1885 by James Leonard Corning (1855–1923), a neurologist in New York. He was experimenting with cocaine on the spinal nerves of a dog when he accidentally pierced the dura mater.

The first planned spinal anaesthesia for surgery on a human was administered by August Bier (1861–1949) on 16 August 1898, in Kiel, when he injected 3 ml of 0.5% cocaine solution into a 34-year-old labourer. After using it on six patients, he and his assistant each injected cocaine into the other&#x27;s spine. They recommended it for surgeries of legs, but gave it up due to the toxicity of cocaine.

<text>Philippa Garrett Fawcett (4 April 1868 – 10 June 1948) was an English mathematician and educator. She was the first woman to obtain the top score in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams. She taught at Newnham College, Cambridge, and at the normal school (teacher training college) in Johannesburg, and she became an administrator for the London County Council.

==Family==
Philippa Garrett Fawcett was born on 4 April 1868, the daughter of the suffragist Millicent Fawcett (née Garrett) and Henry Fawcett MP, Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge and Postmaster General in Gladstone&#x27;s second government. Her aunt was Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, the first English female doctor. When her father died, she and her mother went to live with Millicent&#x27;s sister Agnes Garrett, who had set up an interior design business on Gower Street, Bloomsbury.

==Education==
Philippa Fawcett was educated at Bedford College, London (now Royal Holloway) and Newnham College, Cambridge which had been co-founded by her mother.

In 1890, she became the first woman to obtain the top score in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams. The results were highly publicised, with the top scorers receiving great acclaim. Her score was 13% higher than the second highest, but she did not receive the title of Senior Wrangler (Geoffrey T. Bennett in 1890), as only men were then ranked and women were listed separately. Women had been allowed to take the Tripos since 1880, after Charlotte Angas Scott was unofficially ranked as eighth wrangler. When the women&#x27;s list was announced, Fawcett was described as &quot;above the senior wrangler&quot;. No woman was officially awarded the first position until Ruth Hendry in 1992.

An anonymous poem written in 1890 paying tribute to Fawcett&#x27;s great achievement climaxes with the following two stanzas, mentioning the other respected mathematicians Arthur Cayley and George Salmon:&lt;poem&gt;
Curve and angle let her con and
Parallelopipedon and
Parallelogram
 Few can equal, none can beat her
 At eliminating theta
By the river Cam.

May she increase in knowledge daily
Till the great Professor Cayley
Owns himself surpassed
 Till the great Professor Salmon
 Votes his own achievements gammon
And admires aghast.
&lt;/poem&gt;Coming amidst the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, Fawcett&#x27;s feat gathered worldwide media coverage, spurring much discussion about women&#x27;s capacities and rights. The lead story in the &quot;Telegraph&quot; the following day said:
==Career==

Following Fawcett&#x27;s achievement in the Tripos, she won the Marion Kennedy scholarship at Cambridge through which she conducted research in fluid dynamics. Her published papers include &quot;Note on the Motion of Solids in a Liquid&quot;.
She was appointed a college lecturer in mathematics at Newnham College, a position she held for 10 years. In this capacity, her teaching abilities received considerable praise. One student wrote:

Fawcett left Cambridge in 1902, when she was appointed as a lecturer to train mathematics teachers at the Normal School (teacher training college) in Johannesburg, then in Transvaal Colony, now part of the University of Pretoria, South Africa. She remained there, setting up schools throughout the country, until 1905, when she returned to Britain to take a position in the administration of education for London County Council. At the LCC, in her work developing secondary schools, she attained a high rank. Denied a Cambridge degree by reason of her sex, she was one of the steamboat ladies who travelled to Ireland between 1904 and 1907 to receive an &quot;ad eundem&quot; University of Dublin degree at Trinity College.

Fawcett maintained strong links with Newnham College throughout her life. The Fawcett building (1938) was named in recognition of her contribution to the college, and that of her family. She died in Hendon on 10 June 1948, two months after her 80th birthday, a month after the Grace that allowed women to be awarded the Cambridge BA degree received royal assent (see women&#x27;s education at the University of Cambridge).

== Legacy ==
The Philippa Fawcett Internship Programme is a summer research program at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences in the University of Cambridge. It received its first group of interns in 2020.

On the University of Cambridge&#x27;s West Cambridge site, there exists Philippa Fawcett Drive, alongside roads named after other notable contributors to STEM subjects, such as Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, and J. J. Thomson.

The Philippa Fawcett Teaching College was named for her.

<doc id="639432" wikidata="Q863881" url="?curid=639432" title="Louisville Colonels">
<text>The Louisville Colonels were a Major League Baseball team that played in the American Association (AA) throughout that league&#x27;s ten-year existence from 1882 until 1891. They were known as the Louisville Eclipse from 1882 to 1884, and as the Louisville Colonels from 1885 to 1891; the latter name derived from the historic title of the Kentucky Colonel. After the AA folded in 1891, the Colonels joined the National League and played through the 1899 season.

&quot;Colonels&quot; was also the name of several minor league baseball teams that played in Louisville, Kentucky, in the 20th century.

==American Association==
After spending several years as a well-known semi-pro team, the Eclipse joined the newly founded American Association in 1882. The Eclipse&#x27;s backer, local distiller J. H. Pank, was named vice-president of the AA, and the team was to be run by a consortium led by W. L. Lyons. Their star player, infielder Pete Browning, who had achieved some measure of local fame, remained with the team when they ascended to major league status. The team got off to a good start, finishing in second place, their best finish for several seasons.

Managing partner Lyons resigned in mid-1888, and was succeeded by team secretary Mordecai Davidson. The following season, the team sank to a 27–111 record and a last place finish. As a result, Davidson surrendered control of the team to the AA. The Colonels lost five straight games in two days, including a tripleheader on September 7 and a doubleheader the next day, all against the Baltimore Orioles. With the prohibition of tripleheaders in the early 1920s, this record still stands. The 1889 Colonels were the first team in major league history to lose 100 games in a single season.

In 1890 the team, which had been purchased by Barney Dreyfuss, bounced back with a vengeance. The Colonels won the 1890 pennant in the AA and became the first and only team to rise from the cellar to the pennant in one season. That year the AA was considered only the third-best behind the NL and the Players&#x27; League.

==National League==
In 1892 the American Association dissolved, and the Colonels moved to the National League and played there until 1899. In 1900 Dreyfuss acquired controlling interest of the Pittsburgh Pirates and brought 14 Colonels players with him, including future Hall of Famers Honus Wagner and Fred Clarke, marking the end of the original Colonels organization and Louisville as a Major League Baseball host city. Honus Wager recorded his first Major League hit while playing with Louisville.

==Notable achievements==
In September 1882, Louisville pitchers threw two no-hitters in the span of nine days; Tony Mullane on September 11, followed by Guy Hecker on September 19. Other Louisville pitchers who threw no-hitters were Ben Sanders on August 22, 1892, and Deacon Phillippe, a rookie, on May 25, 1899. Pete Browning hit for the cycle twice for Louisville, on August 8, 1886, and June 7, 1889.

<text>Martin Sixsmith (born 24 September 1954) is a British author and radio/television presenter, primarily working for the BBC. He has also worked as an adviser to the Labour government and to the BBC television comedy series &quot;The Thick of It&quot;. Sixsmith&#x27;s book about Philomena Lee, &quot;The Lost Child of Philomena Lee&quot;, was the basis for the 2013 film &quot;Philomena&quot;, in which Sixsmith is played by Steve Coogan.

==Education==

Sixsmith was born in Warrington. He was educated at The Manchester Grammar School, then at New College, Oxford, Harvard, the Sorbonne University in Paris, and in Saint Petersburg – then called Leningrad – in Russia. He studied Russian and French. He was a Slavics Tutor at Harvard, and wrote his postgraduate thesis about Russian poetry. Between 2002 and 2007 he studied Psychology and Applied Psychology as a mature student at Birkbeck College, University of London, and at London Metropolitan University.

==Career and writings==
Sixsmith joined the BBC in 1980 as a foreign correspondent, reporting from Moscow during the presidencies of Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin and the collapse of the Soviet Union. He also reported from Poland during the Solidarity uprising and was the BBC&#x27;s Washington correspondent during the election and first presidential term of Bill Clinton. He was based in Russia for five years, the US for four, Brussels for four and Poland for three.

Sixsmith left the BBC in 1997 to work for the newly elected government of Tony Blair. He became Director of Communications (a civil service post), working first with Harriet Harman and Frank Field, then with Alistair Darling. His next position was as a Director of GEC plc, where he oversaw the rebranding of the company as Marconi Communications.

In December 2001, he returned to the Civil Service as Director of Communications for the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, where he became embroiled in a scandal over the actions of Jo Moore. Moore was a special adviser to the transport secretary Stephen Byers who had been the subject of much public condemnation for suggesting that a controversial announcement could be &quot;buried&quot; by being made in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Sixsmith incurred the displeasure of Tony Blair when his email advising Byers and Moore not to bury more bad news was leaked to the press. The government tried to force him to resign, but had later to issue an apology and pay him compensation.

Sixsmith was widely expected to write a memoir or autobiography in the wake of his civil service departure. Instead, he produced a novel about near-future politics called &quot;Spin&quot; which was published in 2004, and indirectly led to his employment as an adviser on &quot;The Thick of It&quot;. His second novel, &quot;I Heard Lenin Laugh&quot;, was published in 2005.

In 2006, he was commissioned by BBC Radio 4 to present a series of programmes on Russian poetry, literature and art, &quot;Challenging the Silence.&quot;

In 2007, Sixsmith wrote &quot;The Litvinenko File&quot;, an examination of the feud between the Kremlin and Russia&#x27;s émigré oligarchs.

In 2008 he worked on two BBC documentaries exploring the legacy of the KGB in Russia and also presented a BBC documentary, &quot;The Snowy Streets of St Petersburg&quot;, about artists and writers who fled the former Eastern bloc.

In 2009, &quot;The Lost Child of Philomena Lee&quot; was published, about the forcible separation of Philomena Lee and her son, Michael A. Hess, by the nuns of Sean Ross Abbey, an Irish convent, during the 1950s, and the subsequent attempts of Lee and Hess to contact one another.

In 2010, he wrote &quot;Putin&#x27;s Oil&quot;, about Russia&#x27;s energy wars and their consequences for Moscow and the world.

In 2011, Sixsmith presented &quot;Russia: The Wild East&quot;, a 50-part history of Russia for BBC Radio 4. His book &quot;Russia, a 1,000-Year Chronicle of the Wild East&quot; was published by Random House.

He continued to work as an adviser to the BBC political sitcom, &quot;The Thick of It,&quot; and the Oscar-nominated film, &quot;In the Loop.&quot;

In 2013, &quot;The Lost Child of Philomena Lee&quot; was adapted into the film &quot;Philomena&quot;, directed by Stephen Frears, starring Judi Dench and Steve Coogan (as Sixsmith), and written by Coogan and Jeff Pope. It was nominated for four Oscars.

In 2014, Sixsmith presented a 25-part BBC Radio 4 series about the history of psychology and psychiatry, &quot;In Search of Ourselves&quot;.

In 2015, he made a BBC television documentary, &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Lost Babies&quot;, in which he revisited Philomena&#x27;s story by travelling to the United States to investigate the Irish Catholic Church&#x27;s role in an adoption trade which saw thousands of children taken from their mothers and sent abroad.

His 2017 book, &quot;Ayesha&#x27;s Gift,&quot; is the story of a young woman&#x27;s search to discover the truth about her father, who had been murdered in Pakistan.

In 2019, he published &quot;An Unquiet Heart&quot;, a historical novel based on the life of the Russian poet, Sergei Yesenin, and his stormy love affair with the actress Zinaida Raikh.

His 2021 book, &quot;The War of Nerves,&quot; an account of the Cold War in terms of the psychology of the leaders on both sides, was shortlisted for the PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Non-fiction.

In 2022, Sixsmith co-wrote &quot;The Russia Conundrum: How the West Fell for Putin&#x27;s Power Gambit&quot;, with the former oligarch and liberal opposition campaigner, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

Sixsmith&#x27;s 2024 book, &quot;Putin and the Return of History&quot; examines the West&#x27;s plans for a unipolar world following the collapse of Soviet communism and how this contributed to Vladimir Putin&#x27;s growing antagonism towards Washington and NATO.

<doc id="639449" wikidata="Q4754605" url="?curid=639449" title="Andover Canal">
<text>The Andover Canal (formally, the Andevor Canal) was a canal built in Hampshire, England. It ran from Andover to Redbridge through Stockbridge and Romsey. The canal had a fall of through 24 locks, and for much of its length paralleled the River Anton and River Test. It opened in 1794, but was never a commercial success. The only dividend paid to shareholders was in 1859, using the proceeds from the sale of the canal to the London and South Western Railway, who bought it to lay a railway line along much of its course. The railway line is now also defunct.

==History==
The first survey for an Andover Canal was carried out in 1770 by Robert Whitworth, at a time when there was a great deal of canal building activity in the country. The canal would follow the valley of the River Anton, until it joined the River Test, and then follow that valley down to Redbridge. He produced an estimated price for a narrow canal, and another for a wider canal. The following year, Parliament was approached for permission to bring a bill, quoting an act of Parliament from the reign of Charles II, which had granted rights to make several rivers, including the Test and the Anton, navigable. The bill was not submitted, which Phillips, writing his &quot;General History of Navigation&quot; in 1795, stated was due to objections concerning land purchase and possible damage to property, but a newspaper report in 1788 believed it was due to a lack of subscribers.
Interest in the scheme revived in 1788, when a meeting was held in Andover on 4 August. With support from Andover Corporation, a committee was appointed, and Robert Whitworth carried out another survey. Of the estimated £35,000, over £19,000 had been pledged within two weeks, and by the time the bill was submitted to Parliament in March 1789, this figure had risen to £30,700. An act of Parliament, the (29 Geo. 3. c. 72) was obtained on 13 July, which created &quot;The Company of Proprietors of the Canal Navigation&quot;, who had powers to raise £35,000 by the issuing of shares, and an additional £30,000 if required, of which £10,000 could be raised by issuing more shares and £20,000 by mortgage. Management was by a committee of 15, appointed from among the proprietors. One unusual aspect of the Andover Canal Act 1789 was that it specified that the canal could open between 4:00 am and 10:00 pm, and that the maximum size of barges was to be with a draught of .

The canal was completed in 1794 at a cost of £48,000; £35,000 had been raised by issuing shares and £13,000 had been borrowed. The canal locks were built to take boats up to long and wide, which was somewhat bigger than the enabling act of Parliament allowed. The main cargos of the canal were coal, slates and manure coming in from Southampton Water and agricultural produce going out, although boats were often unable to find cargos for the journey back out to Southampton Water. The canal was never successful enough to pay a dividend until it closed in 1859, when income from the sale to Andover &amp; Redbridge Railway produced one. In 1827 the canal was 8 years behind on its interest payments although this had improved to only one year by 1851.

===Demise===
The Manchester and Southampton Railway (MSR) agreed to buy the canal for £30,000 in 1845, but while the bill was progressing through Parliament, the railway company and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) agreed to share ownership of both the canal and the railway line from Redbridge to Andover, at which point the Great Western Railway (GWR) objected, and the bill was defeated. Two years later, the MSR again tried to get an act of Parliament for the line, but again it was defeated. The LSWR, however, obtained a bill for a line from Salisbury to Basingstoke, which would pass through Andover, and were also empowered to buy the canal. Work on this line stopped in 1849, at which point the canal company bought the sixteen barges that worked on the canal and operated the boats themselves. This solved the problem of potential toll reductions which the barge operators were requesting. The two railway companies, now acting together again, decided that the canal should close, once the purchase money had been given to the shareholders. £9,000 was paid in 1851, but the rest was not. Local landowners then set up a company to complete the railway link between Basingstoke and Salisbury. It reached Andover in 1854, after which the canal maintained its traffic by reducing tolls, but the reduced income resulted in the interest on loans not being paid.

A complicated series of negotiations then took place, with the GWR attempting to buy the canal, then encouraging the canal company to form the Andover Canal Railway Company, which would build a broad-gauge railway along its course to Southampton, and finally both companies trying to buy the canal. In the end, they reached agreement, the LSWR made the purchase, and the line was laid to standard gauge. The canal ceased to operate on 19 September 1859, and the railway, nicknamed the Sprat and Winkle Line, was opened on 6 March 1865. Around of the canal bed were used for the railway.

Much of this railway has since also been abandoned. As a result, most traces of the canal have completely disappeared, although the remains of a stretch of the canal can still be seen between Timsbury and Romsey.

In addition, several stretches of canal can be made out alongside the old railway track bed such as at Brook and also between Westover and Fullerton, where reasonable stone and brick remains of a lock are evident.

==Course==
The canal terminus was on the south side of the River Anton in Andover. It then followed the river to its junction with the River Test, and crossed both rivers on two aqueducts. Below the aqueducts, it followed the east bank of the river to Redbridge. Above Kimbridge, there was a junction with the Salisbury and Southampton Canal. The junction with the Test at Redbridge, from where access to Southampton Water was possible, was situated above the medieval bridge, although the original plans showed it a little further to the south on the foreshore. The total length of the canal was , and the 24 locks dropped the level through .

<doc id="639450" wikidata="Q3649294" url="?curid=639450" title="The Nutmeg of Consolation">
<text>The Nutmeg of Consolation is the fourteenth historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by British author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1991. The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.

Building a schooner on an island in the South China Sea as food supplies grow scant, Aubrey and his shipmates are attacked by pirates then rescued by a Chinese ship large enough to hold them all as far as Batavia, where Raffles has a ship for them. Aubrey names the sweet-smelling ship from one of the sultan&#x27;s many titles, &quot;Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;. They sail into the Celebes Sea, where battle commences.

This novel constitutes the second of a five-novel circumnavigation of the globe; other novels in this voyage include &quot;The Thirteen Gun Salute&quot;, &quot;Clarissa Oakes/The Truelove&quot;, &quot;The Wine-Dark Sea&quot;, and &quot;The Commodore&quot;.

Reviews written soon after publication were generally impressed with the main characters, drawn well, though opposite in abilities. The author&#x27;s ability to put the reader in an era about 200 years ago was judged to be impressive and engrossing, &quot;contemporary novels, written, paradoxically, in an 18th-Century voice&quot;, also that O&#x27;Brian created &quot;a whole, solidly living world for the imagination to inhabit.&quot; Some feared that too much nautical detail will put off some readers, while others found that of small importance compared to the characters and how they are facing the world. The author&#x27;s descriptions of the flora and fauna seen in Maturin&#x27;s rambles received strong praise. All of the reviews noted the descriptions of the squalor and brutality of the penal colony at Botany Bay in that era. One reviewer said that Doctor Maturin was the more interesting of the two characters in this novel, for his botanising and his reactions to the changes of fortune and to insult. At least one reviewer gave his view of the fourteen novels as a whole, and on O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s ability to break out of the nautical genre, to write excellent novels.

==Plot summary==
Aubrey and his crew are shipwrecked on a remote island in the South China Sea after surviving the destruction of HMS &quot;Diane&quot; in a typhoon. A cricket match is underway between the sailors and marines, which keeps up the crew&#x27;s spirits as they build the schooner needed for reaching Batavia. Doctor Maturin is killing game for the pot, particularly wild boar and babirussas. Dyaks, Kesegaran and her male assistants, arrive on the island. Speaking in Malay with Maturin, the Dyaks promise to take a message to Batavia in exchange for a note on Shao Yen for twenty &quot;joes&quot; (Portuguese Johannes coins), but instead return in a proa with 300 pirates, twice as many as the 150 Dianes. After beheading the ship&#x27;s carpenter and some other crew members while stealing tools, they attack the encampment and burn the schooner. They are routed after a bloody conflict and all pirates lost as their proa is sunk by the last remaining ball from the &quot;long nine&quot; gun, well-aimed.

On the last day of rum and tobacco supplies, Maturin meets four Chinese children collecting precious birds&#x27; nests from the surrounding cliffs. Maturin binds the boy&#x27;s injured leg. Maturin persuades the children&#x27;s father, Li Po, to carry the remaining crew of the &quot;Diane&quot; in the empty holds of his roomy junk back to Batavia. It is intercepted by Wan Da, whom Maturin knows well from Pulo Prabang, and who shares information about the French frigate nearly ready to sail. Upon arriving in Batavia, Aubrey is provided by Governor Raffles with a 20-gun ship which Aubrey renames &quot;Nutmeg of Consolation&quot; after one of the titles of the Sultan of Pulo Prabang. At sea, Aubrey hears from a Dutch merchantman that the French frigate &quot;Cornélie&quot; is watering at an island, Nil Desperandum. Aubrey disguises the &quot;Nutmeg&quot; as a Dutch merchantman and, when the disguise fails, engages in battle with the &quot;Cornélie&quot;. Aubrey attempts to outwit the &quot;Cornélie&quot; in the Salibabu Passage but is outmanoeuvred and nearly outgunned until, at the height of the chase, &quot;Nutmeg&quot; encounters the &quot;Surprise&quot;, under Thomas Pullings, accompanied by the &quot;Triton&quot;, a British privateer. The &quot;Surprise&quot; gives chase, and the &quot;Cornélie&quot; soon founders. The &quot;Surprise&quot; takes the survivors, including Lieutenant Dumesnil, on board. Pullings has taken many prizes in the time they were parted, with two American privateers in convoy. The &quot;Nutmeg&quot; and its convoy sail back to Batavia, via Canton, under Lieutenant Fielding.

Resuming command of &quot;Surprise&quot;, Aubrey continues their interrupted journey to New South Wales. Stopping to collect fresh foods at Sweetings Island, Maturin rescues two young Melanesian girls, the sole survivors of an outbreak of smallpox. Sailing into Sydney Cove, Aubrey, Maturin and Martin are shocked at life in the penal colony under Governor Macquarie, no better than it was after the &quot;Rum Rebellion&quot;. Maturin and Tom Pullings attend a formal dinner, hosted by Mrs Macquarie and the Governor&#x27;s deputy, Colonel McPherson, at Government House. Captain Lowe insults Sir Joseph Banks and Maturin, and again insults Maturin outside the house; Maturin fights and wins a duel against Captain Lowe on the spot. Maturin learns by letter that Sir Joseph Blaine could not transfer Maturin&#x27;s funds to Smith&#x27;s failed bank, so his fortune is not lost.

Dr Redfern takes Maturin to see Padeen Colman, recovering in the hospital from his severe flogging for absconding from the penal colony. Maturin and Martin journey inland of Sydney to examine the local flora and fauna and collect specimens. On a second trip, they stay with Paulton north of Sydney near Bird Island, and find Padeen in better shape, assigned to work there as Maturin had arranged. The Irishman was convicted for stealing laudanum from an Edinburgh apothecary, meriting the punishment of transportation to this penal colony. Maturin tells Padeen to meet him at Bird Island on the day &quot;Surprise&quot; is to sail. This plan is checked by Aubrey, who promised to take no escaped prisoners, leaving Maturin in a quandary. Maturin hears from Hastings of the recently arrived &quot;Waverley&quot; that his wife Diana had a daughter in April, and he is overjoyed, but tells no one else his good news. Maturin and Martin, keen to see the duck-billed platypus, locally named the &#x27;water-mole&#x27;, are taken on a final expedition in the cutter by Barret Bonden. Maturin and Martin spot two platypuses. Maturin secures one - a male - in his net but his arm is pierced by its two poison-spurs. When the &quot;Surprise&quot; arrives to pick them up, Padeen is also taken aboard. To everyone&#x27;s relief Maturin slowly regains consciousness after he is aboard.

==Series chronology==

This novel references actual events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the eighth of eleven novels (beginning with &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;) that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O&#x27;Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (introduction to &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the tenth novel in this series). The events of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.

==Reviews==

Reviews written soon after publication were generally impressed with the main characters, drawn well, though opposite in abilities. The author&#x27;s ability to put the reader in an era about 200 years ago was judged to be impressive and engrossing. Some feared that too much nautical detail will put off some readers, while another found that of small importance compared to the characters and how they are facing the world. At least one reviewer gave his view of the fourteen novels as a whole, as they are a newly discovered treasure. Publication in the US of novels in the series prior to this one was happening as &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot; was first printed in both the US and the UK; the series had found a new audience.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; found this novel to be &quot;witty, literate and engaging&quot;, with the action following directly from the previous novel (&quot;The Thirteen Gun Salute&quot;). It was described as &quot;Another in O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s stylish epic series&quot; and the bemused doctor was &quot;as always, the tale&#x27;s most interesting character and constantly preoccupied with flora, fauna, and good conversation&quot;.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; judged that the &quot;subtly drawn&quot; characters of Maturin and Aubrey will please readers. The novel is rich with details and contrasts: &quot;the chief joys are in the details of the food, drink and clothes of the era, with those of the rain forests, kangaroos and platypuses added here. On the other hand, early Sydney&#x27;s squalor is matched by its brutality.&quot;

&quot;Library Journal&quot; found the main characters very well drawn, and noted the quality of the writing in the description of flora and fauna seen in the series of adventures in this novel. They noted that &quot;O&#x27;Brian certainly knows his stuff about 19th-century seamanship (although landlubber readers may find themselves confused by some of the technical terminology).&quot; and that the ship ends this novel &quot;amidst the cruelty of Botany Bay, the penal colony in New South Wales.&quot;

A S Byatt had strong praise for this novel in her review of it. &quot;An essential of the truly gripping book for the narrative addict is the creation of a whole, solidly living world for the imagination to inhabit, and O&#x27;Brian does with prodigal specificity and generosity.&quot; Dean King remarked the strength of her specific and positive review, when it was possible that a review for an author in his late seventies might suggest it was a nice try, but not keeping up to standard.

Mark Horowitz in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the novels so far written as a long story of two characters, living at the dawn of the 19th century but in novels that are truly modern. His praise is strong, with comparisons to Conrad.

How good can they really be? In England, after all, 19th-Century naval fiction--from the classic Horatio Hornblower stories by C. S. Forester to the waterlogged tales of Dudley Pope--is a tried and true, not to say tired, genre with limited appeal. But O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s books are as atypical of conventional sea stories as Conrad&#x27;s. Like John le Carre, he has erased the boundary separating a debased genre from &quot;serious&quot; fiction. O&#x27;Brian is a novelist, pure and simple, one of the best we have. . . . These are contemporary novels, written, paradoxically, in an 18th-Century voice. The Age of Reason is just making way for the Romantic era; Maturin and Aubrey, the philosophe and the man of action, are on the cusp. Without a hint of anachronism, O&#x27;Brian still manages to suggest a modern sensibility struggling to be born. (Once, Maturin even comes perilously close to discovering the subconscious a century in advance of Freud; another time, contemplating a peculiar animal specimen, he speculates on the origins of species and their evolution, but can&#x27;t quite work out the details.)

As to where it will all end, O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s not saying. At least one more in the series is on the way. &quot;Are endings really so very important?&quot; asks a friend of Maturin&#x27;s during a discussion of literature in, of all places, far-off Botany Bay. &quot;Sterne did quite well without one. . . . I remember Bourville&#x27;s definition of a novel as a work in which life flows in abundance, swirling without pause: or as you might say without an end, an organized end. And there is at least one Mozart quartet that stops without the slightest ceremony: most satisfying when you get used to it.&quot;

==Author&#x27;s note==

In his &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot;, O&#x27;Brian makes reference to Robert Hughes&#x27; &quot;The Fatal Shore&quot;, a book that provided him with invaluable research information about the history of Australia and, in particular, the penal colony of New South Wales.

==Continuity==
This story begins where &quot;The Thirteen Gun Salute&quot; ended, on the island with HMS &quot;Diane&quot; broken by the typhoon, building a new ship from what they can salvage. It makes reference to the last time that Aubrey and Maturin approached Botany Bay in &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;, after the situation with Captain William Bligh and the Rum Rebellion has been addressed. Their stop was short, as their mission was not needed and the place unbearable as to the human inhabitants.

The process of reissuing the novels prior to this novel and &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; was in full swing in 1991, as the whole series gained a new and wider audience, as Mark Howowitz describes.

Two of my favorite friends are fictitious characters; they live in more than a dozen volumes always near at hand. Their names are Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and their creator is a 77-year-old novelist named Patrick O&#x27;Brian, whose 14 books about them have been continuously in print in England since the first, &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; was published in 1970.

O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s British fans include T. J. Binyon, Iris Murdoch, A. S. Byatt, Timothy Mo and the late Mary Renault, but, until recently, this splendid saga of two serving officers in the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars was unavailable in this country, apart from the first few installments which went immediately out of print. Last year, however, W. W. Norton decided to reissue the series in its entirety, and so far nine of the 14 have appeared here, including the most recent chapter, &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;.

<text>Parkes Observatory is a radio astronomy observatory, located north of the town of Parkes, New South Wales, Australia. It hosts Murriyang, the 64 m CSIRO Parkes Radio Telescope also known as &quot;The Dish&quot;, along with two smaller radio telescopes. The 64 m dish was one of several radio antennae used to receive live television images of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Its scientific contributions over the decades led the ABC to describe it as &quot;the most successful scientific instrument ever built in Australia&quot; after 40 years of operation.

The Parkes Observatory is run by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), as part of the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) network of radio telescopes. It is frequently operated together with other CSIRO radio telescopes, principally the array of six dishes at the Australia Telescope Compact Array near Narrabri, and a single dish at Mopra (near Coonabarabran), to form a very long baseline interferometry array.

The observatory was included on the Australian National Heritage List on 10 August 2020.

== Design and construction ==

The Parkes Radio Telescope, completed in 1961, was the brainchild of E. G. &quot;Taffy&quot; Bowen, chief of the CSIRO&#x27;s Radiophysics Laboratory. During the Second World War, he had worked on radar development in the United States and had made connections in its scientific community. Calling on this old boy network, he persuaded two philanthropic organisations, the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation, to fund half the cost of the telescope. It was this recognition and key financial support from the United States that persuaded Australian prime minister, Robert Menzies, to agree to fund the rest of the project.

The Parkes site was chosen in 1956, as it was accessible, but far enough from Sydney to have clear skies. Additionally the mayor Ces Moon and landowner Australia James Helm were both enthusiastic about the project.

The success of the Parkes telescope led NASA to copy features of the design into their Deep Space Network, which included three dishes built at Goldstone, California, Madrid, Spain, and Tidbinbilla, near Canberra in Australia.

The telescope continues to be upgraded, and as of 2018 is 10,000 times more sensitive than its initial configuration.

==Radio telescope==

=== Hardware ===
The primary observing instrument is the movable dish telescope, second largest in the Southern Hemisphere, and one of the first large movable dishes in the world (DSS-43 at Tidbinbilla was extended from to in 1987, surpassing Parkes).

The inner part of the dish is solid aluminium and the outer area a fine aluminium mesh, creating its distinctive two-tone appearance.

In the early 1970s the outer mesh panels were replaced by perforated aluminium panels. The inner smooth plated surface was upgraded in 1975 which provided focusing capability for centimetre- and millimetre-length microwaves.

The inner aluminium plating was expanded out to a diameter in 2003, improving signals by 1dB.

The telescope has an altazimuth mount. It is guided by a small mock-telescope placed within the structure at the same rotational axes as the dish, but with an equatorial mount. The two are dynamically locked when tracking an astronomical object by a laser guiding system. This primary-secondary approach was designed by Barnes Wallis.

=== Receivers ===

The focus cabin is located at the focus of the parabolic dish, supported by three struts above the dish. The cabin contains multiple radio and microwave detectors, which can be switched into the focus beam for different science observations.

These include:

* receiver &quot;(Replaced now by UWL)&quot;
*The Multibeam Receiver – a 13-horned receiver cooled at for the Hydrogen line.
*H-OH receiver &quot;(Replaced now by UWL)&quot;
*GALILEO receiver &quot;(Replaced now by UWL)&quot;
*AT multiband receivers, covering 2.2-2.5,4.5-5.1 and 8.1-8.7 GHz
*METH6, covering 5.9-6.8 GHz
*MARS (X band receiver), covering 8.1-8.5 GHz
*KU-BAND, covering 12–15 GHz
*13MM (K band receiver), covering 16–26 GHz
*Ultra Wideband Low (UWL) receiver – installed in 2018 it can simultaneously receive signals from 700 MHz to 4 GHz. It is cooled to to minimise noise and will enable astronomers to work on more than one project at once.

=== 18m &quot;Kennedy Dish&quot; antenna ===

The &quot;Kennedy Dish&quot; antenna was transferred from the Fleurs Observatory (where it was part of the Mills Cross Telescope) in 1963. Mounted on rails and powered by a tractor engine to allow the distance between the antenna and the main dish to be easily varied, it was used as an interferometer with the main dish. Phase instability due to an exposed cable meant that its pointing ability was diminished, but it was able to be used for identifying size and brightness distributions. In 1968 it successfully proved that Radio galaxy lobes were not expanding, and in the same era contributed to Hydrogen line and OH investigations. As a stand-alone antenna it was used in studying the Magellanic Stream.

It was used as an uplink antenna in the Apollo program, as the larger Parkes telescope is receive-only. It is preserved by the Australia Telescope National Facility.

=== Australia Telescope National Facility ===
The observatory is a part of the Australia Telescope National Facility network of radio telescopes. The dish is frequently operated together with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at Narrabri, the ASKAP array in Western Australia, and a single dish at Mopra, telescopes operated by the University of Tasmania as well as telescopes from New Zealand, South Africa and Asia to form a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) array.

== Astronomy research ==
===Timeline===
1960s
* Built in 1961 and was fully operational by 1963.
* A 1962 series of lunar occultations of the radio source 3C 273 observed by the Parkes Telescope were used to locate its exact position, allowing astronomers to find and study its visual component. Soon to be called &quot;quasi-stellar radio sources&quot; (quasar), Parkes observation was the first time this type of object to be associated with an optical counterpart.
* 1964 to 1966, all-sky survey at 408 MHz of the southern sky is conducted and published (first version of the &quot;Parkes Catalogue of Radio Sources&quot;) finding over 2000 radio sources including many new quasars.
* Second all-sky survey at 2,700 MHz begins in 1968 (completed in 1980).

1990s
* June and November 1990, Parkes collaborates with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory to conduct a 5GHZ (6 cm) all-sky survey (The Parkes-MIT-NRAO (PMN) Surveys). The Telescope is equipped with a NRAO multi-beam receiver operating at a frequency of 4850 MHz.
* Between 1997 and 2002 it conducted the H I Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) neutral hydrogen survey, the largest blind survey for galaxies in the hydrogen line (21-centimeter line or H I line) to date.

2000s
* More than half of currently known pulsars were discovered by the Parkes Observatory.
* Vital component of the programme to detect gravity waves as part of the broader International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA), which also includes the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) and the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA).

===Fast radio burst===

Fast radio bursts were discovered in 2007 when Duncan Lorimer of West Virginia University assigned his student David Narkevic to look through archival data recorded in 2001 by the Parkes radio dish.
Analysis of the survey data found a 30-jansky dispersed burst which occurred on 24 July 2001, less than 5 milliseconds in duration, located 3° from the Small Magellanic Cloud. At the time it was theorised FRBs might be signals from another galaxy, emissions from neutron stars or black holes. More recent results confirm that magnetars, a kind of highly magnetised neutron star, may be one source of fast radio bursts.

=== Peryton discovery ===
In 1998 Parkes telescope began detecting fast radio bursts and similar looking signals named perytons. Perytons were thought to be of terrestrial origin, such as interference from lightning strikes. In 2015 it was determined that perytons were caused by staff members opening the door of the facility&#x27;s microwave oven during its cycle. When the microwave oven door was opened, 1.4 GHz microwaves from the magnetron shutdown phase were able to escape. Subsequent tests revealed that a peryton can be generated at 1.4 GHz when a microwave oven door is opened prematurely and the telescope is at an appropriate relative angle.

=== Breakthrough Listen ===
The telescope has been contracted to be used in a search for radio signals from extraterrestrial technologies for the heavily funded project Breakthrough Listen. The principal role of the Parkes Telescope in the program will be to conduct a survey of the Milky Way galactic plane over 1.2 to 1.5 GHz and a targeted search of approximately 1000 nearby stars over the frequency range 0.7 to 4 GHz.

== Historical non-astronomy research ==

During the Apollo missions to the Moon, the Parkes Observatory was used to relay communication and telemetry signals to NASA, providing coverage for when the Moon was on the Australian side of the Earth.

The telescope also played a role in relaying data from the NASA &quot;Galileo&quot; mission to Jupiter that required radio-telescope support due to the use of its backup telemetry subsystem as the principal means to relay science data.

The observatory has remained involved in tracking numerous space missions up to the present day, including:
* Mariner 2
* Mariner 4
* Voyager missions (but no longer due to distance of the probes, only the dish at the CDSCC can still communicate with the two Voyager probes, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot;.)
* Giotto where it was the primary control and downlink for the mission to Halley&#x27;s Comet
* &quot;Galileo&quot;
* &quot;Cassini-Huygens&quot; (until 2017)

The CSIRO has made several documentaries on this observatory, with some of these documentaries being posted to YouTube.

===Apollo 11 broadcast===
When Buzz Aldrin switched on the TV camera on the Lunar Module, three tracking antennas received the signals simultaneously. They were the Goldstone antenna in California, the antenna at Honeysuckle Creek near Canberra in Australia, and the dish at Parkes.

Since they started the spacewalk early, the Moon was only just above the horizon and below the visibility of the main Parkes receiver. Although they were able to pick up a quality signal from the off axis receiver, the international broadcast alternated between signals from Goldstone and Honeysuckle Creek, the latter of which ultimately broadcast Neil Armstrong&#x27;s first steps on the Moon worldwide.

A little under nine minutes into the broadcast, the Moon rose far enough to be picked by the main antenna and the international broadcast switched to the Parkes signal. The quality of the TV pictures from Parkes was so superior that NASA stayed with Parkes as the source of the TV for the remainder of the 2.5-hour broadcast.

In the lead up to the landing wind gusts greater than were hitting the Parkes telescope, and the telescope operated outside safety limits throughout the moonwalk.

===Mars rovers===
In 2012 the observatory received special signals from the Mars rover &quot;Opportunity&quot; (MER-B), to simulate the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover UHF radio. This helped prepare for the then upcoming &quot;Curiosity&quot; (MSL) landing in early Augustit successfully touched down on 6 August 2012.

==Visitors Centre==
The Parkes Observatory Visitors Centre allows visitors to view the dish as it moves. There are exhibits about the history of the telescope, astronomy, and space science, and a 3-D movie theatre.

== Legacy ==

In 1995 the radio telescope was declared a National Engineering Landmark by Engineers Australia. The nomination cited its status as the largest southern hemisphere radio telescope, elegant structure, with features mimicked by later Deep Space Network telescopes, scientific discoveries and social importance through &quot;enhancing [Australia&#x27;s] image as a technologically advanced nation&quot;.

On Monday, 31 October 2011, Google Australia replaced its logo with a Google Doodle in honour of Parkes Observatory&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

The Parkes Radio Telescope was added to the National Heritage List in 2020.

== In popular culture ==
* In 1964 the telescope featured in the opening credit sequence of &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Australia&#x27;s first locally produced sci-fi TV series. Some scenes were also shot on location at the telescope and inside the observatory.
* The observatory and telescope were featured in the 2000 film &quot;The Dish&quot;, a fictionalised account of the observatory&#x27;s involvement with the Apollo 11 Moon landing.
* The telescope is featured on the cover of Steve Hillage&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Motivation Radio&quot;.

== Wiradjuri names ==
In November 2020, in NAIDOC Week, the Observatory&#x27;s three telescopes were given Wiradjuri names. The main telescope (&quot;The Dish&quot;) is &quot;Murriyang&quot;, after the home in the stars of Biyaami, the creator spirit. The smaller 12m dish built in 2008 is &quot;Giyalung Miil&quot;, meaning &quot;Smart Eye&quot;. The third, decommissioned antenna is &quot;Giyalung Guluman&quot;, meaning &quot;Smart Dish&quot;.

<text>Los Glaciares National Park () is a federal protected area in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.

The park covers an area of , making it the largest national park in the country.
Established on 11 May 1937, it hosts a representative sample of Magellanic subpolar forest and west Patagonian steppe biodiversity in good state of conservation. In 1981, it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

The park&#x27;s name refers to the giant ice cap in the Andes, the largest outside of Antarctica, Greenland and Iceland, feeding 47 large glaciers, of which 13 flow towards the Pacific Ocean. In other parts of the world, glaciers start at a height of at least above mean sea level, but due to the size of the ice cap, these glaciers begin at only , sliding down to . Los Glaciares borders Torres del Paine National Park to the south in Chilean territory.

== Geography ==

Los Glaciares, of which 30% is covered by ice, can be divided in two parts, each corresponding with one of the two elongated big lakes partially contained by the park. Lake Argentino, and the largest in Argentina, is in the south, while Lake Viedma, , is in the north. Both lakes feed the Santa Cruz River that flows down to lower part Puerto Santa Cruz on the Atlantic. Between the two halves is a non-touristic zone without lakes called &quot;Zona Centro&quot;.

The northern half consists of part of Viedma Lake, the Viedma Glacier and a few minor glaciers, and a number of mountains very popular among fans of climbing and trekking, including Mount Fitz Roy and Cerro Torre.

The southern part has, as well as a number of smaller ones, the major glaciers which flow into Lake Argentino: Perito Moreno Glacier, Upsala Glacier, and Spegazzini Glacier. Typical excursion boats travel between icebergs to visit Onelli Bay, and the otherwise inaccessible Spegazzini and Upsala. Perito Moreno is reachable by land.

== Climate ==
The park has a cool and moist temperate climate. Mean temperatures range from in winter to in summer although at higher altitudes, the mean annual temperature can be around . The park receives an average annual rainfall of in the west and in the east which is evenly distributed throughout the year. Snowfall is common during the colder months.

== Ecology ==
The mountains hold most of the humidity from the Pacific Ocean, letting through only the ice coldness (annual average of ) and creating the arid Patagonian steppe on the Argentine side of the range. This area is habitat for rheas, guanaco, cougar, and South American gray fox, the latter of which has suffered from the invasion of the cattle industry and are endangered. The guanaco, while not endangered, has had a dramatic decline in historic population due to large scale grazing of livestock throughout much of Patagonia. There are over 100 species of birds in the area (condors, eagles, and others). Between the ice and the Patagonian steppe there is a fertile area of Magellanic subpolar forests composed mainly of lengas and guindos, but also ñires. Within these more hospitable areas also live huemul deer and torrent duck.

== Issues ==
Los Glaciares National Park faces many issues around tourism, overgrazing, forest fires and more. There are areas of the park where overgrazing is quite a problem and contains many alien/invasive and feral species such as cattle, European hares and certain types of trout. Forest fires have had a strong impact on the site and degraded and destroyed parts of it as well.

== Human use ==
Los Glaciares is a major attraction for international tourists. Starting points of tours are the city of El Calafate at the shore of Lake Argentino but outside the park, where the park&#x27;s administration has its headquarters, and El Chaltén village in the northern part of the park, at the foot of the Fitz Roy. Other touristic points in the park include Lago del Desierto and Lago Roca.

It was also used as one of the filming locations for &quot;Return of the Ice&quot;, the second episode of the speculative science documentary series &quot;The Future is Wild&quot;.

Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Jens briefly studied at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Northwestern University, majoring in acting, then moved to New York, worked as a secretary, became a dance student of Martha Graham, and studied acting at HB Studio.

==Career==

Jens appeared in the role of the thief in the New York premiere production of Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;The Balcony&quot;. She earned excellent reviews playing Josie in &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot; at New York&#x27;s Circle in the Square Theatre in the late 1960s, and she appeared in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; with the American Shakespeare Theatre company in 1972.

Jens first appeared on film as the titular character in &quot;Terror from the Year 5000&quot; (1958), which was later featured in the eighth season of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

During the 1970s, Jens appeared in episodes of television shows such as &quot;Bonanza,&quot; &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (S18E23 -“Talbot”), &quot;McMillan and Wife&quot;, &quot;The New Land,&quot; &quot;Gibbsville&quot; and &quot;Medical Center&quot;. In 1976–77, Jens played the role of Mae Olinski on 43 episodes of the soap spoof &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot;.

Law&quot;. She appeared as Joan Campbell in several episodes of &quot;Melrose Place&quot; in Season 1 (1992-93) and again later in an episode of Season 6 (1997).

Jens appeared in the 1993 episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; titled &quot;The Chase&quot; as a member of the race responsible for populating the galaxy with humanoid life forms. She appeared in a recurring role spanning five seasons of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; as the totalitarian Female Changeling (1994-99).

Jens narrated a number of documentaries including &quot;The Great War and the Shaping of the 20th Century&quot; and voiced the female Guardian in the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (2011). In 2018, Jens lent her voice to the video game &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, reprising her role as the Female Changeling.

<doc id="639500" wikidata="Q387820" url="?curid=639500" title="Romeo Void">
<text>Romeo Void was an American new wave/post punk band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1979. The band primarily consisted of saxophonist Benjamin Bossi, vocalist Debora Iyall, guitarist Peter Woods, and bassist Frank Zincavage. The band went through four drummers, starting with Jay Derrah and ending with Aaron Smith. The band released three albums, &quot;It&#x27;s a Condition&quot;, &quot;Benefactor&quot; and &quot;Instincts&quot;, along with one EP. They are best known for the songs &quot;Never Say Never&quot; and &quot;A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)&quot;; the latter became a Top 40 pop single.

The band was started at the San Francisco Art Institute by Iyall and Zincavage. They released a single on the recently formed 415 Records before recording their debut album, which has been deemed a &quot;masterpiece of American post-punk&quot;. The success of their second release, a four-song EP titled &quot;Never Say Never&quot; resulted in a distribution deal with Columbia Records. The band continued to release music and tour until they broke up in 1985. The members have reunited briefly over the years. Iyall has continued to pursue music as a side project. Iyall has garnered acclaim as a skilled lyricist who explores themes like sexuality and alienation from a female perspective with &quot;searing imagery&quot;.

==History==
===1979: Formation===
Romeo Void formed at the San Francisco Art Institute in February 1979. Vocalist Debora Iyall occasionally visited the Bay Area to see Patti Smith perform. She decided to pursue an art education after reading a fortune cookie. &quot;It was in the late &#x27;70s at the Indochina Friendship Booth at the annual Fourth of July streetfair in Eureka, California,&quot; she said. &quot;I got a fortune cookie that said &#x27;Art is your fate, don&#x27;t debate.&#x27; That next January, I was enrolled in an art school in San Francisco.&quot; She began frequenting the Mabuhay Gardens, a popular nightclub, to see local alternative rock groups like The Nuns, the Mutants, Crime, and the Avengers. She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, . Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: &quot;After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it in my mind that you had to be skinny to be up there [on stage], but after going to the Mabuhay [...] you just do whatever you want, be whoever you want, just make it happen.&quot;

Bassist Frank Zincavage met Iyall at the SF Art Institute; the two hit it off and discussed putting a band together. They formed one with Woods and Derrah a few weeks later, drawing inspiration from the &quot;burgeoning local punk and post-punk scenes&quot;. Iyall recruited Woods because she enjoyed playing with him in the Mommers and Poppers. &quot;[It] seemed only natural that we invite Peter Woods to join us [... He] played clean and was a natural on rhythm guitar.&quot; Romeo Void officially formed on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1979. According to Iyall, the name Romeo Void referred to &quot;a lack of romance&quot; and came to mind after they saw a local magazine with the headline &quot;Why single women can&#x27;t get laid in San Francisco.&quot; The name &quot;means there are not romantic notions here — and there shouldn&#x27;t be,&quot; Iyall told an interviewer: &quot;We are about reality, not the myths created by other artists.&quot;

The band practiced in Iyall&#x27;s flat in the Mission District. It was decided that the group would embrace punk ideals despite the possibility that they become associated with the new wave movement. &quot;Even though I was going to the [Mabuhay Gardens] so much, I also had criticisms: Everyone was leaning against the wall wearing black,&quot; Iyall said. &quot;I guess we were considered new wave, but for me Romeo Void was a reaction against the regimentation of everyone having to be bleached blond and everything being about despair and no future, when I thought the do-it-yourself thing should encompass all the different kinds of emotions, and all the different colors. [...] I was proud of being American Indian, so I purposely never bleached my hair blond.&quot;

===1980–1982: &quot;It&#x27;s a Condition&quot;, &quot;Benefactor&quot;, and mainstream success===
The band became busy playing shows at clubs and warehouses around San Francisco, and quickly became popular. Saxophonist Benjamin Bossi was added to the lineup as an &quot;accident&quot; when Iyall met him while he worked in the New York City Deli on Market Street in San Francisco. The group released their first single, &quot;White Sweater&quot;, which consisted of the title track and a cover of Jerry Lordan&#x27;s popular instrumental composition &quot;Apache&quot;, in February 1981 on a recently founded local label called 415 Records. They worked on the recording of their debut album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Condition&quot;, with producer David Kahne. Before recording began, Derrah left the band and was replaced by John &quot;Stench&quot; Hanes, who had previously played with Pearl Harbor and the Explosions. Romeo Void&#x27;s debut was critically acclaimed upon its release through 415 in July 1981, and introduced Romeo Void&#x27;s &quot;unique blend of jazz, funk, rock and confrontational poetry&quot;. AllMusic writer Stewart Mason later heralded it as one of the &quot;masterpieces of American post-punk&quot;. Indie labels were enthusiastic with promotions and the band embarked on several nationwide tours. Eventually Hanes left the band, leaving Larry Carter to fill the drummer position.

The sudden surge in popularity was disorienting to Iyall. &quot;It was frightening: we played a college in Santa Barbara, and there were all these blond people crowding the stage, and I thought &#x27;These are the people who hated me in high school!&#x27; When you grow up being &#x27;outside&#x27; – because I wasn&#x27;t white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, &#x27;uh-oh, I must be doing something wrong – they like me!&#x27;&quot; Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Syncro Sound recording studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the &quot;Never Say Never&quot; EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama &quot;Reckless&quot;. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label&#x27;s roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled &quot;Benefactor&quot;, in November 1982. The album appeared at No. 119 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Benefactor&quot; was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song &quot;Never Say Never&quot;. The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which AllMusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for &quot;Benefactor&quot;: &quot;I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn&#x27;t ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd.&quot; She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.

===1983–present: &quot;Instincts&quot;, break-up, and post-band endeavors===
A third and final album was again helmed by David Kahne, which AllMusic writer Stewart Mason speculated was a &quot;reaction against the more commercial sound of &quot;Benefactor&quot;. By this time, Carter had been replaced by veteran session drummer Aaron Smith. &quot;Instincts&quot; was released in October 1984, debuted at No. 68 on the Billboard 200, and proved to be the band&#x27;s best-selling album. It also launched their most successful single, &quot;A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing),&quot; which broke the Billboard Top 40 and peaked at No. 35. Critical reactions were positive. Despite being the band&#x27;s most successful effort to date, Columbia pulled the band&#x27;s promotional support while on a nationwide tour. &quot;The very next town we got to after they made that decision, there wasn&#x27;t an A&amp;R person there,&quot; said Iyall. &quot;[There] was no local person there, there were no interviews and in-stores arranged as they had been. All that just ground to a halt.&quot; The band returned to San Francisco and soon broke up. Constant touring has been cited by Iyall as the primary reason for the break-up. &quot;You get tired of each other, and you get intolerant of being uncomfortable and away from your family and your friends.&quot; According to a VH1 reunion episode, the issue of Iyall&#x27;s weight was the reason for the label dropping them. In 2003, Iyall agreed with this claim: &quot;Howie sold us from 415 to Columbia Records, and they were like &#x27;Who&#x27;s this fat chick?&#x27; They decided that was as far as it was going to get, and pulled their support.&quot; &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; writer Denise Sullivan stated that the label spoke to Iyall about losing weight, but she subsequently refused. In 2010, Iyall declined to discuss the issue, but added that she may not be taking full responsibility in the matter.

Iyall released a solo album entitled &quot;Strange Language&quot; with former band members Bossi and Smith in 1986. Afterward she pursued a career as an art teacher. The band reunited briefly for a live performance in 1993. In 2004, Romeo Void was featured on an episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Bands Reunited&quot;. Bossi had sustained too much hearing damage over the years and was unable to perform, although he did meet up with the band again and watched the reunion performance from an adjacent room. Iyall has continued to dabble in music related projects and events. &quot;I still like to sing and I still like to perform,&quot; she said. In 2003 she was involved in a musical project called Knife in Water. She began collaborating with Peter Dunne, who was known as Peter when he played guitar for Pearl Harbor and the Explosions. Iyall and Dunne performed at a support benefit for &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; founder Paul Williams in June 2009, and performed at a concert honoring 415 Records later that September. They released an album entitled &quot;Stay Strong&quot; in 2010. 

Drummer Larry Carter died in August of 2021, from what is thought to be heart complications. Saxophonist Benjamin Bossi died of complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on December 13, 2022, at the age of 69.

==Music==

Romeo Void has generally been classified as a new wave or post-punk band. Some critics have noted dance elements in the music. According to Stewart Mason, writing for AllMusic, &quot;[The] band&#x27;s muscular blend of Joy Division&#x27;s atmospherics and the Gang of Four&#x27;s rattling momentum, with Benjamin Bossi&#x27;s splattering free jazz saxophone coloring everything, made Romeo Void one of the strongest of the American post-punk bands. The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; wrote that they &quot;had no trouble creating a signature sound for [themselves with a] scratchy guitar, soulful sax, [and] tight, precise drums.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that they sounded like &quot;an art-school band, with its textural complexity [and] touches of jazz and funk&quot; Saxophone player Benjamin Bossi has been observed as the ingredient that &quot;set the band apart&quot; and showed a &quot;talent for both improvisation and arrangement.&quot; Alan Niester, writing for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, said that he weaved &quot;in and out [...] like a snake charmer&quot; and reminded him of Andy Mackay, a saxophonist who played with Roxy Music.

Liam Lacey, also writing for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, described Iyall&#x27;s voice as &quot;sultry [and] sexy&quot;, while Mason called it &quot;powerful&quot;. Her style has sometimes been compared to Chrissie Hynde, vocalist for the Pretenders. Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; acknowledged the similarity, but also noted the influence of other singers in &quot;Never Say Never&quot; where Iyall mixed the &quot;aggressive bitchiness of [Hynde], the coy confrontational tactics of Patty Donahue of the Waitresses and the slack sensuality of Debbie Harry of the earliest Blondie.&quot; Iyall used to find the comparison annoying, but eventually warmed to it: &quot;When people said I sounded like her, I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Oh yeah, thanks a lot.&#x27; But this year, I&#x27;ve fallen in love with &quot;Learning To Crawl&quot; so now I don&#x27;t care if people want to make comparisons.&quot; After a live show in 1982, Niester contended that she was the weakest part of the group and had the &quot;vocal range of an automobile horn&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; writer Kathy Gillis wrote after a concert two years later that Iyall exhibited a &quot;dramatic range that, while not extreme in either direction, was touching.&quot;

Patti Smith had a great influence on Iyall. &quot;[She was] someone who was both a rock singer and a poet,&quot; she said. &quot;She combined things I was interested in. Plus, she wasn&#x27;t a trumped-up sex symbol. She was herself on stage. That appealed to me. It looked like something I could do. You didn&#x27;t have to look like all the other singers.&quot; Iyall was highly critical of the music of the day and found inspiration in other mediums. &quot;I hate rock and roll right now. It&#x27;s turned into some new kind of stupid religion... I&#x27;d rather listen to Billie Holiday, maybe Tom Waits. Actually, I&#x27;ll admit I like The Bangles – they have a great sound. But I&#x27;d just as soon read novels or paint pictures as listen to music. I love language – plain speech, used in an enigmatic, subliminal way; I&#x27;m not much tied to the literal.&quot;

==Lyrics==
Iyall was observed by &quot;Mother Jones&quot; to be among a new group of female fronted rock bands that displayed a &quot;tough, wry, street-wise, [and] cynical&quot; attitude and sought to redefine the role of women in rock music. She developed a sizable following for her writing that covered topics like &quot;frustrated desire [and] sexually motivated rage&quot; from a female perspective. Critics praised her lyrics for their &quot;searing imagery&quot;, &quot;seething poetics&quot;, and &quot;darkly intelligent lyrics&quot; &quot;My approach was always that I had something to say, I had a point of view,&quot; Iyall said, commenting on her outspokeness. &quot;I remember seeing Penelope from the Avengers at the Mabuhay Gardens and thinking, I can do that. I have something to say.&quot;

Romeo Void&#x27;s best known song is &quot;Never Say Never&quot;, which contains the famous line &quot;I might like you better if we slept together.&quot; AllMusic writer Heather Phares has argued that Iyall&#x27;s &quot;teasing, existential musings [...] predated and predicted the aloof yet frank sexuality of early- and mid-&#x27;90s artists such as Elastica and Liz Phair&quot;. Phares concluded that the song was &quot;a subversive, influential classic&quot; and &quot;one of new wave&#x27;s most distinctive and innovative moments. &quot; The song has been covered by many artists, among them are Queens of the Stone Age, Amanda Blank and Xiu Xiu. The song &quot;A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)&quot;, their highest-charting single, was reportedly written as a response to Michael Jackson&#x27;s hit song &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, but can also be seen as a tribute to women who have experienced traumatizing events. Iyall also wrote songs that touched on themes like social alienation (&quot;Undercover Kept&quot;) and generation gaps (&quot;Chinatown&quot;).

<text>In philosophy,  (; ) is knowledge or understanding. The term &quot;epistemology&quot; (the branch of philosophy concerning knowledge) is derived from .

== History ==

=== Plato ===

Plato, following Xenophanes, contrasts with : common belief or opinion. The term is also distinguished from : a craft or applied practice. In the &quot;Protagoras&quot;, Plato&#x27;s Socrates notes that and are prerequisites for prudence ().

=== Aristotle ===
Aristotle distinguished between five virtues of thought: , , , , and , with translating as &quot;craft&quot; or &quot;art&quot; and as &quot;knowledge&quot;. A full account of is given in &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;, where Aristotle argues that knowledge of necessary, rather than contingent, truths regarding causation is foundational for . To emphasize the necessity, he uses geometry. Notably, Aristotle uses the notion of cause () in a broader sense than contemporary thought. For example, understanding how geometrical axioms lead to a theorem about properties of triangles counts as understanding the &quot;cause&quot; of the proven property of the right triangle. As a result, is a virtue of thought that deals with what cannot be otherwise, while and deal with what is contingent.

== Contemporary interpretations ==
=== Michel Foucault ===
For Foucault, an is the guiding unconsciousness of subjectivity within a given epoch – subjective parameters which form an historical &quot;a priori&quot;. He uses the term () in his &quot;The Order of Things&quot;, in a specialized sense to mean the historical, non-temporal, &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge that grounds truth and discourses, thus representing the condition of their possibility within a particular epoch. In the book, Foucault describes :

In any given culture and at any given moment, there is always only one that defines the conditions of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in a theory or silently invested in a practice.

In subsequent writings, he makes it clear that several may co-exist and interact at the same time, being parts of various power-knowledge systems. Foucault attempts to demonstrate the constitutive limits of discourse, and in particular, the rules enabling their productivity; however, Foucault maintains that, though ideology may infiltrate and form science, it need not do so: it must be demonstrated how ideology actually forms the science in question; contradictions and lack of objectivity are not an indicator of ideology. Jean Piaget has compared Foucault&#x27;s use of with Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s notion of a paradigm.

<text>Columbus State University is a public university in Columbus, Georgia. Founded as Columbus College in 1958, the university was established and is administered by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia.

==History==
The university was first called Columbus College when it opened as a junior college in a hosiery mill in 1958. The college was staffed by fifteen faculty and staff and almost three hundred students attended courses in the first year.

Columbus College relocated to the midtown area in 1963, building a campus defined by modern architecture on what was previously a dairy farm. The school was granted four-year status in 1965 with offerings of bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. The first four-year class graduated in 1970.

In 1996, the school was renamed Columbus State University as part of a program to restructure four-year institutions within the state&#x27;s university system. The school now offers undergraduate and graduate programs in more than ninety academic disciplines. As of the 2010 academic year, the university enrolled more than 8,200 students. In early 2007, the art and theatre departments moved to the university&#x27;s newly built RiverPark Campus in downtown Columbus. The complex was designed to provide students of the fine arts with a tightly-knit living community and larger studios, laboratories, and galleries. The Schwob School of Music is housed in the adjacent RiverCenter for the Performing Arts.

<text>&quot;E²&quot; (pronounced &quot;E-Squared&quot;) is the seventy-third episode of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, the twenty-first episode of season three. It first aired on May 5, 2004, on UPN in the United States. The episode was the fifth of the season written by Mike Sussman, and it was directed by &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; alumnus Roxann Dawson, her fourth of the third season.

Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, registration NX-01. Season three of &quot;Enterprise&quot; features an ongoing story following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi. In this episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; encounters a version of itself that was sent 117 years into the past—now populated by the descendants of the crew as a generational ship. The two crews must work together so the modern &quot;Enterprise&quot; can access a wormhole defended by Xindi vessels.

The episode made use of the standing &quot;Enterprise&quot; sets, as well as those created for Degra&#x27;s ship. Guest stars included those who had previously appeared as members of the Xindi Council, as well as several who are new to &quot;Enterprise&quot;, who appeared as members of the future &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Most scenes were filmed between February 3 and 11, 2004, with an additional special effect shoot on February 13. Reviewers compared &quot;E²&quot; to a number of several other episodes, including &quot;Children of Time&quot;, &quot;Deadlock&quot;, and &quot;All Good Things...&quot;. The Nielsen ratings received by the episode equated to a 3.3/5% audience share.

==Plot==
To reach the rendezvous with Degra in three days, &quot;Enterprise&quot; approaches a nebula that contains a subspace corridor defended by Kovaalan vessels. The corridor will let them traverse the distance in minutes. Suddenly, an older yet enhanced copy of &quot;Enterprise&quot; appears, captained by a half-Vulcan man named Lorian, who explains that after the Enterprise enters the corridor, it will destabilize, causing Captain Archer&#x27;s version to travel 117 years into the past. Confronted with this situation, and not wanting to contaminate Earth&#x27;s time stream, it then turns itself into a generational ship to await the Xindi crisis. Arriving on board, Lorian reveals that he is the son of Commander Tucker and Sub-Commander T&#x27;Pol. Archer also meets his great-granddaughter, Karyn Archer, who is part Ikaaran, as &quot;Enterprise&quot; will rescue her great-grandmother Esilia from a spatial-anomaly field.

Lorian, after considering his knowledge of events, believes that the wormhole must be avoided altogether. Archer and Lorian then disagree over whether to implement an engine modification to &quot;Enterprise&quot;, since there is a 22% chance that it might destroy the ship. Archer then meets old T&#x27;Pol on board old &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and considers a plan where his ship could pass through safely, due to alternative modifications she suggests. A frustrated Lorian then reveals a secret plan: to steal the newer plasma injectors from &quot;Enterprise&quot; so they can confront the Xindi in place of their ancestors.

Lorian leads a raid and successfully steals the parts, but the old &quot;Enterprise&quot; is disabled by Archer as it is about to go to warp and Lorian is put in the brig. Archer is angry at having his own method of stealing engine components used against him. Lorian reveals that he had a chance to stop the Xindi Probe from &quot;The Expanse&quot; from attacking Earth by sacrificing Enterprise, but failed because he hesitated to condemn his crew. The two captains finally agree to work towards their shared mission. Meanwhile, T&#x27;Pol meets her older self and discuss her addiction to Trelium-D and her relationship with Tucker. The older T&#x27;Pol confirms the younger&#x27;s deepest fears: in Tucker, there is something bringing irrationality into her life which she can not control, but which will nurture her and have a positive irreplaceable effect on her life and spirit.

The &quot;Enterprises&quot; enter the nebula and Archer&#x27;s is quickly disabled. Lorian&#x27;s then tows it into the corridor using a tractor beam and turns back to attack the Kovaalan ships, saying he will follow shortly. Archer&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives safely, but old &quot;Enterprise&quot; never emerges and Archer wonders if, by successfully traversing the corridor, they ceased to exist. Degra arrives for their rendezvous.

==Production==

The episode was the fifth written by Mike Sussman in the third season. His previous work was &quot;Hatchery&quot;, co-written with André Bormanis. It was also the fourth episode of the season directed by Roxann Dawson. With &quot;E²&quot;, she had directed more episodes than any other director at that point in the season, having previously worked on &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Orders&quot;, &quot;Exile&quot; and &quot;Chosen Realm&quot;. Scott Bakula commented on the production of the episode: &quot;...a great episode along the lines of &#x27;Twilight&#x27; and &#x27;Similitude.&#x27; It&#x27;s a classic sci-fi and &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode.&quot;

Filming began on February 3, 2004, overlapping with the final day of production on the previous episode, &quot;The Forgotten&quot;. Production required the use of the standing &quot;Enterprise&quot; sets, as well as those that represented Degra&#x27;s ship. The majority of the shoot was completed on February 11, but an additional day of special effects filming with part of the cast also took place on February 13, 2004. The actors who played the members of the Xindi Council were among the guest stars who appeared in this episode: Randy Oglesby; Rick Worthy; and Tucker Smallwood. In addition, a number of guest actors appeared in &quot;Star Trek&quot; for the first time: David Andrews; Tess Lina; Tom Schanley; and Steve Truitt.

==Reception ==

&quot;E²&quot; first aired on May 5, 2004. It received a 3.3/5% share, meaning that 3.3 percent of all households, and 5 percent of all households watching television at the time of the broadcast saw it. These were similar ratings to the previous episode, &quot;The Forgotten&quot;, and slightly lower than the following episode, &quot;The Council&quot;. Compared to other shows in the same time slot, it placed sixth on the night, one place behind &quot;Smallville&quot; on The WB.
Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation, saying that it &quot;focused far more on the characters and the consequences of their contact with their descendants than it is on the vast technobabble resulting in a successful traverse of the Xindi corridor.&quot; She praised David Andrews as Lorian, calling it &quot;a wonderful bit of casting,&quot; and felt that the character&#x27;s actions mirrored those of Captain Archer previously in the series. She compared the resolution of &quot;E²&quot; to the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Deadlock&quot; and the series finale of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;All Good Things...&quot;. She felt that the lack of conclusion to what happened to the future &quot;Enterprise&quot; was &quot;very satisfying.&quot; Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website Jammer&#x27;s Reviews, called the episode an &quot;acceptable but all-too-familiar time-travel concept,&quot; and a &quot;step down&quot; compared to the previous three episodes of the series. He compared it to the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Children of Time&quot;, which he said &quot;was a far superior episode because it was about our characters – astonishingly and agonizingly – choosing one destiny over another, and sacrificing a great deal in coming to that decision.&quot; He gave &quot;E²&quot; a rating of two and a half out of four.
&quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked &quot;E²&quot; as the seventh best episode of &quot;Enterprise&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; rated it as 92nd best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; up to that time, calling it a &quot;fine episode&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; also interviewed various cast and production crew of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise to determine the &quot;100 Greatest Episodes&quot; from across the five series, ranking &quot;E²&quot; as the 92nd best episode of all time.

==Home media release==
The first home media release of &quot;E²&quot; was as part of the season three DVD box set, released in the United States on September 27, 2005. It subsequently became one of three &quot;Enterprise&quot; episodes to be included in the &quot;Star Trek: Alternative Realities Collective&quot; DVD set which was released in 2009. The other episodes were &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; and &quot;Twilight&quot;, and also featured were other mirror universe installments including &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; and three of those from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The Blu-ray release of &quot;Enterprise&quot; was announced in early 2013, and released on January 7, 2014. This also featured deleted scenes from this episode.

<text>John Strachan (; 12 April 1778 – 1 November 1867) was a notable figure in Upper Canada, an &quot;elite member&quot; of the Family Compact, and the first Anglican Bishop of Toronto. He is best known as a political bishop who held many government positions and promoted education from common schools to helping to found the University of Toronto.

Gauvreau says in the 1820s he was &quot;the most eloquent and powerful Upper Canadian exponent of an anti-republican social order based upon the tory principles of hierarchy and subordination in both church and state&quot;. Craig characterizes him as &quot;the Canadian arch tory of his era&quot; for his intense conservatism. Craig argues that Strachan &quot;believed in an ordered society, an established church, the prerogative of the crown, and prescriptive rights; he did not believe that the voice of the people was the voice of God&quot;.

Strachan built his home in a large yard bound by Simcoe Street, York Street, and Front Street. It was a two-storey building that was the first building in Toronto to use locally manufactured bricks. The gardens and grounds of the property occupied the entire square and became a local Toronto landmark, being given the name &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Palace&quot;. After Strachan&#x27;s death, the home was converted into a private hotel called The Palace Boarding House.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Born 12 April 1778, Strachan was the youngest of six children born to the overseer of a granite quarry in Aberdeen, Scotland. His father&#x27;s name was John Strachan and his mother&#x27;s name was Elizabeth Findlayson. He graduated from King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, in 1797. After his father died in an accident in 1794, Strachan tutored students and taught school to finance his own education.

He emigrated to Kingston, Upper Canada, to tutor the children of Richard Cartwright. He applied to the pulpit of a Presbyterian church in Montreal but did not receive the position. He then became an Anglican minister and became a minister for a church in Cornwall, Ontario.

Strachan taught at a grammar school which was attended by the Upper Canadian elite. Strachan taught more than 20 students in 1804 and had about 40 by 1808. The children educated were trained to be &quot;potential rulers of the next generation&quot; by Strachan. Prime example being a fatherless boy of 12, named John Beverley Robinson who came to Strachan for education within a few weeks of Strachan&#x27;s settling in Cornwall. Robinson would become the eventual leader of the Family Compact. 

He married Ann McGill née Wood, widow of Andrew McGill, in the spring of 1807. Together they had nine children, some born in Cornwall and some in York - some children died young.

Strachan and McGill would have 3 children in Cornwall, and 6 children in York. The children born in Cornwall were James (1808), Elizabeth (1810, died in 1812), and George Cartwright (1812). The children born in York were Elizabeth Mary (1814), John (1815), Alexander Wood (1817), and Agnes (1822, died &quot;before reaching 17th birthday&quot;). Additionally in York, two daughters were born who died as infants.

==York and the War of 1812==
He moved to York, Upper Canada, just before the War of 1812, where he became rector of St. James&#x27; Church (which would later become his cathedral) and headmaster of the Home District Grammar School. This school, also known as &quot;The Blue School,&quot; taught students from five to seventeen and emphasized a practical means of learning. Students recited abridged speeches from the House of Commons, learned Latin, and were encouraged to ask questions of their fellow pupils.

A conservative, Strachan supported his nation during the War of 1812, using his sermons to support the suspension of civil liberties. Upon hearing that of the fall of Fort Detroit to British forces, Strachan declared in a sermon: &quot;The brilliant victory... has been of infinite service in confirming the wavering &amp; adding spirit to the loyal&quot;. Strachan had the young women of York knit flags for the militia regiments in which their menfolk were serving in and organized fundraising drives to give the militiamen serving on the Niagara frontier shoes and clothing.

In December 1812, Strachan founded the Loyal and Patriotic Society of Upper Canada which raised £21,500 to support the families of militiaman and care for the wounded. During the Battle of York in 1813, along with senior militia officers, Strachan negotiated the surrender of the city with American general Henry Dearborn. The Americans violated the terms by looting homes and churches and locked the wounded British soldiers and Upper Canada militiamen into a hospital without food or water for two days. Strachan went to meet to complain in person to Dearborn about the violation of the terms of surrender and shamed Dearborn into imposing order on his troops. He is credited with saving the city from American troops, eager to loot and burn it.

After the sack of York, Strachan sent his wife Anne and their children to Cornwall because he believed they would be safe there. A few months later, Cornwall was taken by the Americans, who looted the Strachan home and likely raped a then-pregnant Anne Strachan.

===Family Compact===
After the war, he became a pillar of the Family Compact, the conservative elite that controlled the colony. He was a member of the Executive Council of Upper Canada from 1815 to 1836 as well as the Legislative Council from 1820 to 1841. He was an influential advisor to the Lieutenant-Governors of Upper Canada and the other members of the Councils and Assemblies, many of whom were his former students. The &quot;Family Compact&quot; were the elite who shared his fierce loyalty to the British monarchy, his strict and exclusive Toryism and the established church (Anglicanism), and his contempt for slavery, Presbyterians, Methodists, American republicanism, and reformism. Strachan was a leader of anti-American elements, which he saw as a republican and democratic threat that promised chaos and an end to a well-ordered society. In 1822 he was appointed an honorary member of the Bank of Upper Canada.

Strachan invented the &quot;militia myth&quot; to the effect that the local militia had done more to defend Canada than the British Army, which has been rejected by Canadian historians.

Strachan supported a strict interpretation of the Constitutional Act of 1791, claiming that clergy reserves were to be given to the Church of England alone, rather than to Protestants in general. In 1826, his interpretation was opposed by Egerton Ryerson, who advocated the separation of church and state and argued that the reserves should be sold for the benefit of education in the province. Although Strachan long controlled the reserves through the Clergy Corporation, he was ultimately forced to oversee the selling off of most of the land in 1854.

===Educational interests===

Much of Strachan&#x27;s life and work was focused on education. He wanted Upper Canada to be under Church of England control to avoid American influence. He tried to set up annual reviews for grammar schools to make sure they were following Church of England doctrines and tried to introduce Andrew Bell&#x27;s education system from Britain, but those acts were vetoed by the Legislative Assembly. In 1827 Strachan chartered King&#x27;s College, an Anglican university, although it was not actually created until 1843.

In 1839, he was consecrated the first Anglican bishop of Toronto alongside Aubrey Spencer, the first Bishop of Newfoundland, at Lambeth Palace August 4. He founded Trinity College in 1851 after King&#x27;s College was secularized as the University of Toronto.

In 1835, he was forced to resign from the Executive Council, and he resigned from politics in 1841 after the Act of Union. He continued to influence his former students although the Family Compact declined in the new Province of Canada. Strachan helped organize the Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops in 1867 but died that year before it was held. Strachan was buried in a vault in the chancel of St. James&#x27; Cathedral. He was succeeded by Alexander Neil Bethune.

Strachan was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1846.

===First Nations===
Strachan was concerned with the Natives and called on people to embrace the &quot;sons of nature&quot; as brothers. He claimed that the United States desired Upper Canada primarily to exterminate the indigenous tribes and free up the West for American expansion. Strachan defended the autonomy of the Natives, the superiority of British governance, and the centrality of Upper Canada in the theatre of war against the US. He rejected the prevalent assumption at the time that Natives were simply pawns in the contest and gave an original and influential explanation of why Upper Canada was vital to both Native and Imperial concerns.

===High-church views===
Strachan was intensely devoted to the promotion of the Anglican position in Canada. He was born a Presbyterian in Scotland, but he never fully accepted it and first received communion at an Anglican church in Kingston. He was strongly influenced by the high-church bishop of New York, John H. Hobart. Strachan preached that the Anglican Church was a branch of the universal church and that it was independent of both pope and king.

Strachan defended the Church of England from opponents who wanted to reduce its influence in Upper Canada. He published a sermon that said a Christian nation needs a religious establishment, referring to the Anglican church as the establishment. He rejected the notion that clergy reserves were intended for all Protestant denominations and appealed to the Colonial Office to maintain that Anglican Church&#x27;s monopoly on these plots of land.

Like most Protestants of the era, he denounced the Roman Catholic Church for corruption. He rejected the revivalism of the Methodists as an American heresy and stressed the ancient practices and historic liturgy of his church. While a high churchman, Strachan&#x27;s view alienated many of his clergy and laity who were drawn from the ranks of Irish Protestant immigrants of more low-church persuasion.

Strachan wanted more funds disseminated to build church infrastructure in rural Upper Canada. While fundraising in England his trustworthiness was challenged when he created an Ecclesiastical Chart of the religious statistics of Upper Canada that contained numerous errors. He actively promoted missionary work, using the Diocesan Theological Institute at Cobourg to train clergy to handle frontier conditions. Much of his effort after 1840 was undermined by theological disputes in the church, such as between high-church tractarians and low-church evangelicals. He also faced external attacks from political reformers and rival denominations.

==Death and legacy==
Strachan died on 1 November 1867 in Toronto. His funeral procession took place on November 5, and wound through the city streets from his home at Front and York to St. James Cathedral.

A plaque at the University of Toronto erected by the Ontario Archaeological and Historic Sites Board commemorates the residence of Strachan. The Bishop&#x27;s Palace is the site where assembled the Loyalist forces that defeated William Lyon Mackenzie during the Rebellion of 1837.
In the summer of 2004, a bust of John Strachan was erected in the quadrangle of Trinity College at the University of Toronto. Strachan Avenue, running from the original site of Trinity College to Lake Shore Blvd., is also named in his honour.
